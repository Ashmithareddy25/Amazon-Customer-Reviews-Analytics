B000059MEK|5.0|I am not really into the whole techno scene, but I personally love Daft Punk.<br />I was hooked when I saw the story their four videos show (One More Time, Aerodynamic, Digital Love; and Harder, Better...).<br />When I first heard this CD I almost lost it.  This is the perfect music to have a a dance, and my 8th grade farewell dance had happened just a week before.<br />The techno beats and funky lyrics make this CD a must buy for everyone who is even the slightest bit into the techno scene, and if you are a DJ dont get caught without it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|this is really a great miniseries. the gun fighting and action is great but there also is a great story to it too. you get to see what it was like for the men that fought in that war. you also learn a lot too. before i saw this series i thought war was just tons of men killing each other untill everyone on one side where dead. after i saw it i realized it was more than that. before i saw this i also thought \\"what war movie could possibly be interesting\\". this series is so great that i spent over $$$ to buy it and watched it over and over again.
B000000OSG|5.0|I still have my original copies of UYI 1 and UYI 2 that I bought some 12 years ago at midnight when the record store opened so they could be sold. I still cant decide which of the 2 is best, 2 just might be a little better. While the 2 albums together have some filler, there is less on 2. We have the ass-kicking tunes YOU COULD BE MINE, PRETTY TIED UP, CIVIL WAR, YESTERDAY,14 YEARS, KNOCKIN ON HEAVENS DOOR. The songs SO FINE, ESTRANGED, LOCOMOTIVE are a little slower, but they are also great songs. The weak link on this album is MY WORLD, this is a song that we dont need. DONT CRY, with alternate lyrics we possibly could have done without, but it is still a good song so I guess thats cool. While I love both albums, and they still find there way into my stereo after 12 years, I agree with some of the reviewers that we might have been better off with just one double album. Like I said before, I consider these albums to be their EXILE ON MAIN ST., and shows the promise this band had before all the internal conflicts ripped them apart. Yes I think they could have been as big as the ROLLING STONES, but we will never know. I highly recommend adding this album to your collection.
B000002H97|5.0|Metallica's Black Album was when the band really began to open up.  For example, Enter Sandman is about childhood fears, Sad but True is about how alchohol had &quot;masked&quot; the band, and controlled them, and Nothing Else Matters was a song Hetfield originally wrote for his girlfriend but Lars convinced him to make it a Metallica song.  I've had this CD for years and I still listen to it very often.  Really listen to the dynamics on this CD, especially in Nothing Else Matters; it uses pretty much EVERY string on the guitar.
0790729652|4.0|I have never been a comic book reader, so if you're familiarization with Batman stems from comics you might as well move one.  My real familiarity with the character stems from the rediculous sixties TV show and the cartoon.  Based on that the movies was inarguably superior.  This movie portrays Batman in a dark, gothic, vigilante light that makes him somehow more real and understandable.  I think Michael Keaton was an excellent Batman, in that he was not very heroic in and of himself.  Thus he represented the everyman quality that the average viewer could relate to.  Jack Nicholson was (of course) brilliant.  I enjoyed this film.  The second film was o.k. and it went quickly down hill from there
078322687X|4.0|In this very realistic teen movie, we find 5 teens at school for a Saturday's detention. At the start we se very obvious examples of different levels of high school. The outcasts on the bottom , and the popular at the top. As the movie develops so do the characters. This movie delivers laughs,tears,joy,and sadness. It features some drug content, language, sexual dialogue, and thematic elements. I recommend it for middle to high schoolers.<BR>The reason I gave this movie 4 of 5 stars is because of the lack of features, I mean come on! They could have put at least a few deleted scenes or a \\"making of\\" documentary. There isn't even a trailer!!! I'm getting the high school reunion edition, atleast it has a trailer!
B000002WPI|5.0|This album kinda reminds you of the good ol' when days hip hop was filled with honesty, greatness and skills. Wu-tang clan definetly restores the feelings of the good ol days with songs like \\"protect ya neck\\" and \\"C.R.E.A.M\\". This album inspired a generation of fans including myself. Im not sure if we are going to see another album like this, but you never know. this album is a classic!!

B000005HO0|5.0|This is one filthy, nasty, mean, crude, etc... cd. The picture of this album should be on the side of the definition of black metal.  This is what exactly what bm is all about.  Dead's vocals were a perfect fit for Mayhem and their classic lineup of then (Dead, Euronymous, Necrobutcher & Hellhammer).  You know the sound you make when you vomit?  Well then that's the best way to describe Dead's vocals on \\"Live In Leipzig\\".  He's vomiting and shouting the lyrics at the same time. Attila's voice on \\"De Myteriis Dom Sathanas\\" is a growling, raspy and grimacing type of voice and is pale compared to Dead's gutpuking sound, but then again I don't think anyone can sound as heavy as Dead.  The recording is very raw and low quality but since it's rare that's why they probably released it.  I've heard some nasty music but when I first popped in this cd I have to say that I was freaked, even intimidated at how sinister they were on this recording. If there's any form of music that's heavier than this I'd like to know what it is. This is the sound of pure evil making music.
B00003CXFG|5.0|This is the first time I saw Vin Diesel and I knew it certainly would not be the last. His character is perfect (like that incredible body and voice) and the special effects are primo. Diesel OWNS this picture, even though he is backed by an exceptional cast of characters. Whoever chose the virtual unknown for the part should have gotten a hefty bonus. He was absoulute perfection in a damn good movie. Definately a thumbs up.<br /><br />We have a space ship crash landing on a barren planet. Oddly enough, they just happen to land near the ONLY settlement which probably has the ONLY water on this blasted place. Plus, they manage to do it at a time when monsters are lurking about, which is a trick since it only happens once every twenty-two freakin' years!<br /><br />Aboard we have an odd assortment of characters (not to mention first-rate actors): Besides the usual expendibles, we have a captain who tries to kill everyone, a good guy who isn't, a bad guy whos the hero, and a little boy who's a girl. You still with me?<br /><br />Faults: If the beasties come out every twenty-two years and ravage the entire planet, where did the big animals come from whose skeletons we see? What the heck did animals that freakin' big drink? Or, even, where? There appear to be millions of the flying monsters -- what have they been eating UNDERGROUND for the last 22 years? How is it that they suddenly flew like bats after living in a hole all their lives? How come one expendible gets sucked in the hole from just sticking his head in, when the captain manages to climb in the thing and wander around, then get out with barely a scratch?<br /><br />Do these faults really matter?  Only if you're a bit anal like myself. The acting and effects are so bloody good you forget about the problems and just get involved in the film.<br /><br />By the way, I loved the kid. He/she is perfect, much like Diesel. (I wish they'd taken the same actor and used her in the sequel, CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK, instead of going for the \\"pretty face\\".) Also, the sudden appearance of an expendible (who is promptly mistaken for the escaped convict) was an unexpected kick.<br /><br />My movie ratings are as follows: 1) Just don't bother, 2)Borrow it if you MUST see the thing, 3) Rent it, 4) Pay to see it on the big screen, and 5)BUY IT ASAP. This one gets a 4 and a 5.<br /><br />The highest praise a movie can get is is kept my total attention throughout.

B00008H2LB|2.0|A carbon-copy of their first album, and not even a good one. After the promising \\"Reanimation\\" (technically their best album, although they needed a dozen other artists) I really thought they would stretch out as musicians. How foolish! 2 stars for \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" and \\"Faint\\".
0375823360|5.0|I absolutely love this book and I would recommend it to everyone and anyone.  I partially write this review in order to vent because this trilogy offers such fantastic plot, character, and imagery that I am stunned.  I read these three books a couple of years ago and I have held them in highest honor on my bookshelf.  I've reread all three many times.  However, after reading Stephen King's review of JK Rowling's \\"The Order of the Pheonix\\", in which he states that he believes Harry Potter to be better than His Dark Materials, I am offended.  The books are different and I love both of them.  I am enthralled with Will and Lyra (though Will is closest to my heart).  Their journey through the worlds, their peril, their love and what they show about all the universal things (religion, love, good and evil...)brought tears to my eyes.  Some people will differ in their opinion about His Dark Materials as litterature, but I know that Philip Pullman weaves a great story.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|To say that quality television has gone down the drain is an understatement. With such low-brow entertainment out there to satisfy every perverse voyeuristic urge, it was with great surprise and pleasure that I stumbled upon Firefly. The term 'diamond in the rough' is cliched, but I believe apt. This is a gritty, realistic series that makes a strange, though fascinating mating of the science-fiction and the western. Flawless acting, sharp and dry humour, this is no tale of exploration or peacemaking. This is a tale of day-to-day survival, of trying to keep food on the table and a ship in the sky by taking any job. Don't much matter what it is.
0385335482|5.0|I absolutely LOVED reading about Becky Bloomwood in \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic,\\" by Sophie Kinsella. I mean, don't we ALL have an evil shopper in all of us?<BR>Becky represents the shopper with a good heart and poor credit.In her struggles to maintain her bank account, her job, and - oooh - that new pink sweater set, she gets a little sidetracked.  I laughed all the way through this novel, and I think any female who loves to shop will be able to relate to this book, learn from it, and find great humor in it!
B00005JLT5|5.0|Roman Polanski's epic film The Pianist is a wonderful retelling of the life of Wladyslaw Spilman, a Polish Jew and magnificient piano player whose career was cut short when the Germans invaded Poland.  At first the restrictions placed on Szpilman and his family don't seem so bad, but as time goes on they are forced to move into the Jewish ghetto, where they are eventually loaded onto a train bound for one of the concentration camps.  As Szpilman is waiting to board the train with his family, however, he is pulled from the crowd by one of the ghetto police, Jews who are working for the German officers in hopes of better treatment, and told to run away.  From that point on his life becomes a struggle for survival, working for the Germans until they liquidate the ghetto, then being smuggled from one safe house to another until he is finally discovered in the bombed-out ruins of a flat by Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, a German officer who is so moved by Szpilman's music that he decides to keep the secret of the pianist's survival until the Germans retreat from the city.<br />Adrien Brody played the role of Wladyslaw Szpilman with great sensitivity, showing Szpilman to be a man of deep feeling who is witnessing the horrors of the war all around him, but doing what he must to survive.  Adrien Brody was able to make the character of Szpilman so believable and human that I found myself near tears several times during the course of the movie.  Thomas Kretschmann was also very good as Capt. Hosenfeld, the young German officer who provides aid and comfort to Szpilman after hearing him play the piano.  While I was watching this particular scene I could actually see Hosenfeld being torn between his duty to his Motherland and doing what he knew to be right as a human being, and Kretschmann played it just right.<br />In the end, The Pianist was a wonderful movie, and one of Polanski's greatest achievements.  I highly recommend that anyone who hasn't seen it do so at the first available opportunity.opportunity.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Instead of your typical pumped full of steroids male, you get the very svelte, toned &amp; very female, Angelina Jolie, playing the computer game heroine. Making a computer game into a film has not always been well accepted in cinemas - for example, Mortal Kombat &amp; Resident Evil - but this one is a sure-fire hit for the studio. Had they not picked Angelina, it might not have been that good. I can't see it being good without her. You really can't imagine anyone else in that role now. She's taken it and made it hers.<br />Apart from the physical attributes she brings to the role (put the tongues away guys), she also manages to speak very well in an English accent, which actors have failed to do so in the past. (Think Keanu Reeves in `Bram Stoker's Dracula' or Tom Cruise's pitiful excuse for an Irish accent in `Far &amp; Away')<br />Angelina has been well known for her tattoos, so the studio probably weren't that keen on her for the role, because of the difficulty make-up artists would have had covering them up. None of them can be seen during the film - particularly the well-known `Billy Bob' tattoo on her left arm. It's not easy to cover up tattoos, and sure, some of her tattoos are in parts of her body which wouldn't be shown on film, but that `Billy Bob' tattoo must have been HELL for makeup artists every day.<br />The CGI &amp; the set are extremely similar to `The Mummy' and `The Mummy Returns', and all three films obviously take their inspiration from the Indiana Jones movies.<br />There's not as much action or violence as I expected in this film, I expected a lot more. There are bursts of violence, interspersed with strange scenes, with a haunting/pounding soundtrack. The use of guns is big in this film, shooting the strange CGI, or shooting bad guys - none of whom seem seriously hurt!<br />I know he's dead in the film, but Jon Voight, as Lara's father (and also her father in real life!), should have had a bigger role. He's only really seen at the start, opposite a young actress playing a young Lara Croft, and then at the end, playing opposite his real-life daughter.<br />If you're a fan of Red Dwarf, look out for Chris Barrie (Rimmer), in the very Batman butler role of Henry.<br />I didn't expect to enjoy this movie, but as I like Angelina Jolie as an actress, I thought I'd give it a go. It's very fast paced, the time flies by and before you know it, it's over. I'm glad I bought it now.opposite a young actress playing a young Lara Croft, and then at the end, playing opposite his real-life daughter. <br />If you're a fan of Red Dwarf, look out for Chris Barrie (Rimmer), in the very Batman butler role of Henry.<br />I didn't expect to enjoy this movie, but as I like Angelina Jolie as an actress, I thought I'd give it a go.

B0000067L4|4.0|This is Cream's last album, and it's decent, but it's not as good as the other albums like Disraeli Gears and Wheels of Fire. However, the main reason to get this album is the live songs. I'm So Glad is another great classic jam that was in the vein of some of the live cuts off of Wheels Of Fire. The best thing about this, though, is that everyone is soloing at the same time. You can hear the rythym messup. Politician and Sitting On Top Of The World are 10 times better live than on the album. As for the studio songs, they're really good. Badge is one of the prettiest Cream songs ever, right next to Anyone for Tennis, and Doing That Scrapyard Thing reminds me of Traffic. What A Bringdown is good for a Ginger Baker song (Blue Condition [stinks]), and I have a version of the album with Anyone for Tennis on it, which might be the 5th time it's been on a record. Good album, although it's about 28 minutes.
B00005JM1F|5.0|Firstly, this is totally subjective - I am not saying this is the best movie ever made.  In fact, its not even supposed to be a &quot;good&quot; movie, its supposed to be a comedy. With that said, if you complained about the directing or cinematography (or anything like that) of this movie, you sound like the kind of person who probably shouldnt have watched this in the first place.  Now, personally, this is the funniest movie I have ever seen.  Due to the comedic attempt to comedic success ratio being almost 100% (there are two &quot;meant to be funny parts&quot; that I feel are weak), it already beats out every other comedy I can think of (again, this is very subjective so relax all you Emerson film students).  So basically, I think this is a really witty, really quotable and even layered (is that ok to say about a comedy other than a Christopher Guest movie?) that will stay fresh after repeated viewings and always lead you to another nuance that you didnt notice before.
B000099T2L|2.0|This is very difficult for me because I do like Beyonce &amp; do think she is very talented. I am a huge music fan &amp; love all types of music &amp; a variety of different artists. Furthermore, I also partake in writing reviews &amp; never write a negative review; however, because I respect Beyonce as an artist I am hoping that this constructive review will give her some fan insight on her next project. The song &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; is real catchy &amp; a great song, but as much as I hate to admit this, Crazy.. is the only track that really stands out on the album.  Sorry Beyonce.  I was hoping for more of an equal mix of up beat tracks w/ some ballads mixed in to showcase her Angelic voice.  Unfortunately, most of the tracks are slow &amp; boring (Sorry Beyonce). It should at least be 1/2 &amp; 1/2, but 85-90% of the album is too slow. Again, I must reiterate that this is very hard &amp; I will still buy her music because she has a beautiful voice &amp; is very talented.  I actually really enjoy Kelly Rowland's cd because it maintains an up beat &amp; catchy momentum throughout &amp; includes a perfect mix of grooves along with a few slower/ballad tracks.  I still love yah Beyonce &amp; will still by your music &amp; your Destiny music, but as hard as this is for me - this album did not showcase the true talent you have.  You have it, but it was't revealed here.  This is a constructive review &amp; if by any far fetched chance BK ever reads this you haven't lost a fan &amp; I look forward to your next project.  Oh, 1 more thing.  Your performance on the Diva show a few mnths ago was phenominal.  My mouth dropped.  You were unparalled &amp; the best performer.  You totally outperformed all of them, even Whitney, who performed the worst out of all - a complete bomb.

To my disappointment,<br />I really didn't think it was that engaging in terms of the<br />story and characters.  Sure it was creative (no-face, yubaba)<br />but for me it just didn't drive the story at all.  Its about a two hour movie, but for me it felt more like 4 or 5 hours...<br />it was THAT bad.

As always Benjamin Graham has a solid approach to investing that fits a long term approach. <br />Right now with all of wall street's shenanigans it is hard to determine if the company's value is truly stated. Plus with derivatives taking over the marketplace it is almost impossible to just stick to one approach to investing. Especially in the short term. That is why I recommend the book \\"Futures For Small Speculators\\" in addition to this book if you want a strategy for the short term and the long term style of investing that will be necessary in the 21st century.
B00005OM5L|4.0|Nice songs, beautifull performance. When I bought it, I knew Cocaine was not part of the show. After playing it, believe me, I missed Cocaine.
B000003TAB|5.0|Incesticide, released in 1992 after the massive success of Nevermind, shows Nirvana returning to their roots by releasing a compilation of B-Sides, early songs and covers, the majority of them recorded before 1991. Despite the fact that it is a scattered album, it goes together the way Nevermind and In utero did. Most of these songs are as powerful as their most famous, and more successful songs, like the somber &quot;Big Long Now,&quot; the pop tale of being abandoned by your parents &quot;Sliver,&quot; and &quot;Aneurysm&quot; one of the most awesome Nirvana songs ever.<br />Incesticide does slip into mediocrity in a few tracks. I never liked &quot;Hairspray Queen,&quot; &quot;Beeswax&quot; drags somewhat and &quot;Mexican Seafood&quot; passes me by every time I hear it. On your average day I'd bring it down a point, but I'm in a very generous mood and since it's an outtakes/B-Sides collection that goes together almost perfectly, and it's worth buying... though I recommend it after Nevermind, In Utero, and even Bleach.

B00003CX8V|5.0|I saw this movie on TV when I was first starting my career in Houston, Texas.  It gave me some perspective on the life that exists within the walls of the workplace.  In the words of the Shirley MacClaine character, \\"Some people are givers, and some people are takers\\".  We find both types in the workplace and in life.  How often have you known someone, maybe even us who've been used by a \\"taker\\".<br />This movie tells the price you pay, when you sacrifice your morals for selfish reasons. Jack Lemmon plays a young accountant, who has found a unique way to advance his career up the corporate ladder.  He loans out his apartment in the city, for [dates] by executives in his company.  He actually receives little real help, most of them are just using their position, to shine him on, and get what they want.  <br />When one of the bigger bosses in the company finds out about the arrangement, and decides he wants exclusive rights, the young accountant must decide what is more important. The good news is:  this big boss really can help him advance his career.  Is it worth selling his morality, for higher position within the company?  <br />Of course he gets a little help making up his mind. Depressed from finding out a girl he likes is just another, \\"businessman's special\\", who uses his apartment. ....<br />Like many Billy Wilder films, this movie has the power to touch our emotions. It does so in ways we wouldn't have thought possible.  It has enough humor to balance some of the tragic moments, and not to decend into the realm of melodrama. It is intentionally filmed in black and white, so not to distract from the story.  It won the Best Picture Oscar for 1960.
B000002SE0|1.0|Nilsson the wagnarian soprano is all wrong as Turandot. She sounds German and Wagnerian in tone. Not at all a warm sound Puccini intended. Scotto has the Italian train voice, but she has a harsh voice and has a wide, unpleasant vibrato. Corelli is worst of all. Scooping at every high note, and there a throb in his middle range, very rough sounding Calaf. <BR>My recommendation is the outstanding Turandot with Nilsson/Bjoeling/Tebaldi. At 1959, Nilsson is a bit warmer in sound, perhaps because of the mono-ish sounding recording. Bjoeling, though not in prime condition can outsing Corelli anyday of the week. But the star is Renata Tebaldi, the great Italian diva who kills Callas vocally(beauty and the beast rivalry-need I say who is the beauty and who is the beast).<BR>The Tebaldi Liu is my idea of what Puccini in mind. She and Caballe are the two Lius who are perfection. Although the Caballe set also has a wonderful Calaf in Pavarotti, who is in his bloom of his career, singing Nessum Dorma as no one can, you will have to put up with Joan Sutherland. Gorgeous as Sutherland's voice is, she does not have the temperament to sing a verisimo role.<BR>That's why, the final Turandot still remains Nilsson/Bjoeling/Tebaldi.
B000002HMH|4.0|After you do &quot;The Black Album,&quot; one of the best records of all time, where do you go? Apparently, if you're Metallica, you temper your metal edged agression with a newfound bluesy style. Many(and that's a huge understatement)people consider this record a sellout, but that's just not true. Sure, it's a departure from the chugging rhythms of their past, but even without that, Metallica prove they can still knock you down. &quot;Wasting My Hate&quot; has a laid back intro, followed by slammin' C.O.C. style riffs. Actually they sound like a more metal version of C.O.C. And listening to &quot;Ronnie&quot; and the sludgy &quot;Cure&quot; you can hear why.The change in style really benefits James Hetfield's vocals, as he sounds more down to earth, with more personality than in the past. Guitarist Kirk Hammett still serves up volley after volley of tasty wah-wah solos, although he at times sounds a little too laid back. This is a minor complaint on a successful transitional album.
0679411585|5.0|For those who enjoy military history, or want to read a few of the most significant books on the Vietnam war, this book is a must.  While newcomers to the topic should start with a more general history of the war, such as Stanley Karnow's &quot;Vietnam,&quot; this book, along with Neil Sheehan's &quot;A Bright and Shining Lie,&quot; will always be one of the classics on this war.  The book vividly tells the story of two very bloody battles in the Ia Drang valley, Pleiku province, in 1965: at Landing Zone (LZ) X-ray and, a few days later, at LZ Albany.  Lt. Gen. Hal Moore, commander at LZ X-Ray (then a Lt. Col.), and reporter Joe Galloway, who lived through the horror of that battle, aptly describe the chaos of battle in the war's first major encounter between U.S. troops and the North Vietnamese regular army.  The authors recount oral recollections of survivors.  The book also describes the background of the war, the preparation of the 7th Cav as a new type of unit--air mobile by helicopter--and the mismanagement of the Johnson administration in so many ways: the loss of experienced personnel by the one-year assignment practice, the six month limit on battalion and brigade commanders, and allowing the enemy sanctuary in Cambodia. One of the strongest points of the book is its strong and moving sense of the cost of war to individuals and families:  Hal Moore, besides being a top-knotch commander, is a true human being who felt deeply the loss of each of his men, over the years visiting their families and weeping at the graves of his fallen soldiers. This book is a battle history which does not glorify war, but shows it for the bloody, heart-wrenching chaos it is.  It teaches that our nation should be slow to go to war, but when we must, it must be conducted with sound policies and tactics that will bring a swift end to the bloodshed and achieve the political goals of the conflict.  Families today still mourn daily the loss of soldiers from long-ago battles. The priceof war is the highest price human beings can pay.  Yet without at times paying this price, both Americans and other peoples who love political and economic freedom would historically have lived in slavery to one political ideology or another.  The difficult thing for us as a nation collectively is to have the wise judgment to know when and how to fight. This outstanding book teaches us the importance of such wise judgment when it comes to the nightmare of war.
B00008LDPU|3.0|This is undeniably a great idea; fleshing out a fictional world with nine animated shorts. I appreciate that the Wachowskis are trying to design a multi-media franchise from the ground up, done right. However, the execution falls short. <br />FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS<BR>Not so much a story as three interconnected set-pieces: a swordplay-foreplay martial arts scene, a running battle between a hovercraft and a swarm of hunter robots, and a Freemind making a run through the Matrix. <br />Photo-realistic reproductions of moving human beings never seem to quite work right (maybe it's because they don't have tongues). <br />PROGRAM<BR>One Freemind tempts another with happily-ever-after in the Matrix, while fighting through a samurai fantasy virtual world. This plays with the way people will say and do different things in different environments. <br />KID'S STORY<BR>Where's they get the idea for this one? A fanfic written by a 12-year-old? At best, it's an immature ego fantasy. At worst, it's playing into the belief that you can escape your humdrum reality by sheer force of will, the kind of thinking that made the Tokyo subway gassing and Columbine possible.<br />SECOND RENNAISSANCE I,II<BR>A mythic retelling of the world's back story, the rise of the AIs and the war that nearly destroyed humanity. The visual storytelling is excellent and produces some memorable images. <br />The biggest problem is that it follows the ludicrous backstory that humanity created the nuclear winter effect to kill the machines, instead of vice versa, which would make far more sense. Plus it sticks with the \\"humans as power source\\" nonsense. Hopefully, the Wachowskis will ret-con this foolishness out of continuity some day. <br />DETECTIVE STORY<BR>A triumph of visual atmosphere over anything else. A detective searches for Trinity and discovers how she can just disappear. <br />WORLD RECORD<BR>The most original of the stories. A sprinter's attempt to crack the speed record attracts the attention of Agents. Makes sprinting look as violent as pro boxing. <br />BEYOND<BR>Probably the most beautiful of the stories. A woman searches for her cat in an abandoned house, where reality has a few glitches. Time stretches, snaps back, repeats. Gravity fluctuates. It captures those odd moments of magic where you feel the rules are momentarily changed. <br />MATRICULATED<BR>They definitely saved the best for last. Peter Chung brings his patented brand of psychosexual weirdness to the Matrix, and it's a perfect mix. (Watch \\"Aeon Flux\\" and you'll see the resemblance.)<br />A team of freeminds attempt to bring a hunter robot over to their side by giving it a human-like body in a fantasy world. Since machines don't dream, they have no way to consider one reality more real than any other. When their base is attacked, which side will the robot choose?<br />Chung's work proves that you can tell a story that is visually exciting and sexy, yet thought-provoking. If anybody in the U.S. should be making animated feature films, it's Chung. <br />The Animatrix is sweet, but only four stories (\\"Program\\", \\"World Record\\", \\"Beyond\\", \\"Matriculated\\") didn't leave me feeling like I had eaten a cup of icing sugar. Still, four out of nineis much better than Sturgeon's Law would suggest. I hope that they don't abandon this idea, and keep making animated shorts.
B00008PX8P|5.0|The audio and video production quality is spectacular. The lineage of concert footage, which includes performances from the early days to the last days, including the Presence and In Through The Out Door albums, the quality of the phototography and the sound truly does Led Zeppelin justice. If you buy only one Led Zeppelin DVD - this is the one to get.
B000063UR2|5.0|This film has too often been overlooked as being a legitimate part of the top-shelf films of the fantasy genre.  Granted, there aren't all that many fantasy films to begin with, and even fewer that are worth anything.  Nonetheless, this is one of the good ones &amp; should be considered as such.<br />The movie is basically a fairy-tale that has a whole lot of motifs from mythology mixed in.  The typical hero's (Tom Cruise) journey to the underworld is well represented.  Tim Curry does a great job of playing the demonic ruler of the underworld.<br />A young Mia Sara plays the fairy-talesque naive young woman of innocence.  Her abduction to the underworld and the attempts of the dark lord to seduce her reminded me a great deal of the tale of Persephone's abduction by Hades in Greek mythology.<br />In this editon, you get 2 different versions of the film.  One is the Director's Cut and the other is the theatrical release.  The Director's Cut is about 24 minutes longer, but the most drastic difference are the soundtracks.  The Director's Cut uses a soundtrack written by Jerry Goldsmith, while the theatrical release offers the familiar TANGERINE DREAM rendition.<br />While some aspects of the film may seem incomplete, this is a terrific movie for an escape into an imaginary world.  That it's done by one of the greatest directors in the world doesn't hurt, either.  Regardless of the version you favor, LEGEND is the kind of delightful &amp; refreshing movie that makes us believe we'll never grow old.
B00005JKG9|5.0|David Mamet's unquestionable masterpiece, Glengarry Glen Ross, was made into perhaps one of the best dramas of the early 90's. It stands as having some of the best dialogue of any movie I have ever seen, and definitely one of the best cast ensembles as well. This is one DVD release I couldn't wait to get my hands on.<br />In the shady world of real estate sales, good leads (customers) can make or break the salesman. The Glengarry leads (the best available) have arrived at Premier Properties, but with a message that unless sales pick up, they will not be given the prime customers, and consequently be fired. The late Jack Lemmon plays Shelly \\"The Machine\\" Levene, a former top closer who is on a bad streak, and Al Pacino delivers a powerhouse performance as Richard Roma, the hotshot of the month. Two others (Ed Harris and Alan Arkin) are equally unahappy with their jobs, and conspire to strike back at the company they work for. The leads are \\"for closers only\\", so the pressure mounts on them to perform while their personal lives are in equal turmoil. This is one of the most depressing, but brilliant, stories ever adapted to film.<br />The quality of the script and the acting speaks for itself. The characters are people who have sold their soul in the pursuit of money, but we are still able to sympathize with them. Lemmon in particular gives one of his grittiest performances as a truly tortured soul who is living under a constant raincloud. Al Pacino is way over the top with his character, with some of the juciest lines. It is easy to see why some people wouldn't like the script (the constant profanity), but the dialogue in this movie is priceless.<br />The long awaited Special Edition is somewhat hit and miss with the special features. The pieces from \\"Inside the Actor's Studio\\" are priceless, the documentary \\"A.B.C. Always Be Closing\\", while not overly exciting, is very interesting. Also good is the Tribute to Jack Lemmon, where a handful of actors (including his son Chris) remember Jack Lemmon through anecdotes and other insights into his career and personality. Rather bland, on the other hand, is the comentary by Director James Foley. I was completely tedious at times. Otherwise, this is a quality DVD package. The transfer and the Widescreen presentation far surpass the laserdisc and VHS versions.<br />There should be a law that states that every film buff should have this movie in their collection. It is that good. Some of the best performances from very distinguised actors and a script that can melt candles...what more could you want?n Chris) remember Jack Lemmon through anecdotes and other insights into his career and personality.

0792151712|1.0|My wife and I saw TITANIC on opening night.  At some point, perhaps halfway through the movie, I wanted to depart because the stupid and phony tale of the male and female leads left me dumbstruck and spoiled the otherwise appealing visuals.  Unfortunately, my wife refuses to ever leave a movie that we paid to see, so, I did stay and see the entire film.<br />A couple of years later, while I was with friends and family, I forced myself to view the entire video to see whether my initial impression was too harsh. It was not.<br />If an edition could be sold that omitted any broadcast of or reference to the male and female leads, including the portions where the woman has aged, that version would be worth watching.  When that video appears it may rate five stars.  This version of TITANIC is one star; it is a colossal disappointment as story, film, and entertainment.

B00008O31H|3.0|I really could grade this album using 2 sets of criteria:<br />1. If you're looking a fun, mindless, hard-rocking disc, this is the one for you. These guys, despite being a guitar/drum two piece, sound nothing like the White Stripes. This is old-school traditional blues played by a couple young white kids. Auerbach is a genuinely good guitarist (something Jack White really isn't) and has a voice built for the blues: raw and soulful. Again, unlike the Stripes, Patrick Carney is a VERY good drummer - one can hear hip-hop and funk in his beats. The production here is VERY lo-fi - raw and scratchy.<br />2. If you're looking for an original, inspired album, look elsewhere. All this has been done before, and frankly, it's been done better.<br />As another reviewer said, if you're a big fan of 60's era British Blues, this is a good CD to pick up - it continues the trend started by bands like Cream, Fleetwood Mac, and the Faces.
B00005K9QP|5.0|I once dated a woman who had this album, and she always liked to play it on Sundays mornings. Of course it can be played at any time, but I do often play it at weekend while cleaning up the house. Once you promise yourself that you will play the Bluesbreakers album while cleaning up the bathroom, you just can't wait to get started on that toilet bowl.<br />Incongruous? Maybe, but then what could be more incongruous than a bunch of English guys singing the work songs of black men imprisoned on Mississipi's notorious Parchman Farm, a.k.a. Mississipi State Penitentiary, an institution that even now is rarely out of the news and, even if it has been temporarily replaced by Guantanamo Bay, is still a byword for inhumane treatment of prisoners (also see John Grisham's 'The Chamber')?<br />Who cares? Here you have the young Eric Clapton playing up a storm on guitar, some funky harmonica from John Mayall, a bass player who would later achieve fame and fortune with Fleetwood Mac. If you like electric blues-rock, the only question is why you don't already have this classic album. Also, if you care, you have the first recorded Clapton lead vocal on Ramblin' On My Mind, a freshman effort that arguably eclipses the warblings of the somewhat feeble vocal chords of John Mayall.<br />So there you have it. A classic album. Enough said.
0393320928|5.0|I had heard of Richard Feynman a few years back and never had the time to read any of his writings. I picked this book up on a whim to read on a flight to New York and since reading &quot;What Do You Care What Other People Think?&quot; I have picked up many of his books. His writing style is direct and should be easy to understand for almost all readers. I would suggest to readers that they start with &quot;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!&quot; but that is not necessary. If you are a lover of science, travel, or reading about one mans views on life this is the perfect book to read.
0385504209|4.0|The DaVinci Code is a great page turner, with plenty of action and intellectual puzzles. It's great for an airplane ride or a day at the beach. The puzzle draws you in immediately and keeps you spellbound. If you like fast paced suspense novels with historical ties, you'll love this book. With that being said, I still think the Eight by Katherine Neville is the best book of this kind ever written.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|A great CD to listen to while you're driving, although you'll probably have to watch your speed, because the exhilarating score will have you cruisin'.  This would not be your choice if you want nice, quiet background music while reading by the pool, but if your taste is exciting, swashbuckling orchestration, this is a soundtrack that you will be playing over and over as we have.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I have been going to see Gavin play for 2 years now and NYC's little secret it out.  IT'S ABOUT TIME!!!

B00005V3Z4|1.0|Donnie Darko is another time-warp movie.  There's some originality to the plot, but the overall idea is not too original, or particularly coherent.  This is another example of a movie made by drug addicts who put their crazed minds on screen, to pollute the American general public.  Stupid movie with terrible acting.  Avoid.  You won't get anything interesting; only to make the drug addict filmmakers and their souless studio executive backers richer so they could buy more illicit drugs.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Michael Mann's \\"Heat\\" not only has everything a great crime drama should in terms of plot and action, but also all the elements of a masterpiece of filmmaking. The dialogue is terse and no-nonsense; the stellar ensemble cast provides flawless performances; and the plot is thoughtfully nuanced, striking a perfect balance between action and meaningful character development. Scenes portraying the professional/criminal lives of the characters are blended seamlessly into scenes that give us in-depth looks into their personal lives. As a character study, the script draws fascinating contrasts and parallels between Pacino's and De Niro's characters. Refreshingly, the supporting cast serves an actual purpose in terms of plot development and influencing the actions of the main characters. It is this insight into the personal lives and relationships of the characters as much as any other aspect of the film that will hold your interest.<br />As far as the plot is concerned, it will keep you riveted provided that you have an adult attention span. The film runs nearly 3 hours, but not a minute is wasted.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I have heard some reviewers whine and complain about how horrible this movie is because we are led to sympathize with the bad guys. One reviewer, Daniel Wahl, even rants about how the movie industry is taking a happy wonderful genre and turning it dark and horrible. Well, I want to say that I personally can't stand those syrupy sweet, unrealistic musicals where everything is so nice, the good guys always win with a minimum of effort and all is right with the world. Also, this is not some spur of the moment musical. It is a classic, having been written and rewritten as a classic Broadway musical and various movie versions, one starring Marilyn Monroe. It is based on the real trials of two women in the thirties who did get away with murder. It is dark AND sexy, and the scene with the lady murderers singing about killing their men is one of the sexiest in the movie. If you want sweet and cheerful, get the Sound of Music (gag me with a spoon.) If you want a truly spectacular movie musical, get Chicago.
B00005JMC6|4.0|I find myself agreeing with the other reviewers. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film keeping me captivated from beginning to end. While the basic premise of the story line is retold in many stories (person overcomes a perceived \\"handicap\\" to flourish), the way it is told is a breath of fresh air and a good lesson in the basics of humanity that transcends all cultures. It was a delight to see that the culture of these Maori (indiginous tribe of New Zealand), particularly how their struggle is insync with the struggle of many cultures today who are losing their identity and roots to the ever emerging new world order. This movie is based upon fiction mixed with mythology and legend and should be perceived as such - failure to understand this might lead one to think the spirituality of it is overdone. This was the same plight for desenters of \\"Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon\\" who complained about the unrealistic martial art moves.<br />\\"Whale Rider\\" is so much more than just a young girl who would become leader. This movie will not disappoint. BTW, I reserve full five stars for what I consider best in genre and this is very close but I still think \\"Ran\\" has this one beat. Regardless, it will be a valuable addition to my DVD collection when it comes out.
B000063DFN|5.0|this cd is by far the most origional and talented piece of work ive heard in a long time. The guitars are amazing, along with the rest of the band!!! Even though i have to say my favorite genres are hardcore/metalcore, norweigan metal and a little melodic death metal, I love this album and i cant listen to just one song on it, or i have a hard time just choosing one because they are all so catchy and great that its hard to go from one song to the other without feeling like your losing something. I can't say if this is their best album, i don't know that, but it is definently one of the best albums made ever.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|When I first heard the score to Gore Verbinski's new action-filled comedy, I knew it was a score I had to have.  I've been a fan of Klaus Badelt since the inspiring score to 'The Time Machine'. When I bought this CD, it was a few days before it was actually released, but it was worth the wait.  The score is a wonderful, sweeping, uplifting adventure theme, ranking in my minds with the Indiana Jones (John Williams) themes. Buy this CD. It's worth every penny
6305313687|1.0|Wow. The number of glowing reviews for this repellent little work of art shows what a fine job our public schools are doing at turning people into mind-numbed, politically correct morons. American History X juxtaposes the perfectly rational dialogue by the film's main \\"racist\\" (Norton's character) with appalling acts of violence, in an attempt to link reasonable and legitimate conservative opinions with outright racism. (I can just imagine what the geniuses who admire this film will say after reading this review... \\"Reasonable???\\") The filmmaker is trying to say that holding opinions expressed by certain characters such as opposition to affirmative action/ welfare is just a few steps away from stomping on someone's head. That is the totalitarian tendency of political correctness. American History X wallows in the most pretentious political correctness ever put on film.

B0000A1RJI|5.0|My God. I saw this movie the day after it came out, and loved it and the music so much that when i went to Quebec, i went and saw it in French. The music just does such a wonderful job of complimenting the scenes, and when i saw the cd in the store, i snapped it up right away. It's as close as you can get to the movie without actually having it. <BR>Some movies, the music is much better than the actual film, but this soundtrack does such a wonderful job of weaving itself throughout the film that if you've seen it already, it'll come back to life right away.<BR>Even if you haven't seen the movie, you'll want to pick up this cd. It's got great life, from celtic sounds, to a big swashbuckeling theme that picks you up off your feet and races you into the world of pirates in the caribbean.
B000021YQV|5.0|First of all, I don't know why anybody that likes System of a Down would not own this CD. Some fans argue that this is not as good as their self-titled debut album, but I have to disagree. Every single song on here is good, and most of the songs are downright excellent. This is a CD that you can listen to all of the way through. Here is my breakdown of the songs:<br />1. Pison Song (Very Good) - One of the three songs on the CD where you can actually figure out the messsage of the song. Plus, the opening few seconds are truely excellent. <BR>2. Needles (Good) - A song that gets kind of old after a while. However the middle part of the song deviates from the main theme and is very good.<BR>3. Deer Dance (Very Good) - Another song with a political message. Fast paced and full of energy.<BR>4. Jet Pilot (Average) - A short song that would be very good if the band expanded on it. <BR>5. X (Average) - My least favorite song on the CD. The rythem is never very steady and the song is not very melodic.<BR>6. Chop Suey! (Excellent) - Even though it was played on the radio a lot, it still remains one of the best songs ever written by SOAD.<BR>7. Bounce (Good) - A very funny song. It sounds like something that the band had played as a joke once and decided to clean it up and put it on a CD.<BR>8. Forest (Excellent) - The song is a very energy-filled, driven song that has a very melodic chorus.<BR>9. ATWA (Excellent) - A song that grows in intensity as it goes on. One of the best on the CD.<BR>10. Science (Excellent) - The last song with a political message. The song rocks the entire way through and never slows down.<BR>11. Shimmy (Good) - Not very melodic, but sort of similar to their sound on their last album.<BR>12. Toxicity (Excellent) - You've heard it on the radio. You know what I'm talking about.<BR>13. Psycho (Excellent) - A lyrically short song with a long (for SOAD) instrumental at the end.<BR>14. Aerials (Best song on the CD) - SOAD saved their best for last. A greatsong to sing along to in your car and a great melody and rythem. Plus, it has an awesome bonus track at the end (think tribal.)<br />The bottom line is, anybody that likes hard rock should but this CD.
B000002H97|5.0|This is for all you people who think Metallica are sellouts. Just because the music changes-doesn't mean they're sellouts. Every band changes their sound at one point. But for some reason, Metallica takes all of sh*t for it. This album remains one of the standouts of all time. As metallica remains one of the best bands ever. <br />The album kicks some seriuos ass from start to finish. Every song is just a pure classic. I challenge anyone in their right mind to say they dislike it.<br />Track By Track Guide:<br />1.Enter Sandman 9/10 A   Let's face it-it's overated. Not the best on the album by a long shot, but you CAN'T dis this song. Remains the second most popular riff of all time.<br />2.Sad But True 10/10 A+  One of the bands best songs. Every member of the band is at their best here. Soem of the best and most symbolic lyrics James ever wrote.<br />3.Holier Than Thou 9/10 A   Too underated. This is the bands head on attack on the media and tabloids. GO METALLICA!<br />4.The Unforgiven 9.5/10  A+ One of the only songs on the album that gets the respect it deserves. Great and memorable chorus. <br />5.Wherever I May Roam 10/10 A+++  Awesome!!! Maybe the MOST underated song on the album. Everything here is perfect, Almost 7 mins long too!!!<br />6.Don't Tread On Me 9/10 A-   The worst track at this point. But it's still awesome. FAR from bad. <br />7.Through The Never 8.5/10 B+  The new worst track on the album. Still, IT'S EXTREMELY FAR FROM BAD!!!<br />8.Nothing Else Matters 100/10 A++++  The second best song EVER MADE. GREAT. NOTHING MORE TO SAY ABOUT IT. Metallica tries to make a power ballad and succeeds!!! If they only made more like this one...<br />9.Of Wolf And Man 9/10 A   An underated classic as well. <br />10.The God That Failed 8/10 B-  The worst song on the album.<br />11.My Friend of Misery 8.5/10 B  Another worst song on album. But it's hard to use that term with this album.<br />12.The Struggle Within 9/10 A   The most thrashy sogn on the album. Very Raw.<br />SO: anybody who thinks Metallica are trendy sellouts-this album takes a Sh*t all over you.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This soundtrack is awsome.  I can't even explain it's not the typical soundtrack thats super slow, this one just keeps going and the melodies are just stuck in your head.  I wanna listen to it over and over.
B00008G9JM|5.0|I got this album about 2 months ago (I am just now building my music collection) and of all my Jethro Tull cd's (including Thick as a Brick and Aqualung) this is my favourite. At first listening I was (to say the least) disapointed as I hated it and thought I had waisted my money, but I came over here and read some reviews and desided to give it a second chance this time the session went much better and I started to see potential. Today after at least 25 listens I am still stuck!<br />The story of the hair who lost his spectacles isn't a big problem (I usually just fast forward through it) although it could have been made into a seperate track...<br />The sound quality of the CD is very good and though I haven't listened to the previous productions I think it is very well done.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I went to Godsmack's show when they were on their tour promoting &quot;Faceless.&quot; I had never been a big Godsmack fan, but I decided to check them out anyway. They played almost every single song on the CD and the next day I ran out and bought it. This is one of the few albums out there that you can stick in your CD player and listen to all of the way through. The best songs on the CD are &quot;Straight Out of Line&quot;, &quot;Faceless&quot;, &quot;Changes&quot;, &quot;Re-Align&quot;, and &quot;Releasing the Demons&quot;. The band's new drummer definitely adds a punch that was lacking in some of their earlier music. If you are a longtime Godsmack fan, stop reading this review right now and click the &quot;purchase&quot; button at the top of the page. Even if you are not a huge fan, but you still love hard rock and metal, BUY THIS CD. <br />P.S. If you ever have a chance to see Godsmack in concert, take the opporotunity.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This cd kicks some serious ... from start to finsih. Every track on here is a killer.It's a shame it's onlt 10 songs. With another track or two-it could have been the best cd ever made. The addition of orchestra into the equasion made it evem better. This disk contains some of the best music ever written. It's obvious at points that Bruce's voice has aged in years-but it's still awesome. You can't deny the fact that you love this cd. If you don't, you're insane. <BR>Track By Track Guide<br />1.Wicker Man 9.5/10 A+  Fast and Heavy-everything a song should be. A great opener with a super-catchy chorus.<br />2.Ghost of the Navigator 10/10 A+ Another awesome track. The build up is great. When it kicks into gear-it kicks ...<br />3.Brave New World 9.5/10 A   Great song. Period. It takes a while to get going, but when it does, it REALLY takes off.<br />4.Blood Brothers 10/10 A++++   The best song ever made. PERIOD. This 7:15 epic becomes the biggest and best Maiden tune ever. Definately the best on the cd. If they made more songs like this...<br />5.The Mercenary 8.5/10 B+ A very good song, but I just don't compare with the rest of the CD<br />6.Dream of Mirrors 9.5/10 A  Do songs get any longer then this?! Not that I mind. It's a great tune. Awesome and memorable chorus.<br />7.Fallen Angel 9.5/10 A   Another heavy song. It's great-You can't describe it any better.<br />8.The Nomad 10/10 A++   WOW. This song get's better with each listen. The solos are the best parts. The orchestra was the best thing they could have ever done to this song.<br />9.Out of the Silent Planet 10/10 A+   The third best song on the album. Great double bass drums on this track. Just great all around.<br />10.Thin Line Between Love and Hate 9.5/10 A   The only thing I complain about in this song are the lyrics-not a single rhyme. Still a truly mind blowing song.<br />As you can see, CDs don't get much better then this. There are only 2 or 3 albums I rate above this one. Buy it today-It's worth EVERY SINGLE PENNY YOU SPEND ON IT!!!
B00005JLYU|1.0|My parents gave me a free pass they had for this movie, I may never forgive them ! I'm the one people are always asking to lower the volume on his surround system but I couldn't stand the noise coming out of this one.<BR>Bad comedy, god-awful acting, phony / unbelievable special effects, etc. etc. I'd rather not go on....<BR>If you like this movie, don't expect to get to far in high school !
B0000A1RJI|4.0|The music is well composed and full of excitment.  The main theme is played through out the entire CD.  While the theme captures the imagination there is not a lot of varity between the little bit of different music that there actually is, just variations of the theme.  I am just saddened about the repetfullness, but other is wise a wonderful score.
B000002U9W|5.0|The true change from Syd Floyd to Waters/Gilmour Floyd.  A very strange yet enlightening listen.  The title track reminds me of so many groups of the now, I wonder if this 25 minute epic piece influenced their work. (God Speed You! Black Emperor, Phillip Glass, the soundtrack to the Legend of Zelda)  The other 4 tracks hit home as each member branches on their own style and end on a severly avant/psychedelic number.  A must have for fans of epic music or true Floyd fans.
0671027344|4.0|honestly, i probably should give stephen chbosky's the perks of being a wallflower a perfect 5 out of 5; but i generally never give anyone or anything a perfect score. although, it was a great read and on my top two list. the other being all 7 books of clive staples lewis's the chronicles of narnia. picked it up in the library, fell for it and borrowed it. as soon as i got home, i read it all night. liked it so much and told my cousin about it. she enjoyed it too! she related so well to the protagonist and the funny part is that she likes the smiths just as the charcater did. well, she was in high school during that era. the thing about the book is that everyone can relate to its coming-of-age theme. whether it's the smiths that are hot or incubus is the latest thing, everyone has their favorite bands. i also recommend the song \\"asleep\\" by the smiths. sad but beautiful. <br />the perks of being a wallflower has an easy flow making it easy and enjoyable to read. the only low of the perks is that i feel the charcater charlie talks as if he doesn't belong in high school; his speech seems too juvenile and naive. or maybe, i just like to think that high school kids are mature considering i myself am still in high school. but, come on what freshmen doesn't know what masturbation is? i've known it since first grade, but then again that is quite early...<br />anyway, the gist: i recommend it. last comment: there is a bit of charlie in all of us! and don't forget to check out \\"asleep\\" by the smiths. lastly,i apologize for my disarray of thoughts.:)
0688170528|4.0|This is my first Jodi Picoult's book, and it's definitely not going to be the last one. Once you start reading this book, you definitely can't put this book down, you just want to keep reading and know what's going to happen.It's a really sad book. I feel sorry that Christ was the only person with Emily when the gun shout happened, and everyone thinks he is the killer. Because that, he had been through a lot in the jail and also the pain of losing Emily. I's also really heartbroekn that Christ loves Emily so much, but Emily isn't happy in this world! For a teenage couple, the way they love and feel about each other really touched me. Also Jodi Picoult described the entire plot very detaily, especially the testmony and court part ( some people think it's dragging too much, but I personaly didn't feel that way). The reason I can't give this book 5 starts because there are many questions left inside me after I finished reading the book. I didn't get answers from the author and I want them to be answered. I guess Jodi Picoult wants us to use our own imagination. Even though it's a heartbreaking novel,I still strongly recommended this book.
B00000JMQE|4.0|Film editor extraordinaire Walter Murch has only one film to his credit as a director, this one, and it's quite good. Perhaps in another 30 years when most of us have died off and the movie can be viewed without the inevitable comparisons to the more famous Judy Garland vehicle, RETURN TO OZ will be seen in proper perspective, namely an attempt to show L. Frank Baum's creation as he might have done it if HE'D been a movie director instead of a writer.<br />One caveat; For a supposed fairy tale, it IS a slightly darker vision that's shown in this movie than a young child might be comfortable with. There are scenes showing some of the questionable medical practices of the late 19th century which are very scary and I could see 6-year-olds having nightmares about them. There are also the Wheelers, who are at least as frightning as the flying monkeys were in the 1939 WIZARD OF OZ. Jean Marsh, however, is not as scary a wicked witch as Margaret Hamilton was, so that leavens things somewhat. Fairuza Balk, in her first film, makes a very charming Dorothy, and Piper Laurie and Nicol Williamson are well-cast in their supporting roles.<br />The DVD transfer itself leaves something to be desired. The first ten minutes of the film are marred by very apparent dustspecks and scratches on the transferred print; you'd have thought that, budget DVD or not, some care might have been taken in this regard. Extras are few and badly-positioned; there are no scene-selection menues and if you had no prior knowledge that there is a ten-minute interview with Fairuza Balk right after the closing credits, you'd miss it entirely. The sound transfer and mastering, however, is excellent and once you get past that first scratchy ten minutes, everything looks and sounds great.<br />This is a piece of Eighties filmmaking which, hopefully, will get a new lease on life on the big screen after a few more decades roll by. American Film Institute, take note!
B00008LDPU|5.0|A beautiful counterpart to a very well constructed sequel. (Hell, anything is better than Episode 1 or 2) A look into minor happenings of the Matrix world and relevant chapters of the main story at hand.  If you dig the Matrix, or you dig anime, check this out.
0790725657|5.0|&quot;I am a Princess. All girls are. Even if they live in tiny old attics. Even if they live in rags. Even if they aren't pretty, or young, or smart, they're still princesses. All of us! Didn't your father ever tell you that? Didn't he?&quot;<BR>Well no. My Dad didn't call me a princess, and never will. But after seeing this movie, I was really beginning to wish I was. &quot;A Little Princess&quot; is quite simply amazing. It is the most magical family movie there is. I just can't recommend it high enough. I saw this at the movie theater, 7 times and it is quite easily my favorite film of all time.<BR>Set in 1914, &quot;A Little Princess&quot; tells the story of a girl called Sara who goes to a strict boarding school while her father from England goes to fight the War. The school is run by a mean spirited head teacher called Miss Minchin. From the start, Miss Minchin is jealous of Sara who considers herself to be a princess. After all, her Papa has told her that she will always be his little princess. Despite the harshness of Miss Minchin, Sara continues to fill those around her with magic as she tells stories to them of a beautiful princess and her prince. <BR>The emotion begins early in this movie, firstly being when Sara and her Papa say goodbye as he goes into war. Midway through the movie Sara hears that her Papa has been killed in battle. I have to say, when I watched this I was gone. Ok I wasn't gone yet, but I was holding the tears in. Actress Liesel Matthews who plays Sara is so genuine, and director Alfonso Cuaron definitely brings out the best in her. It is at the end which is complimented by the music of Patrick Doyle, that I really did feel a few tears going by my face. It happened just after Sara realized she may truly have lost her father forever.

B000002LJW|3.0|Clapton's abilities as a studio musician shine here, but the album dates itself with 80's clap-track (Anything for Your Love) and the sounds of solid state amplifiers.  Old Love, Pretending, No Alibis, Bad Love and Before you Accuse Me are all cult favorites for Clapton fans.  Lets face it, 461 Ocean Boulevard is his weakest album and it's still awesome.  This album rates better in my book, but not his best effort.  Too much doo-wop girls and over-production, which again shows its ugly head on the albums Pilgrim and Reptile.  Still, Clapton can write and play and somehow manage to put out a good album, regardless of your recording tastes.
6302989787|4.0|Believe it or not, this was the first Clint Eastwood movie I bought and only the second I?ve seen (the first was ?Blood Work?).  So consequently I cannot compare this to a ?Dirty Harry? or any of Eastwood?s older works.  I can however say it was a good movie.  It is at times rather predictable and follows the example of most other cop vs. killer films, but that?s okay.  The acting by Clint and particularly John Malkovich makes up for any lack of originality.  That?s not to say there?s no innovation within ?In The Line Of Fire?.  There certainly is.  Even in their supporting roles, both Rene Russo and Dylan McDermott (aka Will from NBC?s Will & Grace) prove to be at the top of their games.  All in all, if you can get past the conventionalism and the random spots of predictability, you?re bound to enjoy the show.<br />Eastwood plays the role of Frank Horrigan, who?s an older, obnoxious Secret Service agent who, years ago, was unable to prevent JFK from being shot.  So when a ?wet-boy? posses a great threat to the current President, Frank?s past is brought back to light courtesy of the self-proclaimed Booth (played brilliantly by John Malkovich).  Booth is a very scary character.  And it?s not until partway into the movie that we see his face clearly.  He is a smart, flawless exhibitioner who has a profound obsession with President?s deaths.  Most others in the office ignore the threats and leave Frank as though he?s an old fuddy-duddy past his prime.  But Eastwood knows, claiming right from the start: ?I know things about people?.  What Booth does is lead Frank and other agents through a series of set-up clues that keep them close; though not too close.  Because Booth singles out Frank, the two are able to form an excellent on screen double act.  They may not be working together, but they interact with each other just so perfectly.  That aspect of the movie was hands down the best element.  Along with the aforementioned quote, a few others give Eastwood that appeal that would most likely do for this movie what the ?...punk? quote did for ?Dirty Harry?.  And even Malkovich chimes in with a most-memorable quotation: ?all we have is the game?.  And the game continues all the way till the very end, when we see if Eastwood?s instincts were right all along.  Aside from all the great acting and an exalting story, there were a couple of ugly spots in the movie.  The first that comes to mind is the romance scenes between Eastwood and Rene Russo.  The bedroom scene was predominantly unlikable, but Eastwood finished it off with a hilariously unforgettable line.  I won?t spoil it for you.  Also, the special effects were nothing to write home about; a part at the end actually made me laugh.  But in the end, the greatness of the movie outweighs the few poor spots.<br />If you are a Clint Eastwood fan I?m sure you already own this movie.  If you?re a budding Eastwood fan born after his time, I can?t tell you ?In The Line Of Fire? is better than any other Eastwood classics.  But, again, I can tell you it?s worth watching.  The character of Frank Horrigan is played perfectly by Eastwood.  And John Malkovich drops in the best performance of his career as the lofty but likable Booth.  There is not a moment of this movie that?s not entertaining (romance bits excluded), and the thrills just keep on pilling up.  On a more serious note, when you?re watching this movie, it?s frightening to think there?s no one like a Frank Horrigan out there who?d protect the President with such pride.  I picked this up for a buck at the Half-Price Book Store; for that price I couldn?t pass it up.  And I don?t recommend you pass it up either.at would most likely do for this movie what the ?...punk? quote did for ?Dirty Harry?.

0385504209|1.0|I bought the book for a good vacation read, but have read more eloquent prose in trashy romance novels. Do this to see if this book is more than a travel pamphlet for Europe. Go to Chapter 3, read the first paragraph out loud. I was so disappointed. The plot is also very transparent. I was not moved to read any of his other books if this is the sort of mush he serves his readers. Did anyone else realize AT ONCE that the 'language' was actually English written backward? How dumb is Rob, anyway? Save your money.
B000084T18|4.0|50 won't die tryin' to get rich after this album.  16 plus cuts on his latest disc with less than a hand full of sub-par songs makes for a pretty good cd when matched up against some of the music that has been shoveled out of the record industry as of late.  If you listen to the radio EVER or watch MTV you have without a dobut heard the maybe over commercialized: 'In tha Club', '21 ?'s' and the very catchy 'P.I.M.P', however you may have missed 'Patiently waiting' which is a sick and dark mix of lyrical prose and geniues on the part of 50 as well as Shady CEO and MC MASTER Marshall Mathers.  To boot', 'If I Can't' and 'Poor Lil' Rich' continue to make this cd a class act and a solid purchase.  It's no 'Juicy' or 'Blueprint&quot;, but what is now a days?

B000099T2L|4.0|It would be nearly impossible for Beyonce' to make a horrible record.  Her voice is fantastic, mature and well trained.  She is stunningly beautiful and has the attitude of a Diva...not to mention she has aligned herself with some of R&B/Rap's most influencial folk (Jay-Z, Luther Vandross and Sean P Diddy Combs).<br />The star track is Crazy In Love.  With it's catchy horn hook and pumping bass, it's not surprising it went to #1 and is still hanging there.  After that, the first half of the album is very good.  Naughty Girl (great sample of Donna Summer's \\"Love to Love You Baby\\"), Baby Boy (great Mid-Eastern flavor), Be With You and Yes (a surprisingly deep message about teen relationships and sex) are well written and could possibly be candidates for the next single.  The second half of the album, with the exception of The Closer I Get (with Luther Vandross), Dangerously In Love 2 and the hidden track Daddy, is just OK.  I guess if you calculate it out, 10 out of 15 songs are very well done.  <br />The album just falls short of five stars, but it's worth your investment!  I think this album could spawn up to four Top 10s.  We'll just have to see...
B00009V8Z9|5.0|For those who have been tracking DeGraw's path to fame since the beginning, &lt;i&gt;Chariot&lt;/i&gt; lives up to expectations. DeGraw's ability to tap into the listener's deepest emotions with songs such as &quot;Just Friends,&quot; and &quot;[nice to meet you] Anyway,&quot; is a talent that most song-writers are lacking nowadays. In all, &quot;refreshing,&quot; would be one word to describe this man's first album.

B00009V7P8|4.0|One of the things I love most about this album is the use of strings - a cello, mostly, if I'm not mistaken.  It calls to mind Kristen Hersh's &quot;Hips and Makers&quot; and &quot;Grotto&quot; - albums any fan of Damian Rice's album might want to check out.<br />Not only is the music in a similar vein, but Damien Rice's lyrics are on par with Kristen Hersh's as well.  I'm very glad I found this album, as I have not found many albums in this style.<br />Because the style is so much like Kristen Hersh's, I can't give it a 5 yet - but that's also probably because I haven't had the album that long.  I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll do on his next few albums - let's see if he's got some real staying power, the kind that deserves a 5.
B0000042H4|5.0|Tough choice. Nilsson is more passionate and exciting here. Bohm's speed is faster and (in my view) this works better for the opera. I love the \\"live frisson\\". <BR>BUT the Solti is overall better cast. For instance, you miss out Christa Ludwig's incomparable Fricka and waltraute in the Bohm set. You miss Gottlob Frick's stunning potrayal Hunding and Hagen, his voice ringing out gloriously and thrillingly dark. You miss Fischer Dieskau's incredible portrayal of Gunther. You miss out Joan Sutherland's ravishing woodbird. You miss out the most disgusting Mime of Gerbard Stolze - yes, he portrays it in the most odious fashion (I mean in the good sense that he characterizes well). You miss out Kirsten Flagstad's Fricka. You miss out the legendary Hans Hotter.<br />On the other hand, the Solti is missing Leonie Rysanek's thrillingly intense Sieglinde (not that Crespin is bad, Crespin is absolutely ravishing - but Crespin is less intense than Rysanek). The Solti's Walkure is too slow I think. <br />What should I say? Buy BOTH....

B00001OH7T|4.0|The \\"Young Americans\\" album was Bowie's only bona fide homage to Americana, while simultaneously propelling blue-eyed soul back onto the pop charts for the first time since the late sixties. Below is a track-by-track analysis of the album's accomplishments (and weaknesses).<br />The title track is absolutely well written and perfectly captures the timeless essence of pure Americana and its unique nuances. Englishman Bowie had definitely done his homework on this one. Sheer brilliance!<br />\\"Win\\" is beautifully slinky, and dare I say, \\"groovy\\". David Sanborn's vibrant saxophone along with the radiant gospel backing vocals renders this track indispensable. This groove style later resurfaces on Prince's \\"Diamonds and Pearls\\" and Beck's \\"Debra\\".<br />\\"Fascination\\" smoothly segues from \\"Win\\", and again, the soothing saxophone coupled with excellent backing vocals makes this track another album highlight.<br />\\"Right\\" is downright sexy with its Marvin Gaye and Average White Band overtones. Another superb performance by Bowie and his bandmates.<br />\\"Somebody Up There Likes Me\\" is relatively dull and uninspired, especially in Bowie's lackadaisical vocal delivery; however, Sanborn and company save this track from becoming a complete failure.<br />\\"Across the Universe\\" begins as a rather obnoxious tribute, but during the song's chorus-driven outro, you receive the Philly treatment reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen; therefore, Bowie redeems himself somewhat by the track's completion.<br />\\"Can You See Me\\" remains sexy yet boring but not bad, as it integrates well within the album's plastic soul context. Try playing this track right before bed; that's where this track is most essential.<br />While it's the most popular track on the album, the culturally critical \\"Fame\\" actually suffers with time but nevertheless offers a decent finale. This funky track will be later outshined by Station To Station's even funkier \\"Golden Years\\".<br />The Young Americans album exudes greatness (despite its wonderful 1999 remaster) but remains unessential for neophytes (the album's best tracks are available on Best of Bowie. Try beginning with Station To Station, as it's far more accomplished than its predecessor. Young Americans is only essential for completists and fans of this phase of Bowie's rather industrious career.espite its wonderful 1999 remaster) but remains unessential for neophytes (the album's best tracks are available on Best of Bowie.

B000002W35|5.0|Strangely Amazon staff reviews of Elvis albums are littered with mistakes, and this is no exception.<br />'Girl Of My Best Friend; is not a cover - it's a Presley original, written for Elvis by Beverly Frank, a pseudonym of the writer of 'I Beg Of You, Rose Marie McCoy. Donner recorded his vesion only because RCA refused to issue the Presley original as a single. <br />Aside from 'Girl Of My Best Friend', which is perfect 60's pop, the album demonstrates the Presley genius on 'Reconsider Baby', 'Like A Baby', 'Fever' and Such A Night - all covers and all superior to the originals. 'I Will Be Home Again' is a little known masterpiece.  'Make Me Know It and 'The Girl Next Door' don't reach the heights of the other cuts, but this is is one of Elvis' top three albums. Want to hear the greatest blues/R'n'B singer of his generation at his vocal peak - buy this album. Between 1960 and 66 especially, Elvis Presley had the greatest voice in the history of popular music - this is the proof.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Radiohead have done what many bands would have failed at doing.  They have recovered unharmed from OK Computer.  Many bands would have floundered in a musical land of nod after such a masterpiece, not knowing how to follow such an acheivement. Press pressures and expectation would have driven them insane.  Many bands would split, or spend the rest of their carreers wondering how to make music again. <br />Kid A, was a difficult album to say the least...people hated it at first...they hated it later.  By producing something so unexpected, something so uncomercial and on a wave length so different to anything and anyone else, Radiohead frees themselves from the OK Computer stranglehold.  People recognised they werent trying to do a OK Computer II, they as it were dropped their trousers to the world.  They put themselves in a position where they were allowed for the rest of their carreers to do whatever they wanted musically!<br />Amnesiac, slightly more commercial carried on the Kid A theme. The two albums alienated a lot of fans, fans that missed the point.  These fans were a small price to pay for the fact that Radiohead could now carry on their carreers!<br />Early immature Radiohead.....acclaimed rocky guitar Radiohead....experimental genious Radiohead....Kid A/Amnesiac Radiohead......all this was now in the bands past.<br />Hail to the thief sounds like a band at the height of relaxation and confidence.  They have acheived everthing...and more in their carreers so they produce and album like Hail to the theif.  Go to sleep sounds like Pablo Honey, 2+2=5 sounds like The Bends, Scatterbrain sounds like OK Computer and the rest have elements of KID A/Amnesiac. <br />The album therefore is an overview of this bands carreer...and its pretty good too!  Trouble is, where do they go now? Another thing that gets me is that a lot of Radiohead songs sound interesting and different soley because of Tom Yorkes voice rather than the actual music...any other person singing andit would bne average...but maybe this isnt a bad thing. Lets hope overfamiliarity wont breed contempt.
B00000K0DQ|4.0|&quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; is a drama that analyzes the death penalty from two angles: the perspective of the accused, and the perspective of the families of the victims affected by the loss of a beloved one. The movie stars Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon, both nominated to the Academy Awards for this movie (Sarandon won the best actress award), also the director Tim Robbins (Susan Sarandon's husband) was nominated.      Through &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;, Sister Helen (Susan Sarandon) tries to save Matthew Poncelot's life (Sean Penn), but every day that passes seems more difficult to achieve it, so eventually she invites Matthew to search for his inner peace and to regret for his crimes. The movie shows the pain provoked to the families of the victims, as well as the pain inflicted to Matthew's family.      &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; doesn't try to say if the death penalty is right or wrong, its only intention is to present the consequences of that penalty. An interesting drama with very good performances, particularly the Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon performances.
1567400957|4.0|I've only read the first two books in this series, and obviously the author was still finding his way a little as he was writing these first few books...but they were still great. I am very excited about the rest of the series. They seem to just get better, so far anyway. Harry Bosch is a dynamic character. And I enjoy anything with suspense, and a homocide cop's life is certainly on the edge! If you like James Patterson, Michael Connelly is surely great competition!
B00003CXD5|5.0|&quot;The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre&quot; is a great classic. Directed by John Huston and featuring stellar performances by Humphrey Bogart, Tim Holt and Walter Huston, this is a must-see movie for movie aficionados.      Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) and Curtin (Tim Holt) are a couple of drifters living in Tampico, Mexico; one day, they collect a delayed payment, and both decide to search for gold on the Sierra Madre, with the companion of wise old man Howard (Walter Huston); they actually found a lot of gold on the mountains, but also they are going to find greed, lots of dangers, like a bunch of thieves, and the paranoia will make them a final and ironic joke.      &quot;The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre&quot; earned Academy Awards for the Hustons, both father (Walter, actor) and son (John, director) and deservedly so. The movie hasn't aged a bit, because the subjects that the story introduces will remain as long as the humanity exists. A very recommendable movie.
0142004235|5.0|Yes, it took Oprah to get me reading a \\"classic\\". I have always been meaning to, but when she brought back her book club, that was it. I know this book has gotten very mixed reviews over the years, as well as the author himself. It seems you either love Steinbeck or hate him. After reading East of Eden, I love him. I am a big fan of the good vs. evil, so this book was right up my alley. I enjoyed pretty much everything about it. I liked the characters, the suspense, the story and the way it was written (so very easy to read- I didn't have to pull out my dictionary once!). Don't get me wrong, it's not impeccable, but it is a great read. To anyone who is thinking about starting to read \\"classics\\"- this might be a great one to start with!
1582432678|1.0|I generally cannot stand books written as letters. (An exception is Smollet's &quot;Humphrey Clinker&quot;.) Worse, I certainly cannot stand books written largely in the second person. So this will soon be a gift for someone I don't like much...
0440236738|5.0|This was my first book of Coben's, but it won't be my last. I already have Tell No One on my list...<br />I was so very happily surprised when reading this book. It was THAT good. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. I read the book (340 pgs) in 3 days!<br />There were a lot of twists and turns, surprises, suspense, humor, action and emotion. This book really did have it all. It has honestly been a long time since I read a &quot;mystery&quot; book that was THIS good.
B00000B9N3|5.0|This is one of the cleverest and most endearing recordings I have ever heard. All my life I have heard about composers hearing and reacting (usually negatively) to popular renditions of their music - especially Verdi, frequently performed by gondoliers. This is the only opportunity I have had to savor what that might really have sounded like - at its highest level, of course. Anyone who knows and loves Wagner will be tickled to death by this and hopefully inspired to investigate other music by Uri Caine and his collaborators. Check out &quot;The Sidewalks of New York.&quot; This guy understands music as artifact in the truest sense. Did you ever look at an ancient portrait and get that creepy feeling that people in the 15th or the 10th Century or even in ancient Egypt were not that different from us? That is the effect that Uri Caine's music has. Dig him.
B00005JLTN|4.0|This was a great movie.  A worthy sequal, It was what i was expecting out of the sequal. If you do not pay attention then you will get lost very fast. It has a lot of action yes, but then again it is an scifi action movie.  After all people seem to forget that the matrix is not a real world, but one where  anything is possibile. The plot makes you think, just like the first one, and for some people it may require a litlle to much thinking. If you liked the first one for more reasons then just the bullet time then you will like this one as well.  The DVD gets only 4 starts because it looks to lack deleted scenes and such just like the 1st one.

I will admit that sometimes it results<BR>in (mostly Jim's) self-indulgence. But the band was always willing to walk out to edge and look over and see what could be.<BR>    A great album!

B000000OUE|5.0|This is, quite simply, the best album that I've ever heard.  It honestly does not get any better than this.  White Zombie, even though they only have 3 major-label album, are my favorite band.  The music is simple, but yet is it deep and complex.  Rob Zombie's singing is out of this world.  While there are no bad songs on this album, my favorites would have to be \\"Electric Head Pt. 2\\" and \\"Blur the Technicolor\\".  It you are not very familiar with White Zombie, then the only song you will recognize is \\"More Human than Human\\", which has been featured in a few movies and is a moderately played radio song.  The only thing that I don't like about White Zombie is the nonsensical lyrics, which are just rants about devils, creatures from the beyond, and sex.  But since it is often hard to understand what is being said, this isn't too much of a problem.  Please, go out and make the world a better place, and buy this album.
006092988X|5.0|So glad i started reading classics like this. Its about a little girl who grows up poor but she has reading to sustain her and help her get through the hardships of her daily living. This book will take you through a wide range of emotions and its worth every bit. This is absolutely one of the top 10 American books of all time!
6301486269|5.0|Some of my earliest memories include checking these \\"Ramona\\" videos out at the library and watching them at home with my sisters. Even today, the library still has them and can hardly keep them on the shelf, and rightly so--because they are wonderful follow-ups to the books, and the casting of the Quimby family is perfect (Sarah Polley is quite possibly everything you ever visualized in Ramona when you read the books). Closely and effectively laced with the innocence of Beverly Cleary's books, these are great videos for youngsters to enjoy as they read the stories--and possibly even more enjoyable for those of us who grew up with Ramona. They are basically just very simple and innocent videos that capture it all with the world of Ramona Quimby and her family. It is too bad that they are so difficult to find (mostly they can just be found at libraries). I would love to have these on video and hope that they are re-released sometime in the future.<br />In the meantime....if you have kids, Ramona is one character that you will most definitely want to introduce them to--first with the books, and then continuing through this charming set of ten videos. The cast really gets the job done and produces something wonderful that can be treasured by anyone who loves Ramona.
B000002UB6|3.0|I bought this CD for one reason-the version of &quot;Let It Be&quot; that only seems to appear on this album.  Specifially, the guitar solo is what I paid for.  It is one of my favorites of George's.  The tone is beautiful and the phrasing is very elegant while still having a few juicy dissonances.  The solo on all of the &quot;greatest hits&quot; packages and many radio broadcasts has some horrible chorus type tone rather than this crunchy distortion.<br />&quot;Two of Us&quot; is a great tune that is really incredible since John and Paul were at each other's throats so much yet still turned out something this beautiful.<br />Lots of duds on this one though.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is amazing.  It was nice to hear a real rock group with a fantastic female lead singer, but my attachment soon went deeper when I realized that the lyrics are powerful and emotional, the music is perfectly executed and mixed, and that this is one of the best bands I have heard in a long time.  I found myself crying because I could relate to some of the songs so well.  I am glad to see a great CD like this one scaling the charts, which are usually dominated by junk.  I will be eagerly awaiting the next release, waiting for more emotion and great vocals.
B0000A36J5|5.0|First I'd like to say that this was an absolutely INCREDIBLE movie.  Then to rebut some of the criticism of it:<BR>  Someone said that they didn't like the Arwen expansion in FotR because they weren't a Liv Tyler fan.  WHAT!  Are you crazy.  She's absolutely gorgeous.  (Almost as pretty as Legolas!)  True, it's a deviation from the book, but I found it acceptable.<BR>  The elves going to Helms Deep, also a deviation, was acceptable, and to counter what someone said previously, the \\"Last Alliance between Elves & Men\\" did not mean that they would never ally again, it meant it was their last chance to rebel against Sauron, since he was about to complete his domination of Middle Earth, and basically reduce them to thralldom.<BR>  Aragorn falling off the cliff I found a bit more disturbing, not because it was that bad, but just because I saw no point to it, and unless you have a good reason, why change such a great story.<BR>  The changes I STRONGLY objected to were:<BR>1) Faramir taking the Hobbits/Ring to Osgiliath.  MAJOR change from the book.  Faramir was the more learned brother, while Boromir was more like his father (brash fighter).  Faramir trusted in Gandalf's wisdom, and he did NOT hinder the Hobbits from their task.  HUGE change in character, for which I see no acceptable reason.<BR>2) Gandalf did NOT pave the way for the Hobbits with the Ents.  Gandalf considered getting the Ents help extremely important, but he didn't have time to do everything himself.  He knew Merry & Pippin were in Fangorn and with the Ents.  A big part of the LOTR story is the major part that these small people the hobbits are able to play in the world.  Gandalf is the first to see this, and he trusts them to get the Ents involved.  I hope that Merry & Pippin's contributions are not reduced in ROTK.  I am also curious to find out if \\"The Scouring of the Shire\\" is kept in the movie.  I kind of expect it to disapear, which would be a shame.<br />Great things I'm suprised more people aren'tmentioning:<BR>1) Gollum's argument!  (The audience, myself included, positively GASPED at this scene.)  INCREDIBLE!<BR>2) Legolas' horse mount -> WAY COOL!<BR>3) Legolas' shield ride -> Wish I could do that!<BR>4) Winged Nazgul -> excellent job.<BR>5) Helm's Deep Siege (especially when all the ladders raise up).<BR>6) Gandalf's fall into the chasm/battle with the Balrog. (Can't wait to watch this in slow motion.  I hope the detail is clear in slow motion.)<br />One thing that I was a bit disapointed with was the filming at King Theoden's home (can't remember the name of the city), the camera was just whizzing around like crazy when they first got there.  I found it a bit disorienting.<br />Despite the 2 changes that I didn't like, THIS WAS AN ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE FILM.  Yes, it is different that FOTR, but so is the book.  The 3 books all have a different flavor to them, even though they were originally meant to be one BIG book.

0066620996|4.0|Exactly what is it that makes one company stand out among others as a symbol of effective and efficient management? What factors are the most critical to long term success? Why do some companies seem to succeed so easily while others can barely keep their heads above water?<br />In \\"Good to Great\\", author Jim Collins and his team of research specialists attempt to answer these and other questions about corporate management. These individuals conducted hundreds of interviews and gathered together thousands of statistics on corporations in all sorts of different industries in order to compile a list of companies that exemplify excellence in corporate management.<br />The companies that are highlighted in this book earned their coveted rating based on their ability to outperform companies in similar industries after first undergoing a period of turmoil. The eleven \\"superstar\\" companies are: Abbott, Circuit City, Fannie Mae, Gillette, Kimberly Clark, Kroger, Nucor, Phillip Morris, Pitney Bowes, Walgreens, and Wells Fargo. In each instance, these companies experienced a period of time where growth and financial prospects looked bleak. Then, they responded with expert planning and a sound managerial vision and came back stronger than ever before.<br />Besides these 11 success stories, Collins also highlights some companies who failed to respond quickly enough to market changes and ended up in the trash heap of corporate history. An example here is the grocery chain A&P. This once successful company was reduced to nothing and eventually closed its doors for good because its management team refused to recognize the need to change and adapt to new market conditions and management changes. Had it responded more quickly and embraced change, A&P might still be among the largest U.S. companies. But its management failed to adapt, and it went bankrupt.<br />This is a very good management book overall, and its data is backed up by concrete figures. What you get in this book are the cold hard facts, not merely the opinions of the author. Collins doesn't just ramble on about his own personal feelings on management and why he thinks one company is better than the others. He lets the track record speak for itself.<br />Author Jim Collins and his team deserve a lot of credit for writing this insightful, well- researched book about corporate management. It would have been nice if he had expanded his writing to include more than just these 11 \\"superstar\\" companies. Still, \\"Good to Great\\" is one of the better management books that I have read in the past several years. It provides valuable insight into what works and what doesn't work in the world of corporate management.e cold hard facts, not merely the opinions of the author.

B00008S2VG|1.0|As a Madonna fan, especially of her last two albums, I was highly anticipating this album.  However, I found the cultural criticism misplaced -- the implication that America is far too materialistic is hypocritical when she urges us to buy her album -- not download free mp3's from her CD.  Some songs, such as American Life, are occasionally interesting, but, somehow, such as in her 'rap' or being Madonna &quot;unplugged&quot; in several underwhelming acoustic numbers, she embarrasses herself.  The reasons why this album is inadequate are not so clear; whether the lyrics are faulty, the music is less than perfect, or Madonna has simply lived so long outside the everyday world of most people she can no longer relate (evidenced by her &quot;three nannies and a chef&quot;, etc.) are all viable culprits.  Unfortunately, unlike the sonic vistas she took us to in &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and &quot;Music&quot;, this album is not nearly as beautiful or as interesting.
B000050XEI|3.0|I love Enya, she's one of my favorite artist.  I have all of her CD's, including this one.  I love this album, but it's too short; it's not even 35 minutes long.  Plus there's only 11 tracks.  Plus, most of the songs on here are short, barely 3 minutes long.  Don't get me wrong, I love Enya, I also like every song on this album, I'm just disappointed at the length of it; she could have put a few more tracks on here.  I'd buy an Enya album any day, short or long.  I can listen to her all day...I can't wait until her next one.
0312117337|5.0|Never before has a tarot deck so totally touched me and brought me insights into my own life. I have always used tarot as a way to better understand myself and my own life and to help others understand where they are at and where they are going. This deck has been purely magical in the way in which it gets at the spiritual principles that impact our lives -- I have been able to view life with a whole new perspective.  The images are gorgeous and the book that comes with it is full of amazing insights and thoughtful commentary on potential meaning of the cards.  I own over 10 tarot decks and this the one I keep coming back to over again.  I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to better understand themselves!
B000002UAU|4.0|Mostly every review I've read was dissing George's song &quot;Within You Without You.  Lighten up, it's not that bad of a song, I like it, &amp; it's not that long neither, I've heard songs longer then that, &amp; they're not bad.  I wish George wrote some more tracks for this album, he's not a bad writer at all.  I just got this album, &amp; it's really nice.<br />I like mostly every track on this album; I think the song &quot;With A Little Help From My Friends&quot; is so cute, I can play that song over &amp; over again, it's a happy song.  I also like the title track; &amp; &quot;Getting Better&quot;.  &quot;She's Leaving Home&quot;, is a nice song too.  Overall, this album is very well done.

B00003CXIP|5.0|In short - this movie is a must have for any and every River Phoenix fan! His character (Chris Chambers) reflects the long-forgotten myth we've all experienced at one point in our lives called a 'child's innocense', and his portrayal of accepting neglect, rejection, prejudice, and ultimate fate at such a young age, would drive any person to think twice the next time they thought of judging a troubled 'kid'. Even if you don't like or know River Phoenix, I highly recommend this movie to any adult/young adult with that lingering 'big kid' inside of em'! Two thumbs up, and six stars - 5 for the movie, and 1 special one for River:) (Rest in Peace)...
B000092ZYX|5.0|I agree with another reviewer about the first song of a CD being critical to how the rest of the CD is going to be. Track #1 does show the band's diversity in that it is a little bit rock, a little punk, and of course a little trippy. Now track #2 is one of my favorites on the CD. Not much lyrically, but who cares. This is classic Radiohead, meaning that they are the best at climactic rock. That's what they do! Build you up little by little and eventually hit you with this array of sounds and guitars mixed that just seem to make sense. I only have 1000 words here, so in closing, buy the CD and listen to it very loudly with headphones!!!
B00005JLT5|5.0|The movie pulls you in and takes you for a ride.  It is an emotional roller coaster, taking you from one end of the spectrum to the other.  The heroism and pettiness of the characters is truly moving. Like a car crash, it is hard to look but concern over the people makes you want to see the outcome.  This movie is not your Hollywood version of the Holocaust or WWII.  It shows the true horrors of German occupation in ghastly detail, from start to finish.  I was astounded by the historical detail of this film.  This is a great movie that I would not miss.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|All I can say is WOW! I have seen this movie twice since it came out and plan on seeing it at least once more in theaters. There is just this element that the music in the movie adds to the suspense, the drama, the romance, the piracy, everything! It totally makes this movie what it is. It's compelling and dramatic one moment, and then the next it's soft and sweet. It describes epic battles between good and evil without saying a single word. Everytime that I've seen the movie, I've hummed the celtic theme for days afterwards. The music is absolutely wonderful and this is definatly THE hottest soundtrack of the summer. You'll be missing out if you don't get this one!
B000001EHS|4.0|Def Leppard's Greatest Hits is a good CD.  They did not miss one of my favorite Def Leppard songs.  It is the same music from the eighties but the CD sound quality is excellent.

B000002NE4|3.0|Very good album. I'm not a Nick Cave fanatic, I don't listen to him all the time, I don't own all the albums.  I'm here just as someone who loves music, knows Nick Cave without being a &quot;follower&quot; to say this is really quite wonderful.  Some songs lovely, all unique - a love song in Nick Cave's hands is a love song in no other's.  If the slow quality, the sound of his voice, and his style of lyric is something you'd like - you'll love it.  If you want the younger Nick Cave or faster music or &quot;murder ballads,&quot; this isn't the one.
0316096199|5.0|I would never have imagined that I would say that a book about rape would be one of my favorite reads but then I read Lucky.  It is brutally honest, raw, graphic - my first instinct was that I wanted to slam it shut. However, Alice Sebold's writing style makes you eager to turn the next page.  This is an amazing story.  While the content is sometimes difficult - whatever you may have thought you could imagine about the act of rape is, I assure you, nothing like what you'll discover in this book - I highly recommend that you buy this book.
B00005RDCA|5.0|SURREALISTIC PILLOW (1967) is Jefferson Airplane's second album, and the first with Grace Slick and Spencer Dryden.  It is a masterpiece--an ideal blend of the group's prior folksiness and the wild psychedelia that would eventually dominate their live shows.  Marty Balin was still a force here, but Grace immediately made her presence known with two stellar songs that became virtual anthems of the late 60s: &quot;Somebody To Love&quot; and &quot;White Rabbit&quot; (as if I needed to mention the titles).<br />&quot;She Has Funny Cars,&quot; &quot;3/5 Of A Mile In 10 Seconds,&quot; &quot;D.C.B.A.-25&quot; and &quot;Plastic Fantastic Lover&quot; generate plenty of excitement without being bombastic.  There's a certain (excuse the expression) &quot;groovy&quot; factor that permeates the songs.  They are lively, mystical, sophisticated and genial--filled with discovery and the group's subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) arrogant swagger.  &quot;Today,&quot; &quot;Comin' Back To Me&quot; and &quot;How Do You Feel&quot; are three of the most beautifully atmospheric songs you are likely to hear, practically bordering on impressionism.  All three will mesmerize and stick with you long afterward.  Intellectualism and childlike innocence, pomposity and humility, exhilaration and sadness, assertive animation and repose--yes, it's all here, actualized to seamless perfection.  This album remains my favorite by the group, though BAXTER'S and BARK follow not far behind.<br />What is progressive?  The word &quot;progressive&quot; infers change.  Many think of progressive as a certain style of rock music.  Groups like King Crimson and Yes were given that label in the early 70s because they were different at the time--they entered new territory.  But once they themselves, and other groups, started to copy the sound, that sound became pigeonholed.  How can we continue to call a style that is not progressing progressive?  To use progressive merely to define a style or sound is really a misuse of the word.  The Airplane was progressive in that they had a new thing going on--and that &quot;thing&quot; had depth.  What sounded like this prior?  During the mid 60s, Jefferson Airplane, The Byrds, The Mamas and Papas, Bob Dylan, Donovan--even Peter, Paul and Mary!--all crossed folk with rock and got pleasingly diverse results. At the time, even the other bands from San Francisco, like The Grateful Dead and Moby Grape (and they had Skip Spence, formerly of the Airplane), did not all sound the same.  These musicians were indeed progressive in a real sense, just as Crimson and Yes were in 1969 and the early 70s.<br />Why do critics often imply that the music from the 60s is immature?  It is not.  Not immature, but youthful--producing that which is colorful and imaginative.  To those of us who love colorful and imaginative music, &quot;dated&quot; is not a quality we associate with the 60s.  Albums like SURREALISTIC PILLOW sound as fresh as ever.  Music from the 60s had soul.  It had life and passion.  Truly great chefs (and there seems to be fewer and fewer of them) have an understanding of why something tastes better than a previous attempt at the same thing.  They refine a dish to taste as splendid as possible, rather than settle for the notion that &quot;it's good enough&quot; after a meager and highly imitative effort.  In the 60s, rock musicians (and many a producer!) had that drive, that passion to produce something of unique splendor--and we hear it throughout this still-glorious, even monumental record.  Consider the fact that records from the late 60s like SURREALISTIC PILLOW, DISRAELI GEARS (Cream), MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (The Beatles), BALL (Iron Butterfly), THEIR SATANIC MAJESTIES REQUEST (The Rolling Stones), BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD AGAIN (Buffalo Springfield) and A GATHERING OF PROMISES (Bubble Puppy) all fall into the general category called psychedelia--but all of them sound staggeringly different!  These musicians were in fact inspired, not immature, not simply imitating what came before, but producing a creative and spirited output--that which has lasting artistic value.  There was once a saying: &quot;Variety is the spice of life.&quot;<br />For me, and for people like me who don't want their music all to sound the same, the Airplane offers lasting enjoyment--great riches, actually.  Most who know and love this band own this already.  SURREALISTIC PILLOW is essential listening for anyone who is even remotely interested in the 60s.  This album still gives me thrills and chills--it is a magnificent work, worthy of all the praise fans can muster!<br />Cheers,<br />Murrayture, not simply imitating what came before, but producing a creative and spirited output--that which has lasting artistic value.

B000059Z8J|5.0|Where to begin? The movie itself is awesome in scope and execution--the photography (specifically the colors), John Williams' epic score, the non-CGI effects, the editing (no tightly shot kung fu battles here), and even the acting are incredible. The overall film blows away most of today's movies. And in case that's not enough for you, the DVD is packed. The picture and sound are outstanding, and the extra documentaries are much deeper than what you get with most DVDs. The only minor drawback of the DVD is the flimsy packaging: it comes in a WB snapper case, and the disc itself is double-sided. Handle with care.
B000002HH2|1.0|I've tried to get into this artist but I cannot.  I would rather listen to 20 hours of someone's fingernails on a chalkboard than what passes for Bjork's voice.  Avoid unless you like to hear your dog howl.
B000002UTO|5.0|This album can please many tastes. From touching melodies to dancing rhythms, everything is there. If you like to dance, just play &quot;I Don't Want Your Love&quot; or &quot;Drug&quot; in the loudest volume; if you want to mourn the dead (less probable) just sit in a corner with a discman and put &quot;Do You Believe In Shame&quot; on. If you don't want to do neither of these, you may still try to feel the hypnotizing charm of &quot;Too Late Marlene&quot;, or appreciate the great ballads &quot;The Edge Of America&quot; (voice and guitar), &quot;Palomino&quot; (quite a lot of experimentalism here) and &quot;Land&quot; (makes you want to sing along). And there's still the swing of the instrumental &quot;Lake Shore Driving&quot; and the odd, broken (but great) beat of &quot;All She Wants Is&quot;. Still not enough? Have fun with the lyrics and choirs of &quot;Big Thing&quot;!<BR>(note: if you like shorter songs, good news - &quot;Interlude One&quot; and &quot;Flute Interlude&quot; last half a minute each.)
B00008LJFO|4.0|Unlike previous Whitesnake compilations, \\"The Silver Anniversary Collection\\" draws from all the groups' albums (as well as serving as a vehicle for David Coverdale's solo career, from which it includes a couple of songs).<br />The balance between latter-day Whitesnake's big-haired late-80s pop metal and the original line-up's much rawer blues-rock sound is not perfect...\\"The Silver Anniversary Collection\\" leans too heavily towards the former, while ignoring early-80s classics like \\"Love Hunter\\" and \\"Trouble\\" from the two similarly-titled albums, \\"Crying In The Rain\\" from \\"Saints & Sinners\\", and \\"Don't Break My Heart Again\\" and \\"Wine, Women And Song\\" from \\"Come An' Get It\\". And \\"Fool For Your Loving\\" and \\"Here I Go Again\\" are included in their hair-metal guises rather than the original (and much better) versions.<br />But there is still a lot of good stuff here, including the early cuts \\"Love To Keep You Warm\\", \\"Walking In The Shadow Of The Blues\\", \\"Ready An' Willing\\", \\"Blindman\\", and Bobby 'Blue' Bland's \\"Ain't No Love In The Heart Of The City\\", as well as the new, acoustic track \\"Love Is Blind\\", and the rowdy \\"Guilty Of Love\\" from the \\"Slide It In\\"-album. And the pop-metal stuff wasn't THAT bad, I guess...\\"The Deeper The Love\\" (from 1989's \\"Slip Of The Tongue\\") is actually pretty good, and not too bothered by synthesizers.<br />All in all, \\"The Silver Anniversary Collection\\" boasts a good blend of blues, rock, metal and ballads...not quite as good as it should have been, but an adequate career overview for the casual fan.
0792151712|5.0|This movie is truly magnificent, showcasing the treacherious maiden voyage of the R.M.S Titanic through the eyes of two young lovers. The acting is well performed, even by teengod Leonardo DiCaprio. The effects are absolutely astounding, especially the ship's descent to the bottom of the Atlantic. It's beautifully directed by James Cameron, and the costumes designs are also perfectly done. Even years after it's release, this movie still leaves one with a sadness and empathy for everyone who suffered that night. It wonderfully pays homage to the passengers of the Titanic and is a work of art that should be cherished always.
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce did her thang on this CD... I thought the songs would be 'pop friendly' and G rated like most of the songs on 'Survivor' but I was wrong! Beyonce shows a different, more sexier side on most of the songs.  She's not afraid to sing in different tones that makes her songs unique... <br />Some people who reviewed the CD didn't like the song she has with Big Boi (from Outkast) because it's a little rock and roll but personally, I think it's one of the best songs on the CD... it's different but yet it's still hip hop & R$B...<br />This CD is one that you can play straight through... <br />I'll be playing this one for a long time... It's gonna be a classic... I just hope that one her second solo CD she can out do this one
B00005QXXO|5.0|...but, Radiohead is amazing live.  After hearing Kid A for the first time, i thought they'd never be able to pull any of it off live.  I was wrong.  The live version of &quot;Idioteque&quot; is, in my opinion, better than the studio version.  Far better.  The live &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; sounds nothing like the studio version from Amnesiac, but is also much better, the keyboard part in that song alone is worth the price of the album.  Topping it all off is the previously unreleased track &quot;True Love Waits&quot;,  a beautiful acoustic guitar/vocal only piece.  If you are into Radiohead at all, buy this, even though its mostly stuff I thought I'd never hear live, Radiohead does it, never ceasing to amaze.
0385504209|1.0|This is one of the worst books I've ever read.  It's not that I'm offended by the anti-Christian sentiments--I agree with that for the most part.<br />The problem for me is the lazy, lazy writing.  Basically Brown has found out about this Holy Grail/Feminine Mystery conspiracy theory, and has decided to write what can barely be called a &quot;novel&quot; to tell everyone about it.<br />The characters are hardly even people, just convenient names and bodies that alternately spew exposition and are baffled by laughably obvious puzzles. Not to mention the tacked-on romance at the end.<br />He also uses the classic technique of the author who can't be bothered to conceal information through plot, e.g. &quot;Then the bishop told the albino something that was so shocking he nearly fell over&quot; or &quot;Langdon wanted to tell Sophie what the Holy Grail really was, but he thought he would wait for a few more chapters to heighten the suspense.&quot;<br />On top of this, the so-called evidence for the theory is ridiculous in the extreme, relying on coincidences such as the appearance of a V-shape in Da Vinci's Last Supper.  I'm sure that all the thousands and thousands of paintings containing a V-shape somewhere in them are just further proof that the supressed Goddess Myth is just lurking there under the surface...
B00006LLNU|5.0|Thats all I have to say.  Buy this CD and listen to the whole thing, but pay close attention to track 8.  I believe its the most beautiful song I have ever heard.  The whole CD is incredible, but track 8 is worth the price of 50 CDs.
B000092ZYX|1.0|The album title Hail to the Thief and mixed-up but slanted politic message throughout make this album a huge mistake.  Why must whiney musicians insist on weighing in on issues and causes they know little about; please stick to making music.  I enjoyed prior albums and respect bands creativity but would be better off without this album.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|This DVD helps to sum up Chers Fabulous Career. Cher is a Spectaculor Entertainer and a awesome People Person.  This DVD of Chers Farewell Tour will help us all remember this legend. If you had a chance to go to a Cher Concert BUY THIS DVD, as a souvenir it sure will get a lot of play in your home! If you could not make it to a Cher Concert invest in this DVD as it gives all the Thrills of the Concert EVEN the crowds! Cher ROCKS<br />We will Miss YOU CHER! ROCK ON! As Gene Simmons From Kiss Says , Hope you have another #1 hit this next Decade!
B00005YUTD|5.0|Baby Bach was our first Baby Einstein video, so my son is partial to it.  He is just simply mesmerized by the colorful visuals and the wonderful music.  As for the creator's children appearing in the video, my son loves those parts.  He plays peek-a-boo with the baby in the video and dances along with them.  All-in-all, we have found this video to be a nice early learning tool for our family.
B00008BRB5|5.0|Synchronicity is an excellent album from The Police. It has five songs that got onto the best of that I have, yet I still think it was worth getting it as there is not one mediocre song on it. Yes, and that includes Mother. I really enjoy Mother and I don't know why everyone hates it so much. It reminds me of Pink Floyd and they were a great band right? In conclusion this Cd is worth the money and right up there as the best Cd from the Police.<br />Best Song - Synchronicity II <BR>Worst Song - Mother (but I still like it!)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Having seen all the episodes (including those unaired in the US), I can tell you that if you like science fiction, westerns, underdogs, gorgeous women and great looking guys and incredible writing and acting, this is the show for you. It has lots of humor, lots of drama, and lots of fun all around. You owe it to yourself not to miss this one.
B0000041Q3|5.0|Boy, the operatic heavens must be overjoy to have this classic. I remember the young Pavarotti for his beautifully sung Calaf. And as the definitive Liu, you have none other then the greatest lyric soprano of her era, Monserrat Caballe. But the biggest surprise is the Turandot of La Stupenda. I know that she never sang the role on stage. But what comes out of my speaker is the most powerful, rich, and secure dramatic soprano I've heard from any Turandot, including Marton and Nilsson. <BR>This is an underrated Puccini opera with the most magnificent music and the most difficult vocal writings. But with the team of Sutherland, Pavarotti, Caballe, and Zubin Mehta at the podium, how can you go wrong? OH, and before I forget, this Turandot also has the best stereophonic sound that even rivals some of my audiophile demonstration recordings.<BR>The essential Turandot, in my opinion. No real opera collection should be without it.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Well, get ready to play it again and again.  From the progressive Immigrant Song to some very interesting and revealing interviews, this product rocks.  Page can play and Plant can perform.
B00009ATIX|1.0|So outspoken politically, I think he should stick to politics because I will never buy anything that has to do with him again.
034544678X|5.0|Although most of the important ideas in this book are simple and obvious once they are pointed out and illustrated it's still a great book for the average dog owner.  I found it a quick read that I kept wanting to come back to.  The writing is not as great as James Herriot, but it's not a work of fiction.  It's a nice, easy to read study of dog behavior, by someone who is trained to study them as a scientist.  There are 15 pages of references about dog and animal behavior in the back to further your studies.  Highly recommended for those interested in knowing the dog's perspective.  Not recommended as a training manual necessarily.
B000002KBD|5.0|Still in his prime form, this album offers the full spectrum of what Van Morrison can be.  From his moody, somewhat meloncholy \\"I'll Be Your Lover,\\" to his well known \\"Domino,\\" and in between the down-to-earth, sexy,  \\"I've Been Working,\\" this album encompasses a spectrum most of his others do not, in that it is a transition including musical mysticism, blues, and pop (not a criticism but a complement). As a lover of his live bootlegs I find this to be one of the most satisfying studeo albums Van Morrison ever produced - period.
0385504209|5.0|From the first chapter, I could not put the book down.  Great pacing with the plot and characters, as well as some interesting analysis regarding historical figures, paintings and sculptures.  Subject matter is a wonderful springboard for great debates/discussions with friends who have also read the book. Wonderful read.
B000001IQH|5.0|Maxwell Murder 10/10: Great bass on this track and good Lars to Tim crossovers. One of my favorite Rancid songs.<BR>11th Hour 6/10: Sorry, not a good song, horrible lyrics in the chorus.<BR>Roots Radicals 9/10: Catchy- fast song with a cleaner sound then most of their songs.<BR>Time Bomb 8/10: I'd give this a ten if they had a better chorus. This is a Ska like song, but pretty good.<BR>Olympia, WA 6/10: Just don't like it<BR>Lock, Step and Gone 10/10: Good guitar and fast verses. <BR>Junky Man 8/10: Don't know what the lyrics mean but what the hell, it's a goood song.<BR>M.I.A. 7/10: Don't like it very much.<BR>Ruby Soho 7/10: Or this one<BR>Daly City Train 7/10: Or this one, but a good one if you like reggea.<BR>Journy to the End 10/10: Another of my favorites, good chorus and even better verses. Bass is good too.<BR>She's Automatic 7.5/10: Okay as yu can see I don't like a lot of the tracks on this CD but it's a 19 track CD and the rest are more than enough to make it up.<BR>Old Friend 6/10: A  perfect example, see I dislike this one but...<BR>Disorder and Disarry 10/10: I love this one. Here's a quote \\"Business man come shake my hand. Show me numbers that I understand.\\"<BR>The Wars End 8/10: A good slow song<BR>You Don't Care Nothin' 10/10; I LOVE THIS SONG! Again good Lars to Tim vocal cross overs. Lars does the verses and Tim perfects the chorus.<BR>As Wicked 6/10: Don't like the verses but the chorus is OK.<BR>Avenues and Allyways 8/10: Starts off like a *beepin* blink song! But don't worry, wait 10 seconds and it turns into an Irish drinkin' song...  Well, sorta.<BR>The Way I Feel About You 10/10: Last song on the CD and pretty damn good too.<br />STOP BUSH!
B0000666DW|5.0|This is a must-own for any heavy music fan.  <BR>Elements of maiden, kyuss, sabbath, botch, even a couple straight-up blues licks hiding in the mix.  <BR>The drummer is a monster, but clearly a little too impressed with his own abilities.  Use a little restraint, dude (but only a little!).
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is such a great CD. I love it from start to finish. Some of my favorites are &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;11 AM&quot;, &quot;Are You In?&quot;, &quot;Warning&quot;, and &quot;Mexico&quot;. This CD to me holds the emotions of anger and sadness, but there is a bit of happiness.  The music itself is really good. The songwriting is also so brilliant. I guarantee that you'll love this CD. It is a really good CD. Compared to other Incubus CD's, it's one of the best. This is a purchase I truly recommend. I usually don't listen to this kind of rock music, but this CD is not too harsh sounding or loud. And the best part, you can actually understand the singing, and it's not just a bunch of screaming! I give this CD 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, a perfect 10! This is truly a work of art. ENJOY!
B000089RVX|4.0|I was really surprised by this album.  When I heard of the group by means of their name being mentioned on various TV/radio programs, they didn't seem like anything I would like.  Then, I heard a song on the radio a few days ago and I have to admit that I was intrigued.  I decided to purchase \\"Fallen\\" by Evanescence.  And you know what?  I couldn't be happier.  This is an AMAZING album that surprised me with every track.<br />They're by no means metal or hard rock, but they do have a solid rock/industrial sound to them.  They kind of remind me of Stabbing Westward in some ways.  The lead singer has a fantastic voice and the different kinds of instruments used throughout the album really make the album great.  I especially love how the songs were written.  The album is short, but it doesn't overstay its welcome, which is a big plus in my book (although one or two extra songs wouldn't had hurt the album).<br />Some may think this is a pop band.  I happen to disagree.  The reason for this is that I find pop to have wishy-washy lyrics along with an upbeat tone.  There is nothing upbeat about \\"Fallen.\\"  The songs are haunting, sad, and they even contain lyrics that can be perceived as dark.  And, REAL instruments are being used.  So that's what separates them from the pop bands to me.<br />I really enjoy all of the songs, but my favorites are \\"going under,\\" \\"bring me to life,\\" \\"my immortal,\\" \\"haunted,\\" \\"everybody's fool,\\" and \\"tourniquet.\\"  These are the ones I enjoy listening to the most.  Even though those are my favorites, I still like the rest as well.<br />\\"Fallen\\" by Evanescence is a surprising and impressive album with many great qualities to it.  The songs are excellent, the singing is superb, and the overall feel of the album is exciting and involving.  If you're looking for a good listen, be sure to check this album out.  You may be surprised, just as I was.
0060254920|5.0|I read this book to youngsters touring the bookstore I was working in years ago. When my boys were born last summer, I made sure that there was a copy of this book in their first books collection. This is a classic!<br />The boys love the colorful pictures that is masterfully drawn ~~ so does their mother. It makes reading a lot more fun and entertaining especially for repetitionous books! They love the story line of a little boy being sent to bed without supper ~~ and how he manages to travel to where the wild things are!<br />It is a creative and imaginative book ~~ one that will delight children of all ages. It is a must-read and a must-have for your personal library. <br />7-25-03
B00005ATQC|1.0|It is a crock and it stinketh.    why?    After Kidman's character has a flirt with some sailor boy, Thomas Malpother III's character decides to do a little flirting of his own and a large chunk of the film follows him as he stumbles from one 'encounter' to another in an attempt to get laid.   He comes close but he can't get lucky.   Not for lack of trying, in fact, if he was to fall into a barrel of nipples, he would come up sucking his thumb.   He gate crashes what looks like the playboy mansion on a viagra promo night and witnesses; well, nothing really apart from unidentifiable people hanging out and doin' the nasty.   Everyone is wearing masks, so identifying anyone is impossible, yet his life is in danger for seeing. . . people in masks partaking in horizontal (and vertical) folkdancing.    Sheesh, for all he knew they all could have been members of Congress.   (they are supposed to be dangerous and important)   Perhaps they all have very identifiable private parts?<br />Anyway, here is wall to wall naked willing women (and men) yet our hero just can't manage to do the deed.    They find out he is not on the guest list and. . .  they give him a stern talking to.       Yarda yarda yarda blah blah blah and he feels really guilty about almost being unfaithful.  The End.
0792839625|1.0|Good Lord, where do I start? <br />I've held out seeing this \\"film\\" because I've seen the Broadway production, as well as a worn-out black and white beta-video version of the original cast, and I'm afraid little was left of the original in this \\"screen version\\". I also have a story in my head told to me by an acting teacher who saw the original production at The Public in NY before it moved to Broadway. He told me he'd seen it with a friend and both walked around the Village, down to the Financial District and then home to 46th Street in silence because they'd been so moved by what they saw.<br />The film version is a good example of what too much success can do to something. As other people have suggested - it might have been better to film the stage version, or better yet make a documentary about the ground breaking \\"work-shopping\\" the show went through in development. It revolutionzed the way plays and musicals were conceived.<br />I don't mean to diminish the talent of any cast member, (well... I could have done without Judy Landers - too obvious a choice, and a little too clumsy a performance, as well as Mr. Boring-Hollywood himself, Michael Douglas) as they all, of course, excellent dancers and singers - I think some were pulled from the Broadway cast. I liked the actress who plays Cassie very much, but I didn't like Michael Douglas, and I really hated the fact that they chose to focus on the \\"Love Story\\" of Zach & Cassie. Get over it! It was an unbalanced relationship! They probably would be at each others throats during the rehearsals for the show Zach is directing, and when the show ends I imagine Cassie saying to Sheila (her new best friend) \\"Thank God THAT'S over! I mean... ZACH! WHAT WAS I THINKING?!\\"<br />Other reviews have captured a lot of things I could say. If you like this film - more power to you, but know if you watch it that it is SO not what the original was. The stage show came at a time when Broadway was in a slump, and some of the themes; homosexuality, sexual experimentation, plastic surgery, etc. were topics that existed but were still were very taboo, and capable of shocking a 70's audience. It had more relevance back then, because it seemed that the dancers' predicament was a metaphor for \\"Broadway\\" itself... what do you do when this is all over? There was still some romance in being a \\"Broadway Dancer\\". Currently Broadway seems to be nothing but revivals and corporate sponsored \\"machine musicals\\" that will make money no matter what.<br />Try to see a touring version, or get the play and read in conjuntion with the original cast recording.
B00005JLO2|4.0|This is a great movie filled with lots of action. It's got a good story. I really liked how they did this movie, And it has become a favorite of mine. Anyone who loves a great epic must see this movie!!
1583762027|4.0|In this small book, Brian Tracy shows you how to overcome procrastination and break down tasks into small steps.  This is a worthwhile book.
B000099T2L|5.0|Despite being the most charissmatic of the group (destiny's child) the hype surrounding the debut solo album is well deserved.  Definitely listenable from beginning to end. Best tracks are: 1,2,3,4,5,6,9,12.  Do Your Thang girl!!!!!
6300182355|4.0|Music by Queen...an over-the-top performance from Max Von Sydow...a pre-James Bond Timothy Dalton...a space babe to die for (Ornella Muti)...the standard hunky (if talentless) leading man (Sam J.Jones) and his damsel in distress (Melody Anderson)...cheesy effects (even the serialized originals with Buster Crabbe looked a bit more \\"realistic\\")...<br />For fans of ulta-camp, one can't fly higher than \\"Flash Gordon\\".<br />You want a film of greater cinematic value, check out the local art house.
B000002JSJ|4.0|A hit-and-run album recorded at a turbulent point in the band's history, it stands up very well. Page in particular is on fire throughout, and it is one funky little outing. As with the Stones' Black and Blue of the same era, there is a lot of sinking into the groove here, and Page's playing on Achilles Last Stand sounds like he's on top of an erupting volcano. No hits, but there weren't meant to be. A true album from a band that was still bursting with energy and musical curiosity.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Fantastic collection of incredible footage from throughout the history of one of the greatest bands to ever walk the face of this earth. If the Beatles were about flawed idealism, the Stones rebellion and raunch, and The Who blind anger, Zeppelin were all about getting themselves and their audiences off in as massive a way as possible, while blazing down musical trails heretofore uncharted. This DVD gets all of it and then some, with brainmelting rock, beautiful acoustic performances from Earl's Court on disc two, and a grand performance from Knebworth that caps off with the most supercharged version of Whole Lotta Love that is worth twice the price of the disc on its own. The extras are phenomenal, don't miss anything shot in black and white, the two segments are stunning. For all the flak they took for their indulgences, this DVD shows four full-grown, unrepentant MEN playing their guts out, and loving it. No one these days has this kind of overwhelming force and skill of musicianship. What a time the 70s must have been, with Zep, The Who, and the Stones (Mick Taylor!) all on the road. For five and a half hours, this seems like it's over before it's begun. A landmark of music DVD, and a model to be followed (Mick, Keith?,come on lads). Zeppelin finally gets its due, and thank you Page for putting this wonderful monster out. First music to actually physically arouse me in a long time. Growl!

B000099T2L|3.0|How appropriate it is for Knowles to incorporate Donna Summer's \\"Love to Love You, Baby\\" on \\"Naughty Girl\\".  The ubiquitous Miss Knowles is all over the map like Summer was during HER 70's heyday.  Perhaps, Summer's is the pattern for which the younger is following.  Not a bad icon to emulate.<br />With that said, it must be noted that \\"Dangerously in Love\\" is not very \\"perilous\\".  It features routine pop/urban fluff with too many guest stars that overshadow Knowles's attempts at independence as a solo artist.  Like so many of her contemporaries, the album's length weighs it down. Ten songs, at most, would have elevated the album a notch or two.<br /><br />The success of this album is, no doubt, driven by the onslaught of the \\"Crazy in Love\\" video.  The song, by itself, is lyrically unintelligible but it does boast a killer dance beat.<br />If Knowles really wants to impress, she needs to do a few more like the tasty \\"Speechless\\", the strongest track on the album, or a duet on the caliber of her pairing with superstar Luther Vandross (\\"The Closer I Get to You\\").<br />Oh, yeah, food for thought: Summer has an Oscar on her mantle, by the way.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This is, perhaps, the best soundtrack i own.  The music is riveting and I love the transitions from the heroic tunes to the evil, and the love.  It's simply fantastic.  I listen to it every chance I get.  A must buy for anybody that even remotely likes a good musical score.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is a jewel that you will want to view repeatedly and you will see different things in it each time.  Our kids (3-9-yrs) all love it and the adults love it, too.  The story is inspiring for kids.  The artwork is beautiful.  There are funny little things going on off to the side in each scene.  It seems so bizarre the first view but the imaginary world becomes normal and real after that and you get into the story and characters.  Recommended for all ages.
B00003CXC6|5.0|In the first chapter of Burton F. Porter's excellent new book, Philosophy through Fiction and Film, he discusses the problem of obtaining reliable knowledge and he uses Akira Kurosawa's ground breaking film, Rashomon, to illustrate the difficulty of determining the truth value of what we think we see and know.  Professor Porter gives us a careful summary of the film with his thoughtful comments on the challenge of knowing the absolute truth about what we experience.<br />When asked about what he knew for certain, Albert Einstein said that the only thing he could be certain of was the speed of light, and even that was open to question.  Kurosawa and Einstein appear to be in accord and Rashomon is Kurosawa's attempt to show how difficult it is to know the truth of what actually happened, even when an event is viewed by several eyewitnesses.<br />Rashomon is now available on DVD, courtesy of the Criterion Collection of Films, and the black and white print we see on the screen is sharp and clear and the sound is good.  This film does not translate well to the small televison screen.  I sat up close to my 32\\" Panasonic and wished I had a larger TV so that I might be drawn in more completely as a witness to the complex and engaging story.<br />The movie opens at the Rashomon Gate in feudal Japan.  A woodcutter and a priest are sitting patiently waiting for a rainstorm to subside.  Soon another man, a commoner, joins them and the woodcutter begins to share with the two other men his confusion about the facts surrounding a recent rape and murder.  We learn later that the woodcutter is an eyewitness to the crimes, but first he tells us about his experience as he watches intently an investigation/trial.  A judge is listening to a bandit, a woman, and a dead samurai, whose testimony is revealed through a medium, tell the judge their version of the rape and murder.<br />The bandit first tells us he is reponsible for rape of the woman and the death of the samurai.  Next the woman seems to indicate that she might be responsible for the death of the samurai, her husband.  Then the samurai, by means of a medium, indicates that he committed suicide.  Finally, the woodcutter tells us that the bandit is indeed responsible for the murder.  Each of these stories is visually recreated in effective flashbacks.<br />Lest any viewer think this problem is factual and straight forward, all the viewer needs to do is to write out his version of the various stories and then check with what even well respected critics have to say to see that the viewer's version will differ sometimes signficantly from various professional reviews.  Kurosawa demonstrates convincingly that in the telling of events each viewer is likely to put forward a version that enhances the way that viewer is perceived by others.  This film is about truth and lies and the point made is that the person we are most likely to be untruthful to is ourself.  If we are unable to tell the truth to ourselves, how will we be able to be honest with others?<br />Everthing we see and experience is filtered through the total experience of our lives.  In a world filled with competing stimuli, where do we focus our attention?  We miss more than we see, sometimes even things right under our very noses.  Reality is fabulous, as in this Kurosawa film, but he shows us that it is also as ephemeral as the light passing through the trees in the forest creating shadows everywhere.<br />Rashomon was made for a Japanese audience and was very popular in Japan. In 1951 it was shown at the Venice Film Festival and won the Golden Lion Award.  Since that time it has taken its place among the finest films ever made.<br />It is not without its flaws, chief of which, in my opinion, is the music score, particularly the adaptation of Ravel's Bolero, which distracts the viewer from the events taking place on screen.  Also, at the very end of the film a baby is found at the Rashomon Gate and the woodcutter takes the baby hometo add to his large family.  This plot device to soften the negative impact of the film on the audience and to give hope where little has been experienced weakens the impact of all the events in the story we have just seen.  For a film meant to be shown to a Japanese audience, this \\"Hollywood\\" ending seems out of place and untrue.<br />The greatness of the film is the story it tells and the superb perfomances of all the actors.  I cannot agree with critics who feel that some of the perfomances of the actors, particularly the bandit, were \\"over the top.\\"  This film is a highly visual, almost a throwback to silent pictures.  We learn about the characters from what we see more than from what we hear.  Additionally, the superb camera work is a most important part of the story telling process.<br />Rashomon is a must for students of the cinema and, as was mentioned earlier in this review, for anyone interested in trying to learn the truth value of knowledge.to add to his large family.

0800130952|5.0|Why are all those women married? And why is this film out of print?<br />My homeroom teacher read the book Matilda to us when I was in the fifth grade.  I loved it and we went and saw the movie.  This movie, (based on a great children's novel by the late Roald Dahl) is about a little girl named Matilda Wormwood, who is mistreated by her parents, her brother, and a wicked school principal Miss Trunchbull.  Her father is a used car dealer, and sells used cars that have all been stolen and all have bad transmissions.  One day he sells a car to the Trunchbull and when it breaks down, she sues him for it.  In the end Matilda outsmarts the Trunchbull by using her magical eye powers and writes a somewhat disrespectful message on Miss Honey's blackboard in reference to the Trunchbull.  Trunchbull faints, and after she recovers she quits her job, because they otherwise would have fired her, and is never heard from since.<br />I really wanted to buy this DVD for my cousin as a christmas present.  It's a classic.  You have my order.
6305320802|2.0|This is a great movie but the image quality on this transfer to DVD is just horrible. Now and then the colors are bright and well saturated and the film (print) looks fairly clean but in nearly every other respect the image quality is quite bad. There are many scenes where the image shimmer and flutter and edge artifacts are so bad that the viewing experience is completely ruined. In addition somewhere in the transfer from film they managed to introduce many odd shadows and visual defects that remain fixed on the image for long periods of time (looks like large out of focus pieces of dust in the optical system).<br />This should have been a must have DVD for any fan of musicals. Instead we have something that is very disappointing because of the poor image quality. These comments refer to the CBS/Fox widescreen DVD version that was released in 1999. Ironically, this DVD is marketed with the THX Digitally Mastered label (&quot;Superior Picture Quality&quot; -- NOT!!!).

I am interested in the present and the future. Some people may like history, and some people may like this book but i don't. My quote for this book is &quot;Different strokes for different folks.&quot; Some folks may like this book but if your forced to read it you won't like it at all, i promise. i might have liked it a lot more if i wasn't forced to read it.<br />My Rating for this book is 0/100
6300181685|4.0|Enjoyable disaster film that liberally blends fact with fiction.  In true genre style, there are a host of stereotypes thrown together in a predictable and thinly plotted manner...but the special effects are first rate and cleverly interspersed with actual newsreel footage.  Enjoyable matinee fare.
0142004235|5.0|I reread this book and realized that it is one of my all time favorites.  His use of the language, characters and crises brings together the most powerful personalities and emotions described as only Steinbeck could do it.  Treat yourself to a revisit and you will not be sorry.
B00003CWTI|1.0|The problem I had with Magnolia was that it was a shallow, obvious, and self-indulgent mess of a film disguised as human drama with depth. In every scene there were overdone, overacted long theatrical geriatrics by the actors indicating the hell out the problems they were going through in life. Every single character were just two-dimensional character archetypes holding up a billboard sign stating what their malfunction was in life. It didn't allow the viewers to observe and find out their flaws for themselves. Paul Thomas Anderson did that for us by having his characters be exagerrated archetypes. <br />For all of its labored and amateurishly film-school style offbeat-for-the-sake-of-being-offbeat theatrics, in the end, it was just a movie about tortured souls in Los Angeles seeking forgiveness for their sins and forgiving those who have sinned. There was nothing ambiguous about this film and at three hours, there should have been plenty of ambiguity.<br />PT Anderson also thinks moving the camera all over the place is having visual sense. He doesn't seem to realize camera movements should be done in accordance to what is happening in the story. He makes 25 million dollar budgeted movies that look like a cheaply made 5 million dollar movie that are grotesquely photographed. He has no visual style at all as much as a lot of people seem to be fooled into thinking he does because there's a lot of unecessary camera movements in his movies.<br />Personally, I think Magnolia is down there among the worst films ever made and PT Anderson as one of the biggest phonies to have fooled alot of people in Hollywood.

B00005JLTN|5.0|Words cannot describe the greatness of this sequal. It was not dumbed down to an unintelligent audience - but instead raises the bar in how engaging and entertaining a movie can be. And, if you do not have the brains to follow the plot, or amazing philisophical speeches, than be awed by the amazing effects. Great job Wachowski's, this is one heck of a movie!!!
037542217X|5.0|Reading Alexander McCall Smith's stories of Precious Ramotswe and her associates in detection and in life is like having a visit with old friends:  comfortable and reassuring.  The graciously gentle and peaceful manner of resolving difficult situations in typical Botswanan style is in direct contrast with the lifestyle of modern America.<br />There is a slow and easy nature to Precious Ramotswe, her fiance, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, and her assistant Mma Makutsi.  But that nature does not preclude initiative and innovation.  For even up against the competition of a chauvinistic new detective agency, Mma Ramotswe maintains her calm and patient demeanor and continues to serve her clients with discretion and wisdom.  For an African woman in her late thirties, she demonstrates inner peace and strength beyond her years.  Her ambitious assistant's new business, a typing school for men held after hours, provides a counter plot which enriches the story line.  In addition, the interwoven staffing of Matekoni's car repair shop with the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, further links Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi with the young mechanics who work for Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni.  This is a true family of characters, including the children of the orphanage on the outskirts of town, from which come Mma Ramotswe's extended family of adopted children.<br />Once again, there is logical conclusion to the predicaments of Precious Ramotswe and her associates.  These gentle twists to the unraveling of the unjust bring a smile to the reader and an appreciation for the beloved culture of these Botswanan natives.  They honor, revere and love their nation home.  And the reader comes to know that reverence in an almost personal way, although vicariously.<br />The love of a natural Africa with a citizenry that prides itself on respect for life, nature and one another, reminds one of the sweeping beauty in the opening shots and lines of the movie, &quot;Out of Africa&quot;.  Smith obviously has the same love of the Dark Continent and its people as did Isak Dinesen/Karen Blixen, whose voice over in the movie says, &quot;I once had a farm in Africa.&quot;  The past that Dinesen revered is the present of Precious Ramotswe.  Do not miss the opportunity to quiet your soul with a visit to these good people.love of the Dark Continent and its people as did Isak Dinesen/Karen Blixen, whose voice over in the movie says, &quot;I once had a farm in Africa.&quot;  The past that Dinesen revered is the present of Precious Ramotswe.

B00005JKN9|1.0|...Can't believe I paid good money for this atrocity.  A huge fan of Leo and Daniel-Day, I disliked (the nicest word I can write) them both intensely in this violence-filled mess.  I spoke with a young man who recommended it to me (telling me he had seen it THREE times!!!)  Maybe it's a \\"guy thing,\\" because I could barely watch \\"the whole thing.\\"  This DVD is going in a box to Good Will!!
080013558X|5.0|I first saw Annie when I was two or three years old, and it was one of my favorite childhood movies.  I loved the songs, the dancing, the characters... However, I never saw it as being humerous until I recently watched it on the Disney Channel a few weeks ago. (I'm in my 20's now)  Watching the movie from an adult's point of view, I was able to pick up on many things that I just didn't &quot;get&quot; as a child. There are no words to describe Carol Burnett's drunken &quot;Little Girls&quot; number, or when she's in her underclothes attempting to seduce Daddy Warbucks in the orphanage.  It's hillarous,and I can't help thinking that some of the scenes aren't child appropriate.  But who cares, watch the movie, and if you saw it as a child, watch it again.
B00005JLXE|3.0|I went into this movie with high hopes and came out a little disappointed.  Overall, it's an entertaining movie, but it falls short in a few regards.  I'd originally heard that it was on par with Spider-Man, if not better, although a bit darker.  It's not really that dark (I'm pretty sure it even has a lower body count), and it's definitely no match for Spider-Man.<br />Now, I happen to like Daredevil, Bullseye, and the rest from their comic-book appearances.  These are some of the most fascinating heroes and villains you're ever likely to find translated into movie form.  The problem is, the movie just doesn't do them all justice.<br />First up is Matt Murdock, Daredevil himself, played by Ben Affleck.  If you're unfamiliar with Daredevil, you may think his primary super power is his oversized ego.  Nope, that's Affleck's super power (his lesser power being the ability to tolerate Jennifer Lopez's company for more than five minutes at a time).  Fans of Daredevil will immediately realize that he suddenly has a degree of superhuman strength and agility, brought about due to his heightened sense of touch instead of intense physical training. (I know that doesn't make any sense, but just go with it.)  Daredevil also retains his other heightened senses (excluding sight, of course), and makes us wonder how he can handle the amplified noise of New York City without going insane.  His radar, on the other hand, is a bit off.  Daredevil's radar sense is supposed to work better than sight, giving him the edge.  Instead, the special effect version we are shown of what Daredevil \\"sees\\" shows us that he can \\"see\\" about as well as any of us could see in a pool full of chlorine.  At least that explains why this is the only super hero you'll ever meet who nearly gets his ticket punched by an ambassador's daughter and an overweight crime boss.<br />Next is Elektra, played by Jennifer Garner.  Garner does Elektra well, no question about it.  She emotes, and she looks good.  Better still is her skill in the fight scenes.  She looks comfortable with her weapons, too, which is key to the character.<br />Then there's Bullseye, played by Colin Farrell.  Bullseye puts it best himself when he tells Kingpin, \\"I want a costume.\\"  Bullseye really should have had a costume.  Maybe the original comic-book costume would have looked a bit cartoonish on the big screen, but he could have at least had a modified ninja outfit.  Instead, he comes out looking like a pimp who passed out with his forehead resting on a hot stove.  If they came up with a way to put the Green Goblin in his costume in Spider-Man, you'd think they could do it with Bullseye in Daredevil.  His ability to turn any object into a deadly weapon is really cool, and makes sense when he's chucking shards of glass at people, but he pushes believability when he kills a guy with bits of a paperclip.  I don't care how fast you can throw a curve ball, you just can't kill somebody by beaning them with a dry sponge.<br />Last, but certainly not least, is Kingpin, played by Michael Clarke Duncan.  Of all the characters, Kingpin has been cast best, and Duncan does a great job.  Purists may have a problem with how Kingpin is suddenly black, but that's really one of the lesser changes made between comic and film.  He's mean when he's supposed to be mean, and charming when he's supposed to be charming.  Better still, his style and personality truly portray him as a guy who pulled himself up from thug to crime lord.  Kingpin has always been a good villain anyway, but Duncan sets him off.<br />Read no further if you want to avoid spoilers.  The best part of this movie is the flashback scene near the beginning where we see how Daredevil became Daredevil.  It's very Spider-Man in this way, and almost as touching.<br />Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there.  Particularly notable is the part where Daredevil, Elektra, and Bullseye meet up for their three-way rooftop battle.  Maybe I missed something there, but how did those three arrange to meet up in a city that big at just the right time?  It's not like they fly a Devil Signal in the sky, and I doubt any of these guys give out their pager numbers to their archenemies.<br />Elektra turns Daredevil into a corndog with her sai, but that doesn't stop him from miraculously recovering enough to take on both Bullseye and Kingpin later that night.  Despite losing what looks like more blood than most human bodies can hold, Daredevil can still scale the walls of a church and execute flips that allow him to dodge projectiles thrown by a guy who \\"never misses.\\"<br />After beating Bullseye, Daredevil goes on in videogame style to face the next boss, Kingpin.  This is what annoyed me most.  Kingpin is the classic behind-the-curtain villain.  Since they already knew this movie would have a sequel, there was no need to let Daredevil beat the tar out of him so soon.  This fight should be the climax to the trilogy, not the first movie.<br />Of course, Kingpin promises to return, and Bullseye is also still breathing.  It's possible Bullseye will even have his Wolverine-style adamantium skeleton in a later film, since he probably busted up most of his bones when Daredevil through him out of that building.  Fans also know that, as the ending hints, Elektra will return in a later film, despite her dramatic death.<br />So there you have it.  This is a decent movie with some great fight scenes, adequate special effects, and a wardrobe department and cast that will leave you shaking your head in wonder and confusion.  It's worth watching, but given the choice, see Spider-Man.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Christina Aguilera has evolved to many different people on this album, but which one is her? Christina dabbles in hip-hop, rock, latin, and pop on this album, but she has yet to decide which is her. But, this album does provide many different sounds of music, which keeps listeners, well.., listening. From the start you are too realize this isn't the same Christina who sang about genies in bottles, and acted tarty. She has grown into a \\"Dirrty\\" girl who is \\"beautiful\\" and a \\"fighter.\\" She collaborated with Lil Kim, Red Man, and Alicia Keys, each brings a different vibe/flavor to the album. I was empressed with most of the songs, but I was dissapointed after seeing not many songs sounded like \\"Dirrty.\\" The first single, \\"Dirrty,\\" tanked on the charts at #48, and every single after reached top 20. Or close to it. Anyway, here is a track by track review.\<br />1.Stripped Intro Pt.1 - 4/5 - Best intro/interlude on the album. A real attention grabber.<br />2.Can't Hold Us Down - 4/5 - It keeps growing on me, at I first I loved it, then hated it, I wish the beat changed.<br />3.Walk Away - 4/5 - The first ballad. A nice slow song, the lyrics at first are a little..strange. But it is a nice aong with good vocals.<br />4.Fighter - 3.5/5 - This is like \\"CHUD\\", I had a love/hate thing going on here too. It dips into rock music.<br />5.Infatuation (Interlude) - 1/5 - Sorry, i just don't like interludes, but she does speak spanish on this one.<br />6.Infatuation - 4/5 - Seems wrong for this album. It is the poppiest song, but with a latin flare.<br />7.Loving Me 4 Me (Interlude) - 1/5 - Just bad, I don't it just interupts the album, to me at least.<br />8.Loving Me 4 Me - 2/5 - Maybe the interlude ruined it? It's the type of song that not pop or R&B, or hip-hop, it is a mix. It would do fantastic on radio.<br />9.Impossible (Ft.Alicia Keys) - 4.5/5 - Great track. It uses a piano and it's actually kind of bluesy.<br />10.Underappreciated - 4/5 - Good track. Nice mid-tempo, sexy beat.<br />11.Beautiful - 5/5 - Easily one of the best tracks. A ballad which probably everyone has at least heard once. This song was so big because, it was a message everyone can relate to globally.<br />12.Make Over - 2.5/5 - Not too good. A drum beat with a latin beat? I don't know, but it sounds like Christina's doing a lot of screaming<br />13.Cruz - 5/5 - At first I wouldn't ever listen to this, the beginning just sounded cheesy. Until a few days ago, and now I love this! A nice mid-tempo.<br />14.Soar - 1.5/5 - Yeek! Sorry, but this song isn't good. Another mid-tempo. I usually skip this.<br />15.Get Mine, Get Yours - 4/5 - Excellent! A very slinky, sexy track. It reminds of a much slower \\"Dirrty.\\" Yet another mid-tempo, but definatly better, and a bit faster.<br />16.Dirrty - 5/5 - One of the best tracks on the album, no, probably the bet she had done! A fast song, not favored but most.<br />17.Stripped Pt.2 - 1/5 - She lost me on this outro, it is like a carbon copy of the first!<br />18.A Voice Within - 2/5 - Another boring track. The album starts to slow up.<br />19.I'm OK - 4.5/5 - Very sad. I wish this track was a bonus, I don't think it should have been on here. It's very personal to her.<br />20.Keep On Singing My Song - 3.5/5 - Good ending track. Mid-tempo.<br />Overall, this album is average. Around the 3.5-4 stars range. But closer to 4 then 3. \\"Stripped\\" isn't for everyone but, if you want a good album. BUY IT!

If you want to know how to perform an exercise, how much protein should you take, what is ketosis or how to set your training for your body type - it is all inside. <br />Of course you may not agree with everything it is written here. Personally, I don't use Arnold's approach (but HIT routines instead). Still, I like the book for being so extensive and informative.

B000002C25|5.0|It really boggles my mind why critics and most fans despise this album, personally i think this is the best oasis album.<BR>Most of the songs are good, but there is no other song like \\"do you know what i mean\\" its one of their best songs, its up there with supersonic and wonderwall.<BR>The other songs in this album are almost equally amazing like the catchy song \\"i hope i think i know\\" and \\"be here now\\"<br />I understand that some people think this album, if compared to the first 2 oasis albums,falls short.But i dont understand why people think it sucks.Its probably the best... well for me personally.
B00009V7T2|4.0|This is prog rock, make no mistake.  If you come into this expecting the beautiful and unique variety of hardcore that ATDI offered, then you'll be disappointed.  I fully expected this album to be experimental, with rumors circulating early about the concept album story-line behind the songs, and the LP having those wonderfully intense 7:00 minute songs.  However the experiment isn't a complete success.  Some parts are rather forced, such as the rather bland and generic techno noodling between some songs.  Bixler's word salad lyrics come across as strained in some parts, bordering the line between surreal and ridiculous.  There are parts that will have you amazed with their intensity, and skillful execution, and parts that will have you drumming your fingers, waiting for the next good bit to kick in.  It's a real shame that they couldn't have edited De-Loused into something a bit more concise, and perhaps kept some of the tracks a little closer to their original state (roulette dares, mainly).  Plus I wish that some of the songs off of the LP could have gotten in in their full versions, especially the amazing 'cut that city'.<br />Overall, this album is enjoyable, and grows on you.  However I can't help but wonder what a bit of successful editing could have done for this amazing band.
B00005A46T|2.0|These guys are really bad at making heavy music. They could have stuck to their Nu-Metal filled Self Titled CD. I respect their descision for trying to get off MTV, and they did it well, but they really can't make good hardcore music. Face it people SLIPKNOT ARE NU-METAL. I don't like it when people call Slipknot Heavy Metal, it's wrong. Slayer, Chimaira, Superjoint Ritual...that's real, heavy, good music. I like some songs on Iowa, 'Gently' 'Everything Ends'...that's about it.
1556589433|3.0|This movie should be shown to every student in acting, not much as an example of filmmaking, as the film itself is flawed and slowpaced, although truly beautiful in patches, but as an example of acting. Mac Nicol and especially Kline offer very good performances, but the real standout in this movie is of course Meryl Streep, the greatest of them all.<br /><br />  Yes, Katharine Hepburn was charming, yes, Bette Davis' eyes were the silver screen's most expressive ones, yes, one single silent moment in a Greta Garbo movie was well worth the price of the ticket or that of the DVD, yes, Liz Taylor was beautiful and skillful, yes, Jane Fonda was talented and versatile. But when it comes to sheer acting skills Meryl is simply the best. I mean the best of all time. So far she has offered us so many totally different characters speaking different languages and accents that I wouldn't be too surprised seeing her onscreen speaking perfect chinese or albanian in a near future. Personally I don't consider her so much an actress as an incarnation of the character she plays, and she has already pushed this concept to further limits. She is so studied and spontaneous at the same time, poignant, moving, cold, distant, expressive, fascinating, sexy, sometimes even beautiful, economical and parsimonious in her acting. Like de Niro, she simply has no limits at all.<br /><br />  I don't like so much comparing one actor to another, especially actors or actresses that have lived and worked in different decades or centuries, and not only actors; I mean, how can you compare Shakespeare to Hugo, Einstein to Newton, Macchiavelli to Churchill, Mohammed Ali to Michael Jordan, Beethoven to Mozart, Brando to de Niro?<br /><br />  But sometimes it happens that the gap between the best and the rest of them all is so obvious that you can't help comparing and choosing. I just hope that Meryl Streep continues to make more and more beautiful movies and offer us more pleasure and emotions with her acting skills, although quite frankly I don't expect her to top herself, as what she's done in \\"Sophie's choice\\" is as good as acting in movies can get. But I don't expect it from any other actress either. Not in the near future anyway.e frankly I don't expect her to top herself, as what she's done in \\"Sophie's choice\\" is as good as acting in movies can get.

B000002KY8|5.0|Even though he now often exasperates me with the erratic behavior of one deemed a genius at a relatively young age, I've been a Prince fan since Soft and Wet in 1977 and first purchased this work as a LP in 1982. So it is with a great deal of confidence I can declare this as His Royal Badness' best and most definitive work.<br />By 1982, Prince had been building upon the musical and critical achievements of each of his albums. Though not a huge mainstream success, Dirty Mind and Controversy hinted at what was to come with 1999 and Purple Rain. In the former 2 works, you can sense a young artist finding and challenging himself. By the time 1999 was released, Prince was deserving of all the critical accolades coming his way (which he addresses in All The Critics Luv You In New York.)<br />1999 was the first single released and while I didn't care for it initially (it's still my least favorite song on this album), sheer adolescent devotion to Prince made me buy the LP. I didn't like the title track but the rest of the songs still stay with me to this day, particularly Delirious, Automatic, Something in the Water (Does Not Compute), All The Critics and International Lover. Shocking at the time for it's content and language, the CD seems almost quaint compared to what we hear today.<br />As I'm one of those people who often complain about the synthesizers and computers prevalent in R&B/Pop today, I have to note that Prince could probably be considered one of the pioneers of the practice. The difference is he also knew how and did play his own instruments in addition to using a band. As a result, the CD still sounds as strong as it did 20 years ago.
0375823360|3.0|First a disclaimer.  I am 28 years old and only read the series as the first two books happened to already be in my apartment in Japan and I was bored.  I had to buy the third book in Tokyo.<br />The first book in the series was great, no questions.  The idea of people with daemons is a fascinating one and it got my imagination fired up.  As some people have mentioned, Lyra is not exactly the most interesting heroine, but the book moves at a strong clip and her world is a familiar yet unique place.<br />Book two introduces Will and Dr Mary Malone and things start to slow down.  Not necessarily a bad thing as sub-plots come to the forefront.  Dark clouds looming for book three though.<br />I was 'lucky' enough to find book 3 in Shinjuku, Tokyo (English books not being exactly popular in Japan) and I still have about 20 pages to go.  The thing is; I just don't care.  I just want the book to end so I can put it away.  Definitely not a good feeling.  There are just too many sub-plots and the characters are dull as dish-water with some completely out of character events and dialogue (based on the first two books).  <br />Also, while not being particularly religious myself, Pullman's ideologies are rammed into your face page after page.  There is no subtlety to it.  God is dead, Christianity is for stupid people, wisdom comes from . . . well who knows?  Obviously he is a very bitter man but if I want to read some crackpot religious treatise I will go to the Religion section in the bookstore.  <br />The whole book is a shambles, boring characters, inconsistent dialogue/action (not in character), long winded chapters where nothing happens and constant nagging about Christianity.  It was just not enjoyable for me.<br />I don't know what to say, the first book is amazing, the second is so-so and the final book was just a chore.  I would say read it, but there is much better junior fiction (or adult fiction if you are around 12 or so) to be had than this.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Chicago was an amazing film that has a star studded cast that lits up the screen. Renee Zellweger played her best performance to date, Cathrine Zetta Jones was captavating, and Richard Gere was excellent in a different role than usual for him. It's a fun musical unlike anything I have ever seen, and the soundtrack will keep you dancing in you seats.

B00005JL78|4.0|In the past, Spielberg was well-known for delivering two kinds of movie:  the (often sappy) feel-good movie like &quot;E.T.&quot; and the dark, devastating film like &quot;Schindler's List.&quot;  Lately, he has begun to mature as a director/producer with offerings that give the viewer more variety.  &quot;Minority Report&quot; is one of those films.  Set in the future that is recognizable just as often as it is not, Spielberg adds comedy to desperation, heart-felt grief to adventure, accident to calculated science.<br />The gist of the movie can be explained simply.  John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the chief of Pre-Crime, a police experiment that results in a murder-free Washington, D.C.  The secret behind the success of Pre-Crime is three &quot;pre-cogs&quot; who foresee murder before it happens, giving the police time to intervene.  When the pre-cogs finger John himself as a premeditated murderer even though he does not even know the supposed victim, he realizes his only hope is to run.<br />Although the special effects are interesting, they sometimes clutter a movie that is, after all, about predestination, exploitation, and the meaning of innocence.  We don't need a fantastical future to feel these themes.  While the futuristic cars and their highways are cool, a greenhouse of bizarre botanical specimens is too much, even to point out how far the geneticists of the future succeed in their quest to manipulate life.  The comedy in some of the darkest scenes works well as both relief and set-up of greater tension.<br />&quot;Minority Report&quot; contains some major holes, but all in all, comes off as an entertaining and, more importantly, original story. The characterization is surprisingly detailed for a sci-fi adventure, creating a future that feels more truthfully human than I expected.  The acting is generally solid, and the cinematography often above-average.  My biggest complaint about the DVD specifically was the quality of the sound - it never exploited the capabilities of my surround-sound system and often sounded dull.<br />&quot;Minority Report&quot; is an excellent choice for both teens and adults, especially for those who like a thrill with their flicks.capabilities of my surround-sound system and often sounded dull.<br />&quot;Minority Report&quot; is an excellent choice for both teens and adults, especially for those who like a thrill with their flicks.
B00005JKGK|5.0|I have not read the book before and I borrowed this dvd from the library thinking that it should be boring.  Boy! Was I wrong!<br />I feel that the film is very interesting, heartwarming and easy to understand.  It is about the lives of 4 pairs of Chinese mothers and daughters and also about the differences in their upbringing and expectations in China (all mothers in flim are from China) and in America (all daughters are born in America).<br />It should appeal to a wide audience, especially American Chinese or Chinese who live abroad.
B000000WA4|5.0|For anyone who doesn't own this album: you're missing out. Being a complete sucker for the '90s, anti-glam rock and pro- everything Kurt Cobain stood for, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness fit right in there for me. Not because the Smashing Pumpkins didn't care about their image and wore flannel and didn't shower (which they didn't), but because they cared more about the music than the image, and that really shines in this album. For anyone who claims to be a Smashing Pumpkins fan, hardcore or passive, this album is a must have. Although Billy Corgan's voice is criticized as being whiny and nasally, it is a voice uniquely his own, and after a while, it grows on you. But, for me, what really stuck out in this album was Jimmy Chamberlin's AMAZING power drumming. Even in you don't play the drums, you have do admit what an outstanding job he did. Top songs on this album (for me, anyway) include \\"Tonight, Tonight\\", \\"Jellybelly\\", \\"Zero\\", \\"Love\\", \\"Muzzle\\", \\"Where Boys Fear to Tread\\", (my personal favorite) \\"Bodies\\", and \\"1979\\".
B000000HTM|4.0|There are few progressive rock albums which create such a strong divide among listeners as &quot;Pawn Hearts&quot; by Van Der Graaf Generator.  Hammill's operatic vocal histrionics are among the most love-it-or-hate-it in rock, and for most he is an acquired taste (although his later solo albums like &quot;The Future Now&quot; may be a little bit easier on the first-time listener's ear).  Many prog fans disparage VDGG for embodying the worst aspects of the prog-rock style; the over-seriousness, pomposity and supposed lack of any real melody are all quoted, but after having lived with this album for many years now I (and other VDGG fans)find it to be the group's finest achievement.<br />The album may have one of the most powerful opening moments ever, as it evokes the narrator perched on the edge of a clifftop, the wind howling around him, overlooking omens and portents of disaster.  The dense atmospherics evoked by the group swirl and pound at the ear, leading to an agressive, complex series of riffs around which the group attempts to plumb the lowest depths of the psyche.  This intellectual approach surely turned off the critics looking for another &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, but entranced college-age listeners who were attracted to its dark, neo-gothic tone.<br />The side-long &quot;A Plague Of Lighthouse Keepers&quot; predates Genesis' &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; but moves through similar territory, albeit a bit darker; beginning in a slow and stately manner, it moves through organized moments of ever-increasing chaos, with some early synthesizer and mellotron work mimicking a grand classical chorale, before at last finding release in a fine Robert Fripp guitar solo.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This movie is an absolute classic (to me at least).  Every year I see it, I watch the First day of the battle on July 1st, the second day of the battle on July 2nd and the third day on the third of July, in keeping with the pace of the events.  I have watched it numerous times on other occasions since I was 8.  This movie captures the true spirit of the Civil War like none other.  It perfectly portrays the generals who were there.  Lee, Longstreet, Hood, Armistead, Hancock, Buford, Reynolds and especially Pickett.  Not to forget of course Colonel Chamberlain. In the many Civil War books I have read, this movie is one of the most accurate historical movies I have seen.  In fact, it even keeps quite close to the book it was made from, The Kiler Angels by Michael Shaara.  The books by the Michael and Jeff Shaara are all must reads.  The battles do not add unnecessary action but show the desperate effort of Pickett's Charge and Chamberlain's pivotal defense of Little Round Top magnificently.  One unnecessary addition, however, was having Chamberlain witness Pickett's Charge and have that conversation with General Hancock.  Despite the length, this movie holds your interest quite well.  The emotion of each of the generals is portrayed so well.  The sulleness of Longstreet, the serenity of Lee, the flamboyant Pickett, the philosophical Chamberlain and the calm Armistead are the starts of this film.  I have personally been to Gettysburg 14 times and still have not seen everything there and feel that this movie so well portrays such a complex battle.  Gettysburg, Gods and Generals are must-see movies while The Killer Angels, Gods and Generals and all the other Shaara books are must-read books.
B00005JLZN|5.0|This, plain and simple, was one of the most profound and striking films I have ever seen.  David Gale, played by Kevin Spacey, is a University professor who is the regional director of \\"Deathwatch,\\" an activist group who vehemently opposes the death penalty. Gale, considered a genius by the academic community, was tried and convicted of the rape and murder of his colleague and best friend, Constance. He was sentenced to die in the State of Texas penal system.  The irony being that he himself, one of biggest opponents of the death penalty, would have landed on death row.<br />The story is told in a series of flashbacks, to a reporter, whom Gale has entrusted his freedom, his very life for that matter.  Bitsy, the reporter, played by Kate Winslet, herself has had a run-in with the law.  Gale tells the story of how he was fired from his job, how his life was ruined, and how he ended up being put on death row.  Throughout the story it becomes more and more evident that he was innocent of the murder of his best friend.  <br />There was a tripod at the scene of the murder.  Gale in turn, knows that there was a camera at the scene, and knows whoever put it there, holds the key to his freedom.  <br />The film transitions from scene to scene with a speed and precision that was absolutely stunning.  The story becomes more and more gripping.  There are not many things that can be said about this movie that would not ruin it. Know that it is genius, but also know that if you are strong in pro-death penalty beliefs, this may not well be the film for you.  It is screamingly liberal. If that is not your cup of tea, don't watch this.  <br />The only thing I will say that is a negative about this movie is that it loses a lot in re-watching.  The captivating surprises that are throughout this film are no longer surprises, therefore a lot is lost.  Aside from that, this is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen.<br />epc
0553573403|5.0|After over 900 reviews what can I add??<br />This book shows what talent really is. The story shows people & their nature, whether it's courage, greed, vengeance or righteousness. And how it affects their lives & ultimately their futures.<br />The characters have virtues & faults. So like us, so you feel for all of them, and there lies Mr. Martin's talent.<br />The book is called a game of thrones, & it is that.<br />Mainly it's the fight between two families for the throne, in between deceit, an unknown evil from the north, dragons & more.<br />I read the beginning a few years back but didn't get the \\"living dead\\" thing at the time. I read the book a few days back & truly enjoyed it.<br />If you like the intrigue of the minds, hidden motives, mysteries & the making of wars.<br />If you are intrigued by scheming on a grand scale, then this is the book for you.<br />The cast is large but easy enough to follow, there is a lot going on at the same time & you will be right there with them living the adventure.

B00000I41J|4.0|My experience with Cannonbal was mostly through Miles Davis a couple of other CD's, (Cannonball and Coltrane), (Nippon Soul).

Get this one to complete your library.
B00006LHUW|5.0|&quot;Come Away With Me&quot;, the title album track, perfectly blends pop and jazz.  Her quiet, soothing voice gives radio mainstream the needed variety.  She showcases her just-as-excelled piano talents.  Her written lyrics and musical theme spice a night out of town with that special someone and a walk along the beach.  Those who like &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; should buy her album and the single &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is one of those albums that comes along and redefines not only an artistic mindset, but also pushes the perimeters of music.  There is a fluid movement in OK Computer that is rarely seen in popular music today.  It is a complicated reinactment of the most raw and basic of human emotions, from the numbing to the terrifying...and performed with intentional precision. Intelligent, bold, at times stunningly beautiful and relentless. It is a must any any music collection.
B000092ZYX|5.0|After hearing the 14 delightful tracks which make up Radiohead's new masterpiece, i am completely convinced that the band are presently the most innovative and creative in the world!  <BR>With a clever mix of electronics from the works of Kid A, Thom Yorke's haunting melancholic wails from Amnesiac, and guitar rock revived from the Bends, Radiohead have found a delicate balance which makes their sound the most unique in music today.  <BR>Thom Yorke's band create music which inspires and communicates  a number of different meanings to a number of different individuals.  However, Yorke's frightening lyrics on Hail to the Thief tell us of our world &quot;spinning out of time&quot;, delves into issues raised after 7/11, and finally leaves us in a world which mirrors George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; - a world of grey and hopelessness.  Radiohead are here to keep us sane!
B000068QY7|3.0|Most of Heathen Chemistry comes across as too mellow.  Fans have been waiting a really long time for a return to rock, yet Noel let's a lot of us down.  Mainly the opener The Hindu Times and Hung In A Bad Place really rock.  The rest kind of plod through.  The album does have some finer points though, like the epic lighter anthem, &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot;. It is a good thing that Noel finally let other band members contribute to Oasis albums, but it might be too late.  Oasis lost a lot of credibility after Be Here Now, but with this album you can tell that at least they are trying.  If you like slower songs, Liam Gallagher wrote two of the better ones in &quot;Songbird&quot; and &quot;Born On A Different Cloud&quot;.
0345410025|5.0|For a person with average who has little concept of the power of imagination and creativity, and who generally views it as being something childish, this is a great book. For a person with above average control and understanding of imagination and creativity, this is a sorry adaptation of `The Art of memory'. <BR>For the average person this is a great book. It helps build imaginative power and a little creativity as well. It describes that the best way to remember things is to build a mental image of interaction between the various facts you're required to remember. It recommends that the more ridiculous the image, the easier it is to remember which is true (and should only be applied in special situations), but if taken to seriously then with every new image you create you'll constantly be trying to `out-do' the previous image you created to remember something else. You'll be forced to imagine images that are so out landish that it'll cense to trigger your memory. That's how I see it and like everything in your life, a word of caution can be said that you shouldn't take it to seriously and try to remain grounded. This book takes no effort in helping you to understand what it is you're remembering. For the best I suppose because that isn't the purpose of the book (for an easy method of understanding, read my review of The Mind Map Book: How to Use Radiant Thinking to Maximize Your Brain's...). I do compliment them for their complete lack of fluff or Anthony Robbins b.s.. They are straight forward and don't attempt to sell you anything. They certainly don't try to motivate you or make you believe that all of life's problems can be solved if only you had a better memory. A great memory is a tool, not a solution for life. For the person with above average imaginative abilities you're better off reading the more in depth `Art of Memory' which is literary classic and is everything but a light read. The `Art of Memory' is far more complicated and in-depth in  it's description and style of memory techniques (better might I add). But to use `The Art of Memory' techniques requires a high amount of visual processing by the mind eye and a good deal of discipline, but worth it. It is not for the faint of heart. But if you're looking for a read that is quick and fast and has little or no historical back ground (not necessary a bad thing I'm only stating that facts), then this is your book. If you're a busy person and time is money, then this is your book. I do believe that the technique that is describes is the best. Everything else is probably new age [stuff]. Final analysis: All though weak in it's description of the technique in comparison with is predecessor, it's content is far more accurate and use ability than is peers. In short: the best of it's kind.
0790729652|5.0|This is still the best super hero movie. Superman was good, x-men was good, and Spiderman was good, but this Batman is great. The movie looks fantastic. Jack steals the movie as the Joker, and Keaton makes for one great Batman. The movie helps the viewer understand that Batman is not this kind hearted person who just wants to do good in the world; it shows that he is a tormented soul. He in other words is just about as psycho as the Joker. Batman is not a nice guy in the movie, something that you do not get to see in other superhero movies. Joker is fantastic. The movie is both funny and tastefully done. The action is not over the top and there is an added believability to the fictional characters. The direction and acting are great. I enjoyed this movie when it first came out when I was a kid, and enjoyed it so much more as an adult. It really is not for kids, its almost the first grown up super hero movie.
B000069KGM|5.0|The first- and best- of a long series of the &quot;sign&quot; albums from this group. The original concept was to present a rock band equipped with horns- a punchier version of BS&amp;T- and it worked. <BR>Not that CTA conciously mimicked BS&amp;T- they just happened to surface at the same time- CTA was honing its act for sometime.<BR>AT the tme of release CTA was a double lp- at a 'special' price- which of course means its filled with filler. (&quot;Free form guitar&quot;, &quot;liberation&quot;..and the tendency to stretch out endings and intros- &quot;Beginnings&quot; obviously fades to the end to fill the vinyl on side one- and the piano intro to &quot;What time it is&quot; really does nothing for the song- the single version trimmed this to good effect.<BR>But what makes this release so valuable is its good songs and performances. The group was tight, having fun, and courtesy of Robert Lamm- capable of writing some good songs.<BR>Two tracks- &quot;south California Purples&quot; and their cover of &quot;I'm a Man&quot; were FM staples- and the the best trax on this release.<BR>&quot;Listen&quot; , &quot;Introduction&quot;, &quot;questions 67 and 68&quot; demonstrate how good this group was in 1969. The followup 'steel cover' &quot;Chicago&quot; lp was another spirited, imaginative release.<BR>Subsequent releases afteward continued in a fast downward spin- resulting in the group staking their career as a Peter Cetera ballad band-  <BR>But this release and the followup, show the band in their best light- and are the two cds you need from this group.

B00005JLXE|2.0|Since \\"Blade\\" came out in 1999, Marvel Comics caught a big one with the super-hero movies. A year later, Bryan Singer proved with \\"X-Men\\" that comic book adaptations could be both ambitious and succesful, then... a monster was born. \\"Blade 2\\", \\"Spiderman\\", \\"X-Men 2\\" and \\"The Hulk\\", all hit (and smashed) the box office, and many more are on the way. Of all these flicks, only \\"Daredevil\\" was a financial disapointment, and I have to say that 10 minutes into the movie you can see why.<br />First of all, and I think most people agree on this, the main problem of \\"Daredevil\\" is its lead star. Ben Affleck is an actor that just doesn't seem to make it . He is very good as Matt Murdock, the pro-bono lawyer, and you even like the guy when he talks to his buddy in the Seinfeld-like coffee shop. However, once he puts on his superhero costume, the magic runs out. Affleck just doesn't have the dark sex appeal necessary for the nocturnal vigilante (anyone who has seen Tim Burton's Batman knows how important this is), therefore his character fails to deliver the necessary empathy or connection between the audience and the hero. You would think that with such a problem, the supporting cast should make up for the rest, but you're wrong. The movie has some beloved Marvel characters like Elektra (Jennifer Garner), Bullseye (Colin Farrell) and Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), but none of them is crucial to the story. NONE OF THEM! I swear to God that if you add up all the scenes in which they are, none of them is on the movie for more than 20 minutes. Or at least, it doesn't seem so. Elektra, especially, was thought to be the best thing in the movie. At least, in the trailers it looked like she was. She sort of is, but she only has two (I repeat, TWO) fight scenes, and her character is pretty much wasted. So is Bullseye, who is little more than a cartoon in Colin Farrell's hands. As for Kingpin, well, I don't mind that they changed his looks dramatically, but he's the least developed character. A stupid plot twist makes him Daredevil's archenemy, and the end is just silly and pathetic.<br />Another problem is the plot. Or better yet, the \\"plots\\". A lot of things happen in the movie, but none of them are central. There comes a time when Elektra is out to kill Daredevil, believing he's her father's murdeder. THAT should've been the movie, but it is resolved quickly and without consequences. Anyway, in plot, character and performances, \\"Daredevil\\" takes the plunge big time.<br />The edition is another story. It is by far one the best I've seen. It would be easier to say what doesn't have. Of all the documentaries, featurettes and other features, some are dedicated to the comic book, others to the movie. Both are great. It seems like this time New Line Cinema really went for the money, which makes me think that they hope \\"Daredevil\\" to be a hit on DVD more than it was on the theaters. If you're a fan of the comic book, then these features should be more satisfying that the movie itself.<br />There isn't much more. I really can't say that I liked \\"Daredevil\\", but I've seen worse. However, of all these superhero fever, I advice you to stick with \\"The Hulk\\" or \\"X-Men 2\\". This goes to show you that for a comic-book adaptation to be good, it's not all about big budgets and special effects. There's something more, and this one doesn't have it. I've heard that they are preparing new superhero movies, including a second \\"Spiderman\\", a third \\"X-Men\\", \\"The Fantastic Four\\", \\"Elektra\\" and \\"Catwoman\\". Somehow, I don't think that Ben and his blind lawyer from Hell's Kitchen are making a comeback.haracter.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|if the several hundred reviews before this don't convince you that this is a remarkable movie, then I don't know what will.<br />This is incredible, smart filmmaking.  A hodgepodge of genres, it leaves you unable to verbalize your feelings about the full spectrum of sensory stimulation that you just sat through...add the fact that it didnt even MAKE it to most theaters, and you begin to get very cynical about the way Hollywood makes movies these days.<br />Folks, this is worth 10 times what it costs.  Buy it, and buy a back up copy for when you wear out your first one.
B00003BDXG|1.0|The most disapointing thing about Natural Born Killers is how much great talent was wasted to produce this mess of a movie.  Quentin Tarantino?  Oliver Stone?  These guys are great filmmakers, and yet this movie is absolutely horrible.  Tarantino certainly cannot be blamed nearly as much as Stone since Tarantino only wrote the screenplay and even that was changed dramatically by Stone (for the worse) but it is still unfortunate that such a wonderful filmmaker like Tarantino would have his name attached to this garbage.  And Stone, another marvelous filmmaker, how could he have not seen that this films message has been overused so much that unless there's something new to say (there wasn't) then audiences dont' need to hear any more about it.<BR>I thought I was in for a real treat when i rented this but once the movie started I began to fear that I was wrong, but I told myself that it would get better, as most films do.  I waited for character development, never happened(scenes displaying sadistic parents are not the same as character development), I waited for an actual plot (this movie has a premise, not a plot) and finally, i waited for Stone's point, for the great message that was supposed to be nicely conceiled within this \\"work of art\\" and guess what, it never came.  OH MY GOD!  THE MEDIA GLORIFIES VIOLENCE!  ETC! ETC!  Thanks Oliver, I'm glad you're here to tell us these things.<BR>This movie (and notice i say movie, not film) could have been less of a trainwreck if a more serious approach was taken to it.  Obviously, it would have to be over the top, but not so horribly over the top that it's nearly impossible to feel anything except impatience while watching it.  The violence is much too cartoony (are we supposed to be appalled when Elmer Fudd runs off a cliff in a Warner Bro's Cartoon?)  If we can't identify the world in the movie as our own, we can't feel the same impact as if we could imagine the events in the movie to be real.<BR>Also, I thought the action was bad.  A better approach would have been to make the action really cool and then throw it in our faces at the end that we liked the violence and therefor we are as desensitized to violence as the movie says we are.  Hey, maybe I'll do that.<BR>This movie is so far out there that it isn't enjoyable at all, and i found myself thinking: \\"only one and a half hours left.\\"  Yeah, it's that bad.  And I'm pretty fond of violence and all that good stuff in films (I'm sure some of the films fans will think \\"AH-HA\\" to this, thinking incorrectly that this somehow strengthens Stone's message in NBK) I really liked a Clockwork Orange, which this movie sort of tries to be like, but not nearly as good.<BR>Not that Oliver Stone would ever read this review or take offense that i disliked his movie, I would still like to say that he truly is a gifted director and I hope i don't think of this peice o' junk every time i see one of his great films.

B00005YIPM|5.0|This review is for the SACD version of TAPESTRY.  Everyone knows the story behind TAPESTRY,  little unknown singer-songwriter makes an album in the early 70's that goes on to become the largest selling album in history, (at that time.) But the multi-channel SACD version of this classic album is just the best. Simply put, the 5.1 surround sound mix of TAPESTRY is what SACD is all about. If you are lucky enough to own a 5.1 SACD set-up, this disc is a must own. If you do not own a surround sound SACD set up, this disc is the reason to buy such a hi-fi. The vocal placement and piano tracks sound absolutely ethereal. This surround sound SACD places the listener right in the middle of the music, in a most pleaseing way. But that is not all. The DSD transfer of the music itself is flawless, with transients that are so sonic and real, you would swear that the band was performing live right there for you. One might not associate Carole King with loud music, but put this disc on, shut off the lights, sit in the middle of a good 5.1 surrouns sound speaker set up, turn up the volume and then just press play. This disc will blow you away.

B0000041Q3|5.0|I love this Turandot. It's been around for quite a long time. The three principles are the biggest superstars in opera. Since it's generally universally regarded that Pavarotti and Caballe are the best in their roles, I'll concentrate on Joan Sutherland here. Whom although a vast majority of opera fans  agreed was brilliant here,  a tiny minority but vocal Nilsson fans feel that the Swedish Wagnerian soprano was the ideal Turandot. Let me tell you why I think Sutherland is a better Principessa of Ice than Birgit Nilsson.<br />There are those who criticize Joan Sutherland for having the lack of size for the formidible role of Turandot. The truth is, she was originally trained to be a Wagnerian dramatic soprano. In the middle 1950's She could have sang Brunhilda  if she chose to. In fact, she did sing Eva in Wagner's Meistersinger with great success early in her career. The quality of her high notes are legendary. If you were in the audience of a 1961 Lucia with Sutherland at the Met, her high E flats were rockets that almost blew up the place. They were the among the largest high notes I've ever heard. As an old timer opera fan, I can honestly tell you Sutherland's highest  notes from her youth were even larger than Nilsson's, especially the notes above high C. And that's from a fan who's heard them both numerous times. However, her midrange was never as strong as the Swedish diva. And her lower range can't be compare to Nilsson's. But remember, the recording studio can even that up.<br />True, in this Turandot, Sutherland is 10 years older than when I first heard her as Lucia in 1961. This recording is 1971. The diva's voice is much darker, and her upper register has lost some of it's power. This to be compare to Nilsson's 1960 recording is nonsense. Of course Nilsson had more power in 1960 than Sutherland in 1971, but what's the point? Both have more than enough juice to sing the confused princess. And whoever said that Sutherland's voice sounded anemic next to Nilsson has never heard the two divas on an actual operatic stage. <br />Different voices... Nilsson's voice is like a rocket roaring toward its listener while  Sutherland is like a gigantic wall of sound that surrounds you like a blanket. You cannot say that when large volumes are needed, Sutherland cannot deliver them. I've  heard her soar over the gigantic choruses in Beatrice di Tenda, holding a high E for 12 seconds! That note still rings in my ears. <br />Believe me, the high tessitura of Turandot is not a problem for Sutherland's voice. Remember, she is the only soprano in the world to sing Esclamonde - a role that demands high Ds, Es, and a high G. Esclamonde also required a full 120 piece Wagnerian size orchestra (think Gotterdamerung).And Sutherland does trills and staccato above the brass section! LIVE on the SF stage in 1974, I was in the audience. Her voice was titanic, especially the high Ds.<br />As Turandot, Sutherland did not attack every note with shere power as Nilsson did. The role did not required that every note be sung that way. Sutherland only launch her massive high notes when they were called for. In the moments that called for softer notes, she can deliver them with great beauty. Because she sung Turandot with a wide range of  dynamics makes her superior to Nilsson's, who belting her Turandot. Having said that, Birgit Nilsson was argueably the greatest Wagnerian dramatic soprano of the last century, edging out even the glorious Kirsten Flagstad. But I still think in the studio, Sutherland's Turandot rules.
B000000WJZ|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins WERE 90's music for me.  Inventive, epic and oh-so prolific, the band (mostly Billy Corgan) really introduced me to the wide scope of rock music (classical and angst CAN work!)  At the time of Mellon Collie, I thought that was the greatest album ever, if only because it was so widely ambitious...well many years have passed since those teen years and since the band broke up, and the fractured (though still often divine) Mellon Collie doesn't hold together as well.  Happily, Siamese Dream does.<br />Siamese Dream is the best of all the pumpkins albums.  First off, and most importantly, this collection of songs is stellar.  Every one is a unique classic; either a textured symphony or a killer blast.  Corgan is at his songwriting peak; writing surprisingly introspective and very honest lyrics.  And the album as a whole- this is how it should be done!  The disc is a musical journey all to itself, with HUGELY varied sounds, approaches, rythms...I just love the closing dream pop segue on \\"Hummer,\\" and how it contrasts with, say, the guitar/jungle beat explosion that opens silver****.<br />Corgan and the band would attempt to topple this mighty album with \\"EVEN BIGGER\\"- the subsequent Mellon Collie.  And when Adore failed to spark (undeservedly), Machina attempted to be...well colossal.  On Siamese Dream, these pretentions don't even enter into it; the music isn't under pressure, and- partially due to this- it's even more mind-blowing.  Check it out; it's a mighty terrific record.
0385504209|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, which is not a casual comment from a person who hasn't read a work of fiction in 10 years! The author's skill draws the reader in almost immediately, and bit by bit, ever so slowly, he peels away the layers of mystery surrounding the murder of the curator of the Louvre, who as it turns out was the leader of an ancient order with a most fascinating purpose.<br />No doubt, True Believers may find this work blasphemous, but certainly the blending of fact and fantasy here makes for a wonderful mystery and raises lots of interesting questions.<br />I fully plan on reading another book by Dan Brown before another decade of nonfiction passes.
B000089RVX|5.0|i have to say that im extremely impressed by evanescences cd , i mean ive always listened to very what some peope would call prissy singers like britney spears and mary j. blige(none of whom i now listen to), and not that they dont have great voices but i mean amy lee has  such an awesome voice that sends goose bumps up my skin.<BR>im also impressed with the lyrics because all the songs that i have listened to lately are about peoples heartbreakd and crushes i mean comeon tyhe tune is catchy but the lyrics [not good], unlike them though the lyrices by evanescence are awesome, ive never read lyrics that deal with such issues in such a serious manner. i cant wait till their next cd and till then rock on evanescence.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Well, the DVD isn't out yet, but I was a faithful watcher of \\"Firefly,\\" and it truly is an exceptional show. The characters and their relationships are just amazing, and situations that could be cliched and dreadful are handled in a fresh and compelling way--frankly, I never thought that I would ever identify with the professional and personal issues facing a space hooker, but I did. I can watch episodes over and over again and still be struck by depth and complexity of the show. It is genuine art. If you don't mind using your brain when you watch your television, then this is the show for you.
B00005JLTN|5.0|Whoa. An unbelievable mindjob brought to you by the Wachowski brothers. \\"Reloaded\\" is a fast-paced movie; if you're not careful, you might get whiplashed. For starters, the special effects featured in this film far surpasses the previous \\"Matrix\\" installment. Consider bullet time the appetizer. \\"Reloaded\\" gives you the full meal. Neo's \\"burly brawl\\" with the Agents include a blistering 360 degree camera swing while he spins furiously around a metal post. Real? Like the Matrix itself, no. That scene was all done completely by CGI. The freeway chase is no picnic, either. $2.2 million worth of cars alone were trashed just for those 14 minutes- in addiiton, millions were poured into the making the freeway itself. Trinity is an angel without wings here, as she rips up the road on her Ducati motorcycle, with agents in tow. This chase alone is worth the [money]. Other visual goodies include battle scenes that resemble lethal ballets- the martial arts performed by Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and company are heavier, more intense. So intense, I forgot to breathe at some points.<br />Many have complained about the plotline of \\"Reloaded\\", critics included. No movie is perfect, but frankly, you cannot compare \\"Reloaded\\" with the first \\"Matrix\\". Why? For one, the purpose of the first \\"Matrix\\" was to build the background of Neo, his journey into the unknown, his initiaion if you will, into hero-dom. While the first \\"Matrix\\" focused only on a few characters, \\"Reloaded\\" expands on the character cache, which can be a bit confusing at times, but will undoubtedly be effective in one way or another in \\"Matrix: Revolutions.\\" Also, in \\"Reloaded\\", we see more of Zion, something that is different from the first. It is here in Zion that we see Trinity and Neo consumate their love for each other. A bit random, I have to say, and although seemingly pornographic at times, [ mild techno pounds in the background ] I throughougly enjoyed the fact that Trinity and Neo share that love between them- their relationship is more developed, emotional- Trinity is seen as leather-clad, but more feminine and sexier. Neo has taken a more Christ-like role this time around. Although still doubtful of himself at times, he is almost god-like, endowed with a multitude of new powers, like flying. The recurring dilliema through \\"Reloaded\\" seems to be choice, free will, and fate. Neo is to choose between saving humanity or saving Trinity; will love prevail, or will duty? Is the prophecy indeed true, or merely a hoax, a lie to disguise the truth? What was perceived to be real, is fake, and what is fake, is in actuality, real. Confused? Mindjob, I kid you not. Don't blink, and please, use the restroom before the movie.Not fun. Humor is also a subtle, yet effective play in \\"Reloaded\\"- dry humor, but humor nevertheless.<br />If you're not familiar with the philosophy that serves as the frame of the movie, you probably won't experience the maximum effect of the film. Following the writings of Plato, the Wachowski brothers shape Neo as Socrates, who is told that his mind will inevitably set the people free. Very spiffy. Eerily enough, Socrates is put on trial and sentenced to death, which brings to mind another question: does Neo die? Religious allusions are abundant as well. The Christian references are in no way hindering- all in all, the mythology, religion, and philosophy that the Wachowski brothers bring in, accentuate the film's main purpose.<br />Neo is shown to have powers outside of the Matrix- what does it all mean? And if things in the Matrix can alter the real world, is \\"the real world\\" another Matrix? \\"Revolutions\\" holds the answers to these questions, and holds the final chapter in the battle for Zion. It hits theaters November 5th of this year. For now, satisfy your cravings with a healthy dose of \\"Reloaded\\", and do watch the first one again.

6300216802|4.0|Gene Roddenberry's \\"Star Trek\\" is one of the most unique TV shows of its type. When it originally aired on NBC-TV between 1966 and 1969, it did no better than No. 35 in the Nielsen ratings, and was cancelled by NBC at the end of the '68-'69 season. But then a funny thing happened in the 1970s: Syndication. It was syndication that bought \\"Star Trek\\" a renewed following, making it a massive cult favorite whose followers came to be known as \\"Trekkies.\\" It was only a matter of time before the series made the leap from the small screen to the big screen. That happened in December 1979. <br />William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Nichelle Nichols, James Doohan, and Walter Koenig were reunited for what turned out to be the first of many successful \\"Star Trek\\" movies. And while this initial entry is somewhat imperfect, it nevertheless shows a fair amount of style.<br />The film focuses on the crew of a now-redesigned U.S.S. Enterprise, once more commanded by James Kirk (Shatner), heading out to confront a vast alien cloud making its way towards Earth on a mission of destruction. Shatner this time also runs into conflict with the new \\"Enterprise\\" commander (Stephen Collins) over his usurping of authority. But for the most part, the differences are put aside to confront this hideous threat to Earth's population. The alien force, which calls itself \\"V'ger\\", has taken over the body of one of the \\"Enterprise\\"'s medical officers (Persis Khambatta). As the crew learns, \\"V'ger\\" is in actuality an ancient \\"Voyager\\" space probe launched from Earth three centuries ago. It now makes what is obviously quite an impossible demand to meet: either it reunites with its \\"Creator\\", or it wipes out the \\"Creator\\"'s planet--Earth.<br />Originally budgeted at five million dollars by Paramount Pictures when production started in mid-1977, the size and scope of STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE grew very fast; and as a result, so too did the budget until it came out to a then nearly-unheard-of forty million. Much of that budget, not surprisingly, was spent on production design and the wide array of special effects. On that score, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE certainly looks every bit like it. And having a veteran director like Robert Wise, who made films like WEST SIDE STORY, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, THE HAUNTING, and THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN didn't hurt either. But the slow, leisurely pace of the film did turn off many filmgoers, even some Trekkies; in that sense, it closely resembles 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY more than it does, say, STAR WARS, let alone the original TV series. But even that can be a plus, because the series was not merely concerned with fancy visuals; it was concerned with deep human issues, and the movie itself concerns itself with an issue as old as humanity itself--God, or, The Creator.<br />The ultra-familiar cast was one of the reasons that STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE was a box office smash, despite its flaws. Another reason, of course, was the superb visual effects work supervised by Douglas Trumbull, John Dykstra and Richard Yuricich, which got nominated for an Oscar. The other high point of the film is Jerry Goldsmith's magnificent music score, with echoes of Debussy's \\"Nocturnes\\" and parts of Holst's \\"The Planets\\"; it is easily one of the greatest music scores produced in Hollywood during the last four decades that John Williams did NOT compose, and it too was recognized with an Oscar nomination.<br />Despite its extreme length (at 144 minutes) and somewhat slow pace, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE is still eminently watchable on all counts, and comes highly recommended for all science fiction film fans, even those who are not necessarily Trekkies.
B0000640VO|3.0|Amelie is an extraordinary film, and this makes the ordinariness of its conclusion profoundly unsatisfying.  Throughout the movie (known as Le Fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain in its country of origin, France) the characters are presented as delightfully quirky - Amelie enjoys running her hands through sackfuls of grain; her father likes lining up his shoes and polishing them; Nino keeps an album of photos discarded by their owners - so the ending, where Amelie and Nino leap into bed together, just as would happen in any other movie, is a huge letdown.<br />The premise is simple: one day Amelie Poulain finds a small box of 'treasures', which would appear to have been hidden by a small boy 40 years ago.  She decides to return the box to its owner, and if he is appreciative she will continue in her quest to help those around her.  <br />One of the strengths of the film is that - much like real life - nobody is 'normal'.  As well as being introduced to characters, we are also shown their idiosyncrasies and history. However, Amelie's running time of over two hours feels too long and one gets the impression that director Jean-Pierre Jeunet has attempted to fit too much into what is a light-weight movie.<br />It is also very funny in places, notably when Amelie takes revenge on an intolerant neighbour.  It is interesting how we can, after an interval of five years, look back on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and recall with a wry smile how completely it consumed our attention at the time.  Overall this is a charming and whimsical film (even if at times it is a little too aware of its quaintness), and certainly deserving of a more fitting finale.
0790729725|5.0|This is one of the best mob movies ever made.  With its great and true tale of one of the Lucchese family earners, it proves to be not only a great film, but also a great look into the world of organized crime.<BR>  The movie starts out right away with Henery and his two friends driving down the Jersey turnpike when their &quot;pakage&quot; in the trunk wakes up.  Right there you are hooked.<BR>  A lot of reviews said that this was a very violent movie, which it is, but in my opinion they kind of over exagerate.  The director shows the violence very real, and does not let the audience down with some watered down version, in my opinion, it is what sets this movie apart from the other mob movies, and into a league of its own.

B00007E8V4|5.0|A remarkable nu-metal band that have proven over the years that certainly they can conquer the music industry. I never realized that there ever was a band as great and cool out there as System of a Down. A \\"friend\\" of mine used to put System Of a Down on the phone a lot because he was really into them. I asked him what band it was and he said System of a down. As soon as I heard them, They were undescribable! It's so hard to explain how excelent they are! I only have 2 of their Cd's \\"Toxicity\\" and \\"Steal This Album\\" I'm planning on getting their first one soon. Lemme tell u a review of what I thought of this CD....<br />Chic 'n' Stu: Hilarious song, with a catchy beat. The funny thing about it is it talks about pizza! (lol) It grows on u real fast! 10/10<br />Innervision: Gets calmer right after Chic 'n' Stu but still a great song to listen to. wonderful lyrics. 10/10<br />Bubbles: wierd song, the first time u listen to it, also wierd lyrics and thats what makes it sooo good! 9/10<br />Boom!: I LOVE THIS SONG! anti-war thats what system of a down is all about! I sing this song durring class 2 just like Chic 'n' Stu! 10/10<br />Nuguns: Not that exciting, but It has a great intro and chorus, but it just lacks something..... 8/10<br />A.D.D: U have to really listen to the song over and over again to really like it. But, isnt' one of my favorites. 8/10<br />Mr. Jack: At first I didn't listen to this song because the intro was slow, but then when I fully listened to this song I just loved it! The end is the best part! 9/10<br />I-E-A-I-A-I-O: Funny, Funny ,Funny! Lyrics are weird and pretty stupid, but thats what makes it so great! good rythym (wild song)but I don't know what the song means????? (o well)9/10<br />36: One of my favorite songs!!!

(in the end) it's like when the highway song starts u think u're still listening to pictures.(before they start singing) 7/10<br />F**k The system: OMG!!!! MY FAVORITE SONG! It's the best. I love bands who sing about anti-war or anti-government. This song easily gets in your head! 11/10<br />Ego Brain: A slow song to catch your breath from all the other songs. But the chorus makes up for it! 9/10<br />Thetawaves: I don't know about this song.... Lacks something it's kinda... well, BORING 7/10 (great guitar solo there though)<br />Roulette: It's a slow song (it's ok) 8/10<br />Streamline: I like the Chorus a lot, the guitar solo in there is pretty cool there 2! 9/10  <br />Well there u have it, a review of this CD. I have never regreted buying this CD. After listening to them I've learned to love them after listeing to one song, I was hooked (\\"chop Suey\\" \\"TOXICITY\\") Now whnever they have a new CD out, I don't have to listen to samples I know it's going to be a cool CD. So why don't u go out and pick a copy of this CD. And while your at it make sure to buy \\"Toxicity\\" (and \\"System of a Down\\" I hear it's a great album 2!) HOPE U ENJOY!
B00009V7P8|1.0|I bought this CD because I heard the second track, volcano, and I was inspired, hoping against hope that if the rest of the tracks even resembled this smash, I had found a treasure. Also, I checked the reviews at this site and they were very complimentary. HOWEVER, this CD is one of the most disappointing albums I have purchased in years. The songs are extremely repetitive, and the words...cliche would be a kind description. The singer/songwriter is no doubt a virtuoso guitarist, but he opts perpetually for the road more travelled. It would appear that he is mistaken in his assumption that just because he feigns a strong emotion, he will be able to impart some depth of soul. Instead, he drones on with melodrama, snivelling heart break with the articulation of justin timberlake. I was looking for the rebirth of jeff buckley with the intuition of Aimee mann, and instead I found livingston taylor on zoloft.
B000002TYK|5.0|This record forever put an end to Dave's cornball image as \\"that long-haired dude that plays the drums in Nirvana\\". Of course, it's really hard to obtain any praise or recognition when you're stuck behind the drum kit while everyone else's attention is focused toward Kurt. Most of these songs were penned by Grohl while still with Nirvana, while others were written containing lyrics responding to Cobain's death. The Foos' debut is merely a collection of solo recordings by Dave with little if no assistance from the band, so it doesn't sound quite as polished and heavily produced as their latter records. Despite all of this, the results are very impressive for a solo musician. This is one of the reasons why this is my fave Foo Fighters release. It's modest and amateur, yet professional at the same time. The lyrics are clever, witty and humourous at times, yet simple enough that I could get inspiration and model my own writing after this. The music itself varies from joyous punk-pop outbursts like \\"This Is A Call\\" to nerd pop like \\"Big Me\\" or just indecipherable, screaming aggressive noise like \\"Weenie Beenie\\" or \\"Wattershed\\". I am still having a hard time deciding what song is my fave. I have a new one every day.<br />1. \\"This Is A Call\\" First single that helped propel the band into the spotlight. Strangley, it has no music video to accompany it.<BR>2. \\"I'll Stick Around\\" Another single, this one accompanied by a video. The emotional lyrics in the song deal with the sensitive subject of Kurt's death from Grohl's point of view as a concerned friend.<BR>3. \\"Big Me\\" This song was a smash hit in 1996. Dave Grohl claimed this song to be a \\"piss take\\" (parody) on squeaky clean nerd pop-rock and commercial jingles, hence the famous \\"Mentos\\" video.<BR>4. \\"Alone + Easy Target\\" This song sounds like Kurt Cobain could have co-written it. Nirvanesque sound and lyrics like \\"Metronome/I want out\\"? Hmmmmm...<BR>5. \\"Good Grief\\" This could have been a hit with the punk-pop crowd. Catchy garage sound with a laid-back verse, then turns into a total screaming chorus.<BR>6. \\"Floaty\\" Only Dave Grohl can write a song about balloon people and can still pull it off and make it sound good.<BR>7. \\"Weenie Beenie\\" Okay it's songs like these where I wish lyrics would have been included in the booklet because I don't understand a word he's saying, and what I'm translating is \\"I'm molasses hung in rent\\"? What the...? That can't be right!<BR>8. \\"Oh,George\\" A more laid-back song with a similar tempo and riff to \\"Big Me\\".<BR>9. \\"For All The Cows\\" The lyrics are funny and clever, and I can really relate. It's catchy, and a little jazzy at times.<BR>10. \\"X-Static\\" A slow song that's good to listen to while relaxing.<BR>11. \\"Wattershed\\" A hard rock song that backlashes at the pigheadedness of the music industry, and it also talks about Nirvana.<BR>12. \\"Exhausted\\" I found this song boring at first, but it kind of grew on me. Pearl Jam did a cover demo version of this song on Self-Pollution radio in 1994.

B000002MT0|2.0|The death of PRINCE? I'd say so. No more Paisley Park Records,discontent with Warners,time to release the wack stuff. Little does PRINCE knows (or cares) the wacks will hurt his fans more than it will hurt Warners (but I wrote this review too late for that). One word titles \\"Come\\",\\"Letitgo\\",\\"Space\\" and \\"Papa\\" are the good tunes. \\"Loose\\" and \\"Orgasm\\" are not. \\"Solo\\" PRINCE sings while someone plays the harp. A harp? PRINCE can't play the harp? If you're a PRINCE fan(atic),collect it. I said collect,not play it.
B00009V7RF|5.0|Wow, this album is one of those CDs that you keep on repeat in your CD player. BEP is easily one of the most versatile and lyrically amazing hip hop groups out there. I was a little hesitant about Fergie, the new member, when I saw her on the cover, but those doubts were taken care of within the first few tracks- she's AWESOME! \\"The Boogie That Be\\" and \\"Hey Mama\\" are great tracks.<br />Her vocals add even more variation to an already well-rounded group. I always liked when they collaborated with Esthero, and now their rhymes have even more musical flourishes and touches.<br />There will always be \\"fans\\" out there who say \\"Man, their older albums were better,\\" but I think Elephunk is just as good as \\"Bridging the Gap\\" and \\"Behind the Front.\\" Think of it as a trilogy of phunk, y'all.<br />Get this album if you like your hip hop real phunky and stinky.
B00008J4P5|3.0|There's a few great, catchy songs on here, but beyond that, the rest is rather bland. I know tons of other people love it saying how great and creative the White Stripes are, but they're full of it. Not that I don't like the band, I just don't happen to be part of this new trend of liking bands just because they're doing something different with their music (which they're not), doesn't mean it's good. Anyways, if you don't already own a White Stripes album, get Red Blood Cells first. If you already own it and you like it, then I suggest this one. Just don't expect it to be the &quot;ground breaking album of the year&quot; so many say it is.
B0000035E7|5.0|When you buy this CD, it should have a gray sticker on the front of the CD that says, This is Nirvana's first album. When I first got this CD I was a little hesitant but then I got it and relaxed. I automatically loved Floyd the Barber which starts out:Hello Cobain come on in/Floyd observes my hairy chin. That was a sample dude!um,but actually on the internet you can go to Nirvana/lyrics and you'll find every Nirvana song that's in there. This is a great CD for 1989 overall! Sifting is a good long song and Downer is a fast song! When you get this CD, you will be a laundry Bleach fan! Just kidding! I instantly became a Nirvana fan with this CD and so will you. Tell your friends,family and your dog about this CD.Buy it now PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Why are you still sitting there!?!?
B000006NX5|5.0|Not only could Barry sing, but he could write, arrange, and conduct music just as beautifully. Just listen to this awesome CD. Each song is a brilliant masterpiece. My favorite has always been the title track, but I love all the others too. \\"Barry's Theme\\" starts the album off perfectly, while \\"Love's Theme\\" (Barry's first number one hit) closes it out. \\"Midnight and You\\" and \\"Baby Blues\\" absolutely ooze with sensuality and sex. These songs are both romantic and uplifting. You'll enjoy this CD alone in the dark, or driving on the highway. If you love good music, it's a must.
1400034779|5.0|I bought this book to take on vacation, but couldn't wait and I'm so glad that I couldn't resist the temptation.  I love the story of this beautiful independent woman who does what she wants with her life.  The author made me feel that I was there in Botswana with the main character who &quot;detectives&quot; with love, wisdom, kindness and humor.  This is true...I read it through once and then immediately read it again...the language is beautiful and I liked the twists.  I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK 100 PERCENT and I'm going to buy all the sequels tomorrow...so I'll have some guaranteed good reading on the plane and on my two weeks in Europe... When I'm in the room in Switzerland overcoming jet lag, I'll be in Botswana!
B00005JM09|2.0|TEMINATER 3 \\"RISE OF THE MACHINES\\"  IS A MOVIE FOR PEOPLE HOLDING THE HOPE OF THE FIRST ONE.  THE ONLY THING EXCITING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS HOW HOT TX WAS (KRISSTANA LOKEN).  THE PLOT WAS GARBAGE AND SO WAS THE ACTING.  AN 80 YEAR OLD ARNOLD IS NOT IMPRESSIVE.  THE NOBODY CAST TO THIS MOVIE IS UNBELIEVABLE.  THIS IS SUPPOSE TO BE THE TEMINATER.  WHERE ARE ALL THE BIG NAMES, OH WAIT THEY READ THE SCRIPT AND DECIDED THEY DID NOT WANT TO BOMB THEIR CAREERS.  THIS MOVIE IS REALLY HURT BY THE ABSENCE OF HAMILTON BECAUSE SHE BROUGHT PASSION TO THE MOVIE LIKE NO OTHER PERSON IN THIS MOVIE.  SO WITH THIS MOVIE I WILL BLOCK IT OUT ALONG WITH T2 AND PRETEND SARAH CONNER DRIVING OFF IN HER JEEP WITH THAT PICTURE WAS THE END OF THE TERMINATER
B000002HK4|5.0|&quot;Change Of Seasons&quot; is a fine song. A fine song. An ominous acoustic intro builds up and up as keyboards and bass noodle around it, until it all culminates in a &quot;Pull Me Under&quot;-esque explosion of metal guitar. Four minutes later, the first vocals come in, and the ride really begins. The song moves to a quieter section and then another set of jazzy instrumentals and solos. The high mark is reached at 18:30, when the rockin' guitars come back in to support a crazy keyboard solo that leads into the main riff, and the eventual finale: &quot;I will live on!&quot; Then, the acoustic opening melody closes the song. An epic if there ever was one. <br />Dream Theater tried this again with &quot;Six degrees Of Inner Turbulence,&quot; but that song is divided into 8 sections, each so distinct that that it actually doesn't flow as a song. James LaBrie is in fine form here, singing operatically and emotionally, fitting each of the song's movements as they should be. Derek Shirinian proves here that he was not DT's weakest keyboard player. In fact, I like him better than Jordan Rudess, the new guy. Petrucci and Portnoy are their usual selves, showing off to the point of overplaying, but on this song, each shred solo or double bass volley works and fits, so bravo. John Myung is underrated as usual, as much of the song is driven by his brilliant basswork(see him live, he upstages Petrucci easily).<br />The lyrics here aren't bad, which is unusual, considering they were written by Portnoy, the weakest lyricist in the band. They deal with an old man coming to terms with mortality and the prospect of his family carrying on without him. He realizes, watching the sunset with his son, that he will live on through his posterity, and his soul finds peace in that.<br />A truly great effort. Catchy, sprawling, technical, emotional, well-written, well-played, well done.<br />The live covers are an added bonus. &quot;Big Medley&quot; is good, 'cause it's got Queen, Genesis,and Pink Floyd. For the guys praising LaBrie's amazing vocal range on the deep Purple cover, uh, sorry, but that's actually Bruce Dickinson. He sang all the Purple covers. Shame they couldn't have put &quot;Smoke On The Water&quot; instead, or the Rush and Yes covers with Steve Howe or the Metallica cover with Barney Greenway. Bad choices, but I'll give the benefit of the doubt. Five stars. An excellent accompaniment to Images and Words.
B00005JM1F|3.0|Old School is not the best of its genre, but it's better than average and worthy of a Friday Night checkout.  The basic storyline is simple enough: three thirtyish guys start a fraternity in a college town, to prevent a foreclosure on one of the guys' house. Pretty thin premise, but Wilson, Ferrell and Vaughn provide a fair number of laughs as the plot unfolds.<br />The trailers make this movie out to be grosser than it actually is. Except for one tasteless (but funny) sequence featuring comedian Andy Dick as a red-wigged \\"b-job\\" coach, there's not much that's really very raunchy. You get a minute or so of Will Ferrell's butt, and a few seconds of bare female breasts, and that's about it.<br />Overall, Old School is a good-hearted movie about male early-midlife crisis, that happens to feature a lot of drinking and frat-house shenanigans. This is a high three-star entry, not quite worth four stars, but a \\"thumbs up\\" nonetheless.
B00005JLRT|3.0|I passed on this one theatrically, even though I am a die-hard Trekker of many years.  I finally got around to seeing it after it was released on DVD, and while I found it very entertaining, I didn't think it was that much moreso than a well-done episode of either TNG or DS9.  All in all, I think people who are not into the Trek universe will find it a little weak, and the rest of us will enjoy it for what it is - a fun adventure story with some of our favorite interplanetary heroes.

067941133X|3.0|Use the money you would spend on buying this audiobook to buy the movie -- when they say &quot;abridged&quot;, they mean it. This audiobook contains only two cassettes, and while the reading is EXCELLENT, you don't get much more of the book than you get in the movie. So buy the DVD -- you'll get behind the scenes stuff and recipes too. And of course, if you haven't already, get the book. But borrow this audiobook from your library first, to see if you really want to pay for it. Wish Ms. Flagg would do an unabridged version -- I'd pay good money for that!
0060559225|4.0|Paul Coelho's &quot;Warrior of the Light: A Manual&quot; has been translated from Portuguese by Margaret Jull Costa.  The copyright page notes that the book was first published in Brazil in 1997, and an author's note notes that most of the material in the book was first published in a newspaper column.<br />&quot;Warrior&quot; is a guide to living a balanced and meaningful life.  The text takes the form of a series of inspirational verses bracketed by a parable-like story.  Coelho's approach is interfaith and multicultural: along the way he cites the I Ching, John Bunyan, Lao Tzu, Jesus, Gandhi, Arabic proverbs, and others.  God is often mentioned, but not in a religion-specific sense.  Along the way such topics as faith, meditation and prayer are dealt with.<br />Quite a bit of the book seems rather obvious and feels like I've read it before; at times the tone is a bit too &quot;New Age-y&quot; for my tastes.  But there are also some really thoughtful and striking passages, and a welcome touch of wit.  The book is sometimes paradoxical.  &quot;Warrior&quot; is a contemporary text that reminds me of the tradition of the Dhammapada, Marcus Aurelius' &quot;Meditations,&quot; and other such spiritual/instructional texts.  It's a hopeful and generous-spirited book.
0064407667|1.0|With all the hype surrounding this book and the entire series for that matter, I thought that I would be enjoying a really good book and then continue on with the rest of the series.  WRONG.  This is by far THE worse children's book that I have ever read.  Parents don't waste your money on this book. It is not even worth the time to go the library and check this book out.<br />I do believe that a junior high student could easily write a much better book.  The grammar is awful - flow and transition from one paragraph to the other is missing - the subject material does not even make sense - thoughts are scattered - character development is nil - and 99.9% of the book is boring.  I forced myself to finish the book and struggled the entire way to do so.<br />But MOST IMPORTANTLY, this book is depressing, filled with negativity, constant threats of killing the children, perverse humor, and inappropriate adult themes.  Joy, happiness and love are definitely missing in this book. This is not a book to build a child's self esteem or instill messages of self worth or confidence.<br />There is absolutely nothing to like about this book.  I would urge parents to steer their children away from all of the books in the series - like another reviewer said - there are so many other BETTER books out there to read. Lemony Snickett is not one of them.<br />If I could, I would give this book a negative 10.
B0000029GA|5.0|Yo, this album is a classic. You cannot consider yourself a true hip hop head if you don't have this. When I think, best rap album, or must have album, this pops into my mind first. Nas out did himself. This is truily one of the greatest rap albums ever.
B00009V7T2|4.0|Cedric Bixler Zavala has the purest metal wail. Like Ronnie James Dio or Geddy Lee, it's eerily feminine and masculine at the same time. It's the voice of legend, when we don't have such voices any more. But just imagine Dio wailing, \\"Exoskeletal junction at the railroad delayed!\\" Or Geddy crying, \\"Transoceanic depth in this earth, in this cenotaph!\\" ...and you've got an idea of what the Mars Volta are about.<br />It's a head trip. It's metal without the posturing. ...Or, not exactly without the posturing; big guitars are still present, solos, wailing, ranting, progging out. But the basslines are frogged in funk, not your typical metal basslines, and sometimes there's conga drums and a hint of keyboards. Beyond that, what the Mars Volta have in spades is melody - in the form of Zavala's amazing voice. Soaring above juggernauts of sound and huge, powerful songs (\\"Roulette Dares\\" clocks in at 7:31; \\"Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt\\" manages 8:42), he wails like a banshee and creates moments of ethereal beauty. Check the chorus of \\"Eriatarka.\\" In between powerful, shrieking verses (\\"trackmarked amoeba lands craft, cartwheel of scratches, dress the tapeworm as pets\\") is a moment of haunting beauty, on par with Sigur Ros or Tim Buckley. It doesn't matter that he's singing \\"stung the slang of a gallows bird, sanctioned a dead letter pure.\\" It's gorgeous, for the few moments it exists. Then the song devolves into a brief prog rock reggae dub interlude.<br />That's where the Mars Volta lose the plot, as far as I'm concerned. They can get too slogged down in noise and noodling, as they do on \\"Cicatriz ESP.\\" They try for inventive, but get lost along the way. Somehow they come out the other side with a little Santana-fied \\"rock y rol,\\" an unnecessary diversion. \\"This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed\\" is not nearly as powerful or melodic as \\"Inertiatic ESP\\" or \\"Drunkship of Lanterns\\" (two more album standouts), and there's too many effects on Zavala's voice. They get it back with \\"Televators,\\" a lighter-waving slow track that actually seems to be about an alien landing, or perhaps an alien birth, rather than the typical love song. But on \\"Take the Veil,\\" the melody is lost and the backbone is mired too heavily in \\"that Chili Peppers sound\\"(TM), courtesy of Flea and John Frusciante, who helped out the MV in the studio. The song devolves, once again, into another bit of Santana-fied \\"rock y rol,\\" but this time it's a more welcome diversion.<br />While not completely satisfying, this cd is definitely an event horizon. The Mars Volta are a force to be reckoned with.  There are Moorish druids on the islands of the Spanish archipelago, dancing in their graves because their long lost sons have returned from beyond the astral plane to create this mythical music. The rocks of Stonehenge weep.ors,\\" a lighter-waving slow track that actually seems to be about an alien landing, or perhaps an alien birth, rather than the typical love song.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I started watching Firefly I had low expectations...  Scifi with a western flavor?  The big selling point on Fox was that it was from Joss Whedon and unfortunately at the time I started watching I was not yet a Whedon fan.  I enjoyed the first episode I saw and continued watching and then suddenly I realized that I was head over heals in love with this show!  And then Fox in their infinite wisdom decided to cancel it...  Firefly is wonderfully written, the stories are exciting and smart and you care deeply about the characters.  I can't recommend this show highly enough.  I will always be grateful for having found this wonderful show, even though I will always be sad that it was pulled off the air *way* too early.  Through Firefly I have now become a devoted Joss Whedon fan and will watch anything he is involved in.
0783233477|4.0|I watched this movie because the cable was out and I was bored as a gourd.  It was slow.  There was too much talking.  There were few instances of multiculturalism is the movie (blacks, lationos, asians).  I almost turned it off several times.<br />However, I stuck with it.  I found myself engaged.  I found myself laughing at times.  And by the end of the movie, I was openly weeping.  Yes, I got caught up and found myself incredibly moved by the ending. The tenderness and human emotion blew me away!  The final exchanges between Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins (&quot;Should I be scared?&quot;  &quot;Not a man like you.&quot;) WORE ME OUT!   <br />Would I watch it again?  Probably not.  Did I hate it?  Not by a long shot.   It was a well crafted movie.
B000099T2L|3.0|High expectations arrive with Beyonce Knowles' solo bow DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE, not the least of which is living up to  all the hype that follows her around as frontwoman for Destiny's Child.  The opening four tracks find the singer at the top of her uptempo game--'Crazy In Love' is the anthem of the summer, and both 'Naughty Girl' and 'Baby Boy'(with the ubiquitous Sean Paul) follow close behind in the catchy department(though there's nothing here that equals the intoxicating and unjustly overlooked soundtrack gem 'Work It Out').  Unfortunately, this is where the singer throws us a curveball--the mid-section, and in fact much of the rest of the disc, is made up almost exclusively of mid- to slow-tempo ballads, which would be fine except for the small issue of them being a little on the boring side.  Even her duet with Luther Vandross doesn't do much other than add a little star-power window dressing to the proceedings.  Ultimately, this isn't a bad first set, but personally I don't think it's half as interesting as fellow  Child Kelly Rowland's SIMPLY DEEP.
B00008PC2O|3.0|The T2 Extreme Edition has its benefits on disc one BUT it has virtually no special features except for DVD-ROM, 2 crapy featurettes and the regular version of the film in ROM form on disc 2 but even that is nothing in comparison to the Ultimate Edition DVD BECAUSE the Ultimate Edition HAS TONS OF FEATURES plus the Extreme edition only has the extended version of the film on disc 1 unless you use the easter egg (hidden special option) and the regular version on disc 2 which can only be accessed through your computer as I said earlier so if you do or don't have the Ultimate Edition, get that instead of the \\"Extreme Edition\\"

6305736650|5.0|I'm not about to waste your time, or mine, reviewing the &quot;movie&quot;. If you've seen it, you KNOW it's one of the greatest movies of all time (many list it as Number 1). If you haven't seen it, then buy it.<br />The real question for me, is it worth getting the DVD if you already have Casablanca on VHS?<br />The answer, for me at least, is an unqualified yes. If you have a good crisp TV, with three comb filtering, such as a Sony Wega (I have a very good Sanyo), then there will be a much crisper and detailed picture. You can see it early on, particularly in the map of Europe and when Bogert signs a chit. Probably the BEST visual improvement of the VHS is the cloying and annoyingly overdone &quot;soft focus&quot; shots of Ingrid Bergman are not nearly so obvious or overdone in the DVD version. Why? I don't know, but perhaps the lack of crispness in the VHS causes the soft focus blur to be overly pronounced, like driving a car at night with an astigmatism which smears the headlights of oncoming cars.<br />Additionally the dynamic range of the DVD is much more pronounced than the VHS and/or less compressed, so quietly spoken passages are much quieter and musical passages louder. <BR>(This may NOT be a good thing, however, for the hard of hearing.&lt;G&gt;)
6304884419|5.0|A Bronx Tale produced n directed by Robert Deniro n Chazz Palmenteri <--Cant spell is such an original movie and I personally will never get tired of watching it. \\"Sonny\\" played by Chazz Palmenteri portrays the \\"bad guy\\" who ran the neighborhood and everyone feared him, but deep down i think he really did care, and i think he really wanted a son thats why he took a liking to \\"Calergero\\" \\"Lorenzo's son. The whole plot of the movie takes place after Calergero witnesses Sonny shoot a man and he didnt rat on him so sonny was grateful and teaches him everything he knows and wants him to be smart and not do what he does. He treats \\"C\\" like his own son and i think thats one of the reasons Lorenzo and Sonny didnt get along.

B0000062FN|5.0|This is the third Santana release. Do yourself a huge favor and buy it. For those of us who have had it for the last 30 years I need not say more.
B00008BRB5|5.0|Yes, I know they started in 78 or 79, but their sound is definitely 80s. At first, I didn't care for the Police very much, due to the fact that the radio only ever played singles, and I found the singles to be unoriginal tripe. Then, one day, I borrowed Synchronicity from my brother's CD rack, and was amazed by the multiple dimensions of both music and lyrics. Here is a band that takes the raw energy of punk and hard rock, fuses it with the rhythms of jazz and reggae, and adds a twist of pop to make it easy for people to listen to. <br />When the very first track started playing, I was mesmerized by the incessant pulse of Stewart Copeland's drumming, as well as Sting's lyrics: catchy, and yet delivering a deep message about how the duality of human existence is both predictable and unpredictable. Good stuff. Of course, Andy Summers shines through in many places, especially on the much underrated Mother, his contribution to the album. His guitar riffs on that achieve the same addictive pulse as Copeland's drumming. Of course, he also delivers beautifully in King of Pain and Walking in Your Footsteps, the latter of which is raw, scratchy, and very primal.<br />The lyrical content of the other songs are not standard pop fare, as well, dealing with man's role as the dominant species (Walking in Your Footsteps), the nature of religion and it's use, if any in the modern world (O My God), how technology changes the structure of family from what it was in the 50s (Synchronicity II), and the difference between love and obsession (Every Breath You Take). I used to dislike that last song when I heard it ont he radio, writing it off as your basic love song. But the lyrics are actually darker than I gave the band credit for, and thematically it's a perfect fit to the album.<br />In another review on this page, someone mentioned that musically, Murder by Numbers does not fit well at the end of the album. But, as a song about man's unique trait of murdering his fellow man (taken to new levels in modern society through things like culture and politics), it definitely connects with the dark retrospectives preceding it. Musically, it's a bit more experimental, so while I'm glad they included it on the CD, it might have gone better on the A-Side, in between the tracks written by Copeland and Summers. But, on the other hand, after the soft fare preceding it, it was nice to finish with a deliciously sadistic little bang. So it would have been fine anywhere.<br />All in all, I definitely had new respect for the Police after hearing this album. Forget the solo efforts of Sting, in which he sank deeper and deeper into the abyss of folk and pop. Sting was at his creative zenith when he was with the Police, and the most diverse example of this is Synchronicity. For anyone wanting to know more about this band, it's the best way to start (anyone who likes this should also check out Ghost In The Machine).
B0000A1RJI|5.0|For starters: I don't know if Klaus Badelt or Hans Zimmer was responsible for the rousing main theme of the movie (aka Jack Sparrow's theme) but whoever it was, THANK YOU.  Brilliant job.<br />This is a wonderful, wonderful soundtrack.  As others have noted, when I first heard that epic theme blasting out as Jack approached the harbor, I wanted nothing more than to commandeer a ship and devote my life to piracy (ahoy!).  I went out and bought the CD... and... well...<br />Disney did a very poor job in organizing it, IMO.  There's only about forty minutes of music on this CD - I haven't had the luxury of seeing the movie as often as I want to analyze missing music, but I'm fairly certain several key scenes with good music don't have a place on the soundtrack.  Further, the exciting and wonderful end credits... which I stayed in the theater for... aren't here.  The beginning of the end credits - &quot;He's a Pirate&quot; - is there, but it cuts off after only minute and thirty seconds.  Arg!  <br />I'm giving this CD five stars anyway because the music really IS good enough to forgive the abridged version.  For those that would like to see a full-length CD released, I recommend writing Disney and asking about it.  This is a marvelous, marvelous soundtrack and it belongs on the shelf of anyone who loves a rousing score.
B000063TNH|5.0|Can Criterion make a bad DVD?  Probably not.  These folks are constantly making the best DVD's on the market, and their treatment of Traffic is nothing short of amazing.  If you own the single disc release, time to update.  Three commentary tracks, 25 deleted scenes, an awesome multi-angle feature and so much more...Criterion are the kings of DVD releases.  A must own for fans of the film and also for DVD fanatics.
B000006TRV|5.0|This album is full of kick-... songs like In The Flesh, My Young Lust (Aswome guitar from Gilmore), Mother, Hey You, Another Brick In The Wall (One of the best Pink songs ever), Run Like Hell (The opening minute is some of the best music I've ever heard from Pink), Waiting For The Worms, Is Anybody Out There?, <BR>and save the best for last, Comfortably Numb, the best Pink song of all time, Gilmore's best solo ever, perfect lyics from both Waters and Gilmore(I've memorized the whole song). This is to me a very large piece of Water's never-ending tribute to Barrett. Everytime I listen to the whole thing I feel like destroying something. This is by far the album that is enflunenced by Waters the most with his obssession with insanity. Probably the 3rd best concept albums next to Dark Side and Wish. Aswome album.

I couldn't put this book down and found myself walking up and down stairs and eating dinner while reading this book. If you liked the movie, you'll love the book. It wasn't hard to make the mental leap to place Rob in London instead of Chicago, despite all the British colloquialisms. And John Cusack kept up the running narration in my head, despite Rob being English, because I think he was cast perfectly as Rob in the movie and is more or less my image of him. <br />The book is the life of a thirtysomething, not-too-successful man, who collects records, makes top 5 lists about everything (Cheers episodes, songs, records, jobs, worst breakups of his life, etc), owns a failing record store with two part-time employees who never left and when his girlfriend leaves him for the guy upstairs, he embarks on a 'what does it all mean?' review of his life and his past relationships. Hornby has perfected the male confessional style of writing and anyone who's read Hornby's other books will recognize that he's written himself very much into this book, but not to the extent in Fever Pitch, his book about his long devotion to the English football team, Arsenal. Read the book. Even if you can't find something of yourself or your life in it, it's humorous and interesting enough to keep you reading.
B00005JKES|4.0|A classic of television this release is marred only by the perplexing omission of the first episode. I am not referring to the pilot. When Twin Peaks was first aired by the BBC in the u.k. there was a first episode different from the pilot, which I still have on VHS.
B00004Y9PP|2.0|This movie tries, it really does.  It makes a whole-hearted effort to recapture the horror, claustrophobia, and emotional turmoil of Ridley Scott's &quot;Alien.&quot;  But it just fails.<br />There are two basic problems with this film.  First is the monster.  In &quot;Alien,&quot; we had a man in a suit; in &quot;Pitch Black&quot; we have computer-generated creatures.  The Alien, designed by H.R. Giger, actually looked like it was in the environment, because it was, giving the actors something to react to.  The creature in this film, by John Cox's Creature Workshop, doesn't, despite a marathon technicial staff.  It's entirely too obvious, too often, that the actors are reacting to the air, expecting the thing to be matted in later.<br />The other problem lies with the characters.  The actors themselves do an admirable job, reflecting the known skill and acclaim of folks like Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, and Keith David.  The problem is that we have no sympathetic point-of-view character to hold onto, and thus we don't much care if they live or die.  The only characters we have who aren't at least somewhat objectionable are a group of Muslims on the hajj, and as most of them have no English, they can't serve as the audience surrogate in the action.<br />The movie is, mostly, visually beautiful.  The location work, shot in the same desert as &quot;Mad Max,&quot; makes for wonderful atmospherics.  The shift from relentless sun to total darkness (think Asimov's &quot;Nightfall) is done mostly well, with a few scientific errors easily overlooked in a movie.  And the creatures, when they hold the screen themselves, are remarkably well done.<br />This doesn't make up, however, for the manifest weaknesses of this film.  It tries to hard to ape elements of successful past sci-fi horror, and it just doesn't hold up.<br />A sequel is due out next year.  Here's hoping we're at least given a POV character we can hang onto and understand.
0452282152|5.0|WONDERFUL!!!  I found myself reading this book in a day, unable to put it down!  The author made this story so real, you begin to wonder if this is really how the painting came to be.  I found myself flipping from the pages to the cover (the painting) and back again.  LOVELY!<BR>Jennifer
B0000669JL|2.0|Unfortunately, this newly remastered version substitutes the original single versions of &quot;One Love&quot;,&quot; &quot;Buffalo Soldier&quot;, and &quot;Could You Be Loved&quot; for the album versions.  While they are still great, why change the versions for the remastered release?  Although the sound quality of the original is not as good as the remastered version, I suggest hanging on to it for these reasons.

B00005JMC6|5.0|Wow, this movie is awesome! It is about a girl named Pai, who thinks she can be the leader of her tribe. Her grandfather doesn't think so, he thinks the leader would have been her twin brother, who died when she was born. Pai then decides to try to become the leader anyway. This is a great movie, with a good message and awesome acting. I highly reccomend you see it!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin Degraw's new album Chariot is definantly worth checking out! I was lucky enough to run into Gavin at a festival a couple of months ago and got to hear him sing...he was amazing! His voice is beautiful and his piano playing skills are also pretty impressive! If you are into good music and like stuff that moves you, then you should definantly buy this album or at least check it out!
0393057658|5.0|To anyone who has wondered why Oakland GM Billy Beane seems to perform miracles, or more importantly, anyone who truly values statistics and logic over Sportscenter highlights, this book is for you.  To anyone who thinks the regular season shows true talent, while the playoffs are a crapshoot, this book is for you.<br />This book chronicles the Oakland A's in three aspects -  Billy Beane's own personal history and style, his scientific and more accurate view on recruiting and trading, and the lives of a few A's players themselves.   He also delves into the history and explanation of Sabrmatrics, the relatively new and better way of looking at baseball statistics.<br />Billy Beane's philosophy is based on high base percentage, good pitching statistics, and disregards speed, power, arm-strength, or any other characteristic that the typical recruits look for.  While other teams only concentrates on potential and tools, Billy exploits this inefficiency and year after years constructs a great baseball team.  Instead of game, he approaches it as if it was market, and reacts accordingly.  Lewis does a great job expanding on this and paints Billy Beane as a man who can think outside the box.<br />The most intriguing part is when Lewis chronicles the A's draft.   He follows them through this ordeal, and details the strategy of drafting and signing those players.<br />After reading this quick book, I can now say I'm Billy Beane fan.  I  cannot help but respect Billy Beane and the other statisticians that have revolutionized baseball.  With all the insight and thought presented, it has helped me appreciate baseball as truly the greatest sport of them all.
B00005A0N5|5.0|To all that find this album to be the worst that Nightwish is capbable of...think again.  Not only is Oceanborn their best, but it demands a great understanding and level of intelligence to fully apprieciate the metal composition. so to all of you that think nightwish isnt metal enough...let me tell you know, tool isnt metal, they are a mainstream nightmare. i like all kinds of metal except for bands that have repetative guitar riffs and do nothing but scream. there is nothing clever about screaming bands and there isnt any variety. bands like mushroomhead, give me a break. nightwish delivers diversity and a full range of melodies that will make anyone sway back and forth. i myself have been a fan since angels fall first. not one of their best but for all this time nightwish has never let me down. and for the record, tarja's voice is way better than that goth chick from lucuna coil, she sounds more like amy from evanescence. get a clue. nightwish is here to stay and will always have a special place in A TRUE METAL FANS HEART. if you dont like nightwish you arent truly a metal fan, case and point.
B00005JLTN|4.0|It never ceases to amaze me how some people think that they are demonstrating their incisive, critical capabilities when they try to inform us other poor incapable viewers about supposed plot shortcomings or other similar failings.  Do they really think that I will or will not purchase the DVD based on their evaluations?? When it really comes down to it, film enjoyment is a matter of personal taste, notwithstanding what I am told is a weakness.  One person's downside is another's up.  So, it doesn't matter to me if one of your reviewers said that the movie should not have tried to be \\"Philosophy 101\\" (it wasn't), or that the \\"orgy scene\\" was hokey (it was), or that Keanu Reeves' acting was \\"wooden\\" (maybe).  When the rubber hits the road, the movie was \\"kick-[butt]\\" in terms of CG and great fight scenes, and being pleasing to the eye.  It continued the story, entertained, had a great score, and had a real cliffhanger of an ending.  At the film's conclusion, I was left saying to myself that I can't wait for \\"Revolutions.\\"  What more could one want from good entertainment?
B000089RVX|4.0|This is one of the best CD's I have purchased in a long while.  It seems like it has been a decade or more since the days of Patty Smythe and Pat Benetar.  Has the world forgotten that women can rock too?  There seems to be a dearth of rock bands with female leads, only corporate fabrications.  Evanescence fills that void.  Hats off to Ben Moody (he looks a little like Fred Durst) for &quot;finding&quot; Amy Lee.  I am sure she would have surfaced somewhere or another but I am very grateful she debuted with Evanescence.  Her voice is so powerful and penetrating.  Sometimes too penetrating.  The only reason I gave Fallen four stars instead of five is that it is just too edgy for my wife to listen to (she cannot handle anything with much harder than Bruce) so I am limited to listening to the CD on my computer.<br />The whole CD is excellent.  Some CD's have only a few good songs and a lot of chaff.  Vanessa Carlton's CD (yes, different genre) is like that, two or three good songs, a lot of forgettable ones and a several really bad ones.<br />Almost every song on Fallen is great.  Bring Me to Life and Going Under are getting the most play on the radio and for good reason.  I love the way Lee's voice can not only handle but slay low and high ranges.  The heavy feedback guitars on Going Under and My Last Breath are great.  The guitars kick in ten seconds into My Last Breath and it is like a jump start.  The video for Going Under is tripping.  Haunted is, well, haunting.  Tourniquet is a little heavy but after having read an interview in which Lee explained the inspiration for the song I can appreciate what the band was trying to accomplish.  They were successful, it is just not a song that you feel like dwelling on.  The best song in my opinion is Hello.  Amy Lee's voice soars in this ballad of the mind trying to soothe the soul.  Her voice is positively angelic.  I highly recommend this CD to anyone that enjoys good rock and can handle lyrics with weight and import.
0375707972|4.0|I needed to read this book for my summer reading when I was in high school. When I start reading, I felt it's a easy book to read, the English was not hard at all. But the first few chapters are definitely weired because an 15 year old boy have sex with an old woman. In some way I think it's really sick! But once you get over that chapters, the novels starts getting your attenton. The old woman just left boy without saying anything, and when the boy next time see her is in the court. At that point, you will start wondering what happened to this old woman. Of course there are a lot stuff need to do with this woman's background. She was a Nazi and killed people. She feels guilty! This novel has something to do with human's guilt and also people cares how other pepople in the society look at them. Once you start understaind all these points, you will think it's a pretty sad novel. In some way I think the way author represent this book is quite unique, you won't feel you are reading a text or history event books. It's worth reading it!
B000069AUI|5.0|It seems that the band has made a worthy effort, but honestly I would just like to say that I found 'Clocks' to be breathtaking. I especially appreciated the piano part, which has inspired me to work harder in that area. What a beautiful song! ~C

B00003CXA3|5.0|I just can't get enough of this movie. The first time I watched this I was plain dazed. It all made sense to me. I've seen it four times since. I want the movie poster. <BR>The car chase is the best ever, I think better than the one in 'Bullitt.' You must see it to believe it. I think this movie made me crazy.
B00008K78M|5.0|This DVD is two hours or so of non-stop entertainment.  Pausini's voice and music are exciting and the crowd at the Fila Center in Milano is with her every step and word of the way.  The videography made me feel almost like I was there.  It contains a good balance of what is happening on stage and in the crowd. Pausini appears in three different sets of clothes and is very beautiful in all of them.
B00000JZIK|4.0|Whenever I'm on a boat, I think of 'The Usual Suspects'. Although it's quite confusing, it all comes together at the end. The movie is told through the eyes of clubfooted Kevin Spacey. Not for the sensitive moviegoer; this movie is rated 'R' for a reason.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I haven't been that big a fan of the Stripes before this CD--in fact I bought it for my wife, who is a big fan--but this album forced me to sign on. Jack White is GOD--plays like Jimmy Page AND signs like Robert Plant (sort of ) AT THE SAME TIME!  The songs here are terrific, quite varied yet cohering together as an album.  The classic rock moves are there, but with a post punk intimacy present that begs the question--is this a classic Modern Rock album, or a modern Classic Rock album?  Fact is it's both, and as far as I know the White Stripes are the only band plumbing this kind of terrain with this much artistic depth.  Classic or modern, this album is TIMELESS!  And thank God (i.e. Jack White) for the return of grungy slide guitar!  NASSTAYY!!!
0446677450|5.0|I have read a lot of the other financial books that teach frugality, cut up your credit cards and so on and lived by those principles and was able to amass some savings and investments.I also used to follow the normal way of investing which is to listen to your broker.Recently and against the advice of others, I started to apply the RDPD advice. I use my credit cards, I kept my day job while starting a business in my spare time. I am learning how to invest and am prepared when I go to financial people like brokers. I have also found a ton of tax deductions that I didn't know about before which my tax preparer didn't know because they go to school to fill out tax forms.I highly recommend RD/PD to help you get on the path to financial freedom.As for the 1 star bashers, there must be a reason why they repeatedly pst the same nonsense and unfortunately it has nothing to do with helping you. I wonder what their net worth is?
B000002BFZ|5.0|I was not a huge Pearl Jam fan back when \\"Jeremy\\" was the hit. \\"Better Man\\" from Vitalogy made me prick up my ears, but this album turned me around and truly impressed me, with creative heavy rock and lyrics. Even the album art is creative, heavy and beautiful. I don't think they've equaled it yet for consistency, although their subsequent albums have each had a couple of great songs.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Anything that has been released into a movie form, that originally was a comic book or video game, usually have great story lines.  Well, this movie rocked!  I have watched it a couple of times, and I haven't fallen asleep or read a book.  You have to like action movies to enjoy this one.  There is no real drama behind the movie.  If anyone says something bad about this movie, it is most likely that they did not even see it.
B00005JM1Y|5.0|This movie was hiliarious!  I came to the movie expecting the usual Rowan Atkinson boring schitck but instead was quite surprised at just how versatile this actor is!  I laughed so much that I only felt slightly embarrassed by it for all of 3 seconds after I realized people around me were laughing just as hard!  <br />Excellent comedy to take in on a weeknight!
B00008AWOD|5.0|Before I got this album, I knew nothing about Placebo.  I had heard a couple of the songs from the album on msn radio, and the music store I was in had nothing on my wish list other than this and a Chemical Brothers album.  Feeling more in the mood for rock than electronica, I went with this, and I know that I made the right choice.<br />Placebo is a rock band with a definite punk influence, great guitarwork, occasionally repetitive but poetic lyrics, and an incredible lead singer.  Brian Molko has what very people in the industry seem to have: an original voice.  His voice can best be described as feminine, especially in a world full of Eddie Vedder soundalikes.  But because of this soft edge, combined with the bass of Stefan Olsdal and the drums of Robert Schultzberg, some pretty amazing results turn out.  The last track on the album has the most beautiful vocals this side of Radiohead.  And unlike Thom Yorke, who sounds more pained than angry, Molko has a real intensity in his sound, which pays off in the harder songs.<br />The album starts out with the instrumental \\"Bulletproof Cupid,\\" which is nothing phenomenal, but its a dang good intro into the sound that dominates the rest of the album.  \\"English Summer Rain\\" is the first track to exhibit Molko's vocals, and it was the moment that my love affair with this album began.  Its combination of basic rock components with the ethereal trip-hop sound just clicked with me.  \\"This Picture\\" is a more straightforward rock song, but it showcases some of my favorite lyrics on the album.  \\"Farewell, the ashtray girl, forbidden snowflake.\\"  It definitely sounds like a good concert song.  The titular \\"Sleeping With Ghosts\\" goes back to the surreal ambience that makes the album for me.  Like many of the songs on the cd, \\"Sleeping With Ghosts\\" is a tragic love song.  It would be horribly depressing if it didn't sound so good.  \\"The Bitter End\\" is the single that was released for this album, and I understand why.  Lyrically, musically, vocally...its the most radio-friendly song on the album, and unusually, one of the best.  No one can sound begging and bitter like Molko can.  One of the best parts of the song is in his incomprehensible rant near the end of the song, and the song ends still angry, before dropping you into the Massive Attackish \\"Something Rotten\\".  My only argument with this song is that the lyrics are, for some reason, not written down with the lyrics to the other songs.  It has a pseudo-sexual, diseased feel to it that I adore.  \\"Plasticine\\" feels like a major departure from the route the album was taking, but it works nonetheless, especially with the guitar lick accompanying Molko's \\"Don't forget to be the way you are.\\"  The next three tracks are the weakest parts of the album, but only by comparison.  \\"Special Needs\\", on the first hearing, struck me as very weak lyrically, but on later listenings, the incredible use of the piano made up for the lyrical faults.  \\"I'll Be Yours\\" is the worst song on the album, but it still has a great feel to it, and the repetitive \\"Second Sight\\" has an awesome refrain.  \\"Protect Me From What I Want\\" is the track that made me want this album, and I still can't get enough of its poetry and its distant-sounding vocals, despite its repetition and even after more listenings than I dare to count.<br />This only leaves the last track, \\"Centrefolds\\".  One of the things that for me makes a great album is if it gets you started right, and then lets you off properly.  Just as Track 1 is a great intro, Track 12 paves the path for Placebo's exit.  Its the most vulnerable track on the album, the least angry, and without a doubt the most beautiful.  Hearing that surreal sound you've become used to through the album, with Molko pleading for you to \\"be mine\\", its hard for this album to end without you smiling.musically, vocally...its the most radio-friendly song on the album, and unusually, one of the best.

B00005JM09|5.0|Don't doubt it for a minute:  \\"Terminator 3\\" lives up to its pedigree.  Whether or not it's as good or better than its predecessors, \\"Rise of the Machines\\" stands perfectly well on its own merits.  Schwarzenegger is his unimitable self, reprising the heroic role he assumed for T2 with an obvious gusto that shines undimmed through his killer cyborg's facade.  Nick Stahl is convincing as the enigmatic John Connor, and Claire Danes is appealing as his unexpected soul mate (aren't they always?).  And of course there's Kristanna Loken, the ice-cold Terminatrix who gives Schwarzenegger all he can handle, and then some.  The stunts are spectacular, the action literally non-stop, and the tone eerie and somber despite all the truly glorious comic relief.  No, this is not a James Cameron film, but that's not all bad. It *IS* a Schwarzenegger film, and a damn good one. But behind all its action and adrenaline, \\"Terminator 3\\" does have a brain, and is arguably more thoughtful than either of the previous chapters. Is Judgment Day inevitable?  Is there no fate but what we make, or is Destiny immutable?  Only time--and the next Terminator--will tell.
B0000028PI|5.0|On my younger years, I thought Trash and Hey Stoopid were Alice Coopers best albums. However, age took me, and I found The Last Temptation, and I love it more than the two. Maybe I grow tired of the simple melodies, I needed something more advanced and less commercial. So I stumbled over The Last Temptation, a MAJOR improvement over the two last records. Its a concept album, although I havent payed much heed to it, I enjoy it as a whole and as seperate songs. Its a different Alice, a darker, more serious, more dirty, yet more thematic and focused. The best songs are Sideshow, Nothings Free, You`re my Temptation and Cleansed by Fire. I really love the sound Alice has on Cleansed by Fire. Strange, listen to Cleansed by Fire, it sounds a bit like Tom Petty in the Verse. That was the first thing I noticed. Its funny, but its a very good song.<BR>Anyway, the album is very good. Its strong, it hard, but it never looses that typical catchy Alice Cooper style.<BR>I strongly recommend this gem to everyone, I do also recommend Trash and Hey Stoopid, but give this album a spin and you`ll probably end up favoring this one. Further Recommendations is Brutal Planet and Dragontown, much darker and heavier, but very good.
B00008J2DQ|2.0|I do like the band and the new drummer is excellent, but Sully needs to let the others get more involved in the song writing because their songs are starting to sound the same and become boring.  Aside from that, the main problem is their guiterist, Tony can't play a solo if his life depended on it and until they replace him they will continue to suffer for it.
B000002MUW|5.0|... What can I say, I love everything about this album ... the album cover (the photograph taken by her brother and I believe was shot in her then Miami house bedroom), the singles and music videos that came out (&quot;Human Nature&quot;, &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;, &quot;Secret&quot;, etc.) I really like &quot;Love Tried To Welcome Me&quot;, it should have been released as a single ... this is her best ...

B00004ZAV3|4.0|It's hard to put together a bad one disc compilation of the Fab Four.  But Please Please Me and Twist and Shout outright qualify, and Day Tripper and Strawberry Fields Forever met the same criteria as their alternate \\"A\\"-side mates.  Add these to Saw Her Standing There, I'll Be Back, I've Just Seen a Face, In My Life, For No One, Rain, A Day in the Life, I am the Walrus, Across the Universe, Blackbird, My Guitar Gently Weeps, Happiness is a Warm Gun, Back in the USSR, Revolution, etc. and BEATLES TOO is the superior mix.

0743244249|1.0|A terrible read.  DeLillo at his worst, I think, writing in a pastiche of his old sharp style. Sentences are gratuitous, cheap, labored.  It appears he visited NYC with a notebook and tried to get down his fleeting scenes.  While the plot is OK, it's nothing to crow about.  But those sentences give no stunning surprise, no postmodern meaning, no delectable wordplay.  Don't get me wrong, I loved Underworld, I liked many of his works, but this one is just plain bad.  Head to Will Self's best or Independence Day by Richard Ford -- a great novel.

B00006CXXU|5.0|1999's self titled album was pretty cheesy really and wasn't exactly what Christina wanted to be.. 3 years later and album number 2 Christina Aguilera strips down to her real self and produces easily one of the best albums of recent years.<br />Great production, personal lyrics and wicked tunes 'Stripped' has it all. There are no Ricky Martin duets or 'Genie In A Bottle' type songs here, instead Christina has opted for something to make her a more credible artist and musically more relaxing whilst remaining upbeat. There are so many styles of music on this album, there are quite a few ballads (the best being 'Walk Away' and the number 1 smash 'Beautiful) some more rockier songs in 'Fighter' and 'Make Over' (which sounds very reminiscent of Sugababes' 'Overload') there is also some brilliant RnB tunes in the shape of 'Dirrty' and 'Get Mine, Get Yours' (which is a very sexy track :D). Other standouts include the beautiful ballad 'Loving Me For Me', the Alicia Keys produced 'Impossible' and the incredibly personal and emotional 'I'm Ok' which tells of her childhood.<br />Whether people can take Christina as a serious and extremely good vocalist is yet to be seen but judging by this album, Christina could/should easily be the next Madonna. Buy!!
B0000009SF|5.0|Simply put: THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST JAZZ FUSION ALBUMS EVER. Any fan of jazz or jazz-rock will undoubtedly love this album. I own many be-bop jazz, jazz-fusion, and funk/jazz albums but never have I heard such amazing and complex compositions as on The Grand Wazoo. &quot;The Grand Wazoo&quot; could possibly be the best jazz-fusion song ever written, complete with big band sounding horn arrangements, funky guitar riffs, and extended trumpet and sax solos all within the same song. <BR>          &quot;For Calvin and his Next Two Hitch-hikers&quot; and &quot;Cletus Awreetus-Awrightus&quot; retain the sound of some of Frank Zappa's more experimental early stuff, i.e. &quot;We're Only In it For the Money&quot; and &quot;Absolutely Free&quot;, while still incorporating experimental, big band, and free jazz in the songs. <BR>     &quot;Eat That Question&quot; is the greatest riff I've ever heard in my life, along wtih some amazing guitar and keyboard work. It really has to be heard to be believed.<BR>     And Zappa finishes off the album with some straightforward, and surprisingly, normal jazz with &quot;Blessed Relief&quot;. Although it is less experimental than the other tunes, it is still one of the best on the album.<BR>     Overall, Frank Zappa truly broke through with a jazz masterpiece with &quot;The Grand Wazoo&quot;, and if you buy this album, you certainly will not be disappointed. It is the most breathtakingly amazing and stunning jazz fusion album of all time. Hear it as soon as you can.

B00005JLT5|5.0|In this well-made film, we see WW II through the eyes of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew who is a concert pianist.  His comfortable life goes steadily downhill after the Germans occupy his country and bit by bit, force the Jews into the ghetto.  At first his family is optimistic that things will improve, but gradually the terrible truth of the Nazi's plans becomes clear.<BR>By a series of seemingly miraculous occurances, Wladyslaw is spared the horrors of extermination in the death camps, but he lives a life spent in hiding and in fear of being discovered by the Nazis.  A kind German soldier helps him survive until the Russians take over Poland, and at last we see some redemption in the closing scenes.  This is a powerful movie which is not always easy to watch but which tells a story which needs to be told again and again so that it will not be forgotten.  This is a very worthy Academy Award nominee.
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff was one of the Greats. Like many of the Greats before him, he died a tragic death at a young age. And, in retrospect, it seems so obvious that he would.<br />While this album is not a suicide note (like so much of Kurt &quot;I swear I don't have a gun&quot; Cobain's work, or Jim &quot;Take the highway to the End Of The Night&quot; Morrison's work for that matter) it is the pure, relentless cry of a person who feels with great intensity what I can only call, &quot;The Missing,&quot; in life. What Jeff missed was his father. And this album is a long letter in song to his missing father.<br />- The story is well known and documented in David Browne's book Dream Brother. Jeff Buckley's father was the late great singer Tim Buckley who died at age 27, leaving Jeff without a father. -<br />Mojo Pin starts off the album. It's a meditation on heroin, but it starts with the auspices line &quot;If only you'd come back to me,&quot; and concludes with, &quot;Black Beauty, I love you so.&quot; Black Beauty is, of course, a metaphor for that which is missing. But, it also conjures up a kind of ghostly image, and sure enough the music reflects the sense of the supernatural. <br />One gets the sense that this music was conjured in late night sessions with only a candle for light. The band flows with an improvisational quality. (I'm sure the music was actually very worked out, but the feel, of the drums in particular, is improvisational.) Jeff's vocals are complete with Roy Orbisonesque operatics, interval lifts that make you feel like you're riding on the swell of his emotion.<br />The music on Grace belongs in the lineage of Roy Orbison, Pink Floyd, and Radiohead. These are songs of loneliness so intense it becomes surreal. <br />Hallelujah is probably the greatest track on the album. Leonard Cohen may have written this song, but it's destiny was a collision with Jeff Buckley. Jeff's interpretation of this song places it in a list of ultimate vocal performances, songs which, after the ultimate vocal performance is acheived, should just be removed from the books, so that nobody ever attempts them again. (This would be a fun list and would include a performance such as &quot;You Are So Beautiful - Joe Cocker) <br />My favorite track on the album is Dream Brother. This song does not have a great melody, it's lyrics are jagged and rather arhythmic, not really well-written, but the effect of the song, for me, is profound. A personal note; I was adopted, so like Jeff, I have issues of abadonment. For me, the song Dream Brother is the aural equivalent of these feelings of abandonment, a sort of wailing through the vaulted halls of eternity. Very cathartic.<br />I recommend this album highly. It's one of the great albums of the Nineties.
B000003S0I|5.0|This album really is something different, even when compared to the bands previous output. The production here is murky and searing, while Fripp's guitars are crunchy and heavy, with a peculiar tone. the addition of david Cross on violin and Bill Bruford on Drums gives this album a more complex and polished sound than many of its predecessors. The nightmare soundscape of Larks Tongues in Aspic, Part One is the highlight track on the record and epitomizes much of its content well: delicate percussion slowly builds to a roaring crescendo, with Fripps guitar puring out rounds of spiky noise and Brufords drums thundering in the background, then slows into a violin interlude before winding back to a conclusion. The bands newfound tight focus and compatible personnel (alhtough Muir would leave after this album) imbues the album with a polish and maturity which belies the fact these musicians havent been playing together for years, much like another magic King Crimson record, 'In the Court of the Crimson King'. While 'Larks Tongues in Aspic' may not surpass this legendary album, it is still the strongest other thing King Crimson had produced at this point. I find it hard to imagine many bands today capturing the menacing tone,riddled with moments of beauty, that this record posesses.<br />I highly recommend this album to prog fans or metal fans willing to broaden their outlook.
B00003CXSM|5.0|I loved this movie, even if it did have Jennifer Lopez in it. It is really romantic, and you can not help but fall in love with it.
0802130208|5.0|this has to be the most humorous book on the face of the earth. john kennedy toole was one of the greatest writers this, or any other country has produced. it is only too bad that he had to kill himself the way that he did, when he did. this book justifies my philosophy that anyhting that can be laughed at should be laughed at.
B00009RDG9|2.0|William Friedkin was one of the most talented directors in modern American cinema. His Exorcist entered history as one of the sacriest films ever made, while films like the underrated To Live and Die in LA and the classic French Connection sealed his reputation as a talented artist who can craft good entertaining films. So a new film by Friedkin requires attention!How disappointed I was therefore with Hunted, expecting a thrill ride, and getting an average over stretched story that is closer to a TV movie, than a film done by and starring Hollywood's best.<BR>First of all the film is not original..The cat and mouse chase in the woods, the war hero that flipped, it reminded me a lot of First Blood, but this is not the problem. Originality is not synonymous with creativity. A remade film or plot with the right  filmmakers can become a classic.It is rather the whole plot and direction that I found lacking creativity in Hunted.<BR>The opening scenes in Kossovo have a 'studio' feel to them, and look staged, while Tommy Lee Jones's character is underdevelopped and 'cliche'd'.<BR>While the actors in the film are the best in the business, especially Jones and Del Toro, they do look uncomfortable in their roles and uninspired.<BR>Overall Hunted can be watched on cable at most, but certainly it is not 'movie library' material, which is sad given the name Friedkin attached to it.
B000089RVX|1.0|I had been hoping that this band would have original-sounding female vocals but was horribly mistaken.  The lead singer's voice is very uninspiring and dull.  She sounds like she just got out of her voice lessons and is following all of the rules; whole notes held for 4 counts, etc.  There is little original feeling, just preoccupation with the technical aspect of the voice.  The rest of the band sounds like a carbon copy of Linkin Park.  I don't like Linkin Park in the first place; I really don't want to hear another version of them. The unoriginal sound of Linkin Park is revisitied in Evanescence.  They're also just as overplayed. Overall, this albumn was a disappointment.  A big disappointment.
B00006M183|5.0|... \\"Riot Act\\" is, in my opinion, their best and most consistent record since \\"No Code\\".  The highlight of the record for me is the beautiful \\"Thumbing My Way\\", which is a perfect showcase for Eddie's thoughtful lyrics and heartbreaking vocals.  There is only one track that I genuinely dislike (\\"Bushleaguer\\") and one that I am ambivalent about (\\"Arc\\").  The rest is good, solid stuff that I could listen to again and again.  Aside from \\"Thumbing My Way\\", the best tracks are \\"You Are\\", \\"Save You\\", \\"Cropduster\\", \\"1/2 Full\\" and the slightly bizarre \\"Help Help\\", which grows on me more with every listen.  I can't wait to hear what Eddie and the boys have in store for us next.
B0000026VZ|3.0|I really hate to give a Toto album only three stars, but can someone please tell me why a &quot;hits&quot; or &quot;best of&quot; type album would EVER have a NEW song on it?  I've never understood this and I feel it insults my intelligence.  Also, the inclusion of the horrible, whiny singer Jean Michel Byron was Toto's worst mistake ever.  Having said this, however, I've got to admit that Can You Hear What I'm Saying is an excelllent song and actually sounds like old-school Toto.  I still don't like the fact that it was on this particular album, but if you're a fan of the first few albums, you've got to hear the song.  Overall, those new to Toto would do much better to start off with Farenheit, IV, Isolation, or Hydra.  For the die-hard, seasoned Toto fan, this disc might be worth picking up used for the one aforementioned song.
B000006MV8|5.0|This was Badfinger's crowning achievment, even though their style was not dominant in the early 70's. They had a few well-deserved hits, but sadly they didn't get the respect from the rock establishment (or their record labels)that they deserved. This album is pure songwriting perfection. I had the 8-track in High School, then later found a sealed vinyl copy for 7 bucks in the mid 80's!(which I still have).Badfinger weren't Beatles copyists, they took the music forward, and this album is the best (but not by any means only) example of that.
B00000FZ1V|4.0|The film \\"Ghostbusters\\" is a supernatural comedy produced and directed by Ivan Reitman and is released by Columbia Pictures.  Reitman is the director of \\"Stripes\\" and the producer of \\"Animal House\\".  The film was released in 1984 and is approximately one hour and forty minutes long.  It made $23 million in the opening weekend, which was a studio record at that time.  The film was nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Song also in 1984.<BR>  \\"Ghostbusters\\" is about three doctors, Venkman(Bill Murray), Stantz(Dan Aykroyd), and Spengler(Harold Ramis), who lose their job at the University because no one believed in their research, so they started their own business exterminating ghosts for people who paid them.  They called themselves the Ghostbusters.  While the three doctors fight different paranormal creatures in Manhattan, NY, they meet Dana Barret(Sigourney Weaver), a violinist who sees strange things in her refrigerator and hires the Ghostbusters come to fight it. In the end the Ghostbusters save the world from disaster and Dr. Venkman gets the girl.  <BR>  I would recommend this film to anyone who likes unbelievable, silly comedies.  Bill Murray was especially funny because he was the goofy one.  The theme song was catchy which is why it was a huge hit when it was released.  It is definitely a silly film but it does keep you laughing throughout it.  I give this film 4 stars.
031286504X|5.0|I usually shy away form vampire books. I've enjoyed other books and short stories he's written, so I gave it a try. It was wonderful! Included in this book is a collection of short stories as well. I have recently discovered that Richard Matheson wrote episodes of the vintage Twilight Zone series as well as books that were made into movies. The movie from the early eighties, Somewhere in Time was based on Matheson's Bid Time Return. What Dreams May Come was also written by Matheson. You can't go wrong with any of his books!
B000002UB6|5.0|To any purpose, Let It Be was the Beatles' last album - even though it wasn't the last one recorded. It was the last Beatles album released, and therefore the last one for the public to hear, and there was an incredibly melancholic sense of finality about it. In all likelihood, Let It Be is one of the Beatles' weakest recordings; the bleakness on it isn't that sharp sarcasm and black humor that made the White Album a classic, but instead it's a sense of dryness and lack of interest from all the members. But even at their lowest, the Fab-Four were the best of the best, and even if it's not as much a piece of creative genius and musical perfection as, say, Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour or Abbey Road (though it doesn't lack in brilliant pieces of music, like `I Me Mine' and the title track) - it actually includes two of my least favorite Beatles tracks, `Across The Universe' and 'The Long And Winding Road' - it's an incredibly beautiful album, and a fascinating document that gives us a better picture than any other work of the Beatles as human beings - who Paul, John, George and Ringo really are, rather than the teen idols of the early days or the psychedelic gurus of '67 - and that makes Let It Be an absolute essential for Beatle fans.<br />The album Let It Be was not composed and perfectly positioned - it's fragmented from various pieces played during rehearsals, some of them more produced, some less. So while it has some of their biggest hits, it also takes chances with strange little experiments - like the intuitive avant-garde Lennon piece `Dig It', or `One After 909' - a surprising return to a great little unreleased rock n' roll tune written by John and Paul in the early days. But of course, the hits get the most attention - Paul's wonderful title track `Let It Be', wonderfully composed and arranged, with a terrific guitar solo by George Harrison and a terrific organ solo by Billy Preston; `Across The Universe', John's rather pretentious pseudo-spiritual song which nobody ever really understands, but it's still beautiful in its own way; `The Long And Winding Road', a pretty little piano-and-vocals ballad by Paul, completely ruined by Phil Spector's patented wall-of-sound production (more on that later); and most of all `Get Back', a superb rockin' song which howls back to the Beatles' roots and what made them - what made all the musicians of their generation, really - turn to rock n' roll in the first place.<br />I'm more impressed, though, by some of the more obscure pieces. The most incredible track on the album, in my opinion, is George's `I Me Mine', a brilliant song which is a waltz in the verse and a hard rocker in the chorus. It seems that the more Lennon and McCartney got more surly and sulky at each other (look how bored John looks in the movie Let It Be - look at the way he looks at Paul!) - George was actually taking the chance to break away from the two living legends and reach the full of his creative potential; if you want proof, look into his songs on Abbey Road and on his first solo album All Things Must Pass. Other favorites include John's powerful and wise `Dig A Pony', with soulful vocals and great guitar playing; `I've Got A Feeling', a very clever combination of a Lennon song and a McCartney song, turned into a great rock duet (check out the movie to see the process of this song's creation); and `Two Of Us', a lovely duet between John and Paul about how great it was to be young and be great friends, and it's really a pretty sad farewell, because it's more or less the last time the two would truly work together.<br />What ruins it for me, on many of the tracks, is Phil Spector's production. My intention is not that Phil Spector was not a competent producer - a legend of this proportion is not created for nothing. However, Mr. Spector's production does not go well with the Beatles's sound, on this album less than any. Let It Be was meant to be loose and semi-produced, and Spector's bombastic wall-of-sound style didn't belong here - as clearly shows in the butcher job he did on Paul's `Long And Winding Road' - without Paul's consent or approval, by the way - where he turned a very pretty little ballad (the original version can be found in Anthology 3) into a full scale orchestra piece fit for a Disney soundtrack. He also cut John's brilliant `Dig It' into less than a minute, a criminal act by itself. His influence shows to lesser extent on the other tracks, but I think this album would have done much better had it been produced exclusively by Sir George Martin, truly the fifth Beatle.<br />But no matter. Let It Be remains a classic, as much as every Beatles album is a classic, and any true music lover who really respects themselves should own each and every one of their recordings; a real Beatles fanatic is not someone who owns all their albums - every music lover should have that - but someone who owns all their albums on both CD and vinyl. Let It Be is a classic and beautiful swan song for the Fab-Four, and if only for the few brilliant tracks on it, don't pass it by.
B000001FSR|5.0|I don't know why but this album always seems to get left out when people speak of the great Tom Waits albums. This was the first one that I hear and therefore the onle I'm closest to. <BR> Aside fom my personal feelings, I honestly feel like this is the album where Tom finally reconciles his need to experiment with his love of great american songwriting. <BR> If you've never heard Tom Waits before, I also think this is an perfect starting point. Being made halfway through his career you get a sense both of where he came from and glimses of where he's going.
B000002AP1|4.0|i got to listen to the remix cd copy,,,,,, now i know why my 8 track of them live is so raw,,,,nonetheless,,,, iggy is the godfather of punk,,,,its easy to see how the punk scene in london ate this up. even today the music is phenomenal,,, i would tend to say the lp version is smoother .<BR>so ,which do you like death trip, raw power, or your pretty face is going to hell? kinda puts the 90s scene in the closet. if you like this , go for funhouse,,,, another all time great
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This is an excellent CD. I have listened to it over and over since I got it! If you enjoyed the movie, get the soundtrack!!
B00008BRB5|4.0|When a band releases its biggest selling record, it usually capitalizes on that success by rehashing the same formula on its next several albums.  This didn't happen with the Police.  In 1983, the trio released \\"Synchronicity,\\" a record that not only sold millions but it spent more weeks at Number One than any other album in that year, including Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller.\\" Fans, myself included, clamored for a followup album, but the Police decided to call it quits while they were still on top.  How many groups today would do such a thing?  Anyway, \\"Synchronicity\\" is a fine album that shows a more confident and self-assured band delivering its most accessible work at the time.  \\"Every Breath You Take\\" will probably go down as the most misunderstood and misinterpreted pop song of the 1980s, especially considering that it's still being played at senior proms and weddings.  Thanks to Sting's passionate lyrics, it's often been mistaken for a love ballad when it's actually a song told from the mind of an obsessive stalker (Every breath you take/ every move you make/. . . I'll be watching you).  Other strong points include the tribal rhythms of \\"Walking in Your Footsteps,\\" the subtle jazz-rock touches of \\"Oh My God,\\" and the absolutely nutty \\"Mother,\\" in which guitarist Andy Summers sings vocals.  But \\"Synchronicity\\" gets its money's worth for the lovely \\"Tea in the Sahara.\\"  This song was the closing track of the original LP version, but on the CD/cassette versions it's followed by the jazzy \\"Murder By Numbers.\\"  In my mind, it hurts the sequencing a bit, and it was better off as a b-side as was originally intended.  \\"Synchronicity\\" is one of the best albums of the 1980s, but I hesitate to give it 5 stars because it lacks some of the raw edge of the group's finer recordings like \\"Zenyatta Mondatta\\" and \\"Ghost in the Machine.\\"  Still, it's one of the essential records to own and has lost none of its luster after 20 years.
B00005NKKV|5.0|This album is absolutely beautiful. I don't understand how anyone can't see that.  Between the poetic lyrics and the flowing melodies, this is a work of musical masterpiece. I highly recommend finding a copy on vinyl- it just makes it all the more enjoyable.

B00006RU5B|4.0|As a fan of both Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden, I can tell you, don't expect something you've heard before. It isn't Rage and it isn't Soundgarden. this is an entirely new band with a style all their own. If you're like me and loved Rage's music but thought Zach De La Rocha's voice was annoying This is the album to get. There aren't really any bad tracks, but the would have to be \\"The last remaining light. Some of the best tracks are \\"Show me how to Live\\", and \\"What you are\\". If you're a soundgarden fan who wants some new, good old-fashioned rock n roll, also get it. Something on here for everybody. If you don't have it yet, buy it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watch a lot of TV.  It's true, though I like to think I limit myself to only the truly good stuff - no reality TV, no stupid sit-coms.<br />I always liked westerns, and science fiction.  That meant so nothing when I found Firefly.  I never imagined anything this wonderful could be taken away from me.  I am ashamed to say I think of Firefly everyday.  EVERY day.  I have never CONNECTED with a Television show as I did with Firefly.  I was enthralled.  Fascinated.  Amused.  Shocked.<br />Television is often mocked, ridiculed, and Belittled.  I see \\"Kill Your TV\\" bumperstickers.  But I have seen Firefly, and I know that TV can be amazing - it can be better than a movie, better than a book (and for ME, that's REALLY saying something).  It can be Art and Literature, together.  Firefly is, to me, the height of the best that TV can bring.  So different, so beautiful, and ugly, and funny, and so fascinating.  The people were so REAL - with myriad facets, unlike any I'd seen before.  Just when I thought I knew - oh, he's the fighter-type-guy, who beats people over the head and picks on everyone, and only cares about money - I see Jayne, hugging his knees while little Kaylee's life is hanging by a thread.  And an married bouple with a REAL relationship - love, jealousy, arguing, teasing - hey, it's just like me and my OWN husband!<br />I used to say I needed to find ONE character, at least, that I REALLY cared about - that touched that part of me that made me HAVE to know what happened to them next.  I have never, ever, seen a show that didn't have a character I kinda wished would just go away - that I found stupid, annoying, or too 1- or 2- dimensional to feel anything for.  I loved Capn'n Mal - the tragic Hero, man who lost his faith and drops a wry \\"Huh.\\" like no man I've heard before.  Kaylee - sweet Kaylee, the tomboy engineer who loves a frilly dress, and who'll do anything (even a loser engineer) to get close to a REAL starship engine.  Jayne - the man with a girl's name, who loves his gun, and knows the value of the all-mighty credit.  Simon - a genius willing to risk all for love of his sister, River.  River - mysterious, funny, scary - I SO want to know her secrets!!  Zoey and Wash - the married couple, she the amazon who has a relationship with the captain rarely seen on TV, except in the likes of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully (REAL friends, and no romantic interest), and Wash, the pilot who plays with plastic dinosaurs, and quips like no other.  Inara - beautiful, sexy, exotic, the Companion, fascinating, with secrets barely hinted at. Book - preacher-man who recognizes the gun used by the bullet hole left behind (!wow!), who's secrets I am the most baffled and intrigued by.  No other show ever managed to hook me with EVERY character's stories - each one as fascinating as the last.<br />Firefly is the ONLY show I have found myself able to watch over and over and over and OVER - and I only managed to save three episodes!  It's like my favorite movie - but 15 hours long, instead of 1 and a half.  Continuing on and on, yet still maintaining a basic story - with many, many smaller stories, entwined with the long story of the entire show.<br />We can all go on and on, those of us who saw and know, we can share it with those who have not seen.  If you haven't seen this, and you like action, comedy, drama, science fiction, westerns, horror or mysteries, you must see this DVD.<br />I know I must have gone on and on, but all I can say is wow, sorry.  I guess this really shows how deeply I feel about this, and I can't say anything more to reccomend it than that.
B00005JLTN|5.0|I didn't let myself get too hyped up over this, although I have been waiting for it since 2000.  I wasn't lucky enough to see the original in theaters, but was still blown away when I saw it at home.  Matrix Reloaded didn't skimp on content like I feared it would given the commercial success of the first, and I am really happy the directors got to make \\"their movie\\" just like they did in The Matrix.  Sometimes studios can really screw up a movie, WB was smart enough to back off.  <br />There is more dialogue in this movie, but I figure that is  because the audience needs to form a bond with characters so we can see what Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, etc. are fighting for.  I loved this movie and can't wait for it to come out on DVD!  I already pre-ordered mine!
B00001U0E1|5.0|Coincidentally, I saw this film and then Elizabeth on consecutive evenings when they both were released in 1998. In the years since, I have not changed several initial reactions which serve as an introduction to this brief commentary. Here are three. First, both deserve all the praise they have received. Second, this film is far more entertaining but that Elizabeth has greater dramatic impact. And finally, then and now, I think Saving Private Ryan should have received the Academy Award that year which was presented to Shakespeare in Love.<br />The basic situation is that young Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) is struggling to overcome writer's block at the worst possible time, given his financial situation and (worst yet) the near-bankrupt status of \\"The Rose\\" theatre in which his plays are performed. The owner, Phillip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush), is hounded by especially nasty and persistent creditors. Meanwhile, Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) has been informed by her father that she will marry Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) and live in Virginia. Viola has a strong attraction to the stage at a time when all parts were played by men and boys. She also feels an attraction to Shakespeare whose work she admires.<br />He finally begins to write \\"Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.\\"  Disguised as a young man, Viola is selected to play Romeo. (Believe it or not, no one recognizes her.) Meanwhile, she (as Viola) and Shakespeare have fallen in love and also feel increasing desperation as her marriage to Wessex approaches. After all manner of complications, the play is finally performed, with Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench) in the audience. And then....<br />This is a thoroughly entertaining film which captures not only the \\"look\\" but the \\"feel\\" of the London theatre world during the Elizabethan era. Under John Madden's direction, the acting is first-rate. Paltrow and Dench received Academy Awards as did those responsible for best original screenplay, art and set decoration, and costume design. It really does seem as if we are there in London, walking through its lively and colorful streets, stopping occasionally for a lubricated conversation with Shakespeare, Henslowe, Richard Burbage or Christopher Marlowe. I especially enjoyed  observing rehearsals and then the performance of \\"Romeo and Ethel\\" in the authentically recreated theatre.<br />Great fun!costume design.

B00005JMC6|5.0|Every now and then, a movie comes around that is absolutely perfect. \\"Whale Rider\\" is one of them.<br />Not only do you get to see a glimpse of another culture, but you get to see a glimpse of your own. The heroic cycle in world mythology is followed pretty closely here, but in a different, even more triumphant way. A young girl overcomes gender stereotypes in her own culture (Maori), by ascending the social stratigraphy. The moral the movie teaches is GREAT for children, and also refreshing for adults such as myself. With all of the junk that is in the movie theaters these days (even in Art house theaters as of late), it is nice to see a movie such as this one. <br />\\"Whale Rider\\" deserves AT LEAST a nomination for Picture of the Year, though it probably wont get it. The acting is superb, the directing is superb, and the visuals are breathtaking.
B00007AJF9|5.0|Briefly, here is the historical context.  Elizabeth I (1533-1603) was queen of England and Ireland from 1558 to 1603. During the brief reign of her brother, Edward VI, Elizabeth barely survived, especially in 1549 when those in her household were arrested and she was placed in what we now call protective custody until November 17, 1558, when her half-sister Mary died, and Elizabeth succeeded to the throne. One of her first actions as queen was to appoint Sir William Cecil (later Lord Burghley) as her chief secretary and he continued as her closest adviser. Both were aware of England's vulnerability to France and Spain. Both also knew that the key to England's success lay in playing the two great powers against each other so that neither could bring its full force to bear against England. The defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 eliminated one serious threat to England's security and also created almost unlimited opportunities for exploration, settlement, and economic growth. When Elizabeth died in 1603, Britannia really was \\"queen of the oceans.\\"<br />Directed by Shekhar Kapur and starring Cate Blanchett, this film examines Elizabeth's gradual transformation from being a free-spirited, lusty, at times reckless, and often silly young princess to becoming a sanitized, somber, and worldly-wise monarch. Several key figures are centrally involved in this process, notably Mary (Kathy Burke) and Cecil (Richard Attenborough), Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes), the Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston), and especially Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush). Throughout her adult years, especially when protected by Walsingham, Elizabeth survived numerous assassination attempts and died of natural causes in 1603.<br />For me, Walsingham is at least as interesting in this film as the queen to whom he is totally devoted. He gathers what we now call intelligence data from his espionage network which extends throughout Europe and even goes after important information himself, when necessary. He also serves as a high-level diplomat as when he meets with the warrior-wonderwoman, Mary of Guise (Fanny Ardent), and assassinates her after sharing her bed. The French troops are thereby denied their leader as they await orders on the Scottish border. Walsingham is also a master of the slit throat (however young it may be) and of torture (even of Papal emissaries) if such initiatives serve the queen's purposes. In fact, her purposes ARE his purposes. We know that he served as her secretary of state from 1773 until 1590, was a member of the privy council, and knighted in recognition of brilliant and loyal service to her.<br />To me, the younger Elizabeth's lover Robert Dudley symbolizes the personal life which she finally and completely renounces. An indifferent husband and father as well as a minor court figure, the character of Dudley in this film offers Fiennes little to work with but he does his best. The Duke of Norfolk and the French Duc d'Anjou (Vincent Cassell) are much more interesting characters, primarily because the former poses the most serious threat to Elizabeth and the latter provides some delightful comic relief. As entertaining this film is at times, however, I still view it as a generally dark study of a very dangerous period in English history when so many wars (declared or not) were in progress or imminent at the same time. With substantial dramatic impact, it reveals how and why England's survival literally depended on someone who eventually proved to be a much greater leader than her father, Henry VIII.necessary. He also serves as a high-level diplomat as when he meets with the warrior-wonderwoman, Mary of Guise (Fanny Ardent), and assassinates her after sharing her bed. The French troops are thereby denied their leader as they await orders on the Scottish border. Walsingham is also a master of the slit throat (however young it may be) and of torture (even of Papal emissaries) if such initiatives serve the queen's purposes. In fact, her purposes ARE his purposes. We know that he served as her secretary of state from 1773 until 1590, was a member of the privy council, and knighted in recognition of brilliant and loyal service to her.<br />To me, the younger Elizabeth's lover Robert Dudley symbolizes the personal life which she finally and completely renounces. An indifferent husband and father as well as a minor court figure, the character of Dudley in this film offers Fiennes little to work with but he does his best. The Duke of Norfolk and the French Duc d'Anjou (Vincent Cassell) are much more interesting characters, primarily because the former poses the most serious threat to Elizabeth and the latter provides some delightful comic relief.

B00009UW0N|5.0|Yeah, it's that time of year again.  Time to whip out the candy corn, the King Diamond cds(or Sheryl Crow, whoever you consider more terrifying), and of course the Halloween dvd.  You'd better have a copy coz no horror fan should be without it.  If you're a yungun and have never seen it(though most likely you've seen the rottenass sequels), slap yourself a few times for being a schmuck and then go rent it.  I'm not about to bore with with another plot synopsis coz you should know it anyway.  Basically this is a good time of year to give the film another viewing.  To those familiar it's a wonderful piece of nostalgic fun and a reminder of how mainstream horror films were once excellent.  Newcomers can enjoy the creepiness, but since this movie helped set all the standards and trends(masked psycho killing teenagers, one remaining tough female who overcomes killer, killer who apparently can't be killed, etc), there won't be much in it that you aren't expecting coz you've seen it many times since.  Be that as it may, Halloween still manages to have more style and class than any slasher film to follow in it's wake.  Unfortunately the success lead to a bunch of sequels that had no business being made.  These sequels attempted to shed light on unanswered questions established in the original.  Explaining Michael's motives and origins ruins the movie.  Who cares about his motives and origins?  Motives didn't matter to frightened filmgoers in the theaters in 1978.  Carpenter himself hated the sequels and only threw in the sister gimmick when pressured to write a sequel.  Having no motive makes it scarier, and that's one philosophy the killers in the film Scream were right about.  You know a series has been ruined when they use a stupid abbreviation as the title(H2O) or cast Busta Rhymes to play one of the leads.  Rob Zombie is currently doing his part to further ruin the series by making a remake/prequel.  It is difficult anymore to watch Halloween and not think of all the [...] the sequels threw at us, and it does lose a little of it's power coz of many similar horror films over the years that have desensitized us.  Regardless it's still one of a kind and has never been successfully imitated.  Carpenter's still proud of it and he damn well should be....] the sequels threw at us, and it does lose a little of it's power coz of many similar horror films over the years that have desensitized us.

B00005JLXE|2.0|**1/2 Matt Murdock is a mild-mannered, pro bono attorney by day and a high-flying, crime-fighting superhero by night.  The one thing that separates this costumed do-gooder (who goes by the name Daredevil) from his comic book brethren like Superman and Spiderman is that Murdock/Daredevil happens to be blind.  The same accident involving radioactive chemicals that, as a boy, deprived Matt of his eyesight also had the bizarre effect of heightening and enhancing his other senses, most notably hearing and touch, to an astonishing degree (it should be pointed out that little is done in the story with taste and smell).  The accident also appears, inexplicably, to have given him the power to defy the laws of physics and gravity.  Like any superhero worthy of the title, he uses these preternatural skills to right wrongs and bring justice to the imperiled and helpless citizenry living in the urban jungles of New York City.<br />The hero's handicap seems to be about the only element, in fact, that distinguishes the movie \\"Daredevil\\" from the earlier films based on those other characters.  As conceived by writer/director Mark Steven Johnson, the tone of this film is a few shades darker than the one in \\"Spiderman\\" and a few shades lighter than the one in \\"Batman\\" and \\"Darkman.\\"  Since there is nothing particularly fresh or groundbreaking offered in this film, one begins to wonder why Hollywood feels such a compelling need to drive this particular genre into the already over-saturated ground (even adolescents, the target audience for this type of film, seem to be tiring of all these offerings lately).  \\"Daredevil\\" provides all the requisite scenes of its superhero soaring through the air, jumping from building to building, and karate-chopping his way to victory over a plethora of bad-guy enemies.  But it's all starting to feel a bit old hat by this time, so much so that, even in the moments when \\"Daredevil\\" is good, the film doesn't feel innovative and fresh enough for us to really commit to it.  Ben Affleck, with his earnest and stolid seriousness, does manage to bring a certain gravity to the main character - and his relationship with Elektra (Jennifer Garner), a young woman with some \\"superhero\\" moves of her own, is genuinely charming and touching at times.  There is a lovely scene in which Matt envisions Elektra's beauty by hearing the raindrops falling on her face.  It is in rare moments such as this that \\"Daredevil\\" rises above the conventions of its genre, but such moments are very few and far between indeed.  Most of the running time seems to be spent on characters performing acrobatic kickboxing moves on tops of skyscrapers (all of which are decked out with statuary in places where nobody would ever be likely to see it).  Colin Farrell invests the implement-wielding villain, Bullseye, with an air of sly menace that makes him a worthy foil to the lovestruck boy wonder of the piece.  I must say, in way of a caveat, that some of the violence in the film is uglier and more mean-spirited in nature than is, perhaps, justified by the material.<br />\\"Daredevil\\" tries for a little thematic richness by dramatizing the internal conflict being waged inside Matt's psyche between the need to let the legal system runs its course and his own desire to achieve a little vigilante-type justice for the victims when the court system itself fails.  But that theme is never dealt with at any great level of depth.  The art direction, action sequences and special effects are generally impressive, but even they contribute to the generalized feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu that hangs over the work.  Maybe it's finally time to outgrow our obsession with superheroes who come out of nowhere to fight our battles for us - and time to stop always thinking of ourselves as some sort of defeated underdog in need of protection.  There are certainly enough life-sized heroes living and working in our own communities and neighborhoods to serve as our inspiration.<br />Movies like \\"Daredevil\\" may, finally, have run their course.\\"Daredevil\\" may, finally, have run their course.
B000056TKD|5.0|Linked by their associations with \\"outer space\\" (an association forced on Strauss' \\"Also sprach Zarathustra\\" by its use in \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\"), these two showpieces for orchestra have kept company on CD (and cassette) before. For example, there's a Double Decca two-fer with Zubin Mehta conducting the L.A. Philharmonic in audiophile-quality recordings from the early '70s. But as far as I know this DG Originals reissue is the only single-CD set combining both works. One reason it's not done more often is that \\"Zarathustra\\" generally comes in at 33-35 minutes and Holst's \\"The Planets\\" usually runs 48-51 minutes, for a total playing time that's too long for one CD. William Steinberg's fastish tempi make this coupling possible--his 29:56 for \\"Zarathustra\\" may be the swiftest on record, and \\"The Planets\\" comes in at about 46 minutes here. However, such was this underrated, under-recorded conductor's natural sense of flow that nothing sounds rushed or glided over. He takes to \\"The Planets,\\" a work he apparently learned only just prior to making this recording, with as little apparent effort as he does to the Strauss tone poem that had certainly been a part of his repertoire for decades.  Not to mince words, this is a disc to treasure, even if you already have other recordings of both works.  If you don't, you may decide you're set for life with this CD.
B00008PC2O|5.0|I've always wanted to know what extra deleted scenes they had for this movie. And in the great tradition of movies, the sequal does better than the original and the third. I'm a big Arnold fan and this, along with the Conan movies, pretty much made his career when he wasn't being &quot;Mr. Universe&quot;.<br />I'm pretty sure they enhanced both the audio and visual. But just like with &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;, they sure can perform wonders in Hollywood. Go for it.

B00000AFGM|4.0|I really don't see why people didn't like this album. yes it is different. VERY different from the likes of portrait of an american family and antichrist superstar, it's predecessors (i won't shame it by comparing it to smells like children).  While those albums focused more on the [angry], angst riddled goth metal, this is more sex oriented glam rock.  Much more melody on this one is the most notable change. manson hardly uses his scream at all on this album and instead relies on a more unique style.  I have yet to see this album be emulated.  \\"I want to disappear\\", \\"the dope show\\", and \\"rock is dead\\" are the best tracks, but they're all pretty good.  the reason this is getting four stars is the fact that so many songs are about sex that you wish he'd just take a ... break and find another topic, but oh well.
B000089RVX|5.0|absolutely everybody should buy this CD and get a mercedez benz SL 500 convertible and blast it in the car. It's fun. I'm wierd.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|After seeing Gavin Degraw live in New York last April I have been waiting to hear more of him. I am now thrilled to say I can hear him, any time I please now and that is great.  He has a touch of mellow jazz and mixes it with early rock.  It is very refreshing to hear such a young talent today!
0790736233|4.0|I like jody foster and Scifi, and Robert Zemeckis gave us the movie USED CARS, one of my favorites.  I should have like this movie, but when I first saw it the ending left me cold and shaking my head.<br />After seeing it again, what I really liked is not the somewhat silly scifi part of the plot but rather the relationship between Jodie F and Mathew M and the nature of believing in something that you can't prove... like proving that your dad loved you or proving that god exists.  It is our beliefs in this that can not be proven that makes us human.<br />The story about the puzzle and the trip to another planet was just background for the rest of it, and that is why I have seen this movie several times and enjoy it more with each viewing.
6302424887|4.0|Roman Polanski's bloody, nihilistic 1971 screen version of Shakespeare's classic psychological study is an exemplary adaptation of the bard. With a literary talent as revered as Shakespeare is, one always fears individual re-interpretations of his work, especially in the medium of filmdom, which has been known to take some very dense literary works and turn them into action-packed, sex-laden Hollywood cliches. Polanski's take on on one of Shakespeare's greatest plays it not a completely literal, or line-by-line, rendering:  it is an individual interpretation, probably highly influenced by the events in the director's life at the time (his wife had recently been murdered by Charles Manson's \\"family\\"), but still very true to the original spirit of the play. The choice of scenery and the setting of the movie (it was filmed in North Wales) perfectly conjures up the play's original Elizabethian-era Scotland. The castles and lodgings used throughout the movie were well-chosen and well-done. The cast, though relatively unknown, also does a great job. Jon Finch as Macbeth perfectly captures the tragic hero's nobility, immiment rage, and subsequent moral and mental decline. Francesca Annis convincingly portrays Lady Macbeth's inherently evil character and her handy persuasion abilities. Terence Bayler is a similarly convincing Macduff. Polanski has taken what was already a dark and gruesome story and made it into an absolute bloodbath. Shakespeare, perhaps necessarily, kept most of the fighting offstage; Polanski brings it to the forefront. The murder of Banquo, in particular, is quite bloody and absolute eye candy. The battle at the end of the movie, featuring Macduff's advancing army, is quite prolonged and features Macbeth in several extended sword fights; the final battle with Macduff is outstanding, and the latter carries off his head. Polanski adds gruesome touches in other areas that Shakespeare either left completely unmentioned or ambiguous, the murder of the murderers being a prime example (the naked, ghastly overweight witches and Lady Macbeth's nude sleepwalking scene being other, somewhat more subtle, touches.) The tragedy was a dark and chilling tale to begin with, a brutally honest and open psychological portrayal of one man's fall from grace. Polanski turned it into an extremely break, nihilistic film almost totally devoid of humor (the only possible instances of the latter being the witch who flashes an innocent bystander and Macbeth's verbal assault on the unsuspecting messageboy.) The thoughtful and totally unexpected ending is another nice little personal touch of the director's. Overall, a distinct and highly personal rendering of a Shakesperian masterpiece -- a modern for future interpretors of the bard who wish to add their own personal touch to a play without bringing corruption to it.
B00006ZXSK|4.0|I just discovery this movie and came to tell the world about this wonderful movie that my whole family jut enjoyed.  To my surprise this would the 764th review of this movie, so i guess a few people have discovered it already.<br />Beautifully photographed and acted, the script takes a old story and presents it in a manner that lets the story live anew.<br />The 4 stars is because I save my 5 star grades for something extra, extra special, unique and brilliant such as The Lion King and the Princess Bride.
B000002UAR|5.0|When the Beatles decided to stop touring in the summer of 1966, it sent shockwaves to the music world. How could a band not tour? On top of this was the &quot;Bigger than Jesus&quot; debacle that John Lennon had unwittingly sprung upon the world. The Beatles, seemingly in for a rough 1966, instead settled into Abbey Road studios in London and created the masterpiece of musical masterpieces: the stunning Revolver.<br />Firstly, it is the most evenly written effort from the Beatles, as George Harrison gets 3 songs to play with on the record. His best is &quot;Taxman,&quot; a howling rock effort with snide social commentary to open up the record. He also lays down the downtrodden &quot;I Want To Tell You&quot; late in the album; however, his greatest acheivement is &quot;Love You To,&quot; which emphasizes the major strength of Revolver: its massive roots.<br />&quot;Love You To&quot; is an Eastern romp, and is the first full romp of such kind by any mainstream western outlet. The Beatles also reach out with Paul McCartney's pop review. He channels slow do-wop with &quot;Here, There, and Everywhere,&quot; takes a page from the Lovin' Spoonful with &quot;Good Day Sunshine,&quot; and rides Motown brass with &quot;Got To Get You Into My Life.&quot; The latter is a drug anthem.<br />Which is the third major point of Revolver: drugs. John Lennon's five songs all have something to do with them. &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; is a lounging hangover; &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; is pretty straight, but is enriched with a maze of guitars; &quot;She Said She Said&quot; is a trip in itself, influenced by a Peter Fonda acid session; &quot;Doctor Robert&quot; is about a drug dealer; and then there's the pounding Mantra of &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows,&quot; the first song of psychedelia.<br />The A and B side from Revoler is the Beatles' most childish song &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; and the Beatles' most serious: the orchestral beauty &quot;Eleanor Rigby.&quot;<br />Fourteen epic songs with different moods and different roots. Together they form the most impressive collection of rock and roll. And it's all in the studio, not from touring. Rock changed tenfold after this album, and that's why it earns its title. Greatest ever.

B00009ATIX|1.0|I saw this movie with 5 other people in a crowded theater.  Had I known that I couldn't get a refund after the first 20 mins of the movie start, I would have walked out like a few other people did.  Even after the movie, we weren't the only people to ask for a refund.  All of us were very frustrated that we wasted 2 hours of our time and almost a year later we still talk about getting that 2 hours back!  I thought that perhaps the movie would get better, but it never did. It isn't as if I'm not familar w/abstract-artsy films, but this didn't even accomplish that.  It's as if there are major chuncks left out of the story.  Now I'll have to read the book for some continuity.  All in all, it's one of the very few movies that I wish I never wasted time or money on and I've seen some pretty bad movies.
B00000761W|5.0|This classic album was recorded seven years before Whitesnake broke through in America, having changed their sound from hard, bluesy rock n' roll to big-haired pop metal, so the version of \\"Fool For Your Loving\\" that kicks off \\"Ready An' Willing\\" is the original gritty rocker, not the slick, keyboard-laden and slightly evil one from the 1989 MTV video.     Back in 1980 original Whitesnake guitarists Bernie Marsden and Mick Moody played big, bluesy guitar riffs and short, sparse solos, Coverdale didn't yet bleach his hair, and the music was raw and powerful, more Deep Purple than poodle-pop.  \\"Ready an' Willing\\" goes from highlight to highlight:   \\"Fool For Your Loving\\", the hard-rocking \\"Sweet Talker\\", the superbly groovy \\"Ready An' Willing\\", the dirty, swaggering blues-rock of \\"Love Man\\", and the ballads \\"Carry Your Load\\", the Zeppelin-like \\"Blindman\\" and the acoustic \\"Ain't Gonna Cry No More\\". And one of the band's unknown gems is also here, the funky, piano-driven R&B of \\"Black And Blue\\" which can only be found on this album.     It's not great art, sure, but it's really great fun, and there is certainly no need to program anything out here. To me \\"Ready An' Willing\\" is Whitesnake's strongest studio album by far, and it's also the last one with the original line-up of Moody, Marsden, Murray, and former Purple members Lord and Paice intact. Never again did the Snake make an album of such consistently entertaining songs.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw's first CD is amazing.  I put it in and listened to it the entire way through.  It wasn't until the long silence after the last song that I realized I had listened to the whole CD in one sitting.  For me, it's one of those rare continuous play albums.  You don't have to skip any songs or only listen to half the album.  Gavin DeGraw wrote all of the songs by himself, he does all the vocals, piano, and keyboards for the CD.  The songs are very mellow.  This is an amazing debut...I think we're going to hear much more from Gavin DeGraw in the future.
B000002HEP|5.0|Stoner rock, A combination of Black Sabbath heaviness with the trippy drug music of the 60s. With &quot;Welcome to Sky Valley&quot;, Kyuss took it too a whole new level. This album is simply amazing. When I listen to it, Im put into a trance. It takes me to another place, some kind of bizzare drug trip through the desert, and not many albums can do that. A step above &quot;Blues for the Red Sun&quot;, This is an album that will never be surpassed in the world of stoner rock. I dont mind that they combined the songs into three tracks either, im actually glad. It forces you to listen to the whole album, which is how this album was intended to be listened to (see directions, &quot;Listen without distraction&quot;, says it all). You have songs that plain rock out like &quot;100 Degrees&quot;, The cool acoustic song &quot;Space Cadet&quot;, The Spacey instrumental &quot;Asteroid&quot;, and the cool hypnotic jam session at the end of &quot;Whitewater&quot;. But this album can only be truly appreciated listened to start to finish. I would say it is probably my #1 favorite album ever! This is music...
B000092ZYX|3.0|Another Radiohead release that depending on what mood your in could go either way in opinions i personally like around half the tracks on the record but it gets a bit tireing at times, i suppose it depends on whether you are more into past or present Radiohead while i'm only into the present Radiohead i cant help feeling this is slightly pretentious whilst been creative it seems to drown in it's own ability but other than that there are quite a few stand out tracks such as backdrifts, go to sleep and myxomatosis, any fan of the more present radiohead material is more likely to appreciate this and enjoy every second of it though in my opinion Radiohead are a very average band but a more pre-eminent average band.
B000089RVX|4.0|Evanescence have made a name for themselves with the 2003 release of 'Fallen' - embraced by people the world over, they have become apart of high-rotation playlists all over the globe. 'Bring Me To Life' was 'the' song that launched this bands career. I heard this song on the radio and appreciated the fresh and unchartered territory that Evanesence was exploring. Although now it has lost it's initial haunting quality due to masochistic DJs over-playing it on the radio, at the time of its' debut, the fusion of powerful, seductive female vocals with the gurffness and grunt of a nu-metal vocalist, backed by a wall of distortion - was, and still is, unquestionably appealing. Hauntingly sweet, vocals on this album are blissful; this quality continues throughout this whole album ,although is especially apparent on specific tracks.<BR>The cross between genres is blurred when the mixes of classical piano come into play on 'Fallen'. 'Immortal' and 'Hello' slow the pace of the album, balancing precariously between the alternative and pop music genres.<BR>All in all, not an album that I would recommend to someone who appreciates female metal groups - more something that could be lightheartedly likened to Concrete Blond as opposed to My Ruin or Kittie. However, it is an album that holds it own from beginning to end.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I am confused why this movie this movie won best animated feature film, I don't think this was the best out the 5 films that was nomiated for best animated feature film. Since this is also a venson of this movie in Japan, there is a cast for the people who live in America, made by Disney. The English cast includes Daveigh Chase (from Lilo & Stitch, who voiced Lilio). As the movie opens, a preteen girl named Chihiro (Daveigh Chase) who is moving to a new house with her father (Michael Chiklis) and mother (Lauren Holly). They are almost to thier new house, when the dad, decides to take a short cut to the house, and end up at a bulding, they decide (expect for Chihiro) to take a quick look around, Chihiro doesn't want to look, but comes along anyways. They had up in a strange town, they seems to be deserted, Chihiro's parents start to eat in a restaurant, and she goes off. She is warned by a local that if she doesn't get a job, she will be turned to something else then what she is by Yababa (Suzanne Pleshette), she gets send off to see Kamaji (David Oqden Stiers) who sends her to see Yababa. Yababa lives at the top of the bath house, and Chihiro has to take about a couple of elevators, before arriving at Yababa's. At first, Yababa doesn't want to give Chihiro a job, but she would not take no for answer. Then she strikes a deal with Yababa, that she will not leave unless Yababa gives her a job. She gives, and Chihiro signs a contract, and her name gets changed to Sen.
B000003NA3|5.0|5+. I didn't notice the muted applause after each live performance, until one the other reviewers pointed it out.  It is hard to ignore now, even a little comical, to hear a few hands clapping after each sublime session. These are great musicians, feeling comfortable, and playing completely in sync with each other. It sounds effortless and incredibly smooth when it is this good.
B00009RGBS|5.0|This Movie/Musical is fanominal!  I thought that this was such a well put together movie that I saw it more than once at the movie theater, which I hope you did!  If you did not you must buy this DVD because Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee were such great choices for the roles of Velma and Roxie. If you like musicals you will like this \\"modern day\\" musical, even if you don't like musicals there is such a fun story her that you msut give it a try!  I read the bad reviews on this site and could not disagree more.  This is the Millieum and things change, maybe that was the complaint, but this movie is such a show stopper I can not see how someone could not enjoy this.  I loved Molin Rouge when it came out and I still do, I love Nicole Kidman as well-but Chicago took it ever furtur and caught you up in the moment!<br />See and/or buy this Movie<br />Chicago, me, and u!
B0000A1RJI|3.0|While watching Pirates, I was very impressed by the score.  The action sequences were kicked up a notch by Badelt's liberous use of brass and loud string themes.  You'll find these on the soundtrack -- but thats about all you'll find.  While not obvious while watching the film, the monotony of this soundtrack is glaring when listened to from beginning to end.  Instead of creating a more &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;-esque soundtrack mixing lighter tunes in with epic battle scene pieces, Pirates of the Caribbean blasts away throughout.  Aside from a few variations on the main themes, you may as well be listening to the same track on repeat for 45 minutes.  As a result of this monotony, it's difficult for a track on the CD to be able to capture the spirit of significant moments in the film.  While the soundtrack in itself captures the emotion of the movie as a whole, the individual tracks can't be mentally put together with the scenes they belong in (at least, I wasn't able to do it).  Overall, while the soundtrack has great themes and arrangements, it's lack of variation keeps it from being an exceptional score.

And while some people find Tony Moore's voice to be annoying, I think that it is perfect for this sort of album, and I love the sound of it! His voice is very high pitched, and when he screams, I think it sounds like raging hot, piercing lightning searing and cutting through the dark sky! If he can be found in any other metal bands, then I sure would love to get my hands on those albums, too.<BR>   I think that the songs are great!!!!! Very fun to sing along with. And they are very inspiring to listen to, in both ways, mentally, and artistically for me. All of the songs are great, of course, but Buried Alive really stands out there. It's very dark, and it makes for a perfect heavy metal song, I think. Being buried alive is probably one of the coolest subjects for a metal song to be about. I actually look at this song as a work of art, it's brilliant!<BR>   Other good songs are Thundersteel, Blood Streets (very beautiful melody and vocals), Johnny's back, Run for your Life (coooool), Fight or Fall (inspireing! Makes me want to take up my claymore and fight for my kingdom!), Flight of the Warrior (*see Fight or Fall*).<BR>   That's about it. Be sure and buy this album before you surf on out! Take care.
B000094J66|4.0|Well, firslty I must confess I have never read the book that so many other reviewers are comparing the movie to, so my aprassel will be based sheerly from the perspective of someone who has only seen the movie and has no interest in how the movie compares to the book it was based on.<br />On that note, the movie was great. I was excited to see this ever since seeing the previews and i wasnt disapointed. The movie is more of a love story and story of personal struggle and challenge set in the middle of a war in a far off land, than a straight war movie. The main character leaves the british army upon his unit's call to deployment in the Sudan to fight muslim guerillas. His friends (who go) send him a package of four white feathers, symbolizing cowardice. He then travels to the sudan to find his friends and prove to them he is not a coward.<br />The movie is well done, and has many scenes that provoke thought and could be ascribed a metaphorical or symbolic meaning - something I apreciate in a film. The action isn't as frequent as the preview implied, but when it comes it is well done, and epic. There is also a fair share of likeable characters and the acting is excelent. <br />All in all this was a great movie that was enjoyable on several levels, I definatley liked it.
B00005JLZN|4.0|I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie after all the bad reviews it got.  It was about David Gale (obviously), played to perfection by Kevin Spacey.  Gale is an alchohol guzzling, anti-capitol punishment crusader who is accused of rape and murder in Texas.  Sitting on death row, he gives his last interview to Bitsey Bloom, played by Kate Winslet, who also does an admirable job.  Done in flashbacks, Gale tells her the story of what led up to his conviction.  While she goes into this interview totally believing he's guilty, she soon has her doubts.  These are further supported by the \\"cowboy\\" who seems to be following her and her partner around.  She has 3 days to prove Gale's innocence or he'll be put to death.  Is he guilty or is he the victim of a setup by some hard core capitol punishment activist or politician who wants him out of the way?  This movie has a thrilling ending that comes with a surprise.  <BR>Whether you are for or against capitol punishment, this film won't change your mind and maybe isn't meant to.  Just see the movie and enjoy it for what it is.  You won't regret it.
B00005A46T|1.0|I don't know why I have this CD, I think the only reason I have it is because I stole it. Anyways, you seriously have to be deaf or have some kind of mental disorder to consider this music. Slipknot has no talent, it literally took me about 10 minutes to play all their songs perfectly on guitar. This CD was almost well worth stealing, the only purpose it served was flinging it from my window at the annoying neighbor kid. I don't know why everyone in my school likes them so much. I guess you would like this if you hate everyone or if you 'Have issues'...
6305508550|2.0|When I started working in office (and a cubicle), all of my friends told me that I had to watch &quot;Office Space&quot; because it is so much like work and it's hilarious.  Finally, I did get a chance to watch it... but I ended up being quite diappointed.  Yes, there are some funny parts to the movie, but I was more disgusted with some of the supposed &quot;humor.&quot;  It could be that I tend to like movies that have some value or even a plot (even if it didn't have either, some HUMOR could have been good).  I could have done without this movie, but at least now my friends will quit bugging me to watch it.<br />Word of advice:  I wouldn't watch it with kids or with older parents.  Actually, I wouldn't watch it at all.
B00007AJGH|5.0|This DVD set is sure to please anyone who enjoyed the ambitious, innovative and hilarious movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit. In 1988, Roger Rabbit earned several Oscars, combined animation with live action, made British actor Bob Hoskins a star and featured cameos from dozens of Disney, Warner Bros, MGM and Universal cartoon stars.  Director Robert Zemeckis would also direct the Back to the Future series.  <br />The story takes place in 1947 and it all begins with the lovable goofball Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) co-starring with the cute but not-so-innocent Baby Herman (offstage, Herman is a whiney, scowling cigar smoking midget) in What's Cookin'.  It's not long before Roger is under investigation by hapless no-nonsense detective Eddie Valiant (Hoskins).  Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye), owner of Toontown, has been murdered.  Judge Doom (Back to the Future and Taxi's Christopher Lloyd) and his pack of scheming weasels suspect Roger is the culprit, particularly after Acme plays a game of patty-cake with Roger's sultry wife, Jessica (Kathleen Turner).  Jessica's defense: &quot;I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way!&quot;  Roger, Jessica and Valiant do their best to prove Roger's innocence and save the fate of Toontown.   Benny the wisecrackin' Cab is there to help Valiant get to the bottom of it all.  Cameos include Daffy and Donald Duck, Bugs Bunny (voiced by the late Mel Blanc), Yosemite Sam, Mickey Mouse, Tweety, Droopy Dog, Betty Boop (with the original voice of Mae Questel) and many others.  The musical score is composed by Alan Silvestri (Forrest Gump, Lilo and Stitch).  <br />Now for the extras.  There is a spoken commentary as well as a &quot;pop-up video&quot; style commentary on the picture, outtakes including the &quot;pig head&quot; sequence, information on before/after animation, a DVD game Trouble in Toontown, options of widescreen and fullscreen, and (if you're bi-lingual) dubbed in versions in French and Spanish.<br />Finally, it includes 3 RogerRabbit short films, including Tummy Trouble (where Baby Herman swallows everything), Rollercoaster Rabbit (where Roger babysits Herman in an amusement park; my favourite of the 3) and Trail Mix-Up (where Roger takes Herman camping around Yellowstone Park; watch for Jessica's cameos in all of these!).<br />Give yourself a week or 2 to enjoy the movie and all the extras!  Enjoy the ride and leave the driving to Benny, your faithful tourgide!

B000002BFL|5.0|This &quot;companion&quot; to Nebraska-Springsteens earlier acoustic effort-will stand as his masterpiece. It proves that Springsteen, rather than Dylan,is the true inheritor of Woody Gutherie's legacy as the musical spokesman for America's huge underclass. The songs speak to and of all the powerless people in the world's only remaining superpower-the unemployed, the ex-con, the hustler,the immigrant-all the people for whom the American dream is exactly that-a dream. As a piece of art it's like having a record, a novel and a film all in one. My only complaint is that &quot;brothers under the bridge&quot;which was clearly recorded for the album was omitted from the final release.

0142004235|5.0|What is so great and compelling about the stories of Genesis, that of Cain and Abel in particular, is that they are eternal.  Steinbeck successfully conveys this in a modern retelling, where the reader can relate more successfully to all parties involved.  He uses the helpful technique of telling the first story through Adam Trask's eyes, who plays the role of Abel.  For the second generation, it is Aron (the Abel figure) who is now aloof and distant from us and we relate to and understand Cal (the Cain figure.)  However, this is not the only story that is being told.<BR>At the same time is being woven in stories of love, human nature (and seemingly inhuman monstrosity,) betrayal, and pity.  Steinbeck helps us understand these diverse characters by immersing us in them for what seems like years.  This novel really feels like an epic to read, and although it seems to be impregnable and dragging, you finish feeling enlightened and wishing you could read it for the first time again. <br />Clearly the most important message Steinbeck wishes to convey is the element of human choice.  No god or higher power of any sort compels you; your destiny is not predetermined.  You have the choice to do good OR evil whatever your circumstance.  We hope for Cal that he understands that he is not condemned by his mother's evil and his seemingly inherited hatred, and we also relate this precept to our own lives.  For this reason, as well as its simple storytelling merits, I feel that East of Eden far outshines The Grapes of Wrath as a chronicle of the human condition.<BR>Many don't understand Steinbeck's obsession with the Salinas Valley and if they do, they don't understand why they have to be subjected to reams of pages describing it and its inhabitants.  Some reasons may include westward movement (i.e. struggling back to Eden) and also that it provides an effective parallel in many ways to a hard land that is east of Eden.  This is no heavenly garden of Eden, but its inhabitants incessantly toil to overcome.  <BR>To understand about this and many other tools that Steinbeck employs, I highly recommend that with this book you read \\"Journal of a Novel: the Writing of East of Eden\\", (the name is something like that)  In this journal Steinbeck would begin every day of writing with a journal entry to his dear friend and editor Pascal Covici.  He makes obscure references to the book that necessitate constant referral back to the pages, but it is understandable enough.  This journal is more useful in its function of helping the reader understand John Steinbeck and where he is coming from; his passion for invention, his own fears and love for his two young sons (in fact he wrote this for and about them,) and his feelings on contemporary subjects all show what a multi-talented and opinionated man he was.  One of many gems in these pages is his discussion of children, and adults' attitudes toward them.  He basically says that adults often discount the opinions and needs of children as fanciful and useless, because these adults have forgotten what it is like to be a child.  On the contrary, Steinbeck says, adult thoughts only get more cloudy and jaded as they age, whereas the thought of children is pure, deep, and real, even if they can't always effectively communicate it.<BR>So in addition to a helpful companion to East of Eden, Journal of a Novel is important life-reading in its own right.<BR>Anyway, I highly recommend East of Eden and feel that any reader should lay aside a lot of time to read and re-read this complicated and moving novel.  If you go too fast, you might miss something.  In Journal of a Novel, Steinbeck effectively said with no reservations, \\"This is the one.  Everything else I have written has been practice for this one.\\"  This \\"everything else\\" is a distinguished body of literature, so why don't we take Steinbeck at his word and confirm his quest for greatness, realized in this epic.
0671027344|4.0|I was a little skeptical about this book before I began. It's an MTV book. MTV is all about music.. not reading or writing, but I decided to give it a chance. It's rather small, and it's very easy to read.<br />The main character, Charlie, is a boy who is a freshman, a geek, and a loner until he meets Patrick and Sam. They are seniors, and they accept him into their group of friends. Charlie soon falls in love with Sam, but Sam does not want him to, and he'd do anything to make her happy, so he tries not to. He dates her friend but ruins it when he kisses Sam in front of everyone. Charlie also has to deal with his sister and her abusive secret boyfriend, his brother's sports career, and Patrick's problems with his ex-boyfriend. In the end Charlie is left alone when all of the people he knows and love go off to college.<br />I really enjoyed this book. It was written all in letters. Charlie wrote letters anonymously to someone who we never know. The only indication about the mystery letter reciever is that he didn't have sex with someone when he could have. I think it is very interesting that Charlie would choose this means of getting his emotions out rather than using a journal or diary. I feel that the book has an air of sadness over the whole thing, like Charlie is never really happy, but at the same time it's not a sad book, even when sad things really do happen.<br />I liked this book a lot, and I'd recomend it to anyone who likes books like The Cather and the Rye or A Seperate Peace. It is, to me, a semi-modernized version of these.
B000099T2L|5.0|Wow I reallie liked this album wen i first listened 2 it. I mean i knew her album would be good but it was juss amazin...I love tha way she explains whut it feels lyke 2 b a 21 year old in love...her fans get 2 discover the passionate side of beyonce...and how she feels bout tha jigga man.

B00008D1NF|5.0|Those 3 artists make a nice team. Marisa Monte has this amazing voice, Carlinhos Brown is a genius if we talk about rithyms, and Arnaldo Antunes is a poet!<BR>Listen to the songs and have a unique experience!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A must-see, must buy DVD for the western and sci-fi afficionados, and anyone else looking for something, fun, funny, creative, addictive, adventurous and downright entertaining.
B00005R2M3|5.0|It is true that I only became interested in Shakira when this cd was released. I saw her perform on the World Music Awards and figured she would be just another blonde pop diva......<br />Then I saw her video and it seemed to match everything that I was looking for in music. It had a delicious middle-eastern desert feel to it and I immediately bought the cd. I began to flip through the lyrics and realzed that she actually wrote every song. That alone wasn't anything compared to the WORDS in the songs! She was so smart! Her lyrics were so poetic and vivid. I LOVE this cd and SHAKIRA is the reason I like spanish music now!<br />Shakira has been my favorite music artist since she drifted into America, and she has a huge monument of at least 100 pictures on my wall.<br />I definitely reccomend that you buy this cd as soon as possible if you haven't already.....
0385504209|5.0|A great read.  It hooks you in from the beginning.  Dan Brown weaves a great story around the the theories of the Holy Grail, Catholism and art.  I really enjoyed this book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|FOX marketed this as a western.  I hate westerns.  I LOVED Firefly.  The final (original?) two-hour episode \\"Serenity\\" is still lovingly saved on my TIVO because we can't bear to part with it.  The writers of Firefly created characters that are human - not an idealized or perfect one in the bunch, all have their secrets and flaws.  In spite of that (because of it?) the viewer is left with a deep connection and a desire to know them better.  This isn't all CGI flash.  It isn't just schmaltzy character development and human interest either.  Firefly is one of the best shows I've seen on TV in a very long time, and it is a tragedy that FOX didn't realize the gem they had and promote it properly.  Buy the DVD set and watch it - you'll see fantastic acting, action, adventure, suspense, science fiction, frontier justice, and yes, great special effects.
B000002H97|1.0|Not as bad as Load and Reload but highly commercial. Nothing original, only catchy hard rock tunes. For good Metallica get ...And Justice For All, Master Of Puppets or Ride The Lightning. Even my mom is starting to like the new Metallica albums, it's getting scary. Sell outs!!!!
B00009V7P8|1.0|The introspective singer songwriter has become nearly as common as the studio born popstar. So, it takes more than a few thoughtful lyrics, the ability to carry a tune and a sparsely strummed guitar to impress my ears.<br />Rice's voice seems pleasant if not sweet at the onset, but midway through the album his often keening vocals grate on the nerves. The songwriting suffers from an overbearing sincerity and dirge like quality at times. The female vocalist and strings add to the overblown affair, creating a &quot;give me a break&quot; reaction, rather than the impassioned heart pull it strives to be.
B000002ADT|5.0|Many years ago, when I was 14, I walked into a used record store and ventured to the Jazz section. I asked the forty-something clerk whose round granny glasses peered out of a forest of graying beard and curly hair, \\"What do you recommend for a person who knows very little about Jazz except that he likes the real mellow stuff.\\" <br />Without hesitation, he laid an original vinyl pressing of this, one of Miles Davis' many masterpieces in my eager hands. \\"Begin with this. Memorize the musicians. Absorb the sounds. It will springboard you forward and backward.\\"<br />Now I wish I could find that man and thank him for the wonderful world he opened me up for me. KIND OF BLUE is simply a great and beautiful album. Erotic, introspective, and ultimately spiritual, this delightful feast for the ears, heart and loins provides many great discoveries after many repeated listenings. <br />My vinyl licorice platter has long since worn out and my CD version is soon to be played out. KIND OF BLUE led me to immerse myself and discover both John Coltrane, and the others who play on this work of art. It served as my education into the world of jazz- a brave new world that continues to hold wonderful mysteries waiting for discovery.<br />KIND OF BLUE is one of the 20th Century's great works of art.
B000050HTO|5.0|Trying to make a compilation of Bob Dylan's music is equal to taking 30 of Picasso's works, and saying &quot;this is the artist&quot;; the immense creativity is too deep, the development and changes too wide.<br />There will always be songs that the listener will feel were a mistake to omit, and for me &quot;Ballad of a Thin Man&quot; is the one I wish had been in this collection.<br />Disc One starts in 1962, with the folk days of &quot;Blowing in the Wind&quot;, to when he went electric with &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; from the ground-breaking Highway 61 Revisited, to the soft lilting folk/country sound of &quot;I'll Be Your Baby Tonight&quot; from John Wesley Harding, released in 1967.<br />Disc Two starts with the romantic &quot;Lay, Lady, Lay&quot; from 1969's Nashville Skyline, through the 70's and the return of acoustic guitar and harmonica with two songs from Blood on the Tracks, to end the decade with the beginning of his Christian recordings,  and a great track from Slow Train Coming, &quot;Gotta Serve Someone&quot;.<br />Ten years later brings him to the fabulous &quot;Everything is Broken&quot;, from Oh Mercy, and the collection ends with &quot;Things Have Changed&quot; from 1999, which was featured in the film &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;, and the reason I bought this CD set. After viewing the film, what I remembered and liked the most was this powerful, marvelous song..<br />I am one of those that feel no one sings Dylan better than Dylan, and truly enjoy his rough, expressive voice; it is interesting to hear it through the span of  nearly forty years on one compilation...it has become huskier, with a bit more wobble, but to my ears better than ever.<br />Total time for Disc One is 56:24, Disc Two 68:31, and the sound quality varies somewhat from song to song, but overall it is excellent.
B00005R8FI|5.0|For purely sentimental and nostalgic reasons, THE TURNING POINT is my favorite John Mayall album. When I was three, I begged my parents to repeatedly play the exciting harmonica rave-up \\"Room to Move\\". It is virtually impossible still for me not to find my aging bones bouncing and hopping still as Mayall rips into that incredibly invigorating piece. <br />A word of warning: do not listen to \\"Room to Move\\" while driving. My insurance just went up due to a recent speeding ticket. <br />Also many folks may recognize this signature cut as it has become, like the annoyingly infectious \\"Who Let the Dogs Out\\" ubiquitous in sports arenas as a crowd instigator. Of course I obviously prefer the later to the former.<br />The rest of the album is filled with wonderful and intricate musicianship. The guitar, flute and sax interplay is sheer calming brilliance. It provides a great counterpoint to the release of the aforementioned cut. Mayall and his group think loose and play tight like the best of jazz musicians. They fuse elements of jazz, folk, blues and rock.<br />Mayall's often screeching voice is an acquired taste to be sure, but his absolute reverence for the music overcomes any technical shortcomings.<br />A fine album worth discovering.
B00000F3KL|5.0|This film is moving. And it relates to my family in a very personal way. Seeing it was something of an experience. My aunt is married to one of the little bird pilots in this mission, Keith Jones,(he actually has a line in the movie) and he happens to be the father of one of my only 2 cousins. He flew the helicoptors for this film and they wanted him to go to Hollywood to stunt pilot helicoptors. Instead he finished his service in the military and moved with his wife to Lawrence, Ks so she could be closer to her family. I have so much admiration for these men and everything they have done for our country and I believe this film honors these men in any way it can. I am so proud of my uncle and everything he has accomplished. And I am happy to have him here, close to his family in Kansas.
B000089RVX|5.0|This music is very awesome! I love everything about it! If you want orignal, haunting music this is the stuff!
B00005JLTN|5.0|For the simple reason that so many people who even dont like it not that much dont realise when writing the movie that this is a movie split into 2, unlike LOTR which is also split but those split like in the book where they were meant to be split, Reloaded is split right in the middle of Matrix 2 cut into half into reloaded and revolutions, Matrix Reloaded is what Matrix originals first half was like, story development and little action, while matrix revolutions is like the second half of the matrix original with most of it action x 100, you cannot get a full review of reloaded without seeing matrix revolutions, there will always be doubters but they will mostly change thier minds after looking at the epicness of Revolutions which will make the matrix original look like a cartoon. Matrix Reloaded is a perfect set up to the final movie. Per say Revolutions wont have a bigger opening as Reloaded at the Box Office but it will have much stronger legs than Reloaded because most epic trilogies last movie always do just like Return of the King is expected to do and just like Indiana Jones ATLC did. I feel sorry for the people who say this movie is the worst they have ever seen. I hope these people dont like movies like Kangaroo Jack or Ballistics: Ecks vs Sever or rather Charlies Angels 2. If you want to say its the worst movie then you should wait until you see Matrix Revolutions and Reloaded together. 5.5 hours. im sure you wont sit in the theatre that long, thus the split in between. my 2 cents

B00008EY9G|5.0|I just have to say that this movie is what saved the horror & suspense movie world from sheer destruction.  This movie will keep you guessing until the last two minutes.  You will never know what hit you. ... This movie brought meaningful and long-awaited justice to horror and suspense flicks.<br />Now... the acting was (to sum it all up) excellent.  Amanda Peet does the best work out of the whole cast.  Usually, you see her comedic side and she's funny, and on top of that it's [poor] acting.  This movie turned her in the other direction and launched her full speed ahead to the best you can get.  Truly she did an Oscar-worthy performance.<br />The score was perfect... Oscar-worthy.  Acting... right on target, but not all Oscar-worthy.  This film she at least be considered for Best Picture or be nominated because... WOW! I've never liked a film as much as this.  Buy it!  It's a waste of time to rent it and bring it back because you'll just want to watch it again.
B00005J6T0|4.0|True Blue is the record that made Madonna a cultural landmark rather than just a savvy, charismatic pop artist.  Three #1 singles and two more Top Tens put her in the leagues of Michael Jackson, Prince and Bruce Springsteen (with Janet Jackson close by), but how's the music?<br />Most people my age would feel a certain degree of nostalgia towards this record, but in all honesty, I think the music deserves it.  &quot;Live to Tell&quot; achieved almost legendary status thanks to its high-drama arrangement and low, husky chorus and earned Madonna much respectability as a songwriter; &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot; is an instant ear-grabber, brash and melodic (Kelly Osbourne's noisy cover doesn't hold a candle), and the title track is the kind of carefree synth-pop anthem that's an '80s specialty.  But my favourite remains &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;, with its Caribbean rhythms and breezy girl-group-style chorus.  Madonna is one of very few artists who recognize that judiciously used foreign languages make for terrific hooks (&quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, anyone?), and she's used it to superb effect in both &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; and &quot;Who's That Girl&quot;.<br />I held back a star for this album because there are one or two filler tracks, in my opinion, and because sonically this album has dated substantially.  With its tinkling keyboards, &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;'s cheese factor is right up there over even the Duran Duran and A-ha catalogues.  But there's still many quality songs here to qualify this as being one of Madonna's strongest records.
B000063K2W|5.0|Even better than the Luce play upon which it was based, THE WOMEN holds up as well as its infamous contemporaries, THE WIZARD OF OZ and GONE WITH THE WIND.  There's something for everyone here and the all-star female cast members are all at the top of their games.  You will have to watch it a few times to make sure you don't miss a single witty remark, double take or physical bit.  A real gem of a comedy with surprisingly significant insights into the strange dance between the sexes!
B000002LGQ|5.0|I am far from being a Madonna fan, but Like a Prayer is a classic.  This record showed that Madonna -- essentially a singles artist -- is capable of making a thematically coherent, mature album that also features a load of great songs that stand on their own.<br />From the first notes on the record, the apocalyptic guitars that introduce the title track, there's something different about this record.  An attention to detail, an aggressiveness, and also a sophistication beyond her previous releases...and anything else she's recorded since.  \\"Like a Prayer\\" is unforgettable; even though Madonna's voice is hardly gospel material, it's precisely the tension between her dance-pop voice and the Andrae Crouch Choir's booming chants that makes the track so powerful.  A black-white fusion with an unstoppable beat and an instantly memorable chorus.  \\"Express Yourself\\" is not one of my favourite tracks possibly due to over-exposure, but you have to admit, it's another instantly recognizable song and Madonna's mission statement of sorts.  The pop songwriting is flawless on \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\", \\"Keep It Together\\" and \\"Spanish Eyes\\", and \\"Oh Father\\" is hands down my favourite Madonna song.  Who would've thought she could convey so much heart in such a simple song?  The \\"You never wanted to live that way\\" interlude is beautiful beyond words.  Classic video, too, a childlike dream directed by David Fincher.<br />I've heard the whole Madonna canon hundreds of times growing up (there was a fanatic in the house) and most of her music's grown stale on me, except this record.  Because of her adaptability to trends, most of her albums sound dated, so in tune are they with the musical movements of their time.  But if there's one record of hers that stands beyond time, this is it.

B0000667RO|2.0|This collection is the most glaring example of record companies using greatest-hits compilations strictly as marketing tools rather than comprehensive retrospectives.  Leery about damaging sales of the artist's original records, these compilations omit some glaringly important tracks so that, theoretically speaking, you'd have to get the original records on top of the compilations to get the missing tracks.<br />Let's see...what are we missing?  Adams' first #1 hit \\"Heaven\\" (are you *kidding*!?); \\"Cuts Like a Knife\\", one of his early hits; \\"Straight from the Heart\\"; and the underrated, sweeping \\"Thought I'd Died and Gone to Heaven\\".<br />For its hit status, \\"Can't Stop This Thing We Started\\" was a no-brainer; unfortunately, the adjective also applies to the songwriting and performance.  This song remains one of the penultimate annoying Canadian rock songs, alongside \\"Enid\\", \\"You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet\\" and \\"Life Is a Highway\\".  And for song selection, The Best of Me pales in comparison with the earlier Adams compilation, So Far So Good, thanks to the addition of those heinous mid-to-late-'90s Adams compositions:  \\"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\\", with all those repetitive \\"reallys\\", gets on one's nerves fast, especially with the faux-Spanish arrangement; \\"Please Forgive Me\\" is melodic and nice, but also covered in syrup; and the worst of the bunch, \\"All for Love\\" from The Three Musketeers, where Adams, Sting and Rod Stewart combine to make the most unharmonious, mismatched, and plain grating singing partners of all time.  Adams and Stewart's raspy voices already conflict mightily, but add that to Sting's self-conscious faux-reggae phrasing, and you got an aural cacophony.  The songwriting is well below par, as well.<br />I still like the guilty pleasures that form the stronger song choices:  Early album-rock track \\"Run to You\\", the jam-band favourite \\"Summer of '69\\", and the mega-hit \\"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\\".  Cheesy?  Yes.  But also tuneful and a time capsule for 1991.  This little song sold three million copies and touched a chord (the world's best-selling single since \\"We Are the World\\", a record Adams held until Whitney Houston's remake of \\"I Will Always Love You\\").<br />So Far, So Good would definitely have been a better purchase.  I bought The Best of Me from a bargain bin, and even then, it was a waste, given the weak latter-day material and the omissions.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Like any movie, this movie is on its way on being named one of the \\"greats.\\"  Overall, the movie was very entertaining.  Specifically, at the start of the movie, you wondered where they were going with the storyline ... then everything came together and the movie became more and more enjoyable. As fas as the actors, I am not a fan of Renee (even had a problem seeing her in the role she played at first), but her role in the movie was a good one, and matched the roles she played in previous movies, along with Richard Gere playing the slick lawyer looking for which prison women's plight can pay the most.  Now Catherine was GREAT!  Her performance from beginning to end was magnificent.  You have to get the DVD and see it.<BR>Also, I look at Moulin Rouge and Chicago as \\"great performances.\\"  Some, that I have read, has bombed Chicago and praised Moulin Rouge.  Honestly, it depends on the viewer's open mind on what is being shown on the screen.  In short, one movie will not be like the other.  I liked both of them and want BOTH for my DVD collection.
B000096I9G|5.0|Wow, how many bands have such a respect for their audience?  All those thousands of people showing up every night of their tours in black get the love back with this gift from Robert Smith and the band, recorded long after they were supposed to have called it quits. <br />There are rough parts early - let's forget about Short Term Effect, apparently they had never played it live, for good reason, and there are a few misses on other songs they hardly ever play live - but for the most part they are faithful to the material and on target.  Maybe only Cure fans will get this, but so what?  To the Cure crowd, something like this is equivalent to the Beatles rising from the dead and playing Sargent Pepper note for note.  Even to the casual fan this is welcome stuff.  &quot;k'you&quot;.

B00005QIPH|3.0|If I hear the phrase &quot;Saviors of rock&quot; one more time, I think I'll just lean over and puke.  You might like this music or you might not, but either way, its just more pop rock that fills the radio and sounds just like everything else, so get over it.  Just cause some critics say something doesn't mean its true, and just because you agree with them doesn't mean you're smart or sophisticated or something.  Just use your head.
B000066NW0|4.0|Ok I read some of the reviews out there about this CD, saying its good... saying its bad.... sayings this and saying that. As far as pop rock goes she is a good, however manufactured some might claim she is. As for putting her down for the sake of people like Brittany Spares, you got ot be kidding! Brittany could not hold a candle to her, the only thing Brittany holds above everyone is who she going to bed next. I thought this was about music people, not a soap opera! Personally none can hold a candle to Evanescence and Nightwish. If you do not know who they are... search Amazon.com and buy their CDs and learn what real music is about!
B00007DWRZ|5.0|This will always be the CD that reminds me of my recent, first trip to Bahia (I intend to go back every year.)  Warm, lush, gorgeous music.

Buy this CD - I saw a ton of bootlegged copies being sold on the beaches, so I fear Tribalista is not making the money they could be, and they deserve it.
0789723107|5.0|What a refreshing change. A computer book that won't break my foot if I drop it. Just like Krug's usability concepts, the book doesn't contain the filler of other computer books. It just gets right to the point. <br />Brilliant use of common sense which is in very short supply in the Web design world. If a designer followed this book alone they would develop sites that are more usable than 99% of the sites out there. Krug's approach is nothing more than finding the best ways to satisfy the users' request of &quot;don't make me think&quot;. When we read one magazine then pick up another we don't have to learn how to read that second magazine. There are commonalities and guides that all magazines share. Same with newspapers, store layouts, automobile controls, etc. Krug points out the common sense approach that Websites should use to attain that same level of thoughtlessness.<br />As they say, if you're going to buy just one book on usability, buy this one. Then check out the two Jakob Nielsen books too, as well as the O'Reilly book on Information Architecture.
B00005JM1Y|3.0|Being a longtime fan of Blackadder and Mr. Bean, I would watch Rowan Atkinson in anything. \\"Johnny English\\" is a similar premise to Austin Powers, but not nearly as funny or raunchy. But it succeeds as a vehicle for Rowan Atkinson to give some good one-liners and a few unique facial expressions, so I pretty much got what I expected.<br />Johnny English (Atkinson) is a middle-level secret agent who is, by default, given the biggest assignment ever handed down...finding the stolen crown jewels, and to thrwart an evil French billionaore's (John Malkovich) plan to take over England. He is not exactly 007 material, though, and he goes through the entire movie bumbling around and making as many mistakes as he can in the 90 minutes the movie allows. His sidekicks (Ben Miller as his smarter partner, and Natalie Imbruglia as his sexy partner/love interest) spend the entire movie both showing him up and keeping him out of trouble.<br />The acting from Atkinson and, in particular, Malkovich is top notch, considering the type of movie this is. Atkinson plays a less-silly (but equally inept) Mr. Bean, while Malkovich hams it up as a Frenchman with a surprisingly convincing accent. Imruglia has never looked better, and provides the strong female lead needed. The script is surprisingly smart at times, and has a few snappy lines about the French (a popular target in British comedy) that will raise a few laughs. While it it not non-stop laughs, the funny moments are all good ones.<br />\\"Johnny English\\" is just what you would expect- a watchable comedy that has no aspirations to compete with Austin Powers. Going into this movie with the highest of expectations would be a mistake, but if you are looking to lose yourself in a dumb comedy, you can do no better than \\"Johnny English\\".
0743216458|5.0|I am fortunate enough to have taken four history classes given by Dr. Ambrose at the University of New Orleans from 1988-1990. Despite the claims of plagiarism in some of his works, this particular book has not been the target of such allegations and is extrememly captivating in every way.<br />Dr. Ambrose, I am forced to admit, is not the most articulate writer in the world. No, his excellence as a historian lies in his ability to grab issues by the throat and inflict the reader with first-hand accounts of events rather than painting broad brushes of second-hand historical slop.<br />I also must admit that the HBO miniseries gives more credence to the international effort of WWII. The HBO production is a work of art. Being an American author, however, it is understandable that Dr. Ambrose would give favoratism to the Yanks-many of whom he interviewed first hand or through family members. Dr. Ambrose worked harder-often tapping students like myself-to compile first hand accounts from veterans of WWII. Be it by letter, tape or video, Dr. Ambrose was more tenacious than any historian I am aware of in the desire to encapculate the WWII experienc. (The fruit of his labor is the D-Day Museum in New Orleans.)<br />On balance, a brilliant read, especially for military buffs.

B00005QIPH|5.0|I started listening to this album in October of 2002 and am still listening to it in July of 2003.  It's one of those classics that never gets old.  If you like simple stuff, you'll like the Strokes.  They take a simple melody and add complex instrumentals on top of it.  I reccommend it fully.  The only thing I would suggest is that you buy the import version with New York City Cops on it.  That is one of the best Strokes songs out.  Get this now!
0380733358|4.0|Ken Follett's novels are particularly well suited to reading on trains and aeroplanes.  They are short, easy reads which easily survive the interruptions inherent in those surroundings.<br />This novel fits the mold perfectly - the characters are more or less drawn from the stock characters of action/adventure/intrigue stories - the icy cold and thoroughly competent enemy spy, the intellectual, professorial good guy who somehow manages to stay one step behind the spy throughout the story, and the beautiful and thoroughly unqualified female who implausibly saves the day at the last minute.<br />The general plot is that a German spy has discovered the disinformation campaign that the Allies are using to divert attention from the preparation for D-Day.  There is a race to capture or kill him before he can communicate the information to his masters in Berlin.<br />The book is the literary equivalent of a candy bar.  It's not intellectually nourishing or nutritious, but it's a great way to kill some time.
0425129616|4.0|Dame Agatha Christie introduces Hercule Poirot to the mystery novel loving public in this thriller set in WWI. Poirot and a group of fellow Belgians have resettled in an English village, after displacement from their homeland. Poirot has already retired from Belgian police work, speaking fondly of turn-of-the-century cases with friendly Scotland Yard detectives. <br />This is a standard issue murder case with the ancient mansion dweller as the victim.  She is recently remarried and has also recently broken with a long-time friend and companion. Filling out the list of suspects are two step-sons who would benefit financially from her demise and several house guests, including a young pharmacist and a German spy. Poirot is called in the day of the murder and follows his standard practice. He sends cryptic messages to suspects to gauge their response, tracks suspects across the county, and even does primitive forensic studies. The book is written by a resident wounded veteran who was a long-time friend of both Poirot and the family at Styles.<br />There are two features here to recommend this book. The first is the mystery within the mystery structure in which the obvious suspect ultimately turns out to be the guilty one, albeit with an unexpected accomplice. The second is the deliberately researched poisoning mechanism employed. Dame Christie received a positive review in the 1920's from a leading British pharmacology journal for her efforts. For those who enjoy the complex, this book is wracked with it. It is nearly impossible to keep track of all the characters and their myriad interactions with Poirot and each other. Reading it the second time brought out a lot of foreshadowing and important facts, dropped into the text as minor details.

0385509456|5.0|I find it difficult to come up with a more original word than &quot;Amazing&quot; for this book, but it truly is an exceptional tale.  There is no need to describe the plot in this review because it is handled well enough by others, but I do want to say that this is a very unique reading experience--an unforgetable look into the mind and perspective of someone whose brain processes day-to-day information in a way that is very different from the majority of people in the world.  The character's approach to problem solving was absolutely fascinating!!  This book is definitely in my top-ten alltime favorite category; if I could give it SIX STARS I would!!  Don't miss this experience!!
B00005JM1Y|4.0|This movie was funny from the start, however it could also be put as really stupid humer almost as low as Austin Powers. but it had a bit moore sence to it but it was on the line of the old time hit comedy Get-Smart!!
B000068VHQ|5.0|Something I find so unique about the Cranberries is that no matter what bands seem to grace the stage and the radiostations of our time (and there is a lot of empty engineered music out there at the moment)their music always prevails, with moving , emotive and powerful music such as that on NNTA - music that I can connect to emotionally. It's so nice at the end of the day, to vent my frustration with an angst ridden chorus or be soothed by Dolores' angelic vocals. I love all these tracks but my personal favourites are Ode to My Family, I Can't Be With You, Zombie and No Need to Argue. Needless to say, if you buy this CD, it will be money well spent.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera's c.d. Stripped definatly deserves 5 full stars. Even though the cover may be a little racy and some of the lyrics to the songs aren't the cleanest, the music is great!<br />1.Stripped Intro -The intro is very unique and I really like it. It kind of explains that this is her- not the innocent little girl she used to be. 5/5<br />2.Can't Hold Us Down - This track has a nice beat to it and really shows off her voice (not to mention stands up for women), but the lyrics are a little too explicit. 4.5/5<br />3.Walk Away- I don't really know how to explain this song. I just really like it. It's a ballad that requires range and she does it so well! 5/5<br />4.Fighter -In my opinion, this is the best song on the c.d. It has a fast beat and makes you want to dance. The radio's played this song a little too much, but I'm still not tired of it. 6/5<br />5.Primer Amor Interlude - Lets just say I could do without these interludes. They're boring! All she's doing is speaking spanish with a guitar in the background. 2/5<br />6.Infatuation - This is one of my favorite songs. It shows Christina's latin side, but not too much. 5/5<br />7.Love's Embrace Interlude- Uh! Another interlude. Who needs them? 2/5<br />8. Loving Me 4 Me- I don't listen to this one very much. It's a little boring, but has some good parts. All in all, it's okay. 3.5/5<br />9.Impossible - This song is pretty good. If you like R&B, then you'll like this song a lot. 4/5<br />10.Underappreciated - This is a great song. You just want to sing right along with her. It has a great chorus! 5/5<br />11.Beautiful - This shows that Christina does have feelings. .... It's kind of sad. It makes you almost feel sorry for her. 5/5<br />12. Make Over - This song is a little more hard rock than the rest and I like it. It just doesn't show off her voice at all. 4/5    <br />13.Cruz - Great song. It would be good to slow dance to. It is just incredible. 5/5<br />14.Soar - I really like the verse right before thechorus. It's hard to explain this song. 4/5<br />15. Get Mine Get Yours - This song really shows her voice and has a good beat. It's a little too sexual for my taste, but if I don't listen to the words, it probably one of the best songs. 5.5/5<br />16. Dirrty - This is a lot like Get Mine Get Yours, because it is very sexual but other than that is my favorite song. It has a dance beat. 6/5<br />17.Stripped Pt. 2- This is almost exactly like the intro. It's even more dirty though. 5/5<br />18.The Voice Within - This is a nice ballad that is trying to get you to believe in yourself. It shows Christina's less dirty side, kind of like Beautiful. 5/5<br />19. Im O.K.- This is also a ballad, much like The Voice Within, but better. It's about a girl who has an abusive father, and I think it's good to talk about that kind of stuff. 5.5/5<br />20.Keep On Singin' My Song- This song is another ballad. It starts to get a little boring by this point-having all these ballads. It's not very good. 3.5/5
B000089CJI|4.0|this is the most listenable, heartfelt record i've heard in ages.  no aloof, effite indie posturing, just pure wonderful pop songs.  it's about time somebody did it.  i can't stop listening to it.  two years ago, i got DNTEL's 'life is full of possiblities' and loved 'the dream of evan and chan.'  i hoped they would pursue the brilliance of that track and, lucky for me (and for all of you) they did.  cheers to the postal service.  buy it right now.  you'll melt.

B00005JLEJ|4.0|\\"Kagemusha\\" is Kurosawa's 1980 samurai war epic starring Tatsuya Nakadai is set during the late 1500s in Japan, the time period in which the country was torn apart by war.  The film begins with a long shot of 3 men seated in a room.  One is Shingen Takeda, warlord of the Takeda clan, the other is his brother, Nobukado, and the third is a strange man who looks almost identical to Shingen.  Nobukado tells his brother: \\"I have imperonated you for a long time, but this is incredible.\\"  This is the primary focus of the film.  The story revolves around the Takeda clan, and the leader, Shingen.  But one day when he dies, he has to be replaced, and the double found at the beginning of the film is used.  We learn step by step his painful stages in suppressing himself to become another.  In the process, Kurosawa intercuts with the other 2 warlords trying to kill Shingen, Oda (Daisuke Ryu) and Ieyasu (Masayuki Yui; both actors would act in \\"Ran\\").  In creating a war epic, an epic that sometimes feels like a history lesson, Kurosawa has also created a study of identity while intertwining religious and philosophical Buddhist overtones.<BR>        I have seen this film many times and I have had different interpretations every time I saw it.  I think that this might be the most solid of them all. For starters, some knowledge of the time period is necessary if one wants a truly compelling and fulfilling experience.  Without that, there are lose ends and confusion between characters.<BR>        This is a good film; in fact, a very good film, but certainly not at the level of his next film, \\"Ran.\\"  It's not really fair to judge this film on the same level as that, but it is almost inevitable as I have seen \\"Ran\\" many times.  There are strong visual similarities on both.  I do not think this is at the very top of the master's list of films.  I would put it on the 10 best films bu Kurosawa, but not top 5.  It is not edited to maximum impact.  There are scenes that go on for too long showing soldiers march up and down hills.  At times there are far too many silent moments between characters, and certain characters suffer from depth and development.  Katsuyori, Shingen's son, is rather flat and one dimensional.  The Kagemusha's changing into the lord is compelling to watch, as Nobukado notices the phases the double goes through as he becomes another.  Kurosawa raises the interesting and profound question of identity and delves into the issue.  At times, I wish there was more time devoted to the character of the double  rather than time spent in the historical area.  The battle scenes are powerful, but Kurosawa would later outdo them in \\"Ran.\\"<BR>      Many have said that one of the problems in the film is the lead actor.  It is true that the great Mifune is sorely missed, but Nakadai does a fine job carrying both roles in the film.  They say he is too subdued and quiet in his role. But then again, that is the character.  The side performances are good as well, but some did't have much to go with, as the script in ceratin areas was not strong.<BR>       The visuals are among the highlights of the film.  Kurosawa stages a lot of his scenes as paintings (the beautifuly frightening dream the double has comes to mind).  Technically the film is well done.  Kurosawa has changed his camera techniques from his earlier films and rarely does close-ups and or quick cuts between scenes.  His camera is mostly steady and focuses on many long and atmospheric shots, creating a sense of calm and serene beauty even during battles.  The music is fine, but at times is too distracting and melodramatic.  Once again, Kurosawa would fix this in \\"Ran\\" when Takemitsu would do the score. <BR>     It's pretty unfair how I keep bringing up \\"Ran\\" but as I said before, it is inevitable.  I would originally give this film 3 stars until the last half hour which contains some of the most powerful footage I have ever scene.***SPOILER ALERT***  From the moment in which everyone findsout that the double is who he is, the film becomes so sad, so powerful.  The scene in which the double is forced out in the rain is truly heartbreaking to watch.  And the final battle scene is simply breathtaking, horrific, and yet beautiful at the same time. Quick cuts are used as the rifles fire at the Takeda clan, and we can tell, through different perspectives that the Takeda clan is no more. Kurosawa manages to paint a world of hell yet do it artistically without glamorizing war.  The images of the dead horses and soldiers dipped in blood echoes Kurosawa's own past when his brother showed him a city in Japan after an earthquake hit.  His brother would not let him look away, and Kurosawa manages to convey that personal and intimate feeling to us.  And the final image of the dead kagemusha floating past the banner in the lake is just hypnotic.  Kurosawa ends the film just at the right moment.<BR>       \\"Kagemusha\\" has fine performances, an involving story, decent music (at times a little too western-sounding), great photography, interesting characters (Though the script does fall short in certain areas), profound meanings (as all Kurosawa films do), and one hell of a finale.  The last half hour boosts this from a good to a great film.
B000059PR5|2.0|This made-for-TV movie was supposed to show the true horrors of nuclear war.  Oddly enough, most of the controversy raised by the film concerned a teenager and a diaphragm.<br />So the unbelievable happens and nuclear missiles are fired.  From both sides.  Death and destruction abound.  Fallout is visually added as &quot;snow&quot; falling.  Many viewers thought it was real snow except it didn't accumulate.  There are plenty of scenes of wasted fields and herds of dead livestock.<br />Now with the electromagnetic pulse that rendered most technology unusable, the survivors all find horses (from where?) and ride to a town meeting where the speaker tells them they must decontaminate their land.  Of course the speaker cannot tell them how to do it as he doesn't know.  He is just reading from a government-issue survival guide (no I don't know who wrote it, printed it and distributed it in the aftermath).<br />I couldn't help but think that the movie started fairly well, but once the horses appeared it got kind of silly.  If you want to see Jason Robards after the bombs drop, check out A Boy And His Dog (it's just as silly but at least it's honest about it).
B000001EGA|5.0|This is undoubtedly the greatest album ever made, and I'm not just talking Sir Elton's numerous output--I mean it is the greatest album ever made within the pantheon of popular music.  From subtle piano flourishes to full-blown operatic treatments, this album has everything for anyone who has ever followed a dream.  Sir Elton accomplishes much more than garnering my respect as the greatest musician to have graced the last century, it has earned him worship as a true idol.  This entirely biographical album ranges from the honky-tonk influenced licks of the title track to the ice-cold piano and vocals of &quot;Curtains&quot; the final track, whose lyrics are bone-chillingly frigid, honest, screaming in desperation and never opting out for bubbly bubblegum lyrics.  Instead, it offers a subtle operatic treatment to its subject (presumably Elton himself) who is in the midst of magnificent desolation.  Without a doubt, this is an essential disc for anyone's collection, whether a longtime devotee of Sir Elton, or someone just &quot;coming out&quot; and discovering his music for the first time.
014028009X|5.0|Bridget Jones is a 30-ish cog in the corporate machine who feels unappreciated, unheard, and unloved.  This novel is a year in her life, written as a diary, wherein we learn the details of her alcohol intake, party meltdowns, and sexual adventures.  It is all so absurdly funny that the average reader is likely to find it difficult to put the book down.<br />There are a few basic threads that run through the book and intertwine - conflict with her immediate boss (Perpetua!), flirtation with her boss's boss, and her mother's middle-aged crisis (she runs off with a Portugese con artist).  Naturally, the amount of events taking place in Bridget's life do not leave much time for career, so she does little at work except flirt with her boss's boss, then quits to take a job at a Hard Copy type show that sensationalises trivial news.  Through it all, Mark Darcy keeps popping up, acting mysteriously like his namesake from Pride and Prejudice (in fact, the end of the story reads very much like a modern-day remake of that Jane Austin book).<br />This is obviously a very British book, and there are some parts that are slightly confusing for a North American.  For example, what we call \\"*69\\" in Canada (and the U.S.?) is called \\"1671\\" - i.e. dialback numbers of people that have called while you were out.  However, a couple of pages will reveal the context and you can figure out the North American equivalent.<br />The book is written in a very choppy style, as journal entries by Bridget after an event.  As such, the writing is not very dense, and it's easy to breeze through pages just taking a few minutes here and there - a great book to carry in the briefcase.  Men and women are likely to thoroughly enjoy the book - all the characters are slightly stereotyped, and we've all met people like them - the sleazy womaniser, the ditsy blonde, the rabid feminist, the flightly mother, etc.  I would worry if you identify too closely with any of the characters!  =)  Therefore, it's highly recommended as a lightweight farce of life for the modern (single) professional.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I cant believe this CD was dropped down to 4 1/2 stars, this has to be changed.  This CD is one that always stays in my 5 CD holder in my CD player.  It has more emotion in the music than anything I have heard, and it shows that they care about their music.  Thats all I have to say.  Buy it.
B00005JM09|5.0|Well, T3 is by far the best Action/Sci-fi movie of 2003. I think T3 couldn't get any better than what it had of plot and casting crews. I just watched T3 in one of Kuwait's biggest cinemas and in the last eight hours I couldn't take off the image from my mind of the movie and the message its trying to deliver to the viewers. I read many reviews that critisized T3 and said it failed and wasn't as good as T1 and T2, well i think there's something wrong in those people's minds, they think that T3 could get better in plot and directing and acting, i think not, ya'll go and judge yourselves and see what's wrong with your mental brain. T3 has more action sequences than T1 and T2 but what the weak point was John Conner (The guy who played Conner in the movie) was somehow weak in acting performance. Arnold is my best actor in years and in all Terminators he delivered the message very easily to the viewers mind but his performance in T3 wasn't the same as in T1 and T2 (Age played a role) his accent wasn't that scary as in T1 and T2. Arnold failed in many of his recent releases of the late 1990's mostly the ones after the year 1996 movies such as: Jingle All the Way, Batman & Robin, End of Days, and The 6th Day. In those 5 movies, Arnold [ ] with his role and plot of the movies wasn't that good or strong as T3 and his previous movies in his Golden years in the early 1990's and in 1980's. Well, Eraser wasn't that bad was it? it was lacking a bit of storylines to make it a top notch. Collateral Damage was amazing after he failed in his last 5 to 6 movies and Collateral Damage brought him back to the years of action that he was known in. In T3 he gave himself a Golden Oscar whether Holywood or Movie Critics liked it or not. Arnold returned to his golden years when he performed in T1 and T2. This movie is by all means one of the best movies in 2003 and I bet who said it could be any better if they added this and that to direct or produce that movie by himself? Contained Lots of Action no other movie had, even The Matrix Reloaded couldn't get near it. I appreciate The Matrix Reloaded, but sorry baby Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines grinds 'em all. I Will buy it on DVD when it get released i couldn't wait to watch it again and again. By the way, The terminatrix played a good role in the movie but she was a hot chick with bad attitude i think so. GO ARNOLD YOU ROCK, ARNOLD FOR THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA, Yeah BABY...<BR>UPS: Everything, specially the Stylish Lexus SC430 car in the begining..<BR>DOWNS: ;o( The Good Terminator(Arnold) Dies at the end in the Movie ;o(
B000063DS1|5.0|besides this being the ultimate farewell cocnert, there is one sogn on here that is worth buying the whole box set. neil youngs cover of CSNY's &quot;helpless&quot; is so amazing, and beautiful, that its even better than the original. it tops all of the other songs in my opinion, but the other sogns are still amazing. dylan doing forever young is real cool
B000002UHG|4.0|Who would have thought that the best solo work by a member of Pink Floyd would come from keyboardist Rick Wright?  Like most Floyd records, it is a concept album.  Broken China tells the story of a woman's battle with depression. A very Floydian type theme indeed. There are 16 tracks on CD broken up into 4 sections representing the phases of the illness and recovery process.  8 of the tracks are instrumental.  Ironically, I feel these tracks forward the narrative better than most of the songs with lyrics and vocals.  Musically, the CD is very strong.  Mr. Wright uses a variety of keyboards to great effect without trying to dazzle us.  Sinead O'Connor provides vocals for two key tracks.  But it is the rhythm section of Manu Katche on drums and Pino Pallidino on bass that earn this CD its fourth star.  Roger Waters and David Gilmour could take a lesson from this one!
0345357116|5.0|This is a wonderful book for anyone who wants to get deeper into the Silmarillion and LOtR. NOT for the casual reader, though, who will be daunted by the time he reaches the halfway point of &quot;Tuor and His Coming to Gondolin&quot;. And certainly not for anyone who hasn't read the Silmarillion yet. If you were captivated by the tales in the Silmarillion and want to know more, I highly recommend this book--it gives more in-depth tales of characters like Tuor, the Istari, and Galadriel, and there is a particularly lovely story about Aldarion and Erendis that you don't find in the Silmarillion. In all a perfect complement to the initial tales, but not for those unprepared to explore.
0684803356|5.0|Hemingway's story of Robert Jordan, an American college instructor fighting for the Spanish republic, is a beautiful story of desperate love and the death of an ideal.  <br />Robert Jordan has been assigned the task of blowing up a bridge behind Fascist lines in support of a Republican offensive.  He is sent to a guerrilla camp in the mountains behind the lines, where he meets those who are to help him with this task. He also meets and falls in love with Maria, a young Spanish woman who was brutalized by the fascists, and rescued by the band in a previous raid.  <br />Hemingway details the nature of the war in the way that only he can, using his stark prose to depict the decay of the idealism that characterized the beginning of the Spanish Republic.  This is particularly evident in the character named Pablo, a once-fervent fighter for the Republic who has lost hope in the cause and just wants to be left alone in the hills. Each character has his own idea of the Republic and why they are fighting, which is as truthful a depiction of the Republican cause as could be hoped for.<br />There were three parts of this book which really stood out for me.  The first was Pilar's account of the execution of the fascists in her village.  Pablo's ruthlessness, along with the growing terror of the people who go from reluctant participants to bloodthirsty mob, is terrifying in its escalation and horrible finish. Second is the final stand of El Sordo, who accepts his fate, but draws a little pleasure and satisfaction in his efforts.  Third is the final battle in Chapter forty-three.  Hemingway doesn't overdramatize things, he realizes that things are dramatic enough, and the straight-forward presentation of the battle as things go well and then get worse carries much more impact as a result.  The stark, straight-forward writing makes these events come to life as tragic circumstances not only for the dead, but for those who survive as well.<br />I would suggest that any reader do a little research into the Spanish Civil War before reading this book, as a little knowledge of the circumstances and people  of the war (like Marty and La Pasionaria) will enrich the story immensely.<br />This book is very compelling reading, as Robert Jordan struggles with love and duty, while both fearing and accepting his dangerous assignment.  In the abstract, this book is about the death of the ideal in Spain, the corruption and dissent which led to the demise of the Republic.  Hemingway conveys these ideas in a way that only Hemingway can, weaving a fabric of sadness and beauty amid hopeless circumstances.
B00005JLXE|1.0|Ok this movie was absolutely horrific. It did not follow the comic very well. I felt Ben Afleck was Not Good. And Jennifer Garner as ELEKTRA (one of the greatest characters in comic history). I Think one person who could compare to Elektra at all would be Catherine Zeta Jones.  And Why Would FRANK MILLER The absolute best of them all evn want to have a small cameo. Frank Miller Took Daredevil to where it became greatness in the 80's and should have written the script.Whats with changing Kingpin to a black man. Im Not racist or anything but come on KINGPIN is not BLACK!! I give one star because its the lowest i can go!
B00005JLZN|5.0|Kevin Spacey, Laura Linney, and Kate Winslet perform remarkably  in this not-talked-about-enough movie.  Spacey plays David Gale, a man who has tried to live by his principles, but in a bizarre turn of bad luck, this devoted father, popular professor and respected death penalty opponent finds himself on Death Row for the rape and murder of fellow-activist Constance Hallaway (played by Laura Linney). With only three days before his scheduled execution, Gale chooses reporter \\"Bitsey\\" Bloom, played by Winslet, for a series of final interviews to explain how he was wrongly convicted.  <br />If you have strong pro-death penalty opinions or are religiously devoted, and are not open to having your views challenged, this film may not be your cup of tea.  <br />This movie is done with flashbacks, which creates suspense and interest.  The banter between Bitsey and the intern that is assigned to accompany her at all times adds humour and shows the human side to the career-minded Bitsey.  It is a thinking person's movie, and it is as disturbing as it is thought provoking.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|First off, just like everyone else does, I am going to say that this is NOT a punk album.  Anyone who is expecting a disc like the Clash's self-titled or Give 'em enough rope should know this immediately.  However, it definitely belongs in a punk collection, or any collection for that matter.<br />So what makes London Calling one of the greatest albums of all time you ask?<br />First of all, it's diverse.  The Clash has always been known to experiment with various musical styles (&quot;Police and Thieves&quot; from the s/t, &quot;Julie's been working for the drug squad&quot; from Give 'em enough rope), but on London Calling they almost completely abandon their punk rock sound and experiment with many more genres of music, creating an album that is wonderfully diverse.  No two songs sound the same and there is something for everyone, even those who are completely unfamiliar with the Clash or even punk rock.<br />Second of all, the songs all rock!  Everyone of them has a totally unique sound and they all sound awesome!  There is not ONE track of filler.  Not many bands can claim to have a record without THAT complaint attached, let alone a double album.  The Clash pulled off a 19 track, hour-long masterpiece that never, ever gets old or tiresome to listen to.  It is simply a delight to the ears.<br />Thirdly, on this album, Joe Strummer is at his peak.  His unrefined singing is full of such emotion and passion, it's almost scary.  &quot;Lost in the Supermarket&quot; and &quot;Spanish Bombs&quot; could bring tears to the eyes, while &quot;Revolution Rock&quot; and &quot;Brand New Cadillac&quot; will simply rock your world and get you amped.<br />London Calling is a very hard album to describe in words.  If you are a fan of rock music in any way, shape, or form, I give London Calling my highest recommendation.
B00003CXIY|2.0|&quot;Road Trip&quot; is just yr average teen raunch comedy (in addition to being one of thousands that stuck their fingers in the American Pie) and while certain parts of the movie are enough to inspire a grin or a chuckle, the movie's points are scored by the posters in Breckin Meyer's room: Archers of Loaf, Swans, Superchunk, etc etc etc...but perhaps this was just used to up the hip factor.<br />Save your $$ and buy albums by any of these three bands!
B000002WCJ|5.0|Well, if you read all reviews about this album, you may find the word CLASSIC in almost every one. Ummh,why is that,  coincidence? Lack of creativity while writing a review? I don't think so. IT IS A CLASSIC metal album for sure. And the word classic means a lot. Keeper II was one of my first powermetal album, and even now, after listening a huge number of excellent bands and albums, I have to say that it is imposible not to get highly excited when you listen to it. You cannot listen to Invitation + Eagly Fly Free or March Of Time or I Want Out or Keeper Of The Seven Keys without a cold chill in your back. You cannot listen to Rise and Fall or Dr. Stein without a BIG HAPPY smile in your face! And of course, you'll be singing or screaming the lots of glorious choruses immediately! (Eagly Fly Free --> maybe the most glorious chorus in ANY song!). But besides the feelings, it's important to mention that Helloween, with the keepers, defined how powermetal should be. It's a Classic for sure, believe all reviewers!!!  <BR>_(sorry if I made some english mistakes)_
B0000A1RJI|3.0|Like many of the viewers who have already commented on this page, I knew I had to grab my hands on this CD the moment I left the theatre.  The credits which replayed the main theme was the icing on the cake.  My first disapointment was seeing that I would have to wait for almost two weeks to buy the soundtrack as it came out on July 22nd.  That in itself is downright puzzling as most movies now will even release the soundtrack before the movie even hits theatres.  <br />Now after finally finding a store that had this CD, I knew my wait would be well worth it.  I couldnt wait to hear the main themes that sounded so unforgettable in the movies.  <br />While the music on this CD is great, I could not help but be terribly dissapointed by what Walt Disney records put out to buysers.  If the music wasn't so amazing, I would consider getting a refund on the CD.  The organization of this CD has got to be the poorest quality I have ever seen on a movie soundtrack.  Its as if a six year old snuck into the studio, hit a lot of buttons that put random pieces of music together and the producers never caught it.  <br />Not one title save for one or two has the correct music attached to it.  When seeing track #7 was &quot;Barbossa Is Hungry&quot; I knew the music would be when Ms. Swann found out that the pirates were cursed.  But no, on this CD you hear the main theme played.  <BR>The first track &quot;Fog Bound&quot; has a happy fiddle playing in the beginning of it, when there was none to be found in the movie.  Track #14 is titled &quot;One Last Shot&quot; which is in reference to Captain Sparrow using his bullet on Barbossa, which killed him.  Instead the music heard on this track is of the final few minutes when Jack escaped onto his boat and Will and Elizabeth kissed.  <br />These are just a few examples of the terrible disorganization that appears on this CD.  To top it off, nothin is even in sequence.  The &quot;Underwater March&quot; which is track 13 comes after the music you hear in the final battle which is &quot;Skull and Crossbones&quot; on track 11. <br />The final kick in the but was the total track time on the CD, which is just a shade under 44 minutes.  Does Disney think we're that dumb to think there was just 44 minutes of music in a 2 1/2 hour movie?!  Music from two of the four major battles are missing, those being the fight between Jack and Will in the shop and the crew of the Black Pearl taking over the ship that Jack had stolen.  <br />So lets see Disney, you leave 30 mintues of the CD blank, you give us music that isnt chronological, and you dont give accurate titles.  Essentially, you would have to see the movie about 15 times to know where the music fits in scence for scene. <br />Now after all is said and done, I am still giving it three stars because the music is that good.  The main theme in this soundtrack has got to be one of my 5 favorites of all time, and having over 100 soundtracks, thats a statement not taken lightly.  Sure it may sound like Hans Zimmer's &quot;Gladiator&quot;, but c'mon, everything done by Zimmer sounds similar.  &quot;The Rock&quot;, &quot;Crimson Tide&quot;, &quot;The Peacemaker&quot;, all sound nearly the same.  Gladiator joins the ranks of those three in some scences.  So why are we to think that one of Zimmers disciples Klaus Badelt isnt to do the same.  Harry Gregson-Williams, Trevor Rabin, and Badelt all have the same percussion dominant touch in their soundtracks, just as Zimmer did in his 1990's glory.<br />Sure it may sound repetitive, but if you enjoy that kind of music, who cares?  Don't you think Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach had music that sounded similar at some point?  That is a bad comparison, but each composer has his/her own style, so if you loved Gladiator, you wont be dissapointed in this music.<br />In closing, if you loved the music as much as I did, buy the soundtrack.  But be warned, there are a lot of problems with this CD which will downright annoy you.  But forthose 10-15 minutes where you can clearly picture the scences in the movie, or when you hear that main theme playing, you'll know the money was worth it.
0385504209|5.0|this is already one of my all time fave books! i'm really looking fwd to the next langdon adventure!
1400034779|5.0|Botswana lady sleuth Mma (pronounced \\"mee-muh\\" in my head, but represents your standard gender term for a female) Ramotswe solves local Botswana crimes: family problems, fraud, kidnappings and disappearances. What makes this book so readable (for me) is that the \\"crimes\\" are rather mundane compared to what we see on the 5 o'clock news. This is a welcome change when one has grown tired of all those mystery novels out there that start with a dead prostitute lying face down in a city gutter and the ubiquitous hard-boiled detective spouting hardened prose like, \\"In a city like this, you wake up everyday wishing you were dead\\". This book is also worth a read as the story is peppered with local images/cultural idiosyncrasies that one might not know about Africa and, more specifically, Botswana.
B000088E6D|4.0|I just bought this CD 3 days ago, and I've played it probably 10 times already.  Its a pretty good album - Michael Buble has a very good - although Sinatra/Torme/Connick - sounding voice.  The arrangements are well made too - but Just The Way You Look Tonite should have preferably been arranged as a slow croon rather than bossa nova style.<br />I usually look into the Tower reviews to see if anybody else liked the CD's I buy, and it seems that a lot of other people like MB as well as I do.  There are however a few people who really blasted him in their reviews.  Not only blasted, but outright insulted him - a Karaoke singer!?  Really now.  Around 10 of 155 reviewers gave him 1-3 stars, and all I can say is that talent is in the ears of the beholder (or in this case, the listener).  Measuring MB on the review scale, he is most obviously a talented singer who has moved his audience.<br />I hope MB comes out with his own album of The Great American Songbook.  I'll be looking forward to hearing it, and reading the reviews.
0316666343|4.0|I found this to be well written and I just couldn't put it down.  It is an interesting story that encourages the reader to view life from a different angle.  The story was a bit upsetting, but I would recommend it.
0446605409|5.0|There's nothing better than picking up a book and reading for the simple pleasure of the entertainment. If you like mystery, adventure, sarcasm, laughter and a touch of danger, Plum Island is for you. This is a well written book that affords pretty accurate insight into what men really think, but don't say. This book delivers it all. A page turner that will keep you laughing, while having its sad points along the way. I sincerely hope that Det John Corey becomes a DeMille regular.
B000000WF9|5.0|This soundtrack contains the best scores ever written and once again, it was done by Michael Nyman.  He is, in my opinion the best contemporary composer who has created some of my other favorite music from movies such as the Piano, and the End of the Affair.  The music is amazing...when i listen to it, i am touched in a way no other music has been able to make me feel.  This soundtrack moves you with it's haunting, yet calm, rich yet gentle melodies.  Not only that, but i also recommend the movie because it is also a masterpiece.  And the music goes soooo well with the film that it is just perfect.  Both create a very insightful perspective for the viewer.  I think both music and film is underrated...i am suprised i didn't hear about this from other people and found the movie myself.  It should be more recognized and awarded for it's beautiful performance that will stay with me for a very long time.
B00000JHAU|4.0|Being a big fan of &quot;The Boy With the Arab Strap&quot; and especailly of &quot;Tigermilk&quot; I can't figure out why I didn't get around to listening to this sooner. This album is amazing! Stuart Murdoch's voice alone is so beautiful and unique that Belle and Sebastian stand leagues away from any other band. And this album is a great &quot;album&quot; not just a compilation of songs. This should be a staple in every record collection especially for those who love Belle and Sebastian.
B000091KVL|4.0|When I first listened to this I knew it was different - not like anything you'd hear on the radio - definitely not like any of the popular bands - a very unique sound - kind of like being in a mosh pit - your constantly being bombarded with different musical styles and sounds - one minute calm and surrealistic, the next it's loud and pounding you ears and senses. Give this one a try . . .
6303430570|5.0|Clerks is one of the funniest movies ever. Even for a debut, Kevin Smith proves that he is a comedic genius. <br />The cast of characters in Clerks is very diverse and realistic. The 'protagonist,' or 'main character' of the movie is Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran), who is a college dropout who has no ambition, and overcompensates for having to come to work on his day off (his ctach phrase throughout the movie: \\"I'm not even supposed to be here today!\\"). He's like Holden Caufield: he has potential, he is intelligent, he sees the problems wrong w/ society \\"Dealing with every backwards [person] on the planet\\" at one day of work, but, like Caufield, feels content with just lamenting about it, even though his girlfriend, Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti in her only known movie role), encourages him to get out of the rut he is in and return to school. <br />Then there is Randall (Jeff Anderson, a regular in Kevin Smith movies), the misanthropic employee of an adjacent video store, who is known for telling off customers, and regularly closing the video store to hang out w/ Dante and harass his customers. In a literary sense, you can see him as Nietzsche: he denounces his fellow man, believes that women are inferior (proven by his bizarre tastes in adult videos) and questions authority. He also tries his best to give his friend, Dante, a sense of direction in his life.<br />Throughout the movie, you are exposed to Dante's everyday problems, like the struggle of dealing with his situation (working in a convenient store for minimum wage), his girlfriend's rather promiscuous sex life (37!), and the feelings he still has for his ex-girlfriend, Caitlin Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer). Dante is exposed to a variety of people during his day at work, including a gum representative who incites a riot against cigarettes, his hokcey player friends, former high school classmates, and two regular stoners who spend their time hanging around the store harassing people (Jay and Silent Bob).<br />Clerksis a comedy classic that will be legendary. The free use of adult language and sexual themes may turn off some people, but the humor of this movie is undeniable. It's hilarious, as it is philosophical. This movie contains many notable quotes, and whether you like it or hate it, you will remember it.
B000002KGT|5.0|What can I say?  This is the pinnacle of the Fleetwood Mac years.  At the time of its release this album spent more time at number 1 than any other album had since Elvis or White Christmas.  And today?  It's still as fresh as ever!
0316666343|5.0|hello. i am fifteen years old and i dont know much about life, death, and all that stuff. This book gave me so much insight, its almost overwhelming. I had to share with everyone else the feeling that I got from this book. Like it says in the title, this is one of the best books i have ever read, if not the best. It may be a little mature, but all the same it teaches you a great lesson about life. It is sort of sappy, (i cried eight times) but i feel personally that without the sappyness it wouldnt have been a great book. If you only read one book in your entire life, read this one!
0156012197|5.0|I first read this almost thirty years ago as part of my French A Level course. I have read it every couple of years ever since. It has always been one of my favourite all time books. Is it a childrens' or a grown up's book. Who cares? It speaks to everyone.<br />It is the simple tale of a pilot who is grounded in the desert and meets the enigmatic Prince who has come from another planet. A tiny planet inhabited by the Prince and his beloved flower - and the constant fear of Baobab trees which could overwhelm everything. It is so small that he once watched 44 sunsets. He watches these when he is sad. How sad he must have been on that day observes the narrator. It is a beautiful story about friendship. We laugh as much as we cry. The author's drawing of the empty landscape after his friend's departure still chokes me.<br />But there is also the humour. Normally at the expense of our bizarre adult world. The Prince meets a merchant who sells a pill that means there is no need to drink. This could save several minutes each day. The Little Prince observes that if he had that time he would go to a fountain and have a nice cool drink.<br />St. Exupery is much loved in France. He was even on the money before the Euro arrived. This is much deserved for this little classic alone. Read it in English or French or whatever you like. But read it - now.
B000092ZYX|1.0|People often don't know what to make of something new--they can be repelled by its alien nature, or they can be attracted by its uniqueness. With Kid A, Radiohead presented something new, at least for them (it didn't seem so much \\"new\\" as a hasty spit-and-chewing-gum job on some different, disparate influences)...and the reaction that seemed to prevail (especially among music critics) was to embrace \\"new\\" just because it was, after all, new...kind of. Kid A was followed by Amnesiac, taken from the same sessions (and not nearly so new any more), and now we have Hail to the Thief. All three albums have received thunderous acclaim and increased the band's devoted following.<br />Well, so much for new.<br />I am of the opinion that the critics (and the fans) got it wrong, not just with Hail to the Thief, but with Amnesiac and Kid A before. Quite simply, this stuff borders on unlistenable. Thom Yorke's angst schtick has grown very tired, and he doesn't possess an interesting enough voice to make his whining appealing. The pulsating rhythms give these records the feel of porno soundtracks, or maybe the background music for water-skiing highlight films, seeming less innovative than simply repetitive. It's truly hard to believe that this is the same group of lads who gave us The Bends years before. Yet their legend grows...in spite of songwriting that has become minimalist to the point of being nonexistent, and performances that sound so detached and uninspired that one is forced to wonder how anyone stayed awake during recording.<br />It's clear that there are two Radioheads: the guitar band of Pablo Honey and The Bends (and most of OK Computer), and the tripped-out electronica fetishists of their three most recent albums. If you like one or the other (or both, for that matter), then good for you--but don't give this current version an automatic free pass based solely on the high quality of their previous efforts. <br />It seems to me that Radiohead are trying to see how far they can push into incoherence, weirdness, and deliberate mediocrity before they lose the adulation of the critics and fans. The answer, apparently, is even further than they could possibly have guessed; in fact, they have yet to nudge that boundary, as evidenced by the nearly unanimous praise seen here.<br />Sure, it's interesting to listen to this stuff. But really, is Hail to the Thief something you'll want to drag out in a few years and rock out to? Or will it gather dust? I have nothing against the new or weird--but there has to be some genuine inspiration to back it up. I simply don't detect that here.
B00009RGBS|5.0|My favorite movie used to be Moulin Rouge and I do still enjoy it, but I'd have to say Chicago is a better movie.  I loved the songs and love the Soundtrack.  THe acting is great and I saw this movie twice in the theater and I am thinking about purchasing the DVD. Also it keeps you entertained and is anything but boring. Many, many other people loved this movie so don't pass it up just because, like, two people didn't enjoy it.
B00003CXSM|5.0|This film's surprise ending blew me away.  I won't reveal it -- but what we have is a wedding planner (Hennifer Lopez) who meets and falls in love with a doctor (Connor McMatthews, or whatever his name is, that bland bongo-playing actor) and then finds out she is planning his wedding.  In the meantime, it's announced that she also is engaged (to someone else), so the stage is set for her to be married to someone else, and for the doctor to be married to someone else, yet they love each other.<br />You're just not going to believe the outcome.  It came completely out of left field, the twist the screenwriters imparted in this one.  Hold onto your hat, because you will be completely astounded at the ending.
B00005JM09|2.0|It had to happen sooner or later: Another Terminator movie. It took 12 years to get it made, but after having seen it, I must say that it was not worth the wait. The first film was a masterpiece of modern cinema, T2 was disappointing, but this latest entry in the series is quite simply a travesty. Here are the main problems:<br />1) At the end of T2, we were led to believe that Judgement Day had been averted. Now in T3, we are told that it was just postponed. Why is that? The explanation offered in the movie is very thin and it is difficult to follow the logic (think about it).<BR>2) Nick Stahl was a poor choice for the John Conner role. Clearly, it should have gone to Edward Furlong again.<BR>3) Too much comedy. All those stupid one-liners ruined the first half of the film. And as for that male stripper....<BR>4) No Linda Hamilton as Sarah Conner. Claire Danes' character was a poor substitute as female hero.<BR>5) Finally, the whole movie was obviously just an attempt to relauch the series, since the ending made it pretty obvious that there will be a T4.<br />Let's hope that Arnie will be elected govenour, so this series can be put out of its misery (although it is possible that they will make another one without him).
B00005JLZN|3.0|Since the theatrical release of this movie, I have wanted to see it, but since I am only 16 I can not get into R rated movies to easily, unless I want my 40 year old parents there, so I decided to wait until it came out on video and just buy it.  <br />So, what did I do when it came out?  I bought it.  I watched it.  I had very high expectations because I love movies that have twists and turns and unexpected storylines involved.<br />So, here's the premise of the movie.  A brilliant philosophy professor, David Gale (Spacey), is accused of murdering a fellow death penalty abolishonist, Constance (Linney).  Gale grants a reporter, Bitsey Bloom (Winslet), 3 interviews, 2 hours a day, the three days before his execution is scheduled to take place.<br />Bitsey goes to the interview solidly believing he is guilty.  But as he tells his story, she starts wondering if he is actually guilty, and goes searching for clues, to prove or disprove his verdict.<br />That's really all I can say, I suppose, without giving out too much.  This movie is VERY good in some parts, but once one part of the plot is revealed, it was easy to guess the so-called \\"heart-pounding conclusion,\\" or the quote that is on the DVD cover.  <br />The other reason this movie only got 3 stars, was that it was a play for morality, and basically just a message that the death penalty is wrong and the justice system is flawed.  I do not need a morality trip on a movie, I want entertainment, and it leaves you feeling downright stupid, to be blunt, especially if you are a Texan, if you support the death penalty.
0805209999|4.0|The Trial is a book not meant for people who like to read modern mindless babble by the likes of King and Koontz.  This book will force you to think to get anything out of it.  But especially interesting and enlightening was the chapter entitled &quot;The Cathedral&quot;.  There's a lot of insight in this single chapter that not only will help explain a lot of the book, but also possibly make the reader think about his/her own life in a slightly different perspective.
6305508550|5.0|Office Space is one of the most hilarious movies I have seen in my life. I keep trying to relate the characters to people I know, which makes me laugh even more. There is humor to be found everywhere whether it be in a Swingline Stapler or a &quot;Going-Away Present&quot;.
0066620996|5.0|Should it come as a surprise that a thorough research project, which set out to find the combination of elements that businesses use to become great, discovered that: (1) Great leaders maintain humility and will (2) Great companies seek to put the best people in the right places in their organizations (3) The best people are not afraid to face the \\"brutal facts\\" (4) Great strategic directions are established through understanding (5) Great organizational cultures are characterized by discipline and commitment, and (6) Great companies employ technology intelligently not hastily? I would think not, yet somehow, Jim Collins' work (and the work of his sizable team of researchers) reads like a series of remarkable revelations, which provide insight on the processes of organizational greatness. What is perhaps most amazing about this work (and it is amazing in many ways) is how Collins and his team created such a simple and readable book about an utterly complex subject. <BR> <BR> Collins and his team set out to find what it takes to a make a great company. They measured greatness by a corporate performance. If a company's stock returns beat the general market by more three times over at least fifteen years after previously being at or below the market for at least fifteen years, it landed itself in the good to great category. Eleven companies made it onto the good to great list from the 1, 435 publicly traded companies that were initially evaluated. Once the eleven companies were identified, Collins' research team explored them and their comparison companies, those that could have made the jump to greatness but didn't, to discover what they did that others didn't. The book is a detailed explanation of the six elements of greatness and how they contribute to a calculus of change, growth and improvement. <br /> This book will not disappoint anyone interested in organizational culture, leadership or change. It is loaded with personal and organizational stories from the goodto great companies. Nor will it trouble anyone interested in research as Collins and his team include detailed explanations and analyses of their methodologies throughout the book and in an epilogue and appendix section of more than fifty pages. <br /> The good great leaders were all \\"level 5\\" executives. They combined personal humility with resolve. Comparison company leaders, while skilled and sometimes brilliant, lacked one or both of these leadership qualities. In ten of the eleven good to great companies, the level 5 leaders were hired from within the company. They brought not only knowledge to their work, but a also fundamental passion for and love of the company and its goals. Good to great companies focused first on people and second on task. These companies sought to bring the best people to their quest. Often bringing in the right people meant not hiring the person with the most knowledge, but instead with the right combination of character traits. (\\"Good to great management teams consist of people who debate vigorously in search of the best answers, yet who unify behind decisions, regardless of parochial interests.\\" p. 63) The great leaders displayed unfailing courage in collecting and understanding data. Not driven by ego or idealism, these leaders faced the facts and directed their companies accordingly. (In these companies a culture in which \\"people have a tremendous opportunity to be heard, and ultimately for the truth to be heard\\" was apparent.) (p.88)<br /> The good to great companies all embraced \\"the hedgehog concept\\": an understanding about what they were deeply passionate; clarity about how to measure their bottom line; and a shared vision for what they could do better than anyone else. On average, it took four years for these companies to get to the hedgehog concept. Great people put the long term interests of the company ahead of their own short term goals. They exhibited \\"disciplined action\\" and were fanatical about adhering to the hedgehogconcept. \\"A culture of discipline is not just about action. It is about getting disciplined people who engage in disciplined thought and who then take disciplined action.\\" (p.142) The people in the good to great companies responded to social and technological changes \\"with thoughtfulness and creativity\\" instead of being \\"motivated by fear of being left behind.\\" (p.163) (Of the eighty-four interviews conducted with leaders in the good to great companies, 80% didn't mention technology at all as one of the top five factors in their transition to greatness.) Interestingly, the good to great companies spent little if any time working on culture, commitment, or alignment. In an environment where leadership and vision are strong, those processes largely take care of themselves. \\"Alignment principally follows from results and momentum, not the other way around.\\" (p.187) <br /> This book will always have a special place on my book shelf. While it is fascinating and instructive on many levels, it has provided nourishment for my soul. What it tells us is that great organizations and people are fundamentally good. And, no less importantly, it reminds us of how important the right people are to an organization. I am comforted by the possibility that I and others I respect are not so replaceable after all.
0385504209|5.0|I finished this book yesterday, but I was ready to write a review about half-way through.  I loved this book and could not put it down.  I have always enjoyed a good murder-mystery, but this book far exceeded my expectations.  I had no idea what I was walking into when I started reading Dan Brown.<br />I learned so much.  I kept looking back toward the first page that says FACT: and goes on to list the organizations, artwork, architecture, documents and secreat rituals in this novel are real and described accurately.<br />I am recommending this book to everyone that I know.  Not only was I learning a new and factual way to look at our history throughout the entire story, the suspense of the murder-mystery wouldn't allow me to put this novel down.<br />You will not be disappointed.
0060920084|1.0|&quot;The Lost Continent&quot; is a huge disappointment of a book.       Bryson is mean spirited, disrespectful, cynical, redundant, and seldom funny. I have not traveled to most of the states in this book, so it's not as if I was personally insulted by his comments. The only other Bryson Book I have read is a &quot;Walk in the Woods&quot;, so this book is a bit of a surprise.  I doubt that I will waste my time reading any of his other books.
1577311523|5.0|I have been a Buddhist monk myself, and while Eckhart Tolle's teaching has parallels to the Buddhist Mindfulness practice, he manages to explain things in a clear and very useful manner you very very rarely find. I follow the Hermetic path as well, but I find that the teachings in this book are extremely beneficial and powerful to use in every day life. Thank you to Eckhart Tolle for expounding these timeless teachings so well. They can truly transform your life in the deepest sense, and they can do it here and now. You don't have to wait for this or that thing, relationship, or spiritual breakthrough, as the ego so often wants you to believe.
078062582X|4.0|I never watched this for a plot, I watched it to see Demi naked, get a few laughs.  People who expected a bigger plot or some kind of huge message are pretty narrow minded in how they enjoy something.  This movie was to satisy a few simple carnal pleasures like great female nudity, and a few laughs.  If you need satisfaction from 500 different things and tear the movie apart your just going to disappoint yourself too often.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|It is the power and soul that echos through his lyrics which make this a truly great album.  It is a must own.  Gavin Degraw has a voice that will enchant you and stir jealousy in your veins. If everyone had half an ounce of the raw talent that this young artist does, our world would be a truly wonderful place to reside.  The lyrics are catchy, but it is the voice that is going to pull you.  Live he is incredible, and I am amazed at the records ability to capture the volume of his voice.  Buy this album you will not regret it!!!!

6305252572|5.0|Im not a video buff but when I used to shop here, I bought a few of my favorite movies on DVD. This was one of them, its' not remastered or anything its' simply that DVDs' last waaaaaay longer than VHS tapes. Paramount Pictures' '48 HRS.' came at the right time and in the right form, there were BIG reasons it made over $80m. at the box office in no time. SNL star Eddie Murphy who had never done a picture, was picked up by Walter Hill at age 21 to star along side veteran actor Nick Nolte in this, the kind of movie nobody had ever seen before. It was a low budget, very basic film with a few mistakes like scenes that were filmed for the middle or end of the movie were spliced into the beginning, but '48 HRS.' started the entire craze that has now become something all actors and filmmakers can rely on..the scenerio that is. Detective Jack Cates (Nolte) is the sloppy, alcohol-chugging and chain-smoking edgy cop, who gets a smooth-talking B.S. artist convict (Eddie Murphy) out of jail for 48 hours to hunt down a ruthless escape killer (A young James Remar) and his partner (former 70s' porn star Sonny Landham). Drenched with racial tention between the two, graphically foul language and a few nude women, the movie has a rough edge that is still admired today, 21 years later. I see these ads for movies like 'Bad Company' this and 'Bad Boys' that..hey, if you're a fan of the actors or just bored one night theres your movie but in reality they ssssuck. '48 HRS.' layed the groundwork, without which there would BE no 'Training Day', 'Rush Hour', 'Enemy of the State'...not the exact way they were made anyway. The intense 1982 comedy/drama began inspiring film and tv in less than a year in fact..1984's 'Beverly Hills Cop' which was originally written for Sylvester Stallone, became another spin-off of the '48 HRS.' story as did 'Miami Vice', 'Stakeout', 'Lethal Weapon' and others that were huge hits also. Margot Rose is the one I love seeing every time I flip by this movie on tv, god she was sooo cute when she was younger...still cute now, older but cute. There are a few scenes missing from the DVD that you ironically may catch when its' on prime time tv, I mean they're not important, its just kind of odd that they did'nt print them on the disc. '48 HRS.' was one of the movies I used to always love watching with tremendous amounts of alcohol (I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT FOR ANYONE, NOBODY BLAME ME IF YOUR KID STARTS DRINKING), my point being its a classic American movie that wont ever grow old, Eddie Murphy's 10 minuet scene in Walter Hill's fictional 'Torchy's' bar is what made this superstar famous...think of what might've happened to Eddie Murphy if Gregory Hines HAD'NT backed out of this role......
B00005QXDD|5.0|They are, of course, known as The Greatest Band In The World. Kyle Gass in insane on the acoustic and Jack Black has an amazing voice. If you overlooked this cd because it has two large unshaven men being fathered by satan on the cover- you need to rethink that one. Yes, some songs are quite vulgar but who gives a shiznit*. It's hilarious, brilliant at its best moments. Buy this CD.
B00005YW4H|3.0|I finally bought Norah's CD, very much excited after hearing her hit single and expecting more of the same.  Her vocals come across very lethargic and where is the passion in these performances. I guess I don't get it.  They say less is more, but this is ridiculous.  These interpretations are too laid back for my taste.  Perhaps she comes across better in live performances.  A better bet would be Holly Cole's CD, \\"Temptation\\". I believe Norah owes a significant nod to this artist, a singer who'll never reach Norah's level of commercial and popular success, but an artist who achieves what Norah is trying to create much more interestingly, movingly, and successfully.  Peace.
B0000640S1|4.0|Before it became one of the most cliche'-ridden action franchises in history, the saga of John Rambo was actually a very compelling and moving one.  Much like actor Sylvester Stallone's other famed movie franchise 'Rocky', this series debuted with a story that was built upon elements of the human condition and focused on the interactions of the main characters.  Where as the sequels in both series resorted to pandering story lines and overblown plot devices, the originals were well crafted.  <BR><BR>The first episode in the Rambo saga, 'First Blood' (it was not called 'Rambo', despite what many moviegoers think.) tells the tragic tale of a Vietnam veteran's inability to return to a normal life in his own mind and the inability of many people to let him because of their own feelings about that misbegotten war.  John Rambo (Stallone) was a highly trained Army killing who machined who commanded well-trained men and operated high-priced military machinery.  He was Congressional Medal of Honor winner for whom there was no honor to be found when he returned home. All Rambo wanted to do was find an old Army buddy and grab a bite to eat in a small town as he made through and onto to wherever his next destination would be.  Unfortunately, the prejudices and hatreds of a small-town sheriff's department and its vile, redneck sheriff, Will Teasle (played with slimy intensity by Brian Dennehy) just can't leave Rambo in peace.  Teasle harasses and taunts Rambo before arresting him on a nebulous charge of 'vagrancy'.  While in lockdown, the mistreatment his receives at the hand of other members of the sheriff's department triggers horrifying memories of his time in a P.O.W. camp and he snaps.  Rambo attacks the abusive officers and then escapes to the mountains overlooking this sleepy town.  Not content to let well-enough alone, Teasle and his men follow him into the mountains where Rambo's Green Beret training makes the odds of 8 to 1 (and later 200 to 1) turn in favor of the 1.Teasle was warned: 'Don't push it or I'll give you a war you won't believe.' <BR><BR>'First Blood' deconstructs the world as Rambo has come to know it.  It's an unforgiving one for Vietnam veterans and the mercilessness of some people's perceptions of the men who fought that war made the United States as inhospitable a place for them as the thickest jungles in 'Nam.  Rambo wants to forget and move on, but most of all, he just wants to be left alone.  His battle with the sheriff and his deputies isn't about attrition or killing, it's about survival.  He doesn't kill the men after him; he just incapacitates them.  Rambo is the quintessential anti-hero whose plight we can empathize with, if not sympathize.  You understand the world he is facing and what made him flip the way he did.  While certainly not as well known or publicized as its glitzier sequels, 'First Blood' is an underrated gem worth investing 90 minutes in.
B000089RVX|3.0|Evanescence with their CD &quot;Fallen&quot; has crashed onto the charts already going Double Platinum.<br />Their first single &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; hit Billboards Singles Top 10, and their next single &quot;Going Under&quot; is sure to follow.<br />The lead singers voice is magnificent with such energy, sound, and passion.  Not heard in many singers nowadays.<br />Only problem I do have with this CD is that it begins to muddle all together.  Our lady of voice needs to have a little more range and not sound continuously the same in all the songs.  The album is strong, the songs are really good, she just needs to change her personality in voice from time to time.<br />A good album.  A good recommendation for the rocker enthusiast.
0060523794|4.0|The subtitle of this book is \\"Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround.\\"  A more appropriate subtitle might have been, \\"Inside Lou Gerstner's Mind.\\"  If you are looking for the intrigue and drama of IBM's near death and resurrection, this book is not it.<br />It is a pretty good read, though.  The first three parts are very interesting.  They detail what Gerstner found at IBM and what he saw as the good worth keeping and the bad that needed tossing.  Perhaps the funniest part of the book is on page 197 of the hardback that includes a glossary of IBM terms.  In fact, there are many points of the book where one can imagine Gerstner with a perplexed look thinking, \\"Now, what in the #%&* did he just say?\\"<br />The fourth part of the book really drags and doesn't offer any real vision of the future.  Gerstner's talent is execution, not vision unlike, say, Bill Gates.  <br />I read \\"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr., and the Making of IBM\\" before reading this book.  I could see how some of the culture that Mr. Watson created in founding IBM had become more important that the business when Mr. Gerstner arrived.  I recommend the books as a one-two punch.<br />Overall, this is a good book, not too self-congratulatory nor too technical and analytical.
B000060MMI|5.0|i hear od floggin molly from a friend, and was skeptic to anything new.  i fell inlove the first time through the cd.  i can even say that i have a favorite because they all rock.  the sound is so unusual to what u would hear in punk, but it fits so perfectly in that catagory.  u'll love it, garentee, and u can come kick my arse if u dont like it
B00005OM4N|2.0|Well she tried.<BR> <BR> In my opinion, Britney Spears' album clearly isn't really what I expected. It seemed like she didn't work too hard and changed too much. It's really different from the 1st and 2nd albums she made; she really changed her music. I don't really mean that in a good way. I agree with past reviewers, that her voice sounds like a squirrel, her music (if that's what she calls it) is gotten too poppy and everything. Although I like \\"Overprotected\\" \\"I Love Rock &amp; Roll\\" and \\"I'm a girl, Not Yet a Woman,\\" 3 songs isn't enough to keep me hooked onto an album and say it was worth the money. It wasn't even worth half the money. Pop isn't really the \\"greatest music around\\" nowadays. It's bubblegum pop: it lost it flavor after awhile and got old, and doesn't capture anyone's interest. <br />Just for you to know:<BR>I've been hearing people talking about her image more than her music nowadays. They don't like her. She's disgusting. She's such a teenybopper. Blah, blah. Whatever. Remember: she's a musician, not a model.<br />I do hope and I'm sure Britney will improve. I just think she's having a hard time with life right now.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Like many I picked this up along with the new 3 cd set \\"How The West Was Won\\".  The sets contain different material.  The first disk contains a 1970 concert from Royal Albert Hall.  The footage is pretty good considering how old it is.  However, at times it seems that the footage may not match the actual song.  My guess is that some of the footage had deteriorated beyond repair.  Occasionally still shots will appear instead of live footage probably for the same reasons.  Some of this material has been available in bootleg form.  The performance is good and contains many of the early favorites.  Especially impressive is Page's version of \\"White Summer\\".  I was also glad a version of \\"Bring It On Home\\" was included.  \\"Dazed And Confused\\" proves to be more interesting on the DVD than on the new 3 disk set as you can actually see all of the tricks Page is using to get the sounds out of his guitar.  It still goes on perhaps a bit too long.  \\"Moby Dick\\" is also a revelation because the viewer can actully see what a monster John Bonham actually was on the drums.  The version of \\"How The West Was Won\\" becomes tiresome after about 5 minutes but proves to be more valuable here as you can actully see what Bonham is doing.\\" I found the second disk more interesting personally because it included later period songs not included on the \\"How The West Was Won\\", \\"BBC Sessions\\" or \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" disks.  The 1973 outtakes from the \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" are absorbing.  Especially impressive is the emotional version of the slow blues \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\". The acoustic material from the Earls Court concert in 1975 comes off rather well.  I also enjoyed the live versions of \\"Trampled Underfoot\\" and \\"In My Time Of Dying\\" two of my favorites.  \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" is well played. The Knebworth material from 1979 includes live versions of favorites like \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\", \\"In The Evening\\" and \\"Kashmir\\".  The funky version of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" contrasts greatly with the sledgehammer version from Royal Albert Hall on the first disk.  One criticism I have is that the camera tends to focus on Jimmy Page and Robert Plant more than John Bonham and John Paul Jones.  Jones in particular is almost nonexistant.  Guitar fans will no doubt delight in the footage of Page.  Many of his guitar techniques are easily seen.  The extra material and interviews tend to be both amusing not only for the fashions but also the press conferences.<br />In summary this is a great 5 hour DVD tribute to a legendary band!  Perhaps they will eventually release some of the later period live material on compact disk in the future.  We can only hope!

B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park overall is just a great band.  The way they construct their songs from rapping, harmonizing, producing, etc.  They are geniuses for this pop generation.<br />Linkin Park sounds like a cross between Depeche Mode, POD, and the MTV Rappers all rolled into one.<br />My only grievances with &quot;Meteora&quot; are that some of the songs run under 3 minutes, quite short in most song standards of 4 minutes plus, and the lead singer - though the screaming is part of their persona - he has such a beautiful voice as in &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; that I would like to hear more of it.  However the screaming is perfect in &quot;Faint&quot;.<br />Each song is wonderfully constructed with its own personality.  My favorites include &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;, &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; and most of all &quot;Faint&quot;.  &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; is very Depeche Mode in nature but with Linkin Parks label all over it.<br />The rapper whose name escapes me at the moment, is the best rapper out there on the music front today.  The way he positions his lyrics, rhythm and sound is just perfection.  If all rappers could just learn from him.  Honestly Linkin Park has to be one of the best bands of the new millenium.<br />Remember that one hit wonder &quot;Butterfly&quot; by Crazy Town....who made that song what it was....Mr. Linkin Park Rapper himself.<br />An album that should be on the roster at the Grammies 2004 for Album of the Year.
B000060OFT|4.0|After watching this movie again (after a couple years hiatus) I felt it truly deserved a review.  This movie is *not* for everyone, and perhaps even some die-hard shakespearean aficionados might not like it, but truly it is a visual feast, as well as an interesting twist on an old tale.  Some inspired casting adds to the appeal of the film, with only a minor amount of mis-direction every-so-often marring an otherwise cool perspective.  Perhaps this movie can/would be categorized as a borderline cult classic - either way, it is something different worth seeing.  Watch the whole film!
B00005JM03|5.0|do they have mini coopers in the us?Ihope so.they are the most awesome cars ever.And putting someone like Mark Wahlberg or Mos Def at the wheel,awesome!This is an awesome movie and if youre a fan of movies period,youll love the italian job.It has great action sequences(most of them have at least one mini cooper in them)great comedy,(I really enjoyed Seth Green throughout)not much romance but theres other movies with that so you wont be bored.I love mini coopers!
B00006IUL7|4.0|Christopher Nolan has surprised audiences with the follow-up to his mega-successful film Memento. While not as layered and intricately plotted as his first film, Insomnia stands on it's own as a wonderfully paced murder mystery. The setting for this film is the main star. Alaska has never looked more foreboding, cold, or alien as it does in this picture and the wonderful cinematography only adds to the tension of the piece. Al Pacino, as always, is wonderful as Det. Dormer, a man with a haunted past of mistakes, guilt ridden decision making, and a terrible infirmity: Insomnia. Robin Williams infuses his manical portrayal of a cold, caluculating killer with righteous aplomb: The demon next door. A few particularly weak plot devices fail to ruin the mystery of the film, and the script crackles with sharp dialogue. Highly recommended for mystery fans.
B00006879E|1.0|This album made me want to fall asleep.  Not in a good, mellow way.  Very boring and uninspired, with the exception of &quot;Harder to Breathe.&quot;  Maybe my lack of music eltism impairs my judgement on this CD, but, seriously, this album is not worth anyone's time.
0790729628|2.0|I have to agree with other reviews regarding the Director's Cut.  I have both versions in VHS, and find the original version far superior.  I expected that, like VHS, both versions would be available on DVD, but that hasn't happened yet.  How do we let the studio know that what we really want is the original version on DVD?  I love this movie, but don't really want to buy the Director's cut on DVD, since I consider it inferior.  Thanks...

B00008NG5V|5.0|I think Jack has sharpened his skills and recording style since &quot;Brushfire Fairytales&quot; and it shows on his second album, &quot;On and On.&quot;  The tracks flow from one to the next on Jack's smooth vocals and the funky guitars and drums.

The whole CD rocks, especially &quot;Gone,&quot; &quot;Cupid,&quot; and &quot;Holes to Heaven.&quot;

B00005R23S|5.0|I'd never seen a Bruce Springsteen concert until I bought this DVD.  I've owned it for six months now and I put it on to watch or listen to every few days, it's brilliant.  The sound and picture quality are FLAWLESS, none of my other concert DVDs even come close.<br />Yes the setlist is out of order but this is the only Bruce concert DVD available and it's a damn fine first release.  Hopefully the Rising tour will be equally well recorded when it is released some time in the future.<br />Buy it!!
B00006F7S4|5.0|After hearing 'Lost Cause' on the radio, I found myself buying Sea Change that very day.  Unlike many albums that have reeled you in by one great track, I was not disappointed with even one song.  If you've heard some of the tracks and haven't purchased it yet, you're denying yourself one of the best emotionally rich, melodic, dreamy albums I've ever had the pleasure of listening to (over and over).  What I find most appealing and sweet about this album is the way it makes you feel.  If it's possible, I felt as if I was as wrapped up in my own memories and emotions while listening to the sadness and beauty that convey what Beck surely felt while writing them.  One of my top ten.
0393057658|5.0|I came across this book to find out the answers to two question.  1) How did Billy Beane put together a good team with such little money? and 2) How is it like to be a General Manager for a major league team?  The book does a good job at trying to answer these questions.  You'll get an interesting perspective of how the author Lewis approached the material because he compares the building of a team to managing a stock portfolio.  Beane took advantage of the traditional beliefs of baseball insiders and turned it on its head.  You'll read his beliefs on how he believes the game should be managed, how a batter should approach his at bats, and how to make trades and draft players.<br />But aside from the methodology, I liked the stories about some of the players in the A's organization as well as the story about the life of Billy Beane before he became the general manager.  Lewis gives a good angle about the players personal lives and makes you like the players because he makes them look like underdogs.  Other scouts and insiders had passed up in drafting players the A's picked up because they didn't fit a certain stereotype.   Beane didn't care if the player was too short or too fat or threw weirdly on the mound.  He just cared about men who can play the game.<br />You'll get funny stories and some dramatic stories.  My only regret was that I wished that there was more to read.  It only takes a few reading sessions to read the book and its easy reading.<br />I confess that as a Giant's fan I have only admired (and despised) them from afar just across the bay but I have a newfound respect for the people in the organization from reading this book.

B000001OAA|5.0|this cd was my intro to garbage, and WOW!  it did require 3 or 4 listening, and then i was hooked.  shirly manson has got to be one of the all time best female singers and lyricists.  she'll really get under your skin with her dark lyrics and gorgeous voice.  it's a great album, very tasteful and complete.
B00005OM4N|4.0|This girl isn't very good with expressing herself very well lyrically. Some of her songs are very good and some are very bad. she needs help leaving the kid department and entering the adult category. it shows she has the potential in this CD. But with songs like \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\", \\"Bombastic Love\\" and \\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\\" ya gotta wonder. The rest of the CD, especially the bonus songs were very beautiful. I didn't think she had it in her (the bonus songs), but I was shocked because she was so good and honest.  .....
0060930187|5.0|This book is amazing.  Buy it, trust me you won't regret it.
B00009V7T2|5.0|First of all I would like to clear up that Cedric is the lead singer, not Omar.  Dont know how anyone could make that mistake.<br />But anyway, I dont see any need for a long wordy review.  All I really need to say is that this is honestly the most amazing album I've ever heard.  Nothing else I've ever heard has come close, other than ATDI.  ....  This band is original and brilliant and it makes for an incredible album. get it.
B000001FI7|5.0|excellent cd from start to finish.  i must have played it over a 1000 times over the years, and it still sounds great.  if you're undecided, i'd say go for it.  you won't be disappointed.  it's a must have.

B0000AMRJC|5.0|I just ordered Scarface over the Internet.  It is bootlegged, but I don't care, as long as I have the movie.  I will buy the aniversery edition this September. I was truly amazed with this film, it was powerful because of Pacino's acting.  This film is similar to Grand Theft Auto Vice City.  It is like a clone of the film, with different characters.  Both mansions are very similar, the cars are similar, the characters, and even the night club.  I recommend this film to any Al Pacino fan, or any fan to great american films.  This movie rivals the Godfather series, and is better than Godfellas.  If you like Pacino you would like the 1973 film Serpico.
B000002H33|5.0|If you want just good to hear, never buy this CD.<BR>it is more than just good to hear.<br />When I put this CD in audio, I feel 'Metallica is the greatest musician'.

B00004T8RK|3.0|There coems a point with all great bands where the music continues to get better (read U2) or it's just more music that only long-time fans really enjoy (Erasure &amp; Depeche Mode), nothing to gain new fans.  Pearl Jam has reached this point.  I'm a fan from the first album but every new album continuies to sound the same with nothing new and exciting.  If you're looking for more of the same exciting sound that made this band a living legend go listen your early albums (or pick some up) but if you're looking for some new entries that are just as good I'd suggest looking for a new band entirely.
6301174240|5.0|When I was little, I was Michael Jackson. I've always like him. When this movie came out I was 2 years old going on 3 and by this time i was talking and singing perfectley. Michael Jackson was on non-stop in my house by this time. By the time Michael Jackson went \\"outta style\\", I stayed blasting Michael's Music. This used to come on VH1 all the time. Since I didn't have cable at the time, I used to go over my neighbor's house and watch it. I never saw the whole thing all the way through. For my 12th birthay, my grandmother (RIP) gave me this for a present. She regreated it, of course because I've watched the movie religiously since then. I still watch it to this day. I recomend this for anybody who likes the KOP (King Of Pop). Who cares what Mike does at home? IT'S THE MUSIC THAT COUNTS. You'll love it. I promise you. HOLLA.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|I absolutely LOVE the soundtrack to this movie, I can't stop listening to the CD. I am not familiar with the music of Klaus Badelt but I know of Hans Zimmer. Together, they deliver a fabulously 'heart pounding' musical score for the different 'action' scenes in the film. <BR>I have to agree the CD is not very long and I don't think the score follows the movie very well, meaning, the music that runs with the 'end credits' in the film does not follow the CD version. I think we were 'short changed' in that department.<BR>Who can you complain to about that? I have seen this movie several times and can tell there is something missing.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly combine in what is one of the most engaging and suspenseful classics of all time.  She is at her finest, playing a role that was designed for her.  In scene after scene she is striking.      Hitchcock never completely reveals her attraction to him and this only service to draw us into the relationship between the two.  As they are attempting to sort out the meaning and direction of their relationship, suspense builds naturally.  It reaches a height when she decides to investigate the missing woman across the way.    Fascinating entertainment that will solidly remain a classic for years to come.
B00008EY9G|4.0|THIS MOVIE WITH AN ALL-STAR CAST IS A GOOD MOVIE.  CUSAK, PEETE, LIOTA, JAKE BUSY AND THAT WEIRD GIRL FROM THE FACULTY.  I SAW THIS MOVIE THE FRIDAY IT CAME OUT AND I WAS THOUROUGHLY IMPRESSED.  IT WAS SUCH AN EDGE OF YOUR SEAT MOVIE.  EACH CHARACTER HAD DISTINCT PERSONALITIES ABOUT THEM AND AT THE END OF THE MOVIE RELATE THEM TO THE UNPREDICTABLE ENDING, YOU WILL FIND IT INTERESTING.  I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ALL WATCHERS.  I TOOK MY WIFE TO IT THE SECOND TIME I SAW IT AND SHE GETS SCARRED AT ANYTHING AND SHE HANDLED IT SO ITS NOT SCARY.  BUY THIS MOVIE IMMEDIATELY WHEN IT COMES OUT IT IS GREAT.
B00008VGK0|4.0|Yes, Madonna is whining a bit too much, and she is no longer the &quot;diva&quot; of the Vogue/Erotica/Girlie Show days, but now that she is older, is married and has kids, it is not a surprise that Madonna is more concerned with making introspective music.  Yes, &quot;American Life&quot; is not as melodic or appealing as previous hits, but it's still an effective and haunting song.  The remixes are quite good too, particularly those by Missy Elliott and Peter Rauhoefer.  It is not as good as previous singles, but I admire Madonna for not trying to make the same songs as ten years ago.  Part of the reason why people like Madonna is because she takes risks.  This is a risk she took, and I enjoyed it.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Released in May 1966,\\"Pet Sounds\\" was the album that saw The Beach Boys graduate from purveyors of perfectly crafted lightweight pop like \\"Sufin USA\\",\\"Fun Fun Fun\\" et al,into a vehicle for the mature compositional genius of Brian Wilson.Though it was not an huge hit,its became hugely influential on pop and rock musicians,most notably The Beatles,whose \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" drew inspiration from this album as Paul McCartney would gladly tell you,and many others old and new(too numerous to mention).For me,it was the first time I truly enjoyed the Beach Boys because it was a work that expressed emotions that I could relate to like finding true love,being insecure,not fitting in,and loss of innocence.It also had the most gorgeous and most haunting melodies,harmonies,sounds,and songs ever commited to tape,like \\"God Only Knows\\",\\"Caroline No\\",\\"I'm Waiting For The Day\\",\\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" and others as well.It made me look past the corny striped-shirt fun-in-the-sun image and made me realize that this band had a much deeper,more substatial body of work than I thought.And it has given me great comfort to my heart,soul,and ears since then.That's probably the reason why this album's rep as \\"The Greatest Album Of The 20th Century\\" still continues to grow and deepen with each passing year!
B00006G8G1|5.0|a staggeringly enjoyable display of metal marvel worthy of the highest praise. Is everything that this genre aspires to...and so much more.<br />We are talking major adrenaline rushes here.<br />WOW!
B00007AJF9|4.0|This movie is fabulous entertainment, but if anacronisms and historical idiosyncracies bug you terribly, I'd skip it. If you're looking for a documentary, go to PBS, if you want a delightful interpretation--look here.
B00006690G|3.0|his older slim chady lp cd was so much better than the eminem show. halie's song shows he's grown soft and i prefer his older music such as 'my name is' and 'as the world turns' and mostly the songs on his other cd. in the new record he still pulls off his incredible rhymes and its not bad but as i said it's not the same as the slim shady lp
B00005JKPF|5.0|Wowies.  This is easily one of my all time favorite films... 10x better then the first one, if possible, and watching it simply makes you itch for the next one.  Hoo.. Of course, one of the big parts of the story was already rather obvious to original X-Men fans (coughJEANcough) but, in some way, knowing slightly what's going to happen but not exactly makes you want the next one even more.  All of the acting, special effects, and storyline were AMAZINGLY well done, and are nothing short of amazing.  Everyone must see this.  Do not argue, go see/buy it NOW.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Truly a defining work of art that deftly interconnects interesting sounds within songs and songs among themselves like intricate webs of synapses in the human brain: a fitting metaphor for a work by musicians who finally owned up to the power of music-generating computers.<br />As computers are extensions of the human nervous system, artists such as Radiohead are not only energizing where we are, but pointing in the direction to where we are headed.<br />This work breaks the seals on so many envelopes. It should encourage all the poseurs in the business to rise to a much higher challenge.
0385334176|4.0|This is the fourth Vonnegut book I have read, and I have to say it's probably one of his best. The story was interesting, and the moral was well received. I also enjoyed the fact that some of his characters from Breakfast of Champions made appearances in the book.
B00009RGBS|5.0|To compare Chicago to Moulin Rouge is ridiculous both films are exceptional in their own rights. Chicago's direction is superb and the continuity is impressive. The editing is sharp and never misses a beat. The acting is convincing and never gets flat; the ensemble cast worked well together and electrified the screen. Being a fan of both Moulin Rouge and Chicago I can safely say that both of these features are amazing and yet very different which is how it should be, no two films although in the same genre should be alike because if they are then everything will seem routine and old and the audience will ultimately get bored.

044100590X|5.0|To put it shortly this is one of those books that anyone who is seriously into Sci-Fi needs to read. The way Frank Herbert uses and mixes in religion, science and politics is just something one must behold and witness on your own. Frank Herbert creates not just a world to travel in but also a universe to wonder about and contemplate on as well. His characters are all solid and very realistic to read in their thoughts, emotions, and motives. All are so well intertwined into this story that it baffles the mind how one man can come up with such a masterpiece of Sci-Fi lore.
B00005RJ1U|4.0|This is actually a well plotted above average teen horror flick from director Victor Salva(most recently seen in the drama film Powder)<br />The first 20 minutes or so of this movie are truly tense and quite scary as we find a young brother &amp; sister travelling home for spring break in an old car. As they drive along in a more than deserted part of the countryside, they witness a macabre looking stranger doing something they can't quite believe after a near miss on the highway, and quickly begin to fear for their own safety. Without divulging too much of the storyline, the picture gathers pace from this point and more than cleverly keeps up the tension without falling into the usual gratuitous gore or fantastical scenes. Fans of this type of movie will certainly find plenty to enjoy, although the power of the movie is placed much more firmly in the psychological aspect, than the more common &quot;in your face&quot; horror, in fact there are even one or two references to the horror movie genre by the stars themselves, woven nicely into the script. The two main characters are played with huge credibility by the relative newcomers Gina Phillips and Justin Long, who are probably remembered for their recent outings in films like of Telling You &amp;  the very different Galaxy Quest respectively. Their portrayal of two very scared youngsters comes across well, and puts the viewer, easily into their situations. My only complaint about the movie would be the directors insistence on incorporating a fantastic element eventually into the direction, in an attempt to follow a supernatural theme. This works OK, but one has to say or more believable or credible explanation of the events we are seeing, would have been even better.<br />The movie has something of a low budget feel, but this is not in any way detrimental to the story, and almost adds something to the feeling of isolation in the locations depicted. All this said, this is a very well made movie with more than a few suprises along the way, and an ending that is certainly not &quot;out of the box&quot;. There are several short scenes of gory violence, but not too much to warrant an R rating otherwise. Enjoy.ises along the way, and an ending that is certainly not &quot;out of the box&quot;.

B00005MKA1|5.0|now that does sounds like a pretty risky statement, but in my opinion this is the best album. i have all of bob's cd's, but i have to say that no matter what i always come back to this one. With tracks like \\"is this love\\", \\"satisfy my soul\\" and the spectacular \\"Misty Morning\\" you just cant go wrong. but dont by any means think those are the only good songs on this album, because everyone is just perfect. this is an album where there is no skipping tracks needed. the whole cd plays like one giant beautiful opus. if you are just getting into marley i would reccomend \\"Legend\\" first, but this would suck you into his beautiful little world also. for those of you with just Legend and you want to expand more into the Rasta mans' music, this would be a perfect selection.<br />what are you waiting for??? go out and by this NOW!!
B000067CPX|5.0|&quot;By The Way&quot; is a joy to listen to.  The Peppers have put more great songs together on one CD than most bands could hope for over 8 CDs.  This might be a letdown for those who care only for the funkified Peppers, but if you are wanting to listen to just plain great music, you will not be disappointed.<br />From the opening title track to the closing spectacular &quot;Venice Queen,&quot; the listener is taken on a musical journey at his highest form.  Standouts are &quot;The Zephyr Song,&quot; &quot;Tear,&quot; and &quot;Universally Speaking.&quot;  Kiedes's voice has never been in better form.  The band sounds great.  This is the best album to come out since the Beatles White Album... and that was 35 years ago.  I cannot recommend this CD enough.  It's outstanding. Period.
B00008LDPU|5.0|This DVD is awesome! It's better than the Matrix Reloaded Movie! It covers all you need to know to understand the Matrix inside. Don't buy the movie, buy the Animatrix DVD.

B00008EY9G|2.0|Bad writing, choppy action, and horrible twists brings \\"Identity\\" down to levels of other awful psychological thrillers such as \\"Abandon\\" or even worse, \\"American Psycho\\". The film starts off with introducting the uniteresting ensemble characters one bye one such as John Cusack, Amanda Peet, and Ray Liotta who all give the worst performances of their carrer in this film. No real storry, and no real climax in this film it's just a redundant mix of gore and a suprise ending that doesnt seem to make much sence. The main theme of the film is skitzophrenia which hasn't been used well since 1999's \\"Fight Club\\" perhaps the best film of the generation. \\"Identity\\" will be a film without one in film history.
0064407667|1.0|This series was recommended as a suitable way to stave off boredum while waiting for Book 5 of Harry Potter to come out.  Terrible recommendation.  It is condescending to both adults and children - defining words in the text (although often just with more difficult words than the original.)<br />Plus, it's just depressing - admittedly, they warn you with the title - but it was depressing to me not because of what happens, but because the children are protrayed as being stupid in many ways.  Kids aren't dumb.  You don't, for example, not tell an adult that you trust that someone has kidnapped your little sister - it's a terrible example to set for your kids.<br />Anyway, don't bother it isn't Harry Potter (although at least they aren't 1000 pages long...)

B000092ZYX|4.0|I said this in 2000 when \\"Kid A\\" came out, I said it when \\"Amnesiac\\" came out, and I'm gonna say it now: Radiohead won't make another \\"OK Computer\\", they've moved past Brit-Rock.  Why can't some of you realize that!!!!!  Every time I read a review of a post-\\"OK Computer\\" album, someone has to compare that album to \\"OK Computer\\" and I guess you haven't realized that Radiohead has moved on into different musical fields.  Anyway, the album is good, just not great.  You've got your fair share of great tracks, but some of them aren't that great.  There isn't any filler (except maybe \\"Backdrifts\\") on the album, which there hasn't been on any Radiohead album, and Thom's lyrics are as good and as thought provoking as usual.  Anyway, the music is awesome.  The standout tracks are \\"2+2=5\\", \\"Sit Down, Stand Up\\", \\"Where I End You Begin\\", \\"Go To Sleep\\", \\"We Suck Young Blood\\", \\"There There\\", and \\"A Wolf At The Door\\".  Also, I like how they released their longest song as the single, something usually frowned upon by the empty-V world.

B00000255F|5.0|Simply, this has to be one of the best rock albums ever done. Classics such as &quot;Thunder Road&quot;, &quot;Born to Run&quot;, and &quot;Jungleland&quot; have me listening to this CD over and over again. I have always been a huge Springsteen fan, but this is the CD that seems to epitomize his talents and career.
B00005JM09|2.0|When I heard that James Cameron is not the guy behind the camera that direct the third sequel of the Terminator, I've already felt a heavy doubt to watch the third sequel.  This doubt was then uplifted when I found that Jonathan Mostow is going to be the person in charge for the challenging position of directing a third sequel of the Terminator series.  Mostow is an excellent director when it comes to action movies, considering his excellent work in Breakdown and U-571.  As such I choose to take a chance and see it...<br />As it turns out..it's a great disappointment.  This is not a Terminator movie...some viewers considered it ok as a b-flick pop-corn movie.  Well, it's difficult for me because what I want to see is a Terminator movie...not just some b-flick pop-corn movie.<br />Mostow is a great director when it comes to action sequence.  But the Terminator is not just about great action sequence...it's about good thrilling story that grip the audience, it's about a nightmarish vision when something indestructible wanted to destroy you, it's about amazing effect.  From a directing point of view, Mostow lack the ability to create the charisma of the Terminator robot.  I remember that in Cameron's previous sequels, we are gripped every time the Terminator robot, or even the futuristic skynet robot, comes in view.  Scary aura somehow follows it and we just have this feeling like saying \\"Oh my God\\".  Try to compare the scene where the Terminators appears between Mostow's Terminator with Cameron's.   <br />One good example, the scene of the future Skynet robots.  In part 2, there is this opening scene, where a man's skull, after a moment of close up in a very quiet situation (just the sound of the wind), was suddenly crushed by a feet of a skynet robot...all done in a close up.  Then the camera slowly goes up and catch the view of the face of the robot.  I don't know, but it really haunting.  Mostow tries to create the same mood, where a bunch of skull scattered on a base of a river, was then follow with shot of the skynet robots blasting their ray guns everywhere, and then camera stand still on one of the robot who stares back at the camera.  Not bad, but...well, comparatively speaking, it becomes nothing compare to the previous scene I've mentioned. And then there is this cold terminator character...Mostow didn't do a good enough job in maintaining the coldness of the Terminator robot.  There are some moments...well, many moments, especially from Arnold's side, where the Terminator gave a `much too alive' impression (Arnold's eye bulging bigger when he said `Judgement day is inevitable' to John Connor...talking about trying to make an impression).  <br />Sadly, the only thing that Mostow done perfectly here, is the first chasing sequence, which remind me a lot of Breakdown.  Actually, for me, it's the only exciting action sequence in the movie.  Even the fighting scene between the two terminator was very lacked...there are more that can be done just making two robot throwing each other and destroying walls, or lavatory walls for this matter (which actually, is a sad attempt in elevating the scene in part two where Arnold and Robert Patrick wrestle each other and then destroying every wall that collided with their body)<br />As for the script...it's cheesy, full of stupid remarks, although I agree with the conclusion (I'm not going to spoil it).  Too many attempts to make a memorable remarks by Arnold, like \\"John Connor....it's time\\" . <br />The special effect, it's good enough.  But then...good enough is not a standard for a movie with a caliber of Terminator. Oh well, so much for a Terminator sequence.
0140177396|5.0|Writing about such a well-known novel, some readers might think that there is nothing new to add about it, the case being somehow closed forever, both by the march of time and the successive interpretations the work as received; a close reading proves otherwise. Steinbeck offers a simple narrative that appears to answer many questions, but the real answers probably hide between the lines - explicit explanations are few and far between. The characters and events are soberly presented, and this only serves to further obfuscate the multiple layers of a book which, through its suggestive terseness, borders on myth. In fact, myth itself is built into the work under the guise of a dream that George conveys to Lennie, and then to the old Candy; a dream that gradually loses its significance for the very man who devised it. `Of Mice and Men' is that dream: hope alternates with sadness, and it's not entirely clear if there will be a resolution, after all.
B00009ATIX|5.0|I haven't seen Tartovsky's version...but i'm definitely gonna see it...have to compare it with this one, because this one is trully a masterpiece.  Like most of the viewers already mentioned, this is not one of those hollywood 'easy watching', 'fast pacing' kind of science fiction movie.  It's very 'European' kind in a sense that it really subtle, moderately slow in tempo.  You need to be very attentive.  If you are in one of those mood where you feel like sleepin, avoid this movie.  But if your are in a fresh state where you feel like watching something that has something more underneath it, well here it is.<br />The whole mood of the film is very haunting, sad and beautifull.  Beautifull soft colored photography dominate the whole film...it's a very photographic film.  And the colour...i did mention soft colour.  We see many pastel blue abort the ship, soft yellow glow from a room light and a mixture of light soft blue and red for the colour of the surface of Solaris.  It was heigtened with the soundtrack that gives an eerie empty and sad feeling, yet sometimes elevating.  This whole combination, the music, the photography, the colours, create a total solemn, romantic and haunting situation.  There are no blasting situation in the movie...just, thougthfull peacefull situation and feeling.<br />Soderbergh way of story telling is good if not considered to be complicated...the story move back and forth between flash back and the present situation, whereby the character tries to remember what had happened (especially the character Rhea from the solaris who fought hard to remember who she is, or what she is.  The camera keep moving back and forth between her close up expression or eyes and the event that had happened on Earth).<br />A very serious movie indeed.  It did not try to be a sci-fi with argumentative prediction on the future...it's more of story where a person is given a chance to heal what he has done, although he may not do it with his real wife.  Just a simple matter of a peacefull feeling, a way to terminate guilty feeling.  This somehow remind me of Vertigo, who have a very close theme, where James Stewart is in love with a woman who bore a strong physical resemblance of her previous loved ones.  Alhtough he realize she is a different woman, he doesn't care, he even asked her to wear the same dress.  True love or just a mere psychotic obsession ?  At the end, is a matter of making a choice to make peace to yourself, hallucinating or not.  So is Solaris...a deep thought full film.  Not as thoughtfull as the original novel from Stanislaw Lem i admit...but still, thoughtfull.<br />Watch it...and it stay's in your mind.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I remember the video we had being so old, with the original box(the plastic one) and soundtrack, that my mom decided to throw it out. I dont know, she loves pissing me off but ehhh.<br />When I hear this was coming out on dvd I immediately asked my grampa for it for christmas. Bam, popped this baby in and wow. The movie has an excellent picture for such an older film. The sound quality is done in 5.1 dolby so it is excellent. I was surprised that they did such a great job with everything. The extras are alright. Documentaries, they are good though. \\"The movie mdizzio, hows the movie?\\" I will answer your question, now...<br />Perfectly done. I cannot stress how great of a job they did with this movie. The characters are all excellent. I love how they made val kilmer mad mardigan(spelling?). He does a great job portraying a hero like mercenary, gives some good comedy, and doesn't [make you mad] by trying to be the biggest saint around. I like him alot more than Willow. Willow Off-Good is awesome though. Hes a little person, and he isn't the only one. There is a whole big village of little people, they did a wonderful job with the casting and costuming of them.<br />The plot is pretty good too. There is a baby, the baby will bring down bavmorda, she is like the evil queen of the unholy castle of such and such. She pretty much runs the show over there, and one of her seers has foretold a baby will bring the downfall of her kingdom. That baby gets away with a lady, and washes down stream by a village. Willow's family takes the girl in, and she is so adorable, cute, and crazy man. Anyways, shes only like a few months old or something. So then after an incident, the baby must leave. Willow and friends find Mad Mardigan and eventually, all of Willows companions leave. Mad Mardigan takes the baby in order for his freedom, and Willow soon finds out that he is the true guardian of the baby. So I don't wanna ruin it, but Willow must bring the baby to a good king and queen as the mystical lady says. That good king and queen will look after her, and raise her.<br />The action and such is done perfectly. The music score combined with the action and such is better. The music isn't sad at all, its more of an adventure sort of thing throughout. Instead of making it a cry/fight film, its a mystical action adventure film. Considering the music is always on the adventure tone, theres plenty of fighting. Only a bit of blood, like when the main characters bleed or theres blood on their swords. However don't let that scare you off, theres sweet action. Actually, theres not alot of sword fighting directly. It's not a main focus point, but they do it, and its in their. Sometimes however, theres a sword fight that they pan in on like with Kale, the bad general, or Mad Mardigan. Lots of horses.<br />I loved the movie though, I can't say anything else. You buy it, you watch it, and you go, \\"That was a good movie mdizzio, you were right dog.\\" This movies somewhere on my top 5 favorite movies of all time, a select few can make it on their, namely 5.

0385509456|5.0|Like many other readers, I thought the genius and originality of this book was in the narrator's voice. Christopher is an autistic, mathmatical genius who one day discovers his neighbors dog killed.His search to discover who the killer is leads him to some unexpected discoveries about his Mother's death years before.Told in almost a stream of consciousness devoid of emotion and feeling the book still manages to be both very funny and moving at the same time. Christopher's detached observations really convey what it must be like to have a constant swarm of thoughts and ideas bouncing through your head.<br />It's a literary device that makes for a distinct and memorable character, and book.
0446677450|1.0|Okay, I'll admit it.  I want to be financially successful.  I'll admit another thing: given the choice between becoming wealthy quickly versus slowly, I'll take quickly.  I also would like to be in top physical condition; however, just like becoming financially wealthy, achieving that goal takes knowledge, planning, discipline, dedication, and time.  I read &quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad&quot; twice, looking for solid ideas that I could apply towards my financial goals.  I found none.  Kiyosaki advocates ideas that range from the patently obvious to the foolishly high-risk to the illegal.  I was disappointed to learn that Kiyosaki later admitted that the &quot;Rich Dad&quot; character is a fictional character.  I was even more disappointed to learn that Kiyosaki also made up most, if not all, of his financial success stories, with the noted exception of his selling his books, seminars and related products.  I have spoken with a number of people who have read Kiyosaki's books, and not one of them has improved their financial condition based on Kiyosaki's ideas.  Thankfully, I don't think anyone I know actually tried to imitate the strategies in this book.  Do some checking on this -- no need to take my word on it.  You will find many sad true accounts of people getting burned monetarily from trying to do what this and Kiyosaki's other books suggest.<br />Question for all the 5-star reviewers bashing the 1 and 2-star reviewers: have any of you actually followed the ideas in this book and, if so, have you had any real, quantifiable success in doing so?
038572179X|3.0|There are certain things one can simply expect from any Ian McEwan novel.  Stylish, succulent prose; intensely familiar yet all-the-more anguishing insights on human nature; and perhaps above all else, the uncanny and remarkable ability to completely absorb a character's persona and worldview and transfer that seamlessly into the absorbing third-person narration.  And it is precisely because of McEwan's remarkable gifts that novels such as Atonement are all the more disappointing when they fail to realize their own potential.  The plot begins vividly, almost painfully, with every action and thought a recognizable and believable extension of each character's personality.  Yet before the first part is concluded, McEwan seems content to simply do away with all the rich, complex layers of his characters and assign them bleak, washed-out stereotypes that cause their actions and, accordingly, the book's plot, to stumble to an uninspired and disappointing conclusion.  Though McEwan's writing style has definite faults (most notably an almost neo-Dickensian proclivity for long, shambling descriptions that obscure and, at times, get ahead of or even forget altogether the plot or action at hand), it makes the first third or so of Atonement quite fulfilling, and even the second part detailing an account of the British retreat to Dunkirk is more than tolerable thanks largely in part to McEwan's ability to keenly get in touch with the essence of his characters (an ability which, as previously mentioned, unfortunately fails to manifest itself in terms of plot action and continuance).  Ultimately, perhaps the criticism of a literary magazine to the literary aspirations of McEwan's would-be author Briony best describe McEwan's own talents - excellent prose and style, with the perhaps-too-strong influence of Virginia Woolf readily noticeable, but poor grasp of what a novel truly is: a simple story.  Though McEwan starts strongly, the vibrant essence of his story quickly fades off into a shallow, predictable paint-by-numbers plot of rehashed action and reaction.
6304981635|5.0|When ENTER THE DRAGON was first released in 1973, viewers tended to see it mostly as a flashy breakthrough vehicle for martial arts star Bruce Lee.  It was certainly that, but thirty years later one can also see that it was a genre defining film in much the same way that Marlon Brando was to motorcycle movies in THE WILD ONE.  Before Lee starred in ENTER THE DRAGON, the martial arts film studios was mostly run by the Shaw brothers from Hong Kong.  Even Bruce Lee in his earlier THE CHINESE CONNECTION and FISTS OF FURY was limited to the then prevailing \\"rock 'em sock 'em\\" kind of filmmaking.  ENTER THE DRAGON, directed by Robert Clouse, changed all that.<br />The primary difference between this film and its predecessors was Lee's insistance that the bulk of the fight scenes avoid the bloody disembowelments and castrations that were then a staple of the genre.  Instead, Lee wisely used his screen persona, his sexuality, and his ultra-fast reflexes to force the viewer to see violence in a context more closely related to traditional Shaolin Kung Fu techniques.  The plot, of course, was simply a vehicle upon which to hang Lee's consummate blend of philosophy with rapid-fire punch and kick routines.  Lee is a free-lance government agent sent to an off-shore Hong Kong island run by the evil Han (Shih Kien), who runs a heroin plant under the guise of a martial arts tournament.  The plot focus is on whether Lee can break this heroin ring before Han's numerous minions overpower Lee.  The interest, however, is set squarely on Lee's fighting ability.  Sharing the spotlight is a set of notable secondary characters.  John Saxon is Roper, a karate gambler who agrees to help only because he might get his gambling debts reduced.  Jim Kelly is Williams, one of the first super-cool 'blaxploitation' action stars who can drop a verbal putdown as quickly as a roundhouse kick.  Then there is Yang Tse as Bolo, a muscular Chinese bad guy who personifies the evil henchman.<br />Even today, the martial arts scenes stand out as extraordinary, mostly because of the skills of Lee matched against either a single highly trained fighter or a legion of lackeys who serve only as Lee's human punching bags.  At the movie's start, Lee is matched against a rather roly-poly fighter (Sammo Hung), who decades later shot to stardom in a television martial arts cop show.  Lee handles Sammo effortlessly.  Of more interest is his later tournament match with real-life karateka Bob Wall, who plays Oharra, one of Han's bodyguards.  During the filming, Wall and Lee developed an intense mutual dislike, fueled primaily over an hand injury Lee suffered when Wall mishandled a broken bottle.  Lee was quite sure this was no accident, and the intensity that he shows when he dispatches Wall is quite real.  Further, when Lee applies the coupe de grace to Wall, the look on Lee's face shows an almost sexual climax intensity that emphasizes the new direction that he was taking martial arts films.  Then there is the mirror-room conclusion battle with Han.  The multi-images of both Lee and Han are incredibly riveting as the viewer cannot distinguish the man from the image.<br />What marks ENTER THE DRAGON as the genre-defining film that it was is that it combines all the right big scenes of group and individual combat with memorable quips of philosophy.  When Lee corners Han in the hall of mirrors and warns him: \\"You have insulted your family and the Shaolin temple,\\" Lee sends a note to Han and to future generations of martial arts directors that the violence of evil deeds must be clearly articulated by the hero for an audience to connect on a visceral level.  ENTER THE DRAGON does this better than any other martial arts movie.
B000059HAI|5.0|Sunday morning, December 7, 1941 was a very fateful day for the USA.  Without warning, the then militaristic Empire of Japan launched a highly successful sneak attack upon America's Pacific naval fleet based at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.  21 naval vessels were sunk or severely damaged and nearly 200 aircraft (mostly on the ground) were destroyed.  Of the approximate 2,350 servicemen (naval, marine &amp; army) and 49 civilians killed (a total of 2,409), 1,177 died on the USS Arizona alone.  Another 1,178 servicemen &amp; civilians were wounded. The next day, war was declared by the U.S. on Japan following a moving speech by President Franklin Deleno Roosevelt.<br />29 years following the attack (1970), directors Richard Fleischer, Kinji Fukasaku, Toshio Masuda and Akira Kurosawa (who left the film before its completion) created a gripping dramatization of the events leading to and portraying the attack on Pearl Harbor in the film entitled &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;.  The film does a superb job of trying to portray actual historic events by splitting its time almost evenly between both the US and Japanese sides.  On the US side, are Adm. Husband E. Kimmel (Martin Balsam), Adm. 'Bull' Halsey (James Whitmore), Gen. Short (Jason Robards), Lt. Comdr. Kramer (Wesley Addy), Secretary of War Henry Stimson (Joseph Cotten) and Secretary of State Cordell Hull (George Macready) to name a few.  On the Japanese side are Admiral Yamamoto (Sô Yamamura), Cmdr. Genda (Tatsuya Mihashi), Lt. Cmdr. Fuchida (Takahiro Tamura), Adm. Nagumo (Eijirô Tono), Gen. Hideki Tojo (Asao Uchida), Ambassador Nomura (Shogo Shimada) and Ambassador Saburo Kurusu (Hisao Toake) to name a few.  One aspect of the film that helps to maintain its staunch realism is that scenes with only Japanese actors use Japanese dialog with English subtitles rather than dubbing the English or having the Japanese actors speak in English with Japanese accents.  Another strength of the film is that is does not focus on one or two specific characters; instead, it allows viewers to see what happens with many characters.<br />Memorable scenes in the film include Ambassabor Kurusu signing the Tripartite Pact in 1940, internal politics within the Japanese government &amp; military, poor decisions made by the U.S. forces at Pearl Harbor, geisha girls waving at practicing Japanese pilots, scenes involving Ambassador Nomura with Secretary Hull, the Japanese crews preparing for the attack and the attack itself.  Admiral Kimmel was in charge of the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, General Short was in charge of the army forces.  Admiral Yamamoto was in charge of planning the attack, but the Japanese attack fleet was under the command of Admiral Nagumo.  The pilot in charge of the attack itself was Lt. Cmdr. Fuchida.<br />Since &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; was filmed in 1970, the special effects (which used a lot of models) may seem dated to people who prefer advanced computer graphics, but don't let lack of special effects technology deter you from enjoying this very gripping film.  The acting in the film is very good, keeping the viewers engaged while watching the events leading up to the attack, as well as the attack itself.  The attack itself is portrayed very well, as are the various mistakes made by U.S. forces in Pearl Harbor prior to the attack.  Overall, I rate &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.<br />In comparison with the 2001 film &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; is the superior of the two for being far more historically accurate and focusing on actual historic events.  In spite of using great special effects for the attack on Pearl Harbor itself, the 2001 film &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; was extremely disappointing for essentially being a soap opera focused primarily upon a purely fictitious &amp; melodramatic love triangle.
0385504209|5.0|A perfect gem.  The only people who will respond negatively to this book are narrow-minded religious types who are terrified to discover that everything they believe in is a hideous attempt to cover up truth and beauty and light.  Dan Brown is a genius to take knowledge that has belonged to the inner circle of academics/art historians/religious scholars and brought it to the wider populace through a popular genre-- the mystery thriller.  He deserves major kudos.  Bring on the Age of Aquarius!!  Age of Enlightenment!!
0553573403|3.0|The first time I read this was after I read the Lord of the Rings. (Yes, I've just gotten into Tolkien.) I love LotR so much that I wanted another story to be just like it. This was not. So I put the book away for a while until I realized that there can only be one Tolkien. So, I read a few more fantasy books, enjoyed them (Thomas Covenant Series was excellent) and then came back to Game of Thrones. Again, I just couldn't get into the story. I just didn't care what happened. The author didn't make me care about what happens. He is a good writer and he will appeal to many readers, just not this one.
B0000931QA|5.0|My first time with Queensryche was with the wonderful Greatest Hits cd. I started working my way to the seperate albums, buying them as I could find them. Out of them all, nothing can compare to Operation: Mindcrime, a concept album about a man who finds himself manipulated by the wrong hand of right. Its a tragic tale about corruption, murder and insanity, drugdealing and lies, and in the end, there is no hope, only the pain of the memories and the scars of the nightmares.<br />Operation Mindcrime can ALSO be enjoyed as a album with seperate songs, you dont need to connect the story or understanding whats happening between the lines, because the melodies and the texts are so incredible strong, both alone and together. This was a moment of Glory for Queensryche, top of the inspiration, full of ideas and a desire to make their voice heard. Unlike Empire, which was a more straigth rock album(Yet with good, deep texts about Life), Operation Mindcrime can be as complicated or simple as you want, but it is certainly more impressive when heard as a whole story. <br />If I must break it to pieces, I`d say that the best songs individually is: Anarchy-X, Revolution Calling, Operation Mindcrime, Spreading the Disease, Suite Sister Mary, Electric Requiem, I dont believe in Love and Eyes of a Stranger. Wow. Thats about all of the songs. They can all be enojyed as stand alone songs, but they mean much more in the whole picture. <br />The band is in top shape, they have full control over their music, and they arent afraid of saying it like it is. Operation Mindcrime became a beloved album for many people, some love its hidden messages, some adore the sad story, and some just bang their heads out from the great songs.<br />Whatever your call is, chances are you are gonna experience one of the best records newer music has seen.
0440236738|5.0|This book was wonderful. Coben's style of writing makes it seem so easy to write a book. The main character speaks to you in a conversational tone and often appologizies for the bad analogies and or cliches he's about to use. It's quite funny at times.<br />All the characters are interesting, especially Squares. You are brought deep into their world right away and are not let go of even after the story is over. Although the ending was satisfying, in my opinion, I wanted more. To me that is one sign of an excellent story. Oh and did I mention the character Squares? He's great.<br />Before this book I was laboring through other books, often not finishing them. I picked this book up from the library on Thursday night and finished Saturday night. It was so much fun to read.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|When most people think of Dire Straits, they tend to either say &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; or &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, or &quot;Walk of Life&quot; And &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;. Few of those I meet actually mentiones this beauty. <br />Love Over Gold is a fantastic album from Dire Straits. Telegraph Road has to be one of the best songs ever, its a ride you will never forget once you hear it. Atmospheric, cold and dark, this album is perfect night music. Telegraph Road, Private Investigations are best heard together, as a whole, with Love over Gold coming afterwards. The more ironical and jokingly Industrial Disease doesnt quite fit, as it breaks the relaxing tone the rest of the record sets, but its a good song. The ending song It Never Rains is a very fitting end song, it kinda works like a finale for a story without the rest of it. However, nothing can take away that Telegraph Road is the star of the show, and its hard to describe what it sounds like. Its unlike anything that Dire Straits ever have done, although it retains some of the well known sounds and lines of their earlier and later songs. Its a &quot;Epic&quot; if I may use a word like that, but I think its right on place. <br />The whole album comes out as yet another wonderful Dire Straits work, only surpassed by Brothers in Arms.
B000002MK8|5.0|There are no words to accurately describe how unbelieveably good this record is.  The song selection is representative of the best Rod has ever done, and his performance is that of a master, handling the material as only he can.  In short, he OWNS this music in a way that no one else ever could.<br />Even tune is a gem, every performance a classic.  Particularly moving is &quot;Tom Traubert's Blues (Waltzing Matilda)&quot;.  I simply cannot listen to Rod sing this tune without getting misty.  The longing in this poetic ballad is simply inexpressible through the printed word.  You'll just have to listen to Rod sing this one to truly understand what I'm talking about.  The lyrics of this tune are somewhat vague and are thusly open to a great deal of interpretation.  Taken as a poem, this tune could mean many different things to different people.  But once you hear Rod sing this classic ... it means what Rod wants it to mean, the unrequited longing of a hopeless romantic being enveloped by a stark and harsh world.<br />Other classics include &quot;Hot Legs&quot;, reworked into a foot-stompin' road house tune, and &quot;People Get Ready&quot;, originally recorded by Jeff Beck with Rod Stewart on guest vocals.  Now, it is presented with a string arrangement replacing Jeff Beck's guitar pyrotechnics.  The effect is subtle and understated, but just as effective as the original.  Composed by the great Curtis Mayfield, this song works as well with a slightly slower tempo and no instrumental soloing.  In short, all the tunes here are terrific, be it the acoustic and yet still fairly-true-to-the-original &quot;Cut Across Shorty&quot; or the very moving &quot;Handbags and Gladrags&quot;.  <br />What is interesting here is that Rod, working with Ronnie Wood and ex-Madonna producer Patrick Leonard, have created an acoustic sound for these tunes that equals, if not surpasses, the original album presentations.  Riffs and soloing give way to a cohesive, acoustic, classic road housesound, a band that exists clearly to support the singer and yet is a musical force-to-be-reckoned-with in its own right.  This group sounds like they've been playing together for decades, and yet that isn't the case at all.  Rod effectively demonstrates this point be remarking that, when &quot;Reason to Believe&quot; was first recorded, &quot;most of the band weren't born!  Me wife was only one,&quot;  Yet these musicians truly have a chemistry with one another that can't be matched.  Perhaps it's Rod and Ronnie working together again that does it ... whatever it is, it WORKS.<br />Get this record.  Get this record even if you HATE Rod Stewart.  Why?  Because after you give it one listen, you won't hate Rod no more.
B00000K19E|5.0|hospital like Sarah Connor was   Long title,huh?The Matrix may be the best movie I ever saw.The special  effecets are simply astonishing.The list of amazing moves goes on and on:bullet time(where Neo avoids tons of bullets by bending extremely low),Trinity's long-time-in-the-air-then-kick,the cartwheel shooting(where Neo does a cartwheel and in the middle of it in mid air shoots upside down,and more.The special effects in the fight scene are absublutely amazing.It has an incredible story.(The world your living in is really a computer generated world to blind you from the truth:Mankind is extremely near extinctness because of machines taking over.Agents,machines inside the matrix,are trying to destroy Zion,the last human city ,which is not in the Matrix.People unplugged from the Matrix (Trinity,Morpheus,etc.)are trying to find &quot;the one&quot; who was in the past a guy born in the Matrix who taught people also in the Matrix the truth.He died and a oracle predicted his return.He would be the one who could fight agents and save the human race.(everyone who had fought an agent has died) The oracle who predicted &quot;the one's &quot; return tells Neo he's not &quot;the one&quot; and that Morpheus believes in him so much he would risk his life to save Neo and that  he would have to make a choice:who dies,Morpheus or him.Because of those who have not seen it yet,that is all I will say.It's a great movie!
B000002L99|4.0|All these years later ...<br />In 2006 &quot;5150&quot; will be twenty years old.  Hard to believe, isn't it?  This powerhouse of a record falls just short of being a classic, defined by Sammy Hagar's soaring melodies and Eddie Van Halen's innovative guitar riffs.  Keyboards abound here as well, marking the evolution of Eddie Van Halen from boy genius guitar hero to a stronger arranger and composer worthy of critical respect.<br />Upon joining the band, journeyman rocker Sammy Hagar lent his own brand of musical showmanship, exhibiting more vocal chops, range and passion than Roth ever could.  Hagar was also an accomplished musician as well as a rock 'n roll frontman, and could double Eddie's guitar parts on tour (allowing Eddie to play keyboards).  <br />In my view, Hagar was just as good (if not better) showman as Roth, and was actually musically talented to boot ... which Roth really wasn't.  This is probably the best record the new &quot;Van Hagar&quot; put together; its energy and spirit are indomitable.  Listening all these years later, I'm still as inspired as I was at 14, a freshman in high school, dreaming of being a rock singer like Hagar.<br />After all these years, it's interesting to see where everybody ended up.  Eddie is apparently holed up in his studio, writing songs and wondering why no one calls.  Roth is about to release his seventh solo album (Seventh?  When was the last time Roth had a hit single?  Who keeps letting him make records??), and is touring the nation in support of his upcoming CD.  Last summer, he and Hagar did the &quot;Heavyweight Champions of Rock 'n Roll&quot; tour, bringing in respectable ticket sales and showing crowds across the country that both men still have what it takes to bring down the house.<br />Ironically, last summer's tour highlighted the major difference between Sam and Dave.  Dave can put on a truly great rock show, and so can Sammy ... difference is, Sammy can sing, write songs, play the hell out of a guitar, and all this between running his bar in Cabo San Lucas and being a family man as well.  And Dave?  Well, Dave can play old Van Halen songs and try to prove that being a nostalga act somehow makes him relevant.  These days, Sammy's writing new songs, and co-headlining one of the hottest tours of the 2003 season with Lynyrd Sknyrd.<br />It seems that Sammy was the most independent of the bunch, the one who could make it on his own.  More power to him, says I.  &quot;5150&quot; will always stand as a testament of what happens when a truly talented rock singer teams up with one of the best back-up groups rock music has ever known.  But when Sammy left eleven years later, the magic he brought to &quot;5150&quot; left with him.  Nowadays, it seems both Dave and Eddie are trying to recapture the essense of what made Van Halen great.  As David Lee Roth once said, &quot;There's a little Van Halen in everybody&quot;.  Well, guys, I think Sammy took what little &quot;Van Halen&quot; there was remaining when he left the band.
B000000993|5.0|Undertow is more straightforward than Ænima or Lateralus.  There's no guessing where one song ends and the next begins; there are no quirky little interludes.  Each song stands firmly on its own.  While Tool has never been much for the \\"A-B-C-A-B\\" sort of song structure, Undertow is definitely more conventional than their newer albums.  The whole album is very powerful, dark, and meticulously produced.  You get the feeling that every single note on the album couldn't be any other way.  Perfection was an obvious goal here, whereas their newer albums feel more improvised and intentionally thick.  Even though each song is musically/structurally diverse, the overall range of emotion is minimal compared to Ænima or Lateralus.<br /><br />The songs from Undertow and Opiate were largely written in the same timeframe.  They specifically picked their heavier songs to be on Opiate, reserving the more dynamic and creative songs for Undertow.

Also, an elevator has its cables severed after a bomb that was planted explodes sending the elevator and numerous passengers in it plummeting over 50 floors down but is stopped temporarily but in only a matter of time, the elevator will crash to the bottom floor and can they rescue those on board before it's too late?<br />However, that is just the tip of the iceberg as two disgruntled cops, are on a hunt to bring down the reign of terror from a retired police officer turned terrorist Howard Payne, and save numerous passengers stuck on a bus with a powerful bomb planted that will explode when the speedometer goes below 50 miles per hour plus the passengers are held hostage as the escape routes are rigged with explosives that'll go off when any passenger attempts to escape through the exits!! Now the two disgruntled cops, with a large task force assembled, go on an extremely dangerous and highly adrenaline-rushing mission to rescue the passengers on the bus WITHOUT causing it to go below 50 miles per hour and also to stop Payne's terrorist activities.<br />The title of this movie is just downright perfect for what the movie really is. It's one very long extremely suspenseful ride along a terrifying visual assault, seeing the bus go over a 50 foot wide gap on an unfinished freeway, and through opposing traffic, I've never seen a movie like this that has so much action yet relatively little of the human to human kind of action, little fist fighting, guns shooting, etc. and for that this movie stands out among the numerous action movies of modern times, being a type of action movie that relies more on long suspenseful sequence rather than just a whole bunch of numerous human to human combat, gunfights, yada yada yada.....<br />Whoever came up with this clever movie plot was a total genius. Sad to see a great movie legacy be watered down with the lousy follow-up sequel \\"Speed 2: Cruise Control\\", which had little of the adrenaline and a far slower paced plot than this one.

B000002UZ5|4.0|This is a really good cd by psb. I was only a kid in the 80's but I have older brother's &amp; sister's so I have come to love 80's music. I fell in love with the psb's when I heard their song west end girls. All of the song's on this cd are great. my favorites are west end girls, what have I done to deserve this, domino dancing &amp; being boring. Don't get me wrong all of the other songs are great too. These are just my personal favorites.<BR>This is one of the best cd's in my opinion that they have ever made. It captures all of their greatest into one mindblowing cd.<BR>If you love psb get this cd &amp; you won't regret it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I am telling everyone, this album is worth buying. Christina moves herself away from her teenybopper image on this disc, to a matured woman who talks about real issues. Ms.Aguilera gives a chilling story on \\"I'm OK\\" about her abusive father which is a highlight on the album. \\"Walk Away\\" is a soulful ballad talking about removing yourself away from a troubled relationship, which is another highlight and one of my favorite songs off the album. \\"Beautiful\\" is the ultimate song where Christina gives empowerment to just 'loving yourself,' no matter how much someone may hurt you. There is a female empowerment song called \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" which features the rhymes of Lil'Kim and invoices the double standards of female sexuality with an urban beat.\\"Fighter\\" is another song where Christina speaks about her father, with a rock edge and Dave Navarro ripping on the guitar. Alica Keys also appears on the album writing the song \\"Impossible\\" and doing background vocals on this soulful song. The Alicia-produced track has Christina singing \\"It's impossible to love you, If you don't let me know, What you're feeling, yeah\\". \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\" is another soulful ballad where the title explains the song. This is a recognizable album. It is something that almost everyone can listen to. She explores many different genre's on this album:rock, soul, gospel, hip hop/r&b. Everyone who was turned off by \\"Dirrty\\" please forget it. The album has a completely different approach and it is for the better. This truly is a  magnificent work of art.
6305076995|1.0|Too short = 76 minutes (not complete concert as 2 cd set) + Too expensive ( same price as Led Zep, new 2 DVD), don't buy, if you like Yes, buy Yessong in cd only
B00005JMFR|5.0|Theories of exectly why Neo has the ability to use his power outside the Matrix have surfaced so I'm here to offer mine or possibly just to discredit others. Some say that it wasn't Neo who stopped the machine and that it was a nearby ship's EMP. I discredit this for two reasons. First, if it was an EMP, why did Neo pass out. Secondly, I don't believe Larry and Andy would do that. Leave people mystified for six months about how Neo can use his powers in the real world then tell us in the third movie that he can't and it was just another ships EMP. Another theory is that the real world is not actually a real world but another simulation like the matrix and that the matrix is actually a matrix within a matrix. I liked this theory but again I don't believe Larry and Andy would do that. It would seem too much like a lame twist added just to be another twist. I won't say it's not possible, but I would say it's unlikely. So what's my theory? I don't quite have one yet. I'm taking a watch and wait stance. I'll find the answer when I sit in that theater seat November 5th.
1582432678|5.0|All of the other reviews pretty much tell the story, so I'll be brief.  I heard about the book on NPR and had taught at a sister school to Columbine at the time of its tragedy.  It was a must read.  I thoroughly agree with all of the five star reviews.<br />I've recommended it to everyone.  I especially want my book club to read it so that we can discuss it because the subject is so &quot;close to home.&quot;  It is a fantastic book for book clubs because I'm sure it will create some very animated discussion and controversial views.
B000099T2L|3.0|Beyoncé - Dangerously in Love (Columbia, 2003)<br />It may seem to critics that Beyoncé's solo album, Dangerously in Love, was the final result of an ongoing marketing ploy. Her group, Destiny's Child, was managed by her father, her mother designed their outfits, you only really heard Beyoncé's voice in the chorus to each of their songs, and she was always the prettiest in every photo shoot. And now that she is &quot;dating&quot; Jay-Z in addition to having a few acting deals, the spotlight is ready for Ms. Knowles. Whether this theory is true or not, this album does have its moments of greatness.<br />I gave up on everything Destiny-related after that terrible album Survivor, but after listening to &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and the Donnie/Roberta remake of &quot;The Closer I Get to You&quot; featuring Luther Vandross, I decided to give this album a try. Two other great songs are the lustful &quot;Speechless&quot; and &quot;Naughty Girl&quot; (the latter sounds a little like Bow Wow's current hit, &quot;Let's Get Down&quot;). But what could be the album's best song is &quot;Me, Myself, and I&quot; where Beyoncé goes back to her &quot;triflin' man-hating&quot; days and gives us a nice, moving piece of a love gone wrong.<br />But there are also some low points, hence the 3-star rating. Some say that &quot;Signs&quot; was ruined when producer Missy Elliott yells &quot;Rewind!&quot; during the second verse, but the song was already on shaky ground when it started. &quot;That's How You Like It&quot; with Jay-Z is mediocre at best, and the last four tracks (&quot;Gift from Virgo&quot;, &quot;Daddy&quot;, &quot;Work it Out&quot;, and Jay-Z's &quot;'03 Bonnie and Clyde&quot;) are all wack. Moreover, it seems peculiar to give a tribute track to your father when he's also your producer. Oh well, Beyoncé still proves that she has what it takes to compete with the other female singers today. -EJR
0802130208|4.0|This is a wonderful book, the discussion of which, up to this point, has been quite enjoyable. However, if you're the English teacher at a preppy New England boarding school, in the future please refrain from having your ENTIRE CLASS of trust-fund dolts post their endless, pointless, insipid, identical reviews on this site, okay? While I'm certain they are VERY special and represent some of our nation's finest families, no one comes to here to be subjected to 25... book reports. Thanks.
B00008J4P5|5.0|The liner notes to Elephant contain this gem:<br />\\"No computers were used during the writing, recording, mixing or mastering of this record.\\" Please note this is a \\"record\\" and not a compact disc.<br />That buried nugget really sums up this album, the best recorded in the United Kingdom since 1980. The equipment Jack and Meg White used was as primitive as the technology that gave us that earlier classic, Pretenders I. The simplicity makes Elephant more intriguing than high tech sound devoid of all humanity. Rock and roll stripped of its blues and country roots can be interesting but completely soulless. Jack sings the blues on Elephant and the record ends with a country and western tune. The White Stripes have become the Anti-Radiohead, ironically in the same year that band has released its first decent CD (note: \\"CD\\") in five years.<br />No record is perfect, but this comes astonishingly close. There is no weak spot. You expect one halfway through after Jack sings the lovely melody \\"You've Got Her in Your Pocket.\\" What immediately follows, though, are the best hard-driving songs on the album--the overtly sexual blues moan \\"Ball and Biscuit,\\" and the amazing rockers \\"Hardest Button To Button,\\" \\"Little Acorns,\\" \\"Hypnotize,\\" \\"The Air Near My Fingers,\\" and the upbeat \\"Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine.\\" The three punk-influenced songs that open the album--\\"Seven Nation Army,\\" \\"Black Math,\\" and \\"There's No Room for You Here,\\" already have marked this album as the best of the year before you even get to this point.  Sometimes you hear the Animals, sometimes the Stones, sometimes Robert Johnson. Along the way is Meg's haunting vocal debut, \\"In the Cold, Cold Night,\\" which marks a strong addition to the Stripes' arsenal. <br />Because it is so rare to be this effusive about anything, there is a temptation to fob off as silly the last song, \\"Well, It's True That We Love One Another.\\" Yet on second listen, this playful country trio that features Holly Golightly with Jackand Meg measures up to the rest of the album.<br />This is more than the best album that has been released this decade. It is a record destined to be a classic.
B0000057C5|4.0|This album is very good, but seeming i own every rammstein album i just find it hard not to compare this album to their others. Any way yes this album lacks a few things, i found it hard to get their songs stuck in my head. No this album is not forgettable(actually quite far from it), it is just Rammsteins MOST forgettable album. What bothers me about this album is that it seems to be Rammsteins most well known album(looking at the amount of reviews) which i find sad seeming their other two albums had more effort and thought put into them. I also found the lyrics very sad. Yes i know their album Herzeieled had violent lyrics but i found this albums lyrics more disturbing. I especially found songs like \\"Spiel Mit Mir\\", \\"Bueck Dich and \\"Tier\\" very disturbing. The reason why i find this albums lyrics disturbing is because it is disturbing in a sexual way. Other than that i recomend this album as a last album to buy by Rammstein. Get Herzeieled first which is their most energetic album or even get their newest album Mutter first which is their most mature album and best in my opinion.<br />album ratings: Herzeieled: 5/5 Sehnsucht: 4/5 Mutter: 5/5<br />Ok, now onto the positive points about this album. This album is fun to listen to and is a treat for the ears. I like it how Till Lindeman(singer) sings in German because German is a very aggresive language(possibly the most aggresive language) which is perfect for metal. Some people may think of the language German as the pig language, but i think its a very nice language. The two guitarists are very good they deliver nice hard crunching, aggresive riffs. The bassist is very good as well he chucks in some very nice solo's, i really love his solo in the middle of the song \\"Spiel Mit Mir\\". The drummer is great as well he doesn't just beat the hell out of his drums, he beats his drums with care and style and last but not least keyboardist Flake is terrific he adds reasonable amounts of beats, his beats are like a pinch of flavour for the music and he is the most humorous band member(watch their dvd and ya'll know what i mean). Thankyou for reading.
B000093BDX|5.0|Red, white, and blue recording of<BR>the greatest U.S. band ever. Personally,<BR>I can do without &quot;Kokomo&quot;. But, about<BR>20 of the 30 recordings on this album<BR>are probably somewhere in the heart, <BR>mind, and soul of anyone who listens<BR>to music-young or old. From Nirvana<BR>to Britney Spears it all started with<BR>this band, more specifically &quot;Pet<BR>Sounds&quot; (1965). Enjoy the greatest<BR>U.S. rock/pop band in history!!!
B000005JA8|5.0|You have to be a little more open, people. My thanks to every reviewer who gave this album five or four stars because it truly deserves it. In my opinion it is one of the most revolutionary albums of all time. Before &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; came out, with the exception of Frank Zappa (and maybe not even him), was anybody doing this kind of music? Not by a long shot. Not only is Captain Beefheart a genius poet (not that his words mean much, they are just cool combinations of words. I mean come on, &quot;fast and bulbous&quot;, who else could think of that?)his songs are actually very structured if you listen to this album hundreds of times over. The band is actually playing on certain rhythms though it may not sound like it. Though it may seem hard to very the songs with this strange structure, every song (except the ones that are supposed to sound the same for effect) sound different. And come on, all you one-star reviewers, if you wanted to hear a poppy, love ballad, melodic sort of album, buy an ELO or Beatles album. I mean really, by looking at the cover of this album and by the name of the songs, the picture on the back, and just by the look of the album as a whole, do you think this guy would be a poppy songwriter? You were expecting  pop album, and you got something sounding a lot different than you wanted, so you immediately regarded it as bad. And besides you shouldn't just blindly buy an album, you should at least have some idea how it sounds before you buy it. For everyone else out there who is open to different, experimental types of music, definitely buy this one. There was nothing as different or unique as this when it came out or now. A masterpiece.
0385503954|4.0|I had to put this novel down halfway through, as I found it a bit unsettling.  It wouldn't let me stay away for long, though;  I'm glad I picked it up again.  McEwan's writing gets under your skin -- a good thing, since most novels are forgotten once you put them down.  Rich, fleshed-out characters and situations.  You spend a great deal of the novel trying to decide if you love or hate the little girl at the center of this story.  Engaging and well-crafted.
B000002OX5|5.0|I usually write long, very in-depth, detailed, and wordy reviews for albums. This one will be very brief:<BR>                                                                           This has the best concept of any album ever, and it is quite possibly, overall, the best concept album ever.<BR>Period.<br />    See? Easy as that.
B000069HKH|3.0|A pretty good album that will please the die-hard fans who won't let Springsteen evolve and explore. &quot;Empty Sky&quot; and &quot;Nothing Man&quot; are great tracks -- but &quot;Mary's Place&quot; and &quot;Waiting on a Sunny Day&quot; will be the crowd pleasers, since they're the type of songs people are used to from Springsteen. Listening to this, you realize how much more he's capable of as a musician and a songwriter, and he hints at it.  But you also sense a restraint -- he won't let himself do another &quot;Nebraska.&quot; Too bad.  Let him at least try something new.
0671027387|3.0|. . . but 3.5 stars is not an option.<br />The good - you won't be able to resist the plot. This book moves fast. Brown spins a yarn that you just have to pull from the sweater to see where it leads.<br />The bad - Hmmm. It isn't exactly realistic. If you're looking for Tom Clancy, this ain't it. It doestand above Clive Cussler's books on the realism scale but then again, so does Harry Potter at times. :)<br />Do I recommend it? Yes. Is it the best novel ever? No.<br />Another book like this that I recommend - similar speed &amp; government/military/technology thriller - is 'Icefire' by the Reeves-Stevens team.
0064430227|5.0|I worried this might be too meaty for my 2-year-old, but he adores this story.  It's at once simple and engaging -- and (I believe) great fodder for the imagination.  It's almost epic compared to other children's books -- so take a pass if you're looking for a quick read before bedtime!  But if you want a book you can linger over with your child -- this is it.
B00005JLZN|5.0|This movie is one that I could replay many times and still think, \\"Wow, what a great movie!\\"  I admit that my political views are slightly left of center; therefore, I am in totally agreement with the movie's political message.  I do, however, think that the right-wing conservative would also value the movie.  The plot is suspenseful and clever-something that anyone, despite his/her political views, would enjoy.  I don't think that the attempt to put in a message hurt the plot by any means.  The message isn't offensive or overly stated.<br />The character of David Gale (Kevin Spacey) is quite complex.  He does not fit the stereotype of someone on death row.  He's a dad, a professor, an anti-capital punishment activist, a friend, and a lover.  But he's also enjoys sex outside of wedlock and often drinks uncontrollably.  He is human with many characteristics, perhaps similar to yours.  The complexity of characters does not allow for much predictability of events.<br />The movie is thought provoking, but not hard to understand.  You won't be scratching your head wondering what happened or what deep meaning you were supposed to get.  You will however think about it whenever you're stuck in traffic the morning after you watch it.    I highly recommend it.
0393057658|5.0|I consider myself a baseball fan. However, I indulge my interest by following the Boston Red Sox, which is to say that I have a love/hate relationship with the game depending on how things are going with the Old Towne Team. Recently a friend put me on to this book and I am eternally grateful for the recommendation as things have been going on in baseball that I have been blissfully unaware of and finding out about them was both entertaining and informative.<br />The recent success of the Oakland Athletics is something I knew about, if for no other reason than they raised hell with Boston's efforts to secure a wild card spot. Billy Beane? Never heard of him. Not as a baseball player (not many others did either) or as GM of the Oakland A's. <br />Michael Lewis has made sure that we all know about Billy in this eminently readable account of how a young general manager takes players that no one else wants or appreciates and using an approach that has been around for some time devised by Bill James turns the A's into a force to be reckoned with. And he does it with little or no money by the standards of the bigger franchises.<br />The part of the book where James's theories are explained can be a bit dry, but the book really sizzles when we get into the stories of the players. We are permitted into the drafting process and given an inside look into the acquisition of some of the A's key players and the mind of Billy Bean as he wheels and deals to trade for players whom he needs to fill in the blanks in an organization which appears to have many. It is funny, it is instructive, it is irreverant and it is very, very readable.<br />There are a lot of traditional wisdoms in baseball and this book exposes many of them. If you want to understand what is happening with teams such as the A's, the Red Sox and the Blue Jays, this book is required reading.
B000002GQJ|5.0|This album is plainly one of the greatest albums in my large collection.  Whenever you listen to it, you go on a journey in search of the meaning of life and you can't help but fall into it's music and insightive lyrics.  A very well balanced album with some of the most beautiful compositions ever wrote.  Words are extremely difficult to describe the amount of emotion felt with each song.  Each song is good, a rareity in albums having all strong tracks, well accomplished here. The entire band shows their masterful useage of their instruments and song writing ability.  Pick this one up today, it's an album that belongs in every classic rock collection!
B00005V3Z4|4.0|I finally got my hands on this film after reading all the reviews here. It certainly is very well-made, and quite original.<BR>I think some people are going over the top in their comments though. I mean this could've also been an extended TWILIGHT ZONE or OUTER LIMITS episode. That being said, it does draw you in with it's moody, matter of fact storytelling. The acting is fantastic. Oddly, this film does parallel with the style of AMERICAN BEAUTY as everything seems hyperreal, and the actors make you believe you're almost watching a documentary of a story that just happened in some neighborhood even when it's being somewhat sarcastic or purposely strange with the dialogue. Definitely includes great 80's song choices, and a beautiful score. I can't wait to see what the writer/director will follow this up with. Still, I'm only giving it 4 stars because I felt some of the quirkiness, and jumbled style is unsubstantiated. I couldn't help feeling as if something was missing overall. Perhaps the answers lie in the deleted scenes? I guarantee the film raises more questions than it answers, so it won't appeal to action fans or those who prefer a tidy ending. Otherwise if you like films that leave you wondering about things in general afterwards, this comes highly recommended!
B000002UB3|5.0|As eager as they were to go their seperate ways, these guys knew that something immortal was receiving its final chapter. &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is not only the finale but the culmination of this unique band. Individually they proved that the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. John needed Paul's discipline as much as Paul needed John's sense of abandon. George needed the other two to spur his inspiration(as evidenced by the fact that his &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was written before they disbanded.)<br /> 'Something' and 'Here Comes the Sun' are probably the best songs George ever wrote and they're two of the Beatle's best songs. Some say Paul's 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer' is an annoying little trifle but I've always enjoyed its simplicity and faux innocence. 'Come Together' and 'Because' have to be among John's best songs. But it is the great medley that gives this album its ultimate greatness. When you come to the end of it, knowing that it signals the end of an era, you can accept that because that era produced this medley of marvels. If the Beatles had to go away, they couldn't possibly have left on a better note.
B000002H33|5.0|This is an album any self respecting heavy metal fan should own! One of the best albums made in history and the last Metallica opus with possibly the best bassist ever to grace the earth, Cliff Burton (r.i.p).<br />The album has 8 untimely classic tracks and there is not 1 poor track in sight. The albums title track, 'Master of Puppets', is the main standout track here, amazing riffs, solo's, well written lyrics and a beautiful harmony break in the middle of the song.<br />The main formula in the title track is present in the other tracks on this epic album. The album has a hidden concept to it in nearly all tracks which is of a drug addict, read the lyrics and you'll see what I mean.<br />Other notably brilliant tracks include the monumental ballad '(Welcome Home) Sanitarium', the rifftastic trash fueled album closer 'Damage Inc.' and the beautifully orchestrated and classic instrumental 'Orion'.<br />This is the best album Metallica have made in their career (spanning 20 years) and one of the best albums of all time.<br />If you don't have this yet you are missing one very special album. Go buy it...now!
B000089RVX|5.0|Some people say that everything they do has been done before, that their lyrics are tired, that there are older groups who deserve the fame more. As a fan who's been listening since they were a favorite on the local band shows, even I will admit that I like their earlier work better than their studio offering. <br />What too many people fail to realize, however, is the one thing that Evanescence has that sets them apart from all the rest: that voice. Many women have lovely voices; I've done some singing myself. But when it comes to Evanescence, everything is secondary to that amazing voice. The beauty of her voice makes me cry every time she sings, no matter what she sings. There aren't many singers who wield that sort of power.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney's at her best with this album!  FINALLY!!  Alittle more raunchyness vrs. her typical innocent sexiness!!  And she broke out with I'm A Slave 4 U, and continues on with smashing hits!  Her Dream within a Dream tour proved her to be on top of the pop game and a TRUE entertainer!  I love Britney, and True Britney Fan...And I will be for a long time at this rate.  AND I may also like to add that I AM 22 and not a teenager!  Cause it seems to me that people who praise Britney for her natural talent seem to be always mistaken for a person under the age of 13.  SO FOR THE RECORD, NO I AM 22 YEARS OLD!!
B00005LK94|5.0|This is very possibly the best &quot;family film&quot; in decades, by which I mean this is a film that parents and kids will enjoy watching together.  It has an appeal that adults can relate to, and kids simply love it.  My family has watched this movie together many times.<br />The story is about a young girl (Amy, played excellently by Anna Panquin) whose parents have split up; her father (Jeff Daniels) lives in Canada and her mother with whom she lives is in New Zealand.  When mom is killed in an auto accident, Amy goes to Canada to live with her downright eccentric dad.  She is unhappy and out of place until she adopts a flock of baby geese, and this is where the story really starts.  The geese have lost their parents, and do not know how to migrate.  Amy and her dad and their friends decide to teach them how.  What a great story, and the cinematography of the flight scenes is breathtaking and astounding!  This is a funny, touching, and entertaining movie that deserves every one of the five stars that most reviewers have awarded it.  The story is out there on the outer edge of plausibility and this gives it a magical quality that sends the message that all things are possible with perserverence, intelligence, and luck. I cannot imagine any family not enjoying this superb film.<br />Fine performances by Miss Panquin, Jeff Daniels and the supporting cast.  This is one of those films where everything came together very well, to make what has become a true classic.  The storyline moves along smartly, the acting is consistently good, and the ending is truly touching.  By the way, the scene where the baby geese are born in my opinion is one of the finest and most touching scenes ever to grace either DVD or the silver screen.  Don't miss it.
B0000028RR|5.0|Another one of the greatest albums of the Nineties. In fact, this is one of the greatest albums in rock n' roll history.    <br />Sure Zack De La Rocha is a sloganeer, if you don't agree with him, which I don't much of the time. But, when I'm listening to him, I believe every word he screams. <br />Tom Morello is a revelation on guitar. Rage took the hip-hop playbook and did it all without sampling, scratching or machines. The sound effects, shrieks, wails, loops, scratching, industrial noise was all created by Morello. That's mind-blowing enough, but the thing that will put Morello in the annals of guitar heroes (just imagine the mullet-headed, rebel-flag-bandana wearing dudes banging their head and playing air guitar to Rage once the shock of the new wears off and this music oozes it's way into the backwater areas of our great nation) is the conviction with which he plays. I know he graduated from Harvard and all, but this guy rocks.<br />Then there is Brad Wilk. He combines the sensibility of Clyde Stubblefield (James Brown's drummer) with the power of a Metallica, or Soundgarden. He's the first drummer since John Bonham to make Hard Rock groove.<br />History will see Rage Against the Machine as the Clash to Nirvana's Sex Pistols, or as the Rolling Stones were to the Beatles; In other words, the more truly angry, not able to garner quite as much attention, but perhaps longer lasting. <br />As for my not agreeing with Zack De La Rocha's ideas. I must say, that I largely do agree with him. However, maybe not quite in the same way as he means. For instance, I agree that TV is a \\"Bullet in the Head.\\" However, I don't think TV speaks purely for the government. Much of TV is against the government. It does exist to sell you products, but all you gotta do is turn it off and spend some time helping people out, or talking to your loved ones. In other words, the problem is more nuanced and a violent revelution is not, in my opinion, the only solution.<br />Likewise, I believe people do have to \\"take the power back.\\" However, people don't all agree on what they want to do with the power. And, at some points in the history of this country, it's good that the will of the people was supressed. An example of this is the suppression of the will of the people of the southern states during the Civil Rights era. Got it?<br />And moreover, when Zack intones that Europe ain't his rope to swing on, and that he \\"can't learn a thing from it,\\" he's being downright racist, in addition to exhibiting blind ignorance.  .....
B000092ZYX|5.0|Wow. Having listened to this album only once so far, I can guarantee that I'll be listening to it many, many times more.<br />I've always been an almost die-hard Radiohead fan; I proudly proclaim that &quot;OK Computer&quot; is my favorite album of all time. With the releases of some other of their more recent works, such as &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, I do admit I was a little dissapointed. I can respect an artist's need to chart new territory for themselves, but after wearing out my &quot;OK Computer&quot; cd, and loving all their previous recordings, I was kind of bummed out about the barely listenable sound of &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot;. Each had a few songs that did for me what earlier Radiohead recordings had; painting intricate works of art full of life and emotion in my head, but for the most part those cds collected dust on my shelf.<br />When I'd heard that Radiohead was coming out with a new album, I wasn't too enthused, thinking that it would be another &quot;Kid A&quot; or &quot;Amnesiac&quot;. I'm very glad that I was wrong to assume that.<br />&quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; is well balanced to the point of perfection, invoking those works of art that &quot;OK Computer&quot; and &quot;The Bends&quot; did, as well as a wealth of ideas and emotion. You can find a piece of each of their albums, from &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; to &quot;Amnesiac&quot; in Hail to the Thief, plus a new array of outside influence. A few songs, including &quot;There There&quot; and &quot;Punch up at a Wedding&quot; have prominent, groovable beats not previously found in Radiohead's music; a pure delight. There is great lyrical value to all the songs, especially &quot;Punch up&quot; and &quot;Where I End and You Begin&quot;. <br />This album has it all, from the electronic sounds of &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; to the more guitar based melodies of &quot;The Bends&quot; to the exceptional lyrical value of &quot;OK Computer&quot; and thenonto a whole new level, shining through in every song on the album. This album is sure to impress existing Radiohead fans, while attracting a broader crowd.
B00005JL96|2.0|As I watched this movie, I kept on wandering when it was going to get better, and weave that magic spell that only disney can do, but it never came. The movie draged on and on, without a real meaning. It did not seem like a disney movie at all. I only hope that they will come out with a better movie. I give it two stars because the kids liked it, although I wish I never bought it, but at least it entertained the kids, but only the kids.
B00008K7AM|5.0|Yes, this movie isn't exactly the most intelligent piece of cinema ever, but it's funny as hell. The characters are all pretty likable and have their share of funny lines and moments. The plot is based around a snotty popular girl who steals magic earrings from a store in the mall and in a freak incident, trade bodies with a criminal. The comedy takes off from there although it unfortunately bases most of the movie around the girl in the man's body instead of the other way around. Be on the look-out for the hillarious scenes involving Jessica's *the main character's* friend Ling Ling and her mother. If you're looking for just a good laugh, I highly recommend this.
B00000DC10|5.0|Now THIS is punk!  I know, I know, REAL punk, as defined by the Ramones, the Clash, the Sex Pistols, etc., has been \\"dead\\" for quite some time now, and all these pathetic groups that think they're rebels just because they dye their hair weird colors are driving rusty nails into punk's coffin, however...<br />...REAL punk is truly about being rebellious from the norm.  REAL punk bands aren't that well-known (at least at the time--so many people in the '70's had a clue who the Ramones were at first).  REAL punk is often politically outspoken.<br />And here, Refused have--or rather, HAD--all these traits.  Led by Dennis Lyxzen (now fronting the [International] Noise Conspiracy), Refused wrote songs about anything from how history books lie (their famous song, \\"Burn It\\"), to how they themselves were making a difference in the music world.  Just...look at some lyrics online.  You'll see what I mean.<br />Now, for their absolute musical talents.<br />The subtitle to this CD is \\"A Chimerical Bombination in 12 Bursts.\\"  This is so simply the truth.  Here we have songs ranging from (actually talented) straight-out hardcore (\\"New Noise,\\" one of my favorites), jazz-influenced (\\"Liberation Frequency\\" and \\"The Deadly Rhythm\\"-on this latter one, just listen to the bridge of the song!  Pure jazz!), and often bordering on...techno (like on the latter half of the first track, \\"Worms of the Senses/Faculties of the Skull,\\" as well as \\"Brutist Pome #5\\").<br />Dennis Lyxzen has quite a range of vocals in his voice; from unbelievably hardcore screams that put all the new \\"screamo\\" bands to pure shame, to spoken-word, to falsetto-pitched melodies.  This guy is very talented.  Again, for more, check out some of his work with the (International) Noise Conspiracy.<br />Kristofer Steen and Jon Brannstrom: two guitarists that, while they obviously know quite a few things on playing the strings, don't overdo it or rub it in your face.  They can be heavy, they can be soft, they play acoustic, electric, whatever!<br />Magnus Bjorklund, a very talented bassist.  He helps pull in some more of the jazzier parts, especially on said bridge of \\"The Deadly Rhythm,\\" where he plays a standing bass.<br />...and then there's David Sandstrom, drummer extraordinaire.  He can do it all: jazzy, quieter parts; loud, snare-heavy abominations of noise.  He's so damn fast, he's...UGH!  LISTEN TO THIS MAN PLAY!<br />Sadly, Refused broke up in 1999, less than a year after completing this album, which to me is their absolute magnum opus.  Raid Amazon and your local used stores for this band's music!  Other notable albums to get include EVERLASTING, SONGS TO FAN THE FLAMES OF DISCONTENT, and the EP released in conjunction with this album, the NEW NOISE E.P.<br />CAN I SCREAM!!?
B00003CXPD|4.0|First of all this critical review about \\"Billy Elliot\\" is the summary of lots of critical reviews from our English class.

B000059PPN|4.0|Well, we're back in Fulci land.  Putting this up with Zombie, City,  and The Beyond, this is probably my least favorite.  That's not to say it's not fun, just the lesser in comparison to the others.  This time the threat hides in a basement instead of the island of Matool or the town of Dunwich.  There's no gates of hell to worry about or book of Enoch(or Eibon for that matter).  This time we got that wacky Dr. Freudstein up to his old rejuvenation-through-death-and-dismemberment shenanigans.  The usual Fulci tomfoolery happens: Scenes that are supposed to be scary, but end up being hilarious.  I'm thinking of the bat scene in particular.  Unnecessary closeups of eyes and a pointless psychic child.  So, this Freudstein ventures out of the cellar now and again to slaughter people that venture into the house.  He moves like molasses in January, but manages to get his victims anyway.  Though he's on a homicidal rampage, he never comes upstairs to kill the family that lives in the house, he just waits for them to come downstairs in the final ten minutes of the film.  The funniest scene has a terribly annoying kid trapped by the cellar door as Freudstein slowly creeps up the stairs after him.  Mom breaks the door key and a knife trying to open the door as the kid screams, making you wonder how the doctor ever gets out of the cellar if this door is such a hassle.  The doctor pushes the kid's head against the door as Dad tries to chop the door down with an axe, barely missing the kid's head each time.  Dad must not be too concerned coz he stops between axe swings to explain to Mom, who is in the cellar and what he's doing down there.  This scene is priceless and worth the price of the dvd alone.  As with all Fulci films, this ends on kind of a downer, though not as much as his previous films.  This is typical Fulci-ya love it or ya hate it, just don't take it to seriously or you lose all the fun.

B000002OZY|5.0|Pete Townshend's 1969 masterpiece was obviously not created in a vacuum. It's full of influences from many important artists of the era - and not just the Beatles - and in itself is the conclusion of an experiment that Townshend was conducting since early '66. Still, Tommy was probably the most important and original creation in rock since the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper, and I don't find it possible to name the top ten albums of all time without mentioning it.<br />Definitely the first full-scale rock opera written, arguably the best one (in close competition with Andrew Lloyd Webber's and Tim Rice's `Jesus Christ Superstar' from 1970, and Pink Floyd's `The Wall'). Sgt. Pepper was named the first concept album ever because of its intertwining structure, but Tommy gave the concept meaning. Musically, it's one of the handful rock albums in history that can really be called perfect, as composition and arrangements go. As for instrumental and vocal performance, Tommy shows four brilliant musicians at the very top of their career. Townshend makes for possibly the best rhythm guitarist to ever grace a rock n' roll band, and his lead abilities don't fall short either; John Entwistle, inarguably one of the top five bass players in rock history, does his best and amazes as usual, and his trademark French horn also comes in handy; Roger Daltrey's vocals and his touching portrayal of Tommy are soulful and painfully beautiful; and drummer Keith Moon's performance is his very best ever. This album is worth listening to several times with emphasis on different layers. Try it once listening just to the drums.<br />The plot is often confusing, and usually very vague. What exactly do the disciples do to Tommy at the end of `We're Not Gonna Take It'? What is it precisely that Tommy sees and can never tell anyone in `1921'? Did the Lover kill the Father? Did the father kill the Lover? Is it just witnessing Mother's infidelity? Is the `Father' Captain Walker? But that vagueness is the beautyof the album. The most important problem with the awful movie made in 1973 (bad acting, bad singing and bad arrangements aside) should have been foreseen from the very start of the production - Tommy was simply not meant to be a movie, and to make the plot completely clear and obvious makes the whole thing look a bit dumb. Tommy is a spiritual journey, and it's important to remember that it's not a Broadway musical, but a rock opera - half musical, half rock album. The music should be precisely as important as the story, and vagueness in details makes the music meld with the lyrics and the plot.<br />Within the complete, wonderful creation that is this rock opera, Tommy has some classic songs which are terrific moments of rock music the likes of which only Townshend and co. could create - `Pinball Wizard', despite stupid lyrics, is a musical masterpiece and an incredibly catchy tune; `Christmas', `We're Not Gonna Take It',  `I'm Free', `Amazing Journey', `The Acid Queen', `Welcome', `Go To The Mirror' and Entwistle's `Cousin Kevin' - each one is a terrific rock song by its own right, but the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts. The entire album might be a bit heavy on first listen - it took me three times through to really get into it, but the catchy songs scattered around the album will help you through it, and when you get into the album and get to know it, it'll become one of your top CDs. The long instrumental sections also make the listening experience somewhat tiring, but once you know the songs and the musical themes that run throughout it you'll appreciate them more, especially the classic overture and the haunting `Sparks', but also the somewhat oversized `Underture', that runs over ten minutes and cuts the album neatly in half.<br />No CD collection would be perfect without Tommy; if you don't have any other album by the Who, get Tommy rather than a compilation album, it's deeper and much more rewarding.

B00004ZB9D|5.0|I mostly listen to new age music but even though its my favorite type of music I still like to listen to rock and roll. Lenny Kravitz is my favorite rock musician along with my other favorite Michael Jackson. Their music is very different. Lenny's music is much louder than Michael's where he plays softer music with more of a dance beat.<br />  The first song I heard from Lenny Kravitz was &quot;American Woman&quot; which was originally sung by the group &quot;The Guess Who&quot;. I heard it on my compilation CD &quot;Now That's What I Call Music Vol. 3&quot; and thats also an album you might want to try.<br />  Anyway, I'll mention a few of my favorites: Fly Away, Again, Can't get you off my mind and I belong to you[ which I heard from Now 4. But all in all every song is great.<br />  If you already own the greatest hits you might want to try 5 which is in my opinion Lenny Kravitz's second best album.<br />  I recommend this album to everyone who loves rock and roll!

B000028U0Y|5.0|This album is so legendary it is almost impossible to review it with any objectivity or without heaping superlatives upon it.  Suffice to say that this one of the classic country albums of all time.  <br /><br />Filled with plenty of prison songs, this was definately a show for the inmates and Folsom and one I'm sure they appreciated.  &quot;Folsom Prison Blues,&quot; &quot;Busted,&quot; Cocaine Blues,&quot; &quot;25 Minutes to Go,&quot; &quot;The Wall&quot; and many others were songs a lot of these guys could personally identify with.  Of course, he also a religious song &quot;Greystone Chapel&quot; (actually written by a Folsom inmate.)<br /><br />Other great tunes like &quot;Orange Blossom Special,&quot; &quot;Long Black Veil,&quot; &quot;The Legend of John Henry's Hammer,&quot; &quot;Green Green Grass of Home&quot; and &quot;Jackson&quot; are performed with grit and passion.<br /><br />The between song banter that's been restored here gives the show a laid back feel and let's Cash's personality shine through.<br />Get this album!
B000001FMX|5.0|It was 30 years ago today (27 Jul 2003) that The New York Dolls debut album hit record store shelves. I think it's safe to say, these thirty years would have been much different had that record not come out. <br />It has been suggested that The New York Dolls emerged in 1973 just as The Rolling Stones relavence was ebbing (a point I might argue if provoked). And, as if things don't happen all on their own, one might look at The Dolls and see a trashier, dumbed-down lip-stick-smeared drag-queen version of Jagger and Richards (especially David Johansen and Johnny Thunders - it's uncanny!) but musically made up of equal parts Iggy Pop swamp-monster sleaze, Lou Reed's gritty street-sense, T. Rex's jangly mess, and the charging glam-jam of David Bowie. The result was The New York Dolls were louder, and even more strung-out than their peers.<br />Iggy Pop once said that he single-handedly killed the sixties. That may be so, but it wasn't until July 27th, 1973 that The New York Dolls came kicking and screaming, in their high heels and track-marked arms, it wasn't until then that they showed us how good and gritty bad music can sound. <br />The punk scene would have been much different minus The Dolls. It's unlikely The Ramones would have done it quite the way they did, and The Sex Pistols certainly wouldn't have happened. In fact, Malcolm McLaren managed the tail end of The Dolls before he moved back to England to create The Sex Pistols. Malcolm dressed The Dolls in patent red leather and draped giant sickle & hammer red flags behind them on stage, all this to upset the American public. None of his antics seemed to work with The Dolls, as they were nodding out of consciousness more than half of the time. It may have been easier for Malcolm McLaren to go from a band with two zonked junkies to a band with only one. <br />'I was trying to do with the Sex Pistols what I had failed with the New York Dolls' --Malcolm McLaren <br />In fact, Malcolm wanted to hire either Sylvain Sylvain of The New York Dolls or Richard Hell (then of Television) to front his incomplete Sex Pistols. <br />'Malcolm...he always wanted me to come over and start a group called the Sex Pistols' --Sylvain Sylvain <BR>...and in retrospect: <br />'It was a stupid idea of mine...no way Hell or Syl would have fit in with the Pistols. Hell and Syl had years on the Pistols...the Pistols were incredibly naïve.' --Malcolm McLaren <br />The Sex Pistols, on the other hand, perhaps spawned at least partly by The Dolls, rejected the accusation completely on their song called New York. Johnny Rotten explained he and the rest of the band were sick and tired of Malcolm McLaren endlessly going on about The Dolls and The New York scene, which the Pistols felt was too poetry based and arty. New York was their reaction against The New York Dolls. <br />Johnny Thunders and drummer Jerry Nolan, after the demise of The New York Dolls, formed The Heartbreakers with Richard Hell (who didn't stay long). Amoung the many great punk songs that Johnny Thunders is responsible for, one is a response to The Sex Pistols nasty New York called London Boys. It was more brutal than the flimsy musical fight Lennon and MacCartney employed on their albums. <br />But it was with their debut album, only 11 songs, that the Dolls created all that haggard, whacked and wasted neo-Euro clumsy art rock. A fantastic set of stripped down freak-out garage-boogie.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Great new artist, Great CD with 11 great songs NO filler. This is the real deal. Billy Joel, Elton John, and Spingsteen did not have such a great first release. At last a artist who can write.
0060012218|4.0|What the other reviews here omit is that GEOGRAPHY CLUB is also an interesting look at the struggle between different kinds of students -- the jocks vs. the wimps, the popular kids vs. the nerds, in addition to the gays vs. the straights. Russel, the book's hero (and narrator), has to come to terms with momentarily discovering what it's like to briefly be part of the popular, athletic clique, or being honest with himself and what he really is. And the book also goes into detail about the pressures high school kids have to go through today, with sex, drugs, grades, and everything else. Think of it as a novelized version of BREAKFAST CLUB for the 2000s, only with gay kids instead of misfits.<br />My only minor criticism is that I felt like there were a lot of subtle details omitted from this good (but short) novel. For example, the adults in the story are practically invisible. We don't know much of the lead character's home life, if he has any brothers or sisters, or what his parents or upbringing is like. We don't know anything about the town he lives in (other than a few sparse clues about a beach house and cold weather). And the final denouement between Russel and his first love left me flat. This is one of the rare novels in which I wish the writer had given us another 100 pages to tell us more... but who knows? Maybe Hartinger will someday be inspired to write a sequel.<br />That having been said, GEOGRAPHY CLUB is a very poignant, well-told story with thoughtful insights into the characters, and dead-on accurate dialogue. I think anybody who's gay, or knows what it's like to be different, will come away from the story with something positive. Recommended with reservations.
0385509456|5.0|_The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time_, is only tangentially a mystery, but primarily the story of an autistic boy, Christopher Boone, told from his own first-person perspective (which does make the book a challenge to read at times).  Christopher lives in Swindon, England, with his father and has a rather complex set of rules by which he lives his life (i.e., if he sees 4 red cars in a row, this means it will be a Good Day, while 4 yellow cars in a row makes it a Black Day).<br />When he discovers a neighbor's dog killed by a garden fork one night, Christopher is a suspect at first, but then he sets out to discover the true culprit, modeling his search after the techniques of Sherlock Holmes.  He does ultimately solve the mystery, which grows to encompass what happened to his mother, who his father has told him died of a heart attack in the hospital.<br /><br />What a great book this was, at turns funny and very sad, sometimes at the same time.  Christopher is an amazingly well-realized character, logical to a fault (the chapters are numbered with prime numbers), yet entirely unable to fathom the most basic emotions in others.  He takes and passes A-level maths and dreams of attending university and becoming a scientist, yet his failure at the most basic of human interactions makes one see how impossible this dream really is.  It's not that often that a book really hits me, but this one left me with a lump in my throat when I was finished.  An amazing first novel.
B000002HHB|1.0|Sorry, Natalie, but you are not the reason the 10,000 Maniacs were good, as evidenced by your sorry solo career.  This CD is more akin to [weak], boring, dull pop than original, TRUE alternative rock of the 10k Maniancs.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Chicago is a brilliant screen adaptation of a great musical!  The 21st century audience is jaded from the great classic happy-go-lucky musicals of old, but this musical embraces the media-savvy, fame seekers that surround us.  It's cynical, but fun.  Visually stunning and stylistically amazing.  I love the old Hollywood style musicals, but I love this too.  It's not trying to be anything it's not.  The songs are performed well, and the trick to shooting them without losing movement of the story works amazingly.  I could rave for this movie all night.  It's simply wonderful and a must-see for every movie fan--whether you enjoy musicals or not.

I have to say that I favor the slow songs (&quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot;) but I still love the songs like &quot;Tourniquet&quot;, &quot;Imaginary&quot;, and &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot;. I probably bought the CD for the same reason most people did - &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; was an istant radio hit, and you can defidently hear why. I recomend you listen to &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; (if by some strange reason you haven't) and decide whether you like this song or not, because half of the other songs are like it.
B000003KLM|3.0|Review of the Presidio starring Sean Connery and Mark Harmon.<br />This is a 2 star story with 5 star actors, so I rated it 3 stars.<br />The strength of this movie could be said to be that the characters played by Connery, the base commander and Harmon an X-MP under Connery and now cop were not very likeable.  The friction and emotional tension between these characters is the heart movie.  The murder mystery takes a back seat.  Another side issue in addition to the murder was the love interest of Connery's daughter, Meg Ryan for Harmon and her friction with her dad.<br />Another friction in the story is that of a military base located near the USA's Saddom and Gamorrah known as San Francisco.  <br />The movie bogs down and drifts as the characters treat each other inordinately poorly, and in a manner not justified by what we know.  If the movie was based on a book that provided that information, it was not shared with the movie viewer.  A good cast is wasted here and this is a 2.5 movie rounded up to 3 for its stars.
B000002UAR|5.0|Its 2003 and I am 15, I got this album when I was like 9 or 10, and it was my first Beatles album, and of the ones I own its my favorite. I am not a hugh Beatles fan, but I will say this is an awesome album!From the start of 'Taxman' to last crazy end of 'Tomorrow Never Knows' this is a great album, and chances are the best Beatles album! I mostly listen to Hard Rock and the Beatles are not that but for some reason I love this album. George Harrison is a really underrated guitar player and it shows on 'Taxmans' solo.I hate Paul, sorry to say but I hate him, any good thing the Beatles ever did came from John or George! The big standouts are 'Love You To' 'She Said She Said' 'And Your Bird Can Sing' 'For No one' and 'Tomorrow Never Knows' I know thats like half the songs but they are really good. The only bad thig about this record is 'Yellow Submarine' I'm sorry but that song blows and so does Ringo, now I know you Beatles fanatics are gonna hate me but come on lets face facks people John and George were the band! So if you only get one Beatles album get this one!
0767802519|5.0|Sure, this could be called an action film, but it's oh so much more than that!<br />The characters of Leon and Matilda draw you into the film and keep you there as the complex relationship between two develops.<br />Gary Oldman plays the perfect bad guy that we love to hate, keeping the tension going in the movie.<br />We also get to see Natalie Portman before Star Wars ruined her career (let's hope she can make a come back) - her acting in this film is dead on superb!<br />This movie makes the viewer part of it on many levels, which makes this a classic in my book!
B0000257O9|5.0|The Buggles have their place in music history because their quirky hit &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; has the distinction of being the first music video shown on MTV.  But their 1980 debut album &quot;Age of Plastic&quot; deserves to be remembered on its own terms; not just for the &quot;futuristic&quot; music, but because the lyrics represent a coherent critique of the world of technology as being full of potential but fraught with peril.  Even a cursory look at &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; shows the song is offering up less than subtle ironies about the medium of pop music, not to mention the fledgling MTV.  The Buggles consisted of the tandem of Geoffrey Downes on percussion/keyboards and Trevor Horn doing bass/guitar/percussion/vocals, both of who were obviously more interested in producing. That same year they produced the Yes album &quot;Drama,&quot; and the pair ended up joining the group and replacing Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman.<br />Pay attention to the lyrics on this album.  &quot;Kid Dynamo&quot; is about the death of imagination in the age of mass media, a proposition that is clearly becoming more and more obvious with each year.  &quot;I Love You Miss Robot&quot; is not kinky, despite its title, and is about the pitfalls of human dependence on technology.  As for the music, it is pretty diverse.  &quot;&quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; is upbeat and peppy while &quot;Johnny on the Monorail&quot; is the exact opposite, dark and brooding.  Of course, at the time the use of electronic devices was considered cutting edge and the novelty of it all distracted from the potency of the lyrics.  The Alan Parsons Project tried to do something along these lines with with 1977's &quot;I Robot,&quot; but that effort seems ponderous and pretentious when compared to &quot;Age of Plastic.&quot;  I think I could make a compelling argument that this is one of the top ten, or at least top two dozen albums, from the decade (and you can go either way on that as the end of the 1970s or the start of the 1980s).er way on that as the end of the 1970s or the start of the 1980s).
0066620996|5.0|One of the most publicized business publications in recent history, this book lives up to the hype surrounding it.  The principles presented by Mr. Collins and his team are not breathtakingly original by any means, but the exhaustive research which went into this book to define these principles creates a powerful argument for Mr. Collins' thesis.  I was very impressed by the simple clarity and universal applicablity of these good-to-great principles, which people from all walks of life should find useful in improving the effectiveness of their organizations.
6305537321|5.0|Audrey Hepburn was at her best when she played Holly Golightly, the darling young woman that lived a somewhat strange life in New York city. 'Breakfast At Tiffany's' is a light-hearted film in which writer Paul Varjak (George Peppard) moves into a New York apartment and becomes friends with Holly Golightly, a woman of such character that he has never seen in any woman before. Paul first meets Holly when he knocks on her door to ask to use the telephone, in which she says yes and points him towards a suitcase on the floor. He asks why she keeps it in there and he gets the answer 'It muffles the sound'! Throughout the film Paul finds out that Holly does some very peculiar things on a regular basis such as visit a man called Sally Tomato in Sing Sing Prison, throw wild parties which are more than often broken up by the police, get $50 every time she goes to the powder room on a date, and much more!  <br />One of the best bits in the film is when Holly and Paul spend the whole day doing things they have never done before. As you can imagine it is hard for Holly to find things that she has never done, but they finally think of things like taking a walk first thing in the morning, going to the public library, and shoplifting from a toy store! <br />'Breakfast At Tiffany's' is an enjoyable film for all the family and will never be out of fashion, thanks to Audrey Hepburn's eternal wit and style, George Peppard's brilliant acting and character, and the fact that there is always some one in the world just like Holly Golightly! This film is and always will be, a classic.

0800141660|5.0|Without a doubt, the best movie adaptation of a Jane Austen novel I have ever seen! I was enraptured by the perfect choice of characters, the breathtaking acting and dramatic scenes, the music (I couldn't rest until I had bought the songs Marianne plays on the piano so that I could play them for myself!) and even the poetry!<BR>All hopeless romantics will fall in love with this film; I watched it twelve times the first week I saw it. Having read the book, I would say that this movie represents one of the few instances where a screenplay outdoes its book. <BR>All the characters have been wonderfully cast, especially Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon, Kate Winslet as Marianne, and Elizabeth Spriggs as Mrs. Jennings. (My personal favorite!)<BR>Be prepared to love this movie!!
B000068PQ0|5.0|\\"The Soft Bulletin\\" was my introduction to The Flaming Lips. So, on first listen \\"Yoshimi....\\" didn't quite do it for me. It doesn't have the sonic sweep and layered, lush feel of \\"Soft...\\" In a sonic sense, it's \\"smaller.\\" But, when I revisited it a few months later it really hooked me. There's an innocence and optimism that is rare in today's jaded musical environment. And yes, Wayne Coyne can sometimes sneak in some fairly childish rhymes, \\"She's gotta be strong to fight them/So she's taking lots of vitamins.\\" But I'll give him a pass on that one since the rest shows him and his mates at a new level of maturity.<br />Although the Robot theme is played out in the first 4 songs, for me it's the closing sequence of \\"It's Summertime/Do You Realize?/All We Have Is Now/Approaching Pavonis Mons By Balloon\\" that really clinched this for me. These songs carry a theme of loss, regret and hope packaged in some of the cleanest, most concise arrangements the Lips have ever done. <br />And as a final thought....if you ever get the chance to see these guys live....run to get your tickets. Saw them in LA two months ago and they are undoubtedly one of the must see live acts today. I guarantee you won't forget it. Where else will you see a large squirrel, a rabbit, Jesus and Santa Claus grooving on-stage to a whacked out tune like \\"Lightning Strikes the Postman.\\"
B00004TRD8|5.0|Starring Arnold Schwarzenagger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, Joe Morton, Earl Boen, and introducing Edward Furlong.<br />In the year of 2029, John Connor has become a rebel. He has tried to protect humans from Skynet, a computer fighting human resistence. Skynet sends a terminator, different from T-800, out to kill a younger John Connor in the 90's. At that same time, John Connor sends a reprogrammed T-800 to protect him. <br />After saving John from T-1000 in the 90's, John and the Terminator go to to free Sarah Connor, John's mother, from a state mental institution. Sarah has been held there for years because of the events of \\"The Terminator\\". When they free her, they go to see Miles Dyson, the leader of Cyberdyne, the same company as Skynet, who has no idea of what it is becoming. All of them go to Cyberdyne and try to destroy it before T-1000 gets ahold of them.<br />Filmed with amazing special effects and an interesting storyline, \\"Terminator 2: Judgement Day\\" scores a pretty high rating in my book. This feature ends up being better than the original. <br />The acting was very good in this film. The acting from Arnold Schwarzenagger, Linda Hamilton, and Robert Patrick was all good, as for Edward Furlong, a fair performance. I didn't expect much from him, after all, this was his pre-\\"American History X\\" performance.<br />The special effects in the film are top-notch. They were very well done and even helped the movie win an Academy Award. <br />\\"Terminator 2: Judgement Day\\" is one of my favorite Action movies ever made. The special edition DVD makes it even more fun to watch, with the picture and sound remastered. You won't be disappointed with the ending, the emotion between The Terminator and John cannot be missed. \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\" which released July 2nd this year, was a good feature, but lacked the heart that \\"T2\\" had.
B00003CXV4|1.0|Could you please tell me how Keanu Reeves hoists a diswasher over his shoulder in a goodie bag (with other items), hauls it up an fire escape and gets it through a window?<br />If your don't care about logic like this, then this is your movie!
B00005JLXE|3.0|3 1/2<BR>In this case the answer is yes. Somehow watching the two documentaries  breathes new life into both the film and the character DareDevil. I gained a new appreciation for this project which I found to be an OK film in theatres but overall a dudd compared to X-Men or Spiderman. I appreciated that it was far more darker and reminded me of the way Spawn was made. A darker hero with more guts and they weren't afraid to show that this story was not gonna end like Peter and Mary Jane. Despite it's many flaws (The use of rock music, it's short 90 minute span, the playground fight scene) it seemed to get better as the movie went on. In the end I enjoyed it enough to buy it. This DVD surprised me because this movie was alot less embarassing on TV then in a theatre. Some really bad lines are now just funny and entertaining where in theatres we all seemed to share the cringe of a badly read line by Mr. Ben \\"Can't Act\\" Affleck. Such as when he tells a villian \\"The light at the end of the tunnel, thats not heaven. It's the C train\\"<br />The casting of Collin Ferrel must have put everyone to shame when he stole the show as the maniacle villian Bullseye. The rest of the performances are enough to fill the cliche of each character but never do they ever break the mold or bring anything new to the table. I loved the shot if ol' horn head on the cross at the beginning (stolen from Spawn btw) and their were many great \\"hero\\" shots. It was deep enough to not be stale or  boring and in the end I think Hollywood could have made a far worse film. I have a soft spot for seeing Comic book characters come to life, even in a flawed film it's still a thrill. I hope we see a sequel and just like X2 it could surpass this movie in every way. <br />The features in this set are so fulfilling those who have doubts should really check it out. Theirs enough to wet any fans appetite and it really gives the movie more of a back bone. If a Directors Cut maybe lay ahead this is the first time I would not mind purchasing the same movie twice.

B00004RYZT|5.0|Out of all the concert dvd's I have this is the second best( NIN's &quot;And All That Could Have Been&quot; taking the crown).  Rammstein's show is once of the most memorable live shows you will ever see. Their use of pyrotechnics is great and meaningful. The concert is full of energy and feels epic. If what you are looking for is a view of what Rammstein is like in concert, or if you just like their music, this dvd is for you.<br />The DVD features 17 songs in concert. German subtitles, multiple camera angles for 3 of the songs (Du Hast, Tier, and Rammstein). It also contains an interview with the band which has english subtitles.
0316096199|5.0|I am full of admiration for Alice Sebold and her ability to find the words to describe her ordeal in such detail. (Alice's pain was so real, I was doubled over during her description of the rape.) The fact that she pursued the prosecution of her rapist and put herself through so much grief in order to gain his conviction is not only awe inspiring, but a public service. (Thank you, Alice!) This is a survival story, but Alice does not glorify herself--she shows her humanity, warts and all. Alice has tremendous talent, and I hope to read many more of her books.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|This movie is surprisingly good as long as you realize that it is not comedy or up-beat. Yes, there is humor but it isn't the focus of the film. It's the story of a self-absorbed man who finds himself &quot;adopted&quot; by the son of a troubled single mom. The man &amp; boy are using each other to further their own plans but come to find a true bond.<br />Hugh Grant does an excellent job of capturing the charming selfishness of his character. Nicholas Hoult is fantastic as the boy trying to save his mother from herself.
0060922583|4.0|<BR>Talbot begins by summarizing the basic theories of renowned physicist David Bohm (the universe is a hologram) and neurophysiologist Karl Pribram (the brain stores memories holographically).  The basic implication of this is that the universe and everything in it (including us) are not seperate &quot;things&quot; but one great, big, multifaceted, interacting thing - and that our current views of nearly everything are entirely wrong because of our basic, underlying misunderstanding thinking of things as seperate entities unrelated to everything else - and our insistence on seeing things as separate things.<br />Once he establishes that, framework, which is firmly based on Bohm's non-local universe theory - then he takes a flying leap and explains how this theory could explain UFOs, ESP, ghosts, near-death experiences, astral projection, stigmata, and any other &quot;supernatural&quot; phenomina.  In that sense he pushes Bohm's theory well beyond the limits that even Bohm would feel comfortable with (if he were still alive).  <br />Nevertheless, his discussions of the various supernatural phenomina and interesting and reasonably well-presented, although you get the impression that &quot;he never met a phenomina he didn't like&quot; - i.e. he's clearly biased and this book isn't going to convert very many skeptics but will provide an interesting scientific tie-in for those who already are sold on the reality of these phenomina.  Plus he makes some good points about the arrogance of some in the sciences who (just as he does) begin with a firm belief in something and then won't consider evidence that goes against those firmly held stances.<br />Good book for those who are open-minded and like pondering the nature of this thing we call reality, for lack of a better word.<BR>

The only thing I learned about people in the third world is they have bad teeth, and it took 2 hours for this movie to tell me that. Dont watch this move, and surely dont buy this movie, cause it doesnt just steal your money it steals 2 hours of your life that would be better spent picking the lint out of your bodily orfices...
B00008BXJF|2.0|I have to immediately voice my respect for the instrumental virtuosity of these guys...the interplay and technique they employ is incredible.<br />However, in my opinion, instrumental prowess and stretching the boundaries of musical style for the sake of instrumental prowess and stretching the boundaries of musical style does not guarantee a good work.  Much like 20th century atonal and serialist music, this music breaks down existing barriers in its closest genre (rock), but what does that fact alone do for me as a listener (especially if I'm not a musician)?<br />I understand that there is some intense harmonic and rhythmic development in the music. And if I wasn't familiar with Thrak, the Projekts, or TCoL, then maybe I would view this music as something extremely profound. However, some of the more recent material has struck me as emotionally devoid and too drawn out (Frying Pan, LTIA4 [minus coda], ...Oyster Soup...). Unfortunately, this void of emotion and lack of memorable melodies/phrases is still very present in TPTB, and I can't escape the fact that I become numb to a lot of it.<br />I know that complex harmonies are employed and interesting sounding material is being produced. This is musically awesome to a point, but an entire album's length of it seems to be a bit too much to enjoy from beginning to end.  This type of rhythmic and harmonic complexity without emphasis on memorable melodies/phrases has been done very successfully in the past (title tracks from Discipline, Thrak, TCoLp1), but part of these successes can be attributed to their inclusion on albums with songs that have a specific focus on memorable melodies/phrases (Frame by Frame, One Time, TCoLp2)?  With songs like these absent (save Eyes Wide Open), the album seems to be more of an experiment as opposed to a benchmark studio album.<br />On a separate note, perhaps it is because of the nature of this new-sounding music, but a lot of this material seems to be a reworking and reappearance ofideas that have been done before.  As stated in other reviews, some of the forms, riffs, interplays, and moods seem very similar to previously recorded songs (most notably TCoL and Thrak).<br />I liked the vocals and lyrics to only one song (Eyes Wide Open). In the case of HWWYHTBHW, I understand the point of the lyrics, and they raise a legitimate point--but do I want to hear them over and over again?  They become less and less effective with each listen.  The post-chorus is good, but I can't say much else positive.  And &quot;Facts of Life&quot; seems like its lyrics could've been set to a vocal melody that would do justice to their content, but instead they just seem goofy.  Goofy isn't too bad, but goofy without enough serious/legitimate vocals for the whole album (save EWO) can tear at the album's worth.  It seems like most of the vocals/lyrics are a mere afterthought (maybe if I couldn't speak English, it wouldn't matter).<br />High points in my opinion are Eyes Wide Open and TPTB II.<br />All in all, I think this album showcases a unique style of music, but does very little to make it significant to the listener.  I think that all of the pieces may be good alone, but together they become a little monotonous.  <br />Final Words: Impressive but not very meaningful.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Anyone put off by the political overtones of the title of Radiohead's \\"Hail to the Thief\\" and its first cut (\\"2 +2 = 5\\") has little to worry about: as on all previous Radiohead albums, any lyrics singer Thom Yorke might preach with are skillfully masked by sound effects, soulful guitar, or screeching bass. In many ways, the album is an upbeat cousin of R.E.M.'s trippy \\"Reveal\\": an interesting mix of guitars and synthesizers that unfortunately makes the album somewhat hit-or-miss. For every \\"Backdrifs\\" that draws you in with its fluttering synthesizer and catchy tune, there's a \\"Sail to the Moon\\" that is pretty but somehow keeps you at arms length. Radiohead are praised as having an original, experimental sound, and that's accurate, but the reason I prefer \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\" to \\"Hail to the Thief\\" is because on those albums they seemed to know the balance between being artsy and being accessible. On  those albums every song is memorable, while on this the only ones that stay with you are \\"2 + 2 = 5\\", \\"Backdrifts\\", \\"There there\\", \\"A Punchup at a Wedding\\", and, most noticably \\"Myxomatosis\\". While that may seem like a lot of good songs, and it is, I personally have come to expect a higher ratio on Radiohead albums.<br />You see, apart from all of his sonic tricks, Thom Yorke has a gift for putting a song in your head and getting it to stay there, even if you don't know what exactly the words are. So my question to you is this: When will Thom Yorke take a vacation from otherworldliness and return to \\"guitar rock\\", even for only one album? It seems he could use a break.
B00005JM09|3.0|Since I haven't seen the previous two &quot;Terminator&quot; films, watching TERMINATOR 3 was like coming into a movie already half over. I'm sure I've missed something. However, ignorance hasn't stopped me before from being rashly opinionated.<br />The gist of the ongoing series is that machines and humans will be at war with each other in the near future, at which time beleaguered Mankind is to be led by John Connor and his wife, the former Kate Brewster. In the &quot;now&quot; of this film, machines are about to launch a nuclear first strike against humanity using America's computerized and newly automated national defense system. The good news is that Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Terminator robot sent back in time to ensure that Connor (Nick Stahl) and Brewster (Claire Danes) survive the coming Armageddon to fight on. The bad news is that a more advanced Terminator robot, the T-X (Kristanna Loken), is sent back by the other side to eliminate the same Connor and Brewster. All the action revolves around the collision between the two hard-nosed androids.<br />At the risk of throwing a wet blanket of logic on the storyline, wouldn't a Nuclear Winter visited upon the planet by vengeful machines also destroy the very technology and industrial infrastructure capable of creating the advanced robots supposed to carry the battle into the future? Never mind; this is a Tinseltown fairy tale.<br />The two best reasons to see TERMINATOR 3 are Arnie, of course, who delivers some straight-faced gag lines that'll leave you chortling, and one of the best vehicle chases I've seen recently. The latter ostensibly takes place in Los Angeles, and, if not accomplished with models and computer generated FX, left me surprised that the city is still standing. Otherwise, the special FX technology used to depict the warring robots is pretty much old hat to those of us getting jaded.<br />The Connor and Brewster characters left me completely cold. As a matter of fact, they were both so annoying that I hoped in the depths of my perverse heart that the T-X would manage to slaughter them both. I mean, do we really need them for a TERMINATOR 4?<br />Loken's T-X might just as well have been a high-tech wind-up doll, though she was impressively poker-faced and relentless in pursuit of her programmed objective. The scene where &quot;she&quot; gets stuck to a giant magnet was inspired. And the one-on-one fight scenes with Arnie were so violent that I thought they'd make the perfect 21st century version of the Bickersons.ing that I hoped in the depths of my perverse heart that the T-X would manage to slaughter them both.

B00005JKZV|4.0|I have read all of the books and agree there are little changes here and there between the books and the movies.  The books have become a basis for the story line and any deviation from the story line can alter what Tolkien's intents were.  (You can see this from all of the prints that had to be done, as the publishers kept making their own changes.)<br />Though where I stand on the art of filmmaking versus the accuracy of the adaptation of the books is a middle road.  The book is a tool for the imagination where as a movie is used to intrigue the audience and to stimulate visually.  It is obvious that the movies are a big hit.  I've seen in the theater - The Two Towers six times and The Lord of the Ring nine times and everytime it is a thrill because you just can't find a story line as brilliant as this or an adaptation as splendid.<br />Most changes were subtle and threw in an interesting twist that was unexpected for anyone who knows the books.  This is nice to watch the unexpected.  I only have one gripe about the changes made and this is the portrayal of Faramir and the relationship established with Frodo.  You do not see the wit and strength that each character has within. Granted in a three hour movie it is hard to portray this idea, but less addition of material would have ment a more accurate account of Tolkien's story.  As I said before, it is not done in poor favor.  <br />However, we are now talking about an adaptation which then becomes Jackson's account of his ideas and his visions from when he read the books.  I admit, I fancy his views and don't think I could have came up with such intricate details.  I had the basics from the book, but he brought it to life and made you love the characters even more so by showing the the emotional involvement, humor, and the personalities of each individual.  The cast also had a hand in this, and is fabulous in their own right using their own ideas of what they thought the characters would do and how they would lookin certain situations.  This is the art of adaptation and splendor of filmmaking.<br />Do not be swayed by the changes that have been made, but accept both the book and the movie for what they are - works of art in which each person takes with them their own interpretations and opinions.  You do not have to feel the same way as I do or as anyone else does. Summing up this review I would say enjoy it for what it is - entertainment and an escape from life as we know it for three hours.     <br />Consider now giving yourself a chance to come up with your own conclusions.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Not since \\"Shindler's List (1993) has such a poignant tale of Holocaust survival been brought to the screen. The team of Roman Polanski (Director) and Ronald Howard (screenplay) have faithfully adapted Wladyslaw Szpilman's touching memoir to produce one of the most realistic human dramas in recent years. Polanski's own recollections of his childhood spent in the Cracow ghetto are added to Howard's screenplay. The result is a brilliant and artistic testimony to the human spirit's will to survive. Adrien Brody plays Szpilman, an accomplished pianist from a well-to-do Jewish family in Warsaw. He is playing over the Polish radio station when the Nazis conquer the city in September 1939. Forcefully moved into the Warsaw Ghetto, Szpilman is spared the fate of his family who are loaded into cattle cars and \\"relocated\\" to the concentration camp at Treblinka. With the help of others, Szpilman escapes the ghetto and goes into hiding. He is hidden by a close knit group of Polish gentiles who risk certain death if they are caught. Szpilman is nearly starved to death while locked in a flat when a shady accomplice sells Szpilman's food ration on the black market. Szpilman watches helplessly from his perch while the Warsaw Ghetto uprising is quelched and the city turned into a smoldering ruin. Forced to live the existence of a rat, burrowing through the gutted city in search of food, Szpilman is saved by Hauptmann (Captain) Wilm Hosenfeld, like Schindler, a good German. Ironically, Szpilman is nearly shot by the Russians at war's end because he is wearing the officer's great coat Hosenfeld had given him to keep warm. The human will to survive in the most horrible circumstances is the film's central theme. The ability to keep one's humanity and moral integrity under such conditions was the true test for Szpilman. It was his love of music, that flowed through his veins when nutrients could not that saved his soul from crumbling like the city walls around him. Besides the horrible atrocities committed by the Nazis, Polanski displays the darker side of non-Germans as well. The Jewish police and Polish Militia, who brutally beat Jews and herded them onto awaiting transports are accurately portrayed. With the exception of one neighbor who tries unsuccessfully to turn Szpilman into the Nazis, all the other Polish gentiles depicted in the film are sympathetic to the Warsaw Jews. Anti-Semitism was equally as rampant a problem in Poland as in the rest of Europe in the first half of the twentieth century. Perhaps Polanski was trying to remain loyal to Szpilman's perspective, but a stronger dose of Polish anti-Semitism would have seemed more believable. On the whole, The Pianist is a wonderful film. The set design and wardrobe are authentic down to the finest detail. Every scene is a gem. The acting job by Brody and supporting cast are superb and the soundtrack hauntingly beautiful. The DVD's behind the scenes extras are a fine tribute to Polanski's artistry. I rented this DVD, now I have to own it.

B00005JL78|5.0|Take a look above and you'll find that a lot of people recommend Blade Runner in addition to this movie.  <br />That's no mistake, and no coincidence.  Okay, while \\"Blade Runner\\" has and most likely always will be the best film adaptation of a Philip K Dick story, \\"Minority Report\\" is a close second.  There's no 4 1/2 stars rating, so I'll give it a 5.  <br />What you get here is a very timely tale given today's society.  While we are no longer afraid of technology in itself (robots destroying humanity is getting a little over-used as a theme) we are afraid of what others will do with that technology.  In a time where insurance companies are selling policies to cover identity theft, what could be more topical than a movie that explores that theme in addition to others?  We have a technologic system that is essentially perfect to the opinion of its supporters, but then we have one supporter (Cruise, as Chief Anderton) who is then the victim of this \\"perfect\\" system.  His dogmatic shift from belief to disbelief is a crisis of faith and while technology seems to pervade this tale spirituality does as well.<br />It's confusing I know.  But the imagery is good, the writting is good, the acting is well done, and the story flows evenly through the two hours.  <br />Get this movie and stare in wonderment at a universe so meticulously created that I still find new things I missed every time I watch it.
0375703861|3.0|The first 200 pages or so of this novel contain the most profound and wittiest prose I've come across. Unfortunately, the second half drags the overall novel down by a few notches.<br />The novel starts off by introducing us to two helpless and unlucky souls who became friends during WWII. It was funny and enjoyable to learn how these two war buddies, Archie and Samad, cope with their lives, jobs, wives, and children. Then the second half begins by switching focus to their children and the children's mentor, a family named the Chalfens. Because little was mentioned about the children and the Chalfens family in the first half, it was very jarring to see the sudden focus on them. To make matters worse, the children and the Chalfens were painted in such a bad light that I really don't care who lives or swims at the end. The passages involving the elderly Hortense (Archie's mother-in-law) and the scientific treatise on genetic engineering fail to interest me at all. Too much insignificant details were thrown in that do not leave me wanting more. I got the feeling that the author wanted more to preach her own beliefs on science rather than to create a more coherent and tightly focused story.
0393057658|3.0|Lewis is a gifted writer who draws attention the great things that Billy Beane has accomplished in Oakland.  This is really the first time that Beane has been given the credit he deserves in the mainstream, and it is long overdue.<br />When discussing Beane's player evaluation techniques, Lewis outlines a field of study known as &quot;sabermetrics.&quot;  For anyone who has not yet been exposed to sabermetrics or has only a passing familiarity with the subject, this will be an eye-opening book and could change the way you view the game of baseball.  Many of the things you thought you knew about baseball will be proven incorrect, and you will be introduced to a number of new concepts that you will undoubtedly use in the future.<br />On the other hand, for anyone who is already quite familiar with sabermetrics (and more specifically, Billy Beane), you will not get much out of this book.  Chapters 2, 5, and 9 will be informative, but the rest is either filler or a review of concepts you already know.  You won't regret reading the book, but it may not be a particularly memorable one for you (it wasn't for me, hence the three stars).  For people in this situation, it would be fine to wait for the book to come out in paperback and save a few bucks.<br />Overall, I would recommend reading Moneyball, but don't set your expectations too high if you're already familiar with the subject matter.

0767817648|5.0|I saw this movie four years after it came out and it continues to be one of my favorites. Not only do you have great action, but what a cast; Roy Scheider from Jaws as the hero who trys to outrun his watch,Malcom Mcdowell from Clockwork Orange as evil as ever, and you can't forget Daniel Stern as JAFO. One of the best climaxes i have ever seen where Scheider hijacks Blue Thunder fighting police choppers, fighter jets and Mcdowell in an awesome looking camouflage chopper. The best aerial action movies definitely came out the 1980's.... this is one of the best.

6301930827|4.0|The primary reason I enjoyed this movie is not the fact that I was in the USAF during the Cold War era and imagined this type of action coming about, but primarily because Powers Boothe and I were classmates at Southwest Texas State University in 1969-70 and I really appreciate his style of acting. We were in a couple of college productions together and I am a fan of anything he does.
B000099T2L|5.0|I must admit I WAS WRONG. DEAD WRONG!!!! I first wrote a review stating my disappointment in this album. But the more I listened to it I had a major change of heart.  I won't be able to play it while my daughter is home but I think it was intended for mature audiences only. I wouldn't recommend allowing your child to hear it but it could actually cause alot of fire in the bedroom thus probably saving alot of marriages.  I think this album is perfect for my husband and I to enjoy together.  I can be anything to him with this album, while my daughter is asleep.
B000092Q4U|5.0|After releasing one of the most exciting and powerful underground metal albums of the year 2000, Lamb of God finally return in triumphant fashion with the mighty follow up to their classic debut, New American Gospel. And the wait was well worth it.<br />Where as the debut combined a deadly headbanging groove with elements of American death, grind and thrash, As the Palaces Burn adds a dose of Swedish inspired melodic death with a large dollop of thrash to accompany the thick southern groove. The songwriting remains top notch while the musicianship, particularly from guitarists Mark Morton and Will Adler, is outstanding, the riffs pushed to the front of the mix and delivered with a old school thrash inspired technical flair and driven home by the crushing production provided by metal genius Devin Townsend. Drumming king Chris Adler is again in brilliant form while Randy Blythe's vocals once again tower above the mix with his new found ability to enunciate his passionate and intelligent lyrics.<br />As the palaces Burn is without a doubt one the most important modern metal albums released in recent years, as with its predecessor, As the palces Burn is a metallic masterpiece and Lamb of God is one of American metal's finest bands.<br />Highlights include: As the Palaces Burn, 11th Hour, In Defense of Our Good Name, Devil in God's Country, Blood Junkie and Vigil. But the bottom line is: As the Palaces Burn smokes from start to finish. You need this.
1878424319|1.0|Looks like all grandparents have good advise.  Do I need a Toltec grandmother? Or grandfather? I don't think so. Is the socialization process in early life harmful? Perhaps. Would it be more harmful if there was no education?  What do you think?<br />Did my German grandmother want me to watch what I say? Of course: &quot;Always be truthful,&quot; she said, &quot;lies have short legs.&quot; Not bad for a German grandmother! Should I take it personal if I get critized? That depends. This author will not take it personally that his book rambles on with repeat simple truths glamorized as &quot;Toltec ancient wisdom&quot;. The writing in this book is kindergarten-style, all that's missing is some stick-figure art.
B00005R2M3|5.0|What can I say?  It's been nearly two years since I first bought this album (since then I've also bought the extended 'Washed and Dried' version) and I am still listening to it every so often, along with the superlative 'Donde estan los ladrones' and 'Pies Descalzos.'  For me, it was Shakira who ushered in the Latin music explosion, not that former Menudo singer who's no longer living 'la vida loca' (or the guy in the video with Anna Kournikova for that matter).  Owing to Shakira, I found myself watching the Latin Grammys and listening to other hot Latin acts like Juanes, Paulina Rubio, Thalia, Mana and Fey.  Her live performance at Staples Center last November was nothing short of spectacular, and any singer who's bold enough (not to mention confident enough in her vocal abilities) to cover AC/DC's heavy metal anthem 'Back in Black' and Aerosmith's 'Dude' (aka 'Looks like a lady') has my utmost respect.  Shakira's currently hard at work (she's a certified workaholic) on her next album, release date probably summer 2004.  Although I can hardly wait, I must constantly remind myself that all good things are worth the waiting for.
0553106635|5.0|This book is my favorite book of all time.  And yes it is way better than anything Tolkien ever wrote. While it is true that Tolkien was the founding father of good epic fantasy, he still pales in comparison to the genius of this series.  Saying that Tolkien is better is like saying that the lightbulb is a more complex invention than the personal computer simply because it was created first.  All things must evolve and this is the best that the evolution of fantasy has to offer.<br />One of my favorite parts of this book was deffinatly the last few chapters.  The sudden betrayal and the cliffhanger ending made me frustated that the next book wasn't out yet but that's the way I expect to feel after a good book.<br />A side note that I would like to add is that this series is not for you if you don't like it when bad things happen to charectors you love(to the point that it makes you want to stop reading the book).  I myself don't like to have my favorite charectors die but I think that it adds to the realism of the book.  (I happen to also be a fan of a good sad story, so if you only want happy endings then read something else)
0316666343|3.0|The begining is written excellently.  You find yourself feeling the pain of the Salmon family as Susie watches from above.  However, there was too much drifting with Susie's memories.  At some points I couldn't tell where they were at (by time).  It is an easy and quick read, and most likely will bring tears to your eyes.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Having been lucky enough to see most of the series on TV in the UK, I can only wonder at why it would be cancelled.  Clearly a superior product, and seemed like it was just getting into its stride when it was chopped.  Joss must be gutted - as are we - and I can only hope another network picks it up.<br />If not, the DVD will serve as a suitable monument.  It doesn't get any better than this.
0156027321|4.0|I found the book interesing and engaging and even funny at times.  However, it is not a book that should be read by anyone under the age of 17.  I found the descriptions of canibalism and murder unsettling.  It was a bit too bloody at times for my taste.  Although this book may seem like a book that could be read by teenagers, I feel that parents and educators should be aware of the contents.
B000089RVX|5.0|This album is incredible.  I just got it for the one song &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;  but the entire thing is good.  If your looking fro something new, this is it.<br />'
6301161572|4.0|This is a &quot;movie opera&quot;, and I am not a fan of them, because I find some of the passion is filtered out when the singing is separated from the acting, and though this film is well done, it has a lot of that &quot;lip-synch&quot; look, which dims the dramatic impact. I would rather watch a filmed live performance, with less gloss, and more feeling.<br />The lavish production is stunning to look at, with great art direction (by Alexandre Tauner) and cinematography (by Gerry Fischer), a very attractive cast, and of course, Mozart's score, which I think is his most sublime masterpiece.<br />The singers are excellent: Kiri Te Kanawa as Donna Elvira, and Edda Moser as Donna Anna really shine above all, both so lovely and graceful, and vocally wonderful. Moser especially manages to be emotionally expressive. Ruggero Raimondi is a fine Don Giovanni, Jose Van Dam a rather elegent Leporello, with John Macurdy as Il Commendatore, Kenneth Riegel as Ottavio, Teresa Berganza as Zerlina, and Malcolm King as Masetto rounding out the cast well.<br />The sound: The volume fluctuates depending on where the singer is placed in the scene, fading out as they walk away for instance, which is dramatically appropriate, but a musical disaster. There is a quartet that is bizarre in its balance, since two of the singers are in the background. Lorin Maazel conducts the Paris Opera, which in this, and other recordings I have heard, does not have the richest and fullest sound in the world, and may be adding to the problems.<br />The Don's demise however, starting with the Commendatore's &quot;Don Giovanni a cenar teco&quot; is marvelous, and despite the camera inexplicably lingering on the servant boy instead of the action at times, it is a riveting scene, with some of the most superb music ever written.<br />Though well worth viewing, I would put this film into the &quot;rent not buy&quot; category, unless one is an inveterate opera collector.
B000096H33|3.0|Despite being Oldfield's most famous work, Tubular Bells is not my favorite of his works; that distinction goes to a tie between Ommadawn and Five Miles Out. <br />This newly performed version of his first and best-known work is as good as the original, and even better in spots. It's a bit of a shame that he had to go back to The Beginning to produce something that I really enjoyed, though. (Tres Luna, his most recent all-new work, bored me.)<br />All-in-all, the melody lines are more distinct in this version, there is more energy in virtually every track, and the Caveman section is even odder than in the original. Even the portions of the original Tubular Bells which felt like they went on just a bit too long for what they were doing musically have been spruced up here and are working far more effectively (the sections titled &quot;A Minor Tune&quot; and &quot;Peace&quot; on this CD being the ones that are most improved in my opinion). John Cleese brings a touch of humor to the &quot;introducing the instruments section,&quot; as opposed to the more straight up master of ceremonies approach in the original and in Tubular Bells II. Everything about this CD works, and it's well-worth getting for Oldfield fans or lovers of the original Tubular Bell album.<br />So, why only Three Stars after that rave review? Well, the DVD is a total waste of plastic and money. The video is unimpressive--I could probably have produced it on my Mac, given stock footage and a few days. I can't comment on the Surround Sound mixes, as I don't have a TV set that fancy. Since the &quot;bonus&quot; DVD ups the price, I need to take off stars in relation to its value. And it drags the package down.

0316234753|5.0|As a kid, I loved to draw, and I loved this book!  The author provides simple, step-by-step pictorial guidelines easy enough for young children to follow:  if they can read the instructions, they can draw the animals in the book.  At each step, there is a basic instruction such as  \\"make a green triangle\\" or \\"add two squiggly lines.\\"  The instructions are accompanied by both a drawing of whatever it is to be added and a drawing of the animal-in-progress as a whole.  Not only is this book fun for children, it's great for book reports and other school projects.  Even adults will appreciate the ease at which this book helps them to produce realistic-looking animals while also enjoying the author's humorous style.  This favorite book of childhood has become a cherished adult possession.
B000089RVX|1.0|This CD is horribly marred by the guy's rapping in the background of the single \\"Bring Me to Life\\". How anyone could take such a beautiful song and absolutely ruin it is beyond me. When listening, I become enraged when I hear this jerk in the background. Avoid at all costs.
630245333X|4.0|Perhaps I only love this movie because I happen to find THE BLOB to be the creepiest of all mosters. Shapeless.... deadly.. consuming all in its path. CREEPY!<br />Just look at the cover to see the kind of carnage you will be seeing in this film. The acting is more than passable for this type of movie, and the comedy is all intentional and kept to a minimum. <br />Russel clearly understands why the blob is so frightening a villain, and he exploits that in gruesome, wrenching horror scenes were characters are entangled and being digested inside of it. The scares are all real and visual based. They arent cheap jump-out-and-go-boo scares, but legitimate, visceral thrills. The music isn't brash shrieking notes just to jolt you, but subdued and suspenseful.<br />Unless you don't find anything in horror movies frightening, this is a horror movie you SHOULD SEE. I'm only 17 so I have no nostalgic attatchments to the lame original. <br />For a MONSTER movie that is frightening, not cheap, thrilling, and visceral, THE BLOB is THE movie to get
B00005JKOI|5.0|Okay, this is my favorite movie of all time, so maybe I'm a little biased, but its a wonderful film with some wonderful performances by a trio of the best 80s young stars. I won't say teen stars cause Andrew McCarthy and Jon Cryer were in their 20s, but Molly Ringwald was actually 18 at filming. This movie takes what could have been a somewhat formulaic plot; girl from wrong side of the tracks and rich boy with stupid yuppie friends fall in love...and makes the most of it, adding incredible characterizations to bring the story to life. Biggest props to Jon Cryer (Who, by the way, is NOT the poor mans Matthew Broderick!) who gives the most heart-wrenching performance.  By the end of the movie, everyone I know is digging Duckie.  Molly Ringwald, always a pleasure, is at her absolute best in this film.  I'm not normally a fan of Andrew McCarthy, but he's perfect in this film as the dreamy rich boy.  Watch for Andrew Dice Clay, James Spader, Annie Potts, and Gina Gershon.  Kickin' soundtrack, and personally I cry every time I see this film. Its seriously awesome, and a modern classic.
B0000A14WB|3.0|What a disappointment is the new DVD-Audio version of this classic.  I had been looking forward to it for sometime, only to find that it's not much of an improvement over the much cheaper 1996 CD release (which includes both the original mono and new stereo mixes of all tracks).  Sadly, I  must recommend sticking with the CD...

B00005RY7X|4.0|Say what you will about Andrew W.K., but the man knows how to rock and knows how to party.  There is nothing original on &quot;I Get Wet&quot;'s twelve cuts; but that's not such a problem considering that this is mindless back to the basics hard rock that older headbangers can't help but headbang to.  Mixing simple chord progrssion, bubblegum pop-esque melodies, and lyrics based soley around the idea of drinking heavily and partying (and having a good time doing it), &quot;I Get Wet&quot; is a surprisingly solid album from an artist who, unlike most of his modern rock peers, knows not to take himself seriously and just have fun with it.  Standout tracks include &quot;It's Time to Party&quot;, &quot;Party Hard&quot;, &quot;Take it Off&quot;, &quot;She is Beautiful&quot;, and &quot;Don't Stop Living in the Red&quot;; and while the album may get a bit repetitive throughout the first half, &quot;I Get Wet&quot; is still a lot of fun.  Older headbangers may be leary, but give it a try and you'll be pleasently surprised.

0385504209|1.0|Every now and then I buy a book on the spur of the moment without looking up the usual reviewers or even flipping through a few pages.  I almost always get burned doing this, and this purchase was no exception.  A massive (and misleading) marketing campaign and relentless self-promotion are the only explanations for this book's success.  Cloddishly plotted and populated with moronic caricatures instead of characters, this waste of paper routinely mixes spurious 'facts' with idiotic conspiracy theories while racing breathlessly--and with breathtaking dullness, not an easy task--to a senseless and contradictory conclusion.  At first I was astounded that anyone could actually recommend this garbage, then I realized that movies like 'Dumb and Dumber' draw large crowds.<br />There really should be a 'zero star' rating available for this kind of puerile nonsense.
B00005NNMK|5.0|OK, having lived in the 1980's, this shouldn't come as a big surprise, but despite how this genre of music and style of musicians has been dismissed as kitsch and cheese, I'll come straight out with it:  I like hair bands.  There, I've said it, and one of the groups that may have served as the classic case was Europe, hailing from Stockholm.<br />I could not get enough of the title track, which had hit #1 in the UK.  The booming bass synthesizer, then the majestic (some might call it bombastic), brass-like synths kicking in, then a voice counting down to 0, before the drums join the anthem-like synths, taking full control.  I was slowly dipping my toe in metal at this point and was totally able to handle this, what was derisively called hard metal, or even pop metal.  Anyway, the apocalyptic song about leaving Earth because &quot;there is no one to blame&quot; reflects an Earth scorched by WW3.  John Norum's blistering guitar solo is also a highlight.<br />The pounding &quot;Rock The Night&quot; has a beat like some of Survivor's anthems, although its awash with guitars chugging and squealing over the place.  The opening lyrics &quot;I've gone through changes/I've gone through pain/.../I'm in a rage up from my head down to my toes&quot; reflected the way I felt then, and I must confess, right now.  That John Norum could play!<br />Yes, Europe did power ballads as well, and I'm torn between the title track and the strained-relationship song &quot;Carrie&quot; as my favorite number here.  I'm reminded of other emotional power ballads such as those by Heart and Damn Yankees' &quot;High Enough&quot; for the potency this has.  Apart from Joey Tempest's vocals, the rest of the group engage in some Queen-type harmonies.<br />Another &quot;bombastic&quot; keyboard opening, followed by strong Norum guitar work on &quot;Danger On The Track&quot;.  The song mirrors a Western story of a man, possibly an outlaw, leaving for the mountains, promising to return to his girl, only to be harassed my other men along the way.  A very engaging number.<br />The pace continues briskly with &quot;Ninja&quot;, taking the action to Japan, where Joey wants to learn the stories and legends, the battles, dreaming of being the title figure.<br />With &quot;Cherokee&quot;, detailing the forced relocation, i.e. Trail of Tears, they seem to be taking a page from Iron Maiden's book on social-consciousness of Native Americans, i.e. &quot;Run Through The Hills.&quot;  &quot;So much to bear/all that pain/left them in despair/they lost their faith/and now they had to learn/there was no place to return.&quot;  While I really admire this song, they could've put more oomph and anger into this to make it into more a powerhouse.<br />The archetypal wanderer returning home is the subject of the power ballad &quot;Time Has Come&quot;:  &quot;Pray for the soldier, who's wounded bad/Pray for the dreamer, he's still so sad.&quot;  Pray for the dreamer... oh, that's me!<br />&quot;Heart Of Stone&quot; is a mid-paced number.  &quot;On The Loose&quot; boasts snarling guitar opening with thundering drums, a good song to play on the highway.  The subject here mirrors me:  &quot;He lives from day to day/looking for something to do/he needs to get away/hoping that maybe one day/He could be someone/praying that maybe someday/he could be number one.&quot;<br />&quot;Love Chaser&quot; has a sound kind of mirroring Maiden's &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner.&quot;  And the three live bonus tracks enhance this album.<br />In answering how heavy or hard Europe is compared to others in the hard-metal genre such as Poison, Winger, Warrant, or Whitesnake, it$B!G(Bs difficult, all because of differing rhythms and guitar work, but they are more polished than say, Bon Jovi or Winger, due to their heavy keyboard-work, which made them unique.<br />Kevin Elson, who produced Journey's Escape, did his magic on this one, making it harder-edged than Wings Of Tomorrow.

B00000272N|5.0|I'll lead off by saying I'm still hit hard by the tragic and untimely death of Alice In Chains vocalist Layne Staley. <BR>In case you're playing catch-up, in April 2002, his body was found dead in his apartment, apparently from a heroin overdose. Some have said \\"His death is more stupid than tragic\\". But I must completely disagree, unlike many I have a human side to me, which shows mourn. Also he was hooked on a substance that is very addictive. I point to the many other casualties as a testament to this. Most of the blamers wouldn't know how being strung out feels if their life depended on it, so how dare they try and weigh in with credibility. R.I.P Layne, we still miss you, you'll never be forgotten. <br />Before Starbucks, Microsoft and Grunge, the region of Seattle, Washington housed many Quality Rock acts, among one of them was Queensryche. While that band achieved their first taste of success, another local band was doing the rounds, Alice In Chains. <br />I've seen older pictures of the band, and it's clear their origins were in Glam-Metal (Which, as a fan of that genre, is fine by me.) In 1990 an E.P of the band impressed many Record Executives and made them sought after, hot property. <BR>The EP included the song \\"We die Young\\". After signing with CBS/Sony Columbia records, they quickly headed back in to the studio to record more tracks for their full-fledged debut. I'm of the impression that what transpired during those sessions were magic. <br />Never again would Layne Staley sing with this much power and emotion, and the band's playing in such an energetic manner that remains unmatched. Consider this: On \\"Facelift\\" they churned out blistering metal, On later efforts like \\"Dirt\\" the band adopted a more sludgy sound to fit in with the Alternative scene, you could argue they hopped on the trendy bandwagon. <br />All the time I get into arguments with friends over which Alice album reigns supreme, they of course say \\"Dirt\\". I think two things: A.They've never listened to Facelift in it's entirety. And B.They've simply been brainwashed by MTV. <br />The album cover is a personal favorite, The face of a headbanger slightly morphed, and vibrantly colored. <BR>The liner notes fold out in uncoventional fashion, and there's lyrics, info on who wrote what lyrics and music, plus a plethora of thank-you's. They really put effort into it. <br />The album opens with the afforementioned \\"We Die Young\\", which boasts a distorted crunch, crank it up and you'll hear what I mean - HELL YEAH! The thoughtful lyrics explin the Rough life of living in the 'hood. <br />When debating why I believe \\"Facelift\\" is this band's best album I use the Next track \\"Man in the Box\\" to anchor my argument. It's their most well-known known song, no question. The tempo has a semi-plod to it, and guitarist Jerry Cantrell chimes in on the background vocals, and for the solo he cuts loose. \\"Sea of Sorrow\\" gets off to a Southern-fried boogie start with a piano, and proceeds to rock relentlessly, the chorus is catchy. The use of toms by Drummer Sean Kinney is noteworthy. <br />A fluid riff backs the verses of \\"Bleed the Freak\\" followed by a great high-pitched solo. \\"I can't remember\\" is built around a twin section of acoustic and electric guitars, and Layne Staley's vocals go from, laid-back to yelling, showcasing how verstaile he was. Michael Starr plays a good bass line on \\"Love Hate Love\\". The opening lick is similar to it's preceding song, but it's different as well, because it's much creepier. The mainframe moves along at a crawling baby's pace, and the chorus is totally engaging. <br />On \\"It ain't like that\\" Jerry Cantrell plays a nice effect that doesn't lets up 'til the song ends. Want Vocal Harmonies in the vein of \\"Rooster\\"? You got 'em, take one listen to \\"Sunshine\\". There's a tough-sounding build up to the chorus, which is \\"happy sounding\\" by Alice In Chains standards, And \\"Put You Down\\" has a superb groove. A moody, atmospheric trip lies in \\"Confusion\\", Michael Starr sings the backing vocals, and I've always thought he was a better, more skilled bassist than his replacement Mike Inez. <br />\\"I know somethin About You\\" has a funk feel to it, and closer \\"Real Thing\\" boasts hair-metal attitude, the lyrics are about what else? Heroin but it's likable nonetheless.<br />This album is a masterpiece through and through, one of the best debuts ever. And most Twelve track albums have a dud track or two, but none here, which is a rarity. I've always wondered why do the masses prefer follow-up albums? You can't call yourself an Alice In Chains fan and not own a copy of \\"Facelift\\". Newcomers be told it's a great deal heavier than \\"Dirt\\" and \\"Tripod\\".
B00004X01U|4.0|This is a very Nice album! Not too many big hits, but the album is very consistent and there are no annoying songs. Recommended!
B00004XONN|5.0|From the opening notes of the masterful Everything In Its Right Place to the florid coda, Motion Picture Soundtrack, Kid A soars through bizarre channels of sound and emits radiant colors in a brilliant, electronic/guitar driven symphony. As expectations couldn't be higher for a band after releasing their 97' opus, O.K. Computer, Radiohead came back with an equally bewitching album, chalk full of beauty, defeat, hope, pathos and dissonance. Most people consider this release the little brother to Radiohead's release a short term later, Amnesiac. But if anything, I think Kid A is Amnesiac's father, progenating the sounds of twisted electronics and caterwauling guitars for Amnesiac to further explore and expand on. The tracks that stand out the most are the cacophonous National Anthem, the Bendsy guitar beauty, Optimistic, and the bleak Morning Bell. I recommend this cd to everyone.
0312305060|5.0|After watching the movie, I enjoyed it so much that I had to read the book.  I was not disappointed at all.  Both the movie and the book are wonderful (of course with a few changes in the movie).  I thought that Michael Cunningham did a great job of weaving the 3 stories together; it flowed nicely and wasn't confusing at all.  Highly recommended!
B00005LK94|5.0|Everyone deals with loss in their own way.  13 year old Amy Alden (Anna Paquin) deals with her loss by becoming what she has lost.<BR>     After losing her mother in a car crash, she goes to live with her father (Jeff Daniels) in Ontario, Canada.  When developers orphan a nest of goose eggs, she takes them in and hatches them.  <BR>     All geese will identify the first living thing they see as their mother, in this case, Amy.  They follow her everywhere she goes, and imitate her.  When a wildlife protection ranger tells her that she must clip their wings because they cannot fly south without their parents to guide them, she decides to take on the monumental task of raising them and teaching them to migrate south.<BR>     But that's only half the story.  It is also about Amy's growth as a person after overcoming huge loss, and how the bonds of love can heal all things.<br />     So few films these days are memorable for anything other than their FX, but this heartwarming film is memorable for its story and its powerful delivery.<BR>     Anna Paquin plays Amy Alden with such force and emotion that it is sometimes hard to believe that one is watching a movie, and Jeff Daniels compliments her performance perfectly.<BR>     Beautifully orchestrated and filmed, it is sure to appeal to anyone who sees it, from the very young to the very old, from the emotional and sensitive to the most cold-hearted and insensitive.<br />     I saw this film when it first came out, and have seen it at least 20 times since, and it still gives me shivers up and down my spine every time I see it.  It is truly worth the price of the DVD-- this is one movie you'll want in your collection for years to come.
6305181772|3.0|Mission Impossible is a mindless, extremely silly adventure that makes for great entertainment. I lost track of the plot after a while, but it didn't seem to matter. The movie survives by moving from one set-piece to the next and triumphs because De Palma keeps the tongue firmly in the cheek at all times.<br />The finale is ridiculously far-fetched, but when at the height of its silliness Lalo Schifrin's original Mission Impossible theme kicks in, the film's self-parodying nature becomes suddenly becomes abundantly clear. Best of all, De Palma achieves this comedic edge without losing any of the suspense or drama.<br />No classic, but it works great on its own terms.
B000035P80|4.0|Of course I love Bob Dylan and I have most of his albums and I've even met him. His talent is limitless and far beyond everyone else's. He is as dynamic today as he ever was and his every song stands on its own merit. But, this video was shot such a long time ago -the 60s. It's arty and well-done and it's certainly an important historical piece. If you're a big fan you'll enjoy it but it's not the type of movie most people wold watch again. It's slow moving and can't compare to the type of documentary we are used to nowadays. Worst part is that there are no complete songs. The interviews and songs are cut up and mixed. I feel that one can't have Dylan explained to you - you have to open yourself to Bob Dylan and just feel the song as best as you can. Everyone will feel it differently. That is the mastery of his gift.
B00006690G|5.0|Ok there's alotta eminem haters out there but hear me out before you bash this album. Eminem is one of the most influential rappers of our time. The main thing that sparks the contoversy is that he's white but if he were black or asian or indian or whatever he'd still be controversial. He feeds off the controversy from critics, politiciansa, anyone. Famous or infamous his music is still phenominal. Take one listen to \\"Sing for the Moment\\" and try and tell me that's not music i don't care if you like pop hip-hop or rock or whatever but that's music so live with it.
6302732786|5.0|I was born in 1951 and this is not my kind of music but I've enjoyed the VHS version of this concert again and again for many years now. In this video, the fans are the stars - the crowd is wonderful -10s of thousands of happy-as-can-be fans and all entertainers are at their peak and prime - there's no oldies here! This is real rock and roll; turn up the volume! All the performances are excellent, its a beautiful summer day, the sound and technical aspects are perfect - and it's almost 3 hours long! This is definitely one of the finest concert videos of all times!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This soundtrack brings to life the movie in the comfort of your own home.  Turn up the volume and enjoy, Klaus Badelt has created a masterpiece that could possibly rival Hans Zimmer's Crimson Tide theme and John Williams' Jurassic Park theme!  Thumbs up all the way around.  If you want to get a good soundtrack this year, this is the one to get.  Nothing but good music here, with a theme that will uplift you and make you feel like swashbuckling a few pirates of your own!

B000002HPT|4.0|Falling into Infinity is often regarded as Dream Theater's worst album, but I really disagree with that sentiment.  While I don't feel it is up to par with the almighty Images and Words or the near perfect Scenes from a Memory, I personally enjoy FII a whole lot.<br />In the face of extreme pressure from record execs to yield a successful, radio accessible album, DT did an outstanding job maintaining their prog roots while crafting a highly melodic album.  <br />Highlights on this album include New Milennium in which Myung debuts his Chapman Stick skills, Lines in the Sand featuring amazing keyboard work and awesome guest vocals from King's X frontman/bassist Doug Pinnick, and the obligatory epic album closer, Trial of Tears, which features an incredibly moody solo section and brilliant lyrics from the band's &quot;Silent Man&quot; John Myung.<br />A note about Derek Sherinian on his first full length performance with DT (Derek also appears on the Change of Seasons EP and the double live Once in a LIVEtime).  Many fans/critics disliked his style.  I totally disagree.  I feel that he is the most soulful of the 3 DT keyboardists and brought an amazing amount of stage presence to the band that I feel they still lack.  Sherinian was not afraid to experiment with different sounds on FII.  Anyone who still feels he is not that talented, go and check out his amazing Planet X discs!  They are absolutely brilliant
B0000029AP|5.0|After releasing two moderate selling albums, Aerosmith proved that the third time will be a charm and it did with their breakthrough classic Toys in the Attic which would sell over 6 million copies in the U.S. and score their first major hit 'Sweet Emotion'.<BR>The album begins with the pounding title track and it would become a live staple, Uncle Salty is another underrated classic, although it isn't nearly as heavy as its predecessor, it is a great song with a sing along chorus, Adam's Apple is a mid paced rocker with an excellent guitar solo and although the studio version is a great song, the live version on Pandora's Box is a killer, next up is one of Aerosmith's signature songs with 'Walk This Way' which would become a Top 10 hit and it still gets heavy classic rock airplay and another interesting note is they got the title from 'Young Frankenstein'.<BR>'Big 10'' Record' is a great song although it could've been longer, this song was a remake from like 1936, next up is another one of their signature songs called 'Sweet Emotion' which was about Steven Tyler's negative feelings about Joe Perry's soon to be wife Elissa which she is a major witch and she's the kind of person that you wouldn't like, but anyway it became Aerosmith's first breakthrough hit, 'No More No More' has great lyrics about fortune and fame and about being big, 'Round and Round' is one of Aerosmith's most creepiest songs from the 1970's and it was Brad Whitford's first song that he came up with, 'You See Me Crying' is the band's ballad and it seems like that Aerosmith would close an album with a ballad and Steven does a great job singing it.<br />If you gotta have just one Aerosmith album, don't get Greatest Hits, instead get this album cause it rocks.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|In the music industry, every so often, a talent comes along that is hard to define-they transcend genres quite often, or meld a core of styles to create something that is fresh, and entertaining, often creating a bar-something new, and inspirational for others to follw!!!  Gavin DeGraw is no exception!!!  This young man is very skillful with the piano-his arrangements are beautifully written-this is professional-hit-man-for-hire ladies, and gentlemen!!!  Gavin intrically blazes through the opening &quot;FOLLOW THROUGH&quot;-and by the time you get to &quot;JUST FRIENDS&quot;, you'll realize that this young talent debut on J Records, is sreaming radio potential to the fullest.  Clive Davis, CEO of J Records, (which roster includes Grammy award-winning Alicia Keys, Luther Vandross, Busta Rhymes, Tyrese, etc.,) has a very impressive track record with signing artists, that are true to themselves, and that already has a presence about them that oozes maturity well-above their peers, thus J Records is still winning with Gavin, continuing the torch of hit records after hit records to come!!!
B00009TB5G|1.0|Looking for a good movie to watch? Look else-where. Having trouble sleeping? Well, you've come to the right place. This movie is responsible for the second time I ever fell asleep at a movie theatre. Still can't believe I paid 8 bucks nap.
B00006JDVV|4.0|Bah! Dispite it's flaws, it wasn't THAT bad.  I have a thing for watching sci-fi/fantasy concept movies no matter how bad they look like they're going to be (and are). So I've seen plenty of absolutely terrible, mediocre, poorly executed, or ludicrous movies (which is the norm sadly) and this one is no-where near that.  The creators took a big risk making this movie which is more akin to a graphic novel comic book and did an adequate job setting the mood. True, good special effects alone can't save a movie but in this case I'll say that the fun concept might be broken without what I consider THE best rendered and animated dragon I've seen on film.  The Amazon.com editorial was right on.
0385504209|1.0|The Da Vinci Code was an absolute disappointment. The characters are undeveloped. The plot is predictable. The writing is uneven. The best part is the historical detail. But even that is many times inaccurate and twisted to fit the plot.<br />Save your money and buy &quot;The # 1 Ladies Detective Agency&quot; instead.
B00005A46T|3.0|Though this CD was much anticipated I was quite let down. At first it seemed like a good buy but soon after a few concentrated listenings it became redundant. Self-titled boasted a better display of talent and was a lot more fast-paced and energetic. This album seemed toned down and more focused on being bad then creating fast-paced high-energy music.
B000002H2H|5.0|The 1980s saw the rise of a seemingly endless horde of heavy metal bands who sought to immortalize themselves in the pages of music history.  Only a few succeeded, and Metallica is one of them - and RIDE THE LIGHTNING, their second full-length release, is the main reason for it.  For metalheads who were frustrated with bands who just weren't &quot;heavy&quot; enough, RIDE THE LIGHTNING brought unexpected and harsh release with music that even today is terrifyingly beautiful.<br />The thing about RIDE THE LIGHTNING is that while it kept up the intensity almost all the way through, it never got boring.  Hearing the anthemic CREEPING DEATH on the radio pushed me into the store to buy my first copy on cassette, but the rest of the compilation ensured that I was hooked for life.  FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE satisfied the need for speed with a blistering tempo that today's speedcore techno enthusiasts can appreciate.  FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS demonstrated that Metallica could be just as heavy with a slower pace and a tad more discipline.  The title track, of course, gave guitarists James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett plenty of opportunity to cut loose with a barrage of sound reimiscent of some thundering horde plowing through the battlefield at ungodly speed, ready to...well, you get the idea.<br />I hear people debating, &quot;Which was better - MASTER OF PUPPETS or RIDE THE LIGHTNING?&quot;  PUPPETS arguable demonstrated more latitude in style and is still a terrific album, but I'll wager that if it weren't for LIGHTNING, there never would have been a PUPPETS.  This compilation is the catalyst, the Rosetta stone.  Buy it if you haven't already!

B00005OAIE|2.0|OK, who exactly died and made John Mayer THE GREATEST SINGER-SONGWRITER EVER!?!?!?  Honestly, the only people I know that listen to this are people who like to pretened they're getting in touch with their \\"inner self\\" and like to pretend they're listening to \\"grown up\\" music.  Look, I'm 15, and I have my guilty pleasure bands, but seriously, this guy's probably laughing hysterically when he writes his lyrics, it's a total joke.  Plus (for you people of lesser intelligence out there), HE SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE DAVE MATTHEWS!!!!  I'm not a real big DMB fan to begin with, BUT WHEN YOU'RE A FREAKING CARBON COPY OF HIS VOICE you have absolutely NO chance of getting my respect!  The only reason I gave this joke 2 stars is that as little as I like this trash, it's better than some (please put emphasis on the word SOME) other stuff out there.  Plus, although it's total drivel, he does write his own stuff.  In the end, I guess if you want to feel like you're \\"with it\\" and you can really feel what this dude is saying, go ahead and buy this, but if you want real music with real lyrics and a guy with an ORIGINAL voice, look elsewhere.
B00009MEJU|4.0|I personally, enjoyed 'Solaris', for 2 reasons. #1 I think that George Clooney, is the up & coming, in most of his films, #2 the science fiction, that is portrayed on this film, is just enough to capture the attention of the non-science fiction fan, as myself.. It was not a lot of 'over your head' vocabulary, and 'way out' scenes, that took over the purpose of the film. <BR> Steven Soderbergh did a wonderful job in his direction of the cast, and the filming. The supposed 'nude' scenes were tastfully done, and I felt comfortable taking my two young sons to see it, as well. However, it was somewhat over their heads, as far as, the story line goes. But, the films PG rating was right on!<BR>  If you like movie topics that leave you walking from the theater, scratching your head, and looking for good conversation, then this is the movie for you! Enjoy!
1587990717|4.0|I agree with other reviewers who describe the author as self-centered, but I got the impression he *is* much smarter than the people he criticizes, such as the &quot;lucky&quot; traders he's known.<br />  I think the book is a rant, but it is very interesting.  The best new insight I got from it is that no one is immune to randomness.  I am an aggressive investor, using stock mutual funds and stocks that I buy and hold.  My investment philosophy is built on the knowledge that stocks have outperformed all other investments in any 15-year period over most of the last 100 years.  Taleb reminds me that this does not guarantee that stocks will outperform over the next 15 years.<br />  What I haven't figured out yet is how to incorporate his hedging against rare random events into my style of investing.

B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane is one of the most analyzed and written about films in all the history of movies.  You certainly don't need any commentary from me about the artistic merits of the film.  However, I will say that I find the movie visually stunning with a visual style that has been copied by many and almost always to lesser effect.  Some of the images stay in my memory like a beautiful melody.<br />The script is also very good and at times it is powerful.  And while it is always listed as one of the greatest of all movies, and maybe as a movie it is, I certainly don't think it is the most powerful or moving film ever made.  It certainly is a great film, but can't you think of others that move you more deeply that were also well made films?<br />But to think that Welles was only 25 years old when he made this film is absolutely breathtaking.  In making this film, Welles at once triumphs as a producer, director, and actor.  I can't even think of a similar achievement to compare it with.  Wagner at Bayreuth?<br />This disk is a very beautiful transfer of the film (there are a few small defects), plus interesting commentaries by Roger Ebert, and Peter Bogdanovich, plus the trailer, newsreel from the premier, storyboards, and a second disk with a two-hour documentary on the battle Welles had with Hearst over the making and release of the film.  Isn't it interesting that the film has become more famous than Hearst?  Such a thing was unimaginable in 1941.<br />But don't buy into the myth that this is a crypto biography of Hearst.  There is also McCormick and others (McCormick is the one who built the opera house for his mistress).  Certainly, aspects of Hearst's excesses are obvious, but one of the powers of fiction in the hands of an artist is to mix multiple realities together to get at something deeper and more instructive.  Ebert points out that the famous scene in which Kane destroys his mistress's room was based on a scene where Welles himself lost his temper in a restaurant.  True artists spare themselves least of all.<br />This is a great set of disks that do justice to this great film.  I am glad that I own it.  It deserves to be in your collection.staurant.

The old town french town was wonderfully crafted.  The fashion designers crafted the costumes perfectly to look 1959.  Lasse Hallstrom directed this movie brilliantly.  The writers give the movie the extra unique touches that most other today's movies need.  They make all the events fit together as one. <br />Juliette Dimoche was the perfect actress to play Vianne, a chocolate cook whom most of the town calls her &quot;Satan&quot; for no reason.  Judi Dench wonderfully portrays a cranky old woman whose fate becomes unexpected.  Both deserved their Oscar nominations.  Johnny Depp proves that he's improved greatly in the past few years in his role as a river drifter who falls in love with Vianne.

B00005JKN9|2.0|It was all I could do to get through this marathon of a movie maize.  A film should tell one story, not six or seven, then torture us with such inept miscasting as Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz.  Daniel Day-Lewis tries gallantly to carry this movie, but he should've sued the cast, crew, writers and director for nonsupport.  Instead of GANGS OF NEW YORK, this film should have been titled, \\"Butcher Bill's Mediocre Adventure.\\"<br />Incidentally, I know it's a period piece, and in 19th-Century New York personal hygiene wasn't high on most people's lists, but do we have to overdo it with hair that looks like it's been axle-greased to the scalp?  Made me want to take a fire hose filled with Pert Plus to every actor.<br />Martin Scorsese brings us gang violence, immigration, slums, sloth, class hatred, Tammany Hall corruption, and the Civil War draft in a movie as uneven as the Mississippi and as incoherent as my last mutual fund report.  At least one hour too long, GANGS OF NEW YORK is guilty of studio overkill--no refund for three wasted hours, thank you very much.<br />Think I'll go watch \\"West Side Story.\\"  The Sharks and the Jets.

B00003CXPD|5.0|The title says everything.  &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; gives a great example to the audience of how to live life.  Don't listen to the stereotypes.  Some may criticize your choices, but as long as you act passionately, nobodys' opinions matter.  In this movie, one English boy lives this everyday.<br />Jamie Bell plays Billy Elliot, an eleven year old secretive ballet dancer, whose forced by his family and society to continue boxing.  He lives with his hateful brother and abusive father depressed about the death of his wife.  Elliot must cope with the cruelity at home and the sports center.  Jamie Walters, in her Oscar nominated role, plays his strong-willed ballet instructor.  She will stop at nothing to help Elliot perfect his ballet moves.  The two, along with the rest of the cast, wonderfully portrays their characters.  They give the movie the emotion it needs to portray the realities of their lifestyles.<br />Stephan Daldry brilliantly directs this movie.  He's a genius at character's emotions.  One must respect him more because of the risque material in the script.  Few dare this.  He proves that he will be the next Steven Spielberg in a few years.  Those who are impressed with &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; must also watch &quot;The Hours&quot;, another Daldry-directed movie.  &quot;Billy Elliot's&quot; unique storyline will inspire the audience.
B00003CXP1|4.0|I had been dying to see this movie ever since I first saw it previewed and read about it and it's reviews. Being drawn to these sort of shocking, groundbreaking movies, I finally rented it. I found it a bit too realistic for my tastes, but I  appreciated the artsy filming, and the outstanding  performances such as Ellen Burnstyn as a diet-pill addicted mother of Harry (Jared Leto) who also gave a great performance as her heroin addicted son. Marlon Waylons also gave a great performance as Harry's best freind, he shows us in his performance that he can truly act. And then there's Harry's girlfreind played by Jennifer Connelly in a risky role that will do anything for her next fix. This is one of the most realistic, depressing movies i've ever seen. The first time I saw it it made me so depressed all I could do was just go to sleep, but the second time I watched it I liked a little more, the third time a little more, and so on. I liked it so much by the third time that I had to buy it. This movie is not for everyone, it is very real and very disturbing, but give it a shot anyway you never know. However if you'd rather something not quite as dark I would recomend \\"The Salton Sea\\", \\"Trainspotting\\" or even lighter still howabout \\"Up In Smoke\\".
B00003CXWV|5.0|\\"Blow\\" desplicts the reality of the consequences suffered from selling drugs.  Its unique theme was brilliantly written.  The years passing by was perfected by the costume designers and hair stylists.  Johnny Depp was the perfect actor to play the lead character in his Oscar worthy role.  All other actors perfectly portray their characters wonderfully: a loving father, a hateful mother, a betraying friend, a cancer patient, and many druggies.<br />Those who want to know the consequences desplicted must watch \\"Blow\\".  Giving away all of them would ruin the movie effect for first time viewers.  In the end, one will not be disappointed.
B00003CXP1|4.0|I had been dying to see this movie ever since I first saw it previewed and read about it and it's reviews. Being drawn to these sort of shocking,ground, breaking movies. I finally rented it. I found it a bit too realistic for my tastes, but I  appreciated the artsy filming, and the outstanding  performances such as Ellen Burnstyn as a diet-pill addicted mother of Harry (Jared Leto) who also gave a great performance as her cocaine addicted son. Marlon Waylons also gave a great performance as Harry's best freind, he shows us in his performance that he can truly act. And then there's Harry's girlfreind played by Jennifer Connelly in a risky role that will do anything for her next fix including become a prostitute. She truly put's her whole career on the line, I mean what other actress (thats not a porn star) would have lesbian double header anal sex with a dildo. This is one of the most realistic depressing movies i've ever seen. The First time I saw it it made me feel so depressed all I could do was just go to sleep, but the second time I watched it I liked a little more, the third time a little more and so on. I liked it so much by the fifth time that I bought it. This movie is not for anyone however it is very real and very disturbing, but if you do watch it and don't like it, watch it again to make sure,because now I love it. However if you'd rather somthing not quite as dark I would recomend The Salton Sea, or Trainspotting as other choices for drug movies.
B00008WG3U|4.0|Before i start, I will say that this is indeed the first Nofx album that i have listened to. I have heard a lot from the Nofx and punk purists that this album is one of Nofx's worst.<BR>I actually find this a little hard to believe, even though I am yet to hear from the other, earlier albums from Nofx.<BR>I think this is a very good album but it just doesn't deserve 5 stars.I can manage to go through the whole album and just skip 1 song - Anarchy camp. This is probably because it is Ska and I, myself am not really into ska. This song sounds completely different to every other song on the album though.<br />songs that I listen to but aren't great are 13 stitches, mattersville and decom-posuer. I struggle even more to listen to Whoops I od'd but its not that bad.<BR>The next set of songs which are very good are The Irrationality of Rationallity, she's nubs(which is quite a funny song), medio core and re-gaining Unconsciousness.<BR>My favorite songs(in order) are:<BR>1.Franco-un American: this is a great song, whoever sings it talks about not wanting to be an American who doesn't care about the rest of the world or something along those lines.<br />2.\\"Idiots are taking over\\": very good song again probably talking about that ....George Bush who is, amazingly enough, the president of the United States as you all know.<br />3. American Errorist: I can't really tell what Nofx is talking about in this song but I think is a very,very good song, even though it is only 1 minute 50 seconds long.<br />4. Again I have no idea what this song is about but it is great ne way.<br />So there ya have it. I think that punk rock fans should look into getting this album. I didn't think I would really like Nofx but as you can see I quite enjoy listening to this album.<BR>If you are a fan of softer sort of stuff like Blink and New Found Glory you should get this album any way because it is very good. Nofx get very political in this album and I think it helps if you agree with them about George Bush etc.., which i definetely do. But it is not too serious and you can probably enjoy it even if you are a die hard patriot in love with America etc...<br />to sum up, buy this album if you like anything like punk.
B00005QGAT|5.0|With all the headlines about plastic surgeries, melting faces, questionable parenting practices and voodoo contracts on entertainment moguls, it's easy to forget just how talented Michael Jackson was (is?)<br />I found this in my CD collection and popped it in. As a result, I remembered why I had a crush on Michael all thru my childhood and teenage years. Listening to tracks such as Off the Wall, Don't Stop Til You Get Enuf and Rock With You shows the true scope of a gifted performer who apparently got too caught up in his own publicity.<br />I've always considered Off the Wall a far superior work to Thriller and all subsequent Michael Jackson productions. The combination of Jackson, Quincy Jones and Rod Temperton provided the 80s with the best R&amp;B. To those who only became aware of Jackson during his Thriller fame, I suggest you buy this CD as well as some Motown Jackson 5 compiliations. It will answer questions of why he became famous in the first place.<br />The extra tracks are nice but really don't add anything that make this CD more special than it already was.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Peter Jackson's(director) latest installment in the blockbust lord of the rings series \\"The Two Towers\\" is an incredible sequel to an amazing movie. Rarely does a sequel surpass the original, but this movie certainly does. The movie transitions seamlessly from the first, following frodo and sam in the mountains where they meet up with gollum, who serves as their guide on their journey to morodor. Incredible animation brings gollum to life, at first I was amazed at what a great job the animators did with gollum, but by the end of the movie, I saw him as just another character, I had forgotten he was computer animated. <BR>      For those that have read the book, this movie may prove to stretch a tad further from jrr tolkiens writings than the first, but it is enjoyable none the less. With the introduction of many new characters and creatures, Jackson's crew seems to hit the nail on the head with each actor/animation. The infamous ents are incredibly well done, and as the march of the ents begins, the viewer will most certainly get a rush of adrenaline, as the readers do when tolkien described it. The greatest scene in this movie is by far the battle of Helm's deep. <BR>      You must get this movie, if you like the first movie, youll love this one, and its guaranteed to leave you lusting for the third film, which hits theaters this december, and let me tell you, im counting the days, and so will you.
0380729407|2.0|I have to admit that I just don't get it.  I'm baffled as to why Ray Bradbury is considered such a genius.  This book, considered one of his best, really doesn't stand out to me as anything all that special.  The plot is cute, at best.  It's not terribly creative; in fact, it's quite formulaic and often predictable.  The characters are interesting, but not in any profound sort of way.  And the writing is choppy and unrefined.  I might give this book to an 11-year-old looking for a quick, easy read.  But I have to believe that the past forty years have produced better material in the way of fantasy fiction.
B000099T2L|3.0|This CD is OK. The first few tracks are a lot of fun, but as the CD progresses, it gets boring, with the exception of my favorite track on the entire CD, &quot;That's How You Like It,&quot; an amazingly catchy track written by Jay-Z.
B00009V7RF|4.0|The Black Eyed Peas debut cd,\\"Elephunk\\" is truly a piece of work. It has a great hip-hop and rap flavor. Their songs don't sound alike, but they all have the same bounce in it. The Black Eyed Peas have done an excellent job with their first album. If you liked Sean Paul, you'll like the Black Eyed Peas, and vice versa. Enjoy the taste of the Black Eyed Peas!!
B00006IR5S|5.0|I bought Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets soundtrack and it is great! My favourite pieces are \\"Prologue: Book II and Escape from the Dursleys\\", \\"Fawkes the Phoenix\\" and \\"Harry's Wondrous world\\".  This is a great cd for any Harry Potter fan!  John Williams (the composer) did a wonderful job capturing Harry in music.  It includes all of the pieces featured in the movie.  The music expresses the excitement of the flying car and the darkness of the Chamber of Secrets.  It has the happiness of everyone being together again at the end of the movie and the the magic of Fawkes the Phoenix.  If you love the Harry Potter movie then you'll love the soundtrack!
B00008PX8P|5.0|I started listening to Zeppelin in the mids 80s while I was in high school. Being too young to experience Zeppelin live, I could only hear the stories about how great they were in concert.  These DVDs will make any Zeppelin fan respect their work all over again and will no doubt spawn a new generation of fans.  If you think you have experienced Zeppelin from the albums, these DVDs are a must have so that you can more fully appreciate the music and the band.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This is the disc that hooked me on Dream Theater...  The 42 minute epic &quot;Six Degrees&quot;, together with the impossibly heavy &quot;Glass Prison&quot; and the introspective &quot;Blind Faith&quot;, &quot;Misunderstood&quot;, and &quot;Disappear&quot;, make this a perfect CD for a MUSIC fan.  Why?  Because MUSIC fans appreciate things like this... Great lyrics, great music with incredible dynamics (See &quot;Misunderstood&quot;) and brilliant harmonies, and great players that, after all of the hubub about DT, prove that they are indeed human...<br />I would recommend this disc to any and all who like great music : There's something here for you.
0449002128|3.0|I was really excited about Daniel Silva after finishing his excellent WWII thriller \\"The Unlikely Spy\\".  However, his subsequent books have been uneven - \\"Mark of the Assassin\\" was OK but bordered on copyright infringement on \\"Patriot Games\\", while \\"The Marching Season\\" was virtually unreadable.  So, I got scared off from him until my Dad loaned me this pleasant surprise.  Again, nothing groundbreaking, but at least the characters are well-rounded and the interpersonal conflicts are interesting.  Also, the Gabriel Allon protagonist has the potential to be a good franchise base - the duality of assassin and art restorer has the makings of many interesting reads.
B00005A3KS|5.0|\\"Point Break\\" is Bigelow at her best.  It has wonderful artistic moments ,with the waves used by the villainous surfers, as well as a group parachuting scene with the hero and villains all holding hands in a circle in the air.  The actors are well paired with both Keanu Reeve as the hero FBI agent who learns how to surf to catch the ex-Presidents bank robbers.  Patrick Swayze, in his best role, plays a guru philosopher surfer who heads up the bank robbers, wearing a Ronald Reagan mask during the armed robberies.  The bank robberies by the 4 surfers in their ex-presidents' masks verge on the hilarious.<br /><br />The final surfing footage with Swayze and Reeve in Australia is breathtaking.  \\"Point Break\\" is well worth owning. Writer-director Kathryn Bigelow was a very talented painter before she went to film school to become a movie director.  It shows in her work which is very artistic for someone primarily known to the action-adventure genre of filmmaking.  She is a breath of fresh air in this genre, investing it with literate scripts and haunting imagery.  Her most frequent producer is James Cameron (the action wonder king, \\"Titanic,\\" \\"Terminator\\"), who is also her ex-husband.  You can see his influence on her work as well.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00005JKN9|3.0|There are a lot of great parts to this film: wonderful performances all around (especially Daniel Day-Lewis!), masterful<BR>direction by Martin Scorsese, a visual style which is compelling<BR>without being distracting, and a very sinister theme about class<BR>warfare which is particularly pertinent today.  Unfortunately,<BR>the whole does not equal the sum of the parts.  <BR>This movie shows how urban gangs have always been part of the<BR>American urban landscape, preying on the poor through violence<BR>and fear.  In fact, Daniel Day-Lewis' character, Bill \\"the Butcher\\" Cutting gives a speech about fear and survival that is<BR>the heart of the picture, both emotionally and temporally.  Gangs<BR>are tolerated, Scorsese implies, because of an uneasy understanding by the upper classes of their value in keeping the<BR>poor \\"in line.\\"  This is a powerful message -- certainly not one<BR>you would expect from a Hollywood movie.  One admires Scorsese<BR>for trying to say it at all.  But the power and force of the <BR>movie are blunted by the studio's or distributors' insistence<BR>on a hopeful, if not happy ending.  You can see where Scorsese<BR>intended to conclude this picture, where everything comes together in a complete, powerful and artistic whole.  Alas, the<BR>film does NOT end there!  Instead, we are given an emotionally<BR>false \\"tag ending\\" to soften the blow, which blunts the force<BR>and seriously undermines the thrust of the entire story.<BR>Lop off the last 3 to 5 minutes of this film and you would have<BR>had a GREAT movie.  Bill \\"the Butcher\\" would have!
B0000048CP|5.0|Listen closely to this album. Hear that? It's simplicity itself.<br />Yep, nothing complicated or overly technical here, just a damned fine metal album. Quorthon kept the recipe simple. The riffs are basic but memorable. The solos are used sparingly, but effectively. Most of the drumming is simple snare/kick with the odd fill, and played at different tempos. Quorthon will never be an opera singer, but he put everything into the vocals. There is the odd atmospheric bit, like galloping horses and spectral choirs, but overall, it is all pared back to the absolute basics of metal.<br />You can hear the origins of much of the raw Black Metal sound of Darkthrone and Mayhem here. Perhaps the biggest difference is Bathory's warmer, fuller production. It seems like Motorhead's philosophy of &quot;everything louder than everything else&quot; was put into practice here. There is a noticeable static/white noise edge to a number of the guitar parts. When Quorthon lets rip with a throaty growl, like at the beginning of &quot;For All Those Who Died&quot;, you can almost imagine the studio sound engineer pulling his hair out as needles and gauges across the studio console overload and redline.<br />Moreover, perhaps because the music has been kept so simple, it has an air of majesty. It demands attention. This is not an album you can listen to quietly while reading a book. You have to notice it; you just don't have a choice. It seems like everything here is mighty Nordic imagery and Viking warriors on a quest for Valhalla, war axes raised high in battle, and on a couple of the tracks, like &quot;Holocaust&quot; and the title track this is true. A peek at the lyric sheet though, hints at a vein of humour hidden in plain sight.<br />Check &quot;Pace Til Death&quot; for example. It is an ode to playing fast and living fast and almost seems like it was lifted from a Motley Crue album. It is impossible to tell from the delivery. In addition, Quorthon has had fun with acrostics on some of the other tracks- take the first letter from each line of the lyrics and you get a message. &quot;The Golden Walls Of Heaven&quot; spells out SATAN repeatedly, while &quot;Dies Irae&quot; gives us the message &quot;CHRIST THE B*STARD SON OF HEAVEN&quot;.<br />Minor silliness aside, 'Blood Fire Death' is an essential album for fans of Black and Death Metal. It is one of those odd releases with a foot firmly in both camps, and can be equally appreciated by fans of both genres.
B00006LLNU|5.0|the music is brilliant; few artists leave me speechless and this is definitly one of them.  every track is like a complete revelation and (for some unknown reason) i have this urge to cry; there is so much power and unrelenting emotion that the listener is left to contemplate without trailing NOISE that other music tend to leave behind.  going to their website, i also learned that there is no REAL lyrics to this CD---the language is almost as if it were &quot;created&quot; or &quot;made up&quot; alongside the tracks, so don't expect to sing along--it goes a little deeper than that.<br />if you arent into ambiant, slow type of music, at least buy this CD for long road trips----every time i listen to it i feel like i learn something about myself.  i think thats what good music is about.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is tremendously different from most of the other war novels. For one, glory and honor are not depicted as characteristics of soldiers who are in combat. Yossarian isn't exactly on the front line, like Paul in All Quiet on the Western Front, and his ability to go to Rome allows the reader to see that although combat missions are forced onto him, he is still a human being. He is not like a character that is so engrossed in the war whose condition is difficult for the average person to comprehend. Yossarian shows you his life, his inability to ensure himself survival, and the utter irony of war. The novel is captivating and evokes many different emotions: laughter, tension, shock, and sadness. There were many instances when I laughed and at the same time realized the horror of Yossarian's life. Heller's unique ability to illustrate war had a striking effect on me and remained with me for a long time.
B00009L1TA|2.0|A Film by John McTiernan<br />I didn't like it.  I'll make that clear from the start.  I thought the movie had some potential and had its moments, but McTiernan kept throwing huge twists and swerves at us and ultimately the movie threw one too many twists and just killed the whole thing.<br />The movie opens with some horrible narration by Connie Nielson, but we move into a Ranger training exercise.  West (Samuel L Jackson) is the training leader and he takes his men out on a live fire exercise.  The scene shifts to a chopper coming in and we learn that it has been 6 hours since the men were supposed to check in.  Nobody has.  The soldiers in the helicopter see flashes of gunfire and realize that the surviving men are firing on each other.  Two men are rescued, one goes to the hospital and other is taken in for questioning.  The non-injured soldier is interrogated by Obsorne (Connie Nielson).  He demands to talk to a Ranger and makes a mark on the bottom of a sheet of paper that seems to spook the base commander.  The base commander calls in a disgraced former Ranger/DEA agent (who is currently under suspicion of bribery, but is an old friend, Hardy (John Travolta).<br />Hardy interviews/interrogates both surviving Rangers and he gets different stories, so he keeps on going back and forth between the two of them and the stories keep changing, as if they are adding on to each other and building and adapting the stories for Hardy as he brings new information to each Ranger.  Thus far, the story is told in a similar fashion to Courage Under Fire (a superior movie to this one).  The problem is that Basic keeps throwing twists and turns until it no longer makes much sense nor could I keep caring when something changed again.  By the time the last twist is thrown as the very end, and I realized that this invalidated the entire movie, I also realized that this last twist killed quite a bit of the internal consistency (whatever was left) that the movie actually had.  I'm not going to give spoilers for the film, in case anyone does want to see it, but if you think back on the movie (after watching it), one or two comments make more sense and the rest make a whole lot less sense.<br />The bottom line is that this movie stinks and was a disappointment (even going in with low expectations).  Sam Jackson gives another scene stealing performance, but it is completely wasted.  Connie Nielson was flat and uninteresting, and Travolta was serviceable (no more than that).  Basic tries to do too much with too little and turns out to be an utter waste of film.m not going to give spoilers for the film, in case anyone does want to see it, but if you think back on the movie (after watching it), one or two comments make more sense and the rest make a whole lot less sense.  <br />The bottom line is that this movie stinks and was a disappointment (even going in with low expectations).

B00006950W|5.0|In my opinion I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Watching it 3 times praticly in a row before having to return it to the rental store. But be warned. It doesnt really relate very much to the Game at all really. With the whole buisness people building that live underground an such....dont remember that part in the game O.O...but it DOES give good scenes as well with the ''zombies'' and the all famous ''Licker''. Like I said I DID enjoy it...but if your expecting something to be almost JUST like the game series...you might want to rent it first,just so to be sure that you'll enjoy it before you buy it.
B00005JMC6|5.0|This is perhaps the most touching movie I have ever seen.  You will not be disappointed.
B00006LLLN|5.0|I bought this CD after watching a part of the live show on PBS -- Alison's silky smooth vocals appealed instantly to me.  Listening to the CD was something else -- it is very well recorded for a live show and all the musicians are masters of their trade.  The first song &quot;Let me touch you..&quot; alone is worth the price of the CD!  For you audiophile listeners -- this album is recorded in DSD and has an amazing soundstage and depth.  I have always loved acoustic bass and this album truly brings out how much difference it can make to the overall music.  I wonder why more bands don't prefer the acoustic bass.<br />Anyway, this album is a treasure.  I am sure that like myself, this should appeal to a wide cross over audience who listen to jazz, classical, blues.<br />In this age where Brittany Spears &amp; Justin Timberlake are considered to be musicians, it is so hard to find good music.  Thanks to Alison Krauss and the Union Station for giving us something so special.
B00006RCPM|5.0|I won't go into a whole review of the movie because so many others have done it - and very ably.  I will say this though.<br />I don't like Tom Cruise generally, and Spielberg's &quot;AI&quot; was SO disappointing to me that I thought this would be more of the same.<br />What a shock!<br />I REALLY liked this movie.  I actually thought it deserved 4.5 stars not 5, but I couldn't bring myself to give it 4 stars, because it really is better than a 4.  You won't be disappointed if you buy it.  Good story, good editing, a kind of &quot;it-could-happen&quot; type movie.  All I can say is ... bring on the popcorn!
B000099T2L|4.0|Overall, a brilliant effort from Ms. Knowles. She may not have a feel-good anthem like Ashanti's 'Rock With You' but 'Crazy in Love' is still a wicked contender. It takes gumption to share studio space with Big Boi but B pulls it off on 'Hip Hop Star'. Instead of R&B posturing, it's good to hear a talented singer have fun with an irresistable melody like 'Signs' (as Missy rachets herself up another notch towards production preeminence). Beyonce finds her groove on 'Me, Myself, and I' and doesn't miss a step until 'Dangerously in Love 2'. 'Speechless' is the best song on anybody's album in recent memory.  The menacing bass line hints at a hungry vixen akin to Prince's \\"Wildcat in a celibate rage\\".  By the time Beyonce screams 'Yes!', you'll be scrambling for contraception. On 'That's How You like It',  Jigga is actually sharper than on the single 'Crazy', and the song sounds more sincere, as if removed from the pressure of a hit single the two can lavish boatloads of talent entirely on the other. 'The Closer I Get to You' is as polished as one might expect from Luther but one wishes B would have cut loose at least once on the elder baladeer.  She sings almost with contrition, as if Vicar Vandross suspects her naughty missionary work on 'Speechless'.  She finishes with an okay song to her dad but shows some songwriting ability.  Instead of a sappy interlude she belts how her Dad responded to her bad tattoo by getting one as well. I guess Father indeed knows best. Four stars, Ms. Knowles.
0767814622|5.0|MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is a very heavy movie about a young American who is caught at a Turkish airport trying to smuggle hashish out of the country. After his arrest this true story becomes a grim tale of life in a Turkish prison and the almost hopeless task of trying to gain freedom. Brad Davis has the starring role of Billy Hayes. Randy Quaid, John Hurt and Norbert Weisser play the parts of other prison inmates. Mike Keller does a good job in the role of Billy's anguished father. The acting is uniformly excellent.<br />The film won Oscars in 1978 for Best Adapted Screenplay and Original Score. It also received nominations for Best Picture, Director (Alan Parker), Supporting Actor (John Hurt) and Editing.<br />Alan Parker is known for his direction of several good movies including MISSISSIPPI BURNING.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This album includes several of the best covers done in the past decade.  Trent Reznor's &quot;Hurt&quot; was a good song with Nine Inch Nails, though somewhat over-produced and pretentious with its background industrial sounds and its ham-handed gothic imagery.  Johnny Cash strips it down to its barest meaning, and makes it the loneliest sound in the world.  One realizes that the lyrics were actually brilliant.  Cash does the same with Depeche Mode's &quot;Personal Jesus,&quot; which--sung in his powerful bellow--becomes more than a smug, ironic song by an electronica pop-band, but a powerful piece about desperation.  Simply put, no one can deliver a song with the depth of feeling and nuances of Johnny Cash, and the numerous covers only show how he can add layers even to songs that have become cliche.  Those criticizing this album are simply asking it to be a different animal altogether--catchier, sunnier, easier to absorb.  But this is a painful album, and Johnny Cash sings with as much as wisdom in his voice as any artist since Bob Dylan's prime.  In fact, THE MAN COMES AROUND will make you nostalgic for the slightly off-key but brilliantly soulful duets from NASHVILLE SKYLINE.  Cash also chooses some wonderful back-up voices here, using Fiona Apple to great effect in &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water,&quot; and teaming up with another baritone, Nick Cave, for a great revamping of Hank Williams.  The album is ecletic, inventive, and one of the best genre-crossing displays of talent in many years.
B00006EXL5|5.0|This is the best cd I own and MCR is my favorite band ever!  Everyone should own this cd because MCR rules everything.  For NC folks, they have a show at Cat's Cradle on the August 15, 2003.  It will be rad!
B00005JLSE|5.0|This musical is not for the faint of heart. It's sexy, bright, loud, in-your-face and irreverent. <BR>One of the most intriguing dynamics of this musical is that it is a scathing satire. It may seem dark because it strips away all the lies, traditions and pretty faces of the most trusted organizations in our country. It doesn't coddle the veiwer with sweet ideals and fanciful justice- it shows life as it is but never loses it's sense of laughing at itself. It never takes itself too seriously, as a good satire should.<BR>That's why one is almost mesmerized at this production, the music being awesome is the least of this production's good points.<BR>It's full of imperfect characters who have vice, selfishness and a myriad of other unhappy qualities- the types you love to hate. I don't admire them, but I understand where they're coming from, they have almost a desperate honesty about them- 'this is what I'm about, so love it or leave it'<BR>I think this musical was brought to the big screen with energy and courage, I loved all the imagery and symbolism, the snapping satire and the biting social commentary.<BR>It's a must-own!
B000002VC5|4.0|I Robot, artistically, sports one of my favorite album covers and, musically, is one of my favorite Alan Parson Project records--although it is way below my all-time favorite: Ammonia Avenue.  There are a lot of instrumental tracks on this one.  Besides the brilliant 6:06 title track and the last song &quot;Genesis CH. I V. 32,&quot; which you can hum along to, the other instrumentals, &quot;Nucleus&quot; and &quot;Total Eclipse,&quot; seem to be just to provide mood.  Of the non-instrumentals, most are some of the Project's finest.  &quot;Don't Let It Show&quot; may be a little too Air Supply-ish, but the rest are gems. My favorite is the beautiful &quot;Some Other Time.&quot;  It ends with a powerful piano which is refreshing since the Project often ended some of their nicest, simplest tracks with way over-the-top orchestration (case in point: &quot;Silence and I&quot; on the Eye in the Sky LP).  Unfortunately, the orchestra finds its way at the end of the otherwise cool, rockin' &quot;Breakdown.&quot;  The quasi-gospel singing just doesn't seem to fit.  Another favorite of mine is the very pleasant &quot;Day After Day (The Show Must Go On).&quot;  <br />A quote inside the gatefold of the vinyl release reveals the concept of I Robot: &quot;The story of the rise of the machine and the decline of man...&quot;  I like this idea, but I don't see it developed in these songs.  Recorded at Abbey Road Studios between December 1976 and March 1977, I Robot is probably the most disco-sounding album the Alan Parsons Project made, especially with the tracks &quot;I Wouldn't Want To Be Like You&quot; and &quot;The Voice.&quot; If you have one or two other APP albums and are thinking of expanding your collection, I definitely recommend I Robot.  Some of the best tracks on this album are as good as the best on Eye in the Sky, etc.  I only wish there were some unreleased tracks to add to these CDs.

Just before dinner. <BR>  <BR>Their problem is that they really like it down here (or for Crowley, \\"up\\" here) on Earth-except maybe for the fact that all tapes and CDs that are left overnight in the car turn mysteriously into \\"Best of Queen\\" albums- so somehow, they've got to stop Armageddon from happening.  So, they have to stop the Four Motorcyclists of the Apocalypse (featuring DEATH.... y the bony guy from Discworld), defeat the marching ranks of the Witch-Finder Army (all two of them), and above all, they need to find and kill the Antichrist, currently the most powerful creature on Earth. <BR>  <BR>Which is a shame, because he's eleven years old, loves his dog (even though it's really a Satanic Hell-Hound), really cares about the environment, and is the sort of boy anyone would be proud to have as a son.  <br />You simply got to read it to believe it!

1567184855|5.0|This book is just too wonderful for words.  I'm ever so grateful for Dr. Newton for all the work he has put into this book.  I just finished DESTINY OF SOULS by him - which is more detailed and requires more attention, but is worth the effort.  I learned in MANY LIVES, MANY MASTERS (Brian Weiss, MD) that Christianity did believe in reincarnation, but it was edited out of the Bible in the Roman era.  Give this book a try and you will be in awe.
B00006AW2G|5.0|This is certainly the best Stones Album. I would say that the stones started preparing themselves for this recording since &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;, another GREAT album in my opinion. In &quot;TSMR&quot;, they changed their musical style with a more powerful and experimental sound, different than their earlier releases, and their musical development resulted in a creative, solid and totally professional release called &quot;LET IT BLEED&quot;. All songs are great, with no exceptions; and it represents Rolling Stones at their peak regarding composing and playing. They would never sound the same after this album.
0671027573|5.0|After reading 'Kill and Tell' and feeling a little disappointed, I was just a bit hesitant to read 'Mr. Perfect'. But I gave it a chance because of all the raving reviews from readers I had heard. Well, needless to say, 'Mr. Perfect' captivated me from the first chapter. Throughout the whole novel, Linda Howard delivers humor through the conversations Jaine and Sam share. I couldn't go five minutes without bursting out laughing at a smart-mouthed comment made by either Sam or Jaine. It's a pretty fast-paced novel, and it has a mixed plot consisting of suspense, humor, and passion. <BR>What I found a little unrealistic, however, was the way 'The List' spread. The List wasn't all that special; I couldn't see how it became so popular.<BR>But with that put aside, the 4.5 stars I originally gave the novel bumped up a notch to 5 stars because it really kept me reading. Overall, 'Mr. Perfect' was an extremely fun read and I'll definitely be reading more of Linda Howard's works.

Here's the solution: read them both and decide for yourself!
0767805712|3.0|I bought &quot;Gattaca&quot; after seeing the excerpt from what turns out to be the start of the movie, in PBS's &quot;Nova&quot; program.  Folks design their offspring and get the USDA seal of approval on their genetic sequence.  Thus is the entrance to the great machine of identification and authentication made, and the outsiders are simply not &quot;valid&quot;.  I guess I could live with less of the sensational action and further elaboration on the science, but then I'm an admitted geek from the get-go.  The aura of this film is very much like what we saw in the screen version of &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;; that of a world you know has gone nuts, with some obsession that is supposed to be the end all for public safety and social harmony.  Folks will wind up, in the world of &quot;Gattaca&quot;, with an identification about as impersonal as an ear-tag appended to a factory-farmed meat animal, but a lot more telling.  I shudder to imagine that the much-maligned delusions behind eugenics, made so popular earlier in the last century, will create such a bunch of cretins as the two fellows who conspire to fool...not mother nature, but Big Brother himself.  One really has to wonder, in all of this, which is the better cause--one's comfort or one's innate conscience.  &quot;Gattaca&quot; works the best it can with its premise, only by the time it gets fully laid down, we're just dealing with another story of a fugitive for whom we're supposed to cheer.  There are steep and awesome precipices in the idea of genetic authentication, and the movie gives us some idea of them.  But is not evolution just like that, and equally dramatic?  It would seem that we're enacting our own set of challanges, then sending out intentional mutations that are supposed to win.  Yes, this is all suggested, but what we principally have is an attempt at a cliffhanger flight.  The subject matter of our protagonists' interpretation of propriety, however, is just another struggle of the freedom-fighter ilk.  It is a little too focused on the lead characters, leaving a lot left to do with a very profound topic.  It would seem, in the human intervention at hand, that ontogeny truly recapitulates philogeny, only the ontology is hardly able to account for the impossible number of original interventions that took place during the philology.  Wherever a crime is comitted, evidence remains.  I would have liked to have seen a better treatment of the ultimate crime behind this society's proclamation of what is good and what is not.
0385507755|5.0|My husband is a recovering alcoholic and drug addict.  I read this book to gain an understanding about what goes those an addicts mind and how a substance can take control one's life.  James Frey, did NOT disappoint me.  With his harsh, abrasive and explicit words, describes the Hell with great detail, about living as an addict. He takes you through his self-inflicted life, where his unexplained fury torments him enough to make him want to suppress it with any substance he can get a hold of starting at the age of 10.  He lets you know that there is no one to blame in his case which fuels his self-hatred keeping him from seeking any means to get well.  When he enters rehab at the start of the book, his description of each character as they enter his life, is given in the purest of forms.  Even though Mr. Frey professes not to follow AA, he in fact twists the philosophies of AA to fit his needs.  Instead of a random group of AA members that meet at a pre-set time, he shares stories nad his heart with a group of addicts of his choosing, without scheduling restrictions, and structure.  His beliefs are stated simply, but with profound implications.  I admire his bravery to bare all-the bad, ugly, gross, disturbing, horrifying, and pathitic existance a hard-core addict endures just to have a taste of the next high.  As he put it, there is nothing heroic, or glamous about ANY type of addiction.  The true face of addition is exposed, and if you really want to know the \\"real deal\\", you'll read this book and understand, there are no easy answers, no short-cuts, no promises outside of making a conscious decision about staying sober, one moment at a time, inorder to stay alive.

1400031362|4.0|Precious Ramotswe, &quot;a woman ... in Africa, which was who, and where, she wanted to be,&quot; returns in this third installment of Alexander McCall's gentle series about Botswana's &quot;No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.&quot;  Mma Ramotswe's assistant, Mma Makutsi, comes into her own as a detective in her own right and as the &quot;acting manager&quot; of Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni's Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors.  Mma Romotswe makes a powerful Government Man remember his manners and solves his case with powerful compassion. Mr. McCall's writing, as in the two prior books, is humorous, wise and often lyrical.  A couple of threads in the book are left loose - perhaps to tantalize us into reading the fourth novel in the series - The Kalahari Typing School for Men.  It has worked for me.
0140186409|5.0|I had John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath sitting on my bookshelf for several years and always wanted to read it.  I started it one summer, but only got about twenty pages or so into it before I gave up.  I didn't get back to The Grapes of Wrath until my freshman year of college when I had to read it for a Geography class.  I wasn't sure why the book was assigned for Geography, but was glad that I finally had an excuse to read through the book.  It was assigned at the begining of the semester, and I think that I finished it about a month before we even started talking about it.<br />This book deserves every bit of praise that it has recieved.  It tells the story of the Joad family, \\"Okies\\" who are journeying to California after their farm has been destroyed by both the effects of \\"The Dust Bowl\\" and the attempts of the United States government to control crop prices.  At first, they believe that the \\"Golden state\\" is abundant with oppertunaties; Grampa is so excited that he says he wants to smash grapes all over his face when he gets to California.  Yet soon all their hopes turn sour.  Their trip exposes the rural farm family to the hardships of literally surviving during a time of economic downfall.  The Joads experience loss of several family members and blique hopes for steady employment when they finally reach California; yet by the novel's end Steinbeck ensures that the Joads--and all the migrant farm workers in general--will continue to endure.  Steinbeck inspired the characters in The Graphes of Wrath with heartfelt emotion, and by reading it you will truely experience their difficulties.<br />A unique characteristic of the novel is that it contains \\"interlude\\" chapters after every narrative chapter or two.  These chapters describe the the overall effects of others during The Dust Bowl and weave their way into the events of the Joads themselves.  The first interlude chapter about the turtle is quite interesting and serves as a symbol of the story overall.<br />This book is a must read for anyone and can be interpreted on quite a few different levels, including an allegory of the journey to the promised land.  There are even a few funny jokes that I underlined in my text to remember.  Although the novel may not imediately seem all that interesting, stick with it because it is worth finishing./>This book is a must read for anyone and can be interpreted on quite a few different levels, including an allegory of the journey to the promised land.

IT DONT GET NO BETTER THAN THAT. Michael Jordan cant really act in my opinion but those basket ball scenes and the looney tunes classic stunts make up for that. You'll love it. Just for the fact that the worlds funniest cartoons and biggest ball player are in the movie. Get it just for those reasons alone.

0385504209|3.0|I had fun reading this mystery novel, but<br />I agree with the reader from Columbia, SC, June 9th.  Umberto Eco is much better.  Brown's prose is often trite.  Eco is a class act.  Read Eco.

6302787068|5.0|When this movie came out, I drew inspiration from these three characters : The Genie, Abu the Monkey and Iago the Parrot. I'm was and still am a combonation of the three of them. I lost this movie somehow. I'd like to think My mother hid it from me when I wasnt home one day. I used to watch it 2 or 3 times a day. Before school (I had to wake up early), after school and before bed. I havent found my princess Jasmine yet. But maybe I will in a whole new world. Get this movie. You'll love it. I know I did.
B00005JKNC|1.0|I don't even know where to start.  This movie is bad in every possible way.  The corniest and sappiest plot insults the intelligence of anyone over five years old.  It is so predictable and so stupid.  I rent on average three movies per week, and I consider myself somewhat of a movie buff.  To say that this is the worst movie I have EVER seen should tell you something.  I can't believe this is the same director that made &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, which is one of my favorite movies.  Very, very sad...
0385720920|5.0|What can I say about this book that all the other reviews hadn't clued you in on. Nothing.<br />This book started slow- I think all of chucks stuff starts out slow and are a little confused until you get to the end and then you sigh and say oh yeah \\"I get it\\".<br />It's about Victor Mancini who chokes on purpose and is a sex addict. all the sex and sex addict stuff is laugh out loud funny. Who said sex was an awkard necessity that looks funny from the outside oh yeah I did and this book definetly shows you how funny sex can be seen as funny.<br />As for what it's about... you'll have to decide for yourself. I saw it as a self discovery, one persons journey in their head. I saw Victor as incredibly intelligent yet incredibly lost human being living his life through near necessity. I thought the book was very provacative and thouht provocking but Chucks style is sometimes harsh and hard to get into. He certainly isn't a fluid writer but who says he has to be it takes all kinds.<br />I like the book and I think about even now months later.
B000000993|5.0|This is probably tools 2nd best cd. This cd, in my opinion, is when they first started experimenting with different sounds and trippy music. What can I say.....tools a great band and all their cds are worth buying.
6300274195|5.0|I loved this movie since I was in first grade. Mainly because the main character, the lovable Dumbo, reminded me of myself. I was an out cast and people made fun of me all the time and I only had six \\"Real\\" friends, as did Dumbo (Timothy Mouse and the 5 singing Crows who showed Dumbo how to fly). I cry everytime it goes off because it ends so fast. If only the movie was longer would it be better. Get it because of Dumbo cutness and the wonderful songs (My favorite was \\"when I see an elephant fly\\"). The movie will bring tears to your eyes.
B00003CXXI|4.0|One can't really call this a children's movie, even with it's fairy tale charm and animated characters.  People of all ages will love the time-honored tale of Beauty and the Beast - uh - with a twist, shall I say?  A mean, ugly old ogre forms an unfriendly, unlikely, sometimes friendly, alliance with a donkey - whose voice is done by none other than Eddie Murphy. The donkey IS a pain in the ....rump, but without this donkey's help, Shrek the green ogre won't rescue the beautiful princess Fiona for Lord Farquar.  The dragon (yes of course there is a dragon) is formidable, danger lurks everywhere, and the princess is trapped high in a fortress tower.  Shrek's home, his &quot;swamp&quot;, has been over-run by fairy tale creatures - all with no place to go since Lord Farquar has evicted them from their homes. Lord Farquar and Shrek make a deal: Shrek and the donkey rescue the Princess Fiona to be Lord Farquar's bride and Shrek will get his homey little swamp back.  But what happens if things go awry?  True love is never certain and often blind, but then, we all knew that. Didn't we?
B000002LE6|3.0|\\"Eye No\\",the crafted pop of \\"Alphabet Street\\" and \\"Glam Slam\\",the percussive \\"Dance On\\" and the dancable tital song are<BR>highlites but I must deduct starts for two reasons.Every song on \\"Lovesexy\\" is recorded as a suite,without breaks,on one 40 plus minute cut-it's impossible to skip to individual songs,a questionable artistic desition.Whitch is a pity because it's a fairly incosistant album that could have and still does deserve a better presentation.But the way the music is going these days c'est le vie?

It's a classic and a good movie for adults as well as kids. You wont regret buying this.
0142004235|5.0|Let me start by saying, I would NEVER have read a \\"classic\\" if Oprah did not suggest it.....but this book is WONDERFUL!! The characters are all so richly described and I read it in 1 week. It's a swift read, even though it's 600+ pages, because it's so riveting. While Samuel was my favorite character, Cathy was the girl we all love to hate. I couldn't believe her!<BR>If you're scared of buying this book due to it's \\"classic\\" status, take it from me: IT'S FANTASTIC!!

B00008977N|1.0|I have owned the VHS of this show for several years. It is one of the best shows that I have ever seen. The DVD on the other hand is pretty bad.  The picture quality is no better than the VHS, is sometimes even compromised (watch MK's drum fills on &quot;Come Talk To Me&quot; - they cut off the bottom of the picture - you can't see his stick work on the snare drum anymore).<BR>My biggest gripe is the sound.  What happened ?  The sound is out of sync with the picture - it is terribly remixed. The vocals and drums have been mixed higher (and possibly added to ??) and the bass is GONE !! T.Levin's playing is great on the tape - but he is only there to watch on the DVD. Too bad.<BR>Maybe it will sound better on a 5.1 instead of a stereo - but that still won't put it in sync.

B000002AVF|5.0|Mariah's 4th studio album,Daydream,is easily tied with Butterfly for her best album to date.She slowly but surely shows that she's going to be using a lot more hip-hop and a lot more sexuality on her later album.The song&video that show both of those sides is the 1st single&video off the album,\\"Fantasy\\".Oh yeah...that video was SEXY...ANYWAY...here's my usual review of each song:<br />1.Fantasy(5/5*)-The best song off the album and one of my favorite Mariah songs.And that VIDEO!<BR>2.Underneath The Stars(5/5*)-Probably the most romanitic song on the album.And guys,if you're looking to get a date,get Daydream for this song only.<BR>3.One Sweet Day(4/5*)-I don't really get why this was Mariah's biggest hit,she's had WAY better songs.But it's still a really good song,and Mariah and Boyz II Men sound great together.<BR>4.Open Arms(5/5*)-I love the original version by Journey,and I love the remake by Mariah.<BR>5.Always Be My Baby(4/5*)-I usually love this song,but ocassionally I get kind of sick of it.<BR>6.I Am Free(5/5*)-It shows Mariah singing some gospel-based music,and I like it.<BR>7.When I Saw You(3/5*)-I like it half the time,but sometimes the music and lyrics are so lovey-dovey that it makes you sick to your stomach.<BR>8.Long Ago(5/5*)-One of Mariah's first hip-hop flavored songs,and in my opinion,one of her best.<BR>9.Melt Away(5/5*)-Like \\"Bliss(from Rainbow)\\",it's a Sade freakin' time song,but its shorter and better.<BR>10.Forever(5/5*)-The second best song on the album,and the best ballad off the album.Has sort of a 50's feel to it.<BR>11.Daydream Interlude(5/5*)-I don't usually do interludes,but this should have been a song.<BR>12.Looking In(5/5*)-Some of the best lyrics Mariah has ever written.<br />Daydream is a pretty much a win-win for Mariah.She slighty changes her sound and her image and sells 10 million copies of this album while doing it.So,if you buy it,you won't be disappointed.
B000002UAO|5.0|Some of the reactions to Rubber Soul that I have come across describe the album as important for its documentation of The Beatles' transition from the pop-hits of A Hard Day's Night, to the rock-as-art period of Sgt. Peppers.  I would argue that listening to this album strictly in the context of the complete Beatles discography is a mistake.  Rubber Soul is an organic artistic achievement that transcends the accepted critical narrative of The Beatles' musical progression.  Further, calling the album \\"transitional\\" assumes that albums like The White Album, Abbey Road and Sgt. Peppers were destinations.  While the later recordings may contain more accomplished songs, the albums themselves do not surpass the sustained effect that Rubber Soul maintains throughout an entire listening.  The later recordings find The Beatles writing some of the most influential songs in rock n' roll; however, this was a tumultuous period for the members of the group, and the creative process was not the joint effort that defined this record.  The only two albums that compete with the consistency of this one, are, in my humble opinion, Help! and Revolver. In an interview, Paul recalled that both he and John insisted on having written the bulk of \\"In My Life.\\"  This telling anecdote suggests the connection both artists had with one another while recording Rubber Soul; a connection bordering on a shared musical consciousness.  Thus, I urge Beatles fans to give the record an extra listen, accepting it not as a still-frame of the Beatles on their pilgrimage to more heavenly recordings, but rather as an arrival of the band, at a time when they were able to record a cohesive album as a functioning whole.
B000002KKS|5.0|black sabbath's first album without ozzy osbourne ,heaven and hell proved to the world that black sabbath is much more than just the band ozzy osbourne sang for.osbourne's replacement ronnie james dio voice never sounded better than on this album even though his voice on mob rules come close.neon knights,die young,children of the sea and heaven and hell are all classics.lonely is the word,lady evil and wishing well are all great songs and underrated classics at least in my opinion.the only weak track is walk away.this is a definite metal gem that no serious fan of sabbath or metal itself should be without.
B000053VAF|4.0|i've seen this movie 1 1/2 times. and i just wanan say: it's awesome! and it's so true too...like that Buddy Christ is SO sumthing those catholics would do.<BR>and it's got alot of good points in the movie from the bible that the catholics tend to hide. also, since the main chick in this movie is Jesus' great great great great great great great great great great niece, it just goes to show that jesus DID have bro's and sisters!! but that wasn't a surprise to me, since i READ the bible...something supposed &quot;christians&quot; tend not to do...<BR>but this didn't get 5 starz cuz there WERE some parts that were offensive to me. being as i'm a Christian.  <BR>but all in all this got a Four. and i would recomend this movie to anyone, but there's too much swearing. although if there wasnt, i know lotsa ppl who would appreciate the true facts from the bible in this movie!
B000002KMY|5.0|many people consider sabbath's second album with ronnie james dio,mob rules not to be as good as the first with dio ,heaven and hell.i disagree.i'm not saying mob rules is better than heaven and hell but it's just as good.they are both classics.standout tracks on this cd and my personal favorites are falling off the edge of the world,mob rules,voodoo,country girl and slipping away.the other tracks turn up the night,e5150,over and over and the sign of the southern cross are also great songs and worth a listen to.i recommend this cd to everyone.

Angels & Demons is even better than this one, but with the same Robert Langdon in charge. At any rate, get both of them, read A&D first, in possible.<br />You won't be able to put either one down. I read straight through them in  a couple of days and am now on Brown's earlier work, Deception Point.
B000002LUB|3.0|well this album certainly ain't no heaven and hell or mob rules.it is a damn good cd but there is just too many average or just plain bad songs on this cd.the excellent tracks are computer god,i,tv crimes.the average songs are after all{the dead},time machine,too late and buried alive.the weak songs are letters from earth,master of insanity and sins of the father.this is not by any means sabbath's best ,but still there is enough good quality tracks on here to give it a listen.
B00005UEAR|2.0|I can't believe I'm saying this, but I had to take back my previous review.  When I first bought Six Degrees, it just seemed so over produced compared to what I consider to be their classic work, that I was just disillusioned.  Granted, it still doesn't rank as the greatest work in their catalogue in my book, but after leaving it alone for several months (as well as purging my mind from the recent backlog of bandwaggon, stale neo-prog on the market)I came back, gave SDOIT another listen, and found myself truly enjoying it.    True, the jamming gets too long and overdone, and at times the album is just plain noisy, but, hey, it's Dream Theater, and that alone makes for much better listening than most of the sound-alike neo-metal and teen-bop emo that bombards commercial rock radio these days.    That community can scoff and smirk all they want at what they consider to be excess, but in reality even this album makes it clear that it is likely that most of those musicians (and their fans) make fun because there's no way on God's earth that they could ever play that intricately, with that much precision and unity themselves.  See them perform this material live for yourself, as I did, and it will only reenforce that point in your mind.  Saliva just couldn't do it....
B000002KIK|4.0|black sabbath's last studio album with ozzy osbourne sounds very different than any other albums with ozzy on vocals.this cd is not nearly as heavy than the other sabbath albums but still i love this cd.the best songs on this cd  are never say die,junior's eyes,air dance and swinging the chain with bill ward singing lead vocals.swinging the chain and junior's eyes being my favorites.this cd however isn't flawless over to you is a rather weak track,a hard road isn't all that great either.how about the instrumental breakout for a black sabbath fan who never heard this cd just heard this track they would never guess it's sabbath.this is a sabbath cd that some[fans}tend to overlook and that's a shame.there is some great music on this cd.
B000088E6D|5.0|Ah! I can't even begin to descibe how amazing this CD is. I love it SO MUCH. It really gets me goin' in the morning. I listne to it when I'm taking my shower and doing my makeup and it really gets me motivated. It's smooth and fresh, and so wonderful. I'd suggest anyone at all buy this CD. It's really refreshing to see someone out there who can actually sing, unless certain name-less Bubblegum Pop Queens out there. It's just truely astounding.<br />BUY THIS CD! You won't regret it!
B000002KFJ|5.0|with the exception of volume 4,this is the best black sabbath album featuring ozzy osbourne on vocals.every song on this cd is a bonafide sabbath classic.the album starts off with the kick a..,hard rockin hole in the sky.don't start{too late} is a nice short guitar piece by tony iommi that leads into the next song symptom of the universe{which is quite possibly sabbath's best track ever with osbourne on vocals},megalomania is a nine minute plus track which is a delight to the ear drums,the thrill of it all is proberly the weakest track on the cd but it is still a great track,supertzar is an very interesting track with iommi playing guitar  with an english choir singing{very strange,spooky song,but very cool song,in fact my second favorite track on the cd}am i going insane is a excellent track that i never get tired of,the albums last tune is the writ which is just as good as the other tracks on this cd.this is a must have for any fan of good hard rock music.a definite classic.
0316666343|5.0|This book was awesome!  I reccomend it to anyone at all that wants to read a good book, however give yourself a free night because almost everyone I know that has read it finished it in one sitting.
B000001EL7|5.0|this is one of kiss' greatest albums. all of the songs are great. ace frehley makes his singing debut with the excellant song &quot;shock me&quot;. if you're a beginner kiss fan i strongly recomend this album and destroyer to really get the &quot;kiss expierince&quot;
B00005JKHN|5.0|The story is a classic by every meaning of the word. Musically its based on the ballet Sleeping Beauty and uses all the music from it. It is done so well, nothing compares to it! Plus, all of it was hand drawn, no computer animation used here! If it weren't for this movie, movies like Beauty and The Beast and The Little Mermaid wouldn't exist!<br />Sleeping Beauty was a first in regards to it being stylized and it was the first animated feature done in Letterbox. Anything else before it was done in Standard Format (that means in a square shape). They actually had to draw \\"sets\\" so that the characters could move from spot to spot like in a \\"real\\" movie.<br />The fairies are a scream! Very funny stuff goin on with them. And talk about a great Disney Bad Guy; Maleficent is the best and first Villainess. She is all evil and she rocks!
B000092ZYX|1.0|...<br />Let me keep this as simple as possible: the music on this album is bad.  Really bad.  And if the you're not repulsed enough by their childish noise, maybe Tom Yorke's generic leftist, paranoid lyrics can push you over the edge.  Wow, an \\"artist\\" has something negative to say about the US government and those running the show - I'm shocked.  I'm sick of baseless ranting like this.  It's like Paul Simon said, \\"a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest...\\"<br />Avoid this album, and give up on Radiohead ever releasing another ground-breaking LP ever again - it aint gonna hapen.
1587990717|4.0|For all its elegant prose and unwelcome insights into the author's personality, Fooled By Randomness has a simple message at its core: Do not confuse the unlikely event with the impossible event, or, approximately in other words, the Black Swan theory. Indeed, blowups in financial markets are not as rare as they seem and they wreck disproportionate damage. Also, do not discount the role of luck in the financial market or in other spheres of life.<br />The book is almost semi-autobiographical in nature. Taleb writes very well and makes references to diverse intellectual arenas and personalities. He also provides insightful examples to illuminate the points he is making. He would likely provide excellent company if one were in the mood to ruminate about the markets or the role of chance in our lives. The book is an interesting and worthwhile read, and this reader highly recommends it.
B000002LND|5.0|in response to the reviewer from San Diego, this is NOT what is wrong with popular music, this is what DEFINES pop music. get your facts straight before you go running your keyboard. This album is a CLASSIC and Madonna is the queen of pop.
0792839730|5.0|As Much as I love this movie they tried to squeeze too many big names into it.In order to get these fine actors and actresses in they chopped up this movie. With the exception of the Arnhem Bridge sequences, with Anthony Hopkins and others, the flow to Cornielius Ryans book has been destroyed. It wasn't that way in Ryan's \\"The Longest Day\\". A fine performance by a younger Anthony Hopkins.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Pilot shown last, episodes left out and shown out of order. Almost no marketing, shown in a lousy timeslot on a terrible network and still created a huge fanbase of some of the most loyal people from all walks of life. Joss Whedon must have done something right...<br />Never met anyone who wasn't hooked after seeing the first couple of episodes (with the pilot and in the right order).
630469797X|5.0|Dawn of the Dead is the sequel to the superior Night of the Living Dead, and is without a doubt one of the greatest horror film of all time. Scary, horrifying, funny, intelligent, humorous and atmospheric.George Romero's 1978 follow-up to his classic Night of the Living Dead is quite terrifying and gory. But in its own way, it is just as comically satiric as the first film in its take on contemporary values. This time, we follow the fortunes of four people who lock themselves inside a shopping mall to get away from the marauding dead and who then immerse themselves in unabashed consumerism, taking what they want from an array of clothing and jewelry shops, making gourmet meals, etc. It's great. Now there's an atrocious re-make coming up, so skip the stupid re-make and see the TRUE Dawn of the Dead. Probably the greatest horror film ever.
0385507755|5.0|After reading the first five to ten pages, you want to put the book down, it's not for you. Much of the book is raw, ugly and many sections are extremely hard to read. But the story itself is raw, ugly, and hard to deal with. While reading this book, I alternately felt numb from the horrors he described and profoundly disturbed at how addiction had ravaged the humanity of him and many of his fellow patients. Frey is extremely honest in this memoir, and although you may not always like him, you will certainly respect him by the end.
B00003CXI1|2.0|Didn't like the book, didn't like the movie. Here's an event movie that holds up to being an event. This filmed version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, adapted from the wildly popular book by J.K. Rowling, stunningly brings to life Harry Potter's world of Hogwarts, the school for young witches and wizards. The greatest strength of the film comes from its faithfulness to the novel, and this new cinematic world is filled with all the details of Rowling's imagination, thanks to exuberant sets, elaborate costumes, clever makeup and visual effects, and a cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me cast, including Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, and more. Especially fine is the interplay between Harry and his schoolmates Ron and Hermione, as well as his protector, the looming Hagrid ). The second-half adventure--involving the titular sorcerer's stone--doesn't translate perfectly from page to screen, ultimately because of the film's fidelity to the novel; this is a case of making a movie for the book's fans, as opposed to a transcending film. All in all it's your typical kid flick. If you want a great fantasy film, I'd strongly suggest Lord of the Rings.
B00000099Y|4.0|The first time i ever heard of this cd, i was when a friend of mine called it \\"the best cd i own\\" I dont think that this is the best cd i own, mainly because i own a lot of amazing cds, but i do think that it is incredible. If you heard Schism on the radio and liked it, you will like Aenima. I should warn you that it is a tad bit more hardcore and loud that the material on Lateralus, but that is why i like it. It would be hard for me to pick a favourite song on this album, because they are all so good in different ways. For example: Die Eier Von Satan is the most creepy (even though it is just a brownie recipe in german!) Hooker with a penis is the moist angry and so forth. If you are unsure about buying this cd, let me assure you that you will not be dissapointed! The cover art itself is guaranteed to give you hours of fun.
B00005QIPH|1.0|How does a band with no talent get so big? The music on this CD is so unoriginal, repetitive, and boring and the vocalist sounds terrible. MTV needs to stop supporting bands that don't put any hard work and emotion into their music and start showing off bands with actual talent.
B00004Z459|1.0|Yes, ASHAMED that i own hybrid theory. I can already see the kiddies jumping up and yelling at me for saying this. I'm also ashamed that I used to consider Linkin Park good metal. My head is hanging. I am also ashamed to see that this is the first one star review for this terrible piece of junk! I liked Linkin Park because of &quot;One Step Closer&quot; which i still consider to be a decent song. It startled me when i realized why this remains to be the only decent song on the whole album... could it be because... it doesnt have that obnoxious rapper dude in it? It just might be!!!  My thought on Linkin Park is that they are attempting to be a mix of Slipknot and Limp Bizkit. Slipknot because they have a ridiculous amount of people in their band (and still cant make a good song) and Limp Bizkit because they are &quot;rap metal pop&quot; and they spell just as well. If you own this cd, give it to your little brother or sister who listens to sugary pop because it may act like a gateway for them into more hardcore music. If you dont have a little kid at home, my advice would be to run as fast as you can to the used CD store and sell it before one of your friends finds out. If you are thinking of buying it... DONT!!! Find some real metal!
0380789035|4.0|This is an enjoyable book that crosses back and forth over the line between reality and &quot;this couldn't possibly be true...but is.&quot; The cultural observations are astute if not acerbic and the &quot;gods&quot; with their ordinaryness and powers are excellently. The author excels in sustaining suspicion throughout the novel as we wonder if what we dare think could be true really is. This is a tale that shimmers just beneath the surface where most of the action lies.<br />The only problem is the main character. He never becomes as real as the other characters, perhaps due to his utterly boring persona. Still, the story of Americans who just happened to be ancient gods who play scrabble, bowl and argue is captivating. The earth-shaking finale has parallels with many others - Buffy the Vampire, Mortal Combat, X-Men - all, by the way, as American as apple pie.
B000003TAR|5.0|I was wondering a few days ago about what makes an album a work of art. I believe that by looking at In Utero, one can discover the answer to this. <BR>The first thing that makes an album truly great is the lyrics. They must be a)straight from the artist's heart, what he is actually feeling<BR>b) able to stand the test of time without losing meaning.<BR>The life (and death) of Kurt Cobain was truly tragic, and In Utero is deeply reflective of the pain he suffered near the end of his life. The song &quot;Serve the Servants&quot; is a veiled biography and describes his bad relationship with his father (&quot;i tried so hard to have a father but instead i had a dad&quot;) and other events in his life that have caused him tragedy. <BR>Many other songs follow the same pattern, but take a bit of research into Cobain's life and thought to discover how they relate to his life. <BR>Since In Utero was relesed in 1993, and the lyrics still retain meaning today, I think that it would be safe to say that they have stood the test of time.<BR>The second thing that i think makes an album to be a work of art is, obviously, the music itself. Too often you can hear an album where every song has the same music. (check out papa roach!) or a lack of music (rap) In Utero has some mellow songs and some more hardcore ones. Most of the songs on this cd follow the typical Nirvana pattern, slow verse, loud chourus, but this pattern is done so well that it does not get boring. <BR>The third thing that makes an album a work of art is the way that it flows. The mellow songs are arranged nicely aroud the loud ones. At the end of listening to the cd, you should feel that it has been completed and resolved. In Utero manages to create this feeling by having tourettes, a song composed of screaming lyrics and then a very mellow song, All Apologies at the end.<BR>The final, and most important thing about In utero is the effect that it has on you as a person. After listening to this cd, you should feel what kurt cobain is saying and feeling.
0440236738|4.0|This mystery captures the attention of the reader from the first page and manages to hold it throughout the book despite that annoying habit of jumping from scene to scene with each chapter. The story was allowed to work itself out and it came back on itself in the end - almost like a Mobius strip. <br />The biggest flaw was a common one in mystery writing - all the assumptions of the characters were proved invalid by events to which the reader had no access. In a sense it reminds one of the Soaps where the problem is resolved by the sudden appearance of the unknown twin who has just woken from a 15 year state of amnesia. This is not quite as bad but [CAUTION: STORY NOTES FOLLOW] when the sister suddenly steps out from behind the bush to tell the world the long-hidden truth and John shows up to add his version of the truth about Carly (it DOES sound like a soap) the reader can rightly call \\"Foul\\". <br />Stories with last page resolutions are a dime a dozen and in this case it's sad. The plot was well-conceived even if the main character was memorable if only for his Mr. Rogers-like manner. He remained a neutral, gray, handicapped figure who just didn't \\"get it\\" even when it was as plain as Aunt Sally's dress. <BR>Plot - A<BR>Setting - C<BR>Characters - C (the bad guy ets a B) <BR>Dialogue - B (witty at times)<BR>Resolution - D <BR>Great for a vacation
B00005B36H|4.0|You may be wondering: how can you not live without a cd? And you may answer yourself with: because its an absolute masterpiece. Now, I hate to burst any tool fans' bubbles, but Lateralus is not a masterpiece. The reason that i cant live without this, or any of the the other tool cds is because tool's dark driving music is incredibley addictive and once you hear a song from this cd and like it, it will lodge itself in your brain, drinving you crazy until you hear it again. this is not a bad thing. It is what will make you like tool. What struck me as interesting about this album in the layout. When i first got it, i thought that there was something wrong with it because there is a two minute pause between two songs. The most interesting thing about the layout is that there are two tracks, but one song. I am referring to Parabol/Parabola. Parabol is the more mellow, slow 3 minute beginning and Parabola is the louder, harder 7 minute main part. Another highlight of  Lateralus is the song Ticks and Leeches, and while it is long, it is worth it. I would encourage people to actually buy this cd instead of downloading the contents and burning it because tool is such a creative band, and the cover design is worth your money.
078322608X|5.0|Whoever selected the cast for this picture deserves an honor. There are probably fifty other actors who could have played the confused yet convincing Cole, at least a hundred who could have played the part of the endearing, made psycho and at least a thousand who could have played the female psychiatrist. But the selection of Willis, Pitt and Stowe was a stroke of genius. <br />It is difficult to imagine anyway EXCEPT Willis in the role with his befuddlement, drive and raw emotions. And Stowe's slowly evolving awareness of something impossible to believe was a sight to behold. But it was the dark story line that both set the tone and carried the movie. This film is a mystery with a little science fiction thrown in for fun. What makes it so alluring is the absence of blatant &quot;here it is&quot; storytelling. <br />Lots of inferences and off the screen suppositions.  Several scenes stand out - the shot of the NY Library, the inquisition before the panel, the final, desperate lunge and sudden remembrance...the whole effect chilling. A perfect film noire.
B000092ZYX|5.0|After purchasing Hail to the Thief, I wasn't sure what to expect from Thom Yorke and the gang, whether it be a continuation from the Amnesiac period, or a more rock like &quot;The Bends&quot; type of record.  After listening for a week or so, I was happy with the purchase and I concluded that Radiohead was infact continuing on from Amnesiac, based on their variety of electronica and computerized songs.  I was semi-disappointed because I felt like Radiohead is a bit more effective when they rock as oppose to sing depressing chants...I must admit I was confused about were Radiohead was going with Hail to the Thief.  Then I heard about the two bonus songs on the &quot;There There&quot; single cd: Where Blue Birds Fly and more importantly, Paperbag Writer.  These songs were much more Bends like, with melodies and electronic sounds that appealed to me more than most songs on Hail to the Thief.  If you want to be more satisfied with Hail to the Thief, you must hear Paperbag Writer...it's an awesome song.
0151006903|5.0|I'm a big fan of fantasy, and when I saw this work of historical fiction by famous semiotician Umberto Eco sitting on the library shelf, I knew I just had to pick it up.  Three days of pure enjoyment later, I'm glad I did.<br />In Baudolino, Umberto Eco takes the reader on a most picaresque journey through late 12th century Europe and the Near East, exploring Italy, France, the Holy Roman Empire, Byzantium, Palestine, and mythical lands of the East from one of the strangest perspectives of all- that of a complete liar, Baudolino of Alessandria, a man who made a career of self-inflation and half-truths.  Yet you can't help but love the earnestness of this lifelong liar at the end of his road, and believe his story- a work of fiction wrapped in a work of fiction!  <br />Eco writes with style and depth, as well as a dry, bawdy wit.  The historical figures parade through the story in a method that suggests a satirical self-parody, while the fictional characters seem more real than the non-fictional.  But more than just a good tale, Eco's book is a postmodern novel, in that it explores the notions of truth and meaning themselves from a contradictory perspective- one that is completely false.  The book, at it's end, leaves one with a profound meditation on the nature of truth worthy of Nietzsche.<br />Crack open the book, pour yourself a nice glass of red wine, and put some Verdi on the CD player- and prepare to enjoy one of the finest novels of the decade.
B00005JLU1|5.0|If you're like me, you were born to late for all of the great musicals, but you still love to watch them and at the same time found them a little too \\"old-fashioned\\" to relate to.  That's where movies that helped Ricky Lake become a household name such as Crybaby and Hairspray came into play.  They were \\"old-school,\\" yet they posessed enough up to date stars and character traits to hold the interest of the young and the older generations.  I personally remember watching Crybaby with my mom on several occassions when I was younger.  It is by far my favorite movie, combining musical numbers, comedy, romance, and a few decent fist-fights and car chases.  It teaches a lesson as well: You never know when the unfamiliar may end up being the best thing that ever happened to you.  I encourage you to reserve this on DVD, if only to bring it's production about.
0316666343|4.0|I began \\"reading\\" The Lovely Bones on audiotape on a long car trip. When I arrived home halfway through the tapes, I actually considered seeking out a bookstore open late at night so I could buy a cloth copy. It is a truly gripping story, and the pace, the sureness, the beauty of the prose, and the deftly drawn characters in the first half were stunning achievements.<br />But the second half of the book did not deliver upon its original promise. A major theme introduced in the first half was the detection and apprehension of the killer, whose identity the reader and Susie's father knew, but the police detective, Len, did not. The tension between Len and Susie's father was left unresolved, and while Len acknowledged his mistake, Susie's father was left viewed as a pathetic nutcase by the police, the town, and his wife.<br />The many near-misses in the search for the killer were titillating but ultimately petered into nothingness, and the danger that Lindsey was in after her courageous act was inexplicably dropped. With that lapse the story's tension dissolved and the novel began to deteriorate into the banal.<br />In the second half of the novel, Sebold focused on the emotional growth and healing of the living and the dead. These, of course, are central to the novel, but without developing and resolving the tensions in the first half, the book's skeleton falls apart. Sebold chose as her climax the satisfaction of one of Susie's unfulfilled dreams on earth. That wish fulfillment, while affecting, seemed less significant to the structure of the novel than the resolution of the father's quest for justice, retribution, and redemption in the eyes of his wife and town. Although this book is well worth reading, it ultimately left me flat and unsatisfied.

B00006RU5B|1.0|Unlike most people, I had no preconceptions on how Audioslave is supposed to sound. Most will assume that their sound would fall into a RATM / Soundgarden thing. Unfortunately this seems to be the exact idea that Audioslave had when creating this miserable thing. Can Morello play those RAGE riffs? - YES, Can Cornell still do his awesome yell? - YES<br />What Am I getting at? It sounds like most of the songs were strung together with Cornell wailing around Morello's riffs and with the exception of I am The Highway, there is no attempt to create any meaningfull songs, no attempt to create something other that a generic pile of junk. The band is playing it safe - Tom gives a blues scale run and Chris yells. Even the mellower songs seem malformed and Cornell more than often sounds detached (though he still posseses a fine voice). Another thing that bugs me is the production. Rick Rubin's approach is too safe and tame.  There is something really lacking in the albums sound.<br />Audioslave have arrived in no-mans-land. They aren't as lush as Soundgarden and will not appeal to those seeking the aggression of RATM. Those who wanted a fresh rock album won't be satisfied either and would be advised to look elsewhere.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Having missed seeing this film in the theatre because of 20th Century Fox's terrible advertising campaign, I decided to rent it on DVD.  After my first viewing, I didn't know what I had seen but I knew I liked it. So I watched it again.<br />I have to say that I think this one amazing, powerful little film.  While I did not get every clue as to what was going on, I understood enough to see how clever this movie and story is.<br />Basically this film is about a corruption in the timeline ... where an object from the future gets transported into the past ... and the need for reality to \\"fix\\" itself before everything collapses by manipulating characters directly and indirectly ... shaping reality so that the events that cause the tangental universe to occur actually happen ... plugging the hole, so to speak.<br />Now I realized, for the most part, what was going on ... but I have many friends who did/do not.  This is a very obscure movie ... where you have to figure out what is going on as the characters are doing so ... some clues are obvious ... others not.<br />Regardless, I would recommend reading the book \\"The Philosophy of Time Travel\\" which can be found on [...] or at [...] ... additionally this second site has a synopsis that explains what is going on in this film.<br />Read this information and then watch the film again ... you will see that everything makes sense ... everything seen or said has a purpose (in terms of fixing the tangental universe) ...<br />I just wish that this film had been given a better chance in the theatre ... thank god for DVD.
B000092ZYX|1.0|The acclaim this band constantly gets no matter what they put out is mind boggling. Sure it is very nice when a band is daring and progresses from one album to the other - Radiohead has come along quite well since their debut. &quot;The Bends&quot; was a very good alt-rock album, &quot;OK Computer&quot; evolved them even further with some nice mixes of guitar and electronica. &quot;Kid-A&quot; saw them delve completely into the electronica realm and although it didn't appeal to me, I accept it as another avenue in their musical map.<br />Listening to this latest output, I suddenly realised that Radiohead is more comfortable in making sounds for analysis rather than for enjoyment. While everyone is scratching their skulls trying to figure it out, I ask myself what is so unique or enticing about them in 2003 ?<br />To me their approach is becoming pretty obvious: Put together some dissonant guitar and piano chords, throw in some atonal vocals and mix it with electronica. This kind of stuff is found in ample amounts on your local community radio late-nite ambient show. The critics naturaly wet themselves over this as anything unconventional is hailed as genious regardless whether it makes sense to them or not.<br />HTTF lacks all the elements for a captivating listen and there is little effort to actually write any song that will pull you in. It comes across as cold, clinical and calculated. The general rule in music is that you don't screw around too much with dissonance. The best musicians know exactly when and how to include it in their music. Radiohead of today dwells almost entirely in that forbidden zone and as a result their music has lost appeal and emotion. Radiohead have finally succumbed to their indulgences.
B00004X01U|5.0|In Madonna's 9th album, \\"Music\\" opens the kick-... dance cd that is fantastic for a night at a club, or if you just wanna have some fun! \\"Music\\" definately fits into this 'kick-...-dance' category, and it's totally great! Other good songs are #7, Don't Tell Me, and #8, What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" and #10 Gone are my favorite songs. You should buy this cd!!! And, While you're there, buy Madonna's new CD \\"American Life\\". They are both great. Make A trip to Best Buy!!!
B000089RVX|4.0|Maybe the nu-metal scene is already packed, but this band brings something new to the table: Beautifull female vocals.<br />The music is something you would expect from &quot;Linkin Park&quot; and bands as such, so there is nothing really new or surprising. The similarity to Linkin Park comes more obvoius in track #2 with 12 Stones' singer rapping.<br />What this band has that other nu metal bands don't is Amy's beautyfull singing behind it. She is definitely a talented singer, and makes this CD worth checking out.<br />Yet again, the guitars are too simple, makes me think that this band has more potential, more than what's used in this album.
0385504209|4.0|For what it is, this book is great.  While I don't really read mystery/suspense books because I find many of them mindless, Dan Brown has incorporated all the elements of a good suspense novel with numerous interesting facts about art and history.  It may not be for anyone, but if you've ever wandered the halls of the Louvre or even the Met, you're bound to find it enthralling!
B00008H2LB|4.0|Maybe I'm growing up and leaving nu metal behind (I don't like \\"Hibrid Theory\\" as much now), but this album is not as good as the radio singles predict.<br />Linkin Park used what they do best: catchy rap verses with melodic sing-along choruses. The only problem is that the formula gets boring after a while.<br />THere are different songs, one is pure hip-hop, the last track is pure rock, and a few more experimental tracks. Other than that the album goes on what Hibrid Theory did, recreating it, but going further in it.<br />I liked the album, and I recomend it to whoever liked Hibrid Theory, yet again if you didn't don't think that these kids have grown up...<br />Highlights: \\"Faint\\"
B000002UAO|5.0|This is the last Beatles album before the divergence in the taste and style of the four members became an issue. There's a unity of flavor here that's a joy to experience.<br />If you know the music, you don't need me to tell you why you want this. If you don't, this is a great place to start.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw's debut album is sensational!!!  <BR>He has totally honed his skill as a NYC musician and his voice is more than worth hearing live.  He is touring right now and playing small venues according to his web site gavindegraw.com, I would see him now up close while you have the chance.  If you into real music and original song writing pick up this album now.

The downfalls, the trials, the hope, the love...a part near the end where Susie has a dream come true is so beautiful in it's entirety that it brought me to tears.  All i can say is that you MUST read this book.

I would highly reccommend this movie if you enjoy intelligent comedy---and I certainly would reccommend seeing it before an American/English version comes out---a movie this good, you know they will try to remake it!!<br />P.S.  If there are any French teachers out there, this is a great one to use for listening/comprehension exercise as well.  It's rich with lots of first/second year vocab, and easily understood.  And your students will be entertained as well!  No moans or groans here!!

B000001Y16|5.0|The 7 Day Theory is Pac's second best album, behind the untouchable All Eyez On Me. This is my 3rd favorite album of all-time, behind All Eyez On Me & Reasonable Doubt. It is amazing how such a perfect album could be put together in just 7 days.<BR>1. Intro/Bomb First (My Second Reply): This is a diss to all the East Coast rappers Pac had beef with. I think this is one of the best songs on the album.<br />2. Hail Mary: Everyone has heard 50, Eminem & Busta's version dissin Murder Inc. but Pac's version is better. Everyone wants to be 2Pac and who could blame em? Listen to the song if u haven't heard it yet. This & Me & My Girlfriend made me buy this album before I heard the other songs.<br />3. Toss It Up: This is another one of my favorites. Two themes in this song. First he talks about (lovin)this girl and in the last verse he's dissin Dr. Dre for leavin Death Row.<br />4. To Live & Die In L.A.: Another diss to Dr. Dre. This is one of the best songs on the CD, if not THE best. Kinda laid back track as far as the hook and the verses are typical Pac. He describes life in LA on this track.<br />5. Blasphemy: Different theme, but I'm feelin it. Makaveli talks about the guidelines of the game and talks about thug life. The theme reminds me of Troublesome 96, with a totally different twist.<br />6. Life Of An Outlaw: Damn I LOVE this song. Don't get it twisted, I love the Outlaws but this song woulda been better if it was just Makaveli rappin. The beat compliments hisstyle more than the Outlaws. I still love it though.<br />7. Just Like Daddy: This is the love song that even a guy isn't ashamed to bump. Pac lets Khadafi shine on this, lettin him flow for 2 verses. Pac does the best though on it. Guys, trust me...your girl will love this hahah<br />8. Krazy: This song's hot too. Makaveli tries explainin how life is crazy for a thug. But it sounds like he's trying to keep his head on straight at the same time. I can't explain it well, just listen to it.<br />9. White Man'z World: This is a real hot song, even though I'm not black. He respects his black people, especially the ladies. He apologies for callin them names and he's tellin us how hard life is for black people.<br />10. Me And My Girlfriend: This is one of the most original concepts I've ever heard. It sounds almost like a ghetto love song, but he's really rapping about his gun. If I didn't tell you, would you have known??<br />11. Hold Ya Head: He's tellin you to do just that...Hold Ya Head. Even when life can become real hard, \\"you got to hold ya head\\"<br />12. Against All Odds: One of the verses will sound familiar to you, if you up on the mixtape scene. 50 Cent uses a verse from here on Hail Mary 2003...I'ma big 50 fan but I wasn't feelin that at all.  I still like Nas, Mobb Deep & Jay-Z though. Even though Makaveli made em look like fools.
0380789019|4.0|I was impressed with this book.  Initially, I didnt really know what to expect, but went ahead with it anyway, and it turns out that I really liked it.  During reading the novel, most of it all seemed just to be an amalgamation of neat ideas and good characters, but in the end surprisingly, it all comes together very wittily (its a word now) and very believable.  I loved the end, where the character doesnt neccesarily make the &quot;right&quot; decision, but makes the decision we all would make.<br />As far as how it was written, I loved it.  It was lyrical and descriptive and beautiful.  Nothing confused me like i was afraid it would after reading so many reviews.<br />All of the characters, except for an underdeveloped few, i loved.  Richard was great, you could really see his journey to discover himself and what he really wanted out of life. Door was an interesting character, very enigmatic and Hunter is a great one, hardcore and a warrior to the last minute.  The Marquis, although my least favorite personally, is an interesting character as well.  <br />Overall, there are things i would want to see more of (The Velvets, more Richard, more on Door, more on Islington) but it was a great read regardless!
B000088E6P|4.0|I've been a 50 fan since he first dropped. Not last year but way back in '98 when he dropped How To Rob. I didn't forget about him when he got shot 9 times. I was just waiting for him to back stronger than ever, which he has. I'm not gonna front and say he is one of the best of all-time, cuz he's not. He's not one of the best lyrically either. But there's something about 50 that makes him such an entertaining rapper. He is clever and has potential to go down as a rapper everyone will remember. (example: \\"Shorty, I been watchin you watchin me/ Now you tell me what you like more, my watch or me\\" from 'U Not Like Me') <br />I've had this album before it dropped in February and it's still in rotation in my stereo. We've all heard Wanksta, In Da Club and 21 Questions by now but there's much more on this album to talk about. Personally, I feel the whole album is bangin except for two songs and the intro. Wanksta is real annoying now, but I guess I can listen to it sometimes still. Gotta Make It To Heaven is hot lyrically, but that beat really annoys the hell outta me. <br />I own every G-Unit song ever released (underground or mainstream) and I think 50 should have used G-Unit members Tony Yayo and Lloyd Banks a little more. They really have potential to be big in this game. Lloyd Banks ripped it on Don't Push Me, and Eminem did too. What Up Gangsta is a song for all them cats on tyhe street to bump in their cars. Many Men and Heat are probably my favorite tracks on the CD. High All The Time is a good song to bump when your blazin a fatty. Back Down is a hot diss track to Ja Rule. The beef goes back quite a while, not just right before Ja dropped his latest flop. That's when Ja actually decided to open his mouth about 50, tryna promote his album cuz 50 was catchin fire in the streets at the time. If I Can't, Blood Hound and P.I.M.P. are real hot songs. Poor Lil Rich is a hot song with a pretty sick beat and even hotter lyrics. The bonus tracks are old songs 50 was supposed to release back in the day but didn't cuz he lost his deal after he got shot. These tracks (U Not Like Me & Life's On The Line)are straight fire. Not many people really knows that Life's On The Line is an older Ja Rule diss, going back to the days when Ja was tryna say he beat the sh*t outta 50 with a baseball bat. <BR>Listen to the song, you can tell who it's about. Below is my track rating (1-5): <br />1. Intro -- Not rated since its like 7 seconds of a coin droppin<BR>2. What Up Gangsta -- 5<BR>3. Patiently Waiting (feat. Eminem) -- 4.5<BR>4. Many Men (Wish Death) -- 5<BR>5. In Da Club -- 4 <BR>6. High All the Time -- 4<BR>7. Heat -- 5<BR>8. If I Can't -- 5<BR>9. Blood Hound (feat. Young Buck) -- 5<BR>10. Back Down -- 4.5<BR>11. P.I.M.P. -- 5<BR>12. Like My Style (feat. Tony Yayo) -- 5<BR>13. Poor Lil Rich -- 5<BR>14. 21 Questions (feat. Nate Dogg) -- 4.5<BR>15. Don't Push Me (feat. Lloyd Banks & Eminem) -- 5<BR>16. Gotta Make It to Heaven -- 5<BR>17. Wanksta -- 3<BR>18. U Not Like Me --5 <BR>19. Life's On The Line -- 5<br />If you like the 'gangsta' songs on the album or U Not Like Me and/or Life's On The Line, peep 50's 'Guess Who's Back'. That's an album which is basically the greatest street hits of 50. It's also the album that Eminem heard and gained interest in 50. Then he decided to sign him and now Shady Records ALMOST gives Death Row a run for its money for the label with the most talent at one time.
B00009V8Z9|4.0|This album has it all!  Gavin has all the right notes and each song is better then the last.  This is an amazing CD by an amazing singer and song writer.
B00003XAQ5|5.0|This is so simple. If you like jazz, you probablly already own this album. If you kinda like jazz, buy this album. If you don't like jazz, well buy this album.<br />Seriously though, this is my second favorite favorite albums. (My most favorite is Joe Pass' Virtuoso, but hey, I'm a guitarist.) If you haven't really heard jazz and you want to see if you like it, pick up this, and maybe Coltrane's Blue 'Trane or Giant Steps. The music on here is all amazing. The band is the best band ever assembled. Each musician is one of the best in the planet at their instrument. Bill Evans is my favorite piano player, and guess what, Wynton Kelly is one of my other favorites and he's on there for a song too!!! Coltrane, Adderly Cobb, there all masters! I have listen to this album at least a couple thousand times. I have only found ONE flaw. ONE! In Flaminco Sketches, the volume gets a little louder, around, oh, I'd say the 2:30 mark. Thats it. I can't find anything wrong with the playing. Usually, when I'm listening to a record, I say, oh this might sound better, or I would of done this. But I can't with this album. This album is heaven, cuz god must be a Miles fan.
B00005JLTN|3.0|I really want to give this movie 4 stars but I can't for the same reasons others have stated here: The Zion rave scene, the Neo/Trinity love scene, and to a lesser extent the rags that most of the cast and extra's wear for costumes. The latter is a relatively minor inconsistency that I can overlook, even though the Zion traffic controllers seemed to be impeccably costumed. The first two points of detraction were an utter waste of film and time that I don't understand why they were not cut. Probably some studio pin head forced those two scenes to be kept for the teenage audience. Still, I would imagine that there are some in that group that will find these scenes just as much a waste of time.<br />If you can get past that, and I have, then you'll find that there is a lot more than meets the eye on subsequent viewings. For instance, the number of members of the Zion council is 23. The exact number of chromosomes that we all carry, and the fact that Neo must choose them: 17 women and 6 men. Are the members of the council the original individuals that Neo chooses each time Zion has been destroyed? Once I realized that, really by accident, I went from being mildly dissapointed with the film to being highly intrigued by what else might be hidden in plain sight within the film.<br />I'll close with one last minor criticism that in no way detracts from the film as a whole. That is the use of CGI in the fight scene in the square after the Oracle has left. At times it was too obvious. I think that the brothers should have stuck to the live action wire work in the fight scenes that made The Matrix such an eye popping spectacle. I give the film 3-1/2 stars.
0316666343|2.0|I bought this book based on reviews from friends and  from magazine reviews that all said it was great.  I liked the general idea of the story, that Susie is murdered and looks on from heaven, but found the rest of the story to be forced.  That Ray still lusts for Susie after one kiss when they are 13 is unrealistic.  I would have liked for there to be more about what Susie's heaven was like and to have understood more about the emotions that the mom went through.<br />Overall, this book ws a big disappointement.  I'm afraid that everyone is reading it and making it more popular based off of hype rather than real quality.
0780627024|5.0|I love this movie. It is everything that this world needs to be.<br />I love Reese Witherspoon and Tobey Maguire. They are excellent in this movie. It reminds me of Leave it to Beaver. I only wish that we could all have a little bit of pleasantville in our towns. I would recommend this movie to anybody who loves to watch movies that make them feel good. The ending is confusing because you don't know if Betty will stay with Bill or not but I still love the movie anyway.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Im a huge Chris Cornell fan, meaning this album was always going to be on my shopping list for 2002. To me he was the best vocalist, technically and in performance, to emerge from the Seattle movement, as well as being one of its most talented and prolific songwriters, hands down. The main problem I experienced with the idea of this supergroup initially was that I never particularly admired Rage Against the Machine. Sure, all their albums currently reside in my house, although they dont belong to me, and as I havent been under a rock on mars for the past decade Ive heard a lot of their material, but their ethos and musical style never attracted me in any notable way. This said, Tom Morello's guitar playing always struck me as original and inventive, two qualities lacking in so much music today. So Audioslave were very much a viable proposition for my money. Right now I should confess I got a hold of most of this record in its original 'Civilian' demo form. More on that later.<br />'Audioslave' is a strong, at times wonderful, post grunge record. The songs still sound closer to RATM than Soundgarden, mainly due to Morello's recognisable guitar sound, and this album certainly doesnt touch 'Superunknown' , but there are great tracks here. Cornell is on fine form, and his songs here, generally the slower ones, retain a Soundgarden feel while seeming informed and touched by his fantastic,lo-fi 'Euphoria Morning' solo set. 'Like a Stone' and 'I am the Highway' are among the strongest cuts here, as is the closing,'The Last Remaining Light', which is my standout track from the record. It is trippy and different sounding, almost Screaming Trees or 'Upside' era Soundgarden-esque. 'What You Are', a highly melodic rocker with the albums strongest chorus, is my other favourite selection. Lead single 'Cochise' is strong, if sounding uncannily like 'Whole Lotta Love' at times. The rest of the album is filled out by more driving, up tempo rock tunes. This, I believe, is the fatal flaw to Audioslave. Much of the album sounds far too similar, and while the songs are strong ('Shadow on the Sun', 'Light My Way', 'Show me how to Live'), theres not nearly enough variety or experimentation to merit a five star rating. Many of the songs are formulaic: intro, Morello riff, quiet verse, loud chorus, quiet middle eight, chorus to end. This phenomenon should be all too familiar to RATM fans (and detractors).<br />Audioslave is a great album, mainly due to Cornell's legendary voice and a handfull of inspired songs. One just feels a band comprised of musicians of this calabre was capable of so much more. The original Civilian demo was rawer, rougher and better set out track wise, as well as containing 'Turn To Gold', an absolute gem of a song inexplicablly absent here.<br />Audioslave is recommended, just be wary of pitfalls, and dont expect another 'Superunknown'law to Audioslave.

B00005OWEG|5.0|Without glorifying war, barbarism, and death, Apocalypse Now allowed the average moviegoer a glimpse into the minds of soldiers in combat.  This glimpse penetrates into the subconscious nature of war, as a primordial current driving men to kill one another, driven by a pure will to power (to borrow Nietzsche's phrase) versus the will to survive.  Redux penetrates further and wider by examining the social, historical, and mythical dimensions of the will to power.  The sequences with the  French colonialists, the Playboy bunnies, and the stolen surf boards define these themes more clearly and the film's conclusion materializes much more clearly than in the originally released version of this great movie.<br />The DVD itself is fine.  It does not have extensive special features but the video and sound transfers are very good.  The menus are clear and easy to navigate.  If your goal is to own this movie, not a lot of commentary, this DVD should serve very well.  I am satisfied with mine.
B00009V7RF|5.0|Elephunk is off the wall; this is one of the best albums i've ever heard.  BEP's affective use of varieties of hip-hop and funk sounds lead to pure listening pleasure.  They mix some of the most positive and creative rhymes in with sensational beats on this 13 track album.  Will.i.am and Apl.de.ap of bep were the leaders in the creation Elephunk, and they left no room for improvement; I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys new sounds and diverse hip-hop music.  Elephunk ROCKS!...literally:  track 12 \\"anxiety\\" displays bep and papa roach's talents as the hip-hop and rock blend together to form a hardcore song.
B000069AUI|5.0|This is a wonderful album; moody, atmospheric, melodic, and, most importantly, sincere.  There is something universal in the lyrics without being overtly sentimental.  In terms of melody, most of the songs are penetrating and linger in the mind.  Not only that, but the songs seem to go together well, so each one follows the preceding song in a kind of pattern that fits perfectly.  This is an album you listen to even when the stereo is off; a classic in the making.  As far as musical influences, there are many, but I hear mostly U2, Radiohead, Philip Glass, and the Beatles ... not too shabby.
B00008LDPU|2.0|I rented this because I could not decide whether or not to buy it.  I had been extremely disappointed over the Matrix Reloaded and I did not want to make a costly mistake.  Renting was a good idea.  While better than the movie, these shorts suffered from too many ideas that were not explored properly.  Everything seemed a bit too rushed.  The animation varied from exquisite to downright revolting.<br />I was unimpressed with Final Flight of the Osiris.  Photo realistic animation does not work with Human characters!  Give it up!  The characters looked embalmed and reanimated.  I do not want to see computer animated butts with skin that looks like it has the consistency of jellyfish. There is nothing alive about these characters.  They are too perfect.  They don't move like beings who are related to the Great Ape family tree.  Speed up any video of live human beings and our side to side, arm swinging ape like walk is unmistakeable.  Plus someone has to give these animators acting lessons.  Because that is what they have to become in order to try and give realistic reactions to these mannequins.  A well timed smirk is not acting!<br />Anyway, the best of the lot was Beyond.  I was impressed with the animation and the story.  It brought the Matrix world into ours by focusing on a girl next door type, her cat and the neighborhood kids.  The incorporation of the haunted house archtype was genius!  That look into the black nothing of the matrix hole was terrifying!  I wanted to know more about these kids.  What did the agents do to them?<br />The rest of the shorts, I could take or leave.<br />This is definately a rental!  Do not buy!
B00005U18E|2.0|Since when is size 12 overweight??? I thought Bridget Jones was supposed to be, well, fat. They made such a huge hype about Renee Zellwegger stacking it on for this role, but if that is what Hollywood thinks is fat, then normal women have no chance at all.
B00007ELEL|4.0|In what has to be the most brilliantly disjointed and anarchic look at the alienation, apathetic stupor, and pedestrian self-absorption of the pathetic Southern California lifestyle ever filmed, the two Coen brothers (`Fargo') produced and directed this near `cult' film to explore the plethora of cultural cop-outs parading as lifestyles in this zany yet affectionate look at a totally burned out and yet eminently likeable basket case  by the name of Jeff Lebowski, who is played masterfully by Jeff Bridges, in yet another of his consistently underestimated character portrayals. Lebowski prefers to go by his street name of \\"Dude\\", and seems to be the ultimate California case of a one-time fairly intelligent `n'er-do-well' now perpetually down on his luck and reduced to only occasional flashes of clarity and full functioning after way too many years of sex, drugs, and rock and roll, and then some more drugs tossed in on the side.<br />The Coens' penchant for offbeat characters is having a field day here, with everyone in the cast allowed to vent in a kind of wacko 'Disneyland on the strip' approach to making the endless days of gorgeous LA sunshine pass, as our protagonist finds trouble in the promised land. Particularly memorable here is John Goodman weighing in as the paranoid and unpredictably violent Walter Sobchak, the `Dude's' best friend and perpetual bowling partner. The holy ceremony of bowling and the seriousness that it plays in the lives of the several losers like the Dude, Sobchak, and the preening eccentric Jesus Quintana (a wonderfully over-the-top John Turturro) and the rest of the motley crew on the Dude's team provides a kind of key that unlocks the mystery of their uniformly alienated, pointless, and directionless lives, as each tumbles from crisis to crisis, and with each attempt that Dude makes to cope with the circumstances that mysteriously start to swirl around his drug addled self-absorption and wake him into a groggy yet sober recognition that something very serious and potentially deadly is going on around him, he is repeatedly sabotaged and blind-sided by the myopic and near-psychotic antics of his friends.<br />Dude seems to approach crisis management as an exercise in spin control, and tries, sometimes quite ingeniously, to talk his way out of the staccato violence that punctuates his days with increasingly urgent frequency. But as the mystery deepens and Lebowski is sucked farther into the quicksand of coincidences, mistaken identities, and sheer madness that lurks just beneath the cover of these friendly skies, we are introduced to the powers and the principalities that are driving the madcap antics and the increasing shrill intensities of everyone but the Dude. The plot often seems disjointed, yet in a macabre way that seems to shout that not only is truth sometimes stranger than fiction, it is sometimes absolutely insane. Yet it eventually resolves itself into a semi-rational resemblance to plausible reality, or at least almost. And one walks way from the outstanding ensemble cast's performance thinking that something magic and allegorical has happened here, and it is perhaps exactly the insanity of the proceeding activity that is the point. They are indeed, every last one of them, just California crazy! This is a wild roller coaster of a film experience, but one absolutely worth the taking. Buckle up, kids, you're in for a bumpy ride!

But as the mystery deepens and Lebowski is sucked farther into the quicksand of coincidences, mistaken identities, and sheer madness that lurks just beneath the cover of these friendly skies, we are introduced to the powers and the principalities that are driving the madcap antics and the increasing shrill intensities of everyone but the Dude. The plot often seems disjointed, yet in a macabre way that seems to shout that not only is truth sometimes stranger than fiction, it is sometimes absolutely insane. Yet it eventually resolves itself into a semi-rational resemblance to plausible reality, or at least almost. And one walks way from the outstanding ensemble cast's performance thinking that something magic and allegorical has happened here, and it is perhaps exactly the insanity of the proceeding activity that is the point. They are indeed, every last one of them, just California crazy! This is a wild roller coaster of a film experience, but one absolutely worth the taking. Buckle up, kids, you're in for a bumpy ride! Enjoy!
B000001Y9I|5.0|After hearing that Blackmore had left Deep Purple, I really didn't want to give this album a chance. I'm just as disappointed as anybody that Ritchies gone, but this album is definately not a loss. I think this album is a great compilation of songs (even though I think Cascades should have been on The Battle Rages On (another great album)). I couldn't find one &quot;filler&quot; or sub-par song. I like what Morse brings to the group, and especially this album, but I am a die-hard Blackmore fan, and its just not the same. It's a new beginning for Deep Purple, but change isn't always bad.
B000002VRZ|5.0|A good starting point for those unacquainted with the Outlaws and excellent collection of favorite/familiar tunes for fans.  The mastering is crisp and clean which complements the crisp Fender guitar sounds. This offering has substantial representation by both Hughie Thomasson and Henry Paul.  And yes, I admit to liking &quot;Green Grass and High Tides&quot; (so sue me). While I wish Thomasson and Paul would contribute some new Outlaws music, I guess that's like wishing that Larry Niven would write a new novel comparable to Ringworld.  At least we have these recordings...
B000099T2L|5.0|I have to admit, I still have a twinge of dislike for beyonce, and it can get bigger if Beyonce does something that provokes it. But, I am not disloyal to great music, I am still a Destiny's Child fan to the heart, she and Kelly Rowland both have stellar Debut CD's. Although I didn't purchase Kelly's CD, But beyonce's Cd I was not disappointed. I ended up buying the Cd twice because it is worth the money. The wackiest song on the LP is \\" Crazy in love\\" I hate that song. \\" Naughty Girl\\" it sounds different and no one has ever done a song like it, a mid up tempo beat and lyrics that demonstrates Beyonce's sexual personality. \\"Baby boy\\" is my least favorite as well, because her attempt to outdo Blu Cantrell is non-comparison. Blu Cantrell \\" breathe\\" featuring Sean Paul, makes \\" Baby boy\\" seem like a third grader anthem, I don't know why this song is the second single, what was Beyonce thinking? Hip hop star is the Foxy it should be dedicated to all the men and women who are obsess with beyonce Knowles, its nice. Favorite song on the CD is \\" speechless\\" and \\"daddy\\" and \\"yes\\".<br />Disappointed in that Catty voice, she can't sing in that Catty voice live, after a while her voice is annoying, and her lyrics are no rembred  only reason I give this Cd Five stars is because I gave Ashanti four stars and Beyonce's CD is better.
B000089RVX|2.0|Music for the most part sounds like Linkin Park and many songs sound the same. Scoring: 1 Star for A great Female voice and 1 star for the frequent piano- power chord guitar mix = 2 stars.<BR>Order the single.

This is the Africa I miss and the Africa the reader gets a taste of in this book.<br />I too cannot wait to read the whole series.  What a joy it was to read.  Enjoy!!!
B000069AUI|5.0|When I first heard &quot;Yellow&quot; for the first time it was on MTV2 and I was just floored by the music.  I practically ran to the CD store to grab a copy of Parachutes.  I've listened to it a million times since then and I'm still not sick of it.  Then A Rush of Blood to the Head came out and it was amazing.  They have clearly outdone their previous album with this.  &quot;The Scientist&quot; is a beautiful melody that makes it clear why it is one the favorites off of this album.  But I have to say my favorite is &quot;Clocks&quot; I used to hear it all over the place but never could figure out who did it, it was driving me crazy.  Then when I picked this album up imagine my suprise to find that the mystery song I was in love with was played by one of my favorite bands.  In short, pick this up.  You don't want to miss out on this great album.
B000099T2L|3.0|With as much hype and great review this album has been getting I was really excited about it.  But it's really nothing great.  I hate the song &quot;Daddy&quot; the first time I heard it all I did was roll my eyes after every other line.<br />The best song on this album is of course &quot;Crazy In Love&quot;.  I recommend getting the single instead.  I t also has a great b-side called &quot;Summertime&quot;.  &quot;Summertime&quot; should have been on the album instead of a number of ones that did are on it.
0385504209|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. Loved the detailed descriptions and the cultural aspects of the book as much as the suspense.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Overall I was pleased with the Daredevil movie when it was released, (with the exception of some of the CG work that appeared towards the end of the film and that fight scene in the playground) I thought it was enjoyable. However, what I am especially happy about (and one of the main reasons I love DVD) is the 2nd disc contains interviews with those people who have had a huge influence on the development of the character and on comics in general. The comics, after all, represents the source material for this film and films like it, so it's nice to finally see these people getting the attention and respect they deserve. Great job on the DVD 20th century Fox - keep up the good work!
B00006879E|5.0|SO I bought this cd over 6 months ago and it has only left my cd player in my car when I take it inside my house to listen to it.  Maroon 5 has such an awesome sound and believe it or not they are even better live.
B00005JKPF|5.0|...Now to my review. LOVED IT!!! With a capitol \\"L\\" it was everything the first was not. {Storm's} hair looked more natural (although I don't know why they just won't give Halle the blue contacts to complete the authenticity of her character) {Wolverine} is TOUGH and very seldom gets his [booty] kicked this particular episode has a lot to do with him, {Jean Gray} was totally a bad... in this one there was stuff going on with her that will lead into her metamorphous in this series so pay attention to what is happening to her, {Scott} didn't have that big of a role this time (but at least he didn't get his [booty] kicked to bad LOL) {Magneto} was actually not to much of the bad guy in this one...... key verbage here is NOT TO MUCH. {Mystique} was AWESOME had me actually cheering for her at some point in the movie... she is a slippery one though :) {Lady Deathstrike} was perfect and gorgeous, it's good to see this actress after the flop of the Scorpion King, although she doesn't say much which is kind of a bummer.<br />I'm so late in leaving a review that I am sure many before me have went into GREAT detail about the plot so I won't. I'll just say that I found this to be EXCELLENT!!! it gave me everything that I needed in a Science Fiction/Superhero Flix great plot, storyline plausible, things just made SENSE, our Heroes got to use/demonstrate their powers more than they did in the 1st the ending set it up for the next movie. There wasn't to much violence IMO and it was worth the money.<br />Respectfully Reviewed
B000067CPX|5.0|The title says it all, really, but this is an album that just gives me more and more every time I listen to it. I'm not really a fan of the pre-Mother's Milk Chilis, but after that I think their evolutionary process has been a pleasure follow.<BR>I've listen to this album on the beaches of the South of France, the Canary Islands and travelling around Spain, though it sounds beautiful anywhere! I didn't think it possible that a recently released CD could make it nearly to the top of my all time favourite albums, but it has. Makes me feel great when I feel good, and better when I feel low! All this and a simple throwaway title like 'By The Way'!
B00008BXJG|5.0|AC/DC's final effort with singer Bon Scott, and their 4th album release (not counting the Australian versions of T.N.T. and High Voltage) is AC/DC's finest album of all time. What makes it so good is new producer John \\"Mutt\\" Lange, who improved Bon Scott's vocal sound, making it raw and raspy. He really took a leap above Vanda and Young's producing with this album- he really made the \\"gang\\" choruses sung by Malcolm and Cliff more prominent. This is what made a great album even better, in my opinion. The slick production. The songs are great, too, including their radio hit \\"Highway to Hell\\", and others such as \\"Shot Down In Flames\\" and \\"Girls Got Rhythm\\". \\"If You Want Blood (You've Got It)\\" is also a great tune with a nice chorus. Not really a weak track on here. All killer, no filler. AC/DC sounds their wildest on this album and Bon sounds like a madman! His lyrics on here still haven't lost any of their bite. And soon after this album Bon died, which is a sad thing, because even though AC/DC was great with Brian Johnson, they were even better with Bon. It was a sad and dissapointing thing, his death. And for this new Digipak reissue and remaster, it is great. I have the LP version and this sounds just as great, if not better. The sound is crisp, with good bass and drum sounds. It also comes with a 16 page booklet with liner notes and rare photos from the band. It's too bad the booklet dosn't come with lyrics for all the songs, but you can easily find them on the internet. for the digipak, it wears easily, but looks nice and is very attractive. This album is a excellent first choice for those new to AC/DC, and a must own veteran fans of the band (who most likely already have it in some form or another) Happy listening, and Malcolm rocks!
B000002LE6|5.0|Of all time? Yep. No one paid attention when Prince produced this transcendent pop/funk/gospel/r&b sensation. What else is there to say other than, \\"It's really great, buy it today.\\"
B00007ELEL|4.0|Jeff Bridges does not play the title role in &quot;The Big Lebowski.&quot;  Bridges plays the Dude; David Huddleston plays the Big Lebowski, a rich guy with a young trophy wife named Bunny (Tara Reid).  The problem is that the Dude and the Big Lebowski have the same name, which explains why when Bunny runs up debts the moronic pair sent to collet money from her husband end up at the house of the wrong Lebowski.  From that moment on the Dude's life gets very confusing and he is clearly the person least capable of dealing with this confusion of anybody in the greater Los Angeles area,<br />&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is only disappointing because it is the first film the Coen Brothers came out with after &quot;Fargo.&quot;  When you make a masterpiece it is hard to follow-up with something equally strong.  Even &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; suffers in comparison to &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; and whatever happened to the guy who made &quot;Titanic&quot;?  However, if &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; came out after &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; nobody would have batted an eye.  Not just because they both deal with a kidnapping that may or may not be a kidnapping, but also because the Coen Brothers have rounded up many of the usual familiar faces from their other films for this endeavor.<br />There are two main questions in this film.  The first is &quot;What is going on?&quot;  Repeatedly the Dude sits down and explains to his friends Walter (John Goodman) and/or Donny (Steve Buscemi) what he thinks is going on, or Walter takes a stab at it, and the odds are that sooner or later they are going to get it right.  Just do not put money down on it.  The second is what, if anything, the Dude will have left at the end of this meandering story.  You get the feeling that chances are neither the Dude nor his car are going to get out of this one alive and that his friends are as much a threat to the Dude (and his car) as the growing number of enemies who keep popping up through the festivities.  If only the Dude did not own a rug that really pulled his apartment together, then he might have been spared a lot of pain and frustration.<br />&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is a film that will grow on you, especially once you get atuned to the idea that the Dude is trying to keep his life together, the same way his beloved rug pulled together his apartment.  Even a misfire by the Coens is going to have some memorable moments and every film they make certainly has a chance to be on the level of \\"Raising Arizona\\" and \\"Fargo,\\" so even their second tier efforts are worth watching.the festivities.

B000002UA0|5.0|This is the hight of psychedelic genius and of course who could make such a masterpiece, why only the great Syd Barrett of course. If you havent heard this cd but you have listened to the rest of the Floyd catalouge and are looking for something new to chew into then expect to hear a completely different Floyd. This is Pink Floyd before Roger Waters ruled with an iron fist. This is the Syd Barrett Pink Floyd which, based upon your opinion, is for better or worse. This is the first Floyd album released in the summer of love year '67. This album alone is a testament to the genius Barrett posessed. Shorty after this album Syd suffered a mental breakdown(largely due to constant consumption of LSD)and left the group. Anyway if you like 60's psychedelic music and are looking for a new view of Pink Floyd then look no further because this is it!
B0000797IO|4.0|\\"Bruce Almighty\\" is obviously the movie in which Jennifer Aniston is the leading lady that has made the most money, but it is by no means a Jennifer Aniston film.  If she wants to point to something other than \\"Friends\\" to show what she can do as an actress then \\"The Good Girl\\" is probably going to be her first choice.  In this 2002 film from director Miguel Arteta she plays Justine, a 30-year-old clerk who is bored to tears by her job at Retail Rodeo where the only excitement is when Cheryl (Zooey Deschanel) makes one of her \\"Attention, Shoppers\\" announcements over the public address system and starts spewing insults and bizarre nonsense.  Cheryl is dispatched to doing makeovers for women customers (whatever is management thinking?), while Justine notices Holden (Jake Cyllenhaal), the new kid at the store who is reading \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" and who dispenses its wisdom to his new friend.  Holden's name is really Tom, which makes his ranks about hypocrisy rather ironic, but clearly he is the first breeze of any kind in Justine's life in a long, long time.  Whatever his name, a college dropout sure beats what is waiting for her at home.<br />Justine is married to Phil (John C. Reilly), who paints houses and always wishes it was raining so he can keep watching television.  Justine would like it if he bothered to fix the television set and to have himself tested to see if he is the reason they have not had a child.  Phil spends more time with his best buddy, Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson).  During the day they paint houses and during the night they smoke weed and watch the tube.  Bubba thinks of Justine as the ideal woman and having turned his back on ever having a relationship of his own with a woman vicariously enjoys the happy marriage of his best friend.  No wonder Justine falls pretty to Holden's advances and their first tryst at a fleabag motel turns into grabbing every possible opportunity to do it again.  Unfortunately, the amorous couple are seen and in an escalating series of events we wonder how high of a price Justine is going to have to pay.<br /><br />\\"The Good Girl\\" does not represent so much the dark side of Jennifer Aniston as it does the sad side.  You know that in every small town in America there is a girl with looks but without ambition who parlays her attractiveness into marrying a local stud who would never get out of that town alive.  Actually, none of this background is mentioned in the film, but it makes sense that Phil must have done something in the past to get a girl like Justine.  What is important in this film is that whatever he had and whatever he offered Justine it is long gone.  This is a marriage that has no reason to exist beyond the fact that it does, which helps explain the resolution of this film as much as anything.  The performance by the four principles are solid enough, and the supporting cast offers a variety of eccentrics that flesh out this particular seedy little town.  \\"The Good Girl\\" is as much a character study as anything else and whatever its limitations finds a large measure of redemption in the final scene between husband and wife.ating series of events we wonder how high of a price Justine is going to have to pay.  <BR> <BR>\\"The Good Girl\\" does not represent so much the dark side of Jennifer Aniston as it does the sad side.

B00000DATR|5.0|With this album Mike shown that he is still creative and can make something original and unexpected suddenly, when everyone were thinking he will make himself a vacation...<BR>&quot;Tubular bells III&quot; is a huge piece of music with influences of world music,electronic beats and a few suprises puted into it...<BR>But i would not call it a remake o &quot;tubular bells&quot; because it is so much diferent from that one...even much diffrent from &quot;tubular bells II&quot;!!! But still it's so inspiring and moving, that surely it is side by side with &quot;songs of hte distant earth&quot; on a throne for best nineties Oldfield album!!!<BR>In this music you can hear emotions and passion,in every note that mike plays on his guitar and in every synth sounds...<BR>&quot;source of secrets&quot;, &quot;Inner child&quot;, &quot;Serpent's dream&quot; and &quot;jewel in the crown&quot; are so melancholic and magic that you can even cry to it...beautifull music!<BR>Mike also had put some diffrent tracks, therefore it doesn't sound boring as whole - &quot;Outcast&quot; is a raging Hard-rock song with some brilliant guitar riffs, &quot;man in the rain&quot; is a variation of &quot;Moonlight shadow&quot; his biggest pop hit, and a finale of TBIII &quot;far above the clouds&quot; has a bass line from TBI and a drums from &quot;Ommadawn&quot; finale.<BR>Mike connected all the best what was in his early recordings (melancholy,brilliant guitars,mysterious atmosphere)on this album and mixed it with new music - and made a modern masterpiece of instrumental music!!!!<BR>If you like vangelis, Jean michel jarre, deep forest or any other new-instrumetal music performers you will surely love this Cd...Also if you are a Mike Oldfield fan you will not be dissapointed - this album just do not deserves for any dissapointment!!!!
B000069AUI|5.0|The second Coldplay album, &quot;A Rush of Blood To The Head,&quot; is a masterful effort that strikes a deep chord if you listen to it. With Chris Martin's fantastic voice and the memorable music, &quot;Rush&quot; is evidence enough that Coldplay's debut album was not a fluke.<br />The music ranges from haunting, such as the memorable &quot;Politik&quot; (&quot;Give me strength, reserve control/Give me heart and give me soul&quot;) to the poppier and simpler like &quot;In My Place.&quot; Following up are the pleadingly sweet &quot;Scientist,&quot; beautiful &quot;Clocks,&quot; the droning and somewhat less interesting &quot;Daylight,&quot; the wonderfully fatigued-and-lonely-sounding &quot;Warning Sign,&quot; the unassumingly disturbing title track, and the quiet, cold, stately &quot;Amsterdam.&quot;<br />Much of &quot;Rush&quot; stops just short of being melancholy, with its low-key guitarwork mingled with piano, drums and other instruments. The piano in particular gives what might have been ordinary music a very timeless, classical feel. The overall musical result is smooth and deceptively simple. The lyrics often evoke a sort of soft, optimistic sadness (&quot;God gave me style and gave me grace/ And put a smile upon my face&quot;), never smacking you in the face with any of the underlying sentiments (like politics) but just letting those beliefs seep into your mind. Martin's voice has a fragility and sweetness that few rock/pop singers have, and there seems to be genuine emotion behind his singing.<br />&quot;A Rush of Blood To The Head&quot; is a worthy follow-up to &quot;Parachutes,&quot; and a haunting musical presence. Definitely worth getting for those who like genuine song and music.
B00006IX0R|5.0|Well,i can not say nothing bad about it - a solid singles compilation from this magnificent irish band,Features their biggest hits like &quot;linger&quot;, &quot;salvation&quot; , &quot;zombie&quot; or &quot;Promises&quot;...it is not missing any of their hits.There is even &quot;daffodil lament&quot; - from the album &quot;No need to argue&quot; - it is a non-single track but propably one of the most beautifull in band's history, it's a great suprise that it came here!!!<BR>THe other thing that makes it interesting are the new songs -Charming &quot;stars&quot; and almost heavy-metal styled &quot;New new york&quot; (concentrating on 11.09.02 events)<BR>If you are a fan of Cranberries buy it for new brilliant tracks, if you just like good music or oyu want to discover this group, it is the best album to start with!

0425170349|3.0|This was one of Clancy's worst. John Clark and Ding Chavez assemble an anti-terror special forces unit comprised of men from several different countries, including Germany, UK, France, Israel. You've got to be kidding me!  What's the possibility of these countries working together on anything, let alone a special forces unit that uses their soldiers at the will of other nations?! Not only is this extreamly unrealistic, its just plain stupid. Another one Clancy shouldn't have bothered to write. The team foils some terrorist operations, but doesn't know that they're being financed by a group of tree-huggers who want to kill everyone in the world with some version of Ebola mixed with Cancer(impossible), because they don't want the environment hurt anymore. And then of course, there's the usual over - detailing of things, only this time its unbearable. If someone lies down on some grass, do we really need to know how its cut and what it smells like? Of course, in the end, the \\"Rainbow\\" team(the name itself had me laughing)saves the world by uncovering the environmentalist plot and stopping it before it can be executed. There's no need to read this book, because the activities that occur in it are never mentioned in \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\", so you won't be confused. And if your a Jack Ryan fan, you especially won't get anything out of ths book. His name is never once mentioned in the whole book!
B00004S6GL|5.0|Whilst this is different to other Elliot Smith recordings it still maintains the same level of quality as previous releases and even betters them in some ways with the inclusion of more instruments for a start. Son of sam is the first and best track of the album however the rest of the album is still nearly just as good. Another thing that you notice on this release aswell is that the music seems to compliment Elliots voice that little bit more it's a subtle change but one you still notice, so if you want a good new rock/folk/pop album then this is one of the better albums of the genre out there.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Truly an extraordinary out-of-the-blue album from an already decent band, Radiohead's OK Computer proved to be the one album that would best represent the close of the 20th century. That's really saying something folks.  It so mirrored *the world's* collective fears and anxieties over the coming millennium that it's not even worth comparing it with other albums and groups who may also have tried to plumb the same themes. And Radiohead emerged from the resulting (deserved) hype as if from a chrysalis, a band so awoken, so fresh with stinging consciousness that they're still reeling from their own impact today.
B00004YKY0|4.0|Mark Knopfler's solo releases are great and include some great guitar playing with folk tracks, jazz and some slight country influences and great lyrics this release is definatley worth picking up, whilst not been a major fan of the dire staits (although they where not too bad) i would have to say this is an improvment from then and is a very sophisticated release thats worth picking up, the record also runs through smoothly without a single bad track on it and there are no real let downs with this cd so it's worth picking up if you're a fan or if your new to Mark Knopfler.
0452282152|5.0|This book is a treasure.  When I came to the end, the story felt finished, but I was disappointed because I wished it could be longer--just to continue Chevalier's lovely language.  The quality of the writing and the great details parallel Vermeer's artwork, which makes subtle use of light and shadow to depict moments that seem ordinary on the surface, but, looking deeper, you realize they are extraordinary in their own way.<br />The heroine, Griet, eminently sympathetic and perceptive, tells the story not only of her complex relationships with the master and his family, but about life in Delft in the 1600s--a delicious slice of culture and history.  It's told so simply and beautifully that the very ordinariness of the story becomes what is extraordinary.<br />If you enjoy complex and unique relationships, historical novels, or even just a tale well told, this is a wonderful book, not to be missed.
B000002J2D|5.0|This album seems to get panned by many, receive a tepid yawn by some, or skipped altogether. But it has turned out to be one of my favorite Genesis CDs. Why? Probably because it IS a transitional album. Gone are the self-indulgent 10-minute sagas with incomprehensible lyrics. But the group still retains its progressive roots. It has not yet sold itself out to becoming a pop machine. The songs are all mini-masterpieces, full of robust musical complexities yet all very accessible. Phil Collins has not quite hit his stride as a vocalist or a songwriter yet, so his personality doesn't dominate the music like he does on later recordings. If you are a latter-day Genesis fan but are looking for some more meat, this album is definitely worth a listen.
0380002930|5.0|You don't have to like animal stories to like this book.  The good thing about it is that it can be enjoyed on multiple levels--as allegory, as adventure story, as fantasy, as cultural study--and usually, more than one at the same time.<br />Watership Down can't be said to be about any one thing--there is a journey, there is a breakout, there is a battle, there is a siege.  It makes the statement that to accomplish something, multiple talents are necessary--brains, brawn, and authority.  Without Hazel, the rabbits wouldn't have made it.  Without Bigwig or Blackberry, they probably wouldn't have made it.  Even the smallest, Pipkin, had his moment of importance.  It shows that to be a leader, you don't necessarily have to be the biggest or the strongest or the smartest.<br />The language is compulsively readable and the characterization is superb.  One can't decide exactly how to take the rabbits--they are so very human at times, yet at the same time completely wild.  They don't love as we know it, but they feel the need for survival and freedom.  Hazel isn't just The Leader.  He doubts himself, he's afraid, he's sometimes even annoyed with the others, but in the end he's prepared to sacrifice himself for them.  The novel is also very well-paced, especially for a 400-pager.  It certainly doesn't seem like a 400-pager.
6300216039|5.0|The classic Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet is the most accessible of Shakespeare's plays, also, perhaps, the most popular and well-known. Not surprisingly, then, it has been made into many films and has had many successful and not-so-successful spin-offs -- such as the better-left-unmentioned 1996 Leonardo Dicaprio/Claire Daines disaster. This film, however, is a great adaptation and a deserved classic. Director Franco Zeffirelli is legendary for making this transition from play to film so strikingly good, and the movie is a touchstone in the history of Shakesperian cinema, and rightfully so. This 1968 film was revolutionary in several ways. It breathed new life into this classic story, which had almost been done to death in poor and lifeless interpretations. One of the main reasons for this success was Zeffirelli's decision to use actual teenage actors to portray the two lovers (which seems like an obvious idea, but which had not really been done before, middle-aged actors being previous preferred:  Leonard Whiting as Romeo and Olivia Hussey as Juliet. Another stength the movie had was its painstakingly accurate representation of the Rennaisance. Other successful Shakesperian film adaptations have adapted the work of the bard into the modern world, putting the work in a modern setting with modern clothing, atmosphere, etc. This is all admirable, and well and good; however, this film goes for the opposite technique, portraying, as accurately as possible, the situations in the work as they would have been presented in Shakespeare's own time, and it does it very well. The Italian villa in which the film is set is quite striking; costumes and decorations are accurate down to the small details. One gets the feeling while watching this that it was, indeed, a long time ago -- which only serves to reinforce how timeless and perpetually applicable the story still is and always will be. The acting throughout the film is consistently well-done, not over-the-top and not listless.It contains just the right combination of atmosphere, drama, tragedy, and sexiness. An exemplary adaptation of Shakespeare and an acknowledged classic that is one of the true landmarks in the history of Shakesperian film.
B000083E79|5.0|Over the years I've kind of given up on Cher. While I enjoyed her voice and the hits &quot;If I Could Turn Back TIme&quot; I eventually got into other singers like Mariah and WHitney.  Thankfully, Cher released a greatest hits package just this year. I decided to purchase it and after listening and listening to it forgot how much I enjoyed her music.  Cher's voice is one of the rare alto's in the female vocal world (IE: Toni Braxton and newcomer Lisa Marie Presley) and it undoubtably has gotten much stronger then her debut.  Rather then putting the tracks in boring chronological order she decided to mix them up, but her earlier hits with the late Sonny Bono are included at the end.  Also included is a bonus remix of the club hit &quot;A Different Kind of Love Song.&quot;  Like Madonna, Cher has managed to re-invent herself many times.  But even what makes Madonna fans still in awe (like myself) is that she has managed to stay in the music business for over 50 years.  From her 60's work with Sonny to her Eastern European flavor and disco of the 70's to the pop-rock of the 80's and dance mixes of the 90's, &quot;The Very Best of Cher&quot; is TRULY the best of the best.  &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot; probably Cher's most best-well known hit (though even 'Believe' went to number one &quot;Turn Back Time&quot; is still probably a little more well known for its controversial video) is undoubtably one of Diane Warren's (read: &quot;Un-Break My Heart&quot; for Toni Braxton) best works.  Her voice is as poweful as ever.  Overall if you enjoyed any of Cher's stuff and havent purchased any of her albums or havent in a long time then get this great career-spanning album.  I also reccomend &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; by Madonna and &quot;To Whom It May Concern&quot; by the King of Rock 'n Roll's daughter Lisa Marie Presley.  If you like her work with songwriter Desmond Child (&quot;Just Like Jesse James&quot;) Then I reccomend LeAnn Rimes's newest album &quot;twisted Angel&quot; where a lot of the songs are written by Desmond Child.  Once again... thank you Cher!!
B000023VR6|4.0|Dr. Dre adapted well to the change of the times...however, not 100%. Some songs on this album are just not up to what Dre has in him. Some of the beats seemed rushed if though he says he still takes the time to perfect the beat...seems these days hes more worried about eminem's cds and 50 cents cd to make all of his songs as tight as theirs..either way its still a great cd. Snoop Dogg makes excellent appearances throughout and it's overall one of the better rap albums you can buy.
B00006M183|5.0|I thought this album was awesume.  I liked this even better than binural and I thought that album was pretty good.  I especially liked the tunes &quot;1/2 full&quot; and &quot;All or None&quot; both blues-like tunes that the band hasn't played before.<BR>Unlike the rap metal, radio is playing these days, it's ashame mainstream media and radio can not recognize or play good music such as a band named Pearl Jam.  A band destined for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.<BR>This band, (I should say this album) deserves radio play so listeners can hear this great music.
B000099T2L|1.0|Im really sorry to say this but the only song that stands out on this terrible album is 'crazy in love'. 'Baby boy' which is set to be her next single, is not bad. The rest all sound the same - slow, ballady & boring. She does not show her voice off on any track and does not show her true talent. Also, there are too many callaborations, she does not show she can hold her own. Here is my rating for each song:<br />Crazy in love feat. Jay Z - 10/10<BR>Naughty girl - 7/10<BR>Baby Boy feat. Sean Paul - 8/10<BR>(HERES WHERE IT GOES DOWN HILL!)<BR>Hip hop star feat. Big Boi & Sleepy Brown - 5/10<BR>Be with you - 4/10<BR>Me, myself & I - 5/10<BR>Yes - 6/10<BR>Signs feat. Missy Elliott - 0/10<BR>Speechless - 3/10<BR>That's how you like it feat. Jay Z - 4/10<BR>The Closer I get to you feat. Luther Vandross - 5/10<BR>Dangerously in love 2 - 7/10<BR>Beyonce Interlude - 0/10<BR>Gift from Virgo - 4/10<BR>Work it out - 6/10<BR>'03 Bonnie & Clyde feat. Jay Z - 8/10<BR>(Bonas Track) Daddy - 5/10<br />As you can see, every other song features another artist. I think for her first album she should have done it alone without so many callaborations. It is hard to distinguish one song from another as they all sound the same. She does not even sing in most of the songs it sounds like shes just talking! The worst song, in my opinion is 'Signs'. Terrible! Im sorry, but I think Beyonce could have done a lot better than this sorry excuse for an album! Save your money and buy Ashanti or Christina Aguilera instead!

B000002N2Z|5.0|this is without a doubt, the best deftones cd out there.  the vocals are heavy and brutal, the guitar and bass lines are original and catchy, and the drums are killer.  It's a terrible shame that chino is such a cockjockey.  The best songs on here are root, nosebleed, and engine no. 9.  this is what nu-metal needs to be like.  a must have cd.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This is without a doubt Smashing Pumpkins best album, I mean Meloncoly, Ador, Gish were all good but this blows them away. THis record is very Distorted, and very heavy Corgans Vocals, Lyrics, and Guitar playing make this band what was. Not a bad song, 'Geek U.S.A.' contains one of the best guitar solos of all time. 'Today' is the best song if their is a best song on the record, I mean all the songs are insanly good. The band is at the top of their game, though Corgans lyrics are not as good as on Meloncolly, this is the better album. This is really one of the top 10 albums of the 90s and top  100 of all time, if you like rock music you will like this so please pick it up
B00000JCB2|2.0|this cd is such unoriginal excrement that i want to gag myself for wasting my money on it.  This cd gets 2 stars for 2 songs: break stuff and 9 teen 90 nine.  that's it. those are the only things standing between this review and one with 0 stars.  Fred durst is and egotistical ballbiter and the rest of the bands are just unoriginal lackeys. don't even consider it.
B000002IZ4|4.0|Purple, is a great album from start to finish. In my opinion this is STP's best album. 'Interstate Love Song' is the best song on Purple, its a great ballad with great lyrics and the acoustic guitar flows nicely. This is classic STP with songs like 'Meatplow' 'Vasoline' 'Lounge Fly' Pretty Penny' 'Big Empty' and 'Unglued' all becoming radio favorites. You can hear all the songs I just listed on the radio and for good reason they rock! STP to me are really a grunge band, but better, cause Scott Weiland is one of the best front men of all time if you get passed the drugs and all. So you see this album is even more esseintal then CORE. But even thee deep cuts on the album like 'Still Remains' 'Silvergun Superman' 'Army Ants' and 'Kitchenware' are awesome songs. STP is with out a doubt one of the best rock bands of the 90's along with Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, Radiohead, and yes the great Nirvana, oh and Tool. You see you are really missing out if you dont own this album.
B000002HRE|3.0|we were all afraid metallica lost it with this album.  It doesn't have the bite that any of their previous releases had (although it does have one of my favorite songs ever: the unforgiven II).  while some of the laid back style is very good (such as in unforgiven II) others just leave you feeling cheated (such as low man's lyric).  This does have some other good songs, though, like fuel, memory remains, and fixxxer.  not that impressive, but not necessarily bad.

B000002H6C|4.0|This is one of metallica's finer releases, of about the same quality as ride the lightning and just a step below master of puppets.  This has one of the best metallica guitar solos (aside from the one in master of puppets)  ever. i am referring of course to the solo in &quot;one&quot; (arguably the best song on this album) if you're like me and you just recently got into metallica, make sure you get this cd. if not, well, i hope you enjoyed the review and share my opinion for the most part.  some excellent stuff.
0385504209|3.0|Mix in a little Templar Knights, a little Catholic conspiracy theory, an albino monk, a religious symbologist, and a French cryptographer, and then write a plot that reveals the mystery of the Grail and the feminine goddess in a few circuits of the hour-hand on your watch.<br />  The premise &amp; topic of this book is one I can find very fascinating, and that's what kept me interested in the book. But just as throwing a bunch of ingredients &amp; spices into a recipe doesn't assure a tasty meal, I came away from this book somewhat disappointed that the end result wasn't more satisfying. Plot twists and developments seem so conveniently contrived, and there's an odd mixture of solving things too easily and of being blind to the obvious. To me, one sign of a poorly written book is when the author has to go back near the end of the story and give explanation and foundation. I had suspected the character who turned out to be the &quot;villain&quot;, but mostly dismissed that character on the basis of all the improbable storyline twists that would be required.  Then, lo and behold, the author provides just the plot twists and background so this person can be viable as the villain, while also explaining why &amp; how all the apparent coincidences weren't necessarily coincidence.  There were still enough good plot twists to keep you wondering and interested.  There's not a lot of character development, however, as most of the characters simply seem to serve the role of moving the plot along.  Also, the compressed time span of the main story was something requiring suspension of reason.<br />  All in all, this book offers up a lot of interesting facts and plotting, but ends up being something less than a reader expects.
B000005JAK|5.0|Husker Du was one of the best bands of the eightys.  This here is the major label debut, it's kind of evident because it seems less &quot;punk&quot; compared to everything else they've done.  Don't worry the slower songs will grow on to you.  Bob Mould's slower songs &quot;too far down&quot; and &quot;hardly getting over it&quot; are awesome. I didn't really like them at first, but now they're my favorites.  Grant Hart doesn't fail to deliver awesome songs like Mould. Hart's &quot;sorry somehow&quot; and &quot;don't want to know if you're lonely&quot; are his best cuts.  The opening song is awesome too.  If you don't own &quot;flip your wig&quot; or &quot;new day rising&quot; buy those first.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|By the time this film appeared (1992), Eastwood had already established himself as one of the most gifted directors. His talents behind the camera were first evident, and impressive, in Play Misty for Me (1971). Unforgiven received an Academy Award for best film, as did Eastwood for directing it. So many memorable characters which include Bill Munny (Eastwood), Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), Sheriff \\"Little Bill\\" Daggett (Gene Hackman), and English Bob (Richard Harris). What I find most interesting is Eastwood's willingness and ability to portray an old widow, far past his prime, who reluctantly agrees to accept an assignment to earn some much-needed money for himself and his family. Munny (obviously, no pun intended)  enlists the aid of his friend Logan. They are joined by the self-described \\"Schofield Kid\\" (Jaimz Woolvett) and proceed to a town under the absolute control of Daggett who, unlike Brian Dennehy's character Cobb in Silverado, can be personally quite appealing but is nonetheless every bit as formidable. (I shall never forget Daggett's dying words, \\"But I'm building a house!\\") In my opinion, the plot really is not especially important. The film's greatest strengths are found within the meticulous development of various characters, a process under Eastwood's sure direction which is gradual and both subtle and substantial. Perhaps the character of journalist W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) is necessary to expedite the exposition but he seems to add little else. However, all others among the supporting cast are essential.<br />Unforgiven can be categorized as a \\"western\\" but, in my opinion, it transcends that genre as it examines how the reality of an old man's vengeance is far more significant than the myth associated with his earlier adventures. Near the end of the film, \\"Little Bill\\" must deal with a Munny who is, not with someone who once was. The fact that Munny prevails reveals much about him...and perhaps about Eastwood and others who in later life, like Tennyson's Ulysses, \\"strive to seek, to find...and not to yield.\\"Tennyson's Ulysses, \\"strive to seek, to find...and not to yield.\\"
B00005V0X5|4.0|This cd is amazing. Everything from the remastered songs to the demos in the end. The only thing I disliked are the bleep sounds in \\"These boots\\". Those wouldn't have been there if Hazelwood had let Dave use his lyrics on it. But besides that, it's a very cool debut album
B00004TDTO|5.0|For several summers, my family and I vacationed on Martha's Vineyard where much of this film was shot (renamed Amity Island). You can imagine how eager we were to see the film when it was first released. So many locations were familiar. We also spotted several friends who appear briefly as extras. However, we were certainly not prepared to be as frightened we were by several scenes. (Those who have already seen this film know which ones.) If  I recall correctly, this was the first film which Steven Spielberg (then 27) directed and clearly established him as a master storyteller. Several of his crew received an Academy Award (for editing, sound, and musical score); both Spielberg and the film were also nominated.<br />As does John Mulligan with the character Salvaje in The Stalking Moon, Spielberg brilliantly conceals or only partially reveals the great white shark, thereby requiring us to use or imagination. This strategy increases our anticipation as well as the emotional impact of each encounter with what shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) calls \\"the perfect eating machine.\\" When recently seeing this film again, I was again jolted by moments which I had first seen 28 years ago. This time around, I paid more attention to the basic conflict between the importance of public safety advocated by police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) and the importance of economic development (i.e. tourism) to Amity Island advocated by mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton). I still do not recognize the dialect used by Quint (Robert Shaw) but was again entertained by his interactions with Brody and Hooper, especially one night aboard Quint's boat Orca as they exchange \\"sea stories\\" and compare scars.<br />This is an especially entertaining \\"horror movie,\\" possessed of crisp and sure direction, solid acting, and an effective integration of cinematography, musical score, and special effects. Having seen it so many times, I now prefer to see only certain scenes while watching it again. I am curious to know how members of a focus group would respond to it if (a) they knew nothing about it, (b) were placed in a private screening room, provided with refreshments of choice, and (c) asked to see it for the first time.  My guess, obviously only a guess, is that their reactions and comments would be essentially the same as my own were in 1975.again.

B00007ELEL|5.0|Why do so few films develop a cult following which increases in number and intensity each year? For example, The Big Lebowski. Can you think of another film which has an annual festival in its sole honor? (It was held this year in Louisville.) I was mulling about this as I recently saw it again. Much funnier this time. For me, the same is true of Young Frankenstein. Films never change but we do. So how have I changed? If The Big Lebowski is even funnier the next time, what does that reveal about me? More mulling awaits me.<br />Meanwhile, given the variety of screenplays they have co-authored, produced, directed thus far, Joel and Ethan Coen cannot be accused of predictability. Who else has created a body of work as varied as theirs? Blood Simple (1985), Raising Arizona (1987), Miller's Crossing (1990), Barton Fink (1991), The Hudsucker Proxy (1994), Fargo (1996) The Big Lebowski (1998), O, Brother, Where Art Thou? ((2000), and The Man Who Wasn't There (2001). Each has its own loyal and substantial following. Fargo remains my personal favorite but, over time, as I keep changing, perhaps The Big Lebowski will replace it.<br />Few people know that, in fact, the Coens collaborated on its screenplay with members of the Monty Python Flying Circus, Hunter Thompson, Ken Kesey, Salvador Dali, and William M. Gaines. How else to explain the absence of a coherent plot? Fortunately, we have an especially interesting cast of characters in addition to the two Jeffrey Lebowskis (Lebowskes?): \\"The Big's\\" wife Bunny (Tara Reid) who creates serious problems for \\"Dude\\" because she owes money to Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara) and is kidnapped, with a ransom of $1-million demanded; \\"The Big's\\" daughter Maude (Julianne Moore) who really should join a flying circus; Jesus (John Turturro), a champion bowler who prefers blue language and purple clothing; Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), probably \\"Dude's\\" best friend; and Donny (Steve Buscemi), another of \\"Dude's\\" close friends. Much time is spent on consuming White Russians as well as on bowling, kidnapping, cursing, extortion, sex, and...<br />For many of us, this film is an acquired taste. I enjoy it more each time I see it; others, I realize, will not see it through to completion. For them, it makes no sense. In this context, I am reminded of Henry Ford's observation that whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.pent on consuming White Russians as well as on bowling, kidnapping, cursing, extortion, sex, and...<br />For many of us, this film is an acquired taste.

B000059H99|5.0|In 1976, this film was selected to receive an Academy Award for best picture. (The other nominees were All the President's Men, Bound for Glory, Network, and Taxi Driver.) Then and now, I think that at least two and perhaps three of the other nominees were more deserving. In any event, as we all know, there has since been a series of regressively ineffective sequels to the original. As we await Rocky XX, we can at least appreciate the first. Directed by John Avildsen and starring Sylvester Stallone, it adds to a rather long list of \\"Underdog Films,\\" a list which now includes Seabiscuit. My rating reflects an opinion of the film as entertainment. It is important to keep in mind that 27 years have passed since its initial release. How difficult it is (at least for me) to judge it on its own terms rather than consider all of the dreadful films (including several Rocky sequels) in which Stallone has since appeared; also to contrast Rocky's non-title fight with those portrayed in Raging Bull.<br />After almost 30 years, I still enjoy seeing Rocky but for different reasons than I once did. One is the use of humor. The first time around, I missed so many comic moments. Another is Rocky's relationship with Mickey (Burgess Meredith). The bond they eventually forge is credible, indeed poignant. And still another is Talia Shire's performance as Adrian. Only an actress of her talent could invest that role with the texture and nuances she does. (I think her talents were essentially wasted in the three Godfather films, especially in Godfather III.) The exteriors in Philadelphia are still effective as is the build-up to the fight during which Rocky and Mickey have  few resources to work with except their imagination and determination. This may not be a great film but it was certainly great fun in 1976 and it still is. Yo!
B00007L4OM|3.0|Wasabi is a high-spirited French action comedy with a Japanese name.  This Luc Besson production stars Jean Reno in a wonderful performance as a tough-guy French cop who is as quick to use his tongue as his overeager fists.  One day, out of the blue, Detective Fiorentino discovers that he has a 19 year-old daughter by a Japanese woman who left him almost 20 years ago, breaking his heart in the process.  The girl, Yumi, turns out to be an orange-haired free spirit who hates cops and has been led to believe that her father raped her mother.  Much of the film is spent with Hubert and Yumi getting to know one another, as they uncover secrets about her mothers past that seem to have made the young woman the target of some rather unsavory characters.<br />The plot is the least of the matter in this film.  As directed by Gerard Krawczyk, Wasabi is really all about style.  Bessons screenplay is fitfully amusing, doling out cleverness and cutesyness in roughly equal measure.  Cinematographer Gerard Sterin brings out the colorful richness of the urban Japanese landscape and editor Yanne Herve doesnt linger longer on the jokes and sight gags than is absolutely necessary.  These elements help to compensate for the somewhat desperate air that afflicts the screenplay from time to time.<br />The prime asset of Wasabi is Jean Renos performance.  Reno perfectly mines the comic potential inherent in the material through the tone of weary cynicism and superiority to all around him that he conveys throughout.  As an actor who has played this type of rogue-cop character many times in his career, Reno obviously relishes this opportunity for a little good-natured self-ribbing.  And he does a splendid job.<br />Wasabi is little more than a piffle when all is said and done, but Reno makes it worth seeing.
B00006DEFA|5.0|For those about to see this film for the first time, they can expect a feast for their senses...at least in terms of sight and sound. Both the production values and the music are magnificent. In 1984, it received Academy Awards for best director (Milos Forman) and leading actor (F. Murray Abraham) as well as for adapted screenplay, art direction, costume design, makeup, and sound. It was also nominated for cinematography and deserved that award also, losing out to The Killing Fields. Although Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) is the subject, the film's focus is really on Antonio Salieri (Abraham) who is offended by young Mozart's vulgarity and resentful of the fact that such an immature boor should be entrusted by God with such exceptional talent. He considers himself the victim of a cruel practical joke, although he appreciates Mozart's \\"divine\\" talent which only serves to exacerbate his resentment. Unlike other films such as The Red Shoes which also offers so much that is pleasing to the eye and ear, Amadeus has a complicated plot which involves equally complicated human relationships, notably Mozart's with Salieri and with his father Leopold Mozart (Roy Doltrice). The supporting cast is first-rate. As the film progresses, we realize that young Mozart is literally working himself to death as he struggles to complete a commission to compose \\"Requiem,\\" not realizing that Salieri is his \\"benefactor.\\" There is so much to enjoy in this film even as Mozart's health deteriorates. What to make of Salieri? His jealousy is certainly understandable, if reprehensible. As the film draws to its sad conclusion, and as his own health deteriorates, Salieri's attitude toward Mozart seems to me ambivalent. Yes, the disapproval and resentment remain but I also sense a certain pride in his association with the young genius. The tone is bittersweet, in fact poignant as the old man realizes that Mozart's art -- not his -- will be remembered and cherished.<br />This DVD version also provides several supplementary items which include commentaries by Milos Forman and writer Peter Shaffer as well as a behind-the-scenes 37-minute documentary, \\"The Making of Amadeus.\\"ovides several supplementary items which include commentaries by Milos Forman and writer Peter Shaffer as well as a behind-the-scenes 37-minute documentary, \\"The Making of Amadeus.\\"
B000053GTK|5.0|The version of this I have is a re-issue of a re-issue - the original album (1973), GLORIOUSLY remixed, packaged in a miniature reproduction of the original lp sleeve, with two bonus live tracks from 1974 &amp; 1976.  The second of the live tracks, `In a glass house', is a pretty muddy, echo-y recording - but why quibble?  This album is one of the best of the era from a prog band.<br />Gentle Giant were a band of extremely creative, talented multi-instrumentalists - no one played only one instrument, and seeing them juggle parts in concert was a real treat.  Critics have accused them over the years of being `cold' and `emotionless' - nothing could be further from the truth.  It's easy to hear how much fun they're having with this complex music - and if you ever had the opportunity to see them perform live, it was easy to see as well.  None of the musically ambidextrous goings-on were performed just for the sake of showing off - their music is well thought-out, played with abandon and perfection at the same time, accompanied by intelligent and thoughtful lyrics.  Every single member of the band has a huge part to contribute - nothing is left to chance, and it's as fun for the listener to hear it all come together as it must have been for the band to perform it.<br />I've played versions of this album for people over the years who have never heard of the band - they've never failed to come away from the experience being impressed - it's jaw-droppingly good. This is a classic of the genre - and a must-have for any true collector.
B000002J1U|3.0|After the mighty Led Zeppelin I and II albums which had nary a weak song in the bunch, Led Zeppelin III began a long string of albums which had a pattern of half-good-to-great songs and half-mediocre-to-excruciatingly-lousy garbage. In my opinion the brutally inconsistent, overrated Led Zeppelin rode the fame and fortune of their first two great albums to an undeserved place as one of the best bands in rock history. Lots of groups made one or two great albums but didn't get half the recognition that Led Zeppelin got. But back to Led Zeppelin III...like I said its half good and half forgettable. 'Tangerine' and \\"That's the Way' are two of the best and most underrated songs in the Led Zeppelin catalogue. Indeed, they are two of my all-time favorite Led Zeppelin songs; I would describe them as \\"psychedelic-folk\\" as they draw you in to some sort of drug-hazed-Lucy-In-The-Sky-With-Diamonds-fantasy world. 'Immigrant Song', 'Gallow's Pole' and 'Since I've Been Loving You' are also very good; in fact, 'Since I've Been Loving You' contains some of Jimmy Page's best and most feeling guitar playing on record. But as for the the rest of the album, well, here we go again. 'Hats off to Roy Harper' is not only the worst Led Zeppelin song of all time (even worse than the disco stuff on 'Houses of the Holy'), it has to be one of the worst songs in rock history. Do Led Zeppelin think they can defecate on a piece of vinyl and try to pass it off as music? 'Hats Off' sounds like my brother when he was 12 years old jamming with his friends in the attic; no, I take that back; my brother sounded BETTER than this. I can't even describe it: a bunch of amateurish screaming in a telephone-megaphone voice with some really lame, hokey, childish lyrics and some sloppy two-note slide guitar playing with no melody. The remaining four songs are mediocre with a capital M. These nondescript mid-tempo plodders will have you confused as to which song title goes with which song; that's how forgettable they are.

006109594X|5.0|This was my first Robinson book.  I heard the unabridged tape version.  The narrator was very good.  <br />The plot for this book was very original.  The character development was at times difficult to follow.  I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in political and military affairs.
B0000A2ZO1|5.0|For physical reasons I was unable to see this movie at the theater.  However, the long wait for the video was well worth it.  Paramount went out and hired one of the best action directors in the person of Stephen Baird.  The escape scenes involving Picard and other crew members are scintillating and inventive.  The final encounter between the Enterprise and the Scimitar is even more thrilling than the crashlanding of the Enterprise-D in GENERATIONS.<br />Also brought in for this movie was the gifted screenwriter John Logan.  Through the dialogue between Picard and Shinzon he ratchets up the tension as the story progresses.  This effectively sets the stage for the action sequences that Baird has skillfully devised.  Logan fit in perfectly with Star Trek's philosophy that the characters should be the driving force in the movie and not just pawns in the hands of the director.<br />Many critics complained that the film was difficult to follow because of sloppy editing.  For what it's worth, I watched this movie with a friend and we never spoke until it ended.  We were so riveted by NEMESIS that we allowed nothing to distract us.  If there was an edting problem, I would think that my mind would have wondered at various points of the movie.  That never happened!  Recent movies like BLACKHAWK DOWN and LORD OF THE RINGS were so dominated by action and gruesome images that they grew tiresome.  <br />When I realized that NEMESIS was going to be a disappointment at the Box Office, I initially felt sorry for the hundreds of people at Paramount who created this marvelous adventure.  However, I changed my feelings and want to salute everyone involved for giving us an excellent film to mark the end of the Star Trek movies (maybe!).
B000089RVX|5.0|I would type in just one word to describe Evanescence's first, and not last (thank God), album as WOW!  But I can't do that because there is reviewing to be done.<br />1. Going Under (5/5) - This song hooks you from the beginning to the end.  It's the band's second single.<br />2. Bring Me To Life (4/5) - Though this is what got most people hooked on Evanescence, it's not what did it for me.  Great vocals, but not quite deserving of a 5.<br />3. Everybody's Fool (3/5) - I get sick of this song fast because it's not what I came to expect after Going Under and Bring Me To Life.<br />4. My Immortal (1/5) - I do not like this ballad at all!  But that's just my opinion since everyone else seems to enjoy it.<br />5. Haunted (5/5) - This song is what got me addicted to Evanescence.  Haunting vocals, not the best song on the CD but still pretty awesome!<br />6. Tourniquet (4.5/5) - I really like this song, but since it's so depressing, I had to mark it down a little.<br />7. Imaginary (5/5) - I love this song (though it's not my favorite)!  This is, lyrically, the best song on the CD.<br />8. Taking Over Me (5/5) - This is my favorite song on this CD!  It's about obsession and you can picture Amy Lee stalking someone as you listen to it.  This should be the third single!<br />9. Hello (5/5) - I know this is a ballad, but it lives up to the disturbing nature of the band's reputation....  Plus, it's a really good song.<br />10. My Last Breath (5/5) - Many people don't understand that this is a song about devotion in a relationship.  Amy talks about holding her last breath before she dies so she doesn't have to leave her boyfriend.  Great song, kind of creepy too!<br />11. Whisper (5/5) - This song is rather disturbing, I know, but it's still awesome!  It's about the pondering of death and it scares the [pooh] out of me if I listen to it alone.<br />Evanescence is my favorite band of all time.  If you want to hear Amy's best work, download the song \\"Missing.\\"  If you buy this CD don't just skip to Bring Me To Life and put it down once it's done.  Listen to every song and I guarantee you'll become addicted.o Bring Me To Life and put it down once it's done.  Listen to every song and I guarantee you'll become addicted.
B00004X0Q0|4.0|It's easy to be put off by At the Drive-In. Their song structures are often difficult to grasp without repeated listenings, their lyrics pretentious and garbled, and their sound quite abrasive. But with repeated listenings, it's found that Relationship of Command, like most ATDI, is a hell of a rock record. <BR>I've actually always regarded 'One Armed Scissor' as being one of the weakest tracks here, if not the weakest- and it's still a great song. The album's true high points are awe-inspiring. 'Sleepwalk Capsules' is furious and moves at an uneven (but breakneck) tempo, before launching into a soaring chorus that'll lodge itself in your gray matter for days. 'Invalid Litter Dept.' is indeed fairly creepy, and this is due largely to the fact that the fractured, cryptic lyrics are matched perfectly by the haunting instrumentation. The end of the song is a textbook example of how to incorporate screaming into a song; many bands, such as Thursday, scream all throughout their songs, and thus it loses its power. But by the time Cedric Bixler unleashes the caustic howl at the end of 'Invalid', it's the natural pinnacle of the song- the guitar begins chopping away and it takes all the restraint you possess not to scream along. This is especially true should you be listening to this record in public. In my opinion, however, the single most powerful song on 'Relationship..' is 'Cosmonaut'. This song is the musical equivalent of an air raid. The opening blast, a torrent of guitar punctuated by staccato space-rock blips, is furious and unrelenting. You don't know whether you want to dance or attack the person nearest you. What makes this song uniquely ATDI is the verses- you've got the standard barked lyrics and chugging guitar, but also a spiraling, eerie backing guitar that sounds like the vocalizing of some angry phantom. The entire track is a masterpiece and withstands multiple repeated listenings. <BR>At The Drive-In's consistent output of emotional and driving rock songs continues all throughout 'Relationship of Command'. They're not immediately accessible to all listeners- none of their music is- but with any appreciation of rock music it's impossible not to like this record.
B000001FTQ|4.0|Nobody remembers this now but the sparkling live version of &quot;Bad&quot; on this EP is the song that transformed U2 from MTV alterna-rock heroes to superstars in America.<br />Seriously, I was in college at the time and this was an era where Journey and Def Leppard were hugely popular. REM, Talking Heads and U2 were plenty popular and sold records but were still pretty much dismissed by the great unwashed masses. In the weeks after this EP came out, you suddenly started hearing this live version of &quot;Bad&quot; blasting out of frat houses which would have been unthinkable previously.<br />&quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, which preceded this EP, was a great album and sold well but &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, which was their next studio release after this EP, was a great album that sold in massive numbers. It was this live version of &quot;Bad&quot; that set the stage for U2 to take over the world.
B00004Z459|5.0|ok...even though meteora is out now, I still listen to this one a lot.  Meteora is a great album, but this one beats it just by a little.  Memorable songs like &quot;Crawling&quot; and legendary songs like &quot;One Step Closer&quot; and &quot;In The End&quot; make this CD the best.  All the songs rock and Linkin Park's style is so full of talent and exraordinary rythym.  This album is dark and I like that about it.  I got tired of that happy, teeny-bopper, preppy sh*t that the pop scene has come out with.  I didn't even start liking rock music until this CD came out.  All the other bands just weren't good enough.  This CD will be one of the ultimate albums that will stand the test of time and never get tiring to listen to.
0316776963|5.0|I had heard Sedaris on public radio &amp; seeing this in a bookstore in Napa, I bought it. I read it on public transortation &amp; that was a mistake. I laughted out loud and I missed &amp; nearly missed several stops. It's a very engaging book of autobiographical stories. Sedaris lived for a while in France and the title story is a self-deprecating look at his efforts to learn French. I highly recommend this. It's delightful.
0694003611|4.0|I hadn't read this book since I was a very little girl, but remembered a warm, fuzzy feeling about it.  After ordering the book, I wondered why.  It's poorly written, and the colors are wierd.  But as I read it to my 8 1/2 month old son, both of us are soothed by the rhythm of the words, and he is fascinated by the illustrations, which seem to have just enough detail to be interesting but not so much as to be overwhelming.  Works for us.
B00007E8O5|5.0|What can I say.....the man drops another killer release!!<BR>In my opinion all 25 tracks are the Sh*t, I listen to it at work almost everyday.<BR>Still waiting for a new one..c'mon Mr. Cantrell, your fans are waiting :-)
B000089RVX|5.0|This artist has a very intersting way of expressing feelings and emotions.  It is accompanied by and excellent choice in music, beautiful singing and a great design.  A CD I promise you will love.
B00006RU5B|4.0|In my opinion Chris Cornell is better off without Soundgarten, and the guys from Rage always make for a good CD. Put the 2 together and ya got a fine mix of tunes. <BR>Only problem is i think I blew a speaker with &quot;Show Me How to Live&quot; it's got a nice bass kick, and if ya got some fat sub's, they'll hear ya coming for a block or 2
B00009ATIX|5.0|What I gather from reading other reviews here and on IMDB is that most people don't like to have to think about movies at all.  If that's the case, then this movie certainly isn't for you.  It's very cerebral and very emotional.  It raises difficult questions about life, death, and reality, without giving any trite and easy answers.  Apparently this upsets some people.  It's a shame that such a great movie keeps getting slammed by people who apparently would prefer the same predigested pablum that Hollywood normally turns out.  <br />This is one of the best sci fi movies I've ever seen.  Period.

6304578482|4.0|A dumb film with a genial intelligence that'll register once you're willing to forget what you should be liking - and just get on with watching the thing. Not flawless by any stretch , but it contains some very sharp , exquisitely executed gags. You wont sit there feeling short changed trying desperately hard to find it funny - like watching a disappointing episode of your favourite sitcom. The performances from ALL (not just the feted Janeane Garofalo) are excellent.
B0000028RR|5.0|RATM is awesome. The great political lyrics, Tom Morellos AMAZING guitar riffs and scracthing (on the guitar strings) is reason enough to buy this album. Also you should check out Audioslave I saw them live and they are completely under rated and another one of my favorites. My favorite track on the CD is Know Your Enemy probabely because Maynard James Keenan from my favorite band Tool is a guest Vocalist.
0786869143|5.0|Great, empowering, made me think a lot. Andrea's long review beneath is saying that he should have written another book (about blind chance, I think, although it is hard to tell) whereas I loved this book for what it is. One I am recommendign to all my homies. Gave me a lot of hope.
B00005B36H|5.0|Buy this CD its pure gold the best CD i own (other than Tool Aenima)
B0000028RR|5.0|Rage is awesome, what else can you say. Just Like Metallica their music is out to kick your azz. I dont really pay attention to the meaning of the lyrics which is funny because thats what people think their claim to fame is but, in my opinoin and I bet to the opinion of others, their musical talent is what draws their appeal. This includes  Zach's lyrical talents (or rap if you want to call it) and Tom's killer  guitar riffs.  Zach and Tom make a perfect duo in getting a rythmic and powerfull tone through out all their songs. Zach's lyrical Style express power and agression which produces a very empowering feeling to the listener. I wont say that This album is  my favorite  of theirs because I like all their albums almost equally. Hopefully Zach's new band will continue Rages legacy Since Tom failed in that attempt.
1577311523|5.0|Tolle presents what has been presented by many others from a challenging and new point of view. I especially liked the question-answer format. It cuts right to the point and has no fluff. His style is straight forward, no mush. The book is basically in three parts: how he got here, his philosophy, how to apply his ideas.<br />Some people want to cut right to part three, but I think the whole is better than the parts when you are first being introduced to his philosophy. I would urge people to read this book first and then go to the next &quot;Practicing&quot; later for something to carry around for easy referral.<br />Like others have said, his work has changed my life - especially how I handle my relationships, letting go of things and living in forgiveness NOW.<br />Overall, very powerful, but his words will only work for you if you are ready to hear them.
B00008VGK0|1.0|Pointless, waste of money, Why? She can't really think that <BR> mix with Missy Elliot is good.  Just one more way to get us to buy her CD's.  I bought and its a waste of time and money.  Everyone else, take my word for it.  SAVE YOUR $$$
0066214122|3.0|I have always liked Crichton and his work, but I was disappointed in Prey. He is either churing out the books too fast just for the money, or he thinks his readers are stupid. Most people familiar with Crichton are intelligent enough to understand - in a layman's way - the science behind his work. Otherwise we wouldn't pick up his books. But in Prey he spends too much time explaining the science and technology, which isn't that new. Scientists and other writers have been talking about and writing about nanotechnology for a long time. Even old Star Trek fans will recognize the plot idea of nanos-gone-wild.<br />I had this book figured out from about chapter two, but pushed through it to see if I were wrong - but I wasn't - very boring.<br />However, if you have a teenager in the house who likes science fiction, then he/she should like this. I used a basic formula and found the reading level to be about grade 11-12, so a wide and novice-science audience would like this book.<br />I hope that Mr. Crichton gets back to some serious writing in the near future and actually produces something that challenges us.
B0000640SA|5.0|This movie is brilliant and you don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand.  Please don't watch this movie if you prefer big Hollywood, big budget movies.  If you prefer to see mindless movies with no plots, no character devlopments, and all explosions by all means go knock yourself out.  It's pretty sad that their are so many idiots out their that don't appreciate movies such as this one.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Contrary to one other review of Chicago, I absolutely LOVED it... and I prefer it over Moulin Rouge, which I thought was boring and slow except for the tango scene and maybe the ending... Catherine Zeta-Jones is fantastic in this film... her abilites to sing and dance will never leave you in doubt that she is one great, beautiful and talented actress... This is by far her best role yet... Being a fan of Renee Zellweger's after Bridget Jones' Diary (another great film btw), I thought her role in Chicago didn't do much for her because it seemed to me that she played more of the supporting role instead of the lead role (seriously, Zeta-Jones brilliantly stole the movie)... nevertheless, Zellweger's \\"innocence\\" adds a nice contrast to Zeta-Jones' all-out vamp-like dancer character... the music and dancing is great!  And Richard Gere will knock your socks off!
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is amazing....one of the best ones in my collection....my favorite thing about it is how they redid some of the songs from Origin and put them on there like Imaginary, My Immortal and Whisper....and they came out awesome......i LOVE what they did with them....this is an awesome CD by an awesome band with a very promising future
B00009ATIX|2.0|This new Hollywood remake of the classic Russian sci-fi film from 1972 is not nearly as intelligent, nor will it be as lasting. Indeed, this modern &quot;remake&quot; will likely be forgotten in a few years, whereas the legendary original will still be respected.<br />The Clooney remake lacks the philosophical depth of it's predecessor and cheapens it into a sappy love story with New Age trappings and the typical plot-twist at the end. It's formulized whereas the original truly was an original in more ways than one.<br />It's fun comparing these two films side-by-side. It clearly shows the money-driven ambition of Hollywood today and the dumbing-down of modern cinema. But if you haven't, you MUST see the original Solaris by Tarkovsky! The main difference between these two films is that the original Tarkovsky film is a masterpiece, whereas the Soderberg remake is something to do for two hours.
B00000055E|4.0|First off, I want to know why ...so many rap fans hated this album. I've had this CD for ages and I enjoy it heaps (but it did take me a long time!)<br />To be honest, I haven't been a 2pac fan since his younger days but I quickly grew into his music when 'Me Against the World' was released. Many people are familiar with 2pac when he was with Deathrow but this is some old stuff created back even before '2pacalypse Now' was released.<br />Both CDs are generally good, though I like CD2 a bit better. Some great songs on this CD are: Nothing to Lose, I Wonder If Heaven Got a Ghetto, R U Still Down, Hellrazor, Lie to Kick It, When I Get Free, Hold On Be Strong, ..., Do for Love, Nothin But Love, When I Get Free II and Only Fear of Death.<br />2pac released 2 songs from this CD (I think), I Wonder If Heaven Got a Ghetto and Do for Love. Great tracks to listen to but could have been worked on some more. Some tracks I reckon he should have released are Only Fear of Death and Nothing to Lose. <br />You won't find 2pac's thug style on here but you will find some pretty heavy, old stuff on here. Generally, I would recommend this CD to true 2pac fans. It's a great album but would take a long time to like.

0783233477|1.0|MJB is so inferior even to the re-made-for-TV version of &quot;Death Takes a Holiday&quot;, starring Monte Markham, that I can't pan it enough. The Markham vehicle had some wonderful moments when Death's imminent victim starts to realize the consequences of Death being &quot;on vacation&quot; - terminal cancer victims, torn by agony-  unable to die.... the best MJB could do was to show &quot;Joe Black's&quot; fascination with human sensory input - the peanut butter joke becomes excruciating. I'm delighted to hear the movie died at the box office.
B000003TAW|5.0|I don't know why people keep bashing Weezer because these guys are so talented and their music is awesome! They may be a geek rock band but they always keep on rocking!

B00002E224|4.0|This was a beautiful movie, a wonderfully understated story of an extended date between 2 strangers: an awkward and goateed American slacker (Ethan Hawke) and a stunning and sunny French woman (Julie Delpy). Jesse (he), is on the rebound - having followed his girlfriend to Europe, only to find that she's dumped him.  On a train to Vienna, he meets Celine (she, natch).  The two hit it off in a sort of cute way, and Celine agrees to keep Jesse company in Vienna overnight, as he wiles the hours away until morning for his flight back to the US.  They spend most of the time ambling through Vienna - through its old streets, along the Danube and the even check out that Ferris Wheel from \\"The Third Man\\" (Harry Lime does not make an appearance, and neither of our heroes brave the Viennese sewers).  \\"Before\\" may be a scripted follow-up to Linklater's earlier \\"Slacker\\" - substituting Austin, TX with Vienna.  Though the flick boils down to an extended conversation, Delpy and Hawke develop a tender chemistry that goes beyond the abstract philosophy of their conversation (Jesse muses that rich and poor children are similarly neglected; Celine muses that some people easily and unwittingly give their lives up to work, never thinking of their own enjoyment).  The plot never builds up any tension - any sense that their relationship is heading for something, but that's the point.  By the time they part ways, we realize that both of our heroes struggled to be as open and friendly as possible with a total stranger each knows will never be seen again.  The pay-off comes at the end as we say the pain of their separation.  In a montage of Vienna the next morning, as the camera lingers on those spots graced by Jesse and Celine - now washed by sunshine but bereft of their company (or anybody else's).  The loss is palpable.  If anything, \\"Before\\" may be a companion to \\"Movable Feast\\", Hemingway's ode to pre-WWII Paris.  Unlike Paris, Linklater seems to be saying, Vienna is delicacy that you can't take with you.  So stick around as long as you can, and savor every bite.  Either way, you know you'll never leave satisfied.
B000089RVX|5.0|I'm in the collegiate media, and I found out about this band weeks before they even release &quot;BMTL&quot; as a single.  This group has so much great music outside of Fallen, and there are numerous web-sites where you can go to find some of their original works, which I think is even better (if there is such a thing) than this CD.<br />Easily this is one of the 5 best CDs I've purchased in the last year...so much so, that I wore out my first copy from playing it so much.  Now I also have to re-burn all the compilations of their older material I came into contact with because it's about 2 steps from being worn out.
B00000AFDW|2.0|In 1996, the original foursome of KISS regrouped and embarked on a massively successful world tour, which lasted a little over a year. During that time, the hoopla, crazed fan hysteria, magazine coverage, television appearances and, of course, merchandising were all on a level near or equal to the band's halcyon days of the mid to late 1970's. The massive popularity and glory had returned, and the KISS juggernaut was huge once again.<br />When Paul, Gene, Peter and Ace returned to the studio in early 1998 to record their first full studio album together since 1977's \\"Love Gun\\" (Peter was replaced by \\"ghost\\" drummer Anton Fig on all but one track on 1979's \\"Dynasty\\"), the stakes and pressure were high. Could the original band once again create something as classic and memorable as such 1976 albums as \\"Destroyer\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Over\\"? Sadly, the answer is no. Although there are a few strong tracks here, the album as a whole is a big disappointment.<br />\\"Psycho Circus\\" (the song) starts things off in fine fashion. It's an epic, sweeping and brilliant rock masterpiece, one that feels like a fish out of water on this release. Only two other songs, also co-penned by Paul, really work here. \\"I Pledge Allegiance To The State Of Rock & Roll\\" and \\"Raise Your Glasses\\" are both catchy enough numbers to recall the band's 1970's life-affirming world view, yet both feel like they could have been originally written for 1987's \\"Crazy Nights\\".<br />Everything else falls short, on a myriad of levels. Paul's \\"Dreamin'\\" And Gene's \\"Within\\" are actually two of the best tracks on \\"Psycho Circus\\", but don't fit in stylistically. Seeing as both were originally written for their previous effort, \\"Carnival Of Souls - The Final Sessions\\" (recorded in 1995, but not released until 1997), it's easy to see why. That album was dark and grunge-inspired, and a reflection of the rock landscape of the mid-nineties. Although the two songs are worthy numbers for a KISS album, they don't belong on something that was supposed to be (at least ideally) a continuation of the primal and self-indulgent pure rock fun this quartet concocted in its heyday.<br />The rest of the album ranges from average to insipid and lame. Ace Frehley's \\"Into The Void\\" is okay, but not in the same league with previous gems such as \\"Shock Me\\" or \\"Rocket Ride\\". \\"You Wanted The Best\\" is rather laughable and utterly forgettable, and the Paul Stanley / Bob Ezrin penned ballad \\"I Finally Found My Way\\" (sung by Peter) is overly sappy and edgeless. The two songs which close each album side, \\"We Are One\\" and \\"Journey Of 1,000 Years\\" (both written by Gene), sound as misguided and un-KISS like as 1981's \\"Music From The Elder\\". Neither one is terrible, but they are watered down and wimpy tracks which feel out of place here. The recurring theme on \\"Psycho Circus\\" is that most of it is confused and not what you would have expected or hoped for from the original KISS.<br />Like \\"Dynasty\\", the last album released by the original foursome until this one, \\"Psycho Circus\\" is completely unfocused and pulls the listener in too many directions. It's not singular in its purpose like \\"Destroyer\\", \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" or \\"Love Gun\\". Also, like \\"Dynasty\\" (as well as 1980's \\"Unmasked\\"), too much of the music is second rate. This album is nowhere near as good as 1992's \\"Revenge\\", which actually feels and sounds much more like the classic makeup days than this. It's common knowledge that even Ace and Peter aren't crazy about the material presented on \\"Psycho Circus\\". Clearly, and not surprisingly, Paul and Gene were calling all the shots. If you're looking for a great KISS release from the nineties, buy \\"Revenge\\" or \\"Alive III\\" instead. Don't be fooled by the hype surrounding this album. It may be the original group reunited, but it fails to live up to expectations. Which is unfortunate, because this could have been a monster.

B0000931OG|4.0|Let me start by saying that I deliberately avoided this album after reading so many negative reviews and of reading of the departure of Coxon. I liked Damon's side project the Gorillaz (now his main project?), but that album exhibited one of the biggest problems I've always had with Albarn in spades: his propensity for meandering and lazy over self-indulgence. So when critics accused him of forcing Coxon out and dominating Blur's latest direction, I had understandable apprehension and low expectations. <br />It's true, Blur are not the band they once were, but that's not to say that they're irrelevant or finished. &quot;Think Tank&quot; has already divided the Blur camp in half: there are those who pine for the guitar rock glory days of &quot;The Great Escape&quot; or &quot;Parklife&quot; and then there are those who find this new direction at least interesting and experimental. It's the classic dilemna of any band: 1. stay in a holding pattern to appease the fans of your catalogue, or 2. forge ahead in a new direction and risk alienation. Radiohead and U2 have already grappled with this issue with successful and mixed results. As much as I'm a Blur fan, I'm not necessarily married to the sound of older Blur. I think they've made a few great albums but they've never made a true, perfect bonafide classic (Great Escape comes the closest for me), and I no longer expect them to. Blur are no more a &quot;band&quot; now than XTC are, as this band is now more or less the vision of one dominant member. But so what. I'll give credit to Albarn for keeping it interesting and still managing to squeeze in a pop gem here and there (Out of Time, Crazy Beat). The disc grows on you with repeated listens. But it just wouldn't be Albarn without some meaningless meandering, now would it? So you get that too on &quot;Think Tank&quot;.
B000089RVX|5.0|This album is the best Ive heard in a long time.  &quot;My Immortal&quot; made me cry.  I dont know why but Amy Lee's voice just made me feel as though I was in that situation.  &quot;Hello&quot;  gave me chills especially towards the end.  I love this album and would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
B00009TB5G|5.0|When I went to see this movie, I was skeptical, being not a big fan of the first Lord of the Rings installment and never having read the books, however, I was pleasantly surprised.  Actually, that's an understatement.  I was blown away by the action, the acting, and most of all, the amount of effort everyone working on the movie had put into it.  The battle of Helms Deep is spectacular, the cast is great (especially the intensely sexy Viggo Mortensen), but the animation is amazing.  Gollum is just wonderful, he's my favourite character, and the ents are quite good.  I can't say enough complimentary things about this movie, it's just something you have to see for yourself.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to see something mind-blowingly exciting but not too intense.
B00008GKEG|5.0|The Anthology in DVD is something that every fan of the Beatles must get. If you are not a fan of the beatles (is there any?) this is your oportunity to get something of the best group of alltime. You can see John, George, Paul and Ringo since they were kids, their beginnings, the beatlemania, their tours, the making of the records, theirs films, sessions of their recordins, but maybe the most valuable is in the fith DVD &quot;SPECIAL FEATURES&quot; where you can see Paul, Ringo and George talking and singing. You can't miss the Anthology.
B0000025DV|5.0|ELO is simply the best rock band ever. They really are. Their the first to blend violins in with rock n' roll music and make it sound really cool. The electronic bits and pieces in the songs are well done and are not overdone with too much. Some people consider <BR>ELO as a disco band but thats all bullcrap. Anyways, Out of the Blue is probably the 3rd best CD that ELO has, followed by A New World Record at #1 and Face the Music at #2. All ELO fans should agree with me that this is a well done CD with excellent songs. Not to mention it's 2 albums put into one CD. <br />For all ELO fans out there, I suggest you buy this, Face the Music, A New World Record, Secret Messages, Time, Strange Magic:Best of ELO, and Balance of Power. Those are all ELO's greatest albums. Enjoy!
B000000W6R|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins have outdone most any band from the 90s that made their mark on the alternative rock scene. Why? If you listen to the fuzzy crunch of siamese dream, and the beautiful mellow rock of Mellon Collie, and of course, this album...an album that would stand the test of time for a B-Sides collection, Pisces Iscariot, you would see why.<br />This is no ordinary B-Sides compilation that was thrown together from old discarded songs and demos that were plain jane material. All of the Pumpkins' material, and I mean ALL of it...everything from album cuts, to radio hits, to B-Sides, to stuff that never surfaced until the band broke up was worthy of an open ear and a good listen. I'll review each song as I see it.<br />Soothe - 4/5. A Very mellow, sad acoustic ballad about loneliness and being hungry. One of Billy's old acoustic demos from the siamese era. It was recorded in his apartment bedroom, and you can hear rainy traffic.<br />Frail and Bedazzled - 4/5. A nice, short, mellow rocker with some real 'tude to it. Corgan's solo is pretty fun to hear in this one.<br />Plume - 4/5. Taken from the I Am One single, this fuzzed-out Slow Rocker is a nice little song that takes the album into a different side of the pumpkins.<br />Whir - 4/5. Possibly the mellowest song on the album, this song is respected by many, hated by few. It seems to have a bit of a country twist to it.<br />Blew Away - 3/5. From the James Iha collection. This song never really struck me, but it seems like a nice little song that your girlfriend would like.<br />Pissant - 4/5. A nice two minute rocker with some super fast powerchords and some attitude. Got me a raygun, got me an attitude...<br />Hello Kitty Kat - 4/5. A Slow Rocker that flanges in and out of your speakers on high octane fuzz.<br />Obscured - 5/5. This song is a very nice song that seems to go nowhere but inspires you and captures you nonetheless. Taken from the Today single.<br />Landslide - 3/5. Not the best job of singing by Corgan, and it's not the best cover they've ever done. In my opinion, Dancing In The Moonlight would have better fit in Landslide's Place.<br />Starla - 5/5. Nothing is perfect, but this song gets a five from me, because this is pure Pumpkins. Take it, put it in a jar, add water, shake it up, which ever way you want. This song is raw Pumpkin power. It starts off with a slow rhythm, leaves out with an Asus2 chord...then kick on the dirtbox and VROOM!! This thing takes off. The 6 minute jam session after the actual song is finished is amazing. Don't skip over this one.<br />Blue - 4/5. A nice little rocker that will make you want to get up and dance. This song takes several twists and turns. As soon as it's done rocking, then it slows to a mellow pace, then starts rocking again. Great song!<br />Girl Named Sandoz - 3/5. An Animals' Cover, not the best, but it's a good song to get up and dance to.<br />La Dolly Vita - 5/5. Taken from the Tristessa vinyl. I understand why it was a B-Side. It would have never fit with the distorted fury of Gish. Sort of reminiscent of Crush, this is one of my favorite songs from the Pumpkins. Absolutely beautiful.<br />Spaced - 3/5. Sounds like something I would do myself. Expiramental sounds and passing voices in and out. Not really a song, but a good closure for this collection.<br />Smashing Pumpkins were a great band, and this album proves it. This is no ordinary B-Sides album, this is solid material. I don't even understand why some bands release B-Side albums, because most of the B-Sides really really don't go anywhere. The Pumpkins however break through those barriers and provide us with some very listenable stuff.singing by Corgan, and it's not the best cover they've ever done.

B000089RVX|5.0|This cd is one of the best I've heard in awhile. Most cds have a few good songs, I love all the songs on this one.. It's a must buy!
B00005JLR2|4.0|Though this movie has been out quite a while, I saw it for the first time last night after borrowing it from my wife's boss.<br />The story follows a young boy that was abandoned by his father at a young age, and became rebellious and arrogant as a teenager. He even has a ponytail, an earring, and a flying skateboard/hovercraft/wind surfboard! He is arrested by the robot police for skate/flying in a restricted area, and his mother is upset at him for ruining his future by getting into so much trouble.<br />A space ship crashes close to their house, and the owner of the ship gives the boy, Jim, a small sphere before he dies. The sphere turns out to be a map to Treasure Planet, a legendary planet that contains the plundered treasure of 1,000 worlds.<br />Jim saw this good fortune as a way to turn his life around and prove his worth to himself and everyone else, while also becoming terribly rich in the process. He set off with long-time family friend Doctor Doppler who used his life savings to commission a boat for the long trek across the galaxy to Treasure Planet.<br />The crew of the ship they end up on is rather questionable at best, and it is quickly apparent that they are not the friendliest bunch one could hope to be aboard a ship with. Regardless, Jim becomes friends with John Silver, the cook on the ship and eventually comes to see him as a surrogate father figure.<br />There are a few twists and turns in the plot, but you have to remember this is a Disney movie, so it's pretty easy to see them coming from about the first ten minutes of the movie.<br />Cliche'd storyline aside, I thought the movie was pretty entertaining. The animation is great, with a combination of impressive 3D renders for the backgrounds and environment, and hand-drawn 2d animation for the main characters.<br />The \\"world\\" of the movie is interesting as well, combining elements of the traditional pirate universe with space ships and cyborgs. This allows the artists quite a bit of freedom to come up with whatever they can think of, and makes for a visually rich movie.<br />The best part of the entire movie however was the little side-kick character Morph, who, in my opinion is quite possibly the cutest cartoon character ever. He's basically a pink blob that can float and morph into any object he wishes. He provides most of the comedic relief in the movie by morphing into objects and illustrating certain jokes. He generally brought a smile to my face every time he was on the screen.<br />Overall the movie was entertaining in a Disney Cartoon way, and as long as you don't watch it with the expectation of an engrossing and original storyline, I think you can find some enjoyment in it. Heck, I'd watch it again just to see Morph.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is the best new group in a long time.  I became hooked the first time I heard &quot;Bring me to life&quot; on the radio.  I bought the cd and realized that this group will be around for a while.  The music is both heavy and melodic, and incorporates many different styles into one.  Truly the album of the year.  If you don't have it, get it!
B0000062GK|5.0|Forget all the whining about playing 16 notes when you can play one.  Joe has given us ample examples of his ability to slow down things in the past and play with a minimum of notes.   This album is quite simply hard melodic rock at its best. Every song is a winner.  This is probably the worlds best work out tape.  His mastery of the instrument is on full display, as he seemingly effortlessly ripps through 32nd notes.  If you love vinne moore at his best or steve vai at his you will love this album.
B00006CXXU|4.0|When I first bought this cd i had the intention of only listening to about one song, but after giving it a try I realized that Christina Aguilera put alot of hard work into it and developed really good songs like \\"Fighter\\" and \\"Can't Hold us down\\". Actually I like this cd most out of all the one's she has so far made. I would recommend anyone to buy this cd.. you might find alot of it impressive!
B00005JLT5|3.0|I liked the film in general. It was an unbelievable story and Brody was terrific in the part. However, as it rolled on in the theatre I found myself ticking off when the ghetto uprising would start, when the deportations would start, when the russians would start, and realized that, inspite of it being an absolutely horrific period in history, the pacing of this movie is way too familiar. For me it di not have the heartbreaking drama of Schindler's story, and in fact seemed too often to too closely mirror it.<BR>I was not aware that this was a true story (I tend to live under a rock), so I thought some of what this poor man goes through to be incredulous, and when it looked like he might be shot at the end by mistake, I presumed it was just another manifestation of Polanski's sick imagination. Finding out that it was true did not move me any closer to the heart of the story. See for yourself. As a film, it has undeniable strong points technically. As a story, I just kept thinking that this was redundantly Schindler.
B00005B36H|3.0|This album was good but not great. It is the kind of album you can listen to onced and thats it.It had a good base and a few great songs but it was bogged down with the slow drab songs.The patient i a good song and so is Parabola.I think Tool is beginning to let the artistic value of the music over shadow the musics thought..I love Tool they are my favorite band This album would be great if there was no such thing as nima and Undertow.Its a good CD to have in your collection even if it is not the best. If you want to get into Tool try listening to songs like Sober,Prisonsex, stinkfist. Tool's Great songs can bring a person to tears because of the emotional vibe.All the members of Tool are good musicians but in lateralus they seem to repeat riffs and the lyrics are kind of dull.Its not a waste of money but you shouldn't obsess over it :)
0671027573|4.0|What a great book!  It's a perfect escape read.  I finished it in one sitting!  It's hard to put down.  Jaine Bright is a wonderful main character.  She's not one of those annoying, helpless, whining types you see so often in books nowadays.  Highly recommended.
B00007M5CO|2.0|I dont understand all the buzz about this record. Maybe is that everything that comes out from Santaolallas factory always is well received by the record industry (he is part of it, in fact). Basically, Bajofondo is electronic stuff with some tango hints, but i dont think you can call it &quot;tango&quot; at all. One of the most important things on tango is the lyrics and you can not found (or even listen to) any single lyric here. And for the electronic side, there are many other artists that build a better relationship between genres. Karsh Kale for example, or Natacha Atlas, who can keep it natural, let say, as a way of express something that is there and not as an intelectual (and commercial) excercise.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|You feel like you gotta hold your breath while panning the entire expanse of the landscape on this amazingly photographed motion picture. Every man's face is a canvas of brazenness. Every rock is a minor character. The words are scarce because the natural scenery says so much by being so austere and the characters rather act than talk.
6305252521|4.0|I must confess that I don't care for most modern television and motion pictures.  Modern productions seem to always have generous helpings of foul language, sex, vomiting and bathroom scenes, but this film is a notable exception.  Here, the human condition as experienced in the early 21st century is explored in a humorous and satirical way, but with real questions about man's search for meaning, both as an individual and in society in general being explored.  This film uncannily anticipated what so-called \\"reality\\" television would be like, showing that \\"reality\\" as perceived by Hollywood, or rather, what Hollywood perceives people thinking reality is, is something out of a nightmare.  Perceptive viewers will note that the \\"town\\" Truman lives in is very similar in some ways to \\"the village\\" seen in the classic television series \\"The Prisoner\\" starring Patrick McGoohan, including people aimlessly riding about on bicycles.  Although everything seems nice and ordered, it is a sterile world filled with artificial emotions and constant surveillance.  Jim Carrey, whom I was not a big fan of before seeing this film puts in a stellar performance, appearing in almost every scene of the film and Ed Harris plays his usual authoritarian-type character in a chilling way.<br />Today, \\"freedom\\" is defined as \\"doing whatever you want\\" (e.g. \\"if it feels good, do it!\\"), but the Founding Fathers of the United States regarded it rather as the ability to reach one's maximum potential without artificial, outside constraints, even if this proves to be difficult and uncomfortable (one example being the homesteaders of the 19th century American West who actually often faced great dangers in exercising their freedom).  This is the choice that is confronted in this motion picture.  Although the ending doesn't really present the choice in these stark terms, Truman must make his decision and live with the consequences.
B000002MFQ|3.0|Like Douglas Adams and a few other British prodigies, Mike Oldfield has had a couple of decades to face the fact that his first major work was his best.  So much effort, so much innovation ... and so many baths ... go into that first album that the rest of your career becomes a bit of a downer.  There's always the optimism as you set out on each new project that this will be the one, and there's always the consolation of the money that rolls in from that first project.  Whether it was TUBULAR BELLS or THE HITCHHIKERS' GUIDE TO THE GALAXY, you know that what your audience prized above all else was the work's originality.  It is very, very, very hard to produce a second work that is as strikingly original as the first.<br />Actually Oldfield produced a couple of decent follow-ups in the form of HERGEST RIDGE and OMMADAWN, both different from TUBULAR BELLS, but clearly from the same pen.<br />TUBULAR BELLS not only warmed up an audience so that it could move on to Steve Reich's MUSIC FOR 18 MUSICIANS.  It also spawned much of the New Age movement.  I suspect that what Oldfield wanted to achieve with TUBULAR BELLS II was to take advantage of the great improvements in recording techniques since 1973, and to cash in on the New Age surge which he could justifiably claim to have started.<br />So what he did was to take the score for TUBULAR BELLS, tweak a note here and there, substitute Alan Rickman for Vivian Stanshall (who regrettably had died in a fire at home), swap out his Farfisa organ for the latest hi-tech keyboard wizardry, bring in a few female voices, and go into the recording studio with Trevor Horn (ex-Yes, Buggles, Frankie etc) and Tom Newman (the original producer of TUBULAR BELLS).<br />For me the overall emotional effect of this album, despite some highlights, is annoyance; it's close to Bells, but it isn't Bells.  The way to improve on Bells is to enhance the sound reproduction, which he has done through the release of the SACD version.<br />Perhaps the best I can say of this album, by way of a warning, is that it's better than TUBULAR BELLS III.st I can say of this album, by way of a warning, is that it's better than TUBULAR BELLS III.
B0000027RL|5.0|This review is primarilly for those of you who are younger than 20, recent immigrants, classical music snobs, 50 year old poseurs, or anyone interested in some Rock and Roll history.  The rest of should already be familair with this amazing album and what it meant, what it stands for and why it is important.    This is really where music began for me.  I was 12 when I first got it and I didn't understand a word of it I just knew that I loved it.  This was the album everyone was listening to and in the early 90's so all you NickleBack and Staind fans can put down that [stuff] and go pick this up you won't be dissapointed.  This CD represented a change from the norm and started off the best carreer of any current Rock band whose origins aren't from the 60's.    Every song on this album is a masterpice.  From the opening rif on Once to the emotional climax of Release this album is perfect.  Perfect guitar riffs, perfect voice, perfect length, even perfect song order placement which is important by the way.  This is the artistical interpretation of malcontent, angst, release and appathy.  Probably my favorite studio album of the nineties, if you like any of today's rock and wonder who this band Pearl Jam is and why they play their mediocre stuff, get this album and you will see what I am talking about.  Having seen them live twice I must say that they really do need to be heard live but only once you have heard the originals here.  Unfortunately the album was so good that they never were able to reproduce the magic although their next two attempts (Vs. and Vitology) were amazing \\"must haves\\" as well.  I know few real music fans born between 75-82 who don't have this.     Bottom Line:  All you teeny boppers and fans of American Idol need to go out and become listeners of rock and roll and this is a great place to start.  This will introduce you into the world of something we call instruments and original song writing.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|This is exactly how I describe Gavin Degraw to my friends, John Mayer with a piano. &quot;Chariot&quot; is a great album, it's absolutely solid. You don't run across such a CD very often. Check it out, I know you won't be dissapointed.
B00005AUBA|4.0|I first bought this album 2 years ago when it first came out. It was my least favorite Mogwai LP when i first got it, simply because i love them for their loud-soft-brutally loud trademark dynamics. However, after listening to this LP for 2 years, it has grown on me tremendously and is now one of my favorite albums. I agree with a lot of people that have posted a review that &quot;young team&quot; is their best LP, because it is. But &quot;Rock Action&quot; is just as brilliant, but you can't look at it the came as &quot;Young Team,&quot; because the albums are completely different concepts. My advice: listen to it all the way through one time. If you aren't convinced, listen to &quot;2 Rights Make 1 Wrong&quot; on repeat. It is by far my favorite Mogwai piece of all time. It is built upon a simple guitar melody. But don't be decieved, it is anything but repetitive. There are a myriad of counter-melodies that beautifully fade in and out of the piece making for a truly memorable track that takes me through my entire lifetime in the form of a musical slide show. Buy this album, it will take you to places you never thought music could take you to.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin IV, as many have come to call it, is a very well constructed album.  The best thing about the album is the atmosphere it creates.  It begins with \\"Black Dog,\\" a song that starts with just Robert Plant's soaring vocals and then blows you away with one of the most recognizable riffs in rock and roll.  Speaking of \\"Rock and Roll,\\" that's the next song.  \\"Rock and Roll\\" is pure Led Zeppelin, and nothing could define the band better than this song.  It's pure blues and pure rock at the same time.  \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" is a great transition to stairway, with its chiming mandolin and medeival imagery.  Stairway is the climax of the album, as the song itself builds up from a slow, lonesome sound to a nice trippy solo from Jimmy Page.  Page is the man here.  \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" is a great song with a lazy riff that picks your jaw up off the floor after Stairway.  It gets the job done.  Next is \\"Four Sticks,\\" kind of a tribute to Bonham, and it is more experimental but doesn't leave the blues flavor behind.  \\"Going to California\\" is a beautiful acoustic song with an altered tuning, and it balances out the album nicely.  You should hear the version of this song on \\"How the West Was Won,\\" as it was played in California.  And to top it all off, a nice cover of \\"When the Levee Breaks.\\"  Pure blues, and again, pure Zep.  I enjoy listening to this album while driving down a mountain road.  Some may shun it because they think it's overrated, but just listen to the music for a change and you'll hear how great this album is.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|This CD is a great place to start for anyone who does not have any or many Beatles CDs.  It offers a wide perspective of their career, from the first hit to the last and contains many great singles - &quot;Something,&quot; &quot;Yesterday,&quot; &quot;Paperback Writer.&quot;  Because it is limited to their number 1 hits, however, many great songs were left off... unavoidably.  Such great albums as &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and &quot;Abbey Road&quot; should not be overlooked, but &quot;Beatles: One&quot; offers a paraphrasing of a great era of songwriting and performing.
B00005YW4H|2.0|&quot;Come Fly Away With Me&quot;, the grammy award winning CD by Norah Jones is basically an exercise of lifeless, slow moving songs, that would be perfectly suited for a lounge singer.  The best song on the Cd &quot;Don't know Why&quot;, has received tremendous airplay, which along with five grammy awards, has kept this CD on the top of the charts.  The problem here is that most of the songs on this Cd, are both lifeless and boring.  Can one really tell the difference between songs like &quot;The Nearness Of You&quot;, &quot;Nightingale&quot;, or &quot;Shoot The Moon&quot;.  Listening to this shlock is like a sleeping pill.  Don't get me wrong, Ms Jones is a fine musician, but to shower this production with 5 grammy awards is laughable!  She is going to have her 15 minutes of fame, but I don't think she is going to be a music mainstreamer for long?  This Cd is going to turn up in used cd shops in large numbers for sure.  Singer Phoebe Snow, could sing these songs while being half asleep?  Overall, I found this CD very uneventful and loaded with material that is no more than average.
B00005QG9J|5.0|What can be expressed in words regarding this work other than calling it a visionary masterpiece? It is a mindboggling album that I never have gotton tired of. Before Morning View came out, I passed up Incubus for being a mediocre band but I really was not paying attention to how much is going on in that band. Great songwriter, their guitarist is extremely disciplined and is a younger Tom Morello who doesnt get deserved credit, an extremely skilled bassist and drummer who have a wonderful connection, and not to mention, A MELODIC DJ! This DJ actully has a smooth rhythmic section in the band which I highly respect. The bottom line is, if you want an album that has the potential to change the history of music, this is the one. I would write more about the actual songs, but i could go on for days on that.
B000089RVX|5.0|I saw the video for bring me to life and knew that I wanted the album.  At first it left me a little cold but then I started listening to it a bunch and I'm completley hooked.  The guitar riffs and angelic vocals should be enough to make anyone want to buy this cd.<BR>Go get it. NOW

I immediately went out and bought the CD and absolutely love it!  I recommend it to everyone, because all the songs are so different that there's bound to be one on there that you will like!
B00005JLKB|4.0|I first heard about this series from a friend, and thought nothing of it, as it sounded like it would last a year or two max.  Regretedly, I didnt actually get to see an episode until the season 1 finale, and boy was i wrong.  I have been a fan of Superman since i was 4 or 5, and this is a show i never thought would make it until i actually saw it. <br />Admitedly, the show can cheesy at times, and sometimes a bit sappy as well, but nonetheless, it is always entertaining and making you beg for more.  <br />Highlights of the show are always those scenes with Clark and Lex.  These scenes are very fun to watch, as you know that these two will eventually become arch enemies, which is quite sad if you see this show, where lex is actually a good guy.  <br />Aside from Clark and Lex, the second best part of the show is when Clark is actually using his powers.  For example, in the episode \\"Duplicity\\", Pete, after finding out about Clark's powers, challenges Clark to a game of basketball.  Clark agrees and quickly jumps 60 or 70 feet in the air and slam dunks the ball. Other such events throughout the seasons make this show extremely entertaining.  <br />The acting is decent, although not stellar, with the exception of Lex, who is superb.  Aside from that, the show is great, and shows great promise, especially with the great ending to season 2.  <br />Im definately going to buy this dvd in september, and i recommend it to everyone, so you can see this show without commercials!
B00005JM09|2.0|Well, Well, Well, where do I start? I completely love the first and expecially the second Terminator movie. Sadly the third incarnation is a complete joke. The film completely fails to reel me in. The acting, humor, dialogue, and some actors are inadequate and simplistic. The plot is, basically, nearly the same as T2 and the music does not add momentum to the scenes. By the way, The machines must realize that going back in time will not change the future outcome simply because the time travel events are a direct result of the future events and they cannot be altered (it is a paradox). Overall: BAD.
B00003CXCW|5.0|I forgot how much I loved this movie. Is there a greater character than Norma Desmond? Over 50 years after this movie was released, people are still quoting her dialogue. I happened to catch SB by chance on AMC a few years ago and it's become one of those films I can watch over and over again. This movie is smart and funny storytelling without having to use gratitious sex, violence or cursing.<br />Everything about this movie is perfect from the writing and sets to Billy Wilder's direction. The opening and closing scenes have to be among the greatest in the history of film. William Holden's subtle and smart alecky acting plays well against Gloria Swanson's over the top Norma. Although they weren't the first choices, it's hard to imagine anyone besides Holden and Swanson in these roles as they nailed their characters perfectly. Erich Von Streim as Max and Cecil B. Demille as himself are also great.<br />Wilder's sense of mishief pervades this movie and one suspects that he had much of Hollywood squirming when Sunset Boulevard was first released. In lesser hands this movie could have been a disaster. It's hard to believe that the movie won no Academy Awards.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Great soundtrack to a great movie! I love how there's so much &quot;action&quot; in the songs, it's a great buy if you want to re-live the movie, although it is rather short compared to the movie length (about 45 minutes) The two songs that seem to run throughout the movie can be found on track 2 &quot;The Medallion Calls&quot; and the final track, &quot;He's a Pirate&quot;, and also on track 11.
0385504209|4.0|The aspect of the novel that I found to be the most interesting was that it brought up a very unique interpretation of religous history. Immediatly after reading the book, I wanted to research some of the more esoteric points of the novel myself. The story is fairly clever. So clever, in fact, that I was somewhat dissapointed by the ending because Dan Brown's writing made me expect something more interesting. Overall, I would suggest that someone read this novel if he has an interest in history or will enjoy a read that might be somewhat educational. However, I did not find myself greatly entertained at any point of the novel. My interest peaked at several points in the story, but I quickly lost interest at other points. My general impression is that book merits 4 to 4.5 stars.
B00005JLTN|5.0|It seems audiences have been 'dumbed down' by the lastest trend of rehashing old movies or plots and giving them a 'new' feel when really they are simply full of lame clichès to keep audiences oooh and aweing at something that has been done a hundred times in the past -only now with better looking special effects-.  The Matrix Reloaded, however, is a perfect example of a movie that takes an original idea (the first Matrix), and builds on it with even more plot twists and unexpected turns.  All the hope that the climax of the last movie gave viewers was taken away when we realize what is actually happening.  A sense of impending doom leaves a sour taste in your mouth, and you can only hope they survive what will be the final battle between the Machines and the Humans.  Most people didn't like it because either they couldn't grasp the story, or it wasn't as promising in the end as the last one was.  It is the same with most movies.  Hype builds up on a movie and we get these ridiculous expectations that it will cater to the masses when really the original was truly meant for a select crowd whom the creators were trying to reach.  Don't feel bad if you didn't like it, the true fans who grasped the Matrix for what it really was (aside from the special effects) all seem to understand and appreciate what is a truly great movie with so much more added on to the mystique and philosophy of the original.  They could not have done a better job.  The pressure they felt creating this one to make it a 'commercial' success obviously didn't reach the Watchowski brothers, and luckily they kept the original essense of the story intact.<br />The special effects were great as well.  The freeway scene is definately something that has never been done (or tried) before.  Neo's growing powers and realization of what we believe is the truth so far (until we see the next and get thrown into another plot twist) was excellent.  Cold hearted programs and personality conflicts within the Matrixand Zion were very true to any group of people trying to survive with what they believe are their best options.  And the rave scene, I'm terribly sorry if this small portion of the movie ruined your idea of a 2 dimensional action movie...  you obviously missed something.  Go ahead and watch Charlie's Angels, that movie was a little more catered for your needs.  Those who immersed themselves in the story of this world and it's Matrix will gladly wait for the third movie, understandning that it is truly a story for survival where we are merely viewing the events of a world the Watchowskis created, and not a commercial attraction where we go in for our special effects fix thankful for another rehash of what's been done a hundred times before.<br />All in all this was an excellent example of good storytelling by the Watchowski brothers.  Buy the movie, sit back and enjoy over two hours of one of our generations greatest achievements in visual entertainment.
0780631684|2.0|I really don't understand why some people liked this movie so much. I suppose the movie's premise deserves some credit for its originality (a rarity in horror films these days), but basically it just seemed to degrade into a bunch of utterly ridiculous, Rube-Goldberg-type ways for the victims to die.  If you saw some of these scenes by themselves, you'd think they were taken straight out of a comedic parody like &quot;Scary Movie&quot;.  And don't expect any real logic in the storyline either.  Why is the main character suddenly having these premonitions? What makes him so special? And why doesn't &quot;Death&quot; simply hit them with a lightning bolt, instead of going through all these impossibly complicated machinations? Normally I like to suspend disbelief in a good horror flick, but the absurdity of the situations just kept bringing me back to these fundamental questions. If you're just looking for a light, tongue-in-cheek suspense/horror movie, this will do.  But there are other movies with similar premises that have far more interesting characters and a more intriguing study of fate, death, and what would happen if you were blessed (or cursed) with such knowledge (Cronenberg's &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; with Christopher Walken comes to mind).
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin parks debut album named after their former band name, hybrid theory, is an impressive combination of electro pop/scratch beats, yelling , rapping, and heavy guitar riffs.<BR>The whole album lasts only 37 minutes but thats made up for with quality.Cure for the itch is a great scrattchy techno style turntable workout. In the end is a yelling chorus with rapping verses, just like the rest of the album, but this one sticks out because of the bass and piano riffs. One step closer is a Limp Bizkit style song with Mike and Chester yelling pieces of the chorus at each other, and was the first single on the air that started it all for LP. Crawling is an interesting song in which chester sings the verses and is stoped from being dull by the interesting keyboard riff.   favorite songs: In the end, One step closer, Crawling and Cure for the itch.
B000002C1W|4.0|Pink Floyd, at the time of this album's release, was still reeling from the departure of Roger Waters--a battle that had begun during The Wall and continued even past his departure, almost (but not quite) into legal wrangling.  David Gilmour, in typical style, was not going to &quot;go down easy&quot;.  With him was Nick Mason.  Halfway into the album they were joined by Richard Wright, who was perhaps still a bit unsteady on his feet after his coerced departure during The Wall.  His presence on Momentary Lapse was more of a future promise than anything--his nearly inaudible vocals on &quot;Sorrow&quot; (&quot;One world, one soul...&quot;) require a sharp ear to detect, and his keyboard contributions are somewhat few, although I do think his distinctive Hammond organ appears on a few songs.  But in spite of this limitation, I still believe this album is worthy of credit.<br />The album may indeed have an 80's sound, but this is certainly not the 80's of &quot;Safety Dance&quot;.  To me, Momentary Lapse represents the *best* of that decade's possibilities--yes, the sound is &quot;harder&quot; than you might find before or after, but I greatly prefer this slightly edgier sound to the pureed feel of current pop music.  Although thematically not as unified as its predecessors, there is a definite flow in the *mood* of the album, from a guardedly optimistic beginning to a hopeless, bitter end.  The sound clips are well placed to augment the running themes.<br />To me, all of the songs on this album have a place--even the much maligned &quot;A New Machine&quot; songs.  Really, they were never *meant* to serve as full songs, but as interstitial pieces, they do fine at highlighting the atmosphere of desolation that sets in at the end of the album.  The second half of the album, by the way (from &quot;Yet Another Movie&quot; forward) is where the strongest songs are, contrary to what some reviewers have said.  Not only are the songs here the best (think of the fantastic &quot;Sorrow&quot;, &quot;Yet Another Movie&quot;, and &quot;Terminal Frost&quot;), but the flow of the mood is most coherent here.  The first half has good tracks as well, but is slightly choppier in flow.  My particular favorites on the first half are &quot;Signs of Life&quot; and &quot;One Slip&quot; (&quot;Learning to Fly&quot; is good but I prefer it by far on PULSE).  Even the songs I did not mention are still good tracks.  Mr. Gilmour's lyric-writing is actually very good even if he doesn't show the conceptual inclinations of Roger Waters, and his guitar playing most certainly hasn't suffered.<br />It may seem surprising for an ardent Richard Wright fan to rate this album so highly, given his limited involvement--but even after all this time, I can't help still having a huge soft spot for this album.  Besides, Mr. Gilmour isn't half bad as a keyboardist--just as on his first solo album, it's clear he has a rather underrated talent.  Yes, it is in part because of the band's difficult circumstances that I give the high rating...but even now I can't help but be impressed at how well Pink Floyd pulled through its darkest hour.  It is a fine predecessor to The Division Bell.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Meteora is a great collection of hybrid theory amplified. The whole album only lasts 36 minutes and once again, just like Hybrid Theory, Quality makes up for that. Somewhere I Belong is a great first single off their album and has a resemblance to many songs on Hybrid Theory. Breaking the habit is linkin park acoustic. Thats all I gotta say for this song. And,Lying from you is another killer track which is almost system of a down, aerials material. Favorite songs: Somewhere I Belong, Breaking the Habit, Lying From You.

B0000041Q3|5.0|Puccini's Turandot is a masterpiece that is finally getting the recognition it deserves. I feel the music is as great as that of Tosca or Butterfly and infinitely better than Boheme. <BR>I notice the debate is whether Sutherland is the supreme Turandot or the worst. I would say she is neither. She is the best Turandot in the recording studio. She might not be able to sing it at La Scala. But in the studio she fulfills Puccini's demands for the title role. The voice is rich, powerful and very beautiful. Unlike Nilsson, who shows no emotions as Turandot, Sutherland shows all the facets of Turandot unlike her rival, the very respectable but less believeable Nilsson. I love Nilsson as Brunhilde but not Puccini. And I believe if Puccini is alive he would agree.<BR>Pavarotti is very very good as Prince Calaf. The tenor has a well known honeydew sweet tenor sound that is world renowned. He has the voice and the character and the high notes that is a must for this role. I know of no other tenor who can compare to him as Calaf. Surely not Corelli nor Bjoeling. Pavarotti's fame as the world's most famous tenor is justly deserved.<BR>Caballe can challenge Sutherland as the world's greatest soprano. But like Sutherland, and Sills, Caballe is a kind loveable diva whom everyone loves. And why not? With a voice like that she is justly famous as the most poignantlyly sung Liu who could have tried to upstage Sutherland if she wanted to. But she does not. And Sutherland and Caballe make beautiful music together. And so does Pavarotti.<BR>To those who are still not sure which Turandot to get. I suggest going to the library and borrow this one. If it does not win you over, I would be very surprise.
B00005JKN9|3.0|Gangs of New York will probably go down in history as being one of the greatest failed movies of all time. It had everything you could hope for in an epic; great performances, brilliant sets and costume, a one-of-a-kind style and... Well, maybe one thing was missing; a strong, cohesive script.<br />Here, you find young Amsterdam (Di Caprio)set upon avenging his father's death. The murderer in question, Bill \\"The Butcher\\" (Daniel Day Lewis in one of the greatest over-the-top performances ever put on celluloid), is one of the most notorious men of the era; no one would think twice about backstabbing Bill. But Amsterdam isn't just anyone. And to get to Bill, he will have to do the most dangerous thing of all; put his guard down and befriend the man to gain his trust.<br />With bloody battles that rival anything that has been filmed before, Gangs of New York could have been the first truly important film of the 21st Century. But it is so bogged down in details and unnecessary plot twists that it's easy to lose interest in these characters. <br />Scorsese is a master at crafting stories that hit you like a punch to the gut. This might be the first false move in his otherwize brilliant career. Not that Gangs of New York is a bad film. In fact, there is much to admire about this epic. But often, as the saying goes, bigger doesn't necessarily means better, a lesson Scorsese should have learned a long, long time ago.
B000002N3N|5.0|Who knows why I initially considered this to be a duff album by the woman with the most beautiful voice in the world.  Maybe I was expecting Shepherd's Moon Part II and saw Memory Of Trees as Shepherd's Eclipse.  The songs didn't leap out to me?  Well, listening to it for this review, it finally did, and I've embraced it like I have her other albums.  The four years inbetween albums was worth it.<br />Of the opening instrumental title tracks, &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is the most potent, sporting the usual instrumentals, pianos, haunting wall-of-sound choir-like vocals, pounding drums recalling &quot;The Longships&quot; from Watermark.<br />The brisk &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, whose dominant tempo reminds me of a horse having a gentle canter down a park, is backed by strings and backing vocals.  There's an interesting motif in the first line of her reaching a horizon but finding another, where something that looks like an end is actually a new beginning.  Bit like life, isn't it?<br />&quot;Pax Deorum&quot; is a Latin track begins with a cold dark wind, which sets the grim bass pulsing keyboard permeating throughout the song, as well as an ominous sound that sounds a bit like a foghorn, though not as loud or brash.  This part sounds a bit like an incantation.  Her voice alternates between a soft but lower register and her full vocals.<br />The piano (and later some other instrument) ballad &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot; is a sad but beautiful sung tune, full of yearning.  Makes me want to learn Gaelic.  My favourite song here, and Enya sounds her best singing like this.<br />The wistful, reflective piano only instrumental &quot;From Where I Am&quot; is a variation of &quot;Miss Clare Remembers&quot; from Watermark, with some shades of &quot;Epona&quot; from the Enya album.<br />&quot;China Roses&quot; is one of her visual and visionary poetic songs and it's an enchanting delight to hear.  I see melodic strains of what would later become &quot;Only Time.&quot;  That wall of sound really enhances her vocals, and the following lyrics really create the image of a dreamland:  &quot;A new moon leads me to/woods of dreams and I follow/a new world waits for me/my dream, my way&quot; and &quot;Rain and river, a world of wonder/may be paradise to me&quot;.  Gosh, how I love this woman!<br />OK, all you romantics.  &quot;Hope Has A Place&quot; is the song for you.  Enya's vocal echoes hauntingly here and that dreamy wall of sound is in full bloom.  And how's this for some sagely advice:  &quot;Look to love/you may dream/and if it should leave/then give it wings/But if such a love is meant to be/Hope is home, and the heart is free.&quot;  I can't decide whether I like this better than &quot;Athair Ar Neamh.&quot;<br />The third instrumental, &quot;Tea-House Moon&quot;, has some Oriental strains, with some otherworldly synths and conjures the image of one looking up at the stars.  As for the title, a nod to Teahouse Of The August Moon, set in post-WW2 Japan and starring Machiko Kyo?<br />&quot;Once You Had Gold&quot; is a proverbial seasons come, seasons go type, and has a mystical sense of why things go wrong:  &quot;No-one can promise a dream for you/Time gave both darkness and dreams to you.&quot; and &quot;What is the dark, shadows around you/why not take heart in the new day?&quot;<br />&quot;La Sonadora&quot; is her first Spanish song and it's more an interlude.  The backing wall of music rise to a crescendo in the song's midsection.<br />A reminiscing night traveller's thoughts comprise &quot;On My Way Home&quot;, where &quot;I remember all the best days/I'm on my way home/I can remember every new day&quot; is surrounded by the dreamy wall of sound.<br />Compared to her first three albums, Enya's voice is more mesmerizingly beautiful than I've ever heard.  She seems to be a one-woman band here, as it's &quot;all instruments and vocals by Enya&quot; per the credits.  There's more a wall of dreamy sound here--check out how many timesI've mentioned this.  Repeated listenings will tell whether it'll dislodge Shepherd's Moon as my favourite Enya album.s I've mentioned this.  Repeated listenings will tell whether it'll dislodge Shepherd's Moon as my favourite Enya album.
B00009ATIX|5.0|Solaris is NOT your typical science-fiction film. This isn't Star Wars. This is a literary science-fiction movie that only Steven Soderbergh could have created. <br />Clooney plays a man who enters a ship that had gone astray for quite some time. The first thing he sees upon entering the ship is a puddle of blood, an omen of things to come. He will soon realize that there is something very, very wrong about this ship and its crew.<br />It seems that the ship has the ability of making you experience some memories of the past you hold dear. In Clooney's case, he becomes haunted by his deceased wife. When she comes back to the ship, without knowing what has happened to her, Clooney's love for the woman resurfaces. Soon, he is trapped in a psychological game of poker, where every single one of this opponents are invisible entities that might or might not want to harm him. What do these ghosts want? What does the ship want?<br />Don't expect frights. Don't expect intergallactical battles. What you should expect is a taut, psychological experience that will leave you completely breathless. This is the kind of film created to make you think. It is the kind of film that haunts you long after you've finished watching it. <br />I loved every single minute of Solaris. Not only is the direction strong, but Clooney gives a performance that should have been remembered came Oscar time. So open your mind and allow yourself to experience something completely new, completely different and completely breathtaking.
B000050XEI|5.0|OK, so it took another five years after the soundscape of The Memory Of Trees to do another followup.  From the album cover, can we say Enya's entering her Green Period?<br />The instrumental piano and dreamy soundscape synth title track is on the lines of &quot;The Memory Of Trees.&quot;  I always look forward to those, like an introduction, an opening chapter, or even prologue to one of her albums.<br />The rhythmic canter of &quot;Wild Child&quot; encourages those to give in to nature and enjoy it, let the rains fall down, and to &quot;take the time from the helter skelter&quot; of everyday drudgery, because  &quot;Every day you find, everything's in kilter/you don't need a reason, let the day go on and on.&quot;  What a day, what a day to take to...<br />The enchanting mystical &quot;Only Time&quot; with its pizzicato-like rhythm, asks a lot of questions, running awash with her usual soundscape.  &quot;Who can say why your heart sighs as your love flies&quot;, &quot;Who can say why your heart cries as your love lies&quot;.  Answer:  only time.  Enya must really be a romantic, as she always looks to the future and is mystical about things.<br />The Latin incantation &quot;Tempus Vernum&quot; or &quot;Spring Time&quot;, is a grim number like &quot;Pax Deorum&quot; from Memory Of Trees.  There's a lot of opposites and concepts that come out.  &quot;occidens et orientis&quot; being &quot;west and east&quot;, &quot;autumnus et tempus vernum&quot; being &quot;autumn and spring time&quot;  It's like a storm, and it segues into &quot;Deora Ar Mo Chroi&quot;, or &quot;Tears On My Heart&quot;, which sounds like the quiet after the storm.  She also sings the Gaelic adaptation, which has different meaning from the English lyrics.<br />Strong strings underline &quot;Flora's Secret&quot; which is a close cousin to &quot;Caribbean Blue&quot; from Shepherd's Moon and celebrates the blessings and gifts and the enchanting aura that the trees and flowers have.<br />With Enya's echoing vocals on &quot;Fallen Embers&quot;, she has topped herself in vocal splendour and perfection.  This details a past love that's now gone:  &quot;Once, all dreams were worth keeping/I was with you.&quot;  So sad, but a standout on this album.<br />The instrumental &quot;Silver Inches&quot; has the same strong strings as &quot;Flora's Secret&quot;.  The sage advice song here is &quot;Pilgrim&quot;.  Whatever road we choose, we have to decide &quot;which of these is true/the road that leads to nowhere, [or] the road that leads to you.&quot;  The refrain foretells a long journey:  &quot;Pilgrim, it's a long way to find out who you are.&quot;  It's so strange that only the most introspective of us really stop to ask ourselves, &quot;Will you find the answer in all you say or do?/Will you find the answer in you?&quot;  I really hope so--that's what I'm counting on, an answer that is.  Another standout track.<br />&quot;One By One&quot; uses the analogy of trees' leaves falling one by one as a comparison of why many couples say goodbye.  &quot;One by one my leaves fall/One by one my tales are told&quot;, and when that happens, when our souls are too bare, the other may learn more than we want to about us and &quot;say Adios, says Adios, Goodbye.&quot;  Another strong strings sound.<br />&quot;Lazy Days&quot; is a dreamer's delight:  &quot;lazy old day/rolling away/dreaming the day away/don't want to go/now that I'm in flow/crazy amazing day.&quot;  That's what I really like about Enya, that dreaming romantic nature of hers.  Is there anywhere I can order those days in bulk, because I'll corner the market?<br />If it takes five years to make yet another winning spellbinding album, let her take five years.  I can wait.

B00005JLT5|5.0|Forget the Oscars. Forget the Golden Globes. The Pianist WAS the best film of 2002, no doubt about it. A great movie is supposed to make you feel all sorts of emotions, make you experience things you'd never thought you'd experience. The Pianist does that an more.<br />The fact that the movie is a hard one to watch probably didn't play well with award voters last year. There isn't much happiness in this tale of WW2 war prisoners and concentration camps. But Brody embodies his character so well - a young Polish pianist who has nothing to live for now that that war has started and who's only way to stay sane is by playing piano in his mind - that he more than deserved the acolades he received for this role.<br />With this film, you almost feel as though you are living one of the darkest pages of history. Director Roman Polanski brings you back to a time of death and sadness and makes you feel all of these emotions as if you were there in person. There are not many films that can make you feel such a strong slew of emotions. <br />The Pianist is a film that will go down in history. It will still be remembered - and celebrated - fifty years from now. It is truly one of the best, and most affecting, films about the holocaust.
B00005JLXE|3.0|Daredevil is the kind of superhero movie that Batman was.  It's dark and engaging because of it.  It draws the viewer in to the action by making it realistic in its own surreal-ality.<br />Since every other reviewer will give you a synopsis of the film, I won't belabor that issue.  Rather, I'll address the film and its actors directly.<br />Ben Affleck is a good choice for the role of Daredevil/Matt Murdock, although I sure do wish that for this movie (and for him in everyday life) he'd had a better toupee, because it looked like a bad rug from the beginning and never changed its \\"fake\\" look.<br />Also, Jennifer Garner was a great choice for Elektra.  She's lithe and muscular all at once.<br />Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan are also excellent choices for their roles.<br />A few of my gripes are the fact that the fight sequences seem to be badly shot.  I'm not familiar with this director.  As I understand it, the second director is the one who actually directs the action and filming of fight sequences.  Well the producers need to get the guy who was in charge of the fight sequences for Blade, because those scenes were well shot and directed - in Daredevil, it's as if we're not privy to the full action, by virtue of the way the sequences are shot.<br />The story moves along quickly enough, but in earnest the finale of the film is something of a let down.  I'll admit that I'm a bit jaded by most film's use of action to the very last minute, but here it could sure use a dose of that.<br />All that said, Daredevil is a winner of an action film and a great winner in the superhero categorty.  Marvel may have been late getting to the game with its roster of superheros to film, but once they did, they've done a really great job on the whole.<br />You'll definitely want to check this one out.
B000069HKH|5.0|I have been listening to Bruce as long as I can remember.  With all of the incredible albums he has put out over the years, he still managed to outdo himself.  This is by far the best written album I have ever heard.  The lyrics to all of the songs are so incredibly powerful.  Whether you have been a fan of his or not, you need to hear these songs.  Evereyone can relate to at least a few of the songs.  A must buy for any music fan, regardless if you are a Bruce fan.
0790731002|5.0|Batman is by far my favorite comic superhero. Sure Val Kilmer isn't Micheal Keaton, but he portrayed the dark knight just fine. Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carry played their villianous roles decently. Nicole Kidman, what can I say? She gave a stunning performance. Chris did what he could with Robin, but no matter who they get to play the role of Robin he'll still be annoying. His costume in the film was fantastic. The plot was changed from the original Batman formula plus the atmosphere of the story wasn't as dark, but Joel managed to make it work. This just goes to show that Joel can make a Batman movie work. Unlike his other adaption of Batman (Batman and Robin) where pretty much everything about Batman went to hell. The title says it all. Batman's legacy will live forever. It may change, but it will always be remembered. Batman Forever is a must see and must own for all Batman fans.
B00008R9KF|5.0|Originally intended only as a television feature film, MBL is one of the quietest but stirring movies you will see.<br />The story is about one Pakistani man (Warnecke) and a long time Englishman friend (Day-Lewis) who both live on the wrong side of the tracks as they grope for success in a world replete with multiple forms of discrimination -- racism, sexism, groupism, homophobia, cultural elitism, snobbery, reverse colonialism, neocolonialism and fascism -- which they successfully grapple and topple in the form of their launderette with the power of economic enterprise.<br />These squabbling goblins are left to each others excesses as economic success lifts them up and out of these, but many questions remain: will they subsist? Would others succeed; What does luck have to do with it?<br />Kureshi had [upset] all groups who find themselves part of this smashing satire, prime among them the identity conscious confused second/third generation subcontinental British kids, the same contingency that staunchly supported the Rushdie fatwa (the kind also sharply profiled in \\"My son, the fanatic\\").<br />Brilliant.
B000099T2L|4.0|Bootylicious!!! That goes without saying about Beyonce. The question is just what she'd be musically, when the CD is playin, the television is off and images of \\"The Booty Dance\\" aren't in your head. Well I have to say she met my expectations. I think she reached her potential on this CD. It's solid. As with anything it has hits and misses but there are more hits than misses. The CD starts with the Rich Harrison produced cut \\"Crazy in Love\\", a crazy infectious cut. Beside the Loreal/Max Factor produced hype around this song it's actually pretty cutting edge, with the horns and \\"Go-Go\\" feel. I also like how this song takes it's time to get rolling vocally. The next cut \\"Naughty Girl\\" missed me completely. I just wasn't feelin it, with it's Donna Summer hook. \\"Baby Boy\\", her cut with Sean Paul, while exhibiting all the flava of the islands, is a little played. I like the beat but I'm Sean Paul'ed out right about now. Track 4 \\"Hip Hop Star\\" has to be the biggest disappointment on the CD for me. It's a typical Outcast cut, Big Boi is cool, but the chemistry with Beyonce vocals just don't work. Looks like they were just straining to do something different on this one. At this point, after 4 tracks, I can't even lie I was definitely disappointed. But then the CD calmed down and came with it. Track 5 \\"Be With You\\" is a take on the Parliament classic. Very nice. Very sultry. Very 70's. Me, Myself And I is maybe my favorite track on the CD. Nice song about self reliance in a bad relationship. Even better is the track, a real cool, laid back R&B track. Nothing POP about this cut. She does a real nice lyrical trick at the end of the song also. \\"Yes\\" is another good track. Clever lil song abt an impatient lover. I like how they use the \\"needle on the vinyl\\" sound effect. \\"Signs\\" would have been a real nice cut if it was released a year ago. Right now it's upstaged by Tyrese's \\"Signs of Love Making\\". Essentially it's the same song and Tyrese's interpretation is better. Missy does offer a different perspective though. \\"Speechless\\" is a very nice change of pace for Beyonce. Very intense, very mature, very coming of age. You can feel the sexuality all over this cut. Very nice! Track 10 is a bubble gum cut featuring Jigga called \\"That's How You Like It\\". I actually like Jigga going back to the Twista style flow on this cut. This song is too damn corny though. Track 11 is the eagerly anticipated duet with Luther \\"The Closer I get to You\\". Luther sounds great, Beyonce holds her own. They did a good job with this remake. \\"Dangerously in Love\\" actually arose from a previous Destiny's Child CD. She changed it up a lil bit though. I like the salsa undertones of the cut. She even surprised me on track 14 \\"Gift From Virgo\\", a song patterned after the classic jazz singers. I'm impressed! I think Beyonce got what she wanted out of herself with this project.
B000096IBI|5.0|It helps that Modern Times is one of Chaplin's best films, period, running a close second behind City Lights (I hope that's next on the re-release list).  And happily, unlike The Gold Rush, which was ruined by awful sound choices, the Modern Times DVD offers a clean transfer of the film with all the beloved original elements intact as far as I could see and hear, plus a host of extras.<br />The film itself is the most briskly paced of Chaplin's feature-length films.  And his writing is sharp, unhindered by the sermonizing which permeates his last works.  The dilemma facing our Little Tramp this time is something all of us can relate to:  For the first time, we see him thinking ahead, wanting to have a future, to form a family, and working towards that end.  Chaplin's physical-comedy skills are at their peak:  Witness the extended takes of the rollerskate scene, and the factory assembly line.  Even if the 18fps (sometimes 16fps) film speed made everything look faster than it really was, it's still impressive physical co-ordination requiring flawless execution, since Chaplin rarely edits using coverage.<br />In Modern Times we see one of the first truly well-rounded Chaplin heroines.  The radiant Paulette Goddard was Chaplin's best leading lady, her high spirits and lively presence being a much better foil for Chaplin than the starry-eyed icons of perfection that were Georgia Hale, Edna Purviance, or Virginia Cherrill.  She just has more star quality and brings a quirkier, more animated personality to Chaplin's films, balancing them nicely.<br />And the gags -- some of the best in the Chaplin canon.  The eating machine always has me rolling on the floor; the nonsense song is terrific (the DVD offers a &quot;karaoke&quot; version which, though a novelty, does tell us finally what the lyrics actually are); and all the machine gags are fast-moving gems.<br />The bonus materials include a long outtake and several documentaries.  &quot;Chaplin Today&quot; features guests Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, the French filmmakers behind the film Rosetta, and though their film-historian banter is not entirely to my taste, they do bring up some insights that I hadn't observed about Modern Times.<br />In all, a great release, and a great DVD to have for movie nights.  It's a wonderful presentation of a comedy classic.
B00006F2TV|5.0|Honestly, don't listen to anyone that says a thing remotely negative towards this movie. It is the best movie ever!! And don't worry that you don't know anything about Spider-Man, you don't need to. It has great acting, awesome FX, wicked action and even a bit of romance, but not enough to ruin the film, *cough* Pearl Harbour *cough*<br />I would recommend it to ANYONE. Any age, intersets, or religions, you won't be disappointed. :)
B00005OWIU|5.0|This soundtrack is really good. I liked all of the songs, especially 'Harry's Wondrous World', which was like a medley of some selected songs, and 'Diagon Alley', which had this dance feeling. The other songs are also really good too, and I'm listening it almost every night before I sleep!
B00005JL96|5.0|i loved lilo and stitch didnt think i would when i show prviews oon tv but after i saw it i cnat get enought of it ive already orded stitches new move and cant wait to see it ive seen the movie about 10 times and will watch it again  it has great message i would recamend it i hope that they keep making new movies because i will buy each and every last one
B00006IR5S|5.0|It's a very good thing John Williams kept melodies in the first movie and improved it. &quot;Fawkes The Phoenix&quot;, &quot;The Chamber of Secrets&quot; and &quot;Gilderoy Lockhart&quot; was especially good. They really got the gist of the feeling. &quot;The Flying Car&quot; was also catchy. This is even better than the last HP soundtrack!
0316666343|3.0|I was profoundly depressed and disturbed by this book from beginning to end.  It definitely is not a &quot;feel good&quot; nor gift type book. The author's concept of Heaven I also found a little strange; however, I gave it 3 stars for originality and uniqueness, but it is not a book I recommend to my reading friends.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is a terrific CD. The songs have great hooks and melodies you'll be singing long after you've put the disk back in its jewel case. Some people think because they're musicians their opinions matter more than others. Well, I'm a jazz guitarist and have been studying music for over twenty years. I'm well-versed in the likes of Charlie Parker and Miles Davis to Led Zeppelin and more. Is Avril the model of authenticity? Nah. But is her CD fun to listen to? You betcha.
B00005B4GU|5.0|The follow up to Radiohead's critically acclaimed Kid A delivers even more spacy electronics and sprawling instrumenation to render an equitable second moiety of a stunning duo of albums. Although Amnesiac appears to be completely bereft of optimism, it certainly doesn't lack any grounds in feeling, energy, creativity and intelect. The chosen single from Amnesiac, Knives Out, is a good track, but a surprising choice coming from an album loaded with other more deep, layered compositions that furnish greater amounts of elegance and color. But it's really not that much of a problem. I'm sure anyone who has heard this album could just pick a song at random and it would turn out to be a commercial success. But commercial success isn't all this album has garnered. I think Amnesiac is really a hallmark album for Radiohead's discography and a reestablishment of their reign as monarch over basically any other band attempting to make similiar music to their sui generis, archetypal style
0609610570|1.0|This book fails to even come close to broaching a new topic.  Further, its hawking of Six Sigma has the feel that it was &quot;copy and pasted&quot; right from another source.  Bossidy's incessant need to pat himself on the back for his work at AlliedSignal becomes irritating before the close of the first chapter.<br />The writing itself is terrible by both authors, especially Bossidy; unfortunately, his contributions comprise the bulk of text.  Charan's portions of the text, while more readable and useful than Bossidy's, are quite poor given his more academic-oriented career.<br />Avoid this book like the plague.  It is NOT worth your time.  Essentially no information can be gleaned from this work that hasn't been already been discussed to death.
B00005JLXE|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever! I think Collin Farrel (Bullseye) and Michael Duncan Clarke (Kingpin) were the best in the movie. There was a lot of cool action in it, especially when Daredevil(Ben Affleck) fights Elektra (Jennifer Garner) at the park. The best part is from when Daredevil fights Bullseye in the church. The rest of the movie is good as well.
B00008K7AM|5.0|Rachel McAdams plays popular-and-blonde teen cheerleader, Jessica Spencer complete with coterie of friends and devout boyfriend Billy. When Jessica steals an earing from an import store, little does she realize that she has just unleashed a centuries old magic spell, which plummets Jessica into the body of an ex-con and the con into her body. Thus begins another identity crisis drama  where Rob Schneider, (if this guy is 3O, I'll eat my hat), has to act an the part of a teenage girl.<br />Okay, sometimes I love a dumb comedy and this movie fits the bill. Rob is excellent as the confused, and snotty Jessica. Rachel did a good job playing the &quot;Hot Chick Bandit.&quot;  The young man who played Billy was perfect. The cameos of Adam Sandler as the pot-loving Rastafarian was just too funny.  Oh, and I particularly like the opening scene where the earring (and its spell) are first used in ancient Sumaria (?).<br />While this movie is far from PC, it makes up for it in its sheer charm. I found Hot Chick to be a light, entertaining gag movie. Well worth the rental.
B00009NHC5|5.0|What would it be like to be blind and to be trapped knowing that many bad men are coming to kill you?  Well, steel your nerves and find out with Audrey Hepburn.<br />This is one of my all-time favorite films -- it shocked and thrilled me when I first saw it many years ago, and even though some of the atmosphere has magically turned to camp these days, it still is a solid vehicle.  The performances are unforgettable, especially Hepburn's portrayal of a not-so-helpless blind woman with nerves of steel.  Guaranteed you'll never look at Alan Arkin the same way again.<br />This film contains some of the most chilling lines and epiphany moments I've ever witnessed.  The plot unfolds at such a meticulous pace that the psychological tension has no where to go but up.  \\"Keep tapping!\\"<br />Here's a hint to make it even better:  WATCH IT IN THE DARK!!!  Orginally the theaters where it was shown blacked out even the exit signs so that the climactic scene would plunge everyone into the same darkness.<br />Sure, some of it is campy fun now, but prepare yourself to be startled and to feel as trapped as Audrey Hepburn.  Go on, scream for help -- will anyone hear you?
B00009TB5G|4.0|This was a good movie considering the fact that there were only 3 hours to work with.  With the depth and complexity of the encompasing mythology of Middle Earth and the Lord of the Rings story itself, it would be impossible to fit every detail into the film.  I have issues with some of the omissions as well as what I consider bad writing (more in The Two Towers than in The Fellowship of the Ring) such as the Ents.  Otherwise It was pretty good, and at times truely excelent (such as Gandalf's battle with the Balrog).<br />For the Tolkien purists such as myself all we can do is wait for someone to break the story up into the six parts that are present in the books, which should hopefully allow for the story to be told in all of its intended splendor.  That being said, I am glad that this movie exists and hopefully it has inspired people who have not read the books to pick them up to see what the movie is based on (and why there are people such as myself who have valid issues with some of the liberties taken in making the films).
B00005JM09|4.0|I would rate my movie-going experience with T3 at about 3.5 stars so I gave 4 to be close. I was hoping to see the battle of the machines vs. the humans in 2029, with the matured John Connor organizing resistance, fighting the machines and sabotaging their plans by sending back a T-800. This was not the case. However, the potential is still (and most likely) there when T4 is produced.    There are some good action scenes, a few new twists, and a bit of the tongue-in-cheek humor of T2. I believe they attempted to recreate the romantic tension between Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor from T1 with John Connor and another young lady (Claire Danes) but the chemistry just wasn't there. I think I would have been more comfortable with Edward Furlong brought back as John Connor and the age would be about right. They could have even brought in Nikki Cox to play the (human) female, since she was so young in T2 (they could have used this in the plot since Nikki's character in T2 knew John Connor and sent the T-1000 to the Galleria - this would have required only a minor rewrite in T3). Nikki Cox's character in T2 was only about 3 years younger than John Connor. Oh well, they didn't consult with me first! LOL    The female Terminator, was quite attractive and coldly played. However, she quickly pulls a couple of very public stunts that would draw attention to herself immediately upon arrival. In T1 and T2, the assassination robots (awkwardly at some times, smoothly at others) attempted to \\"blend-in\\" to reach their targets by stealth. Of course, some will argue that the T-800 acquiring a motorcycle in T2 wasn't all that subtle either (I agree! but at least it was amusing).  Of course she needs a particular tool to accomplish her immediate tasks and these stunts facilitate the acquisition.    T1 and T2 are hard acts to follow. I enjoyed this film but wanted more. And I have no doubt more is coming (without spoiling it for you) based upon the plot twists. There are some unexpected surprises and attempts to introduce some of the future machine's mechanical ancestors. There was, however, a bit of an unwanted \\"Robocop\\" feel in some parts, but perhaps, again, they were trying to show some early versions of the machines we saw in T1.    T1 and T2 purists (like myself, for the most part) will likely be disappointed in the film. If T4 returns to proper form, I think many will find there can be a place for this film in a boxed set. But T4 is going to build on this film, there can be no doubt. I think many of us feel the execution could have been better. I won't mention the myriad reasons which have already been stated.    I'll end with this. T1 and T2 purists: I suggest you wait until you get it on DVD. Those who enjoy action films without being as picky as some of us (hehe) will have a good time at the film.  I've seen the movie 3 times now and I'm liking it better with the repeated viewings.    T3 Error: John Connor and Kate must pilot a private plane to another location. The plane, a Cessna 172-type aircraft, is N3035C at the hangar. On the flight, a different or renumbered plane is used which was N3973F.  Sure enough, when the plane lands, it is the N3035C plane arriving.  Oops!!!  Hint to director:  Make sure the props for the 2nd unit match those used with the principal actors.
B00005JLZN|4.0|Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet star in &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot; as a death row inmate and a news reporter.  They carry their emotions gracefully giving this movie the emotion it needs.  The writers found a unique style to darken death row more than the average movie.  The debates about politics are eye opening to many.  The editors add handwritten words and images to desplict the intensity of the next scene.  The many surprises will keep the audience watching every scene closely wondering what will happen next.  Those who look away for a second will not understand the rest of the movie unless they rewind it.  The end has the biggest surprise(shhhhh).  Afterward, one will not be disappointed, rather enlightened.
B000088E6M|5.0|I was one of the luck one's to get this limited edition right here. It is off the hook! this is a keeper! I loved it! I said it before, anything with 50 is on point!
B00005JLXE|3.0|I love this movie because it has great actors and great action. Yet, as much as i like this movie, it does have some flaws which should be pointed out. First, the action sequences are great but can get extremely confusing due to the lack of lighting or confusing camera angles. Second, some of the dialogue and backgound information on the characters is a little rediculous. For example, why Daredevil becomes fearless all of a sudden just because he cant see. Other than that the movie is a great superhero follow up to the amazing Spider-man flick. I recommend it.
B000002V0Q|5.0|This is awesome. This is probaly their best. I almost puked after i heard they had broke up after 20 years:( it's [terrible]. oh well this cd rules. the best songs are Syphony Of Destruction and Captive Honour. LONG LIVE MEGADETH!!!
B00005JKN9|4.0|This movie has gotten outstanding reviews so i got excited when i finally sat down and began watching it. At the end of the movie there was no doubt that this movie is one of the best films of the year. It has drama, action, and an excellent script that has no flaws in my opinion. The only negative part about this movie is Cameron Diaz who seems out of place at some points and her purposed is continually critized until the viewer is finally informed about her involvement in this movie; but even then her importance is still questioned. Aside from that, this movie is a fantastic movie and should not be missed!

0790743523|3.0|This is a good movie for John Huston,Boggie,and Bogie gave second best performance next to &quot;Maltese Falcon&quot;. &quot;Maltese Falcon&quot; is another collabaration of Boggie and J.Huston which was a very influencial movie,and it had a similar theme(GREED).<BR> Even thongh  Treasure of Sierra Madre described greed of a human being and Boggie gave one of his best performance it is not a great movie(only good).The reason is director J.Huston whitewashed the politics of the original story. When Maltese Falcon was released the description of human greed was okay without politics,real situation. Several years after Maltese Falcon was released he made Treasure of... with the same theme without politics. Greed is not good,but he had to describe the GREED in details including many elements. He described greed too simply,neutrally.
B00005JKBC|3.0|I wasn't satisfied with Spy Game, but it is one of the realistic spy movies out there in years. It is an average movie that can be forgotten fastly and not one of the memorable movies out there. I say, give it a try and never judge a book by it's cover! It's a So So movie and needs thinking while the story goes on. I liked the movie but not much, and the movie is longer than what it should be, the plot is streched more than average. The Video is great, the sound is SPECTACULAR with the DTS sound, but there is a little problem with the subtitle switching it on, it won't switch on at all, I don't know why but other people I know or other reviews that I have read, it was the opposite where the subtitle won't switch off instead of my problem which is ON!!! <BR>UNIVERSAL &gt;&gt; Fix the Problem please...Thanks

I have been lucky to get their early recordings. and her voice is so versatile. I can't wait to see what Amy and Ben bring out into the future. If you like &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;? You'll like the whole album.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|I have had this film on the notification list longer than any film (over 3 years) but it shows that there is a God in heaven and all my Amazon compadres are rejoycing as much as I.  This is the greatest western if not the greatest movie ever made, especially the greatest film to not even been nominated for an Oscar....I have seen a Regions 2 release that belong my son's Air Force buddy while they were station in an undisclosed location just east of here, if you know what I mean and the print was excellent, it was in English but Italian subtitled.  But November 18 will be Christmas in this household. This is the only film that I ever seen that I cannot find a flaw with and praise it more with each viewing. The first time I saw it I was 18 years old during my senior year in 1979, thought it was a routine but very good western until 18 minutes into the film when Sergio Leones camera swooped outside from the McBain house and halted on a tight shot on the youngest child and then Ennio Morricone's music kicked in with that electic guitar and orchestrial instrumentation and wordless choir and I knew then that there would never be a better film. Good and Evil, Sex and Violence, Love and Hate, God and Love is all in the contents of this masterpiece. My only complaint and this will be a selfish one is that I have seen the film and researched it so much that I would love to do the commentary on the commentary track....this will make the ultimate present for any loved one. I hope that his followup ONCE UPON A TIME...THE REVOLUTION AKA A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE will be released shortly as well....GOD BLESS US EVERYONE
0871882000|5.0|Bradley's edition to the Arthurian Legend stands among the best. Its offering of the tale from perspective of women is an interesting and critical one, if often overlooked. Certainly women were present in the day of Arthur and, as is the case in much of history, women were one of the main motivations and justifications for action of any sort.  The in depth look at the characters and their relationships with each other is fascinating and worthwhile.  However the element in this book that is most intriguing is, perhaps, the attempt Bradley has made to strip away the mythology in order to reveal the history. As we well know, mythology--no matter how removed from reality--can be traced back to some very real event or person.  Bradley, like a seasoned historical detective, finds many likely origins for things that have become towering myths. (For instance, young Arthur drawing the sword OUT OF THE STONE finds a much more humble--and likely--explanation...He draws his sword from a place WHERE IT LIES ON a ceremonial stone the night before his coronation...You can see how the story could be spun and spun again to become what we are most familiar with today...\\"He drew the sword out of the stone, establishing him as the king...\\")These de-mythologized moments in the book (and there are many) make the reality of King Arthur and his court all the more intriguing...Bradley has done a magnificent piece of work here, that transports the reader to a real time and place, outside of legend--truly parting the mists.
B00005MP58|3.0|I have to agree with the previous reviewer about the quality of the special edition DVD of Pride and Prejudice. The colors were &quot;off &quot; and washed out and the whole movie seemed to have  blurry outlines. I too, had to increase the brightness and should have lowered the contrast but was unwilling due to an already blurry picture. I was very dissapointed =( I watch the VHS version all the time when im cleaning downstairs and bought this edition to use on the computer upstairs in the same manner. Very dissapointed. I give the movie 5 stars. I give the DVD edition 3 =(
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown is a gripping mystery novel. The story moves on four fronts: the hero and heroine, the head of a Roman Catholic organization, the chief inspector of the French police and a fanatical murderer. Like checkers on a checkerboard the chapters move these pieces of the story in turn until they all reach home row at the end. The author is able to maintain suspense throughout the story so that it has momentum to the very last page, not letting the mystery completely dissolve until the end. It is not the nature of this book to probe deeply into the human character, the nature of reality or to generate beautiful prose. It reads like a movie script, al la Raiders of the Lost Ark.<br />The author uses two characters as experts on everything, especially Christianity and some of its historical struggles. Because the book is fiction it is able to build its own picture of Christianity and the church without regard to historical accuracy. It does convey a patronizing attitude toward the church and its faith, an attitude common place now and throughout the history of the church.<br />Theirs is an old scenario: Jesus was a great man whose movement got hijacked by powerful people in Roman society and transformed into a secular power. Their version adds the proposition that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and the two produced children. This story line sets up a classic mystery novel struggle between an evil titan and a heroic minority replete with centuries of intrigue and violence, i.e. Luke Skywalker and the Federation. This is all great fun in a novel, but should not be confused with the truth.<br />Proposing that Jesus was married and had children is just another way of saying he wasn't the one proclaimed by the Christian faith, that he was a man in the flow of history not an intersect between God and history. Tying this idea in with the worship of a female goddess adds mystery and tension to the story and taps into the energy of the modern struggle between the sexes and society's effort to harness the sex drive.<br />Genuine historians that are anti-Christian don't claim that Rome hijacked the Christian movement, but rather that the Christian movement hijacked Rome. So even though the church was changed by its being adopted as the state religion, and even though its secular power led to terrible corruption, it's first three hundred years laid down the fundamental message. Constantine did not. What he did do was demand that the church settle its message so he could have a coherent religion to authorize.<br />The story line of this book elevates the divine female as if this were a breath of fresh air in an oppressive male-dominant Christian society. The divine female is nothing more than the ancient worship of sex. It is as commonplace as Hustler magazine. The worship of Venus three thousand years ago is the same impulse that drives the advertising and entertainment industry today. Just as commerce is dependent on sex today, production was linked to procreation then. If you could get the male and female gods to mate (so they reasoned), you could produce human, animal and vegetable crops on the earthly plane, i.e. wealth.<br />Christianity was born into a male-dominated culture. It didn't create it. The church has deviated from its earliest affirmation of the equality of male and female (\\"in Christ there is neither male nor female\\" -- the apostle Paul, 60 AD.)  God's voice in the Bible never admits to being male or female. When Moses asks for God's identity, he gets \\"I am who I am.\\"<br />The book's experts are fiction and so is their expertise. Solomon's temple, for instance, was destroyed long before Mary Magdalene came along. We know little about it and certainly don't know what its columns looked like. It was the second temple, the one build by Herod the Great that she would have seen. The holy of holies was not under ground but rather stood at the center of temple mount. She couldn't have gotten in it much less under it, dead or alive. The Crusades were a silly business that brought back nothing of historical value except the knowledge of a Muslim culture more advanced than the European culture. The Crusaders were completely ignorant of the land they conquered. The local people neither new nor cared where the bones of Mary Magdalene might be. They did know they could sell the Crusaders anything with the right story. So the knights credulously or greedily brought back relics purported to be fragments of the cross, the hair of John the Baptist and so on. The grail may have had a forged artifact initially or may have just been a story brought back without the souvenir.<br />My expertise doesn't extend to all the areas the \\"experts\\" in the book claim, but if their errors in fact are consistent with the ones I can pick out without research, I presume that it is all fiction and should be taken as such.<br />It is a fun book that is irrelevant to the serious subjects of Christian faith, sexuality and hope for a better world.<br />Roland McGregor<br />7/2003h less under it, dead or alive.

B00006BTCA|5.0|Attending the vans wapred tour recently it began to dawn on me how popular music is makin a nose dive for the ...and every brainless minion of pop culture and MTV that are strapped on bored are totally oblivious to this fact and they really dont mind it the least. Recently ive been clinging to anything new i can find that shows promise and isnt corporatised all to hell, with bands such as the white stripes, the hives (yes i know, but i like them), the strokes (even though bands like rooney are beggining to copy them left and right). I had even gotten to the point where i was praising irish core, and pirate core as new and fresh and amazing (not that it isnt but theese bands ((dropkick murpheys and the mad caddies)) arent, but they are being different just for the sake of saying that they are different). Then, ironically enough, i heard a soundbyte of interpol on MTV and i though i might give it a listen after downloading (uh oh downloading copyrighted material! BAAAD) it and i loved it! I eventually downloaded two more songs before buying the album and it is no doubt the greatest album out now. Considering i am at the wee small age of 15 and spent the two years of the 80's that i was alive gumming on assorted objects, i wasnt (and still arent to an extent) aware of Interpol's 80's influences, but considering that fact it goes to show the impression a band such as this can leave on even a 15 year old's fried brain when it is in \\"Summer Mode\\". This is by far the greatest album that has come out in my lifetime since Nevermind by Nirvana, White Blood Cells by the White Stripes, and Achtung Baby by U2. I have a band myself that are trying to get on their feet and we have all found interpol as a source of inspiration of Beatles proportions. In a world where pop culture is makin a nose dive for the..., this is another glimmer of hope that maybee we can boot some people off of the pop culture plane (the avril lavignes, the christina agulera's the assorted annonmous 16 yearold girls who are holding a guitar in their videos and dont know what to do with it, and every band who is on the warped tour, except RANCID) to make room for bands like interpol and The White Stripes. (by the way we need to give the Hives their seat back on that plane!)
B00009M6VJ|1.0|I can't believe that there are so many good reviews of this movie on Amazon.  This movie absolutely stunk.  You knew exactly what was going on 20 minutes into it.  I kept watching, hoping that there would be some twist that would save it... but there wasn't. Believe me folks, this movie is pretty darn close to being as bad as The Postman or The Patriot.  I ordinarily don't write reviews, but the reviewers so far must be related to the filmmakers or paid to say nice things or something.  This movie is an insult to intelligent movie-goers.  Fair warning.
B000089RVX|5.0|The first time I heard &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; it literally sent chills down my spine. The haunting vocals, the music, and the lyrics were just amazing, and I knew I had to find out who this was. Once I found Evanescence, I knew I wanted to hear more. My hubby pre-ordered Fallen so it would arrive as soon as it was released! I love the whole CD, and listen to it many days, on my long commute to and from work, and also when in my home office, working on my computer. <br />The vocals are pure and energetic, with a ethereal quality. The lyrics are clear, and the music has a powerful feel, yet a clean sound. Amy's voice is one of the few female voices that can handle driving, heavy rock, while sounding like an angel. <br />I am already waiting for their next CD!
B00005JLZN|4.0|I did not know what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie, but I soon found out. This one made me think like no movie has done in a long time. I am pro-capital punishment, but after watching this...I realize that there are some flaws in the system that may never be fixed unless there are people out there to fight for them. The DVD contains good extra features such as the making of the movie where the directors take you to Huntsville, TX where the story takes place. All the places were real which makes the movie even more believeable. It was very well written and directed and the actors were perfect for their parts.
0553801511|5.0|I absolutely love the characters that Hobb came up, and thrilled that she continues to progress each and everyone of them.  That is one thing that makes her books stand out.  She comes up with a plot then builds and progresses complex characters through a wonderfully written story.<br />For example, Fitz, the &quot;main&quot; character throughout the farseer trilogy and then this one constantly makes mistakes, but learns from them in a real way.  He is bull-headed and very quick to make assumptions and decisions.  He never thinks about the reaction to his action.  But as the story continues through this Tawny Man series, Fitz groes and begins to see what the reaction is.  He begins to look through other characters eyes and see how his actions affect those closest to him.<br />Another example is Chade.  In the Farseer series he was a man that could do no wrong and always seemed to have the correct answer and best way to do things.  This isn't always so, as his character gets older, he does so in a realistic sort of way. <br />These are just a few reasons why I enjoyed this series and the last.  I like characters that grow. Not ones that consistently portray the same image.<br />If you've read the Farseer trilogy and aren't sure if you should read the Tawny Man, I will say this.  Read it you won't be disapointed.  If you haven't read the farseer trilogy just yet then turn yourself around man, your jumping the gun here.  Read that series first and maybe even the bingtown traders series.  They are both very good series to read, including this one.
B00005JJX8|4.0|John Robie (Cary Grant), a.k.a. The Cat,  is the main suspect in a number of big jewelry thefts along the French Riviera.  The jewel thief has used the same methods once used by the former cat burgular, Mr. Robie, and when the police arrive to Mr. Robie's residence he has to escape with the notion that the law will not believe a former thief.  John also realizes that he must find the real thief in order to prevent further thefts to be blamed on him, and with the help of a insurance agent from London he finds out where the thief might strike next.  The next target might be Jessie Stevens and her eye-catching daughter Frances (Grace Kelly) who he befriends.  To Catch a Thief is a stimulating film that won Oscars for best cinematography.  The end result is a thriller that delivers suspense and drama while offering a first-rate cinematic experience.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|When I sit down and argue with friends of mine about the greatest western ever made, it's often Leone's *Once Upon a Time in the West* that becomes the sticking point. There are American classicists who argue for *Red River* or *The Searchers*, and those are two great films. But what Leone does (with a great script) is distill not just the western, but, in fact, the whole experience of Americans into essentials. Does it take someone who's \\"outside\\" the system to catch that? Maybe... Nick Ray did the same with *Johnny Guitar*, a quirky film that shares some themes with OUaTitW.<br />Its operatic construction is so perfectly Italian (and musically classical) that there are distant echoes of parody. But then, when you begin to assimilate the cast, from the cameos in the surpassingly brilliant pre-credit sequence into the unparallelled \\"bar\\" scene, into the railroad-building sequence, into the tense and contempt-full scenes with Henry Fonda and the RR boss, you realize that you're in the presence of an almost perfect distillation of what the western is all about. Others have done grand things: Ford, Hawks, Cimino, Ray, Eastwood, Altman. But Sergio Leone gets everything in there. I first ran into this in high school, when my high school teacher William Blackwell showed us snippets of OUTW in a film class, and it has haunted all of us in that class ever since.<br />Of the filmic competitors, only Mel Brooks (yes, I know) can compete -- and it's in a different version. I love this film, even while snickering at its occasional campiness. And think about the year of its creation (1968; a year later in the U.S.) ... the greatest year in the history of the 20th century. I have hoarded my VHS version, in pan-and-scan, until today, and the announcement that the DVD is coming out is just great news. May it be a great and reputable presentation -- in letterbox as it must be, and with opulent extras! We fans await nothing less. And will accept nothing short of that!
6302814782|5.0|This is by far the best vampire movie I have ever seen. I looked at it for the first time when I was about 9 years old and I've watched this movie a million times since then. Great mix of action, adventure, romance, horror. This set the standard for all vampire movies behind them. None of them have been able to compare to this classic. Get this movie. ITS THE GREATEST VAMPIRE MOVIE EVER!
0385504209|4.0|J<br />Five stars to the author who develops such a magnificent imagination. He says that all references to the past are true. But, as they say in Italy: If it's not true, it surely is well invented.<br />Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu try to do what countless savants over the centuries tried in vain: Find the Holy Grail. The Vatican gets involved and, of course, Opus Dei. Jacques Sauniere, curator of the Louvre, is murdered early on. Apparently he was the grand marshal of the Priory of Sion, and they know where the Grail is. Robert and Sophie progress from anagram to double entendre riddles, on and on for over 400 pages.<br />The red herring going through it all is Mary Magdalene and the cult of the Sacred Feminine. But, after a while, you do get tired of fabulous and saintly Mary M. and all the feminism. And the ending of this very large book is rather silly.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Let's get one thing straight: for the most part, I HATE independent films. Really. When I hear those words, I always think of a five-hour, beatnik-friendly black-and-white film of two french people talking and smoking cigarettes, while their conversation is subtitled in English, and the end card reads &quot;Fin&quot;. Sometimes I think &quot;independent film&quot; refers to the movie being independent from having to make a lick of sense. Yes, this movie is in black-and-white, but in all honestly, that's the only thing it has in common with other &quot;independent films&quot;. This movie is real, funny, and raw, and it helped to boost the career of a young filmmaker in the rough, Mr. Kevin P. Smith of Red Bank, NJ.<br />The movie focuses on the comings and goings and comings of the Quick Stop Convienience Store, and its head clerk, Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran). It is Dante's day off, but unfortunately for him, he gets called in to work. (I know how that feels, and believe me, it bites.) Hence his catchphrase: &quot;I'm not even supposed to be here today!&quot; The next 90 minutes deal with Dante's love life (37?!), his sarcastic (and witty as hell) friend Randal Graves who works at the nearby video store (Jeff Anderson), and of course, the dumb customers he gets. I am a cashier at a grocery store as well, so I know exactly what it's like to have to deal with these people. I can't tell you how many times I've gotten people like that and I just wanted to use one of Randal's lines against them. Also, watch the scene at the video store, when a mother asks Randal for a kid's video for her daughter (who is with her). What ensues... classic. Oh yeah, and how can I forget, this is also the flick that introduced America to Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith). Snoochie Boochie Noochies!<br />All in all, if you're a cashier/clerk, or even if you're not, this is a great movie, and should be seen by everyone, along with the rest of the movies in the View Askew-niverse.
B0000069NM|4.0|Just got this based on a friend's recommendation - great listening and wonderful addition to my music collection.
B0000584V3|5.0|I have been a fan of Opeth for maybe a year or so. My first purchase was My arms your hearse and from that moment on I became a huge fan. The next purchase was of course Blackwater park. This album is truly a masterpiece from the clean vocals on songs like harvest to death metal style vocals on songs like the leper affinity Akerfeldt shows great range in his voice. The drums are also amazing, the change in time and style is awesome. The drummer doesnt always do speed blasts he changes it up. The mix of acoustic and electric guitars is really cool too. The bassist doesnt overpower everyone but he does have some intricate bass lines. This is my second favorite opeth album I'd have to say My arms your hearse is probably number one. If your into a band that plays complex music and music that changes from slow and melodic to fast and abrasive Opeth is definatley the choice for you.
B0000028RR|5.0|Ahh, good ol rage.  They take a lot of s#!t even after they broke up for extreme political views and ideals but i think it's about f***ing time somebody point out what's wrong with this system.  Songs on this cd promote individualism and standing up for what you believe. How this could possibly be a bad thing is beyond me.  Every track on this cd has strong riffs, and a unique vocal rap style that (amazingly) doesn't sound like krap.  Standout tracks are &quot;bombtrack&quot;, &quot;killing in the name&quot;, and &quot;wake up&quot; (which graced the soundtrack of the matrix as well).  If you are right wing or easily offended, then leave right now because you have nothing to do with rage.  If you don't have this cd already, buy it, because it is TOTALLY worth it.
B00009MEA5|5.0|This was a movie that I rented on a whim, it turned out to be much more than I bargained for, and I mean this in the best possible way. I loved this film because it not only got across a point which I personally believe in, but it was perfectly cast. Kevin Spacey, Laura Linney, and Kate Winslet were all perfect, as was the rest of the cast! They sucked me in, and for the entirety of the movie, I couldn't turn away. I was shocked at the ending, and I loved it as well. There is an extremely good love scene towards the end of the movie, that truly shows the meaning of loyalty, devotion, and love. It wasn't lustful, it was just beautiful. All in all this movie, although blatantly political, was a screenplay and cinematic masterpiece! Hope you rent it!
B000007T1M|5.0|I remember the Christmas of 1998, when I first got South Park's \\"Chef Aid\\" CD. I remember listening to a song called \\"Will They Die For You.\\" At the end, there was a singer, singing a line (I don't remember exactly what). But the voice...it stood out to me. I looked at the case and saw the words: \\"System Of A Down\\". That was the first time I had heard of SOAD. Little did I know that they would go on to become one of my all-time favorite bands...<br />This is obviously SOAD's first LP, and boy, what an album. It's heavy, loud, fast, angry, political, charged, melodic, silly, wacky, funny, angry, thoughtful, possibly unsafe. If you only know the band from \\"Toxicity\\" and \\"Steal This Album\\", this one might catch you off-guard. It's more raw and deranged than the other two. I mean, come on, who can resist \\"Suite-Pee\\", when Serj yells his famous line, \\"'Cause everyone, needs! A mother, [you-know-what]!!!\\" And yes, folks, \\"Sugar\\" is still an all-time favorite. Hell, this whole album is. And I should know, I've had it for well over two years now.<br />All in all, I can't recommend this one enough. Hell, they do the politics-in-music thing better than RATM did.
B00009KMEO|5.0|NO MATTER HOW EVERYONE IS HATING ON HER,SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST<BR>SUCESSFUL YOUNG ARTISTS IN THE INDUSTRY,AND NOT TO FORGET<BR>TALENTED AND CREATIVE. AS FAR AS THIS ALBUM IS CONCERNED,I<BR>DIDN'T EXPECT FOR IT TO BE AS GOOD AS IT IS. SHE CAME OUT WITH<BR>A STYLE DIFFERENT FROM DC'S SOUND WHICH MAKES IT TOTALLY OFF<BR>THE HIZZY! I LIKE THE WHOLE ALBUM WHICH I GIVE 5 STARS FOR,BUT<BR>BABY BOY,HIP HOP STAR AND CRAZY IN LOVE I GIVE 1 STAR...I'M NOT<BR>FEELING THOSE SONGS,OTHER THAN THAT THE ALBUM IS GREAT,MATURE,<BR>SEXY AND SULTRY.

B000002H2H|4.0|Show me someone who doesn't like &quot;ride the lightning&quot; and i'll show you someone who obviously hates all forms of good music.  this is another brilliant piece of work from metallica.  Very death oriented and dark, but the lyrics are deep and the music is very original and heavy.  There isn't a bad track on this cd, but &quot;ride the lightning&quot;, &quot;fade to black&quot;, and &quot;trapped under ice&quot; are the cream of the already abundant crop.  There are times when the songs seem to stretch a bit too long, which is what docked one star, but this is still an amazing piece of work.
