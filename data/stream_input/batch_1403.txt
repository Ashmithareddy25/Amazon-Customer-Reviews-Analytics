B000683VI4|5.0|this is one of my favorite romantic movies. it's very touching and heartfelt. it's very realistic, most of us can relate to losing someone you love and dream you'll find that person again someday.most of us can also relate to having your parents when you were younger,think you weren't in love with that person and not understand. of course the person in love is the only person who can decide that is the person in love. i love the ending of this movie. it's one of the best possible endings a movie could have. a must see for those who love romantic movies and happy endings.
1439102732|5.0|This was another heart-wrenching story from Jodi Picoult. I was completely drawn in by the characters in this novel. The subject matter is so explosive. When I started this one, I wasn't sure what to expect. I only knew that it involved music (which I love) and it was by Jodi Picoult (who I also love).<br /><br />What I didn't expect was the second half of the novel to become a battle between Evangelical Christians and the LGBT community. This book was very powerful. People cling to their beliefs so hard that sometimes it leads them to behave in ways that go against the very grain of what they preach. I think that Ms. Picoult handled this topic with the respect and delicacy that it deserved, while making very important points.<br /><br />My favorite quote: \\"Jesus says we're supposed to love everyone, no matter what.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps it doesn't mean as much to you out of context, but it was a turning point for a few of the characters and I loved it. No matter where you come down on the issues addressed in this novel, you will be left examining your motives and priorities.
B004WJV6OY|5.0|This was an excellent concert CD. This is the first time I heard of Eddy Vedder,when I heard the sound track of, into the wild I had to have it. Since I liked it so much, I thought I would try something else by him.I was not disappointed.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|I originally purchased 4 of these for my granddaughters...ages 6,5,3 and 2. I immediately saw that they would be hard for the younger two to use.The stickers are somewhat tricky to remove for tiny hands as they seem to catch at certain points...since they are reusable there is no backing to peel off but they have to be gently taken out of the sheet. Having said that, the 6 and 5 year old girls had a GREAT time with them. Kind of like the old Colorforms but more durable. Very good for the imagination. They were comparing the outfits they created and even drawing pictures of them. Lots of fun for a quiet afternoon...just keep the littler ones away. Melissa and Doug also make one of these with a house motif...sort of like a dollhouse. They loved that as well.
B004ZGI2KK|3.0|Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />This new take on the children's story wisely preserves the period (though not specified time) frame of the tale. The acting, from Ms. Seyfried down to Mr. Oldman, is very good. However, I think the story needed more development, not only to flesh out the relationship between Valerie and Lucie, Valerie's relationships with Peter, Henry & Claude, but also to further establish Roxanne's relationship with Claude (which I thought was given too little screen time). A minor annoyance: a song that sounds like rock plays during a scene. So basically, I think the movie needed more development, not only in the relationship aspect, but also showing how the people of Daggerhorn went about their daily lives and how the wolf came to be a terror to the village, and that it should have been longer, like 2/1/2 hours. There's also a nice homage to the original tale late in the film. The sensual scenes were really not neccessary, and it could have been easily implied rather than shown. Rated PG-13, but could have been rated PG.

0439023513|2.0|I hated the first book, thought Catching Fire was better and now feel incredibly betrayed by Mockingjay.  I feel like anyone can tell a story with violence and Collins had so much power to tell a story about a strong, young woman, but instead the audience is left as much of a pawn in the telling of the story as the Tributes are in the Games and as used as the people of the districts are.  Collins lacks the creative imagination to turn this into a powerful story of a young woman who can be a beacon of change for her district and the world of Panem.  I would suggest not becoming a lemming like those in the Capitol, sure read the books and be warned of the lazy storytelling with incredibly disgusting violence, but don't support the films.

B006PTL1GC|4.0|David Cronenberg is most famous for his earlier work, which revolved around various incarnations of the New Flesh.  His three most recent films (shall we call it the Viggo Mortensen Trilogy?)  could be described as analyzing the New Identity.  Longtime fans have expressed disappointment, of course, although both A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE and EASTERN PROMISES are arguably the strongest overall films of Cronenberg's career.  A DANGEROUS METHOD is a nice end-cap to the prior two films, while never quite reaching their brutal eloquence.  This is perhaps because METHOD is more a movie of ideas, and ideas, while captivating, don't necessarily make for an entertaining film.  The story (such as it is) follows Carl Jung, as he rehabilitates Sabina Spielrein, discovering in her not only a brilliant young woman, but also a fierce lover.  This relationship causes friction between Jung and his mentor/friend, Sigmund Freud, and ultimately leads to the split between the two.  (No spoilers; it's history, after all.)<br /><br />This is a slow film; indeed, at times the audience's attention is tempted to waver (thus, the lack of a fifth star).  To look away would be to miss a fine little film, however.  The performances from the three leads is utterly captivating.  The film belongs to Michael Fassbender and Keira Knightley, the former restraining his baser urges, the latter exhibiting unrestrained emotional outbursts.  Viggo Mortensen is along in a supporting capacity, utterly disappearing into the role of a jovial, thoughtful Freud.  Turning in small, but excellent, supporting roles are Vincent Cassel (as Otto Gross) and Sarah Gadon as Emma Jung.  Christopher Hampton's script (based off of his play) is top-notch, and Cronenberg's direction is surprisingly controlled; for a director known for chaotic abandoned, Cronenberg plays the film fairly close to the chest, except for a few key scenes with Knightley.  Arguably, A DANGEROUS METHOD could have benefited from a little abandon; it's not boring, not at all, but the film is ultimately missing something.  Still, it's a fine addition to Cronenberg's cannon, one that leaves us hankering for his next disturbed offering.boring, not at all, but the film is ultimately missing something.

B004T2QZL8|1.0|I liked the game a lot until the forced close issues,  well forced me to uninstall it.  I hope someone reads the reviews and fixes this fun game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is the best game ive ever played in my life but not as bad as life its self
B005NKGEP2|5.0|Layer upon layer of intrigue and deception.  Questions marriage and loyalty in a plot that will keep you guessing to the very end, though the clues are all right there for you to find.  A complex technical computer crime is at the heart of this tale, but explained in a way that does not distract from the story.  Great book.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|My mom and I recently watched all three seasons of Veronica Mars and we loved it. We were disappointed that the show didn't continue. I was purchasing some books and was looking for something that would push me to the $25 mark so I could get the free shipping. This series stood out because of all the very positive reviews that it received. I had never watched the show when it was on TV. It was a great choice. We watched the first season in a week and quickly purchased the other two. Definitely recommend this series and can't complain about the prices.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|Clearly this is targeted for iOS and Samsung Galaxy users.  Android nor the Kindle versions have Danger Zone or an extra Eggsteroid level.  While Android OS and Kindle users have also been cheated out of Surf and Turf, which was previously available only on Facebook.  Once again, Apple gets the most stuff and releases sooner than others.  Apple OS users cried foul, no pun intended, when Anderoid received an update to Rio with trophy/award bonus levels.  Apple users had to wait a whopping whole 2 days before they received it as well.  The other insult to Anderoid users is the lack of the Mighty Eagle, which we finally all got to get a similar gaming experience with the Mighty Dragon in Angry Birds Seasons.  Lastly, don't feel obligated to support the developer.  Rovio has an amusement park, retail brick and mortar outlets and online revenue.  I enjoy the game, but I am extremely disappointed in both Amazon and Rovio for not providing a complete, satisfying experience for the price paid for this version.

1932735410|5.0|This is an excellent review book for the PMP exam. It is just as good as everyone else has said it is.
B00756GKBA|4.0|Let's face it folks--this is not her best album. I rate it at a 3.75 but appears at 4 stars here. I am not her \\"fan\\" per se but a music aficionado. How dare some of you claim, \\"She should retire.\\" Why she should stop? She still could groove, dance, and sing! Just because she's chronologically aged at 53(?), she should \\"retire\\"? I don't think so! Some of you reviewers and so-called \\"fans\\" should relax and enjoy your life more. Onto the review: Great selections of dance/club songs and I was glad there were a few ballads like \\"Masterpiece,\\" \\"Falling Free,\\" and \\"Love Spent\\" showcasing Madonna's vocals and her frailties of the character she perform in her songs. I bought MDNA because I like experiencing aurally the Queen of Pop's reinventing herself and blending in with her music environment. She is far from IRRELEVANT! Madonna inspired MANY artists and gave rise to artists like Lady Gaga, et. al.<br /><br />If you are looking for soul-searching music, look elsewhere because MDNA isn't it. It is more to recuperate from a loss/breakup and move on with life--\\"dancing the night away.\\" I am enthralled by \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" and \\"I'm A Sinner.\\" Some of these sounds are reminiscent of her previous works. For example: \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" sound close to her \\"Celebrations,\\" while \\"I'm A Sinner\\" resembles \\"Shanti/Ashanti.\\" Regardless of their similarities, I like to consider her past works have reincarnated into different sonic forms and are alive on MDNA. Check this CD out! Even if you're not a fan of Madonna, you don't have to purchase this CD. Listen to the radio and watch her music videos on YouTube.<br /><br />Give MDNA a chance or a second chance. I think the music will grow on you and make entice you to groove on your own terms. AGE IS JUST A NUMBER! Madonna remains young at heart and that is what I like about her as the artist and as a human being. I am definitely looking forward to what she will reinvent next!

B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book was much better written than Helmet for My Pillow: From Parris Island to the Pacific by Robert Leckie. With the Old Breed is more graphic and hair raising. It gives a much better description of how it must have been to be a Marine in one of these battles. [[ASIN:B001MT5NT6 Goodbye, Darkness: A Memoir of the Pacific War]] is another of my other all time favorite books about World War 2 in the Pacific.
0062124293|3.0|Vanity Fair claims that this is \\"The British version of Tina Fey's 'Bossypants.' \\" I beg to differ. I have read Ms. Fey's book and this book, \\"How to Be a Woman\\" is nothing like \\"Bossypants.\\" Nothing. I have just finished Sarah Silverman's book \\"Bedwetter\\" and Moran's writing style is more like Silverman's. Why? For some odd reason, Moran and Silverman are very focused on body parts and bodily functions than what I remember reading in Fey's book. I have to disagree with my favorite magazine's endorsement, which is printed on my advanced copy's cover.<br /><br />I'll be honest here. I almost threw the book down and called it quits just after the first few chapters as I was so disgusted. When I picked this book, I had no idea that it would be a collection of crude writings on body parts and functions. I honestly do not care about women's issues in that regards. I much prefer the motherhood/wife section and other sections than the thirteen year old girl discovering herself for the first time.<br /><br />I am glad though that I didn't quit the book because Moran really did have some good insights on feminism. She writes with a quick sharp wit and some of her stuff is funny, especially on fashion and cosmetic surgery and how unfair it is that men age better than women and so on. I love her insights on fashion and on Lady Gaga. True, it might be more of a lighthearted observation on fashion, gossip magazines and not enough historical tidbits to go on, but this is supposed to be a lighthearted read (at least that is how I took it).<br /><br />I have not heard of Moran before now and will be keeping an eye out for her in the news. This is a fun read but it is unfortunate that it had to have some chapters that almost ruined the book for me, which is why I rated it a three star instead of four. Once I got past those chapters, I did find myself enjoying the book and Moran's humor.<br /><br />3/28/12
B0041B785Y|3.0|Koloss - 2012 - Meshuggah<br /><br />For me, the excitement and anticipation for a new Meshuggah album is unlike any other. Funny how my life has progressed over the years. I remember skipping class, heading to Last Unicorn to buy the newest album, taking an 8th of mushrooms, and listening to the album over and over again for hours and hours.  Years later I got out of work, went home to download the newest album on a desktop, smoked a couple grams of chronic and constantly rewound part after part of every song for hours and hours. Now the 2012 me pre-ordered Koloss, got it in the mail five days before the release date, waited three days until my next day off work, had a few glasses of wine and listened to the album once, start to finish, with no interruptions. My how times change.<br /><br />I have started listening to the album more and more to gather a good perspective of the end result. Right off the bat it must be said; Koloss is a terrific metal album. It must be considered one of the best, if not the best metal album of 2012. But its hard to see anything coming out in the next nine months that can top this. I do have to mention the new Cannibal Corpse album, great release by a great band, but no Koloss.<br /><br />As a Meshuggah album I just found it to be good, and any Meshuggah album thats just good is a major let down to any true fan. Meshuggah is known for pushing the envelope for every release they muster, and they most certainly did that with Koloss. I just cant stop thinking of this release as being one step forward and two steps back. Yes, they calmed down on being so \\"anal\\" about their approach for song writing and recording, but is that enough? Initially I was excited to hear this for myself, but it became a minor let down in a way. The let down was not so much the recording process, but the writing process. The most notable difference being the organic feel of the recording and mastering of the album, largely do to Meshuggah not mastering their album themselves. This has been the first time taking this approach since 1998. They brought back Daniel Bergstrand to do the job. He was used for the production of Destroy Erase Improve and Chaosphere. He did a great job making Koloss sound how Meshuggah wanted the songs they wrote to sound like; raw and organic, like passed Meshuggah records. But the writing...<br /><br />Since obZen we have all come to expect the most limitless and technical song structures only meshuggah can produce. Even while listening to Destroy Erase Improve you cant help but think of it being way before it's time. To this day when I listen to that album I think to myself \\" Why was I listening to Life Is Peachy then! \\" But with Koloss its almost like they wanted to make a statement to all the so called \\"djent\\" metal bands out there, saying \\"to all the bands who ripped us off, listen to this, this is how you do it, this is how you should sound\\". For those of you who don't know, djent is a metal genre that has already been played out in its very short existence. Meshuggah started the genre and crappy bands have ruined it. Most djent metal bands are not memorable, and that is the case of Koloss, a high majority of forgettable tracks. Honestly it's the most forgettable Meshuggah album to date.<br /><br />Koloss reminds me of a very less technical version of Nothing, and all Meshuggah fans know how technical Nothing is, technical, but not very.  While I listen to Koloss I can hear a lot of influences Meshuggah used from their previous albums; most notable being Nothing.<br /><br />Just to give an idea of my enjoyment of a few Meshuggah releases, I'm going to break it down in a percentage rating so you can see where I'm coming from: Destroy Erase Improve-85%, Chaosphere-90%, Nothing-75%, Catch ThirtyThree-100%, obZen-90%. But with Koloss I can say I only enjoyed ruffly 50% of it. Yes, the album sounds great and heavy, I do appreciate the organic raw vibe they were going with, but its the song structures that bother me the most.<br /><br />Do You remember when James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich asked Jason Newsted and Kirk Hammett for song ideas for Load? And we all know what happened to Metallica after that. I'm not saying in the instance of bands like Slipknot, Cradle of Filth, or In Flames, changing there whole writing process to appease the masses, but rather when a band uses ideas from other band members who should never have been listened to in the first place to come up with fresh ideas for their new albums. That happens far to much and you can actually sense a little bit of that going on with Koloss. The two worst songs on the album came from  Mårten Hagström and Jens Kidman. If that doesn't come to an end we're going to have a problem.<br /><br />This is the first Meshuggah album I've ever heard with great parts in the middle of decent songs. Usually all Meshuggah songs are enjoyable from beginning to end. Never would I have thought I'd have to sift through Meshuggah songs to find anything worthy, not worth it for any band.<br /><br />Track One: I Am Colossus: 2/5<br />  As soon as the track started, I was scratching my head wondering why this was the opener. It's a late middle track at best. Yes, the track lets you know the album will sound great, but made me skeptical of the song structures early. This track is a so so song with a couple good parts. A typical head banging song but not in the great Meshuggah way.<br /><br />Track Two: The Demons Name is Surveillance: 4/5<br />  As soon as the track started my hopes went threw the roof. I felt trapped on a runaway train going a thousand miles an hour. I was doomed! This song hits you fast and hard. It doesn't stop pummeling you in expected Meshuggah fashion. This song is in my top three favorite tracks.<br /><br />Track Three: Do Not Look Down: 3/5<br />  As soon as the track started my hopes came down a little bit. It's an interesting song but seems lazy to me, to boring even for Meshuggah. Typical choppyguitars with odd time signatures. Pretty decent song none the less.<br /><br />Track Four: Behind The Sun: 1/5<br />  Worst song on the album. Just simply not a good song. It gets a one instead of a zero because of the good ending, and also because it's ending.<br /><br />Track Five: The Hurt That Finds You First: 2/5<br />  Decent song I guess. To many tracks like this on the album already. I do enjoy the time signatures and Fredrick's work, but barely.<br /><br />Track Six: Marrow: 3/5<br />  Another good song with great parts. Although its a nice shift from where the album has been taking the listener. Finally.<br /><br />Track Seven: Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion: 4/5<br />  The thick and choppy Meshuggah that I love. Great intro, great verses and chorus. Great transitions, great bridge and ending. GREAT song. Beautiful Fredrick work. Nicely done Mårten. This is in my top three favorite tracks.<br /><br />Track Eight: Swarm: 4/5<br />  Smile on my face from start to finish. It has an old school Meshuggah feel. Great song. Almost on my top three tracks.<br /><br />Track Nine: Demiurge: 4/5<br />  A song completely written by Mårten Hagström and unlike the other tracks he co wrote with other members that I do not like, I actually love this song. It's like a song not written by Meshuggah but sounds like Meshuggah. Refreshing. In my top three favorite tracks.<br /><br />Track Ten: The Last Vigil: 5/5<br />  I love when Meshuggah does this. Whether it be a part of a song or a whole song, I'm just a sucker for it. Its a beautiful and haunting journey. The track is like \\"Acrid Placidity\\" off DEI and \\"Sum\\" off Catch ThirtyThree. Just great. The band was debating on putting this track in the middle of the album.  The flow of the album would have been completely diminished if it came during track four or five, but it's perfect at the end. It's a soothing breather after such a brutal album.<br /><br />Fredrick Thordendal: 3/5<br />  Great sound like always. A lot less signature frederick on this album though, less solos and what not. Brains behind the song structures, just not at the top of his game with this album.<br /><br />Mårten Hagström: 3/5<br />  Great sound like always. He did write some ruff material on this album, but wrote one of my favorite songs also. Fredrick and Mårten are a great guitar duo.<br /><br />Thomas Haake: 4/5<br />  The reason Meshuggah is so damn good and has set the bar so high in not only metal music but all music is the drummer. Thomas Haake is a god send. Although he lightened up on his amazing technical ability on this one, he still shows all why he is the greatest metal drummer on the planet.<br /><br />Jens Kidman: 5/5<br />  Always sounds amazing. Always perfect syllable placement for the words. His screams are less growling on this album, and more clear. I like the change up. It's like Chaosphere and obZen molded together.  He is what a metal singer should sound like.<br /><br />Dick Lövgren: -<br />  Has no writing input what so ever. Plays the bass how Meshuggah wants him to, then Meshuggah makes it sound how they want it to sound.<br /><br />Lyrics: 4/5<br />  Thomas Haake is the greatest lyricist in music. He shows this on every Meshuggah album, especially on Koloss. The worst song on Koloss has the worst lyrics, Haakes can't nail it every time.<br /><br />Artwork/Title: 2/5<br />  When I saw the artwork and heard the title for the album, I was skeptical to say the least. When I saw the obZen cover and read the name I was floored. They usually take great direction with the visuals. But after hearing the album Im just satisfied with the artwork/title. It fits the album. Didn't like how they reprised the snakes from Catch ThirtyThree though.<br /><br />Although Koloss was some what of a let down, you can't help but enjoy how brutally heavy it is and how great the sound turned out. It's the most logical step Meshuggah could have taken toward their discography.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have no idea why this book has caused such a sensation.  For me, reading a good book transports me into the story; I can visualize the characters interacting when the author has the talent to make the story and world she created on paper BELIEVABLE. The only thing this author is good at is hiring the right PR firm.  All of her sentences are one dimensional.  No matter how hard I tried I could not be drawn into the story when the only way she can describe something is with a kindergarten level adjective and endless stream of short sentences consisting of I did, I tried, I thought, my that....Come on.  Don't buy into the hype, this is one case where the movie...even if it is R rated will be far better than the book.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I left the theatre, saying to myself, were the critics asleep ? The visuals were top-notch and of course the genius of Mr. Burroughs, in creating characters and story settings, that inspired all the modern generation of movie makers, going back before even Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (Inspired by Arthur C. Clarke's The Sentinel). Please watch this movie, before it leaves theatres. I assure you, you will not be dismayed; unlike the critics. I, for one, am looking forward to the blu-ray release and the hope that a sequel may still be possible.<br />Take Me Back to Barsoom !!!!

B0071WQ7WU|5.0|I have been a Shinedown fan since day 1 and once again Shinedown has created a new and great album.  I have already played through it several times and I can honestly find something to like from every song.  It may not sound like The Sound of Madness but that was not the goal of the group.  They wanted this album to sound different from their albums of the past and they accomplished that goal in a great way.  This one will never get old playing on the Ipod.  The combination of your classic Shinedown sounds with some of the more orchestra sounding music is a great and unbeatable blend.  Also you have your couple of tracks that are that classic aggressive Shinedown sound as well.  Overall.....solid 5/5 stars for me.

B0054N73EY|2.0|I've liked at least a few songs from each RHCP album, and have bought all of the albums starting with Californication. A few have had some poorly mastered sound to them. Treble too high, usually. This one, all of the songs sound like they're higher volume than they are, all the time. Or like I'm trying to listen to it with something blocking my ears. It's like the sound guy just pushed all the equalizer slides all the way up. Take one of your favorite songs and try listening to it with all the equilizer slides at the top. It's miserable.<br /><br />I'm having trouble enjoying the music because it doesn't sound right. I've had low-quality MP3s with better audio than this album. It might be a great album if they can get it re-mastered from the originals.<br /><br />Sad and disappointing.<br /><br />Update: I had read elsewhere that the album is \\"optimized for iTunes\\" and I will say it's a little easier to listen to on my iPod nano through headphones. But I don't feel this makes up for anything since music I buy should sound good on a good stereo just as much as it should sound good on a mp3 player.

B00701QVVY|3.0|I absolutely love Overkill and have the utmost respect for them as musicians and people. Blitz just kills on this album, especially at 52 years old, sounds better than he did in the 80's. The songs are well structured and for the most part well written. The only problem i have is that some of the songs feel a bit rushed IMO. \\"Come and get it\\" has a very catchy chorus that sticks in your head like glue, but then goes down into the groove laden area that just doesn't fit. Once they thrash they need to do it non stop. Also i've never been a big fan of the oooh ooooh oooo. Electric Rattlesnake takes a throw back to Ironbound, and is a great thrasher, but there again sounds rehashed (a bit). Wish you were dead uses the blues tinged vocals that Blitz has been using since Necroshine, which i was never a fan of, and has done on songs like Devils in the Mist, The Green And Black, Devil By The Tale, Thunderhead and Damned. I just wish the old WFO, Horrorscope dark side of Blitz was more prominent on the album. Some songs sound, well a bit to \\"happy\\".<br /><br />Before you criticize the album is brutal, it just lacks that old school thrash sound with the dark, negative vibe. Other great songs are Save Yourself, All Over But The Shouting, and (Parts) of Good Night, some parts are very old school, others are well, a bit corny. I would never, and never have said an Overkill album sucks, but some songs are great, and some are, well just rehashed Overkill. But at least they do it ten times better than Megadead, Slayer(ed), and Metallican't. That's why i love them, they don't conform, but in my mind they didn't try enough new integration on this record to keep up with the old. The elements are mostly the same. But hey, i know i'll get lynched for being the only 3 star review so far, but i've followed this band since 1988 when i was a mere lad of 13. So i've seen it all. The album is brutal, but just nothing to write home about. Blitz's voice though is just amazing here. Also i've NEVER been of fan of David Linsks solos, that's why i've never given a full 5 star review to any Overkill album in the last 12 years. He's the weak link. Bring back Cannavino, and Gant anyday!! But he does get the job done. So rock on, Overkill will be doing this until they are 80!! If we all live that long. Good album, NOT great. And btw, don't even try and compare this to Horrorscope, sorry guys, NO! :)<br /><br />BTW-Does anyone know if Derek the Skull even plays on these albums? I hear nothing from him.
B0076NAWWA|5.0|Every now and again - an album comes along that surprises, pleases and delights. This is such a work.<br /><br />I've heard all of these players in different venues/bands except for Casey McPherson and I think his inclusion here took players at the top of the heap and injected fresh ideas to the point where the musicality soared in a new and very fresh way.<br /><br />Some have called this a Prog rock album, but I think in many ways it defies categorization except to say that it is the result of some very MUSICAL people collaborating on one of the freshest albums of all time. Every time you think you 'hear' what is coming next, there is a surprise around the corner that brings a smile.<br /><br />If there is any criticism it would be that the musical styles explored are so varied that the album may lack 'a thread.' But as the ideas roll out of the speakers, I find myself taking delight in moment after moment, and it's easy to just let this music wash over you.<br /><br />Support this music, and let's hope that an encore is soon in the works as well as a tour. I could easily say this is the best new album I've heard in a decade - enjoy!

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|All the previous reviewers have already said it all (and very eloquently!), but how can I resist adding my own humble opinion?  I had been waiting for this to come to Amazon Prime (worth every penny!!), and I've been immersed in the land of Westeros ever since!  HBO has gotten every single thing right, and I applaud their dedication to bringing Game of Thrones to life. The settings (the immensity of The Wall, just breathtaking!), the castles, costumes, the whole \\"tone\\" of the series ... just beautifully done.<br /><br />And it is a wonder to see the characters come to life ... I've read all the books, of course, and throughout them absolutely detested Cerse. Yet I have come to have some compassion (bordering on pity) for her, and for King Robert (a buffoon and a drunkard, but not without some redeeming virtues). So much care has been taken with even the more peripheral characters (Lord Baylish, The Hound, and Theon Greyjoy, for example, all of whom will have much bigger roles to play in episodes to come). Really extraordinary talent in every single scene.<br /><br />And the music at the opening is remarkable; haunting and soul-stirring, it somehow evokes the somber pressure of autumn on-coming, of galloping horses, and the snap of ships' sails in the wind. Nice touch, too, with the clipped clashing of steel on steel, an echo of battles to come.  Thank you, HBO, for bringing Game of Thrones to life, and thank you Amazon for giving me the opportunity to enjoy this series!

B006ISJQBM|3.0|Based on an early Hunter S. Thompson novel, Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp) travels to Puerto Rico to work for a local American run newspaper.  The paper's editor (Richard Jenkins) is a cartoon like character trying to keep the paper running although it is despised by the locals.  The paper shies away from controversial subjects because advertisers don't want to see negativity.  Booze, especially locally made rum, is a character in the film as well.  Paul becomes friends with a newspaper photographer named Sala (Michael Rispoli) and sometime reporter Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi) who is in a constant state of inebriation.<br /><br />Paul is recruited by one of the island's American land developers to prepare a sales promotion document associated with an under-the-table land grab of a small island off the mainland. It had been used for target practice by the U. S. Navy.  The developer (Aaron Eckhart) has a beautiful beach house and a beautiful live-in girlfriend (Amber Heard).  Paul and Chenault (Heard) have eyes for each other but Paul manages to keep his urges under control until events change everyone's relationship.<br /><br />The movie is at its best when Depp is allowed to take control.  Even when he's not doing all the talking, he remains the film's focus.  There are numerous funny situations and funny lines, but the director/writer Bruce Robinson also meanders into murky political issues, island poverty, racism, bigotry and government sovereignty.  The focus is never clear as to what kind of movie he's making.  As a consequence, the overall result is a mixed bag.  The look of the movie is really excellent.  Whether it is the gorgeous beaches, the `60's glassed-in beach houses or the dilapidated city lofts, they are shot beautifully by Dariusz Wolski.  I would also be remiss if I didn't mention a truly great soundtrack which includes some original music by Christopher Young.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer really sparkles.  It has a 1080p resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The movie if full of colorful cars of the period, beautiful blue skies and darker blue oceans and it all looks great.  More than many transfers, this one has a real film quality to it.  Likewise, there are no issues with the DTS-HD MA 5.1 track.  The sound is first rate from the superior soundtrack to the loud club scene to the ambiant noise.  Solid!io.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|First of all I bought the book the day the movie got out. Best thing about this book is that it's a easy read. Only a few hours and I was done.<br /><br />Second, was it me or the dialogue it very one tone. Katniss is very angry and without much emotion other them anger and distrust.<br /><br />Third, I did enjoy the premise of this book. The idea is really good but I wish I knew more about this Panem country.<br /><br />Fourth and last, even as an adult I hate puppy love and puppy love triangle. So really I didn't give Hunger Games 5 stars for the tone and the love story. I don't intende to read the next two books. Scared I am going to be desappointed.

B005C5A6C0|3.0|If you are Machine Head faithful you are in luck-- \\"Unto the Locust\\" is going to make your month.  If however, you have reservations about this band, this album will definitely make you scratch your head.  If you buy in, you get certain NWOBHM barbaric overtones that are awesome-- but it feels like the price will be your immortal soul.<br /><br />Never one to to miss out on a good trend, new Machine Head is all thrash metal with heavy doses of trendy \\"trad metal\\" and some trendy pop-punk choruses.  An unlikely combination, but against all odds, it is pretty appealing.  Perhaps this album's greatest accomplishment is having clean singing in a style that is not intolerable.  No, really, I hate that pop-punk-metal $#*t, but the song \\"This Is The End\\" is so good that for a minute it actually made me want to go and check on the latest crop of hair metal metalcore bands again.  So, I am willing to admit this is listenable, if a touch on the ridiculously overproduced and glossy side.  I am now forced to wonder why the metal mags that skew towards unlistenable experimental avant-garde black metal (e.g. Decibel) are worshipping at the altar of this highly accessible album, while they still have a hard time admitting that the latest output from Morbid Angel and Bring Me The Horizon kicks their teeth in.  A mysterious world we live in.  Incidentally, Robb Flynn cannot sing this material live, and that is a fact unless I hallucinated my attendance at their show in Chicago this January.<br /><br />I've never been a MH man outside \\"The More Things Change...\\"  Out of respect for the fans, I'd give this album 3 stars-- five stars for execution and one star for credibility.
0439023513|3.0|I'm a bit late on \\"The Hunger Games\\" boat, as I just finished reading the final book last night.<br /><br />I don't hate the ending. I don't necessarily even dislike it. However, I do think it's the weakest book out of the trilogy.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br /><br />I'm not surprised by whom Katniss picks, and why, or about the fact that President Coin dies, but I do find the fact that Coin dies at the hands of Katniss a bit unbelievable. Don't get me wrong. It seems pretty obvious from the beginning that Coin is both shrewd and dangerous, and that she has it out for Katniss. But Katniss herself has been either too naive, too preoccupied with her own pain, or too unable to relate to other people to truly get it. In fact, Haymitch and other people have to explain Coin (and many others) to her. Katniss has such a hard time making up her mind between Peeta and Gale, or about other people's motivations, yet she suddenly sees both Coin and Snow so clearly in the middle of her grief over her sister, the one person she cares about above all others in the world. She suddenly gets that while Snow does think people are expendable, he doesn't like to \\"waste\\" them... Really? Hunter instincts and understanding her prey aren't good explanations, as Katniss kept going into hysterics anytime she felt Snow's presence in the roses, etc., and had to be sedated several times. I don't see how she could be level-headed enough to see the truth behind Snow's words, especially considering her longstanding and supposedly all-consuming and unquenchable vendetta against him. It's true that Katniss is decisive when she's angry, but she mainly reacts to loss, and takes out whomever is responsible for taking that person away from her. In this case, Coin has chosen to remain relatively distant, and there's no real evidence to connect her to Prim's death so soon after the fact, only Snow's word and Katniss' feeling that Coin doesn't especially like her. It's also true that Snow would have been executed either way, but Katniss was so consumed by the need to do it herself that she made it a condition of her cooperation with Coin. She did not want justice, she wanted revenge, so it makes no sense to me to not do it herself. I suppose I understand why, in a book where there is a protagonist and so much symbolism and so much responsibility attached to her, Katniss would have to be the one to kill President Coin, but in real life, I think she would have been too much in her own fog to do it. I think other people would have had to step up to the plate to take out Coin, and in fact, I did wonder why no one else was doing so even before this time.<br /><br />I'm upset that Prim was killed off, simply because I liked her. However, I get that this is war, and I'm not upset enough to think that the rules of engagement should have been bent for her / the readers, or to think that war ever spares the good people or is moral or fair. I would hate to ever be in their situation and stoop down to other people's level, the way Gale does, but I recognize that, sometimes, while it may not be absolutely necessary in order to win the war, it may be the most expedient way, and possibly necessary to save further lives, both physically and emotionally. War makes for desperate people, and in the midst of it, the unconscionable may seem like the only response possible.<br /><br />The rest of the ending is positively cheerful, though, in comparison to the rest of the books. When Katniss finally has kids, I can hear someone off-screen saying, \\"Ah, the persistence of life... It is wonderful.\\" It's a bit heavy-handed and odd. Most people have been damaged by war, but Katniss especially. She was actually a tribute in the Hunger Games. She knew her fellow district tribute going into the first game, and she grew to love him, even if she didn't know it herself for way too long (seriously, I wanted to smack her when she started going back and forth to Gale again). She became a symbol, used and abused by both sides to further their own agendas. She lost practically everyone she cared about, not simply due to the hunger and disease which accompany poverty, or even through death in combat, but through the same manipulations that tore her down. I understand that since the old government has been overthrown and Coin has been removed, the Hunger Games are no longer an issue. But the damage was emotional, and it ran deep, and the simple cessation of the games shouldn't be enough, even after 10 years, to convince her that it's safe. If anything, Coin's suggestion to hold one last symbolic Hunger Games proves that it wasn't the Capitol, per se, which was corrupt, but that people all have the capacity to be evil. People are what's not safe, so how can you possibly feel safe just because one government has fallen, and another has risen in its place? (Note: I don't personally believe this; I just don't see how someone like Katniss would not see it in a sinister light.) This is especially true since Katniss' support system seems to consist mainly of Peeta, who is himself incredibly damaged; Prim is gone, Gale recognizes that Katniss will never be able to see him without thinking of Prim's death and so goes away, Katniss' mother is so wracked by loss and grief that she cannot return to district 12 at all, Greasy Sae wasn't present at the most horrific experiences, Haymitch isn't well-equipped to deal with emotional baggage himself, and Annie didn't have an especially strong relationship with Katniss throughout the book. I don't find Katniss' transformation, or Peeta getting well so relatively quickly in the book, and then enough to make Katniss well, too, believable. It was a very fast and too-tidy wrap-up, all things considered. I mean, she's even doing \\"therapy\\" with writing down her story, even though for the first 20 years of her life, she was wary of people and connecting with them, or of introspection. I think it would have been more realistic if she had gone the way of Haymitch, drowning out her sorrows (not necessarily through alcohol, though), or at least pretending they don't exist or bother her, rather than revisiting them voluntarily.he started going back and forth to Gale again). She became a symbol, used and abused by both sides to further their own agendas. She lost practically everyone she cared about, not simply due to the hunger and disease which accompany poverty, or even through death in combat, but through the same manipulations that tore her down.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really don't know what all the hype is about. This book was a waste of a reader's time. I'll admit that the first few erotic passages were juicy, however, after the third repetitive sex scene, shockingly, it became so boring. It's ridiculous to have to skim the sexual encounters just to complete this book.It's all sex, no plot, and no character development. Congratulations to the author or her agent for the hype. They'll make millions from the movie studios and especially the erotic product sales.
B00701QVVY|5.0|Simply put in a small paragraph, Overkill not only found itself again, but manages to do it better. This record is absolutely amazing. Not only catchy and melodic, but also fast, agressive, furious and most important, Thrashy! After a very experimental, confused and inconsistent late 90s to mid 2000s era, Overkill sat down, thought it over and understood that the best metal they ever created was their 80s stuff (including Horrorscope), and that newer bands where getting heavier, faster, extremer and way more technical than ever. They just had to pick it up. So after a couple of sludgy, groovie and \\"all right\\" releases, they put their engines back on gear and went back to what they did best: Thrash Metal! In 2010, they came out with the AMAZING Ironbound! The record is not only a comeback to their thrash roots, but they also maintained the best element of their second era: the groove!! Ironbound is without question, not only one of the best record of 2010, but one of the very best albums that Overkill has ever recorded. Amazingly for Overkill, thrash was back and angrier than ever. So after two years, they announced that they will be coming back in 2012 with the follow up to Ironbound. Many kept a question on their minds after that statement: Will Overkill be able to at least come up with something that sounds close to Ironbound, or will they go back to their groovie, sludgie and simplistic sound? Well, The Electric age is not only as good and thrashy as Ironbound, but in some aspects, it's even better! You did it again, guys! This is a great Thrash album, one of the best follow ups in thrash metal history, and again, one of the best records of their amazing career. This is Thrash like veterans of the genre are supposed to be playing! So Anthrax, Slayer, Testament, Metallica, Megadeth, etc. I love you guys, but Overkill will kicked your old asses any given day! Those bands just can´t compare themselves with the level of creativity, tenacity, intensity and executionthat this 30 year old Overkill has! 30 years later, Overkill is better than ever! Way better than their contemporaries.<br /><br />The Electric Age is fast, thrashy, groovie and fun! So Metallica, Anthrax, Testament, Slayer, Megadeth! Take notice cuz Overkill has just kicked your buts, AGAIN!!
B002ZG983M|5.0|This movie is outright hilarious with tons of laugh out loud moments. It starts out innocently enough when a high school kid decides to dress up and act the role of a superhero. Things don't go quite as you would expect and the outrageousness just ramps up from there until the end of the movie. I felt that I was watching several movies because the mood would switch from quirky teen drama, to crime/mob boss movie, and of course, to superhero adventure. I think this structure provided a underlying seriousness to the movie that made the comedic moments even more heightened. The characters were awesome. From Nicolas Cage as Big Daddy (think Adam West as Batman, yet motivatedly cruel in combat) to Aaron Johnson in the comfortable nerdy main role, and finally to Hit Girl whose outrageousness is no doubt over-the-top, but is mainly the source for those get up out of your seat, laugh out loud moments. While I loved this movie, it is certainly not suitable for anyone under the age of seventeen.
B005KP7EK4|4.0|Whether or not this is true or based on someone's speculation of circumstantial information, great care was taken to portray the movie in the proper timeline displaying accurate details of time and place. I deeply believed in the content of this story, as it unfolded in a seemingly natural or unforced way. I didn't feel like I was being taken for a ride, but that I had a perspective that was part of the scene; a fly on the wall, if you will. Blackthorn demonstrates beautiful cinematography and high quality acting with an attention getting story (I was watching while I worked and ended up watching more than working). A must see for fans of the \\"old western\\" genre or for just a movie fan.
0307269752|4.0|Between the title and the films you might expect this novel to revolve around the character of Lisbeth Salander, aka the girl with the dragon tattoo, however if you read the Swedish title \\"Men Who Hate Women\\" you might be less confused as to exactly why the protagonist from the title is barely mentioned in the first 1/4 of the book.<br /><br />The story focuses first and foremost on the death of 16 yr old Harriet in the 60's and her Grandfather's obsession with proving she was murdered and finding the body. To do this he hires a freelance journalist who publishes a small magazine and is in legal trouble for printing a slanderous story without sources.<br /><br />Salander is first brought in to run a background on Blomkvist, then we get a few short paragraphs following her as she is abused by her state appointed \\"guardian\\" until finally she is hired on to assist Blomkvist in the investigation when he uncovers new evidence.<br /><br />The book certainly takes off when they are together, the characters are both well established separately and have an immediate and believable chemistry. All at once everything seems to turn on Blomkvist when his employer is hospitalized and the family threatens both his investigation and magazine (which the family owns part of now.)<br /><br />What fails in the novel and may possibly be a translation issue is the meandering, often repetitive writing. The book goes into harrowing details of the specs of Salander's computers, in fact if a character plugs a cord into an outlet it's described in step-by-step instructional details. This dry, pointless prose (especially considering the computers are 10 years outdated by the time I read the book) caused a fair amount of skimming.<br /><br />The last 2/3 of the book are when it really takes off and the pay-off is worth the early slogging. Still, the title is all wrong and the translation can leave much to be desired.

B0076NAWWA|5.0|This is not a prog effort in my opinion, rather a neat selection of carefully crafted pop songs. It's refreshing to have Neal Morse play on a non religious themed release. Steve Morse burns as usual, others are really subdued. I would have liked Neal Morse to sing more here. He only sings minimally (background).....Songs are still growing on me- initial standouts are Blue Ocean, Kayla, Love Is What I'm Waiting For, Everything Changes. Certainly worth adding to the collection.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I finished the 3rd book today.  I read all three in a week and it was wonderful.  It had everything, while there was times the emotions that came across in the writing was hard for me to continue on, I'm so glad I did.  It's been a really long time since I've read something that has made me feel emotionally invested in its characters.  I think I have another favorite author.  I highly recommend these books if you don't mind graphic sex.<br />I'm so sad it's over and I really hope to see something about Mia and Ethan.  All three of these books are definitely keepers and I see myself reading them again.
B0072QPV6I|5.0|DTS Master, BluRay quality, Striking Eyecandy! I'm only in the middle of watching/listening to it for the first time and even now I'm moving in my chair. As I glance back and forth to my kick-butt Samsung 558000, typing as I chair-dance, watching those guys engineer an eye-watering performance, I can't wait for the next time they are here in LA. I'm definitely not a professional reviewer, but I couldn't help to preach the Chemical gospel (no chemicals involved in this review.) This is a keeper.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|its ok but to short I have all of the angry birds on my kindle fire and I beat this one in one day great graphics
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is for just about everybody. The beginning is kinda mellow compared to the rest, but that somehow adds to it. Extremely well written, very clever and just an amazing book. I don't care who you are, but please read this book. You won't regret it, in the slightest. There's a reason it's so popular.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book.  I will admit that I had so many conflicting emotions and I was hard pressed to finish it.  Only because it made me feel so many strong emotions.  I was mad, sad and confused, I'm not use to reading something that makes me actually cry. The author did a wonderful job getting the feelings across in her writing.  I read all three books in a week and I'm so depressed that its over with nothing else of hers to read.  I have recommended this trilogy to a lot of my people.  I can't wait to see more from Mrs. James.
B003HFFVEA|5.0|If you are craving for some artistic cinematography and inspiring sounds, eye candy is the least you can say. These guys have it down! My purchase included a previously used item - a few dents and scratches on the booklet, minor scratches and divots on the DVD, but that didn't stop me from carefully cleaning it up to play just perfectly. For the price, if I had passed on this purchase, I'd be out an experience that is irreplaceable. Additionally, I picked up the new bluray release - Don't Think. Watching/listening to it right now and I can't stop moving. Please, don't download this from the usual places, the clarity isn't comparable. You have to see it to believe it.

B00280LYHS|5.0|I started this series about four years ago durring High School for my english class (required reading). When I read the first one I thought it was a great story and if a more advanced writer had taken the challenge it would have been one of my favorite book series of all time, however since it was geared toward young adults I was let feeling the writer had simplified the story more than he wanted to.<br />After a few years passes I came upon the second book in the series for a very low price and decided to give it a try. Read it in a day, go the next one. Then the next until now. I am at book five and just cant stop!!!! Each book has grown with the character and gotten increasingly more dramatic and complex. I'm 22 and reading this greek based series is just wonderful! One of the best history based/ adventure packed/ power filled/ riveting young adult series I have read!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|As I've said in my review of the first book, Mrs. James did a wonderful job conveying the feelings of the characters in her writing.  I really hope to see more from this author.  It had everything, laughter, crying, heartache, madness.  This was the best book I've read in a really long time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was an interesting, different type of read.  I liked the approach being written in the first person.  I can understand why it appeals to people of all ages, although I understand it was initially written for younger readers.  Very enjoyable!

0307352145|5.0|Holey Moley, this book should be a college course complete with PowerPoint presentations.  High reactive, Low reactive, nature, nurture, gene percentages, this theory, that theory, this high-level media personality, this quiet reserved business genius, personality versus temperament.  Pseudo-extraverts.  Self-monitoring.  By the middle of the book, I was brain fried.<br /><br />...Free will can take us far, but it cannot carry us infinitely beyond our genetic limits....<br /><br />Susan Cain has done her research masterfully.  The amount of time and effort that she has put forth should be commended and hopefully will garner the attention that this fascinating subject demands.<br /><br />I have so many sticky notes sticking out of this book that it is beginning to be embarrassing to be seen in public - which I am beginning to think just might be an introvert thing.  I wish I could directly quote all the light bulb moments that I have found in this book, but that would border on plagiarism.  You just have to track down this book for yourself to see how this subject talks to you.<br /><br />...Psychologists often discuss the differences between \\"temperament\\" and personality.\\"  Temperament refers to inborn, biologically based behavioral and emotional patterns that are observable in infancy and early childhood; personality is the complex brew that emerges after cultural influences and personal experience are thrown into the mix....<br /><br />What initially drew me to this book is the diversity that I find myself in on a daily basis.  5 days a week, 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week I work with highly educated introverted engineers in cubicle world where interpersonal communication can be a challenge and individualized working time is cherished.  Add to that the remainder of my time is with a teenaged extravert.  Her boundless energy and involvement with education, clubs, organizations, sports and friends has her running from place to place with very little down time and she thrives on this interaction.<br /><br />Occasional sections talk about the parent child dynamic and I had found myself wishing that this had been expanded.  I do not know if Susan Cain ever considered this book to be a parenting manual, but I have gained some great insight in my parenting role.  Maybe that could be volume two.  Examples, stories and interviews are included throughout the book allowing the reader to place the people that they interact with into each scenario to better understand the individuals around them.<br /><br />Susan Cain has put a vast amount of time and research into this book.  It is not a book to be read quickly and more along the lines of a long slow savor.  Each section, each paragraph has something to offer the reader.  Take your time with this book, it deserves an initial and a secondary reading to absorb the thinking and contribution that introverts can make.  As Susan said, just because a person is loud, does not mean that they have anything to offer.  Sit back and listen to what the quiet people have to say.<br /><br />...Figure out what you are meant to contribute to the world and make sure you contribute it....e thrives on this interaction.<br /><br />Occasional sections talk about the parent child dynamic and I had found myself wishing that this had been expanded.

0307456625|4.0|I have been to Botswana and back, with this book. Refreshing mystery tales, almost like short stories in themselves. I took an instant liking to the character of Mma Ramotswe, self-made, determined woman who opens up a ladies detective agency which was unheard of in that town. With her intuition and thinking abilities, she solves one case after another with ease. The book takes you in from the very start with a case to solve. Though I did not like the change from the case to learning about the life of Precious's father and her childhood, I realized that it is important for the building up of a character and took it in my stride. Later, this proved to be beneficial. I have always enjoyed mysteries, especially those where I get to think with the detective and give my mind a jog to solve it. I ended up doing that a lot with this book.<br /><br />*Spoiler*<br />I loved the character of the little Indian girl who ends up conning Ramotswe.  And was I glad to hear her nod to marriage in the end. I loved her so much to wish for her to have a companion and a worthy match at that.<br />*End of Spoiler*<br /><br />I loved to solve mysteries and be a detective since childhood, whenever something disappeared from our home, I would be the one to find it. The only case where it wasn't found was when I was the one who had hidden it in the first place.<br /><br />A lovely, short book that finished even before you realize it since you are so engrossed solving the mysteries.<br /><br />I also picked up some great quotes from the book-<br /><br />\\"It was time to take the pumpkin out of the pot and eat it. In the final analysis, that was what solved these big problems of life. You could think and think and get nowhere, but you still had to eat your pumpkin. That brought you down to earth. That gave you a reason for going on.

B006PTL1QM|5.0|A DANGEROUS METHOD offers the audience a look at the beginnings of psychoanalysis by presenting the lives of four important doctors at eh turn of the 20th century. The film is adapted by Christopher Hampton from his play `The Talking Cure' which in turn was a dramatization of John Kerr's book `A Most Dangerous Method'. An interesting aspect of the film is that it is primarily a film about discussions embroidered with enough action to make it cinematic. It is beautiful to watch, a pleasure to hear (Howard Shore's musical score consists of `arrangements' of themes form the operas of Richard Wagner with an emphasis on the `Siegfried Idyll' which as a work with its own similar history that plays exceptionally well into this story), a challenge to absorb in the hands of director David Cronenberg, and a showcase for some fine acting.<br /><br />The film opens in 1904 with Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) accepting as a patient young Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; Sabina Spielberg (Kiera Knightley) who is a tortured soul from a past abusive upbringing.  We are like a fly on the wall, observing Sabina's neurotic/psychotic behavior as Jung begins to tame her: their gradually successful treatment results in an affair both emotional and physical despite the fact that Jung is married to Emma (Sarah Gadon) and has children and also despite the fact that Jung believes the doctor/patient relationship should be respected. Meanwhile off in Vienna Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) is gaining acclaim for this psychoanalytic work and refers a patient of his, a fellow analyst Dr. Otto Gross (Vinvent Cassell) whose extreme sexual acting out has gained notoriety. Jung accepts Gross as a patient and from the stance of the story, Jung learns more form Gross than Gross benefits from Jung: apparently Jung's libido is encouraged and that urges him to act out with Sabina, now able to respond to the world in a manner so appropriate that she becomes a medical student and eventually a psychiatrist also.  The story also examines the coming together and the eventual parting of ways between Jung and Freud and it is this part of the film that becomes more significantly and satisfyingly cerebral.  It is this intense relationship between Freud and Jung that gives us a quality understanding of the birth of psychoanalysis.<br /><br />Though the opening scenes of the film - those that focus on the outrageous behavioral changes in Sabina - becoming trying on the nerves, the remainder of the film is intellectually satisfying. Kiera Knightley stumbles with her Russian accent and tends to take her character's mental aberrations too far, but otherwise she is excellent in her role.  Both Michael Fassbender and Viggo Mortensen offer elegant and understated characterizations of these two important men in the history of medicine.  Vincent Cassell and Sarah Gadon are also exceptional in their acting. Providing more in depth studies of both Freud and Jung would have been welcome, but in the confines of a film we at least are allowed insights into the minds of these two men.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|Paris, France during WWII.  Never did I know why the world hated the French so much.  Then I<br />found out - they ceded their own citizens to the Nazi concentration camps.  A heart-breaking<br />story, and I'm sure it's not all fiction.  The movie was also excellent, but I prefer using<br />my own imagination in some instances.

I have only quit reading a book before I finished it a few times in my life and sure wish I had this time.  These are hours I wish I could have back.  Read at your own risk, but I do not recommend it!
B0038QAVPC|5.0|This dvd of Andre's trip to Melbourne in 2007 does not equal his trip to Sydney but it is another fantastic concert by this guy who has turned people on to classical music that would normally not be interested in it.Its hard to top the Sydney show where he had the most realistic bull come charging down the isle during a mexican piece of music.of course its very hard to top Dame Edna coming out at the end and thanking Andre for being her opening act.the only negative thing about the Sydney show was the cd that was produced where Andre left the Dame Edna piece completely out that was a big mistake.The Melbourne show is fantastic though, especially the Carmen Minarka number which almost had us in tears.
B004A2V3K0|5.0|how could a bon jovi greatest hits be anything other than amazing? this cd is just one hit after another after another. they just keep coming. and the few new tunes on this cd fit seemlessly. the only problem with a bon jovi greatest hits is that every bon jovi fan has there favorite tunes, but they may not have been a single.if you want a real solid overview of bon jovi, this cd is just a no-brainer. add it to your collection today

B007B8EX9I|5.0|Holy cow!  This title may be misleading:  I was tempted to skip this episode, thinking it just a puffed up Christmas \\"special\\", but to be frank, I'm so addicted to this series and its characters that I thought, \\"Oh, what the hell.\\". Boy, am I glad I did!  This is a big, important episode - perhaps the best of the season, with lots of not-to-be-missed turns for fans.  I'm a late-comer to Downton, so I had to catch up on both seasons all at once, watching the original \\"UK Version\\" of Season 2 here on Amazon.  I don't know how these episodes compare to what aired on PBS, but if this Episode 8 did not, do yourself a favor and watch it!

I work in social media and video marketing, constantly looking for new ways to generate leads, buzz, viral content, you name it.<br /><br />This book exceeded my expectations. On the previously mentioned flight, I found myself frantically searching for a pen to jot down ideas that were coming across in the text. I titled this review, \\"Must Read for Every Marketer,\\" because Dave is not just selling social media, he is selling an attitude. Fostering conversations, encouraging brand advocates, and developing customer relationships are all addressed through the vehicle of social media.

B004HEXSLI|5.0|My husband suffered a stroke on march 9, 2011, I had no idea what we were in for after his stroke, from the start I believed (or chose to believe) that his recovery was going to be just fine, I didn't realy know what the outcome was going to be after a stroke and thought only that he was going to be the same as he was before the stroke. weh he came out of recovery after his operation (same operation as jill's) he had lost his ability to communicate, everyhting came out jumbled, he lost his right periphrial vision in both eyes. we were at a lose, he eventually started going to Speech/language theraphy and Occuaptional Theraphy rehab center, when we were home he saw our local S/L. OT therapists. Our concern was, was he ever going ot be the same or get back what he had before the stroke, was he going to work again (his biggest fear, not working), \\"My Stroke Of Insight\\" has given us more hope then we could have imagined, to hear what Jill went through and what my husband is going through gave us a feeling that we were not alone (very hard to find support group in our community) we now know and beleive that he will recover to the fullest extent that his body will allow him to, he is a very determind man and with that nothing can stop him from acheiving everything he wants in life. Thank you Jill for sharing your journey. you have given us more hope then we had before.

B0074EIQQU|5.0|After the slightly disappointing Octahedron, I was hesitant to pick this one up. I've loved the band since 2006, and was particularly fond of that controlled chaos that they seemed to have on every album. Octahedron was just a bit too much in the opposite direction, and slowed things down way to much for me. This however seems like the natural progression from Octahedron, and is a better change of sound for the group. Songs are shorter and more compact, full of hooks and really catchy choruses. The album doesn't really let up though, and there are still some intense moments (The Whip Hand and In Absentia). I'm back on board and can't wait to hear where they go from here! 9/10
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I just HAD to read this book. When will I learn? The language is redundant (she \\"flushes\\" or \\"blushes\\" over 100 times) and the voice is much older than the characters. The story is unbelievable not because of the story but because of little details like a college student who doesn't have a computer or email account (really?). It drags on and on... I finally stopped reading. I'm so glad I bought this when it was 3 bucks cheaper. Way overhyped. Read a short harlequin from the erotica series instead.

B002HFWAWW|1.0|Before you buy this import, you should know that this film has been modified from its theatrical 2.35-1 aspect ratio to 1.77-1 -- this even though the the Blu-ray case says 2.35-1 as well. Needless to say, I'm returning this purchase. Amazon, you REALLY ought to correct this information.
B004UXUX7S|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find myself absorbed in this fine drama/comedy starring George Clooney in another fine performance with fine direction from Alexander Payne, who waited several years before committing to this film--but the wait was worth it.  Another plus of course is the Hawaiian background since I lived there many moons ago but again the story is the key here plus the acting especially from the Shaleen Woodley who should've copped an Oscar nom for her supporting role as Clooney's wayward daughter.  It's a shame that \\"The Artist\\" overtook this fine film but I think the Academy was patting itself on the back for giving it to that French film rather than this masterpiece.
0439023513|2.0|The first two books were WONDERFUL.  I read each one of them in a day.  This one almost seemed like it was written by someone else. It was all over the place. The characters were completely different and I had to force myself to finish it. Not great.

Then ' off to the races' won me over! Now it is My go to Chill album. Love that album! Yes, she may not be that great live (Snl anyone?) But do artists really NEED to have an awesome live presence anymore? With electronic media, and all the internet radio stations where all an artist has to do is upload music (no agent, record label needed).  I am a huge fan of finding that great artist nobody's ever heard of.<br />Favorite songs: Diet mountain dew, off to the races, summertime sadness, .......
B00792EGES|5.0|It's all in the title.<br />I didn't think AB could top their Amsterdam performance but in my opinion they did. All of the classics are there plus 7 songs from AB III; the energy the band put in their performance is amazing and the fan response is even better, the mosh pits are awesome!! You can tell playing at Wembley was really a dream come true for them (plus the fact that Myles can't stop smiling and laughing says it all)<br /><br />Highlight of the concert in my opinion: The breathtaking wonderful life/watch over you combination.<br /><br />Overall an amazing DVD that YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO BUY!!

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I will read just about anything I can get my hands on... I've always been a reader so I am no stranger to bad writing or dissapointing endings. But this book just left me feeling more disaapointed and empty than anything I've read in a long time. I wouldn't have cared if Katniss has wound up an old maid and chosen neither. It wasn't really about the love story it was about a girl who was willing to give her life for her sister. Then she was willing to die to show how sick and awful the hunger games were and ffinally she wad willing to sacrificed herself to save her friend Peeta who is remarkably a good person through and through. But in the last book her character is flat and unrecognizable. The writing is fragmented and does not flow together at all. I kept putting it down at odd intervals because I was increasingly frustrated at the progression of events. I wasn't upset at the events that occurred, the storyline, the losses, the deaths... I was upset that I felt no emotions about the losses. I was upset that katniss couldn't pull herself together and be the strong character that would sacrifice herslelf for the greater good and for those that she loved. She was suddenly portrayed as self centered and it just didn't make sense at all. The girl that would give her life for her sister or to make a political statement that \\"this is wrong\\" or to try and save others, suddenly she is nothing to me and I don't care weather she lives or dies or if she is happy or not.<br /><br />War is awful. Many people are losing family and friends to war as I am writing this. People lose loved ones every day. Parents, brothers, sisters, children, friends, and lovers. It's sad but it is life. I've watched people lose loved ones and become stronger. There are people who fall apart and have to pick up the pieces, but after 5, 10, 15 years you would think there should be a spark of happiness. The writer didn't even show an undertone of happiness or joy. She mearly painted a picture of someone who barely existed after the horrific events.<br /><br />Through all of this, if the author had at least written with the same details and flow of events that she god on the first two books it could've been so much better. I am so tired of being dissapointed at the end of movies or books, feeling like something is missing, like some huge detail is hanging in the balance waiting to be revealed.
B0067RQYNW|1.0|I had great hopes for this app.  I do a lot of spreadsheet work, using a standard template with calculated formulae for building a bill of materials for my job.  I expected - based on the promotional marketing and the samples included with the Kingsoft Office application - to be able to edit the spreadsheets, including changing quantities, prices, adding or deleting rows, etc.  In a word, nope.<br />A brief list of the things you can't do with this app:<br />- Copy or paste<br />- change fonts<br />- update calculated values (editing a cell and then saving the spreadsheet results in the spreadsheet being saved with non-computed values and errors which then have to be corrected on your computer)<br />- create graphs<br />- edit or add any calculated cell (Kingsoft does not recognize formulae).<br /><br />In summary, if you want to only READ your spreadsheets and graphs, this will work.  If you want to actually DO work, forget it, find another application.  Why would anyone release garbage like this?

B004SRPXWQ|1.0|I have an iPhone and loaded the talking Dodo bird on it because my 3 year old lives it. I got tired of him constantly getting my phone, so I bought him an Android Tablet for Christmas so he had his own device and could play with it anytime he wanted. Yes, he's an only child, and he is spoiled, and many adults don't have a tablet, but I found a great price (here on Amazon) and got it for him. Since the tablet has Android as the operating system, some apps available on Apple products aren't compatible with other OS'. I saw Talking Tom Cat and it basically did the same thing as Dodo bird. I got the app loaded, opened it, and the cat started to repeat anything my son said. After about 5 minutes it freezes and makes a continous white noise/static sound. The app wouldn't close, I couldn't turn the tablet off, even the reset button wouldn't unfreeze the app. I had to wait for the battery to run completely down to get it to stop. So I uninstall the app, reinstall it, and once again it works for about 5 minutes then freezes. After the 3rd time doing to uninstall/reinstall, I didn't load it again.<br /><br />If you aren't familiar with this app or Dodo bird, you talk to the character on the screen and they repeat everything you say in an \\"Alvin and the Chipmunks\\" type voice. You can also interact with it and run your fingers up and down Tom Cat's belly and he purrs. If they would get the bugs fixed it would be a great app, but even being free I still felt over charged because of all the time and headaches it caused me trying to fix it, as well as an impatient 3 year old not understanding why it's broke. Don't waste your time.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|First off. I love my Kindle and I love the convenience of not having to store books on my bookshelf when I'm done reading them. The fact that the publisher has set the 'digital' version of this to cost roughly 30% more than the printed version astounds me. Really? There is little to no production cost involved. Certainly less than required for a printed distribution of the books, so what gives? How does this make any sense?<br /><br />Was looking forward to reading them, but until someone smacks some sense into the publisher, I'll spend my money on another author. Sorry George, get your publisher in gear.
0307719219|3.0|I was not overly impressed by this book. The authors' writing style needs work, and their main argument is too simplistic: nations fail because of bad political and economic institutions, which are due to history.<br /><br />On a basic level, their thesis is right: a society that serves a narrow elite's interests will never achieve the same prosperity that a broad-based, inclusive society and economic system will. Politics matters for economic outcomes. The United States and Great Britain are cited as success stories, while many Latin American countries are apparently abject failures.<br /><br />This, the authors claim, is largely because of their institutional histories. Peru and Bolivia, for instance, suffered from the mining mita, a forced labour system Spanish conquistadors used to exploit the indigenous population. Meanwhile, the American colony of Jamestown experimented with and prospered under democracy and property rights. These early histories created persistence up until today.<br /><br />Yet Acemoglu and Robinson mask the fact that the Jamestown colony was also exploitative, albeit in a different way. The colony was founded within Powhatan Confederacy borders, without the indigenous people's permission - property rights were certainly violated. Skirmishes often broke out with the natives, and further North American colonization would rely on this \\"killing the Indians\\" model.<br /><br />Exploitation and oppression are necessary for nations to succeed. The authors, however, do not categorize what type of oppression is required. Instead, they simply consider all oppression bad, ignoring the cruel subtleties of history. The mita was terrible, but the genocide of North American natives to clear the land for white settlers was no better. Institutions matter, yet many successful ones are plagued by an evil past.<br /><br />The intricacies of international relations are also neglected by Acemoglu and Robinson. The reason Latin America is so poor today is not dueto colonial history, but recent U.S. foreign policy. It is no secret that the United States supported dictators like Batista (Cuba), Banzer (Bolivia), and Armas (Guatemala), so that American corporations could prosper in Latin America. A similar argument applies to Africa and the Middle East.<br /><br />If we take Acemoglu and Robinson's argument to its logical extreme, then we can think of the world as a failed nation. The elite (OECD countries) create extractive institutions that exploit the poor in Africa, Latin America, The Middle East and Asia. Indeed the United States still supports dictatorships in Saudi Arabia and Jordan, and until recently supported Hosni Mubarak's reign in Egypt.<br /><br />If Acemoglu and Robinson had a better grasp of history and international politics, then perhaps Why Nations Fail would be a more informative read.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Look folks, this is a GREAT movie despite what about half the critics (who obviously don't understand the genre of Planetary Romance) have said.  My 9-year-old grandson was willing to go to the theater and see this movie THREE times and said it's like Star Wars (which he loves) and he even likes to hear the music alone because he loves the movie so much.<br /><br />PLEASE, give it a chance, because this movie deserves at least one sequel, if not two!!  I've seen it 9 times at the theater and it gets better with repeated viewings!<br /><br />Go see it now and buy the Blu-Ray and DVD when it comes out so Disney will know that this is a potential goldmine series!<br /><br />Thanks for your time!

1609611543|3.0|My husband and I have been following this plan after reading this book for about three weeks now. So far, so good. My husband lost nine pounds in the first ten days. I have lost about three so far, but I am confident based on past experience that this approach will lead to more serious weight loss. The book was thorough and an interesting enough read, but certainly redundant, and could easily have been decreased to half the length. The thing that is SO striking to me, and which made me feel compelled to post, is how absolutely disgusting, revolting, and ridiculous the recipes in this book are! I mean, come on! Has this guy ever tasted good food? I admit, the more important point here is that it may very well be an effective weight loss tool. Sure. But buddy, please don't bother including these vile, nasty recipes. I made a handful of them, and each of them was absolutely awful and a waste of time, money, ingredients, etc. I am writing this after eating the cauliflower crust \\"pizza.\\" My husband and I laughed as we choked it down. If you want MUCH better wheat free recipes, try Elanas Pantry. If you are buying this book, don't waste your time on the recipes. Unless of course you enjoy eating slop.
B004ZN9YNC|5.0|I must admit that when I first purchased this Album on vinyl almost 20 years ago... I did not \\"get\\" this album.

And...they finally included When the Tigers Broke Free!
B00000IMTF|5.0|Rainbow  \\"Rising\\"  #48  (1976).<br /><br />1976's \\"\\"Rising\\", is a major keeper in the hard rock hall of fame.  Ritchie put together a new band on this album, keeping vocalist Ronnie James Dio, but adding Jimmy Bain on bass, Tony Carey on keyboards and Cozy Powell on drums.  Since this release Tony had several hits in the 80's solo and his band Planet P Project, Tony's most famous album is \\"Some Tough City\\", in 1984, my favorite song of his, is the 1983 song \\"I Won't Be Home Tonight\\", which reached In the mid 70's on the hot 100 chart.  Jimmy went on to work with many rock acts like, Phil Lynott ,Thin Lizzy, Dio and his band Wild Horses, which he partnered with Brian Robertson (Thin Lizzy,Motorhead), they released only one album \\"Stand Your Ground\\".  Cozy Powell who really did it all with a smash hit in 1974 \\"Dance With the Devil\\" top 10 english charts and #49 on the hot 100.  Cozy worked with many rock acts after Rainbow like, Blue Murder, Black Sabbath, Whitesnake, Michael Schenker Group and Emerson Lake And Powell, Cozy died in 1998 at the age of 50 in a car wreck.  Back to this album, it opens up with the keyboard drenched \\"Tarot Woman\\", good stuff by Tony Carey here.  Dio  shines on \\"Run With The Wolf\\", \\"Starstruck\\", is simply amazing, Ritchie putting out some great riffs here, the rousing \\"Do You Close Your Eyes\\", \\"Stargazer\\", is an epic number, everybody shines here and it closes with \\"A Light In The Black\\", just strong material throughout.  They fell off a bit on 1978's \\"Long Live Rock \\"N' Roll\\".
B005AFB69E|5.0|This review is for the Hong Kong import Blu-ray of LADYHAWKE.  Although I procured my copy from a source other than Amazon, I thought I'd still chime in with my opinion here.  Bottom line -- if you are a fan of this film, it is absolutely worth the cost, and the wait for your import copy to arrive from overseas, to get this disc.  LADYHAWKE looks fabulous on Blu-ray, the best I've ever seen it since I missed it on its original theatrical release.  I think I must have discovered it in college on home video after I became a Michelle Pfeiffer fan.<br /><br />The colors on this disc are rich and detailed and the picture is about as sharp as you could ask for, even on my 720p display (I imagine it would look even better in 1080p).  A huge THANK YOU to 20th Century Fox for making this an all-region disc, even though I had to import it.  The only downside is a lack of special features.  To Warner Bros., holder of the North American rights, NOW will you get off your collective duffs and make a proper special edition?!?  I'd still buy that if you released it .... but hurry up, 'cause Richard Donner isn't getting any younger ....
B00000IMTE|4.0|Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow  #30  (1975).<br /><br />Ritchie Blackmore had just left Deep Purple in 1974 and formed his new band with New York rockers Elf.  Elf was led by vocalist Ronnie James Dio, drummer Gary Driscoll, bassist Craig Gruber and keyboardist Micky Lee Soule.  Since this album Ronnie James has passed away from cancer in 2011, Driscoll was murdered in 1987, Gruber had worked with Driscoll on two albums in the 80's with the band Bible Black, and worked with Gary Moore on \\"We Want Moore\\", Soule has been a keyboard tech with Deep Purple a few times and most recently worked with Ian Gillan on \\"Gillan's Inn\\" (2006), a very good album.  This album was produced by the legendary Martin Birch.  Back to this album, Ritchie comes out fighting with \\"Man On The Silver Mountain\\", a classic hard rock staple.  The Yardbird remake \\"Still I'm Sad\\", a very strong remake, the galloping \\"Sixteenth Century Greensleeves\\". the boogie of  \\"If You Don't Like Rock N Roll\\", which reminds me of B.T.O., the mellow-rock of \\"Catch The Rainbow\\" and \\"Self Portrait\\", with a kind of a depressed message.  1976 gave us a lot better album in \\"Rising\\".  But this isn't bad.

0439023521|5.0|If you're familiar with Maslov's hierarchy of needs, you'll find the Hunger Games to be a fascinating study of the differing mindsets of people who are not on the same rung of that ladder.  If not, you may be familiar with futuristic dystopias, and will find it's take on love among the ruins an interesting angle to the genre.  Everyone else will find immersion in the mindset of raw survival and starvation somewhat shocking, unless you've been there.  It's not the darkest dystopia I've read, but it has the most inequality, which makes for a stunningly current read for our times.<br /><br />Obviously, a lot of people have read the Hunger Games, or it wouldn't be getting made into a movie.  I found it to be a compelling read, able to interest me and hook me into the story from the first page to the last, so its popularity is hardly surprising.  In fact, this is the only first book of a trilogy I've ever read that didn't wrap things up at the end neatly enough that it could stand alone in case the sequels went unpublished.  I was left hanging, in suspense, and must now read the rest of the series.  Also, I really liked that the main character was a girl who is good at archery, my favorite kind of hero.

0783229372|4.0|Why is this movie not available in Blu-Ray?  The DVD is only standard definition 480i.  If a Blu-Ray edition is not to be made available please at least update the DVD to \\"anamorphic\\", \\"enhanced for widescreen tv\\" so that it can be played on an upscaling DVD player to \\"near 1080p\\" in it's proper widescreen format without having to make adjustments to DVD and/or TV settings. Yes, the movie is mostly fiction with the true story of \\"The Hindenburg\\" only as a backdrop, but I do find it entertaining and George C. Scott is always good.

B001DK4IF4|5.0|Many people do not care for colorized versions of Black and white movies but  the colorization of  this  classic movie is  so good that one would swear that it was filmed in  Color.<br />There is a richness  to it that is  lacking in the original. I was  glad to be able to buy a  copy through the Amazon Marketplace.
B0077QS9C6|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie, it was a great tribute to one of the all-time best drivers in Formula One.  I chose to try it in HD for a price that was $1 higher than the standard def version, and that was a mistake.  I assumed that the footage would have originally been filmed and that a HD copy would be better quality than standard def, however it was apparently all or nearly all taken from standard def TV broadcasts, and thus the original was not capable of even DVD quality.  Also, there were several minutes at the end of the movie without any audio, and that was without any explanation.<br /><br />Overall, this is a must see for Formula One fans, but save the extra dollar and watch it in standard def.

B00005N6KG|1.0|I was leery after reading reviews that they break after a few months of every day use, but for the price, I bought them anyways.  I used to own a Sony yellow pair of headphones just like this, they worked AWESOME for about 12 yrs. then broke this past summer.  As a runner, I loved them because they were light, small, and didn't fall out of my ears like those retched ear buds.  I wanted something similar.  Unfortunately Sony makes crap now, and this pair I bought just stopped working 5 months later after using them 4-5 days a week for about 30-60 minutes each day.  I'm so disappointed I can't find a pair of headphones just like these that actually work for a few years.
B00756GKBA|4.0|I suspect that had someone else released this album, it would be getting better reviews than I've seen so far for Madonna. If this were Lady Gaga's follow up to Born This Way, for example, I think it would be praised for pushing dance-pop in a very interesting direction. Madonna, however, has Madonna to contend with. Her long history and tremendous number of hit songs and classic albums means that she's no longer competing with the new generation: she'll always have herself to be compared to, and that's hard to live up to.<br /><br />There are two problems with this album: First, Madonna's voice isn't quite what it once was. It's more polished, for sure, which has been true since Evita, but especially since Ray of Light. In and of itself, that's not so bad, but it's also just not as powerful. It's not just polished--it's too precise, which gives the album a calculated feel, something that's affected Madonna's albums in the past as well. I think this album is most similar to Erotica, but only Masterpiece comes close to comparing with Rain or Bad Girl when it comes to the kind of vocals Madonna is (or was) capable of.<br /><br />The other issue is that the wrong songs have been the public face of the album. Give Me All Your Luvin' and Girl Gone Wild simply are not the best songs here, and it does a disservice to the rest of the album to have released them as the first singles. (Not only that, but some of the best songs are relegated to the second disc, which makes the deluxe edition significantly better than the single-disc version.)<br /><br />Instead, look at Some Girls. Some Girls is a great song. It easily holds its own next to similar Madonna songs like Beautiful Stranger or Amazing. I'm a Sinner is one of those powerful yet melodic dance-rockers that Madonna has perfected. Throughout MDNA, the beats thump and pulse mightily, guest rappers come along to praise the \\"queen,\\" and there are enough production tricks to keep our ears occupied for ages.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a very solid album. Hard Candy had some good songs on it, but it was perhaps a bit too uneven. I don't think this will replace Confessions on a Dance Floor as the best of Madonna's current era, but it's a great addition to an extraordinary career.ll, I think this is a very solid album.

0241951453|4.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's, by Truman Capote is a novel that every college student can compare to. Capote does a wonderful job of characterization, especially in Holly Golightly, and the message that each character is meant to convey. I love this story for many reasons but one is simply the character Holly Golightly.  Being a current college student and a female, there is a lot to be comparable to Holly. She has major issues of the need to be independent, never truly feeling safe to rely on someone and the how difficult it is for her to talk about personal things. `Her cheek came to rest against my shoulder, a warm damp weight. \\"Why are you crying?\\" She sprang back, sat up. \\"Oh, for God's sake,\\" she said, starting for the window and the fire escape, \\"I hate snoops.\\" This book also has fantastic symbols that strengthen the novel. Capote has Holly wearing sunglasses most of the time. This again strengthens the idea that she dislikes people getting close to her and seeing who she truly is and her past. The novel is classified as a classic for a reason. Breakfast at Tiffany's is a must read for everyone of any age. Anyone going through a time in their life of making decisions, finding who you truly are or have general issues of trusting people and getting close to them, this read is perfect.
1594744769|4.0|I'm not sure what I expected from this book, but it was nothing what I thought it would be. But with that said, I still really enjoyed the book! I thought it was going to be creepier just by judging it by the cover and a quick flip through, but it really is just a \\"peculiar\\" story. It keeps you turning the pages and wondering what's going to happen to Jacob and his new friends with peculiar talents. The antique photos pepppered throughout the book really add a lot of dimension to the story. I'm not sure how this would translate onto a Kindle, I read the physical book.

I suppose close-minded \\"fans\\" will be left in the dust, but people willing to change with her will be rewarded by what I think is her best album in many years.<br /><br />A good album is a good album no matter who the artist is.  But \\"fans\\" upset that an artist doesn't continue to put out albums that sound like their past work are, frankly, living in the past, and really, missing the point entirely I think.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The book was entertaining, but I won't be purchasing book 2. I don't think I could stand reading the word \\"clamber\\" even just one more time. For all the clambering they did I'm surprised they were even able to have sex without falling all over each other. And for a virgin who has never even masturbated, I find it hard to believe that she immediately and every time experienced multiple orgasms. A lot of us females would like to know her secret.

145162445X|5.0|I am definitely not a scientist, but I understand that the scientific method should be used to explain our universe or universes. Professor Lawrence Krauss does a very good job explaining, \\"why there is something rather than nothing.\\"  There is stuff coming in and out of existence apparently from nothing and perhaps this phenomenon is the reason for the stuff that is in the universe or universes. For every thing we observe from the very big to the very small. For space and time. The fluctuation of the particles is our reality. We are what we are because of the very small, not the other way around.<br /><br />Professor David Albert says, in his New York Times review, that Professor Kraus is \\"dead wrong and his religious and philosophical critics are absolutely right.\\" Are they right about their \\"idealized nothing\\"? It seems to me that religion cannot explain the phenomenon of the universe scientifically.  As Professor Krauss says, religion and theology, \\"...often muddy the waters...by focusing on questions of nothingness without providing any definition of the term based on empirical evidence.\\"  Professor Albert says,\\"...all that gets offered to us now, by guys like these is...the nerdy accusation that religion is, I don't know, dumb\\". No Professor Albert not dumb but, IRRELEVANT.<br /><br />I recommend that those that are non-scientist like me, read Professor Lawrence Krauss book, \\"A Universe from Nothing\\"

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Owen Wilson plays amiable Gil, a self admitted \\"Hollywood hack\\" script writer from Beverly Hills. He has a fiance so Malibu Barbie you can easily imagine a product number on the bottom of her foot, a pair of irritable, materialistic, Republican in-laws, and a novel he is having difficulty translating from thoughts to paper.<br />Gil is thrilled to be in Paris, where his father-in-law is making a nondescript business deal, and is expressing this by immersing himself in the locations and stories of writers, artists, and musicians long gone, while his fiance gripes about how charming the streets are. Friends of his wife arrive seemingly by surprise, a patronizing \\"intellectual\\" who collects facts only to impress other people with them and his oblivious wife. Gil finds them overbearing but his wife is charmed, and the group separates. On his way back to the hotel, Gil gets himself hopelessly lost, as predicted by his wife, but instead of panicking, he sits down on some steps and listens to the clock chime at midnight. A car manufactured almost a century ago rolls around the corner, and Gil is invited in by a group of strangers wreathed in smoke and laden with champagne glasses. Much in the same way Alice falls down a rabbit hole and discovers herself in Wonderland, Gil realizes he has been transported to the 1920's, and the handful of journeys he takes there are parallel to hers. Each night he enters the car, someone new is there to greet him, from Scott Fitzgerald to Hemingway to T.S. Eliot, Gil bounces like a ping pong ball from one long gone idol to the next, going to drink, going to dance, going to get help with his novel from Gertrude Stein.<br /><br />This is a simple movie that doesn't bother to explain just how Gil gets to the 1920's because it isn't necessary to know, and even if we did know it wouldn't have any bearing on the story. It is never implied that Gil might be hallucinating or dreaming; and we are pleased about this, because we like Gil, we are like Gil, we understand.<br />The message is straightforward \\"Enjoy what you have and don't dwell on or in the past because even the past thinks the past is better\\" (indeed of course we would all like to live in the past because we are already aware of what was good and what was bad there, while in the present hardly anyone knows what is going on or if where they are is the best place they could be), and actually established fairly early, but it's a raving blast to get there.Gil, we understand.<br />The message is straightforward \\"Enjoy what you have and don't dwell on or in the past because even the past thinks the past is better\\" (indeed of course we would all like to live in the past because we are already aware of what was good and what was bad there, while in the present hardly anyone knows what is going on or if where they are is the best place they could be), and actually established fairly early, but it's a raving blast to get there.

The game may be played without a brain by systematically tapping on pairs, which is be quite tedious but the one function where it challenges you to find the pair that creates the requested new element can give a challenge.  I've made about 120 pairups so far and no forcequit on my Kindle Fire so I THINK the bug that caused that has been fixed.
B00756GKBA|3.0|I've listened to the new Madonna today and it's what I pretty much expected. I can be harsh sometimes in my reviews but half of me liked this album and the other half was just like EH.... But since it's madonna I have to be harsher cause I expected a bit more talent out of her instead we got a album that half was trying to reach the 12-16 year olds and the other half trying to keep her long time older fans. I wish she would get past the whole...\\"let me work with whoever is popular now\\"... to keep 'THEIR\\" fan base instead of just doing it herself. I think on some tracks she really tried. I also must say I 'HATE' HATE HATE her last single..\\"gimme all your lovin\\" I cringe everytime I hear that song. The latest single was a bit more sophomore and less juvenile. Surprisingly the song I liked is the rap one cause it was different for her since the rap on vogue and american life. It started to get better by track ten, eleven and twelve. That's where I found the selections to be a bit more adult friendly and not \\"teeny bop\\" sounding. This album sounds alot like her cd's \\"music and american life\\" rolled into one with a few tracks that sounded like she actually worked on them thrown in the mix. I'm still waiting for the 'OLDER' madonna to put out that masterpeice since \\"like a prayer\\" or \\"ray of light\\".
B00756GKBA|1.0|As a Madonna's fan I must say the truth:this is a horrible album!!<br />I can't believe this is the best she can do after preparing such a long time!!<br />Total rubbish so disappointing,please don't buy it.
0545265355|5.0|Awesome series, the box set is great because I had all the books ready once I finished the preceding one.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I place the blame on hobbits and boy wizards, but I have never been a fan of any book that classifies itself as \\"fantasy.\\" Oh sure, I can and do enjoy urban fantasies featuring vampires, werewolves and the like ... but toss in hobbits with the details of all their many meals during the day and boy wizards who you know in advance will be standing by the time the book or series comes to an end, and I run the opposite way with all possible haste.<br /><br />That was before I was introduced to George R.R. Martin and the world of Westeros.<br /><br />Frankly, I had never heard of Martin nor his books before a friend encouraged me to watch the HBO production of A Game of Thrones. I'm still trying to figure out why the series clicked with me, but it did. So, too, did the first book in the series. I managed to read through the book in a week, something that I can rarely do with an 800-plus page book. By the time I finished, my preconceptions about fantasy novels had been shattered. I've even jumped straight into the second book of the series, so anixous to continue the plot threads of so many richly drawn characters laid out in the opening book of the series.<br /><br />To be sure, there are some fantasy elements to the book such as references to dragons, white walkers (who seem to be a bit like vampires) and the Little People of the Forest (perhaps the faerie folk?). But the emphasis is on the human characters. These aren't the type of characters you can group into Good and Evil camps. The best and most noble of characters can do bad things and the worst characters can surprise you by doing the right things sometimes. These are fully realized human characters in all their glorious shades of gray.<br /><br />It often seems that the \\"magic\\" overshadows the human elements in fantasies, but in A Game of Thrones it seems this \\"rule\\" has been turned on its head. There are no hair-breadth escapes with the aid of a magic wand or an incantation. Swords don't glow with magical intent. The people of the north may still go to sacred groves to talk to their gods, but if the gods choose to answer it is not with any sort of human voice. In other words, the tale holds together on a rational level without resorting to supernatural intervention.<br /><br />Even though some plot points may require a leap of faith, I found myself willing to make that leap with Martin and his characters. Oh sure, there are elements I still scratch my head over, like how winter can be brief or last for a decade or how the humans can trace their history back thousands of years but seem to progress so slowly when it comes to technology and innovation. Perhaps these questions will be answered later in the series, but for now I'm intent to experience Westeros as Martin intended it.<br /><br />Perhaps there will come a time as I read further into the series when I come to a point and say \\"Oh, that's preposterous!\\" and put the series down never to return. But for now I've gone farther than I ever imagined I would with the series and hope to go even further. What I do know is that if all \\"fantasies\\" were this detailed and grounded in a more real world, I would have been a fan long ago.t.

B003ZSJ212|3.0|Being that this is a Blu-ray set, I was expecting beautiful picture and sound.  However, when I started watching Episode 1, I was extremely disappointed.  I had to turn up my sound system to the same sound level as when I watch DVDs.  The picture quality was no different from the DVD version either.  I seems like Lucas just took the DVD versions and copied them onto Blu-ray.  I am very disappointed in this \\"Blu-ray\\" set.  The only reason that I am giving these movies a 3 star rating is because it is Star Wars, but as far as an improvement over DVD, Lucas has jipped us.

B00466HN6S|4.0|Saw this with my youngest 5 kids, ages 8 to 12 at the time, and I only went because they insisted. I'm glad I did. It was funny, it moved along well, the humans were silly but not brainless and the animated characters were a visual treat.<br /><br />The basic themes of youthful rebellion and finding one's place in life, were well done and the sentimentality was just right for children. I will be buying the dvd because it's worth watching again at home.
B0061QD88S|5.0|I bought this movie for myself even though I'm way past the target audience. I always enjoyed watching on Sunday nights the Wonderful World of Disney and all his \\"old\\" movies are just wonderful. The \\"new\\" Disney movies are also good but having grown up with the old versions it is pure nostalgia to pop this into your DVR and feel like a kid all over again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After seeing all the hype of the news and other programs, I finally caved and HAD to see what the big deal was. This book was GREAT. I could not put it down. Ms. James creates a web for two people that leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat and turning the pages as fast as you can to see what is going to happen next.<br /><br />I've already ordered book two and can't wait to start reading it as well. I'm hoping it's as great as the first one.
B000KJU1MS|5.0|When they started no one was sure if they were crazy or what! Best part is on disk 1; seeing Gene Simmons appear on the Mike Douglas Show. An impossibly tall and skinny scarecrow dressed so black he seems to be a black hole sucking in all the light. He doesn't even seem like a person, more like a goth muppet designed by Tim Burton. These guys were like some performance art from Burning Man way before anyone even grasped such alien ideas. Genius. Pure, high energy, insane, ultra-rock theater art. You have to see this to understand how they created a whole new kind of Rock and Roll - Shock Rock, Heavy Metal. Genius. They were either going to change the world forever, or completely bomb.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Updated on August 28,2012<br />I have a lot of apps on my Transformer Prime with ICS. Folder Organizer works for me on ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich). Folder Organizer saves me time when I try to locate and load apps. I like having separate folders on my desktop for labelled groups, such as: Network, Tools, Office, Internet, and of course Games. I also have folders within folders. This makes it quick and easy to find apps when I need them.<br />I have to agree that this app does take a few times to get used to the way that it works (Mistakes will be made when learning). I also think that there could be better instructions to help people get acquainted with this app.<br />I think that this app is essential for people with a lot of apps.<br />I like the fact that if I long press an app icon in a folder, I have the option to uninstall the app (as well as other options). This saves me time when \\"housekeeping\\".<br />IMPORTANT: Folder Organizer has the option to \\"Download labels\\". It also has the setting (in \\"Preferences\\") to \\"Download label on new app\\". With these options checked, Folder Organizer will automatically arrange your apps into folders with labels. These can be an extremely helpful options for new users and others who don't like to make their own custom arrangement (This can make Folder Organizer much easier to use). These options can cause you grief, if you have your own labels (You spent time creating your own label system, then told the app to arrange according to the built in system, then wonder where your apps went). These options were turned on by default with one of the upgrades. I prefer using my own labels for folders, so I have these items unchecked. After updating, I make sure that these items are still unchecked.<br />I use \\"Icon App 2 Folder Organizer\\" and \\"Icon App 4 Folder Organizer\\" as resources for my icons (These are available (paid) here in the app store). I like these 2 collections. I just wish Folder Organizer made it easier to locate these collections. I have to scroll through my list of apps to locate the packs for each icon that I wish to set (OK, I have a lot of apps). I would like this to be a direct link under \\"Select Icons\\".<br /><br />There are a few items (mentioned by other reviewers) that I would like to address.<br />Icon size:<br />There are 2 widgets each for \\"FO Folder link\\" and \\"FO item\\". One of the choices in each category has a larger looking icon than the other. I think it is the small icon is the first widget, and the larger one is second widget.<br />Pinging or license check:<br />I frequently use my tablet off-line, so I know that Folder Organizer does not have to ping or do a license check every time you use it.<br />Speed:<br />I have not compared this version to the Google version (Why pay twice. This is the paid version). I have noticed that Folder Organizer does run a little bit more slowly for me when I have many apps installed. It does run more quickly when I only have a couple hundred apps installed. This can be due to the system and not the Folder Organizer app as I have heard that android can slow down when a large number of apps is installed. It is easy to end up with a large number of apps on your system because Folder Organizer makes it easy to sort and locate a large number of apps. (No, I'm not going to tell you the exact number of apps that I have installed, but I do get \\"Reminded\\" of the memory limits of android. It only takes 2 or 3 clicks to launch any app.)<br />A large number of icons and widgets on the screen can also slow the system down somewhat. I guess you could blame Folder Organizer for this, because with this app, it is too easy to load up the screen (It is also fun).<br />One of the reviewers stated that he had no other apps running. I have to ask: are you sure? It is not enough to just clear your recent tasks list. Check \\"Settings\\",\\"Apps\\",\\"RUNNING\\", and you might be surprised. (Don't mess with this unless you're sure.) Some apps stay running here, even after you might think you closed the app. This is even true with some popular apps, such as PicsArt which stays running here. This does not cover all of the processes that may be running.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Folder Organizer is an extremely helpful app.<br />After using it for a while, I would be lost without this app.<br />I highly recommend this for anyone who is willing to spend a little time, and make a few mistakes learning this app.<br />Of course, you could just set to automatic as mentioned above.<br /><br />Update on June 13, 2014:<br />Since my original review, I have set-up other tablets (for myself and for other people).<br />I find Folder Organizer to be indispensable.<br />I can have a consistent look and feel with all my tablets.<br />Other people like this app (once it is set up for them).<br />Some of my tablets have Kit Kat, so I know this works on newer versions of android.<br />One of my favorite features is the ability to uninstall apps with folder organizer.<br />Long press on an app icon and you get a menu to uninstall an app (as well as other options) (the app needs to be in a folder to do this}.<br />This is a nice way to remove apps that I no longer need (or was trying out and did not like).<br />I still use this app, I still like this app, and I think that the current price of this app makes it a bargain.

I read this book with butterflies, waiting, much like the narrator, for something to go wrong, waiting for Victoria to destroy her own happiness.  The language of flowers weaves a wonderful thread through the story, emphasizing her inability to relate and communicate with people because of her childhood.

B0002KQNZO|3.0|It's easy to be a completist where Art Blakey's music is concerned.  The percussionist was such a force of nature that \\"Blakey reunion bands\\" simply can not approach the power, energy and drive that Bu, only, was capable of.  But of the 50+ recordings that I've collected by him, the ones from the '60s and '80s receive a lot less attention than the music from the '50s and the '70's.<br /><br />Little American music can compare with the Blakey '50s albums.  The genius of Clifford Brown sparkles thoughout the two sets recorded in Birdland, and \\"Art Blakey and the Jazz Messenger\\" (on Columbia, not Blue Note) exhibits Horace Silver at his very peak as a composer (\\"Nica's Dream\\") and arranger (\\"Ecaroh\\").  Additionally, the horns of Hank Mobley and Donald Byrd are incessantly tasteful, complementary, and melodic--every inspired note has a purpose, every solo is structured to yield a musical result.<br /><br />The '70s were tough times for Art, but he produced some amazing music, thanks to the advanced, challenging compositions of Walter Davis, Jr. and the mixing  of new blood (tenor saxophonist Dave Schntter, who would have the longest tenure as a tenor player with Art) and the deceptively pyrotechnical Bill Hardman (a trumpeter who, in addition to being a Messenger in three different decades, was game for a cutting contest with Freddie, or whomever, whenever the occasion arose).<br /><br />I'm aware that this particular album has been singled out by some major, recognizable names in jazz as a personal favorite.  But at the same time it's easy to forget that busy woodshedding musicians don't necessarily have the time to collect and listen to as much music as, say, a Blakey \\"completist.\\"  The '60s' bands with Shorter, Hubbard (sometimes Lee Morgan), and Fuller were capable of much lightning and thunder, but after a while they pale alongside the musicianship of the earlier '50s recordings and the adventurous overachievers of the '70s.  There's plenty of thunder and lightning but, upon close, repeated listening, there's more smoke than fire on the '60s' sextet recordings, of which \\"Free for All\\" is a prime example.<br /><br />Listen, for example, to the title song and each soloist's attempt to \\"stir it up\\" on the tune's single tone center for the duration of the solo.  Shorter is reduced to meaningless and repeated scale patterns and even curious trills as though he were looking at the seconds remaining before he can give way to Hubbard.  Freddie puts on his usual spectacular demonstration, again more intent on merely creating \\"excitement,\\" or manufactured sound and intensity rather than meaningful music.  Fuller, as is quite often the case on his sessions with Blakey, is the weak link in the frontline of solos.<br /><br />Blakey collectors--like collectors of Ellington's vast repertory--are bound to disagree about which is the best, or most representative, Blakey album.  I would in a heartbeat give away \\"Free for All\\" before letting go of a number of \\"live\\" 2-disc volumes--[[ASIN:B00005MIZ8 A Night at Birdland, Vol. 1]] with Clifford motivated to \\"let it all out\\" along with the announcements of Pee Wee Marquette and Art himself (dig his explanation of his role as an onlooker to Dizzy's composing of \\"Night in Tunisia\\"): [[ASIN:B002HJ5X2C At Jazz Corner of World Vo]] At the Jazz Corner of the World\\" (Morgan and Mobley, a match made in heaven; [[ASIN:B00005UMTX Meet You at the Jazz Corner of the World]] (Morgan and Shorter--Wayne is the creative thinker, working with the musical idea, or motif; Mobley is always the \\"singer,\\" playing from the heart while favoring long and lyrical lines, or melodies, over creative \\"ideas,\\" or motifs); last, [[ASIN:B00074C660 At Cafe Bohemia]] Dorham and Mobley, as with Lee and Donald Byrd, Hank's musical partnership with K.D. is telepathic).  Each of the foregoing places the listener in in front of the bandstand, with Art himself (esp. at the Cafe Bohemia) inviting the audience to take off their shoes, kickup their feet, and swing in their seats for an entire night's worth of exciting, inventive, passionate, often explosive, music.<br /><br />I agree that \\"Free for All\\" belongs in the collection of any Blakey follower, representing Art's \\"hard boppish\\" version of the modal music that proved so successful for Miles on the immortal \\"Kind of Blue\\" session.  Moreover, for those of us who prefer more chords and melody, \\"Free for All\\" has a welcome change of pace in the form of \\"Pensativa,\\" the jazz standard by the late Clare Fischer. (In that respect, \\"Free for All\\" resembles Miles' programming, for \\"Kind of Blue,\\" of \\"Freddie Freeloader,\\" a finger-snapping blues, inserted for the sake of variety in the otherwise concentrated playing of the modal tracks.  But overall the album did not live up to its advance billing for at least this listener (Later qualifier: mine is quite obviously a minority report.  As one commenter said, \\"It was my entrance into Blakey's music.\\"  Frankly, I think my own son might have the same response.

Of course not.  But if Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga can make music together (which they do, and with credibility), then it's certainly possible for listeners and musicians to get a foot planted in both worlds.  Coltrane started in the Songbook, and when he ventured away from it, his new modal approach was directly influenced by the great Broadway composer, Richard Rodgers (in fact, he continued to play Rodgers' \\"My Favorite Things\\" right up to the end of his life).  Moreover, as has been pointed out by numerous scholars and musicians,  Coltrane's revolutionary reinvention of harmonies on the seminal \\"Giant Steps\\" album follows the unusual, almost head-spinning, harmonic pattern of the bridge Richard Rodgers wrote for a tune entitled: \\"Have You Met Miss Jones?\\"<br /><br />I'll leave it there, except for calling attention to an indispensable Blakey album that tends to be overlooked simply because it was recorded on Columbia rather than Blue Note. This isn't the same as the more popular album with the same title--\\"Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers\\" (the so-called \\"Moanin'\\" date). This Columbia album spotlights Horace Silver's brilliant compositions and arrangements (\\"Nica's Dream,\\" \\"Ecarole\\") along with Hank Mobley, Donald Byrd, and Doug Watkins.

Their recordings, all made offshore, are scarce and often hard to find, but this one DVD, recorded with the Messengers performing in the streets and under a high sun in an Italian village for the Umbria Jazz Festival, does justice by both Art's mainstream emissaries and the visionary compositions of his chief composer-arranger, Walter Davis, Jr.: [[ASIN:B00008G8H3 Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers]]for an entire night's worth of exciting, inventive, passionate, often explosive, music.

B006MW3VGA|2.0|The first season was a joy to watch. Everything you expect and hope for from a M/T series.<br /><br />Alas, the second season is a bit of joke. The writers appear to have run out of material, and what we get instead are moves telegraphed miles in advance and plot developments so old they have greybeards.<br /><br />Case in point: as soon as Mr. Bates says (once again), \\"It's all going to be good from here on\\" --  cue the nasty Mrs. Bates intervening to ruin his life yet again. This kind of thing happens over and over.<br /><br />But this is a relatively small quibble in a terrible season. My favorite is when the when the young captain returns form the trenches paralyzed from the waist down. I remember thinking this was heavy stuff - he's a regular, and watching him and the family dealing with something as profound as being confined to wheelchair with a severed spine for years is going to be a cold dash of a water for many viewers.<br /><br />But just a few episodes later...he...suddenly..(wait for it)...stands up and walks on his own. He doesn't wiggle his toes mind you. He doesn't just gradually recover the use of his legs. Now, he just stands and walks. Paralysis over. The pathetic plot explanation by the impossibly soap-opera handsome doctor complete with graying hair is that his spine was apparently not severed, it was just bruised. As are the sensibilities of any serious viewer who enjoyed the first season.<br /><br />One can only hope Season 3 recovers the marvelous tone of 1. Otherwise cross this one off your list. So much promise, so much left on the table.
3037782773|4.0|The thirty visual patterns in the book create some dazzling movement when the plastic sheet (included) of vertical lines is moved horizontally across them. I thought the best ones are the designs that don't fill the page. One called Orbit cleverly has the two rings of small squares turning in one direction with a ring of triangles inside the square rings but turning in the opposite direction. Another called DNA has a vertical collection of blobs in a tube form that turns as the plastic sheet is moved across them.<br /><br />The whole page patterns don't seem to create the same sense of motion, more a series of shapes that either come towards you are recede depending on whether the sheet is moved left or right.<br /><br />Takahiro Kurashima created the designs and they certainly are a bit of fun though Kenya Hara, on the back cover, suggests that: 'The world doesn't simply stop at the limits of our bodies but reaches inside to our very senses. Through fascinating artifice, Takahiro Kurashima's small book serves to poetically enlighten us.' Well, possibly!

If you like Hunger Games do yourself a favor and watch the original use of this story idea in the crazy but amazing movie and novel called Battle Royal.<br /><br />the funny thing is, even though it was one of the highest grossing films in Japanese history, Battle Royal was not released here due to its content not sitting well with Americans after columbine. I guess its been long enough now that movies with middle school age kids murdering each other is not just accepted but super popular.<br /><br />Do you know what they call \\"The Hunger Games\\" in Paris?

Once or twice his overuse of italic to \\"tell\\" emphasis grates, but only on rereads for me, the first time through it's too compelling to notice.<br />*Slightly predictable characters, with the exception of Shallan, who I adore. The Alethi lighteyes are like the 3-D in Clash of the Titans. They pop out against the backgrounds for Kaladin's sake, but they seem slightly grudging about it. Further, they seem as if turning them would reveal the 2D-ness, which sticks out such a beautiful backdrop.<br />*Kaladin is Uberman. Kaladin has character, sure, but it's just not deep enough for me to accept it as the best Sanderson could make for his main character. It's more like the invincible idol that is supposed to die to be revered by the real main character, who is either too shy to make an appearance in the first book, or doesn't exist. He's like the main character of a video game, as opposed to a book lead.<br />* I really hope Elhokar's character is expanded in later books, as other than Sanderson's core characters, (Jasnah, Shallan, Dalinar, Adolin, Wit, Kaladin, Renarin, Navani, Teft and Rock) No one could stand as their own person, and Elhokar is too important to be a cut-out on a stand, because if he falls over, it's gonna end badly.<br /><br />Summation: It's Sanderson's epic. His finest points are exemplified, and his shortfalls will be remedied in the second book, and if they're not, the plot is good enough not to see the faded sections in the sheet the first time you read it. I stress this, these points will only come up if you write, like me, and you read it a few times.<br />Grade: 4.5 out of 5. This book is excellent, unless you really like character-driven lit-fic. If you do, then this is not the fantasy book for you to begin with. That would be [[ASIN:0756405890 The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1)]]. However, if you like sci-fi for the plot and world, then Brandon's work will blow you away like a highstorm on a plain.
0439023521|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  It doesn't seem like a book for children to me but it was very well written.  The character development is excellent.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I did think it was brutal but extremely captivating.  I tried to explain the plot to my husband who said \\"Why would I ever want to read this book?\\"  I had to say \\"because it is so compelling.\\"  That is my best description of the plot and characters. Once you pick this book up, you won't want to put it down and you will definitely want to read all three books.
0345529057|5.0|\\"If you're going to read just one heroic fantasy in the next few years, it should be George R.R. Martin's books of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire.\\"<br /><br />The first book,\\"A Game of Thrones\\" tells an epic tale of honor and treachery, love and vengeful hatred, intrigue and heroism set in a world where summers and winters can last for years, even lifetimes. The story fashions itself concerning the family Stark, whose legacy is one of unyielding honor.  Winterfell, or House of Stark, is the cold northern kingdom of the Seven Kingdoms, where trees have faces and direwolves bond with children themselves bound to fate. Winterfell lies just south of the Wall, a 90 foot tall ice fortification that separates the Seven Kingdoms from the northern ancient forest where supernatural powers as old as the land itself are growing, presenting a greater threat than anyone can consider.<br /><br />When King Robert Baratheon's Hand dies, he makes the long journey north to ask his old friend, Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell, to become the new Hand. Ned (Eddard) Stark internally disapproves the ruling made by the man whose throne he helped win, and distrusts the queen and her entire House Lannister, but honor dictates that he complies. Bran, one of the young Stark children witnesses something he shouldn't have seen of the visiting royal family and nearly pays with his life. His grave condition makes the House Stark a family divided. Ned and his two daughters, Sansa and Arya, journey south to the House of Baratheon. Lady Catelyn stays at Winterfell with their three sons; Robb, Bran and ; and Ned's bastard son Jon Snow, unwelcome company to the Lady Stark, leaves Winterfell to take the oath of service to the Black Watch in protection of the Wall.<br /><br />Lady Catelyn receives a message from her sister who claims that her husband, the dead Hand, was murdered at the queen's orders; on the heels of that news comes a murder attempt on her recovering middle son, and a blade that implicates the queen's House of Lannister. Leaving her eldest son in charge of the keep, Catelyn travels incognito to present the blade to Eddard so that he might find the truth of the matter. On her return journey, she chances to meet the queen's younger brother, a dwarf whose weapon the blade apparently was. Catelyn seizes the Imp, taking him to her sister's stronghold built atop a sheer rock face in the mountains. Catelyn's actions set in motion wheels within already-turning wheels, and the Houses of the Seven Kingdoms will find their loyalties torn and themselves at war. In a very different land across a narrow sea, the last of the Targaryens, whose reign Robert and Eddard toppled, gathers her strength to return the House of Dragons to power in the Seven Kingdoms.<br /><br />\\"A Game of Thrones\\" easily deserves the considerable praise it has received. A huge yet surprisingly well-developed cast of characters interact in a story carefully told, weaving through plots and counterplots in the deadly quest for power. Martin's prose is gripping, pulling you quickly and fully into this world so vividly described that it almost is real. A few fairly graphic (but brief) sexual situations might cause a few readers to shy away, but these scenes maintain the story's integrity and so are non-gratuitous. \\"A Game of Thrones\\" spans a lot of pages, but is so well-written that you will find yourself too soon coming to its end and facing the fantasy reader's curse (and blessing): the eager, interminable wait to start the next book.
0439023491|4.0|I was somewhat disappointed in Catching Fire.  It seemed to be a rehash of The Hunger Games.  It was a very exciting book with the excellent character development that I had come to expect from The Hunger Games but it was much too similar.  I really did not want the characters to have to deal with another Hunger Games so quickly.  The ending was a surprise but in a good way.  I would definitely recommend this book.  The series does pull you in with an interesting plot and excellent characters.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I was so disappointed in this whole series... but as this is the last book of the series, this is the one I was the most disappointed. I kept holding out on the series thinking that it would turn out to be a good plot and read but wow was I wrong. I felt that the author left way to many questions unanswered. The writing was boring. I found myself seriously forcing myself not to start skipping pages to get through the drab. I also began to really dislike the main character which is not a good thing! The other characters I also began to dislike, the ones that I did like she killed off... :-/ I so badly wanted to like these books because I had heard so many great things about it all..  I know I'll be outnumbered on this opinion but I just really was so disappointed I felt like I should review.
B002CMXAYW|2.0|So many people have told me to watch this. I'm glad it was free (for Prime members) because I couldn't finish it... it was soooo boring! I can see how this would have been funny when it released in the 80s, but if you're watching it for the first time in 2012 it doesn't have the same oomph it apparently had back then. Maybe our moral standards have significantly declined, but the band's \\"shocking\\" behavior/thinking/etc. isn't at all shocking by today's standards. There's a scene, for instance, that I can tell is supposed to be funny wherein the record label won't release the band's new album unless the cover is changed. The \\"shocking\\" cover is just a woman with a dog collar on. (Insert yawn.)<br /><br />This is probably a great movie for fans who've been watching it since the 80s, but if you're a newbie like me... well... let's just say watch it while it's free or don't bother!
0439023521|5.0|Well written story, developed characters and interesting plot.<br /><br />Most impressively to me is the delicate way Suzanne Collins writes a very strong effeminate character in without losing her femininity and very strong masculine character in Peeta without making him \\"macho man\\". It makes the characters and the world more real and provides a wonderful balance.<br /><br />Take away the hype, the crazed young fans, the rest of the series and here you find a beautifully stylized book, well thought out plot, enjoyably flawed character and an all together interesting world. Not just an entertaining book, but a good piece of mainstream modern literature.
0671510991|3.0|Kissinger brings us through the history of the art of statecraft, indeed, an art to which he offers more than 800 detail-laden pages. Filled with meticulous references of the negotiations and policymakers that have shaped our time, the book provides a rich analysis of the manner in which diplomatic thought and practice have evolved through modern times. Kissinger chooses to frame his history around the characteristically American concept of exceptionalism, that is, the reason that us Americans always seem to feel if not better, at least uniquely different from the rest of the world. Kissinger's actual role in shaping diplomatic policy manifests itself quite clearly in the later chapters recounting the cold war, where he takes the opportunity to justify Nixon's unpopular policies. But it is in these same pages that he makes his most startling omissions: the covert wars waged in the name of anti-communism. These policies, so dear to the author himself (although frequently supported by both political parties), affected millions of individuals in dozens of countries, and could have even provided an intellectually challenging forerunner to today's post-state counterterrorism policy. Kissinger blithely dismisses this massive global outcome as inconsequential compared to the American conscience, and completely omits this fundamental part of modern history (p 472). Only a Nobel Peace Prize winner could get away with such an egregious insult.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Reading with Kindle Android app is way way better than my old monochrome keyboard Kindle.  I love having my books full screen size on my Acer tablet. Whether in landscape or even better portrait the text is crisp, sizable, easy on eyes and scrollable. Its fast and easy to resume my place in all the books I am currently reading, as well as manage my library, buy books, bookmark and highlight. Thus I have read many more books since getting this app.  By the way this Acer A500 is rock solid: sure it's heavy by ipad standards but runs all the apps I need with multitasking and long battery life.  Kindle is a wonderful app I use everyday!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I think this Bible is really handy. My father teaches a group of new believers, and being able to change to a different version to help others understand is amazing.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I gave Nikki Sixx's book 5 stars because it is definitely compelling.  The writing is honest and scary.  The set up is brave in that he got accounts from those directly in his warpath.  Very brave in deed, and a lesson that life is not a vacuum.  People touch other people.  The accounts of him in Hong Kong just before he died (for the second time) were spooky, and then the accounts of him dying were downright scary!  This is definitely a book for those wanting to find some lessons like - don't do drugs.<br /><br />I think about all the Motley records and to be honest they really weren't that great musically, but they did have passion, emotion, and a lot of attitude, which made them pretty good.  I think if Nikki Sixx had been sober he would have written the same stuff, maybe better.  We'll never know I guess.  I just think he would have been to channel his angst better.<br /><br />I do hope people don't get the wrong idea from this book - if he survived why can't I.  The question is are you willing to role the dice?  According the accounts in this book he owes a lot to chance.  That is no way to live life.  The book really gets to the heart of why he acted the way he acted, which is the most compelling part.  You could see how his life was scripted to be the way it was.  I truly feel for him.<br /><br />But, I had two friends just pass away from cancer.  They didn't hurt anybody, and were gems.  After reading a book like this it just makes me wonder why God, or whatever runs the show, makes these decisions.  For good or for bad, Nikki Sixx had it all and if he had just stopped to really explore his life he would have sidestepped all the destruction.  He could have started giving back much sooner.  He credits his addictions to his now renewed sense of giving.<br /><br />Fortunately he is really making amends and doing some good things, and him being a good father figure is another great lesson.  Redemption is for everyone; you don't have to repeat the mistakes of the past; things can change.  I hope people read this book and look at life in positive ways.  We all may not have the money Nikki Sixx has, but being born gives such a chance, we just need to nurture that chance.  He had some good role models, and some bad.  Glad he is drawing from the good ones now.  Truly a book that teaches many lessons.<br /><br />Peacepast; things can change.  I hope people read this book and look at life in positive ways.

B007549YM4|3.0|\\"This ain't exactly the garden of Eden.\\" After a nuclear bomb is dropped and earth is uninhabitable a group of tenants of an apartment are forced to live together in the basement of the building. What starts off as a tense situation quickly explodes into something much, much worse and everyone's views of each other change. This is not what I was expecting. I thought this would be more of a Sci-Fi type movie and what it was was a very disturbing look at what different people will do when pushed to the edge. For those that have seen the movie \\"Blindness\\" you will know what to expect. For those that haven't be warned, this is a very, very disturbing look at the human condition and makes you wonder what you would do in this situation. Overall, more disturbing then anything. Not bad, but you must be ready for what you will see. I give it a B-.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I have not been impressed with a lot of movies from hollywood in the past few years.  They just do not inspire me.  John Carter is an exception.

1596597682|1.0|I read about 30 business books each year and this is probably the worst book that I've listened to in the past four years.  I strongly encourage you not to waste your money on this boook.  It was incredibly repetitive with its examples.  Also, it gave very few suggestions for developing a growth mindset (just that having a growth mindset is good and having a fixed mindset is bad).<br /><br />The part of the book that irritated me the most was the part about Al Dunlap (hatchet man at Sunbeam), executives at Enron, and other \\"evil\\" executives who have fixed mindsets while more virtuous executives who believe in sharing with multiple stakeholders have growth mindsets.  Ergo, you're good if you have a growth mindset and bad if you have a fixed mindset.  That line of thinking was especially weak.<br /><br />In summary, please don't waste your money on this book.
B0076NAWWA|5.0|I was already a big fan of all the musicians on this album, with the exception of McPherson who was new to me.  In most respects, this album exceeds expectations - it is full of great rock/pop songwriting, memorable hooks, and great musicianship.<br /><br />It is not Dream Theater, or Transatlantic, or Spock's Beard, or the Steve Morse Band - but it definitely does sound reminiscent of most of those bands (with not as much DT influence).  McPherson adds interesting melodies and another capable singing voice (along with the great Neal Morse) to the picture.<br /><br />I started listening to the album about 27 hours ago and I am on my sixth spin, for what it's worth.  There is just so much to like here.  Portnoy's drum work is great for the prog/pop/rock style.  Neal Morse is incredible (and his songwriting is evident) as always.  Steve Morse provides some gorgeous leads, and it almost seems as if his playing was elevated slightly by this project (as much as I always like his solo work).  Listen to his Brian May-like lead in \\"Love Is What I'm Waiting For\\".  Dave LaRue is solid as always and grooves fantastically in parts (Blue Ocean, Infinite Fire, Forever In A Daze).  And McPherson, the \\"wildcard\\", proves very capable in his own right as a singer, lyricist, and melodic writer.  There seems to be a great balance between all the principal players in this project, and it thrives on that.<br /><br />This is music that transcends genre and really has the ability to appeal to huge swathes of people if they would be willing to try something slightly different.  As much as I like heavy music, I think this band is really in its element in the less-heavy tracks.  Highlights for me are \\"Blue Ocean\\", \\"Kayla\\", \\"The Storm\\", \\"Better Than Walking Away\\", and \\"Infinite Fire\\".<br /><br />Are there any negatives?  No strong ones.  I wish they would have chosen Neal Morse or McPherson to sing \\"Fool In My Heart\\".  I don't understand why Portnoy continues to insist on singing - do it liveif you like, but this is a classic album that is slightly marred by Mike's OK vocals.  Neal Morse would have made that song great.<br /><br />I preordered the CD / t-shirt / poster package (from a different vendor) months ago, and I will preorder any future offerings without a second thought.  Please put out more music!

0060797509|4.0|You don't have to have the whole Little House series on your shelf, but it certainly seems that this first volume should be there as a tryout. I can see a younger modern reader falling in love with the stories, but I would not be surprised if a similar reader just couldn't connect with it. It really does seem to be a mood piece, and unpredictable at that. In that regard I can see it as similar to the Anne of Green Gables phenomenon. And, like the Anne series, maybe you fall in love and maybe you're happy with one and done. Either way, a Wilder volume does seem to be an essential part of the kids' library.

0553582038|2.0|I could not put down A Game of Thrones the first time I picked it up.  And this was well before there was a television series on HBO.  I thought it was one of the best fantasy books I have ever read.  I liked the second book as well, but not as much.  And I didn't care for all the supernatural elements that emerged so heavily in the third book, but I kept going.  I'm almost finished with this, the fourth book in the series, and I give up.  I find myself so bored by this book that I don't care if I finish it.  It just doesn't hold my attention.  Maybe too many Starks and other characters I like were killed off.  Maybe too many of the relationships between characters that I enjoy were severed.  Maybe there are just too many characters that I don't care about or like reading from their point of view being introduced, or too many characters period.  I'm not exactly sure what the problem is, I just know that it does not make for good reading anymore and I give up.

B003B02PF4|1.0|Grisham tries his hand at international thrillers, with lackluster results.  The set up seems like it could be Ludlum, or Clancy...but the delivery is disappointing. About 20 pages into the book, the plot fizzles out and boredom sets in. We plod along with an American man hiding in Italy, trying to blend in.  Our hero visits numerous churches and drinks many cappuccinos. In all, Grisham wastes the reader's time with this insipid half Italian phrasebook half Italian travel guide with no purpose and no fun.  He should stick with courtroom drama. Skip this one.

B003R0MF5I|2.0|I have also just had an experience with poor picture quality on a Chuck season 4 DVD set purchased from an Amazon merchant. The image quality was so poor - and so much lower than seasons 1-3 - that I returned the set within 48 hours.<br /><br />The packaging and discs looked new and authentic, but viewing from 8' away, the picture exhibited a significant loss of detail, noticeable and distracting background pixilation, blotchy colors and a fuzzy quality that looked like I was watching thru a window screen. I compared them to my season two set and the difference was striking.  I also noticed warning language at the end of the disc in many foreign languages - including those not normally used in the western hemisphere. I'm not sure if this was a real WB set or a bootleg. I've made a number of purchases through Amazon and their merchants - and these are the first DVD's I've had to return.  Both Amazon and the vendor were cordial and cooperative in assisting my return, but I will be more wary from now on.

B003H4I4JU|5.0|I do not understand why, with the popularity of the first book, this one has so few reviews.  In my opinion, this book is much stronger.  While the first book does devote time towards dealing with themes that have managed to remain relevant long after its initial publication, this book goes into more detail exploring much more compelling questions.<br /><br />In \\"Ender's Game,\\" most of the book is devoted to Ender's time in the Battle School.  What we read about there is Ender's transition from little boy on Earth, a Third who experiences a difficult life on a planet experiencing societal difficulties, going off to train in the business of war.  While it is an arduous physical journey for Ender, and he does have some difficulty with psychological issues such as separation from family, learning how to compromise his ethics in order to survive, and learning how to lead other people, those psychological issues seemed secondary for much of the book.  Only at the end of the first story are we introduced with the psychological significance of what Ender was compelled to do.<br /><br />That is why I do not understand the apparent lack of people making the transition over to this, the follow-up.  All of the big questions seemed to hang out there, dangling like a teaser at the end.  How could anyone not continue on to see how Ender would cope with his xenocide, especially since it is revealed at the end of that book that a hive queen survived and was communicating with Ender?  How could they not continue on to see how his colony had turned out, how humanity had turned out after moving forward from the society Peter had left behind?<br /><br />All of these important questions are explored in \\"Speaker for the Dead,\\" and they are handled really well.  The concept of a Speaker for the Dead is fascinating, especially in the context of Ender's story.  Here is a boy who was essentially tricked into killing off an entire intelligent species, just to find that he had an opportunity for redemption.  First Ender writes the Hive Queen and the Hegemon, turning his own name into an epithet.  The humanity that once loved him as their savior has turned their back on him, casting him off as the personification of evil.  Later this redemption continues as Ender takes on the role of Speaker, teaching people that, as is explained in the book, good and evil both exist in the same heart.  He essentially primes people for understanding what he did, his actions and his motivations, hoping that one day he would earn his redemption.  \\"Here is the good, here is the bad.  No judgement.  Just the truth.\\"<br /><br />At first the fast forward three thousand years into the future seems ridiculous, but as the book continues it begins to make more sense.  We get to see a society that seems to have taken Ender's lessons in the Hive Queen and the Hegemon to heart, but as we learn in the book humanity only seems to have learned that lesson because it was convenient.  The true test comes when they encounter another sentient species.  Ender has changed, but has humanity really changed, even after three thousand years?<br /><br />In this book humanity gets another chance, this time with the benefit of hindsight.  Will they repeat their mistakes, or learn from them and handle things better this time around?  That is one of the central questions that is answered in this book.  The answer is made clear by the end of this book, so I will not spoil it in my review.<br /><br />The concept of the Hierarchy of Foreignness is also fascinating.  Anyone who has spent any time considering interaction with other species will be compelled by this story.  I know people of my generation have seen Cosmos, and likely remember the scene where Carl Sagan discusses the problems we would face when interacting with alien intelligent life.  To paraphrase:  \\"We can't even interact with the other intelligent life on our own planet.\\"  And then closer to today we have Stephen Hawking's speculation on how alien races would treat us if they encountered us first.  Anyone who has seen these things and engaged in any thought experiment will be compelled by this story as they read about individuals and a society struggle with determining where the piggies and buggers fall on this hierarchy.<br /><br />Maybe because we live in a time with no space operas on television, young people are not drawn to these ethical questions as much as those of us who grew up on shows like Star Trek.  We watched stories about humanity struggling against its worst impulses to be the people that they wanted to be.  So reading such a story seems pretty natural, and darn entertaining.  That is why I find \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" so much more compelling than \\"Ender's Game.\\"  It is also why I find the reviews bemoaning the lack of \\"action\\" of the first book.  Ender does not need to cave a Bonzo's nose into his brain in every book in order for significant, compelling action to have taken place.  \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" has actions in spades, as complex characters evolve and change in response to the events that they encounter.  You should not be disappointed by this book.ow alien races would treat us if they encountered us first.

B0000YEEGM|5.0|Imagine being in your 20's and finding out you have an older brother? This unknown brother has been in an asylum for years and is a highly functioning autistic savant.<br />RAIN MAN won several Academy Awards for this touching portrayal of two brothers coming to terms with each other. Dustin Hoffman was Best Actor for his role as Raymond. Tom Cruise is the materialistic young brother devasted and angered not only by the news of an older brother but the fact their recently departed father has left his estate to Raymond.<br /><br />Charlie is bitter and a player in a big man's world. He needs money and Raymond's inheritance is his future. He takes Raymond on a cross country trip but he is out for a big lesson in life and brotherly love. Raymond is very childlike and dependent on his routine. Lights out at 11 pm sharp, eating food with toothpicks and knowing exactly when PEOPLE'S COURT and WHEEL OF FORTUNE are on TV. Charlie has no patience or understanding for Raymond's simple needs and reliance on repetition. When Charlie learns Raymond's amazing mathematical skills and memory, it is time to stop off in Las Vegas.<br /><br />I've heard from firsthand sources that Dustin Hoffman researched his role with dedication and spent time with austic savants to learn their mannerisms and reactions. Hoffman shows his amazing talents and clearly deserved his Best Actor award. We have a young Tom Cruise just a few years into his acting career taking on a very serious role. Although he is \\"normal\\", Cruise's Charlie is far more immature in many ways than his autistic brother. There is a true beauty in this film as we see Charlie grow and mature in front of our eyes. A nurturing instinct is slowly arises as he develops a clear affection for his brother Raymond.<br /><br />It's a bittersweet and heartwarming story to watch. Two very different brothers come together in a very fine film.

B00756GKBA|5.0|Madonna seems to have the finger on the pulse of music as well as social events. She exposes herself as the intelligent entrepreneur, dreamer, friend, musician, entertainer, sinner, lover, fallible human, birthday girl, and still tells the world that she doesn't give a flying fig what people think of her or her doings. From the opening song, Girls Gone Wild, she prays for forgiveness and penance but loses all of it by the time the end of Gang Bang arrives.<br /><br />MDNA sounds like Madonna, not losing a beat, took her time with no pressure from any of the industry big-wigs. A well-thought out and formatted album that displays what we all knew of Madonna - She's a Bad-Girl kneeling in the confessional with not so good thoughts going through her mind. Excellent ingredients for an excellent album!

B0010X73ZG|5.0|i was up for a sci-fi/horror film and decided on \\"the mist\\".  i had it streamed to my kindle, put on the headphones, and curled up in a chair.  i was ready for some mindless entertainment but by the end of the film i felt like i had been punched in the chest.  i was not prepared for the multi-dimensional story line that became,for me,a tale of america today.  i don't want to add much more because others have done a good job of plot development, etc.  the last time i was this taken by a sci-fi film was \\"cloverfield\\" and it wasn't as emotionally intense.  \\"mist\\" may not be suitable for the whole family.

B006JTS5OO|1.0|I was a fan of the original Muppet Show. My brother and I watched it every week. Oh, there were some skits that weren't all that funny, but for the most part it was pretty amusing. When The Muppet Movie came out, our parents took us to see it and we enjoyed it quite a bit, what with memorable songs like \\"Rainbow Connection\\" and \\"Movin' Right Along\\" to help move what was a fairly basic plot along. I don't remember much of \\"Muppets Take Manhattan\\" and I'm pretty sure I've never seen any of the other \\"classic\\" Muppet movies. Now that I have children of my own, I decided to take a chance on this new Muppets movie to help introduce my boys to characters I enjoyed when I was their age. MISTAKE.<br /><br />The only smart thing I did was NOT purchase this film. Oh, I had seen plenty of previews to know this one was going to be \\"iffy\\" at best, but I had little to no idea just how bad this Muppet Mess was going to be. Starting out, we have a human and an obvious Muppet that are supposedly brothers ... and I actually didn't really have a problem with that. Hey, it's The Muppets. You have to suspend a little disbelief, correct? Except, why does no one even begin to question how a freakin' MUPPET was birthed from a HUMAN? Ok, ok ... suspended disbelief. Suspending disbelief, however, does not cover why everything else in this film is so freakin' awful. The songs are awful, and instantly forgettable. The \\"dance\\" numbers accompanying the songs? Bad. While it's true that I haven't seen a ton of movies with Jason Siegel in them, he has never impressed me with any kind of singing or acting talent. Granted, he has very little to work with here, but at the least I figured that Amy Adams; cute, adorable, Amy Adams could rise above it. Nope. She is just as bad. I mean, they even managed to make her look, shall I say, less than attractive in this film. Amy Adams! Incredible. Muppets, Humans, whatever, NONE of them could save the music in this flick (ARGH, don't get me started on \\"We BuiltThis City\\"). I cringed, seriously cringed, every time a musical number came up.<br /><br />I'll briefly touch on the supposed \\"villain\\", the unsuprisingly stereotypical Evil Oilman/Businessman, Tex Richman. Tex Richman? Seriously? THAT is the most original name you could come up with? Here, kids, let me hit you over the head with a baseball bat full of subtlety. I was almost embarrassed for Chris Cooper in this role. Almost. After all, he agreed to do it, so my sympathy only goes so far. His evil scheme was an oil field in the middle of downtown Los Angeles. Totally believable, of course, because that's what evil businessmen do. They build oil fields in the middle of a city. Oil fields that are, at the most, the size of a mid-sized theater. Great plan. How did this bozo ever get his wealth? Speaking of wealth ...<br /><br />... One of the beloved Muppet characters, the Great Gonzo, is shown as a quite successful businessman himself, and he has amassed what appears to be a small fortune building up a huge plumbing company. Kermit, Pseudo-human Walter, Jason and Amy come to Gonzo and tell him they need to raise a huge amount of money in a very short time, to save their old Muppet Theater. It's assumed that Gonzo has a bit of wealth himself at this point so he just gives them a loan, right? Outright gives them a huge wad of cash, no strings attached? Nah, he blows up his entire company (and fortune ... endangering dozens of employees at least) and hops in the car with them. Of course. Miss Piggy is also shown to be very successful but, you guessed it, the question of her loaning or giving any money for the cause doesn't come up either. No, that would be too convenient. Terrible.<br /><br />The cameos in this film? Forced. Forgettable. Almost forgettable, that is. James Carville? REALLY?!? Sarah Silverman? Yep, she's a great, wholesome comic for a Disney audience. There was a decent chuckle when even Kermit didn't know the name of one of the Disney kid actors that showed up near the end. Of course, it was pretty much just a \\"hey, look, we can laugh at ourselves\\" moment, but at least it was SOMEthing semi-amusing. Outside of that chuckle, I laughed exactly twice during the rest of the movie, once involving the Swedish Chef and once at Jim Parson's cameo ... and that was it. I tried my best to get over the fact that these Muppets don't even sound like \\"My\\" Muppets (for obvious reasons), but it's difficult knowing that I can do a better \\"Kermit the Frog\\" than the guy who actually performs him now. Not braggin', that's a fact, and I'm not alone. I've heard others that were better, also. Well, whatever. In such an awful incarnation of the Muppets, their voices were, in the end, the least I had a problem with. Save your money. Save your memories. Go buy the Muppet Show DVDs instead, or the original Muppet Movie. Introduce your kids to the Muppets that way. When they grow up, they'll thank you for it.

1400052181|4.0|Rebecca Skloot's `The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks' is a riveting story of the birth of bioethics and highlights the legal battles that surrounds medical discovery to this day. The story is told from the perspective of a poor, black tobacco farmer whose cancer cells were taken without her knowledge, and the cells went on to become one of the most significant tools in modern medicine.    It is the 1950s, and we meet Henrietta Lacks, a poor, black tobacco farmer. In the prime of her life, at the age of 30, she is struck down by cervical cancer with tragic consequences for her young family. Unbeknownst to them, and without her consent, her doctor takes a piece of her of tumour and these cancer cells go on become the first tissue cells to grow and survive in cultures.    These immortal cells proved pivotal in the development of the polio vaccine. The HeLa cells, as they were called to protect Henrietta's identity, have since resulted in many scientific milestones, including cloning, gene mapping and in vitro fertilisation. They have even been sent up into space to see what would happen to cells in zero gravity. Needless to say, the HeLa cells have contributed to a multibillion-dollar medical industry.    For nearly a quarter of a century, Henrietta's family was completely unaware of her legacy and received no compensation. It was only 25 years after her death that scientists discovered that Henrietta's cells had contaminated hundreds of other tissue cultures. It turned out that HeLa cells could float on dust particles in the air and travel on unwashed hands, thereby contaminating other cultures.    A group of scientists decided to track down her relatives to take samples from them in the hope that they could use the family's DNA to map Henrietta's genes so they could distinguish Henrietta's cell cultures from others and sort out the controversial contamination problem. Henrietta's impoverished family became entangled in medical research they neither comprehended norbenefitted from, and once their mother's identity was revealed, their anger and frustration was understandable and expected.    Skloot, an award-winning writer who specialises in, what she calls, narrative science writing, first learned about Henrietta when she was a 16-year-old biology student. Skloot says she became quite obsessed with telling Henrietta's story, which was easier said than done. Henrietta's family resisted her overtures for over a year, finally collaborating with her once they were convinced she had their mother's story and legacy at heart.    Skloot's writing is gripping, but all the more so because this is no work of fiction - it's the true story of the groundbreaking HeLa line of cells that live on today in laboratories worldwide. Skloot's message is clear: Human beings drive scientific advances and, even with the best of intentions, things can and do go wrong. However, people are behind all human tissue samples and, medical and scientific advancement notwithstanding, they should have some say in what happens to their cells.

B007ORV092|5.0|I paid extra for the HD version of Mad Men because I wanted 5.1 audio. I have 3 different sound cards in my computer (well, 4, but one of them wouldn't have really been an option in this case) and I cannot get 5.1 audio out of any of them. Have tried using 6 channel analog out, HDMI, and optical s/pdif and NONE of them produce 5.1 sound. Of course, they do with BDs, HD-DVDs, DVDs, and other files encoded with DD and DTS audio, but not with unbox. This is annoying and just plain stupid. I'd be willing to bet that it's a DRM issue and, once again, DRM just hurts the people who are trying to use content that they paid for. There is probably a hacker out there right now who is cracking the DRM on this and enjoying the sound and quality that I'm paying for. This is just great.<br /><br />ETA: I was pretty grumpy when I wrote this and did the thing that I don't like in reviews-- when people review something other than the movie/show/etc. I still say to avoid Unbox for now-- even on 20mbps connection I get frequent buffering and an interruption offering to make the quality worse-- seriously, can you at least ad a \\"do not ask me this question again\\" option? I'll lower the quality myself if I want to.<br /><br />But the season itself is fantastic. The writers at Mad Men and, more gnerally, all the shows on AMC are above top notch.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was really the best book i have ever read because they had the best describing words and details i have ever seen in a book. And they described everything so well that i could see it in my head so it was basically like a movie! I hope everyone gets a chance to read this book because like i said, this was the best book i have ever read! Thank you! :)
B0059XTUB8|5.0|Yeah, like you I read the reviews and was prepared not to like this film, especially Michelle Williams.<br /><br />But, although it is not \\"completely\\" Marilyn, it is definitely not Michelle on the screen.  Michelle does capture the essence of Marilyn without doing a parody.  It is her best role to date. It is a good script, with good photography.<br /><br />The point the movie really makes is Norma Jean Baker knew she was not Marilyn Monroe.  She wanted to be loved for Norma Jean, but she lost that persona through the sexual abuse in her teens, and was left with the fictional Marilyn.<br /><br />She acted on stage and off.  Watch it twice and you will see this happen.<br /><br />I rented the film, now it's off to WalMart to buy it.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Okay, i'm not reviewing this book to bash it, I just wanna say what I think of it.<br /><br />I had to read this book for my school summer reading. I thought that it might be good. But I was sorely dissapointed. The characters lacked life, lacked emotion and almost every one (Katniss, Petta..) seemed superficial to me. All Katniss thought was &#34;Oh, I hope I look good on T.V&#34; &#34;My, look at all this food. This bread tastes so good.&#34;<br /><br />It irked me the whole time I read it. PLUS! ***Spoiler Alert!***<br />THE ENDING DROVE ME INSAINE!<br />I would like the hours of my life I used to read this book back please.<br />Really? Dogs? They turned into muts? What a waste of a could-of-been good story. I do like the idea of this story, I just don't like the way there was no depth to the characters, the overused adjactives, and the first person point of view.<br /><br />If you really want to read a good book I sugest you look else where.
B0074EIQQU|5.0|You can say one thing for the Mars Volta, even if you don't like every album they ever made, they hardly repeat themselves. This is no exception - rhythmically complicated, but dramatically more electronic, melodic and accessible than the earlier works. It may be March, but it's clearly the best new disc out so far on the year.
B000244FDW|1.0|OMG.  This is so painful to watch.  Lousy acting, lots of quotes from the book from wrong people, people seem to gossip, Mr. Bennett is just so crabby; everyone is obnoxious.  I was going to buy this because I love this book, and I liked the A@E version, even the last movie with Kira Knightly was decent, if short.  Luckily, I was able to borrow it.  If you are thinking about buying this, try to at least see a preview first.

0439023521|5.0|I am not usually a fan of stories about dystopian worlds.  I prefer the fantasy stories with the feel-good happily ever after endings.  But there was so much press about this book that I had to see what everyone was talking about.  It drew me in from the start and I could not put it down.  I was late putting dinner on the table.  My children went to sleep without their baths.  For a few days our household routine was completely upended as I tried to finish the book because I could not stop reading it.  A world where the top rated show is the Hunger Games, a reality show where children fight to the death leaving one winner.  A bleak future is presented in this story.  The only way I can describe it is disturbingly fascinating.  SPOILER ALERT: (at this point do we even need spoiler alerts for this book?) The fact that the story is told in the first person does give away how the story will end, but there was a nice twist added at the end that makes me look forward to reading the next book to see how the story continues.
B00756GKBA|1.0|Once upon a time there was a 'Super Star'... We crowned her as 'The Queen Of Pop'.<br /><br />...

B0014BY72Q|2.0|I first saw this about 25 years ago and had some pretty good memories of it. The carousel idea was especially interesting, since I believed then, as now, that all things are renewed upon so-called death. That is the part that truly brought me back for another viewing.<br /><br />During this particular look-see, I was troubled by the way the plot bounced and ebbed and jerked around and ran itself into logistical walls. There were also too many trite and/or cornball elements. One of the little dome models was apparently made of bubble wrap.<br /><br />I didn't even finish it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I think the last book I read was the dog whisperers and before that, the princess of mars way back when I was in middle school.<br /><br />I got this book for my wife because I saw it on the morning TV talk shows. They were talking about how woman are reading romance novels more now that they have electric devices like the Kindle and tablets. Woman can read the books in the public without worrying about being seen reading a romance novel and being Embarrassed.<br /><br />My wife and I started reading the book at bed time instead of lying in bed watching TV.  I find the book interesting in different ways then my wife does. She enjoys the romance part and reading about the touch and feel and spark that is between Mr. Grey and Mrs. Steele. I on the other hand as a guy who is more visual, I enjoyed the banter between them more then the romance part. As Anastasia, I'm a virgin if you will and I do not have anything to compare this romance novel to because this is my first. With that said, I feel like this book was well written and I enjoyed it as much as my wife did. I read one review where they were upset that the author used the word \\"SEX\\" for her vagina. I also read a review where they complained that too many times the author used repetitive language like \\"Oh Crap\\" \\"Holy Hell\\" but I felt like that's what a young girl would say in her mind when she was shocked. I thought it was smart and made me as a man feel like I was reading a mature book versus a wet dream written to take woman away and fantasize about a life of sex and romance they don't have at home. I have a great relationship with my wife and I enjoyed reading this book with her. I'm ready to read the 2nd and 3rd books as well.
1451627289|2.0|I chose this book based on the positive reviews.  I am old enough to remember the day Kennedy was shot.  It is a VERY LONG book.  Too much little detail about the old days.  I got about half way thru the 800 pages, and couldn't decide whether to give up on it, or plod thru til the end.  I decided I would read the rest of the book, since I had made it that far.<br />I kept waiting for the plot to get exciting.  It did finally, in a few chapters.<br />The relationship between Jake, aka George, and Sadie, was so sugary... it was annoying.<br />There are so many other good books out there to read, don't waste your time on this one.
032147404X|4.0|I probably shouldn't even leave a comment yet on this book considering I haven't completely read it so this review is strictly in regards to the shipping and the condition of the book. The book arrived two days after I ordered it and it's in brand new condition! I will check in once I've read it and update my review. :)
B001DX7AX8|4.0|Everyone in the professional world or in a leadership capacity should read this book.  It provides some insight into our current work environments and how to interact with various co-workers.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele delivers on this CD.  My preference is oldies rock and roll music but I believe in being open to hearing new music.<br />It is such a pleasure to listen to this album.
B005W3G2D4|5.0|I usually doesn't like to purchase an entire album because some songs will surely not be good. But stronger is great, all songs are good, I found myself listening the whole album in repeat. Definetely worth the price!
B006T3RM08|1.0|The Apple trackpad gets jammed immediately and is no longer able to click. To work around this defect you have to enable \\"Tap to click\\". When Tap to click is enabled then the \\"Swipe between full-screen apps\\" feature requires four fingers instead of three.  Very disappointed.
0811876373|5.0|Cake Pops by Bakerella is a good first book to turn to if you are just starting out. Not only does it have cake and frosting recipes to try, but is shows how to do them using boxed mixes and canned frosting. It shows you literally baby-step by baby-step on how to roll or form standard cake balls, basic cake pops, and cupcake pops and balls. The spiral binding makes turning pages and staying on a page easy, and the design team did an awesome job with color pictures and colored accents throughout the book.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I admit, this book is a bit of a guilty pleasure for me. I was sucked in by the fantasy of boy meets girl, they fall helplessly in love, and live happily ever after. However....the writing sucked. I am on the third book and by now, after every kind of sexual experience that Ana has had, you would think she could come up with a new phrase to describe herself than \\"her sex\\". That drives me nuts. It's a vagina...at least use the P.C. term. I felt like the author sees all her readers as middle school students and for all the sex scenes she puts in here, she can't come up with better words to use than the girls \\"sex\\"? I also feel it is unrealistic and unbelieveable in the times we are in, for the 21 year old main character to be so virginal, so inexperienced sexually that she hasn't even touched herself or shaved her bikini line. And how quickly she came around! It is a guilty pleasure, but it isn't the best book in terms of quality of writing, that I have ever read.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|These are reviews of the game. Not an open thread on mid-range devices (kindle fire)... It will soon be compatible. How about a little patience. Bottom line, you get what you pay for! 5 stars great game!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't normally take the time to write reviews of books, but I felt compeled to write about this book.  I didn't really know what to expect when I downloaded this book.  I had many people telling me it really was a great book.  I decided to take the plunge and download it.  I was hooked after the first 4 pages.  I literally could not put my book down, and when I did all I could think about was this book and what would happen next.  This book truly is a great book and deserves the 5 stars!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book did NOT disappoint me. Suzanne does it again and captivates you from the start. I couldn't put this book down. She definitely takes you by surprise with the twists and turns...but in the end I was still thirsty for more.

B0074JOCIG|5.0|It's been a long time since I can remember an artist that continually just gets better with each passing album and concert. Joe Bonamassa is with out a doubt one of the best to come down the line in a long long time. I could go on and on but his praises have already been sung here. If you like this guy this will blow you away. Heck...every musician or any one with a lick of musical sense should pick this up. Yeah it's that good. I have several dozen concert Blu Rays ...(and 100 or more DVD's)...in my ever growing collection and this is now in the top 3. Porcupine Tree's Anesthetize, Rush's R30, Peter Gabriel's Growing Up, David Gilmour's Albert Hall and Toto's Falling in Between would be the other great ones so far. This is better than his Royal Albert Hall Blu Ray. (which is great too)<br /><br />Here's the basics. Set list is great. Picture quality is great. DTS Master 5.1 is AWESOME on a good system. Band is tight. Venue is great. Guest artist great. None of the artsy fartsy distortion or quick 1 and 2 second cut and pans of Black Country's or other Blu Rays. Every one is showcased as needed for a proper amount of time. It's just a freaking awesome concert. Buy it!<br /><br />This Blu Ray should be a new standard by which all others are judged.

It is a disappointing step in the series.  I have it on my Nook so if I'm completely bonkers bored or stuck on the subway I may pick it up and plod on.  Or I may do something more interesting like contemplate my shoelaces.

B004LROUNG|4.0|While I haven't been reading fiction in a while since I was concentrating on non fiction, I started back up again once I got my Kindle.<br /><br />I remember buying one of John's paperbacks years ago b/c just his name sells the book, & it was sooo bad, it sat in my magazine rack & got all dirty & dusty. I remember feeling really let down.<br /><br />Then I read another book of his (can't remember the name) & it was okay, but nothing great.<br /><br />I just finished reading this one & LOVED IT. It did fizzle a smidgen towards the end, but I loved his sense of humor & I do like learning (assuming the facts are correct) about what goes on behind closed doors in the corrupt legal system.<br /><br />If I'm laughing out loud, that's a good thing :  )<br /><br />It wasn't as exciting as some of his first pieces, but at least I enjoyed myself & was happy I read it.<br /><br />Keep up the good work John :  )<br /><br />Michelle
B0018QQQK8|5.0|For me to truly love a book, I must first love the style of writing, the prose.  And I absolutely loved Nicholas Sparks' storytelling in The Lucky One.  I have only read one other Sparks' book, A Bend in the Road, which I also liked a lot, but The Lucky One is my favorite of the two.<br /><br />What I liked/loved most:<br />*It is a great story.  It may not be the most original storyline, but what makes it unique is the way Sparks tells this story. It is a story that I can relate to because it felt real, like something I could  easily encounter or deal with in everyday life. I appreciated the sensitivity with which Sparks interweaves the story of war and its effects on the men and women who serve so faithfully.  I was almost brought to tears, and when I am emotionally touched like that when reading, I know it's a good read.<br /><br />*I like the themes of luck, fate and destiny, which is central to the story.  It made me grapple with my own understanding of and belief in the terms.<br /><br />*The characters seem real.  I could relate to them.  The developing relationship between Logan (Thibault)and Elizabeth (Beth)was plausible, and they had great chemistry.  And the secondary characters fit the story perfectly.  I loved the grandmother's (Nana)wit and wisdom.  And I fell in love with Zeus, the faithful German shepherd. I even learned a little about dogs and kennels -- to the point of considering the adoption of my own dog!  How's that for effective writing.<br /><br />What I found lacking -- for lack of a better term:<br />*And this may be a spoiler, so SPOILER ALERT.  In the end, during the fatal storm, I could not understand how Ben, a child, could struggle through the elements of the storm and make it to the tree house, when Beth, Logan, and Clayton had such difficulty. I also found this particular scene a bit drawn out and dramatic.<br />*Nor did I quite understand the redemption of Clayton. It seemed a drastic change in his character to at one moment be threatening his ex-wife and the next sacrificing his own life to save his son -- a son whom he had never shown any great affection for in the story. I suppose as a reader, I am to take a leap -- to somehow believe that deep down in his soul, Clayton...well, had a soul and it revealed itself when most needed.  And left a legacy for his son, Ben, that would transcend the lack of love he failed to show during his life.  Well, at least that what I assume.  But I wish Sparks had given me a glimpse of Clayton's goodness, so that I could believe such an conclusion.<br /><br />End of \\"possible\\" spoiler.<br /><br />Nevertheless, these minor \\"flaws\\" don't detract from my still considering this a good read, an excellent story and one that I would highly recommend.  Last night I saw a trailer for an upcoming movie based on this book.  I didn't know when I was reading that it would be a movie.  Based on the the little I saw, I'm not sure if I want to see the movie, for it might not live up to what I've just finished reading.  And I simply don't want to spoil the experience.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I really enjoyed Nikki Sixx's book \\"The Heroin Diaries\\". I found it to be as true & real to life as you can get. Heroin has always been his drug of choice but he shares many other addictions and addictive behaviours that make you wonder how he ever survived. A great account of living life on the edge and finding your way home.

0439023521|1.0|This book is terrible - teens killing teens! And, written and designed for teens.  Put what ever political, philosophic, literary, futuristic, \\"Occupy\\", \\"Lord of the Flies\\", \\"1984\\" spin on it you wish, but we adults would have been better off without this book, to say nothing about our young.  The real tragedy of this book/movie is that it was written/sold/hyped/distributed/made a \\"must read\\" by adults only trying to make lots of money, not caring one whit what effect it would have on young minds trying to make some sense of this crazy world.  But, that is really not the job of the \\"market\\" is it?<br />  I am surprised that it was not entitled \\"The Columbine Games\\", but that name was probably already taken!

0545265355|5.0|I was late to the dance when it came to the Hunger Games Trilogy, but I can tell you that these books will affect you more than you can ever understand.<br /><br />I hope everyone, not only YA's and young adults, adults, politicians, lawyers--everyone read these books. It has had that much affect on me.<br /><br />Set in Post-Apocolyptic America, there are twelve districts, and a shiny Capitol that thad the citizens of the districts in such a stronghold, there is no dissent, hardly any wealth. Most are almost starving in their poor homes.<br /><br />In District Twelve, we meet Katniss Everdeen. She is a strong seventeen year old who had to take over the family's existence as her mother shuts down when the father is blown to bits in the colalmines of the Appalachians.<br /><br />The government has a tight reign on its citizens.<br />To avoid another Apocolyptic battle, the Capitol holds The Hunger Games, where children from twelve to eighteen one male, one female to participate in a battle to the death - the last person standing brings food to their district and the victor is set for life.<br /><br />But this reaping, Katniss' twelve year old sister, Prim is selected. Rather than see her baby sister meet certain death, she volunteers in her place.<br /><br />Thus starts one of the trilogies that will be talked about for a long time. Can these young people start a revolution starting a new order???<br /><br />Suzanne Collins created a brilliant world of opposites that will make you think and obsess over the actions of these books for a long time to come.<br /><br />I haven't seen the first movie yet, but have my Mockinjay pin ready to wear when I see this movie.<br /><br />Brilliant brilliant brilliant<br /><br />Ellen Grorge, author of children's book, Flutterby and up-coming first full-length novel
B006MGC3VK|5.0|It's quite hilarious after reading the reviews from Tynie and other people who claim disappointment. They like many other's belong to a group of people that have a fit if a sequel doesn't sound EXACTLY like they interpret the last one. Which is hilarious even more since they do not realize that this is Progressive music. Meaning it changes after each album with a very unique twist. This album is the BEST album i have heard in a while. Especially with Kevin moore's PROWESS on the keyboard and mixing things electronically to make the perfect sound. You can certainly tell that in this album he has spent countless days and hours of refining it.<br /><br /> w<br />the results are WORTH EVERY PENNY! this album is unique in it's own right. It has very original mixes, It strays from the path of most other bands would do in this type of genre. But i guess (like the new opeth album) You will always find whiners and complainers. While they complain that it isn't repetitive. I enjoy listening to something new<br /><br />DO NOT HESITATE. BUY THIS ALBUM. Not off of here of course. Get it from google shopping and find one that doesn't charge ridiculous shipping rates.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I loved Anthony Bourdain before reading this, as I am a big fan of his show(s) and him in general as a critic and unapologetic \\"personality\\". So this book instilled even more how much I appreciate his style, his humility (yes, his humility) and how good of a writer he really is. In addition, it served as a helpful guide to dining out in NYC and just the things one should know in general about the restaurant industry. I loved how his \\"voice\\" came across in an approachable behind the scenes look at what it's really like to try to be a chef in one of the toughest (if not THE toughest) places on earth.  I feel like anyone wanting to be a chef, especially in NYC should read this as it will take them down to reality of what you will really encounter day in day out. However, I still really enjoyed the book just as an onlooker, not someone in the industry but appreciating those in it and the work that they do-so anyone who loves food and eating out would find this a really great read as well.
0061537969|5.0|This book has touched me on so many levels. Don't think, just buy it. So many people have written about the book and the author that I don't have much more to add than to say, read this, particularly if you are an animal lover.  A wonderful read that I will cherish for life. I will be conscious of where my eyes are focused, and I will look out for Enzo who today gave me back some faith in this crazy mixed up world.
1400031524|4.0|\\"The Dogs of Riga\\" is another Kurt Wallander mystery by talented Swedish writer Henning Mankell.  It is set in the early 1990's, as Europe is rocked by the dissolution of the Soviet Union.  Its premise is a visit by Swedish detective Wallander to the Baltic city of Riga, to follow up on the death of a Latvian detective.<br /><br />The story opens with the discovery of a life raft, washed ashore in Sweden with two corpses.  Wallander and his colleagues find tenuous links to Riga, prompting the visit of Lativan Detective Major Liepa, who quickly makes a strong impression.  When Liepa is murdered upon his return to Latvia, Wallander is asked to visit to shed light on Liepa's aborted investigation.<br /><br />Wallander is a stranger in a strange land, full of conspiracies, shadows, and rivalries, whose residents are in deadly earnest over goals that are unclear to him.  At stake is informatio allegedly gathered by Liepa that could shape the outcome of the struggle for power in a newly independent Latvia.  Wallander will cast his lot with the outsiders, including Liepa's widow Baiba...<br /><br />\\"The Dogs of Riga\\" reeks of paranoia and conspiracy.  Wallander will find more than one devil, and find himself frequently out of his depth.  His ability to survive and operate in the Lativan police state is a bit unrealistic, but the story works.  \\"The Dogs of Riga\\" is recommended as another good mystery by Mankell.
B002V092M4|5.0|At the time I purchased the book the remake of the movie was in the theathre and it was recommended that before you went to see the movie to read the book first. I like suspence stories but I can under stand why it was paramount to read the book first as the story takes you to different time frames some in past sense and then back to the curent time of the book also there are a lot of thought processes and that would be hard to get across in a movie. I have not seen the movie yet. I thouroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it to any one even though it takes place during the cold war it still is relevent today we still depent on surveillance and the spy forces are still out there to day.
B004EPYZSK|1.0|Sorry to say, this movie was a disappointment.  Harrison Ford was not at his best, I expected better.  He did not make a convincing cowboy.  The Indians seemed to be rather lame in the movie.  The characters were not well developed at the beginning of the story.  A boring movie, the plot was not well done.  The only decent part of the movie were the special effects, especially when some of the actors did their own stunts.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As a skeptic of the overall tone of the Hunger Games, I have definitely converted to a true believer. The trilogy is a must read for ages 12 - 84. I loved all three, and they must be read in order. This is the finale...you will love it!
B007MJSQSK|5.0|Herge said that Spielberg was the only one who could do justice to a film version of the Tintin comics, and he was right!  Some old aficionados might quibble over the retelling of the classic tales in a new way, but I feel that Spielberg and Jackson are faithful to Herge's vision.  They take some poetic license with the story, but the movie is amazingly close to the look and feel of the comics, with a technological update, of course.

B005LAIGN2|5.0|I saw the Tuskegee Airman first.  I've always thought that IF the 'kinfolk' would stop teaching their offspring to 'remember slavery', etc, which has a totally negative impact on a young mind and takes away their desire to be the best that they can be because they are taught they will always be 'kept down', then they can do whatever they want to do. This movie and now Red Tails proves me right! Some of these guys were among the ones that volunteered their service to this country, setting all negative feelings aside. It took some time, because of old ideas about the difference in race, but they did shine through!  This is something that ALL black people should be very proud of - the behavior of these men and what they accomplished in a difficult situation is monumental, and I'm white, lived through WWII and I'll tell you that I did not know any one of these men personally, but would have been proud to!  The amazing thing is they NEVER LOST A BOMBER they were sent to protect and guide to their destination.  Now THAT is something to be proud of - color didn't have anything to do with it - they were brave men, all, and did their jobs!  Hoorah!  Can't wait to see Red Tails!

B00756GKBA|5.0|The CD is amazing, Its an album I literally can't wait to have on my iPod following my one listen. Madonna's still pushing the envelope of her superstardom and MDNA is in no way a let down. It's just the next chapter in an already enthralling story and MDNA shows the young pretenders she is still a force to be reckoned with
B00729GQ0A|4.0|I don't usually read paranormal romance so I may not be the best person to review this book, but I felt like throwing in my two cents. Let me start of by saying this book is written well; it is professional quality;  it is good. As a 30 something male, I do not regret reading it, but I probably won't read it again.<br />This, being in a genre outside my comfort zone, I had a hard time rating it. I like action, mystery, suspense and horror, this story didn't have a lot of any of these.  It did have an air of mystery, but it is first and foremost a paranormal romance.<br />The characters are clearly written from a female perspective, so it was a little hard for me to truly relate. Each one seemed a little flat, a little cliché. I understand Sophie is troubled/broken/ full of self doubt, but at times she came off as too gloomy and whiny. Charles probably oozes sex appeal, but being a guy, I just didn't get any impression of any real personality. I know he wants her / shouldn't be with her, but he doesn't seem any deeper.<br />\\"A new take on old myths\\" is the best way to describe the overall story. The elementals, vampires and witches work well in this story. It sets this book apart from other vampire romances. And speaking of romance, the romance writing is solid, I never felt it overwhelmed the rest of the plot or was extremely gratuitous.<br />Even though I didn't find anything in this story that really grabbed hold of me, I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the genre. My daughter convinced me to read the twilight series, and I felt the same way about it. In fact, I preferred reading the forever girl to the twilight series, so I think that was the reason I rated this a 4 star instead of a 3.
0307957934|3.0|I hate to admit this, but I have never read a Robert Harris book before.  I was looking at \\"Newsweek\\" recently and there was a feature on this book and Mr. Harris in particular.  It piqued my interest as I enjoy suspense novels (not blood and gore but the more puzzle-oriented type).  I picked it up and began reading with high expectations.<br /><br />Early on, I was excited and drawn into the story.  I flipped through the first fifty pages or so and thought I had discovered a winner in this one.  After I continued reading, my enthusiasm diminished and I began to feel I was slogging through the middle portions.  I won't go into plot since there are so many reviews and you don't need my summation, but the swift set-up of the story was followed by a downshift in momentum that left me less enthused.  I enjoyed the main character of Alex and found his difficulty in dealing successfully with other people to be interesting. The other characters didn't seem fleshed out enough for me to care about them and his wife, Gabrielle, had potential but ended up being rather flat.  There are twists and turns in the plot that kept me puzzled and interested for a while but the ending just didn't work for me.  It felt anti-climactic and a bit worn in my estimation.<br /><br />While it was largely an entertaining read, it wasn't anything special.  It falls into the category of beach-type read for me and one that will go the way of other suspense novels that get read and forgotten within a few days or weeks.<br /><br />Maybe my expectations were too high but it didn't meet them.  Not a bad book and definitely much better written than many suspense books I have read, but it wasn't anything truly special.  Between a 3 and a 4 star rating for me but I settled on a 3 since it didn't stand out from other books in the genre.

0765365278|5.0|I must admit to being a fan of Brandon Sanderson since the I read the Mistborn series.  This book did not disappoint.  Sanderson tells compelling stories with intricate plot lines focused on multiple characters.  Each character is multi-faceted and very real in their own ways.  Sanderson uses the plot and the characters to drive home deeper points on leadership, culture, history and even sanity.<br /><br />Overall this is a great read and I would recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />_________________<br />Note about the Kindle edition on Amazon. I bought this so I could re-read on my kindle.  It appears to be abridged from my paper edition.  The story goes on,  but some wonderful and entirely relevant subtext has been taken out.  Wit, Dalinar, Szeth and others are shortchanged.  It's a tragic loss and I feel like Amazon owes me an explanation.

B000B8QG4A|3.0|I love this movie! I remember watching this movie since I was a kid. You might ask me why I gave this only three stars? It's because when it finaly arrived at my house, I got a cheep version of this dvd. I was disappointed when Disney Studios took the Platinum Edition dvd of Lady and the Tramp out of print and in to the vault. But I found out that the dvd was being sold here on Amazon, and I was thrilled when I bought it. I waited two weeks for the dvd to come until it finally came. I was happy it came, but when I opened the box, I found out that it was obviously a fake! I looked at the comparisons between the dvd covers, and the colors didn't match at all. Also, the words on the back of it looked all messed up and weird. Even the two dvds inside didn't look right; the colors on the top of the first disk were all funky to. I got even more pissed off when I watch the movie itself, and the movie looked like as if I was watching the movie on a VHS tape. The only good thing about the dvd was the bonus disc, which did have the bonus features, and they had good picture quality as well.<br /><br />It's not the dvds fault, but it is Amazon's and the seller's fault. The seller must have been (and I'm not trying to be racist, but if I am, I am deeply sorry) someone from the middle east. The dvd looked like as if the dvd cover, companion booklet, and the disks were poorly printed out by the seller. Excuse me for my language, but I think it's BULL! Thankfully, I bough the new dvd version of Lady and the Tramp On March 23. I would have got the Blu-ray version, but I don't have that much money to afford a Blu-ray player and Blu-ray dvds. I gonna try and contact the seller and try and get a refund, or at least a replacement to get the real dvd set. Hopfully it will happen and I might get the real dvd set. I love Lady and the Tramp, and hopefully I'll get a decent dvd of this wonderful movie!

B007IQX1G4|1.0|This movie literally has no point. The main character starts off with a pathetic, shallow life. Despite everything she goes through in the movie she learns nothing and ends exactly as she started, sad and shallow. I just sat there stunned afterwards that anything could be such a complete and utter waste of time. Awful.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|The Maze Runner was a great book!  There are lots of exciting moments and dry humor throughout the story.  The characters are terrific.  The story is well written with twists and turns that keep you guessing thoughout the entire book!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I was wary of downloading this, even as the FAotD, due to the numerous reviews stating that it force closes on the Kindle Fire after a few minutes of gameplay.  I found this not to be the case -- the app runs just fine.<br /><br />This game kept me amused far longer than one would expect from a simple element-type puzzle app.  The combinations are creative and mostly logical, although I must confess to clicking the hint icon more than a few times.  There are additional bonuses with this app besides the main game, and they add to the fun.  This is a cool little app which I highly recommend.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|The Scorch Trials was an exciting book from start to finish.  The story keeps you guessing the entire way through.  There were several scary parts that made this book a terrific read!  This was my favorite book out of the three.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This solitaire game is legit! Other than a quick screenshot ad before each game (that you can quickly skip), this app has everything for a casual solitaire player. Nice background choices, card backs, and gameplay options. Highly addictive!  I play this more than most of the paid apps I bought.
B004LWZW7E|1.0|To start things off I watched the movie \\"In Time\\" because I thought that the premise looked interesting. It may have looked interesting but the movie itself has got to be one of the worst movies ever! The acting is terrible with the exception of Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins, Inception, and Red Eye). I thought that Justin Timberlake just wasn't believable. For example, He showed emotions but they were the wrong emotions for the wrong scenes. (SPOILER ALERT)When Will's mom died it looked like he was laughing instead of crying. In another scene where he's talking to Sylvia he says how he will make them (The Rich) pay for the loss of his mom. That line alone is just a hilarious line(Unintentionally) worthy of being in a comedy, not a so-called sci-fi thriller. Also let me talk about the action. The action sequences were few with the few shootouts (and an unbelievably fake car crash) that there were looked cheesy due to the fact that the guns looked unbelievably fake. I might also add to the fact that in one scene Will Salas says that he wants to balance out the system so that the poor are just like the rich. He's saying that he wants everybody to be equal. Know what does that sound like to you.  You guessed it Communism. So in conclusion Andrew Niccol (The Director, Writer, and producer) put in his movie recipe communism, a dash of socialism, cheesy looking guns, bad acting(except for Cillian), and of course some sexual situations, and some strong language. So should you see this movie? If you want to be tortured than be my guest but don't say I didn't warn you.
0061120073|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is one of my favorite books of all time. It touched my heart in the same way that Angela's Ashes did. To immerse yourself in the childhood tribulations and joys of a time when life was positively brutal in many ways...it makes you appreciate the society we now live in, flaws and all. Wonderful!
B002ZG977Y|1.0|I thought that \\"Clash of the Titans\\" was so unintentionally funny. The fact that Sam Worthington's character had a shape up and also the fact that the storyline was so predictable that five minutes into it I knew exactly what was going to happened. This movie was riot, if you want to laugh a lot than rent this hilarious movie.<br />Storyline: F-<br />Special Effects: D-<br />Action: F<br />Acting: F+<br />Laughs: A+
B0072GPPNC|5.0|I thought War Horse was a great movie. The movie should have recieved a Oscar. I loved the movie. I cryed at the end.
B003EYVXV4|5.0|The Hunger Games is a movie that is very powerful. It isn't just about teens killing teens. In fact the actual \\"games\\" don't occur in the movie until about 75 minutes into it (the movie is a 142 minutes long). I haven't read the books but I want to after watching this great movie. One of the reasons why I like this movie is because of the great acting performances by Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson.  The scenery is also really beautiful (Like the woods). The action scenes are good and the costume design is Oscar worthy. So what are the downs? None really except I wouldn't take anybody younger than 13 to see this movie mostly because of the teen-on-teen violence. The movie doesn't glorify violence in fact most of the violence is implied except for a couple of scenes (A boy gets his neck snapped,  A girl gets her neck snapped as well, there's a couple gory wounds and blood on people. Still I was surprised by how much I liked \\"The Hunger Games\\" and you too might be surprised!
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|It's hard to say whether I liked the Swedish or the American version better. I liked the casting in the American version better. I especially liked Robin Wright in her role. You got more of Lisbeth Salander's role in the American version.<br /><br />What I don't get in the American version is the twist with Harriet Vanger. It was sort of missing here. I was confused. I was expecting a trip to Australia not a return trip to London. What happened to Anita Vanger who helped Harriet escape to Australia???<br /><br />Also I think Lisbeth got her revenge better in the Swedish version. I had to squint to read what was written on the guy in the American version.<br /><br />My vote goes for the Swedish version as being better overall.

B006XBSAP2|5.0|Katy Perry's thrid album, Teenage Dream, Is a amazing piece of music about Surviving heartbreak, forming a bound between you and \\"The one\\" having fun, All while trying to stay young. Though perry herself is 27, I believe she made this album to remind everyone that they can still have \\"Young love\\" No matter how old they are. (I'm listening to the CD right know as I write!) Here is a song by song guide to My favorite album:<br />Part one: Teenage dream<br />Teenage dream: The first one on the album, It is very catchy and very sweet. The song amazing ever time you listen to it, with sweet, smooth pop. May be a little much for some, but the tune worked well for me and my radio that is probably one thousand years old. (9.5/10)<br /><br />Last Friday night ( T.G.I.F) The lyrics are a bit odd, but it's a catchy song that wants to make you get up and dance.(9.5/10)<br /><br />Californa gurls feat. Snoop Dog: You've probably heard this song a billion times on the radio, and has a absolute resion for it! It's SO catchy and stays in your head all day! Love it! (10/10)<br /><br />Firework: I really, really, wanted to like this song, but I feel like it needed a little more 'Sparkle', if you know what I mean. The lyrics<br /><br /> are still amazing, though, and I look foward to listening to it after a bad day. (9/10)<br /><br />Peacock: SKIP...... Just another pop filler.<br /><br />Circle the drain: Rock song of the album. Very strong and encouraging song that makes you want to cheer for Perry's honest lyrics (10/10)<br /><br />The one that got away: \\"In another life/ I would make you stay/ So I don't have to say you were/ the one that got away.\\" Sad stuff,<br />huh? This song is just as catchy as it is meaningful, and I bet lots of girls could relate. (10/10)<br /><br />E.T: So mysterious and intelligent, you'll love it instantly, and I'm SO glad that they took out that cheesy rap verse that ruined the whole song. (10/10)<br /><br />Who am I living for?: Whoah, slow down, girl! Perry tried way to hard on her vocals, and I could hardly listen to it, but I still<br />appericiated her efforts (8/10)<br /><br />Pearl: I heard rumors about this one, but I ignorned them and just listened to the song. And wow, I'm glad I did. The message i<br />strong and touching, and Perry sounds beautiful. My new favorite (10/10)<br /><br />Hummingbird heartbeat. I admit that I wanted not to like this song, but I love it. The songs a warm, easy to relate companion to 'Teenage dream' (10/10)<br /><br />Not like the movies: The strong message is a quirky compian to the soothing melody. This one is Perry's best vocals. ANOTHER<br />one of my favorite.(10/10)<br /><br />Part number two: The complete confection<br /><br />Part of me: Wow, this song blew me away!!! 'Part of me' is the perfect breakup anthem with it's 'I'm fine without you' message.<br />(By the way, contrary to  popular beliefs, this was NOT written for Katy's ex, Russel brand) 10/10<br /><br />Wide awake: Love this one! The lyrics are soft yet powerful, and I like the instrumental. Bet this one will be a hit in no time! (9.5/10)<br /><br />Dressin' up: I feel terrible for liking this one, but I do! The theme is 'Grown-up games', and lyrics are well.... Listen to song to see for your self! (9.5/10)<br /><br />ET ft. Kayne West: I'm not a fan of Kayne West. That's all I can say. (3/10)<br /><br />Last Friday night (T.G.I.F) ft.Missy Elliote. LOVE this one! Katy does her usual good job, but Missy Elliote stole the show! (10/10)<br /><br />Tommie Sunshine Mega mix: A remix between Teenage dream, The one that got away, Last Friday night (T.G.I.F), firework, and, most memorable, California girls. Fun, but a bit jumpy. (8.5/10)
0451169514|4.0|I recently got around to Stephen King's mammoth 1987 horror thriller, \\"It\\", which inexplicably this longtime King fan had never cracked open until now.  Well, I shouldn't say \\"inexplicably\\", because I'm sure it had something to do with that adjective \\"mammoth\\" combined with an adjective I often use to describe myself: \\"lazy\\".  Anyway, I finally got to the book and I liked it, often quite a bit.<br /><br />I didn't love it, however, finding it to be the first King story I've read that didn't fully justify its generous length.  It was also peppered with a few elements that sort of annoyed and/or frustrated me, again a new thing for me with King.<br /><br />But first let me be a gentleman and list a few of the many things I liked about this tale of seven kids who take on an elemental evil hiding out in the sewers of a Maine town in 1958 and then come together as adults in the 1980's to take it on again.  I liked the characterizations of the kids, who were sympathetic and interestingly complex, and the way King makes it clear that the ways children are raised inarguably have impacts on their personalities that will follow them for the rest of their lives.  I liked the individuals scenes of horror, which are effective, scary, and imaginative.  I enjoyed comparing the personalities of the kids with the personalities of their grown-up counterparts.<br /><br />I also cheered during the many scenes depicting heartless, cruel people in power finally getting their due from the people they regularly victimized and abused. Scenes involving an abusive husband in the modern-day scenes and a horrible bully in the 1950's part of the story immediately come to mind, and there are a couple of other satisying confrontations along those lines, too.  And these have little or nothing to do with the horror story at hand; they're just an added bonus.<br /><br />Now, what aspects of the book didn't wow me as much?  The story is constructed so that we continually jump back and forth between the kids battling the creature known as \\"It\\" in the 1950's and their re-match with \\"It\\" in the 1980's.  Because both stories happen simultaneously throughout the entire book and we cut back and forth between them, momentum and drama never really build up in each individual timeline, at least as much as they otherwise could.  Also, King comes up with (I thought) contrived reasons for the 1980's versions of the characters to not talk to one another about, or even think about, their original 1950's battle, so as not to spoil things for the reader (for one thing, think \\"mysterious memory loss\\").<br /><br />I also thought the exact nature of what was going on in both battles was ultimately murky, having something to do with a battle of wills on a higher plane of existence, but nothing I could better get my hands around.  The weird, godlike turtle creature sitting on the sidelines didn't exactly help matters in that regard.<br /><br />Finally, all of this- the first battle, the second battle, the individual lives of the characters as kids and as adults- was frequently interrupted by long history lessons about the town of Derry, Maine, the setting of both epic battles (the earthbound parts of them, anyway).  The Derry history sections are actually kind of interesting, often detailing horrendous occurrences that the \\"It\\" entity instigated, emotionally fed on, or both.  But in a story that was already of epic length, I wonder if the information in those sections couldn't have been communicated via briefer mechanisms.<br /><br />In the end, Stephen King is too talented a writer to not realize exactly what he was doing when he delivered an 1,100-plus page book about a bunch of kids taking on a creepy clown (the monster's preferred form of corporeal existence).  Perhaps after being burned by his publishers years before, who made him cut tens of thousands of words from his original draft of \\"The Stand\\", Mr. King decided to use the clout he eventually earned to write another epic story and make it as long as he saw fit, emphasizing- without interference this time- the immersive experience over pacing and conciseness.<br /><br />If the results are a little self-indulgent and well... long, so what?  It's not like the author writes this way all the time.  In my view, 95% of the time Stephen King's books are exactly as long as they need to be, so what's the harm if an otherwise fairly solid King novel, just this once, gives us a couple of hundred pages more carnage, characterization, and details than we actually need?  Or, in his zeal to be truly \\"out there\\" in some of the cosmic confrontations, we mutter a \\"huh?\\" from time to time?  Small sins, gentle reader, small sins.<br /><br />In the end, for me at least, I guess that creepy clown with the sharp teeth pulled this sometimes flawed, sometimes lumbering epic over the finish line.tory and make it as long as he saw fit, emphasizing- without interference this time- the immersive experience over pacing and conciseness.<br /><br />If the results are a little self-indulgent and well... long, so what?

B007IQX1G4|5.0|I don't know what to say about this movie.  It blew me away on so many different levels.<br /><br />I would say that if you are expecting a comedy that you might not enjoy this, I did not laugh once during this movie, but several times I gasped, and cringed, and at one moment which pretty much hit me out of left-field I straight-up cried like a baby.<br /><br />This movie is beautiful.  No other word fits.<br /><br />Charlize Theron and Patton Oswalt don't just give good performances, they give legendary performances.  I am talking like Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca.<br /><br />This movie is destined to be a timeless classic.  I had to watch it over again right away.  I just could not let it end.<br /><br />Charlize Theron is the greatest actress of all time.  I mean since the art of acting was like invented.<br /><br />I never like movies this much.  This is like beyond the movies.  It's real art.  A real masterpiece on all levels.  The writer, director and lead actress are all at the top of their game.  This is the kind of film that reminds of why movies can be so magical.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey's Wool is an engaging look at a bleak future.  Survivors endure in a confined environment where behavior is orchestrated according to a playbook left by those who destroyed the world.  The main characters emerge from the backdrop of a mostly clueless society with an increasing desperation to escape a past that repeats itself.  The plot develops at a steady pace with characters that draw you into the story.  Whether you immerse yourself for a long continuous read or extend the experience a chapter at a time, Wool will capture your imagination and keep you wanting more.  I really enjoyed this book and look forward to a continuing adventure.

B000UZNRS2|4.0|I read mysteries to be held in suspense and occassionally surprised by the author. David Baldacci has a knack for both. The Camel Club is a well worn plot that is beginning to show it's age, but that being said the characters and plot still hold up and the book is tough to put down. He still has the ability to keep you wondering what is going to happen next!

B006AX6ONI|5.0|I loved this book. I left the corporate world in 2001 after being downsized by my employer . I worked at the company for 25 years and it was gone in an instant...I know....familiar story. I was over 55 and lost. I decided to start my own internet retail outlet and, thankfully,  have been very successful . I learned many hard lessons along the way and reading this book I felt a kin-ship to everything Mark says about business. I wish I had read this book BEFORE I started my business....I may have avoided some of the potholes along the way. Anyhow I think every young business student and as far as that goes every business owner want-a-bee or even every person thinking about starting a business MUST read this book. I am going to get my 20 year old business school student daughter to read it. I am sure it will help her.
B001ECE6C6|5.0|As controversial as it might have raised a storm of discontent among some, personally, I'd rather find this a wonderful mixture of Pat's whimsical sound and Anna Maria Jopek's pensive and ethereal vocal that echoes melancholy of the ancient Europe, the Poland of the romantic Frederic Chopin! I was totally charmed by Maria's voice accompanied by Pat's picasso guitar in that folksy Here Comes The Silent Dusk (Cichy Zapada Zmrok), the new rendition of Another Life (Me Jedyne Niebo) from that very dark intro (Bm - Gm) with Berimbau-like synth SFX, the haunting guitar of Polish Paths (Polskie Drogi) or the slavic mood of Whiteness (Biel). As Pat's faithful fan, Upojenie deserves its high place in my collection of Pat's work!<br />You can also find more critic's review here: [...]
B00756GRUE|4.0|Bought this Seiko watch for it's Solar power and 200 meter water proof capability.  Gave this a 4 star becasue I thought the 24 hour dial could be set separately for GMT or Zulu time but was surprised that it just follows the main dial to tell if the main time was AM or PM.  It's an OK watch for just telling time.  But I'll have to look for other real dive functionality capable watch.<br />Other than that, it's a Seiko that I know has quality and durability.

0525478817|5.0|Cancer sucks.<br />The world is not a wish-giving factory.<br />Sometimes the most we can hope for is not to be an astronaut, or save people from fires, or writing amazing philosphical (Filosoofikal)books, but to be okay.<br /><br />Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters both suffer/have suffered from Cancer. Cancer has changed and defined their lives so that who they were or who they could have been is almost obliterated.<br /><br />Yet oxygen-tank-bound Hazel and leg/former basketball star life-missing Augustus find each other at a cancer support group and begin helping each other be okay.<br /><br />They discuss poetry, and philosophy, and one, important book that Hazel has come to love. The book is about a girl with cancer and ends abruptly mid-sentence with no resolution for the characters. Augustus uses his one, Wish Foundation wish to wisk them to Amsterdam to confront the reclusive author so he can tell Hazel what happened to the ending. But the author isn't exactly what Hazel expected, and neither is the end result of the trip.<br /><br />There's a lot to unpack in a John Green novel. Hazel and Augustus are wordly wise beyond their years, they drop quotes and heavy philosophy at the drop of a hat. And yet I don't care that they don't sound like true teenagers all the time. This story isn't about gritty realism (although boy did I learn a lot about different kinds of cancer and treatments and the effect of said treatments) but about search for meaning in the face of great pain and suffering.<br /><br />For me, the conversations Hazel and Augustus have are ways for even non-cancer survivors to contextualize our place in a seemingly callous world. What conclusions you draw from these characters' journey isn't tainted by the fact that I have never known a teenager so erudite.<br /><br />Definitely worth reading.<br /><br />This Book's Snack Rating: Hawaiian Kettle Wasabi Chips for the satisfying crunch of interesting characters you care about with the painful bite of cancer and mortality that makes your eyes water even as you race to the end of the bag.cancer and mortality that makes your eyes water even as you race to the end of the bag.
B003CYKCHW|5.0|It is the mouse.<br /><br />I saw the latest Cyborg R.A.T. 9 mouse, but I was like \\"Paying $150 for a mouse is stupid.\\"<br />Then I thought \\"What does their least expensive model look like?\\" I bought it because it looks cool, but it works even better than it looks. First off it is a very high quality piece of kit. The construction reminds me of my RC10T radio controlled racing truck. An aluminum frame with RIM parts. The braided cord is long, flexible and looks tough. Although it looks chunky the ergonomics are excellent (I have a Masters in ergonomics). I like that one can adjust the up-down and left-right sensitivity separately. The wheel rolls nicely with little detents that make changing weapons in games much more positive. One bump and you have the next gun, no more back and forth until you land on the one you wanted. Adjusting the dpi of the mouse on the fly is very useful. I set it to 2400 dpi (800,1200,2400,3600) and slow down the mouse response slider in Windows and games. It is highly responsive without being twitchy. I can check doorways and corners in Call of Duty really quickly. If you like, one can speed up the response for running around and slow it down for aiming. I don't bother to do that. Where I find it really useful is in PhotoShop. When I want to do fine detail I lower the mouse dpi with the toggle switch behind the wheel. I especially like the thumb-rest 'wing' on the left side. It keeps your thumb from dragging on the mouse pad. The position of the two thumb buttons is perfect. I don't really find the programmable button useful. I would always start a game in Windows mode and find things were not working properly, so I set it to default and forget it. If you play a game with lots of inputs you may have a use for that feature.<br /><br />My only complaint is the Teflon under the mouse is kind of thin. I had MOUSE SKATES under my old mouse and they were much nicer.<br />I have a kick-ass mouse now and I had to get a kick-ass mouse pad to do itjustice. No Biggie.<br /><br />The bottom line is in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, I was never that good, but I loved to play anyway. My gamer tag was 'Joe Target'.<br />After a week with the R.A.T.3 I changed my tag to 'Fearless Leader'.<br /><br />Nuff said.
B007MJSSCY|4.0|Being a fan of Downton Abbey, I was attracted to this movie when I saw the names of 2 cast members, Maggie Smith and Hugh Bonneville.  I was also intrigued that the writer of this film is the same person who created Downton Abbey.<br /><br />This film is set in an old manor in Great Britain near the end of World War II.  A teenage boy, Tolly, comes to stay with his grandmother, who lives in the manor.  At the beginning, Tolly questions his grandmother about portraits of family members long past.  From that point on, he has quite an adventure.<br /><br />If you want to know more, you'll have to wait for other reviews or just watch the movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|nice to c a new version and not a rehash!<br />my 3y old has mastered the other versions so this should b fun to watch with gravity messing with her!
B007BVOF8E|1.0|Rarely do I watch a movie and find after the first 30 minutes that I haven't a clue to what's going on.  My wife and I were both watching this.  At the 30 minute point I asked her if she was as lost as I was.  I was relieved to find I wasn't alone.<br /><br />After reading the wide variety of reviews, good and bad, it's clear that some people did like this movie.  To me, the trailer was a little misleading because it made more sense than what I saw during the first 30 minutes of the film.<br /><br />If you feel you must watch this movie, you should probably read the book first and then try the movie.  I am sorry I rented this one.

1741798981|5.0|Although I've vacationed in England several times, I've never been to London proper. On each of my trips, I flew into Gatwick airport, avoiding busy Heathrow, picked up a rental car (right-hand drive, manual transmission and motoring on the \\"wrong\\" side of the road--what fun!) and immediately set out for the countryside. My destinations included aviation, automobile and military museums, breweries, Stonehenge (of course) and \\"off the beaten path\\" attractions throughout southern England and, via the Channel Tunnel on one trip, in northern France. I gave London a wide berth simply because I generally prefer to avoid congested, chaotic, hard-to-get-around-in major cities. However, I realize that, by skirting London, I missed a great deal of what the country has to offer. So the city is on my \\"must-see\\" list for my next vacation to England, whenever that might be. In the meantime, I'll travel there from my armchair using Lonely Planet's outstanding \\"London\\" city guide.<br /><br />Some of the recent Lonely Planet guidebooks I've gotten through the Amazon Vine program have been unimpressive, and have even inspired me to offer editorial comments about how good they used to be compared with how they are now. But \\"London\\" is an exception. This is a really good guidebook. Although I lack the first-hand experience with the city to say how accurate or comprehensive it is, I can say for sure that it is attractive, colorful, extremely well organized and exceptionally easy to use. It has a lot of features that I really like. For example:<br /><br />-- All the maps are found together in the last 45 pages--that's in addition to the larger pull-out city map bound inside the back cover.<br /><br />-- The city's vast area is organized into 10 neighborhoods, each of which gets from 15 to more than 60 color-coded pages of detailed information on attractions, restaurants, lodging, cultural activities, shopping, entertainment, drinking and nightlife, and so on.<br /><br />-- Many \\"Top Sights\\" sidebars are scattered throughout, set off by eye-catching blue headings, in addition to the main text. Each offers a \\"Practicalities\\" listing of such things as the page number of the relevant map, website, physical address, admission fee, hours of operation and Tube stop. These are really handy and easy to use.<br /><br />-- The detailed floor plans of such places as the British Museum, the Tower of London, St. Paul's Cathedral and the Victoria & Albert Museum are pretty cool.<br /><br />-- The balance between text and photos tilts heavily toward text. This is not a \\"picture book.\\" The sparse photos in it are relevant to the text but of secondary importance. Stretches of 30 or 40 pages with nary a photo may put off some readers, but I prefer information to pretty pictures.<br /><br />-- A very nice and highly informative 50-page-plus \\"Understand London\\" section covers modern London, its history, architecture, literature, theatre, dance, art, fashion, music and film. This is an excellent capsule summary that puts what you'll see there into the proper historical and cultural perspective.<br /><br />Lonely Planet's \\"London\\" is an outstanding guidebook that will be one of the first things I stick into my backpack the next time I catch an airliner bound for England.ts\\" sidebars are scattered throughout, set off by eye-catching blue headings, in addition to the main text.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|I thought it was quite good but frankly I have seen this story before. Think of \\"Running Man\\" or \\"Logan's Run\\" or \\"The Island\\" (a remake of Logan's run really) with bits from \\"1984\\" and \\"Brave New World\\" added in to the mix. The main difference here (and the most disturbing part of the society depicted) is that the people doing the dying are children.<br /><br />For me, only 3-stars given I have seen this story before as I mentioned above. Few new twists here beyond the kids really.
B0026WNGBA|5.0|Great book.  I'm almost thru it & there's a lot of good info.  I'm looking to improve my running & this will be it.

B005EWDA9M|5.0|Beautiful style, feels like its gently massaging your brain. Story is mind-blowing with so many layers. Recommend very warmly[[ASIN:B005EWDA9M 1Q84: Books 1 and 2]]
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A book that everyone can truly enjoy reading!  My Husband even read this book!!  That really is amazing if you knew him at all.  We have been married 16 years and this is only the 2nd book I have got him to read with me.  And he read all 3 with my 2 daughters and myself.  We all just loved it!!  It captures you from the start and you can hardly put it down.<br /><br />Twists and turns that keep you guessing until the very last page.  This is the kind of book that really makes a child that has trouble reading become so interested they just can't help themselves and keep turning the pages.
1856697525|5.0|For all the people who have given this book poor reviews... \\"What the heck is wrong with you?\\"<br /><br />It is expensive to be sure, but the writing is clear, the pictures and layout are brilliant.<br /><br />If you are into graphic design, this is the needy, needy, greedy, greedy must have.<br /><br />Basically, ever page you look at his designs, you can only think, \\"I suck.\\"
1451627289|5.0|The 50th anniversary is coming up! I do think the book could have been %25-%40 shorter. That said, I have read and seen many \\"Save JFK\\" Time Travel stories and this one is the best one out there!
B002BWP49C|2.0|I know I am not the film's target audience. Whoever the filmmakers are, they are not making the \\"Twilight\\" saga for a forty-something male, who is not a big fan of the vampire / romance genre. But when Bill Condon, director of such films as \\"Gods and Monsters\\" \\"Kinsey\\" and \\"Dreamgirls\\" is to helm \\"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn,\\" I hoped things might be a bit different. Plus, the film's photography is by Guillermo Navarro, Oscar winner for \\"Pan's Labyrinth.\\"<br /><br />So, having watched \\"Part 1\\" of the two-part finale of the franchise, I still don't know what to say about it. Though I don't think the film is as terrible as some critics say, the film often feels like a long and slow warm-up for the next installment, which I hope will be full of action. Well, in short, I thought \\"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn\\" was pretty boring.<br /><br />The film takes nearly two hours to tell us what can be told in one hour (as Amazon's editorial review has neatly summarized). Edward and Bella marry, but a human-vampire marriage is not all romantic and sweet. Not a bad story, but more hints as to what is to come, or some subtexts under the melodramatic romance would have been of great help in interesting us, fans or non-fans of the series, in the drama between the married couple.<br /><br />We are also given chances to see the CG werewolves fighting, but not much, and the visual quality is at best acceptable. The subplot about Jacob and his clan, which could have been more interesting than the main plot, is sidelined by the birth scene that would seem very horrid to some. Technically the film is competent, and considering the drawn-out storyline, uninspired dialogue and bland acting from some, if not all, players, Bill Condon did a pretty good job as director.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|I love this app!<br />you can shrink the size of your notes or keep them the size you write them. If you use evernote you can attach it with ease. I also like that you can just write anywhere on the screen. (another app only lets you write within a small box which I found annoying)<br />cons- it is a tad bit slow if you are taking handwritten notes for a meeting or class but not enough to deter the use of it.
B00005JKG9|5.0|I always like movies that focus on realism, and this was an excellent example, showing the levels of lying, cheating, and deceit that men will stoop to when under deep stress.  Jack Lemmon played his part extremely well, and Al Pacino turned in his customary masterful performance.  In fact, the whole cast did superbly.<br /><br />Thank heaven the producers didn't ham the picture up with some stupid love affair as the central theme for once.<br /><br />Although not for the squeamish types, this film keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat from start to finish, so to speak, due to the outstanding acting on every man's part.
B0071WQ7WU|2.0|I'm Reviewing this CD after only a single listening.  I should give it more attention, but I don't think it deserves it.<br />If you like Nickelback style pop-metal then maybe you will love this.  I don't.<br />I enjoyed the previous 3 studio releases but this one falls flat for me.  Sorry guys.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I haven't bought this app yet but it looks awesome so I will I think it will be awesome because the birds are superheroes.
B006MGC3VK|5.0|I haven't found flaw with this album. This is just what I expected from OSI and it's great music.  If you liked the previous releases I think you'll appreciate this one too.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game!  It is so easy and challenging at the same time.  I stay up at night playing it. So glad I downloaded it to my kindle fire.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|\\"Defending Jacob\\" is the best legal thriller I have read in years. As intelligently written as it is, be aware that this story does not play by the rules. Which makes it all the more riveting... that the DA's own son faces murder charges is just the beginning of the fascinating juxtaposition this story creates; posing moral and ethical issues, psychological questions, legal battles, and the question of how far one will go when torn between deep parental love and suspicion of their own child... especially when fighting for justice is that parent's passion and livlihood.<br /><br />The distinction between what or who is good or bad is so blurry in this story, that probably every reader comes away with a different viewpoint.<br /><br />It makes you think. And THAT's a good book.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|The author provides practical insights that have changed my life. Simple to follow yet profound. Traditional wisdom that crosses the boundaries of culture and belief.
1594744769|5.0|I had no clue what this book was about when I picked it up. I was afraid it was going to be about the WW II death camps. So glad I was wrong!<br /><br />Told from the POV of a teenage boy, it was well written, creative, and had excellent suspense; just enough to keep me intrigued and eager to find out what happened.<br /><br />I just really enjoyed it. Maybe it was a bit hard to see all the detail of the images on my Kindle, but I didn't mind, the story was really unique. Very peculiar indeed!
B005723JSQ|5.0|Every Sophie Kinsella (or Madeleine Wickham) book I read, I love. I'm only half way through \\"I've Got Your Number\\" and I'm addicted and loving Poppy. It's always funny, entertaining and keeps you wanting to know what happens next!
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|This album may be Shinedown's best yet.  I am torn between this and the \\"Sound of Madness\\".  Either way, a very close race between the two.<br /><br />Amaryllis has a refreshingly different and creative sound in comparison to SOM, which at the moment is why it rates much higher on my list.<br /><br />Adrenaline - 3/5 - The \\"Devour\\" of Amaryllis, yet far superior to \\"Devour\\", in my opinion.  Not my favorite song off the album, but a solid opening track.<br /><br />Bully - 4.5/5 - A phenomenal first single.  Incredibly catchy with well written lyrics.  This song seems kind of like the \\"Second Chance\\" of this album.<br /><br />Amaryllis - 5/5 - The chorus of this song is so amazing, it easily warrants the song a 4.5.  The verse's however just don't seem to mesh with the chorus.<br /><br />Unity - 5/5 - An absolutely beautiful power ballad with a wonderful message (and a phenomenal music video).  This one could be a HUGE radio hit!<br /><br />Enemies - 4.5/5 - An amazing rocker!  LOVE this song!<br /><br />I'm Not Alright- 3/5 - I love the verse's of this song, but the chorus of this song sounds like a Nickelback rip-off.  A rather weak song on a great album.<br /><br />Nowhere Kids - 3.5/5 - A solid, average rocker.<br /><br />Miracle - 5/5 - Another beautiful ballad with amazing radio potential.  The verse's of this song are particularly amazing.  Love this song!<br /><br />I'll Follow You - 4/5 - This is a very different sound for Shinedown, and I like it.  It's a bit jazzy, with a great chorus.  Not my favorite song on the album, but a great (and very different) song regardless!<br /><br />For My Sake - 5/5 - Hands down one of THE BEST songs if not the absolute best of the album.  This is how you do hard rock.  Wow.  I am still blown away by this song.<br /><br />My Name (Wearing me out) - 4.5/5 - Another very strong harder song!  This song has somewhat of an old \\"Three Days Grace\\" vibe to it.<br /><br />Through The Ghost - 5/5 - Another one of the best from the album.  A more than worthy successor to \\"Call Me\\".  Another mind blowing track on one of Shinedown's best releases yet.<br /><br />Bottom line - if you are a fan of Shinedown or Hard Rock, this album is a MUST buy.  It is creative, unique, and the rock album of the year.  This one will be hard to top!
B0034G4P4O|4.0|A wonderful adventure tale that should make all but the most purist of Tintin fans happy. Spielberg acquired the rights to Tintin after creator Herge's death in 1983 but a number of issues delayed the creation of this film until now. The tale is engaging and well fitted for all ages as Tintin and his allies search for a legendary treasure trove. The clue with the scrolls was nicely done and the camera angles impressed me in adding to the tale. A few of the solutions to their jams were clever and humorous, especially the one on the plane with Captain Haddock and the lose of plane fuel. The twin detectives were more amusing than expected and the villain looked a little like Spielberg to me but I think that was just coincidence, right? Spielberg directed and Peter Jackson was one of the producers. Spielberg intended this an \\"Indiana Jones for kids\\" and that's about right. \\"Great Snakes!\\" and \\"Fresh Water Politicians!\\" this is one you don't want to miss, people. The $135M budget grossed over $373M at the Box Office (Wiki source). The Golden Globes gave it Best Animated Feature Film and it won a host of other awards.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; ANIMATION: A minus to A; CINEMATOGRAPHY/ANGLES: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: A minus; HUMOR: B; STAYS TRUE ENOUGH TO THE TINTIN TALES: B plus; ACTION SCENES: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: end of March 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus.<br /><br />BEST DIALOGUE (possible spoilers): TinTin: Great Snakes!//// Fresh water politicians!/// As I embrace the Big Blue!/// [from trailer] [in a plane] Captain Haddock: You do know what you're doing, right?  Tintin: Relax. I interviewed a pilot once!  /// Captain Haddock: I thought you were an optimist. Tintin: You were wrong, weren't you? I'm a realist. Captain Haddock: Ah, it's just another name for a quitter. Tintin: You can call me what you like. Don't you get it? We failed. Captain Haddock: Failed. There are plenty of others willing to call you a failure. A fool. A loser. Ahopeless souse. Don't you ever say it of yourself. You send out the wrong signal, that is what people pick up. Don't you understand? You care about something, you fight for it. You hit a wall, you push through it. There's something you need to know about failure, Tintin. You can never let it defeat you.  //// Thomson: [looks at the newspaper] Great Scotland Yard! That's extraordinary! Tintin: What is? Thomson: Worthington's having a half-price sale on bowler hats! Inspector Thompson: [snatches the newspaper] Really, Thomson! This is hardly the time... [looks at the newspaper] Inspector Thompson: Great Scotland Yard!<br />Thomson, Tintin: What is it? Inspector Thompson: Canes are half-price too!  //// Tintin: Great snakes!  /// Captain Haddock: Billions of blistering barnacles!  /// Captain Haddock: Ten thousand thundering typhoons!  /// Captain Haddock: What is this peculiar beverage? It had no bouquet, it's completely transparent. Tintin: It's water.
1469984202|5.0|I was perusing Amazon trying to find a new book or series, so I sorted my preferred genre by reviews. Wool was at the top of the list. The price is so good there really isn't a reason not to try it.<br /><br />I was hooked right away and remained that way until the end. This dude can write. I didn't expect anything that would complete with my favorite books, but the Wool series quickly jumped to the top of the list. I looked to see if there were any books past Wool 5 and am kind glad there aren't - I need to get some work done :)<br /><br />Hopefully this isn't the end of the Wool series...

B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian Michaels puts out quality workout DVD's.  I love the 30-Day Shred and go through  the program.  Do something else.  And, then do it again.  I  never get tired of it.  You have to have at least an intermediate level of fitness for these workouts.  Even level one has some difficulty to it.<br /><br />Jillian uses different muscle groups at the same time to cut down on the workout time length.  I like that because I workout at home before work.  I don't always have time to work out for one hour or more.<br /><br />The modified moves are all done by one of the other girls in the DVD.  This makes it easy to do the exercises that may be difficult for you.<br /><br />All you need is a mat and a light set of hand weights and a small area and you're set.  I've gotten great results from this DVD set.
0545265355|5.0|I am only reviewing the outside contents (it is a present for my granddaughter).  Three colorful hard-bound books in a nice heavy gauge cardboard holder, that was also colorfully illustrated.  Item was vacuum sealed in plastic (I will let her unwrap it on her birthday).  Very happy with the quick shipping (less than 2 days)!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|addictive! lots of fun. I just wish it was easier to score points with downloading stuff. nonetheless its a nice variety of games
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|My friend and I are using Evernote to track our goals as well as our progress. we're also using the share feature to hold each other accountable. Great app!
B001TJV0L4|4.0|it's a decent movie, though not as good as hype lead me to believe but still better than most.<br /><br />though the main reason for the 1-star deduction is in the packaging<br />first off in case anyone is wondering why there are two seemingly identical 2-disc editions it is because the cheaper of the two (by about four dollars) is the Canadian version. now it appears the only real difference is that this version has some french on the packaging and has the french voice dub as an added feature (the english is still default and available for everything). I actually didn't look closely when I ordered it but it indeed shows it in the picture so I'm not going to deduct any stars for that (and since it is in region 1 there are no issues there either so if you want one of the 2-disc editions this would probably be the better choice) another thing was that the slipcover the dvd comes in has one of those \\"holographic films on it so that it makes the picture look sort of 3D in expense of it making the image incredibly blurry. it's kind of cool and since the inside cover is normal I have no complaints there either. what I do have a complaint with is the slip of paper inside the case that has the code on how to unlock the digital copy. the problem is that the code is expired, now I've had a few dvds with digital copies on them but it seems like only warner bros. actually makes the codes expire! it's not an orange for crying out loud! data doesn't go bad so why do they have it expired? heck the digital copy on Star Trek (a different company) had expired a year earlier but it still worked! I don't understand the point of making it expire! if it's advertised on the cover as a feature of the product it shouldn't just become defunct on a whim!<br /><br />still for the price the movie itself is good, if you don't mind a little bit of french on your cover you can get it for a steal at $6.48
B0063GORYU|5.0|LOVE IT!!!!!  So smooth to play and the auto play moves make it even more so!  If you like solitaire this is the game for you.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was hooked at Chapter 2.  Wonderfully written, terribly disturbing and incredibly romantic.  I hated it, I loved it, I was sad it was over...So many conflicting emotions but hands down one of my favorite series!  Thank you E.L. James.
B0018RWD1S|5.0|Great CD!!! If you are an Amy Winehouse fan this is a must have.Maybe this is not for minors to listen to but great for open mind adults!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it took a little bit but it rocks and I rearmed that everyone should play it the game (101 games in +1)
B004WR125O|4.0|I had reservations about ordering this due to all the folks who have written about their problems - and like so many others, I also have complications. I can't get a connection that rates above 51%, so it refuses to download the firmware update. I was going to return it, but the main reason I bought it was for the internet radio connection, and lo and behold, that works perfectly fine. Once it's buffered a station (which typically takes 5-15 seconds), it plays without hiccup. So, 4 stars overall since I have to do firmware upgrades via flash drive (which may be a safer way to do it anyways).<br /><br />I guess I should point out that my iMac, iPad and XBox all connect without issue to my wireless network, so it's troubling that this device has difficulty.
B00756GKBA|4.0|I just bought this album, listened once and I'm already in love with it !!!<br />she migh not be innovative in this one but she sounds GREAT ! the beat of the songs are 100% club and the energy is sublime, I really liked it a lot, except for a couple of songs, the whole album is really good, specially the ballads, I missed that part in the last album, but in this one, she sings so beautifully, those are my favorite tracks, and like most, Gang Bang is very addictive !<br /> Making NO regrets, (as usual) she exposes her soul and heart about her failed marriage and the strugles of her relationship.<br />Make no mistake, she's back to high energy music she's known for !!!
061891868X|5.0|Just a humble aerospace engineer here, no physics Phd.  This book seems to have offended a bunch of string theorists here, looking at the 1 star reviews.  No biggie.  Engineers tend to look down upon professionals who deliver nothing tangible, but it appears the sting is deeper when it comes from another academic.<br /><br />I don't have a dog in this fight, but I'm happy to read the books.  Keep em coming!  Maybe picking on the string folks will motivate them to get some results.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love the game,very addictive.  The ad free one is the way to go.<br />Cause the ads are a pain,when trying to shoot..Fun for everyone.

B000002VMD|5.0|The cd works good in every cd player we have. To look at it it looks as if we bought it brand new. The only thing is the shipping time was far to long. I would recomend to get faster shipping if possible.
B007LB1O3I|4.0|First of all, all Madonna fans and others need to realize that no new album from Madonna is ever going to match the \\"Epic\\" status of Ray of Light or Like A Prayer, so get over it.  Most artists are never able to out do themselves creatively after the height of there career has passed.  However, MDNA is a reminder that Madonna still has some tricks up her sleeve, and Madonna is still very much a relavent singer and artist who always strives to introduce a new sound and never stagnates with her music from album to album.<br />Great dance/electronica songs on MDNA are Girl Gone Wild (my favorite), Some Girls, I'm Addicted, and Turn Up The Radio.<br />A few great retro sounding tracks like I'm a Sinner, and Birthday Song.<br />A few beautiful Ballads including Love Spent, and Masterpiece.<br />Even a \\"post American Life\\" track called I don't give a f...\\" which adds even more diversity to this great album.<br />So bottom line, what ever era of Madonna you like, it's basically on this album, with a modern 2012 twist/angle.<br />Surprisingly for me, the only track I really didn't like is \\"Gang Bang\\", it's just too dark and ominous for me, but is reminiscent of her Erotica days.<br />So to sum it up, I give it a 4 stars out of 5, the only thing that prevented me from giving it 5 stars was I wish there would of been more club/dance songs, but like I said, there is a little of something for everybody on this album.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was so amazing! I am a teenager myself and I found the book to be engaging and real. Unlike most non-fiction novels this book took you someplace many wouldn't dare to. I found my self thinking of Katniss and Peeta before I went to sleep every night for at least 3 weeks. I thought about how lucky i am to be blessed with the comforts I have and how my biggest problems are nothing compared to Katiss and the rest of the districts. I knew it wasn't real, but my heart had a hard time believing it. To get there, your heart, the book has to be pretty damn good. This is a need to read novel. buy it.
1451627289|5.0|Everything about this novel hits the nail on the head for me. Well thought out characters, a story that could become cliche but manages to transcend, an ending that is not a crowd pleaser but makes a whole lot more sense then a possible happily ever after. While I see some complaining about the length of pacing of this book, they obviously are more likely to read the destroyer of American words books, James Patterson, then an actual important member of the American ouevre. Looking at King's book, the greats to me or the door stoppers, \\"It\\", \\"The Stand\\", \\"Needful Things\\"-give King the ability to write beyond 400 pages and you've got a masterpiece on your hands in my opinion. Having to pick what some would say is not what actually happened on that day in November would to some be a weakness but for me is a strength, I'm now committed to the idea that Oswald did it, indicating how strong King's writing is. Overall a highly recommended book for anyone who likes fiction and time travel.

0439023491|3.0|I found the first book contrived and too full of angst.  The second book is a bit better and a little less whiney, but it would have been nice if the book had concentrated a bit more on the revolution rather than contriving a way to put the same characters back into the hunger games.  OK reading if you don't think about it very hard.

0307949486|1.0|I wouldn't have read this is not for all the folks who were raving about it.  The title character is unlikeable and, to be frank, I couldn't give a damn what happens to her.  The plot is slow and plodding.  Unless you enjoy angst and misery, I can't think of a reason to waste your time with this Swedish bomb.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The plot and characters draw you in and make you want to know more about what made our civilization colapse.  I liked the end of the trilogy because it tied up some of the loose ends, but not in an unrealistic way.

B006OAB3ME|3.0|Kisses on the Bottom is a collection of emaculately performed standards. McCartney's vocals (as well as the musicianship of Dianna Krull's band) are so carefully rendered that the result can't be anything less than pleasant. However, despite the playful title, Kisses on the Bottom is simply lacking in fun and adventure. For example, \\"Bye Bye Blackbird\\" is a very upbeat, fun song; but the arrangement here is bordering on moribund. The best tracks on this album turn out to be the two originals: \\"My Valentine\\" (especially) and \\"Only Our Hearts\\". Kisses on the Bottom is listenable, and impressive in its way, but is not among McCartney's more personable efforts.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Received item on date promised.  Package not damaged.  Item was well packaged.  Am excited about this movie...one of my very favorite classic movies.  Amazon has always been an easy and great way to do my shopping.

B007ARJF6G|5.0|It has a good beat.  The lyrics are an improvement over the generic 12 year old poetry that was Hard Candy, and the sound is thumping and chopping with a hint of originality.
B00564GPKY|5.0|This book reads like a fascinating novel. I couldn't wait to get to it each day. I finished it this morning and feel energized about working on some habits of my own that need changing.<br /><br />Often when reading a self help book I have wondered, where did THAT come from. I liked the fact that so many references are provided.<br /><br />The examples provided are very easy to relate to both from personal and business perspectives.<br /><br />I have already recommended this book to friends and family and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys pondering why we do things and how can we improve our lives.<br /><br />Thanks for this book!!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I first downloaded this App 12/01/2011 - It was excellent for folks who need \\"white noise\\" to sleep. My wife and I used it all night for a restful sleep (\\"Air Conditioner\\" setting worked best for us). HOWEVER:<br /><br />UPDATE 01/30/2013 - PROBLEM WITH LOOP - REMOVED FROM KINDLE AND THEN RE-LOADED - STILL A PROBLEM<br /><br />Recently I upgraded from the Kindle Fire 1st Gen to Kindle Fire HD and this App no longer functions properly. THE SOUNDS ARE NO LONGER CONTINUOUS. THE SOUND PAUSES EVERY FEW SECONDS IN A LOOPING CYCLE THAT IS VERY ANNOYING.  The website of this developer says the problem has been corrected in the latest version (which I have).. but the problem still exists. I contacted developer via e-mail, but never received a response (it's been over a month).<br /><br />UPDATE 7/5/2013:  Just by chance, I again downloaded Sleepy Time app.  To my surprise, the looping issue on the Kindle Fire HD has been fixed!!!  -  This sleep aid app has gone back to being the all time favorite of my wife and me.

141690977X|1.0|Boy, did I hate this book. It was written by a couple of TV writers, and the fact that it made it to the best-seller list does not bode well for the future of American womankind.  It is about romantic relationships, but the writers are pretty unfamiliar with any serious work on the subject. Instead, this reads like a tossed-off collection of sorority house wisdom, full of anecdotes about relationship problems that supposedly happened to the writers' friends, but could just as easily have been made up.<br /><br />It is amateur junk, but that is not the only thing wrong with it.  I mean, it could have been funny and interesting, or present a positive point of view, but it does none of those things.  Behrendt does both genders a big disservice in his stereotypical portrayal of \\"guys\\" as simple-minded, horny bozos, who never have mixed feelings or problems. The book was written to console women who are confused about the men in their lives, and why they are not responding in the hoped-for romantic ways.  To this, the authors have a simple answer: \\"He is just not that into you. Wake up, sweetheart, dump the guy, get out there and find somebody who does do all the things you want him to do. Don't call him or believe his stories.\\"  This simplistic, conservative message will no doubt cause a lot of young women to do stupid things and become bitter if they don't get treated in exactly the way they want to be. F___ this book.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|This app is very fun.  No ads so no interference with game play.  I love this game, but can't get my wife to quit playing it.  It's highly addictive and a bit cuter than the original Angry Birds.  Well worth the price and challenging enough to keep user entertained. However not so difficult that it gets frustrating.  A must have if you love the original Angry Birds and like the movie Rio.
B004EPYZPI|3.0|The title says that it is the Blu-ray along with a DVD and Digital Copy. However, what I received was a Blu-ray and a Spanish copy of that Blu-ray. So any chance of putting it on my Apple TV easily is now done.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|This is a nice computer version of air hockey.  My family and I love to play the real thing, but when that is not possible, this is a nice substitute.  App has good graphics and sound.  My 9 year old daughter loves playing against me.<br /><br />Worth the purchase price if you like air hockey.  Can be for two players or against the computer.  Computer play can be tricky but still fun.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this trilogy. It took me several pages to get into into it but I thought the characters & story line were fantastic.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really didn't know what I was going to get into when I chose to read this first book, prior to seeing it in film.  Wow, Suzanne Collins really knows how to make things come alive on paper.  She made me want to never put the book down.  I could picture every move that the characters made and new exactly what they looked like and how they felt.  The day after I finished the book I saw the movie.  It was done quite well considering all the scenes that had to be covered from the writings of the book.  Suzanne Collins is one of the best authors that I have ever read and I read at least a dozen books a month.  Keep up the good work Suzanne, I loved it immensely.  Now on to my second book.  I hope this will also be made into a movie.

B0076D20E8|5.0|highly entertaining film, beautiful cinematography and costumes, and great period film, however, are they committing a grand public disservice by misrepresenting the truth?  it seems that few support the primary assertion that underlies the premise of the film.  in my opinion, that takes away much of the entertainment value of the film, as an even greater fictional drama could have be conceived.  nevertheless, i definitely enjoyed my moments in suspended disbelief while watching this film.
B00007KGCW|1.0|Region 2 discs cannot be played on most US technology, don't buy them.  I wish I would have known this beforehand.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I started the first book on Friday morning and finished the whole trilogy by Monday night...I tried reading other books on Tuesday and I found myself drawn back to rereading them again last night.  I love the way they were written.  I've not been this excited about reading a series of books since the Harry Potter books (which I have read many times over and over).  I've read alot of the reviews on the trilogy and as I can see not allowing a child 12 and under read it, I think banning your child from reading the book is only going to make them want to read it more.  What should be done is that you should read it first and then have your child read it.  Then you can have an intelligent discussion with them about the books and try to help them to understand anything they didn't understand.  Its sad to discourage kids from reading in today's society, considering the news and what's going on in the real world is so much worse than what is in the contents of these books.  As for the violence, is it so different from what was in Twilight, I found the violence in the Twilight series was much more graphic than in the Hunger Games.  We have to remember these books are fiction, and we should teach our children the difference between fiction and reality.  My son has read the books and knows the difference between fiction and reality, that is our part of being parents.  I highly recommend reading these books.  I know I will be reading them again over and over.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA+++++++++++++++
1597772992|5.0|I first heard of T. Colin Campbell when he was talking about his documentary, [[ASIN:B0053ZHZI2 Forks Over Knives]], in an interview. It sounded interesting, so I added that movie to my rental queue, and months later, it came in the mail. I watched it on March 4th, and was instantly convinced. Forks Over Knives is unbelievably thorough and eye-popping! The movie is like an hour-and-a-half long, hard-hitting summary of The China Study. It gives you a great overview of what Dr. Campbell and his friends are suggesting. I strongly recommend watching that first, and if it resonates with you, then The China Study will give you a much more in-depth view of how you should start eating and why.<br /><br />I slowly started switching my diet from the exact opposite of plant-based. I'm finicky, especially with vegetables, so I really had my work cut out for me. I picked up a few books. [[ASIN:1615190457 Forks Over Knives: The Plant-Based Way to Health]] was decent, but mostly summarized the movie. This was good for cementing some of what I'd learned, but I wished it was more substantial. [[ASIN:0446506699 The Engine 2 Diet: The Texas Firefighter's 28-Day Save-Your-Life Plan that Lowers Cholesterol and Burns Away the Pounds]] was pretty good- I'm almost finished with it. I'm learning a bit, but this was not really what I was looking for either. Rip is passionate and makes a few good arguments, but he focuses a bit too much on the reader giving this a strict 28-day effort rather than viewing it as a life style change, although I know that was his ultimate recommendation. It does tell you all about Rip's experience with nutrition, and has dozens of great testimonials and the results from people whom have also made the change to \\"plant power,\\" and I took plenty of inspiration from that!<br /><br />Finally, I picked up the China Study on audiobook, and I was thoroughly engrossed! I listened to nothing else in my car until I just finished it today. It is so comprehensive and convincing. It shows many studies, lots of research, historical evidence, and all the reasons why the health industry, food industry, and government don't want you to take his advice. Having watched the movie first, I kind of knew what to expect here, and I was more or less prepared. Campbell writes very well, and the audiobook reader was great too, so I was able to follow everything easily as each new chapter gave more and more reasons for me to pay thorough attention. He could not have made it any more obvious that I needed to switch to plant-based nutrition.<br /><br />Starting out, I am 6'5\\", 36 years old, and I weighed 278. I think 225 would be an ideal weight for my build. Its currently been 24 days, and I've lost 16 lbs, bringing me to 262. I haven't been very strict with this program. I've had snacks (A bunch of Girl Scout Cookies had to arrive right when I was starting this), I've finished off the meat products in my fridge, and I am weaning myself off packaged foods. Its been far from perfect, but I have impressed myself so far. These 24 days are probably the longest I've ever gone in my life, without macaroni & cheese. Almond Milk is awesome! I can't believe I haven't missed moo-cow milk one bit. I've always been extremely finicky with vegetables, but I am slowly trying, and absolutely loving, a few new items and dishes each week. To my amazement, I don't even miss dairy and meat much at all. Cheese pizza has probably been my greatest longing.<br /><br />I haven't done much for exercise yet, but that is changing. My cholesterol was last seen at 236 a year ago (I suspect it was higher when I started this program), and no pills sat well with me for that. I will get this checked soon, and report back in the comments section. I feel like it has gotten somewhat better already. My digestion and allergies have been ideal. My skin has cleared up quite a bit, and it may be my imagination, but it feels like my head has too. I've had no acid reflux, and in addition, my wifesays my snoring has died off. As a really pleasant surprise, my male equipment feels rather vigorous too I'm happy to report! ;)<br /><br />I am pretty convinced that this change I've made will end up being one of the absolute best of my whole life. I feel healthier and more energetic already, and I am certain it will only get better as I try more foods, and weed out the bad ones. The next book I will read is [[ASIN:1615641017 The Complete Idiot's Guide to Plant-Based Nutrition]] which sounds like a perfect follow-up, from what I've seen of it's reviews.<br /><br />Any way, I've since purchased Forks Over Knives on DVD, for my collection, and have lent it out to four of my coworkers, my sister and my mom. That is certainly where I recommend you start as well. After you've seen that movie, if you are intrigued, this book is where I suggest you turn next.<br /><br />PS- Switching to Plant-Based Nutrition is what Bill Clinton did to lose all his extra weight, and he looks great. Look for the interview he had with David Letterman a while back. Its very inspirational and commendable!<br /><br />As I said, I plan to post updates, so let me know what you think!says my snoring has died off.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|You must read the book!<br /><br />I always wanted to get the inside scoop about what made Steve the way he was, and I got it. Isaacson laid out the story excellently.<br /><br />Steve was fully human, flawed in his own ways as we all have our own flaws. But I was thoroughly insprired by his relentless persuit of culture, taste, refinement and excellence. (Too bad durability wasn't on his list.)<br /><br />He didn't do consumer research because \\"people don't know what they want; you have to tell them what they want.\\" (I've known that for years.)<br /><br />He came back to Apple and immediately did what no coniving, pandering, career politician would do: He cut EVERYTHING and EVERYONE that wasn't contributing to the revival and survival of Apple.  BTW, Apple has no debt, and has more money in the bank than our rotten federal government right now.<br /><br />Raise Your Standards!

B00005JLR2|5.0|I'm 18 and I really enjoyed this movie.  OMG it doesn't have princesses or talking animals in it! *rolls eyes* (lol I'm a sucker for the Lion King)<br />This is a story about a kid who was abandoned by his dad and he just seems lost on the point of life and turns into a bit of a rebel but he grows up through the movie by taking responsibility in what he does with a new father figure who isn't perfect because no one is.  This movie also has 3D mixed in with it's 2D animation which I find neat(reminds me of Anastasia).  If you get it, I hope you enjoy it as much as me.
B007LB1O3I|1.0|I was a Madonna collector for 20 years...went to all the record conventions, had hundreds of Madonna collectibles including the Erotica PD, but face it people, Madonna no longer knows how to make actual music.<br /><br />This album is nothing but noise.  It is not real music.  Don't believe me?  Well, I would laugh quite a bit if there is someone out there who actually listened to Gang Bang--as in the entire track--all the way through. LOL  That's a song?  No, it's noise.  There are just strings of \\"songs\\" on this album that are so painful to listen to.<br /><br />Hard Candy was the last Madonna album I will ever buy.  Sure, her tours will sell out, but that is because of her sheep like followers.  And I admit I was one for years until I woke up and realized after American Life that Madonna was so over.<br /><br />What is also hilarious is that Madonna through such a mess of songs together.  Now, how does Masterpiece fit on this album?  It sticks out like a sore thumb.  How can you have a piece of garbage like Gang Bang be on the same album as Masterpiece?  Even the brain dead among Madonna's sheep should realize that at least before American Life, all the songs smoothly melded together and were cohesive.  MDNA seems like an album with a bunch of noise thrown together.<br /><br />And the lyrics?  Um, have you listened to them? LOL Rocco must be writing them is all I can say.<br /><br />Face it people: Madonna is now only out to make even more money like the greedy person she is and no longer cares about actual music.  The sooner the Madonna sheep realize this, the less cult like they will be.

B006UG90RM|4.0|The last time David Lee Roth sang on a Van Halen record, Ronald Reagan was president, the summer Olympics were held in Los Angeles, and the space shuttle Discovery took off on its maiden voyage. The year was 1984 and Van Halen's sixth studio album, creatively titled \\"1984,\\" shot up the charts thanks to now classic singles like \\"Jump\\" and \\"Panama.\\"<br /><br />Now, 29 years later, Van Halen is back with three of the four original members. The only remaining holdout is bassist Michael Anthony, who was replaced by Eddie Van Halen's 20-year-old son. Although a classic band reuniting is nothing new these days, Van Halen doesn't try to reinvent themselves to capture a new audience. No, \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" is an album for the now middle-aged original fans who still love to rock and those of us who feel we may have been born in the wrong decade for the music we love.<br /><br />With a classic lineup in tow, Van Halen set out to make a classic record and they did just that. The band doesn't just take things back to \\"1984,\\" \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" goes all the way back to their self-titled debut. With some of the tracks originating from early demo tapes, Van Halen filled the gaps with tracks written in the same style.<br /><br />One such recently written track is \\"Stay Frosty,\\" a song reminiscent of \\"Ice Cream Man\\" off of their 1978 debut in both name and instrumentation. Eddie Van Halen breaks out the acoustic guitar for the intro, just as he did on \\"Ice Cream Man,\\" but it isn't long before he's finger tapping his way across the neck of his electric. It's no surprise he can still play, but David Lee Roth's voice sounds as if it hasn't aged a day. His mixture of spoken and sung lyrics mixed with the occasional screams of \\"wooo\\" or \\"look out\\" offers listeners a certain level of nostalgia Sammy Hagar was never able to achieve with the band.<br /><br />For anyone familiar with the Sammy Hagar years of Van Halen, it quickly becomes clear on \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" that David Lee Roth is much better at bringing out the best in Eddie Van Halen's abilities. He does this by constantly fighting Eddie for the spotlight. Every track seems to be a battle for supremacy, but never in a bad way. Each break in the vocal action gives Eddie Van Halen a new chance to show off, but Diamond Dave's knack for a clever and creative delivery of often humorous lyrics offers plenty of competition.<br /><br />On \\"You and Your Blues,\\" for instance, Eddie Van Halen interrupts a relatively straightforward track with one of the more impressive instrumental moments of the entire record. When the vocals return, David Lee Roth screams out the first line of the chorus, \\"woman, you suffer from a color,\\" with a little more aggression than his previous efforts with the same words. The battle is still won by Eddie, but the album-long war is far from over. In the end, the only true winner is the fans. If you loved Van Halen in the '80s, you will definitely enjoy this record.<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Stay Frosty\\"that David Lee Roth is much better at bringing out the best in Eddie Van Halen's abilities.

B006ZCWU5K|4.0|At the age of 62, Bruce Springsteen is still finding new ways to change up his sound. With his first studio album in three years and his first since the passing of long time saxophonist Clarence Clemons, Springsteen takes this election year release as a means of subtly, and occasionally not so subtly, expressing his political views.<br /><br />Opening with the modern day working man anthem \\"We Take Care of Our Own,\\" Springsteen wastes no time namedropping major American cities and referencing the flag. The track fits right in with many of his American pride songs of the past, but as \\"Wrecking Ball\\" begins to take shape, numerous other styles are introduced that turn the album into a bit of catch all of influences. He even lets some of his Dutch and Irish ancestry from his father's side bleed into the music.<br /><br />Although the musical variety on \\"Wrecking Ball\\" translates well to the melting pot of cultures that exist in the United States, it is not always easy to believe Springsteen's lyrics for the working man with knowledge of his personal financial status. Tracks like \\"Shackled and Drawn\\" and \\"Jack of All Trades\\" discuss the trials of the lower class that struggles to make a living working long hours doing physical labor.<br /><br />The people struggling to purchase the $50 \\"cheap seats\\" to The Boss' upcoming tour might be able to relate to the words, but coming from a millionaire definitely takes a bit of the edge off of the song's lasting impact.<br /><br />One of the most surprising moments of \\"Wrecking Ball\\" occurs during \\"Rocky Ground\\" when a soulful groove transitions into a Michelle Moore aided rap verse.<br /><br />Although I understand The Boss' desire to try new things, the hip hop genre just doesn't fit the style of this record, or any Bruce Springsteen record for that matter.<br /><br />Although Springsteen may not be getting his shirts dirty digging holes in the dirt to pay his bills, there's no doubt that he writes his songs with good intentions and believes in the words he writes, even when they're rapped. If you're part of the 99 percent and own a few records featuring the E Street Band, \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is for you.<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\"s and believes in the words he writes, even when they're rapped.

B0041B785Y|3.0|I guess I'll have to apologize in advance for not thinking that every album by my favorite Metal band of the last twelve years is perfect.  I was relatively late to the Meshuggah party, as Chaosphere was when I jumped on the train, and, to date, is still my favorite release (by the smallest of margins).  While DEI is an unbelievable record which possesses one of Metal's greatest tracks, Future Breed Machine, Chaosphere, in my opinion, was simply more consistent from start to finish.<br /><br />To give an idea of where my review is coming from, I should state that Nothing, while totally original in terms of direction, is my least favorite record from these guys.  The first twelve minutes of \\"I\\" is near-perfection.  While Catch 33 is a bold record that shows their songwriting ambition (the ethereal guitar sections are its best feature), it contains too much of Nothing's style of one-note riffing for my taste.  Obzen, in my opinion, was a fantastic amalgam of their post-DEI style.  I'm a huge fan of old-school Thrash, and Combustion was *exactly* the track I was waiting for Meshuggah to make; it's literally Thrash-done-Meshuggah-style.  In fact, I think Combustion ranks right up there with Future Breed Machine.  While the one-note riffs are still there, they incorporated more of Chaosphere's staccato muting, and, for me, the direction was perfect.<br /><br />That brings me to Koloss.  After about a dozen full listens, I think I have developed a sufficient enough opinion.  My expectations were *not* for the record to sound like another record; I just wanted to love it for whatever it is.  Unfortunately, I just *like* it.  It's pointless to mention production value, as Meshuggah know what it takes to make their records sound great, and it sounds as good as ever, here.<br /><br />\\"I Am Colossus\\" is a solid opener, and contains very straight-forward riffing (relative to Meshuggah).  I'm a sucker for triplet-based tracks with this feel, and this one doesn't disappoint.  Tomas was correct when he said that the two notes Frederik plays during the solo are all that was necessary to make it sound great.  The supporting rhythm riff during the solo is, to me, the standout section of this track.<br /><br />\\"The Demons Name Is Surveillance\\" is one of two fast/more driving tracks on the record, and, while its 6/8-double-bass feel is wonderfully played (does anyone really need to continue emphasizing how tight these guys are?), the notes/riffs just don't grab me.  The higher-note bends that are done during what might be called the second Meshuggah-chorus (which is never truly a chorus ;) just seem a bit gratuitous.  The solo isn't particularly noteworthy (no pun intended), as it's Thordendal's typical tapping, and it doesn't sound very inspired.  It sounds as if this track was trying to be the Koloss version of Bleed.  The endings are similar, but the exclamation point put on the end of Bleed is not even close to being matched, here.<br /><br />\\"Do Not Look Down\\" is what I believe a Nothing track *should* have sounded more like.  As a drummer, I love the fact that Haake's pocket is so deep.  Meshuggah isn't what I would call a \\"groove\\" band per se, but the fact that they have such a great pocket makes their brand of Metal that much more enjoyable.  The riffs themselves during this track just have a much freer/less-intentional feel to them, and the solo is one of the best that Thordendal's done in a while.  I love the effect that was added to the last few notes of it!  He took a break from the tapping and let all of us know, once again, that he can own with the traditional picking style.<br /><br />\\"Behind the Sun\\" doesn't grab me, at all.  While Meshuggah are quite capable of producing slow/brooding tunes that are effective, I don't feel that this is one of them.  It's usually a difficult task to make this type tune hold interest, and this one just doesn't quite do it.  I find myself listening *only* because it's Meshuggah playing it, and simply hearing well-played music is sometimes enough for me.  The second half of the tune is serviceable, but that's about it.<br /><br />\\"The Hurt That Finds You First\\", the first two-thirds of which is quite Thrashy, just didn't quite hit the mark until, strangely for me, the speed was over.  I quite enjoy the ambient/relaxed material these guys do, and the outro is nicely done.  Like TDNIS, I just didn't like the notes that they chose to go with the respective feels, and I really do believe that they could have done better.  Take a listen to \\"Terminal Illusions\\" or \\"Combustion\\", and you'll hear Thrash riffs that mean far more than anything played, here.  To me, this tune would be a really good Thrash tune for any other band, but, for Meshuggah, it's merely decent.<br /><br />\\"Marrow\\" is nothing more than a b-side/cutting-floor track from Nothing.  While my opinion may seem slanted because of the song's Nothing influence, I really don't think it would have even stood out if it were *on* Nothing. The only reason to listen the tune is because of Haake's excellent performance.<br /><br />\\"Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion\\" is one of two tunes that's grown on me since I starting listening to it.  This is slowness-done-right.  In context, the riffs really do work well with each other, and the parts never seem gratuitous.  This is a standout track on the record.<br /><br />\\"Swarm\\" is a track that, while solid and consistent with a good feel that they haven't done in years, just never quite takes off as anything special.  There are no riffs that really stand out.  This is yet another missed opportunity, and the ending is just plain lazy.<br /><br />\\"Demiurge\\" is the other tune that has started to grow on me.  In terms of feel, Meshuggah really hasn't ever done a track like this one, and that's why I really didn't know what to think, at first.  It's hard to describe the feel of what might be called Meshuggah-verses here, but it's almost a....rebellious feel?  I know that there's a better word for it, but I'm currently at a loss.  It sort of reminds me of the approach of \\"Up Lift\\" from Reinventing the Steel.  That said, while the majority of the tune is quite good, this is another case where I believe the outro should have been a little less lazy.<br /><br />\\"The Last Vigil\\" is a nice outro that fits quite well with the scheme of the record.  As has been pointed out, it has that Catch 33 feel to it, and the fact that Koloss ends this way isn't at all a detriment.<br /><br />My Standout Tracks:<br />I Am Colossus<br />Do Not Look Down<br />Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave it Motion<br />Demiurge<br /><br />I'm sorry for the levity, and I apologize if none of this was helpful/interesting.  I started typing and couldn't stop!  Meshuggah is one of the only bands that brings it out!<br /><br />Meshuggah have the luxury in that they have to *try* to make a bad album.  That hasn't happened here, but it could have been so much more.
B005LJKEXS|1.0|It was nice for a week but quit working. Not sure why. Ordered a different brand but have not used it yet.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is truly a great movie! I really feel like this film served as a wake up call to many people as to why our society is struggling. The movie focuses on the fact that many fathers are not getting involved in the lives of their children. It really challenges parents (specifically, fathers) to step up and guide their families in a godly manner. It has served as a big influence in the way my husband and I are parenting, as well as for our friends and extended family.
B0074EIQQU|5.0|If it wasn't for Cedric's unique voice you could be mistaken for thinking this is a different band than the one that released albums such as Frances The Mute and Amputechture, it has hints of At The Drive In, De Facto and The Mars Volta all in one. The drumming on this album is less heavy than the previous few albums featuring Thomas Pridgen, but no less impressive as Deantoni Parks is always thinking/drumming outside the square, Pridgen is a hard act to follow but Parks has put his own mark on this band already. As usual Omar has some mind blowing riffs throughout the album, coupled with some heavy synth at stages I can see why Cedric described it as future punk, to me this is what experimental/prog rock should sound like in the year 2012. Overall this is a very different album to anything they've done previously but is already one of my favorites of theirs, every track is listenable and every track has it's own moment of clarity that will bring a smile to your ears. Best tracks for mine; The Whip Hand, Aegis, In Absentia, Trinkets Pale Of Moon.
B00637HXNG|5.0|One of the best concerts performed by this band. The picture and sound are amazing and the concert is a superb performance. I don´t have a 3D T.V but enjoyed without any problem in a standard TV
1594203334|5.0|I have enjoyed the book so far.  It is an easy read and has some valuable insight.<br />I think it is a good book for first time parents.<br />I wish I had read the book before the arrival of my baby.
1407130293|4.0|Arrived fairly quickly given that it came from SWEDEN! Decent quality, English (like from England) grammar and spelling. And measurements--Katniss is doing things the metric way (as it should be!!). There is not a case for them to sit in, as it might appear in the picture, but I wasn't interested in that. They are good enough quality for paperback novels.
0763655465|5.0|In First Things First, bestselling author Steven Covey devotes an entire chapter to the important subject of \\"Integrity in the Moment of Choice\\".<br /><br />In it he writes, \\"A moment of choice is a moment of truth. It's the testing point of our character and competence\\". After listing some of the factors affecting us in the moment of choice he goes on, \\"With all these factors acting on us, it's important to remember that a moment of choice is just that - a moment of choice. Whether we react automatically to one or more of these influences, empower circumstances or other people to control us, or use our human endowments to make a conscious, conscience-directed decision - it's our choice\\".<br /><br />First Things First is a book for adults.<br /><br />Oh No, George makes some of the same points in a presentation that's fun filled and kid friendly.<br /><br />George is some form of generic hound dog. He has a huge snout, long, droopy ears, and large expressive eyes. On the frontispiece he is pictured in that most pooch like of poses; asleep, on his back, belly exposed, paws lifted into the air. Then the action gets underway...<br /><br />Harry, George's owner, is leaving the house. As he leaves he exhorts George to good behavior in his absence.<br /><br />Closing his eyes in innocence, George answers, \\"I'll be very good\\". Everything about his appearance underscores that this indeed is his intention.<br /><br />Absent his master's stabilizing presence however, George is presented with a series of tough temptations (eating cake, chasing the cat, digging up the garden).  Each time the narrator asks the question, \\"What will George do?\\" And each time our canine hero is pictured struggling with the choice of immediate gratification or honoring his promise to behave. The difficulty of this moment of consciousness is conveyed by the imagery: ears outstretched, eyes wide open looking like he is about to be hit by a truck.<br /><br />And each time he falls we hear the words \\"Oh no, George!\\"<br /><br />Harry returns, George is filled with remorse, and the rest of the story is one of forgiveness, redemption, and restoration.<br /><br />While lots of fun to read, Oh No, George makes an evocative point as to an essential life skill that's too often learned too late.<br /><br />It's a really excellent book.no, George!\\"<br /><br />Harry returns, George is filled with remorse, and the rest of the story is one of forgiveness, redemption, and restoration.<br /><br />While lots of fun to read, Oh No, George makes an evocative point as to an essential life skill that's too often learned too late.<br /><br />It's a really excellent book.
B006M4F67A|3.0|This game has pleasing tiles, but it does not adhere to the standard practice of 4 tiles per set. There are too many tiles with the same picture, which makes it hard to keep track of how many tiles are left. I try to uncover all 4 tiles in a normal Mahjong game before removing just one pair.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I heard about his trilogy for a while before I finally decided I would go ahead and order the first book to see how I liked it. I am a college student with little free time but I wanted to read this trilogy after all the recommendations. There is no denying that the way the book is written keeps you going back for more. In less than two days I had blazed through the first book, was driving to the bookstore to grab the second book, and once back at home, was online ordering the third. After I finished the trilogy, I felt so emotionally drained and I knew why. I m going to write my review as if the three books were one book since I had the fortune to read through them successively. Before I start, I have to say that I did thoroughly enjoy these books, there are just things I wish that could be different with it. A lot of issues with the book have already been discussed previously such as the rushing of the story line in the third book, the overuse of \\"drugging Katniss then explaining the missed events\\" trick etc. I wanted to touch upon a couple of thoughts I had in addition to those great reviews.<br /><br />I was pretty intrigued by Katniss' character at first for many reasons, and starting out the book I really really wanted to like her. She seemed immature, complex, intense but deeply caring. I felt like there was a lot of room for character growth. As I read on, I began to dislike her more and more. Throughout the series, her immaturity never seems to wane. Her thoughts sound like that of a child, they are very self serving and arrogant. The reader slowly starts to learn that all her \\"heroic\\" actions throughout the trilogy are about making herself look good, or being able to live with herself. She also definitely has trust issues, no matter how much the lead male character confesses his love to her, puts his life on the life for her or even offers to die in her place, she is still so skeptical about his love for her....REALLY? What more does this poor guy need todo??<br /><br />As for the love triangle in this book between Katniss, Gale and Peeta, it seems forced. I feel like the books could have stood on its own without it. The fact that Katniss and Peeta were thrown into an arena to kill each other was complicated enough. Gale's presence was fine, if the author had kept him as a \\"big brother\\" figure throughout the book which he played perfectly. Gale's character was not developed enough for the readers to really be rooting for him seeing as readers were so engrossed in what Katniss and Peeta were going through together.<br /><br />Aside from the lack of character growth of Katniss, some characters were actually very likable. Prim, an innocent little sister who has a natural talent for healing people like her mother. It is only around Prim that Katniss remotely begins to resemble a real human being with real human feelings. Prim is selfless and very mature for her age, too bad the author had to kill her off for no good purpose. Then there is Rue, a little girl that Katniss meets in the arena who like Prim, is also intelligent,selfless, caring and innocent...guess what she gets killed too. So then there's Finnick who develops as a character beautifully. This apparently shallow, crude man turns out to be caring, deep, troubled and hopelessly in love with a mad girl. Hate to admit it, but at one point, I almost wished the story was told from their point of view because their love story was so beautiful and inspiring...buuuuttt you guessed, the author killed him off with no good purpose or contribution to the story line.<br /><br />Then there is Peeta, what a great character, you cant help but like the guy and feel bad for him at the same time. It is hard not to feel bad for this poor guy who has fallen in love with the heroine with no feelings for others, and barely any redeeming qualities. Peeta's character and strength doesnt waiver from beginning to end and I think that is why he is so likable. He is pure, caring, selfless, humane and an advocate for everybody. He genuinely seems to care for all people. Peeta never becomes afraid or selfish in the face of death and shows an unbelievable amount of maturity and wisdom for being his age. His only weakness as a character? His constant, illogical submissiveness to Katniss.<br /><br />I wish sooooo much that there could be another book, not a sequel to this trilogy but a book that runs concurrently with this trilogy, only narrated by Peeta. I m not sure if this has ever happened or if it would be an unprecedented event but I feel like that is what this trilogy needs. Peeta's emotional stability, complex yet humane character could give readers almost a completely different view on the whole event. If we could follow Peeta through the events that took place, through growing up, entering the games, winning them, going through the quarter quells, being taken hostage by the capitol, being brainwashed, rescued and finally being able to settle down with Katniss, I feel that readers would not only be able to appreciate Katniss and the entire situation more, but it would offer a more complete, less dark story and ending. There needs to be much more that happened and happens for the story to just end like that and hearing Peeta's side of it, would give readers a chance to just feel more complete.
B006Z21ZGK|1.0|Maiden have probably reached the peak of what is unbearably self-aggrandizing behaviour. At this point it's really about letting you know they're a big popular band. From the start there's the shots of the usual fans who will shout you down telling you that \\"OMFG MIADINE BEASZT EVAER!! FLACK OFF!!!!\\" with an over produced and numbingly senseless montage of some sci-fi sort set to Satellite 26. The music from Final Frontier was about the most pointless of their career but that doesn't matter when there's a great show to put on. It's not about the music. Throw in the comic relief elements of Janick and Nicko and you have the best entertainment a candy floss bearing kid could have. To see Janick doing pirouette after pirouette in close shot HD, and a midget singer doing split leaps and just managing to avoid soiling his pants on the not really high notes is worth the price of this disc and more. Maiden has everything Steve and Rod wanted, status, fan numbers, money, mock prog rock music. If you look at Maiden's real picture of Dorian Gray, you'll see a Fat Elvis, about to keel over on the toilet. This video is really the most shallow garbage released by Maiden and a step down even from the previous videos of the last decade. The split screens are like a tv show preview, just worsening the whole effect. It's like heaven for those who are faithful to a brand and have no brains or taste.<br /><br />EDIT: Once again for those Maiden fans who are either too thin skinned or never liked education, a review is not meant to be complimentary at all costs. So if this product has been rated negatively, the correct place to complain about people that 'hate Maiden' is right there on the Maiden website. This is a place INTENDED FOR REVIEWS, OPINIONS INCLUDING NEGATIVE ONES. If you don't like it, send Steve Harris a tear stained note about how this review made you unhappy and spoilt your holiday/week/life, along with a $60 fanclub membership fee. Thank you.

B00166996S|5.0|Recorded live at Wembly,next best thing to being at a live show. Most of their top songs here and the quality is excellent!
B00757J98K|4.0|Fans of vintage Madonna will be pleased with her new album, \\"MDNA.\\" It's a return to her popular classic pop sound of the 80s and 90s. I happen to like a lot of Madonna's later work, but I know a lot of fans prefer her earlier music, and I think those people will be pleased with this CD. For me, I don't categorize this album as one of my top five Madonna records, but it's still very good. Some of my favorite tracks include \\"Love Spent,\\" \\"Gang Bang,\\" and \\"Masterpiece.\\" There are no bad tracks on this CD, in my opinion, but after having listened to it a few times, I haven't come away thinking that there are any big standout hits on here that will be included in my Madonna faves playlist. I know \\"Girls Gone Wild\\" is touted as the big hit on this album, but it's actually probably my least favorite track on the album. Same with \\"Give Me All Your Lovin'.\\" They aren't bad songs, but I don't think they are at all representative of the best tracks on this album. Listen to the rest of the CD and I think you'll come away happy.
B005I4JG80|5.0|this book is everything i hope for in reading a book. humor, a style that flows and is enjoyable. and my greatest joy in a book or movie is a protagonist i hope to emulate in some ways. in this case, its the author. since she writes the books from mostly the point of an observer, you don't immediately view her as the protagonist, but in many ways she is. and she is an inspiring one at that. humorous and intelligent, and at times self-deprecating, it isn't until the middle of the book that i realize--if this woman lived in san francisco, i'd want her as a friend. add in a dash of the fabulous (she is, after all, raising a family in paris) and she is kind of the carrie bradshaw of mommyhood, contemplating the complexities of something far deeper than dating in new york.
B003EYVXV4|3.0|The film adaptation of \\"The Hunger Games\\" was created for fans of the book. I get that. However, a movie should also be able to stand on its own, and this one absolutely cannot.<br /><br />I saw this film with my husband, who hasn't read any of the Suzanne Collins novels. He had no idea what was going on half the time, because the film doesn't bother giving any back story whatsoever. You don't even get any explanation of the state of the world, the state of the government, why the Districts all cater to the Capitol, what Mockingjays actually symbolize, etc. It's ridiculous. As a result, I think everything is pretty anti-climactic, at least everything leading up to the actual Games, which are done pretty well. But so much is lacking in the movie. Katniss and Gale have like 30 seconds of screen time together, which is super unfair. The whole post-reaping/pre-Games activities are glossed over pretty quickly. I was especially disappointed with the \\"Girl on Fire\\" costumes, which are not nearly as impressive as they are in the book. Overall, while I thought the casting was very good (except for Lenny Kravitz as Cinna...say what?!), I had major issues with the script, which allowed for hardly any character development. The character of Rue was especially underplayed, which was ridiculous. I didn't like the final scene of the Games with the dogs. The filmmakers totally sugarcoated it from the way it went down in the book, which made no sense to me.<br /><br />Ultimately, I just thought the film was a giant let-down. The two best things, in my opinion, are Jennifer Lawrence's outstanding performance as Katniss Everdeen, and also the fact that the actual look and feel of the Games (both the setting and the way most of the events played out) looked exactly the way I pictured them when I read the book. Still, though, I was really disappointed overall.
B003Y5HWJU|3.0|The picture, albeit very dark, is fine. Likewise the sound is fine. The problem, as noted by others, is that the discs simply won't play properly with most Blu-ray players. Since the firmware on my Sony Blu-ray player is right up to date, it would appear that it is a hardware issue. The processors in most Blu-ray players are simply insufficient to play this set properly. The processor in the PS3 is more powerful and thus can play these discs properly. But unless you will play these on a PS3, this is a good set to avoid. As noted by other reviews, there are numerous issues with these discs. Get a one month subscription to HBO from your provider and then stream these to your computer. You will save money and aggravation.
1741798981|4.0|This is a good, solid travel guide of London. Highlights include the way different regions/neighborhoods of the city are broken down into sections. Additionally, the book is full of many maps, including smaller ones of certain areas and a larger pullout map of the whole city. As other reviewers have mentioned, the paper quality is poor, which is a bit disappointing. Also, you would think that a London 2012 travel guide would make more mention of the Summer Olympic Games, which will occur in London this year. Overall, this is a decent guidebook, but I think there are others on the market that are a bit better.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|I have been watching this series since it started and I must say it has been a thrill ride. There is so much to say, there's blood and a lot of it, extremely sexually charged and graphic, not to forget the whole story line of a roman empire.... If you haven't seen this try to find an episode on line, you won't be dissapointed
B006JTS5OO|5.0|I has been a long wait but well worth it. Our family missed the Henson quality Muppets. This movie was enjoyed by the whole family!

B004LWZW8S|4.0|If you like mythical, gods and monsters movies then this will be great for your collection. A must have! A story of a man trying to defeat all odds against him, with a little help he prevails.... I seriously hope that there is a sequal to this movie.
0060558121|3.0|Although a brilliant concept, and for the most part well-written, this book fell flat. The main character is hard to get to know - Shadow's back-story is doled out in little dribs and drabs throughout the book, and the main plot (which is presumably about him) seems almost like an afterthought.<br /><br />It is very easy to imagine this as a television series, in fact it will probably be more successful as an hour show, each god and locale they visit would be one episode.
B005OK725M|5.0|I saw this movie first in the theatre and at the end of the movie I knew I would need to buy it. A story of a young girl in unfortunate circumstance hellbent on revenge for the death of her family.... A must see
B002FOQY2M|5.0|The Fun. song \\"We Are Young\\" hit me as such an inescapable ear worm that I just couldn't get it out of my head.  I finally gave up trying and bought the cd \\"Some Nights\\" then decided to get 'Aim and Ignite\\" also, because the  positive and interesting reviews made me curious. I am glad I did.  This cd defies any attempt to pigeon hole it into a specific genre.  From the first notes of the first song, I almost feel as though I am listening to a sound track from a Broadway musical.  The orchestration and arrangements are multi layered.  Tempo change-ups abound but somehow it all comes together to paint an uplifting, almost triumphant masterpiece of love, heartache, life and beyond.<br /><br />Nate's voice is amazing.  He expresses a full range of emotion with almost acrobatic ease, moving from sad to exultant in a heartbeat.  There is little indication where the music is going next. The experience is rather like hanging on through the tight curves and ups and downs of a favorite roller coaster.  Throw up your arms and feel the ride.  It is that fun.<br /><br />As others have noted the orchestration and layered vocals are reminiscent of Queen, ELO, the Beatles, Beach Boys and others. But their sound is truly their own. This music is quite original with no apologies or attempts to wrap up a \\"hit song\\".  It is pure creativity and uniquely refreshing.

1451648537|5.0|Steve Jobs' mystique was elevated even further after the authorized biography by Walter Isaacson hit the shelves a mere several days after his death-and even more after that by the release of the iPhone 4S (for Steve).    Apple devices have become ubiquitous. When In Manila, the sight of white laptops in cafes, white cords dangling from the ears of grade school students, or grandmothers swiping their fingers across an iPad, barely raises an eyebrow anymore. That is how deeply Apple has become a part of our collective consciousness.    The man who helped give the world the Mac, iTunes, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad, Pixar and its award-winning animated films, has changed the way we live, and his impact resonates across several industries: music, publication, retail, computing, animation, design, and telecommunications.    Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson reveals the story behind all these groundbreaking products we've come to know so well. More importantly, it is the story of of a remarkable individual told  from a variety of perspectives, and the most resounding voice, of course, is Steve's. Steve's talks openly about life, death, and everything in between. And the author's voice as heard as well; Isaacson , who interviewed Steve on numerous occasions, up to the point where Steve was undergoing chemotherapy, manages to stay objective, doesn't pander to the recently departed, and this non-fiction account is suspenseful, emotional, incredulous, and even hilarious.    Having topped the bestseller lists and given 5 star ratings on Amazon.com, it is difficult to say who is more fortunate: Isaacson for having Steve Jobs, one of the most reclusive pubic figures, as a subject for a biography, or Jobs, for picking Isaacson to write it. Isaacson turned Steve down when he initially approached him. Isaacson surmised to himself that Steve approached him because he had previously written biographies of two of the greatest minds of all time: of Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein,and that Steve was already counting himself among their distinguished company.    If that was the case, it looks like they were both right.    Because we often look to the past to search for clues, several chapters are devoted to his formative years. We see how his adopted parents gave in to him because they realized that this was no ordinary child. His college years were spent on the floors of dorms, because he had decided to drop out of his course, and drop in on classes that interested him. He spent several months traveling around India, living in ashrams. When he returned, he hadn't seemed to have reached nirvana, but he had started to abstain from meat, shaving, and taking showers.    His birthplace of Palo Alto was also very significant. There was a technological renaissance going on at the time. In Palo Alto, being an engineer was the pinnacle of achievement. And the neighborhood Steve grew up in was full of them. There were garage computer clubs, and it was here that the 16-year-old Steve and would meet another Steve (Wozniak) and together they founded Apple. With the help of an Intel engineer, they made and sold their first Apple computer. Its casing was made of wood and it didn't have a screen.    His personal life as an adult was tumultuous as well. He had a daughter whom he refused to acknowledge, despite naming a computer (The Lisa) in her namesake. 14 years after he and Wozniak produced the Apple I, he would be fired from the very company he founded. He started NeXT computers and bought Pixar. In moves that still leave MBA's breathless, Steve would sell Pixar to Disney and NeXT to Apple, and later on, deftly regain control of Apple.    A man already worshipped by multitudes of devotees, his marketing genius, seen through his 1984, \\"Think Different,\\" and \\"Here's to the crazy ones,\\" advertising campaigns, his theatrical product launches at Mac World, and his ruthless pursuit of perfection at any cost have become the stuff of legend. And he walked his talk. His return to Apple saw a Jobs who was still thinking differently, and who envisioned the computer as the centerpiece of human activity, a digital hub. Then came the iPod, iTunes, and the rest is as they say, history.    The book takes the enigma, and shows us the real Steve, warts and all, as they say. For a man who was taken too early, the book is 656 pages short, and it makes one wonder, What if? What else would he have accomplished if he had been given more time? But like he said in his Stanford commencement address, \\"Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know of avoiding the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not follow your heart.\\" Regardless of when it ended, Steve lived his life to the full. And that, more than sleek designs and amazing technology, is his legacy.    Source: [...]
B0055QYKQO|3.0|Cons: Had to Manually set up x8 multiplier to get 1600 MHz DDR3 SDRAM to work at 1600 not 1333 MHz! After contacting Corsair Memory Tech Support [Little Help] as they were investigating the 8120 8 core CPU that had simular problems on other MBs!<br /><br />As Long as you set CMOS to Manual on just about Every Setting except Voltages your Ram will run at 1600 MHz, However if you use the Supplied ET6 Software it will mess up your settings! So Don't bother setting ET6 UP! Gigabit Tech support is useless as they only have Email Support and a GIGABYTE Product is NEVER WRONG!!!<br /><br />Very Little if any support From the AMD side as they have scant info on the 990FX series Chipset! 2200 MHZ is the Default speed that the Gigabyte BIOS ver F6f [Latest Available] Sets it to even though there is a RED warning in CMOS that the FSB 990FX Freq will be adjusted if Lower than the Hyper Transprt Freq of 2600 MHz! Which is the Default CMOS Freq per the HT 3.0 Spec page in AMD's Website! So if you want all chips to comunicate freely then you have to LOWER the HyperTransport Freq to 2200 MHz to match the NB 990FX or there will be constant Fluxuations of theNB 990FX SB950 HT Link 2200 MHz derived from the FSB 200 MHz and PCIExp 100 MHz frequencies! Once Again you can Manually set all Freqs to the required 200/100 MHZ required for FSB/PCIExp.<br /><br />Also noticed EXREME Heat on NB 990FX Chip! [Is there any wonder that the UD5 and UD7 version of this Board shows a HeatPipe type Hatsink connected to the Mosfet Area!!!] GIGABYTE Knew about the Heat Problems!<br /><br />Pros: Cheap Board for the Features offered, But I will not be buying another one or the UD5 or UD7 Versions.<br />  \\"It only takes One time to get BURNED, Then you go elsewhere....
0714843377|4.0|When in book shops, one notices more and more titles occupying the self-help section. They cover a broad range of topics-from how to be creative, be a success, get fit, find love, be happy...you name it. The titles beckon you with ever more grandiose claims and lofty promises. I've read quite a few over the years, and a lot of them blend together into boring, pseudo-scientific, pop psychology fluff.    Here's where It's Not How Good You Are It's How Good You Want To Be sets itself apart.    \\"Nearly all rich and powerful people are not notably talented, educated, charming, or good looking.\\"  This sentence fills fills an entire page at the beginning of advertising guru Paul Arden's 128-page book. You could finish it while stuck in EDSA during rush hour.    This book is unlike any other book in the personal development genre. For one, it's cool. It sports a catchy title and stylish design. It captures one's attention and piques the interest. Browse through the table of contents-\\"Why do we strive for excellence when mediocrity is required?\\" p. 10, \\"Have you noticed how the cleverest people in school are not whose who make it in life?\\" p. 20, \\"Do not seek praise, seek criticism\\" p. 26-and you're hooked.    Secondly, it's shorter than any book out there in any genre (except children's storybooks). Flipping through the pages, you'll see that nearly half consists of photographs, cartoons, and pages containing a single sentence. Compared to, say, Tim Ferris' The 4-Hour Work Week or Chris Gillebeau's subsersive self-help book, The Art of Non-Conformity, one would be inclined to think that it doesn't contain much substance. Think again.    As the third point illustrates: What seems simple is actually wisdom. Paul Arden aims to teach business success from an advertising perspective. He talks about how to stimulate creativity, the benefits of making mistakes, how you can turn an average company into a great company (regardless of your position), how to communicate effectively, and more.    Although published back in 2003 by Phaidon Press, and the advertising philosophy of Don Draper is considered laughably out-of-date today, the fundamental principles that Paul Arden talks about are as relevant as ever, and are applicable to any business that requires any amount of selling or creativity.    When in Manila (where I'm from), one is constantly being barraged by advertising: billboards block out the sky, print ads clutter the sides of buses, jingles blare on the airwaves, and don't even mention the newspapers and magazines who rely solely on ads to make any sort of profit. The marketing and advertising people would do well to browse through this book.    Originally posted on: [...]
B005DESVPO|5.0|Oh boy, how I still love material music. I mean, it´s just something else to hold a CD case (or even an LP) in your hand. Manuseate the case, sleeve, read the credits, etc. So much better than mp3s. With such great music as this, the pleasure is even bigger. Great music, real blues, with a contemporary touch. The two electric songs are rare examples of the evolution of the blues, maintaning it´s roots. The two acoustic is just something you´d love to listen to at home, with friends or loved one, but also in a nice blues bar-jazz café.<br />The only downside to it (I´m being ironic in a way, I knew that, of course) is there are only 4 songs. Could listen to him playing and singing for an hour, no problem!<br />By the way, it is 20and so minutes long. Fair enough. Listened to it twice in a row as it arrived.
0061433047|5.0|this is my first tiffany arching discworld book.  cute characters and ending, with a few surprising twists and turns.  laugh out loud hilarious at times, loved it!
006197806X|5.0|I loved, loved LOVED the first book so much and had a hard time holding myself back from stalking Lauren, hunting her down and forcing her to let me read the next installment! Just sayin! It was that good!<br /><br />\\"I thought the Invalids were beasts; I thought they would rip me apart. But these people saved me, and gave me the softest place to sleep, and nursed me back to health, and haven't asked for anything in return.<br /><br />The animals are on the other side of the fence: monsters wearing uniforms. They speak softly, and tell lies, and smile as they're slitting your throat.\\"<br /><br />The book starts off with Lena struggling through the wilds after she had escaped. Alex is dead and she just wonders as far as she can. She soon passes out and is awoken by a couple of invalids trying to help her. The invalids take her in and show her the ropes. She dreams about Alex and cannot get him out of her head. She is saddened that he is gone, they were suppose to be together. He was going to show her the wilds and now she is alone.<br /><br />Flash forward a few months to Lena going to school in what I believe is NYC. She is on a mission to study the DFA, Delirium Free Association. Her job is to watch the DFA leader's son, Julian and follow him. By unforeseen circumstances, Lena gets to be very close to her subject. The pieces start coming together and soon, the pair is fighting for their lives.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Lena, she was very whiny in the beginning, but soon got over herself and became a strong independent woman. The invalid clan was a tough group. Ms. Oliver did a wonderful job when creating their characters. She gave them just enough gruffness to show how hard a person can become while living and trying to survive in the wilds.<br /><br />This brings us to Julian. I am really torn because I loved Alex in the first book, but Julian is just as sweet. Not as tough, but a really nice guy.<br /><br />\\"I want to know.\\" His words are a whisper, barely audible. \\"I want to know with you.\\"<br /><br />The ending is a HUGE cliffhanger! Actually, the very last sentence is huge!!! This book was just the right mix of death, love, fear and fighting for what you believe in. I can't wait to see what happens next!ble. \\"I want to know with you.\\"<br /><br />The ending is a HUGE cliffhanger! Actually, the very last sentence is huge!!!

B006ZCWU5K|3.0|In order to rate this a 5 star CD you have to come to the conclusion that it's as good as his work beginning with The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle and continuing through to The Tunnel of Love, which it clearly isn't. I'm not certain anybody has ever put out a series of seven albums in a row that were that good. There's not a standout track on the record. It really is average. Springsteen's music has developed a more direct edge to it and a bit more anger. Nothing wrong with that, but there used to be a sense of hope that went along with it. The guy pining for Mary to get off the porch and take that ride held hope despite its desperate overtones. I miss those stories, those characters. This album doesn't have that. At least for me it doesn't. Good album, as should be expected from Bruce, but not great, which used to be the norm.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|As I was saying Was on my brothers Ipod it cost only 99 cents I hoped the kindle would say the samething! But it seems like in awesome game it just needs to cost less! So I hope the kindle changes its mind or at least the app store!

B007OUFESC|5.0|This movie was delightful! Slow, as most smart, historically based movies are, but the plot and the amazing performances keep you awake. I would recommend it not only to those interested in Psychology (specifically Psychoanalysis), but to anybody open to get a better picture of the complexity inside our minds.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I had been hearing all of the cackling and smirking about this book 50 Shades of Gray and so I thought ok I am going to see what this is all about. I have just finished reading the final book in the trilogy and must say  that my first inclination was this is it  nothing but smut; but the more I got into the first book which was very dark and scary;  then the 2nd book which was from Ana's point of view and the final book which I found the most beautiful of the three I realized that no matter how dark your life has been in the past and no matter what someone has told you that your life must be in the past there is always redemption and that redemption is in finding that \\"forever\\" person who tells you that you do have a good heart, that you can overcome anything in your life with that \\"one\\" \\"forever\\" \\"LOVE\\".  I appreciate the telling of the story of Christan and Ana and the evolution that there relationship took. Trust is something that alot of people find difficult to have in that \\"forever\\" person; but thru it all Christian and Ana survived it  and came out with a better understanding of how deeply abuse as a child can scar you forever; but you don't have to stay scarred you can move out of the shadows of gray and know that at the end there is that beautiful sunset that they enjoyed.
145551389X|5.0|The photos are amazing. I feel like I know her a lot better now. Definitely worth your money! A Must have for a little monster.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I had previously only heard a few cuts from this CD.  After hearing the whole thing I now understand the rave.  What a edgy new sound.  Well worth the listen.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It is a great game. Great everything! It's good when you have nothing to do. The ads are ok, because I can just easily skip them. I find no fault with the game.
B000JMLFLW|4.0|love it or hate it the book is a classic and call me crazy but im a sucker for some Jane Austen.
B00756GKBA|1.0|This is not Madonna. Seems like this disc is a fabricated mix of someone desperately trying to stay current and youthful. Dreadful.  Only two songs caught my fancy:  Girls Gone Wild and Masterpiece.  The rest are insolent noise with far too much bass.  I was hoping for a good work-out dance dust-up with her latest CD (on the lines of Confessions on a Dance Floor), but this is just rubbish.  Enough with the synth pops and whirls and mind-numbing headache-inducing sounds--give us some good upbeat workout tunes, Madge.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|best book ever written by the one of world's greatest geniuses that ever lived. i love reading sherlock holmes just to try to wrap my brain around all of the details and particulars in this story and it never ceases to amaze me just how smart doyle was. it is absolutely mind boggling me and it just shows you how good this is that it would continue to be a popular story and characters after so much time. everyone should read this book.
B00005R23S|5.0|I saw this tour in Oakland in 1999 and was floored by how great it was, seeing Bruce and the E Street Band indoors after two shows in 1985 at the Oakland Stadium. I was thrilled to get this DVD a few years ago to relive what a great show it was. At the peak of their powers the E Street Band reaches levels that I've only heard rock groups like The Rolling Stones, The Grateful Dead, The Band or The Allman Bros attain. This 2 disc set is a treasure trove of great performances from start to finish. \\"Light of Day\\" alone is worth the price of the package; it's a startling performance and you wonder how anything this good and high energy and spot on could be so well rehearsed.  And the rest is just gravy. My only regret is that there is no \\"Because the Night\\"; when I saw that in Oakland, time stopped.
B005ER6STG|4.0|Yes it's true, this version is cut but if you do some research on the internet about the scenes that got cut you will be able to follow the story just fine, that is if you don't mind spoilers, but it will not be as shocking. If you are curious about checking out this movie and don't care about a couple scenes being cut then get this version because it is the best looking version with English subtitles you can get. The scenes that are cut in this movie are only two and they are not really cut, they are just altered so you can't see the controversial, shocking stuff. Just because this is cut, don't think you are getting some watered down version of the movie, oh no, it's still very brutal and we are lucky we got this much still contained in this version. If you want it for all the shocks it delivers though, you definitely need to check out the uncut version as the two most shocking scenes are the ones that are altered in this version and therefore this version takes away a good bit of the shock this movie delivers. If you do want to get an uncut copy of it on DVD, there are still websites that sell the out of print uncut copy. You just have to do a google search.<br /><br />A final word of warning: If you cannot handle movies like Saw and Hostel, stay far away from this film.
B006YTYIXG|5.0|The first time i listened to it i liked it right away. It just keeps getter better every time i listen. I'd say it's Soulfly's best album, even better than \\"Dark Ages.\\" I know most of you stubborn asses won't even bother listening because Max has put out a few nu-metal albums over 10 years ago, but it's definitely better than anything Seputura has done since \\"Chaos Ad\\" or maybe even \\"Arise.\\".... Any fan of Max should check this out. If you are into old Sepultura like me, you'll like \\"Enslaved.\\" This album doesn't sound like the early nu-metal Soulfly. If you don't like Max personally, put it aside. This album kills!...
B002R5QPRI|5.0|great storyline and great actors...love whitney and kevin in the love story that was put together...they work very well together and I really enjoyed the movie....she will be really missed....

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The Good: Good visuals, flinging birds is fun<br /><br />The Bad: Inconsistent difficulty, physics are a bit weak, lots of trial and error<br /><br />Physics games tend to be very popular on the App Store and Angry Birds is one of the best among them. The idea is to flick birds off a slingshot and have structures crash down around the evil pigs. There are various types of birds such as one that spreads into three when you tap it, one that goes really fast, and then one that doesn't do anything but cause damage, and a few other types.<br /><br />At the start of each level you get shown what you have to bring down and then you drag your finger to move to the slingshot. You can't see where the structure when looking at the slingshot so this provides a challenge, but also a lot of trial and error. Trying to find the weakest points in the structures can be a pain and tedious since you never feel like your birds are strong or heavy enough to do a good deal of damage.<br /><br />You get rated at the end of each puzzle for how many birds you have left and how much damage you caused. Once all the pigs are dead you clear the level and move on to the next. It seems that there is no consistent difficulty increase and it just seems all over the map. The art style is nice and it feels fluid, but the sounds are really annoying.<br /><br />Overall Angry Birds is an excellent physics game and is well worth you dollar.
B0034JKZ86|2.0|I was SO excited when this movie came out. I was equally disappointed with it. It has adorable story line in a sense of the main character and her family and her dreams. I think there is more to Louisiana then voodoo though, Maybe I am wrong but I know if I lived there I would want to be better represented. They have a dark sense about in this movie,, There is the evil guy who is into voodoo and witchcraft, he sings a song about \\"having friends on the other side\\" what other side? hmmm. Also there is dancing voodoo dolls and spirits that go after the princess frog and prince frog. Really dark I feel.. It is too bad, they could have done more for such an anticipated film. I wont be buying this one. I know all Disney movies have some form of magic, I understand that but this particular one took it way beyond and back.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I fell in love with Christian by somewhere around the end of the first chapter. He was the perfect Alpha male to me. He was strong and masculine and used to getting his own way, but he was also sexy and protective and sweet and he doted on her like someone he cherished her. Swoon.<br /><br />Then he makes Ana an offer. I won't spoil it for you, but essentially he shows her his BDSM lifestyle and asks her to be a part of it. But in a completely controlling Alpha jerk way. He offers her a contract and tells her she'll need to sign it before they can become intimate.<br /><br />When he offered her that contract, my heart broke. And I mean that. I was so enthralled by his character that my chest ached. The author had just ruined this wonderful man for me. I thought, it's that romance, where the controlling, Alpha jerk gets tamed by the beautiful woman. I hate that guy. I'm not a fan of strong Alphas, because it's just not realistic to me. How could a woman fall for that? I prefer my men soft around the edges. Give me a Beta (aka the best friend) any day. I had to put the book down and pondered whether or not I could actually pick it up back up. I was that disheartened by this revelation.<br /><br />So I emailed the friend who recommended the book and had already moved on to book two. She said, \\"Don't give up on him.\\" So I begrudgingly kept reading.<br /><br />Yes, there are a lot more times when Christian becomes that Alpha. They argue, they fight often. He's a control freak, who doesn't seem to have any idea what he's doing to her. And in those times, I want Ana to leave him. I want her to tell him off and storm out of his life. She deserves better than that! It takes her a long while to do it, and I have to tell you, I wasn't happy about that. It wasn't until I was about three quarters through book two that I fully understood. In between Alpha jerk, Ana gets glimpses of the real man inside. The soft-hearted, scared guy who's hiding behind his control freak nature. And, just like I do reading this book, she caves, becomes unsure of herself.<br /><br />IOW, Christian ends up being a very complex character. He's real and it's wonderful to behold, because his character arc is huge. His \\"issues\\" are realistic and that's what makes me love him so much. Ana was real as well. I found her insecurities to be very realistic. Honestly, I'm tired of feisty heroines. Every once in a while, I want someone not quite so perfect. And Ana blossoms over the course of the two books. She finds her self-confidence during both books, learns to stand up to him, and the more she does, the more I found myself cheering for her. In the end, the two of them completely complement each other.<br /><br />Downsides: repetition. Words and phrases repeated over and over. The love scenes, while scorching, are numerous and at times I found them repetitive as well. Which reminds me. The BDSM aspects are rare. It's more talked about than done, and in the end, it's abandoned completely. It's listed as \\"erotic\\", but the language is mild. The love scenes are fully described, but tastefully done. The F word is about the harshest word in this book (Christian refers to himself \\"f-ed up\\"). None of the harsh language you usually see in an \\"erotic\\" are in this book.<br /><br />Also, it's really obvious that the author isn't American, because neither character's speech sounds like an 20-something American. It's more formal than it should be and there are definitely points where I recognize some British terminology. But, I didn't find that this took away from the book itself.<br /><br />Also, these books follow nearly every single moment of these people's lives, so that there are places in both books where I was bored to tears, wondering why the author didn't just condense those places. But then I realized (in the end) that this is needed in order to gain the full scope of Christian's character. Without going through absolutely everything, I don't think he would have quite comealive the way he did.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey needs to be read along with book two, Fifty Shades Darker, in order to get the full scope of Christian's character. Christian's true inner character, that sweet, lovable guy, gets revealed extremely slowly and if you don't read book two, you'll likely come away from book one feeling slightly short changed. Book two is where you get most of the details of exactly why Christian is the way he is, and where his change is the greatest.
B006O5YI7G|4.0|I have to say I didn't read reviews, this just popped up on Prime on my TV. I did expect something with more action but I wasn't disappointed overall. Nice storyline and good acting from the lead.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I wasn't so much intrigued by the sexual content of this book, because as the pages went on I got bored. The last sex scene I pretty much skipped. Other than that..I absolutely loved the mystery of Mr. Grey moreso than his sexual Dominance over Ana. I kept reading only because he mystified me in a way that women love to be mystefied. But I found the sexual encounters just blah...I've seen plenty of sex in my day and anyone could have pulled that off..I was waiting for him to pull out the whips and chains and get down to the nitty gritty which never happened. It was just a little spanking here and there. BORRRING. I wanted my insides to tantalize at the thought of this happening as I would at watching an exciting porn.<br /><br />WIth that said, I'd much more recommend reading the Story of O, if you haven't already done so.<br /><br />I will read the other 2 only because I want to see how Mr. Grey turns out..not because of the sex. :)
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I just purchased Angry Birds HD.  I read the complaints about the free version not being compatible and only two worlds available but decided to purchase anyways.  Having used my Kindle Fire and various apps for a couple months now, I have to say my first impression upon starting the game was \\"this is HD?\\"  I can't help but notice the game looks 'soft' as if it is a scaled up version and was not really made for the Kindle resolution. Look at the background and how it looks a little pixelated or grainy instead of smooth gradients of color. I feel like I was mislead by the HD in the title.  Other than that I enjoy the gameplay on my Motorola Atrix and now my Fire.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|this is a great game and it would be awesome if everyone had it for free I beat it for android and its free/awesome
0143038419|1.0|This story is so frustratingly and sickeningly selfish that I threw it in the trash about halfway through.  It's sad that women find this type of story inspiring.  I think it's depressing, and it actually reminds me of \\"White People Problems.\\"
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love playing this game! this game is awesome love it.<br />from tori<br />p.s. so coollllllll!<br /><br />101 is a lot of games
B006HGXGWU|4.0|The movie is flawless visually and in how it was acted and scored. The story was almost perfect though I agree with some people about the ending being a bit of a letdown. But this is how I feel just moments after finishing the film. I'll give it some more thought.<br /><br />But all in all the story was sensational, too. I'm really excited to own this on DVD myself.<br /><br />The cinematography of the sky both clear and stormy, and the birds, and the open land... tremendous. Acting across the board - all leads and supporting actors were of equal caliber. I never saw anyone \\"act\\" throughout the entire film. Dialogue all convinced me. The way the ambient sound effects and music danced with each other was perfect. The shots, and the pacing in the editing... also amazing.<br /><br />The only reason I can't give this movie a full 5 stars right now is because of the ending which was powerful, but left me a bit confused. Confused is okay, open ended endings are also okay - but the way the entire film led up to it, it just felt - out of place. Don't let that stop you though as it's still MORE THN WORTH it to see the rest of the film.
044042321X|4.0|Being a diehard Game of Thrones fan, I had to get this.  Just to let you know, this is the first in the series of the GoT graphic novels, so it only covers the first book up to a certain point.  Without being too spoiler-ish, it ends with Dany trying her tactics of womanly love, if you know what I'm referring to.  The book is pretty neat, I have never really read a graphic novel before, so this was a whole new experience.<br /><br />The good part is that it stays very true to the book, that's why it has to be broken up into several volumes.  The graphics and characters themselves?  Well, they are a little funny looking.  Some of them look nothing like the book describes, or are way uglier, and many of the characters look alike.  I think the artists could have spent a little more time on accurate looking characters.  FYI, there is also a lot of nudity, if you're into or not into that sort of thing.<br /><br />The end of the book has a chunk dedicated to the making of the book.  Kind of neat to read about, and I like \\"book extras.\\"  Also, it says at the end that Volume 2 is scheduled to be released in December 2012, so there is quite a wait!<br /><br />Anyway, pretty good graphic novel.  I would of preferred Mike S. Miller's art, but oh well.  Ever trying to get your friends to read the series, but they won't, but they love comic books/graphic novels?  Maybe you can draw them in with this.  Interesting!
B004GYY714|4.0|getting this was sort of a  hit an miss. but  now that i have it i am happy. i am able to get my local radio station very clearly i cant even get that on my home radio so this is a great app
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great way to take notes on the go. i highly recommend this app. it syncs, and works on several devices
B005LAIH2W|5.0|What a movie! I was exhilarated to find out that this movie was FINALLY being made but I was a little afraid of it being a big disappointment. After 50 years of expectation, it could have gone horribly wrong. But, it didn't. It was GREAT! I've enjoyed the movie now more than once. I just can't get enough. And I've made fans out of several other people who had never heard of the Barsoom series or Edgar Rice Burroughs (I know! Can you imagine?) And we all want a sequel or two or three.<br /><br />If you want to be intrigued, thrilled, and taken away to another world for an afternoon, this is your movie. It's fun, entertaining, a little bit scary for little ones, witty, and visually stunning. There are Tharks, Therns, and Thoats. There is Woola. But, most importantly, there is John Carter. And despite what the critics say, we fans of this story are forever grateful for this movie.

1612130283|4.0|I read this book because it's taken the US by storm and I wanted to know why. Well I can see why..<br />The central idea is as old as the hills -- wealthy, sexy, distant hero slowly falls for innocent but feisty, beautiful young woman. So essentially it's a romance and it's really very funny -- our hero buying ropes and tape in the DIY store our heroine works at..Hmmm?? Can't think why! The reader knows and enjoys our heroine's fall from grace...and she does too... she REALLY enjoys her fall from grace.<br />I think this book is a hit because truthfully we all want great sex and parts of the book are pretty erotic. The less attractive issues of submission, control and pain are ones are heroine struggles with and reflect the readers issues too but.... we all enjoy a good fantasy. The author likes to ask the question \\"who is controlling who?\\" which makes us feel better but with the sex industry booming we all know loads of people who like to play...<br />I think the writing isn't great but who cares if it's what you like. I enjoyed it.. it was a fun diversion and, as in all good romantic fiction (--even our beloved Jane Austen --)  we want to see our hero melt, change and fall for our heroine. Maybe even Elizabeth Bennett would enjoy playing...
0452273331|3.0|The book does bring up some interesting ideas but does it in an extremely redundant and low-paced way. It is like talking to an idiot. The story line is mediocre, the characters are surreal and the interactions are artificial. It is more likely that you will cherish this book if your IQ is mid-range. It is, overall, worth reading, but do not take it seriously.<br />BTW, I am not saying this because I am an enemy of the Human Kind. :-)

0465068367|1.0|I am a young man of East Asian descent. I speak English, Chinese and Japanese. I am extremely interested in politics and history and international affairs. Based on the very content and nature of this book, and through years of my meticulous and exhaustive reading, study and investigation of the contemporary world history especially the incidences and events of the Second World War, I think I'm in a good position of presenting some thoughts based on facts I've observed on this very prickly and thorny and highly contentious issue of the so-called \\"Nanking Massacre\\" in a neutral, unbiased and impartial manner which I believed will debunk the falsehood of this venomous and poisonous book with ill intention and serves a virulent and diabolic anti-Japanese propaganda of the communist China. Here are my reasoning on why the book is a faux and its ideas inflammatory and irrational.<br /><br />The Nanking Massacre, as presented and hyped by the Chinese side, is by and large a myth, a vicious, disingenuous and systematic smear campaign consisting of half-truths, exaggerations and even pure fabrications in a luridly blatant and ruthless attempt to discredit and demonize Japan, tarnish its international image, and be employed as a seemingly eternally effective card to mentally intimidate and hector Japan, extort diplomatic and material benefits out of it, and to perpetually maintain a \\"moral superiority\\" of its own in dealing with Japan. The Chang's Rape of Nanking is one example (who knows she isn't an agent under Chinese government's instruction and payroll?). The recent exhibition of the so-called Japanese war crime staged in San Francisco's Japan Town by Chinese activists is another. Of course, the flaccid, cowardly, wimpy and spineless reactions from each Japanese government after the war which constantly exudes an immense timidity and ineptitude, and displays a stunning inability and disinclination to stand up for its own national honor and reputation, to reason with China and Korea, debunk their lies and ward off their flagrant intimidations and shakedowns are another important factor ascribed to the current miserably ignored, misconstrued and helpless position of Japan in western societies regarding its war past.<br /><br />The very nature of the Battle of Nanking and the happenings ensued subsequently is but an ordinary battle of one side's trying to attack and take over the capital city of another country, and the other side trying to defend it but failed, which has been repeatedly put on the world stage for hundreds of years in human history. After the fall of Nanking, the Japanese army who had sustained a heavy casualty since the launch of war to date, and faced by numerous non-uniformed Chinese paramilitaries and spies attacking them from the darkness (very much like the current fashion in Iraq when US GIs are being attacked by the terrorist elements), were naturally smoldering with resentment and thus might have went forward to kill lots of guerillas impersonating as civilians.<br /><br />So far, all the voices clamoring and claiming for the existence of the so-called massacre are largely one-sided and uncontested, deriving from only some foreign missionaries' claims (people with strong and inexorable anti-Japanese prejudices in the first place), some Chinese civilians claiming to be directly involved in the incident (the likelihood of deliberate planning and instructing by the premeditated Chinese government cannot be dismissed), as well as some renegade Japanese soldiers (likely as a result of their capture and wanton brainwashing at the hands of the Chinese Communists, the ChiCom). There have been no absolutely indisputable and convincing facts to prove and support the factualness of the Nanking Massacre whose authenticity and magnitude as presented by the Chinese side are indeed seriously questionable and most probably false and fictitious.<br /><br />It is widely known as a incontrovertible fact the Japanese general responsible for the vanquishing of the Chinese and the subjugating of Nanking is the famous and eminent Iwane Matsui whose is renowned for his mild and clement disposition, and more importantly, his affection for China and Chinese culture and his long time yearning for fostering a stronger bond between the two nations of China and Japan. And it is also a widely known and acknowledged fact that the Japanese military, as compared to its Chinese counterpart, was a highly disciplined troop with strict code of conduct on treating civilians leniently. Many historical facts during the war which were artificially twisted and warped out of shape in order to bedevil and revile Japan turned out the ruse and chicanery of the communist China. One of the most notable instance was the so-called \\"Hacking One hundred\\" incident occurring in the so-called Nanking Massacre in which two Japanese officers were accused and convicted and executed by the hatred-crazed, vengeful and rancorous Chinese side for the so-called holding a contest of killing Chinese civilians using their sabers and each of them killed more than 100 Chinese guys, which of course, was technically and realistically impossible. What a travesty of justice and what a farce!<br /><br />It is widely reported and properly documented that soon after the fall of Nanking, the streets of the city are fully in order, teeming with peddlers, shops are open for business and people are smiling. It is hard to imagine that merely tow weeks ago there had been a massive massacre which is obviously non-existent. May I repeat, a comparatively small scale mopping-out operation by the Japanese army against plain clothes Chinese militaries on sabotage and disruption of the order are possible and reasonable, while a killing spree against Chinese civilians is both unthinkable and unfounded. By the way, it is alleged that the Chinese government put the human skeletons left in the violent brawls during its own ten year long Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976 in the current Nanking Massacre Memorial Hall to attract eyeballs and vilify Japan. How does that sound to you guys?<br /><br />It is also unfathomable and unbelievable that more than 300,000 Chinese were slaughtered in such a short period, whose corpses disposed so quickly and without leaving any traceable signs. As a matter of fact, the Chinese themselves altered and inflated the death toll number willfully and repeatedly. The initial number claimed is several thousand to twenty thousand at the time of the trial of Japan at the end of the war, then steadily growing up but still within ten thousand, and finally reaching the current bloated and astronomical number of three hundred thousand. And it is reputed to be still growing. Meanwhile, the total death toll on the Chinese side in this Sino-Japanese War keeps growing all the time from several hundred thousand to the present whopping and staggering figure of thirty million. How do these shamelessly self-serving bloody lies sound to those blindly pro-Chinese and Japan-bashing, obstinate, myopic and stupidly \\"Panda-hugging\\" western liberals?<br /><br />The list of purposefully and spitefully traducing Japan, and viciously and brazenly distorting history to meet its own needs and justify its own existence by the notoriously dishonest and duplicitous ChiCom regime which has had no qualm committing grossly and monstrously heinous crimes against its own people and other nations goes on with no apparent end. The cause of the Sin-Japanese War, according to many people in the world under-informed if not totally ignorant on the part of history, seems to be an unprovoked aggression from the Japanese side, which, however, cannot be further from truth. As a Chinese myself with moral conscience and having conducted reading and surveying for years on this very subject, I've come to a full discovery and a thorough understanding of the real reason hidden beneath the surface. While acknowledging the wrongness of Japan's reckless and indiscreet rash into war for leveling the rampantly anti-Japanese Chinese who had already committed repeated massacres and brutalities on Japanese civilians residing in China before the war (the Jinan Incident, the Tongzhou Incident etc.) and its dog-sure temerity and  overconfidence of defeating china quickly, the Sino-Japanese War was actually a result of long time careful plotting by the Moscow, the Mao Zedong-led ChiCom outlaws who joint hands and conspired and connived to provoke and drive Japan into such a war in order to first, save their own ass from being kicked to pulp by the legitimate KMT government then led by General Chiang Kai-shek, and to build their own power and bid their own time hoping to defeat the nationalist KMT and unifying china under the banner of soviet-style communism one day in the future. The scheme paid off handsomely as the dashing Japanese foolishly swallowed this bait and played right into their hands by launching an expedition of revenge against the KMT government which only benefited the commies and the Soviet ultimately.<br /><br />That lead us to a scientific conclusion on the justice (or injustice) issue of the Sino-Japanese War: Technically Japan fired the first shot, but the actual first shot was fired by the soviet and the ChiCom in collusion and connivance in a premeditated and thoroughly calculated maneuver to drag and ensnare Japan into a long and exhausting war with a pre-planned and decisive outcome of shattering the pre-war world structure and generating a new post-war order to their own utmost interests and in which they two will undoubtedly be the biggest beneficiaries.<br /><br />There are well known facts on the general conducts by the Japanese army fighting and stationing in China during the 1937-1945 Sino-Japanese War. While there unavoidably have been lone and separate brutalities committed by rogue elements of the Imperial Japanese Army, as there had been such incidents in all the war time atrocities involving different nations throughout the human history, the troop as a whole has very reason to be deemed as better disciplined and better behaved than that of most of other countries. In effect, not only big cities, but also the remote villages where the alleged atrocities happened most frequently and drastically according to Chinese propaganda, the fact turned out exactly opposite. Many villages voluntarily teamed up with the advancing Japanese and organized vigilantes for common defense against the common threat and the real plunderer, robbers and rapists --- Not the Japanese, but the Chinese military which are in may parts composed of and heavily tinted by bandit and hooligan elements. I read memoir stories written by old Chinese about how the local villages in Henan Province where he lived organized to disarm the wicked local Chinese garrisons and welcomed the Japanese troops into their town. And how the Japanese treated the locals nicely with manner and politeness, and bought their needs with money and seldom posed as hectoring and browbeating toward the local peasants.<br /><br />In one word, event though the Japanese might hardly be gentlemen, they were at least no were (if not much better) than the Chinese troops supposed to protect its own people but often chose to rob and rape and terrorize and ride roughshod over their own people and only knows to flee really fast when the enemy comes. All these facts have long been deliberately hidden form the public knowledge and examination by the ChiCom regime who have, in the mean time, concocted and churned out numerous fake records and synthesized photos attesting to the non-existing Japanese war time atrocities in make it a rallying and justifying force for itself in the increasingly opened up Chinese society in this Internet age where its own legitimacy is being increasingly challenged by its own corruption, ineptitude and the incalculable smoldering domestic problems resultantly.<br /><br />The dramatically changed post-Second World War situation to the great disadvantage of US and the democratic camp in which US soon lost China to the emboldened and strengthened ChiCom, and the Soviet running rampant and dominating the whole east Europe and confronting and challenging US all over the world is, by and large, the negative net result of the Sino-Japanese and US-Japanese wars plotted and designed by a viciously and ruthlessly crafty Stalin and Mao Zedong, a inept Chiang Kai-shek, a rash and arrogant Tojo, and a deeply and inexorably prejudiced anti-Japanese FDR who has had an mystical and inextricable affection of the Chinese culture, and a sense of guilt and sympathy toward China on the one hand, and an seemingly innate grudge and hatred toward Japan and the Japanese culture on the other hand, who had openly and loudly preached: \\"Oh, God, How I hate Japan!\\" in early 1930's long before the outbreak of war, and had subsequently engaged in a policy of viciously and ruthlessly isolating Japan politically, strangling Japan economically by depriving it of all the resources and imports, which finally culminated in pressurized and cornered Japan into its reluctant but ineluctable preemptive attack of the Pearl Harbor and the bloody war ensuing later which could have been averted in the first place had FDR chose another path of condoning and coexisting if not cooperating with Japan. A profound tragedy for both American and Japanese people, indeed! It is now safe and accurate to say that the real winners of the 1937-1945 war is the USSR, the ChiCom founder of the PRC in 1949; and the real losers are Japan, Chiang Kai-shek's KMT China, and the U.S. and A. thanks to the fatuous and injudicious judgment of all the members of the losing side.<br /><br />Now after more than sixty years since the end of the wear, it is an undeniable and indisputable commonsense knowledge for a great majority of literate People in the world that Japan is a stable, prosperous, peaceful and pacifist, genuine and fully-fledged democracy the same as United States, and the two shoulder a common mission and responsibility of contributing to the global freedom and stability as two pillars for the democratic camp. While China, albeit its exponentially expanding and exploding juggernaut-like economy largely aided and sustained by the western investment, is still, and all the more, a dictatorial country with vaunting and dangerous ambitions. Through years of tireless and exorbitant arms building and power accumulation in the past two decades, China is emerging quickly as a chest-pounding, muscle-flexing, saber-rattling and swashbuckling power bent on intimidating and even conquering its neighbors from Taiwan to Japan, and to seek and establish its won ultimate hegemony by eventually defeating and displacing the declining and debilitated America while busily and incessantly slaughtering hundred of thousands of Tibetans, Mongolians, Eastern Turks and other ethnic minorities, arresting and torturing political dissidents and persecuting Christians and other religious believers. I'm afraid this nightmarish scenario is coming true slowly but perhaps irreversibly seeing a distracted and demoralized US economically held hostage by and diplomatically dependent on China more and more, and the latter becoming a trillion foreign reserve-amassing, satellite-destroying technology-mastering, increasingly confident and emboldened hyper-power. It might be concluded that current world situation, particularly one that concerning the US-Japan-China trilateral relations are dangerously tipping toward the advantage of the totalitarian communist and nationalist China. How does this strike you China-loving guys? Don't you feel overjoyed and ecstatic?<br /><br />One final anecdote which I learned before long that contributes the illustration of the irrefutable and stark reality pertaining to the current Japan and China as a totally passive and prostrate pacifist country and a revanchist, militaristic and bellicose one respectively is as follows: On the Chinese side, a government-sanctioned very influential website of China conducted an online opinion poll to the masses of Chinese youngsters many of who are Japan and America-hating, war-mongering, China-uber-alles ultra-nationalists thanks to the years of incessant nationalistic indoctrination and inculcation by the ChiCom government. One of the questions goes like this: If you are a Chinese solider fighting a war for your fatherland, will you shoot enemy captives including woman and child civilians of the enemy side if ordered to do so by your commanders? A majority of the polled answered \\"Yes\\", some say they don't know, and only a tiny minority questioned the moral righteousness of such a behavior. This is the true state of the popular mindset of the current China, a \\"peacefully\\" rising giant and the host of 2008 Olympic Games. About Japan the news is that last an influential international organization conducted a significant opinion polls asking a large number of people from more than thirty countries to express their approval or disapproval to a dozen of major countries in the world including US, Britain, Germany, France, Russia, China, Japan etc. While the number of the people from countries that gave negative rating are more than that of those giving positive rating on China by a no small margin; only TWO countries out the thirty something countries rated Japan negatively, while a huge and overwhelming majority of the group of countries rated Japan very positively, a decisive and powerful endorsement and just appraisal of the nature of Japan and the role it plays as a peaceful, democratic, helpful and responsible country in today's world.<br /><br />I believe this hard and unmistakable fact demonstrated in people's votes around the world will leave those anti-Japanese activists and China apologists dumbfounded and speechless despite their seemingly always deftness in sophistry. By the way, those two countries rating negative about Japan are... who else? Of course China and South Korea! While all those Southeastern Asian countries formerly involved in the war no longer view Japan negatively but as a genuinely democratic and free country, only China and Korea bear the stubborn and unreasonable rancor against Japan in willful disregard of the reality. And they will probably try to cultivate and exploit that self-pitying and self-deluding card forever for abject and ugly selfish aims. But the people in the world have sharp eyes and cannot be easily duped and deceived by their propaganda. As we all know: It is a malicious, unscrupulous and ambitious China, not an aging, peace-minded and ingenuous Japan, that is the real potential threat and danger to the free world.ities involving different nations throughout the human history, the troop as a whole has very reason to be deemed as better disciplined and better behaved than that of most of other countries.

B0041B785Y|5.0|What an astonishing display of power that 2012 has yet to have seen so far this year. It sounds like they are going back to the slow, groovy sound they had on their 2002 opus \\"Nothing\\", combined with the dynamic songwriting of their 1995 opus \\"Destroy Erase Improve\\". The result is a very focused and hypnotizing release that pounds every Djent poser ripping off from this band into submission. This is a big step up from their previous album, 2008's ObZen (which I also loved), and just may be one of this year's greatest releases. Great job to Meshuggah once again for delivering some pretty mind blowing experimental metal. Truly a master of their art.

006197806X|4.0|When I first began this book, I was concerned.  The first one-third of the book did not draw me in.  Whereas Delirium ended with my heart somewhere in my throat, Pandemonium just laid there, almost as if Lauren Oliver did not know what direction to go in or what story she wanted to tell.<br /><br />By the middle of the book, the story settles down a bit and you are right there with Lena and Julian as they fight for their futures.  But the last 100 or so pages, you heart is right back there in your throat as you turn the pages and wonder along with Lena what the future could possibly hold.  Then bam, you are at an ending that I did not see coming, but fully wondered if it was possible.<br /><br />In book two, Lauren Oliver sends you in a slightly different direction; Lena is now emotionally alone in the Wilds and with the help of a ragtag group, moves along to her new future still mourning her past life with Alex.  Told in a then and now style, the reader sees where Lena is in her present day and shows slowly and methodically how she got there.  How Julian, the son of the DFA leader, can be both her nemesis and her salvation.  How Lena must open her eyes and realize that not all people are as they appear, that she is being told only little bits and pieces of the whole story and that quite possibly what she thought was the truth might just be part of an even bigger lie.<br /><br />An author can make or break a trilogy with the second book.  They may know where they want to end, but getting from part A to Part C is a challenge.  By the climax of this book, I think that Ms. Oliver served her characters well.  The resistance is growing, characters are coming in and out of Lena's life that influence her in innumerable ways, but most importantly, Lena is discovering that if she tries, there might be a life for her after Alex -- that was, until she heard the voice from behind the door.

B0077ATSSQ|4.0|Jonathan Safran Foer's popular novel EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE managed to touch many lives with his subtle depiction of the reaction to the horror of the events of 9/11 by assigning the perception to a bright, Asperger's Syndrome-afflicted young boy named Oskar Schell whose father was one of the inexplicable deaths on that `worst day'. Eric Roth has done the near impossible task of translating Safran Foer's language and method of storytelling into a film script that for the most part works on every level. As directed with the inordinate sensitivity of Stephen Daldry the impact of not only the book, but also a restoration of the events of that fateful day in the history of this country, are unveiled in a manner that not only makes a long film seem short but also is able to tie together the various characters and incidents of this story on film that provides on of the most sensitive bouquets of the meaning of the Family of Man.<br /><br />Oskar Schell is inhabited by Thomas Horn, a youngster making his first film and his lack of expected sophistication of acting only makes this terrified but determined lad more credible.  Tom Hanks is Oskar's beloved jeweler father who leaves voice mails during the collapse of the buildings, messages that Oskar keeps to himself (we find out later why), not even sharing the connect with his grieving mother (Sandra Bullock).  Through a series of discoveries Oskar finds a key in an envelope with the single word `Black' on it and he sets out to find the source of the key and in doing so reconnected with his deceased father. He is joined by the mute Renter (Max von Sydow) who lives next to his Grandma (Zoe Caldwell) and together they comb New York meeting everyone with the name of Black - and in the process we encounter some superb cameos by Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright, John Goodman, an uncredited appearance by Eddie Izzard and many more. Oskar's journey finally comes to an end in a most touching way as the truths are revealed.<br /><br />The surprise of this film is the manner in which as much attention is subtly played with the amalgamation of people that comprise New York: children and adults with mental disorders, Jews, African Americans, immigrants of all sorts, fey cross dressers, angry people, kind people - everyone has a story that is equally important as Oskar's pursuit. This technique magnifies the message of Safran Foer's story - that we are all linked by a common bond. This film is an experience. Share it.

So when this book came out, I bought it immediately.  Now, I buy a lot of business books and I don't always finish reading them.  This one I read in one sitting on a Saturday morning over my coffee.  I couldn't put it down.  I appreciate the way it leads you through the development of your personal business model and the personal examples shared by others and I am now using it to work my way through the development of my own one-pager (using lots of scratch paper along the way).  If you are looking for a framework to capture your career plan and a process for putting it together, this book is a great guide.
0739358138|1.0|He was a stereotypical New Yorker: rude, crude, vulgar, and obnoxious. He would also lie, cheat, and steal from anyone. He ran a boiler room brokerage, full of young, addicted, greedy dealers who were little versions of himself. He hated his second wife unless he was lusting for her, so he cheated on her with prostitutes frequently, and she knew it. He was always high on prescriptions, alcohol, narcotics and sometimes all three and in huge amounts.<br /><br />The story is not very compelling, unless you just want to see if he can possibly be even more audacious in the next chapter. Belfort spent way too much time presenting his second wife and their constant drama -two people always in conflict who must have been addicted to each other and the superficial, material lives they led. The two were simply driven by compulsion and could not sacrifice any aspect of their selves for one another or for their children.<br /><br />Belfort should have spent time on how he got into the industry, how he created his firm, and how he went over to the dark side. He writes well enough that the telling of the story is not too painful, except for the exorbitant amount of space he gave to his second wife and their relationship, and the amount cursing he used which becomes pathetic. By the time he gets around to the big bust that sends him away, he rushes to a closure leaving you wondering \\"why the heck did I spend so much time on this worthless piece of dribble.\\" Finally as he is indicted his second wife leaves him, but she did not find the courage earlier in the years of mutual verbal abuse, or after the physical abuse when he was delusional in a narcotic rage and kicked his wife in the stomach and risked his daughter's life by trying to drive away. Do not read this book if you value your time, good story telling, and any kind of information that you would consider \\"knowledge\\".

B00756GKBA|3.0|Much has been made about Madonna's 12th studio disc MDNA leading up to it's release, not the least of which is her reunion with primary RAY OF LIGHT technician William Orbit and hopes that said reunion will lead to a \\"classic\\" Madonna album after the rather indifferent reception of 2008's highly undervalued HARD CANDY.  Having listened to the disc front to back six or seven times, I learned a couple of things.  One, that William Orbit is something of a one-trick pony, with RAY OF LIGHT being akin to lightning-in-a-bottle as far as he's concerned(many forget that Patrick Leonard, who helped craft standard-bearers \\"Live To Tell\\", \\"Like A Prayer\\" and \\"Cherish\\" among others, also contributed strongly to ROL); his further contributions to the Madonna canon on MUSIC were essentially retreads of prior RAY OF LIGHT superiors and/or rip-offs of '99's retro-sounding \\"Beautiful Stranger\\".  Two, that rather than reunite with Orbit for yet more of the same--\\"I'm A Sinner\\" reboots \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" yet again while adding a couple of \\"Ray of Light\\"'s guitar chords--how great would it have been to instead reteam with Leonard, who remains, in my opinion, her strongest collaborator?  Having said that, MDNA has it's share of decent moments interspersed among some fairly pedestrian tracks.  In the context of the whole album, \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" and \\"Give Me All Your Luvin\\", which I dismissed as Madonna's weakest one-two singles salvo ever upon initial listen, don't sound quite as terrible; \\"Girl Gone Wild\\", in particular, has managed to become an earworm upon repeated listens.  And, again upon several listens, I can almost understand Madonna's/the label's decision to release those two tracks as singles; not since AMERICAN LIFE has there been such a dearth of surefire radio hits on a Madonna album.  Typically, you're looking at four to five definite singles--at least--but here that's not the case.  There are some good songs here--the regrettably titled \\"Gang Bang\\" is an excellent stab at industrial techno, \\"Turn Up The Radio\\" and \\"Superstar\\" are both melodically pleasing, and \\"Some Girls\\" has a nice insistent dance thump to it--but I can't personally imagine hearing any of those on the radio any time soon(not that they shouldn't be, mind you).  And some of these tracks just stick out like a sore thumb; \\"I Don't Give A\\" is utterly juvenile, while the set closing ballads, though both lovely, are completely out of place in the context of the album(\\"Beautiful Killer\\" and \\"I F---ed Up\\" would've made more since as album tracks and the ballads sequestered to the bonus disc).  All in all, this is far from a complete disaster and as a dance album it ain't half bad.  As a Madonna album, however, I'd probably rank it second behind AMERICAN LIFE as her weakest studio effort (of course, I'm also of the theory that the highly underrated BEDTIME STORIES ranks squarely behind LIKE A PRAYER and ahead--yes, ahead--of RAY OF LIGHT as one of her three creative benchmarks so take my opinion as you will).t industrial techno, \\"Turn Up The Radio\\" and \\"Superstar\\" are both melodically pleasing, and \\"Some Girls\\" has a nice insistent dance thump to it--but I can't personally imagine hearing any of those on the radio any time soon(not that they shouldn't be, mind you).

B000001G5H|5.0|Even 40 years after its release, Pollini's recording of the Chopin Etudes is still the best.  This album was one of the first classical records I ever bought on vinyl in the 1970s; it was astonishing then, and it makes the transition to CD in grand style.<br /><br />I had hesitated to buy this album on CD, because I am trying to convert my collection to as many digital recordings as possible.  However, even though it is an analog recording, it still rises above any other performance.  BUY IT!
B007KQ6XYY|1.0|it wont install on my kindle fire!!!!!!! I really want to play it but I cant plz some one help me
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Once you start reading this series you can't wait to read the next book let alone watch the HBO series!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|the best since the original!!! if you can't afford it why buy the fire!?  bee gsmeplay features and already rovio shows future updates. so defiently a great price for a commonly update app

B004T4LUPW|5.0|This is the best Android calendar app that I've found! Able to import my corporate Microsoft Outlook calendar into Google calendar effortlessly.  Works wonderfully (no bugs) on my Kindle Fire.  Finally able to give up my bulky Day Runner agenda and just slip my KF into my purse and my entire calendar is always with me. WiFi not required to use calendar and it will automatically sync as soon as you do have WiFi. Super options like inserting last call # into new event and being very user-friendly made it the ideal scheduling app for my husband's Droid 3 cell phone - a must for his construction company!  I do recommend tweaking your options and preferences in settings directly thru Google calendar webpage - not thru mobile app. But do it once and you're up and running.
B004A8ZWWO|4.0|Something about this movie hit the spot for me.  It wasn't side splittingly funny or all that original, but it was very entertaining.  The characters pulled off their roles just right from the bad guy to the movie stealing maid.  I even watched the gag real which I always forget to do.  Worth the time to watch.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I got this app bc I was tired of waking up to the same annoying buzzer on my alarm clock. This app lets you use ur own music as an alarm so now I wake up every morning to music I want to hear!
B006Z21ZJC|5.0|By now if you're a Maiden fan, you know they like to treat their fans to a new compilation or live album every once in a while. So here we have En Vivo: Live At Estadio Nacinal, Santiago. Filmed in front of 50,000 Chilean fans, even before purchasing this concert, I knew it would be great. There's something about the South American fans and the concerts held there that are just phenomenal, previous proof is in the now classic Rock In Rio show. So, how does this show hold up to the other Maiden live releases?<br /><br />Excellent. From the setlist of the new songs, the performances of them, the new stage and Eddie, this concert and band are on full throttle. The band is amazingly prowess and in great form executing the songs. The show opener is great, the crowd is absolutely fantastic, singing right along to the brand new title-track. Bruce can amazingly still hit those highs, check out The Talisman, which happens to be one of my personal favs off the Final Frontier. Even though there are usual suspects played again and again and again, the band still finds a way to breath new life in them some way, some how.<br /><br />Now on the DVD/Blu-ray visual and audio, both are fantastic. The split screen shots of the concert really do justice to the huge band Maiden have now become, and the producers of the film really did a great job editing and shooting them. The audio is crisp and the mix sounds great. The bonus 'Behind The Beast' documentary is very, very insightful on the band's Final Frontier world tour. You really learn how much work and stress is put in to making these concerts just right every night. Also included is the promo video for the Final Frontier and a mini-doc on how it was made. Overall, this is great addition to any Maiden fan's library, and if you attended any part of this tour, a great momento of this incredible band at what they do best.<br /><br />Now on a final side note, I am still anticipating on the History of Iron Maiden part 3 as many other fans might be. Here's hoping they will continue the series, and possibly record this years Maiden England throw-back tour, and include it on there? But for now, this concert should hold us fans over. Up The Irons!s might be. Here's hoping they will continue the series, and possibly record this years Maiden England throw-back tour, and include it on there?

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very nice Downton Abby DVD (Season 2), super fast service & delivery. This was a gift so I was very pleased.  I also bought the (Season 1) DVD and the Downton Abbey book as well.  The entire package is a must-have for fans.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I have seen many many movies in 2011 and By far the best movie I have seen. The acting is phenomenal the whole movie is suspenseful. I haven't read a book in a really long time and after seeing this movie that night I bought the book it is just a brilliant brilliant story/movie.
B006QPVH6O|2.0|This movie didn't have enough scary parts in it. It's not like there weren't any scary parts in it, there just needed to be more. The beggining to this movie is VERY boring! Once they go onto space, it gets a little bit more interesting. However, it's still pretty boring. I woudn't reccomend buying this
B004P4S4NM|5.0|What an amazingly gifted artist. After listening to all the songs, I went out to find the lyrics as well. Easy purchasing through Amazon, they definitely have it figured out.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I don't like long, drawn out reviews so I'll keep this fairly short.  Game of Thrones is an ADULT fantasy story, period.<br />The HBO production of Game of Thrones follows the book version almost perfectly. It portrays the story exactly the way I had imagined it when I read the book.  That being said, those reviewers who are calling it bad porn have obviously not read the book. It is an often brutally graphic story and the sex scenes are there, like it or not.  Without this, the story would be just an impotent fairy tale version of the true meaning of the book.  I have some advice for those who are too sensitive to view this series.  Turn the power switch of your DVD or BluRay player OFF. Another alternative is for those viewers to buy and watch a copy of Finding Nemo or Tin Tin. Game of Thrones is not for you.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I raced through this book as fast as I did its predecessor, The Hunger Games.  At the end of The Hunger Games, there are a few unanswered questions that are a teaser as to what might possibly occur in this second book in the series.  After starting Catching Fire, I was immediately plunged back into the action and once again caught up in the personal stories of the main characters but nothing prepared me for the roller coaster ride of this book.  It continues the stories of Katniss Everdeen, the heroine, Peeta Mellark, her fellow \\"tribute\\" from District 12, and Gale, a friend of Katniss' from District 12.  What I wasn't prepared for was a whole new set of characters who \\"wormed\\" their way into my emotions.  I don't want to post any spoilers for either book but this second book in the series had so many twists and turns and unexpected events that I literally could not put it down!!  There were several placed where I was moved to tears and had to get out the Puffs so that I could wipe my eyes and continue to read.  The ONLY criticism I have is that I found one (and only one) typo in the whole book but even that didn't take away from the emotions, the growth of the relationships in the book, and the unexpected ending (which only left me wanting to immediately start reading the third book in the series).  If you liked The Hunger Games, you'll love Catching Fire!!
B00729GQ0A|4.0|I read this on a recommendation, and I'm glad I did. The Forever Girl offers a new take on God, vampires and werewolves, where even \\"The Universe\\" is flawed and makes mistakes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a fantastic read and I found it very hard to put down.  For two nights in a row I read until after midnight because I was so riveted by this story.  It tears at your heart and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Again, I don't want to put any spoilers in here.  Suffice it to say that the ending to this trilogy does not disappoint in any way.  In fact, I found that each succeeding book in the series was better than the previous one was (and that's saying a lot because I found The Hunger Games a fascinating read).  I find it very hard to see how movie makers are going to be able to include all the subtle nuances, emotions, and action of the books.  I have already heard from several friends that the movie doesn't live up to the book (even though the movie is supposed to be quite good).  I highly encourage anyone who is at all interested in post-apocalyptic fiction or just science fiction to read The Hunger Games.  I almost guarantee you will be hooked and will have to finish the series!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Love being able to chose any translation. Underlining and note taking pretty easy to use. Some features require wifi, no problem if your Church or where ever you read has it. Overall, pretty cool. But I still love my old paper Bible more.

0439023513|5.0|After the first two books I had in my mind a mapped out ending of how this last book would go. Katniss would kill Snow in a big epic sequence of events, she would choose the man she loved most, and Panem would no longer be a horrid place.<br /><br />Well that was not how this book went at all. And at first I was very dissapointed to realize that all my previous ideas were getting twisted to something I no longer recognized. But then I stopped trying to predict what I thought should happen and I just read it how it was happening.<br /><br />By the end of the book I realized how true and how perfect the ending was. This book series was never a \\"fairytale\\" story. In war things don't end with sunshine and butterflies. They end with broken people trying to pick up the pieces of there life and put them back together the best way they can. That is the most heroic effort of all. Not killing President Snow, not defeating an entire army all by yourself. No, a true hero is someone who has been through hell and decides to still try to move forward despite the pain and difficulty of each day. Kudos to Suzanne Collins for giving a generation of people far detached from real war, the chance to realize that it isn't glorious or rewarding. It's heartbreaking and you are never the same.<br /><br />I've read lots of bad reviews of this book and many of my friends and family hated it, but for me I couldn't have imagined a better ending.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I have struggled with having a million pieces of paper every where and not being able to find things I have noted for years. I am so grateful to Evernote. It changed my life. Very easy to use and organize with.

B000SGSU58|4.0|I enjoy his style of writing.  Great way to unwind and escape.  I like the fact that the book takes place in Los Angeles and I can identify with many of the locals.<br /><br />Schotzie
B0041OJ0Y8|5.0|I love this album. Die Antwoord is so different and original mixing in South African culture with rap, techno and rave. The lyrics flow between Afrikaans and English. Each song on the album is unique. Go buy the album!!!!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Awesome you should get the app.It is so fun but the game is easy to beat it. Try it! !!!!
B005NKGEP2|2.0|As others have mentioned, the pre-pub reviews were gushing all over like spilled ink spreading out in newsprint.  Or something like that.  While I must respect anyone's effort to write a mystery-crime book and weave all the little threads in at the right moment, The Expats was really a great disappointment.  It wasn't that the plot -- however implausible it might be -- wasn't at least a bit amusing; it was that the characters were not only not amusing but ciphers.  It was impossible for me to care about any one of them because they were so one-dimensional and, sorry to say, boring.  I struggled through to the end primarily because I had paid good money for it, but it was not a happy experience.  And also like others who have written, I am duly astounded that so many people actually thought it was a good book.  What in the world is going on here?
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy playing Solitaire, it has been one of my favotite games, since I was a kid. love it
B0038M2AZA|4.0|Thouroughly enjoyed the visuals as well as the ingenious techniques she used to calm herself.I have a grandson, now 21, and we used a lot if those efforts to keep him calm and secure. I also have worked with a 13-year-old for the past seven years, and all of the new types of eqipment available. The movie is a wonderful tool for teaching thise who are predudiced or simply do not understand autism.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read all 3 on the kindle, good book, ready to see the movie and see how it adds up to the books
B004SIP9U6|5.0|This is by far one of the best romantic comedies of all time, and in my personal top ten movies.  It's a comedy for smart people, a romance for anyone who has been in love.  Watching this movie always makes me want to reread Romeo and Juliet and the Tempest.  Seeing Gwenyth and Joseph Fiennes perform the \\"first\\" production of Romeo and Juliet in the movie still gives me chills.  The recreation of the Globe theater is fabulous, and seeing the rabble watch the performance on the floor of the Globe is truly amazing.  I know the movie isn't exactly historically accurate, but I imagine that some of those feelings were really true to life.<br /><br />Great fun!
0670022411|5.0|The combination of a strong female character, excitement of the twists and turns and real life history woven in, make this book impossible to put down.  It's well written, smooth flowing story makes you fall in love with the characters after only a few chapters.  It is a mature reading that doesn't assume you need more explanation that what is given.  (not a simple, Young Adult read) One of the best supernatural books in many years!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game on my phone and kindle I play at lunch. It really is a great set of games to play.
1587613379|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in enjoying a more free, open sexual life. Dossie and Janet, through clear writing and warm respect for the acknowledged difficulty of operating in a way \\"other\\" than most of society would have us operate, share solid, actionable views on being polyamorous. For me personally and directly, The Ethical Slut helped me figure out exactly HOW to talk about what I was looking for with those I talk with about relationships.<br /><br />A particularly powerful concept they discuss is how important it is to look at life NOT through a mentality of a \\"starvation economy.\\" I can't do it justice here, but it's absolutely eye-opening and like certain other books about relationships (both non-fiction and fiction), reading this book can often leave you with many of those moment where you say, \\"Ah, someone gets what I've been thinking about!\\"
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is a great new game. Unlike seasons and rio, which were the same as the original, this game has new ideas and concepts that make it challenging.<br />Works great on HTC TB and on the transformer
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I got stuck once even with hints but found help quickly with a google search.  Beautiful graphics.  Challenging enough to keep me interested.  Music pleasant.  Now that I have finished once it will be fun to challenge my kids with it.  They LOVED the easier one by the same maker and can't wait to start this one.

0515142247|2.0|I started reading the Jack Reacher novels three months ago, and this is the sixth one I've read. The novels make for compulsive, page-turning reading. But the author also has a very good eye, a deft turn of phrase, and an interest in recounting facts which have left me with the impression that I'm reading something better than trash.<br /><br />Most reviewers seem to prefer the early novels in the series, but this is my least favorite so far. The story started well, but quickly became implausible. And, in contrast to the later novels, Mr Childs doesn't seem to bother with factual research, and just makes things up, regardless of whether they're right: this undermined the novel a bit for me.<br /><br />It's still a pretty good read, and I'm enjoying it, but I enjoyed all of the others a lot more.
B004UID2LC|2.0|I got this app and worked great on my kindle fire and it scaned as no virus, but after awhile it got a virus
B004ZNAXX2|5.0|Although I was a bit skeptical about paying a heavy sum of money for music I already own , and have owned on most all formats including (8-track and cassette!), I found that I was willing to pay again for newer, updated versions of this great Album.  I don't think the average person would notice much difference in the sound unless possibly you have a $100,000 sound system, but there are suble differences I have picked up on.<br /><br />  The main logic behind my purchase was to get my hands on the Demo track discs for one thing, plus I had already invested in the other two Immersion Sets so figured I'd complete the collection.  The Demo discs are fantastic - I keep finding myself playing them over and over and over.  Bing able to see the first inner workings of this Epic album is truly a great listening experience.<br /><br />  The bottom line is - I think it is a good investment if you happen to have the money laying around...I lucked out and got it preordered a day or so before it's release at a price of $87.  Well worth it at that price.  If you do not own The Wall on any format yet then it is easily worth the heavy price tag which will get you the cool pictures, booklets, and other associated trinkets as well as The Wall and the Live 1980-81 albums.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its so fun and so enjoying. this game has so many games that are so fun but challenging too.

B00756GKBA|5.0|The Queen of Pop is back! And MDNA is a brilliant album full of great songs that are pure Madonna, It's like she has cherry picked all of the best elements from her previous 11 albums and blended it up in to something new and fresh! This is without a doubt one of her best albums!<br />The first single, \\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\\" (Featuring Nicki Minaj & M.I.A.) and the 'Party Rock Remix' of its, featuring LMFAO, definitely is NOT a good representative of the album. It was just a promotional single for the Superbowl, which happened to have crashed into the Top 10 on the Hot 100 and #1 on the Dance chart and become a record-breaking single. The second single, \\"Girl Gone Wild\\", would be a way better representative of the album. But GGW itself it just too joyful and generic which is not exactly the best taste you could taste from the album either. The album itself is a little more dark, an evolutioned \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\" I'd say. But it's not all dance tracks. There are heart-wrecking ballads and certain mid-tempos, and of course some songs that really have the throwback feeling to music of Madge's earlier days. I'd say it's hard to get ONE song to sum up the entire album, so listen to everything and decide on yourself. But one hint's here: The songs with features are NOT the best ones, this I can assure you.<br /><br />Highlight tracks: Gang Bang, Im addicted, Turn up the radio, Falling Free, Love Spent and Beautiful Killer.<br /><br />Madonna, once again proves that she's here to stay, and slay!

0439023521|3.0|It took some time to sort out why I was disappointed in this book.  I wondered if it was the writing, the main character, the whole premise of the book, or if it was simply that I'm an adult reading a novel for adolescents, so I was expecting too much.  I don't think it's this last one, though, for a few reasons.  So I started looking at some of the things that bothered me about the book, and I think what it really boils down to is the writing and the author's choice of first person, present tense point of view.<br /><br />Too often the author felt the need to \\"tell\\" what is happening with the character by having her state what's going on, rather than letting it show, or *only* letting it show.  I know this might be difficult in first person POV, but it can be done.  (I think the novel would've been stronger if she had just chosen a different mode.)<br /><br />(****spoiler alert****)<br />The most cringe-worthy moment  of Katniss pointing out the obvious is in chapter 18 a little bit after  the 12-year old tribute dies.  Right when it happens, we hear Katniss' thoughts, how she finally understands something Peeta had said, and she takes actions that show something in her has changed.  Then she gets the bread from the little girl's district, and I actually got a little teary-eyed.  I thought that was such a great moment--the best in the book.  Just a few pages later, though, we hear Katniss start prattling on in her mind about how Rue's death changed her, how now she wants revenge, blah, blah, blah.  The author shouldn't have had to point that out.  We knew (or we hoped), that something in her changed.  We saw what she did in the meadow before they took the body away, how she saluted her fellow tribute.  We saw when Katniss slipped into a brief depression, didn't want to get out of the tree, didn't want to move anymore, and had to order herself to get going.  The author should have left it alone.  Having Katniss point out the obvious like this makes her seem more self-absorbed and shallow than what is probably intended.  But, too, her stating that she wants revenge at this point isn't really a change.  She already hates the Capitol, what it does to starve people to death in her own district, and she raves against it with Gale in the woods all the time.  So what's new there?  I don't know.  I guess it's just that she's finally coming to realize it?  So is it just that she's learned something about herself here?  The change I suppose I was looking for was for her to actually step outside of herself and her emotional angst just a little more, start being able to connect to others a little better, to risk trusting people (other than girls who remind her of her harmless sister), to see they have a common cause (the other district sent her that precious loaf of bread!!).  But instead she just continues being suspicious and of others' motives all the time.<br /><br />The scene of Katniss' depression brings me to another point.  I thought it was odd that she doesn't think of her mother's own struggle with depression after her father's death.  Yes, Katniss does far better than her mother in recovering, but it makes her seem pretty shallow and self-absorbed to not be just a little bit humbled in her judgment of her mother.  As a kid, she has every right to be angry that her mother didn't take care of her and her sister.  But, as a book for young adults, this would be a great moment to see some character development, to see Katniss growing into a more aware adult.  Even just a little.  Maybe she doesn't completely forgive her mother, but maybe she understands her a little better.  I think her own emotional wounds, like her mother's, have led her to cut herself off from others.<br />(***End Spoilers***)<br /><br />I don't mean to say that I think Katniss should be some perfect hero.  I prefer my characters to be complex, to have struggles, to be not-quite-good or not-quite-bad.  The characters in the Song of Fire and Ice (Game of Thrones)series are excellent examples.  But Katniss didn't come across as very complex at all to me.  Her constant questioning of everyone's motives and going on and on about not wanting to owe people makes her pretty tiresome after a while.  I think she has the potential to be a lot more compelling, and I mostly blame the writing choices for her character falling so flat.  Maybe she'll do more growing the subsequent books.  I hope so, because I still plan to read them, just to see.  If I'm still left disappointed, at least I've only lost a few days of reading.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I also find the whole world of the Hunger Games fairly unbelievable, too.  I reread Ender's Game a few years ago, and I liked it nearly as much as when I read it in high school.  That's one reason why I don't think my problems with the The Hunger Games can be chalked up to it being fiction for young adults.  Like Katniss, Ender goes through some pretty horrible abuses at the hands of the state, but I never found myself getting weary of Ender or being unable to suspend my disbelief.  I've ready plenty of dystopian books, but I found myself more confused by this world than drawn into it.  I haven't put my finger on why this is, but have a sense that there's a disjunct between this tyrannical government and the way the Hunger Games are broadcast as reality TV.  Something about this arrangement doesn't seem quite believable to me.  Maybe it's because I've never watched that much reality TV?  Or maybe it's just the limited first-person POV again?<br /><br />I've giving it 3 stars because Amazon says this means I think \\"it's okay\\" rather than two stars, which means \\"I don't like it.\\"  Probably, I'm somewhere in between.  It's a quick read, and worth reading to know the story everyone's talking about.  And I can't help but like most dystopian novels, regardless of their flaws, because it's always interesting to take a peek into some crazy, things-gone-wrong world that someone has invented.

A soundtrack is even included!  A wonderful color, hardbound book about the movie and postcards from Salzburg are beautiful.  The best keepsake is a music box (possibly ceramic?) that plays \\"My Favorite Things.\\"  It was such a surprise, I love it!  All comes bound in a keepsake box all within the theme of favorite things.<br /><br />This limited edition set is well worth the money.  Anyone who the loves the film will be delighted to own this.  The musical is beautifully restored, and the extras are such wonderfully crafted treats.  Much care and thought went into this package, and it shows!<br /><br />The music and story are timeless, and are brilliant on Blu ray.  The bonus features are so numerous, I have not gone through them all yet, but the real life on Trapp family will be my first stop!

I highly recommend this as the most comprehensive The Sound of Music package!  It will be one of your favorite things.
0375869026|4.0|Auggie Pullman loves Star Wars, his family, and his dog. His parents and his big sister Via have always looked out for him, and the folks on his block in upper Manhattan are used to him and care about him too. But now that he's starting fifth grade, his parents decide that it's time for him to venture outside his little world and go to school -- regular school -- where he'll have to deal with a whole lot of new people. That would be a challenge for any kid, but it's especially challenging for Auggie, whose face is not like other kids' faces.<br /><br />But this isn't a depressing, \\"kids-with-issues\\" book. In fact what struck me about it was how much Auggie's struggles are like other kids' struggles. His specific situation gives him difficulties that most other kids don't have to deal with. But he deals with them pretty much the way any kid would -- or maybe a little better. The story is told first from Auggie's point of view, then from his sister's and other characters', so we see the impact of Auggie's facial deformity on others around him as well. The book reminded me of the best of Judy Blume, with its realistic characters of various ages. But it's maybe a tad more optimistic about human nature. Aimed at ages 8 and up, I can see this book being enjoyed by teens and adults as well as younger kids.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|I found the book compelling. I completely understand the author calling the insurgents savages.

Awesome book it opened my eyes as to what our sons and daughters went through.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|I'm a big fan of the first movie and I realize that most subsequent sequels pale in comparison to originals, so my expectations weren't very high with this movie. That said, BDP1 was entertaining, but gets annoying in a few parts. I'm getting a little tired of Jacob's unrequited love, given the circumstances. Bella is with Edward--they're married! Jacob comes off as a pathetic stalker in this movie. So, at the end he \\"imprints\\" on the child. Is he going to stalk her for the rest of her life now? C'mon, dude. Guy needs a membership to an online dating service. \\"Loyal companion seeks a girl who doesn't mind shedding.\\" Also, the characters have become spoofed so much by comedians and \\"Vampires Suck,\\" that it is hard to look at the characters seriously anymore. The overacting by Edward and Bella makes me chuckle as I'm watching what is supposed to be a serious moment. The movie and characters have become caricatures of themselves. It's a little sad, actually. The movie has kind of a been there done that feel for me. The series has definitely run its course. Overall, though, it wasn't a total waste of time. I was entertained and will probably watch Part 2 when it comes out, probably more so that I'd like to see it through. It's like not being able to look away from a car crash on the side of the road.

B002MQYOFW|1.0|My grandmother used to say, \\"If you don't have anything good to say about someone, don't say anything at all.\\"  Well, sorry to disappoint you grandma, but I can't keep my mouth shut on this one.  I have nothing good to say about this book.  I vowed I would never write a bad review on another author, because I am also an author, and bad reviews are painful.  This isn't a personal attack on the author...well, not much...but it is certainly an outcry over her choice of subject matter.  I cannot believe Scholastic published this as a children's book.  Authors create entertainment, but we should and must draw the line somewhere, because we do have, at least in part, some responsibility to society, and that responsibility includes children.  What's next for Scholastic?  Are we going to see books aimed at 4 year olds that start off with \\"See Johnny kill Mikey.\\"  What has society fallen into?  I am appalled at the garbage that is Hunger Games.  Scholastic should issue an apology to every parent on the globe and withdraw this series as required reading in school.  Shameless!!!  This book is nothing but a money maker for an author who obviously only cared about the money and not about the children reading this material. I've written everything from mainstream/literary fiction to romance to suspense and science fiction.  I wrote a book about a serial killer.  I wrote a book about aliens.  I wrote a book about rape.  But I would never stoop so low as to target a young adult or childrens audience with any of the adult material I write.  I would give Hunger Games book negative stars if I could.  People, please think about what you are programming your children with these days.  Their future is in your hands.

Thus, when I found myself face-to-face with an avidly curious 10-year old who had chosen the early 14th century for a school project, I had to buy a copy of this book for her. A few minutes after I had given it to her, I found her engrossed in it. A week later, I asked her to name at least one thing that she had learned from the book. It was thrilling to watch her facial expressions as she considered which answer to present, and then to hear her declare, \\"They pee-ed blood!\\" She obviously devoured a multitude of details, and appreciated the depth and breadth of detail.

B00792EGES|3.0|I've been an AlterBridge fan ever since they've been a group, and couldn't wait for this live concert video to come out.  Great quality, production, etc.  My only beef is the profanity from Myles throughout the concert.  Doesn't add at all to the show.  Certainly this could have been cleaned up post production or Myles could have cleaned things up knowing this was recording live.  Just my two cents worth.  Take away the F bombs, and you get 5 stars.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Next BEST I repeat Next BEST military movie since Black Hawk Down (Naturally it wont beat BHD but next best in my opinion) . A true live action call of duty ultra realistic. I was glued to my seat from beginning to end. Fire fights were exceptional and it gives the viewer a glimpse as to what our military maybe like in a real life setting. This is a must have on blu-ray when available. I surely will be getting my copy when it gets released. Don't sleep on this one a truly go get them kind of movie. This for sure was 100% modeled after COD down to the last scene.
B005X7HAAS|2.0|In a nutshell, the story is bleak, the excess of names convoluted, and the overall execution monotonous. The film is filled with cliches and it is more centered on creating conflict out of insignificant matters for the sake of justifying conflict and murder scenes than on actually developing a story or ever developing any character. If you like mafia films or Japanese productions then you might take a little liking in \\"Outrage\\" but if you just like good films, there isn't much here.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'd never heard of this series before.  After I saw the movie version, I HAD to read the novels.  I downloaded the Kindle version of the trilogy and have been riveted ever since.  I read the whole trilogy in less than a week because I just couldn't put it down.  Everything in the pages, emotions, scenery, smells, and even pain came to life as I read.<br /><br />What else came to life was the feeling that we are heading to a society much like Panem.  People in power fomenting division and hatred and sending children into battle to clean up their mess.  I guess that is what really stuck with me the most.  How we're not unlike the people of this fictional world.<br /><br />I was very sad when I'd finished the last book and was still hungry for more. I wish I could say what I thought of the ending but that would spoil it for anyone reading this review without experiencing the book themselves.<br /><br />I'm definitely recommending it to everyone I know.
B003EYVXV4|5.0|Every year, twenty-four teenage \\"tributes\\" are brought to the Capitol of Panem, and sent out into the arena to kill each other on live TV. Only one will survive.<br /><br />This chilling premise is at the center of \\"The Hunter Games,\\" a brilliant, powerful movie adapted from the first book of Suzanne Collins' bestselling trilogy. It's a slow-burning thriller twined with some barbed satire (reality TV!) and an oppressive government -- but at heart, it's an uplifting story about a young woman fighting to be free.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) lives in the impoverished District 12, hunting food to provide for her mother and her beloved little sister Prim (Willow Shields). But on the day of the reaping, Prim is selected. And Katniss does something no one else has done -- she volunteers to go instead. Along with the male tribute, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), she is swept away to the Capitol.<br /><br />Once there, the tributes are pampered, tutored, styled and turned into celebrities -- until they're released into the arena, and start killing each other to survive. Katniss must evade murderous gangs, traps, and genetically engineered beasts.<br /><br />But because Peeta publicly declared his love for Katniss, the audience has taken a shine to the impoverished young \\"lovers\\" and are rooting for them to triumph. But if both Katniss and Peeta are to survive, they must learn how to play the game that the gamemakers and polticians are playing -- and use the Hunger Games against them.<br /><br />I'm not sure why so many people compare \\"The Hunger Games\\" to the Twilight movies, because it literally has everything that \\"Twilight\\" does not. It has plenty of action, adventure, a subtle romance, and some barbed social commentary -- and it has a raw, passionate quality that easily matches its strong-willed heroine.<br /><br />The movie also shows us what a rotten place Panem is, whether it's the sleek, colorful superficiality of the Capitol or the faded squalor of District 12. But \\"Hunger Games\\" is at its best when it's in the forests of the arena -- there's a primal, wild quality to Katniss' adventures there, tempered with tenderer moments (such as when she cares for the gravely wounded Peeta).<br /><br />The romance with Peeta is also refreshingly uncliched, leaving the audience unsure of how much of their love was for the audience's benefit (although we glimpse some flickers of real love between them). The biggest problems are that a lot of the violence seems rather toned down, and the shakycam becomes rather annoying at times.<br /><br />But Jennifer Lawrence does an excellent job bringing Katniss to life, imbuing her with strength, fear, brains and a fiery temper -- exactly what the \\"girl on fire\\" needs to have. Josh Hutcherson is equally good as Peeta, and there are a string of great performances by Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks and Amandla Stenberg. There's a lot of passion in even the minor actors' performances.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" successfully mingles dystopian sci-fi, romance and a tale of rebellion, giving us a brilliantly raw, passionate movie.

B0074EIQQU|2.0|With this album they incorporate more electronics on the songs than on previous releases like &#34;Octahedron&#34; or &#34;Frances the Mute&#34;. This will of course upset many fans hoping for a &#34;De-Loused&#34; or &#34;Frances&#34; part 2. But lets face it, they won't sound exactly like the way they did on either of those albums again. Not that that is a bad thing, it is just the nature of this band.  The best tracks on this album are &#34;The Whip Hand&#34;, &#34;In Absentia&#34;, &#34;Molochwalker&#34;, and &#34;Dyslexicon&#34;. This is best Mars Volta album since &#34;Frances the Mute&#34; so if you are a Volta fan you should get this.

B00006AUIG|5.0|SESSION 9<br /><br />This is perhaps one of the greatest overlooked gems of horror ever produced, if not all time, then certainly in the last 10 years.  It is a cleverly constructed story which seems simple enough on the surface, but as the film goes on, we end up with more and more questions than we do answers.  It is well written and acted, but the thing that really stands out about this movie is its location and subtle action.<br /><br />Session 9 plays out like a desert island scenario--5 guys who work in asbestos removal are hired to undertake the herculean task of cleaning up the abandoned State Mental Asylum in Danvers, Massachusetts in just one week.  The story therefore centers on this determined crew who are isolated away from society in the caverns and broken hallways of the gigantic hospital.  Each individual has a very distinct personality and set of goals, ranging from empty-headed teenager, compulsive gambler, focused employee, future lawyer, and the owner who pulls it all together.  They work well as a team, especially since there is a huge bonus waiting for them if they meet the deadline, but there are also cracks forming at the seams.  Tensions gradually build as personal conflicts surface on the job site, tensions made all the worse by the strange location this team seems trapped in, caged themselves as it were by some mystic force.<br /><br />This is perhaps the greatest point in Session 9--the location.  The film was in fact shot in the old Danvers State hospital, and it's no creative inspiration when the film states that Danvers is where the pre-frontal lobotomy was perfected.  So it's not just the physical dilapidation that is so jarring to the eye, but also a psychic depravity that seems to keep a hold on the place.  In a way, it shares this quality with the Shining, a spot of ground so contaminated by horrible deeds and suffering that it seems to have permeated the walls.  A better place to film could not have been chosen and just like the Shining, the hospital becomes the star attraction.  If any place is haunted, if demons really exists, then they must dwell here.<br /><br />That's sort of where the film leaves off, too.  The story just unfolds with very little action actually taking place.  Instead, Brad Anderson (director) keeps feeding facts into the movie that gradually increase the tension and suspense.  Central to this is the discovery by one of the crew of an old set of audio reels, recordings of hypnosis sessions from a patient suffering from split personality disorder.  Why of all the reels he is drawn to this particular one is for the viewer to decide, but the voices on the tape quickly parallel the events taking place.  Then things get strange.  One of the crew disappears.  Threats are made.  The hypnosis sessions become more intense.  Things best left buried are coming to the surface.  All the bones of the tormented souls of Danvers seem to be rising up, as are the skeletons of the crew working there.<br /><br />The film does a great job in creating a situation where all is not what it may seem.  It's a strong point of the film that some people may not like because it avoids establishing definite conclusions.  The viewer's perceptions are frequently questioned--are we sure we just saw that?  Is there a reasonable explanation, or is this a supernatural situation?  Even as the truth begins to unfold towards the end, we are still left with lots of room to interpret.<br /><br />I also like that fact that most of the film contains no violence at all.  The unsettling aspects of the movie are all psychological.  It borrows a lot from Val Lewton's concept that you can create more scare by showing less, and it's a facet of the film that works.  There is also a lack of spooks and ghouls popping out, or of startling noises.  The film doesn't pander to the use of cheap effects to get a thrill out of the audience but relies on good pacing and intelligent dialog.<br />Something too, that a lot of people may overlook is a strong reliance instead on sound in this movie.  The background music is haunting, drips from the ceiling echo down empty halls, insects chatter outside.  The voices on the audio reels murmur in such a way as to send chills down your spine.  It's a device often overlooked in films and one that deserves the proper acknowledgement when used well.<br /><br />Session 9 is a great psychological horror movie that gets its scares and leaves the viewer unable to conclude what is real or not.  Like the hospital it was filmed in, it is embedded with sadness and tragedy.  The characters are all likable and you get to know them as intimately as such a short time will allow.  The symbolism is great and not too over the top, but just enough to add an extra element to the plot.  It's a little known movie, but one that deserves great attention.e may overlook is a strong reliance instead on sound in this movie.  The background music is haunting, drips from the ceiling echo down empty halls, insects chatter outside.  The voices on the audio reels murmur in such a way as to send chills down your spine.  It's a device often overlooked in films and one that deserves the proper acknowledgement when used well.<br /><br />Session 9 is a great psychological horror movie that gets its scares and leaves the viewer unable to conclude what is real or not.  Like the hospital it was filmed in, it is embedded with sadness and tragedy.  The characters are all likable and you get to know them as intimately as such a short time will allow.  The symbolism is great and not too over the top, but just enough to add an extra element to the plot.  It's a little known movie, but one that deserves great attention.

B000002LKU|5.0|It's back to the archives again to look over some of my favorite CDs of the past. This time I found \\"The Notting Hillbillies\\" in my collection. The Notting Hillbillies are sort of s \\"super group\\" effort starring Mark Knopfler, Steve Phillips, Guy Fletcher and Brendan Croker, guitar virtuosos all. Excellent, excellent music! I was looking at the ratings. Out of 46 reviews, 38 gave this CD five stars with another 6 giving it four. Is that telling you something? Well, what can I say? It's excellent!<br /><br />The four outstanding guitarists are lightly accompanied by keyboards, steel pedal guitar and their own vocals. Pleasant listening? Oh, yeah! And, I should add, the songs are great. The one thing I can notice is that Mark Knopfler seems to stand out on all the cuts. Since he's also the producer, one might assume there's a bit of egotism here. I think not. Not a bit with Knopfler. He's just one of the world's most distinct guitarists. I can recognize his sounds almost anywhere. I distinctly remember when I once entered a noisy room with music playing. It was an orchestral piece and I could here Knopfler's guitar in the orchestra. He's that distinct! And he's really good, I should add. In any case, this is a remarkably pleasant album and Knopfler just puts the cherry on top of the sundae.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B001TKNWWI|5.0|Here's another one I picked off the bargain rack at my nearby Ross store. It's a winner and is quite a good movie. \\"The Wrestler\\" starring Mickey Rourke takes place at an unknown location and time but I'd guess it to be New Jersey and fairly recent. Have you ever wondered what pro-wrestling is like on the very bottom rung of the profession? Well, here's your chance to find out. Mickey Rourke plays an aging and burned-out wrestler to perfection. He received a \\"best actor\\" nomination for the Academy Awards and was a winner in the Golden Globe Awards. He earned the accolades in this excellent performance.<br /><br />The movie is somewhat more like a documentary on the life of a lower-level pro-wrestler than it is a movie. Well, it's a good story and it's quite well done. Very informative. All the aches and pains and low-life living are  everywhere evident and the movie documents the slow decline to a somewhat startling final scene. You just cannot help but being grabbed by the pathetic life of Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson and you'll suffer right along with him. I hadn't heard of the movie before. Maybe it's one of those relatively unknown movies that only film buffs know about. In any case, it's first-rate viewing.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B000CNFC76|4.0|Back in 1913, golf was mainly a rich man's game, but a boy who wasn't born into high society shows them all that age or the class you are born into isn't what makes a great golfer. A really inspirational movie with comedy and a little bit of history thrown in, great for the whole family! Plus it's based on a true story! Shia LaBeouf really is a great actor!

B003L77G06|5.0|Even this second season was outstanding which means... drum roll please... this TV show is definitely an all time favorite comedy that will be around for at least 8 seasons hopefully!! Season 2 is just as hilarious as the first! The studio kept all of the characters true to who they were in the 1st and all are still just as great as they were, even though they should probably have big heads after being the highest honored comedy series at the 2010 Emmy Awards receiving 6 including Outstanding Comedy Series for Season 1 right? Even if you haven't seen season 1 (which you'll be dying to see if you start here with the 2nd season first) you'll be caught up with knowing what the show is about and already have a connection with the characters from the first episode you watch since its not a sequential TV show like some others. To fill you in a little bit there are 3 families (who are all part of each others families too). Jay is a wealthy guy in his 60s who married someone almost half his age, the Colombian beauty, Gloria who came into the relationship with her son, Manny, from her previous marriage. Jay's daughter is Claire (married to Phil and they have 3 kids together) and Jay's son, Mitchell whose partner is Cameron, they have adopted a daughter, Lily together. The 3 families are hysterical to watch through each and every episode! Its even our President's favorite family TV show!

B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a game app for the Kindle Fire and other platforms. It's a zen-like puzzle game with delightful music and gameplay which is both soothing and challenging.<br /><br />The basic premise is fairly simple. You have a single screen to work with, and a drop of water. That drop of water has to cross all glowing pearls on the screen in as few moves as possible. So there's no stressful timer, no blaring music. Just you and the puzzle before you.<br /><br />If you look at the screenshots in the top image area, the water drop is the larger blue object, and the pearls are the smaller golden objects.<br /><br />The water drop goes in any horizontal or vertical direction, and it slides until it hits a wall.<br /><br />In the top left is your current move count - zero - and the ideal count of moves you're aiming for.<br /><br />Of course once you get into the levels, things get more tricky. There are one-way gates. There are objects that prick and burst your water drop. There are objects that reverse the prickers. There are teleporters. All of these gadgets help keep the game interesting.<br /><br />The game ramps up very nicely. The tutorials help you understand the basics, and then each new level builds on the skills.<br /><br />And the music! It is soothing and wonderful. I love the visuals and music here. It helps the game<br /><br />If you get stuck, there's even a hints database. You earn \\"coins\\" by getting perfect scores on the easier games, and then if you do end up getting stuck on something you can spend one of those coins to unlock the solution for the puzzle. The hint is more than a hint - it walks you step by step through the correct solution, so you can learn the technique.<br /><br />Even the backgrounds are lovely - watercolor landscapes with gentle rain falling down the screen.<br /><br />Are there any downsides here? I suppose if someone is an action junkie and needs that pounding rock music to enjoy a game, they won't get it here.<br /><br />But other than that, the game is great for all ages, it's challenging, it's good for the brain, and it's relaxing. For me that's an ideal mixture.<br /><br />I purchased Quell with my own funds for the purpose of doing this review.han that, the game is great for all ages, it's challenging, it's good for the brain, and it's relaxing.

B0077ATSU4|2.0|Could they SERIOUSLY not have gotten a real actor to play the lead boy in this film?<br /><br />Is there someone in the movie company this kid is related to?<br /><br />HOW did he get this job? I've never been more annoyed by a child in my entire life except for the baby in Morton's the other night whose parents would not take him out while he cried and cried over our one quiet night my wife and I get out together perhaps in every 3-6 months...<br /><br />Back to the movie: IF and only IF the right casting had been done, the rest of the ensemble was good to near perfect, especially Bullock.<br /><br />But, because of the poor choice of lead, it is near unwatchable...I made it through, but I was suffering all the way and I'll never do it again.
0439023513|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I read the book in 2 days, almost obsessively, in succession.  It's a page turner.  I was not bored.  I just think it was contrived, a \\"Finale\\" book to tie up loose threads.  At this point, after reading the books, we are invested in all the key characters in the book - not just what happens to them, but what IS HAPPENING to them.  Some of the scenes and actions are glossed over so quickly, in a paragraph.  I would have liked Collins to spend more time painting a picture of the details that are happening - the battle scenes, the morphine addiction, the mental thoughts she's having that are not all that coherent.  Given Collins' background in writing for Hollywood, I shouldn't be surprised about how this was almost written to be made to a movie, I get it.  Usually I feel sad after reading a series of books, sad that its over.  I'm not sad that its over, but unsatisfied in the lack of details.  It wasn't enough.
B0014EU5XI|2.0|I love ZZ Top. When I saw the list of songs on this collection I decided to give it a shot. There are a bunch of great songs on here and if you're looking for good value, this might be it.<br /><br />I gave this album 2 stars because some of the classics have been remastered and I believe re-sung. Jesus Just Left Chicago and Beer Drinkers sound completely different from the originals on Tres Hombres. It sounds like Billy resang the vocals and the rest of the tracks were overproduced - they don't sound as gritty - a quality I love in the originals.<br /><br />Also, Legs is not the original. It's remixed with an electronic track up front that overtakes the guitar.<br /><br />In a word, if you're looking for the original songs, this is NOT the album to get.
0439023491|4.0|You get to see the darker side of what effects the Games has on the characters - it no longer being a shock. My only complaint - and this goes for all the books, is that Collins did not spend enough time with the details of painting a picture for the readers.  Some actions are glossed over in a paragraph or a couple of sentences - and they could have taken pages.  Even though I read them all obsessively, and am a fan of the trilogy, I wanted more - not necessarily in action (there is plenty), but detail.
0441013597|1.0|I had several close friends recommend Dune to me, all proclaiming how amazing it was as a novel, only to hear later that not one of them finished it for the same reason: \\"it was kinda boring.\\" If you're asking yourself why someone would praise and recommend a book that they find to be boring then you're just as mystified as I am. I have yet to meet anyone who has read Dune who liked it or ever finished it.<br /><br />The books major problem is it has too many minor characters and very poor character development. The lead character, Paul, is a good example, as he has no personality, or any interesting qualities whatsoever. Sadly, all the characters are this way.<br /><br />I did finish this book, after forcing myself to keep reading for six months, and I will say that it eventually does get more interesting, but only in the last two chapters.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|&#34;I take his hand, hoding on tighty, preparing fr the cameras, dreading the moment I wil have to let go.&#34; The last words of The Hunger Games say it all. The Hunger Gams is my all time favorite book, yet I look at it in a different perspective when I'm choosing favorites. What moves me? What's different in this book that I'll probably never read a gain? This was the first book that I've read in the short 12 years I've been living thathas actuay made me cry. Most girls my age cry becasue of the vioence and death but I've read things far moe violent than this. The part that made that one tear flow down my face (sorry if I'm spoiling anything) is where Claudius Templesmith announces that Katniss and Peeta cannot both be victos and the two decide to eat poisoness berries becase they can't live without one another. Not only was it good to know that someone had actuay thougt of this kind of factor in teenage love, but to be honest I think they should've died. This would've added more of a dramatic effect and there wouldn't be any need for a sequal because it's nice to read a book and not have one that follows every once in a while. Now why did I put the last sentence of the book at the beginning of the review? Becase I felt so sure that Katniss still had feeings for Peeta, but the hollowness in Peeta's voice killed me. It makes me not want to read the rest of the series because I was a fan a Peeta since the moment his character was introduced. Now, the movie just came out about a week ago. I was suppossed to celebrate the midnigt premire with a group of 6 friends, but there were obstacles that I couldn't get around so I didn't go. If I had gone, I wouldn't had read the book. That was one of the luckiest things on my part, but I didn't know it yet. After reading thebook, I reaized I would hate every minute of the movie because when I read a book, a movie runs through my mind that the book paints. It was so perfect, any little changes would be drastic measures to me. Before I read the second book, I'm obviously Team Peeta so I would like to know how big of a role he has in Catching Fire because the end of the Hunger Games reay made me mad. If you are going to read the Hunger Games and I didn't ruin it for you, just expect the unexpected.Before I read the second book, I'm obviously Team Peeta so I would like to know how big of a role he has in Catching Fire because the end of the Hunger Games reay made me mad.

B004EPZ0AM|2.0|I am not a reviewer from the alleged blog that submitted 250 negative reviews of HAPPY FEET TWO.  With that being said, I must say I wasn't impressed with this sequel.  Despite its message (which has been employed countless times), its just not that entertaining.  The characters aren't that interesting and the music doesn't match the quality of the original.  The dance sequences are mundane and the voice characterizations aren't that inspired.  I really had a hard time watching to the finish, but I did and just found it ultimately dull.  The film's weak box office will hopefully negate any future sequels.

B001ER4CNY|5.0|This series is in my top 10 maybe top 5 favorite series. Great cast and overall fun series to watch.<br />It may seem a little pricey but you are getting five seasons and many hours of viewing fun.<br />The packaging is not adequate and you will probably want to keep the disks in sleeve case for storage.<br />Good quality transfer as far as video and audio, with some limited extras.<br />If you want to add a good comedy series to your collection, I highly recommend this set.<br />All of the disks are single sided with season number on the label side.<br />I would recommend you get it while you can.

1423140591|5.0|People should definitely read this book. Its use of suspense forces the reader to continue reading and to not stop till you reach the end. Also the constant action that happens in the book keeps you interested and focused.<br /><br />\\"After spending the entire first series developing Percy, and keeping us in suspense about his fate with the first book in the new series, in this one he's a 2 dimensional cutout, left in the background in favor of two new heroes we don't care much about.\\" (ianS Barnes and Nobles .com p 4)<br /><br />I disagree with you that Percy Jackson is no longer a main character.  Although there is three different main characters that are switching who is the first person point of view, Percy spends the most time out of all three of the characters as narrator. He is also constantly in the other two characters narrations. The main reason he's focusing on the other characters is he's trying to introduce them and explain who they are. For example the only time you learned about Hazel's past and her curse, besides at the very end, is during her time as a narrator. With Frank if he didn't narrate you would have no idea what his \\"gift\\" was and wouldn't understand what was happening when he first used it. So you can easily see that he is still a very big part of the story and is a very important character.<br /><br />My favorite character is definitely Percy Jackson. This is because of how unselfish he is. One time this was shown is when he was being chased by the Gorgons when Hera told him that he would be able to escape to the ocean our he could stay and save her he unhesitatingly chose to stay. He also put his life on the line reputedly for camp Jupiter.<br /><br />My favorite quote is \\"we must reach Alaska and kill the giant to save our camp no matter what the costs are.\\" (Riordan, 243) I like it because it's another time Percy shows he is unselfish.<br />[[ASIN:1423140591 The Son of Neptune [The Heroes of Olympus Book 2]]]

B000F0UUT6|5.0|I can't begin to express how good this version is of Pride and Prejudice. It was absolutely true to the book. Each character is superbly cast, to the point where when re-reading the book, I actually see and hear the characters as portrayed by the actors/actresses in this version. The more recent version with Kiera Knightly might have actually been more realistic as to the setting. It was a shabbier, dirtier rendition that may have been more like the times really were, HOWEVER, that is not what I want to see when viewing this series. The setting, the casting, the screenplay and editing were simply the best of all versions....preceding and succeeding. Jane Austin would be proud.

B000059H98|2.0|&lt;strong>Tank Girl&lt;/strong> (Rachel Talalay, 1995)<br /><br />&lt;em>Tank Girl&lt;/em> was ahead of its time by a pretty wide margin--made long before the current \\"we'll-make-anything-that-was-ever-a-graphic-novel!\\" craze came into fashion, when if it wasn't a recognizable superhero you were up the creek. (And even that wasn't a guarantee of success, viz. the mid-nineties Batman flicks.) Needless to say, in benefit of hindsight, that is not always a problem. What IS a problem with this film specifically, however, was a couple of decisions that took what was already a vertical-market property and rammed it into a niche so narrow that to this day, the movie has a small (very small) core of fans surrounded by a mass of detractors that dwarfs it. Those decisions: Lori Petty and Rachel Talalay.<br /><br />The latter first here: Talalay's resume, before she was attached to this huge-in-scope big-budget ($25 million per IMDB) sci-fi piece, included &lt;em>Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare&lt;/em> (doesn't it go without saying that was a turd?) and the godawful &lt;em>Ghost in the Machine&lt;/em>, both basement-budget horror flicks. Whose brilliant idea involved letting a director with an exclusively horror pedigree make this? I don't know the answer to that question, but the result stands for itself; in the seventeen years since &lt;em>Tank Girl&lt;/em>, Talalay has not directed another feature film.<br /><br />And then there is Lori Petty, and whatever Talalay's contributions to this flick, it is my belief that how you react to the film will depend entirely on how you react to Lori Petty. I have, as far as I can tell, never seen her play anything but Lori Petty, from this movie to those ill-conceived \\"go baby go\\" commercials the NTRA came up with in the late nineties. Every time I have seen her on a screen, big or small, I have found her insufferable, obnoxious and ill-spoken (in the sense of needing elocution lessons rather than a remedial English class). I was thinking that that personality makes sense for this role, but it didn't help. I couldn't watch more than ten minutes of the movie at a time. I also blame the movie for killing the promising feature career of Ice-T, who previous to this had turned in sharp, smart roles in underrated movies like &lt;em>Ricochet&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Trespass&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>Surviving the Game&lt;/em>, and who afterwards was reduced to &lt;em>Johnny Mnemonic&lt;/em>, &lt;em>'R Xmas&lt;/em>, and, god help the poor guy, &lt;em>Frankenpenis&lt;/em>, the John Wayne Bobbitt movie. In fact, I think the only actor in the entire film whose career was not at least temporary negatively affected by it was Naomi Watts.<br /><br />Be that as it may, and despite Petty and Talalay, the film isn't all bad. Watts is good, as she usually is, though her part is far smaller than it needed to be, and the rippers, among whom are Ice-T and Reg E. Cathey (&lt;em>The Machinist&lt;/em>), are kind of fun, even if the make-up effects on them look as if they were designed by a six-year-old girl with a teddy bear fetish. But prepare to watch in small doses. **kes sense for this role, but it didn't help. I couldn't watch more than ten minutes of the movie at a time.

0439023513|3.0|Being more brutal than it's predecessors, this third and final installment of The Hunger Games was a bit rougher to swallow.  It was intense and harsh, although not gratuitously or unnecessarily so.  Had I not read the first two, it likely would not have been the type of book I would finish, yet caring for the characters I knew I had to read on to learn their final fates.  There were very touching moments amidst the deaths.  In a good way, the author additionally strongly played the twists I'd come to expect with the series - pulling my emotions in all angles from fear to sadness to disgust to delight to love.  Overall, I'm happy to have read (or listened to) the final book of the trilogy and will likely listen to the full series again in a few years' time.  That being said, my favorite of the three is still the series' namesake, The Hunger Games.
B0034G4OVS|3.0|&lt;strong>Frozen&lt;/strong> (Adam Green, 2010)<br /><br />The thing you are most likely to hear about &lt;em>Frozen&lt;/em> is \\"&lt;em>Open Water&lt;/em> on a ski lift.\\" And that is not an invalid assessment of the movie; the two are at the forefront, I fervently hope, of a new genre of survival horror: endurance horror. (One could, if feeling snarky, also lump in the recent docudrama &lt;em>127 Hours&lt;/em>.) You take a very small cast, you put them in a situation that pretty much defines untenable, and you see what they do.<br /><br />Such is the case here. Green (&lt;em>Hatchet&lt;/em>) gives us three skiers, Dan Walker (&lt;em>Dawn of the Dead&lt;/em>'s Kevin Zegers), his girlfriend Parker (&lt;em>The Walking Dead&lt;/em>'s Emma Bell), and his best friend Joe (&lt;em>X-Men&lt;/em>'s Shawn Ashmore), who run a scam on the lift guy (&lt;em>The Change-Up&lt;/em>'s Ed Acerkman) in order to get themselves on the slopes without paying for lift tickets. All well and good until the resort shuts down early because of an incoming front. They cajole until he allows them one more ride up...and then, through a series of mishaps at the bottom of the hill, the three of them are left stuck on the ski lift after everyone goes home. And the resort won't be open again for five days.<br /><br />So here you are, stuck fifty feet off the ground in the middle of nowhere, you're panicked, you're exposed in the face of a winter snowstorm, and there are probably things you haven't even thought of yet. What are you going to do? Well, it stands to reason that the characters are going to find the stupidest possible ways to do things, and then try to do them. Which leads to all the expected problems, but unlike the &lt;em>Open Water&lt;/em> crew, Green was willing to make his characters, and his audience, suffer some brutal indignities in addition to, you know, being stuck on a ski lift in sub-freezing weather in the middle of nowhere for, potentially, an entire business week. And while the situation itself is horrifying enough, it's the little things that really count, like falling asleep with your hand curled around a metal bar and then waking up the next morning and having to peel your skin off in order to reclaim it.<br /><br />Make no mistake: this is an ugly, ugly movie, far more gruesome than was &lt;em>Open Water&lt;/em> (though without getting into the gore-film realms of &lt;em>Hatchet&lt;/em> and its sequel); unconfirmed reports state that at the movies Buttnumbathon premiere, someone actually did faint in the theatre during one shot. Even I had to close my eyes for that one. (Don't worry, if you're smarter than the characters, you will see it coming and be able to prepare yourself.) But if you're okay with the shocking-but-relatively-short scenes of intense violence, this is a pretty solid endurance-horror flick, worth digging up at your local kiosk if you've never checked it out. ***ngs that really count, like falling asleep with your hand curled around a metal bar and then waking up the next morning and having to peel your skin off in order to reclaim it.<br /><br />Make no mistake: this is an ugly, ugly movie, far more gruesome than was <em>Open Water</em> (though without getting into the gore-film realms of <em>Hatchet</em> and its sequel); unconfirmed reports state that at the movies Buttnumbathon premiere, someone actually did faint in the theatre during one shot.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|I am a 27 year old mom, who absolutely loves Doctor Who anything. David Tennent was my absolute favorite Doctor. So when I saw this item I had to have it. I was absolutely ecstatic when it arrived at my home Monday March 26th 2012 @ 10am. I finally got to open it today the 29th. It works great! Yes its plastic. Meant as a toy or unopened display piece on a shelf somewhere. If you're a collector you may like it. Otherwise if you're like me and acctually like to goof of and play with your toys, you'll enjoy this little toy.<br /><br />I bought new so everything worked. The sound was clear. The pen is smooth. Even the UV ink wasn't dried out like some UV INK ive bought in the past.<br /><br />Delivery was quick. Got here in 4 days.<br /><br />Some where some one said its supposed to have psychic paper...its not. And does not come with any.<br />Has 2 interchangeable nibs.<br />-3 batteries<br />That's all. Nothing less nothing more (A Tardis & Key would have been nice though). Simple and fun.<br />Sonic wisely fellow Time Lords.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have never been into anything like bondage but have to tell you the writer pulls it off without me feeling uncomfortable.  We are all different and enjoy different books, thankfully. I like both of the main characters but I feel they could have been developed more. I love romance/mystery and I have to say these books have HOT sex scenes.  This is not your typical boy meets girl, boy and girl break up, boy and girl get back together....let's face it that is the bottom line in romance...again this book is not for everyone.  I downloaded the first one on my kindle because of all the controversy....couldn't stop reading it...downloaded the second and third.  Not sure when I will get my housework done...yes I enjoyed them. There are by far better romance writers out there HOWEVER she gets the award (in my book) for the sex scenes...without that...not sure it would be as good of a read.
B000EAT246|5.0|blue thunder is my total favourite as a kid so a must buy for me. The action is still kick butt with a great story line. Some great actors.
B000TEUSJK|1.0|IF youre looking for an interesting sadist porn, with comic book costume design, this is your movie. If you want a serious historic account, keep looking. The film seems to romanticize the suffering and cruelty inflicted by this man. Too much fixation on graphic, artistic recreations of sexual violence, while almost ommitting the greater portion of his violence against people in every forum of life. The scene where he rapes the bride and groom was an insult to what those people really went through. Total downplay of the violence inflicted. His victims are surely rolling over in their ancient graves.
0790731452|5.0|This is an entertaining spoof. It combines making fun of both sides of many issues. One example would be of those who would welcome aliens and those who would try to eliminate them immediately. Another would be politicians who want to compromise on everything and those who have principles they stick with. And leave it to the highly criticized \\"country music\\" crowd to be the successful sane ones in a crisis.<br /><br />I would call this a Sci-fi, computer graphics version of the 3 Stooges movies. Its slap stick funny for those who have that kind of funny bone. The 5 star group has it and the 1 star group doesn't. That's just one of the differences in humans.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The title says it all. It is really fun and exciting, I would definately  recomend. As you compose games,  you get point so you buy new games.
B0064BWDRW|4.0|I have voraciously read all of Jo Nesbo's books since being introduced to them late last year.<br />Once again he had me reading until the book was finished.<br />Hard not to give anything away but wonder what he will do next!
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|I was apprehensive when this CD arrived.  I have been a Bruce fan since the early 80s (River) and part of me wants the Darkness & BTR Bruce back.  However, that Bruce was a young man with larger than life stories to tell.  Now he's in his 60s and is a different person (as he should be).  This album seems to me to be a Seeger Sessions meets Tom Joad.  The music is generally upbeat in the Seeger sessions with stark lyrics for the times we live in.  I didn't want to like Seeger sessions but I did.  For me, this album is better.  It's full of Bruce's own compositions which meld the Seeger style to a more rock sound.  The messages are right on target as well given the state of the world.  I do have some complaints.  I think We Take Care of Our Own is too formulaic and uninspiring.  It could have been written and performed by some run of the mill country/rock artist as far as I'm concerned.  Also, I could do without all the gospel vocals on Rocky Ground and LOHAD.  They add nothing.  Neither does the rap.  The songs are strong enough to stand on their own and should have been left that way.  Overall, a powerful album with a few defects.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|ells tells this is amazing get the awesome app now sure it. has ads but I cant even tell they are there come on people! you don't need wifi its perfect
0439023513|5.0|The last book was tremendous. It had somewhat of a slow start, however, it was a building up to climax that ended in character. Mockingjay continued from the first two with fluency and intensity. The story has something that we can learn from which is we are not in control. This was obvious in this fictional book, however, there is oppression all around but we have come desensitized to it. I like how Katniss did learn to trust and she had to to save Peeta. The story is tragic but it also shows spirit for those that believe in another. The will to always go on
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I liv this game! :) The update kinda made me mad because of more games. Without that, the game is awesome it self.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I knew this was going to be a difficult subject, but had good recommendations.  It was very well written and left me wondering what the outcome would be.  Unfortunately, the solution was very chilling, and surprised me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Provides comfort and peace with reading plans from 5 to 365 days. I enjoy reading and the option of listening each day. A perfect app for anyone to enjoy the word.
0439023521|2.0|This book begins with a compelling premise, but fails the reader by leaving it undeveloped.  Even allowing for the fact that it is considered young adult fiction, the main characters are vapid and superficial.  The author expects us to believe that Katniss, plucked from an impoverished, oppressed existence suddenly turns into a giddy teenager when presented with the baubles of her oppressors, just before they send her to her likely death.  Readers are further expected that Katniss and Peeta--each in their mid-teens, leading world-weary lives back home--don't have a clue about sex or romance, nor have experienced the feelings that accompany either.  These teenagers should be behaving more like old souls (or adults, at least) but their banter belies the fact that their emotional ages are somewhere between very sheltered ten to tweleve-year-olds. I love dystopian novels and I'm not squeamish about fictional depictions of brutality, but Collins ultimately squanders her opportunity to say anything meaningful about the orgy of violence she has created.  Only a few times, and in passing does Katniss question the authority overlords who created the Hunger Games.  Her narrative primarily focuses on overwrought, repeatative descriptions every event in the book as it occurs.  She spends the majority of the novel attempting to appease them.  The single most compelling scene in the novel is when Katniss and Peeta have the opportunity to commit suicide, and while their decision makes a statement about loyalty, it ultimately sends the message that you should give up instead of fight, and that you should bow to your oppressors if you feel there is any chance they will spare your life.  \\"Resistance is futile\\" seems to be Collins' message.  Other dystopian novels like Brave New World or Oryx and Crake, explore the machinations of a dysfunctional society, or like Lord of the Flies, demonstrate what can occur in the absence of society to place borders around the extremes of the unchecked drives of human nature.  Others, like 1984 explore the psychology of its protagonists.  Teenage readers should leave this novel to the smaller kiddos it was probably intended for, and skip ahead to more substantive (and enjoyable) books.

B0018OIK0E|5.0|I can't believe that I waited this long before watching Shaun of the Dead. It is one of those pitch-perfect movies that heads straight for the limits of insanity, absurdity, and drama --with such momentum and fervor that you think there's no way to stop before it gets maudlin or nonsensical; but Shaun of the Dead, skids just short of edge. I was especially impressed by how the rising threat evolves from something that can't be distinguished from the ordinary to the all out bloodbath and back again. Very intelligent and very funny, with a little heartfelt drama thrown in as a kind of garnish. I highly recommend this movie, as long as you aren't too squeamish. It's nowhere near as grisly as True Blood or The Walking Dead, but there's plenty of splattered 'red' throughout the film.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is a remarkable book series.  The book contains fun for all ages, from teenagers to octogenarians.  I would recommend without reservation.
B006VA57CY|5.0|I love this series! I can't wait to see how the story continues. The quality of the video/audio is excellent.
0393061310|5.0|What a great book.  My girlfriend introduced me to the book and I'm glad she did.  I'm not sure I agree with all of his theories, but I must admit I find it hard to argue against him.  The detail /research in the book is stunning.  This is one of the books that I can clearly say I came away a lot smarter (or should I say knowledgeable) after reading it than when I started.  The book contains so much knowledge that in all honesty it is hard to retain all of it.  This book covers a lot of ground and while it is not an easy read it well worth the effort.  If you are truly interested in how societies developed and why certain societies seem to be more powerful than others, then do yourself a favor and pick up the book.<br /><br />Rindge Leaphart

1400052181|5.0|Excellent book!  The author did an amazing job of presenting the life and science of this extraordinary woman and her family's struggle to come to terms with the mother's immortality!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great graphics and music, can't see much of the &quot;story&quot; though since my screen is too small, on a.tablet it would look good,
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I did receive this item a little late, but that was due to weather, so the seller is not at fault for that.<br /><br />Overall this thing is pretty sweet, a little light and plastic-y?, but sweet.  the UV ink and light are awesome.<br /><br />If you are a Who fan and don't want to spend an outrageous amount on a really high end one, this is for you or that person you know.
B0024Y7H10|5.0|Wonderful show! Very well written. So many storylines going on in each show, you can't wait to see the next episode. The show, story and cast grew better the longer it was on TV.

B00571F26Y|4.0|This book will educate you regarding wheat and the effects is has on our body systems. I have been wheat free now for four weeks and can certainly feel the difference...the main one being I have lost hunger pains. This book will make you think about what you ingest into your body and the outcome of that choice.
B007OUFESC|1.0|This movie should have been good because there were some really great actors in it like Keira Knightly and Michael Fassbender but it was just slow, overacted in some parts, underacted in others, and weak with the point.  If you are a Fassbender fan watch Shame instead and if you are a Knightly fan watch anything she did before this movie.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|this app is amazing it works anywhere i go and its easier then logging into a super slow computer lets go horray for awesome apps
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Awesome! Downloaded to my Kindle Fire and works like a dream.<br />My husband is a big gamer and I knew he would love it, I handed it off and he played on the Fire while my son played on his iTouch.<br />Both of them had a great experience and really enjoyed the new factors to it, made it challenging again after they'd been playing the other ones so much.<br />I was a little intimidated as it looked so different, and I do not game much, but gave it a try...an hour later I had better scores than my husband on most of the first group. Very intuitive and alot of fun, really helped me use my brain and we all are looking forward to new levels.<br />Great job!
0307959856|1.0|To be short this book was boring, stupid and very far fetched. Lydia in this book is so annoying i would have shot her in the head myself just to get her to shut up. I would not recommend reading it.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I'm giving it 1 star to balance out what I think is the unworthy praise. I'd actually rate it a 2.5 or 3 at best.<br /><br />The book has an interesting setting and premise, but does little with it. I forced myself to read it due to the high reviews and high recommendations, but it really isn't much of a page-turner. The events lack imagination. The descriptions are boring. The story is highly predictable. The main character has little personality. This is just another Twilight for the sheep.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|You guys are seriously acting crazy over some stupid adds? I think the actual GAME is good it keeps me occupied plus I love mahjong and the adds don't bother me at all cuz I can DEAL WITH IT!!!
B004EPYZTE|3.0|Even the first Conan with Arnold S. had romance in it and appears to have even had a better script. I was anxious to see this but it was a real yawner, all background, all action to the point where your ears become numb to the noise of battle. I've tried to watch this twice and still have not made it through all the way without falling asleep. Reminds me of the droaning engines on a plane, those (that sound) put me to sleep too. If you want action all the way through and nothing else, this is perfect!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is absolutely riveting. I waited to read it, hearing all the movie reviews I didnt think it would be something I was interested in. I started it yesterday and finished today. I could not put it down, was on the edge of my seat, happy, sad, angry, all different emotions as things happened. Now on to the next in the Trilogy.
B006ON41FC|5.0|best best best game so so soooo cool I love it! would like more gear his eye's are cute it is the best game ever!
B005RJ6AIK|4.0|It's a good cd with wonderful Hawaiian music, but I'm disappointed my husband's dad, Ernest Tavares version of Hi'ilawe that starts playing just as the credits to the movie starts isn't on the audio cd.  Ernie just received (posthumously) on Saturday, May 28, 2011 the \\"Na Hoku Hanohano LifeTime Achievement\\" Award for his lifetime achievements in Hawaiian music.  He received the award at the Hawai'i Convention Center.  My husband and I attended the awards and my husband, Jan Tavares, accepted it for his dad.
B0072QPV6I|5.0|This live album is nothing less than astonishing. This is the best concert on BlueRay I have ever seen (u2 at the pasasdena rose bowl looks pretty bleak compared to this). Awesome music, flawless mix and the picture quality is just breathtaking. So good to see the \\"brothers\\" up close and personal, look like they're having as much fun as the audience.<br />A must-buy.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've been doing this video for about 3 weeks now, sometimes twice a day - morning and night.  I can see (actually SEE) my \\"love handles\\" shrinking and my stomach getting flatter and tighter.  I'm 5'8\\" and still weigh 130 lbs.  Haven't lost a single pound so far (in spite of changing my diet too), but I can see my body changing since I started this video and I'm happy about that.<br /><br />I was really sore the first week, but by week two, I was no longer waking up with sore muscles every morning. I could only do two measly push ups when I first started, but by week two, I was doing 10 pretty easily and now I can do 20.<br /><br />I think at some point, these workouts will become too easy for my fitness level but when that happens, I'll add some heavier hand weights and some ankle weights to keep it challenging.<br /><br />Most of the exercises can easily be modified to low impact movements for people with sore feet/ankles/knees -- and those modifications are shown frequently in the video; something I appreciate since I'm in my 40's.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is an epic, action-packed story about strength and survival in the face of horrible circumstances. Katniss Everdeen is a survivor. Katniss takes care of her mother and her little sister, Prim after her father dies in a mining accident. She braves the dangers of the forest outside the safety of the fences to poach food for her family with the help of her best friend Gale. Times are tough, but it is The Reaping that strikes fear into the children of Panem and their families' hearts.<br /><br />The Reaping is the day that one boy and one girl from each of the 12 districts will be chosen to fight in the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a battle to the death between all 24 tributes, where only one is allowed to survive. When Prim's name is selected from the bowl of names, Katniss does the unthinkable, she volunteers.  Now she is about to fight for her life against extraordinary odds.<br /><br />I know almost everyone has read The Hunger Games, and I am late to the game. After watching the movie trailers all over my TV, I knew I had to read the book before going to see the movie. I am beyond glad that I decided to pick up The Hunger Games after much urging from my husband. I love the inner strength and bravery Katniss shows just by supporting her family, and standing in to save her sister. The games are cruel and horrible; it is children killing other children for the enjoyment of the Capitol. Katniss manages not to let the cruelty of the games, and the horrific conditions change her into a monster.<br /><br />Peeta, the other champion from District 12, or The Boy with Bread, is beyond sweet. I really love the relationship that Katniss and Peeta develop before The Hunger Games. For the ones who are like me and still have not read it, I will not spoil it. I just cannot wait to see what is going to happen in Catching Fire, and Mockingjay. If you have not had the chance to read The Hunger Games or you are not sure about it, pick it up because you will devour it. I should be going to see the movie this week, and I cannot wait!<br />**Unabridged Bookshelf purchased this book**ause you will devour it.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. It really is tons and tons of unique mini games. EXCELLENT BUY- especially when it's free!
B00009ZYC0|4.0|It was shipped much faster than I had expected and it (the DVD) was still wrapped in its plastic. I would highly recommend purchasing from and would also purchase from this buyer in the future. Thanks!!!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|What used to be a four star app just went to a zero with no maps = no radar, hopefully they can get this back on, till then it leaves my KF
B003VR5PPY|5.0|...Very trial-and-error game can result in frustration and burnout after a few replays. Furthermore, it is very easy to mess up and get the bad ending. All of this is made tolerable by a story deep in its' involvong mystery and mythos, conspiracy, tense prose, and  a lovely set of boobies. Last two puzzles are NOT fun. Best of luck.
B006MQRLSA|5.0|I highly recommend. This movie will open your eyes to how corrupt sports are in America and one team trying to go against that. Very good movie.
B0038OY6DW|5.0|Hi.<br />This movie was very well done with all the elements that make Sherlock Holmes the great hero from the past.  Done with all the newest movie effects of course.
B001F0WXY0|3.0|I love this book but i refuse to pay $15 for the Kindle edition when the paperback can be had at a used bookstore for less than a buck. The publisher has made millions off this book over decades. There is no justification for this asking price by the publisher.
B007F1SGM6|5.0|An unusual and incredible film. Very well acted and exremely emotional. Sandra Bullock shines in a smaller than normal role.

B00756GKBA|5.0|To start with, I've been a long time fan (25 years) so I grew up with Madonna watching her on MTV in the good 'ol days (the 80's). Always happy when she came out with a new album (this time is no exception). As with every album, no matter which artist, it takes a little while to get used to new sounds and new songs. When she released Give Me All Your Luvin' I was very relieved that it didn't sound like anything on Hard Candy. I know that some people like the Hard Candy album but I'm not one of them. I had a very hard time with this album except for a couple of songs, so I was very much hoping for a pure dance album next. So when first heard GMAYL I was very happy. If I remember correctly I heard Masterpiece  first. I was really blown away with this song. Her best ballad in years. Another huge relief! After this I pretty much knew that this album would be fantastic. So after 4 long years after Hard Candy, we get her best album since Ray of Light. Not that she ever went away, but to me this is one huge comeback from HC! This is what she was made to do. Everyone was really curious about Gang Bang, like me, and this song quickly ended up being in my top 3 favourite Madonna songs ever. I've been waiting forever for her to do a song like this, it's very \\"free\\", a song she's just letting loose on which I love. I'm A Sinner is an absolutely perfect song, had no idea I'd end up loving it as much as I do. I can imagine a video for this song with Madonna dancing dressed as a nun.  It's got such an amazing beat and is really cool. Beautiful Killer should have been on the 1 disc edition and on disc 1 on the Special Edition, this is a song waaay to good to \\"leave out\\" like that. If there's one song she should have left out it's Best Friend which to me sounds way too much like something on Hard Candy.  Was very surprised when I listened to Love Spent, which is also a fantastic song and sounds like two songs in one, the second half is truly euphoric. This album is also very much an F*** You to her ex-husband but also how she wasn't the perfect wife either. Falling Free is something straight out of Ray Of Light, stunning. Collaborating with William Orbit is the best thing she's done. All in all it's a fantastic album and I haven't heard anything this good from her since Ray of Light. A 10/10.F*** You to her ex-husband but also how she wasn't the perfect wife either. Falling Free is something straight out of Ray Of Light, stunning. Collaborating with William Orbit is the best thing she's done. All in all it's a fantastic album and I haven't heard anything this good from her since Ray of Light. A 10/10.

B004N66XYE|4.0|I admit I was not familiar with the original Upstairs, Downstairs show from the 1970s until very recently, and have since watched all five seasons of the original. I love the interesting plot lines, the great cast, and the quality of writing. However, the production values are predictably dated and the film quality leaves much to be desired with the effect of looking washed out with dull colors. I hope they will restore the show one of these days and come up with a better quality DVD, with crisp and clear images and sound.<br /><br />When I saw that there was a remake of Upstairs, Downstairs, I was excited especially since I was feeling withdrawal symptoms with the end of Season 2 of Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 2, one of my favorite British period dramas. One of the drawbacks of this remake is the fact that Season One only has three episodes! Initially, I thought this must be due to unfavorable audience response, and that the show was not renewed, but to my delight, it has been renewed for another season with six episodes. I still feel it is not enough, but I'll take what I can get!<br /><br />The setting for this remake of Upstairs, Downstairs is 1936, about six years after the year in which the original series had ended (on film). 165 Eaton Place is literally resurrected, not by a member of the Bellamy clan (the original family that resided there) but by the Holland's, made up of Sir Hallam (Ed Stoppard) who works for the Foreign Office, and his wife, Lady Agnes (Keeley Hawes). They are soon joined by Hallam's eccentric mother, Maud (Eileen Atkins) and Agnes' spoilt younger sister Lady Persie (Claire Foy). Maud pushes her way into the household, bringing along her secretary/manservant Amanjit (Art Malik with a ghastly beard) and her little pet monkey Samson.<br /><br />The staff downstairs are made up of housekeeper, Mrs. Rose Buck (Jean Marsh - yes, from the original Upstairs, Downstairs, where she played the upper house parlour maid, and later ladies' maid); butler Mr. Warrick Pritchard (Adrian Scarborough); chauffeur Spargo (Neil Jackson); cook Mrs. Thackeray (Anne Reid, formerly of Coronation Street); and a housemaid, Ivy (Ellie Kendrick, who played Anne Frank in Masterpiece Theatre: The Diary of Anne Frank). There's also a young footman who appears, goes away, and returns during the first season.<br /><br />The main events in this first season revolve around Lady Agnes trying to take charge of her household, and coming up against her formidable mother-in-law who uses her vast experience as a weapon to override her daughter-in-law's wishes. Not that Lady Agnes tries too hard, given a new development that preoccupies her. Meanwhile, a new maid is brought into the fold, and it turns out she is a Jewess who has escaped from Germany. She appears sickly and harbors a secret that is revealed soon enough.<br /><br />Lady Persie is portrayed as the self-centered, lost soul-type whose reckless nature causes her to not only throw convention to the wind, but also strike up a most inappropriate alliance. She also develops an interest in right-wing activities involving the fascist movement in Britain, a thread that was unfortunately rushed through during the course of the three episodes. Another thread explored this season was the relationship between Wallis Simpson with Edward VIII and the abdication crisis.<br /><br />I liked this first season, but would have liked to see more time spent on developing the main characters. It all seemed a bit rushed, as if the writers and producers were trying to cram as much as they could into the three episodes. I hope to see more time being spent on plot and character development next season.es' maid); butler Mr. Warrick Pritchard (Adrian Scarborough); chauffeur Spargo (Neil Jackson); cook Mrs. Thackeray (Anne Reid, formerly of Coronation Street); and a housemaid, Ivy (Ellie Kendrick, who played Anne Frank in Masterpiece Theatre: The Diary of Anne Frank).

B002NT3B52|4.0|I really enjoyed this book since I've tried to incorporate reading a bit more in to my lifestyle.  I read this when I had first adopted my two dogs, and since then, it's been fun to see the similarities between Horowitz's writings and my findings.  It's worth mentioning that this book is inappropriately categorized: it is more of a novel than a scientific, researched-based reference.  While I'm sure Horowitz is a wonderful scientist, she does not exemplify it in this novel.  Inside of a Dog is more the story about a woman and her dog than it is about observing dog behavior, and Horowitz provides a disclaimer about this in the first several pages.  In addition to many of the readers who previously posted, I was also a bit let-down at the end of the book when Horowitz described several scenarios about the \\"Hero Dog\\".  If you can bear it, stop reading the book right before you get to this chapter.  I'm really not sure why she included it.  Nevertheless, I thought the writing was clean and most of the content useful.  I wouldn't read it again (I'm pretty picky that way), but it was worth the read.

B005MYEQ4U|4.0|I've never been more envious of a fictional character than I was of Owen Wilson's character in Midnight in Paris. Paris in the 1920s amongst all those great geniuses must have been something to behold, but I like that this movie takes a quirky bent with the nostalgia theme by downplaying the whole concept of nostalgia in arguing that everyone thinks the era they currently live in is boring. No matter when you were alive, you always pine to want to live during another time instead.<br /><br />It would have been nice if Woody Allen had inserted James Joyce somewhere into the plotline,as he was a significant fixture during the era which this movie celebrates(Joyce's name is mentioned briefly in some dialogue, but that's it). Also, if you miss Adrien Brody it's probably because you blinked briefly. Hopefully the mild success of this movie will rejuvenate interest in some of these long-ago artists, but it probably won't since none of them wrote about vampires.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|I have to say that I enjoyed this book, more than I enjoyed the Game of Thrones, the little hundred pages that I read (and didn't continue). One of the first things that I liked about this book is how it was written. It's easy to understand, comical in a way, and yet, it distinctly articulates the darkness and feelings of the story and the characters. Unlike many authors who tend to make long complicated sentences in an attempt to sound deep or profound, Joe Abercombie does not, but even with that, the prose still seems musical. So, in a nutshell, it's the writing that attracted me initially and kept me reading.<br /><br />Essentially, The Blade Itself is the first book of a Trilogy called The First Law. Why The First Law? It has something to do with the world's history, which is discussed in good detail and is very interesting. More than anything else, the first book is like an introduction of sorts, where we are introduced to the world the author has created and the very colorful characters. And by colorful, I really mean colorful as in they all have very interesting personalities. I think this is the book's strongest point.<br /><br />First we have Logen, or more popularly known as Logen Ninefingers (as he is missing one finger) who is a kind man with a heart of gold. Je, however, has seen a lot in battle, and when provoked can transform into a murdering psychopath. He is from the North, an area disputed and acclaimed to foster savages, men who only know how to fight, and are feared because of this. Running away from creatures called Shankas, he falls down a cliff and gets separated from his friends, and founds himself in the guidance of Bayaz, an old sorcerer who has seen the world of men fall down and up and down again.<br /><br />I like Logen a lot. I found it very amusing when he was so in awe of the city of Adua. I pictured him like a lost country boy looking at a big city for the first time. But I think what attracted me to him the most was how he acknowledged the many crimes and murders in the past, and how he is ashamed of it, but yet also acknowledges the fact that there were instances that he just had no choice. It's a difficult world, after all - a world full of wars and hate. He just tries to survive. He fears the enemy, the unknown, and its because of this fear that he is still alive. He is probably one of the most human characters in the book. \\"I'm still alive!\\" is what I would say, too, when I overcome a life and death situation.<br /><br />Then we have Glokta, which is another of my favorite characters. He is a torturer who used to be one of the most admired soldier and swordsman. He is the epitome of a character who was at the top, at the prime of his youth, and then in an instant, all of this crshed into pieces and is now seen like a dreg in society. Because of this he is sarcastic, has a dry and gory humor, and has thus been degraded into catching and torturing people to get information out of them. He has a knack of figuring out the true motives of people, of knowing their dirty secrets, but keeps it to himself and follows these people anyway. Glokta is probanly the most colorful of the characters. He may have had quite a past and a downfall, but most of his thoughts are very funny and made me laugh in more than a few occassions.<br /><br />We also have Jezal, a blooming swordsman from a rich family who is as selfish and as arrogant. His only ambition is to rise to the top, and due to his upbringing, he sees people of no blood inferior and thus cannot stand them. He is especially not jovial when it comes to Logen, and especially Glokta. We also have Major West, a commoner and a strong soldier, who rose to the top from the very bottom, and worked his ass off to get where he is today, but even with that, he still finds difficulty in establishing connections with people around him because of his lineage. We also have Ferro, an ex-slave who wants to render vengeance on all the people who oppressed her and made her suffer. I don't like her very much as she is too extreme on the vengeance thing.<br /><br />All in all, I think the characters were built and introduced nicely, which is good, and hopefully there will be nice and yummy character development in the second book!!

B000QCS8TW|2.0|I read this book based on a recommendation of a friend who loves the HBO series.  The first half of the book was great...I really couldn't put it down!  However, as the story progressed I found myself losing interest.  It's pretty sad when out of about 20 main characters, I only care if one or two live or die.  Also, there is so much violence.  I know the author is trying to portray the horrors of war, but it gets quite tiresome to continually read about it in detail.  Not a chapter goes by without a woman being raped or a character remembering a woman being raped.  The battle scenes were so long and drawn out i found myself skimming through a lot of them as the story went on.<br /><br />At the conclusion of the story, I was so disappointed to find that nothing was resolved.  Instead the reader is left with a lot of dangling story lines.  I know this book is part of a series, but even so, I feel each individual book should stand on its own while adding to the series as a whole.  After reading reviews of the later books, it seems that no book can be read apart from the series and even book 5 leaves a lot unexplained.<br /><br />When I finished the book, I was left wondering if I had it in me to read more of the series.  While there are a few threads I would like to follow further, the amount of time spent on boring/irrelevant character perspectives (i.e. Bran and Caetlyn) and violent battle/assault scenes makes me think I'll just skip this series.
0439023513|5.0|I loved \\"Mockingjay.\\"  It was an awesome conclusion, to an awesome trilogy.  The way Suzanne Collins writes is unbelievable.  She keeps your interest the entire time and you never know what is coming next.  I also love the emotions she evokes from her writing.  I was brought to tears many times, but also laughter.<br /><br />I also loved the dimension of Katniss.  She never wanted to be the Mockingjay.  She just wanted to have a simple life in district 12.  She was thrust into this situation and has to do her best to free her country and save the ones she loves.<br /><br />I also thought the ending was great.  After all that they had been through, I was happy that she and Peeta could find some sort of peace together.  I would definitely recommend this entire series to anyone that wants to provoke thought and emotions.
0439023483|2.0|I would like to write a \\"comment\\" or opinion, I would love to have a pro efficient knowledge of English language , but i,m a Spanish speaking ... old lady. I like to read specially when i know the writer  try to give us something to learn  making  the characters of the history to speak out of something or  how we can be  resilient , clever and most of  all, how we could change the wrong doing of insane  institutions,customs or politics.<br /> BUT unfortunately Hunger Games is not the case.  Putting the  Young acting like a puppets hiding from them the capacity  of questioning  the \\"games\\". She  took  away from them  the power of even think on how  to stop the abuse and negligence just refusing to do what is against of their nature. She supposed  that perhaps  that kind of sadistic \\"game\\" mixing the \\"Roman Circus\\"  with the reminiscent of  ancient histories about human sacrifices honoring Gods might give the history a serious argument... is just ridicule.<br /><br />The managing of time in the story it s just plane and boring... the dialogues more than poor, the only serious sentence  you can find saying from the character  is the statement pronunced by the old  actor Sutherland  about the power of Hope.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this when it first came out, but didn't have the chance the read the second two books in the trilogy.  With the movie coming out I decided to pick it up again and read the entire trilogy.  I think it might have been better the second time.  It is a quick read, but that isn't a bad thing.  I both loved and hated the characters in this book, which made the gripping story even better.  The character development is what this book stand out.  There have been other books with similar plots, but having the characters be so real, lovely, faulty, and broken makes this one a must read.

B003EYVXTG|5.0|Fantastic movie.  If you are a Hunger Games fan you will know why Jennifer Lawrence was chosen to play Katniss.  The characters are very similar; the family situation that Ree/Katniss finds herself in is almost exactly the same.  Understanding the time limitation forced upon the Hunger Games movie, Winter's Bone offers more of the character development that did not transfer from the Hunger Games book to the movie.

B0041B785Y|5.0|Without speaking in the typical metal hyperbole that saturates many reviews all I can say is that Meshuggah bridged that gap for me that laid between Chaosphere and the NOTHING albums. The band combines all the things they do well from previous recordings and produced an album that is awesome from beginning to end. The speed and polyrythms that have become their trademark are melded so well with the churning and bobbing chug that they pummled listeners with on Nothing. Meshuggah is still better than all the rest, they have no peers in my opinion. Fantastic album.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|J.J. Abrams, as a creator, has been something of an amalgam. He more or less started out making a splash with the TV show FELICITY which was, to me, a rather antiseptic drama. Then came his next big show ALIAS, which was his first foray into genre-bending TV; a high-octane spy thriller mixed with enough drama to make the characters interesting and enough twists to make the more jaded fans tune in weekly. However, he hit his stride with LOST, a show that was universally beloved as it was confusing, but the plot became somewhat secondary to the characters. That show was populated by so many unforgettable characters that, despite fans' misguided anger over the series finale, the show will be forever ingrained in the viewer's brain. And it was during LOST that Abrams started making his foray into feature films; his first being MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 3. M:I-3 is a better film than I remember it being, while at the same time, fusing perhaps a little too much reality into a rather absurd concept which I think ultimately hurt the film but I certainly can't fault Abrams for trying a different approach to a somewhat stale concept. The next film he did was one of the best pure \\"Summer\\" films I've seen in recent years, and that was his reboot of the STAR TREK franchise. It created a genuine love and a strong sense of nostalgia of the original series with a lot of winks and nods, but helped to fashion an entirely new direction for such well-known characters with its one major LOST-like plot twist. It was evident that with series like LOST and FRINGE and films he helped make like the nod-to-Godzilla CLOVERFIELD and then STAR TREK that Abrams, while confident he could create new worlds, he grew up in the era of the Summer Blockbuster, and most of the major filmmakers who grew up during that era usually end up making a film that pays homage to that era. SUPER 8 is Abrams love-letter not only to the era, but also to the master of the Summer Blockbuster (and also my personal favorite filmmaker), Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />Abrams crafts a wondrous, heart-felt, and very well-made tale about a group of youngsters who have banded together in a small Ohio suburb in the late 70's to make a zombie film to submit to a festival, and wind up smack in the middle of a government conspiracy surrounding the escape of an imprisoned alien life-form that puts their entire town at risk. At the center of this tale is the young VFX makeup artist, Joe (a very talented Joel Courtney), a pre-teen who lost his mother recently in an industrial accident. His town-sheriff father, played by the terrific Kyle Chandler, has withdrawn into himself and there is an almost complete disconnect with his son. The other kids making the film are similar to the group of kids we've seen in E.T. or THE GOONIES or any number of Spielberg-ian kid groups, but the young actors and the characters themselves are fleshed out enough to be more than just stock characters. Once the slightly-older Alice (wonderfully played by Elle Fanning) becomes involved in the project, it goes beyond just being a boy's club and the elements of romance and betrayal introduce themselves, particularly from Joe's father since Alice's father (the wonderfully wounded Ron Eldard) may have drunkenly caused the accident that killed Joe's mother. While just the drama of the group and the characters would be enough for one film, that's when Abrams gives us the train crash the kids catch on their Super 8 camera that is the key to the danger and mystery that enshrouds the whole town, and naturally, the danger comes not only from the alien creature, but also from the government, which is embodied by a terrific and menacing performance from Noah Emmerich.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, the film has enough drama and momentum to make an entire film out or either subject (family drama or alien danger), but Abrams, like Spielberg before him, entices us, delights us and ultimately astonishes us with combining these elements intoone big smile of a film. I use the phrase 'smile of a film' not because the film is a hilarious blast to watch, because there are a few moments of heart-wrenching emotion and seat-gluing terror. I use it because when we look back on some of the great Summer Films we've seen in our lives, such as STAR WARS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, BACK TO THE FUTURE and JAWS, inevitably we smile because these films represent the very best of this kind of filmmaking and something that has been very noticably absent from many films post-1985 (since the biggest film of 1986 was TOP GUN), and suddenly the Big Summer Blockbuster became a monster. The likes of Spielberg and Lucas and Zemeckis and Donner changed the rules of the game for better or worse, and all of them started with the best of intent, but along the way, character and story took a massive back seat to spectacle and effects and action and money. This is not to necessarily criticize all of the Summer Blockbusters we have gotten since, but on most of them, the luster is lost after the season is done. Whether that's due to the quality of the film or the over-saturation of the Summer Blockbusters (It's all about Opening Weekend grosses now, and it's becoming increasingly rare that a film is #1 for more than one weekend), that subject is up for debate. But there was a time when we could easily look back at the films of a particular summer and say, \\"That was a great film and it will always be a great film\\". SUPER 8 is a very passionate love-letter to those times, but it also finds itself with the distinction of being one of those films that wasn't just a great Summer film for 2011, but will be a great Summer film for all time.one big smile of a film.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great set of books! I read all three in the series in less than a week. I just couldn't put them down!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|In this day and age of disposable $100 million films, and films working ridiculously hard on creating not much more than a strong opening weekend, many filmmakers and film audiences forget that like all forms of art, cinema has its own language. What takes five paragraphs to write in a book can be shown in five seconds of a film, and the same works in reverse. Also in this day and age, films tend to get pigeon-holed into three categories; the first two being the most immediately recognizable: The Popcorn-Munchers and The Oscar-Bait. They're easy to recognize.<br /><br />The third are what I refer to as The Dump films. Basically, these are films that will get a wider audience than a limited-release film, but they're generally released in the weakest parts of the year with no expectation of big box-office or great critical acclaim; months like September, most of October, January and February are loaded with Dump Films, so it was no surprise to me that a film like Nicolas Winding Refn's DRIVE was released in September. It was a film with actors rather than stars, and a film that was more of a throwback to the great psuedo-independent crime thrillers of the 1980's (such as MANHUNTER and THIEF, both of those films from Michael Mann who also helped to define TV in the 80's with MIAMI VICE and CRIME STORY, and TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A. from Mann's fellow Chicagoan William Friedkin) rather than the high-octane FAST AND FURIOUS flash-over-substance film that one very disgruntled audience member thought it would be and took her outrage to unintentionally satirical heights by suing DRIVE's distributor for the cost of her ticket as well as asserting the film also had Anti-Semitic views and still intends to file a class-action suit against \\"false advertising\\". I include this anecdote mostly because I think the gall it takes to do something like this is beyond astounding, but also because I believe this woman represents most of the viewing public who saw this film.<br /><br />Looking at the public's reviews of this film, it's very much a love-it-or-hate-it film. Many viewers assail the film for being too slow, too boring, and even in some cases, too graphic. Critical acclaim has been nearly universal for the film. It was one of the best reviewed films of 2011 alongside films like THE ARTIST and THE MUPPETS, but not as successful as either of those films, commercially or Oscar-y. The reason being that DRIVE is not a safe film. There isn't a moment that is antiseptic or commercial. It's not meant for mass consumption, and perhaps that explains its own devisive nature as a film. But DRIVE is not afraid to put some of the onus on the audience and tell us, quietly, to expand our ideas of what a great film is and how not only can a picture be worth a thousand words, but a glance or look can be worth a thousand emotions, and the harshness of a sound can be predicated on the silence that precedes it.<br /><br />Without going too much into plot or character, it's important to give credit where credit is due. Ryan Gosling, the too-dreamy-for-words heartthrob of films like THE NOTEBOOK and CRAZY STUPID LOVE who is also the risk-taker of HALF-NELSON, THE BELIEVER, LARS AND THE REAL GIRL and THE IDES OF MARCH, is perfect as the nameless super-anti-hero of the piece. Every look, every glance, every gesture has purpose. The greatest acting talents are the performers who can speak volumes just by saying nothing at all, and this film is loaded with those performers. I call Gosling's character a super-anti-hero because there is something superhuman about this character. He can do just about anything he wants physically, and he can survive just about any assault, except for the emotional. And that's where Carey Mulligan comes in. Mulligan is by far one of the greatest young actors out there. She first really showed us that in AN EDUCATION, and continued to show it in NEVER LET ME GO, SHAME, and this film. She is picture-perfect innocence. You want to protect her, and you understand The Driver's urge to do so. Bryan Cranston, with the introduction of BREAKING BAD a few years ago, has been a revelatory performer. Who knew the dad on MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE would be one of TV's best serious actors? Not me. And his performance as the other half of the partnership with Gosling is small yet shining. Oscar Isaac as the doomed husband of Mulligan's character plays his ex-con with an immediacy and desperation and sense of inevitability. Ron Perlman as the small-time thug with delusions of grandeur is just pitch-perfect, proving once again that Perlman is a seriously underrated actor. Christina Hendricks is sultry, sexy and that's really all her role requires, which is sad, because I love her. However, the film, from a performance standout, belongs to Albert Brooks. We're used to Brooks playing the nebbish, awkward yet smarter-than-you character. We've seen it since MODERN ROMANCE, and through LOST IN AMERICA, BROADCAST NEWS and others. For Brooks to turn that image on its head and play the lethally efficient and pragmatically violent small-time crime boss Bernie Rose is beyond inspired casting, and the performance he turns in is as strong and chilling as seeing someone like Pacino or De Niro play a similar role. He was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor but not for an Oscar. In fact, infuriatingly, DRIVE was only nominated for one Academy Award: Best Sound Editing, which if you watch the film closely, it REALLY deserves, but it lost to... whatever; probably TRANSFORMERS or something.<br /><br />The other shining star of this film is director Nicolas Winding Refn. Being somewhat unfamiliar with his work prior to this film, I tried to watch the ultra-surreal BRONSON with Tom Hardy, and couldn't get through it from a narrative standpoint but appreciated its bravura. I haven't seen his other film, VALHALLA RISING yet, but plan to watch it very soon. It's probably more his film than any of the performers: His use of every element of the language of cinema is so deftly handled, from the sound to the picture to the editing to the performers, he achieves cinematic perfection. The film works on every level it's supposed to: Crime Thriller, Fairy-Tale Romance, Emotional Drama, Anti-Heroic Action, it does it all flawlessly. Another unsung hero of this film is Cliff Martinez, who does the Tangerine Dream-esque score for the film as another nod to those classic 80's thrillers.<br /><br />The simple fact of DRIVE is that this film was the purest expression of the language of cinema that came out of 2011. It never missed a moment to capitalize on that language, and it speaks it fluently and perfectly. This is, hands down, the best film of 2011.r, and you understand The Driver's urge to do so.

B002MQYOFW|2.0|Finishing the book in 2 days made me think it was good, but the more I go over the story, the weaker it appears.<br /><br />We have this omnipotent government plucking children from their homes to fight to the death while the rest of the nation watches on tv, and there is no protest whatsoever. Mothers would rather lose their children than intervene? No rebellion by the masses? Or what, the government kills them? Civil disobedience, anyone?<br /><br />Anyway, there are these 24 kids, which, sorry, 24?? How many are even named in the book? 7? And almost all of them are killed \\"off-screen\\" meaning Katniss, the main character, is not involved. She is busy eating (seriously, every other page) or faking a romance for personal gain. Nice guy Peeta has rescued her multiple times, often to his own detriment, but she can only pretend to like him. So that part was actually pretty realistic.<br /><br />Surprisingly to me, the audience goes gaga over Katta (Peeniss?) so the rulers take a break from oppressing everyone and decide, for the first time ever, 2 kids can survive The Hunger Games! Later they reverse their decision, only to change it a 3rd time at the very end--great writing, I know--and I'm told the way they were \\"forced\\" to spare the young lovers angered the government so much that they come after Katniss in the next 2 books but I'll never know for sure because bleh.

B0050DIWFC|2.0|I don't understand how anyone could have enjoyed this story.  Are there really so few good books out there that this one could have been a bestseller?  I will give the writer credit: he can make a story that should have been 50 pages long drag on for 400 pages and still keep the reader interested.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I did get involved in these novels, but they could have been compressed into one longer book and made the story tighter and more interesting.  I read very fast, so every time the books went into great detail in the sex scenes, I just skipped forward.  After two or three of these very implicit scenes, you've read them all.  Please!!  The author made a lot more money, of course, in writing 3 books instead of 1 but give your readers a break!!!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is one of those reads that any avid reader wants: it captivates and draws you deeper with the turn of every page. The world and characters crafted by Mr. Howey ooze authenticity and the mystery of the silos begs the reader to succumb to its tantalizing allure.<br /><br />In this day it seems most of the best art comes from independent artists, be it film, music, or in this case books. Wool is no exception. Thank you Amazon for giving storytellers like Mr. Howey a platform to reach folks like myself.
B0015DROBO|5.0|For those of you who have not yet read Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, well, I can only say it's high time! I am almost done with the third book, and have not been able to put them down since starting with \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\". (By the way, the original title in Swedish is \\"The Man who Hated Women\\".)<br /><br />Apart from the truly unpredictable mystery waiting to be solved, Larsson presents a staightforward, unromanticized and often chilling picture of gender roles and sex in modern Swedish society.<br /><br />The story builds on an intricate web of characters, all of whom have something to hide, and the protagonist Mikael Blomkvist, who is determined not to let sleeping dogs lie.<br /><br />I wholly recommend this book if you are looking for a thought-provoking and at the same time entertaining read.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|With each release in the series up until this point, Mr. Martin seemed to up the ante on quality, excitement, pacing, and plotting. In contrast to the magic growing throughout Westeros, Martin seems to have lost the magic touch with this entry. Points of view are added that seem to bear very little importance to the overall story. Even worse, they plod along drearily.<br /><br />Most of the viewpoints we've come to love don't even appear in this novel. Which would be fine, if of course, what was in their place felt as if it had a point. Being interesting to read would also be a bonus. Ultimately this novel failed me more than it succeeded.

0525423281|5.0|Lola Nolan has an outrageous and daring style, wearing different colorful costumes every single day. She's cheerful, effervescent, and devoted to her family. Her two dads aren't thrilled that her boyfriend Max is older and kind of a bad boy. Plus he's in a band. Her parents put a lot of restrictions on her like making her call in every hour when they are out, as if that would keep her out of trouble. Lola is pretty happy with her life the way  it is despite her overbearing dads. Her immediate goal is to make a super ornate Marie Antoinette gown to go to the winter formal with Max. Then a big complication enters her life: the Bell twins move in next door. They used to live there years before and both twins made her life hell. Calliope hates Lola and is mean to her at every turn. Her twin Cricket was her first love and he broke her heart when he led her on and moved away suddenly. Now those complicated feelings are back and Lola doesn't know what to do.<br /><br />I normally don't read a lot of contemporary teen fiction and especially not ones solely centered around romance. Romance is usually good in the periphery for me and I usually hate it when it overtakes a story. I was introduced to Stephanie Perkins through Misty's review of Anna and the French Kiss at The Book Rat. She had the same misgivings as I had and she loved it. Of course I had to give it a try. I absolutely loved it and I had to read Lola and the Boy Next Door. Stephanie Perkins has this magical ability to capture the feeling of first teen love. With any other author and characters I would be rolling my eyes and being annoyed at , but she taps into those teenage feelings in me. I can't pinpoint exactly what it is, but I was on the emotional rollercoaster right with Cricket and Lola. I also thought this novel was a little more complex and deeper than Anna and the French Kiss, but Anna and St. Clair are added bonus characters in this novel as well.<br /><br />Lola and Cricket are both amazing characters. The first thing I thought when I heard Lola's name was Lolita from the Nabokov novel and it was totally mentioned in the first few pages. That just made me book nerd out a bit because I never would have expected that in a teen book. Anyway, back to Lola, I liked that the novel was about more than just romance. It was about Lola finding out who she really is. Do her clothing and makeup change who she is? Is she hiding behind them? Cricket is also a wonderful character with his own set of problems, mostly involving his family. I found him endearing and far superior to Max. He is his own person outside of his relationship with Lola, which I think is important. Creepy co-dependent relationships run rampant in YA fiction and it's nice to see a healthy relationship for once.<br /><br />I loved Lola and the Boy Next Door. I surprisingly and thoroughly enjoyed a contemporary romantic comedy teen novel. It plucked at my heartstrings and made me giggle like a fool. I can't wait to read her next book, Isla and the Happily Ever After. I recommend this to all YA readers, even if you think it's not your type of book.

B004EPYZZ8|1.0|Soul Surfer was an amazing movie, but not in a good way. They had a solid real-life story, enough of a budget to have Hellen Hunt and Dennis Quaid and some gorgeous surfing based shots and yet I think it was the worst movie possible that had those 3 elements involved. The acting was awful and a lot of the scenes seemed forced. The lame attempt at tried to show a spiritual side was far off the mark as they tried to show her pathetic church leader be \\"inspiring\\". Not a movie that is worth your time.

B0055PGUYU|3.0|I picked this up since it was #1 in \\"self help\\" / \\"personal transformation\\" (paging George Carlin; at least the second label doesn't have a hyphen).<br /><br />The book is very easy to read and is full of positive stories, so I think it is worth getting based on that measure. However, there is some lack of direction from description of habits to application. We are told that we must believe in something for habits to be remolded. What are we supposed to believe in? God like in the stories provided? If so, then the author should say so. Something else, like self-confidence or the power of visualization? I'm not sure what is recommended here. Likewise with keystone habits. We get some stories on keystone habits for corporations, but for self help, what do personal keystone habits look like?<br /><br />This self help book makes the usual gloss over of AA as being an exemplar for habit reformation while acknowledging that the 77 year old organization has never tried empiricism to see if they have a good success rate (they are only same good as no AA according to orange papers website). In the same vein of criticism, the brain activity graphs of the rats are more science hypnosis than popularized science. You look at the footnote for what the axes were in a real paper, and it just says oh well you can find it if you keep looking.<br /><br />That said, there's always a fresh viewpoint and information to bookmark in these sort of books, so despite the 3 stars, I don't regret reading it.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a take-a-chance buy and did it ever pay off. What I expected was a thin, slightly sour effort, what I got was a most pleasant repast. My only disappointment came at the end, I wanted more! The author does a beautiful job of dropping red shoes, leaving the reader eager to know more about this post-apocalyptic world and the people who haunt it's last bastions. I will be seeking more of the author's worlds, but I hope to revisit this one someday as well.

B007OUFESC|5.0|I can certainly see how the opinions of this movie may be totally scattered.  This could possibly depend on one's personal interest in the Psychiatric field of study, onto psychoanalysis, and just how far you are personally willing to take its concepts of the day. This wonderfully informative movie, directed by David Cronenberg and based on a true story, begins in Switzerland in 1904 at the hospital where a younger Dr. Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) is busy working with patients.  He is a devout student of Dr. Sigmund Freud's theories at the time. Jung is married and his wife and he are expecting their first child.<br /><br />Dr. Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen, who gives an excellent portrayal) is following as closely as can be to conventional thinking within the 'new study', which has vastly gained in popularity. Freud is a monogamous family man with several children.  He is now in his fifties and well-respected in the medical community although is constrained to have his theories accepted in the society of the day.  He must conform to a certain degree as to not step on too many toes for the 'new thinking' to be fully accepted.<br /><br />Into Jung's peaceful hospital setting arrives the extreme patient, Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightly) who appears severely ill while contorting, screaming and resisting with all she has within her.  After a short course of settling in, Jung begins to work with her while talking being seated directly behind her.  He is asking questions while she is raging and convulsing in her chair. Dr. Jung is trying to get to the origin of her illness as she tries so hard to answer the questions, suggestions, and to remember what has happened to her.<br /><br />Through a long journey of psychoanalysis for Sabina, a calmer and studious time in the facility, and a job of sorts working alongside with the testing that Dr. Jung is doing.  He is finally able to reach her and to help turn her life back around after the horrific abuse she has sustained.  He is also able to see within the drive she has of becoming a Dr. of Psychiatry herself, and encourages her forward. During her healing and beginning medical school, they become the best of friends and confidants.<br /><br />After a couple of years Dr. Jung goes to Vienna to visit his mentor Sigmund Freud and to speak on many issues.  Dream interpretations, the patient Sabina, and \\"The Talking Cure\\" are discussed as the two colleagues begin to get to know each other much better and with a strong mutual respect. They begin writing letters to each other, discussing new insights, even testing out dream interpretations on each other.  Shortly after these two giant minds meet, Jung crosses the line and begins an aggressive affair with Sabina just as Freud had been suspecting all along. The rumor mill has been aptly turning with Freud although questioning Jung at that same time was kept to himself.<br /><br />The correspondence of Dr. Freud and Dr. Jung runs a course of approximately seven years. The differences of opinion and the two doctors are also forced to realize just how different they are in their lifestyles. Freud is Jewish while Jung is not at this significant time in history along with Jung being more of a visionary of Freudian archetypes and Freud more scientific to remain medically relevant within the limitations of the time. The relationship also goes on between Jung and Sabina for the course of the movie with the addition of love, guilt, marriage, pregnancies and several other themes which are introduced and explored.  All three of the main actors present an exceptional portrayal of each doctor.<br /><br />I found this movie very astute.  Wonderfully driven with dialog and full of interesting theories of what was accepted during this time in history. It is definitely an entertaining vehicle for learning some things about yourself in and through the doctor's discourse.He is also able to see within the drive she has of becoming a Dr. of Psychiatry herself, and encourages her forward.

B006Z2WE0G|2.0|I had such high hopes for this book given how popular it has been. The story line was also promising. Unfortunately, 1 to 2 chapters in, I couldn't help but feel like I was reading something out of a peer critique in a beginner-intermediate level fiction writing class. The author uses formulaic writing techniques that are stilted and obvious, and her language is superficial and full of cliches. By the time I got to this paragraph in the early chapters I was ready to chuck the book:<br /><br />\\"He gave me one of his irresistible grins. Why did I have such an impossibly attractive husband? I wondered for the upteenth time . . . now at forty-seven, heavier, stronger, he exuded manliness.\\"<br /><br />The line reminds me of the kind of thing I used to write in my diaries during junior high.<br />The characters are one dimensional: her husband, a hot, sexy, arrogant Frenchman; the sister, a hot, attractive slim Manhattan lawyer and mother of two...Julia (adult narrator) was homesick for America because she missed the ease of using English and felt the French were cold and snobby...her writing simply reminded me of middle school English class essays.<br /><br />But I continued on because a friend promised me it was good...and so I kept going, with each chapter getting worse than the last. Like many other reviewers I was sorely disappointed halfway through the book when I realized that Sarah's narrative had ended (the writing of Sarah's story was so-so but more tolerable than Julia's)...and all that was left was Julia's story. I did not care for her story nor for her voice. But by this time I was halfway through the book and I figured I should just finish it given the time I'd already invested in it.<br /><br />The best thing I got out of this book was awareness of the Vel' d' Hiv' round up in Paris in 1942. Otherwise it was a promising story line that would have been more skillfully told by a different writer. When I read a good book I usually forget I am even reading; with this book every word was a constant reminder that not only was I reading, I was reading bad writing.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I was equally amused and irritated with this series of books.<br /><br />I was drawn to the desire of both characters to change to better suit the other person.  However, the actions of the characters belied this desire.  I felt like I kept falling back a few pages to repeatedly read the same section.  There was a great deal of repetition and I found myself cringing at reading the same things over, and over, and over again.<br /><br />This book struck a chord with me because I work with abused children, and have seen people like Christian in my work.  The dynamics of the relationship and the contradictions in who each person appeared to be, and who they \\"magically\\" changed into during these books was confusing as well.  For example, someone as driven as Christian does not seem to be the type of person who would a)stop working to build his empire to hang out with his gf/wife, and b)not allow Ana to work toward her own success.  If you want her to stay home, why buy her a business?<br /><br />Altogether, I wanted this to be a happy ending.  I got the \\"Breaking Dawn\\" version of everything working out, all my friends get together with my other friends, a pretty baby, rich life, great in-laws.  I'm a sucker for these types of stories.  However, as a therapist, I seriously doubt that love can conquer 28 years of self-doubt and abuse ramifications in four months.  Enjoy if you are an idealist!
B0078X2LKY|5.0|My preschoolers LOVED this story! I downloaded this to my Kindle Fire and used it as part of circle-time in the morning.  My students are very into all the new technology and even asked if they could look at the book later during free time--this doesn't usually happen with a regular book.  Well worth the money if it motivates them to read!!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|It's amazing what the reading public will call \\"great\\", just because it contains sex.  And not even hot sex.  I didn't finish the book, and thank goodness it was a gift, so I didn't waste money on it.  Pardon the pun, but IT SUCKED.
0439023513|4.0|I'm here to defend this book because a lot of the reviews say it was horrible and didn't turn out like they wanted it to but for me it turned out to be a great conclusion. when i read the reviews i was worried that this book was going to suck, that katniss just sat by and watched everything from afar. but i was actually really happy with this book.<br /><br />warning spoilers<br /><br />first off I want to discuss that this book is about a war. its not sunshine and daisies and it doesn't end with everyone sitting around having tea. its gruesome. people die and there isn't time to mourn. you are in a middle of a war and you can't just stop fighting just because someone died.<br /><br />also for the concerns that katniss wasn't involved with the war at all and just sat around. I did not get that at all. she is battling with post traumatic stress disorder and for anyone who is struggling with that they know how it affects you. and district 13 is using her as the face for the revolution so they are trying to keep her from as much danger as possible and with that i still see the same old katniss breaking the rules and trying to fight as much as she can (like when she was visiting district 8) and when she was in the capital.<br /><br />before i read the book i read a review saying they were pissed that katniss passed out in the capital so i was expecting that she seriously just passed out in the middle of everything which is not how it happened. she was injured and passed out from the pain.<br /><br />i even liked how you saw a change in peeta and gale. gale just wants to fight and peeta comes back with no idea whats real or not anymore which makes katniss realize how much peeta means to her and she is now the one trying to win him over.<br /><br />and to add. i never saw gale, katniss, and peeta as having a love triangle. thats too twilight for me and i always saw gale as just a friend or like a brother to katniss. turns out the ending was like how i wanted it to be.<br/><br />overall it was a good book. i just wish she elaborated on district 13 a bit more and how they got into the picture.
1612130283|5.0|I am not typically a reader of romance or erotic novels but after reading an online article describing the first book I thought I would give it a shot. I sat and read the entire book in a few hours which is a rarity for me! I could not put the book down I was breathless and could not wait to see what would happen next. The book was so well written that it keeps you interested and intrigued. I am, as I write this, in the process of purchasing book 2 and 3. At the end of book 1 I very loudly yelled \\"No!\\" because I did not want the story to end; my husband came running into the room because he thought something had happened when I yelled. LOL!! I am anxiously waiting to see what happens with Anastasia and Grey!
076781214X|5.0|Don't look at current Kathleen Turner photos -- she's aged. In the 1980's she was one of the most gorgeous of the Hollywood starlets.<br /><br />This movie is a classic. For those, like me, who graduated H.S. in the 1960's--the story rings true. The subtleties and the references to current society (1980's) when the movie was made -- to the 21st century -- are true and real!<br /><br />Don't be fooled. This movie is deep and thought provoking. One viewing may not reveal this. Notice the underlying humor; notice the subtle puns -- when Kathleen Turner laughs about the glory of the Edsel (great then in 1960 but an ultimate failure for Ford Motor Company). The cool guy at H.S. in the 1960's ended up working as an assistant manager at Burger King, and the Nerd became, well...Bill Gates. That's real world -- let's face it; the fact that Kathleen Turner ends up  favoring the \\"Cool guy\\" after sifting through all the H.S. phoniness is ironic -- but realistic.<br /><br />The fact is that the phonies and \\"Cool Jerks\\" then didn't realize they were \\"jerks\\" of \\"phonies\\" and in fact many did become truly cool and humble adults. People do change. Francis Coppola's genius is that he did see beyond the stereotype of \\"frozen in time\\" personas and did make a great, insightful film. This greatly underrated film (although recognized as a very good film) deserves another look. For Kathleen Turner and 1960's film buffs, this is a 'must see' movie.

B004QZ9PLU|1.0|I was completely and totally disappointed in the characters and how the story turned out. The only reason I finished it was because I wondered if Amanda would grow up, put on her big girl panties, and do what made her happy and most importantly MENTALLY HEALTHY, instead of what everyone seemed to expect of her. It did not happen.<br />If you're going to make completely twisted and tormented characters, please, make them at least likeable characters, and the identity of the dark-headed man was completely transparent, no pun intended.<br />I feel the only reason Dawson existed in the story at ALL was to play foil to Amanda, and I hate it when the bad guys win, which to me is exactly what happened with Ted, even though the outcome was neccessary for the story plotline.<br />Basically the best, most fleshed out character in the entire book was Tuck, who's death was the reason the entire novel came together.

B0011UBDTK|5.0|I actually bought this in 2009 for my dad for his birthday. He has since watched them all and gave it back to me so I could watch them. I remember the DVDs came quickly. Also when I bought this I got it for about 80 dollars. Some DVDs had a white papery cover on them. The case itself was a lighter pink and velvety. Very pretty. The inside had each disc clearly marked and also a episode summary or quote from that episode. It also had pictures of the stars when separting each season. Probably not a dad gift unless he was super into the show ( I was really young when i remembered my dad watching this). Perfect for a fan, a collector or anyone that loves SJP! Lots of extra features! I was young when the series was on HBO. It was nice to see the whole series and also understand it. I was like oh... thats why dad would make me leave the room lol.  (Im 23 now!) It really is a must buy item.

Some of us have spent a long time putting together our home theater/sound systems and we like to put them to the test.  This is the DVD I use to justify those efforts.  Superb video, great chemistry and un-matched sound quality.  The DTS mix is absolutely perfect and sound engineers should learn from this concert.  The band plays all the Eagles hits, plus hits from Don, Glen, and Joe going all the way back to the James Gang.  If you are a fan of the Eagles or any of the member's solo hits, you must get this DVD.

The Hunger Games still could of did better in my opinion but others seemed quite interested which made me confused.So... I don't know how the movie is PG 13 but I haven't seen it so.... it was a 3 star for me because overall, the story I guess was somehow great. Not my favorite though but ...great effort :/

B00756GKBA|3.0|Okay, I know this review will get some negative feedback. But what I write here is not meant to be smart-alecky or mean-spirited, so if you have another opinion, please keep it intelligent.<br /><br />My least favorite Madonna CD until now has been \\"American Life\\" which seemed to be a misguided hodge-podge of ideas, both good and bad. But if \\"American Life\\" was misguided, \\"MDNA\\" is completely thoughtless. Except for the album's title and the artwork, there is nothing about it that's remotely inventive, except perhaps the song \\"Gang Bang\\" which has Madge trying to play a murderous gangsta bitch from the hood, if you can buy that concept. Still as good as it is, \\"Gang Bang\\" not only doesn't fit the singer's personality or her background, it does not quite fit with the rest of the material. Although as I said, with no thought, nothing here could fit together.<br /><br />Song by song, there is not even one number that's remotely a standout. There is no \\"Like A Prayer,\\" no \\"Express Yourself,\\" no \\"Erotica,\\" no \\"Ray of Light,\\" and no \\"Music.\\" Absolutely nothing on \\"MDNA\\" comes within a hundred miles of those songs calibar. In fact, the much-maligned \\"Hard Candy\\" had some good to very good songs, and even its use of some famous rappers made some musical sense. Why on earth would Madonna want god-awful Nicki Minage or the talentless MIA barking out their insane, angry, childish raps on her new record? Well, it does fill in the gaps...horribly.<br /><br />\\"Girl Gone Wild\\" is catchy, but nothing we haven't heard before. Plus, Madge launches into her old-hat Catholic sinner girl routine, which she surely must have worked through by now. It comes up again and again in \\"MDNA.\\" Zzzzzzzzzzzz . . .<br />\\"Gang Bang\\" is a great song! MIGHT have pulled it off if it only fit with the rest of the songs.<br />\\"I'm Addicted\\" and \\"Turn Up the Radio\\" are good, fun, catchy songs, but nothing that will be remembered six months from now.<br />\\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\\" is an utterly dumb takeoff of \\"Hey Mickey,\\" with the added hideous nightmare of Minage and MIA.<br />\\"Some Girls\\"...meh!<br />\\"Superstar\\" is the worst. \\"Super,\\" \\"duper,\\" \\"star,\\" \\"guitar,\\" \\"car.\\" You can almost see Madonna thumbing through a rhyming dictionary.<br />\\"I Don't Give A\\" is Madge's confession about how hard it is to be her. Tell that to the guy on the street collecting coins in his hat.<br />\\"I'm A Sinner:\\" AGAIN with the Catholic girl-gone-bad!!<br />\\"Love Spent\\" could have been very good. Madonna's voice is BURIED in the mixing, as with most of the songs on \\"MDNA.\\" She sounds like she recorded it over the telephone. All-in-all, the mixing of her voice in \\"MDNA'S\\" heavy over-production totally loses her.<br />\\"Masterpiece\\" VERY, very nice song...for the film it was intended for. Sticks out like a sore thumb here.<br />\\"Falling Free\\" has a lovely, bittersweet, almost art song feeling. But again, Madonna's voice barely stays afloat in the mix.<br /><br />The songs on disc two of the Special Edition have a LOT more potential than most of what's on the main disc. Go figure!!<br /><br />So I ran out to buy \\"MDNA\\" first thing Monday morning...could not WAIT! Since then, I've played it ten or so times, and like it less and less. I actually find it rather insulting to her audience who buys her music. I thought surely this was Madonna's chance to BRING IT, to show Gaga who's the boss...especially after Madonna's spectacular Superbowl show. Instead, she fell asleep at the switch. So where to we go from here? My guess is nowhere. :-(of \\"Hey Mickey,\\" with the added hideous nightmare of Minage and MIA.<br />\\"Some Girls\\"...meh!<br />\\"Superstar\\" is the worst. \\"Super,\\" \\"duper,\\" \\"star,\\" \\"guitar,\\" \\"car.\\" You can almost see Madonna thumbing through a rhyming dictionary.<br />\\"I Don't Give A\\" is Madge's confession about how hard it is to be her.

B003EYVXTG|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence was nominated for an Academy Award (lead actress) for Winter's Bone.  Her performance is heartbreaking yet strangely life-affirming.  Watch the performance of the Army recruiter in the movie.  He is actually a real-life Army recruiter who is responding naturally to the questions asked by Jennifer Lawrence.<br /><br />My friends come from Missouri and they can attest that Winter's Bone is an accurate depiction of the drug culture in many of the rural areas of Missouri.  John Hawkes gives a mesmerizing performance.  The plot is hard to follow at times so Google the movie title and find out what you are missing!

B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Since her passing, I've felt compelled to refamilliarize myself with her songs. I got a little caught up watching her music videos and concert performances posted on Youtube recently and have watched her movies over, again. She was so young when she did \\"The Body Guard\\" but her singing and song choices in that movie have become legendary. She is legendary and it saddens me that I didn't appreciate her more while she was here. I can't imagine witnessing a talent like hers in my lifetime again. I was surprised when I heard the Whitney and Mariah duet. I had always given Mariah the credit for that song because it was in her #1's CD. I never realized Whitney sang with her. Between the two, it's evident that Whitney surpasses Mariah. I think she had a voice that surpasses all of the singing legends. When I'm listening to Whitney I feel connected to the emotion in her song. She tells a story when she sings and I'm drawn to the story because of how she sings it. She can quite literally sing me into tears.<br /><br />In choosing which CD's to buy I looked at all that were offered on Amazon and cross checked the tracks. I was able to come up with three CD's that gave me all of her hits and other songs that had become my personal favorites over the years. Her rendition of the Isley Brothers \\"For the Love of You\\" is one I could never tire of. I was able to come up with three CD's that accomplished it all for me. They are \\"Love Whitney,\\" \\"Ultimate Collection\\" and \\"My Love Is Your Love.\\"

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Just finished reading the Hunger Games Trilogy.  Fantastic books,so well written,I didn't have any problems with font size as some readers have had.  Didn't want the book to end.  I'm not going to go into each book in detail as I think others have done that, just to say that my favourite was the second book as I think it fleshed out the characters best and I'm glad that the last book wasn't concentrating on the love situation but on the rebellion, because I think that would have slowed down the momentum and changed the whole dynamic. More More More!!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|we love this game. it really makes you think because you have to figure out at what angle to cut the ropes to get the candy in the creatures mouth. not just a mindless game.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|I would love to buy this app but the reviews don't. convince me that its worth $3. Especially since it doesn't have very many levels.I think ill wait until its at least $.99. I mean millions of copies have already been sold make it a little cheaper for us poor people.
B004WX8HFG|1.0|I made this purchase wanting a Blu-ray movie disc, a regular DVD movie disc and 2 special features discs (and I didn't really care about the format of the special features discs although, considering the price, I was expecting them to be blu-ray.)  The description was a little vague giving no other description other than \\"Blu-ray\\", but the price was consistent with other Blu-ray + DVD + digital copy combo packages I have purchased through Amazon and so I placed my order for this \\"Deluxe\\" combo set.  However, what I received was 1 REGULAR DVD movie disc (NOT BLU-RAY) and 3 Blu-ray special features discs!  REPEAT:  NO BLU-RAY MOVIE DISC! Buyer Beware!
B0072X2O66|2.0|Well, there must be a lot of better rock and metal albums out there to spend your bucks in. I listened to it for two reasons: I love Mike Portnoy´s drumming and i´m always open to new options in rock; however, nothing really excited me here. A couple of good songs, another couple of Disturbed bad copies, end the rest... just boring. It´s a pity

1563894696|5.0|This is noir Batman at his best. A nice selection of villains from the rogue's gallery are here, the Joker, Mad Hatter, Riddler, Scarecrow, and Poison Ivy. And of course we have the trio of Batman, Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent. And I'm sure most of us know what happens to Dent. There's suspense aplenty, great action scenes, and awesome dialogue between all the characters. I swear this comic has everything a Batman fan could want. Don't pass it by!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Until like a few others have posted....Google removed their maps from the app. Amazon would not allow me to post this \\"review\\" on my Kindle Fire so maybe I can post my comment here. The app worked great and in my opinion, was better than most other weather apps. In fact, the forecasts seemed to me more accurate than what I see on local television! But once the maps were removed I decided to uninstall it as now with no maps...no radar. I don't blame the app itself, just Google.
1401207529|5.0|This is both a great comic book and Batman (origin) story. Seeing how he became so well known and feared (or hated as the case may be) throughout Gotham is awesome. But it takes time as he needs to work on his technique, going from a lucky amateur to a more experienced (though still lucky) Batman. We also get some very nice character development for Gordon before he became Commisioner, along with brief appearances from Selina Kyle and Harvey Dent. I highly recommend this book to any Batman fan, or someone new to the series.
0061137456|4.0|I am happy with this book. It is great to see the authors thoughts and edits, and is overall a very pretty book. However, if you want to read the poem for the first time this is not the route I would recommend. All the notes and handwriting can make it very hard to read the text. I would get another addition of the poem to read, and buy this book to gain more insight into what you have read.
B00756GKBA|4.0|I'm a pretty staunch Madonna supporter. I shelled out $400 to see her in concert this fall, good or bad album be damned. That said, I know she is often a mixed bag with her work and this one for me was right in the middle. A number of tracks were throwaway songs, but there are a few gems:<br /><br />THE GREATS<br />1) Gang Bang - The edgiest track by far. I would love to get an instrumental of this<br />2) I'm a Sinner - Super catchy and fun. This would be a great spring/summer song<br />3) I'm Addicted - A different electronica sound. This would kill in the clubs.<br />4) Love Spent - Gorgeous ballad. It should be a single. It's very unique. The bonus acoustic track from iTunes is also extremely well done.<br />5) Masterpiece - I love the arrangement and the production.<br />6) I Don't Give A - empowering and the beat is strong. I'm not a Nicki Minaj fan but I still really enjoy the track.<br /><br />THE OKAY<br />7) Girl Gone Wild - I like this song, but it was a mistake to make this a single. The video makes me like the song a little more, but it's not as strong as it should be for Madonna.<br />8) Turn Up the Radio - Fun and upbeat, but it's a little on the short side. Based on the previews I was expecting the song to have a stronger impact but it's missing that punch.<br />9) Falling Free - simple arrangement, but it's nice in its simplicity. The beginning reminds me of Prince of Egypt's \\"When You Believe\\"<br />10) Beautiful Killer - The production and orchestral arrangement towards the end saves this song, but the beginning isn't anything special to really make you want to listen to that point.<br />11) I F***** Up - This isn't really up to the standards of her best ballads. It's no Take a Bow. I like that she uses profanity with a non-shocking approach, but I'm not sucked in.<br /><br />THE MEH<br />12) Give Me All Your Luvin' - The worst choice ever for a lead single. Lucky for her she's Madonna and can still have strong album sales despite weak tracks. I will say that it's not quite as bad listening to it as a part of the album, but a good song should be able to stand on its own. The remix is okay. It's better than the original, I guess.<br />13) Some Girls - More like Some Racket.<br />14) Superstar - It sounds super juvenile.<br />15) B-Day Song - Super weak. It has a throwback sound but it's so uninteresting.<br />16) Best Friend - What a low note to end the album on. The song being positioned last doesn't help cap the album off with a bang like \\"Like it or Not\\" from Confessions.<br /><br />To be quite honest, I know a lot of fans didn't like Hard Candy, but I thought it had a number of fantastic tracks on it and I can listen to it from start to finish (save for Incredible). For this one, I'm compelled to skip a number of songs. I also liked Confessions significantly better. There isn't a lot of cohesiveness with this album that I sensed with the prior two. Also most of these tracks don't make me want to DANCE! She's got a few that do, but some tracks I just listen to for the interesting beats. I wanted more tracks to make me want to dance. That's a big reason why we love Madonna!<br /><br />All in all, for being gone for 4 years it's honestly not the most impressive return to the scene. But I know she's capable of awesomeness. Thank goodness she changes her music up. Hopefully I'll be totally in love with the next album.ll say that it's not quite as bad listening to it as a part of the album, but a good song should be able to stand on its own. The remix is okay.

B000V86OKG|4.0|While this season was still good. It is not comparable to the first season. In this season our lovable serial killer is much less likable (which is part of the story line, but still disconcerting). There are also a lot of gratuitous sex scenes. I also find the whole \\"dark passenger\\" thing a little cliche. Don't get me wrong I would still recommend it and it kept me watching the series, but I don't feel that any season as of yet has lived up to the first season.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|brings back the days of the Steve McGueen movies  great flick for all ages .....My favorite part was the ending  WHAT THE HELL WAS THIS MOVIE ABOUT?
B00008DDSC|5.0|This movie is amazing, because it is so original. I challenge you to find anything like it. And it has just about all that you could want. It is comedic, romantic, and has some very serious dramatic elements. If you are turned off by the masochistic elements, don't be. It is actually very mild. I wouldn't say it is kid friendly for sure, but some mainstream movies are much much more graphic and this doesn't even compare to what you would see on the HBO or SHO television series. This is the movie that made me love Maggie Gyllenhal. If you are curious definitely give this movie a try.
0545265355|5.0|It's an amazing trilogy as you all must know already. Its worth it because all 3 books are hardcover an it's just awesome you guys.
B0014I4KIK|3.0|Duffy has an amazing voice. I don't think anyone can deny that. However, I think she falters when she attempts to make more modern pieces. She really shines in songs that are retro, like Mercy. Mercy is fantastic. I could listen to it over and over. It has a timeless feel that makes the song seem that it could have been performed 50 years ago. In fact I thought it was a cover when I first heard it. However, I feel this is the only song that really shines on the CD. The rest are okay. If they come on when I have my ipod set on shuffle I don't skip them, but I never have an urge to listen to them. They are just there.
0440539811|4.0|This trilogy is the granddaddy of conspiracy theory fiction.  It also jumps all over the place.  It jumps in time.  It jumps in perspective, from first-person to third-person.  It even jumps into critiques of itself.  This can make it hard to follow occasionally, but it's worth it.<br /><br />The plot goes through pretty much every conspiracy theory that existed at the time of its publication: who actually killed JFK, the existence of Atlantis, why MLK was assassinated, the existence of the Illuminati and the Discordians, and countless more.  Numerology plays a big part, with many things being tied back to their numerological roots.  There are double agents and triple agents.<br /><br />I enjoyed it, although I'll say that I honestly enjoy playing the [[ASIN:B001812IQO Illuminati]] card game a lot more than I enjoyed reading the book.
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie is so quirky and so unique. Though I enjoy my blockbusters and formulaic romantic comedies. What I love are films that make you think and that surprise you. The story of Amelie begins with the story of a sad lonely girl and evolves into that grown up girls emersion into a series of mysteries. What is so absolutely special about Amelie is that it asks us to find mystery and joy in the small things in life. Another important part of my love for Amelie is that it is visually stunning. Almost every frame could make a fantastic photograph. If you have never been interested in foreign films, this movie could be a game changer for you.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Decided to allow people to get it free, and update a lot so Oh Non gets attention, and I loved the game myself, you should really get it!
B006UKC566|2.0|dont buy it like i did ESpecially on 3D! not worth the money but worth renting it and that is all. I personally thought watching this movie in 3D would make me like it better but honestly it did not. has too many blah blah blah blah scenes for even to worth 3D. PLEASE just rent it not buy it! or if you want something worth really 3D money and TIME BUY HUGO 3D and The Adventures of TINTIN 3D you will not be dissapointed!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was completely hooked after reading the first one.  This one begins with Ana and Christian apart, trying to contend with life without one another.  This doesn't last though, and before too long, they have resumed their passionate affair.  They both have to come to terms with what the other wants in a relationship as they try to find a way to love each other.  Christian has been closed off for so long and does not believe himself worthy of love, so both of them must confront that and deal with all of the issues and demons that keep them from loving each other without reservation.<br /><br />This book is just as readable as the first one, and a bit of suspense is introduced.  This provides an excellent forum to showcase Christian's \\"megalomania\\" and extreme control issues.  You know he's doing it to protect Ana, though, and somehow, it comes off as sexy.  This one ended and I was glad I didn't have to wait for the third installment!
B0006B2A2E|5.0|Honestly before buying the movie i saw it 3 times, and all three times it made me sob a little, its that the message of this movie is just to beautiful! and for the cheap price its in! its worth every penny no LIE! If you havent watched it please buy it now or even rent it i dont care but just watch the movie!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty Shades Freed was not as un-putdownable as the first two, but it was a great ending to the trilogy.  By this time, Christian and Ana have overcome alot and are a married couple.  There was a hint of suspense at the end of the last novel, and that comes full circle in the this one.  It also comes from a couple of different sources, and it keeps the story rolling.  At one point near the end, there was one particularly stomach churning moment where you are going \\"No, no no!!!\\" Fortunately, I didn't have to contend with this feeling long.  Don't worry though, despite all of the drama and suspense, there are still plenty of delicious sex scenes ;)<br /><br />One of my favorite things about the trilogy is the character development. At the very beginning, Ana was innocent, bumbling, and wide-eyed.  By now, she is strong and confident - the perfect complement to Christian's dark and surly nature.  Throughout the story, it becomes apparent just how strong she is to unconditionally love this beautiful but tortured soul. It ended well but still left me wanting a bit more!
B004SRNH10|1.0|Wont download.  Not only that I cant get rid of that annoying Amazon icon at the top of the screen.  I have tried just about everything to either download it or get rid of it including clearing the ram.  It disappears then the next time I look its back again.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|It is a good book, you read it with pleasure. Yet it leaves you in the end with a frustrating feeling.<br />The action really start to pickup towards the end of the book, and it ends with several open plot in pure suspense.<br />This would be \\"acceptable\\" if we could hope for a next book soon. Yet we know Martin will take long. So it really feels like he spend 600 pages slowly building something reveal it and cut you out before the end.<br />I am in balance between \\"I really want to read the next one now\\" and \\"let's forget about the series until maybe it is completed\\".<br />If you are in no rush to read it, just wait for next book to publish at least.
B005T87QCI|3.0|i think that they should have more bots or a story mode and it should be free i guess.  .
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have installed this on my netbook, laptop and desktop. I have access through my Asus Prime tablet to all three without any hitches.
B007IQX1G4|5.0|I loved the movie.  Very entertaining but dark at the same time.  Charlize Theron is easy on the eyes in this can you go back home, movie.  Worth the money spent as a video download.  Just learned that if you have the Kindle Fire you can download movies to it with wifi, then play it later.  Might have to buy one.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Yes, Intel is just beginning to release the next generation of CPUs in the LGA2011 socket. But, as we have seen with the frustrations that have arisen out of the Tic-Toc approach, the sockets quickly change. The LGA1155 is a great bet right now as there has never been a wider selection of quality motherboards available. Add to that one little fact: The 2600k (or the 2700k for that matter) is a performance beast. It can out perform a two year old twin xeon setup and it has plenty of thermal overhead for some very nice over-clocking on the stock cooler. You won't go wrong choosing this for a new PC build, even today.
0439023513|1.0|** MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT **<br /><br />...Where do I even start? I just finished reading and I feel so incredibly let down, it's hard to make sense of any of it. I suppose I could start with my initial reaction, which was that Mockingjay was a terrible mixture of everything that was wrong with the end of the Harry Potter series and pretty much all of Twilight put together. Nothing but gratuitous death after gratuitous death, a narrative style that takes you through hundreds of pages but leaves you feeling like you gained practically nothing from them, and a heroine that is reduced to an angsty, lifeless husk of herself.<br /><br />In the first book, and at least part of the second, Katniss is a strong, savvy, motivated, and capable young woman. But for some reason that I cannot comprehend, Collins decides in book three to completely annihilate this Katniss and replace her with a whiny, wallowing brat. Suddenly she is uncooperative, incapable of reading any situation correctly, thinks almost exclusively of herself unless a truly dire situation necessitates otherwise, and is reduced to a detached, melodrama-laden puppet who only exists to do what others tell her to. When her people need her the most, instead of training, helping to devise strategies, or doing anything even remotely helpful, she instead deems any participation on her part unimportant and instead decides to laze around and do whatever she wants. At least until such a time comes when something she finds personally interesting crops up, in which case she demands to be included despite her self-imposed absence at every other opportunity. Everyone else around her is working double-time to keep her safe and alive while she is content to be an unpleasant and disobedient burden. When she is finally able to heave herself into some sort of action, it feels grossly too little and too late.<br /><br />The entire book basically boils down to her waffling over every decision and being constantly drugged up and/or smothered by depression, and absolutely graphic deaths of character after character. Whoever this heroine is, it is not the Katniss Everdeen we have come to know and love, and there is literally nothing appealing about her. No matter how hard I tried, I simply could not feel for her, could hardly root for her. She has lost nearly every semblance of the backbone she once had, and I spent the entire book silently begging her to suck it up and deal with it somehow, rather than constantly give herself over to despair. Near the end, she even votes in agreement to hold a final Hunger Games featuring Capitol children, supposedly \\"for Prim.\\" I don't think I even need to explain why this decision of hers is so completely appalling and contrary. Apparently some are claiming she only consented to fool Coin, but there was no indication of that in the text whatsoever, no internal explanation or any discernible amount of subtlety to clue us in.<br /><br />Aside from the train wreck that is the main character, the story itself was a rushed and muddled mess, mostly composed of fighting, dying, politics, more fighting and dying, and little to no character development for anyone involved. If Collins' intent was to weigh the reader down with as much tragedy and misery as possible, she has succeeded beyond anyone's expectations. Aside from Katniss, pretty much every other likeable character is dealt a crippling blow, one way or another. Peeta is tortured ruthlessly (\\"hijacked,\\" they call it) until he breaks, believing Katniss is a mutt with determination to kill her, distrusting everything and everyone around him, and just remaining generally unhinged for most of the book. Gale is basically reduced to a violent, angry rebel machine. Prim and Finnick are killed gruesomely.<br /><br />And for all this suffering, Collins doesn't even offer her readers a halfway decent ending. Katniss \\"chooses\\" Peeta, but in such an unconvincing way as to negate all meaning in it. We are not shown the rebuilding of their relationship at all, only given a couple sentences saying that they started sleeping in the same bed and eventually Peeta starts kissing her again. Then flash forward to an epilogue where they have a son and a daughter, who she only refers to as \\"the boy\\" and \\"the girl,\\" and which she only consented to have because Peeta begged her for a decade and a half. If she feels anything for either of her children or her husband, the feelings are microscopic at best.<br /><br />After everything, the story is so incredibly, maybe even unbelievably, far from where it began that I only feel cheated. There is not even one iota of satisfaction anywhere, and I am somewhat horrified that this series is classified as \\"Young Adult\\" fiction, for all the brutal, gruesome deaths and total, unending despair with no amount of hope present anywhere. I am a full grown adult and had an incredibly difficult time stomaching this book. Perhaps I could be more forgiving if it were marketed toward an older audience, or if it only ended on a better note, but instead I feel tricked and I would not recommend this book to anyone. I do need to admit that I really did enjoy The Hunger Games and maybe half of Catching Fire, but I would advise anyone to stop there and pretend like Mockingjay never happened. As another reviewer said, I feel as if I will never wash out the bitter taste this book left in my mouth.
0698116496|4.0|It took me a while to warm up to this nearly-wordless book, but now my daughter and I both love it.<br /><br />If you like to talk with your little one while reading, then \\"Good Night Gorilla\\" is fantastic.  The only words are \\"good night\\" and the animal names.  The illustrations are the best part of the book, and they are full of details.  On each page there's a little mouse carrying a banana and balloon that's floating away in the sky.  It's fun to hunt for those things and to talk about the funny animals in the pictures.<br /><br />If you're looking for a unique book to engage your toddler, I'd recommend this one.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|This device is well constructed, although the parts do seem to be pretty cheap. The body is plastic and the handle bends slightly in your hand.<br /><br />Works great with a Canon Rebel T2i.<br /><br />Haven't tried using the included hotshoe yet.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Add me to the list of Woolites, I absolutely LOVED this book. If you are reading through the reviews and this book even remotely appeals to you, BUY IT NOW, you will not be disappointed.  The character development is terrific, the descriptive writing is phenomenal, and the story line itself is captivating!  Hugh is an extremely gifted author and I can't wait to download each and every one of his other books.  I haven't read a book this terrific in a long time, it is firmly planted in my top 10.<br /><br />I normally don't like any movies that are made from books (they never measure up) but please tell me you have sold the movie rights to this one, Hugh! C'mon, Hollywood, step up to the plate,this one will bring in millions!!<br /><br />Hang in there Hugh, I truly believe your name is destined to become hugely famous,your kind of talent can't be ignored.<br /><br />Just for the record I would like to assure anyone who wonders, I have absolutely no ties to Mr. Howey, his wife or his dog.  I simply loved the book and would like to encourage anyone else to jump on board, it's going to be a fun ride!
0553582038|5.0|If you are a true fan and trust the genius of the author, you will LOVE book 4! I loved the new characters introduced in this book, and could appreciate the fact that some of my old favorites were off elsewhere doing other things. It adds a little mystery and excitement to not hear from them for a book. I can't wait to find out what they have been doing in A Dance with Dragons. Honestly, I think book 3 and 4 are the best. 1 & 2 are obviously awesome, too, but book 3 will blow your mind book 4 is just as much fun. Can't get enough of this series.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Essential reading for those that enjoy the excitement of discovery--and how innovative and imaginative discovery occurs --The importance of having an A TEAM--and if you want to be a  part of \\"THE  SUCCESSFUL  PROJECT\\"--Plan to shoot for a seat on THE A TEAM--Thats where the fun is !!!
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I, like others, was surprised when my new Samsung PN59-D8000 arrived without audio out jacks.  So after rejecting the use of a home theater receiver due to space concerns, I stumbled upon this little unit.  It takes the Toslink Optical from the TV and beautifully converts the signal to analog stereo RCA plugs.  It is connected to Audioengine A2's which now sound really great.  I am very happy.  I used velcro like some other users to keep the install tidy.  I also had a few old USB to mini USB cables , so I use that for power coming from the TV's USB.  It all works super well.<br /><br />Finer points.  The Audioengine A2's are self amplified speakers and have a volume control on the back.  This is abit inconvenient for a TV setup, as there is not remote way to control sound volume.  I am considering upgrading to the bigger Audioengine A5's just for the remote feature.  I don't listen at very high volumes, so the small A2's are sufficient (even Drumline sounded full and rich) but maybe I don't know what I'm missing in terms of even bigger sound.<br /><br />Nits.  There is a small \\"click\\" or \\"pop\\" sound when the TV is turned off and the amplified speakers stay on (no remote control of the speakers)  It is not annoying to me, but it is there.  Also, the first time I connected the unit, I got a shrill, unpleasant unnatural sound coming out of the speakers.  I unplugged an replugged the connections (as per the manual) and it went away, never to come back.
B003TU1660|5.0|I don't get all the hate reviews I see here. I have owned several pairs of Tevas over the years, the last being the Terra Fi 2 which I decided to replace after 9 years of world travel.<br /><br />I read the reviews here and I was really hedging against getting these, but ordered anyway.<br /><br />After wearing them, I have absolutely no problem with any part of the sandal including the \\"heel pad\\" I don't really even notice it. The arch support is great. The only real difference is the heel cup, and smaller pads on the straps, which are comfortable.<br /><br />At the price I got these for ($%$) as opposed to $90 from REI....I would say an excellent choice for a quality piece of footwear.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I love Sophie Kinsella, This was a great book that was hard to put down.  Cute/entertaining read.  I do find however this was not the laugh out loud book that she had done in the past like the Shopoholic series was but still a fun and entertaining read
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is simply amazing; it has amazing range of function and does exactly what it says it does. A must download app for those on the go.
B002ZG98LO|2.0|I have to say that apart from the tusked/spiked alien 'pitbulls' and great looking Predators, this one seems as if it started out as a good idea (to reboot the franchise) but the writers lost their way somehow...I AM a big fan of Adrien Brody's acting and most of his films--but a 'Tough-guy Black Ops soldier' he is NOT!!! The idea of the doctor character who is actually 'working for' The Predators was ASSININE!!! I think Robert Rodriguez was NOT the right Producer for this type of film. Stick to 'Desperado' and 'Machete' dude--that is your niche. I felt sorry for Danny Trejo (who I totally dig) in this film-as an ACTOR...his abilities were WASTED and he gets slaughtered much too soon. The Brody character should have went to him or the awesome Larry Fishburne. The female in this movie is just annoying. Also--the 'alien jungle' looked WAAAAAY too much like one from earth. Perhaps if a bit more imagination went into the trees and plants, it MAY have been a bit better--but that would have cost too much for this mid-budget rehash of the first Predator film. The thing that made Predator 2 so killer was that the Predator came to THE CITY. And Danny Glover was his usual great self. Also the ending when he enters the ship and you see the 'Alien' skull gave us all a thrill (even if the AVP films--especially the 2nd one--were dissapointing). My choice for director on the NEXT sequel (if there is one) is: Guillermo Del Toro! Remember what he did with 'Blade 2?' The BEST of that trilogy by far...
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I t is so much fun because its not just a change of scenery but there are different birds and there are cool levels.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|Great choice of old song's, some with a twist. The more recent song's are great too. A view brand new song's are also very nice. If you are looking for a nice variety of Foo Fighters music, this one is the one you should have.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app. Works great on fire. Doesn't seem to be as accurate as Intellicast but close enough. Way better than Weather Channel app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this app.  It provides a variety of translations; it loads fast; and it has ton of other features any Bible reader would enjoy and appreciate.
B00005214X|5.0|I'm so happy to be filling in my music collection now that the kids are grown I can!  I'm very happy to have this to add to my Beatles Collection. I have always wanted this album.

B00003CXTG|5.0|The only thing I did not care about was the love story but might be most people need a love story for anything.  When this was happening I was only 18 months old. I give it a 10 out of 10.

B005HSL626|2.0|This game was okay for a while until it started freezing up and quitting on me. I've had to restart a game six times now and this is the last straw. I'm sick and tired of the stupid freeze ups and I'm not going to waste my time trying to figure out how to stop it. and yes I tried uninstalling it and re-installing it. Forget it. It doesn't work. So that's why this piece of crape deserves two stars.

B00701QVVY|3.0|Ok I have listened to the new disc 6 times in its intirety, and I can honestly say not one song or riff has stuck in my head.  Now this is very odd when it comes to an OVERKILL album.  This is much like the new LAMB OF GOD sounds like a bunch of left over filler songs.  With all this said its still OVERKILL I still stand behind this band 100% I just don't care for this cd.  First time i've ever felt this way from an OVERKILL album.  Dave Linsk has always been a weak link in the band in my opinion.  Ever since Dave has been in the band there has been an original flavor in the riffs lacking?  I actually think Dave is a great guitarist just not with OVERKILL.  This album is absolutely not on par with HORRORSCOPE I don't see any comparison????  Bobby G. needs to come back into the fold, his writing is needed more than ever!!!!
1469984202|5.0|I was recommended these books by Mr.Kindle but was skeptical for a while because I thought the books was about wool, the fabric.<br />Man was I wrong.<br /><br />If you are into post-apocalyptic stuff this is the one (five) book(s) I would recommend you start reading. (Why do some of us love post-apocalyptic stuff, are we crazy?) You'll fall in love with the characters and the story. If you are like me you'll probably loose sleep and curse Mr.Howey in the morning.<br /><br />Wool is one of those moments when you know you found something wonderful and you just can't wait for people to experience the same thing.<br /><br />I'm patiently awaiting the next chapter.<br /><br />These books are nebular!
0316056863|5.0|While I don't agree with all of Tina Fey's perspectives this book had me literally laughing out loud - looking like a crazy person to family and the random people in waiting rooms.  It's obviously not some sort of dark tell-all but it's witty, funny and at times, insightful.  I've always loved Tina Fey but now I want to marry her...
0767020308|1.0|The performances were passable - in my opinion Mark Strong did a fine job.  Since this dvd is an early presentation, sorry to say I was disappointed in the quality and could do nothing to improve the viewing experience.  Sadly, I returned the video - the return process with Amazon was very amicable - that's the only positive I could come up with, that is why this review receives a one star rating.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Many years and the fact that this movie has been turned into a pop culture touchstone still doesn't diminish it's sweetness.  Forrest manages to do what many strive for but few achieve:  maintaining a life of peace and simplicity in even the most tumultuous circumstances.  He is frequently mistreated and underestimated, but his disability doesn't prevent him from living an extraordinary life of love, loss, war and triumph.
0800141660|5.0|A favorite of mine and now I own it.  How wonderful to be able to view it at any time.  Yay!
B002H3T3TM|4.0|Magnificent live show!<br />Good picture, in spite some interview parts with a little picture noise.<br />Very good sound and good music too.<br />This was really a great show yet, too short for my taste ... \\"half a dozen\\" musics only??!! This show and fans should deserve a little more indeed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have read all three books in 2 days, and love them. Suzanne Collins puts her heart and soul in when writing the books. I wish there were more books! TEAM PEETA!!!(you would get what i mean if you read it):-)
B000HWZ5W4|5.0|This album always transports me back to the early 80's.<br /><br />Love the higher levels on this new remaster version.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I've seen this movie multiple times and it never gets old; the inspiring storyline and the intricate character development is simply amazing. Never could I recommend a better movie. Tim Burton's use of lighting and color in this film is stunning, especially during the scenes in the town of \\"Spectre\\". Watch and you will be amazed.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Wow, reading this one on your kindle makes it difficult to believe when you've hit the end. I kept tapping on the right, trying to make it to the next page/chapter. At least with the actual book in your hands you know the end is coming. Am I ever glad that I have all three books here. I think I'd be mighty annoyed if I read this when it first came out and found out that I had to wait for the next book to be finished. What a love story cliffhanger!<br /><br />At first I found the story a little hard going. The setting up of characters and the history behind the Hunger Games was a bit slow going for me. A part of me wondered if I would truly be able to make it through the entire book. But I'm glad I kept going. It ended up being a very solid book. And, of course, I'm going to have to delve right into the next one.<br /><br />Now, you may ask, was this reading in preparation for the movie? Nope. At this point, I have zero intentions of seeing the movie. Maybe once it comes to DVD, but most certainly not in the theatre. Way too much hype for me.
B000NTPDSW|2.0|I was very disappointed In this release! Why he decided that it would be a better movie if he cut scenes is beyond me. For example, he cut out the scene of Michael and Kay at the hotel, not answering the phone. Instead they show Michael and Kay returning from a movie and Kay seeing a newspaper with the news of the shooting of the Godfather. No explanation why they didn't know until long after everyone else knew.<br /><br />While Michael is in Corleone he marries a beautiful local girl who is killed by one of Michael's bodyguards. The scene showing the revenge killing of the bodyguard in America, is cut.<br /><br />In Godfather 2 the scenes of Vito's revenge on the guards that searched for him when he was a young boy, threatening anyone that would help him, cut. You get the idea, many scenes known to the fans of these movies were cut by the director! I am confident that many fans were disappointed by this version of the films and the numerous missing scenes.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|What a wonderful tool! It is my number one choice for on the go bible reading. I use it daily. I must admit when it was upgraded a while ago, I struggled to use it, but finally figured it out and found the upgrades and restructuring useful and quicker.
B006H3MIV8|4.0|Bob Dylan's songs have been hits for other artists since he started out 50 years ago. So a collection of Dylan covers isn't exactly earth-shaking. But this four-disc compilation spans the whole half century, with some 70 artists from every living generation contributing tunes for the benefit of Amnesty International.<br />Not only do you get a lot for your money, but you also get some fresh takes on familiar favorites, as well as more conventional remakes of songs that might be relatively lesser known nuggets from the catalog.

0525478817|5.0|Honestly this is a must read book for everyone!!! I totally loved it! I laughed and I cried the last chapters of the book and at the end was just speechless. It teaches you about life and love, and how to appreciate yourself if you are well and healthy! Makes you cherish your life even more and also it makes you realize how unfair life really is sometimes. I loved the characters and their funny remarks and how they made a joke of their sickness and not pity themselves. Wish the book AIA that they mentioned actually existed so that I could read it and love it as much as Hazel and Gus did!
B0013D6LEM|5.0|Yes, you should buy it. It's MJ for goodness sake.  Do you really need a review to tell you that this is one of the most awesome albums EVER?
B0063IH60K|5.0|I couldn't stop playing! Even love the audio. so much more convenienent than actual cards. love how it keeps a count on the # of moves as well as scoring. I can compete only with me AND have fun! Wasn't crazy about the ads after each new round - especially the ones with loud sound...not when wanting to keep quiet.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Want a good read on an airplace or a road trip that you have to keep turning the pages for?  Hunger games is your book.  I had a very hard time puting it down and still managed to finish it in under a week (and I have a baby and work FT).
0006486118|5.0|Well, the long wait for A DANCE WITH DRAGONS is over, and we finally get to hear from some of our favorite characters from A Song of Ice and Fire.  Jon, Daenerys, Bran, and Tyrion take center stage here in the 'companion' volume to A FEAST FOR CROWS.  And while the story hasn't picked up the pace to the level of A STORM OF SWORDS, there are definite areas of acceleration and the story is quite obviously being guided towards a specific goal by the masterful hand of GRRM.  I know this review will probably earn 10 unhelpful votes within an hour of its being posted simply from being positive, but I wanted to present the plus side of what is still in my opinion the strongest epic fantasy currently running (the negatives have been adequately covered I would say).<br /><br />First of all, so much of what made the first three books in this series so powerful is still present here.  The quality of writing and character development, the realistic grittiness and coldness of the setting, the brutal and painful experiences of the characters that make the reader squirm, and the constant foreshadowing of the horrors of the approaching Winter, are the tried and true formula for this series, and that hasn't changed here.  One of the most well-developed fantasy settings ever imagined only continues to grow, with more maps, more fleshed-out legends and history, and more well-defined geography and landscape.  The arcane has become more prominent, with magic influencing A DANCE WITH DRAGONS more than the previous books, but still the gods and their magic remain mysterious forces, mostly in the background.  If you have loved this series for the well-imagined world and characters, you'll love this book too.<br /><br />Also, Martin is finally starting to rein in the expansion of story-lines here.  It is plain to see the effort to draw many of the disparate stories into a few cohesive groups, with an apparent focus on actually getting this mega-epic to a point where an inclusive conclusion is possible.  Two books ago I couldn't imagine how Martin might possibly bring all of these stories to an end, but now I can just glimpse a speck of light at the end of the tunnel.  Not that I even try any more to predict where this is going.  I think you're fooling yourself if you think you know where this journey ends, as major plot twists are still the rule, rather than the exception in this series.  Who saw Daenerys marrying a Meereneese? or Theon regaining the hero's seat?  And for those that say this book doesn't progress the story, I just don't see how that argument can be made.  Every chapter here serves a purpose to march these characters towards some definite conclusion.  Not every chapter serves up battle, death, or assassination, but every chapter gets us to where we're going.  Despite being over 1000 pages, there isn't wasted space here.<br /><br />While it is plain to see that this book left a bitter taste in many fans' mouths, What did people expect here?  We knew this was going to take place in the same timeline as A Feast for Crows, and we knew it was going to be mostly set up for the final books of the series, but people somehow expected world-altering events and conclusive endings for major story-lines?  This series is a perfect example of enjoying the ride for its own sake and letting the end arrive in its own time.  While I hope that the rest of the series is completed in a much more timely manner than these last two books, in the end, those books will be judged based on their own merits, not on the amount of time it took them to reach me.<br /><br />In some ways, all of the attention and seeming outrage over this fifth installment of the series speaks to the strength the previous books have had.  I'm not sure where the insane expectations for this book came from, but just the fact that they exist is a testament to the quality and power of these books.  Call me a fan-boy, but to me, this series remains one of the best of all time, and A DANCE WITH DRAGONS simply represents one more step along an amazing journey.<br /><br />Martin's epic saga is able to draw you in, mesmerize you, beat you up, and spit you out as nothing else in literature.  Very Highly Recommended!!TH DRAGONS simply represents one more step along an amazing journey.<br /><br />Martin's epic saga is able to draw you in, mesmerize you, beat you up, and spit you out as nothing else in literature.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|I watched this movie and was engaged the entire time. At one point I really had to use the restroom but I didn't want to risk missing a single second. I felt so inspired and uplifted that I gave my own ovation right there in my living room.
B0033AI48Y|5.0|[[ASIN:B0033AI48Y Life is Beautiful [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />I saw the movie for the first time when it was shown oi the theater and I liked it very much. I took the opportunity to buy when there was a Blu Ray DVD sale at the end of the year.<br />I was glad I got the DVD as I forgotten part of the story; I remembered very well the second part when the main characters were taken to the concentration camp and how the father tried to show his small son that they were participating in a game to hide all the horrors of the concentration camp.<br />When I saw the movie again I realized why I liked it so much when I saw it the first time; it is a beautiful story, how the main characters met, getting involved and quickly falling in love marrying and having a child. The second part of the story starts with the persecution of Jews at the beginning of the Second World War, and Guido played by Roberto Benigni and son were arrested and sent to a concentration camp, his wife chose to go with them than stayed safe in the city. Husband and wife were always separated, but he always tried to get her attention, as example he played \\"La barcarola\\" from Tale of Hoffmann in the concentration camp while working in a room where Nazi officials got together.<br />I found the acting very good as well as the direction and music. It is a beautiful film reflecting life in its realities of happiness and sadness.<br />The quality of the DVD was outstanding.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Okay I just spent the week reading the trilogy and boy did the first two books and the first half of the last one have my attention.  The last half of the Mockingjay just destroyed the trilogy.  Not only did I guess what was coming, but she did it so quickly.  Even when she lost her sister, which it happened so fast that I had to reread that part to make sure that her sister died.  She just destroyed the whole reason for writing the book.  Katniss stepped forward to save her sister and then in one page she was gone.  Katniss the whole book trying to protect her little sister the whole time and then after she is lost she hardly even blinks an eye.  I mean what was the authors goal.  I won't see the movies now.  People need hope, because there is always hope and to leave Katniss in such a state of being for the rest of her life was wrong.  That is the worst part of the book.  The author is trying to portray there is no hope and the sad thing is this generation is eating it up.  That ruined the book for me.

B0041B785Y|3.0|Let me preface this review by saying, I am a die-hard fan. Meshuggah to me are one of the most innovative and influential bands in HISTORY, and in my opinion the most important metal band of the last 20 years. As a result, with regard to a new release, the bar for me is set quite high.<br /><br />In an attempt to not make a hasty review and, taking into account the complexity found within a typical Meshuggah song, I deliberately listened to this album 20+ times before arriving at a final conclusion and writing a review. That said, this a very good album indeed but when taking into account Meshuggah's evolutive nature and overall discography, I find \\"Koloss\\" to be a lateral move at best, as opposed to one of progression.<br /><br />Bottom line, it's a just a boring album. Fantastic musicianship, spot on vocals (as usual) and super-tight production all lend themselves to what is a ultimately very good album, but boring nonetheless. I'm looking for the dissonant chords, the more abrupt tempo and time-shifts, the mathematical song structures and although I can spot bits and pices of these characteristics, they are neither prevalent nor coming together in excess...to allow for the intensity and (ultimate originality) that Meshuggah is known for. It genuinely saddens me to say that I find this album bland and downright tedious to listen to.<br /><br />First off, they've made a move away from the super technical riffs of the past, in favor for a more thrashy, straight forward presentation, which (subjectively)  just doesn't do it for me. There's variety here...from thrash, to tech to groove but it in the end, it feels like the B-sides to Obzen.<br />When listening to (and analyzing) songs like \\"The Demons Name is Surveillance\\", \\"The Hurt that Finds you First\\" and \\"Swarm\\", I appreciate the minimalistic approach but where are the subtle, yet complex structural changes that only Meshuggah can develop? Why aren't these songs developing and evolving the way I expect them too? Yes, some might (and already have) said that they are going for a more \\"organic\\" sound. What does that mean exactly? Do more oddball time-signatures, polyrhythms and poly-metered riffs correlate with an INorganic sound?<br /><br />Secondly, Haake is simply not bringing it the way I expect him too at this point in his career. In my opinion, he is the most technically proficient drummer alive today (other than maybe Neil Peart) and an absolute prodigy. On Koloss, He just sounds lazy and uninspired. I am so accustomed to being blown away by his (off) timing and utterly original compositions that when I hear him play alongside the tempo set by (a) guitar and can actually follow what he is doing, I am left disappointed.<br /><br />Thirdly and, related to the above points, the songs feel under-developed; incomplete. There is some really solid material here but it is either too short or just forgettable, relative to their previous efforts.<br />This album doesn't hold a candle to Obzen; \\"Electric Red\\", \\"Pineal Gland Optics\\" and \\"Dancers to a Discordant System\\" is some of the best and most forward-thinking material the band has ever produced and with the exception of the beautifully complex (yet frustratingly short) \\"Demiurge\\" and the crushing and brooding atmospherics of \\"Behind the Sun\\", not a single track can hold up to anything on the aforementioned album. Its not necessarily about complexity or the lack thereof rather, Obzen feels more complete, more well-thought out while Koloss feels underdeveloped, one-faceted and frankly, under-whelming. Its quite possible that they deliberately moved away from complexity and focused purely on groove-laden thrash (to simply thumb their noses at the \\"Djent\\" movement), but considering that there is some of the former here, it feels incomplete...almost like a tease. Moreover, Meshuggah tends to not care or be influenced by the \\"scene\\", their critics or their counter-parts.<br />To me, the album feels like more of a follow-up to Chaosphere and prelude to Nothing as opposed to a step-forward from Obzen.<br /><br />In sum...a very good metal album, but just a good Meshuggah release. In a perfect world, they would take this album back into the studio and develop it into the beast that it could/should be.
0765365278|5.0|This is a great fantasy novel and Mr. Sanderson is an exquisite author.  His vivid writing draws you into this world and makes you feel like your there in the charachter's skin feeling what their feeling and thinking their thoughts.  A truly great read.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. cant believe they had it new for such a great deal like 8 bucks with shipping. Bomb! Even better the delivery was no more then a week!!!

B004MC8CA2|4.0|This version of audio word is great! I actually read my Bible along with the audio. That's were I discovered that it doesn't read word for word because , if you just listen to the voice read it to you, you might misinterpret what it means especially if your a new beliver. I like it because it pronounces the hard Biblical words.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|After reading the books i was worried that, like many film adaptations, the game of thrones HBO series wouldn't be up to my standards. But the actors were perfectly chosen and the director did an amazing job of capturing the feel of the book. I like that the author decided to let HBO do a series instead of a movie because it allowed more detail to be put in. The title sequence in itself was absolutely beautiful. Most of the time i fast forward through those things,  but for this series i found myself entranced by it every time.
B0054PSY2W|2.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. However, the Blu-Ray version has serious problems. It will play in an older Sony Blu-Ray player, but it won't play in my newer Sony Blu-Ray player. After over an hour on the phone with tech support at Sony, I learned that many new Blu-Ray discs are having problems and they cannot keep up with the firmware upgrades. Since Sony is one of the originators of the Blu-Ray format, I am obviously disappointed. They said that only if enough customers call in with the same problem will they commit the time to make their player work with a disc based on their technology. Before purchasing a newer release on Blu-Ray I would recommend verifying that the manufacturer of your Blu-Ray player has already verified compatibility.
068484267X|5.0|I couldn't put the book down once I started reading it. The harrowing life the mother and the children endured keeps gnawing at my soul. I kept putting myself and my siblings in their place, wondering how we would have survived the hardships. I can't fathom how Angela navigated life's vagaries. It is a story that touches at people's biases, pride and weaknesses. There was no relief for the children in the church. It was a little hell on earth for them - the beatings and the fatuous stories. The story is a testament to the indomitable human spirit and the resilience of children's vitality. Frank's father was a loving man at heart, but deeply crippled by alcohol. It should be required reading for all prospective parents.

B000QRIGLC|1.0|1. Not really written by author, and some parts look like they were stolen from another book. Coincidentally, there is another (better) book about BUD/S class 228 by Dick Couch: [[ASIN:1400046955 The Warrior Elite: The Forging of SEAL Class 228]], which sounds suspiciously like the source of Marcus' description of his training. Plus it is not clear - did he start BUD/S with 226 and finished with 228, or did he start with an earlier class and finished with 226? Also it is weird that there is no mention of him in Dick Couch's book.<br /><br />2. Here is the synopsis: He personally saw Al-Qaeda camps in Iraq that operated there prior to 9/11, he personally saw WMD's in Iraq, and liberals are the REAL enemy. The end.
B007G5K066|3.0|Well of course it's literate - it's a John le Carré book.  Where the book moved at the rate one associates with planet formation in the solar system, the movie manages to speed things up.  That is, ever so slightly.<br /><br />While the movie goes it's own way in rejecting much back-story, the editing mimics a degree of the time shifting style of the book.  Yet transitions are poorly placed and you wonder if you merely fell asleep and missed a bit, which is possible, than witnessed brilliant editing.  The story simply isn't all that engrossing.  Smiley is brought in and assembles a team to look for a mole in the \\"circus.\\"<br /><br />Thats about it.  Few surprises and the plot, while edgy in the 1970s, now has been done over a few times even by reality in the form of Aldrich Ames.  The cloak and dagger bits are few and far between, though action is appropriately brutal and well timed.  The second half is far better than the first.<br /><br />Performance wise, the cast is peerless.  To name a few, Firth, Hardy, Oldman and Mr Holmes himself, Benedict Cumberbatch give every ounce of credibilty you need for serious jobs like this.  Yet, there's still something missing.  While this takes a vote above disappointments like Breach or The Good Shepherd, Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy feels like a dusty old overcoat.  Sneakers from 1992 was more comic, less authentic, but more interesting and a better spy movie.<br /><br />Good, not great.  Saved by the acting and worth a rent.
0062082353|4.0|Not any better or any worse than a dozen other SEAL biographies. There is a lot of human interest stuff here about wife, kids and such which is all part of life for most folks.  More of a balanced story I suppose than the title would lead you to believe.  Not a lot of gripping, page turning action but a fast, good read anyway.  Kyle is a true American, patriot and warrior.  We need more like him.  Kyle, get into politics.
B005FMZVLQ|1.0|I bought an Invicta Chronograph 1512 over Amazon on January. A week later it arrived in perfect looking condition, but it didn't give the time. It would stop for 5 hours, and then start working again for another 2, and so on. I called the Customer Service and they told me to send the watch to them along with a money order of $28 for guaranty repair. They also assured me that this expenses would all be refunded to me as I sent the watch back upon 15 days of buying it. Here is what happened: they won't refund the money I spent sending it and not even the money order. I exchanged several e-mails with their Customer Service people (more than 20 up to now) and they tell me that  \\"Unfortunately for this case was already charge for the $28.00 shipping fees and we can not waive it, we can only dispute the charges before you pay for it\\". Can you believe this? I strongly recommend you DON'T but any Invicta watches, or be prepared to pay $50 (shipping and \\"mandatory money order\\") and never see them back, for a watch that I repeat, WAS ALREADY BROKEN WHEN IT ARRIVED.
0307593312|4.0|I bought 1QQ84 in pre-sale, eager to read what I expected to be the master piece of Murakami and was very surprised to find a less definite but way more convoluted story than I expected.<br /><br />Murakami puts together in 925 pages an intricate story which combines crime, espionage, platonic love, pederasty and religious fanaticism in the Japan of 1984, in a setting without cell phones, dvd or internet; a world that feels to us so distant after only 27 years.<br /><br />Murakami's 1984 is connected with the world in year 1Q84 through an emergency stairway in Metropolitan Expressway No. 3. This interconnected world is identified by the existence of two moons, and supernatural phenomena such as the activities of the Little People and the existence of Air Chrysalis where beings have their alter egos born in a magical way. Murakami elaborates again on the idea of humans and their shadows, reminding us of the heart-breaking shadows abandoned by their owners in the previous Murakami novel hard-boiled wonderland and the end of the world.<br /><br />The resilient  love between Tengo and Aomame is the factor that gives the lives of both characters a sense or worth from childhood, beyond the little routines of their simple and routinary lives as a Math teacher and beginner novelist in the case of Tengo and martial arts trainer and physiotherapist in the case of Aomame . Their youth and solitude make us forget at times that she is an assassin and he the co-author of literary fraud. Two other solitary souls complete the story. Komatsu, cynical editor who plots the literary fraud and Ashikawa, ugly-looking mercenary detective. Neither Komatsu nor Ashikawa have the fortune of love as an expiation for their twisted lives, but face torture in the hands of self-righteous zelots justified by power and money.<br /><br />Different from what I expected for sure, but Murakami got my attention again every night, looking forward to one more chapter until I was over with this thick but enjoyable volume.<br /><br />The book itself in its hard-cover English version is very nice, with the close-up face of  Aomame and Tengo on each side of the book and a rice-paper like protection cover. Very Japanese. I would not buy the Kindle edition. Worth keeping in my bookshelf.joyable volume.<br /><br />The book itself in its hard-cover English version is very nice, with the close-up face of  Aomame and Tengo on each side of the book and a rice-paper like protection cover.

B005LAJ23A|4.0|The biggest criticisms of season two are: slow pacing, too much soap opera drama (or as another reviewer said, \\"too much talkie-talkie, not enough bitey-bitey\\"), not many zombies (until the second half of the season), Chandler Riggs (Carl) being an atrocious actor (but that's also the writers fault for not writing him more natural dialogue).<br /><br />Season two is a lot different than season one, and I'm not talking about the premise. I'm talking about pacing and cinematography, and there's a reason for this change (but I'll get to that later). But first, let's talk about what season two is. Season two is about the farm. You're stuck there the entire time--that's something best known up front. In season one, there were essentially half a dozen locations--in season two, there's essentially three locations but doubled the number of episodes of season one. So you can sort of see there's a problem with pacing. But, pacing is the BIGGEST (and almost only) FLAW in season two.<br /><br />The reason season two feels so different is because Frank Darabont ( [[ASIN:B000P0J0EW The Shawshank Redemption (Single-Disc Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000P0J0EM The Green Mile (Single Disc Edition)]], [[ASIN:B0010X73ZG The Mist (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] ) left the show. He was the main producer of season one, and directed the fantastic hour and a half pilot episode from the first season. Here's the thing: by theory, not a whole lot happened season one, but Frank knows how to do a lot with nothing. I mean, technically Shawshank Repemption and The Green Mile were not action packed films, but Frank knows how to get audience reactions. Glen Mazzara doesn't. Glen Mazzara is an action producer (The Shield) that, for some reason, decided to make a very slow-paced season two (especially the first half--I think we all can agree on that). So, the question is, what use is an action producer if he's not making an action TV show? *Shrug*<br /><br />The second half of the season is when I really started enjoying it. Which is a shame, because I loved every episode of season one--and I only loved the a handful of episodes in season two. But season two is always the most awkward season. It's because it's in between one and three. I mean, let's look at books. How many people like Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets the most in the Harry Potter series? I bet there's a small handful. So, I can't completely blame Glen, because there are VERY FEW shows in which season two has been \\"better\\" than season one. Breaking Bad might be one of the exceptions, possibly Dexter.<br /><br />Oh, and other than pacing . . . here's another big flaw: Chandler Riggs. The way Tom Hardy trained for The Dark Knight Rises, that's how the Producers of The Walking Dead needs to treat Chandler Riggs, the boy who plays Carl. I think all the fans of the show feel the same way; a lot of his dialogue is too forced; he tries to talk in a deeper voice than he has (and therefore hinders his acting ability); he doesn't know how to realistically act in front of Rick and Lori. Part of the problem is the writers of the show giving him lines that they should have realized that Chandler couldn't deliver.<br /><br />I think this is a very subtle, almost impossible to prove theory, but it makes sense. Mad Men thrives off from its relationship drama; Breaking Bad thrives from its intense dialogue and emotional cliff hangers; The Killing thrives (well, it does have a second season) from being a mystery: therefore most of the audience, who are primarily women, who watch the show are pleased, because they want to be fooled over and over and over again. The formula is simple:<br /><br />Equation: the killer who they thought was the killer wasn't the killer so there's another killer = The Killing (S2)<br /><br />And The Walking Dead looks to its counterparts and . . . it tries to be like them, instead of being what it should be. Look at it this way, Rubicon (a fantistic, compelling show with rich characters, an innovative plot, and was exactly what it needed to be) got cancelled after one season, and the release date on the DVD/Blu-Ray? Your guess is as good as mine. This is what happens to 'shows that don't comform to the norm: they are assassinated. Maybe it's fear that is holding The Walking Dead back from being what it truly needs to be. In the entire second season of The Walking Dead, there are only two episodes that I thought were pure genius and fit the zombie \\"vibe.\\" Only two out of twelve. So much of the first half of the second season was trying to build soap opera elements instead of zombie folklore/Survival Horror elements. The fall of Rubicon might have been an element in Season 2's inability to take risks. Although, like I said, it's hard to prove.<br /><br />Ultimately, if season two of The Walking Dead contains all the episodes of The Talking Dead (with Chris Hardwick) then it's a must buy. But it's just not as good as season one . . . however, if you're a zombie fan, what else do you have to look forward to (aside from Resident Evil 6)?n innovative plot, and was exactly what it needed to be) got cancelled after one season, and the release date on the DVD/Blu-Ray?

0307593312|3.0|I'm giving this book 3 stars strictly out of my own reverence for Haruki Murakami, easily one of my favorite writers ever.  But this book is flat out an exercise in self-indulgence.  It's not that it lacks a hook - no, it has a great story line.  But it goes NOWHERE with that story.  In 925 pages, there are so many red herrings, vanishing characters, time switches and dropped plot lines, I lost track of what the real story was about. The editors at Knopf did a grave disservice to us as the readers and even to Murakami, who apparently is so untouchable, they relinquished their duties as editors.  Someone needed to tell Mr M when to STOP, when to collect his drifting thoughts, when to tighten the plot.  This book could've been half as long and a far, far better read.  As it is, Murakami seems to be channeling Stieg Larsson, with his intricate and unending forays into the minutiae of making coffee or whatever random thread his character happened onto at that moment. I'm so frustrated by this experience, so disappointed by my expectations of greatness.  Maybe I'll just go back and re-read \\"Hard Boiled Wonderland\\" to rinse the distaste out of my head.

0439023521|3.0|INTRO:<br />As I work at store that sells books, I constantly kept on passing by the book aisle and seeing those simplistic book covers (which I think are really tasteful, by the way), and I had even read the backs of the books and they sounded really interesting. They had a post-apocalyptic / dystopian vibe and I was really into that. Even before the film was rumored, people kept on saying how it was such a great book (but there's a catch that I'll explain further in the \\"TARGET AUDIENCE\\" section of my review). I never bought the books because I read A LOT, and I just happened to be reading the Harry Potter series ( [[ASIN:0545162076 Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7)]] ) and The Dark Tower series ( [[ASIN:0451211243 The Dark Tower Boxed Set (Books 1-4)]] ) back to back (which were both great series by the way); and, more than that, since I am an aspiring writer and was writing a book at the time, I didn't really want to read a present tense, first person book at the same time because I write in past tense, third person for the most part--and that could really screw up writing in an off-hand, subconscious way (and it did when I read the book, but it was like a 24 hour flu). The point being, I kept on making excuse after excuse for not reading The Hunger Games.<br /><br />About a month ago, a co-worker finally convinced me to read it (because I'm one of the only people at my work place that READS books, and I was like, \\"hey, it'll give us something to talk about\\"), so I read the book. And I really think it was beneficial for me as an aspiring writer, but at the same time I can't--in good conscience--give this book anything higher than a 3/5.<br /><br />TARGET AUDIENCE:<br />Okay, this is the thing: I'm a guy. I like DARK, SERIOUS FICTION. Authors I like: Stephen King, Clive Barker, Robert McCammon, Cormac McCarthy, Philip K. Dick, Ray Bradbury, Michael Crichton, Arthur C. Clark, Robert A. Heinlein, George R.R. Martin, and Margaret Atwood. If you know who these authors are and did not like this book, then there's a reason why; and if you have no idea who these authors are and LOVED The Hunger Games, then it's the same reason as the alternative: this book is targeted toward young (12-30) females--I'm certainly not going out on a limb by saying that, nor am I saying there cannot be exceptions (because there are always exceptions). Furthermore, everyone I know that has loved The Hunger Games (a handful of people), also loved Twilight; and there's a few reasons for this: Both books are written in the first person (which girls really \\"dig,\\" I guess) and they're both about one girl in a romantic triangle. Girls LOVE the concept of two guys fighting for their attention, but I gotta say that this wasn't fully realized in The Hunger Games--it's more or less expanded upon in Catching Fire and Mocking Jay, but it's definitely there in shadows . . .<br /><br />So, I highly recommend this book for females who love the Twilight series. But I only partially recommend the book for females who didn't like Twilight (because it's too much of the same but with a different premise). And I literally CANNOT recommend this book for a male who has grown up in the age of videogames, because it's just NOT on par with other books out there that are, in my opinion, better.<br /><br />CHARACTERS: 4/5<br />I like the characters. I didn't love them, but I liked them. They did their part. I cannot go into the lengths of dissecting them in the form of a review, because sadly they're too one-dimensional for such an in-depth analysis. But I did like them.<br /><br />WRITING STYLE: 2/5<br />First person narrative; present tense; short paragraphs; simplistic language. In other words, Suzanne Colins didn't take that many risks with style, which is okay. But, since I read a book every week, Suzanne's bland writing style stuck out like a sore thumb and I didn't like it.<br /><br />But, first person, present tense is becoming popular in the world of teen fiction. It's just something that I don't like because it limits the action (since it's first person), and it's just AWKWARD (since it's present tense); it's an unnatural type of voice. Then again, this is personal preference. I prefer third person, past tense (like Harry Potter)--and maybe present tense from time to time. I guess it's because I'm old school.<br /><br />PACING: 2/5<br />As an aspiring writer I analyze the heck out of other peers' writings. The number one thing I observe is that they have a good idea so they let TOO MUCH HAPPEN WAY TOO SOON. Suzanne Colins did the same thing. The first two chapters you were in Katniss's home; the following two or three chapters you were in the Capitol; then the rest of the book you were in The Hunger Games. What that means is that the first two chapters were really fast and then, gradually, it began to lag. That's weird to think about, right? You would think that the Hunger Games would be the most exciting, fast-paced section of the book. Exciting, yes; but not fast-paced--in fact, it was the most boring part of the book because the shift in pacing.<br /><br />CONCEPT: 3/5<br />It's a concept that hundreds of creative thinkers/writers will come up with without realizing it's alread been done before, so I don't honestly believe Suzanne Colins was copying Battle Royale. I really don't. But I do think she should have been a little bit more \\"thorough\\" in her research before writing a book that was essentially a copied-and-pasted premise of another book/movie. Oh well.<br /><br />It is a fantistically dark idea though. Kids killing kids. However, Suzanne Colins never fully reaches the peak of this concept in her story because she was limited by first person: and that's fact. I believe it would have been better multi-perspective and third person, because that way you wouldn't know which characters were going to live and which ones were going to die. You see, I NEVER worried for Katniss because I knew she was going to live . . . I mean, I'm inside her head, right?<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />PROS:<br />lively characters<br />short book<br />it'll give you something to talk about with friends<br /><br />CONS:<br />writing style is bland<br />pacing inconsistency<br />falls short of its potential of being truly dark<br /><br />RECOMMENDED READING:<br />[[ASIN:0451196716 The Long Walk]]<br />[[ASIN:1421527723 Battle Royale: The Novel]]<br />[[ASIN:B006L4MX4A Battle Royale: The Complete Collection [Blu-ray]]]<br />  - well, it's not a book, but you get the point.<br />[[ASIN:0451211243 The Dark Tower Boxed Set (Books 1-4)]]<br />  - if you liked the post-apocalyptic / dystopian themes, you'll like the first four Dark Tower books.<br />[[ASIN:0545162076 Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7)]]<br />  - if you like The Hunger Games, you'll love Harry Potter.<br />[[ASIN:0062094106 Abarat]]<br />  - if you're looking for young adult fiction that's actually genuinely dark, I recommend this.<br />[[ASIN:B0073SQWWC lord of the flies]]<br />  - it is the original \\"kids killing kids\\" premise in a semi-post apocalyptic world.n.

You see, I NEVER worried for Katniss because I knew she was going to live . . .I mean, I'm inside her head, right?<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />PROS:<br />lively characters<br />short book<br />it'll give you something to talk about with friends<br /><br />CONS:<br />writing style is bland<br />pacing inconsistency<br />falls short of its potential of being truly dark<br /><br />RECOMMENDED READING:<br />[[ASIN:0451196716 The Long Walk]]<br />[[ASIN:1421527723 Battle Royale: The Novel]]<br />[[ASIN:B006L4MX4A Battle Royale: The Complete Collection [Blu-ray]]]<br />  - well, it's not a book, but you get the point.<br />[[ASIN:0451211243 The Dark Tower Boxed Set (Books 1-4)]]<br />  - if you liked the post-apocalyptic / dystopian themes, you'll like the first four Dark Tower books.<br />[[ASIN:0545162076 Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7)]]<br />  - if you like The Hunger Games, you'll love Harry Potter.<br />[[ASIN:0062094106 Abarat]]<br />  - if you're looking for young adult fiction that's actually genuinely dark, I recommend this.<br />[[ASIN:B0073SQWWC lord of the flies]]<br />  - it is the original \\"kids killing kids\\" premise in a semi-post apocalyptic world.

B0071T5PN0|5.0|Wow. Van Halen with Roth back at the helm is impressive stuff. Michael Anthony is missing, but it doesn't take anything away from the album in my opinion. \\"Big River\\" is \\"Big Trouble\\" with different lyrics, if you are familiar with the Gene Simmons VH Demos (circa 1976-77).  The last song on \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" comes from these 1976-77 demos as well, but the name escapes me now.<br /><br />So is this the old Van Halen? Enthusiastically I say yes. The band is reaching way back to before their debut album, while also revamping their sound with new material.<br /><br />If you bought Van Halen (1978) and 1984, you need to buy A Different Kind of Truth. This one deserves to go diamond (10+ million sold) as well.

0062119044|1.0|With Tilda Swinton in the movie version of this title, I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie.  I finished it yesterday.  I hated it.  I give it one star just because someone bothered to write it but it's not worth reading.  The characters bear no resemblance to anyone I know or have ever known, the story is much more about the mother than the son, and she's enormously self-indulgent and spoiled.  The child is portrayed as demonic - do really demonic children exist??? - and the father is portrayed as incredibly clueless.  Both my daughter and my niece tried to read it and quit after less than 60 pages.  But by far the most telling thing about my reading this book this month is that my niece reminded me I'd tried to read it years ago and couldn't make it through.  I had totally forgotten this fact.  I must have blocked it out.<br /><br />I love a psychological study as much as the next person but this wasn't one.  It was unpleasant, boring, irritating.  I can't believe I finished it.
B004J4WV4Q|5.0|Probably my favorite pair of GTS Adrenaline shoes yet. I've had every model since the GTS 7, and these are the best. I recently purchased two additional pairs as backup.  They feel lighter than the other pairs, but I'm still getting good wear out of them (350 miles per pair, average). I highly recommend.

B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is a very addicting game, I've been playing it on my phone for almost a year now and can't seem to quit. Just started playing on my fire, same game obviously but I don't get on it as much. If you want a great time waster then this is the game for you, I play at work constantly so I'm online multiple times a day. Don't pay attention to people saying you have to pay for it, you can but I haven't spent a dime and still enjoy it, plus you can still earn gems without spending money! So add me: ddstrbdd and ddstrbdd1 on my phone and kindle respectively, and if you're really hurting for neighbors add my wife too at angelhalo :)
B0072X2O66|1.0|As a fan of Dream Theater, the common mantra of this album's defenders is, \\"Well, you shouldn't have gone into it expecting Dream Theater!\\"  I have always been much more of a fan of the metal side of Mike Portnoy's former band of 25 years so you would think that Adrenaline Mob would be right up my alley.  Portnoy has done some really great and heavy side projects so I was interested in this to say the least.<br /><br />I typically do not write critical reviews of albums because if it isn't my cup of tea, it may be for someone else.  I felt strongly about this album because I feel it is without a doubt the worst thing Portnoy has ever recorded.  The entire time all I could think of was that it sounded like Disturbed.  Admittedly, I have not heard much of that band...but there is a reason why i chose not to listen to more.  Bands of that genre certainly have a fan base and have done well for themselves...I just can't understand why these talented and accomplished musicians would resort to that style about 8 years after it was cool.<br /><br />In the beginning I found some of the riffs and melodies pretty cool, mainly Undaunted, but it took only a few more listens for it to become stale and boring.  I really cannot bring myself to hear more played out songs with juvenile lyrics that may have been cutting edge if the band were 15 years younger.

B006ISJQ1W|5.0|Love this film more each time I watch it!  Though it doesn't follow the book exactly; it still has it's esscense and is an opportunity to see and learn about the Puerto Rico of the 60's.  Johnny Depp turns in a wonderful performance as Paul Kemp and is joined by an excellent cast who portray their characters just as well.  The beautiful scenery adds to the beauty of the film.  Am glad to own this dvd.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|I'm inspired to write this review by all the one and two star reviews being posted. Really, how much game do you want for 3 dollars? And stop calling yourself poor. If you own an Android phone, Kindle Fire, and Internet service you are NOT poor. I drove into Seattle last night for a concert. It cost me Twenty dollars for PARKING. And last, haven't Rovio Provence their dedication to aftermarket updates? How many updates and expansions did Angry Birds and Angry Birds:Seasons get? Tons. Just freaking relax and stop downgrading a product based on your ridiculous misconception of worth.  Review what it is, not what it is not. I love this game. Finished it, played it again. Love it.

0307352145|3.0|Contrary to what the subtitle implies, there is little in the book showing how introversion can be a strength.  There are relatively few mentions of introverts in the sciences and the arts, where introversion is (arguably) an advantage; the author is much more interested in political figures and persons in the business world.  One gets the distinct impression -- through the many admiring comments on dynamic public speakers, and the numerous, and eventually tiresome, anecdotes about public speaking -- that the author is holding up for us as the height of success and accomplishment a person who can speak unafraid and entertainingly in front of a large group.  Possibly the author took a series of pep talks to  management types who lack confidence and turned those speeches into a book, which is fine, if you are an introverted corporate manager in need of a pep talk and that is all you expect out of the book.  However, anyone hoping for a discussion of introversion that doesn't treat it as a handicap, and that addresses in detail areas of life other than public speaking, is likely to share my disappointment.  The one chapter toward the end of the book on spouses of opposite \\"verts\\" was a breath of fresh air after the stultifying atmosphere of the corporate conference room that the previous chapters seemed to inhabit.<br /><br />The book is also flawed in not defining its subject better.  The author is not a doctor, so there is not a rigorous discussion of what exactly it means to be introverted.  The author cherrypicks facts about scientific studies and theories here and there to support her points, without always differentiating introversion from shyness or sensitivity (which the experts to whom she spoke apparently do).  The concept of introversion in the book is fuzzy enough that at times it seems an introvert can be whoever the author wants to be an introvert if she can use that person as an example.<br /><br />Despite that concern, on balance, I actually liked the discussions of the science:  brain chemistry and psychological studies and the like.  Those discussions tend, though, to be scattered among numerous interviews, which seem to be there only to lengthen the book.  For the most part the interviews are meandering, lacking insight, and illustrate nothing in particular about either introversion or the subject of the interview.  What I got out of most of the interviews was the author's fascination with each interviewee's physical appearance, dress, hairstyle, and jewelry (maybe she feels the need to reassure us that the dreaded introvert can at least *appear* to be a normal human being).<br /><br />The author's over-reliance on anecdotes made me skeptical on points I was inclined to agree with.  First example: the chapter on how Asian cultures tend to be more introverted tells a story of Asian-American roommates leaving the dishes to pile up in the sink because they're too introverted to confront one another; this occurs a few pages after the author lauds Chinese culture for its supposed focus on the group not the individual, but the anecdote about the dishes, to me, shows selfishness and irresponsibility, and  left me questioning the earlier observation.  Second example: Steve Wozniak, tech genius and co-founder of Apple, is used as an example of an introvert made good, which is nice, but she totally ignores the extrovert in the room - the late Steve Jobs, who, no offense to Wozniak, is even more identified with Apple's achievements, and is considered even more of a visionary and genius than Wozniak.  So is the lesson that you can be successful as an introvert, but an extrovert in the same environment will be even more successful?<br /><br />One last point:  as a conservative I was a bit irritated that her examples of successful introverts were from the left side of the political spectrum (for example, Al Gore, invoked as an example of someone who is \\"sensitive,\\" merely because of how early he started peddling global warming alarms).  Your mileage may vary on this point, of course, even if you're a conservative, but, if you tend toward the conservative or Republican in viewpoint, be warned that, much as Willie Nelson's heroes have always been cowboys, the author's heroes all seem to be liberals.

0553812173|4.0|Steven Erikson's sprawling series begins, very much in medias res, with this book. Therein lies the problem. You are thrust into the thick of things, surrounded by characters, places, events, and ideas utterly unknown to the first time reader. Problems daunting in any book, but particularly in one with the scope of the Malazan series. Looking back on when I first read the book, I recall being confused, and rereading certain segments a second time (something I normally never do) in order to fully understand them. The positive counterpoint to this is that I'm not the most patient of people. Many times when reading something slow that did not interest me, I have given up on it and quit reading it. This did not happen with Gardens of the Moon, because despite the initial trouble it gave me, I found myself deeply interested by the plot, setting, and characters. Less than a quarter into the book, those problems start to disappear, and the story really picks up. While Gardens of the Moon isn't on the level of Erikson's best in the series, it certainly holds its own, and shows just why he is such a popular writer among fans of this genre.<br /><br />Without giving much away to those that are new to the series, or simply contemplating picking it up, I will say this. The Malazan books, and this one in particular, are largely about various members of the army of the Malazan Empire. A great deal of characters are employed in this book, so if you are a fan of tightly knitted character drama, or large sprawling epics will certainly play a role in your opinion of this book. However, despite the large number of characters and locations featured in the book, Erikson does a very good job of making each distinctive and notable, so you easily find yourself rooting for some and against others, something that I always consider to be a mark of a good writer.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the fantasy genre, and unafraid of tackling a large series with a complex plot, dozens upon dozens of characters, and action going on across various continents, I highly recommend this book and series. If not, I strongly recommend that you give the genre a try... But perhaps with a different book, as the first hundred pages can be a little unforgiving.characters, and action going on across various continents, I highly recommend this book and series.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|A great story and must read for anyone. Martins unique story telling style brings many points of view all with there own goals and plot lines but never loseing sight of the prize veary much like The War of Roses in 1471 for the throne of England.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This seems like a good time to review The Hunger Games, what with the movie destroying the box office and all. This is a dystopian science fiction story about an annual competition in which children fight to the death. They are forced to participate in this as a penance for a civil war that occurred many years earlier. The main character is one plucky teen (Katniss) who volunteers for the ordeal so that her younger sister doesn't have to participate. There is a also a romantic subplot with a slight amount of intrigue in that she has two boys that admire her. I'm sure you can guess what happens to her in the end (hint: there are two sequels).<br /><br />In terms of plot, although it doesn't really have anything groundbreaking (the plot borrows heavily from The Long Walk and Battle Royale), but it's well paced and exciting to read through. I couldn't put it down and stayed up fairly late finishing it. However, it doesn't offer much apart from that. The setting and premise is completely illogical (for enjoyment it's best not to think too much about it): why would the ruling government think that slaughtering children is a good way to maintain peace? It's also implied that the ruling government maintains its wealth and happiness at the expense of the poorer outlying districts, but as described the districts have vastly less population, and given its advanced economy it seems unlikely that the government would really need the labor regardless. The best that can be said about the writing is that it's workmanlike--it doesn't get in the way, but you won't really every get much joy from some particular diction or turn of phrase. It's also unfortunate that the novel focuses so much on the violence of the hunger games themselves, rather than on the characters' feelings about it. Only Katniss shows any kind of nontrivial thought, and yet the potentially interesting love triangle among her and her suitors is barely explored.<br /><br />Overall, if come in not expecting much morethan cheap thrills, you won't be disappointed. After I finished I felt sort of hungover, like I had just consumed some drug that, while giving me an enjoyable high, left me empty inside of any authentic stimulation. But I don't want to understate how fun the book is to read while you are doing it. After all, it's not possible to read intelligent literature all the time, and if you read The Hunger Games instead of watching reality TV, then that's at least some improvement.

098357670X|5.0|LMAO!!! i LOVE IT!<br />I'm currently in the Navy stationed in Yokosuka, Japan and have always loved to doodle faces.  Ever since i was a kid, i remember i could draw the body and all the other features to my satisfaction but not the face. It drove me insane! so i began to grow an obsession of how to master the art of drawing the face, after a while, i got the basic shapes down and after i felt i figured it out i stopped.  That was 10 years ago.<br /><br />So fast forward to present day, and while i was here at work on the Ship one day i decided to do a quick doodle of my LPO (boss) on the whiteboard hanging up in the shop.  It was a REALLY simple face on this pudgy little body and a crooked mouth with a ball cap saying \\"arghhh.\\"  The guys in my shop thought it was pretty funny and everyone got a good laugh.  My boss walked in took a look at it and couldn't stop laughing, that was the moment when i realized i want to draw CARICATURES!  It all was very spontaneous and very random, but i felt like it was something that wouldn't only be fun for me, but also be fun for the people that saw them, and hopefully got a kick out of a likeness if i was good enough to pull it off.<br /><br />Having NO idea where to start I started punching in \\"funny caricatures,\\" into Google image search and browsed through page after page, then i saw this one caricature of Steve Jobs, i couldn't stop laughing i clicked on the picture and it forwarded me to tomrichmond.com :) That's where my inspirational flame turned into a wildfire.  I went through his website, all the tutorials and saw his offering for this book.  The book came in about a week ago, and i can't put it down. It answers every single question you could ever have about any detail of the face, breaks down an even more advanced concepts like digital color if you choose to take it that far, or breaks down how to even do live caricatures step by step to save time and achieve maximum likeness and Humor. I've got in trouble a couple times because i'll be reading the book more than doing my work :)<br /><br />Since getting the book I got this idea to Caricature my entire chain of command and so far the results have been HILLARIOUS! there's a point when your following Tom's steps in the book, and your drawing starts to come to life and you can't stop laughing and your hand is shaking and you find it a little difficult to concentrate because all you want to do is laugh!!! I love it. I did one of my Captain a couple days ago and was kinda scared to show it to anybody cause the likeness was scary! I scanned a copy from my sketchbook and dropped it in the \\"CO's suggestion Box,\\" :) i'm still waiting to see how it's gonna play out hmhmhm.<br /><br />But ya,Amazing find, and incredible book. Thanks so much to Mad Magazine, and Tom Richmond for making this book! Incredibly inspirational.  Forget about all those other books, THIS IS THE ONE!!!
B004C5M282|5.0|Fantastic band, great album.  It's a little old style rock with a new twist.  A few of the songs sound similar, but not enough to drive me from picking up some of their other albums.
B00756GKBA|5.0|While she has done some really zeitgeist defining music Madonna has also been able to produce her number of duds. This is not a dud: it is a surprisingly strong effort by a major artist rather late in her career. The songs are strings and the production is great, what more can I say or write. Buy it!
