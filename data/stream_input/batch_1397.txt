B0048LPRCS|4.0|Enter the Void is like nothing I've even fathomed before, other reviewers on this site can and have explained what goes on in the film better than I can, but I wholeheartedly recommend this if you consider movies as more than cheap entertainment. The whole experience is fascinating, exhausting, emotionally devastating, and unforgettable. 1/2 star off for the perspective got grating and the last hour started to drag.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I bought the controller awhile back for gaming with WoW then I started playing  SWTOR this works great with both game I love the resource meter for the LCD screen. It is nice and heavy and will not move when your playing. Its keys are painted on the inside... it is just made the right way.<br /><br />The only con I have is that the profile manage will not start on startup and I have to manually do this every time I start my computer. this can become very frustrating because I always turn my computer off when I am no going to be using it for longer than 2 hours.<br /><br />P.S. sorry for any errors made above I completed this review on a tablet before my keyboard arrived.

0439023513|2.0|On its own merit, I would rate book 3, \\"Mockingjay\\" 1 star. However, because book 1 was outstanding, I rated it 2 stars. Book 1, \\"The Hunger Games\\" was outstanding even though it has obvious errors. For example, the train travels almost 300 miles per hour and takes days, not a hours to travel some distance across North America.  At 300 miles per hour, it would take less than 12 hours to travel coast to coast.<br /><br />Book 3, \\"Mockingjay\\" is disappointing for a number of reasons.  (Spoiler Alert!) Most of all Katniss, a surviorer; a girl will strength and courage is changed to nothing but a symbol. Mostly she is under house arrest, in that if she goes hunting she has a guard to control her and she has no more authority than a private.  I understand that war changes people and causes depression in many people. However, you like for your heros to play some significant part and not spend most of her time recovering from physical injuries and in a state of depression that makes her incapable of contributing.<br /><br />Furthermore, the book was needlessly violent in the murder of so many Capital children.  And, finally, so many things happened without any clear explaination.  Certainly, I was unable to understand.
B005HSL626|5.0|fruit ninja is a n epic game that will keep you captivated and enteratined for a very long time. If you don't hag this app already DOWNLOAD IT NOW if u haven't played it before gig it a whirl! I promise you'll love it.
0439023521|4.0|This is a three volume book. The first book \\"The Hunger Games\\" is by far the best, actually outstanding, and clearly should be rated 5 stars except for how disappointed I was in volumes 2 and 3.<br /><br />The second book, \\"Catching Fire\\" is worth reading but not outstanding. I would rate it 3 stars.<br /><br />The third book, \\"Mockingjay\\" was a disappointment. On its own, I would rate it 1 star; 2 stars at the most. In fact, I only finished reading it because of how Book 1 captured my interest and book 2 held it. By its own merit, I would not have finished the book and perhaps I shouldn't have bothered.  However, I wanted to read to the end after book 1 was so captivating of my interest.  I could not put book 1 down but I stopped reading book 3 several times.<br /><br />In book 3, the girl, the hero of the story, was hardly that. Instead she spent most of her time being an injured or unable to preform due to regreats and depression.  Furthermore, although she was used as a symbol to encourage the rebels to continue fighting, she was basically under house arrest, unable to even go hunting without a guard and had no more authority than a private in the army.<br /><br />Perhaps the book was realistic in how war destroys people.  However, you like for your heros to be more than weak crybabies.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|This product shipped fine.  There were no dent or anything in the box or packaging.  The box itself, has padding around it too so it is safe.  As far as time to receive this product goes, it came in about 4 days (which is average for free super saver shipping).  The show is great, definitely a great watch.  It take just 4 episodes to get you hooked!
B004HEXSLI|5.0|This book is well written and insightful. I am a future occupational therapist and reading this book really helped increase my understanding of life from the stroke survivor's point of view. Highly recommended to all!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I bought this in hopes that the review I read was up to par.  Unfortunately, it wasn't. The plot seemed far fetched and the father was deceptive and overbearing.  You didn't know if the child was shy or psychotic.  None of this could be resolved because of the constant interfering of the father.
B003UYUP58|5.0|This was a very enlightening historical overview of cancer.  Following through to the present, it certainly demonstrated the difficulties in attempting to find a cure for this ominous disease.  The author researched his subject thoroughly going back to the time where physicians had few choices to the present where other sciences have become involved in attempting to slay this malady.
B004Y6MU6S|5.0|This book is without a doubt one of the greatest fantasies to be written ever. This book is surprisingly fast paced and full of action. Sanderson is one of the best and the books he writes will be guaranteed to become legendary.
0385342063|4.0|Sophie Kinsella's books have always been a guilty pleasure of mine; her books are ones that I can re-read time and time again and never get tired of; they're certainly feel good books which leave you with warm fuzzies.<br /><br />However with I've Got Your Number I found it an extremely difficult read to get into (I'm blaming this completely on my reading funk, as lately I've found it hard to find a book which has really kept my attention). At first I didn't care about the main character Poppy Wyatt, she came across as frivolous and a bit naïve, her fiancé Marcus seemed like a huge bore and his parents a right snobby pair. As I had extremely  been looking forward to reading this book and didn't want to tarnish my reading experience, I did the best thing possible and took a break and a couple of days later when I picked it up again it still took me a while longer to get into but I certainly enjoyed it a lot more.<br /><br />Poppy's wedding ring goes missing before her wedding; it's a priceless family heirloom dating back to her fiancés Magnus' grandmother. How will she be able to break the news to Magnus? To top it off within a short time of losing her wedding ring her mobile is stolen. Just by chance she stumbles across an elegant mobile dumped in a bin nearby seeing no one else in a flutter over it, she knabs it. However as soon as the owner of the phone Sam realises she has the phone he insists on having it back.<br /><br />The escapades and problems Poppy found herself in reminded a lot of Becky from the Shopaholic series. In a lot of ways they were quite similar; both intelligent women, but always finding themselves caught up in some mess, fraternising with big successful businessmen and always never thinking before acting. But Poppy's character certainly grew on me as the story progressed and my first assumptions I had of her as a needy brat, I take back because yes at times she was someone who always wanted to impress others, never get on their bad side, but she was also a lot of fun, she was at times like a fire cracker, that you're waiting to go off, uncertain about how much havoc she will cause in her wake.<br /><br />Sophie Kinsella has again lived up to her reputation for managing to create swoony businessmen there was Jack from Can You Keep a Secret (yes he was older but I was always thought of him as a bit like George Clooney). Luke from the Shopaholic series (my absolute favourite) and now Sam. Sam was often closed off and aloof, but when he did come out of his shell, he was passionate, fiery and just straight to the point and that's what I liked about him, he didn't beat around the bush or scuttle around in circles like Magnus, if he wanted to say something he would say it.<br /><br />I've Got Your Number was a charming story but also quite predictable, I knew how the story would turn out but that's also the great thing about Sophie Kinsella's books. Despite being predictable, the humour and the characters sneak their way into your heart and that before you know it, you can't stop reading.<br /><br />The added extra of footnotes in this book, at first I didn't actually get and several times I completely missed them until I got to the bottom of the page and realised they were there. But they definitely brought an interesting aspect to the story and brought more humour to the book.<br /><br />I've got your number was a funny enjoyable read which nicely satisfied my long overdue Sophie Kinsella fix. I just wish we didn't have to wait so long for another one of her books to come out.
B0053KWDES|5.0|I purchased this to use as a more mobile replacement for the astro mixamp that I was using to power my headphones. It succeeds brilliantly. I have been using it with a pair of [[ASIN:B001BYMZ5W Beyerdynamic MMX 300 PC Gaming Premium Digital Headset with Microphone]] and some [[ASIN:B00669L9JA HiFiMan - RE-262 - In-Ear Stereo Headphones]]. I must say, this think packs a punch for something so small. The MMX300s are much more difficult to power than the re262, but it handles them with no problems whatsoever.<br /><br />It has two switches on the side, one for lo/hi gain and one for eq 1/2/3. The lo/hi gain is useful when switching from the mmx300s to the re262s so that I don't blow out my eardrums. The EQ switch is just a bass boost, but if you are into that sort of thing, it works great. I have never heard so much bass coming out of my mmx300s.<br /><br />The only thing I've found wrong with it is that you can't use it while it's charging.
B00005O5CM|4.0|Reese Witherspoon plays a lovable, confident blonde who in an attempt to gain back a love decides to get serious by going to Harvard. While she's their her unconventional methods set her appart, which has both its pros and cons in the hyper-serious world of law school. With decent acting and a heart warming story Legally Blonde is a fun movie to watch alone or with your kids. It has some light drama but mostly this is nothing but laughs. It's a very sweet movie that'll make you want to go tell your own girlfriend, (wife, significant other, etc.) how cute they are. Definately worth a watch this is a comedy worth seeing.
0439023521|5.0|Done before?  Yes.  But for kids and teens?  Nope.<br />I read this as an English teacher, after hearing many of my kids rave about it.  It's exciting, the writing isn't so complex that it intimidates readers, and it's short enough that it can be read over a spring break or weekend (Unlike Harry Potter, for your average high school reader).<br />The plot is intriguing, and the world you're introduced to is an interesting one.<br />Most of the bad reviews here said they felt that there was too much \\"napping\\" or downtime, but there's just as much suspense and (justified) violence and I didn't notice any lag in the pace.<br />Overall, worth a read, no matter your age.
B0049D1TCM|1.0|I watched the superbowl this year because I understand the game of football very well and like to show off my knowledge of the game to people around me. I like to impress people with my knowledge of football, NASCAR and Lionel Richie trivia. I'm probably best at Lionel Richie trivia. I met him at an airport a couple years ago and stumped him with questions about his life that he did not know the answers to. When he would get one wrong, I would say Hello! Is it me you're looking for!!! It was great fun for Lionel and everyone around us.<br /><br />So I'm watching the superbowl halftime. Madonna performed like you would expect an old person to perform. She was flanked on both sides during one song by some lady called MIA that flips people off and some she-beast called Nicki Minaj. I was told by another person at my superbowl extravagonzapaloozafest that she is the best female rapper out there right now. I am a huuuuuuuge fan of female rappers and keep an autographed Cheerios box from MC Lyte in my memorbilia room, so I had to check this girl out.<br /><br />Sweet QP with cheese is this girl awful! I pretty much gathered that there is nothing original about her. She talks about how hot she is, says nothing with any meaning and flaunts herself around like Judith Light did in the later years of Who's the Boss. I really have no idea why she is popular. She has a big butt, which seems to be a key factor in her popularity. I have started growing a bigger butt myself to increase my already ridiculous appeal to the masses. I'm also going to start writing more about myself, which Nicki seems to do well. I am a great subject for songs and could probably fill another seven noise albums just about how I help others. Stay tuned, it could happen.
B000000ZGO|5.0|Desert Island Disc upon first hearing.  \\"By the Time I Get To Phoenix\\" is one of the most moving album closers ever.
0439023491|5.0|Never did I think I'd find a series that would pull me in, make me feel the emotions the characters felt and just absolutely blow me away again like the Harry Potter books did for me, but along came the hunger games trilogy. I can successfully say that The Hunger Games has successfully enveloped me to the point where I couldn't stand reading just one book that night and I bought the ebooks for Catching Fire & Mockingjay over night because I was absolutely addicted and refused to stop after reading book one. I read the 3 books in one day.<br /><br />I am extremely happy I found these books.
B005KDWUFA|3.0|Well I am a huge IL Divo fan & I was not even aware that they came out with this album. Not sure if it was just not advertised enough or if I was just distracted. Anyway, I have to say that I was dissapointed with this album. I only enjoyed three or maybe four of the songs. Llorando (track 2) just started way too slow for me and Time To Say Goodbye (track 10) was alrady previously recorded just in another language. Before purchasing I had read some reviews that were not positive and I still purchased because I could not believe them. However I am sad to have to agree with those reviews. I don't know if the group was just was more laid back on this album because they know fans will buy it anyway; but this album was sad compared to the potential and talent shown on their other albums. Hopefully the next one will do us fans proud.
0307888908|4.0|As one might expect, Hoffman spends a portion of the book flogging LinkedIn.  I am a user myself and generally find it valuable.  However, the book goes far beyond LinkedIn, and suggests a number of actions one might take to stay fresh and relevant apart from social media.<br /><br />\\"The Start-Up of You\\" is quick reading, but it is actually reading.  It's a real book, instead of the expanded slide decks that comprise so many business tomes.  The advice given is practical, do-able, and to the point.  If you are interested in a job or career change, or just interested in how to network effectively in the 21st century, this book provides some great ideas.
0446547654|3.0|I wasn't expecting much but a nice, enjoyable read. Most Sparks books are predictable, but this one was overly so. I was hoping Sparks would give poor Dawson a second chance at life with Amanda, but he wasn't even left with a life at the end. The poor man has had a horrible, lonely life and then you kill him off just when he has the chance for happiness?! And Amanda's kids' names were driving me crazy!!! By doing the math, they would have been born in the early 90's so I would expect names like Hailey and Jessica. Bea? Annette? Really?

B0008KLVG4|5.0|Jaws is a movie that needs no introduction. It has set the standard for creature horror movies for decades. I only recently saw it and have to say even after all these years it holds up extremely well. The movie creates compelling, realistic characters whom you actually find yourself caring about. This was (and is) a novelty for a horror movie. More importantly, the movie is subtle, partly be design and partly because of limitations in the special effects of the era. Viewers never really see the shark until the end of the movie, but the film does a brilliant job playing on the audience's suspense. Even when you know the shark is going to attack soon, you never quite know whom it's going to attack next. Overall, it's Spielberg at his finest and is a wonderful example of how a good script and careful editing can go a long way.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i coulden't wait  to read this when i heard it came out. This was litarly  the best book i have ever read.So if you are thinking about reading this book then you should.

B0058VW36U|4.0|well this a really fun game but sometimes I try to cut the rope and the moving thing gets in the way. other than that its fine.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|I like silly humor as much as the next guy but this was just stupid. It was a bunch of cursing and pen*s jokes the whole way through. The entire dialog was just a bunch of oneliners strung together and all of them terrible. This was a waste of money and ive never given any movie one star before.

B0071MV540|5.0|Lots of laughs and even sat onthe edge of my seat once or twice. Tower Heist has it all. Great characters, a stunning cast and a whole LOT of fun.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I was skeptical but Rovio managed to make this game feel like a real sequel as opposed to all the other versions that have been released. The gravity segments add a new layer of strategy to the gameplay &amp; the ability to see a predicted path of your birds is helpful but don't be fooled into thinking it makes the game easier. The precise direction &amp; timing of birds is still just as devilishly required as before.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I LOVE this app for the best view of weather with the best information, etc.  Just having a lot of problems with it shutting down or sometimes won't even launch at all!!  Hope they get the \\"bugs\\" out, because I like it better than the Weather Channel app.
B004EPYZTE|5.0|If you like the Arnold movies... (they broke my heart) this will be quite different, this is much more bloody and without the cheesy humor and sidekicks some people must have loved (and I hated, Conan wasn't funny and didn't have a goofy Asian wizard pals). But if you've actually read Robert E. Howard's (1906-1936) Conan stories, it's a whole lot closer then Arnold's stumbling fool. It's odd, the quote people made fun of \\"I live, I love, I slay -- I am content\\"... is actually right out of the books.<br />I think the fault of this movie was trying to incorporate some of the Arnold Schwarzenegger films story line into it. The whole vengeance on the people who killed his family has nothing to do with Robert E. Howard's Conan, the same with the riddle of steel stuff. Also, why is he in a dress? And what's with the obviously silly swords, (two blades?) while not as bad as the helmet worn by Mickey Rourke in The Immortals, or Russell Crowe's chrome job in Gladiator... it's obvious the designers wanted something new and cool, but stood out as \\"simply wrong\\". To me anyways.<br />Either way, I enjoyed it and would gladly watch a few more sequels, specially if they're closer to the books. When the books are that good, you don't have to stray from them.
B004UID2LC|4.0|This app works great for my Fire..but the only problem I have is that I'm thinking their mite be a glitch or something because when i turn my fire off sometimes the songs i downloaded off of the downloader would delete themselves, atleast some would. Confusing....
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is just a wonderful book. Even though the beginning is slow,the action of the characters, the passion of a blooming romance, and the struggles the characters must overcome makes this one of the best trilogies in American History.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Love this game. Not a rehash of the original, so it's not quite as predictable and space doesnt have the same gravity as earth: so welcome to a game that's a little more innovative and much harder to conquer. There is a new bird, and it's really worth getting three stars in a game:Besides eggs, there are other games to enjoy. Wont ruin the surprise, just saying it's worth making sure you can get all three stars. It will take you oonger to rule this game, and it's worth the extra couple of bucks to get the kindle fire version.

B003F1WM2K|1.0|This was the most boring book I have read in a long time. Patti drops names constantly. The average person would not even know who she's talking about. I had no idea  who these people were. Too many words to express a thought. Get to the point! I only kept reading because I paid 11.99 for the kindle version. The last 25 % I skimmed thru just to end my suffering. My advice don't  bother.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|If i could give this game 10 star i would...graphics, responsiveness, originality, etc. all profected in one app this is how all google, apple, and others apps should look and feel like Rovio Entertainment are all geniuses. Tip of the hat to you! And thank you apps like this make me proud to own a google phone (tmobile samsunh galaxy s2)
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I am not a marathon runner, but this watch could very well make me one.  The features are very helpful in helping to find and maintain your pace (wich was my biggest struggle).  The virtual partner keeps you pushing yourself.  Additionally, this watch works well with cycling.  If you are all about cadence, there's an add-on for that.  Rechargeable batties are a big plus.  The only thing I find as a drawback is the lack of a Vibrating alert versus the sound.  I like to listen to music while I run/cycle.  The bezal is not difficult to operate, it just takes some gettingused to.  GPS works great, HR monitor syncs within 10 secs.<br />Overall, great product.

B006X08FDA|5.0|I've loved the Carolina Chocolate Drops ever since their first release on the Music Maker label and I've had the pleasure of seeing them perform, both together and individually, at a few folk festivals as well as the International Folk Alliance. They continue to astound me with both their knowledge of a wide range of music styles and their talent at performing on an amazing variety of instruments - all acoustic.<br /><br />The group consists of multiinstrumentalist Dom Flemmons, vocalist and fiddle player Rhiannon Giddens and guitarist/mandolin player Hubby Jenkins About half of the 15 tracks here are \\"traditional\\" while others come from early music pioneers like J.E. Mainer, Cousin Emmy and Hazel Dickens. But they really mix it up by including the Tin Pan Alley song \\"No Man's Mama\\" composed by Lew Pollack and Jack Yellen and originally recorded by Ethel Waters. \\"West End Blues\\" is not to be confused with the classic Louis Armstrong instrumental but is the song that banjoist Etta Baker wrote to which Giddens added lyrics. Speaking of Giddens, if you liked her take on the pop hit \\"Hit `em up style\\" on the last CCD album, you'll love \\"I'm A Country Girl\\" on this one.<br /><br />I could go on and on about how great this album is but listen to some samples and I think the Drops will convince you (that is, if you aren't already a fan).<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B007MNV5WU|5.0|If you buy any of the three Angry Birds sequels this is the one to get. The new gravity feature helps reinvent gameplay and makes it a unique experience compared to other version. A definite must have.
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|When the new film \\"The Muppets\\" (not to be confused with the earlier film, \\"The Muppet Movie\\") was released to theaters last year I reviewed the soundtrack CD here on Amazon. I downgraded my review because some of songs didn't \\"work\\" aurally and I was taken to task by a few folks because, at the time of my review, I had not seen the film. I was told that if I saw the film the songs would make sense. Well, I missed it in the theater but, based on the new Bluray DVD\\"Wocka-Wacka Pack\\", I now understand the comments. And fully agree that the CD does work - if you've seen the film.<br /><br />But we are discussing the DVD here so I'll get to that. As of today there are over 80 reviews posted on Amazon. But Amazon has a policy of combining ALL reviews of a film, whether in theaters or on DVD. And with DVD all reviews are combined whether the single DVD or BD or special editions. I'm commenting here on the 3-Sisc Combo Pack which includes the DVD version with ONE bonus feature - The Blooper reel\\", disc with a digital copy of the film and the BD with about 35 minutes of featurettes plus the Director's Commentary. The longest feature is the 15 minute \\"Making of\\" the film, there are nine deleted scenes totaling 10 minutes, The blooper reel runs eight minutes and the very funny \\"trailer spoofs\\" fill another nine minutes.<br /><br />The film is great and is perfect for ALL AGES. I certainly don't have to explain the Muppets to anyone. They are icons. The new songs this time are by Bret McKenzie (half of the \\"Flight of the Conchords\\" duo) and are really tuneful. (One of the featurettes has him discussing the styles he was trying to use). The plot goes back to the old Mickey (Rooney, not Mouse) and Judy (Garland) film musicals with the theme \\"Let's put on a show and save the (insert cause here)!\\"<br /><br />I found the menu prompts a bit difficult to use and never was able to get the new \\"Disney Intermission\\" feature (where the Muppets take over the screen if you pause the film) but I'm not a technophile either. The Muppet \\"Screen Tests\\" were another fun feature.<br /><br />So it's now a few days since I watched the film and I'm still humming the tunes. (Oh yes, if you don't have the soundtrack CD you get a digital copy of the soundtrack with the \\"Wocka-Wocka\\" version.<br /><br />Kermit and Miss Piggy rule! (And Jason Segal, Amy Adams and Chris Cooper - the non-Muppets (I won't say \\"human actors\\") - are not bad either.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"but I'm not a technophile either.

0307352145|5.0|This book can help both introverts and extroverts understand themselves, their behavior, relationships and most importantly -- how to improve all of the above. It is well researched and is illustrated with many examples of well known people.<br /><br />I have known I was an introvert for many decades but due to a very fortunate upbringing I was able to learn to suppress much of the external introversion and project the personality required by society -- this eventually helped me rise to leadership positions. However, until I read this book I did not truly understand why it was a constant battle to maintain my external persona.  I thought that I could through the sheer brute force of willpower change it permanently.<br /><br />The book has made me realize why I behave the way I do and more importantly how to handle it in a way that does not cause unnecessary stress. It has helped me understand why some relationships (both professional and personal) with extroverts did not go well, and how to better handle existing ones. The information from the book \\"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus\\" is only 25% helpful because it completely ignores the introvert/extrovert personality types. This book adds that to the equation and suddenly the reason for the relationship behaviors becomes crystal clear.<br /><br />Another, important insight the book gives is the value both personality types bring to the table. No one type is better than the other. The only difference is that modern American society values an extroverted persona more. After all \\"the squeaky wheel gets the grease\\". Empirical studies actually show that business environments that tend to nurture only extroverted people (open work areas, group decision-making etc.) are less effective than a more balanced environment, where introverts can get some quiet time to come up with groundbreaking ideas without the distraction of a boisterous extrovert constantly raising a ruckus nearby.<br /><br />Finally there is a sectionthat is incredibly valuable for parents raising an introverted child.
B007IQX1G4|1.0|Don't waste your time and money renting or buying this one. It was slow moving, un-engaging, and boring. Depressing really.
B0001XALTG|5.0|Trainspotting the movie is great I love ewan mcgregor as Renton but as in most cases the book was 100% better. In the book you see the characters for more than their addictions and overall see more aspects of their lives. I know when a book is translated into a movie edits must be made and you're not going to get all that you read. Nonetheless trainspotting is a good movie(I bought the directors cut which are usually better). I recomend reading the book first before seeing the movie.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|controls not that great but it's a free game with tons of options. was going to give at least four stars until I tried clicking on the free button and then one of the apps to download so I can get more points to unlock games. game crashes every time I click on an app to download to get points. every time. that just ruins the trust in the game. using a kindle fire. maybe it's not ready for the kindle fire?
B0063IH60K|4.0|ads are a little annoying, but within expectations for a free version.  gameplay and graphics are very good.  if you want solitaire this is a good choice.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|The newest installment of the angry birds franchise is the best one yet. It could have more levels, but I guess they all only start with 60. Now the original has over 300. This game adds a dimension to the gameplay by using zero gravity as part of the physics. if you pass a planet, you get sucked toward it. Best birds game yet
0385535139|5.0|See my review as a comment on Eric Wilson's \\"Novelist\\" most favourite review. My recommendation is: buy the book and have fun, lots of fun and don't let the way the defendant conducts his business discourage you. That's the way of the world, sadly.

B003EYVXV4|5.0|I went to see this movie at the midnight showing. I already loved the books, and had been exploding with excitement waiting to see it. When I left the theater, I felt no different. It had not made the book look bad like some movies do, and I couldn't wait to see it again. I told everyone how good it is the next day(or later that day, since I went to the midnight showing,), and repeated answering the same question the same way many times.<br />  Q: \\"Was the movie good?\\" A: \\"HECK YES! IT WAS THE BEST MOVIE EVER! YOU NEED TO SEE THIS!\\"<br />  I still feel this way and have the feeling I will feel this way for a long time. This is the best movie ever!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game is awesome I like that it has darts and most of the games are awesome and the rocket game is cool to
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Love this game. Keeps u thinking. I used go play this on my computer so happy amazon has a kindle fire app. I suggest everyone download!
0439023513|3.0|The Ending was so rushed in this book i had no time to feel hardly any emotion. When major characters died i couldn't get a chance to let it sink in and feel sad about it. The book did keep me intrigued to the point of never wanting to put it down, but the last chapter was just a rush of months pushed into a few pages. I didn't feel any closure with Gale, yes we know what he's doing but i felt she didn't spend as much time on his as she should have. The beginning was a little dragged out and the end was just completely crunched that i felt cheated by the ending. Nonetheless, i do love this series, so for the most part, i loved the book. I just wish she would have gone a little more in depth in certain areas of the book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's an excellent little Bible. A lot of free Bible versions available for offline.<br />But one suggestion for improvement, if note and highlight can be added without having to connect ti the Internet.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Definitely worth getting. Familiar enough to jump right in and know how to play the game, yet it manages to do away with the formulaic over-repetition of the previous Angry Birds titles (Seasons, etc.), which felt like they were just adding more levels and different graphics. I love having to intuit how the gravity works, and the way you can sling-shot around the little planetoids.<br /><br />For instance, hint: If on one level it looks impossible to break through some barrier to get at the pigs, see if there's another route possible around the other side.<br /><br />One nice feature about the Kindle Fire version is the screen is large enough to really see what you're doing. I'd played Angry Birds on my Android phone, but was always annoyed by the fact I often could not see what I was shooting at, or would have to shrink things down to the point where I could no longer launch the birds with any precision.<br /><br />The other thing I like about Angry Birds Space is you can now see a dotted-line trajectory. Now, when a launch goes wrong, I can much more easily try a different one. In previous Angry Bird iterations, I'd get stuck on a level and end up shooting in the same direction over and over until almost by chance I'd finally get the right angle.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I have an idea for the app store only for kindle fire. the app maker. you can make your own apps only on your kindle fire. and on the app you can send your app to the app store and maybe it can be in the app store for other people to buy.

B004T2QZL8|3.0|Awesome game...I like it a lot, but once you start to have 80+ elements, it freezes until you restart and then you can only play for 5 minutes out so before it freezes over and over again. They say they want 5 stars to make updates, but to me, 5 stars is a close to perfect game. A game that freezes is no where near a perfect game! I'd give 5+ stars if it just didn't freeze...is that too much to ask?

B003EYVXV4|4.0|In my opinion, your devotion to the book will determine how much you like this movie. My daughter devoured the books and we decided to go to the midnight show at our local drive in theater.<br />The Hunger Games movie is entertaining, but when compared to the book it falls short in several departments (like nearly every other book-to-film adaptation).<br />One major disappointment was that the background of the Mockingjay pin was inaccurate. I don't plan on posting any spoilers here but you can comment here and I can post specifics.<br />Katniss' costume for the Districts introduction was kind of lame. I was expecting them to really pull off some cool costume but ehh on that.<br />There are several other things in the movie that just didn't happen at all in the book and several things were changed<br />The actors were all fantastic and I especially got a kick out of Elizabeth Banks' Effie and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch. Too bad they didn't focus on him as much as in the book.<br />Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman- wow awesome- just as I imagined! And Lenny Kravitz was so endearing and wonderful as Cinna! Jennifer Lawrence was great as Katniss and brought such humanity, loyalty, and focus of what it all meant to be in the Hunger Games. This was a 2 hour and 22 minute movie and it easily could have been longer to accommodate more specifics of the book.<br />Overall, it was a good movie, but you can find things to nitpick if you are a huge fan of the books. We look forward to seeing the 2 other movies set to be released.

B00009Z576|4.0|First off, this album has well over a hundred reviews on Amazon already, so I realize that there is not a great chance that this review will be read. But, being a huge Yes fan, and a huge Drama fan in particular, I felt compelled to throw my two cents into the bottomless well anyway.    Progressive rock band Yes, formed in 1968, endured many lineup changes by 1980, when Drama was released. Bassist Chris Squire was the sole original member, and with him were Yes veterans guitarist Steve Howe and drummer Alan White. Famously, this album also features the duo known as The Buggles, vocalist Trevor Horn and keyboardist Geoff Downes. Because of the (at the time) ludicrous notion that Yes were continuing without founding vocalist Jon Anderson, many fans wouldn't give Drama a second look. Many still don't, as a matter of fact. Yet this is my favorite Yes album.    Now, I should qualify this by stating that I don't believe Drama to be the best Yes album. Such a title is reserved for five-star releases such as 1972's Close To The Edge, or perhaps The Yes Album from 1971 (some would argue Fragile, but I disagree). But it turns out the lineup change associated with this album was crucial. 1980 saw a changing landscape in the music world. New wave bands were all the rage, and progressive rock was supposedly dead (it wasn't, yet, but more on that later). Yes' previous album, 1978's Tormato, had some good moments, but it was clear that the members were out of modern musical ideas, and clearly out of their element trying to stay relevant- kind of like your best friend's dad trying to act \\"hip\\" in front of you and the other kids. It was kind of embarrassing.    With the arrival of Horn and Downes came Yes' new wave credibility. Horn in particular had an ear for modern songwriting and production that the Anderson-led Yes just didn't have in the late-'70s. It also helped that prior to joining he was a big fan of the band; I will argue any day of the week that Drama is the strongest technical performance of the trio of Squire, Howe, and White, and I believe this to be due to a new influence (Horn) pushing them. Squire's bass lines are back to being assertive and memorable. Howe's guitar work is all over this album, the most it's been since his first foray into Yes world, on The Yes Album. And White gets pushed way forward in the mix, and honestly he's never sounded better; for the first time, you really get to appreciate how nuanced of a drummer he is (something that was dumbed down again with 1983's 90125). My favorite elements of Yes returned with this album; compare the intro to \\"Tempus Fugit\\" with \\"Yours Is No Disgrace.\\" Compare Squire's springy bass lines on \\"Does It Really Happen?\\" with \\"Roundabout.\\" Compare White's ferocious drumming on \\"Machine Messiah\\" with \\"Sound Chaser\\"- just a few examples. Perhaps it is sacrilege to compare such Yes classics with songs off of an album such as Drama. But clearly, this band is still Yes.    So what about the new guys? I'm not going to pretend Downes is like Rick Wakeman. Downes is more textural, like original keyboardist Tony Kaye. The sound of his synths, while perhaps dated today, were cutting edge in 1980, and it made Yes sound modern again. New singer Horn has a lower vocal range than the departing Anderson, and I'm not going to pretend he was a complete replacement, either. But while Anderson was breathy and playful in his singing, letting the melody carry his power, Horn is a lot harsher of a singer. With a bit of imagination, he sounds like Anderson singing a key lower and pushing his diaphragm hard. With Squire's vocal harmony, it helps the whole thing feel like Yes.    The early '80s, strangely enough, is my favorite era of progressive rock. It was the era of '70s technical ability meeting with 80's production sensibilities, meaning the talent and discipline of the musicians were harnessed and refined to their maximum potential. Some prefer the more free-form and/or psychedelic style of firstwave prog, and some like the neo-prog that first emerged with bands like Marillion and Pallas in the mid-to-late '80s. For me, it is albums like Drama, Rush's Moving Pictures, King Crimson's Discipline, and Saga's Worlds Apart that are my favorite: new wave-inspired prog. I will never try to change the mind of someone adamantly opposed to accepting Drama as a good Yes album (a bit like trying to persuade someone to change their political party, it seems), but as someone who owns every Yes album, from the self titled first release all the way to 2011's Fly From Here [Edit 10/27/14: and 2014's Heaven And Earth], and all the live albums (and enjoys them all), let me urge you to at least give this one a chance if you haven't yet. It just may grow on you. 4 stars    Remaster notes: in 2004, Drama was remastered with bonus tracks. These included single edits, studio demos and run-throughs, and demos from the aborted sessions for the original Anderson-fronted successor to Tormato. The single edit of \\"Into The Lens\\" is pretty uninteresting, as it's just a shorter version of the album cut. However, \\"Run Through The Light\\" is presented in an alternate mix, and the rearrangement of the instruments is interesting, but perhaps not essential for one's collection. The incomplete studio tracks sound just that: incomplete. But for relatively completed versions of these songs, check out \\"Go Through This\\" on the Yes box set The Word Is Live, or search \\"xyz telephone secrets\\" on YouTube. The studio run-throughs of \\"White Car\\" and \\"Tempus Fugit\\" are for the fanatic who wants to see how the songs developed. Finally, there are four songs that, in my opinion, are included only to show those who hate Drama how bad a new Yes album really would have been had Anderson and Wakeman stayed in the band. Included are liner notes and pictures in a jewel case (unlike the other Yes albums featuring Roger Dean album art, which are in digipaks). The remaster sounds great, I think it is worth getting ifyou are considering replacing and updating your collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Yes, we've all heard the complaits about how much The Huner Games is like the Japanese movie and novels, and how the concept is cliche, etc etc.  Honestly, what's wrong with taking an old idea, and turning it on its ear?  Mrs. Collins has created a new world, she hasn't just copied down an old one.  She introduced a familiar theme, and gave it a new flavor.  I applaud her for her creativity.  (I spelled applaud wrong, didn't  I?)  Now as for the book itself, I thought it was very well written.  The setting didn't just seem like a cardboard cutout, the characters came to life before my eyes, and the story was beautifully paced, which is something very few books can say.  The Hunger Games is a great book you will want to read again and again!
B001XVD2Z0|5.0|If you haven't seen the Matrix, you definitely need to do so. If you have, it's definitely worth another viewing. This movie blew my mind back when it came out, and it was great to watch it from the comfort of my own home with my girlfriend, who had never seems it.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This is the best angry bird game ever pricey thought on android market free and app store .99 but still I love it
B007N5YIUS|1.0|seriously.... I downloaded this because it supposed to be different then the other angry birds. Its not. Same game with wait for it.... gravity. The old games I found boring after a few minutes. This one I played 3 levels and uninstalled. More of the same garbage from the same company.

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and loved it. The blu ray of this movie is awesome too. THe third digital copy disc caught me offguard when i first saw it. I thought that I had gotten ripped off. But a quick search on the internet and found out that thats the way it is suppose to be.<br />Anyway back to the blu ray. If you have 5.1 speakers you are going to be thrilled with this movie. This movie is right up there with \\"Fight Club\\" at the top for audio. The visuals of this movie are also awesome.<br />If you like the movie I suggest that you buy this. You will not be disappointed.
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|I expected to like THE MUPPETS.  I did not expect to love it.  And yet, I do.  Family films are a hard sell for me, I'll admit this right off the bat.  The laughs usually come at the expense of intelligence, and the heartwarming ending is usually tacked on.  I prefer my movies gritty and bitter, and decidedly non-child-friendly.<br /><br />Leave it to the Muppets to break the rules and create a family film that is actually good.  It's a simple story rooted in the idol worship many of us feel towards our felt friends: young man Walter is a huge fan of the Muppets; in them, he sees everything he is meant to be.  But when Walter discovers that the Muppets are has-beens, and that an oil tycoon wants to tear it down to drill for oil (\\"There's oil under this theater; I can smell it, and more importantly, the geological survey says there definitely is\\"), he and his older brother Gary set out, along with Gary's reluctant fiancee, to reunite the Muppets and raise ten million dollars.  ....And cue the Muppet shenanigans!<br /><br />This is Jason Segal's love letter to his childhood.  His pure, unadulterated joy helps propel the film; matching him step-for-step is Amy Adams, who's done this sort of thing before.  Chris Cooper makes a delightful villain (and seeing the studious actor break into a rap song is just...well, it's just awesome), and the slew of celebrity cameos helps keep things interesting.  The real stars here, of course, are the Muppets themselves, and it's nice to see them in fine theatrical form, parodying their former fame while recapturing it perfectly via sight-gags, intricate and hilarious song numbers (\\"Man or Muppet\\" won a Best Song Oscar for a reason), and heaping helpings of nostalgia.<br /><br />Make no mistake though: for the young'uns, there's quite a bit of conventional humor; and for those of you who are older and maybe unfamiliar with the Muppets (you heathens), there are quite a few more adult-oriented jokes: meta-humor, quick gags, parodies of other films, an all-chicken rendition of Cee-Lo Green's \\"F*** You\\" (in a kids movie! Genius!).  The end result is a film that actually manages to equal more than the sum of its parts: it's a truly great family film, one that can be enjoyed by everyone from tots, to teens, to adults, to puppets.  Cue up THE MUPPETS, sit back, and prepare to spend the next hour and a half laughing your socks off.  And if you start to feel something warm growing around your heart?  Don't panic.  It's perfectly natural.ther films, an all-chicken rendition of Cee-Lo Green's \\"F*** You\\" (in a kids movie! Genius!).

B005DESVPO|5.0|I can't wait for the full length EP to drop later this year. I have a feeling Gary Clark Jr. is going to be heard from a lot more, and outside the blues music circle. Bright Lights Big City is an amazing blues rock song but the other more acoustic songs provide more depth than you'd expect from a 4 song EP. The last track, When My Train Comes In, sits at around 9 minutes and is one of the best songs I've heard in a while. Rock fans to blues fans to country fans will enjoy this album.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of fun. same games are better than others but def worth downloading. it is entertaining and very addictive. I would recommend it for a fun free game.
B005CAAVVQ|4.0|I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised at how much I like Trombone Shorty. While my music listening spans across jazz and blues to rock and indie/folk, I've at times stayed away for more instrumental albums. What gets my attention here is a musician who knows how to really construct a song, not just make something with a pop twist so it will get radio air play. Songs like Big 12 and Nervis are upbeat and exciting jazz tunes that showcase Trombone Shorty's skills as a musician while while songs like Mrs. Orleans and The Craziest Things add an element of rock and singable tunes to the album. It's a complete album providing exciting songs that mix and mash the jazz, blues and rock worlds in perfect harmony.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|GoT is exactly what fantasy should be: dark, gritty, sexy and fun. I'm not even a big fantasy fan, and I love it. Every storyline is engaging, with characters to cheer for, and characters you love to hate. I can't wait to see what they do in season two! You can tell they have very high production values, that they actually care about the sets and story. I would recommend it to fans of HBO's Rome and Lord of the Rings. Long live Peter Dinklage!
B004T0XYM8|3.0|Please describe (accurately) the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />First of all, the aspect ration is about 2.35:1, not 1.85:1 as listed in the product description.<br /><br />I thought the video quality was very good to great.  It was not perfect, because there appeared to be a very fine grain, but the grain is almost invisible.  However, this fine grain makes the movie unstable at times, with the fine grain having slight vibrations (mostly in the background).  Detail is very good.  I give it about 9.1 on a 10.0 scale.  I think the video quality is great for a movie this old.<br /><br />The movie has DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio sound, but I might as well have turned off my audio/video receiver, and just listened to it on my TV.  There was very little surround sound, little stereo separation (if any), and no sub-woofer bass.  There were parts of the movie that should have had strong surround sound, but there was none that I could hear.  I noticed sound coming from my surround speakers twice during the movie; once when someone was laying in a puddle, and the closing music.  During almost the entire movie, it sounded like all of the sound was coming from my front center speaker.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray has two versions; the Theatrical Version, and the Restored Version.  I watched the restored version.  I then skipped through the Theatrical version, and it looked only slightly inferior to the Restored version.  Both versions are 2.35:1, have DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio, and last about 2 hours and 45 minutes.  The video looked slightly better in the Restored version.<br /><br />I didn't think much of this western.  Compared to some westerns, it was boring.  It was a well made movie though.

It makes me a sad bird and then just as disgruntled as these avian friends of mine :'( If they could make the free Kindle fire version OR make the regular version work on the kindle I'd dig it more because I could play it on my own instead of having to steal my boyfriend cell phone [ Nexus One ] to play a tiny bit!<br /><br />Good news: It's still the same game, with the same funny stories but new obstacles to overcome! As with any game it can become a bit repetitive when you have more than one version and it's the same basic idea (think Mario Bros.) But they've managed to still keep the same Idea behind the hit game and add in the trouble of GRAVITY O.O<br /><br />I was sooooo lost my first 3 minutes playing hahaha! Not because I couldn't grasp the concept but because getting the hang of the way the birds get flung now is a bit different! Because you're stationed now on a separate PLANET you have to keep in mind the gravitational pull of the planet that the Pigs are on *Hint, sometimes flinging a bird backwards on accident isn't so bad... hehe)<br /><br />IN A NUT SHELL:<br />- Still fun for anyone.<br />- Will get a little getting used to and then you'll be back to your old bird flinging self,<br />- Any age can enjoy it as long as they can handle an electronic device without using it to teeth or making it go swimming O.O Use your discretion parental units!<br />- I would love a free version for the kindle fire, I don't see why we can't have a free version full of ads just like everyone else :'(<br /><br />side note: Check out their story on youtube if it didn't unlock automatically, I was trying to find the little mini movie in the beginning and couldn't!! my boyfriend finally looked it up on youtube, I think he also unlocked it (or just found it) in his game lol, but it's too funny! haha =]
B0073LWEXK|1.0|i think that game is the badest i have ever played, because you only can switch some pictures and that is very boring. :-(
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This Book is something else!<br /><br />The series came out a while ago, and I had never really thought much about it because I was off being busy and pretending to have a life. and then for Christmas last year, I found myself with a lot more time on my hands and a new Kindle Fire courtesy of my boyfriend :) And with my Prime membership I made sure I borrowed this book.<br /><br />I DON'T REGRET IT AT ALL! I finished it in 4 nights (still have stuff to do in the daytime! hehe!) But it is extremely easy to read and has a great flow! My one warning would be that you have to find a way to pull yourself away at times, because once the story gets going IT GETS GOING! okay I'm saying a lot about nothing so here goes:<br /><br />The story starts off with background info on Katniss and her life in the Seam. Her friends, family and life in a nutshell. It also gives background info on Panem, the Districts, the reaping and briefly the hunger games. this is the part of the book that is kind of boring (if you're not very detail oriented)and people tend to get impatient with. But that phase doesn't last too long, And by the time you get to the reaping you're already too deeply involved to kind of just stop.<br /><br />The story plays with the ideas of war, and government, loyalty and survival. It is FULL of action, AMAZING types of action! things that may seem simple but catch your attention and leave a lasting impression. (you know when you watch a movie and all of a sudden you think you can karate chop something without breaking your hand? yeah that type of effect! hehe)<br /><br />The arena scenes had me biting my nails, scratching my head and crying my eyes out! By the time the reader gets to the end of the story they're dying to know what's going to happen in book two! I don't want to give away too much so i wont go into details here. and that will probably make this review KIND of awkward to read o.o (sorry)<br /><br />IN A NUT SHELL:<br /><br />-Good for girls and boys. (Ieven read it with my boyfriend who usually isn't much of the reading type! haha)<br />-Age can be anywhere from 11 ish and up (I know at 10 yrs old I wasn't really into this type of stuff as a girl, but now in the age of Harry Potter and Gossip Girl, I'm kind of confused as to what they read, * bottom line is that it's appropriate for young readers although there is a lot of violence O.O (like war type of violence is what is mostly expected) and you know what your child likes to read. Although if they don't like it, i would keep it anyways and read it myself! hehe)<br />- Action, Adventure, miniscule amount of romance but enough to satisfy that need (hehe), it will keep you wanting more! :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Got this series because all the other reviews were so positive and I have to say, I greatly enjoyed it myself.  Like Game of Thrones, the author isn't afraid to kill off characters you grow to love which adds a refreshing level of unpredictability to the story.  Overall, very entertaining and highly reccomended.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I played the free version of this on my phone for about 10 minutes then realized I had to get a larger one to properly enjoy the physics. It was totally worth it.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'd say the physics is \\"accurate,\\" but it's still pretty darn cool. 2-D gravity with multiple, even overlapping, gravity wells makes for some great game dynamics. Add in the new bird and tweaks to some of the old ones, and this is a great follow up to a great game.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|ad more levels beat whole thing in hour and a half okay just ad a upgrade and that will be awesome.
B005K17RU0|2.0|This is a nice app, but it consistently froze and crashed my Kindle Fire.  Hopefully it will be stabalized soon.
B0063IH60K|5.0|gives me everything I wanted out of solitaire. smooth play, good variety of scoringg. I don't kind the little adds at the beginning of the hand, but why does it have to play a loud commercial once in a while.
B002BSHWUU|2.0|I normally don't care much about packaging for this sort of item, but for this set, it really makes a difference, and unfortunately, a negative one. The discs are held in paper sleeves. This might be okay, but these sleeves react with the discs and they stick together pretty badly. The discs can often only be removed by using your fingers to separate them from the stuck on paper. The labeling on the picture side of the discs gets damaged from sticking to the paper.<br /><br />I can only recommend this set if yoga re planning on putting the discs in your own CD cases. Otherwise, you may be annoyed every time you try to remove a disc from a sleeve.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|have been playing this game for a couple of hours, and am loving it.  I'm far more left-brained than right, and this is great exercise for the right side!  the hints are great, when you need them, but more often than not you can just keep trying different logical options until it works.  i can well imagine playing this game often, and getting lost in the rythym.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote 11 Mars books and I have read them all.  I passed my love of these books on to my son.  We both have the complete collection.  We both went to see John Carter of Mars.  We both loved it.  I plan to buy two copies of the dvd (one for each of us).  To the reviewers who trashed the movie I say \\"Peeshaw!\\"  You can bet your bottom dollar that none of them had read the books.  Its getting to the point that if the reviewers trash the film I check it out.  They seem to be often out of touch with the people who go to films!  I have seen countless films they they trashed and I loved.  The film was true to the stories written by Burroughs.  The solar and hydrogen powered airships which are common in his stories were a wonder to behold.  The green men of Mars and the great white apes of Mars were just as described in his books.  Everyone I have talked to who has seen the film liked it!  I hope they do more John Carter films because I will go see them and I will buy the dvds.  Yeah for Disney and boo to the reviewers who panned it!
B003Y5H5HY|1.0|Ultra Violet? Never heard of it so I gave it a try and i never want to hear about it again. It took me 15 minutes to set up an account with their website. Not because of user error, but because of the website. It is difficult, confusing and slow. Stay away, just buy it off iTunes, its quicker.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Nice twist on a classic game. Plays well, nice fell to it and good looking too. This is a relaxing time killer.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|This is about as close as you can get to using a computer. I also have a FragFX that worked well for what it is, but I definitely prefer this set-up. It does take some time putting in all of the settings, but it is worth it in the end.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|best app ever but you need to know I think there needs to be a update sone.I love ice birds.
0553386794|5.0|I tore through this book in only 2 weeks after watching season 1 of Game of Thrones.<br /><br />The tv series literally is a clone of the book, with very few differences that admittedly were better done in the show.<br /><br />This book is hands down the best fantasy read I ever had. The Lord of the Rings is utterly boring and is the WORST fantasy book to begin with. I'm glad that Game of Thrones is now mainstream and young people will read this book, since it is so beautifully written.<br /><br />Bottom line is that reading this book is just as entertaining and fast paced as watching it. There really are extremely few books out there that can do that. Book 1 grips you and does not let go.<br /><br />I am currently on the second book and fighting with myself not to keep reading, since the season 2 is coming out next month!
B005UDD1R6|5.0|great media player! exactly what I was looking for!! easy to use and very User friendly. finds all your media and allows you east access to play / view all media files
B005974C94|5.0|This was my requested Christmas present and I certainly wasn't disappointed.  Marsalis and Clapton were incredible.  The video is very intimate and one almost felt like in an intimate venue watching them live.  Music was great!
1401937519|5.0|This book was both outstanding and uplifting.<br /><br />Never have I read a book with a more compelling story.<br /><br />I came away more positive about life than ever before.<br /><br />Ann
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Loaded up on phone just fine, gravity adds new twist to the genre. Up to level 12 in short time playing &amp; has been fun. Nice fun app
B007MNV5WU|5.0|good I have it on my I phone but I want it on my kindlefire for free ok and I am 14
B007MNV5WU|4.0|when will the free version of angry birds space be released? my friends have this game, and i want it!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I was eagerly awaiting the release of Angry Birds Space and it did not disappoint.  This version is a new take on the game.  Working with the effects of gravity and orbits around planets/moons takes this game to a whole new level.  The graphics are great too!<br />I wished I could have gotten it for .99 for my Kindle Fire, but $2.99 is still not bad.  I didn't take the review down a star for this because I wanted to review this game based on play and not on cost.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|my most favorite game in the hole wide world......but the money part just ignore......if you think this is a correct,mature,review start your review with hi.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game has become an addiction for the entire family.  There are games to please everyone and we have enjoyed the challenge of unlocking new games.  It's fun for all ages.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|It worked well on my kindle fire at first... then has to force close and I can't even play!!!!!  This would be a great game if it worked!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|i share this opinion awesome cool and epic it is fun and it has some holidays to and it has some seasons
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Really, people?  You resent paying $2.99 for something that will give you hours of enjoyment?  How self-entitled are you?<br /><br />Great game....love it when games allow you to go back and improve your scores...not just end what you have available to do.<br /><br />I'd been looking forward to this version....it was definitely worth the wait.
1600597963|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book and have used it for new beadwork projects.  It contains some great new techniques.  I highly recommend it to bead embroiderers.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Awesome physics. Challenging levels. Cool powers for the birds. Best version since the original. Now all we need is an online. multi-player version.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|This album is one I've listened to over and over again and continue to enjoy. I'm so impressed with the many layers of creativity - classic and modern rock overlaid with gothic themes and traditional instruments like drums and harps. The songs seem as structured as a symphony but with a completely different feel, not to mention compelling, if sometimes disturbing, lyrics. The music defies a particular genre and I've received positive responses to the album from many different people. Definitely worth purchasing!
0740748475|5.0|I owned all the books but had to leave them behind when I moved.  I knew that I would love the strips, and wanted to be able to read them again, but this book went above and beyond.  The quality of the paper and printing is incredible, and the forward by Bill Waterson alone makes this version worth owning.  If you like Calvin and Hobbes you need to buy this book, and if you don't; What is wrong with you? Go read the strips, admit your mistakes, and make up for it by buying this set.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love this game. Great game play, nice graphics, nice bgm, and a little Nasa video to boot. The space physics are a nice touch and a big thanks to the developers for making the aiming a little easier.
B0041T4ML4|3.0|i finished this novel almost reluctantly.  It was well enough written, and I suppose the \\"twists\\" were well constructed, but I never really found myself that interested in any of the characters.  I never thought i would mention this about a book, but none of the characters were even the least bit sympathetic.  the lurid descriptions of the treatment of the windup girl her/it-self seem almost like a bizarre form of fan-service, without really giving the character any depth.<br /><br />There also seemed to be a lot left unsaid about the backstory that might have been more interesting than the story itself as presented: the history of the \\"contraction\\" (referenced liberally throughout the book without much explanation), more about the calorie companies and the global geopolitics (india, burma, and finland are all mentioned without much explanation), more of the history of thailand itself (the only focus seemed to be on an abbreviated history of the city itself; only later do you find out that the setting is still a nation and more than just a city-state as in ancient greece), the character of gibbons is fully unexplored (trying to set up for a sequel?), and so on.<br /><br />i don't really know if i can recommend this book.  the concept is there, but the things that could make it great are just left lacking.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|How about the update to version 1.1.0 for the people that have already purchased Angry Birds Space? Haven't seen it yet. We're waiting.
1612130283|1.0|This book was not worth the time and money.  Also there are two others to top it off.  I just kept saying to myself during the book \\"run\\"!  It was not entertaining and I felt like it was a waste of my time reading it.
B000001DQI|5.0|Classic. I recommend the product and seller. Delivery, price and quality were as good and or better than walk-in store and much more convenient.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|Why can I get free version from Amazon app store on phone but not Kindle? I figured it would be on my cloud storage on my fire when I got it on my phone but it wasn't.. :/ I want the free version for my Kindle so I can actually see the game!!! Not cool Amazon.. not cool! :/
B0054JZC6E|5.0|We have only had this for a day, but my kids and I are addicted and play it constantly.  We cant keep our battery charged.
B002ZG97M4|2.0|I guess this is what progress is, no more character, no more talent. If they're going to destroy movies like Footloose, why don't they just make their own movie and call it something else. I remember a time not too long ago when they remade songs and movies and many times they were better than the original, not anymore.<br />  Every part of this movie was mediocre at best, including the music, acting, dialogue, filming, directing and producing. This is a good example of what happens when you let your children grow up with no guidance, let them be who they are and try not to influence them as they grow up. We now live in a time where the young have no talent and no character, they are just a bunch of sheep with no common sense. They really should have have thrown in a few gays and lesbians so it could have totally fit the cookie cutter mold.<br />  This movie is just another movie that I would call \\"Fill\\", Something that's there to fill in the gaps between the good movies, which are few and far between these days.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I love Sandra Bullock in most of her movies and this one is special to me.<br /><br />Time travel intrigues me.  It is fascinating to see how the characters figure out what is going on and act on it.<br /><br />This is a movie I can watch over and over.
145162445X|3.0|Physicists have an extremely annoying habit of telling us they've solved a big question and, aside from a bit of mopping up of minor details, we can all rest easy knowing they've figured it all out. That is until the next big wave hits shore and they go running to embrace the new idea almost as fast as they toss aside the old one. Following this fine tradition, Lawrence Krauss confidently closes the book on perhaps the biggest question of all: Where did the universe come from? If you wish to believe his explanation (like the fawning Richard Dawkins, a scientist and writer I greatly admire...), you only need to accept Krauss's claims that: (1) nothing isn't really nothing (see the many other reviews on how Krauss redefines \\"nothing\\"); (2) it all hinges on the concept of \\"dark energy\\", something for which Krauss admits we have no direct evidence and in fact no one has the slightest clue as to what it is or might be.<br /><br />I surely agree that any supernatural explanation of the origin of the universe is completely unsatisfying, perhaps even intellectually dishonest, because it provides as an explanation something - let's call it \\"god\\" - that is even more complicated and even more unexplainable than the phenomena for which it is being offered as the explanation. But Krauss and his physicists buddies are very nearly doing the same thing: they are apparently satisfied with an explanation of the universe that relies on something they can't explain: dark energy.<br /><br />Perhaps these two opposing schools of thought can agree to equate \\"dark energy\\" with \\"god\\", and vice versa of course, and then they'll both be happy and can kindly leave the rest of us alone.
1427207267|5.0|Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? is an excellent book for younger readers.  This set is a great value!  The CD has one track read by Gwyneth Paltrow, one track with page turning notification to read along, a Spanish read track, & one track read by Bill Martin Jr. (the author).  This will make a great addition to my classroom!
B005SH5K7I|5.0|ANOTHER GREAT COMEDY BY KEVIN JAMES.  SUPER FUNNY.  WOULD RECOMMEND BUYING THIS MOVIE AS WELL AS GROWN UPS.

B003E6K1VK|2.0|Pros: The sound quality improvement is majorly noticeable using a 3year old sansa fuze that has a terrible amp in it.  The bass response is insane using a pair of Skullcandy Ink'd earbuds, that already have plenty of bass without using this amplifier.<br /><br />Cons: You would think that with this being $84.50, that the sellers would make sure that they are actually selling a fully operational unit. The unit that I received from Mp4nation.net, had a defect that you are forced to push the plug in a lot harder in one of the output jacks than the other, and if you let go of it, your headphones loose connection and no longer sound good.  One of the main reasons why I bought this product was because of the featured, built-in headphone splitter that I was left without do to the defect!<br /><br />Other Thoughts: Mp4nation has officially lost my faith in their products as a whole because of this single order.  The way that it went, was that the day that I bought the item, they happened to sell out and had no indication of this on their website, which really pissed me off when I found out.  So by the time that it was shipped out from their location in China, and the thing got to my house, IT HAD BEEN AN ENTIRE MONTH SINCE MY ORDER THAT I THOUGHT WAS GOING TO BE AT MY HOUSE IN A FEW DAYS!  Actually before I found out that they sold out the day that I purchased the item, They actually told me that they already shipped out the unit and it was en route. So I waited a few days and noticed that the information hadn't changed, so I talked with one of their supervisors and found out that they had sold out of the units the day that I ordered one.  So I tried to ask if they would give me faster shipping and all they told me was \\"YOU CAN ALWAYS CANCEL YOUR ORDER\\" and did absolutely nothing to fix their screw-up.  So I finally decide to leave it alone, and wait for the unit to show up and this is when I found out that they sent me a defective unit.  This will absolutely be the last time I buy from mp4nation...It's just too much stress that I don't need!
0439023491|5.0|This book had me guessing from beginning to end! Many of the plot lines necessary to the series are introduced in this book, and I believe Collins does a great job of using the \\"middle book\\" to tie the series together. The characters develop more fully, and you get an even greater feeling that you are a part of the Panem world.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|This is a novel about time travel and its effects: the chance to change history by stopping President Kennedy's assassination in Dallas on 22 November 1963.  What could the consequences possibly be?<br /><br />In this novel, Jacob Epping (better known as Jake) is an English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine.  He is led to the time portal by Al Templeton, a local diner owner, whose pantry contains the portal.  Al explains the process: how a few short steps through the portal take a person back to Lisbon Falls as it existed at 11.58 am on September 9, 1958.  It doesn't matter how long you stay, Al tells Jake, when you return to 2011 you will have only been gone from this world for two minutes.  Al wants Jake to stop the bullet that kills President Kennedy.  Al would do it himself, except he is terminally ill and doesn't have enough time.<br /><br />Jake is unsure of his capacity to change the past and after a first visit to familiarise himself with Lisbon Falls in 1958, he elects to deal with Frank Dunning, the father of his high school janitor Harry, who killed most members of his family on Halloween in 1958.  Not all consequences of this change are positive, as Jake discovers when he returns to 2011.  But, armed with Al's notes, he returns to 1958 to find out whether Lee Harvey Oswald is responsible for President Kennedy's assassination and, if he is, to make sure that Lee Harvey Oswald fails and President Kennedy lives.<br /><br />For the next five years, Jake Epping becomes George Amberson, spends time teaching and falling in love, and researching Lee Harvey Oswald.  Does Jake succeed in his quest, and what are the consequences?  What impact could changing events in 1963 have on 2011? What will be the `butterfly effect'?  Will Jake be able to find his way back to 2011, and will he want to?  Jake might be the central character in this novel, but the one that remains with me is Sadie Dunhill, the woman he falls in love with.<br /><br />`The past is obdurate.'<br /><br />This novel is over 700 pages long, and it held my attention for the three days it took me to read it.  It's unbelievable, right, but Stephen King made enough of it seem plausible to have me wondering.  About cause and effect, about change and consequence.  If every incident in history alters the face of the world, what would the world look like if President Kennedy hadn't been assassinated in 1963?  Suppose that we can change history, should we?<br /><br />Not all aspects of the novel worked for me, but I was mightily entertained.  And reminded that there are about 40 other Stephen King novels that I've not yet read.<br /><br />`History repeats is another way of saying the past harmonizes.'<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith/>This novel is over 700 pages long, and it held my attention for the three days it took me to read it.

0525478817|5.0|My 15 yr old daughter asked for this book: she read it, then I did. It's amazing in so many ways--there are surprises and many touching and profound moments offered. At the same time, however, it's an easy read and very entertaining.<br /><br />If you ever listened to the author speak (search John Green on youtube for his Crash Course in World History), you'll understand the wealth of information you'll be delving into -- I'm not talking the subject matter, but rather the depth and breadth of knowledge, and the true voice in which he writes.<br /><br />Highly recommended, and I have since bought other books by the same author.
B003O86FMW|5.0|fantastic book that kept me in suspense the entire time. great intro into Mockingjay :) i will be reading again as soon as I finish the first one over.

B004Y6MU6S|3.0|Look, all I see in the reviews pages are ecstatic reviews saying how WoK has it all, and WoK is the best fantasy book ever. Well it's not. Some of this might be hard to take for you Sanderson fans, and who knows, maybe when I'm done the book I'll come back to add a star...<br /><br />This review is long, but it stands on some logical ground, and has no spoilers!<br />Read on. Comment, Like or Dislike, I appreciate your criticisms.<br /><br />First up, about me: I am well-versed in fantasy, (Tolkien, Martin, Jordan, Lewis, Sanderson, Durham, Novik, Paolini, Peake, Le Guin...) so I know what I'm talking about!<br /><br />1. Transparent Prose--Good or bad?<br /><br />First off: here's some transparent prose from the beginning of WoK:<br /><br />'The stone ridges and mounds bore numerous scars. Some were shattered, blasted-out where Surgebinders had fought. Less frequently, he passed cracked, oddly shaped hollows where thunderclasts had ripped themselves free of the stone to join the fray.<br />Many of the bodies around him were human; many were not.<br />Blood mixed. Red. Orange. Violet. Though none of the bodies around him stirred, an indistinct haze of sounds hung in the air. Moans of pain, cries of grief. They did not seem like the cries of victory.'<br /><br />Before I analyze this let's hear some non-transparent prose about a Tyrannosaur.<br /><br />'It came on great oiled, resilient, striding legs. It towered thirty feet above half of the trees, a great evil god, folding its delicate watchmaker's claws close to its oily reptilian chest. Each lower leg was a piston, a thousand pounds of white bone, sunk in thick ropes of muscle, sheathed over in a gleam of pebbled skin like the mail of a terrible warrior. Each thigh was a ton of meat, ivory, and steel mesh. And from the great breathing cage of the upper body those two delicate arms dangled out front, arms with hands which might pick up and examine men like toys, while the snake neck coiled. And the head itself, a ton of sculptured stone, lifted easily upon the sky. Its mouth gaped, exposing a fence of teeth like daggers. Its eyes rolled, ostrich eggs, empty of all expression save hunger. It closed its mouth in a death grin. It ran, its pelvic bones crushing aside trees and bushes, its taloned feet clawing damp earth, leaving prints six inches deep wherever it settled its weight.'<br /><br />Alright, so now that you've heard both types of writing, let's examine them more closely.<br />Transparent Prose:<br />Adjective and Description count: 10+<br />Average Words in Sentence: 7.81<br /><br />Non-Transparent Prose:<br />Adjective and Description count: 35+<br />Average Words in Sentence: 17.9<br /><br />So, from these statistics we can see that authors like Sanderson who write \\"transparent prose\\" like to keep their sentences short `n snappy, and their adjectives and descriptions to a minimum to let the characters and plot shine through.<br /><br />Authors like Ray Bradbury (who wrote the paragraph with the dinosaur) like to use descriptive adjectives to paint a picture of what they're writing about in your mind's eye. The sentences are longer and filled with more information and lots of commas.<br /><br />Now, some would argue (me included) that the second paragraph is the more beautiful of the two. After all, it uses more figurative language, more descriptive similes and metaphors and adjectives.<br />Surely however, it's easier to read the first of the two paragraphs as it doesn't need to be \\"savored\\" like this next excerpt does:<br /><br />\\"The thousand arms of the forest were grey, and its million fingers silver.

B004LWZW8S|1.0|Worst movie. I could not have been more bored with this trite attempt at re-duxing a new 300. It was trying to be way too \\"artsy\\" in the graphics department without a fully developed and intelligible script. Mickey Rourke's performance was sub par and a sad attempt at furthering his some what lack lustre \\"acting\\" career. The editing was horrendous... a plot that really goes no where \\"exciting\\", lack lustre \\"Gods\\"... without reiterating what I have already said... don't bother with this film it is boring, inane and you wish that you hadn't have sat through it.

B00466HN6S|3.0|Hop has Russell Brand as the voice of  E.B. the son of the Easter Bunny (Hugh Laurie) who's supposed to inherit the job but he just wants to be a drummer. So he runs off to Hollywood where he meets a deadbeat played by James Marsden who has no goals or ambition. But together they'll find out what they are meant to do.<br />  That's not all but if I give away more, that's the whole movie pretty much. The movie feels a little rushed and half the time Marsden doesn't seem to even be looking in the direction of the CGI bunny. I know it's silly to say, but Matthew Lillard at least managed to some how have chemistry with the CGI Scooby Doo in those films. I like Marsden but he feels a bit awkward in Hop. While, am not sure what they were thinking by having the bunny poop jelly beans in a family film. It's nice to get an Easter film, but Hop didn't really leave me with much, the end is kind of silly actually.
1565845072|5.0|Winner of the 2001 Crime Writer's Association Gold Dagger Award, \\"Sidetracked\\" features inspector Kurt Wallander returning for the sixth time in Henning Mankell's  Swedish  noir police procedural series.  Although you will know the killer's identity much earlier than Wallander,  you will still be in suspense while the investigation unfolds and the police are finally able to piece the clues together.<br /><br />One thing Wallander does know is that he is dealing with a serial killer. Before the first murder, an unidentified young girl douses herself with gasoline in a farmer's field and sets herself on fire right in front of Wallander's eyes. Then, a former minister of justice is found killed by an axe. What's unusual is that he has been scalped.  When a  second victim is found murdered in the same manner, the search for a serial killer begins.<br /><br />One of the best things about this series is how Wallander is portrayed as a real person. He makes mistakes, shows poor judgment and has to take time off to handle his own and his father's health problems. Throughout the book, he also has to deal with a major personal conflict that gets more and more urgent. His lover, Baiba Liepa, who lives in Latvia, is expecting him to show up for a vacation in Copenhagen.  Wallander can't bring himself to call her to let her know that their meeting may have to be postponed.  As he works feverishly to solve the case so he can take his vacation, the tension builds as the killer gets the upper hand. Highly recommended.

0763655465|5.0|This is such an entertaining little story. I'm an elementary school counselor and read this to our younger students about doing the right thing when adults aren't looking. When George's owner leaves the house, he promises, \\"I'll be good!\\" But try as he might, he gets himself in all kinds of trouble because he doesn't use that good ol' self control. When I teach kids this important school it's really important to me that I use engaging fun books. This is just that!
1400052181|5.0|I went into this book looking to learn more about the HeLa cell line, but expecting to be irritated by the \\"human-interest\\" and political aspects of this book.<br /><br />Instead, while I did learn scads about HeLa and the study of cells, I was unexpectedly touched by the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family. It was addressed in a very factual way, that really made these people into *real people* for me, not just a sob-story that the author wanted to push. The political aspects were also very fascinating and again, addressed mostly objectively.

1451683405|4.0|Riddle me this, gentle readers:  Why am \\"I\\" writing to recommend this book when I disagree with the author and furthermore do not believe that \\"you\\" or \\"I\\" even exist in the way that is commonly publicly presumed?  Are you my imaginary friend?  Perhaps I am one of those dreaded \\"charlatan\\" Compatiblists the author will warn you about?<br /><br />Maybe the truth won't set you free, but it can be useful.  Free will is akin to intelligence.  Some folks may worry that passing the Turing test won't really make \\"those\\" computing \\"machines\\" \\"human\\" like \\"us\\".  (Perhaps they need to ponder that we perhaps are not human like us either?)<br /><br />Magic looks different to the audience than it does to the well-practiced magician, and that is by design.  It's a matter of what you know that colors your explanation for what's happening.<br /><br />Your aunt may not understand how engineers made her Prius hybrid work, but that usually does not prevent her from driving it to her hairdressing appointment on time.<br /><br />Yes, the defendant may jump up to state before his sentencing that he has no free will and expect the judge to let him go, but the judge replies that he has no free will either and then sentences him to hang by the neck until dead.<br /><br />We may indeed lack free will, but we might be intelligent and even (shocker) to some extent rational, if only a tad.  The value of your model depends on how well it enables you to accurately predict whatever will happen, whether you know how your \\"magic\\" eight ball works or not.<br /><br />Does the thing work?  Do you feel lucky, punk?  If you think you are free, please read the book.  (If you are unfree, you must read the book.  I said so.)<br /><br />The book should be read, because the author is curious enough to want to look under the hood and stare (if ominously) at all those wires his aunt never told him about.  Only with Wizard of Oz would tell you pay no attention to that man behind the screen.  (Just don't let Adam's ignorance convince you \\"nothing\\" lies beyond your blue horizon or somewhere over the rainbow.)<br /><br />Being exposed to the author's arguments can possibly bring you more good than memorizing the answer to how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.  Please keep in mind that figures don't lie, but liars can figure, and even make mistakes.<br /><br />It's like that great philosopher Bob McKenzie asks us all in Strange Brew: Are you a good mutant or a bad mutant?  (Any movie with Max von Sydow is worth watching.  You can't argue with Ingmar Bergman, or can you?)<br /><br />Who needs free will?  How about a nice game of chess?
0345349571|5.0|As a dilettantish fan of the middle ages, this will retain a favorite spot as an enjoyable, context-giving opus. Tuchman's broad perspectives, clear communication skills, and framing of her subject matter are quite good. Her nuanced use of appropriate detail give richness to her subject matter. She often clarifies matters that in other works go unexplained and that remain sources of obscure mystery.  Of course, she is simply pleasant to read; she tells a good yarn. Her ability to do so is necessarily somewhat limited in this instance, because of the flaws, gaps, and contradictions in her source material, which she explains up-front (her explanation is one of the most enlightening parts of the book). Given the reality of the piecemeal documents of the age, she has done future generations a great service by applying her very clever mind to a most compelling subject.
4883191028|5.0|I think the reason some people seem to be frustrated with Minna No Nihongo is because it's all in Japanese. If you're just starting out and you haven't learned Hiragana and Katakana, you're going to have some problems. Get those down (If you put yourself into it, it'll take two to three weeks to do so), buy the translation book, and you'll find yourself learning at a much faster rate than if you had a book using romaji (Japanese spelled out using ABCs).<br /><br />Having taught English to people from all over the world for 8 years, and having studied Japanese intensively for a year, I can tell you the best way to learn a language is by immersing yourself in it as much as possible. It won't be easy, but it's better for you in the long run. Let go of the English, embrace the Japanese. Ohhhmmmmmm!
0451191153|2.0|I have no qualms with the content of the book.  That said, I have had Lasik Surgery and have 20/20 vision (actually, a little better) and I cannot read this edition for more than 10 minutes. The print is tiny. I mean *tiny*. I may have to buy another edition. Cheers!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Wow - I just finished all 3 books...and as a whole the series is AMAZING! I love the wonderful characters she's created - the brutal world they live in and the complexity of their relationships. I just expected something else from the finale. I'm still processing the whole thing - so maybe I just need a few days to digest and possibly re-read the last half of the book. But right now, I feel such loss. ***SPOILER ALERT*** I'm angry that they lost so many people on that insane last ditch run to get to Snow...and then they failed. So, it was all in vain. I'm pissed at how Katniss \\"decided\\" on Peeta rather than Gale. What was that? I know that the romance was not at the forefront of any of the books - at least not for Katniss...but Peeta deserved more than just being the winner by default. And if they are going to end up together...I wish she's spent another chapter to really show us that they're going to be okay (as a couple and as individuals). Maybe they won't be..and that was the point? I felt like it was rushed though. I was really upset that her mom left her again - she's been through so much and she's only 17 - how could any mother leave her alone after that? And having Prim killed (possibly, but probably) by a bomb that Gale helped designed really killed 2 relationships at once. And even that scene was rushed. After so much bloodshed and carnage I became a bit desensitized to it...I had to re-read the paragraph to be sure it was Prim and should be meaningful. This book was tough to read - I didn't expect a fairy tale ending - but it was hard to see our heroine so hollow and emtpy. And to have Peeta, with his goodness and life - essentially stripped of his. And even her relationship with Gale was barely there. But maybe that's the author's point - in that type of war situation, this is what happens. There's no time or desire for \\"normal\\" relationships/conversation. No one knits, or reads, or kicks a ball...all normal life stops. Regardless, it was a tough read and I don't feel closure. Like I said before, maybe I'll re-read it and see if that makes a difference.

B005FLX1HS|3.0|I listen to a lot of electronic music and like to try things by new acts. That's how I discovered Matthew Dear and deadmau5 and I've very much enjoyed their music. In reading some material, I noticed Joel Zimmerman's name (aka, deadmau6) mentioned along with Skrillex so I had to try his music. I bought \\"Scary Monsters and Nice Spirits.\\" I had mixed feelings about the CD. He showed promise as a composer, but the recording was just a hodge-podge. Well, I liked it enough that I bought his latest CD \\"Bangarang.\\" My feelings are much the same. Here and there Skrillex shows real promise. Then comes a mixture of awful sounds that just ruins the composition. What a disappointment. This guy could write some genuinely beautiful music, if someone would just take all his strange electronic gadgets away from him. Just because he can produce a plethora of weird sounds doesn't mean that he has to.<br /><br />Alas, Skrillex has caught major attention very early in his career and this is both good and bad. One, I'm happy for his success. But two, much attention brings much pressure to produce and I don't think he's ready. He needs to be cloistered away somewhere and work on a really refined CD masterpiece, such as several produced by dreadmau5 (\\"Random Album Title\\" and \\"For Lack of a Better Name\\" come to mind). I think he's wasting his creative energies on these little EP quickies.They're partly good, however. Just look at the enthusiastic responses in the reviews. What could he do with a masterpiece CD?<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B000IEPFCG|5.0|I still bought this after reading various reviews of how the hollow stainless steel band looked and felt cheap.  So I was ready to buy a different strap but now having it on for two days I have to say- WOW!  Not only is this accurate about +2 second a day but I love the military style and the band is pretty nice also.  The only  thing I do not like is not being able to wind the watch with the crown. The size of this watch is about right for me..... with 7.5&#34; wrist.  Update:  I've had the watch for almost 6 months.  I still really enjoy wearing this watch.  I am normally pretty hard on watches and I imagine mentally I have been careful with this watch, it is my everyday watch, but so far no scratches.  Update #2:  This watch has been on my wrist daily for almost a year.  I'm still in love with this watch, with one tiny scratch on the crystal now; happened while working on my car.  If there was something I was disappointed about- the stainless steel band scratches easy. I still really like this watch.  Update #3:  Still my daily watch.  I do on occasion run a scotch bright fine pad on the stainless band and it quickly removes all the scratches and the band looks great again with the matte finish.  Keep in mind you need to remove the band from the watch and carefully run it in the same direction in one movement. *DO NOT DO THIS TO THE WATCH CASE, IT HAS A TITANIUM COATING*  The case and the crystal have held up well, far better than I ever expected.  My timegrapher has this watch running at +6 seconds a day averaged in 5 positions.  Update #4:  1/15/2016 not my daily runner anymore but wear it a few times a month.  Still running great according to my timegrapher +6 seconds a day averaged in 5 positions.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Let's face it- Dystopian future novels are a dime a dozen. A few, such as Huxley's \\"Brave New World,\\" Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" (my personal favorite), and Orwell's \\"1984\\" have entered the canon of great literature.  I propose finding room in that canon for \\"The Hunger Games.\\"<br /><br />It is not only a commentary on brutal violence, it is more importantly a commentary on the brutal path that was as a nation have pursued for the past few years. We are indeed at the beginning of a civil war between urban elites and the poor yokels (otherwise known as Americans) in \\"flyover country.\\"  In \\"The Hunger Games,\\" while the urban elites continue to spiral into frivolity and dependence, everyone else is struggling to stay alive and aspiring, like the protagonist, Katniss, to nothing more than self-sufficiency. One of the most breathtaking literary moments I've read in a long time is the passage in which she describes, finding a dandelion and realizing that it is edible- that she can use her knowledge of hunting and natural plant food sources to feed her family without depending on others to do it for her.<br /><br />Another theme in the book is the superiority of voluntary sacrifice over mandatory sacrifice, as Katniss takes her sister's place in the vile, bloody ritual demanded by the government, and agrees to sacrifice her life if necessary at another key point later in the book (I won't tell you any more about that- I hate spoilers!. In short, \\"The Hunger Games\\" is an excellent read about the American spirit of independence and self-reliance, and whether it can survive in spite of unthinkable brutality imposed by government. I don't think we really get an answer to that in this first book, but I look forward to reading the rest of the series to find out.

The bag looks great, and seems the perfect fit for a messenger bag alternative - meaning, it fits a laptop, accessories and a couple of magazines.<br /><br />The materials look and feel great, but we were very disappointed by the zipper of the main compartment. In the curves at the upper part it just gets stuck. Even with two hands it barely moves, and you need to wrestle with it. We were so excited about the bag, we hoped it was just this unit, so we returned it and ordered another one. Alas, the second one demonstrated the very same problem.<br /><br />I love the Booq design, so we are going to try the Mamba Shift M instead. Hopefully this one will work.

With Joseph Kony as a key component in the movie and in the news everywhere with KONY 2012, why are they delaying it???<br />I am not a conspiracy theory guy, in fact most I laugh them off, but I really question if the Christian element is just too strong for secular Hollywood??<br />It's a great film, based on a true story (I've seen the movie and read the book), it needs to be seen!

B005MMJ84K|4.0|36 hours ago I finished Delirium - and after restraining myself from throwing the book out the window in frustration, I moved immediately onto Pandemonium.  I don't often move straight to the next book, I like to let the one I've just finished 'settle' a little, but in this case I just couldn't help myself - I HAD to know what happened next.<br /><br />I tore through Pandemonium in less than 24 hours - partly because it was a good book but also because I started with a sneaking suspicion that I knew what was going to happen at the end - and I was right.  Anyway, enough of my gloating about my guessing prowess, here are my thoughts on Pandemonium.<br /><br />Told in alternating 'Then' and 'Now' chapters, Pandemonium focuses on Lena just after escaping to the wilds, and six months later.  I'm not the biggest fan of alternating time-frames by chapter, but it's done pretty well through Pandemonium - it's clearly delineated so there's no confusion, although towards the end of the book the chapters do get quite short for while as the story starts to really heat up.<br /><br />There is a lot more world-building in Pandemonium, expanding upon some parts of society and introducing some that were not even mentioned in Delirium and making the Wilds a more tangible, imaginable place with kick-ass new characters (loved Raven - that girl scared me!).<br /><br />Lena has certainly toughened up as a character in the 'Now', and the 'Then' explains the situations she has been through in the Wilds that have caused her to grow some serious balls.  There is a new male character (of course), but he came across to me as a bit of a whingy little boy  - I didn't find him nearly as solid or likeable as Alex.<br /><br />The second book in a trilogy is always a toughie - the first book has a lot to tell and the final book wraps everything up, but the second book is sometimes considered 'filler' - and Pandemonium, for the most part, manages to avoid the 'filler' tag. Lauren Oliver, as always, writes well and builds excellent tension, with some heartbreaking, heart-stopping moments thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />As I said earlier, I'd already guessed the 'cliffhanger' well before I got there, so I didn't have book murdering thoughts when I got there, but if you aren't expecting it I can certainly see why you would want to drop-kick that bad boy into next week!  I will be anticipating the third book (in 2013!), but it's not going to kill me waiting for it.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed Pandemonium, even more so than Delirium.  The world-building is stronger, the action is more, well, action-ey and I loved the transformation of Lena.  If you were a little disappointed by Delirium because it moved slowly or Lena wasn't the most likeable character, you should still give Pandemonium a try - it might surprise you!rites well and builds excellent tension, with some heartbreaking, heart-stopping moments thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />As I said earlier, I'd already guessed the 'cliffhanger' well before I got there, so I didn't have book murdering thoughts when I got there, but if you aren't expecting it I can certainly see why you would want to drop-kick that bad boy into next week!

1592536913|3.0|This book is a nice introduction to the art of Steampunk.  It's not super fabulous but is worth reading for those interested in knowing about this particular art movement.  It's paperback and light/easy reading.  The pictures of artwork are interesting and unique.  Can be used to inspire someone to create their own mixed media artworks.  I give this book a rating of 3 stars.

B0011UF79C|4.0|In the near future, humanity has mastered his own genetic code. So thorough is this knowledge, in fact, that the majority of modern conceptions are performed in a petri dish, on an embryo with the lowest number of negative hereditary traits. Against the backdrop of this fanatically eugenic-conscious future, discrimination has reached new levels, as jobs and relationships are won and lost with a simple blood sample and naturally conceived children are second-rate citizens. It seems like there's always a persistent, rebellious figure when confronted with such an oppressive system, and in Gattaca's case that role is filled by Ethan Hawke as the physically modest, daydreaming genius Vincent. The bevy of hoops Hawke jumps through to maintain the illusion that he's a top-tier genetic example make up most of the film's substance, with an ongoing murder investigation pressing the matter in a few hairy new directions. Somewhere along the way Vincent stumbles into a hollow, affection-free relationship with Uma Thurman that seems to spawn more from boredom than passion. Quite slow and methodical in nature, it's still a bright rumination on a future that already seems within grasp. Could have used a more flavorful tone, and the cast is almost universally glazed-over and dry.

1594203334|4.0|Pamela Druckerman's Bringing Up B&eacute;b&eacute; begins with the assumption that French parents manage to lead lives that are relatively free of stress while raising well-behaved children and not losing sight of themselves as individuals. She sets out to identify the `secrets' of French parenting. What she finds is that unlike American parents, who valiantly try to find or create a parenting style that `fits' them, French children are raised in an amazingly homogenous framework, or cadre freeing their parents to devote time and energy to their careers and outside interests.<br /><br />Druckerman states in the beginning of the book, \\"As an American, I need things to be spelled out.\\" American culture is what Edward T. Hall described as `low-context',whereas French culture is comparatively `high-context'. High-context cultures tend to be collectivist rather than individualistic and highly relational with strong personal bonds, closely knit family groups and high levels of commitment. With a high degree of shared experiences and expectations, there is less need for things to be made explicit. In low-context cultures codes are more visible and more easily articulated.<br /><br />As a high-context culture, there is broad agreement in France on the general child-rearing practices. Americans, perhaps the greatest individualists on earth, feel the need to customize their environments in order to feel comfortable and in control, which is often the same thing. This overarching need for an individualized experience leaves the French shaking their heads in bemusement and muttering, `n'importe quoi,' which Druckerman translates literally as `whatever', but a translation that captures its usage is `what the heck', or `that's just ridiculous.' The reaction to that which elicits the n'importe quoi is always negative.<br /><br />While Druckerman is looking to unlock the secrets of French parenting, she inadvertently identifies codes that can be applied to French society as a whole.Children are educated from the very beginning to assume a role in the greater `adult' world. The rules are not just for children to behave, but rules that reinforce the codes that allow entry to French society.<br /><br />The French government-subsidized daycare system, free public pre-school, an 8-hour school day and affordable after school programs not only allow parents to work, but they also function as citizen-building greenhouses. The family and school are a child's main cultural references. The child has a place within the family and the school, and thus in the wider world. Through adherence to the structure and the rules of this social framework, the child learns patience and self-control. Young girls learn that they can pursue higher education and training, seeing in their environment that they will not have to choose between children and a career when they grow up. Young boys see that educated, independent women are the norm.<br /><br />The French school consciously transmits the ideals of the R&eacute;publique which are reinforced in the family by adults who as children assimilated the same values themselves. Druckerman emphasizes that while there is wide agreement in society about the value of this cadre, there is also acceptance of greater liberty within it. Strong adherence to basic rules and codes allows for greater freedom within the framework.<br /><br />It will come as no surprise to anyone who has spent time in France that this framework is created and structured through language and food traditions. The French value `culture g&eacute;n&eacute;rale', a well-rounded education and the ability to converse about and engage in a wide range of subjects. They have a shared corpus of cultural and historical knowledge that they began to acquire at a very early age in the French school system. Food comes up repeatedly in Druckerman's book because it hits all of the cultural memes and chief among them is `Lack of structure leads to lack of self-restraint.'Tradition or the cadre structures the day and mealtimes, regulates eating and also provides a framework for social interaction.<br /><br />The `wisdom of French parenting' that Druckerman espouses is dependent on wide societal acceptance of French values. Unfortunately, her book does not discuss the evolving heterogeneous nature of French culture today with the influx of immigrants from Northern and Sub-Saharan Africa and their accompanying cultural differences.<br /><br />With her `I'm just another neurotic New Yorker trying to get through the day' style, Druckerman entertains and informs based on her experiences and well-documented research. I look forward to her next book from France, and hope it will be on the French school system.<br /><br />For the full-length version of this review, please see my blog at [...]. K-Rae Nelson (C) 2012

B0034G4P4Y|5.0|What a fantastic movie...<br /><br />Truly, only a master director could have done this!! I last read Tintin comic books as a 10 year old kid, now watching it after few decades took me back to good old times, what a pleasure it was, I just did not want it to end.<br /><br />The story flow is extremely well conjoined to make one excellent movie out of 3 comic books (The Secret of the Unicorn, Red Rackham's Treasure and The Crab with the Golden Claws). The characters are very well cast, and I wish some how \\"Professor Calculus\\" could have fitted into this movie, I missed him. I am glad that the director just did not lift the movie frame by frame from the comic books, instead he decided to add and subtract his own action sequences, which makes this movie brilliant, adds a newer feel and is pleasure to watch.<br /><br />I look forward to a sequel now...

0307276902|1.0|I went into this book with a lot of enthusiasm and excitement to read it. Not because it was one of Oprah's book club picks, or because of how much attention it had gathered, but rather because I'm generally attracted to what you would call the \\"drug genre\\".<br />Also, let me say that I'm totally an open minded person, and still decided to read it after a few friends told me it was a total lie.<br />That being said, this book took me over a year to finish. Again, not because it was a hard read, if anything it was super easy, but it was just so obviously fake! The way James wrote about certain situations and how everything just ends up working in his favor is just so suspiciously made up. Go read tweak, permanent midnight, junky- those are all real accounts and believable plots with characters you can sympathize with, and actually picture existing.<br />I had an extremely hard time not being annoyed and rolling my eyes through the entire thing because it was all so made up. And ok, even if he'd published this as a fictional book, in my eyes it would have still stunk, because everything just doesn't work out in your favor in real life as it worked out for James.<br />Anywho, sorry- here's what it's about.<br />Basically he wakes up after binging on whatever drug because apparently he does EVERYTHING, including glue and paint (lmao), with a HOLE in his cheek. He's then taken to a rehab facility by his parents, rebels against it at first, then befriends a mobster named Leonard that takes him under his wing.<br /><br />Leonard basically threatens him, and tells him he better stick through the program, blah blah blah. He falls in love with some girl? She's so forgetful that I don't even remember her no to be honest, only that she runs away from rehab to go get high and he runs after her into some crack house, where he has enough will power to walk through and watch other junkies getting high to go get her.<br />In the book he befriends a judge who miraculously pulls some strings so that he doesn't have to go to jail or prison for crimes he committed before his admittance into rehab.<br /><br />I think the only believable part of the book thinking back, was that he was mad at his parents and he didn't know why. I won't ruin that part for you if you must read the book.<br /><br />But to be honest, this book is a complete waste of time to read. The only reason I'm leaving a review is to warn others of how awful it is.strings so that he doesn't have to go to jail or prison for crimes he committed before his admittance into rehab.<br /><br />I think the only believable part of the book thinking back, was that he was mad at his parents and he didn't know why.

1451648537|5.0|I'm not a big fan of biographies or Jobs, but this book has really helped me gain a new perspective on him. He rightly chose Isaacson to write his biography. He's a very considerate yet still peering writer. I was impressed by this book and Job's life, and I would almost go as far to say that this is a page turner if you know little about Steve's life.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What an amazing series.  forget about the spell binding sex.  The deeper issues of these two key players trying to figure out their personal issues is the key to the story.  Is the relatinship good or bad?  Does their need for each other overpower the desire they have for each other?  I loved this book... the sex is really not the key to the relatinship, although it is incredibly hot.  The basis of the relationship fullfilling their individual needs is more powerful.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I held out reading this book ... however with the movie coming out and all the hype I thought, 'why not' and so I purchased it for my Kindle.  I fell in love with the characters, plot and the author's writing style from the first page.  I had a hard time putting it down and finished this book in less than a day.  I will admit, I am a lover of the Twilight Saga ... (there's my ONE personal confession for the day!) and this book was nothing like that series.  It seemed to be a deeper book with deeper characters and actually read more 'adult' than 'teenager' fiction.  The subject content was much more adult as well.<br /><br />I'm sure most of you out there have an idea of the plot and storyline from friends or from the trailers from the movie, so I won't bore you with all that.  I will say that Katniss is a very interesting and like-able character.  She is a strong-willed girl who fights for her family and I love the aspect of that character.  She instantly had me pulling for her.  I have already continued on with this series and have recommended it to all my friends.  This pulled a lot from the sci-fi mindset and I love how that played out.  I have yet to see the movie, so am looking forward to seeing this book come to life.

B0060AY6FO|3.0|True JA fanes beware, this book doesn't exactly provide anymore character development for our favorite P&P characters.  In fact, the book sort of reads as thought these are new characters who happen to have the P&P characters' names and backgrounds.  The story is entertaining, but not the kind of book that I would pass around to my friends.

0439023483|5.0|If it was, I would have been crazy obsessed. Now, I'm only obsessed. Unfortunately, there were not many female heroins when I was a kid, reading books. I would have worshiped Katniss when I was a 14-yr-old girl. I read this because I saw the trailer for the movie and it seemed up my alley. And I had seen the book in the book stores for many years but thought it was some adult crime novel my dad would read, and so dismissed it. If I want a good read, I usually read a classic. Most modern books usually can't keep my attention or, if I'm lucky, I may like it, but not enough to make much of an impact. I think I was hooked from the first page with this book. The only page turner I've read in the last 10 years, other than 'The Help,' was this book. It's also the only book that has made me cry like a baby while reading it on an airplane. I don't think I've cried like that since they killed Buffy at the end of season 5. I don't know what it is but these books grip you with this crazy, emotional impact. I had to start reading the second book right away because I had to make sure Katniss was alright. Not many writers can make you feel so connected to the characters that they almost feel real to you, and elicit emotion.<br /><br />I suppose Suzanne Collins wrote this too late for my childhood, but I'm glad someone finally wrote something that speaks to the girls or women who don't want to wait around to be saved.

B004GYY714|5.0|This app simply rocks! I got sick and tired of sifting through winamp's endless,  unsorted listings for a nearby NPR station and if you've tried the official NPR app you know exactly how unremarkable it is. TiR lists it's bazillions of stations and podcasts very intuitively with one-click play, pause and favorites. Could use a podcast site favoriting click somewhere instead of separate episodes, but I'll happily overlook that and give the 5th star for massive utility. Pandigital Supernova Gingerbread.

B000O8OTNC|1.0|If your sharpener does anything other than grind toward the edge (ie, not across it) then it's tearing the edge off rather than sharpening it.  This makes the edge really uneven and kinda maxes out the sharpness at mediocre.  I have one of these and it seemed like a good idea at the time, but I've since thrown it away. I really regret using this on any of my knives, pocket, chef or otherwise.  Yes it works, but it kinda ruins the edge and when you get a real kit you have to completely redo the edge.<br /><br />I went completely high dollar and don't regret it.  You can't buy the edge pro apex here, but you can get something similar.  Anything that guides an edge at the right angle *and* in the right direction is the way to go.  The following kit is fantastic, probably just as good as the edge pro, but slightly slower.<br /><br />[...]
0984999302|5.0|The Startup Owner's Manual along with Steve Blank's Lean Launchpad class syllabus [...], his blog and his many lectures captured on video, are part and parcel of Steve Blank's vision to disrupt how entrepreneurship is taught worldwide.    The Startup Owner's Manual delivers on that vision by virtue of disruption from the inside out.  It looks, feels and smells like a textbook, yet it is a Trojan Horse that is carefully designed to deliver the killing blow to ubiquitous totem of entrepreneurial education, the 40 page business plan.    The book is easy to read and comprehensive, it manages both the macro-meta and the micro topics amazingly well.    Building on his earlier work [[ASIN:0976470705 The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that Win]] and Alexander Osterwalder's [[ASIN:0470876417 Business Model Generation: A Handbook for Visionaries, Game Changers, and Challengers]], The Startup Owner's Manual successfully abstracts strategies and tactics for searching for a repeatable, scalable business model.    It is still early days in the worldwide entrepreneurial renaissance happening around us -- a few years from now, we will look back and see The Startup Owner's Manual as a seminal text in the new experiential and inquiry-based methods of entrepreneurship education.

B005KCGIUY|4.0|Was curious about maynards side project Puscifer. THought i would give it a listen since I convinced my husband to go see them live in san fran. I have not stopped listening to this CD. It is very chilll with feelings of utopia. It sounds good on a set of BOSE system. Would definately give it a listen. Do not compare it to TOOL. Its totally one of maynards multiple personallities. Corina Round has a beautiful voice in my opinion and sounds great under maynards voice. Some greats from this CD-The green valley,monsoons,Oceans,Horizons,THe weaver,Man Overboard and Tumbleweed. Hope this helps.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not bad at all. old games with little to do, but it passes the time. some definitely more challenging than others.
B0015DROBO|3.0|Honestly?  See the movies.  It's a good story, no doubt, but the pace is just excruciatingly slow.  The minutia is overwhelming, but if you get through it, there are some admittedly great characters.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|WOW!  I just finished the 3rd book in this trilogy and have to say, what an awesome story!  Just loved it.  The two characters were wonderful.  I love romantic stories and this was that and so much more...I have read all 3 books in less then a week and then have reread them once again.  Just addicting to read and see what is coming next...every thing was exciting, happy , sad, sexy, hot, thrilling, etc...You must read this book...I like how she gives Christians version on how he and Ana first met...very interesting and I'm glad he turns out the way he does.

B000GDH9JQ|5.0|Everyone in this movie was outstanding. I think it might be the first time I ever saw Helen Mirren. I thought she was really Russian.... she's not. But she is  a fabulous actress. And of course the dancing......oy the dancing. Sad to watch now when I know Mr. Hines is passed, but this will keep his memory alive! And Mikhail ain't hard on the eyes!!!

0553801473|5.0|This book is like a game of Tetris, where you finally get everything set up so you just need that one long piece to slide down into the crack before some awesome stuff really goes down. A Song of Ice and Fire, after this book, is at that point. This book is a well-written exercise in building anticipation for the real game to begin.
B000I9U9A4|1.0|This movie is an insult to the author and the casting stinks...a hobbit for Coxswain, just WRONG!  Either do the series, or don't...don't mash several books together and ruin it all.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Another great book. After reading all three books, I can only hope that the author will write another one. The final book made me feel like I was right there with Katniss trying to get to capitol. The power that this book has on your imagination is thrilling.

1469984202|5.0|OK, so the title for this review gives it away.  I don't write reviews for most books I read but loved this one, definite 5 stars.  Very well written with good style and characterization.  Some very good twists along the way (no hints) that keep interest high.  At one point I was a little perplexed on the limited background for the situation (why were the Silos and toxins created) but it allowed for imagination to fill in.  I am a life-long sci-fi (not fantasy, creature-feature stuff) fan and this ranks in the top tenth or so.  My first book(s) from this author but will be looking for more.
B005FITIGO|5.0|You can almost feel the chill in the room. You expect to see the exhaled air in the office. It is the American way, the American way of business. It is the way of handing people their pink slip. It's an assembly line that is efficient  and cold. It is a human slaughterhouse in action.<br /><br />That is how this film starts, a man is being laid off after so many years. The Human Resources executive doesn't have a sympathetic ear, a kind word, or even a warm smile.  When the victim (played by Stanley Tucci), tells her that there is some important project he was completing, she dismisses his concern. His message could be that she is on a sinking ship and she doesn't know the gravity of her own situation. In fact, that is what he was indirectly trying to tell her. He could only tell it to a now former colleague to whom he passes a jump drive, just before the elevator door closes on him and his career.<br /><br />By early evening the colleague installs the drive and looks at his work.  The numbers don't lie. The company is on the verge of imminent financial disaster. He makes a call summoning people back to work which eventually reaches up the entire chain of command to the C.E.O. It is now late at night, and decisions have to be made, decisions that will bankrupt the firm or sucker other investors to ensure the company's survival.<br /><br />A number of characters come into play here, the one who is fired, the ones who will be fired, the one who will be blamed, the one who will make the decision, and the one who will abide by it because--he needs the money.<br /><br />This suspenseful film takes place over the course of one day, from morning to morning. What makes it work besides a fine cast is that you are pretty certain you know the outcome, but you, and forgive me for saying so, don't want to \\"buy\\" the outcome.<br /><br />You can hedge your bet that you will be entertained, but perhaps not in a pleasing way. This film is a dose of reality in the way business is conducted. It is ruthless, heartless and is only interested in Profit Resources, not Human Resources. It shows that these people can be robbers, eager to pull the trigger on loyal employees or investors who trusted them. The firm may give knowledgeable people a chilling reminder of Goldman Sachs, and how they treated their investors.<br /><br />Zachary Quinto, Kevin Spacey, Paul Bethany, Demi Moore, and Jeremy Irons are the cast that makes the financial meltdown of 2008 a taut thriller under the direction of J. C. Chandler. During that night, while the rest of us slept or went about our business of an honest day's labor, many others were burning the midnight oil in bringing on the worst financial disaster in 70 years.<br /><br />Margin Call is your call, but if I were you I wouldn't miss it, especially if you already trust your money in someone else's hands.ucted.

B003G4W49C|3.0|I found this after reading Old Man's War and The Forever War - apparently I was in a state of mind for some military scifi. The reviews on Amazon were really positive and the amount of five stars really sold it to me.<br /><br />I expected something akin to the Wars I read before and it really turned out to resemble them in many aspects. However this is quite different book at the same time, because its protagonist is a six-year-old boy who grows into early adolescence over the course of most of the book. And this is one of the things that bugged me: I don't particularly like stories about children growing. Sometimes they are okay, but for some reason I find them mostly a bit tedious. What I like even less however are stories about exceptional children - especially if they are really good or special simply because of being so. That's what bothered me the most about Harry Potter series too, and if Harry Potter in space interests you, then Ender's Game has a lot of things you'll like (even Quidditch of sorts).<br /><br />The problem is that Ender's Game like most of the books about exceptional children I've read doesn't really explain the reasons for being exceptional. It's told and shown that Ender's really good at what he's doing, but that's it: he doesn't feel different from the rest of kids. They shoot in weightless environment and plan tactics and Ender's really just a lot better shooter and tactician than everybody else. That's it. So the avenue of Ender's exceptional character is a dead end and it's not explored really at all. Him being really good is mostly a reason for things to happen and it carries the plot, but there's no depth about it. Ender doesn't view the world in some kind of unique way nor does he have some deeper wisdom because of his exceptional quality. He's just a great soldier trained to be a great commander Space America needs. And what about his brother and sister being as much of geniuses as he is?<br /><br />I've mostly concentrated on criticism and omitted the book's good qualities, which Ender's Game indeed has. It's a generally fun read with lots of cool and real interesting points in it, even though the overall story ain't that surprising or impressive. But as a fan of dark, hard scifi (preferably with some elements of horror) and \\"realism\\" in fantasy and scifi, I'm also not target audience of the book. And I still consider it a good book, so lots of people will probably like it even more than I did.

0553805371|5.0|If anything clearly defines this books quality it is Buckyball soccer. Stephen comes up with an incredibly simple illustration of a very complex quantum law which is completely understandable to one with no detailed knowledge of Quantum theory and he maintains this standard throughout the book. I admit to a little bias since I have known Stephen for 60 years, but I bought the book because after reading a Brief History of Time, I knew I had found someone who could explain the most worrying aspects of creation in an undestandable way to me. This book takes up where Universe in a Nutshell was proceeding but tackles the more theoretical aspects of Quantum Theory and the origins of the Universe. Whilst I know Stephen is sceptical about God, because a belief in miracles would posit an exception to scientific laws, I still believe that Stephen was created by God to imbue us with answers to questions no other person on earth could answer.

0439023491|4.0|CATCHING FIRE continues the same suspense with the duplicity of pleasing the Capitol, and living one's true life, and the suspense of having those you care about in jeopardy.  But, the unintended consequences of all that happened during HUNGER GAMES ripples across all the districts, and our protagonists find themselves, at first, unwilling catalysts in their country's transformation into rebellion.  President Snow reveals his adversarial prowess here--censoring and creating what is portrayed in all the Districts during the Victory Tour, and manipulating the lives of Panem's citizens.<br />For the 75th anniversary, the Quarter Quell, a special Hunger Games every 25 years, when it is announced how the participants will be determined, cards are forced to be played, and the extent to which these double lives will and can last is put to the ultimate test.  I initially hoped there wouldn't be another Games, but it wasn't as annoying as I thought it might be.  This time there is more at stake, and, with a couple of mysterious characters with hidden agendas, possibly for good, the outcome is unclear when the Games begin.<br /><br />Still it tugs at the heartstrings, like the first, and you feel the subtext behind the words and actions.  I wish the stakes were higher, but it would be hard to go any further than the first book.  Maybe not enough had transpired from the first to the second to build up more relationships and struggles.  If the things mentioned in the initial Quell Games press conference by the tributes were actually true, that might make it more meaningful.<br /><br />The two contestants and their trainers seem to switch places, with more people taking on the burdens of others, and different leaders emerging from the chaos.  Very satisfying sequel, but makes you wonder how one book can finish it all up.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|This is such a fun and addictive game.  I like that it starts out fairly easy and gets increasingly harder as you build your skill.  The graphics are beautiful as well.  Well done!!!
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Amazing product.  I was disappointed at first because sound would come and go but i read into it and you have to make sure EVERYTHING is plugged in properly including the mic itself.  Pretty much a must have for people who play shooters on a regular basis.  They are a bit expensive but totally worth it.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|This is what a vampire & werewolf movie should be. This new installment into the Underworld franchise is excellent and was well worth the wait. The war has intensified and now humans are the hunters. Excellent twist and some favorite characters return. Cant wait for the 4 film box set.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|*****SPOILERS*****<br />I think the only reason I finished this book is because I just wanted to see what would happen to Anastasia & Christian. The plot was interesting but the actual writing wasn't that great. The dialogue was stilted & didn't sound modern. What was worse was the constant use of British lingo by everyone in the book, even though all the characters are American born & raised. I swear I have never heard a single American ever say \\"Lets get you sorted.\\" That is British terminology, yet it kept popping up throughout the book among other distinctly British phrasings. Then there's the fact that Ana, a 21 year old woman in 2011, doesn't even own a laptop or cell phone. Ummm she was a literature major. If she didn't have a computer, how did she write the many essays & papers that come with being a college student? Practically every college campus now requires students to have laptops. Then there was her sexual naïveté. I can believe a 21 year old being a virgin (even in this day & age), but she never masturbated or even really got to 2nd base with a guy? She blushes at the drop of a hat at practically everything. And why exactly did the writer employ the chick flick cliche of making the female protagonist a hopeless klutz who is constantly falling down & needing the hero to catch her & set her right side up. I didn't get the initial attraction that Christian felt for Ana, and I couldn't get why Ana was friends with Kate, who was also her roommate. Kate was selfish, bossy, and at times self-absorbed (the one way to get Kate's attention off of you was to ask her a question about herself). I didn't find any redeeming qualities in this \\"friend.\\" At one point in the novel Ana gets really wasted and is taken away from a bar by Christian. Kate allowed it to happen because she was too busy getting it on with Christian's brother. That is not proper girl code. I'm not gonna get into the sex scenes since I feel that should be secondary to the overall writing and as they say, \\"different strokes for different folks.\\" I'm not sure if I want to waste my money by reading further installments of the trilogy. Maybe I'll wait until they come out in the lending library. Thank you Amazon Prime.
B004EQAVHI|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen in a long time, totally original and well acted. Can't praise it enough. Should have been nominated for a bunch of oscars.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I don't know about everyone else, but when I went looking for a case for my Kindle Fire I had 3 requirements. I wanted it to be a stand, I wanted it to protect the device effectively, and I wanted it to not add bulk or weight to the device in any way. This case meets all of those requirements and looks excellent to boot.<br /><br />If you remember Amazon's advertising for the Fire, they loved to talk about how it would disappear in your hands. This case doesn't interfere with that in any way, while still offering strong polycarbonate protection. It fits incredibly snug around the device whether the screen cover is strapped down or folded back for use. The stand is stable, although it only has one viewing angle. Luckily the Fire's great screen means you should see it well regardless of your angle to the screen.<br /><br />In your hands it really shines. You can barely feel the MicroShell, and the snug design lets you forget it's on there. I absolutely adore this case, and I recommend it over any other case available for the Fire, including the much more expensive ones.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I just got done reading the book a week before this came out so I decided to watch the unedited Swedish version cause I heard how good it was and I figured that the Swedish version would probably be more accurate then the US version (Hollywoods track record of converting books to movies accurately isn't very good.)  But I was very surprised the Swedish version changes too much I found myself saying \\"That didn't happen like that\\" alot.<br /><br />So my expectations for this version were kinda low.  Wow was I wrong.  Someone in Hollywood discovered how to read the book 1st then make the movie.  Sure they didn't get completely right but the changes were small for the most part and small enough to where they didn't bother me too much(Still did though).<br /><br />Over all I enjoyed this version over the Swedish version and hope they decided to remake The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest as well.
B00190OHD6|5.0|P.S. I love you is a great movie! I was looking for a little more laughter and not so many tears though. Make sure you have plenty of Kleenex ready for this one! Even though it wasn't exactly what I was looking for, I can still say it was definitely worth the money and time invested in it. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!!! :0) I received the movie promptly and I will continue to order from them. I love ordering from amazon!

B006SV2LWA|1.0|A poor version of  a  CSI episode.  I  kept  checking  to see how much time was remaining as it just dragged on. Paltrow appeared stoned in most of her minor appearances while Daimon seemed like he had better things to do like act in another Bourne movie. Kate Winslet's scenes were much better than the rest of the movie.
B003EYVXV4|5.0|The Hunger Games is based of the novel by Suzanne Collins, and is the first in a series of books that are followed by Catching Fire and Mockingjay. I started reading the novels a few months ago when I first heard about the films and I have loved all three of the books, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. Now before I go onto the review I need to go over some of the preconceived notions about the film and books going around in movie reviews and the internet. The first is that the books and film are a rip off of manga series Battle Royal. For some reason fans of the series thinks the manga is an original idea when it isn't. I've read the manga. Years ago my older brother introduced me to the manga series. I enjoyed it for what it was a violent manga with great action, but not much else behind it. The story was lacking and so were the characters. As for the originality of the series it takes its ideas from great books and films like Lord of the Fly and Ender's Game among others, so saying that Battle Royal is original is laughable. When are people going to learn that it is virtually impossible to find a truly original idea anymore. What it comes down to is execution, bringing your own take on the idea and making it your own. Suzanne Collins does that The Hunger Games and her series of books using an idea that has been used before and making it her own in which she created a great and dark futuristic dark world with flawed and likeable characters. The second thing I hear about is how the novel is geared down tween girls and these comments from people who actually haven't read the books. I've read the novels and I'm a man and in my early thirties, and I don't think they're geared for girls in their early teens. In my opinion this is geared for everyone. It's a dark series especially Mockingjay that deals with child on child violence, children forced to sell their bodies, war and torture among the other themes in the books, so saying the novels are truly geared for teen girls is just wrong. Finally we have the comparison to the Twilight books. For some reason reviewers and the public and general are overstating the romantic element in the novels and the so called love triangle between Katniss, Gale and Peeta. It's nothing like Twilight, which I tried to read but couldn't because it was really bad. First of all unlike Twilight some crappy romance isn't the main driving force in the novels. Second there isn't a love triangle especially if you've read or have gone on to read the other two books. It comes down to Katniss and Peeta. Collin's made that pretty clear in the novels. They are after all the two most important characters in the book. Katniss who will do almost anything to survive and the kind hearted Peeta who doesn't want to let the Capital and the games change him and the confusing and growing relationship between the two. All right I'm done with my rant. I really got to stop surfing the internet or going to certain sites, and now onto what I thought of the film.<br /><br />As I've said I've read the novels before seeing the film, but I'm not one of those people who'll penalize a film if it's not a perfect copy of the novel. The Hunger Games film adaptation is a great film to put it mildly, but in my opinion it's an excellent film. The best I've seen in recent memory. I think since Inception a few years ago. I won't go to in-depth into the plot of the film since most people should know the general plot of the film and it might spoil the film for those who haven't read the novel. It takes place sometime in the distant future after some kind of world war/disaster which caused the collapse of the United States and North America, and what rose from the ashes was Panem. Panem has a president but it's more of an empire then a republic. Years before the novel the thirteen districts of Panem rose up against the Capital but lost with the destruction of district 13. After the war the Capital forced the districts obedience by holding annual games in which a boy and girl from each district from the ages 12 to 18 are randomly picked and forced into game/reality show in which they children must kill each other and there can be only one winner. You don't need to read the books to enjoy the film as it's pretty easy to follow. As for the film adaptation of the book its stays pretty close to the book. There are a few people cut from the film. The mayor's daughter Madge Undersee and Peeta's parents cut from the film. I shouldn't say they were cut since I don't know if they were edited out or just not added. Then there is Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) who they didn't wasn't introduced in the film like he was in the movie. I didn't mind the small deviations from the novel and I liked what they added in place. The added a behind the scenes take on the film. Showing the head game master Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) as he views the games along with his interaction with president Snow (Donald Sutherland).<br /><br />The acting was great in this film especially by many of the young actors. Of course I have to point out Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss Everdeen) as the lead. She is in almost every scene in the film and it's her shoulders this budding film trilogy is thrust upon. I'm sure if she'd didn't have a good performance or a less talented actress was casted for the part the film would still make a lot of money, but it would have lost much of its credibility. Jennifer delivers in her role as the young Katniss thrust into the games and fighting for survival and dealing with loss and her budding feelings for Peeta. She is a hell of an actress. I've only seen her as Mystique in X-Men: First Class, which see did a good job in. I've heard really good things about her other film Winter's Bone. I've been meaning to see that film for awhile. The other actors did a really good lob. Josh Hutcherson (Peeta Mellark) does a great job as Peeta, and he should since besides Katniss he really in the most important character inthe series and what he represents. The chemistry between Jennifer and Josh is really good and their scenes together are believable. Woody Harrelson in his supporting role as Haymitch is good as a funny drunk yet dark and serious man. Wes Bently as the head game master did a really a decent job as Seneca, especially his finale scene in the film. Donald Sutherland did a great job as President Snow and his manipulation of the games. Many of the tributes got glossed over in the film. Well there are 24 for them and only one is supposed to survive, so you don't get to know many of them. A few stand out like Alexander Ludwig (Cato) and Amandla Stenberg (Rue) both do a great job in their roles. Then there is Lenny Kravitz (Cinna) who did a good job playing Katniss's stylist and friend. Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman was brilliant in his acting and his interaction with the other actors. The only actor who was left out was Liam Hemsworth (Gale Hawthorne). I think the only reason his name is mentioned a lot really is his older brother Thor Chris Hemsworth. He only has a few scenes in the film. I'm not sure what their going to do with him in the films. In the books he's a minor character in the Hunger Games, a supporting character in Catching Fire and has a main role in the final book Mockingjay.<br /><br />Now I've heard some complaints about the rating of the film in that it's PG-13 not R. The film script was written for a PG-13 rating. That's not to say there isn't any violence in the film. There is a lot and to be honest it's borderline R rating. I'm sure the film had to be edited for time and content to get the PG-13 rating. I'm also sure there'll be an extended edition of the film on DVD and Blu Ray in the not to distant future. That being said any complainers about the so called lack of violence should be satisfied as there is plenty of action which is done well. A small complaint is the shaking camera type of filming. I don't know why people what to continue to dothis for films. I know directors are trying to add grittiness and realism to the film, but it does get a little irritating sometimes.<br /><br />Speaking of directing the directing of the Hunger Games is really well done by Gary Ross. I have never heard of the director before this film. I didn't know he directed some decent films in Pleasantville and Seabiscuit. I've seen he's directing the sequel Catching Fire and if he does as well as he did here along with good writing I have high hopes for the film.<br /><br />Isn't funny that soundtracks are virtually never used in the films their promoted for or only used in the credits. That's what happened with the so called soundtrack for the film which is relegated to the credits. As for the score there isn't much of one as you can go a long time in the film with out any kind of background music. That was another tiny flaw I had with the film, but it didn't bother me that much.<br /><br />Overall the Hunger Games is an excellent film with a great story, excellent acting, great action and really good directing. Instead of comparing it to Twilight in film adaptation of novels it should be compared to Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings. I highly recommend this film whether you've read the books or not, and don't let the media's and many critics preconceived notions of the film keep you from seeing it. In fact I plan on seeing the film again really soon, which I really do because of ticket prices and only for truly great films.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had never read anything from the author or anything labled \\"BSDM\\"... I however loved the complex characters, who I think the author really took time to develop.

0385534639|5.0|\\"The circus arrives without warning.\\" This is how this book starts, and I have to say that my attention was caught from those very first words. I was completely engrossed in the descriptions of the circus itself (especially once we realize who is behind all of the incredible attractions) to the point that I wished something like it could exist in reality. The romance between Celia and Marco was a slow-burning one as opposed to the typical \\"they met and fell in love instantly\\" trope which is getting a whole lot of page time in books today. I loved reading about the ways they worked together to turn the circus into something completely unforgettable and truly magical.<br /><br />Be forewarned, however, that the \\"fierce competition\\" mentioned in the summary is a bit misleading; the action in this book is extremely tempered, and you learn about it via alternating viewpoints and time periods which can be slightly confusing. The competition takes place between Marco and Celia, who go for a great deal of this book without having hardly any contact with each other. This book, to me, was more about the love story than the whole reason these two had been brought together in the first place (i.e. the competition), and it was their interactions (or their reactions to each other or the things one or the other of them did) that drove this book. I wanted to know how things would work out, and how Celia and Marco would escape their seemingly predestined fates.<br /><br />If you're looking for something that's nonstop action and/or breathtaking duels, you'll need to look elsewhere because that's just not what this book is. If you're willing to read something slower-paced but still utterly engaging, however, you can do no better than The Night Circus. I highly recommend it.

1596432594|4.0|As someone who had already read \\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\\" and \\"What Do You Care What Other People Think?\\", I looked forward to a fresh perspective on Feynman's life and work, and this book didn't disappoint me. While I must confess that the visual style didn't appeal to me in the beginning, I quickly got used to it, and even came to enjoy it. One of the things that surprised me in this book was how complete it was: despite having much less words than the two text-based ones I read, I can't think of any significant episode from the previous books that was left out -- quite the opposite, in fact: I learned many new amusing facts, especially towards the end, that enriched my understanding of Feynman's persona. I fully recommend it to anyone wishing to get insight into the life course of one of the most beloved physicists in recent history.
B000LTAY1U|1.0|I was very surprised that the watch stopped working after 2 weeks since I have never gotten a dud from Seiko before. It was never dropped or abused. The watch is also very light for an automatic watch. The automatic mechanism feels rough and unrefined compared to better automatic watches. Going forward, I would stick with Seiko's battery powered watches.<br /><br />Follow up: Seiko does not honor warranty. Says battery charger that stores the power is broken. Definitely can't buy this watch because of its poor build quality. If you have to get it, make sure you are getting it from an authorized dealer -- because it will break.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|This latest release by Leonard Cohen is as good as it gets. Some of the songs - those reflecting on issues around approaching death - are so personal that they took my breath away. From the very moving chorus in 'Going Home' to the more buoyant but equally serious 'Banjo,' the master tells the listener that he is slowly separating from us and getting ready to move on behind 'the curtain.' While I find the thought of his departure impossible, I can't help but admire the way he bares his soul.<br /><br />By contrast, he has included a sweet, reassuring and soft lullaby in this selection and his songs about relationship/separation/depression still carry universally-felt themes.<br /><br />The final cut, 'Different Sides,' was very gratifying, since Cohen directly addresses any and every one who would censor. As a lesbian who has resisted cultural & religious bias all of my life, I was cheered by this well-crafted piece and immediately committed it to memory.<br /><br />Previous reviewers have said that several of these cuts will be among his best pieces and I agree...wholeheartedly!

B006ZCWU5K|1.0|This is just horrible. I love Bruce, always have, but let's be real here; it is a mess. Try holding this up against any of his best work; five stars, really?!? It's sad to see him running on fumes and maybe he will fool us and bounce back, but this is like watching Larry Bird trying to play NBA basketball...at 55 years old.
145162445X|4.0|I have one issue in particular with this book, and it concerns the author's treatment in the first chapter of Georges Lemaitre, the priest and physicist who discovered that the universe had a beginning.<br /><br />Although the discovery that the universe had a beginning was welcomed provisionally by the Church, the author claims that Lemaitre, despite being a priest, sought to distance himself from the Church's approval.  The reason the author gives is that Lemaitre probably feared that if his findings were wrong, then the Church would be discredited.<br /><br />However, this is misleading.  Lemaitre had very a good reason not to jump on the triumphalist bandwagon, and no doubt he advised the Church authorities not to do so either.  This is because his findings led to the conclusion that the universe had an infinitely hot dense beginning, and an infinitely hot dense beginning was clearly not \\"nothing\\" but very much \\"something\\".  In fact it was not only \\"something\\", but being infinite it was \\"everything\\".<br /><br />This clearly contradicted Church doctrine that the universe began from nothing and that is why, no doubt on Lemaitre's advice, the Church authorities, after briefly welcoming the discovery that the universe had a beginning, never raised the matter publicly again.<br /><br />Now, however, thanks to books such as this and others, everything has changed.  We now know that the universe did not begin from a point of infinite density and pressure which contained to an infinite degree all the ingredients necessary for its creation.  Instead we are discovering that the spacetime of our universe sprang into existence out of where no such spacetime existed, nor where any ingredients to make up such a spacetime existed.  Far from emerging from a point of infinite matter and energy, we are discovering that our universe emerged from zero matter and energy.<br /><br />The discovery that the universe has emerged from nothing has serious implications for Catholic doctrine.  Whereas the Church's triumphalism in Lemaitre's day at the universe having a beginning was probably premature, the Church ought to have no such reservations nowadays in proclaiming that its doctrine has been right all along.

B00506NRBS|5.0|I'm proud to be from Portland and love the groove here. It was funny to realize years into being a fan that a company I respected so much, CD Baby, was also from the Rose City. Thinking about it now - I sometimes wonder if any other city could have birthed CD Baby. That's how we roll.<br /><br />Derek Silvers founded CD Baby. His book tells the story of where it came from, how he built it, why he sold it, and why the money goes to charity.<br /><br />I loved this thing. Deeply. Yes, he hard to work his butt off. Yes, there are some mistakes made but ...<br /><br />No, he didn't have an MBA. No, he didn't need a board of people who \\"knew\\" what he should be doing. He went with his gut, did what was right, and did something pretty awesome in the process.<br /><br />I heard someone call this a \\"manifesto.\\" I wouldn't quite go there. It's simply the story, told as only Derek can, about what he did and why he did it.<br /><br />To be honest, I'm sure the average business school professor would write this thing off in a heartbeat. If that matters to you, I wouldn't read this book.<br /><br />For anyone else even remotely interested in how business REALLY works in this day and age, I'd recommend it highly.<br /><br />One of my new years declarations was that I'd read a book every week. Join me on this journey? [...]

B007KQ6XYY|5.0|It's totally awesome! Twice as good as the original. Be prepared for sniping, rockets, and more. Definitely worth it! Don't worry about the $.99. You won't regret buying it!
B005PK1G76|5.0|Purchased this console for my City Select, since I was really getting annoyed that it didn't have any cupholders or anything else. It works perfectly for what I need, and it was super affordable! About a third of the price of the baby jogger parent console. The great thing about it too is that you don't need to take it off of the stroller when you fold it up. Another plus is that it allows you to adjust it correctly so that it \\"hangs\\" right (instead of some of the other consoles that attach so that the console is angled like the handles are). Buy it!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love this game- it's a great timesink. I'm excited to know what the minigames are but i havent unlocked any yet... It's simple and facinating to watch your world grow more complicated.

B002BKIERI|5.0|This Snatam Kaur recording is one of her most profound in many ways. The opening song \\"Servant of Peace\\" has become my favorite track of hers from all of her recordings. It also incorporates the fabulous Canticle of St Francis one which you will immediately recognize on hearing even if you were not aware of the origin of the lyrics. The message is so universal, so beyond religion and religiosity. This music speaks to the heart and soul and I am so moved every time I hear it.<br /><br />\\"Liberation's Door\\" has great melody and rhythm and although it is sung in Gurmuki you'll find yourself retaining the words and music even when you're not listening to it. Essentially the lyrics speak to those that have faith, and that they will find Liberation's Door as they are carried across the great world ocean. I must also say the liner notes are fabulous and provide a great view to the essence of great songs of the divine experience.<br /><br />\\"Crimson\\" encapsulates the experience of the Fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das' experience of divine immersion represented by the color Crimson.<br /><br />\\"Mother's Blessing\\" is for me an immediate classic even though sung primarily in Spanish. It does not fail none-the-less to convey the expression of love of the divine as passed from a Mother to her daughter. Several parts are sung in two part harmony and I believe it may be Snatam singing her own harmony as well. If you are unmoved by this expressive track, I can't help but believe you are made of stone.<br /><br />\\"Har Har Ram Das Guru Hai\\" is a marvelous chant simple and effective and nicely showcases the very adept guitar work of GuruGanesha Singh.<br /><br />\\"Pritem Bhagaautee\\" almost starts out sounding like a western movie track but then breaks out in a very catchy melody whose lyrics chronicle the lineage of all the Sikh gurus from the perspective of the last one in human form; Guru Gobind Singh.<br /><br />\\"Charan Sat Sat\\" is another set of scriptural passages set to music. This song for me was the least approachable one on the entire album.<br /><br />\\"Ardas Bhayee\\" is another one of my favorite tunes. Basically referred to as the prayer beyond all prayers. \\"Ardas Bahee is a mantra prayer. If you sing it, your mind, body and soul automatically combine and without saying what you want, the need of the life is adjusted. That is the beauty of this prayer.\\" -- Yogi Bhajan\\" You can also hear this fabulous mantra/prayer as recorded by Mirabai Ceiba, another great musical adaptation of this prayer beyond all prayers! This album concludes with the sweet simple melody<br /><br />\\"Cherdi Kalaa,\\" an exaltation of these few simple words spoken by The Tenth Guru of The Sikhs; Guru Gobind Singh. Even if you purchase this recording without diving under the hood with regards to the lyrics and their root origins many will feel the power and beauty in these melodies and chants and as the concluding melody and lyrics so aptly put; may all beings prosper by his grace. This for me is a five star choice and  clearly 90% of the tracks are inspiring and beautifully presented.song for me was the least approachable one on the entire album.<br /><br />\\"Ardas Bhayee\\" is another one of my favorite tunes.

B004W2UBYW|4.0|I thought this was a great book overall.  It gave some great insight into who Steve Jobs really was (or so I think).  The book is pretty long and at some parts it seems to drag on, though other parts are very exciting.  All in all I think it was a really good biography.  I don't read biographies too often but this one is worth the read if you are at all curious about the becoming of this great CEO, Apple, or Pixar.

B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I really enjoyed this story.  Cinder was an interesting, well developed character.  My only complaint would be that most of the action took place at the very end of the story and then it was over.  It was like a mad ski to the bottom of the hill only to be met by a brick wall.  I can't wait for the sequel to see what happens.

B004DLPXAO|3.0|I love the app, but the last few versions have been sort of unstable. I just got 3.5.0.83 (on an Android 3.2.1 tablet) and it kept crashing on launch until i removed it and reinstalled it. Now it launches, but it seems to have lost the ability to lock the screen in portrait mode. The little lock icon just won't appear in the bottom right corner anymore. Having the orientation flip on you whenever you move and not being able to read at a normal \\"book\\" page size is a hassle. Also gone are the options to set the line spacing and page margins. Funnily enough, the same version on an Android phone shows all these options.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love this version. have had 2 others,too difficult to navigate. and the daily reading plans are great. thank you for helping spread God's Word.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love this new angry birds space release! It's beautiful and crisp on my Fire. Also, since there is no gravity in space the gameplay has changed accordingly. It's a new way to play as opposed to simply different backgrounds.Awesome!

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|This series has definitely changed my opinion about HBO series. Last year I watched Season 1 on Cuevana, because I didn't have HBO, and after watching the first episode I got completely hooked (so I bought the books for my Kindle, and I am re-reading the whole series now). This year, I already bought an HBO subscription, and I'm eagerly waiting for Season 2.<br />Season 1 Bluray box set is very good looking, both video and audio quality are superb, and the additional materials are all a raving fan could ask for. The price is just right for the quality you get. Shipment and delivery were timely, as it has always been for me when purchasing at Amazon.
B0055PMURG|5.0|Helen Hunt and Dennis Quaid at their best.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is great.  It is addicting.  I do wish there was more than one quest.  It was fun and over to soon.  But there are many other games to play.  When they say Endless they do mean Endless.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I really like this...the best one so far. It was worth the $2.99. I'll buy the PC version when it comes out also. I have all the other Angry Birds on my fire and on my PC...it is a little easier on some levels to play on my 23\\" screen at times.<br /><br />I'm hooked.

0679731725|5.0|You have probably seen the well received movie by Merchant Ivory ([[ASIN:B00003CXC9 The Remains of the Day (Special Edition)]]). The source material, the book by Kazuo Ishiguro is a true of art. It is built around a long conversation that an ageing butler, Stevens, has with himself. The story moves forwards in time as he drives across the country and it moves back as he reminisces about his career serving Lord Darlington, one of the leaders of the Appeasement movement in the twenties and thirties. By the time the novel opens, Lord Darlington is dead and his property now belongs to Stevens' new employer, the American Mr. Faraday.<br /><br />There are really no characters or dialogue per se in this novel, as all of the action takes place inside Stevens' head as he recalls events and conversations that happened earlier that day or years ago. The central question that Stevens asks him is what has been the value of his life and what could he have done differently. During his best years, he showed complete devotion and trust in Lord Darlington, a figure now generally regarded as a collaborator and even traitor. While even Lord Darlington has apologized for his past beliefs, Stevens remains steadfast in his belief that by serving a great man he has done his job. In many parts of the book, Stevens reflects on the responsibility of a butler (to serve and act with dignity) and then reflects on what this might mean.<br /><br />At its heart, Remains of the Day is a sad story, a tragedy about decisions taken and not taken. Stevens is many ways a perfect English butler who is challenged by his past decisions as he leaves, for the first time, the comfortable confines of Darlington Hall on his journey. Stevens is a distant man, one who does not easily understand humor or emotions and who is always under control.<br /><br />The Remains of the Day is not an easy book. It all occurs inside Stevens' head as he converses with the reader. He relates conversations that he has had and incidents that have happened to him. This approach can be dry and slow; it is not for everybody. Although the book differs in many respects from the movie, it probably appeals to the same audience. If you liked the movie, you will probably like the book.
B00511ONPG|4.0|As a Search Engine Marketing professional and owning my own business for 10 years, I have read a bunch of expert books on Social Media and Search.<br />I found this book to be detailed as well as strategic in how it gives advice. In the sea of social media books, I often read other experts work to stay fresh and up to date on what other's are saying. I found 10 action items in the first two chapters I will implement today. Thank you again for your thought leadership and as an author myself, Thumbonomics: THe Essential Business Roadmap to Social Media & Mobile Marketing, I appreciate how much work goes into keeping a book like this fresh and value packed.

I have yet to see it's equal, and re-learning the affection for refined touch, facial expressions and smooth continuous scenes that force the appreciation of that sense that either quickens or slows the heart... perfect casting, cadence of humor punctuated with deep emotion, I loved this film and look forward to the next viewing....sigh

B0064IP0SY|5.0|&Oacute;lafur Arnalds is easily the best artist to come out of Iceland.  Melding classical composition with electronic elements, Arnalds' music is entirely ethereal.  The fabulous thing about this release is that each song was written and recorded in a day (following the success of 'Found Songs').  Arnalds' piano and accompanying woodwinds are amazing to say the least.  A must-have for fans of post-rock.  If you're a fan of God Is An Astronaut, J&oacute;hann J&oacute;hannsson or Hildur Guðnad&oacute;ttir pick this up.

0545405777|1.0|People have been accusing Suzanne Collins of plagiarizing Battle Royale and that is not true (Well at least to the extent of the law) but its true that she copied too many aspects of Battle Royale and it's most likely that she westernized the idea of Battle Royale in an attempt the reach the large and profitable American market. Hunger Games fans don't want to realize that the book they adore so much is actually a sloppy rehashed Battle Royale simply because of its origin or for other petty reasons. They either quickly dismiss Battle Royale or read it with a heavy bias and ignore the very substance of the book that Collins tries so hard to imitate. I'm not going to elaborate on the similarities between the two books but its clear that Battle Royale solidified the popularity of this genre and its identity has unique elements which separates itself from the rest of the works and puts it at the forefront. Although Battle Royale may have been influenced by earlier novels like \\"Running Man\\" or \\"The Survivor\\" (The Running Man movie also flopped) they differentiate enough in substance especially compared to The Hunger Games. The success of previous works relating to this genre pale in comparison to Battle Royale and it redefined this genre plenty enough to legitimatize it. Collins definitely did very well for herself as an unoriginal children's book author but looked elsewhere for success after her Underworld Chronicles series. Overall I would not recommend this book or the movie and the American public should wise up and discourage writers from this practice.
0307956350|5.0|I was really riveted by this book and it's not my usual genre.  I couldn't wait to get back to it, and found it extra interesting that it was written by a man from a woman's point of view - hard to do well, but very successfully done in the Expats.  I read it over three days.  And now I am looking at my husband funny over the breakfast table....

B006DICWUE|4.0|7th album since 1996 for Brooklyn, New York band--classic guitar power pop with epic melodies,<br />  flowing lead lines, jangly rhythms and compelling vocals.  One of the most consistently impress-<br />  sive bands in the genre.  Includes former members of the Fuzztones, Cobra Verde, My Dad Is<br />  Dead, Because Because Because, Champale, Guided By Voices.  Reminiscent of bands like<br />  Weezer, the Byrds, Tommy Keene, R.E.M., Fountains Of Wayne, Teenage Fanclub, Gripweeds,<br />  Death Cab for Cutie, etc.

B0072X2NUS|2.0|VCMG stands for Vince Clarke & Martin Gore, former alums of Depeche Mode/Erasure.  This is upbeat,<br />  club-ready instrumental synth/pop techno with a clean, professional, old-school feel.  And that's<br />  about it.  It's just by-the-numbers; nowhere near the quality of their former output.  A mediocrely<br />  satisfying album by two legends of the past.  I think most of those on the dance floor for round one probably<br />  have bad knees by now, but if this kind of music rings your bell, the album will likely give you a retro smile.
B000Z45PEC|2.0|they tried to fix it with a little piece of paper to hold a piece into where the fuel goes into the time machine in the movies. So obviously this was opened or used but I bought it new.
B006CC0YB0|5.0|9th release from West Coast vocalist--Lanegan has a powerfully gripping rumble-quaver throat<br />  of a voice that grabs you with the sweet, irresistible promise of a leather-lined love vise.  The<br />  timbre of his song will take you to a place that hurts so good you will never want to leave.  The<br />  band keeps it all grounded with straightforward, exceptionally tight crusty/warm rhythms that<br />  unobtrusively expand & explode in all the right places; moving with a natural grace from<br />  muscular guitar rock to epic, soaring cloud-float ballads to tasteful synth/keyboard based twists.<br />  The subtly epic songs carry a strong sense of sadness & despair that is bathed in a warm,<br />  inviting, gently edgy compassion--all greatly enhanced by the embracing depth and sincerity of<br />  Lanegan's grainy voice.  Gravel & grit have rarely been so welcoming.  There's an uncommonly<br />  compelling natural and honest beauty here that indicates the quality and value of these songs<br />  will only grow stronger.  Members have played with Screaming Trees, Queens Of the Stone Age,<br />  the Gutter Twins, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, the Eagles Of Death Metal.  Guest spots<br />  include members from the Afghan Wigs, the Twilight Singers, Masters Of Reality, Porno For<br />  Pyros, the Cult.  Overall, MLB recalls artists such as Barry Adamson, Phil Shoenfelt, Sivert<br />  Hoyem (Madrugada), Tom Waits, Nick Cave, Guy Kyser (Thin White Rope).  Pretty sure this one<br />  will find a home somewhere in the best of 2012 list.
B00007LTIA|4.0|I have to wonder if this album, when it came out, would have been better received if it only included the first two pieces on one album.  These are very strong and feel complete to me.  But the third and fourth pieces seem to detract from the first two.  I don't mind excessive musicianship, I listen to Yes because I want to be challenged...anyway, 4 stars for CD 1 :)
B0067LY4WG|4.0|Every new Leonard Cohen album is a reason for celebration, and this one is no exception.  At 77<br />  years of age, this is his 15th studio release.  His words, as always, are magical, enlightened<br />  beyond the realm of humanity.  Cohen's voice is comfortably weary & old, ripe & cracked with<br />  the wisdom, pain and spiritual gain of age.  Every utterance here is a deep and natural edict to<br />  \\"feel\\", born of a soul laid bare, a life fully lived.  This is the simple essence of art as it exists<br />  within itself; pure, unfettered, open.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Awesome, graphics and game so cool.  Love the gravity dynamics. Glad I purchased this game today. Do recommend it to everyone.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The first two were entertaining; perfect for a couple days of being home with a cold. But this third one? Skip it. It just drones on and on and the self indulgent whining reaches an unbearable crescendo. It all ends well, just don't pay to find out.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I have this game on my kindle fire and I got it ad the free app and I love it so much! I have almost completed the game and it never crashed at all!!!!!!!! GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are addictive. They are so well written, character development is beautiful, and the storminess is amazing. I read a sample of The Hunger Games because of the great reviews, but I bought it because by the end of the sample, i was already dying to know how Katniss's story ends. Between the hardships of her life in district 12, the reaping where she hears her sisters name picked to basically die in the games, the capital and president snow, the rebels, the romance and love triangle, not to mention her guts in the arena, I reread all three books 3 times in the past month. Then to find out it'll be a movie...buy these books. I cannot imagine how anyone can be disappointed.<br /><br />And one more thing I didn't realize in book two...looks can be decieving.  One of my favorote characters, two actually, are two that I disliked the most. Finnick and Johanna....well, I hate spoilers! Enjoy!
B006RUJST6|5.0|As an over 40 mom, I didn't expect to like this novel as much as I did.  I bought the book based on its many 5 star reviews but thought the age of the characters would make it less-relatable.  Ultimately, this story is about compelling PEOPLE navigating through love, crises (plural!) and ethics and I loved it. Very well written and I believe it should reach the 'tipping point' of mass exposure soon.  I also enjoyed its sequel.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I must say, I was surprised by this book. My finance got it for me, knowing my taste. When I found out its \\"interviews\\" with survivors from a zombie war, I was sure I would not like it. Then suddenly a few pages in, I was hooked. I read it in less than 48 hours. Max Brooks is ridiculously creative.  First the zombie survival guide and now this. I've only read maybe 2 zombie books I loved enough to reread. One was rise and walkand this is two. I highly reccomend this book.
B004UHSB5A|3.0|i really liked this app, but after uninstalling and reinstalling 3 times lately im over it. it also occasionally would overlap pieces and make strategic game play impossible.

B004VUP8WK|2.0|I was never a big Morbid Angel fan, but I was glad to hear that a new record of theirs was on the way. They said it might be \\"too extreme\\" for some people. I simply scoffed and thought, \\"meh, haters gonna hate.\\" Little did I know that the putrid disc that awaited me wasn't even worthy of the words too extreme. Rather, my first thought after listening to this record was TOO LAME! My god, it's so terribly cheesy, an ego trip of epic proportions lyrically and a pukey, rancid-green mix of death metal and techno/industrial sonically. It's enough to make even the hardest hardcore fan of the band want to cry. To be fair, though, a few parts did grow on me a tad and I did manage to find a salvageable riff here and there, and I do give them kudos for at least trying something new. Those to points alone are enough to raise it to the 2/5 rank in my book. On the whole though, I despise this record. Riffing is lazy, drumming is recycled techno/industrial schlock, and the lyrics are so piss-poor, I cringe at their very utterance, the way your mother did back when you were little and someone swore on the television. I do not recommend this record at all. AT ALL. Do yourself a favor and purchase any one of the previous 6 MA studio releases instead.
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|All of the positive reviews above are right on the mark.  Being a huge fan of the P-51D fighter plane of WWII, my favorite part of the movie was the strafing and bombing attack on the Japanese airfield by that \\"Cadillac of the Skies!\\"  I think Steven Spielberg has a love affair with that fabulous airplane as do I.  I would like to see more movies showcase it.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|Talk about a magnum opus! Annette seems to have finally found her place vocally in this new era of Nightwish. She comes across at full power and full range, able to alter her vocal style in the slightest ways to fit the mood of the music, which, by the way, is more varied, more dynamic, and more just-flat out well-written (arguably) than any previous Nightwish release! Storytime, the single, just might be one of the catchiest metal tunes of all time! Buy this record, buy it, and you will be far from disappointed...unless you have an irrational prejudice against a not-so-operatic lead vocalist, in which case, well, hatas gon' hate! 4.5/5!

B006QVRVJK|3.0|CARNAGE the award winning play by Yasmina Reza called variously `Le Dieu du carnage' or Gods of Carnage that did so well on Broadway and on tour (with more interesting casts) becomes (literally) `Carnage' in Roman Polanski's (and Yamina Reza's) adaptation for the screen.  It is more a revelation of human misbehavior than of comedy - unless the viewer finds a hour and fifteen minutes of seething loathing and bitterness funny.  The cast is a group of strong actors and should be able to makes this story work, but for some viewers it will be a frustrating waste of time.<br /><br />The plot has been summarized well: `In Brooklyn Bridge Park, eleven year old Zachary Cowan strikes his eleven year old classmate Ethan Longstreet across the face with a stick after an argument. Among the more serious of Ethan's injuries is a permanently missing tooth and the possibility of a second tooth also being lost. Their respective parents learn of the altercation through Ethan's parents questioning him about his injuries. The Longstreet parents invite the Cowan parents to their Brooklyn apartment to deal with the incident in a civilized manner. They are: Penelope Longstreet (Jodie Foster), whose idea it was to invite the Cowans, she whose priorities in life include human rights and justice; Michael Longstreet (John C. Riley), who tries to be as accommodating as possible to retain civility in any situation; Nancy Cowan (Kate Winslet), a nervous and emotionally stressed woman; and Alan Cowan (Christoph Waltz), who is married more to his work as evidenced by the attachment he has to his cell phone and taking work calls at the most inopportune times.' The one room (except for a bathroom and hallway) setting becomes more claustrophobic as the film presses on, making the childhood misbehavior of the incident between the two boys pale in comparison to the ruthless adult conflagration that results.  The dialogue is snappy, there is the requisite vomiting episode that seems to be a part of every film made these days, references to animal abuse, the repugnant misuse of cellphones, and the seemingly endless arguing becomes thuddingly dull by the end of the film.<br /><br />With so many truly fine, sensitive films available to watch, CARNAGE becomes its title.

B0058VW36U|5.0|I think think this game os amazing with all the other cut the ropes just and amazing game what do u think?
B003PIUBZS|4.0|This is where the Spartacus saga started before the sequels and prequels. It follows the story of Spartacus and what the Roman army does to him leading to becoming a gladiator. They really push the origin story of Spartacus by giving a whole episode on his life before and after what the Romans did, and after watching it you just want him to win and beat the Romans.<br /><br />As with the prequel I really enjoy the voice acting in this show. I feel as though all the actors fit in this time period, and it get really intense at times. The setting is really gritty and when they are fighting in the area it really lives up to the title name. As with the prequel, this has a TON of violence and \\"Relationships\\".<br />The soundtrack stays roughly the same for all three seasons, but I don't mind it due to fitting really well with what is going on. The theme song is pretty awesome and the battle themes make the action more exciting.<br /><br />I recommend watch this series first before the other two, but after watching the prequel to this series, it's cool to see all what happens in it take life in this and how it will lead to future seasons. Some of the people really annoy me in this show, but they get what's coming to them and it's glorious.<br /><br />I recommend this series to people who enjoy violence with a touch of drama. Batiatus, Spartacus, Crixus and so many others make up a great cast. Even though it has a ton of \\"Afternoon delight\\" scenes I still really liked the story of rising above tyrants with a bunch of violence thrown in.<br /><br />~ Written: March, 2012<br /><br />Positive:<br />* Tons of violence<br />* Great rise above story<br />* Great period voice acting<br />* Memorable theme song<br /><br />Negatives:<br />* May have too much \\"Relations\\" for some people<br />* Some CGI is noticeable
B004O3YGMC|3.0|No matter what device I use, I cannot type. Very frustrating. The connection is also very poor. Glad it was free when I downloaded.
B004HW7JMO|4.0|This is the prequel to the series Spartacus: Blood and sand and revolves around Gannicus and the rise of the house of Batiatus. I have seen the original series and I recommend watching that first, as this spoilers some of what happens during the show. It's also really cool to watch after seeing that season and seeing the build up to the start.<br /><br />It's defiantly not a kid's show at all. Debauchery, gratuitous murder and tons of cussing make up this gladiatorial story just like the first and second season. Some of the special effects are noticeable when people are getting killed, but trying to make someone's intestines being cut open is hard to do without making it feel unrealistic.<br /><br />The acting is really well crafted, and the accents don't sound fake at all. I have always been a fan of the medevil-ish accents so I really enjoyed hearing all the dialogue in this season. The sword play, crowd, and setting all sound realistic and really pull you into the action.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed watching this. I loved the first season, and it's nice to get some backstory on everyone from the first season and why they act the way they do.<br /><br />~ Written: March, 2012<br /><br />Positives:<br />* Awesome setting<br />* Extremely violent<br />* Well crafted dialogue with good acting to boot<br /><br />Negatives:<br />* Some CGI is noticeable
B00003CXA6|1.0|I became a fan of Jeff Daniels after his depiction of Chamberlain of the Maine 20th on Little Round Top; those were the strongest scenes (and they better be!) But the rest - I fast-forwarded through an hour and a half of speeches. Who could write this stuff? Or believe that tough-as-nails soldiers from that era would even speak such sentimental drivel? It comes down to a poorly written screenplay focused way too much on myth instead of insight. You end up with a movie that tells instead of shows. Cinema is always better, to paraphrase a Steve McQueen adage, when actors use their their facial muscles more than their vocal cords. Actors know what to do - with proper lines. The raw material was there but the mine was never dug. Maybe the scale was too large for the crucial details to emerge, but if you're going to take on Gettysburg, you better bring it.<br />I appreciate the volunteers' efforts, but many fill out their uniforms a bit much, an impossibility for the rebels after two years in the field fighting and evading the Union Army. Those guys should have been rangy sons of guns. A volunteer cast of thousands explains but does not excuse. At least some Confederates are shown marching shoeless.<br />Another detail: when Gettysburg's cannons fire they don't recoil backward. I noticed in Gods and Generals that the same director got around to correcting this. If there's no recoil (rifles included), then you're obviously firing blanks, a point I realize that's not appreciated by many, at least not consciously. If you're trying to create an impression of shooting to kill, then fool us into believing that something's coming out the barrel, especially with big guns.<br />I have come to the conclusion that the predominantly positive reviews of the film reflect the political split in this country. Many people prefer idealized (and insulting to the men who died) depictions maintaining an iconography of American history, instead of gritty portrayals of flawed humans that inspire and vicariously inform. And when I say inform I don't mean through declarations and cueing string music.
B004UXUX7S|5.0|Alexander Payne knows how to make a character-driven film. In his previous movies \\"Election\\" and \\"Sideways,\\" the good guys are inherently flawed and the villains have many virtues, but people constantly get themselves into trouble by making those little decisions that have major, unforeseen consequences.<br /><br />\\"Everything just happens.\\" The line heard in Payne's latest film, \\"The Descendants,\\" neatly sums up the writer-director's philosophy. Much happens to Matt King (George Clooney) in this movie, set entirely in Hawaii, where King's life is teetering on the edge of picturesque seaside cliffs. His thrill-seeking wife lies in a coma following a powerboat accident, and her chances of recovery are slim. The couple's 10-year-old daughter, Scottie (Amara Miller), rages against the world, and King is so feckless a dad that he turns to his 17-year-old, Alex (Shailene Woodley), for help, even though he has already sent her to boarding school to wean her off alcohol, drugs and men.  The other potential source of help, King's father-in-law (Robert Forster), blames him for the accident.<br /><br />King's family brings another huge piece of baggage: a piece of Hawaii's soul. The King family are Haole descendants of King Kamehameha's family (Haole is Hawaiian for honkey) and King's cousins have each squandered their vast inheritances. King has preserved his share by living a comparably frugal life and, understandably, he is the sole trustee of the family's once-vast trust. The trust owns one major asset, an unspoiled 25,000-acre plot of paradise on Kauai that most of King's cousins want to sell to a developer. Such a sale would infuriate most of the state, but Cousin Hugh (Beau Bridges) makes it clear that a few hundred million soothes a wounded conscience quite nicely.<br /><br />To top it off (as we saw in the movie's trailer), King learns that his wife has been cheating on him. And so it is we see King's point when he observes, \\"Paradise? Paradise can go . . .\\" (Well, you know.)<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"The Descendants\\" is about King's quest for redemption: as a father, a husband, and a Hawaiian. In a lesser movie, he would move smoothly through the steps of healing and emerge triumphant with a big speech announcing his hard-won wisdom. \\"The Descendants\\" does not take any easy shortcuts. While King wants to connect with his daughters, he doesn't have a clue how to do it. He, naturally, is also consumed with tracking down his wife's lover (Matthew Lillard) and finds an unlikely ally in Alex; this is hardly the traditional bonding experience for a father and daughter. Clooney, a nominee for a best actor Oscar, is a perfect choice to play King. Looking a bit more haggard than his normal Danny Ocean self, Clooney is as vulnerable as we've ever seen him. We believe it when he turns to his daughter's stoner boyfriend (Nick Krause) for advice.<br /><br />As usual in a Payne movie, all the performances are first-rate, and Shailene Woodley is particularly strong as the frustrated older daughter. Ultimately a comedy, \\"The Descendants\\" is a rich character study steeped in the romance of Hawaii. Gorgeously shot (I watched the high-definition Blu-ray) and scored with a charming Hawaiian guitar soundtrack, the movie stands proudly next to Payne's best work, and that's high praise.<br /><br />A healthy dose of extras include deleted scenes and several small documentaries, including an exploration of the real-life \\"Descendants,\\" an examination of the Hawaiian mystique, and a discussion with Clooney and Payne.<br /><br />Review originally published on MyDVDInsider.com.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Now THIS is an amazing book. I have only gotten to the story about the man who had zero short term memory but was still able to perform tasks because of his habits over the years. The Q&A in the description mentioned the Army Major, but I have to mention it here because it's a great story. By removing the food vendors, the crowd was forced to leave and get food before they were able to start rioting. It changed everything. If we relate these stories to our lives then we would be able to recognize something we need to change in our own situations, which would change other things around us. BUY THIS BOOK!!

B007G5K066|4.0|Alec Guinness and the 1979 BBC mini series are the gold standards in regards to George Smiley and the \\"Tinker, Tailor, Solder, Spy\\"-- but Gary Oldman and the 2 hour movie have made an admirable attempt to portray the essence of the John LeCarre novel.  The movie is well crafted and moves rather briskly through the key plot lines and intricate threads that Le Carre masterly weaved in his 1974 novel.  The bleak wintery  London of 1974 is effectively recreated and with the exception of a couple of location changes (Hungary instead of Czechoslovakia for the site of \\"Ellis'\\" betrayal and shooting and Istanbul instead of Hong Kong as the site of Rikki Tarr's encounter with Irina- and the elimination of the \\"Sam Collins\\" character)---the essense of the plot lines do remain intact in the movie.<br /><br />Considering that the BBC mini series did take 6 hours to tell its story---the movie still does fare quite well.<br /><br />This may be Oldman's best performance.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Saw this movie last weekend with my kids. Having read Edgar Rice Burroughs Mars (Barsoom) series I had big expectations. I was not disappointed. A grand adventure in every sense. This movie is at least a good as AVATAR, and is now one of my favorite Scifi movies. Will be getting the DVD as soon as it is available - and look forward to watching it again and again.
1250006341|5.0|Like thousands of others, I fell in love with the series, Downton Abbey. I'm glued to my seat with each season in anticipation to find out what will happen to these beloved characters. I love the upstairs characters as well as the downstairs characters. For those reasons and many others, I absolutely love The World of Downton Abbey by Jessica Fellowes.<br />This book is a behind the scenes look at the mesmerizing world that I can't get enough. The World of Downton Abbey is broken up into several chapters that dives deeper into the series such as: Family Life, Society, Life in Service and Style. Each chapter explores the historical significance of events that take place, beautiful photographs, quotes from the actors, as well as mannerisms of the era.<br />This is a great book for any fan of Downton Abbey to own. It's interesting as well as very entertaining. There is so much to learn about this period in time. Reading this book will help you get an insightful look at what it was to live in this era as well as the trials and tribulations of belonging to the aristocracy. I also love reading the actor's thoughts on the characters they portray.  This is definitely a book that I will read again and again.
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|I loved this film. From the casting (seriously Michael Fassbender as a femme fatale!) to the soundtrack (or the ingenious lack thereof in certain places) it was a top of the line \\"B\\" film. The dialogue was quick and in parts really funny, the acting all excellent, even from newcomer Gina Carano, the characters all interesting and not entirely what they seemed. The fights were delicious, the plot twists fun (and the holes easily ignorable) and the whole package a fine evening's entertainment. I can't wait for the DVD.
B004EN8KE2|1.0|Everyone's right about the reader, she is horrible, she sounds like an old woman and it's ridiculous to hear her read the male parts and at times she makes Peeta sound drunk, aloof, and stupid. Ugh ridiculous.
0439023521|5.0|I read The Hunger Games several months ago. I never wrote down my thoughts, because thousands before me already had, and I figured I probably didn't have much to add. Then I read and reviewed a bunch of other young adult dystopian fiction, some good, some \\"eh,\\" and came to the conclusion that if I'm going to judge all of them against The Hunger Games, then I should probably go ahead and review The Hunger Games.<br /><br />This is a review only of the first book.<br /><br />We all know by now what The Hunger Games is about. In a future version of the United States (now called Panem), the country has been divided into 12 Districts, each specializing in a different industry, surrounding a central Capitol. Years ago, the Districts rebelled against the Capitol. The Capitol prevailed, and as punishment for the rebellion (and as a deterrent against future rebellion), each year the Capitol forces each District to sacrifice 2 of its citizens - a boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 - to fight to the death in a barbaric gladiatorial arena for the amusement of the Capitol's citizens. One will survive. 23 will die.<br /><br />The decadent and pampered Capitol citizens, desensitized to the actual horror of what they are watching, view the televised Games as the height of entertainment, Olympics and action movies and reality TV all rolled into one.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the oppressed citizens of the 12 Districts live out a nightmare, as they are forced to watch their children mercilessly slaughtered on TV.<br /><br />And rebellion is out of the question. Each District is patrolled by Capitol-appointed \\"Peacekeepers,\\" there to make sure that they willingly send their Tributes and watch the Games like they're supposed to. To resist is to guarantee death - or worse.<br /><br />The heroine of the book is Katniss Everdeen, a 16-year-old girl who has managed to avoid the Hunger Games for the past 4 years. But that all changes when her 12-year-old sister, Prim, is selected to be this year's District 12 Tribute. Katniss, terrified for Prim, volunteers to take her place -- a decision which most likely guarantees a gruesome death.<br /><br />Katniss is shipped off to the Capitol to prepare for the Games, along with Peeta, the local baker's son. They are primped and polished, interviewed and pampered, and ultimately turned loose in the arena with the other 22 tributes.<br /><br />Every single one of them knows, if they are not prepared to fight to the death, they have no hope of winning. And a peaceful sit-in is not an option - the country is watching, and the Gamemakers will guarantee a good show, even if it means unleashing mutant wasps or raining down fire on the tributes.<br /><br />I will admit, I spent the first half of the book convinced Katniss would certainly find a way to rebel against the Games. Surely she wouldn't participate. Surely she wouldn't kill anyone. Surely she wouldn't fight Peeta. Surely something will happen to make it so that none of these children actually has to die.<br /><br />But Katniss doesn't go to the games to rebel. She goes to save her sister, and she goes to try to come back to her sister. Which means she has to win. Which means she has to participate. She's a 16-year-old girl in a world that has accepted the Games as a part of life for 3/4 of a century.<br /><br />Children do die in this book. It's horrible and terrifying and heartbreaking. You want to scream at the Gamemakers and Capitol citizens, \\"What's wrong with you?\\" The book gives a chilling look at the insensitivity that would turn a blind eye to the slaughter of children in the name of entertainment and tradition.<br /><br />It also gives us, in Katniss, a very flawed young girl. She is angry, stubborn and judgmental. But she is also fiercely loyal, protective, and determined. I don't agree with all of her decisions in the book. I was actually a much bigger fan of Peeta than Katniss. But I can admire her determination to do what she has to, to returnto protect her sister. She clings to hope, even when all seems lost. In the world she lives in, it seems like the only choice she has.<br /><br />As a parent, it saddened me greatly to think of a world where parents would be forced to send their children into a situation like this, and where children would be forced to endure this kind of brutality and despair. And if The Hunger Games was just a stand-alone story, I may not have given it 5 stars, even though it's an exciting and engrossing read. But it is the first book in a trilogy, and does an excellent job of setting up the world that Katniss and Peeta live in.<br /><br />The first book is sad. I cared about the characters, but I hated the world they lived in. I hated what they had to go through. It's upsetting. It's horrifying. It made me angry. And it's supposed to. If this is the feeling you're left with after the first book, it's not a sign to give up on the series. It's a sign you need to see where it goes.to protect her sister.

B0070R8WY2|4.0|I first learned of Sharon Van Etten when Rolling Stone had her listed as their \\"Artist to Watch\\" in a recent issue.  Amazon also has her included in their \\"Artists on the Rise\\" list.  While I have to admit that Tramp is a bit of an odd title for an album, Van Etten earns every bit of the accolades that she has gotten.  While her voice is not soft and mellow, it is captivating.  While Amazon has had \\"Serpents\\" available for free, I think this track is pretty middle of the road with respect to all the songs on Tramp.  The thing that is striking on many songs including \\"All I Can\\", \\"Give Out\\", and \\"In Line\\" is the rich vocal harmonies.  Though their voices are a bit different Van Etten's is a bit duskier), I can't help but think of Sheryl Crow's album Globe Sessions.  These songs are bluesy alt-rock at its best.  Tramp also has good lyrics.  Take the line \\"Like cigarette ash the world is collapsing around me.\\" from \\"Ask\\" as an example.  Van Etten does have room to grow.  The tracks \\"We Are Fine\\" and \\"Joke Or A Lie\\" didn't do a lot for me.  However, Tramp seems to have all the makings of a breakthrough album, and there is good reason that Amazon has her in their \\"Artists on the Rise\\".  If you loved discovering early Sheryl Crow, give this a try.<br /><br />Download this:  \\"In Line\\"
0312641893|5.0|This had such good reviews that I had to check it out, though I wasn't sure if it was a book that would interest me.<br />I'm really glad I did because this book grabbed me in from beginning to end. I loved the characters and was pleasantly surprised with the pacing of the romance, making the relationship between those characters more realistic and genuine to me as opposed to alot of books where it's instant love.<br />This is a very enjoyable read, one of my favorites in the young adult dystopians I've been sucked into lately. I highly recommend picking this one up, even if you're a little unsure like I was.

0930289234|1.0|Do you read comic books, or is it more of a looking thing? This is great if you've never had the chance to read any philosophy. It's philosophy is right there on the surface in a superficial way only a comic book could hope to do. But, as most readers probably have more of a background in dungeons and dragons and magic the gathering, the comic looks pretty intelligent. Wow, that blue guy is pretty detached, huh. I suggest skipping this and getting a real book where you might actually learn something if you read it.<br /><br />Sorry to be derogatory. As someone who reads real books seeing people heap this praise on a comic book is kind of absurd. If someone was that serious about their story I can only assume they would pick a different format. I know college age graphic artists will argue, but comics aren't going to be replacing Hemingway anytime soon. Old man and the sea would probably be better if there were small pictures and word bubbles everywhere.
1469984202|5.0|I just finished reading the Wool Omnibus, and I still haven't returned to the real world.  Hugh Howey (the author) created an amazing world, believable characters and a story that grabs you from the very beginning.  If you enjoy good story AND good writing, then please purchase this book.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|When I got this game it was fun, but then it got hard. This is my least favorite ab games but it was still kind of fun.
B006BZ8WAI|2.0|I loved the first self titled album. They had some good songs here and there after, but seems with last few albums, there just putting stuff out to pay the bills. The album art on some of the albums is amazing, too bad the music isnt as good as the album art.
B000002UT5|4.0|This a great CD with Richard's best song ever! I bought this CD for Right Here Waiting, and I was supprised on how good the other songs were and it's a must have for anyone.
1416589473|4.0|While I enjoyed the writing and the character styling of Ghosts of Ascalon, the story seemed to me to be a little incomplete. The ending while wrapping up this story arc was not an ending for a single novel, instead it left the reader wondering if there would be a sequel.<br /><br />I think the author stayed true to Arena Net's vision for Guild Wars and that they wrote a good story, I was just left a little dissatisifed with how they ended it.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|This is the best greatest hits of Guns N Roses out there. It has all there best from Appetite for Destruction and all other albums. This is a must have for any fan of Metal period.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I played this on Kongregate and liked it enough to complete. The idea is interesting and the game is weirdly engrossing... the app, however, sucks. Play this on your laptop or something if you're interested. At least on Fire the game gets unplayable fast.
0062107062|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  I have recommended this book as one that I am sure that my former embassy duty Marine friends will enjoy reading.  I have also sent and email to all my other retired service member friends as one they too will enjoy reading.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is the best app I have. The little monster is so cute! Get this app its worth it<br />=^.^=
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this game is awesome finnaly something fresh and new from angry birds totaly recommended and stop complaining of how its not free you bums! its a new game its not going to be free snap like that
0439023521|5.0|I loved this book, I ordered it so I could read the book before the movie comes out this weekend, and never thought I would of been so hooked. I read the book in two days, and just purchased the 2nd one. It has a great story, and hopefully the other two books are just as good!! I HIGHLY recommend this series!!
B006HGXGWU|4.0|I remember talking to a clinical person about someone we were both assisting.  I was really struggling to understand \\"schizotypal personality disorder.\\"  She was doing her best to describe the disorder when she finally said, \\"Have you ever seen Robert De Niro in Taxing Driver.\\"  Well of course I had and the lights came on immediately.  (I'm not endorsing that character as the best example of schizotypal disorder, but it helped.)    We live in a visual age and why not take advantage of that as we work to introduce people to mental illness?  Somebody said: \\"A picture is worth a thousand words.\\"  Take Shelter is a motion picture worth even more than that.  What fascinates throughout is we are not sure we're watching the emergence of paranoid schizophrenia or just the normal anxiety we all feel living in these times.  Is Curtis really sick or just overly sensitive to what we all know is coming?    The poet W.H. Auden wrote of the \\"Age of Anxiety\\" -    Faces along the bar  Cling to their average day;  The lights must never go out  The music must always play ...  Lest we should see where we are,  Lost in a haunted wood,  Children afraid of the night  Who have never been happy or good.    The unsettling sense we all live with is palpable in this film.  Curtis is a hero because he doesn't run from it; he is trying to understand it.  He visits a doctor and a therapist, reads a huge tome called Understanding Mental Illness, and visits his mother, diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenic twenty years earlier.  Perhaps he's inherited the family gene.  But the dreams persist, as do the storms he sees in the horizon.    Another layer to Curtis' personal agony is trying to care for his family.  While watching I kept asking myself; `What's wrong with going to extremes to care for your family?'  Nothing, of course, the task is only made that much harder with so little understanding and even less support.    Prophets and heroes are not always the sane ones.    This film is a masterpiecein portraying an emerging mental illness crisis.  It's also a fascinating character study of what many of us experience right below the surface.  I hope it might finally gain more appreciation for the service it performs.    [...]

B000I5SY5U|5.0|EXCELLENT MOVIE.  EXCELLENT PERFORMANCES.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL AGES.<br />A REAL CLASSIC.  NEVER OUT OF DATE. SHOULD BE ENJOYED BY ANYONE.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|My son (musician) & PCMag highly recommend this app. In fact, PCMag listed it in their top 40 for 2011. I have had less than perfect performance though. I've found that the slightest background noise will cause Shazam to not be able to find the music. I have not used it in a car with the stereo on or in a club. My attempts were to capture the song from a TV or movie playing in my living room and it's never been able to pick the music up, even when there's no talking in the room on on the screen. So - don't try this at home with your TV, wait for the credits or look up online the shows music. I have seen this perform perfectly every time for my son, in his car. When I ask what song is playing & who performed it and we can't rememeber, Shazam gets it every time. Since it's free - Go For It. Just be aware of it's limitations.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I recommend this movie to everyone, especially fathers.  When I viewed this movie, it was with a packed audience at a theater on a Friday night and when the movie ended, the whole theater audience gave a standing ovation.  Remarkable, and you don't see that kind of response everyday.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I really enjoyed this game but it was WAY too short! I finished it in under an hour. I actually thought I had just completed the first chapter or something and then discovered it was over. Very disappointing for an app that isn't free.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|It works and works great!<br />I'm using this on an old Dell Inspiron 2650 it has USB 1.1 and still was fast at locating.<br />Works with iGO8 for PC too. I have port=\\"4\\" baud=\\"4800\\".
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I enjoy playing to pass time and its free.....my son also enjoys it...haven't updated yet but we'll see... ... ...
0439023483|5.0|I'm not a big reader unless its Glamour Magazine or US weekly- i started to hear great reviews about the book & movie and decided to read it- i read all 3 books in 3 weeks! could not put it down.  BEST BOOK EVER!
B006P0FIB0|5.0|As soon as we got this movie my family and I watched it.  I was not expecting a whole lot of it but I have always loved The Three Musketeers and have watched almost all of the adaptations.  I was really impressed with this version.  Right from the start it captured me with the intro of all the musketeers, especially Aramis(sighs) ;)  There was a lot of action, romance, comedy, and drama to keep you entertain.  It may not follow the book exactly but it was good.  Everyone has their own opinion and I respect that, but I think give it a chance and have an open mind.
0307594777|5.0|These were books i could not put down.  Read all three.  Saw all the movies. They were good but loved the American version!!  Hope they do an American version of the other two!!  Too bad Steig Larsson died so young.  Would of liked to see what else he would of written about Lisbeth!!!
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This movie was really good, I absolutely LOVED it!! I know not everyone may not like this version but I say give it a chance.  I have seen previous versions of Persuasion and I have loved every single one of them but to me this one is a little more emotional that when you seen Anne cry you want to cry with her (The only other version I feel this way with Anne is the 1995 one)  And Capt. Wentworth is really handsome and you feel the pain he feels aswell and even when he acts indifferent towards Anne we know he is only doing that out of anger yet he still shows her kindness.  This version is a keeper for me and hope you guys give it a chance.  Happy viewing! :)
B0000A118M|5.0|As a relative newcomer to jazz, the first instinct is to get Miles' \\"Kind of Blue\\". The very next album, is this. Yes it's that good. A refreshing sound that starts with the first few bars of 'Acknowledgement'. \\"A Love Supreme\\" is a necessity for any jazz enthusiast.
0802473156|5.0|This book was exactly what I was looking for.  It's amazing how after years and years of marriage, this book could still shed some insight into how to make it even better.  Easy read; in fact read the whole thing as soon as I picked it up. This book would be good for struggling relationships (even with friends and children) and just to improve an already great relationship.  I have recommended it many friends already.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Buying the Trilogy set is the best way to read the Hunger Games Trilogy. The series itself is great and I was able to enjoy it uninterrupted because of the Trilogy set.
B001OD6HO0|5.0|The product arrived at the time that they had said to me. I am very thankful because the product is beautiful and very especial and in great conditions. Thank you very much! I reccommend.
B005GSVFAK|4.0|I thought it contain Toy Story 1/2/3 but it only has Toy story 1.  However the 3d is uncanny perfect picture.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I loved this book.  It is an easy read with a great love story. It reminds me if the twilight saga only this is definitely not young adult.
B006YXTRHY|4.0|So much fussing over a story people! I like the film for the most part; fun to see the characters on their journey, and it's very pretty and sweet until the birth scene, which is well, horrid as it should be. Main complaint: The music is totally annoying and distracting: Too sappy! I found myself rolling my eyes and fast forwarding, which is an insult to the actors. But I liked the books and enjoy seeing how they figure out how to put it on the screen. A fun romp of a crazy love story. That's all!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Lots of variety in games. You can always find something that you want to play at that moment in time.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game so do all my friends I have over 100 gems and I didn't even buy any that AWESOME
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I JUST LOVE THIS GAME! I GOT UP EXTRA EARLY TO DOWNLOAD MY KINDLE N RAZR.  YES IT COST FOR KINDLE BUT WORTH EVERY PENNY! ANDROID IS FREE. GET THIS GAME.  THANKS FOR MAKING A OLD LADY FEEL LIKE A KID IN HEART... I LOVE TERRENCE!!!
0525478817|5.0|I just finished reading this book. I have read many of the reviews and can't add anything more to what has been said except that I also laughed and cried, especially cried. I just had to add my 5 stars. Thank you John Green for Hazel and Augustus. I won't forget them anytime soon!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|If you loved the other games you'll enjoy this one. Love the special effects and the gravity effects. Rovio you guys nailed it again A+.
1878424114|5.0|The writings of this book resonate deeply with my own self & are highly practical although spiritual. Deepak Chopra has written it intelligently and scientifically. A must read for anyone into metaphysics.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this is one of the best games rovio has ever made so much FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would have given it a * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * if I could!!!!
B006H3MIV8|5.0|I don't mean this to be a full review of the music. Mr. Davis and others have already done a fine job in that respect.<br /><br />Rather, this is a clarification of a possible point of confusion. When you first receive this album, it may initially seem as though you've received a single CD in a standard plastic jewel case. This is in fact a complete set of four  different CD's. The case uses a fold over design of thin paperboard, so it folds up into the space of a single CD case.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a great compilation for a good cause of songs from a legendary songwriter/artist. Anyone who treasures the respect that these pieces pay to Bob Dylan will love this set whether or not you agree with each and every interpretation. This is highly recommended.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this app, especially the audio portion!  Just the first two chapters I've already learnedly something I didn't know.  Like there were two trees. The Tree of Life &amp; The Tree of Good &amp; Evil.
B000W4E3OS|5.0|These are wonderful performances, recorded vividly. Scriabin is like Chopin on steroids (or maybe mind-enhancers). I have the Sudbin solo CD recital, which seems to be the modern-day benchmark. These live up to that, and go WAY further. For the complete Scriabin solo piano experience, this is the way to go; top shelf, no bargain skimping here. This is it. Add the Sudbin to this and you have added the icing to a very large and totally engaging cake.
B0063IH60K|5.0|the title of my review pretty much says it all!! if you love solitaire you'll love this one! there are things that pop up between games asking if you want to play other types of solitaire, but just hit no if you don't want to. not gonna change my review either way. great solitaire app!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app and its free. I am loving th.e devotionals. I also love the audio Bible part. It reads to me.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|You need to make a free version of angry birds space because people might not want to pay so just make a FREE VERSION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|It was another gorgeous day here in the Northeast and my husband and I were out for a stroll with our babies. As I looked at them in their pram...um...I mean stroller, I burst out laughing. I really couldn't help it. When my husband asked the reason, I said, \\"don't the kids look adorable in their pram?\\" Needless to say, he looked at me as though I had a screw or two loose. I mean if you're going to write books about an American college girl going to school in America you have to say stroller, not pram. And that was just one of the many, many words that we don't use here in the good old USA. You know the saying that goes something like, \\"when in Rome, do as the Romans do\\" Well, here's a suggestion - when you write about Americans who live in America, please let them speak the American way.
B000002VSN|5.0|Had I not already heard portions of the C D I would like to have heard at least one of the songs before purchase.After recieving the C D & played it entirely & I was more than satisfied with it.This was my first purchase from Amazon & I will purchase other materials based upon how my purchase was handled.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Games were uninteresting.  I don't recommend getting this app.  And you don't get the 101 games right away, you have to earn them by getting points on the 10 games you do get.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|game was way to short. really good concept but leaves you wanting more. needs like five more levels<br />. was looking forward to this game but was kind of bummed.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I cans not believe its not free wow what is the matter I don't want it to be in HD :/ :%
B00632HWOG|5.0|This app works just like the mail you get on your laptop.  Using the Kindle Fire, I now can travel lighter and still receive my yahoo mail.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|its awesome love how handy it is. I'm in college right now and I use it for school, personal journal writings and devotional writings as well. I love how I can access anything any where - I LOVE it. ;)
0440237688|5.0|I first read this fascinating book in sixth grade and have reread it many time sense. I see different things in different points in my life and I get something new out of it every time. This book makes you think of what the world would be like without inconveniences and how someone always has to bare them. It's about a special society that has removed all of that and one person who remembers a time before everything good and bad was taken... It's really an incredible book and a must read for people of all ages. This is a great book to sit down with your middle schoolers or high schoolers and read together. There is some pretty deep stuff.
0307593312|4.0|I had read many of the reviews before writing this. In fact, I almost did not read the book.  But I began to do just that and it pulled me into the story.  I got caught up in the lives and thoughts of the key characters and kept wanting to find out \\"NOW what's going to happen to Tengo or Aomame or Ushikawa?\\"<br /><br />The details in the story (specifics of a meal, for example) were both interesting and yet seemed irrelevant to the plot.  Keep in mind this is a translation from Japanese.  While there are many references to Western culture, it is still told from an Asian perspective, and this also kept me interested. I'd never read anything before by this author, so I really had no preconceived idea about his writing style.  I'd call it minimalist, which I'd also say is very much part of the Japanese culture--certainly not at all like ours.<br /><br />Some criticized the over emphasis on breasts or physical traits.  So, when you look at someone, you don't think about their physical attributes? It seemed a very human action to me...if you tapped into the thoughts of men looking at women, I would bet their thoughts would be similar.  Women look at other women and often silently judge their make up, hair, clothing styles, weight, etc.  Like I said--very human.<br /><br />There are probably many layers to the book--if I had another 6 weeks to read it again, I might discover layers I never knew were there when I read it the first time.  It is not your typical mystery or sci-fi or fantasy, so just go with the flow of the book and don't try to second guess what will happen. You'll probably enjoy it better that way!<br /><br />Once I had finished the almost 1000 pages, the main characters were so intertwined in my life that I missed them.  Spend 6 weeks with any group of people and you might feel the same way!  I don't think I'd like to read a sequel, though. I will say the ending was sort of anticlimactic. It was probably the weakest part of the book from my perspective.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I have played it on my ipad and its awesome but it wont let me buy it. Please tell me if you have any ideas why its not working.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This show is great in all ways. Many people do not like all the nudity and sex scenes, but that was part of their culture during those times. Game of Thrones is not boring like people say it was.  There were many action scenes and cliff hangers at the end of each episode.  Can't wait until season 2. Haters GTFO. HOUSE TARGARYEN FTW
0439023513|4.0|I love this series from start to finish. This book was kind of a letdown. I cried about 10 times :(. You would think that all that tragedy is followed by a happy ending, but sadly everyone you think would make it, dies or is mentally unstable. Maybe I'm use to all the books with happy endings, but this is the sad reality that we face. Otherwise, great book, but if they make a movie out of this, I won't see it, too sad.
1936594528|2.0|A very difficult slog: this was written by an 18th-century woman, for 18th-century women (not even 19th!) And it was not even popular in its day.  Few modern day woman would enjoy this book, and even, far, far fewer modern day men.<br /><br />Basically plotless (excepting cliches) and almost totally irrelevent to the modern reader (who marries for position nowadays?)  The only value of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" at all is in its prose, but, here anyways, its quality is not high enough to be a saving grace.  This was a stepping stone, but it is from here, next to the Bronte sisters, then to George Elliot before we get something half-tolerable to read, if we are reading for pleasure.<br /><br />Austen's prose is better than average, but it is not the perfect syllable/phenome-diction of some others.  And there is nothing -- absolutely nothing else.  In one scene, Austen attempts humor by poking fun at some random male character's superficiality, but her only effect is to highlight her own.<br /><br />If you have ever struggled with a Victorian era novel, you will be surprised here, by how much worse it can get.  Though published in the early 19th century, this book was basically written in the late 18th century.  Some 18th century books are readable, like \\"Robinson Crusoe.\\"  Some are even, in part, very good, like \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" or \\"The Wealth of Nations.\\"  But the hit percentage was very low back then.  The competition of years, of each author trying to do better than his or her influences or predecessors, had not really developed back then.  There wasn't much evolution or refinement of entertainment back then because the market had yet to develop.<br /><br />Jane Austen not only never saw a movie, she probably never dreamed of one.  She was writing in an agrarian age, before the invention of the steam locomotive or the telegraph.  She probably had no conception of an edited, plot-driven story.  Indeed, though the world she was living in was more similar to ancientworld than ours, I would rate not one but several thoroughly ancient books as being far more meaningful and entertaining.<br /><br />I will be the first to admit most modern popular books are trash, but though this may be slightly better written, it is as superficial and brain-destroying as anything on the NYT's bestseller list.  There is not a single scene of imagination, nor one character you can root for.  I actually saw someone lulled to sleep by the reading of \\"Jane Eyre.\\"  No doubt, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" would put him in a coma or in an early grave.
1442419814|3.0|This seems like a good young adult book, but not as mind blowing as I'd thought it'd be based on reviews.  I do love some books like the Hunger Games which are also considered YA, but this book didn't really surprise me at any time.  I'm glad I read it, but it was a bit meh--the general plot/characters seems pretty overused as well as the whole 'pretty inside' take away--thus I think it's really geared more towards kids/much younger crowd than expected that haven't been jaded yet :)
B005723JSQ|5.0|I love Sophie Kinsella's books. I can readily identify with each character. Keep up the good work! I look forward to future books.
0385737947|4.0|The first few chapters of this book reminded me of one of my favorite movies, The Cube. Not just reminiscent, but nearly word for word, picture for picture from the opening scene. This was frustrating, and I almost quit listening to it because of that. However those similarities went away as the book went on.<br />The narrator was good, he handled the characters voices well - which some audio books surprisingly do not do that well.<br />At the beginning of the book, Thomas wakes up in a cubed shape room. A door opens from the ceiling and a group of teenage boys pull him out of the cube. Here he realizes that they are stuck in a maze, and all of the boys (himself included) have had their memories wiped of previous experiences. They have no real idea where they are or what they will find at the end of the maze. It also becomes apparent that Thomas may have a skill to help them navigate the maze.<br />The language is similar to that of Across the Universe (Beth Revis) - a lingo where they make up non-cuss words. (Frex, Frexing from ATU.) \\"Shuck Face\\" for example in the Maze Runner. Another example, instead of \\"That's Good\\" they say \\"Good that\\".<br />I did like that everything made sense, it wasn't a stretch to believe. It's nice to see a book written by a guy, for young male readers with action, mild-violence and some level of \\"cussing\\".<br />There was quite a bit of action throughout the book, and I enjoyed it. There are quite a few plot twists, and the ending isn't overly predictable. I do plan on reading the next book in this series. I think this would be a good book to get younger boys to read, I wish I'd had a book like this back in high school when we were required to pick a recreational book. There is plenty of action, the chapters are short and quick and it keeps your attention.
B007B8GI28|5.0|As always, my episode purchase was flawless. The ease replaying at any time is a splendid bonus! I will definitely continue to purchase episodes as the need arises in the future.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|This game is a fantastic time waster, but it consistently crashes my Droid 2.  Absolutely every time I play it, between 5 and 10 minutes later, it locks up and takes the phone down with it.  At least I got it for free.
B0000062Y2|5.0|This was a great movie when it came out, along with great music. The soundtrack is very good. No regrets buying it.
1932100660|2.0|Very disappointing. From the title, I expected this book to consist of statistical results and an objective analysis of a large quantity of data obtained from the aforementioned \\"China Study\\". There is not much of that here. The author continually harps on his own experiment in which lab rats were given a known carcinogen with and without protein added. I get the distinct impression that he has cherry-picked much of his data to support his own conclusion, which is that all animal protein is bad for your health and that optimally we should all be vegans. Those who follow the vegan lifestyle will love this book, which is a paean to veganism. Ovo-lacto vegetarians may not like it so much, because the author mostly condemns eggs and dairy products as well as the meat, fish, and poultry that are components of a balanced diet. That's not to say that most Americans don't consume too much animal fat and refined carbohydrates, but this author, in my opinion, takes his crusade against animal foods too far, on questionable evidence.  Before you jump into a high-fiber diet full of whole-grains, balance your reading with research from another viewpoint, such as these (for a start): \\"Fiber Menace\\" by Konstantin Monastyrsky, \\"Wheat Belly\\" by cardiologist William Davis, and \\"Dangerous Grains\\" by James Braly, M.D.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book was alright although I have to say it was probably the most drug out of the series. It takes nearly half the book just for anything aall that interesting to happen and the intro period was wayy to long causing the end to be very much rushed, No I am not wanting a fairytale or twilight book however, you can't build up all this story just to end it in an emotionless war.<br />  The book however did have great cliffhangers leaving you hanging off every word once you get into it it's just getting to that point that takes forever. Also I feel the ending was very rushed in the last few pages making for a semi cheesy end. I dont think the offer took this book to its full potential yet, it still is a decent finally and I would still recommend it.
0385342063|5.0|This book is extremely funny and engaging and I was so sad when it ended. I am hoping there is going to be a sequel, but not as many as Shopaholic (as they became less funnier and less funnier). This book had me laughing out loud so many times, that I was overjoyed. I loved Poppy and I loved Sam and was even glad for 'The Graduate' type ending.<br /><br />The only issue I had with the book was that it did seem to drag on a little towards the end but all is forgiven because this was Sophie Kinsella at her best!!!
B005723JSQ|5.0|Poppy lost her engagement ring, and while searching for it, she managed to lose her phone also. She picks Sam's phone from a garbage bin, and the story starts.<br /><br />Poppy is a lovely creature and you can't stop yourself from falling in love with her, she does some stupid things and sometimes reminds me of a more mature Becky Bloom, but overall she is great. As the book starts, we are presented to her as she is just engaged and feeling just like most women do at that time in their lives: perfectly in love and happy. As you read on you start to see some cracks in the perfect relationship she has with her fiancé.<br /><br />Sam is the picture of a leading man. Poweful, handsome, generous...<br /><br />Kinsella gets you to care about these people, she makes them seem alive, and you read the book as you are accompaning the story of dear friends. Overall, I would say that this book is my idea of a fun weekend read!
B001QB9H10|4.0|I'm new to this series. Jason Statham is a new figure to me. He has only one schtick: neutral mug at all times, hoarse whisper of all of his lines, and periodic eruptions of violence in which we see his well formed six pack in action. None of the action is the slightest bit realistic. But that's not the point. We watch because we wish we could do the supernaturally muscular things we see done on screen. Never mind the boring details of plot or script. Whatever. Think James Bond, updated. The red head co-lead is all moistly sexy, and I liked her Ukrainian accent, despite myself. The bad guys lose in the end. Does that spoil it for you? Sorry.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAMEE IT IS SOOOOO AMAZING!!! :) this game is amazing! it is so fun and a good time waster if you have nothing else to do. ignore all of the bad reviews. the only bad thing about this game is when you are trying to match them together sometimes it picks up the wrong one but oh well.
B000002UJQ|5.0|My brother gave me a bootleg copy of this album about six years or so ago. He couldn't contain his displeasure for the album! After one listen, it immediately became my favorite album of the genre of all time. The album plays like a cascading narrative of social angst, and save for one song that could have potentially been a pop hit, this is a rock work of art. It is rare that an album speaks to the moment, but is simutaneously timeless. Thom Yorke evokes powerful emotions through his higher-pitched balladeering. This is expressed as another wonderful highlight of the album, as the instrumental arrangement perfectly blend with the spirit of each track. Please, don't listen to the samples; do yourself a favor and give this entire album a listen. Individual tracks, let alone any snippet, will not give the justice due to this classic piece. Honestly, I'll have to give this a 10 out of 10.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I got the free preview chapter and have read some 3 or so pages.  I started reading this stuff out loud to my roommate because the writing is so bad it's funny when read aloud.  \\"I rolled my eyes at myself.\\"  $9.99 ????  Are you kidding me?  There are authors on this site selling their self published e-books for 99 cents that are way better writers.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I really didn't expect to be impressed by this game, but it is really a lot of fun and hard to put down. I have had no issues so far on my kindle fire. very clever game!
B0078JOAOI|5.0|I'm catching back up right now on the series. This episode was my latest on that journey. I enjoyed it. I was thrilled with the farm scene, and Rick's wife makes some really stupid choices considering how intelligent she is represented as being, but those are minor gripes. Regarding the latter, it seemed obvious that her latest mishap was written in to bring about the end of her pregnancy. Dunno yet though. The bar though, that's really where this episode was at. I felt it did a great job at showing how despondent and hopeless things can seem. It also showed that regardless of circumstances, there are just simply some good people and some bad ones. Rick reclaimed some of his swagger there. Also, i really loved that they closed the episode with \\"Regulator\\" by Clutch. That is by far one of my all time favorite songs.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Cool games, way too many ads.  Got to click out of ads after every game.  Get rid of all the ads and it gets 4 1/2 stars.
B000FC11A6|3.0|Stephenson holds something of a sacred position in geek circles. This novel is one of the reasons for that. Which is why I find myself a bit disappointed.<br /><br />The scale is quite phenomenal telling one conspiracy over two generations from World War II to then present day (late 90s) while covering the cryptography and the invention of the digital computer at the same time.<br /><br />But that's a large part of the problem. There are times when it just feels like the author is indulging in a lecture on a favorite subject rather than telling a story. For anyone who isn't fascinated in the details of cryptographic systems (or the exact relationships of the greek pantheon), this must be rather dull.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, despite being an incredibly long book (the plot doesn't even really start connecting between the two eras until half way through) Stephenson still jumps over key segments choosing to tell us about what happened instead of showing us.<br /><br />Things meander all over the place. Backwards and forwards in time. With the coincidences piling up well beyond the point of credibility, so you just have to sort of shrug and go with it. Really did neither Root or Goto Dengo have anything to say to Douglas Shaftoe? And what even was the point of the Andrew Loeb sub-plot at all?<br /><br />We are presented with lots (and lots) of characters but many of them seem interchangeable. Women come off particularly badly. There are only a handful and they are all essentially dismissed as irrelevant to the plot and short of character.<br /><br />All of which I can almost forgive because the cryptography and computer subject matter is so fascinating to me. I particularly liked the World War II segments. But even there I had trouble due to Stephenson's decision to so casually mix truth and fiction. I would rather he had stuck purely with fact really.<br /><br />So in the end I have to call this overrated. There is some fascinating subject matter, but as a story it really doesn't hang together.tory it really doesn't hang together.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have always liked this game. I played it on my computer and I really like to be able to take it around in my kindle. The fact that it's free makes it even better!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the first book that I have read by this author.  I was not sure if I was going to like reading a book about teenagers with cancer but I truly enjoyed it.  It was easy to relate to the characters and their snarky attitudes.  I can't wait for the movie!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I wasn't planning on reading this book because I was concerned it would be another young adult book that focused on a love story, like a certain series about vampires, which I haven't read, nor ever will. However, my wife wants to see the movies and to be fair I figured I should read the books before seeing the movies. I knew enough before reading the book that it was about a love triangle and was worried that the book would focus on a love story, which I don't find interesting if it's the focal point of the book. My wife insisted the love story wasn't the focus of the book so I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />When I was halfway through the book, I thought it was great and actually shed some tears in regards to Katniss and Rue, which I won't give away, but that scene was just heart wrenching. If the 2nd half of the book had continued in the same manner as the first I would have given it 5 stars, but sadly it didn't. Shortly after that Katniss and Rue scene, when the Capital decided to change the rules, the story started to unravel, specifically because it bean to focus on the love story. First off, when you establish rules, you don't change them, it leads to the reader losing vested interest since rules can change. And that's what happened to me, but it was even worse when the rules changed AGAIN at the end of battle.<br /><br />The love story that began to develop in the second half of the story just felt so contrived. Somewhat believable from the viewpoint of Peeta, but not so from Katniss. The kissing and petting scenes just seemed so forced and there seemed absolutely no connection from Katniss, even though she seemed to waffle back and forth at times questioning her feelings for Peeta. Katniss overall just seemed devoid of emotion. Other than her father, Prim and Rue (who reminded Katniss of her sister) she doesn't seem to have any emotions for anyone, not even Gale.<br /><br />I was so disappointed at the turn of this book, that at 80% of the way throughthe Kindle edition I thought that with 20% remaining it had a chance to redeem itself but unfortunately it never did.<br /><br />So overall, it was a great first half of the book but it was unable to carry that intensity to the end. I really enjoyed Haymitch throughout and really look forward to seeing Woody Harrelson portray him in the movie. Absolute perfect casting!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app a lot ,it's great to spend time when you are bored.I would give this ten stars if I could.It's not boring ,it's great!!!!GET THIS APP!!!!
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Really easy. Without a guide, I managed to prefect world 1, all 5 secret levels, and have about 15 stars left in world 2. Kind of surprising, since the first game seemed so long.
B007N85POS|5.0|Rio is amazing, but it already has amazing graphics on the (if they have one) free and .99 cent version. 4.99 is absouloutly RIDICULOUS!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this app. it helps the time pass.especially when I'm on break at work or on long car rides.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|The gravity zones may seem weird at first, but you'll get used to it. And when you do, this game is the best! For the first time, you can see the HD, and the game is just all out epic! WORTH 2.99!!!!!!
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I originally got this because it was the only calendar app that synced with Google on the Fire. And it works great. But since then I began using it on my phone as well. It has a better workflow than the other calendar apps I've tried. Well worth the fee.
B004J4WKUQ|1.0|The fact that this book has been generating such buzz is disappointing to say the least. It reads like a high school creative writing project. The sentences are without artistry or weight. The author seems to have never heard the writing advice, \\"show don't tell,\\" as even key plot developments are dropped into paragraphs with as much finesse as \\"I took the bus to work today.\\" Information is withheld from the reader for no conceivable reason other than to create tiny pockets of anxiety. We're not talking about normal crafting of narrative, but plainly obvious reader manipulation. In one important episode toward the end of the book, the protagonist is trying to escape from detention, feverishly preparing, only to finally admit that he'd actually been working on it for days and had completed a handful of impossible tasks that he didn't bother telling the reader about, so there really wasn't any reason to worry. It is clumsy, unforgivably amateurish writing.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that there really aren't any characters other than the protagonist, Wade, a.k.a. Parzival. If a writer needs to withhold information for the sake of drama, usually he can make use of another character and his motives to that end. In the case of this novel, though, Cline has written all such possibilities out by the middle of the book. Without the involvement of other characters, all we really have is someone regaling us with the tale of his World of Warcraft raid from last night... for 200 pages or so. Perhaps that's not fair, though, since at least WoW has rules, something the OASIS, the MMORPG at the heart of Ready Player One, does not, meaning that any problem can be solved with an anime-level deus ex machina. The text is littered with magical items that wink into existence when Cline needs them to, with little more introduction than \\"we got this thing on this OASIS quest that does this cool thing so it was no problem.\\"<br /><br />Although they are of little narrative use for much of the story, there are a handful of characters. There is Parzival's best friend Aech, who until a rather ham-fisted twist at the end is little more than the standard sidekick dude. There is Art3mis, Parzival's love interest, who seems neither particularly lovable nor interesting. There is Og, the Steve Wozniak of the OASIS, who appears as one of the final fix-alls toward the end. There is Sorrento, a faceless suit looking to take over the OASIS, and who, for some reason, murders people who are unnecessary to the plot. And finally, there are the twin Japanese caricatures Daito and Shoto.<br /><br />Daito and Shoto deserve special criticism, since their depiction as Japanese characters is so ignorant as to border on racist (and I am giving Cline the benefit of the doubt there). Not only are these characters interchangeable, but they are little more than an Orientalist fantasy of the inscrutable Asian. They work together and say little. They use words like \\"honor.\\" They affix \\"-san\\" to everyone's names. They do not seem to understand shaking hands, and bow instead. They sit seiza. When one dies, the other avenges his death in a kamikaze-type attack. As a longtime resident of Japan, I was not only frustrated by the ignorant portrayal of modern Japanese teenagers as some kind of samurai fantasy, I was embarrassed for my home country of the US if any Japanese people were to read this garbage. I could, of course, discuss at length the inaccuracies in Cline's imagination of Japan and the Japanese language, but suffice it to say that these \\"two\\" characters are the most troubling aspect of this entire mess of a book--poor storytelling is one thing; racism is another.<br /><br />Overall, this is very possibly the worst book I've ever read, and that includes The Da Vinci Code. I know that it is intended to be cheap escapism instead of high art, but when high art--even science fiction--is also just a click away, I do not understand why anyone would choose Ready Player One. Itis utter trash.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I have a question. Why cant rovio entertainment Ltd. make a paid version with 0.99$ like usaul? that's.my question. I think this.game is great anyways
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this app is a HUGE improvement to Angry Birds and Angry Birds Seasons!<br />There are planets instead of ground and big gravity spheres that directs birds different ways<br />Also new bird: Ice bird is awesome
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Love it! Turn it up loud and enjoy the mixture of those perfectly matched voices and the talents of their incredible musicians.
B000IFSDZQ|5.0|I think this is a great box set , lots of songs that I haven't heard plus all the \\"hits\\".  There are a few songs that I wish would have been included , but overall a very good collection.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I love Yahoo mail, but this app is painfully slow on the kindle fire.  Also, the delete function needs to be quicker.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. The gravity fields make it cool. If you like Angry Birds, you need this game.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I bought this headset on sale, been using it for a while now. It's a great product.<br /><br />Pros: Comfortable, great audio quality (can be adjusted both in PC and by the mic itself), clear voice output.<br /><br />Cons: None so far.<br /><br />It's great. If you find it at a good price, get it.

B004GJDQT8|1.0|Our biggest reason for using the Appstore was to share programs between my Droid RAZR & my Kindle Fire. Previously we used the Google Play (Market). Amazon content is repeatedly weeks, or months, behind Google's similar content. Often, in-app purchases are broken between devices on Amazon - such as the Cranky update which works on my Fire, but not on my RAZR. Amazon's technical support is horrible, telling me to reformat my phone (which I did) but it didn't make any difference. Now, Amazon makes you buy the same content twice for Fire vs. other Android devices - like Angry Birds Space or Cut the Rope Experiments, locking out programs from certain devices. (Therefore you must buy it twice, often at a higher price.)<br /><br />Overall, a VERY dissatisfied Amazon customer. We can't merge accounts, share content, etc. (Have a different account that has Prime on it, but can't bring them together!) As nice as the Fire was to begin with, the Appstore is part of the experience, and these major failures and the inability to Enterprise manage our devices means I will not buy more nor recommend them to others.<br /><br />After investing in the Fire, since I can't get at the content I need, my next step is now to start exploring how to root and re-rom the device, so that rather than using the Appstore I can get applications elsewhere. I feel very much like you have STOLEN from me, Amazon. You are changing the terms of our agreement after I have bought in. That doesn't seem to bother you either. It is NOT your right.
B000FC12C8|5.0|I'd recommend this book to anyone wanting to understand the basics of value investing. The book is a classic edition to any value oriented investor.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I bought the app and I go to install it and it tells me there is an error and ive been waiting for a game as cool as this for a long time
B004Y1WCDE|3.0|I use this app on my phone and it's great.  It's just nor ready for the kindle fire yet. Video is very laggy, to the point that it's barely watchable.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Does everything well and with no bugs. The syncing works flawlessly and the User interface is very well done. I just wish the new note button was a little larger.
B007N5YJYS|5.0|This is by far the best of the several movies made from the original novel. A man meets a woman who says she is being followed by men who are trying to kill her. He takes her to his apartment where is is in fact killed by unknown assassins. The only clue is \\"the 39 steps\\". Falsely accused of her murder he escaped and follows the clues to unmask the mystery. Excellent story, script, and acting. Criterion has done it's usual excellent job of bring this classic to DVD. Do NOT miss this one if you are a fan of British mysteries.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This excellent game does't work on Motorola's Xoom (First Version) with Android 4.0.3, just when the game starts and after some minutes of playing the game stops unexpectedly. Please develop some new release fixing this issue.<br />Thanks...
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Suzanne Collins should apologize and thank Koushun Takami for making money off his concept. Hunger Games is a blatant rip off conceptually of Koushun Takami's Battle Royale. Case in point: 1)Teenagers forced to fight to the death. 2)The government has almost the exact same motives for having the games, and 3)guy and girl survivor. There are also lots of other little things that are very similar. most of the differences in story telling are simply cultural, Japanese vs western. The only major differences are how the kids are kept in game area, sponsors, and how kids are choosen.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a good game I don't what the people are doing who say they cant figure out how to play each game because when you click on a game to play and then click on the? it will tell you how to play.  this game(s) can be challenging and has games for every taste. I reccomend getting it.
6304196784|4.0|Yes, it is vulgar, coarse, crude, stupid--but it is full of spirit and fun, for teenagers of all ages. Excellent acting, infectious farce, politically incorrect disgrace, but at least not boring.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game. Spider is addicting and a wonderful way to spend some free time. The price is right free.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Starts slow, ends strong with a wonderful message for responsible men, men who want to make a difference in their famiies, their friends and their work place and church and to help bring up responsible children.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|love the new birds and the twists of gravity.  my kids are already obsessed with the new bird characters and am sure they will have to have all the merchandise.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I loved the first two books in this triology, and the first half of this final edition. However, the ending just ruined the whole series for me. Its rushed, very unsatisfactory, leaves a lot unexplained, and destroys any good feelings you might have had about the characters and what they were doing. It really ruined the whole series for me. Had I known from the beginning, I probably wouldn't have let myself get emotionally invested in the plot of the first two books. This book gets two stars only because I actually liked the first half of it.
0440237688|5.0|The book The Giver is an awesome book and should be read by all. There are many twist in this book, and is sometimes hard to understand. But it is a very well written book and very interesting. You will not regret buying and reading this book I have already read the book three time since i have received the book in the mail. It is a really good even great book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Oh my God! The Hunger Games is truly a work of art in words!    Katniss Everdeen is a young woman that had to grow up too soon. Set in the future, the United States has become an area of Districts, all under the name of Panem. Each District has it's issues, mostly, the people are starving, while those in the Capitol live the life of excess and luxury.    Each year, two tributes (boy and girl) are selected to fight to the death as a reminder of the Capital's power. Only one can survive. When Katniss' young sister, Prim, has her name drawn as Tribute, Katniss volunteers in her place and is thrown into the arena. Can she survive? Will she have to kill Peeta, the boy Tribute from her District?    Katniss is an unbelievable heroine. Her inner strength is unmatched, yet she does not realize how strong she really is.    I started this book on a Friday and finished it on the following Saturday. It is totally devourable. I'm reading Catching Fire now and I can not wait to see the movie.    Five Stars for a brilliant story that will pull your emotions in every possible direction. Kudos Suzanne Collins! And Kudos to those who decided to put Jennifer Lawrence, from Louisville, Kentucky, and John Hutcherson, from Union, Kentucky, in two of the lead roles. Kentucky rocks in things other than basketball!    Continue reading on Examiner.com The Hunger Games - A Book Review - Louisville Creative Writing   Examiner.com [...]

B004SBQGHS|4.0|Screw I-crap. Why are updates and features missing from Android ports<br />I have to play on my old iphone to get full version. Come on Rovio. Show us some respect
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My friend kept begging me and begging me to read this series, and I'm glad I finally did. Hunger Games and Catching Fire were two of the BEST books I've ever read, although Mockingjay was a bit disappointing in some aspects. The world created by Suzanne Collins could be enjoyed by anyone, adults as well as young adults. The characters a rich, Katniss and Peeta really come to life and are unforgettable. I'm glad I read the books before the movies came out! Definitely read the books first!
B005LAIGW8|3.0|nicholas cage is back as ghost rider, trying to get rid of his curse while trying to save a boy from becoming the anti-christ. thats basically the plot with some angel power that ghost rider can possess,  mix that with a gritty, somewhat entertaining and yet feeling like a low budget direct to video release. some cool action scenes, some not so great and some dumb moments. I think the budget is what hurts this movie a bit, with a bigger budget and a different director with a better vision. you can have something here that is as good as the original, unforuately this movie isn't. Its worth watching, just don't expect it to be great.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I really like this dvd even though its only 20 mins or so, she really packs a punch there are two women in the video one that will show the kicked up version and the other will show modified movements of only certain moves. Please dont think because this is only 20 mins that its easy...whew its not there are three levels and you work your way up. I've been doing this for about a week and I can tell you I feel great changes already. I would definately recommend this dvd.
B004EPZ03Y|1.0|I was so excited about sitting down with my family to watch the movie when 5 minutes into the film it started to skip and when we went to check the disc...it had a scratch down it.  We had just taken it out of the wrapping straight to the player. This is the first time this has happened too with an Amazon order.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Meow Meow Meow em me mw ne en. its awesome and really fun it teaches you many things including the awesome mini games
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Upgraded from iphone(y) to Motorola Atrix. Loads fast runs right BUT WTG - No zen garden or extra games. RIP OFF. PAID FOR game thinking it would be equivalent. POP CAP obviously doesn't give a dam about Non-apple users
B005SFR7YE|5.0|A must-have videorecording!  The finest vocals, beautiful acting, and a characterization that truly moves the viewer.  In every way, it easily eclipses the Broadway performance we had seen just days earlier.  Add in the finale with four Phantoms and Sarah Brightman and you've got a treasure you will watch again and again!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This game is awesome only I wish it had more levels. for people who said it wouldn't download try clearing some of your app space. AWESOME!!!!!

B006OCM0G0|1.0|Games like this area slap in the face to the consumer.<br /><br />The philosophy behind them is &quot;We can make a great game that will be a lot of fun and very enjoyable,  but,  instead we will make a sub par game that continuosly tries to solicit money from you for extra &quot;features&quot; which would have been included in the game in the first place if we cared at all about making the consumer happy&quot;.<br /><br />Games and IAP scams like this seriously make me want to support software piracy.
B0061QD7YS|5.0|This is a great remastered version such clear and crisp picture of the well known movie we have all come to adore and love. The story about lady who falls in love with the tramp from the other side of the tracks.

0307938905|4.0|This is the story of Le Cirque des Rêves the circus that arrives without warning and is only open at night. We are taken back to the very beginning and how it was created to be the stage for an epic game of magic between Celia Bowen and Marco Alisdair. Both are chosen as children to be the competitors, training from an early age to participate. The game is simple one out does the other with the use of magic, as the story progresses so does the circus each one adding a bit more to it until it is completely something of wonder. The more the characters play the closer they become until ultimately they fall in love with one another, but only one of them can win this game.<br /><br />This is my first review on an audio book. My first welcome surprise was that it was read by Jim Dale, if you do not know who this is; he is the one who read the Harry Potter audio books. Jim Dale has an amazing way of bringing the characters to life and in this book with so many main characters and elaborate details it was definitely fun to listen to. In this book the details about the circus are so vivid you feel as if you are there and if you do not then you want to see it for yourself; I wouldn't be surprised to see this one made into a movie.  The story was complex spanning several years and encompassing many different characters into the plot, the author managed to pull it together beautifully. From the love that develops between Celia and Marco to just watching the twins, Poppit and Widget grow along with the circus, I am sure you will continue to be entertained.
B0050R0XEG|4.0|This review is primarily to warn those that already have the Volkswagen Beetle that the Van is about half the scale of the Beetle. I was rather dumbfounded as I realized this little by little during the build. I was expecting the Van to be larger than the Beetle since that's, you know, how it is in real life.<br /><br />However, despite this, it still is a very interesting build with several of those elusive AHA! moments Lego fans are looking for in new sets. Just don't expect it to be huge. Would have given this 5 stars except for the size. I'll include a picture if I can with the two Volkswagen sets side by side for comparison.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Link to the product image I posted on Amazon:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo1Z6A4ZOWV3RCD/B0050R0XEG/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link
0938045768|5.0|\\"Coach\\" Paul Wade's book is fantastic. His is a remarkable book that captures the complexity of training the body through six \\"simple\\" exercises.<br /><br />Wade's dedication and knowledge about body weight training shines throughout the book. The exercise progressions make intuitive sense. The chapter on coaching is also particularly relevant and useful - as ultimately success using this program will depend on one's attitude. Interesting tidbits about old-school strongmen sprinkled throughout the text add to the overall flavor and tone of the prose, which is straightforward and generally concise.<br /><br />In terms of value, the book also delivers. Are these exercises \\"new?\\" No. However, as mentioned above, the progressions are absolute gold. One particular example: his bridge progression series. As someone with a relatively flexible posterior chain but tight anterior chain (I did martial arts as a kid), I found Wade's comments on the bridge and its progressions to be invaluable. Again, the exercises are not new (e.g. short bridges) - I knew a number of them before buying the book. Yet, Wade puts it together in a way that helped me understand why I was very flexible in some ways, but lacked mobility in other ways.<br /><br />Wade's discussion of human anatomy and exercise science was also an interesting and informative read. (He does not hold nor claims to hold any advanced degrees in these areas, but his ideas appear sound to me based on experience dealing with my own exercise-related injuries and my time spent working in a physical therapy clinic.)<br /><br />Serious students of bodyweight training and physical culture (as well as novices!) will benefit from reading and practicing the exercises in this book; I know I have.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I got this to see what all the talk was about.  I bought the kindle for reading now all I do is play angry birds!
B004EPZ03Y|1.0|when i think of the muppets i think of escape, not political lectures. i think of animal jabbering on and banging away and not a demagogueic indictment of a free society. extremely disappointing.
B0072OFM28|3.0|As someone who literally watches no television, I instantly became addicted to Spartacus, Blood and Sand.  It is easily the very best series I have ever seen.  It was perfectly cast, perfectly written, spell-binding and exciting.  It had a fascinating combination of historical fact, violence, romance, sex, evil, duplicity and debauchery to keep everyone at the edge of their couch.  I literally couldn't wait for the next episode.  If I had one complaint it would be never knowing which beloved character would be killed the following week. A million kudos to DeKnight.  That said, I also enjoyed the prequel; it very nearly measured up, but of course could not minus the incredible Andy Whitfield.  Still it was excellent, albeit too short.<br />Unfortunately, I am not finding Vengeance as wonderful. Liam is doing his very best, but with all due respect and apologies, he can't fill those sandals.  Andy was a truly perfect Spartacus with the passion, the voice, the look, and the demeanor that you would absolutely expect that character to have. More kudos for casting him.  It comes as no surprise that he can never be adequately replaced, and I find Liam lacking in those areas.  He is too soft-spoken, and when he does speak it sounds more like poetry than fire and determination.  Mira is not really cutting it as a mate for Spartacus; I very much miss the character of Sura, also perfectly cast. Mira is getting clingy and annoying.  Navia is a very weak spot, and to me always was.  I do not like the current Navia, but did not like the original either.  I don't believe either character has/had the passion and strength worthy of a man like Crixus; both lack a personality.  I also agree that the Arena was irreplaceable, and even though the series must move forward toward a different direction, I will forever miss the thrill of the evil Batty and the gladitorial training at his Ludus.  I have been lamenting the death of Whitfield terribly.  Sadly, he can never be replaced.  Gannicus is incredibly appealing and was also very well cast in the prequel; perfect inflections, great passion and expression.  I am thinking he would have made a better Sparty.  Enough of my two cents' worth; thanks for reading.  Episode 9 tonight!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Welcome to the world of Panem, the country that was once called North America in this futuristic tale we are thrown into the Hunger Games with a young woman named Katniss Everdeen. Panem is made up of the Capitol and the 12 districts, introducing us to an autocratic government where the districts must follow the Capitol's rules any signs of defiance or disobedience is punishable  by the authorities in this case the peacekeepers.  At one time there had been an uprising of the thirteen districts against the Capitol but twelve were defeated and the thirteen had been \\"obliterated.\\"  As a reminder that such an uprising should never happen again the Capitol hosts the Hunger Games every year taking a boy and girl from each district and pinning them against each other in a fight to the death.<br /><br />I started reading this book after seeing the trailer for the upcoming movie, in my mind I thought \\"that looks pretty cool.\\" So I decided to try out the book, because of the trailer I had a vague idea what the book would be about. From the very beginning I was engrossed in Katniss' tale of adversity, from having to provide for her family since her father's death, to her younger sister being chosen for the Hunger Games and immediately taking her place, and even more that might spoil the book for you! Usually as I read I some-what compose a review in my head I may read an interesting part and start composing how I want to include it in my reviews but for this book I was so captivated that my mind did not once even wander, which in itself is a feet for me.  This is definitely a young adult novel but if you want a fun easy read I would suggest you give this one a shot.

B004FEL6GO|5.0|Mechtech, by far, provides some of the best, articulated Transformer models. The design of this particular Bumblebee is great and a perfect size. He is also easily transformed from car mode into robot mode, and vice-versa, and you can almost instantly figure out how it works and how to form him. He's also rather durable and just to remind you, if the leg or arm falls off, it can easily be snapped back in place. He's very pose-able, too, excellent for play and display, or maybe even the occasional stop-motion.
B004EPYZT4|1.0|Conan seemed like a a good addition to my Conan collection. I have over 1,000 DVD or VHS in my library. I have to rate this as great photography. The movie, however, is boring. I felt like I was watching a middle-school play. I guess I could compare it to the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. There is no there, there.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|What business is it of Amazon to decide when and where I can download a program? I have a 4G line with unlimted data. My laptop uses qa 4G card and I do not have wifi at home because everything I own is connected independantly. So, for me to download this game, I would have to leave my house and head to a Mc Donalds or Starbucks to download. Stupid! Amazon insists that I download many of their apps via Wifi. Stop it!<br /><br />My alternative, I use the Google Market and download the same apps via my mobile connection. I cancel my download from Amazon and they lose my money. This happens all too often because of a stupid policy of their own. While my copy of Angry Birds Space is sitting in my queue waiting for wifi to download, I am allready playing it thanks to the Google Play Store.<br /><br />Stop this dumb policy.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|There was no instructions. Very interesting game but could have been better with instructions. I really enjoyed playing this game almost every day.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|There isn't anything negative one could say about this new Angry Birds title. It's. fun and fresh and gives a new twist on the game! The price is decient and the game is fun - what more could one ask for?
B005LLSNNE|5.0|We love Sons of Anarchy but the best way to own video is to purchase the digital version. This way you can view it anywhere in the world and not have to carry around hard copies (or forget to take them). Give it a try...you'll love the idea !!
0765326353|5.0|Yes - I admit that I am a huge fan of Mr Sanderson's.  I've got signed copies of his books, including this one, on my shelf.  So fair warning on this review...<br /><br />I had a bit of trepidation before starting this book.  First off, it is huge.  Mr. Sanderson wrote openly about how this first book in the Stormlight Archive germinated from an idea in his head since he was a teenager.  This comes out in the writing.  The world he has imagined in the pages of this novel is lovingly described.  This is storytelling at its finest.<br /><br />While some of the aspects of this book will fall into the more traditional high fantasy genre, we really get a chance to see some wonderful new themes.  A different magic system, great new characters that you want to know, a completely new style of fighting wars, and new takes on race / class divisions.<br /><br />Kaladin is just my kind of character. A hero turned slave who has to overcome more than anyone.  A man who stands on his principles and yet knows how to lead.<br /><br />My second favorite aspect to the book is the fighting on the Shattered Plain.  What imagination!  The details of how the fighting takes place, the sacrifices of the bridge carriers, the strategies.  It is amazing how in-depth this all is.  Reading these sections is the equivalent of watching a movie.<br /><br />There are also other characters who are part of the elite - the scholars, the politicians, the soldiers.  They all come to play different roles throughout the book and come all together in the closing third of the book.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o wonderfully imaginative story<br />o characters to pull for and empathize with<br />o great imagery<br /><br />Cons:<br />o length - although I don't know what I would have cut...<br />o it will be a long wait for the next book...<br /><br />Overall - I highly recommend this book.  I will gladly re-read it just before book two appears.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the best series I have read in a LONG time! I agree with some other reviewers that there are some major grammatical errors in the books, and her writing style is sometimes very amateur, but the story line surpasses any of those flaws. I read this entire 3 book series in 5 days, then immediately started to re-read it. A wonderful story of a dark past and a damaged man transformed by love. Great discussion book for a book club, given the right crowd. Highly recommend!!!!!!!!
B000FC11A6|5.0|I didn't love the Baroque stuff. Snow Crash was cool. In the Beginning There Was the Command Line was also very good. But this? This was amazing. This was Follet Pillars of the Earth good.
030745455X|5.0|Another second book in a trilogy... I love to read long series of books where you learn to know characters like your best friends.  Usually the second book is where an author will slip. Not so here.  I actually preferred this volume to the first.  This book takes you deeper into Salander's past.  You understand what motivates and drives her.  There is also more character development around Mikael's friends and his work.<br /><br />The writing is better and more consistent in this book than the first - which I thought had a rough beginning.  This is a seamless continuation of the story.  The bad guys are badder, the good guys have the fight of their life.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o great continuation of the story<br />o character development<br />o fast-paced / great mystery<br /><br />Cons:<br />o a bit gruesome at times...<br /><br />Overall - I highly recommend this to anyone who read the first book.  A great work of adult fiction.
1250006341|5.0|Wow! Reading this book about Downton Abbey is like a vacation to their world! So many pictures and such fabulous background information. I thought I knew most of these things but they just expanded my knowledge! The most interesting thing was probably the players in their real life photos! How they can be changed into Edwardian era characters and be almost unrecognizable when you see them for real! Mrs. Patmore was a huge surprise! Of course, reading what life was REALLY like in those days for these characters is amazing! I want to read the story of family upon which Downton Abbey was based. AND we can't wait to travel there and see the place for real! Just pinch me!Great, great book; super read; great companion to the series! Thank you! Rick Peerboom
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was skeptical when my cousin handed me the first Hunger Games book. It seemed like it was too popular to actually be good reading. Boy, was I wrong. Collins has carefully and slowly crafted the story of Katniss Everdeen, a young teenager forced to fight for her life in gladiator-like games. The whole of the trilogy is written in first person, present tense; we see the country of Panem through Katniss's eyes - the lavishness and arrogance of the Capitol is particularly well showcased. The characters themselves are almost like real people. You catch yourself cheering or crying because Katniss is. And the twists and convulsions the plot goes through made me unable to put it down. Definitely worth the read!
B006UG909U|5.0|I was the last person who gave held out any hope for this album ; especially after hearing Tattoo. Well I will admit when I'm wrong , this is the best album that I've heard this year. Tattoo has even grown on me. This is not just a band trying to revisit it's youth. This album makes a statement. There is a little bit of everything on this album , from thrash/punk to classic VH. Standouts are Chinatown , Bullet Head , Blood and Fire,Outta Space, and Big River. The latter being the closest you can get to Van Halen circa 1980.Would I like to have Michael Anthony back sure , but that is not an indictment of Wolfgang , just wishful thinking. Someone woke Eddie from his slumber and reminded him that he is one of the greatest guitarists of all time. Eddie , all is forgiven ; Balance , whatever the Gary Cherrone experiment was ; I don't care , you have more than redeemed yourself. Now Dave's upper register is gone,so no spontaneous screams , but you know what it works. This album is loud , raucous , and in your face ; meant to be played loud. I cannot say this strongly enough , buy this album it will not disappoint.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I think that if this album came out in 1980 would have been easily recognize as the VH masterpiece! Wow, i wouldn't have expect VH to sound any better than this. Every tracks here is a killer. Eddie is in top form and Dave is the man. VH is definetely back.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I read many novels. Most of them I can easily put down and read later. Not this one. I was completely drawn into this novel. It is the story of a young teenage boy who is accused and tried for murder. The investigation and subsequent prosecution and defense is complicated by the fact that the boys father is the local, prominent Assistant DA. The story is reasonably fast paced and is well written. Interesting insights are given regarding criminal investigations, jury trials and role of judges. The trial strategy of both defense and prosecution are fascinating.Both father and son's psychological makeup and possible genetic influences are covered and add drama and emotion to the story.But most of all, this story is about the love the parents have for their son and how they deal with the crisis they face of him being tried for murder. The author goes into considerable detail regarding this aspect of the story. It is very moving. As a parent, I couldn't help but wonder how I would have dealt with this situation. As I read the last sentence of the story, I sat there stunned.You won't be disappointed in this book.

I saw that coming and was able to skim the last 25 pages of the book.<br />  Looking back on the book, I also wondered why she went to sleep each night. Christine's total helplessness started to get on my nerves. Why not stay awake all night, so you could start the next day still knowing everything from the day before? Get some gumption, Christine!
0439023513|5.0|I can't figure out what all the bad reviews are about. I LOVED this book. I LOVED the first book, liked the second and LOVED this one. I was not really disappointed by this at all. There are some parts to the book that dragged out a bit, that I'm sure will be cut in the movie, but that is my only complaint. The suspense was what kept me going. If you were drawn into the first two books and read these back to back as I did, I can't see how you'd be disappointed. This book is completely different which may be why some people didn't like it.<br /><br />The end, for me, was perfect and realistic. For the characters that went back to their lives before the uprising started, that is real life. Some people move on, most don't. One of the reviews said \\"this is that a fairytale, it's war\\". If you keep that in mind you should love this book.
B001GKJ2E8|1.0|I am quite easy to please when it comes to movies, but this one.... What a waste of time. The only reason you might want to see this movie is for the action scenes. And they are not event that good, they simply don't work, everything is predictable, looks fake, and way to stupid to make any sense. You can picture the guys on their CGI station \\"hey, let's drop a train from the sky, yeah, that's a good one!\\". Well, in a way, I must say that I started to laugh about halfway through, so maybe it wasn't that bad. Still I am glad this is over.

But all in all worth the 2 bucks (if the maker of this reads these plz consider making it to where you can upload pics to the app :))

B007J4T2G8|1.0|It is amazing to me that hundreds of thousands of women around the country and now around the world are raving about FIFTY SHADES OF GREY.  Unfortunately for my Amazon credit card account I was sucked into down loading this book after watching a story about it on Good Morning American.  Frankly, I wish I had left home earlier that day and had never seen the story. I then would not have wasted my time and money.<br /><br />We all know that this is the story of Anastasia Steele who meets Christian Grey, an illusive and wealthy business man.  The choice of names in both cases is interesting, especially the name \\"Christian\\" for a character who turns out to be kinky, sick, heartless, cruel, evil, sinister and a stalker. And Anastasia Steele who turns out to be anything but strong.  Christian should have been on some shrink's couch or maybe in jail.  I admit to looking at the character through eyes much older than that of the main character, but in my book this guy had DANGEROUS painted on his forehead.<br /><br />And this sicko hooks up with the vulnerable Anastasia who clearly has low self esteem and her own issues.  Here is a woman that the author would lead you to believe that went through four years of college from 2007 - 2011 without her own computer - borrowing her roommates the whole time!  Give me a break.  I don't care how poor she was she would have had an old desk top or used a computer at the college. Colleges for years have had lap tops to loan out to students and by 2007 most colleges required students to have their own.  She constantly borrows her roommates clothes, bascially lives off her and then allows the roommate to treat her like ..... , well you know the word.  Roommate Kate, is not a nice person.  Anastasia, the 21 year old virgin who claims she has never even had a boy friend has had offers of dates from three very nice men - Jose, the roommates brother Ethan and her employers brother.  She turns them all down based on lame excuses.But suddenly Christian Grey comes along and sweeps her off her feet and out of her virginity on the first date.  It makes no sense.  They were not in love, they are in lust!  And Anastasia puts up with it. Throughout the book she puts up with treatment that no sane woman would never accept.<br /><br />I managed to finish the book, just to see what happpened.  The problem is, by the end you find that this is only the first of the trilogy and you have to read more to find out.  Frankly, I don't care. A third of the way into the book I thought I would scream if Anastasia said one more thime that she was \\"biting her lip\\" or Christian told her to stop biting her lip. Half way through the book I began to wonder if she still had a lip to bite after all of that biting. The author was also hung up on her putting her hair in a pony tail and her comments about the way Christian's pants hung on his hips.  The phrases were repeated ad-nauseam only with Holy Cow.<br /><br />It is said that readers like books and movies because they identify with a character in the story.  It's a sad reflection on the American female if they identify with Anastasia.  Any sane woman would have got the heck out when he showed her his whip shack and pulled out a written contract and probably contacted the local vice squad. There are to many fine writers and interesting stories out there to waste you time on this piece of worthless trash.ristian Grey comes along and sweeps her off her feet and out of her virginity on the first date.

B001AQT0UY|5.0|I'm not ashamed to admit - I had a stuffed Gizmo when the film came out. This is one of three or four movies that I watched incessantly when it was first released. I finally decided to reach back into my childhood and see if the BD was worth the effort. And my answer - a resounding yes!<br /><br />Some BDs of 70's and 80's films don't come with a very pretty restored picture. Not so here. Since there are more puppets than not, the special effects are outstanding. The special features are on the light side, but you don't grab BDs for those, unless you're me. The commentaries are fun, especially the director and lead actors Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates. There are some new/exteded scenes, and a dated making-of featurette (which is not to say it's worthless, it's just dated). The audio channels are actually beterr than anticipated, with a heavy TrueHD 5.1 right on the top (I still miss 7.1 though). There's a ton of subtitle tracks as well, which as I always say, is greatly appreciated.<br /><br />This is a seminal 1980's film wrapped up in a bow, literally. It's just the sort of off-beat film that warrants being called a Christmas film. Now, there's only one question to ask yourself:<br /><br />\\"Do You Hear What I hear?\\"
B003R0MF5I|2.0|The first three seasons we purchased had very clear video quality.  The 4th Season DVD was very grainy, almost like it was from an old VCR tape that had been duplicated several times (i.e., a copy of a copy of a copy etc.).  Audio was ok, just wasn't clear.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Well, this angrybirds &quot;space edition&quot; is interesting. Of course if you only have seasons and the original version you will not be used to this edition of Angry Birds.I say purchase it. If you like Angry Birds, You will definetly like Angry birds space.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Even the title of this novel written by John Green has a philosophical meaning which has been extrapolated by a line written by William Shakespeare, in the play of Julius Caesar.<br /><br />'The fault, dear Brutus is not in our star, / But in ourselves, that we are underlings<br /> (Act1, scene 2)<br /><br />The plot is very simple but not superficial because you will be the a magical cannula of Hazel, you will be able to smell her breath, her opinions and frustration.<br /><br />You will live in Indianapolis in the United States with the beautiful name of Hazel with cancer of sixteen year old.<br /><br />Having diagnosed with clinical depression, your family will force you to join a support group, where you'll meet and fall in love with the seventeen year old Augustus, an ex-baseball player without a leg.<br /><br />This is not a sad novel if you will be able to extrapolate the positivity summarized in the following passages:<br /><br />You are able to love Augustus intensively<br /><br />\\"The space around us evaporated, and for a weird moment I really liked my body\\"<br />(page 203)<br /><br />According to the Maslow's pyramid you are considered inferior (page 213) and also by other humans like you for instance:<br /><br />\\"Augustus Waters did not die after a lengthy battle with cancer. He died after a lengthy battle with human consciousness, a victim as you will be of the universe's need to make and unmake all that is possible\\".<br />(page 266)<br /><br />In my opinion this novel is suitable for young adults, it explains the life of a human being, they must be educated on this principle the summation of our sneaky racism.<br /><br />Cheers<br />IP
0780622650|3.0|They wasted a golden opportunity IMHO! This film is just more of same ol same ol sci fi in my opinion, but at least they had sense enough to not make it a high tech clone of the original TV series because that was ultra ultra lame and watchable only by bored kids of the era that nothing to choose from basically (I confess I was one of those kids and likely saw every episode multiple times I am ashamed to say now)<br /><br />  As for the opportunity missed?  That clearly would have been to pattern the film more after the original Swiss Family Robinson, rather than loosely using the ULTRA LAME TV series!  Shoulda Coulda been much more of an earth like planet only with bizarre creatures and natural wonders. Loose Dr Smith and the terrorist angle too! The film would have then had the opportunity to be something that sparks imagination and escape to a place the audience would love to imagine their selves in! It could still have had plenty of action and suspense besides with gobs of opportunity like child characters becoming best friends with certain of the planet's creatures etc.  It could even have begun with them landing through some kind of solar fog that through all the gismos for detecting the surroundings out of whack and landing in a huge desolate crater or something that at first makes it appear they were doomed on a dying world and trapped inside an area with hopelessly steep razor sharp jagged faces towering thousands of feet 360 degrees around them ...until of course like Alice in Wonderland one of the characters (a youngster of course)spots some adorable creature and chases after it until it disappears into a long winding natural tunnel that ultimately emerges into an unbelievable alien paradise.  ...I mean just for instance! Something ANYONE would love to watch from little ones to the hoary headed oldsters like myself.  Just imagine such a film done using the tech of Avatar!  Endless opportunities here!<br /><br />  I believe that the world in which we now live truly has grown \\"old like a garment\\" so that we are right up to the brink doomsday.  Somehow most folks sense this too even without the benefit of that most published and influential Book that needs not even to be named. For the majority of folks there is nothing to look forward to now but a certain fiery indignation. When confronted with what is just about to occur, we simply chose our pride rather than fessing up and pleading piteously for mercy (like certain Ninevites of old did do) until finally now already I suspect it is far too late for those of us this applies too.  I am afraid there is only an remnant of the ones chosen by unmerited favor to have eyes opened (in other words grace)(BTW folks who would be invisible, especially to the world, ultimately known only by the Creator and perhaps themselves) So movies like I describe could at least have the potential to cheer the dying (and regardless your take on my beliefs no one can deny we are ALL a dying in this flesh!)<br /><br />Like I say, a missed opportunity
B003L77FYS|4.0|Season Three tripped up while trying to keep pace with what came before. There are a few episodes that fall in line with any other cop-procedural shows, and it doesn't seem that these (compared to the rest of the series sub-par) had any interest in holding ours. Still, the charm of the show makes you grin and bear it. The other half of the episodes are, as expected, amazing. There are a few that stand out as instant classics... those featuring a 'murdered cop', an alien conspiracy (containing another 'Firefly' reference), the 200 year old bullet and another couple that will doubtlessly remind you why you watch the show.<br /><br />I truly hope that the producers steer clear of the episodic police trappings and keep focusing on the inter-relationships that make this quirky show worth our time.<br /><br />The bonus features of this set are on par with the previous season sets, which is to say that it is 'decent'. Gag Reels are always enjoyed, but I'd like to see more commentary. Then again, I'd like to hear M.E. Lainie say something other than \\"based on body temp and lividity, I'd guess time of death to be between\\"....<br /><br />Down to brass tax - if you're a fan, grab it. If you wanting to try something new, this is worth the while, but be sure to start with the prior two seasons. That way, when this season starts to lag slightly you'll be too invested in the characters to be bothered by it.
B00466HN6S|5.0|'Hop' is a fun little Easter flick, that won me over quickly. I am happy owner of two rabbits who I absolutely love and E.B. reminded me SO much of one of my bunnies. Some of the references to recent movies and stars will unfortunately date it as the years pass, but I can forgive that part of it. From a rabbit lovers perspective, this movie includes some really important things about bunnies and rabbit ownership, without being preachy.<br /><br />There is a scene where the main character Fred, in an attempt to get rid of E.B., takes him to an outdoor location and tries to leave him there. We are quickly reminded that a domesticated rabbit isn't fit for life in the wild. It's the sad fate of many 'Easter bunnies' bought during the holiday for children, that once the rabbit gets bigger (and has usually not been spayed or neutered) and develops unwanted behaviors, that they are either taken to a shelter, or dumped in the wild on the assumption that rabbits are 'wild' animals and can handle the outdoors just fine. This of course is not true and a rabbit is not an Easter toy, but an involved pet equal to a dog or cat. Google search the 'Make Mine Chocolate' campaign for more info on humane rabbit treatment.<br /><br />There are also bits of rabbit info humor that made me laugh, as when E.B. points out that rabbits can't vomit, so when he sees something that makes him feel sick all he can do is gag. I also loved the 'Easter Island' backdrop, with those mysterious statues that have fascinated me since I was a kid! The 'Pink Beret' segments are wonderful as well. The friend I saw this with has asthma, and one of the Pink Beret bunnies uses an inhaler after some of the action scenes, which was a funny little touch that made her giggle.<br /><br />In the end, it's a good story that includes bunnies, chicks and tons of Easter candy! You may want to have your Cadbury eggs and marshmallow Peeps lined up for watching this one. I love a heavy drama as much as the next person, butif you just want to be a little silly and do the 'hop', it's quite perfect.

B006JTS5OO|2.0|Rent it first at Red Box, in the extremely unlikely event that you actually enjoyed this movie, buy it.  I was totally disappointed in this flick.  On a side note, if you ever get to Disneyland (California Adventure) or Walt Disney World (Disney Studios) be sure to check out the 3D Muppets show.  It's great with a lot of gags!

B003L77GGK|5.0|I love the supernatural series! Not only are Sam and Dean way cool, but the overarching story line with the angels (and missing God) is equally compelling. This newest season continues exactly where the old one left off. Sam shows back up and disrupts Dean's otherwise normal life. But we all knew that it wouldn't work out for Dean anyway. It is clever how they resolve the relationship that Dean has with his girlfriend and her son. I loved Castielle too. What a great actor, and it looks like he's going to be a strong presence in the next season too.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|If you have an older Android device, don't even bother trying the latest build.  It won't work.  Older versions used to run just great on my 2.2 tablet but the latest upgrade is just TOO big and, as others have pointed out, it cannot be moved to the SD card. Therefore it won't load, it won't install, I've attempted to reinstall it 3 times tonight, and I've got it to the point where it will at least open but it won't copy books down from the Archive/Library. I've spent what to me is a lot of money on e-books and now I can't use them.  There's no excuse for this app to be this big.  Amazon needs to stop trying to force-feed customers cr*p they don't want and keep the focus on what customers DO want:  an app that actually works, and books the CONSUMER chooses.  I'm absolutely livid.  For God's sake, it's not THAT hard to make the legacy .apk available!!!
B00466HN72|4.0|I just learned that the number for the ultraviolet copy is ALSO the number for iTunes, just thought you should know even though it does not say so it worked for me.<br />Update:  I also learned when I went to claim my ultraviolet copy that you get to choose your digital copy format (one of four formats).  This is probally why the code worked in iTunes.  Just a side note for those new to ultraviolet:  the stream quality is very poor for 1080i & p TV's and computers, but does show well on iphones and other SMALL devices.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I avoided this book for a long time as it's rated young adult.  Since I had had a bad experience with<br />\\"Twilight\\" (so badly written) I was not eager to try another juvenile book.  However, I heard some good<br />things, and after all \\"Harry Potter\\" is also a young adult. I was so pleasantly surprised, I went right<br />online and bought the rest of the trilogy.<br />  The characters and plot were well thought out and the \\"games\\" were exciting and terrifying.  Underlying it all<br />is the political corruption that seems to be such a factor in our current lives.<br />  All in all, this is a very satisfying book that leaves you with lots to think about.
1619491370|5.0|I've always thought of a \\"Pollyanna\\" as a sort of dopey, simple, eternally optimistic, blind, illogical doofus, with no firm grip on reality. I think that's more or less the generally accepted meaning of the description now.<br /><br />  Well guess what? The original Pollyanna in this book is a tough, spunky, focused and extremely alert little girl with a strong will and good clear instincts. Her \\"glad game\\", which she plays to turn bad news and punishments into good news, is a powerful mechanism for coping with the dismal outlines of her constrained and depressing life situation.<br /><br />  Her spirit and her will to prevail carry her and those she meets to happy and deserved endings.<br /><br />  Like Anne of Green Gables and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, Pollyanna is an unjustly neglected and fascinating character, as real and compelling now as in 1913. This is a real find and should not be dismissed out of hand, which is a mistake I would have made had I not resolved to read and fairly weigh everything, even books I assumed were lame. Give this surprising find a try.
B000063V8S|4.0|I never saw Next Generation until a few months ago when my boyfriend brought home the 3rd season. I loved it, could do with a little less Klingon based episodes though. I found the fourth season used on Amazon at a great price and had to get it. I was hoping that there wouldnt be too many scratched, but it came perfect. The packaging was a little stained, but geeks sure know how to take care of their electronics. The fourth season was better than the 3rd. Glad I bought this. I suggest to anyone who loves some good sci-fi. Graphics are also pretty good for the early 90's.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|This isn't a cheap movie, its very creative and the special effects are awesome. This almost feels like a real documentary. There's quite a bit of humor in it, how the way the troll hunter acts indifferent to all the weird things things he's gotta do to troll hunt. Trololololol..... there i said it.

B0016492BW|5.0|This is probably one of the greatest comedy movies around. Unfortunately, it includes the ULTRAVIOLET DRM digital copy. If you can save money by purchasing this without the UV DRM do it.
B000SEGEKI|5.0|For me, 'The Pragmatic Programmer' joins 'Code Complete', 'Design Patterns' or 'Refactoring' among the books every programmer should read (at least twice). It is packed with wisdom and introduces concepts referred throughout our body of knowledge. 'Tracer bullet', 'Tell, don't ask' or 'Learn a new programming language every year' are just some of the concepts The Pragmatic Programmer implanted in my mind.<br /><br />Definitely a 5-star.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is the best one I have used so far!!! I tried other apps and they always lag in the connection, even when using a high speed connection; with Splashtop there is none of that even with a 3G connection.  Great product!!
B000003T9B|5.0|Overkill's debut is an excellent thrash album.  The production is a bit shoddy, but that was par for the course at the time. Bobby Gustafson does some superior shredding here, and Blitz is young and just spits hate filled acid on all the tracks.  Take a listen to the breakdown portion of \\"Feel the Fire\\" to see how nasty his vocals can become.  You also get some \\"Hammerhead\\" and \\"Rotten to the Core,\\" certified Overkill classics.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie has such an amazing message.  I love this producers movies anyway.  Completely clean (no bad language, no nudity, no sexual content at all).  It will make you laugh and make you cry.  I recommend this movie to everyone.
B007IQX1G4|1.0|This was terrible. It was strange, unfunny, sad, and never connected. Worst of all, there was no wrap up, it was like a string of events that never seemed to come to an ending point. DO NOT RENT OR BUY. Save your $

B000I5XOW8|5.0|UPDATED: Now that the 20th Anniversary Blu-ray is available, I can finally give this 5 stars.    Unfortunately Amazon lumps reviews for all editions together. Don't buy the old black-cover Blu-ray, the transfer on that disc was shameful. The 20th Anniversary white-cover version has a gorgeous new transfer of this classic film in true 1080p, with crisp DTS-HD Master Audio. It looks like it's had some image stabilization applied to compensate for gate weave in the film, and it's had a little bit of grain reduction applied, but both effects are tastefully done and not over-the-top. The disc also comes with a nice assortment of special features, and the typical price here on Amazon is a steal for a great film well-presented. I recommend it unreservedly.    The review for the original, inferior disc is preserved below for contrast & historical accuracy.    =========================================    The two stars are for the Blu-ray, not the film itself, which I love and would happily give 5 stars.    Other Blu-ray reviewers have referred to a \\"soft\\" picture. Actually it is literally *pixelated*.    If you take a close look at high-contrast edges, like the names of the actors during the opening title sequence, you can plainly see big blocky pixels that are far too large for 1080p. Based on that, and some occasional frame-blending artifacts, it is clear that the source transfer for this disc was a standard-def telecine (60i) like what would be broadcast on cable networks. The authors of this disc took that old SD master and did an inverse telecine pass to remove the pulldown/interlacing and get a 24p SD master. (Unfortunately there were a few errors at edit points, causing the aforementioned frame-blending.)  Then it was upscaled to 1080p, but they didn't even do an interpolation algorithm, it's just nearest-neighbor pixel doubling. Yuck!    I will give it an extra star because (1) it's usually very cheap and (2) it's way better than the DVD. There are none of the old compression artifacts or edge enhancement here. But for a Blu-ray, it's very disappointing. It's barely worth the 8 bucks I spent on it.    Also I have to disagree with those who complained about the black levels. The contrast is fine, it's just that the film itself seems to have been shot in a run-and-gun medium-budget style that did not emphasize rich cinematography. There might be a little bit more range to eke out color-wise from the original film negative, if WB will ever break out the wallet and pay for a new transfer, but I'm betting there isn't much more depth to be had.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|If you want to know why this country is in a recession, then you have to see this film. This is a spectacular presentation. A must read for every American who loves this country and wants to have a voice in its future. If you have any question as to why this country has been in decline for decades, or how we get out of this decline, this film offers the answers. Empower yourself.
B006Z9K97E|5.0|Once you've started this book, it's very difficult to put down.<br /><br />How this man survived the brutality of a 'Total Control' North Korean prison camp is impossible to conceive. From watching classmates being beaten to death and his mother and brother being executed, to being tortured over hot coals at the age of 13 and suffering near starvation for the first 24 years of his life, to the soul-destroying work ethic and unparalleled cruelty  of the prison guards, how Shin Dong-hyuk is still alive, let alone now living happily in America, is breathtaking. His story is heartbreaking from the very beginning, yet his ability to keep on going in the face of absolute punishment will inspire all who read about it. The worst day you've ever had, will likely pale in comparison to a normal day in the life of this guy.<br /><br />Blaine Harden has done a great job of presenting the details, and obviously cultivated a strong relationship with Shin. The book is short but there's more than enough in there for you to appreciate the gravity of the situation in North Korea, and its relationship with both South Korea and China.<br /><br />Worth every penny.
B003EYVXV4|4.0|I have not read The Hunger Games. I went into this movie completely blind and was pretty unimpressed with the trailers and TV spots. So I was completely unprepared for the gargantuan turnout for the screening I attended two days before this soon-to-be-blockbuster's release. All I heard about beforehand was how similar The Hunger Games was to Battle Royale and how it was a rip-off. Considering how big of a Battle Royale fan I am and how I just finished revisiting and reviewing its recent release, that didn't really sit well with me. So expectations were kind of a muddled mess for me. As it turns out, The Hunger Games is one of the best mainstream movies to hit theaters so far this year.<br /><br />Battle Royale wastes little time getting to the main course featuring young adults under the age of eighteen brutally murdering each other against their will. The Hunger Games takes its time and I think that's its biggest asset. We get a glimpse into the life of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) before she volunteers for her sister at the ceremony before seeing all twenty four participants training, the kind of emotions that run through the pairs of participants from each district, and basically everything leading up to the event before the event itself. There's more depth to The Hunger Games and quite a bit more emotion. It certainly seems as though more is at stake in comparison to Battle Royale.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is really only similar to Battle Royale in the concept of children killing each other and even then it's done in different ways. Battle Royale is more focused on how the students die while The Hunger Games is more focused on introducing you to these characters and how they lived. The Hunger Games is on a grander scale and the result seems to have a bigger impact than that of Battle Royale. There's a bigger emphasis on life and the importance of death rather than the gruesome way that they die. The Hunger Games is completely absorbing. Its nearly two and a half hour runtime seems incredibly daunting at first, but will leave you thinking, \\"THAT was two and a half hours?!\\" You're sucked in so easily that the time just flies by. There's also this huge sci-fi influence and a bizarre sense of style that can only be described as something along the lines of Total Recall meets The Rocky Horror Picture Show. I'd even go as far to say there are shades of Blade Runner in there at times.<br /><br />The Hunger Games nearly lives up to every ounce of hype it has going for it and is completely satisfying except for the ending. The conclusion and last five minutes of the movie are so wishy-washy and indecisive that it just leaves you with this sense of bewilderment. It felt like the movie was building towards this epic confrontation, but it's yanked away before being thrown at you again and yanked away again all within the span of a couple of minutes. It feels controversial in a way and is obviously a lead in for the sequel. It's something that will be resolved once a sequel is released, but in the meantime feels lackluster for a standalone movie.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is an enthralling adventure that demands your attention its entire duration. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a fantastic and superbly emotional performance as several characters leave lasting impressions (Peeta Mellark, Effie Trinket, Haymitch Abernathy, and Caesar Flickermann just to name a few). Its slow build to the games itself leaves you the chance to digest the emotional journey that every chosen participant must be going through. With its massive cult-like following and overpowering outpour of advance ticket sales, The Hunger Games is bound to be the next big franchise and worldwide box office phenomenon. Bottom line, The Hunger Games is fantastically \\"dinnertaining.\\" That's right.

1400064627|5.0|I usually read a book before seeing the movie so that the director's interpretation doesn't superimpose itself upon my imagination, but it is only through the movie that I was made aware of this book's existence.<br /><br />The plot is superbly written and digresses to many chapters (cut from the movie) describing the simplicity of life in Birmingham, Alabama in the 1930's, the devotion of two friends who comfort one another in time of crisis--in the movie they are \\"just best friends\\" whereas in the book they are devoted to one another in an intimate lifetime commitment.<br /><br />We move between the 1930's and the 1980's as Evelyn, a frustrated, middle-aged Birmingham housewife, listens to the elderly Ninny tell the story of the dramas that developed into the friendship of Ruth and Idgie. We find ourselves moving back and forth between five decades in a beautifully woven tale of love, prejudice, family, commitment and inspiration.<br /><br />The final words sum the theme up, \\"The most important thing is friends...best friends.\\"<br /><br />Elizabeth Wallace is author of \\"The Invisible Thread: A Journey Home.\\"

B0064BWDRW|5.0|When I first started reading this latest Harry Hole novel, my hopes sank a little. It's about a new drug (called violin, a bit sad for me as I play the violin), drug smuggling, and the control of drugs in Oslo. I've never been one for stories on drugs and drug rings, (exception claimed for the tv show Breaking Bad), it's just something I'm really not interested in. But as Nesbo's brilliant writing kicked in and the plot took form I was hooked and couldn't put it down. As the story develops it becomes so much more - about family, relationships, morals and ethics, life and death. Nesbo is so skilled at laying clues and plot footholds as the novel progresses they don't even register. His ability to investigate the motives of the litany of characters drives the complex plot with its twists and turns, which leaves you puzzled, guessing (mostly wrongly) and breathless - and absolutely stunned at the climax.<br /><br />As for the story itself, I don't won't to give away too many spoilers so will only say that Harry flies back into Oslo for the only reason that would bring him back, someone he loves is in trouble, and that's Oleg, who is now 18. It's a great relief to see Harry sober, although still fighting his demons, so that he can sort out the huge mess Oleg has gotten himself into. Poor Harry is put through the wringer again, but at least he and Rakel get to rekindle their romance whilst Rakel's boyfriend obligingly cools his heels.<br /><br />Harry books into the Hotel Leon, where an old retired vagrant of a pastor is living in the room next door, who likes nothing more than to chew his arm off and take his cigarettes. A murdered teenager tells us his story as he lays dying, and slowly most of the pieces of what has happened come together. A Russian drug lord has a couple of new gruesome and ingenious ways of doing away with his enemies. A Norwegian native gets in on the drug manufacturing with disastrous consequences. The gorgeous Mikael Bellman has been promoted to head of Orgkrim, but he's still not entirely trustworthy. There's a `burner' in the police force, an astonishing concept I've never heard of, and a woman councillor whom I'm never sure is a woman or not.<br /><br />I'm usually spot on in picking who-dunnit, but I missed nearly every clue (although I did get one), and certainly did not see the end coming. Now that I have finished the book I have found myself flipping back to reread the clues that I missed, and I still think there is one thing left unfinished (hopefully for the next book!). I think I need to read the whole book again. I'm only sorry that I will probably have to wait another year for Jo Nesbo's next book. This is a great story, vicious and heart-rending all in one, which makes it unforgettable. I think it is Nesbo's best yet. Surely to be a movie. It's worth more than 5 stars.head of Orgkrim, but he's still not entirely trustworthy.

B002ECJZ76|3.0|I have no complaints through out the majority of the film.  Decent acting and a good story, however when his friend and his family are on the iced over pond and St. Nick goes flying overhead in the sleigh, I was disappointed.  There was no lead up during the movie to suggest that he had magical powers.  The movie really wasn't long enough to be able to develop this appropriately.  You go from St. Nick declaring this will be his last year delivering gifts to him zipping through the skies in a halo of stardust, smiling creepily, and the movie ends.  Story has a lot of potential, but the ending needs work.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|While I didn't buy this trilogy for my kindle I have read all 3 books. That probably come from the habit I made to instill in my children a respect for the artistry of the written word and the obligation it implied: I had to read whatever they read. It was a bold adventure that led me to discover different gendre and authors. I am grateful to my children.<br /><br />Now I am 62. What could possibly lead me to read The Hunger Games? Shouldn't I be bemused and apathetic about the same old same old? Well I'm am not. I purchased the first book because I wanted to see it if merited a second purchase. It does.<br /><br />The author writes in a clear and easy read. I read all three books in about 10 days and my house suffers for it. I enjoyed the primary character and her support characters. They were defined well enough that I could associate each of them with people I had know at some point in my life. While I do wish that the book had not been written in first preson I could still form empathy for Katniss. She appeared age appropriate on the cusp of self-discovery.<br /><br />If you are a student of historical cultures and societies you will discover ancient Rome reverberated in this books, but the characters definately portrait modern personalities. It is a good moral story in that we all are flawed and bravery is not over coming your fear but moving through it.<br /><br />The ending is pleasant. I am a long time fan of JRR Tolkien's the Lord of the Rings and the end in his story always left me sad. A hero who gives up what s/he saved is sad. I prefer the ending in this novel because it is more realistic.<br /><br />I have and will continue to recommend this trilogy to my family and friends. Job well done Suzanne Collins
B000R4SMCW|5.0|I was held in suspense all the way through.  I didn't have it figured out.  I loved the characters so much.  I was so charmed by Anthony Hopkins that at the first I kind of wanted him to get away with it.  I changed my tune when events happened closer to the end and I could see he was a monster.  I think people who like suspense and legal thrillers will like this.  I liked the distractions that kind of tried to draw you off track like the metal architecture sculpture that they kept showing that made you wonder what it had to do with the gun.  I would watch this again and I would tell others to watch it for the suspense and good characters.<br /><br />I like older movies like this one.<br />[[ASIN:B000063US3 The Verdict]] This is not a murder mystery but it is a good legal thriller.
B005K17RU0|4.0|works good but it is always an ongoing application so on my fire there is always a 1 in the top corner cant seem to get rid of but way better than weather channel app. the map is way better and runs nice.
B003R50FRI|5.0|This is a brilliant book on every level that a book can be brilliant. It's hard to imagine I'll ever read anything as well-written, thought-provoking or philosophically moving as Shantaram.<br /><br />PS Don't be put off by the length of the book. Yes, it's long but you'll be left wanting more.

B005SAY404|5.0|This opening episode to House's last season was well done, reminiscent of earlier seasons, which I have faithfully viewed. Gregory House meets people who are bigger bullies than he is and can be, but overcomes adversity with his intellect and the assistance of a promising young prison doctor.

B000068PQ0|5.0|I am not a big fan of Wayne Coyne's voice.  This was a hurtle I could not get over when listening to \\"The Soft Bulletin\\".  But here, wisely, Wayne's voice is given much needed help by the engineers and studio trickery - and as he has great trouble hitting notes he aims for, this is a great advantage.  Indeed, if one watches their appearance on Letterman singing \\"She Don't Use Jelly\\" it becomes readily apparent that the man cannot hold certain notes to the point that he sings as though he were tone deaf.  Why write a song whose notes are well above your register?  Change the key.<br />  This CD is not a trip, it's a vacation.  As far as I am concerned there is not a weak song on it, and while the lyrics can be as syrupy saccharine as Michael Stipe's on a bad day, the music is almost ethereal at times.  The cover is silly as is the title, but the music is incredible.  I am happy that, once again, Amazon reviewers led me in the right direction.  I have ordered the \\"At War with The Mystics\\" CD and look very much forward to hearing it.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I thought I was getting a normal, regular game of Solitare.  This has got everything but that - most of these games are completely unrecognizable to me!!  Don't waste the money!!

B0000CABJ1|5.0|If you were a teenager of the 70's how can you not know Donna Summer. She put out some great hits at that time that people were dancing to. The songs on this album are great and they bring back many memories of that fun time. Total Enjoyment.
B0061QD82E|5.0|As you can see From The Title,I Don't care for this movie lol.<br />I watched it with my 12year old son on Blu-Ray,It was Eye candy.<br />It looks like it was made today.Walt Disney spent a lot of time restoring<br />This. It really shows. They don't make cartoons like this anymore.<br />The backgrounds are just amazing.There were very creative people back in the year 1955.<br />It's been a long time since I saw this as a child.It was a treat for me.<br />This will be my all time Great disney cartoon to watch over and over again.<br />The Blu-ray is Amazing!! 'Would add it to your collection of Disney greats!

B00000J2PH|5.0|Great Album/CD brought back many memories as I remember when this was released back when it was an album. Nice songs and great to listen too when sitting back and relaxing.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I already knew a fair bit about jobs but this book is a true biography of a true legend. His story had to be documented and documented well. I am glad Walter Isaacson wrote this book - I doubt anyone else could have told the story in a better way.  It does not try to sugarcoat Jobs' personality and takes you on a journey through a brilliant yet crazy mind of Jobs. Oscar Levant once said - \\"There is a thin line between genius and insanity\\". Nothing personifies jobs better.<br /><br />Any person in business must read this book. The most successful CEO of all times  - this is a story of how self-belief, tenacity and iron-will can change the impossible into possible.  Focus and follow your vision rest is mere distraction. If you are sane enough you'll disapprove of him, if you are crazy enough, you'll understand him. Here's to the crazies...
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app. is perfect for the first time User. It's quick to learn. I would recomend this game to everyone.

B004T2QZL8|3.0|While they fixed the stability problems with this game, it still seems to be missing the arcade games in the extras. I used to have it on my iPod touch, and I'm a little worried if  they haven't managed to port that part in two years' time.
B006H53KV8|5.0|Doris' first song on her wonderful new record \\"HURRY, IT'S LOVELY UP HERE takes us right up into heaven. A gift of exquisit songs for feelings to come forth... an invitation to love, laugh and cry. I was astonished, how facile and modern Doris Day sings. The average Germans don't know much more than \\"Que sera\\". Her interpretations of YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL and I THINK I LOVE YOU and of course MY BUDDY sound so sincere. The soft-rock song THIS IS THE WAY I DREAMED IT is my favorite. The content of LIFE IS JUST A BOWL OF CHERRIES is exactly what I try to tell my readers: \\"Why are we here, where are we going...\\" ... \\"you worry so, but you can't take your dough when you go... You have to love this woman for what she'd given us with her some 600 songs and 39 films!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this.game is so much fun I even have it on my Iphone its still addictive it was wilorth every penny
B004T2QZL8|1.0|this game is kind of fun at first but it gets stuck every time it just freezes and I just have to wait for my kindle to run out of battery in my opinion save your money this game is not worth a cent

B002MQYOFW|5.0|this is the best series EVER!!!! Suzanne Collins is the best. I love these books, they really pull you into them!! 5 stars.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've previously owned MDR7505's which were great. I wanted a set of cans that I could use on my bus commute. I've been using Bose in-ear phones which sound nice, but wanted more isolation and clarity. So I bought these. Well, they sound great! I listen to various rock, country, jazz, neo-soul for the most part. The frequency response is awesome, and the 7506's are easily driven by my iPad and iPod. I've tried quite a few headphones, and for the price, these are outstanding. Sure, my Sennheiser HD-650's are better, but not by leaps and bounds. I would buy these again in a second. Buy these and save yourself some money instead of overpaying for a product that is not nearly as good. Don't get fooled by the hype (i.e. Beats). Your ears will thank you.
B0000A5BTV|1.0|I got ready to play this and the dvd is for european veiwing. My player would not play this!  It has a #2 which is the zone it is formatted for.  Never heard of this but my computer knew it could not be played and the dvd player said \\"cannot\\".
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I thought this book was awful.  I do not like to see such terrible civilizations even beyond imagination for vilance and evil.  This was not entertaining or informative.  Only an author with a hateful mind could think up such a plot.

B0052GACNM|5.0|Wow, wow, wow, wow....words fail me, but I'll do my best.<br />A powerfully moving and intimate journey inside the timeless stream of classic songs that continue to flow through generations, embodied in their purest form by Tony Bennett who has been the bridge and gracious steward. And in this honored role he is always true to the music, performing with honesty, a natural warmth and moving interpretation of the lyric and note.  He seems to bring out the very best in his collaborators, often in such surprising ways, by providing a safe creative space along with a generosity of spirit, humility and contagious joy of singing/performing.  It is particularly fascinating and delightfully unexpected to see the younger artists such as Lady Gaga, Amy Winehouse, etc., that are at least two generations removed from Bennett, grow into that space he provides and be transformed before one's eyes/ears. At least for me, I felt as though I was discovering these young artists all over again with an expanded appreciation of their individual genius, versatility, depth, intelligence and heart that is in the dna of all classic and timeless musicians and artists.<br /><br />Amy Winehouse was just enchanting, vulnerable and almost eerily sounding as though she were a reincarnation of Billy Holiday...a side to her I hadn't had the pleasure of experiencing, but one that seemed in some ways more fully realized than her 21st century persona, stylistically speaking.  I later read that Amy's true inspiration had been Dinah Washington who it so happens had been a good friend of Tony Bennett's, which tightened their bond.  In fact Tony said, after hearing of Winehouse's death, that she had been his favorite collaborator on this Duets II project.  I can certainly see it in the dvd.  They appeared touchingly close.  A terrible loss.  Truly so talented with so much more there to explore...and sadly gone too soon.<br /><br />Tony went TO the artists rather than having them come to him (or having the songs performed separately and then mixed together) and many of the recordings were done inside their home studios.<br />The intimacy of this way of recording was clearly a key factor in getting these kinds of performances, and it caused me to realize just how one dimensional my experience of these artists had been, and perhaps how much can be lost when that closeness to the music and collaborators is left out of the mix.<br />And on the dvd especially, that sense of intimacy extends to the viewer/listener.  I felt as though I was an invited guest inside the room WITH the artists rather than relegated to outsider voyeurism.<br /><br />There are so many strong performances and great song selections on this dvd/cd it would be hard to choose just one though the Winehouse and Lady Gaga performances were especially memorable.  But the one that lingers and keeps playing in my head is Tony's deeply moving duet with Aretha Franklin of the song, How Do You Keep The Music Playing?.  Two titans of music in the same recording studio for the very first time?  How can that be?  I want MORE of these two together.  I want a duet recording with just the two of them.  PLEEEEZE soon!  The tear that falls from Tony's eye as the two reach the powerful ascending climax is just more evidence of the heart at the core of their human instruments, infusing the song's lyrics with a profound beauty and significance for two who have kept the music playing for us all.  Don't pass up the dvd - the raw, spontaneous 'performances'  as much as their voice recordings, adds dimension that deepens and enlivens the experience tenfold.<br /><br />At 85 Tony sounds amazingly good like the rich flavor of an aged wine.  John Mayer said it so eloquently that being inside Tony's voice is a safe feeling.  A familiar, warm and empathetic blanket to wrap oneself in.  I've fallen in love with Tony Bennett all over again and have the deepest gratitude and respect for his gifts and the gifts of all the artists participating in this project.<br /><br />I would spend my last dime on this dvd and the cd too.  Of course I first saw it for FREE on PBS.<br /><br />And with any luck I suppose, the music never ends....
B007MNV5WU|5.0|angry bride space is now my new addiction. the gravity aspect is really what makes this version of angry birds shine.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I don't reread a lot of books but this one I had to. I had to be part of their lives again. You know they shouldn't be together because they are a disaster. Haven't we all had a relationship at one time that we wish the intensity of the best parts of it could live on forever. Books can do that and why I love to read.
1400034205|5.0|Your personal library wouldn't be complete without a copy of The Razors Edge. So well written it's difficult to put down. The characters are described so well, it's as if you've known them your whole life. The scenery of Paris, the descriptions of their personalities are vividly brought to your imagination. With eloquence and sophistication, the author brings the pages to life. And, the movie isn't bad either...
B007MNV5WU|5.0|it looks awesome I just want it to be free make more review if you agree yay hay yay yay
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I should have saved $6.99 (when it was cheap) and skipped the hype. The writing was juvenile, the characters were unlikable, the overall story was boring and the \\"sex\\" scenes were snooze worthy. Throwing sex scene after sex scene does not make a book erotic or add anything to the character development that's supposed to build between the hero and heroine. I would have rather read the back story between Mrs. Robinson and Christian, only if his character's age had been older at the start of their encounter. There's no need to read the next two installments. This was fifty shades of meh.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great time killer. some games are a bit tedious but over all fairly well done. besides its free so not really much to complain about
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Angry Birds Space takes our favorite birds and brings them to space! The graphics are way better than the first 3. The gravity circles give the game something to write about. Like the description says, the sky is no longer the limit, thanks to Angry Birds Space! This game is definitely worth the $2.99. Thank you, Rovio, for giving your fans something to write about. Best game I have ever bought for the Kindle Fire! I recommend this game to fans of the first 3 games. Happy &quot;space&quot; traveling!!!!!
B006YXTRHY|5.0|Some love Twilight, some don't.  I can't say the movies do the books justice, but I love them nonetheless.
B007G5K066|5.0|I read the book many years ago....it was a great read........the spy world of this story is quite the opposite of Ian Flemming, and this movie brings out the strengths of Le Carre's prose as well as any film adaptation with the exception of The Spy Who Came In From The Cold.<br /><br />The cast is so solid...Gary Oldman is the Smiley I remember, taciturn, plodding, and smart as a whip. Pre-Thacherite London in all its seediness is brilliantly reproduced by the art directors and location managers.....brilliant period look!<br /><br />Th story is simple, but just like the book, it is told in a very opaque manner that makes the audience a participant in the solution of the mystery.  The film will require 100 per cent attention, but trust me, the payoff is soooooooo worth it!<br /><br />If you are in the mood for a thinking man's spy thriller, you will love this movie.  5 stars and the highest recommendation.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so cool i like geting a challenge in it .it is hard but you can still do It it just the point
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been trying to lose those last 10lbs. of baby weight.  Three months ago I joined a gym and worked with a personal trainer to develop a workout tailored just for me.  I went to the gym for 75 minutes three days a week.  After three months of faithful attendance I did not see the results I had hoped for.  I had not lost a single pound!  Granted I had gained muscle but, come on, give a girl a break!  This is the point at which I sought out an alternative and found Jillian's video.  I have been doing level one every day for a week and a half and I have lost three pounds!  The first few days I didn't even have any weights and still felt like the workout was effective. As I am not trying to \\"lose 20lbs in 30 days\\" but am trying to adopt a more healthy lifestyle, I plan to stick with level one until I feel ready to move on.  I am still doing modified push-ups and struggle with one of the weight exercises, and I consider myself to be a fairly fit person. It is nice that once I master level one I can move up. I am thinking of canceling my gym membership.  Admittedly, my favorite thing about this video is that it is 20 minutes. It is something that I can realistically do everyday. This video is challenging, but I would recommend it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|love that game it is fun to play and my grandkids love it to we fight whos going to play first
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Classic songs from a great singer. Regretful passing, but at least we are left with her voice. Listening to this CD brings back great memories.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|you get to cook things and sell them to buy supply and tables and you get a daily girt to buy ovens and other stuff.
B004WOJ6XC|3.0|Well, I´m a huge Rhapsody of Fire fan and I really loved The Frozen Tears Of Angels album, and I had big hopes for this one since Rhapsody cant make anything bad. But it was a bit disappointed when I got it on its release day.<br /><br />While it reminds a bit of The Frozen Tears Of Angels its a different Rhapsody album. I think they tried to experiment on this one, but the result isn't what I had hoped for. And most of the songs seems to lack the love for this kind of music that Turilli and Staropoli always had. You can really see that Luca was trying to get this out as soon as possible so he could quit. I think he have gone tired of doing this after all these years and I think this album shows that as well.<br /><br />But here are some good songs too. The opening track From Chaos To Eternity is really great and seems to pick up where The Frozen Tears Of Angels stopped. Tempesta Di Fuoco is also a good one, their first one with Italian lyrics. Ghosts of Forgotten Worlds.. well, I can only say it sucks. I dont like this one at all, its boring and is a perfect example on that Luca is tired of doing this and rushed the album. Anima Perduta have some epicness to it, but still not as good as it could be. When I first heard Aeons of Raging Darkness it was a bit of a disappointment but later I started to like it more and more and now I think its one of the best songs on the album. I Belong To the Stars is also a good one, a bit different but still catching and interesting.<br />Tornado is a good song, its what you expect of a Rhapsody song, so nothing much to say about that one rather than its a good one.<br /><br />And then we come to the big finalé, Heroes of the Waterfalls' Kingdom. At first I didnt like it, and the guitars where out of place on many places where I think there would be another guitar or maybe some more symphonic stuff, but after a while when you have listen to it a bit more, and listen to the lyrics it starts getting pretty damn good, but still a bitdisappointing ending to this great saga.<br /><br />So overall, I gave it 3 stars because there are too many flaws here, but it also have some great songs. Its a disappointment if you expected a great and majestic finish to this great saga that Rhapsody Of Fire have worked on for so many years. I think its a shame that Luca rushed this, and at the same time the band where talking about how important this album was and bla bla bla. For them I think its a great musical achievement and I would be proud if I came up with something like this, but for the past Rhapsody stuff this dosnt work out that well.<br />I have full respect for the guys and their work on this CD, and I know I should take it for what it is and not for what I wanted it to be, but with Rhapsody thats kinda hard to do.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book had a lame plot, was poorly written, and not worth the hype.  It was repetitive and unrealistic.  I wouldn't have given it any stars if Amazon would have allowed.
B006Z21ZJC|4.0|Well, like the title says. I mean, its Iron Maiden and they are always playing the same stuff live so you would probably think that you didnt need to buy this. But in fact, this one is a bit different since its almost only songs from Brave New World (2000) to The Final Frontier 2010.<br /><br />I like this setlist since I´m a bit tired of the old songs that are played over and over again. Dont get me wrong, I´m a die hard Maiden fan and love their old stuff, but I do also love their new stuff and would like to hear more new songs live. En Vivo deliver just that, and the band is as always in great shape.<br /><br />En Vivo is much better than last one, and Death On The Road. I think the only thing I would complain about if I should is that they have some weird camera angels where they cut the picture in two, filming Janick Gers to the left and Nicko Mcbrain to the right of the screen for example. Now I dont have much problem with that, but it gets too much on this DVD.<br /><br />Great live performance, and if you are into Maiden - Dont miss out on this.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I have all of angry birds game but this is the one. cool.but not free . make a free one I what to play so bad
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Well this is a very entertaining app. If you like playing little cheesy games you'll like this. I thought it was okay.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Really enjoy this new release.  Thank you Rocio for more fun. Took awhile to load on my DROID X, but works great.
B002R5QPRI|3.0|It was an intresting movie.  If you like Whitney Houston you will love this movie.  It had controvercial matter about an interacial couple and it was a movie symbolic of the early 1990's.  I did not find it a great movie, but it wasnt a bad movie either.  Whitney Houston has several great songs from this movie and album and she was in her prime before she got seriously hoooked on the drug and alchol additiction.  She was a beautiful preformer and person

B004IYISSK|3.0|This was a book club read last fall.<br /><br />I REALLY looked forward to the book because the movie had been so moving for me over the years beginning at age 15 when I saw it with my grandmother.<br /><br />Having seen the movie really did ruin the experience of the book.<br /><br />So much of the emotion the movie forced upon me simply didn't come across the same way in the book, particularly the interrelationships between the women or the intensity of their personal struggles.<br /><br />That said, I still enjoyed the additional story elements that didn't make it to the movie and it did provide for decent book club conversation.<br /><br />I really wish I hadn't seen the movie so many times.<br /><br />If you HAVEN'T seen the movie, please avoid it until you've read the book.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|we studied mark twain in school and only read the first two chapters. when i got home i wanted to read more so i looked for it on my kindle. after i got it i could no wait to start reading.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|When going through some terribly rough times in my marriage last year, a good friend recommended this book.<br /><br />Communication breakdown is usually at the core of many relationship woes and I figured mine weren't any different.<br /><br />I found this book to be wonderfully comforting to read and offered me a great deal of personal insight into what the disconnect between me and my partner might have been.<br /><br />I found myself routinely suggesting the book to others, but kept hearing in return 'how religious' it was...I didn't see that.<br /><br />Sure there are some God references, particularly toward the end (though I only remember them vaguely), but I didn't feel like I was sitting in church.<br /><br />I don't think the messages of this book are limited or relegated to 'believers'. Humans are humans and whether one believes in God or not, there are bigger forces and trends at play in this world than what we think are unique to us.<br /><br />If nothing else, it's a comfort to read scenarios that ring familiar when one is in a time of confusion and pain.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book even if you want to learn how to talk to friends and family better.
B004XZDT60|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing! Ed has such a unique sound that definitely sets him apart from other artists. Hopefully he'll have a US release very soon. Definitely recommend this album!

B003YL4LYI|5.0|There was no dancing which was disappointing, but there were dragons and a ton of other crazy things. I've heard some people say this book isn't that great compared to other books in the series, but I found it to be great.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Runs well on kindle fire. Addictive game which requires you to combine 2 elements to create a new one. At times it gets tedious but hints alleviate that without giving away too much. I don't find this to be at all like Alchemy- this requires much more thinking and creativity rather than matching and strategy.
B005FITIK0|4.0|\\"Young Adult\\" is a comedy drama, but being directed by Jason Reitman - known for \\"Thank You for Smoking\\" \\"Juno\\" and \\"Up in the Air\\" - it is not just an ordinary comedy. With Diablo Cody (who wrote for \\"Juno\\" in 2007) as a writer, the director shows us life's uncomfortable little truths in a comical, but somewhat disturbing way. To say people don't change is pretty easy, but to watch it on screen is not very comfortable, even though wrapped up in comical dark humor.<br /><br />Meet Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron), a 37-year-old writer (actually a ghost writer) of young adult novels living in a small Minneapolis apartment room with a Pomeranian. Obviously things are not going well for her as the YA series she has been ghostwriting is about to be cancelled.<br /><br />One day she receives an e-mail from Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson), her ex-boyfriend now happily married in Mercury, Minnesota, where Mavis came from. And to the e-mail is attached a photo of his newborn daughter. Something deep inside her prompts her to travel back to the place she had left years ago, just to win back her former boyfriend ... or perhaps something else she does not know.<br /><br />The story revolves around a person you may find unpleasant. If you think Julia Roberts' character in \\"My Best Friend's Wedding\\" unpleasant, you may find Mavis ten times more so. Self-absorbed Mavis (listening to an old cassette tape again and again) is a kind of person who never grows up. And if she does, she does it with a price to pay.<br /><br />But somehow I couldn't hate Mavis, mainly because of Charlize Theron's superb performance as Mavis, which is the driving force of the comedy that is always bitter and often dark. What she does is, you may find, either hilarious or annoying (or most likely, both), but her portrayal is very real, which will make some audience feel as if looking into a mirror. Patton Oswalt is also wonderful as Matt, who went to the same high school as Mavis (but she hardly remembers anything about him). The interaction between Mavis and Matt (who has a few things to say to Mavis) is one of the best moments of the film.<br /><br />This is not a film that everyone would enjoy watching, but still proves that Jason Reitman is one of the best directors of his generation.

B007B8EX9I|5.0|A Masterpiece Theater show that even dudes can like.  Really darn good.  When does season three come out!?!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is very fun. I like it a lot you should really try to play all the games. these games are the best ever!
B004LWZW88|2.0|My 5 year old son liked it, but us adults were quite bored. I expected more From the makers of Shrek. I guess sometimes it's best to keep the side characters on the side and not make features about them. Donkey would have been a better choice, as at least he has a personality beyond machismo. It's an OK movie, but wasn't reallywhat we expected from all of the hype. It won'tbe one we play again... We'll pass it on to a friend now that we've watched it.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|Id love to be able to play it but It wont install. :( I tried like 50 times. still didn't do anything.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I've never \\"loved\\" the first Star Trek motion picture, but definitly always had every movie.  Now I'm consolidating my various forms of the movies into the one nice box set.  Looks sharp and I'm sure I'm going to enjoy my next Trek marathon.  They are great movies.  If you like Star Wars or even just science fiction, you'll enjoy these.  They have plenty of action, too.
B004I744AS|5.0|Excellent application.  With it comes extra information to further our education, review or asses Scrabble plays.  Why else would we need this?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|addictive and fun, not as easy as it looks. lots of different games. some easier then others. try for free and cant stop.
B004NELBPC|1.0|This is the most slanted &quot;news&quot; you can get. If anyone wants to know why no one reads or trust the news, read the huffington post.
B005T87QCI|4.0|where r atom and Zeus they need to put them on there so kids will buy and hav fun playing it but it was still fun
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|I love this app.  It allows me to stream 720p movies from my home server to my Motorola Atrix, Asus Transformer and Nook Color with an interface that easy enough for my wife and kids to use.  I even use plex with my google tv.  When I am on wifi, video never seems to buffer, even at hd quality.  Even on AT&amp;T's cellular network, I can stream a movie to my phone for the kids to watch anywhere, usually without any buffering once it starts.  Keep up the good work.  My only complaint is that it took amazon almost two months longer than the google market to get the last update.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|This is terrible. Amazon really expects me two pay three dollars for this crap. Not in this lifetime, I already paid 200$ for the freaking tablet. Really??
0439023491|5.0|Excellent! My teenage sons and I both have enjoyed the Hunger Games series. Any book that will get my kids to put down a video game controller must be a GREAT book! This series is a quick read and from the very first chapter, you won't want to put it down.
B006E4QCXU|2.0|This app was cool at first, but it gets old. I imagine it as something that is there to entertain a child, not be fun for an adult.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a must read for anyone who enjoys a good heart thumping adventure! Although the concept of the story can be a gruesome and hard to accept at times, it meets all the criteria for a good book. It has moral conflict, good versus evil, and a little romance too. The Hunger Games have forced my teens to put down their video games and pick up books again!
B006PHD0RW|3.0|Nothing great here. It is fun for a little while but it is more of the same as you continue playing it.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|love it favorite game since angry birds.  takes up my free time nicely. lots of levels for lots of play
B0058VW36U|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Many different levels to play and it definitely can be challenging. A must have for your Kindle Fire.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|Kindle fire cant support the camera and that really sucks! But  in the gallery they have a ton of really neat pictures! ;)
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is humiliated for writing a story in his magazine that causes him to lose a libel lawsuit in court. The billionaire businessman, Hans-Erik Wennerstr&ouml;m, that Mikael writes about sues him and wins and thus financially ruins him. Mikael's magazine is now in deep financial trouble.<br /><br />He is hired to write a family background about the Vanger family by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) who is a Swedish industrial magnate. Reluctantly he takes the job as his he is broke and frankly needs the money. He is also promised some real dirt on Wennerstr&ouml;m so he could possibly get revenge. Henrik also wants Mikael to review the details in the disappearance of his grandniece Harriet that took place 40 years before.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) is a private investigator that did an extensive background check on Mikael for the Vangers is hired to help him solve the disappearance. They suddenly find themselves involved in the search for a serial killer whose murders span more than 40 years...<br /><br />I had real reservations watching an American made version of this movie. My wife and I had watched the original movie and we both liked it a lot. I thought this would just be a remake and I would not enjoy it a second time. I was wrong! There are some changes to the movie but it substantially follows the original closely. The acting is superb and Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig are just marvelous in this movie. If you like the original then you will love this one also.<br /><br />Just be aware that there is graphic violence and gruesome murder photos in the movie as well as sex and rape. If this is not your type of movie then be warned.<br /><br />This movie is every bit as good as the original and they are both 5 Star movies!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this app is entertaining. it keeps you busy when u wanna play something that takes time.I think everyone will enjoy this.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|I've actually met some people who've never heard of Adele...  I'm always dumbfounded when that happens.  If you're one of those, you're missing out on the greatest musical experience in history.  You have to get this and listen to it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series of books are amazing.  I haven't read anything so thrilling in a long time.  I was unable to stop reading it, fabulous work by Suzanne Collins.  I love her imagination.  I hope she brings out another series like this.

B000YMJA7I|5.0|Despite die hard fans and the band itself not so good opinions about this release, it's a really good compilation, if you have heard bits of Guns n Roses and found yourself enjoying them, this is a no brainer purchase, even more if you got it at 25 cents like many of us did.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I enjoy playing this game all the time. It really zones me out when I'm having a bad day.. woohoo!
B000V8A31C|5.0|Jean-Yves Thibaudet and Dario Marianelli never dissapoint, I happened to enjoy the soundtrack as much as I enjoyed the film. Among the tracks, the one I found more enticing was \\"Your Hands are Cold\\", pure piano delight.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Not like the original birdness but it's fresh and new challenges for veterans...i would call this a winner...and I am cheap so I will put up with the ads
B005NNUKF4|4.0|Got in when it was 2.99 just out of curiosity, and having never listened to Pink Floyd, I found this release pleasing. Even though I don't find myself crazy about it, it's a good album.
0307949486|5.0|When a writer does a lot of reading, they often read books in which they think to themselves, \\"hell, I can write better than this!\\"  But when I read Stieg Larsson's writing, I think to myself, \\"hell, I wish I can write like this!\\"<br /><br />'The Girl' trilogy has been around for a few years, but I wasn't introduced to it until last year.  Like many, I fell in love with the complex writing.  A writer's job is to be honest with the reader, even if the writer is writing fiction.  But when a writer is writing a fictional story, based on their own studies, there is a sense of authenticity to it that makes it rare among the gazillion stories out there.  That's what makes these three books fascinating, there was some truth behind its complex story-telling.  Sure, it's a bit indulgent and could have used 100 pages (or so) of trimming.  But then we wouldn't get character development a lot of writers (such as Stephenie Meyer) has trouble with.<br /><br />The buzz of these books are high.  And I have a feeling, these books will be remembered for many more years to come.  Larsson deserves that much for crafting great work many authors (such as myself) could never live up to it.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I can't think of an album or a band that would've been more fitting to Tron Legacy, for an awesome movie, an awesome soundtrack. This is a purchase I do not regret.
0062082353|3.0|To start off, I'd like to note that Mr. Chris Kyle has my full respect for his sevice to our country and for his bravery on the battlefield.<br /><br />I really wanted to enjoy this book.  I thought it would have all the fixings of a great war film with inclusions of SEAL's stuff that would make this even better.<br />In reality, this book is just ramblings.  Short paragraphs that don't really say a whole lot.<br />I felt like the author kept contradicting himself throughout the book.  He would state that he was humble, modest, and didn't care about medals and honors, yet he made it a point throughout the book to dictate to you that he was bad-ass, the best, and his reputation was legend.  Perhaps he is a bad ass, one to be reckoned with, but the more he tries to drill that in your mind, the more off-putting it becomes.<br /><br />I couldn't wait to be done with the book and go on to something else.  I'd like to give this 2.5 stars, but to be fair, I did finish the book and found some of it interesting so I opted for 3.<br /><br />The reviews are all about Mr. Kyle being a True American Hero.  He deserves 5, heck 10 stars for being a hero, but only 3 for his literary work.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and the first blu-ray I ever bought. I recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh and the bonus features are extensive and fun to watch. Best purchase I ever made.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not sure what finally convinced me to drop five bucks on this (I tend to not download anything that would require me to burn more cash than the $3.99/book or less I could spend at the local used book store) but I am *so* glad I did.  This work is the ultimate in speculative fiction - sci-fi, horror, post-apocalyptic, dystopian - with just the right amount of authentic-feeling love sprinkled in to make appeal to a wide audience.<br /><br />Wool was wonderfully written and competently edited (a breath of fresh air in a sea of poorly posted works), a story that resonated, hooked me from the get-go and wouldn't let me go, that brought tears to my eyes and made me think, that made me angry and made me hopeful.<br /><br />This is by far my best Kindle find out of hundreds, and I loved this Omnibus so much that it earns my first Amazon review, ever!  If you adore a well-crafted and beautifully told story, download this now.  You won't regret it.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|ok so we are charged 2.99 for this game. Which I don't mind. However, you give us only 2 levels then tease us with the third saying &quot;coming soon &quot;. I am already almost through all of the games.  That is disappointing for a game that cost so much.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like that the game has a bunch not just the same stuff every time. really fun game's to play some more challenging then others
B0068FYZZW|5.0|Loved this movie when it first came out  and still love it.  I purchase it so my girls could watch it.  Best movie about peer pressure in high school.  A must see for parents with kids in high school!  I love the characters and love that they all went on to have great film careers.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|fun to play .addictive. my bf plays all the time. good time waster... really good graphics on the kindle fire
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I'd only heard of Lana Del Rey peripherally. For the longest time, I had no idea who she was, or what she did, that caused so many people to talk about her. I then-finally-heard her perform a couple of her songs ; I ordered her album, Born To Die, straightaway. I have since listened to her cd twice over. I do have my favorite tracks, but each song is so great. Her writing-and moreover, her amazing voice-make Born To Die an easy 5-star rating for me. I cannot get enough of her music.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|fixed the crash and close.. i love/d the game.. addicted to it.. now more mixing.. cant wait til more hints to load.  :p
B003UESJHE|5.0|This is just one of those movies that you can watch over and over and never get sick of. The acting is great, the story is great, and the cinematography is great.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow, what a book!  This book will make you think, laugh, hold your breath, and DEFINITELY lose sleep (not because of the nightmares, but because you cannot stop reading!).  I spend much of my time reading non-fiction medical literature, so finding a good fiction book that is captivating is crucial for me.  Suzanne Collins nailed it with this book.  I can't wait to read the next two.  AND, only $5 on the Kindle...this is a steal!

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Mockingjay is a superb finale to The Hunger Games trilogy. However, the book wasn't as good as the first two in the series. There was a few character deaths, but the way they died seemed very anti-climatic. I was expecting Katniss to be hurt a lot more over the person getting mauled by the muttations, but it didn't seem to bother her as much as I thought it would. Out of the new characters, I liked Boggs the best. The character I hated the most in Mockingjay surprisingly wasn't President Snow. I actually began to like him towards the end of the book. The character I hated the most was Coin. I disliked her attitude, the way she used Katniss, and what she wanted to do towards the end of the book. The plot had a lot of crazy twists and turns, but not as many as the previous books in the series. A lot of the plot twists in this book made me so mad I wanted to throw my Kindle when I was reading. Am I the only one that hopes Suzanne Collins writes a spin-off series about Katniss children with the man she chose? I thought the ending of the book was good, but it had so much more potential. Mockingjay was an incredible book, but it fell short of what I was expecting.

B004M9ZI0M|1.0|I was interested in this on the strength of \\"Titus\\". Unfortunately, this is probably the dullest and least imaginative \\"Tempest\\" I've ever seen. Taymor turned Prospero into \\"Prospera\\", found a nice location, added a few early Disney era \\"special\\" effects, and seemed to think that this should somehow merit attention. It doesn't.

B0059XTTW8|2.0|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a sad compilation of banal performances by actors who should know better, in a very slow moving, almost boring presentation unworthy of being tied to the great novel by John le Carre. A real case of unjustified hype surrounds this DVD.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I can't describe the magic that Joe Bonamassa creates with his music at this spectacular concert.  Before getting the DVD, I saw a live interview with Joe on our PBS station and I was convinced that I needed to order the Royal Albert Hall performance.  It was stunning which also incudes his singing.  If you like blues and beyond, this is the perfect prescription for becoming a Joe Bonamassa fan!  The variety of his songs is phenomenal as he moves you from one sound and beat to another.  It's a fantastic musical journey that totally intoxicates me.  I was spellbound by Joe's \\"India\\" number when he comes back to the stage for the encore.  I can't stop raving about the gamut of emotions that I feel during this concert.  After playing the DVD, Joe's music is with me off and on during the day and sometimes it's there when I wake up in the middle of the night!  Beautiful!
B003EYVXV4|5.0|Wow, the Hunger Games. I found this movie to be very provocative. There are so many ways you can take this knowledge. Unfortunately, when it comes to fiction books I am basically illiterate. Therefore, I really enjoy a nice representation on the big screen. The premise of this movie seems to be on solid footing. Impressive that the midnight showing of a new movie is packed from floor to ceiling. This movie is definitely one to see if you're into sci-fi and pseudo-political movies. When seen in a certain light, the undertones of the movie cast a painful light on our current society. This is an incriminating view of the may be called the caste system in America. It is also a hopeful view of the uniquely heterogeneous unity we have as a nation. For those of you were going to see the movie I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I just read the section \\"Why entrepreneurs shouldn't use a PR firm\\" last weekend and I was inspired to send out my own email to local media. I used the format provided and sent one out to all of the local TV stations and newspapers on behalf of my company artconnect.ca<br /><br />This proved to be an excellent plan! Today a rep from the leading morning TV talk show in my city (Edmonton) called me. They want to feature my company on their show on April 13th. This is HUGE exposure.<br /><br />Thanks so much for the inspiration. Reading this gave me the confidence to take publicity into my own hands.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|why cant there be a free version think if you want the ratings to go up make a free version!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Perfect. Works exactly as promised. Have reccomended to many. No worries. Runs on Kindle Fire as hoped.  Worth the price.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|thanks for the free version the only problem is for angry birds space why isn't it free?  I mean come on man that's not fair!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The best game EVER! So many games in one game is very convenient. They are good games and not ones that are boring. You have to buy the games with points that you earn after completing the first twelve games genius!
B0000DJZAH|5.0|I think enough has been said about the importance of this album, and not just the importance, but just the sheer awesomeness of it, so I won't delve too deeply into that (and I'm probably too musically illiterate to really expound too greatly on its actual importance anyway!), so I'll just talk a bit about the 5.1 mix.<br /><br />Some people might be 2 channel purists, and I respect that. I have a pretty decent 2 channel listening set up, too, but this album has an excellent, non-gimmicky 5.1 mix, as well. I think that the only \\"drawback\\" is that your system needs to be almost perfectly calibrated and balanced. You aren't going to like this if you have some puny rear/side channel speakers that are essentially holdovers from a Pro-Logic system. You'll definitely want 5 full range speakers of damn near equal quality. Also, you will need your delays set up just about perfectly. Many of the songs have vocals coming from all (or at least center + rear) that, when properly timed, make it sound like the voice is emerging from an indefinite point in the middle of the room or even you yourself. It's a VERY odd sensation.<br /><br />However, if your delays are off by much at all (I had to tell my receiver that they were SIX INCHES closer than it determined they were based on the auto set up) it will ssssssound like the recording hasssss a very pronounoucccced sssssibilance. When I first popped it in to what I thought was a decently calibrated system, I was shocked at that grating, irritating sibilance, but after tweaking the system just a little bit, focused the sound.<br /><br />This is great if you have a listening seat set up for ONE person, but if you have other picky friends listening to it, they might not be as impressed as you are with your sound. This is one of the only multichannel recordings that has vocals positioned like this. It's really cool, but is soooo affected by listener and speaker position that it just might drive you a little batty at first!
B004NELBPC|1.0|I like to consider myself a moderate. Socially liberal and fiscally conservative. I used to like Huff Po but after a while I grew weary of the obvious bias in all their articles and anaysis. It's no worse than FOX News which is equally as bias if not more. The only difference is that one is a biased right wing propaganda machine and the other is a biased left wing propaganda machine. Either way, they're both pushing an agenda.<br /><br />If you're looking for objective articles dealing with actual facts, figures and covering news from all the angles, keep looking. You won't find it here.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I would recommend this game if you like Mahjong games you will love Mahjong Artifacts. It is very exciting and fun to play.  If you are bored and need something to help pass the time away this Mahjong Artifacts is that game.
0545265355|5.0|My daughter and I both have a hard time finding books that keep us interested enough to read the whole book. My daughter is 10 and Has A.D.D. so it is very hard for her to focus to read books. That being said... these books were so good that we book read the complete series and my daughter liked them so much she has read them 9 times already. If you like a good love story with action in the mix this series is for you!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Truly a great game! It turns what you love about Angry Birds into a space odyssey. Still just as challenging too with new ways for the burrs to attack!
0060899220|5.0|I'm going to keep this brief.<br /><br />I hated Anthony Bourdain. Whenever his program(s) would come on Travel Channel, while I was watching Andrew Zimmern or Adam Richman, I'd groan and change the channel. I hated this crass, downright dirty man... he is pretty much the antithesis of everything that I stand for.. at least, that was my initial and television devised impression of him.<br /><br />When I came across this book though, I was surprisingly drawn to it for some reason. I heard that it was a classic and I was interested in reading all about the \\"culinary underbelly\\"... being the \\"foodie\\" that I am.<br /><br />So I picked it up at the bookstore and couldn't put it down. It was amazing. First of all, it's a world I can only imagine in my dreams (or my imagination) but the way Bourdain writes, I found myself captivated by his in depth stories and frankly, his bluntness of telling it like it is. Not only that, but I've come to appreciate and understand somewhat how he is... and I can even relate to his \\"antisocial\\" behavior and not understanding human behavior. I connected through literature with someone who I never thought I ever would and that quite honestly amazed me.<br /><br />I look forward to reading some of his other books and I definitely think this is a book that everyone should take the time to read.
0307949435|4.0|I found this book to be interesting... granted it was a bit \\"wordy\\" and \\"technical\\" but it opened my eyes to how to effectively lose weight and keep it off.  I've noticed so many obese people lately (especially kids) and this is due to a diet high in simple carbs (as well as a lack of exercise). I finally got fed up with my belly fat and decided to do something about it. I found out about this book from reading an interview with the author and it has helped me to better understand carb consumption. After reading several of the other reviews here, I was happy to learn that it seems to be working for others.<br /><br />One bit of concern I have is the author, Gary Taubes doesn't want to get his cholesterol levels tested. He has many excuses (he appeared on Doc Oz) as to the reasons why he doesn't want to get tested (kids, stress, lack of sleep, etc). I think at his age he should have a physical every year and get his blood work done. Maybe the 'real' reason is he doesn't want to get tested and share the results publicly is that it will impact book sales. Gary, just get tested and make your cholesterol levels public if you believe in this. Why avoid the truth about what is happening inside your body?<br /><br />Last year, I ran 6-8 miles for two months and the weight just didn't come off.  Sure, I felt better but I was eating a lot of carbs (both simple and complex).  After reading this book, I understand the science behind a low carb lifestyle and how I can lose the weight and keep it off. I had never really thought about the amount of simple carbs I was eating. Now, I'm living almost carb-free (I treat myself a few times a week). Don't consider this a diet... it's a lifestyle change. I love butter, eggs, chicken, salads and lean red meat (in moderation) so this has been fairly easy for me to adjust to.  Going out to restaurants can be tricky but I've learned not to eat the carbs and/or stick to salads (it takes some time to get used to it).<br /><br />Unlike Gary, Ibelieve in exercise and plan on introducing complex carbs back into my diet once I have reached my goal weight. In addition, I will not eat the unlimited red meat and processed meats that he suggests in his book. The book mentions is that you can eat all the processed bacon, sausage and fatty red meats you want. I'm personally not a fan of this so keep that in mind and use this book simply as a resource.  Bacon a few times a week is fine but I wouldn't do it more than that. Lean cuts of meat with greens and veggies will help to keep you lean and mean.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Here are some tips based upon my personal experience...<br /><br />Drink plenty of water.  It really helps flush the toxins from your system.  I strive for 8 full glasses a day. Sparkling water is fine... add lime, lemon or even cucumber slices to it!<br /><br />Do not eat the restricted foods listed in the book for the first few weeks of the program. (Ok, you can treat yourself one or two times per week at the start.) I really love wine... but now only drink a glass or so once a week. No beer at all. You can and should introduce COMPLEX CARBS (not simple carbs) back to your diet once you have reached your goal weight. Monitor your weight closely. If you start to gain weight, then you may need to go easy on the complex carbs again. Chicken, shrimp or lean beef with salad full of veggies is pretty much my staple. Avoid all simple carbs.<br /><br />Exercise!!! Even a 20-min brisk walk helps.  I jog and do cardio as it is good for the heart.<br /><br />I don't buy fatty cuts of red meat (GO LEAN - i.e., New York or Top Sirloin or Ground Beef with less than 10% fat). If you can afford it, buy grass fed/organic meat to avoid the corn that is fed to cows. Watch out for the nitrates in bacon/hot dogs/sausage and don't eat those very often (even though the book says you can have all you want). Be sure to make wise choices and buy quality cuts of meat and try to avoid processed meats if possible. Yourlocal butcher offers better choices (i.e., grass fed) than grocery stores.  Watch \\"Food Inc.\\" to learn about meat and how it is produced.  It will really open your eyes... and help you make better decisions when at the grocery store.<br /><br />Try and get 8 hours of sleep. I know, pretty hard to do but it helps.<br /><br />Fast (just liquids/broth) one day per month. Fasting helps reset your body and cleanse your colon.<br /><br />Take supplements as needed. The low-carb plan lacks vitamin C which you would normally get from orange juice (restricted).<br /><br />IMPORTANT! Monitor your blood levels.  Ask your doctor to order a comprehensive blood test a 6-8 weeks after you have been on the program so you can compare the findings with your previous readings. I really wish the author would do this and put this controversy to bed.<br /><br />---<br /><br />In summary, I used to crave sugary foods and now that I've stopped the carb overload I eat until I'm full and drink plenty of water. If my blood work is fine, I'll be on track to be at my college weight.
B003Y5H5HY|3.0|Okay, I really don't understand what the point of this was... I saw the original, and it was pretty good (4 stars)... This, is pretty much the exact same movie, just with famous Actors. __ Very little (if anything) was changed -- so again, I have to ask, why bother?... To re-do a movie, tit for tat, just to have it done in English... is Not a good enough reason to re-do a movie.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the original, then yes, this would (otherwise) rate 4 Stars as well (because it's the same damn thing, just with different actors & a slightly more attractive \\"Dragon Girl\\", aka \\"Lizbeth\\") ___ But I would absolutely love to know who was stupid enough to PAY to have this movie produced... why a guy like David Fincher would waste his time making an English (language) Mirror-Copy... and who would actually pay money to buy this (or worse, buy theater tickets, if more than 1)... when you can see this, and the other 2 movies (of the trilogy), any time you want, 'Streaming' via Netflix, and so on (or even by free-download from various, nefarious, sites)!!?? ___ WHAT A WASTE, IN EVERY RESPECT.<br /><br />The ONLY reason *Anyone* says, \\"I liked it maybe a little more than the original\\"... is as I said above... because it's in English, Name/Famous Actors, and More Attractive \\"Lizbeth\\"/\\"Dragon-Girl\\"..... those are literally the ONLY differences between the movies... and therefore, the only reason anyone would like it more than the original -- but again -- still doesn't justify making this movie.<br />-- Likewise, most people who would say, \\"The original is more suspenseful\\"... Well, that's the drawback to 'Suspense' films... once you've seen it, it's never as suspenseful in later viewings (or in 'mirror-image', English versions).  By itself, this is just as suspenseful as the original... so long as you haven't seen the original, and don't know what's coming, and so on.<br /><br />PS: Regarding my earlier statement, \\"I would love to know why a guy like David Fincher wouldwaste his time making this\\"... LOL... Well, he did make \\"The Social Network\\" (talk about waste of money & film)... but come on, an interpretation of an interpretation; or mirror-image w/ different cast... Seems to me he can't come up with anything remotely original & intriguing (like Se7en and Fight Club were), so he's taking \\"jobs\\" that he knows will be successful, as long as he turns in half decent work. _ I for one, miss the old, *Creative*, David Fincher. __ The most creative thing about this movie (and the only Different thing, vs. the original), was the \\"Opening Credit Sequence\\"... THAT was amazing... Unfortunately, Fincher didn't do that... it was outsourced to an Artist, according to his own commentary track.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|Every once in a while magic happens. This show encompasses that. The casting is superb. The emotion and rawness flow effortlessly. Very rarely does a show not only follow the book almost precisely, but it also carries the same tone without loosing anything in the interpretation. My hat is off to everyone involved in the production of this masterpiece.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|All I have to say is this is Great!! Love love love! Don't even mind paying $2.99 for it! Rovio, a huge round of applause to YOU!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love these games and have had no issues at all. I like the variety and look forward to unlocking more games!!
0066620996|5.0|Yes, Jim Collins did it here.  At first I did not like his reading style.  But then I got into it.  When I say reading style, I listened to it on Audible.com.  Towards the half way point, it seemed like I just got his style and I started grooving much better.  The content is absolutely priceless.  It sounds non-biased.  Unfortunate that several of the companies picked are no longer around, but that is not Jim's fault or even necessarily a bad thing.  The data still brings you to the right MUST DO's and MUST NOT DO's.  Get this book if you own, or act like you own a business and want to grow.  Don't be turned off that all the companies listed are Publically traded co's.  The reason he picked them, is the data is free, the data is there, and the data is accurate.  You can apply this in every day life, not even in business.  Read between the lines when you read the book.  It's a must must read.  Five stars for me.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Wonderful fun. Playing with gravity makes it different than the originals. Works on Xoom, HTC Flyer....download keeps failing on Droid3.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|great show. I love it. dvd's in perfect shape. thanks for the dvd's, and I would buy them again if needed.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|And yet another one. They did it again. Time to be addicted to another game. Can't put down the phone for a while.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I really love this game but its not free and my mom wont let me get games that cost money so either make it free or a lot cheaper
B004UID2LC|4.0|this app is simply and better than Tubemate u can go to your user name without sigining in ....theres<br />my 2&cent;
B006M4RN3U|4.0|Big, full harmonies, sunny melodies, a twisted sense of humor... It's hard not to enjoy \\"Some Nights\\" by Fun. Ambition to burn, big grandiose production, lyrics that sting a little deeper as you listen, this is an album that aims high. \\"Some Nights\\" will thrill old classic rock fans as it echoes their memories of Queen and ELO, at the same time uses modern beats and (although I consider it a drawback) autotune on a few songs.<br /><br />Fun does a great job in pulling its influences into a full sounding album. I can listen to this and play spot the resource over and over. Even better, I can listen to this disc over and over. The combined influences still ride a pop rail, and \\"Some Nights\\" is an early contender in my faves for 2012.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|It's great having a Bible with me where ever I go. It gives you access to multiple versions. I'll update my review as I use it more.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Hell's Corner was a great read. I couldn't put book down . . . and was one of the best of Balducci's Oliver Stone series. I hope Balducci continues with Oliver Stone and the rest of the Camel Club.
0385534639|4.0|What a great first novel by an author! Night Circus has a plethora of characters, all as mysterious as the circus itself. But there are two special characters who are in a competition not of they're making. One who has natural gifts, the other has learned them. Who will triumph?<br /><br />This is a book that has some of the most beautiful descriptions, it is so rich and colorful that it becomes almost tangible. I really enjoyed that.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book a lot. And I can honestly say I will read this authors future works.
1594744769|2.0|I had high hopes for this book and looked forward to reading it.  It started off slow, got a little better, than got slow again, and finally got a bit better.  I thought this would be more of a suspenseful mystery, but it was much more Sci Fi than I ever expected.  Monsters and time travel were not what I was expecting.  The black and white pics throughout the book does give the story some extra creepiness at times, but that's about the only positive.  I mean the main character keeps making out with his grandfather's ex girlfriend who is stuck at age 16, but she is quick to remind you she is actually 88.  Weird and creepy!  I saw another review that says it's basically X-Men for elementary kids.  Good summary.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Simply but eloquently written, these 5 stories will catch your attention and hold it. Truly stories you will have difficulty putting down. Thought provoking and intelligent, these stories will wend their way into your mind and make you think, and think hard. Highly recommend.
B0061QD7ZM|5.0|This was a great price for this DVD 2-disc set, about $10 less than anyplace else, plus free shipping. I received it in just a few days. My 2 and 4-year old granddaughters loved the movie! I got them each a Lady & The Tramp nightgown, and both wore them while watching the movie with grandma and grandpa!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Simply fun, witty, creative, brings Sherlock into our time with exquisite class and artistry. Benedict and Martin are so fun to watch together, and they have such chemistry, its ridiculous!  WATCH SHERLOCK SEASON 1 and then PRE-ORDER SEASON 2 ASAP!!!!
B003E6K1VK|5.0|Bought this is Oct 2011 and have been using since then mostly with my laptop (Dell Inspiron 1545). My laptop has a basic Creative soundcard and I needed to add a little more punch to my sound, especially movies and of course, my mp3s. I use an old pair of Sony headphones, MDR-CD370, which have long been discontinued but as with most Sony products, they lasted really long. I must say that the FiiO E7 does its job pretty well. The bass is quite clear and I can hear the Lows without any noticeable distortion. Had to play with some of my soundcard settings (Speaker Properties > Enhancements > Frequency/BassBoost Levels) to get it right for my ear. But with some initial hours of play, the sound was perfect. The Volume goes from 0 to 60 (don't know the units, yet), and I'm usually content around 32. To test the performance in the Mid and High-range, I also tried using this amp with a friend's Sony's MDR-V6 (which are fairly decent for Mids and Highs) and the FiiO E7 delivered crisp sound even on those.<br /><br />This being my first portable, desktop amp purchase and given my limited budget, I went for the FiiO E7 and I'm quite happy with them. Later, down the line I do plan to go for a higher grade headphone amp, but plan to use this one for at least a couple of years. I hope the rechargeable battery works fine for the next 2-3 years and even if it dies, I hope the manufacturer supplies replacement batteries on Amazon (haven't checked it yet).<br /><br />So far so good (as on Fri 23 March, 2012). If I run into troubles or notice any change in performance, I will add it here. Until then, enjoy the FiiO E7 if you are planning to buy it.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|When will the free version come out for K Fire Rovio? Anyway love this game!(x10000000000000000). Since you did the finale frontier, you should try a underwater one and call it Angry Birds: Sea or wudeva. Good job again guys! looking forward to updates!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its alright I suppose. Some of the games are really dumb but on the other hand some are great. I hate the air hockey.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|This is a really cool and useful app. I can use Microsoft word at school from this and it helps in school. But it legs a lot and it shuts down on me. It is better if u have a bigger screen because its hard to press stuff. But over all its a cool app I just wish it wouldn't shut down on me.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|World War Z reads like a first hand account of a zombie invasion.  It's almost as if it's actually happening.  While reading this I have to say I almost forgot that it's fiction...it got me thinking 'What if?'.  Each person \\"interviewed\\" has their own personality, some are crazy, some are cold, some are gentle, some extremely selfish, but each character makes this seem more real.  I only wish that the author would have dug a little further and given us exactly the reason that the zombies came into existance, what caused the infection to begin with?  The ending was great, but as with each page I wanted more (in a good way).
0670022411|5.0|I saw a woman reading this on the subway and thought I'd pick it up at the library.  Once I got it home, I read the inside cover and was nervous I'd just picked up a vampire romance novel - or worse, a pretentiously dressed up Twilight copy-cat.  Instead, this is a richly written story about a heroine who can hold her own (finally!) and her fight for truth, in a confusing world of magic.  Harkness weaves history, science, and romance throughout this story so fluidly, it's easy to breeze through the almost 600 pages in just a couple of days.  This book avoids all of the major eye-rolling traps commonly associated with tales of vampires and witches, and I was very surprised to note how excited I was to read the next in the trilogy!  Read it, you won't be sorry.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this game is so fun and addictive I have already beat the game.if you liked angry birds you'll like it even more in space!
B0055S348W|4.0|Crazy useful.  Granted you can do almost everything this app does with free tools, this has been super fast and convenient. More then it saves time, it saves headaches.  4 stars. (5 star ratings are reserved for absolutely epic apps only).  =]
0316056863|1.0|So, so disappointed. I love Tina Fey, but this book, not so much. I did not find it laugh out loud funny. I found the flow of the book choppy and jumping all over the place. It felt forced.
B003ES61EE|1.0|I am a nature photographer, and used this particular lens cleaner in the field today, for the first time.  The brush end is okay, but the \\"eraser\\" end IS TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE.  Now I have to spend another ten or so dollars to replace this in my photo kit.  I am NOT going to buy the replacement at Amazon!
B005PK1G76|5.0|I bought this organizer for myself (I own a Joovy Caboose) as well as for one of my  friends ( she owns a Quinny Freestyle 3XL).<br />I must admit that I was a bit sceptical due to the low price but let me reassure you that this organizer is flat out fabulous. It easily holds four bottles, attaches to your stroller handle with easy to adjust velcro and it fits virtually every stroller model out there.<br />This is a great steal compared to all the other parent organizers out there. The only draw back is the big red logo on the  organizer but that's really it.<br />Go ahead and save yourself some money - this is a great buy!
B005ZUR724|1.0|i gave this game 1 star because the price is to high put<br />it to free at least warning look before you do something<br />(lower the price).
B001PPLJIQ|2.0|We are asked to believe that a Nazi war criminal would rather accept the total blame and consequent long prison term for a monstrous crime of which she was a willing participant though not the instigator, allowing that person to escape a similar lengthy punishment, merely to disguise the fact that she is illiterate.  I'm sorry but history shows that Nazis war criminals did virtually anything in their power to escape detection and punishment.<br /><br />Moreover, we are also asked to sympathize with her plight because she has a love of literature which she has never been able to indulge because of her illiteracy and because she once behaved kindly (if that is the most appropriate word!) towards a boy who was previously a stranger to her.<br /><br />These are not the only facets of this pointless concoction to stretch the bounds of credibility to breaking point but it would involve spoilers to reveal more.  I haven't read the book so I don't know if the film is an accurate reflection.  Perhaps I will as it is sitting on my shelf and I am not illiterate (or, completely, naïve and gullible!) although, doubtless, because I have given an honest view of my reaction to it, some will accuse me of an inability to read the subtleties of the story.  For a much truer reflection of the gross abuse of power and the seeming powerlessness of the individual in the face of state sanctioned indoctrination I would thoroughly recommend the marvellous, The Lives of Others.
B001QOGYFO|5.0|Sexiest man I ever saw!!! Tall, tattooed and built!!! Perfect!!! It's also a really good movie! I recommend it to everyone. Excellent cast and good story. Oh... and did I mention Alex is freakin' delectable!?!? Ladies and gay guys - seriously check this out!!!
B004FOA84A|5.0|OMG! I love this app, it certainly keeps me engaged and holds my attention with suspense. I really enjoy this game and I love playing it late at night. I turn the TV off along with the lights and I get lost in this game.  I love it. You will enjoy it too, give it a try and see what I mean. I get tingely and a bit scary<br />It feels like you are in a scary story. I HECKA LIKE IT.
0316017930|5.0|For those who enjoyed \\"The Tipping Point,\\" this is another of Gladwell's masterpieces. The book truly defines outliers in almost every field and challenges well known assumptions about success, intelligence and the factors that contribute to achieving greatness.  In a society focused on instant gratification and a generation that expects quick rewards, Gladwell's 10,000 hour rule reminds us that success does not come easy, even if you are endowed with the highest IQ in the world.  Persistent hard work over a long period of time along with cultural, social and geographical factors play a huge role in determining who gets to reach the pinnacle of achievement.  Gladwell's concept of the perfect timing also intrigues the reader. The hockey players born in January or the technology titans born in the mid 1950s are examples of \\"perfect timing\\" working in your favor to make you successful.<br /><br />The concepts presented in the book are truly inspiring to all ages.  I highly recommend the book.<br /><br />Amol Nirgudkar, CPA<br />Managing Partner<br />Reliance Consulting LLC<br />[...]
B002R5QPRI|5.0|Excellent Movie!  Since Whitney Houston's death, the Satellite Channel, Lifetime, has played 'The Bodyguard' several times....oh, but with those darn commercials...<br /><br />Now that I own the movie on DVD....it's so easy to watch (without commercials!)  So, Amazon, your website 'works' for me in that I'm on SS Disability Income only and your prices are wonderful, your products are just as wonderful!  Thank you!<br /><br />This is Whitney's movie debut!  Wonderful acting by all!  In my opinion, worth watching over and over and over.....!<br /><br />Thanks again.....<br /><br />Felice Lemoine<br />feefeelsu@yahoo.com
1595827684|5.0|This book is wonderful. The art depicted within is quite beautiful, especially when viewed by someone who has followed the series since its inception six years ago. Seeing what characters looked like at first, how they changed, and what they almost were is intriguing. Definitely recommend this book for anyone who is a fan of Mass Effect or anyone who happens to appreciate the immense art that goes into games.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|My husband and I just started playing Angry Birds and we are hooked! I loved the a.b. Rio but this is my new fav!  It has more twist to the game that make it a lot more fun to play but doesn't make it too hard to play. Even my two year old loves trying to &quot;make birdies fly&quot;. I would recommend this to ANYONE!
B005COO1X6|1.0|The story had potential, but was probably scribbled-out in a day. Ghost writer or 1st-yr Journalism major? Not his best stuff.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|the book was really good! I couldn't put it down. the author wrote in so much detail,you could picture in your head. The movie was just like the book
B005CA4SQK|5.0|I won't waste too many words on how amazing the show is, most everyone knows by now. The Walking Dead broke almost every regular cable ratings record that exists.  Like Breaking Bad, & Mad Men, this is an HBO quality show, that happens to be on regular cable. AMC has simply been killng it lately!  As for the Blu-Ray itself, it easily lives up to the quality of the show. The picture quality is excellent, the sound quality is stunning, & the extras are great: tons of making of docs, special fx featurettes, etc. Plus, I really love the inclusion of the black & white version of the pilot episode (a b&w version was also included on the Blu-Ray of Darabont's highly underrated adaptation of StephenKing's \\"The Mist\\"). Overall, a five star show, & a five star Blu-Ray! A must own!
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I tried downloading this on my Samsung Stratosphere and it didn't work. I might try downloading again after some updates. BUT I also downloaded it on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and it worked like a charm on that. Extremely fun!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I enjoy this game, as well as bakery story and fashion story. If you've ever played cafe world, it is very similar, but without the freezing issues that cafe world has. Its a fun, easy way to pass time.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Oh My!  I can't stop biting my lip!<br />I'm not sure which was worse- the ham fisted references to Ana barely ever eating (seriously, she never wants to eat, ever!) just so that Christian's character could have some attempt at character depth (I was starved as a child so now I have hang ups about food!) OR the inanely dull exchanges of email messages as a plot device.<br />I cannot BELIEVE this book is such a success!  Honestly, it isn't the worst book in the world, despite the dull heroine, the creepy guy, the bad geography, the unbelievable naivete of the main character, the flushes, blushes and non-stop lip biting, the story does have a compelling quality to it.<br />But I was seriously mad at myself for sticking with it and wasting those hours of my life.  It's poorly edited, the dialog is ridiculous, and mentioning her inner goddess all the time made me want to punch her.<br />All in all the heorine is a dud, the hero is a super creep and any interest I may have had in the story initially was killed by the book's endless faults.  I cannot fathom putting myself through two more books with these horrible people.  How can SO many people have loved this?  It baffles me!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Fun game that I play every once in a while. Great graphics for a game that I got for free.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I see there are over 1,000 reviews for this book, so I doubt that I can add anything other than my own opinion.<br />I had thought this would be a fairly light, fluffy tale about still another family of Witches - on the line of Linda Wisdom or Debora Geary (sorry, Deb - I love your books).<br />But, well - hoom hom..........I, too, don't understand how a gifted historian who successfully lives her own life can fall so irrevocably in love so soon.  And not only in love, but fierce, overwhelming, it's my only reason for living love.  To a vampire, no less. The vampire feeding segments are creepy, if necessary for understanding.  I cannot fathom how a seemingly normal \\"warmblood\\" could stand to watch such a thing, let alone love the being who is doing it.<br />I don't believe in vampires, I don't like stories or movies about vampires, I don't think something that is dead and needs the warm blood of other beings to survive should be romanticized.  And still it is an engaging story and I will read the next book when it comes out in July.  The historical references are daunting if you are not a scholar.  So is the geography if you aren't all that familiar with France.<br />But I am irrisistably drawn to witchcraft and that is why I will continue to read this story.  It will be interesting to see who the powerful witch is who will teach Diana what she needs to know.  I find it passingly convenient that no matter what impossibility the occassion requires, Diana finds she can do it.  But that is what storytelling is all about, I guess.<br />This book turned out to be far more than I expected it to be, but that turned out to be not a bad thing.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This game is great!! Its fun ,exciting, and at some points tricky! My only problem with it is that it is wayyyyy to easy! I beat in and got every achievement with in 3 hours of buying it! The first cut the rope is too easy also but it has WAYYY more levels! This game is still great and I reccomend it!! ENJOY!!!
B0052KJ5TK|5.0|The deluxe version, Brad Arnold and the band at its best. These southern boys are one of my fav bands. All of their music is great but this CD seems a bit more polished. \\"Time of My Life\\" is a great start with \\"Round and Round, \\"Race for the Sun\\" \\"Every Time You Go\\" (both versions), \\"On the Run\\", \\"She Is Love\\", \\"Believer\\" and \\"Silence Remains\\" being my personal fav's with the rest close behind. There are a few acoustic repeats near the end and \\"Train\\" the last track is not new as it's appeared on a previous CD. As far as I can tell both versions of \\"Train\\" sound the same. All definitely worth a listen and IMO a keeper.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Since I have got this game I have loved it!! I don't have any bugs on it its GREAT!! My only problem is its WAYYY to easy I got every achievement in a day same thing with cut the rope experiments. Other than that its loads of fun I definetly reccomend it.
0545265355|5.0|My children enjoyed reading these books.  They finished each book in about a week.  Quick read...entertaining!  Ordered from Amazon at a great price.  Saw the 1st movie today & it was great
B004SBS8LA|3.0|This game looks so much funner than it actually is. Ya we all love angry birds but this sequel disappointed me. They could have hit a home run with this but in my eyes its a triple. If your a BIG angry birds fan BUY IT but if not u can probably live without.The free version is pretty much the same anyways. ENJOY!!!!
B004ZH66XO|5.0|This game is awesome, you should try it! Start out as a little fish and get bigger by eating other, smaller fish.
B005HSL626|5.0|If u have this app then there really is no need to get the laud version. The only real difference is the laud version has multiplayer. This us a great app though so I HIGHLY reccomend it. If u don't like it then remove it was free! ENJOY!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I tried to review these books separately, as the author requested, however, realized early on that it was impossible after purchasing the omnibus edition for my Kindle, as I did not know where one book ended and the next began. Some of the best written books I have had the pleasure of devouring in a long time.  I can only say that I am glad the books are finished as I have finally caught up on my sleep.  This page turner is literally a must finish once you have started reading.  Descriptive in its simplicity this character driven story had me transported to the world and feeling emotionally withdrawn when not allowing the participants to finish their tasks at hand when I stopped reading.  Very disappointed at the end, only because there was not more to read.  Cannot wait until the next one comes out.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I loveeee angry birds and even though this app can get a little boring ohhh welll its a classic and the original!! But I do recommend the free version! But if u wanna buy an app get angry birds space!!!!! Take off on a galactic adventure. Whatever u decide ENJOY!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is the most wonderful book ever!!!! But Suzanne Collins needs to make a history book to go along with it to make it more understanding.
B004SBX112|4.0|This game is another great idea by Rovio!!! This app is fun and exciting it just needs a little more ummph if u know what I mean. With the updates there's levels everywhere so that wont be a problem it can just get a little boring. I would get the free version or if your looking to buy something get angry birds space a great galactic adventure . I recommend this app!! ENJOY!!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app!!!! I feel like I have awesome tools at my fingertips for digging deeper into God's word! a lot of versions are downloadable for studying and reading when not online!!! highlighting with notes attached as well. awesome app!<br /><br />I just wish that my notes where available offline as well. Thus the four stars
B0034G4P4O|4.0|This is from a chicks point of view. I think this movie was about what I expected. It is fast-paced, action-packed and has excellent animation/computer work whatever they used. The people in this movie look real. It is one of those movies you could watch again. It goes so fast you miss stuff. There is humor in it, adults will find funny as well. I did not hear any curse words, but there was shootings and stuff. Also the captain is basically a drunk. So if you have a really young one I would not get for them. My fav. character was the captain. he is a trip. I would recommend this movie. it is definitely worth seeing! I think the story/plot is good. I am interested in seeing what they do with this, as I was watching it I was thinking \\"potential for sequel\\" and that is how they end it as well, open for more. I look forward to that one as well.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I've long been a King fan and his books have never failed to entertain me.  I know when I pick one up to read, I'm headed to bookworld for a couple of days.  I don't usually like \\"time travel\\" themes, because there are too many holes, but King solved that problem by having the characters answer those issues right up front by saying \\"I don't know\\".<br /><br />Like King, I remember that day.  Our sixth period teacher said, \\"Did anybody in here hear anything about Jack Kennedy being shot?\\"<br /><br />Having never before heard him referred to that way, I didn't know who he was talking about, and apparently my classmates didn't either, because no one responded.<br />Our seventh period teacher solumnly shared the announcement referring to him as President John Kennedy. You could have heard a pin drop.<br /><br />The book was a great page turner (or tab clicker on Kindle) that had a great beginning, middle, and end. It was more than a thriller.  It was a very thought provoking history lesson that came to life in the hearts and minds of the characters we grew to love. It also illustrated the possibilities of consequenses of our actions.
B0064NTZJO|2.0|First, the movie.<br />It's not what I had hoped. I heard about it from a Brian Cranston interview. It stars Gosling, Cranston, Christina Hendricks (love her), and Albert Brooks (a great actor, writer and director). Cranston speaks frequently about how he chooses great roles based on great scripts. His judgement wasn't so great here. Contrary to some other negative reviews, I wasn't hoping for a movie with nothing more than car chases and gangsters. I was hoping for a smart well-written thriller. It is none of these. It is a slow-paced bad story for the first 45 min. Gosling is either a very bad actor or he was directed to be bad. His role is basically to give flirtatious grins to girls and the bad guys. The bad 80s-style music makes it worse. After the boring initial 45 minutes passes, it is filled with ultra-violent gory scenes, which still manage to be painfully dull. Lots of violent murders. Stomping of heads. Shotgun blows to the head. Bloody stabbings. They even manage to make Christina Hendricks appear unattractive. You will do yourself a huge favor if you skip this movie completely. Don't rent it. Don't buy it. Skip it.<br /><br />Now, to make things worse, Sony seems to have invented the worst possible digital movie service possible with \\"Ultraviolet.\\"<br /><br />Of late, I only buy Blu Ray when a digital copy is included. I own a connected Sony Blu Ray player and an Apple TV to stream movies to my television. I want the option of streaming movies rather than using the physical disc. I know I am not alone because many Blu Ray discs include a digital copy. This is the first (and last) title I'll buy with Sony's \\"ultraviolet\\" digital copy.<br /><br />The experience of obtaining and using the digital copy with this disc is horrible.<br /><br />Here are the steps (no exaggeration, it's a truly awful experience):<br />-Enter the unnecessarily-long code at a long manually-entered url<br />-Next, you log into the service. Your previous Sony service logins don't work. Even though Sony has probably tortured you by making you sign up for useless services in the past, they make you reenter your info again to get access to your digital copy. They actually make you sign up for two new logins to use this service: once for Sonypictures.com and again for \\"Ultraviolet.\\" After signing up for the two Sony services, you merge the two new accounts.<br />-Sign up to sonypictures.com service (name, birthdate, email, password, pick two security questions - system has a bug that causes the page to randomly refresh and forces you to restart the process)<br />-Sign up to sony's ultraviolet service (same info as above, all over again for a separate account)<br />-open your email to verify the two accounts with an email link<br />-link the two accounts<br />-go back to the original link and reenter the movie redemption code<br /><br />OK, I jumped through the hoops. Now I can watch my movie! Maybe not.<br /><br />The problem is, the only way to watch the digital copy is using your web browser on your computer. There is no Roku access. There is no way to watch it with a connected Sony Blu Ray player (I own Sony's latest connected Blu Ray player). There is no iPhone app. There is no iPad app. There is no way to watch it with Apple TV. There may be an app for Playstation 2, but I doubt it considering that the connected Sony Blu Ray player doesn't have one.<br /><br />Sony's Ultraviolet service, and thus the digital copy included with this disc, is useless. Don't buy this if you expect to own a digital copy. If I want a digital copy that I can use with one of the many digital devices connected to my television, I must download a pirated copy or go through the hours-long process of \\"ripping\\" the blu ray with Handbrake or similar software. Alternately, I can download it from iTunes for $20. No thank you Sony. Perhaps I'll just download pirated Sony films from now on.
B002R1SS86|5.0|One of the best versions of Robbin hood ever it is more believable to follow history than many of the versions out their and is very enjoyable to watch
B006VA57CY|5.0|OMG...its was amazing.  If you watch the first episode, and like it...you will LOVE the entire series.  I tried to limit myself and only watch one every couple of days.  What a joke, sometimes I would watch two and three in a row after everyone was asleep so I could fully enjoy. Downton Abbey is full of scandal between the upstairs and downstairs inhabitants.  The story never dulls.  Can't wait for season three.  Absolutely love Maggie Smith!
B0051MKMNC|1.0|The previews cannot be fast forwarded, skipped, proceed to top or main menu so if you stop the movie you have to sit through 9 minutes of previews before you get to the menu.  This is a deal breaker.  Let the Blu Ray MFGs (not it's not dirty but manufacturers) know this is not acceptable.  A dead horse head in their bed should do.
B007BDK3SS|2.0|I downloaded this app 2 days ago &amp; I'm allready on level 21.  If u like easy games this is the game 4 u.
B004UID2LC|4.0|At first it worked great. I downloaded ten videos, enjoyed them. Now it won't download anymore, and I can't even get my Kindle Fire to play a video on the website! The only things I can watch from youtube on it are the ones I downloaded. Fix please!<br /><br />Edit: I was stupid. I finally figured out how to get Adobe Flash to work and that made this app work. Still two complaints: one, it force closes a lot, and two: whenever I download a video, it also puts several pictures from the video in my gallery. Kind of annoying. Other than that, it is good!
0307891372|5.0|For those of you who bought the game \\"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim\\" but did not buy this book, well, you do not know what you are missing! In such a grand game, this book is a must to experience all the aspects of the game! The book fully illustrates the huge amount of work the developers have done, and it reflects in the amount of work put into the book! The book is not a true gameguide, but rather a reference guide with a very fine index where you can find everything you encounter in the game. The book is fully illustrated, contains numerous tabels, charts, maps, puzzle solutions, etc. that helps you getting the most out of the game! With the index you can find any place, item, person, quest you encounter exploring the Skyrim Universe.<br /><br />If you are looking for a walkthrough (if there is such a thing in this game), this is probably not the book for that. Rather it explains things, gives a better understanding of the game that makes you enjoy the game you otherwise wouldn´t have. However, as all quests are listed and described in detail, the gamer that wants to follow \\"a red line\\" in the game can use the book as a walkthrough, as opposed to the gamer who just want to travel all over the Skyrim Universe and experience what he meets on his way. The latter will find the book perfect.<br /><br />I have never seen a game guide that enhances a game so much as this guide does!<br /><br />The book is worth every penny! I would have given it 6 stars!
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|I have to be honest when I say that I don't understand how killing children/teenagers can be considered entertainment? If this was happening in real life, it would be a tragic crime!  I don't care if it is all fabricated....it is sad that this is considered entertainment.

B006Y5BWQG|5.0|This was my first video on my Kindle Fire and I was impressed with the quality of the screen and video.  I also became a HUGe hit of SMASH!!!  I was telling all of my friends to be ready for the first night.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|As a Book Collector, this is absolutely perfect for me and my Kindle Fire. I have a cheaper cover I use when out running around, although I'm sure this one will hold up, but I don't want to take the chance of ruining this absolutely gorgeous cover. Holds the Kindle in securely and closes without problem. It's a bit pricey, but worth it for the aesthetic value. It feels like leather with suede on the inside. Additionally, there is a little pocket to keep receipts or a small notepad. The design and stitching are gorgeous and I have no problem at all with the fit, no problem with the speakers. Love it.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|does anyone know why it doesn't work on the kindle fire. you cant install it.will someone please help me with that. my email is niclangley97@gmail.com. thanks
B002VECM6S|5.0|I'm not sure why the trailers to this movie did not appeal to me, but once I'd watched about ten minutes of it, I was hooked. Sandra Bullock is absolutely stunning in this movie. Knowing this was a true story made it even more wonderful to watch. It is inspirational and a joy to experience what this family went through and how they opened their hearts and homes to this young man. What a courageous tale of what can happen when children are given a good chance in life.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|Ayn Rand wrote the screenplay for this 1949 adaptation of her 1943 novel, [[ASIN:0452273331 The Fountainhead]], but was reportedly not too happy with the finished product.  As for me, I found absolutely nothing wrong with the movie: the legendary Gary Cooper does a magnificent job as architect Howard Rourke.  Rourke's courtroom speech, where he defends the right to act in his own self-interest, is especially powerful. Broadway actress Patricia Neal (in her film debut) also shines as socialite Dominique Francon, who meets and falls in love with Rourke, who spurns her.  Veteran character actor Raymond Massey (TV's DR. KILDARE) plays newspaper publisher Gail Wynand, who eventually gets Francon to marry him, even though she is still in love with Rourke. After Wynand is killed near the end of the film, Francon finally marries Rourke.<br /><br />Though I enjoyed last year's [[ASIN:B005N4DP1E Atlas Shrugged: Part One]], this movie is far superior.  ATLAS SHRUGGED PART 2 is good (I saw it in the theater on October 13), but this movie is still better.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Its super easy and fun to play! It kinda relaxing too, I also love th different shapes. I suggest everyone download oit.
B007M6P01O|4.0|FROM RIGHT AFTER 18 MILES OUT: Sure, there are some zombies and gore, and some drama, but the drama should flesh out the action, not the other way around. See Rick running on the image of this Season? Run, Rick, Run! That's what should have happened from episode 2 or 3 . . . RUN AWAY!!! Rig up some \\"Trollhunter\\" quality vehicles, make like a baby, and head out!<br /><br />UPDATE AFTER FINAL EPISODE OF THIS SEASON: Okay, they've nearly redeemed themselves. A couple details I overheard at work lead me to finish the season, and turns out it ain't quite so bad. But if they end up staying put only one hour away from the farm for the entirety of Season 3, I'll have to take away a star. Just sayin's, all. They still need some Trollhunter trucks, though.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|Did not help me get my Google Sports Calendar on my phone, but offered a much greater selection of widgets which was worth the seven bucks. quick note: Smooth Calendar is free but all of those widgets go across the screen. Calengoo has a widget that takes up the space of 2x2(2 apps by 2 apps) all of smooth calendar are 4 across. If you are using agenda that can make the type very small depending on how many items you set it to (3-6). Calengoo allows same amount of lines with bigger type.(Also tech support is great!) Comes down to personal preference.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|... liked the concept of this book. I waited tho untill the movie came out.<br />Took my mom to see it we both liked the movie. Went on a great vacation,spare time read most of the book..got home finished the book. The book explained a lot more.<br /> Bought the movie from amazon.<br />Now have the book and movie. My first time to ever write a review.<br />  Hope it's good enough.<br /> Janet
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The description is true to the product.  I love it and it is so lightweight and thin.  Great price too.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I beat all of the initial 125 levels in a few hours. I think the new tools are more interesting than most of the original ones, but it wasn't very challenging after beating all of the levels in the previous game. One benefit is that while it may be hard to acquire all three stars, just getting past the level is generally easy so you won't get stuck on a level. The entertainment value makes it worth getting, but hopefully the coming levels are more challenging.
1451627289|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It combines a thriller with a really good sense of history. I thought it was really interesting to think through the issues involved with time travel. What would happen if you could change the past?  It also had a lot of apparently accurate info about the JFK assassination, so it was a good historical read as well.
B0073PZIYI|5.0|Great, fantastic, awesome movie. I watched it three times. It was very sad at the ...  when his... but I think the entire concept was on point!

B005TKC2P2|5.0|Having just read 1?84 (1-2-3) by Haruki Murakami, I first of all recognised a similarity in the story's construction, such as coincidental occurrances and magic events in a possibly parallel universe. It is a 'must read','hard to put down' book, leaving you with a sense of melancholy, looking for the next book by the author.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I don't know why others can't load this on their Fire. It loaded quickly on mine. Haven't played yet, but first impression is that it will be lots of fun.
B002UHTTWQ|3.0|I didn't realise it was going to be such a long story ( Hard to tell the size on Kindle), but I did enjoy it once I got involved in Emma's life. I found the beginning of the story about Emma's adult life really got me in and when it switched to her early life I was annoyed because I wanted to know more. But I thought I'll read on because it will come back to where it left off. Little did I know it would be the whole book before I found out the rest.<br />I have only read one other of Barbara's books - Letter from a Stranger.  She is an excellent writer and certainly makes you part of the characters lives.  I will be checking out some more of her books.
B0031RG846|5.0|What a delightful little unicorn.  I was so pleased with the size of this little Foal. The detailing and quality are excellent. It is perfect for my 4 year old granddaughter's imaginary play time.  It arrived overnight even though I didn't request fast shipping!  It gets 5 stars from Grammy!

0307949508|5.0|Lisbeth Salander is on a well-earned holiday and when she gets back, she decides to set herself up with a new apartment and a renewed connection with Miriam Wu. She also checks up on her old employer Dragan Armansky and ex-more-than-a-friend Mikael Blomkvist. Through Blomkvist's computer, she finds out that he is working with someone trying to expose the sex-trafficking - and up pops a familiar name - Zala. Now three people are dead and Lisbeth's the prime suspect...<br /><br />This is a great book! A powerful, tightly wound, and pulse-pounding adventure. I found it so hard to put this book down and the action is not-stop. Here is where you found out more about Lisbeth than you thought you already knew...I can't recommend this book enough!! The characters are great and this story sticks with you long after closing the book.<br /><br />The Millennium Trilogy: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (1), The Girl Who Played with Fire (2), The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest (3)
B005LAIH9A|5.0|Just got back from a sneak preview of this and I LOVED it.<br /><br />If you liked American Pie and it's first sequels (and their raunch level), you will really enjoy this great return from the original cast.<br /><br />The Class of 1999 gets together for their 13th year reunion (really? 13th? well, that's not going to spoil the rest of the movie) and we get to catch up with what life after high school is like for everyone.  For the most part, everyone's personalities are the same, and the writers and actors did a great job of projecting those characters into adulthood.  Although projecting an older Stifler still doesn't seem like \\"adulthood...\\"<br /><br />I don't want to give away any of the jokes, but this was a really funny movie.... funnier than I expected, to be honest.  And not only will the audience be consistently laughing out loud, but viewers will also feel an unexpected nostalgia in watching.<br /><br />As I said, I did expect it to be funny, but this movie is MUCH better than I expected.<br /><br />As with other crude comedies, this will probably play slightly better in the theaters, because of audience reactions, but this is a wonderful return from the cast, and is very well written and directed.<br /><br />Go see this movie!
0316077046|5.0|Lena and Ethan have lived through the day that they had been dreading for months, but have had to make some sacrifices. Since Macon's death, Lena has been depressed and lost, and there doesn't seem to be anything that Ethan can do to help her and he feels like he's losing her. Lena begins pulling away and taking risks, changing. Meanwhile, Ethan starts having visions again - but this time Lena doesn't share them. In order to figure out what is going on, he digs deeper into Caster lore and his mother's research to look for a way to save Lena and what they have before it's too late.<br /><br />I really enjoy Ethan and Lena together and I hope their relationship will stand the test of time - no matter what happens. A lot of questions get answered in this book - even questions you didn't think you had. Everything starts to come together and the events in the past have woven a very intricate web to lead into the present. This book has the right amount of revelations to keep you engaged, but it leaves plenty of mystery as well. If you thought the stakes were high in the first book, this one steps it up that much further. This book will definitely grip you every bit as hard as the first one.<br /><br />Caster Chronicles series: Beautiful Creatures (1), Beautiful Darkness (2), Dream Dark (2.5), Beautiful Chaos (3), Beautiful Redemption (4)
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I love it!!!  challenging and definetely not a copy of the others. people complaining about having to pay for it want EVERYTHING for free!!  how do you think these game developers get paid???  its worth the 2.99 for sure!

0071752854|5.0|If you are in sales for a living, or just want to know how to be better at influence and persuasion, pitch anything is a worthwhile book to read. The author not only writes about how to do this, but he actually does it for a living. Oren teaches you about frames and how to use them to control the conversation and gain upper hand. Some things in the book we might intuitively know, for example not appearing needy when pitching anything. However the author gives examples as well as frames to use as to not appear needy - such as prize frame, time frame etc. to overcome the analyst frame and power frame.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is an excellent book, quick read, and worth reading.
B006X96PF6|5.0|I will make this brief.  I love this new CD.  The performances are amazing, and Ms. McKennitt sounds marvelous.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case is sleek and fits the Kindle Fire without all the extra bulk of most other covers. The elastic band does a great job of keeping the cover closed even in my big purse. It is easy to keep clean and has a nice feel in your hand (it does not cut into your fingers like some other cases do).

0545259088|3.0|While I really enjoyed this series overall, I am extremely disappointed by the ending. I used to like Sam and Grace's relationship, but once Cole came in (I LOVE COLE) I was mostly only interested in his and Isabel's relationship, which is weird considering the main characters weren't them...I LOVE COLE AND ISABEL and I want them to have their own series... I just want to see a love story of their own! I mean, they never really got together in the whole series so now I think is the time :) We basically just read about what they thought about each other (how they couldn't stop thinking about each other, etc.). I want to read about what they DO! They were so much fun to read. Highly entertaining, never lost interest. That was the only time I truly laughed out loud. I just want to see a love story of their own! Sam and Grace were just so perfect. I love Cole and Isabel because they could only find happiness torturing each other. I want more of them.<br /><br />In the end, it seemed like the author ran out of material which I don't understand. As a reader and a fan, I could have written a better finale. The ending overall was such an open book. I want/need to know where these characters end up. That ending was perfect for a follow up book, not an ending to a series. Such a disappointment. Did Sam and Grace ever get married? Did they eventually turn human forever? Did Cole and Isabel fall in love? Did Isabel return or did Cole go find her? So many questions. As a fan, I feel we deserve it. I feel completely letdown. PLEASE GIVE US A FOLLOW UP SERIES ABOUT COLE. Just finished reading Vampire Academy and I'm SO glad the author did a spin-off of another character.
0143116738|5.0|Ken Robinson is brilliant!  If you haven't checked out his TED talks, do so before deciding to buy this book.  This small volume goes into greater detail about his passion for the teaching of creativity and how our schools could choose to go about educating kids for the time into which they're being born.  How do you prepare a 8 or 10 or 15 year old kid for a job that won't even be created for another couple decades?  Teach them to be creative!<br /><br />This is not a difficult read, but beautifully lays out how this could look.  The more schools choose to view the world like Robinson, the more relevant education will become for the next generation.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This novel is a great way to introduce kinds to the idea of independent and critical thought rather than blindly following authority.
B004X4QW42|2.0|Im not going to pretend that I am a martial arts expert nor am I even a big fan of martial art films. But I think it is fair to say that the western boxing Vs eastern boxing story was absolutely absurd.<br /><br />Ive watched enough boxing while channel surfing to know that a boxer would not have the speed or agility to block flurries of Wing Chun strikes like the way we see in this movie. A boxer has the capacity to put his guard up and at most absorb a range of swings and jabs. He would Duck and weave and possibly use good footwork. But in the ring this boxing champion develops some sort of pseudo kungfu-boxing style that is completely implausible. He doesn't even look like he is boxing.<br /><br />I dont know who to blame, the choreographer (who I have alot of respect for... absolutely loved 'Project A') or the screenwriter for coming up with this ridiculous premise in the first place.<br /><br />I mean, how on earth do these masters go about fighting on a turn-table like manga characters and then only to enocounter a final battle scene where they struggle to dodge and weave a big swinging baffoon boxer. It would have been more plausible to see a Van Damme type kickboxing character with superior strength rather than a boxer.<br /><br />Having said that, just then I wondered what would have happen if someone like Mike Tyson got in the ring... which makes me wonder maybe this could have been successful if the choreographer actually respected the sport of boxing. It could have been quite interesting to see two totally different and unaware styles of fighters come head to head.<br /><br />And really what else is left to really admire about IP man 2. The plotline is similar to the original film. Locals get into fist fights and duels until a foreign entity comes along and threatens the Chinese way of being. It doesnt help when the foreign entity is just pure one dimensional evil.<br /><br />But then it departs from the original in the worst way. Whilst it was refreshing to see IP man destroy the Japanese General in the first film without raising a sweat, the sequel descends into rocky\Bloodsports\Kickboxer\every-other-fighting-movie madness. A done to death fighting sequence we have seen since fighting movies were conceived. The protagonist makes a friend who gets killed in the ring, he then challenges the bad guy to a subsequent fight. He get his crap beaten out of him but gets back up to win in the end. Yay! Cue the lame speech. Cue the curtains. Good night London!

0375869026|5.0|Imagine being born with facial deformities.  Not only are you forced to have multiple surgeries, but people stare at you, are frightened by your face and whisper about you behind your back.  August is a very special looking child but inside his is just an everyday ordinary kid.  When his parents decide that he would go from home school to a regular school, August is scared and apprehensive.  This is a story of courage, acceptance and kindness.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book and its message. The book begins with Augusts' point of view and then switches to various people in his life.  My only criticism is that at times the author repeated events from multiple points of view, which became a little tedious.  I think this book is very appropriate and valuable for middle and high school students.

1935251740|5.0|First off, let us consider that Dr. Robert Lanza is one of the most well respected and well known scientists in the world, and yet seems to be able to simplify this elegant theory into something we can all understand.. And even more, something we can not avoid. He offers a perspective very different from what we've all been taught and challenges us to step outside of the box and dismiss conventional wisdom in order to fully comprehend his central thesis.. That life creates the universe, not the other way around. He insists that Physics will keep falling flat on its head when searching for a unifying theory unless they incorporate consciousness into the equation. Sound far fetched?? Not when he brakes down the basics of his theory with a style and flare that I wish my High School science teacher had. He never fails to be informative while entertaining all at once. Sure to be regarded as a classic, and even more impressive that for once we get an honest explaination of the universe and our role in it.. From the mind of a Biologist, not a Physicist!!

B006SMLAMQ|2.0|unless you prefer military time don't bother with this app. I even wasted money on the paid app in hopes I would be able to change to just regular time. I emailed the makers of this app with no response. this has potential of 5 star ratings IF the would do an update to give a choice between military and reg time. but their lack of response only shows lack of interest. try weather HD.  fantastic weather app. free too..

But looking at the design, I do not believe it would hold a phone all that great, there is one tiny spring inside the plastic housing (which fairly quickly if you overextend it)  I haven't found a better alternative yet, but save your money.

B006Z7Z3S6|4.0|It seems like every few years there is a new \\"hot\\" horror director who everybody thinks has found the magic formula, bringing the same level of thrills as the classics but doing it in a fresh new way. Most of these filmmakers fade away into straight-to-DVD land or into making survival horror video games. It's a hard genre to crack, but occasionally one director appears and proves he's truly worth keeping a close watch on. Although he's been around for years, Ti West's biggest break came with 2009's creepily retro The House of the Devil, which was so good a number of critics had it in their top 10 of the year. When was the last time that happened? His follow-up, The Innkeepers, is similar in that it's a twist on a familiar theme, that of the \\"haunted hotel\\". Even more, it shows that West isn't content to indulge in the gruesome, or fall back on lame jump cuts for cheap scares. Instead he relies on good old fashioned tension building and humor to make for a moody, effective thriller.<br /><br />The Yankee Pedlar has seen better days. The old hotel is creaking to it's final weekend before being turned into a parking lot. The place is basically abandoned, with even the owner not caring enough to stick around. Even his choice in who will manage the place to it's inevitable fate shows how little concern there is for the old, supposedly haunted building. Claire(Sara Paxton), a perky, asthmatic cherub with a runaway imagination; and Luke(Pat Healy), a smart mouthed wannabe ghost hunter struggle to even keep towels handy for the few remaining guests.  One of those is Leanne Rease-Jones(an unrecognizable Kelly McGillis) a former actress turned psychic/soothsayer, who puffs her cigarette and fingers her power crystal between disapproving glares at Claire.<br /><br />West structures his film in three short chapters, and those who are used to a constant barrage of loud \\"booms\\" and crashing piano keys might want to go home and watch their copy of The Grudge. The West has the feel of an old TV horror anthology, or an episode of The Twilight Zone. It relies mainly on atmosphere, and giving us a peek inside the minds of the characters we'll be terrified for later. In this case, boredom and idleness have taken over Claire and Luke's brains, with the emptiness of the building not helping the situation. Luke has put together an upstart website focusing on the paranormal, and Claire has become obsessed with the story of a woman who was left for dead in the basement and continues to haunt the hotel. While a little meandering, these first two chapters never fail to be attention grabbing, with West's script keeping the tone light,  the casual banter between Paxton and Healy often hilarious and even a little flirty. Well, as flirty as it gets for two such social outcasts. He clearly has a thing for her, but she's way too spacey to notice or care.<br /><br />There's a very thin line between comedy and terror when it comes to genre flicks like this, and West walks that tightrope with ease. His use of humor might seem out of place, especially for such an extended period of time, but by the time the final chapter rolls around you realize it was all done for a purpose. Your defenses lowered and all too relaxed, the genuine scares of the final chapter hit you like a sucker punch to the gut. West sets us up perfectly, with some fantastic camerawork, from long tracking hallway shots to some brilliant use of angles to keep us totally in the dark. Even when the film appears to be drifting along, there's a foreboding air just beneath the surface. When Luke starts warning Claire about the dangers of chasing ghosts, that she'll start to become paranoid, we know it won't be long before that very thing happens. But what fun it is to watch as it does!<br /><br />The best horror filmmakers are masters at playing all of the audiences emotions to maximum effect, and after only a handful of films, Ti West has proven himself to be one who can.of an old TV horror anthology, or an episode of The Twilight Zone.

B005LAIGPA|4.0|What? The first truly great film of 2012 is a superhero movie? And the words \\"Dark Knight\\" and \\"Avengers\\" are nowhere to be found? Both of those surefire blockbusters will have a hard time measuring up to the energy and realism of Chronicle, a film that shows having superpowers is about more than vague slogans like \\"with great power comes great responsibility\\", it's a heavy burden and one not everybody is prepared to handle.<br /><br />Over the last few years as comic book movies have all but overtaken Hollywood with brightly suited heroes in silly masks, only on occasion do we get one that dares to take a different approach. Movies like Kick-Ass and Super spring to mind, but those are really just deconstructions that don't take comic books seriously at all. Surprisingly, M. Night Shyamalan had the right idea a few years ago in what was quietly his best film, Unbreakable, a convincing and authentic look at the origins of a superhero and the man who would come to be his nemesis.  With Chronicle, newcomer Joshua Trank has tapped into that same idea, only with a healthy dose of teenage hormones and emotional volatility.<br /><br />For once, the annoying \\"found footage\\" sub-genre is put to solid use as Andrew(Dane Dehaan), a bullied social outcast begins documenting every moment of his life. He does it at first to capture the physical abuses by his father, but it isn't long before we see that there's no real escape for Andrew anywhere. He's treated just as badly at school, with his only friend being his popular cousin, Matt(Alex Russell). Andrew's barely contained anger and depression is only made worse by the worsening condition of his mother, slowly dying at home and the family unable to pay for the medications she needs.<br /><br />Trying to break Andrew out of his funk, Matt takes him to a party, where he's introduced to the most popular guy in school, Steve(Michael B. Jordan). Tell him that he and Matt have founded something really cool out in the woods, Andrew reluctantly follows them into a cavernous sinkhole, where they discover a strange glowing object. Rather than doing the smart thing and running for the hills, they touch it, forcing it to emit a piercing shriek, knocking the boys unconscious.<br /><br />Trank doesn't show us the immediate effects, instead skipping ahead in time, when the three have gained some knowledge of their mysteriously granted powers. In the beginning, these powers unite them as best friends, testing out their newfound abilities in silly exercises that could only spring from the mind of teenage boys, like creating a gust of wind to lift up cheerleaders' skirts. It isn't long before they start to figure out that their powers are growing exponentially the more they're used, almost like a muscle, and after Andrew goes a bit too far it's time to start setting some ground rules.<br /><br />But if there's one thing angry youths don't like, it's a bunch of people telling them what to do. Especially when you've been held back for as long as Andrew has. Seeing his powers as not only a means of exacting vengeance against those who wronged him, but also as something of a birthright considering the turmoil he's lived through. Exploiting it just enough, he's happy with the limited amount of school-wide celebrity it affords him, but it's nothing like the real popularity of his two friends. Jealousy quickly gives way to rage, and soon Andrew is on a dangerous, super powered tailspin.<br /><br />With a script co-written by Trank and Max Landis(the son of filmmaker John Landis), Chronicle puts a real world spin on what has always been the most interesting aspect of the superhero/supervillain divide, and that is how they came to be. The theory has always been that it takes a certain level of arrogance to become a hero, and an equal level of anguish to become a bad guy. In Chronicle, just as in most comic books, the one we deem the villain never sees himself as such, and it can be argued there isn't truly one in the film. Watching Andrew, Matt, and Steve develop into who they will ultimately become is consistently fascinating. While all three are perfectly cast, it's DeHaan who makes the biggest impression, and as Andrew his desperation to get out of his pathetic life is the film's driving force.<br /><br />That's not to say it's all good. While Trank makes rational use of the handheld cam, there are some scenes where it's presence doesn't make a whole lot of sense, even for Andrew who seems to be obsessed with recording everything for some future audience. The introduction of a love story between Matt and and video blogger named Ashley goes nowhere, except to make her a potential damsel in distress. She would have been better used as a point of contention between the friends.<br /><br />Still, these are minor complaints in a film that features a number of new faces I can't wait to see in other projects. While the budget isn't huge, Trank makes the most out of what are fairly simple special effects, saving the big stuff for the destructive finale that makes me think what a live-action Akira should look like. It's no wonder he's being looked at to possibly relaunch the Fantastic Four film franchise, as he knows exactly how to capture the wonder that comes with discovering the scope of amazing powers. As the boys put their strength to the test, they eventually learn to fly, and it's like we're right there with them as they savor this wondrous experience.<br /><br />Clocking in at only 80 minutes, Chronicle doesn't get bogged down in deep messages, and yet it still manages to be one of the smartest superhero movies we've seen in a very long time.e film.

B005LAIGP0|3.0|Of all the Harry Potter alumni, Daniel Radcliffe is probably in the most tenuous position now that the blockbuster franchise has ended it's decade long run. He's dabbled in other projects outside of the boy wizard's adventures before, and has generally shown to be a talented and more than capable actor. But he's also most likely to be pigeonholed, with people unable to accept him as anything other than a kid with a magic wand and pet owl. Even so, he's still in a better position than poor Rupert Grint. So what's the best decision Radcliffe can make? To star in another film that has him dealing with big houses and supernatural forces. Probably not the wisest move, and his Harry Potter fans who follow him into the tedious The Woman in Black may start wishing for someone to cast a spell and speed up time.<br /><br />Based on a Susan Collin's dreary but effective novel, the deliberate pacing is one that plays out better on the printed page than on screen. Daniel Radcliffe plays Arthur Kipps, a gloomy lawyer struggling to cope with the death of his wife, who passed tragically years earlier after giving birth to their son. Arthur apparently hasn't smiled since, so much so that his son draws depressing pictures of his Dad(to comical effect). His demeanor is so bleak that Arthur is on the verge of losing his job. Nobody wants a stick in the mud as a colleague. Given one last shot to redeem himself, he's sent to the depressing village of Yorkshire to settle the affairs of a recently deceased woman.<br /><br />Upon arriving, it's pretty clear nobody wants him there, and the reason has to do with the woman's creaky old home, which as you probably suspected is plagued by an evil spirit. Aren't they all? In this case it's of a woman, wronged in life and separated forever from her dead son. As retribution, her malevolence has plagued the entire village's children, and the streets are littered with the ghosts of her victims who stare blankly out of windows and hang around the woods like creepy stalkers. The town itself is little more than a mudpit with a bit of smog surrounding it, but it's like heaven compared to the house itself, which is full of every horror cliche in the book. Creepy marionettes that look extra spooky in the dark, the type no parent would ever buy their child. Every corner is a blind hazard, every step another rickety shriek of worn out wood, and behind every door lies the possibility of a vengeful poltergeist. Shutters flap, people knock on the door at the most fearful moments. Let's just say that Arthur doesn't get a lot of work done.<br /><br />Radcliffe may seem like an odd choice to play a grieving widower, but he proves to be the film's greatest asset. His youthful features appear appropriately hardened by years of overwhelming grief, and you can tell his every action is labored by life's meaninglessness. But when faced with immediate danger, some of the old Harry Potter spirit comes through. In contrast to the rest of the cast, including veteran actor Ciaran Hinds, Radcliffe is the only one who seems to be bringing everything he has to what is a very understated role.<br /><br />It's just unfortunate that so much of the film is completely conventional. Despite director James Watkins' skillful depiction of smog and soot filled Victorian England, the script by the usually reliable Jane Goldman doesn't take us anywhere we haven't been. Atmosphere can only get you so far, and some of the film's old school horror charms wear thin from overuse. How many times are we expected to leap from our seats at a close-up of a toy monkey? Without genuine scares, the glacial pace becomes an even bigger problem. Watching both chapters of Deathly Hallows feels more brisk than this film's plodding 90 minutes.s like creepy stalkers.

B004132HZS|4.0|Sherlock Holmes - that was the old London, fog and gas lights. And right in the middle of that two gentlemen of mature age dressed in funny hats and greatcoats, who - at a leisurely pace on foot or by cab - solved crimes that were, for our modern tastes, pretty antiquated. Well, I quite liked that in my childhood and have even read one or two of the Sherlock Holmes stories. Except for the titles I remember none of them.<br /><br />Then, quite accidentally, in the summer of 2011 I discovered in the German Sunday evening program something named \\"Sherlock\\" and thought \\"why not?\\" giving the 2010 BBC adaption a chance only because I couldn't find anything better. Oh, dear.<br /><br />The title sequence with the London Eye was already really ingenious. London is old, new, timeless, gritty and glitzy. The settings are filmed aesthetically pleasing and combined with a great score that somehow links everything to the Victorian era, yet transposes it seamlessly into the modern. Cuts are fast and the text-on-picture technology original. Everything fits and has thankfully been freed from the dust of ages.<br /><br />Production values, features and styling as well as cinematography and lighting, are as if made for the big screen. These alone would make it worth your while to see the show. Sherlock's coat has earned an episode all to itself. ;-)<br /><br />Of course Arthur Conan Doyle's stories could not be adapted into our modern times just \\"as is\\"- brides withering away of a broken heart because they are forced into an unwanted marriage and ghost dogs with red glowing eyes are just not that credible anymore - instead there are many, many allusions from the original canon cleverly woven into the freshly assembled plots. On the other hand they staid as close to the original as possible.<br /><br />For instance in the first episode \\"A Study in Pink\\" (original: \\"A Study in Scarlett\\"), in which Sherlock Holmes and John Watson meet for the first time. As I reread the original story while I was waiting for the DVD, I found it was just like that! Except for the colour. ;-)<br /><br />Both are looking for someone to share a flat with: John Watson, because he's got only a small military pension, and Sherlock Holmes, apparently because he's spending all his money on taxis. ;-)<br /><br />Among other things, I think this new version is such a great success because Holmes and Dr. Watson are still young men, corresponding with the ACD canon. According to the chronology of Holmes' cases from the annex of \\"The Mammoth Book of New Sherlock Holmes Adventures, he's been born in 1853/54 and solved his first case \\"The Musgrave Ritual\\" in 1877/78 when approximately 23-25 years of age.<br /><br />As in the BBC's canon he's been working with DI Lestrade for about five years, one could then assume that he's in his late twenties at the beginning of the season and John Watson, just returned from war in Afghanistan, a few years older - which in turn meets their ages as given in the books.<br /><br />The fact that both gentlemen are very handsome does no harm at all, naturally. Indeed I think that Benedict Cumberbatch fits ACD's description very well: he is tall, very slender, pale with a distinctive face, gray-eyed and dark haired. The only thing missing is the hawk nose - but I can be generous regarding this detail. ;-)<br /><br />There are entire scientific treatises on Sherlock Holmes' character where psychologists and therapists have tried to diagnose him as if he were a real person. The team Moffat/Gatiss must have read at least a few of those and then decided to portray Holmes as a self-diagnosed high functional sociopath. And it works! Beautifully.<br /><br />Watching how the mentally brilliant, but emotionally five-year-old Sherlock opens and develops under the patient care and praise of John Watson is one of the very special treats of this show.<br /><br />I can't help but admit that I love it when Sherlock in childlike innocence insults everyone around him, because he just cannot grasp that they can't match his intelligence. His question \\"Dear God! What is it like in your funny little brains?\\" is one I've often despaired of myself (even without being a deductive genius).<br /><br />Similarly, Watson's fascination and delight in just watching this completely alien, yet strangely endearing character is impressively performed and fascinating to watch.<br /><br />Great performances by the two main actors and all the supporting cast.<br /><br />Just as with the character of Sherlock Holmes, one has also tried to analyze the relationship of the team Holmes/Watson. Were they \\"just\\" friends or did they have a romantic relationship? And did Conan Doyle create them just so consciously or subconsciously? Opinions are divided. Personally I'm a supporter of the \\"Holmes as an asexual being\\"-theory. He would probably prefer to exist as pure spirit: being an Al would suit him perfectly.<br /><br />The many allusions in this direction, when the pair of them is assumed to be a gay couple, are both running gag and a reference to the still ongoing discussion.<br /><br />Not so great: The plots do not always make a lot of sense. In that they don't defer from the Conan Doyle stories. I can always think of at least one or two other ways to interpret the clues found by Sherlock. Also, sometimes there really is no need for a Holmes - auntie Google would do just as well.<br /><br />I think this problem simply arises from the divergence when an author with a normal IQ writes a character with a much higher IQ. This applies to Conan Doyle as well as to Messrs Moffat/Gatiss. It doesn't work. You just have to lean back and accept Holmes as brilliant as well you accept flying brooms as means of transportation in the Harry Potter universe. Once you have taken this step, you can enjoy the rest undisturbed.<br /><br />This show is at least fifty percent drama, not mystery or thriller, and as such there is more emphasis on character development instead of the circumstances leading to said development.<br /><br />As experienced \\"Dr. Who\\" writers Moffat/Gatiss have to be aware of fandom and I feel sure they have used this as a demographic tool to accurately address the issues/areas that interest (female) fans the most. Sherlock/John is classic bromance. Excellent fan service!

0307593312|4.0|Others have touched on the novel's significant length, so I'll just say that they're right on that point: the novel is very long, and at times I think it could have benefited from an editor's heavier hand.<br /><br />But for all that this novel is an excellent expression of what I love in Murakami. He takes pages and pages and pages to paint a world that is in so many ways our own, but then inescapably not. And in that world he gives us just a few people, each powerfully captured and in his or her own way sympathetic. But if that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, or if you do need a hard-driving, well-explained plot, this is not likely to be the right book for you. But I really enjoyed it.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|I'm surprised no one has actually managed to portray this books correctly. It was actually why I decided to read it.<br /><br />If you expect exploits as in the movies, where he uses his ability and all that, then you'll regret it.<br /><br />It's a good story about a man who realises what morality is and how to live with it, or not live with it.
B000I3P3EM|5.0|I think this may be my favorite ST TOS movie. It has Kirk and the original cast but it was made with modern tech so the effects were not quite so horrible. I like the story quite a bit as well, it seemed to address the things that were going on in our world at the time.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|Right, so either your love it or you hate it.<br /><br />The main characters, Heathcliff and Catherine, are impossible to like. Heatcliffe is vindictive and cruel and Catherine is a weak and cruel character herself. Not only that, they're both selfish and angry narrowminded. It's difficult to not be moved.<br /><br />And being moved is what this story does to you. If you cannot separate yourself from the Characters, and see the book just as a book, you're going to hate it. You WILL hate the characters and wish they would all just burn in methaphorical hell...<br /><br />But if you do manage to just enjoy the story as a story, which is difficult, then it's a thrilling book with many interesting characters, who submit themselves and each other to odd desputes and whatnot due to their odd character traits. Forgiveness is not really a word in this book and most of the story is about the frustrations from their social places.<br />You might even enjoy the... erm... the social... Oh whatever. It's difficult to separate your feelings from what you're reading. And you keep wondering why they're so stupid and cruel.<br /><br />I aged 10 yrs from reading this books.
1423140591|5.0|I love these type of YA books. Each chapter has action, there is a fairly deep plot, and details are not ground to death allowing you to enjoy the book. It is an easy fun read that takes you across America and gives you a good lesson in both Greek and Roman mythology. I liked this book better than the first, because I personally like Percy better. I loved the Percy Jackson books and this was a great expansion upon that universe.

I wrote a grant to our education foundation to purchase these books for our students next year.  To test it out, I shared a couple of chapters with my classes this year.  When surveyed after the reading, there was an overwhelmingly positive response by the students--they were intrigued and wanted to read more.  I look forward to sharing this book, and the inspiring stories it contains, with my students for years to come.

B003Y74KAW|3.0|AmazonBasics Silicone Case for AT&T and Verizon iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S (Red) is an eye appealing cover for your iPhone 4.  It is also lightweight and a comfortable, easy grip fit for the hand.  However, it does not fit snug like other cases I have used.  It tends to slide in the case which can be irritating as well as unsafe for the phone.<br /><br />The price was not an issue for me, as I feel it is an entry-level price for an entry-level quality case.  While it will help to keep your phone clean and protect it from the everyday minor bumps, I do feel it is a very basic case.  If you are hard on your phone - get a hard, more expensive type of case that will protect it better.  This one is quite thin.<br /><br />The holes are all appropriate and do not interfere with the functions of the phone.  All chargers, etc. fit with the case in place.<br /><br />Do I recommend this case? - If you are not hard on your phone and do not do too much gaming on it, it is just fine.  If you are hard on your phone and enjoy gaming with it - I recommend you keep shopping.<br /><br />- 1smileycat :-)
B007MNV5WU|5.0|at first I thought it would be a lot like all the other ones but it is so much better I loved it so much I beat the game in a day played it non stop it is the best app ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0545265355|5.0|These are a MUST read!! I couldn't stop turning the page. I have 2 small children and I was-SOMEHOW-able to read the first book in just 2 days. I finish all 3 in a week. Susanne Collins wording and details are so captivating that I was taken away to Panem and could almost smell the world she created. I loved how well she defined the government of Panem. This is a -could-really-happen- book. With the election this year, I hope people can read this book and find a parallel and see that this could be Americas reality if we don't educate ourselves and fight for freedom and liberty. Her characters are so easy to relate to, that I almost felt we were friends.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Started with the free app, which was ok. Then I had the opportunity to get the paid app. there are so many levels and screens to play. It is an amazing game!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game. . . its annoying to see people complain about accidental spending.  . . u have control over ur own thumbs use it!! I play it on my phone and kindle fire and have yet to make ANY ACCIDENTAL purchases. my rant excludes parents (kids will mindlessly click stuff) but still disable ur card, easy!!
B005CKPQ7A|4.0|Started out a little slow but finished strong. I love the show and have watched all seasons. This on was pretty good.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game rocks its the best game on my kindle fire thanks so much 4 making this app its great I would slice fruit any day hahahaha thanks
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Angry Birds Space brings a whole new dynamic to the Angry Birds series. the gravity affects the gameplay it's great
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I bought this after hearing all the hype about it. I wanted to see for myself what it was all about. I give the author credit for taking the standard romance formula and giving it a new twist. At its simplest, it's a story of a young, innocent girl who falls head over heels for a good-looking, wealthy, talented, \\"bad boy\\" with the heart of gold. Only this guy is in to perpetual kinky sex - which is a large and boring part of the book. The sex is unrealistic and not much of a turn on. And it's the stuff of romance - everyone satisfied all the time, all smelling good, looking good no matter what etc. But there was no real development to the story. After the set up it was a long slog to the \\"end\\" which is really not the end at all, as the author wants you to buy the next two books in the series to continue the tedium. As an aside, the young woman has an annoying habit of giving us her thoughts - as in \\"Holy ...,\\" \\"Oh my,\\" etc. It's the same half dozen phrases over and over and over.  Given that the book is not poorly written in general, this is really a weakness. As is the author's uneven mixture of English and American terms. Bottom line, would I recommend this to a friend? NO. Will I read the others in the series? NO. Was it terrible? NO.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|needs to be fixed before anyone can review the app on any other level. I will say that I was beginning to enjoy it.
B006YXTRHY|4.0|I really like watching the Twilight Saga. Each time I get a new one I watch the previous ones too, back to back, so I can see the story all at once. I read all the books and of course they are much much much better than the movies.<br /><br />Breaking Dawn is good but for me it wasn't one of the most exciting ones.  The acting wasn't as good, especially Alice. I was expecting too much from this movie so I was a bit disappointed. Overall, it was a good movie. Just not as good as the others, in my opinion. The trailer made the movie seem more exciting than it really is.<br /><br />I would have preferred it to be one part. I think it would have been a better movie. Normally I'm exited to see the next one, but after watching Breaking Dawn I haven't even thought about the next one.<br /><br />Not getting my hopes up when the trailer comes out for part 2. No expectations so I can enjoy it more. Hopefully the acting will improve. Who knows, maybe the actors didn't like this part much either and it showed in their performance OR maybe they were not allowed to express themselves fully. All I know is, I noticed a difference in the acting.<br /><br />I'm not putting down the movie, just expressing my own personal thoughts. I'm still a Twilight fan!
0756656230|5.0|There's a Lego book & a minifigure book. My boys love looking at all the sets since the beginning of the Lego's history. It has every imaginable Lego sets that came out. It's a little old, so it doesn't have the newer sets like Ninjago.<br /><br />Minifigure book is fun, too. But, my boys definitely enjoy the Lego book more.
B00466HN6S|2.0|I first saw this movie with grandkids when it first came out, and thought it was a wonderful exciting family movie.  When it came out on DVD, I was disappointed.  I really wanted the Blu-ray disc, but the only way that was sold was with the 150% useless ultraviolet so-called \\"digital\\" copy.  If I can't put it on my iPod, it just another Warner Bros. Waste of time.  I refuse to pay for it.  So I got the regular DVD, and will have to be satisfied with it.  For those of you who don't understand the Ultraviolet \\"digital\\" copy, they give you a serial number that you upload and then they store it in a cloud for you, and it is to their discretion how long it lasts.  So, you are NOT paying for the digital copy, but merely renting it.  To watch it on your android based phone, you must first log on to the internet and then go to your flixster acct to retrieve the movie, if it's still available.  Kinda tough to watch a movie that way at 30,000 feet.
B007BDK3SS|1.0|This game sucks. The controls seem to stop working after a while.  And the bike is way to bouncy.  Dont waste your money.
B002Z58GQS|5.0|This flash drive is good quality for the cost, and it is fast. It comes with some encryption/security software that I didn't use, but its added value. I recommend it.
B007CGLRWA|5.0|I just happened upon this film one sleepless night, it just blew me away. It provoked in me a deep emotional reflection about the human condition in general. The script is a very insightful piece of writing, the direction just amazing. I am a fan of Adrien Brody, what a talent and all the other actors as well, just fantastic on many levels. Especially thought the reference in the beginning to Camus and then Poe toward the end.... poignant.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is one of the most fun games ever. I got the star key and got all the levels. This game is good if you have kids and you are working.
1451648537|5.0|Isaacson is one of those writers that digs in, yet moves on.  He keeps your interest while increasing your expectations about the subject--in this case a world figure, Steve Jobs.
B00377V6J2|4.0|I've owned the Stax title \\"Albert King with Stevie Ray Vaughan - In Session\\" for years, Catalog #SCD-7501.  I've always enjoyed listening to this wonderful jam with the blues and blues rock greats.  When Stax released a version of this title with a bonus DVD of the Session, I was really excited.  Upon watching the DVD, I discovered that some of the lead parts I had attributed to Stevie were actually Albert King!  The DVD offers songs not included on the CD.<br /><br />Why did I deduct a star?  The mastering on the CD is overly compressed... I can understand why Pop music competing for radio play is \\"brickwalled.\\" However, George Horn was mastering engineer for both the original Stax release, and this special edition.  I can only imagine it was at the insistence of an executive at Stax that he fooled with with the mastering job he had done so well a decade prior.<br /><br />So get this title for the DVD, but don't throw out your original issue CD.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|best Bible app ever it has everything you need and want and I really like the part that it can read the scriptures to you!!!!!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read this series after the Steig Larson Millennium series, and while the writing felt a little more like a teenage book, it was a real page turner! I was at first hesitant after loving the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (and other two) so much that I wouldn't find a book I loved as much, but I can say that I enjoyed this series almost equally (though very different)! I saw a review that said if you could put this book down after starting it there is something wrong with you, and I tend to agree. I read the first book in a weekend and was done with the series the following weekend. I am by no means a fast reader, so that gives you an idea of what an easy read it is - but don't let this underestimate the intensity, creativity and thought provoking series she's produced!
B007MNV5WU|1.0|Anyone know why this isn't working on the kindles and if the company is aware of the installation problem some of us are having?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I stayed up late last night reading this book, but couldn't finish cuz i had to get up early for work the next day. All day, I couldn't stop thinking about the Hunger GAmes. I have a few more chapters to go, and i dont want it to end! Tomorrow I'm going to watch the movie, and hopefully it's just as good.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I wanted to view this movie in the privacy of my home and<br />then show it at my church.  Being able to purchase it at a<br />discounted price made it even better.
0553801473|2.0|I could hardly wait for \\"Dance with Dragons\\"  and then it left me feeling betrayed and disappointed . I have great respect for the preceding books and feel Mr. Martin could have finished up much better.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This book was even better than the first which second novels have a hard time doing.  The story continues to be told from Ethan's point of view which in all honesty is one of my favorite things about the book.  There is something so very honest and raw about Ethan.<br /><br />The stories begins within days of where it left off. Lena is suffering more than ever from the loss of Macon. Lena and Ethan's relationship continues to be complicated in a way that is truly authentic. There were so many times I cringed, felt embarrassed or hurt because I felt for the characters and connected to the situation. The relationships are another reason I love this series.  They dynamics between Ethan and Lena are so true I think most teenagers and adults will see a part of themselves in one of the two main characters (minus the whole caster thing of course). Link is also fabulous! He and Ethan have a true friendship.  The bond between them is so pure. Link clearly has Ethan's back no matter what happens and there are some serious things that happen!<br /><br />In case you couldn't tell I love this book. Kami and Margie have created world that not only pulls you in but makes you feel at home. As you read you feel the Southern atmosphere welcoming you in.  I have to say as a teacher this is definitely a book I give to my students especially those who aren't the biggest fans of reading. The students identify with the characters and the story has plenty of twists and turns to hold their interest for over 500 hundred pages.
B004I8WD6E|3.0|Seems like a sturdy enough case and will offer good drop protection, but the pattern on the back was too much for me (I did see it in the product description, it's just more pronounced in person.).  Fortunately my daughter likes it, so she'll use it when the phone becomes hers in a few months.  The case adds quite a bit of depth to the phone, a little more so than the bumper that's on it now.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|While I eagerly purchased this Kindle 4 Book Bundle I was dismayed when I got to book two and the page numbers stopped at 682 (where the first book ended). Also the % complete shows for the total 4 books so I really have no idea how far I am into the second book. I really wish the publishers would fix this.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|the 3 game choices are good and challenging. It is exactly what I was looking for in a game I can play anywhere.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This was a very easy read, as expected for a group of novels written for young adults.  At the same time, they were well written and intriguing.  Taking them for what they are(young adult books), I think the message was fairly universal, the themes coherent across the series and while not a brainbuster def not mind numbing either.  All in all, an interesting and enjoyable series.
159562015X|5.0|As a Catholic Campus Minister, I use this resource in our leadership training for all of our student leaders as well as our professional ministry staff.  Not only does it provide excellent self-knowledge of one's Top 5 themes of talents, it also provides excellent action steps in order to fully develop those talents.  Would highly recommend for anyone for greater self-knowledge of self and for leadership development in students and professional staff.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Coming straight from the Paul Camster series based on the same events,the idea of teens pitched against each other by the old`Book of Sports` scenario gets more of a Sci-Fi twist than it had originally,so it could be a clever departure-so which is best?<br />Paul Camster is slightly ahead in realistic treatment of real events at:<br />[[ASIN:B006F29BFW Apocalypse Third Edition]]<br />[[ASIN:B005BYS1ZG The Messiah Stone]]<br />[[ASIN:B005KRC7HC CRIME&PUNISHMENT]]<br />[[ASIN:B005H7UYYI THE MASTER THERION]]
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|After getting the original Broadway Cast version on CD, my overall impression with Love Never Dies was that it was a good musical but not a great one.  However, after seeing this live through Fathom Events in the United States recently at AMC, this Australian version re-write and change the order of some of the songs is simply amazing!  The staging is beautiful and it is a perfect sequel to Phantom of the Opera.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|angry birds space is the best angry birds yet. It is so much fun, especially because there are gravity fields.
B003VANOFY|4.0|the sound quality is amazing, very comfortable the battery doesnt seem to last the full 10 hours it says.<br /><br />there isnt really surround sound on this. when using them for voice chat with \\"surround\\" turned on its more like an echo.<br /><br />overall a solid purchase. great for people who dont have optical out on their computers.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I'm a big fan of Android, especially stock Android (sorry Kindle, Sense, Motoblur, TouchWiz etc.) but the calendar app is the weak point in the suite of Google apps.<br /><br />Calengoo gives you views that are very close to the Google Calendar views on your browser, but the appointments aren't just colored blobs; each appointment is very readable, even with a week, or even a month on your phone's screen. Also, the developer should get an award for the software design; logical and powerful. With a week view, you can swipe each day's contents up and down for instance. Reminders support pop-up, email and SMS, just like on the Google Calendar browser interface. Double tap on a day in week or month view and the day opens in day view. Long press an appointment in any view to open it or delete it.<br /><br />Calengoo also seamlessly integrates Google tasks, and the design is just as logical and powerful as the calender is.<br /><br />As of today, Calengoo is still on sale at $1.99 instead of the regular $5.99, so grab it now.
B007GE2H3G|3.0|The dog is adorable.  The characters are interesting.  I really can't say a thing wrong with this movie except it should have been only 45 minutes!  I kept falling asleep!  I'm pretty sure it would not hold the interest of a child.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I think its awesome because it includes great performance and is perfect for kindle fire owners<br />I hope u love this game
B005K0HDGE|5.0|An excellent read, King just gets better & better. He has managed to broaden his spectrum without losing any of his flare.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This game way far surpasses the old angry birds. It allows for more use of all the birds and has a very entrapping storyline. Good job on the great new game Rovio
B007IQX1G4|1.0|Terrible movie, like others have said it is slow, boring and dark. What a dissapointment I was expecting more from a movie with Charlize Theron. I rented this from Redbox and I feel like I totally wasted my $1.20. Save your self your time and money and pass on this one.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really like the puzzles,  though have to play a lot of the same ones to get to next level. would like to advance to other levels without having to play the the level before to store the points. other than that, I enjoy the games.
B000025SL5|4.0|If you want to be transported to another epoch, different parallels, and feel like you cannot hold your breath and tears, this journey is your chance to understand whit music is the universal language, spoken this time through a genius like Vangelis.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|freaking brilliant. New gravitational physics puts a much needed twist on the tried and true Angry Birds formula. Planet gravity is very similar to that in the Mario Galaxy games. This adds an extra dimension of strategy to the trajectory based gameplay. Graphics are as fun and colorful as ever. Any fan of the series must play!
0785134352|2.0|Not the worst comic, but not worth reading. The movie does a nice job of telling the same story while making it a little more entertaining and powerful. The comic just has too much violence or sex content for shear shock value, it doesn't advance the story it's just upsetting.<br /><br />The part at the end where the main character gets beat up by the girl's boyfriend at the end of the comic is just too ridiculous. By the end of the book the main guy had survived so many violent situations and fights that there is no way he would have been scared by one high school kid, he was just too tough by that point.<br /><br />Mark Millar has written better stories and John Romita Jr. has drawn better.
B000A0GXGA|5.0|It should be clearly noted that this is a 3 episode, one disc DVD release, featuring two episodes from Season Two and one episode from season Three.  Neither of these three episodes have appeared on DVD before or since. The three episodes included are:<br /><br />Shady Deal At Sunny Acres 11/13/58 (Season 2)<br />Gun Shy 1/11/59 (Season 2)<br />Pappy 9/13/59 (Season 3)<br /><br />The DVD has been out of print for at least three years now. I enjoyed it and wish the studio would start releasing every season of \\"Maverick\\" on DVD.  This is just a compilation of three favorite episodes only.  Not enough to satisfy a hardcore Maverick fan like myself.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really like this app and have not had any problems with it.  the ads are so minimal.  all you have to do is hit &quot;skip &quot;  even better that it is free
B006SV2LWA|2.0|Painfully slow....great cast, but boring, very boring.<br />Moral =  don't eat a pig in Asia that ate bat poo!
0307454568|5.0|This is the third book in the saga of the \\"Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" series by Stieg Larsson. The book is excellent as the 1st and 2nd were. I couldn't put it down until I finished it. As for the shipping it was super fast, I could have been more pleased!
B003O86FMW|5.0|While considerably darker than The Hunger Games, Catching Fire was an immensely thrilling book. An indispensable quality of writing with a voice true to the character teamed with an overwhelming plot full of blood-curdling twists and heart-wrenching turns ensure Catching Fire a special home on my bookshelf. Catching Fire is most definitely the best YA novel to present itself to me in years. The ending does not merely leave you hanging precariously off the edge of your seat, but gives you the sensation of being shoved out of a moving plane. Quite frankly, I loved it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great classic solitaire game.  The software has no real additional features, but passes the time.  And its free.
B000002VMD|5.0|It was shipped quickly and was very nicely packaged.  It arrived right on time and was a joy to listen to.
B006JTS5OO|2.0|The Muppets were beloved because everyone liked to see bits about their favorite characters - be at interaction between the Swedish chefs, Fonzie's bad jokes or the play between Kermit and Miss Piggy.  This new Muppets movie ditches most of that for new characters, a few humans and a Muppet that was raised as a human (a manly muppet?).  The Muppet theater is in danger and of course this man muppet newcomer is the only one who can save it, by bringing the crew back together again.  A few musical numbers and some shallow political digs, and the movie is basically over, with a slap dash ending to put the beast to rest.<br /><br />Through the years the muppets all have carved lives out for themselves, more or less, and even the successful Miss Piggy tosses it all away for a chance to save the little muppet theater.  A grand notion of course, but not a realistic one (but then again, when is this supposed to be realistic?).  The first musical number is charming and quaint with some cute sight gags but it is the only one... the rest are unbearably cheesy and predictable.  And that's probably the best word for the movie right there, predictable.  It feels false, fabricated and made simply to play on nostalgic emotions.  Everything is seen through rose colored glasses and when they finally get their chance to make themselves \\"relevant\\" once again (after Kermit continually points out how washed up and forgotten they are), their grand return pretty much fizzles.  Jack Black as the captive host for their Muppet telathon, could have been a savior, but he's left as a set piece that is more window dressing and presence than anything else.<br /><br />Will you like it?  If you enjoyed The Muppets in the past, you might find this sappy, slapped together movie a half-hearted romp through days gone by.  The movie is completely superficial and yanks on heart strings for emotional effect.  Children will likely be bored to tears.  Neither of mine (ages 5 and 7, both who have seen other Muppet movies and Sesame Street) liked the movie, although they did sit through it.  My seven year old, when asked by someone they knew if they had liked The Muppets, she shouted \\"No, it was boring!\\" and that pretty much sums it up as well...<br /><br />The Muppets... predictable and boring.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I love how with this version you get a little guided line to show where your bird will go! Makes it easier to aim and have your bird land where you want it. I just wish the other games had this option. The gravity is cool and I love how it makes ya think a little different on how to fire your birds. All around, my favorite angry birds game.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I have never used this app, but I am writing my review for other parents, in case they find themselves in my position. My children both received Kindle Fires from their Grandmother for Christmas, as they are avid readers and quickly finish books. I was buying books weekly, which is wonderful. We thought it would be awesome to get them Kindle Fire's where they could read, listen to music, play a few games, and email--all of which they do often.<br /><br />Well, here we are a few months later and my seven year old son, informs me there is \\"sex\\" on his app...in passing. Never hearing the word, or being exposed (they are home schooled) he thought nothing of it. I looked at his fire, and sure enough...there is \\"sex\\" in his app.<br /><br />I quickly talked to him about, removed the app, and asked my husband whether he had \\"vetted\\" the app. Of course he hadn't, and thought it was another fun, drawing, app. My son cried at the thought of removing the app he calls \\"very fun\\" and I must find a replacement and maybe have the \\"talk\\" much sooner than I had ever planned.<br /><br />I'm not criticizing the company, or Amazon...it is a parent's job to research all the content their child comes into contact with. But, with that said...it would make it a lot easier if these apps were rated or their was some sort of parental lock in place on the fire. I'm not new to technology, I have previous generations of Kindles, an iPad, etc. and I know that this is all relatively \\"new\\" technology.<br /><br />With that said, we'll be looking into Doodle Farm, I'm having a gentle, but informing talk with my kiddos...and as parents we will be crazy vigilant about what our kids download. We thought we were doing that, they only download things we approve, but I guess that goes to show us that as parents we have to be up on it--always. For some naive reason, I thought apps had ratings similar to video games. I guess we're not there yet.<br /><br />Rating:<br />I'm giving the app a low rating becauseof its content, and lack of warning. With that said, it was good enough for my son to cry about loosing it...so that doesn't mean it is not a good app, my rating is based solely on content appropriateness for a young Fire user.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Was introduced to this game a few months back and completely fell in love with it and had to buy my own copy. Everything is well packaged and it even comes with a bumper sticker for your car! The end pieces for the playing map didn't fit too well with each other though. Also, some of the end pieces were curved up making it hard to lay the map completely flat on a table. If you want to make the end pieces flat you can slightly bend them inward to straighten it out but you have to be EXTREMELY careful when doing this or the piece will fold completely. Overall, I love this game and other then that little bit about the end pieces it's not enough for me to not recommend this product to everyone I know.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I listened to this recording bought on audible.  The narrator is pleasant to listen to and the story blew me away.  It is unpredictible with twists and turns that make sense while blindsiding the reader.  In other words not unbelievable. The characters are endearing and complex. The book leaves you with the thought of \\"What would I have done?\\"
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This application was a definite success to Rovio. I reccommend this to anybody who even is poorer at the other angry birds games.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is a great app! I use it for a lot of things. Its amazing that an app this good was free! I would recommend other people get this app!
B005CFVSYK|5.0|As I said in my title the straps and heel are like the Crocs Patricia Wedge. But the straps on the Carliana are made of the translucent material which makes it much cuter. I ordered the Carilana in Aqua/Ultraviolent in a size 7. True to size and very cushy. I plan to order the khaki colored ones as well.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|it is a really good game and I hope they make more ! ! ! the sky is not the limit
B005MMJ84K|5.0|This book was much better and faster paced than the first! I struggled a little throught the beginning of the first book until about halfway through when it really picked up. Pandemonium was a definite page turner! The main character definitely evolved in this book, much better than the little naive girl she was portrayed as in the first. I can't wait for the 3rd book!
B0063IH60K|5.0|straight up, no hassle solitare. well presented. i just wanted regular solitare hence the name and i found the one. thank you. peace
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I needed this converter to connect my AppleTV to an old Sony receiver.  I connect the optical digital cable from the AppleTV to this converter box, then connect an RCA (Red & White) from the converter to the analog audio input on the Sony Receiver. It works great.  Now I can play my iTunes library on my Bar in-ceiling speakers!<br />The only small negative is that sometimes the unit doesn't respond.  I need to unplug it and plug it back in again and then it works fine.
B003OFHMKO|5.0|As is often the case,the hype surrounding Esperanza's first album [[ASIN:B0014HC56K Esperanza]] seemed to be as thick as reinforced concrete. And it led me to believe her talents were more in self promotion than in the expression of talent. I suppose it's generational. That situation I just presented has been a case between myself and music many times before. Particularly when it comes to female talent. In Esperanza's case there is the possibility that I read the hype wrongly on all ends. I actually discovered this album,which I also avoided at first,discarded at a local Goodwill. Since she had a third record coming out that was actually peaking my interest,I thought I'd give this album a try first to see what my thoughts were on this talent. The title of this regard chamber music,apparently a communal style of acoustic playing without horns or enormous orchestration,did seem like an economically feasible concept. After all it's easy to become a little jaundiced on this in an economic climate when even creative artists seems to be doing everything on the cheap. No matter the case,the word cheap simply doesn't apply to anything here.<br /><br />  Showcasing Esperanza in a setting including only a pianist,drummer and percussionist along with her upright bass and singing this album has a sound that's hard to describe. No this music is not made in a complicated fashion. But the harmonic interplay between the instrumentation on songs such as \\"Little Fly\\",\\"Knowledge Of Good And Evil\\",\\"Really Very Small\\" and \\"Wild Is The Wind\\" is....well honestly very extraordinary. I cannot say I've heard melodies and chords that flow together in quite this manner before in my years of music listening. Having been an acoustic bass player myself in my youth,I'd have to say Esperanza's bass parts are the most flowing and coherent aspect of the music here. It glides along perfectly with her beautiful (and thankfully never whiny) jazz singing and wordless vocalese that are the most tremendous I've heard second only,of course to Flora Purim. On \\"Apple Blossom\\",the Brazillian aspect of her sound comes through on a close vocal duet with none other than Milton Naschimento,another highly distinctive musical talent. Throughout the rest of the album \\"What A Friend\\",\\"Winter Sun\\",\\"Inutil Paisagem\\" and the closer \\"Short And Sweet\\" she explores a more rhythmically upbeat Brazillian funk sound. Yet at the same time done totally acoustically and with her expansive lyrics.<br /><br />  Overall this is an extremely musical album,with lyrics that are very poetic and thought provoking. Whether it be what she's singing or what she's playing,the person listening to this music will be put into a place where they realize that it's alright to think about the music they are listening to. Yes it's complicated melodically. And she doesn't make it sound like it isn't. But somehow it's very accessible at the same time. The melodies that are here are very strong ones. And lyrical once too. And even though her talent is sometimes overwhelming and her music follows suit,hers is a creative journey that the listener might just feel welcomed enough into to take with her. In my personal case,a part of me wonders what it would've been like if I'd grown up to be her male musical counterpart. I mean if I'd kept up with studies on the upright bass. Probably unlikely considering my love of electricity in music. Either way now have a very deep respect for what Spalding dose. And the creative vision she has. And also the fact that she flaunts and celebrates her ambitions for musical intelligence and innovation. They say that jazz critics are still searching for the next great innovator in the music. Knowing that subculture's tendency to only accept innovation in jazz acoustically,Esperanza might just be what they were looking for all along.I've heard second only,of course to Flora Purim. On \\"Apple Blossom\\",the Brazillian aspect of her sound comes through on a close vocal duet with none other than Milton Naschimento,another highly distinctive musical talent. Throughout the rest of the album \\"What A Friend\\",\\"Winter Sun\\",\\"Inutil Paisagem\\" and the closer \\"Short And Sweet\\" she explores a more rhythmically upbeat Brazillian funk sound. Yet at the same time done totally acoustically and with her expansive lyrics.<br /><br />  Overall this is an extremely musical album,with lyrics that are very poetic and thought provoking. Whether it be what she's singing or what she's playing,the person listening to this music will be put into a place where they realize that it's alright to think about the music they are listening to. Yes it's complicated melodically. And she doesn't make it sound like it isn't. But somehow it's very accessible at the same time. The melodies that are here are very strong ones.

B004BJMEO6|5.0|This is the best movie Nicole Conn has ever done. Even if the premise is pretty standard...\\"straight woman attracted to hot lesbian...\\". The chemistry between the two actresses is undeniable and palbable. The supporting cast of characters are well developed and believable. Sam Harris is adorable as the BFF. I rented the movie for instant download three times before I finally purchased the DVD. That should be an indication of my endorsement for this film.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|To be honest I was not going to read this series. It didn't seem like something I would be interested in. A co-worker was talking about it though so I thought \\"Fine, I'll get it just to see what it is really like.\\" Once I started reading I was captivated. The characters seemed so real and the situation so utterly frustrating.<br /><br />After reading the whole series I felt like I was in shock. For days afterwards I couldn't think straight because I found the whole concept so disturbing and yet frightenengly possible. Even now with the advertisements for the movie I get teary every time I see one, or even if I think about the story for more than a few moments.<br /><br />Because of this I would reluctantly recommend it, and reluctantly only because of the intense emotional reaction I had to it. If the measure of a good novel is the emotional response it instills in the reader then I would say this is the best series I have ever read.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Kaor!!! I won't go into what the movie was about. There are plenty of reviews here that do that very well. Another won't mean that much. I have been waiting 50 years for this movie to come out and I, personally, was not disappointed one bit, despite some of the changes the writers/director made to the original story. In some instances, such as the increased fleshing out (no pun intended about the luscious Lynn Collins) of the character of Dejah Thoris from helpless princess to a more well rounded female personality, was a well founded idea and is proabably (again with the help of Ms Collins exceptional acting ability) part of the reason why everyone who raves about this movie really does so. As so many have said, she stole the movie from Taylor Kitsch. In the scene where he finally realizes he is on Mars, her superior acting ability makes him look superfluous to the scene, unfortunately for him. Don't get me wrong, I think he did a good job for his first starring role, but when placed next to a more seasoned actor such Ms. Collins or even Willem Dafoe as Tars Tarkas, he sadly loses out. I STILL LOVED this movie though, beginning to end.<br />Now, the marketing campaign. I have heard that marketing heads have rolled as a result of the botched effort on this movie. As they should have. From the minute they decided to change the name from John Carter of Mars to just John Carter, it has been a marketing disaster. Several fan made trailers have made their rounds on the internet that did a MUCH better job of describing the story and marketing this movie than the so called professionals ever thought of. I don't know if the people in marketing put the fear of \\"Prince of Persia\\" into Andrew Stanton's head,and this was part of his reasoning for some of the changes, but I feel he bears some of the blame himself. Not for the movie. His movie is magnificent and I really wish there would be the sequels of Gods of Mars and Warlord of Mars, but just how everyone handled the sellingof the movie. It saddened me so much to see only 4-5 people in the movie theater with me when it should have been packed. The movie has it's weak points, to be sure, but it's over all strengths far outweigh any weaknesses.<br />None the less, I have already put in my notice with Amazon.com I want to be notified the minute this movie becomes available to order because I will definitely buy it.
0525478817|5.0|This book is so hard to put down. I started it yesterday and have just fallen completely in love with Green's writing and these characters. Definitely going to recommend this to all of my friends.

B006YM9JSW|5.0|For those waiting for Ivy Bridge-E which is coming later this year it's economical to buy into the LGA 2011 platform and save (allowing you to get your CPU and Motherboard for the price of the 3930k!)<br /><br />Here's some things to consider(even if your waiting for IB-E)<br />It's partially locked but overclockable to 5.7GHZ which is still pretty darn fast however the 3930k is capable of a higher GHZ but that's a unlocked CPU vs a locked CPU.<br /><br />This CPU or more importantly the 2011 platform DOES NOT COME WITH A CPU COOLER(STOCK FAN)!  This CPU has a lower rating than it should because whiny kids don't want to spend the extra $40 on a cooler (your still spending $300 on a motherboard Man up!)<br /><br />For me this just a hold off cpu until ivy bridge-e is released.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Spider is a good game and the app plays it well. Ads are always annoying and distasteful, but you watch TV, right?  What, did you seriously want to PAY for it?
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was captivated by the 50 Shades of Grey Trilogy. Despite the NY TImes description of it as \\"Mommy Porn\\", I found the erotic passages interesting enough but not particularly titillating, especially by volume three. It was Anastasia and Christian, the protagonists, who keep me glued to my iPad. They were skillfully drawn, engaging people about whom I cared. That skill is the key to attracting and maintaining a reader's interest and Ms. Davis has mastered it. Even though some of her literary devices seemed shop worn and over-used as the books progress (inner goddess etc.), I managed to overlook them in my quest to finish this modern fairy tale. The parallels to Twilight are obvious, but this series is very adult in terms of sexual candor. Still, by using first person voice of young Anastasia, the author manages to mitigate the purient parts, and make it all seem curiously innocent. Christian Grey the troubled, gorgeous billionaire is a hot alpha hero who most women would gladly take despite his kinky habits. The author allows us to understand and sympathize with Christian, rather than recoiling from his more bizarre tastes. I found myself rooting for these star-crossed lovers. You will too.
0307593312|2.0|Each time I wearily picked up this book, I found myself checking how many pages there were left to slog through. If the objective was to make the reader feel as though he or she had entered an alternate world that he or she could never leave, then IQ84 succeeded.<br /><br />I've devoured Murakami's books up until now. IQ84 was about five times too long and simply felt like an unedited first draft. Had this been a 200-page novel, it would have been of the same caliber of one of his middling novels like \\"A Wild Sheep Chase.\\" As it was, it was dull, baggy, and repetitive.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Complain about the pacing of the show, or about how the characters are unlikable and how there's too much talking and not enough action. Now flip the show 180 degrees and have a show that's paced too quickly, all the characters are great and likable and non-stop action because hey who needs a plot. Get my point, no matter what the producers of this show do, they're not going to make everyone 100% happy all the time. To completely disregard the behind the scenes drama that took place in the production offices of the show would be disingenous. Realistically one or more actors left the show because of this drama, ultimately leading into storylines that may not have been but the one thing I have to say about the production is that it never lacked. Throughout this season I felt immersed within this world during the 40 minutes that this show was on weekly. As the characters were devestated by what was unfolding before them so was I and to me this is the benchmark of good storytellng in film, movie or any other artform that chooses to tell a story in the traditional sense. Couple this with great acting, writing and directing and for me this show being as amazing as it is becomes a no-brainer. Here's looking forward to many more seasons of this complex and well done show.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|OK, let me get this straight, Amazon.  There are two paid versions.  One for regular android devices for $0.99 and one for your Kindle Fire for $2.99?  So not only can I not use the Kindle Fire version on my Xoom, but you charge me $2.00 more to play it on my Kindle Fire that I bought from YOU?  And if I want to play it on both of my Android tablets, I have to pay $3.98 because you're forcing me to buy both?<br /><br />You are not Apple and this isn't iTunes, stop this!  There is a reason I hate Apple/iTunes -- it's practices like this.<br /><br />Also, Rovio, why are you going along with this?
0316098329|3.0|This book is certainly engaging and a fast, easy read, but I am still not sure how I feel about it. Clearly the telling of the story from a five year old's perspective allows for an interesting perspective, and without it, I have no doubt that this book would not have become a sensation. I did not find the five year old \\"voice\\" to be annoying, nor did I wallow in the inconsistencies. That said, I can see how it would be a deal breaker for some. The story itself is fairly simplistic, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out where it is going. I read it to see what the fuss was all about, and the best I can do is that it was okay. There was just not quite enough back story or explanation for me. I think the very thing that makes it so unique (telling the story from a five year old's perspective), limited the story. Splitting the storytelling between Ma and Jack might have added some depth.
B005HSL626|3.0|good.but I have not many to shop this app! I like the tree's app.where have any free app profits to
