0767919408|5.0|I'm not sure how I have gone so long without reading a Bill Bryson book, but this was my first. I own at least three others, but have never given in to the urge to read them. The idea of a snapshot in time as short as a summer being significant intrigued me, so I picked up this book. Very glad I did.<br /><br />Bryson writes beautifully and covers a staggering range of material for so short a time period. As a reader, I came to the book unaware of almost every subject he discusses. Of course, I knew that Lindbergh had flown over the Atlantic and Babe Ruth had hit 60 home runs, but had no idea of the real impact either event made or that they both happened in the summer of 1927. Bryson sums up much of what he covers on the last in one of the last paragraphs of the book:<br /><br />\\"So it is perhaps worth pausing for a moment to remember just some of the things that happened that summer: Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs. The Federal Reserve made the mistake that precipitated the stock market crash. Al Capone enjoyed his last summer of eminence. The Jazz Singer was filmed. Television was created. Radio came of age. Sacco and Vanzetti were executed. President Coolidge chose not to run. Work began on Mount Rushmore. The Mississippi flooded as it never had before. A madman in Michigan blew up a school and killed 44 people in the worst slaughter of children in American history. Henry Ford stopped making the Model T, and promised to stop insulting Jews. And a kid from Minnesota flew across an ocean and captivated the planet in a way it had never been captivated before.\\"<br /><br />Highlight of the book for me include:<br /><br />* Lindbergh was definitely the most fascinating subject. I don't want to give anything away because Bryson does such a good job telling the story, but I had no clue how famous he really was, the impact he made to our current aviation industry, his affection for Hitler, and his double life that was only recently discovered. Will definitely be buying a separate biography.<br />* Babe Ruth and the 1927 Yankees. As someone who cannot really watch any baseball at all without getting bored, Bryson did an excellent job of making everything about this season and the players fascinating.<br />* The short coverage he gives to Prohibition and its woes was fascinating<br />* I really enjoyed the assessment of authors in the 1920's, and his insight into why the bestselling authors of that era are virtually unknown<br />* Learned quite a bit about Presidents Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover (or Superman, as he liked to refer to himself)<br />* The eugenics fascination of the 1920's was downright scary. 60,000 people in the U.S. were sterilized, and the Supreme Court voted in favor of it by a margin of 8-1. Seriously . . .<br /><br />The only negative I could give about the book is that it drags a little in the last real chapter, September: Summer's End. Not enough to effect the whole book, but at 450 pages it read surprisingly fast up to that point.<br /><br />I wish history was taught like this in schools and that textbooks were as fascinating as this work. If you like baseball, you'll love this book. If you are interested in flying, you'll love this book. If you like history in any way, you will love this book. Highly recommended.rate biography.<br />* Babe Ruth and the 1927 Yankees.

B005HJWWW8|3.0|The evolution of the E5 portable amplifier that served as my very first portable amplifier before I eventually returned it in favor of the CMoyBB (and because the volume rocker broke), the Fiio E6 is, in some ways, little more than a sidegrade or de-evolution from the E5 as a total product. For instance, the E6 is now clad in shiny black plastic rather than the metal and plastic housing of the E5 and also lacks the sturdy metal clip of the E5, instead opting for a transparent plastic clip which, frankly, isn’t as good.<br /><br />In terms of sound quality, it actually sounds rather good for an amplifier as inexpensive as it is. It has a warm, smooth sound that, while prone to smoothing over some micro detailing, sounds good nonetheless. Though the E6 is prone to mild hissing, you probably won’t notice it once the music gets going.<br /><br />Two of the E6’s three EQ settings focus on boosting the low end, a feature present on just about every Fiio amplifier I’ve come across. The E6’s implementation isn’t as good as I’d like, however and ends up boosting more than just low end frequencies. EQ1 provides a massive bass boost that can end up muddying up the sound on all but the most bass-anemic of headphones/earphones. EQ2 provides a more sensible boost that doesn’t introduce anywhere near as much mud and is quite enjoyable. The third EQ option is made to accommodate line level inputs from powerful portable players.<br /><br />The sound overall is warm and smooth and, with the added bass boost, one that will likely appeal to consumers looking for a bit more power than their smartphone or MP3 player alone can provide. With the bass boost off, the sound is mostly clean with a decent level of transparency but nothing to write home about, frankly.<br /><br />The E6 provides what should be ample power for common loads but simply doesn’t have the output power or current for high impedance loads. In most cases, this isn’t going to be much of an issue since many consumer focused earphones and headphones on the market today don’t need much driving power but the E6 will likely clip before you reach listening levels on heavy loads.<br /><br />All things considered, the E6 isn’t a bad amplifier, more a versatile but still merely adequate amplifier. But for about $30 or so, adequate more or less comes with the territory. It’s certainly one of the better amplifiers I’ve heard in its price range though, and the bass boost feature is likely to be quite favorable to casual listeners and bassheads who just can’t get enough.d earphones and headphones on the market today don’t need much driving power but the E6 will likely clip before you reach listening levels on heavy loads.<br /><br />All things considered, the E6 isn’t a bad amplifier, more a versatile but still merely adequate amplifier.

B003O86FMW|2.0|Whenever I read the word \\"teenage\\" associated to books or films, I tend to stay away. Luckily though, I stumbled upon \\"The Hunger Games\\", by accident. Fast pace, eerie (and yet very natural looking) dystopic future, loads of political and social satire. Exciting to say the least.<br /><br />The story was good all through its length, the kind of book you just can't stop reading, until the disappointing end. And then came Catching Fire. Let's skip the first third of the book, where all we read are extremely boring and over detailed descriptions of Katniss' dresses and her oh-so-confusing New-Moony dilemma about whether she loves Peeta or Gale. She's barely the hunter tomboy girl who's too busy being hungry or politically aware to realize she's pretty, the girl from the first book we all loved. The whole purpose of the stylists and beauty team being changed from \\"trying to convert a nice normal girl into a product for the cameras, for the preys of gossip vultures who will be watching TV, criticizing the pressure towards celebrities, the transformation into something you're not\\", into pleasing reader girls who will actually be wishing to be in the hands of beauty experts to prettify them, who will be eager to know what look she'll wear next.<br /><br />When we are finally past that, we pick up with the end of Hunger Games: the lazy, weakly and vaguely justifiable uprisings starting in all the districts (interrupted by yet another description of all 6 or 7 wedding dresses she's trying on), and the terrible threat she now supposes to the government. Let's think for a second of this world Suzanne Collins immerses us in: So for 73 years, people have been starving and dying in the hands of a tyrant cruel government. And now, because some kids threatened to eat some poison Romeo & Juliette style, all the system starts being unacceptable, outrageous, too much to take. Seriously, let's think of this world, and the two major flaws of the whole premise:<br /><br />1) For 73, yes 73 years, no possible atrocity committed in the arena was revolting enough to start any sort of riot. No one, in 73 years, thought of anything barely as provocative as eating berries. Imagine the first Hunger Games, the very first. When a lot of absolutely terrified 12 to 18 year olds were dumped into an arena to fight to the death. No one cried, no one simply refused to kill anyone and just sat there, in a circle, no one, say, thought of killing themselves before. Remember, on year one or even 2, it would be impossible to have \\"Careers who trained their whole life\\". It's even difficult to think how the killings even started, as we know from the book, there was no major sign of historical rivalry among the districts, justifying some blood thirsty candidates eager to finish off kids not from their hood. But no, eating berries was the ultimate (and apparently the very first) sign of subversion. Lazy, to say the least.<br /><br />2) Why is eating the berries such a big deal? In a world where young people are \\"reaped\\" from their homes to kill each other and this is all just a very successful TV show where all of them are, on top, treated like celebrities, a world where everything is just entertainment, it's just impossible not to image a highly skilled marketing/media team to deal with:<br /><br />a) whatever happens in the arena, in terms of manipulating the images, editing content, creating biased opinions for the viewers, etc. Is there really a life or death issue if one year there are no victors? Couldn't they get around with \\"aww, this is so cute! They both died. Don't miss another exciting edition of the Hunger Games next year!\\"? Couldn't they have stricken any of them with a lightning and proclaimed the other victor, if it matters so much? After 73 years (that is 1,679 killed children) of murders, why does a lovey-dovey couple destabilizes a Country? Seriously, did nothing more shocking than that happened so far?<br /><br />b) whatever impact the Games - a reality TV show - have on society. Aw man, please. Now the President himself is saying Katniss will have to marry Peeta? Otherwise what, people will think she was just using a strategy to save a friend she is not romantically involved with? And this is really unacceptable, right? If it turns out they were really in love, people won't see it as an act of rebellion. But if she was just leading him on... woh! Besides, a country who loves extreme reality TV shows to this point, please..., must be used to convenience dating to sell more magazines or raise the popularity of one celebrity or another. The stars of Twilight dated, the stars of High School Musical dated, why can't the stars of the 70 sometieth edition of the Hunger Games have their moment too? Then send some paparazzi to show how the \\"slut\\" has dumped poor baker guy and sell magazines with stealthy pictures of her and Gale. Everyone gets brain numbed by the gossip, and the revolution will carry on being just a delusion of stoner idealistic weirdos. Like in the real world.y TV show - have on society. Aw man, please.

B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I made sure I had ample space on my Kindle, and it seemed to initially load just fine. It starts with an opening scene with minion of the month, and as soon as it gets to the end of that scene my screen fills with minions and it says it's loading. It never finishes loading. I once left it for hours and it never went beyond that point. I uninstalled and reinstalled it a few times with no luck. I was excited to play this game based on the very positive reviews and don't understand what happened. I'm curious if this happened to anyone else.
B008JFUR10|5.0|A beautiful movie overall. Great characters, an engaging story mixed In with romance and a grand tone.<br /><br />The Robot X Monster fights are the meat in this film. Guillermo Del Toro did outstanding in his work.<br /><br />If you love mechs, sci fi, anime, or a monster film, please, watch Pacific Rim in any form you can. Blu Ray is a must.

0345803493|3.0|The main character is a recently deflowered virgin who already has a vocabulary on a variety of sexual positions that beats me.  is there too much sex here?  Maybe.  But is that what women need in a relationship?  Lots of sex?  The male character starts out as the antagonist then arcs into a hero creating antagonists as he reforms into a somewhat normal fianc&eacute;e.  A followup on the first installment of the trilogy with a clear link to the villains in the concluding volume.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I pre-ordered this right away, as I have many Apple devices and Android devices, and I love the airplay feature that my Apple products have to my Apple TV. This is Google's take on the idea of slinging your video from device to TV, or redirecting what you're doing on a mobile device to the TV, as well as laptop browsers (Chrome).<br /><br />Setup:<br /><br />My setup was not flawless. It kept telling me that it could not connect my Chromecast to my wireless network. After some jimmying around forward & back, I was able to get it to work without changing any settings. I chock this up to developer hiccups and lack of product maturity. I did the setup from my iPhone, using Chrome browser.<br /><br />My first Cast was from the Youtube app on iPhone 5 to the Chromecast. It worked flawlessly.<br /><br />My second attempt was to Cast from browsers. It is important to know that there is a downloadable app from google to do Casting from computers, plus a Chrome plug in.<br /><br />Attempt 1: Chrome browser on Macbook Air, latest model 2013: Failed miserably. Connected fine but resolution was total artifact.<br /><br />Attempt 2: Chrome browser on Windows 7 on laptop ( a virtual on the Mac) failed miserably: Chrome app told me that I wasn't connected to wifi. It wasn't smart enough to realize I had internet though every other app under the sun has no issue with this. I'm sure this will be fixed.<br /><br />Attempt 3: CR-41 (Chromebook) sharing the tab worked. Slinging video did not work.<br /><br />Attempt 4: Nexus 7 ( latest model ) worked great with Netflix app and sligning/casting the video.<br /><br />In conclusion, use at your own risk until the platform is more developed. It's going to be a great opening and feature for those who live in an Android world and want a feature set similar to Airplay (while they accomplish it differently, that doesn't mater, it's invisible to the user).<br /><br />I would fully recommend this for any nerds, since the price is right and part of the fun is figuring out what works and what doesn't. For the rest of the world, unless you plan to only sling netflix video from a mobile device, I'd say it's not ready.<br /><br />As far as usage goes, it did feel weird that the device simply sits there and waits for video to sling: There is no menu to use, no &#34;apps&#34; or other interactivity on the screen as far as selections or options go. It does feel very headless. There is no remote control app, or browser control app, though you can modify a few settings from the browser.<br /><br />This is going to be the next hotness in home TV, and Google is finally there with a good competitor to Airplay.<br /><br />Bring on the competition and making everyone better!<br /><br />UPDATE: Many updates have happened since I originally got this device. A lot of the hiccups are fixed, and many more apps are coming to the device. I really support this for anyone who has an Android or doesn't already own a lot of music/media with Apple.of the fun is figuring out what works and what doesn't.

B00DGNO3WE|4.0|It was a very cute movie. I love Maggie Smith and would watch her in anything she makes, TV or movies
1400095204|4.0|What I remember about Biafra can be summed up in one word:  starvation.  The real story, though, is a lot more complicated.  Three lives unfold in this novel about Nigeria during that turbulent time.  The first is that of Ugwu, a teenager who becomes the houseboy for Odenigbo, a university scholar and idealist.  The second is Odenigbo's girlfriend, Olanna, the daughter of a tribal chief and successful businessman.  Third is Richard, an Englishman who is in love with Olanna's practical but headstrong sister, Kainene.  All except Richard are Igbo people and find themselves fearing for their lives when the Nigerians in power begin to threaten the Igbo with genocide.  War breaks out, and the Igbo secede, forming the country of Biafra.  Optimistic until the end, the Igbo profoundly believe that the war will be short, and Biafra will triumph.  Certainly, the novel describes how the people adapt to an abrupt change in quality of life, but the author doesn't dwell on the hardships.  Ugwu, whose background is more impoverished than that of the others, in some ways has the most difficult adjustment, as he has to stay out of sight to avoid conscription.  The main theme, though, is betrayal, making our characters somewhat of a microcosm of Nigeria itself, with an end result of uneasy peace and unimaginable loss.  I have to admire how Adichie made this piece of history live and breathe, with an inside look at its effect on those who lived through it.  Reading this book was certainly a learning experience, and I absorbed some of the pain emanating from these characters.  I had one major objection, and that was that there's a 4-year gap in which something traumatic happened.  The author repeatedly alludes to these life-altering events, and I kept backtracking to see if I had missed something.  Later in the book she reveals what happened, but I found it very annoying that she kept teasing me with this omitted information.

B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a fun game if you you either don't mind spending money or are patient. I'm neither but since I refuse to pay for games on my Kindle I have learned to be patient. There are a lot of elements that I still don't quite get (& I have been playing for over a week now) but I'm getting the hang of it. I do like that it is a long game & you don't find everything all at once & then it's over like other hidden object games, I can see playing this for months.<br /><br />I like to read thru the reviews before I purchase a game so best advise for future purchasers is be prepared to either be patient for your energy & coins to be resorted or be prepared to pay. I also like that the items keep moving so it's very challenging & there are other elements to this game other than finding the objects. Be patient & have fun, that's what these games are meant for!

I hadn't seen the movie and maybe if I had I wouldn't have been so confused with the setting up of what was to follow.  Based on the novel I really had no desire to see the film.

I am not sure why, but just want so much more out of these movies since I was such a big part of my childhood.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love uno! This app is great you can play with people from all over just like you guys were all sitting at the table!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I saw this in the theater in 3D and was amazed back then, but then I bought it recently on 3D for home and was even more impressed. The active glasses just make this movie so much better and the 3D is much clearer, brighter. Bery happy with this movie and the 3D is just awesome.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I really like it somethings are hard. but besides that it is a very good app! I gave it a four star review
B00D7JGL36|5.0|\\"Bakersfield\\" is a true gem that honors the best era in country music history. Vince Gill & Paul Franklin are absolute masters of their craft with the longevity and accolades to put to rest any skepticism of undertaking such a daunting challenge as this album must have presented. While I understand that all genres of music must grow with the times and the audience, there will never be another Buck, another Merle, another Cash, Willie, Loretta, or Hank. And there will certainly never be another Vince or another Paul. Thank you from my very traditional (31 year old) heart for making an album that is truly timeless. I hope it opens the ears and hearts of new listeners to take a journey to discover the original Bakersfield sound!
B000V9D5LG|4.0|I have worked with high end equipment from other production outfits.  On jobs like those you want the best equipment, usually the firms rent high end equipment as needed.  I'm starting my own company now.  I invested in this lens because of its price.  In the right hands this lens can render great images and video.  The minimum aperture of 4.0 @ 55mm is descent, and better than 5.6 on the kit lens (18-55).  Just note that the minimum focal distance is 1 meter, you cant focus on subjects closer than 1 meter.<br /><br />This is not an inner focus lens, or weather sealed, or has metal construction.  I knew that.  but for $120, it has a long zoom range, image stabilization, and better bokeh than most camcorders.<br /><br />My purpose for this lens is build a portfolio and serve as a workhorse for my first few paid gigs.  The return on the investment will be quick, with that investing on better glass will be sooner rather than later.  Just put a hood/matte box over it and the clients wont even notice... as if they even care, your final product should should build your credibility, not your gear.
B004I744AS|4.0|Not only is it so easy to use, but all the fun things on the home page are handy entertainment, for &#34;short times&#34; in the Dr office waiting room, which is almost a daily occurrence.
B0091X2K0A|5.0|This is one of the best film that has been made by Hollywood.  All cast actors really came across with very realistic presentations.  This film is a real keeper
B005544TRQ|5.0|The Characters are well developed and their interactions are true theater. We want more! You will get hooked.  Love the wardrobe, very sexy.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The kids love this game but it is extremely slow to load and they want you to buy things all the time.  It has been making my Kindle freeze up.  I'm going to remove it.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Great casting, greater acting, esp that of JRM. Beautiful costumes and beautiful people in the court.  Wonderful sceneries and great castles and palaces to see.  If you love English history, this will not disappoint you. Watching the series is the closest to get transported to one of the most interesting and dramatic, though gory, period in English history.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|LOVE THIS APP VERY ACCURATE AND EASY TO LOAD AND USE!! CAN LOOK AT DAILY HOURL OR FORECAST FOR THE WEEK
B008YW5RH2|5.0|I love it<br />It's the best game ever<br />I'm glad I found this<br />Thanks for making it<br />This is the best
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Great visuals. Interesting concept. Great on Blue Ray. If you saw it at the show, you'll like even more on your own big screen.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is so cool and I am having so much fun playing this game and wedding salon also prom salon these games are awesome!!!!!!!!!!
072325804X|5.0|Beautiful book all of the stories are here, this is the same book as the other one on amazon with a bit different cover and cost more.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|kids love it my kids are teenagers and they like it...I have played it a time or too or three!!
B004NS710C|5.0|After watching this several times, I still get so glued to the TV.  I still get nervous even though I know what is next.  Denzel Washington was really believable and I think that this was one of Christ Pine's better movie roles.  This is a keeper!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|How convenient to flip things to your TV from your Android :-) smartphone, tablet, or Google Chrome instantly!! Man, this has been a gem of a product! Love it
B001665HW8|5.0|This is not for the die hards, lets face it, we have all of these songs already, & the official YTSEJAM bootlegs, this is for those that may have heard one of their songs like Pull Me Under & are interested in what other gems they have to offer.  I, like most, was drawn in by PMU & bought Images & Words, call it the gateway drug to what DT is.  Then I took a chance & bought Awake, after that I stayed away for 10 years, then I saw Live at Budokan at a local CD store & decided to check out how they were live... then it hit me, I wasted 10 years & set out buying the entire catalog, the DVD's, the official YTSEJAM bootlegs, & spent megabucks on ebay for as many of the official fan club CD's I could find.  I see them now whenever they come near my town.  Are there songs missing that should've been included, sure, to die hards this could've been a 6 hour collection of the favorites, I've made a play list of all mine & it would've filled 7 cd's, that's not the point of this release.<br /><br />So for those unfamiliar with DT, this is a great jumping off point, had this been around when I first discovered them, I might not have lost out on 10 years of my favorite band.  Buy this, enjoy it, seek out more of their material, start with Images & Words, listen to Metropolis Part 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper, you won't be disappointed, then get Scenes From a Memory, from there, you'll be hooked.  ENJOY!!!
B009WUAK2M|2.0|I will say this, it did make me want to check out Expendables 1 but I didn't because amazon is charging for that and of course this one is free.  I saw that it has 4 stars and decided to give it a try.  I like all the actors that are in it, but I found the story line weak and all the one liners, that referenced past movies incredibly ridiculous.  When chuck Norris came into the picture I was done.
B00004TS0E|5.0|I love this movie and had always wanted it on dvd.  I just happened to see it and thought it was a good price.  the dvd is good quality and plays great.
0345525558|5.0|After finishing The Language of Flowers by Vanessa Diffenbaugh, I can't decide if I totally bought the ending, but I still consider it a 5 star book. It is a compelling read with well-developed and interesting (flawed) characters. Not to mention, as an added bonus, I now know more about the symbolism of different flowers than I ever imagined.<br /><br />I also liked the way the writer went back and forth (chapter by chapter) between present time and the past. It made perfect sense, and I thought it worked well for telling this story.<br /><br />As a novelist myself, I read lots of fiction to study my craft and discern what works and doesn't work. I found a lot in this story that really worked. Well done.<br /><br />Susan Gabriel<br /><br />author of the novel, The Secret Sense of Wildflower (historical, southern, coming-of-age)<br /><br />(starred review--Kirkus Reviews and voted a best book of 2012)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the detail and emotion the book has compared to the movie. I feel like I just watched the behind the scenes version of the movie.<br /><br />I would recommend all my friends read this of they haven't already.
B005AKFXZW|4.0|This book draws you in and twists and turns at a magical rate. If you feel like something different this is a unique read.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I knew Gaiman would never disappoint, but had no idea how amazing this book would be. He's given me yet another amazing new world to explore, and I'll definitely be reading it again!
0345525558|5.0|This book was the perfect blend of love, mystery and family. I book that you can't put down this is one of the best reads out there.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Title says it all. Ive been playing ps3 since the day it came out, ive literally grown up with it. Best controller to buy, its classic. But $40 is in my opinion $10-$20 over priced, so 4\5 stars.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I liked the old app better because it was so much easier to navigate. I also liked being able to view the iWitness pictures there. Now I have to go to the web page to see them. Bring back the old app please!
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|We loved it.  Family entertainment / date night kind of movie.  Very witty and delightful.  I recommend this to anyone.  You might think there is too much Zombie stuff out there these days, but this is just a lovely movie.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|the USB cable fits much tighter then the old ones did, I got for free because of the defect in the first Fire connection. I would have paid for it because I needed one that fit tighter.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This is deeper than it appears at first and will stay with you a long time. But even if you just enjoy the surface of the film you will be amazed at the images on screen. Great film for any age but if you want to make it a family movie night (we did), watch with your kids if they are younger than 11. There is a scene where the ship sinks and people die and another scene at the end where an alternate storyline is suggested that is pretty brutal. No images just words in that one but disturbing to a younger set of ears. I'd watch this again just for the beautiful cinematography and graphics.
B003HNNS06|5.0|This movie is a great movie and they are even going to have another!  Percy Jackson is a great star.!  It really had a lot of action and a lot of cool scenes in it.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|i bought this for my 3 month old grandson on a recommendation from a friend. he's still to small to leave alone in it, but i sit with him and support him some with big books under his feet and it is amazing how strong his little legs have gotten. Its pretty cute to see his face and his struggle to stand..he's pretty pleased with himself. A GREAT INVESTMENT..it looked a little busy to me but he seems to love all the colors and the caribbean music !
B00BEXB18M|5.0|great sound metal music, Megadeth always rules, Buy it soon !!!<br />Megadeth never disappoint to you - Strong, powerfull, fast
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the time era in which the show is set.The ladies dresses are gorgeous.<br />The show deals well with the whole upstairs (the family) and the well run downstairs ( the servants).
B00BJDARGO|5.0|Great image, sound, everything, good art work, I love Whitesnake, y his voice Mr. Coverdale, You never repent about buy it, the band with Dave are genious.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|You can choose moblile version or full version! I use both because there are different things to offer on each! I had accidently set my kindle on Parental Controls and forgot the password and wasn't able to connect to Facebook for a year! I found this app and I can get on facebook now!! I highly recommend this app!! 10/5 stars!!
0374275637|5.0|This book opened my eyes to what my eyes don't see!  If every manager read this book and put it into practice, America would be so much better off.  The scariest part is that Mad Ave and the politicians (of all stripes - a pox on all their houses) are using the knowledge in this book to manipulate us all.  And it's damned near impossible to keep up with the manipulations.<br /><br />Read it for self defense if nothing else.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I had seen on the news that unpublished electronic book authors have found a way to make their books on Amazon.com have over 500+ five star reviews.<br /><br />When I purchased this book before it was published as a hardback, I thought I had found one of those authors who fake their Amazon rating.<br /><br />Holy hell. I was 100% wrong.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and purchase this book. Before Joe Abercrombie came to the Fantasy scene, I was so tired of the drawn out \\"goody goody\\" crap that I was going to stop reading sci-fi novels altogether.<br /><br />Then I read Abercrombie and was bown away. I couldnt get enough. Alas I read all of his novels and didnt know what to do in between his books. I was ready to quit the genre again.<br /><br />Then Amazon.com recommended Anthony Ryan. An unpublished electronic book author with over 600+ five star ratings. I thought that either this author was great, or he had found a way to fool Amazon's rating system like I saw on the news. After all, the book was iincredibly cheap as well.<br /><br />Trust me when I say that this author deserved every star. His debut sci-fi fantasy novel, for me, is one of the best books I have ever read. Not just a great fantasy novel, but a great novel period.<br /><br />I woud go into more detail about why it is so great, but typing out this review on my Kindle Paperwhite is a pain in the buttocks.<br /><br />Just buy this. I already own the Kinde copy, but this is one of those rare books that I will also buy the hardback copy. And if a collectors copy becomes available, I will buy that too.<br /><br />SPOIL YOUR BRAIN AND BUY THIS BOOK!<br />Hugs and kisses,<br />Jerry / Gerald
B00425S1H8|5.0|Very nice plug and play install and works great for USB to DB9 uses.  Use this with Cisco console cables to connect to a laptop in a server room and does the job well.
B00C1GBOU6|4.0|This is a new work that has some continuity to their melodies and feeling from prior work. It´s a nice piece to collect if you´re a Sigur Ros fan but if you´re looking to start loving them consider Heima or Inni.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|All of it was predictable and it was not at all funny.  I wanted to see Streisand<br />but really surprised she chose to do this.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|crack for the ocd peeps. would be nice if they allowed for control sensitivity adjustment. Also, it would be cool if it were a story board game (like progressing through the temple) rather than just escaping. Otherwise, great game.
B00CA4S27W|5.0|A very well done album that has a good mix of songs so nothing sounds alike. If you are a Blackmore's or BN fan, I highly recommend this album.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|we love this game - its fun for all ages! my son and I take turns playing it nightly! enjoy the different characters its too cute.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Where Oblivion succeeds most is as a pure sensory experience.  I suggest you watch this film on the biggest screen possible with the volume loud - very few movies look or sound as good as this one does.  Three elements make this movie worth watching (and owning on blu-ray):<br /><br />1. The Design - the technology and architecture is amazing.  You can tell that the production design was given a great deal of care (in fact, many of the designs come directly from the director's graphic novel).  I think the Bubbleship is an amazing vehicle and a great design.  Movies like this present exciting possibilities for what future technology might look like - and that's something I enjoy contemplating.<br /><br />2. The Locations - I love when movies take you to places that you might never get to visit in person.  A lot of this movie was shot in real locations (in particular the amazing landscapes of Iceland), rather than on soundstages with bluescreen.  It's also interesting to see recognizable landmarks (the Pentagon, the Washington Monument, Empire State Building, etc) deserted and destroyed.  Of course, the destruction is all thanks to visual effects, but it looks very realistic.<br /><br />3. The Soundtrack - the original music for the film was written by M83, and it's the best movie score of the year.  The soundtrack perfectly compliments the visuals.  In fact, the blu-ray has an isolated score so you can watch the movie with only the music (no dialogue or sound effects) - watching the movie this way illustrates how much of the story can be conveyed through the music alone.<br /><br />A lot of the criticisms of the movie deal with the fact that the movie is derivative - that it borrows ideas from other films.  I would not dispute that claim; I would just say that not every movie is going to be groundbreaking in terms of story or plot.  I think there are enough ideas in this movie to keep it interesting - even if I've seen it all before, I haven't seen it quite like this..
B006S01GH2|5.0|European, and particularly French. Wonderful characters, plot, lots of fun, a little long but absolutely charming and full of humor. No car chases, explosions, heroics, or Bruce Willis.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Like the fun challenges of finding and using the tools. Interesting choices sometimes on how to use the tools. Puzzles, codes,colors, I will be playing this when I can.
B00BF123WG|5.0|We know the ending but so what. Because this encompasses twelve years, the time folding makes the story line somewhat abrupt. Some viewers may find the characters a bit over the top but remember this is Hollywood all the way.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I love this show.  It constantly gives you twists and turns that you never expected.  And shocks you continuously. I watched the entire season in one day because I could not stop watching!
0060987464|5.0|I absolutely adore Marilyn Manson! Reading this book lets you see a whole new aspect of him that most would never expect. I could read this over and over.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the period costumes and set designs.  The chemistry between the cast is phenomenal.  Cannot wait for next season!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I play this game every chance I get its awesome all of my friends play it too I highly recommend this game to any strategy game lover
B00005LC1H|5.0|This was in very good shape and I would certainly buy from this seller again.  I have not played all the DVD disk but I trust this seller so far.  I think you buy this collection you will laugh out loud, too funny.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Would be better if you could zoom out to see your whole park and if the underwater territory didn't use only cash for larger expeditions.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|This dinosaur is really cool.  The paint job is really well done, and the opening/closing jaw is fun too.  Super sturdy, expect to have this toy for a long time.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Really like this, different than anything else I have. Love the fast pace of it. I would get it again.
B0073QYC2G|5.0|This dinosaur is really cool.  The paint job is really well done, and the opening/closing jaw is fun too.  Super sturdy, expect to have this toy for a long time.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I love this movie it was funny n sad but mostly funny love all the actors I really in joy it
B009R659L8|5.0|Over the years most of Mary H. Clark's  mysteries have been great reads; there are few that I have been disappointed in.  The family dynamics in this book made for drama in addition to the mystery angle.  I really liked the character of Kate even tho' I thought she did some stupid things, but then there wouldn't have been a story.
6305718954|4.0|It was a good movie it makes u think about the church  and if is good to go because if god is every were y go to church
B00448VST6|5.0|If you or somebody you know is into older video games, in particular the original Nintendo from the 80's, then many of the jokes will be very familiar. The target audience are adults in their 20's, but it can be appreciated by the Atari and XBox generations as well. It is an incredible film that was written well with a great cast of characters.
B000067FP8|5.0|I really in joy this movie it was funny and cute with all the  gremlins I love gizmo  he was my fav
B000I9TY4G|5.0|Directed by Joss Whedon this film picks up and fills some gaps in the Firefly series. If you have not seen the TV show fear not, this film is still a great watch. There are a number of action sequences, plenty of humor, and fun characters that work well together as the plot thickens.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I'm a guy... and I loved this movie. I say that because I thought this was going to be a Twilight-like movie that has the girls all crazy about vampires but boy was I wrong! This was a fun movie! I know a lot of people compare it to an Asian film with a similar plot (the name escapes me at the moment) but let me tell you that I have seen both and although they are similar... They are very different movies in terms of style and themes. So don't let that stop you from watching this film!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book, along with &#34;Proof of Heaven,&#34; rocked my understanding of why we are here and how to live our lives. Very inspirational.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this app i love horses and animals so im glad to be able to take care of a virtual one!!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoy this game very much. It can be very addictive, but great use of the brain!  Recommend this game to anyone!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I bought another car charger for my Android phone and iPad and was dismayed to discover that it had a very bright blue light on it. At night it was terribly distracting in the car, and I kept covering it up. I was thrilled to find this charger that supported both high amperage output and had no ugly light on it. Thank you.
B000NJMJGG|5.0|I watched this movie as a child and have always had fond memories. Then I rewatched the film... Do your self a favor and buy the movie, unplug your brain for an hour and a half and lose your mind. You will not be dissappointed.
B0061P2L5U|5.0|A coworker who has severe allergies highly recommended this book to me. Though I was a bit skeptical, I was also curious, and finally decided to buy and read it. Great book. A new theory, backed up by a fair amount of data, about the current epidemic of allergies and autoimmune disorders. Well worth reading, even if you don't totally buy the book's thesis.
B008602KQI|2.0|Poor movie. No character development. Was there a plot? Too many dark scenes. Typical poor depiction of the future. Do not view it.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|This game has really nice graphics and ambience. The puzzles have the right difficulty. If you are into point and click adventure game you should get this.<br />I wish there as a second part of this game, I would buy it instantly.
0316247545|4.0|my daughter cant read by herself yet, so i read a little to her about the pony history etc. its cute, entertaining. SHe enjoys looking at all the photos as well. I think there are newer ponies that are not in this book, but its not a big deal. OVerall we are happy with the book, it looks like the ELements of Harmony book on the show too. cute
0399162097|5.0|Rosemary, the narrator of the intelligent novel WE ARE ALL COMPLETELY BESIDE OURSELVES had an unusual early childhood.  Her parents raised her for the first five years of her life with a chimpanzee named Fern of her approximate age.  Her father a psychology professor at Indiana University and a team of graduate students studied the ways Fern and Rosemary acquired skills and language and the two were treated like sisters.  Then one day Rosemary went to stay with her grandparents and when she returned her family had moved to a new house, her sister Fern was gone and her mother deeply depressed.  Her father explained that Fern was living an idyllic life on a farm.  But was that the truth?  Rosemary's older brother Lowell first found out otherwise and the knowledge made him run from home and set him on the road to life as a radical animal rights activist.<br /><br />Well rendered themes of family, parenting, guilt, memory, self, language and learning are woven throughout the storyline.  Author Karen Joy Fowler does a great job of integrating pertinent facts of psychology, philosophy, linguistics and primate story in to the story in a seamless manner.  WE ARE ALL COMPLETELY BESIDE OURSELVES gets five stars from me for the well executed, original premise and fine writing.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Don't expect to win every time, but it's so satisfying when you do!  You select the difficulty and it never becomes too easy.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Almost done with the full series! I Will be sad once I read the last book, but this series has kept me very busy for the last couple of months.
B0001I55NS|5.0|I'm not a big sci-fi fan but our whole family loves this movie. It's so realistic and so neat to see people have an adventure back in time! Keeps your attention the whole time.
006178480X|5.0|This book didn't disappoint, i couldn't put it down. James Rollins  did a marvelous job and I can't wait for the next book to come out.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A heartbreaking but joyous novel. Writing about deplorable conditions in the Irish orphanages of days past. The psychological scares that can haunt one who has endured such a horrible childhood An amazing ending totally unseen that lifts you up and makes you believe sometimes miracles do happen. Sweet gentle characters you wish you knew. Unbelievable 1st Novel. I will read all the Christina McKenna novels I can find!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Fun to play and very quick.  Don't have to wait forever for someone to play.  Fun for all!<br />It is nice to be able to login with Facebook as well.
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|I rarely give review but I must say that this video opened my eyes to what Katy Perry is all about. You see I just though she was another young singer with a unique idea for staging and costumes.<br />This showed me her range of voice, her heart and vision. Her positive influence. Shows how even when the world seem like it has bought you down you an keep going. Sometime projecting that everthing is good can get you thru it. She never let the fans down.Her ssongs are very real you just have to listen.<br />I commend you for your work ethic and music. I hope Katy never looses her possitive happy personality. Remember age doest kill that light experiences in our life will if we let it.
B00DDZM0GQ|2.0|Downloaded and installed the game and it tried to load but was obviously glitchy un installed and tried again still the same problem. You can see bars and I am guessing you normally can push them but not the case. I hope the developer can get the kinks worked out as this looks like a real fun game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Im so ossessed with this game , i love it !!! Im always trying to get to a better score !
B003O86FMW|5.0|First, I would like to start by saying that I LOVE the whole trilogy! Simply put, this book is not quite as good as the 1st but, better than the 3rd (final).
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|fantastic movie! And movie had no buffering and did not have any technical issues. It was totally worth the money and this is my new favorite movie!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Great read. Nicholas Sparks keeps me hooked til the end! Highly recommend this book and all of his other books.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|WTF? A free dictionary for my kindle?OK.........um........it was good,I guess.....informational and all that.....and lighter than carrying a Webster intermediate(6.3lbs to be exact).........................OK,bye.(0_0)
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My 4 grand children said it is their favorate games.  7 year old couldn't t play but enjoyed swirling the monkey around the 9 & 10 year Ole's had no trouble with it. I think it's good because there is a lot of spelling In the game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game . It is so much fun I play it all the time<br /><br />I absolutely love this game. I play it all the time.it is so fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1451629192|3.0|could have been more thorough of an account. it seems as if she somewhat sugarcoated the true horror of it. it was ok.
0544104404|2.0|Paul Tough's _How Children Succeed_ is getting much press, especially after it appeared on Bill Gates's reading list for summer 2013. For those of us who are parents and want our children to succeed, this book and all the hype that has come with it makes it seem as if someone has found the magic formula to success, and we'll finally know how to help the next generation become one.<br /><br />Or so you'd think.<br /><br />Author Tough tries to walk the same path of Malcom Gladwell by giving us a nonfiction title that combines the same elements that made Gladwell's books bestsellers. We get some science, some sociology, some mini-profiles of people who are trying to make a difference, some mini-profiles of children who are trying to succeed against the odds, and we get some pontificating about what the author thinks works to help children succeed. At one point, we even get the author referencing Gladwell's book _Outliers_.<br /><br />What becomes obvious by the midway point of _How Children Succeed_ is that Tough is no Gladwell. Merely mashing up all those elements doesn't give you a book that delivers anything. Fact is, you'd probably be better off reading _Outliers_.<br /><br />The reasons why this book's bits fail to congeal into anything useful are numerous:<br /><br />1. The title is misleading. The book looks mostly at how children in poverty assisted by government agencies and for-profit, entrepreneurial, educational \\"pseudo-charities\\" can get a boost if those agencies and pseudo-charities spend lots of money.<br /><br />2. The book contrasts poor children and rich children, but it doesn't really have anything to say about the children of the rest of us. How do middle class children succeed? The rich succeed because they're rich and probably always will be because they can buy their way through the hoops of success. Meanwhile, poor children succeed because some better-off people with fancy educational degrees swoop in to try all their latest educational techniques on them, some of which actually have to do with talking about discipline and perseverance.<br /><br />3. The book attempts to dismantle the idea that IQ and smarts are the determining factors for success by replacing them with discipline and perseverance. Problem is, the anecdotal science here doesn't really address what happens when both IQ AND discipline and perseverance are combined.<br /><br />4. Is anyone really surprised that applying oneself and working hard will improve the chances for success? Do we need a book to tell us this? Could we just stop at the title and save ourselves the time to read the whole book?<br /><br />5. The book includes the word \\"curiosity\\" in the subtitle as one of the elements of success, but you'd be hard pressed to find the author unpacking truths about curiosity in the book. They simply are not there.<br /><br />6. Author Tough is always tossing around numbers to make his case, but what about the numbers that don't make his case? And there are many. Why do so many children NOT respond to the ideas he tries to justify? Is it always because they failed to have grit, curiosity, and character? Or are other factors holding them back? We'll never know.<br /><br />7. Parents looking for help in raising their kids will struggle to make anything of the vague conclusions of the book. _How Children Succeed_ is more aimed at professional educators, which seems something of a chain yank. In addition, author Tough does a terrible job synthesizing his premises into anything useful. How do the typical middle-class parents apply anything in this book? How do you instill grit, curiosity, and character into your child? You won't find out by reading this book.<br /><br />8. Author Tough includes his own story of repeatedly dropping out of Ivy League and other respected colleges and ultimately never finishing. OK, so what are we to learn from that? How does that fit with the title and premise of the book? In fact, what are we to make of ANY of thestories of real people in this book? The educators are all over the place in how they address their charges. And the kids are just kids. What do any of these stories tell us beyond their feel-good (or feel-bad) outcomes? And even those positive outcomes are in question because most of them haven't been written fully yet; much of the presumed success is still in process by the book's conclusion and may yet fail.<br /><br />9. And lastly, the killer issue. For all that _How Children Succeed_ promotes as elements of success for children, it perpetually dances around the one element that does more than anything else to improve a child's future: having a stable, responsible, involved father at home as part of a married mother and father relationship. We can suspect the reason this most powerful of all influences is not mentioned is because it doesn't fit the new \\"family\\" mold being foisted on society by the pseudo-intellectuals who run the sorts of educational programs featured in _How Children Succeed_. Frankly, this omission verges on cowardly, because more than anything else, having a solid man at home married to their mother will greatly improve the lot of the kids featured in this book. Period. End of story. At yet nothing is said about this. Rather than addressing the terrible outcome of men distancing themselves from their kids (whether by walking away completely, by workaholism, or by letting paid professionals raise their kids for them), why not fix the source problem of these absent, disinterested fathers? How about stopping government incentives that foster broken families? How about working to get men to start acting like men and show some responsibility?<br /><br />_How Children Succeed_ fails so spectacularly that it's hard to understand all the positive reviews. All that can be surmised is that people no longer can discern when they are being manipulated by so-called facts and heartstring-tugging stories. As someone with a degree in a field of education, I'm used to hearing bold claims for ways to better outcomes. Perhaps I'm used to questioning those claims. Truthfully, others should be more questioning too.stories of real people in this book? The educators are all over the place in how they address their charges. And the kids are just kids.

B00746O3X8|2.0|i bought this vest hoping I would be able to go hands free, but as it turns out I had to keep at least one hand free every time I hooked up the camera to the latch... the camera would loosen and fall from the bracket. if the vest didn't have the secondary leash on the camera, I would have lost more than one camera to damage.  there has to be some way to more securely attach the camera to the small screwed pin on the bottom.  not sure anyone else has a better way but at least I didn't lose a lot of money on this one.
B000002KIE|5.0|this is still the real deal. punk came and went. some bands are still trying to keep it alive but the time and sound is hard to duplicate. the sex pistols came out of the gate rocking (and spitting).this cd will transport you back to another place and time.

B00005614N|3.0|This collection certainly has its moments- Louis's soloing on Cottontail being the best, but Ellington proves to be much less affective as a pianist than as a bandleader and Barney Bigard is somewhat unidimensional in his solos. Armstrong's vocal on \\"I Got It Bad\\" is forgettable. You can hear these guys better elsewhere.
B00CRMWMZ0|3.0|If you heard the funky electronica of Get Lucky and liked that one, it might be more worth getting just a few of the individual songs. I particularly liked Get Lucky, along with Give Life Back to Music, The Game of Love, Giorgio by Moroder, Within, Instant Crush, and Doin' It Right. I found both the beginning of Touch and most of Contact to be very jarring and dissonant . The rest of the tracks I haven't listened to in a while, but I recall that most of them had a great groove with a modicum of random noise. I really wanted this to be the kind of album I could listen to all the way through, but there is nonetheless some pretty good music on it.

B00D3VG7SM|5.0|It should be stated at the outset, that this recording is not, and does not presume to be, one comparable to those of Serafin and Callas and the like.  To compare this recording to older ones like Serafin's would be as futile as comparing Klemperer's St. Matthew Passion to that of John Butt's.  Rather, it is acknowledged by the artists and by the accompanying materials that the present recording attempts to do something novel for this opera -- replicate *as closely as possible* the forces and practices that Bellini might have intended.  Gone are the large forces with rounded sound quality, and voices having to project over them past their healthy limits.  Norma was, after all, written only four years after the death of Beethoven.  Norma is temporally closer to classical performance practice than later showpieces calling for the innovations of Boito and Verdi, for which greater pressures on the voice were required.  It is time for the works of Bellini to be put in context, which is what Bartoli and Antonini attempt here.  The differences which are reflected from this are not only inherent, but intentional.<br /><br />This recording was always bound to open a Pandora's Box of operatic politics.  Praising this recording is not mutually exclusive with disrespecting the exalted status of Callas's.  It would be like praising new recordings of Bach's keyboard works on harpsichord, while having to discount musical giants like Glenn Gould who recorded the same works on a modern piano.  Rather, it is probably most useful to take this recording of Norma and examine it according to its own merits.  After all, nothing like it has been done before (though, notably, Callas herself used smaller, more intimate forces for her recording of Norma.)<br /><br />Orchestra La Scintilla provides expert period accompaniment here.  While some critics question the orchestra's relatively extreme dynamics (as compared to the rounded sound of a modern orchestra), this quality is precisely one that that makes a baroque or classical orchestra distinctive.  The thinner gut strings which produce a clearer line, the woodwinds which are capable of a clearer, more reedy, less hollow tone, are capable of producing sudden dynamic changes that modern instruments cannot produce.  It is a quality that in some ways compensates for the reduced forces.  Not to say the sound is anemic -- quite the contrary.  The sound is always full, and under the baton of Antonini, La Scintilla's playing is always dynamic and forward-thrusting.  The tempi chosen give new insight into the compositional qualities of the work.  Take, for example, the last minute or so of the overture where the ostinato strings pulsate over sustained chords played by the woodwinds; a relatively faster tempo here, though not too brisk, brings out the melody in the woodwinds and an almost Mozartian quality to the strings which support them.  In other recordings that take this section at a much slower pace, such qualities are muddled and the structure is clouded.<br /><br />Cecilia Bartoli is not Callas.  Bartoli does not presume to be Callas.  Bartoli attempts to do honor to the role's creator, Giuditta Pasta who, by contemporary accounts of her voice, was probably a strong mezzo-soprano.  In doing this, Bartoli does an amazing and memorable job.  She ranks as one of my favorite modern Normas to-date (remembering importantly that Giuditta Pasta was not Maria Callas either.)  We can argue opera politics again over whether or not Giuditta Pasta was or was not a mezzo-soprano, but on this recording's own merits, Bartoli has offered us a characterization of Norma that is believable: angry, conflicted, remorseful, all rolled into one fiendishly difficult role.<br /><br />Sumi Jo as Adalgisa was wisely chosen.  The clearness of her voice is a stark contrast to Bartoli's darker texture, a wonderful representation of the younger priestess for whom the older Norma is scorned.  One of the high-points in this entire recording is their duet in Act II, reminiscent of Bartoli's performance with Natalie Dessay in Mozart's Mitridate.  The clarity and control is very good, and passages where the two women sing in thirds are oftentimes ravishing.<br /><br />John Osborn as Pollione is less of a standout than the women, but he executes his role very well.  Much has been said of the singers being \\"smaller voices,\\" Osborne's above all.  But that was the point.  The call for reduced forces, with the realization of Bellini's likely performance practices, and notice of the appropriate limits for the human voice (refer to the liner notes) in relation to the evolving size of the orchestras, was an essential consideration when making this recording, rather than a mistake or pretextual justification for shortcoming.<br /><br />There is much to recommend here.  It is decidedly a different take on an old bel canto classic, but it is far from taking huge liberties from Bellini's intentions.  This recording is one that pleases open ears (and perhaps those interested in musicology and period performance), opera politics aside.ding is their duet in Act II, reminiscent of Bartoli's performance with Natalie Dessay in Mozart's Mitridate.

PIctures the gorgeous Ms Khoo going about  everyday life - market, coffee etc. So it is a pleasant coffee table book.<br />The recipes are all easy, simple and elegant. I have impressed already. The fact that she makes them in her authentic little kitchen takes the intimidation out of cooking French. And she uses commonly available ingredients, and provides easy to do recipes for the basic as in Creme Patisserie . So it is a good cook book also.<br />Nicely produced and attractive to read. A very good buy!

B00E5UEA4I|5.0|Unfortunately for many artists, quite often the best art comes out of very painful life events.  In the space between KT's last album and this release, her father died and she divorced her husband. It's clear that KT has channeled whatever clarity she has gained regarding mortality and heartache into this album. Musically it strips much of the production of her last album out, which leaves just KT and her guitar with minimal touches of other instruments. It's reflexive, meditative, and melancholic, yet not without moments of hope.<br /><br />This album though probably her best, will also probably do the worst commercially. It's exchanging of big radio singles for bare instrumentation is a brave artistic choice, which I believe pays off in the end for the listener. The real power of this album is KT's pairing of her words with her music. Often, it seems skilled lyricists simply come up with music just because they have to--and it only serves to showcase the lyrics. And then the majority of radio singles disregard lyrics all together, and the focus is on the feeling of the music. KT was able to write both lyrics and music though that work in harmony to convey the same message--same tone--same feeling. I do recommend listening to this album only when you have time to really listen to it. The nuances will likely be lost in a hurried rush through, it needs focused attention to be appreciated.<br /><br />\\"Made of Glass\\" a song she wrote after the death of a dear friend, is an album standout. Understated and fragile, it's clear that KT has been grappling with thoughts of the afterlife for some time. Her father had Parkinson's for about two years before dying in a bike accident, and unsurprisingly mortality and how this relates to how we live our lives is a big theme of this album. \\"Feel It All\\" both the acoustic as well as band version included on the deluxe edition are mesmerizing. \\"You made my branches grow/Now they can play in the wind/And they can carry the snow\\" KT softly lilts.<br /><br />This album carries a double name as it is really two different albums, though each side compliments each other. This is due to KT recording the two different sides in two sessions, one in early April 2012, and the latter half in November of 2012 with each session having a different theme given KT's dealing with tremendous life changes in the space in between. If you've gotten a little bored with the first half, know that KT kicks it up a little on the back half. Howe Gelb co-wrote, co-produced and served as a backup vocalist for this album which I found a little unusual but welcome. KT is Scottish, but it seemed that I could almost hear the Arizona desert through Gelb's influence on this album. She recorded reel to reel, so all in one take and all live which I think really suits this stripped vulnerable style.<br /><br />If you're only a fan of the \\"rockstar\\" KT and were looking for some upbeat folky pop, then this is not the album for you. However, if a minimal and honest KT sounds good--then buy this album immediately. For fans of artists in the vein of Cat Stevens, Norah Jones, Missy Higgins and Laura Marling.ftly lilts.<br /><br />This album carries a double name as it is really two different albums, though each side compliments each other.

B005LAII4E|4.0|I will never understand my fellow moviegoers and critics. When you go see a movie like GI Joe, what exactly does one expect to see? While, I only saw it once, I walked away from it actually loving the heck out of it. Yes, I recognize that from a pure craft standpoint the movie was seriously flawed. But I don't go to a GI Joe movie looking for craft. I go looking to be entertained, to watch a cartoon that I loved as a kid brought to life and see the property be treated with a modicum of respect. On that basis the first GI Joe delivered everything that I wanted.  But the movie was a critical and (I thought, apparently wrong, Box Office failure) so I was shocked and pleasantly surprised to find that a sequel was in the works.<br /><br />This movie delivered just about everything that I would want out of a GI Joe movie. The weapons were futuristic and advanced enough to put a smile on my face, yet remain \\"realistic\\" enough where I would go, yes - I totally buy into the idea that Cobra \\"Bats\\" (Helicopters with convertible Jet Engines) were possible, or that Firefly's (Ray Stevenson) swarm of miniature exploding robot fireflies could be real.<br /><br />I like that, like the cartoon, the balance between Cobra and the Joes are maintained. In the Cartoon Cobra is usually winning the battle for most of the episode until some key mistake or bit of arrogance by Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) ruins the plan. In Retaliation it isn't arrogance that ultimately brings the plan down, it is actually the intelligence of The Joes sorting out what is going on and what happened.  In many ways Retaliation is a very \\"logical\\" procedural movie disguised as popcorn action.<br /><br />I'm not saying there aren't ridiculous moments, like the over the top cliff battle with Snake Eyes (Ray Park), his protégé Jinx (Elodie Yung), a literally wrapped up Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) and a whole bunch of Ninjas. Great, fun stuff.  The movie missed mightily with the god awful, comical presence of (RZA) as the Blind Master or surprisingly Bruce Willis as the original Joe - Commander Joe Colton. He just didn't seem interested in what he was doing and his character was annoyingly condescending.<br /><br />Dwayne Johnson continues to have a great year, this time as the popular character Roadblock.  Johnson never really acts all that differently in films, but he certainly has the charm and presence to make almost anything he does work. He manages to be able to poke fun at himself and those around him, without ever destroying his credibility as the resident \\"tough\\" guy.  I loved the rest of this cast, Adrianne Palicki was great as Lady Jaye, Jonathan Pryce was fun as the fake version of himself as President. At times I really did think he was Zartan (Arnold Vosloo).<br /><br />Director Jon M. Chu does a nice job of keeping the movie flowing, evenly paced and most of the action scenes are well staged with no shaky cam and everything was easy to follow. The screenplay by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick was solid. I really don't understand the vitriolic reaction some people have for this movie.It is a summer popcorn flick, not everything has to be a serious deconstruction of a post apocalyptic future. Sure, if you overthink this movie, you could find flaws - but that's the case with any piece of entertainment. Enjoy it for what it is, not what you think it should be. It is one of my top 10 favorites of 2013.<br /><br />Presentation, Audio, Video<br /><br />From the top level you can select whether you want to be a Joe or a member of Cobra. The presentation layer changes based on your selection for Joes you get blues and clips of Joes for your screensaver while the Cobra layer is draped in red and includes clips of Cobra. Obviously the Cobra layer is the cooler one.  The disc comes in standard jewel case packaging with a 3D slipcase. There are 3 discs - 3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD version. All the extras are on the Blu-ray Disc. Have I said recently how much this annoys me?I really like having the 3D and 2D movie on the same disc.<br /><br />I wasn't a fan of the 3D in the theater, but, as usual, in a home environment on my nice Vizio Passive 55 incher the 3D is fairly solid, can't really complain about it. The 2D version is even better and sharper thanks to the 1080p transfer. I'm still and will never be a fan of letter boxed widescreen - I have a 55-inch tv, fill that puppy up!  The 7.1 Dolby TrueHD audio was nice, although it seemed like most of the audio mix was on the front center track and didn't make a lot of use of the rear channels.<br /><br />Audio tracks include - French/Spanish/Portuguese Dolby Digital 5.1 HD, English Audio Description. Subtitles are in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese<br /><br />Extras<br /><br />  Previews<br />  Full length Commentary by Director Jon M. Chu<br />  G.I. Joe: Declassified - 8 Featurettes that cover the making of the movie and total over one hour<br />  Deleted Scenes - 3 Scenes that total about 4 mins.<br />  DigitalUV - is both iTunes and Ultraviolet compatible (I wish more studios do this - I'm looking at YOU Disney!)<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />I don't care what anyone says, I love this movie. On first blush it seems like there are no extras on this disc, look deeper and you'll see it includes a full Commentary, basically a 1 hour documentary that covers all aspects of making this movie and a Digital Copy for both iTunes and Ultraviolet. As a fan of the movie, I really can't complain too much about this release. It is solid.<br /><br />Grades<br /><br />  Movie - B<br />  Audio/Video - B+<br />  Extras - B<br /><br />Final Overall Grade - B+

B00B69UQEO|5.0|This is one moody album! If your looking for a bunch of radio pop hits, then this may not be for you! This is my favorite Depeche Mode album and I've been listening to them since the 80's. Although it still retains some pop elements as in Violator, it's darker, emotional and the sound quality is excellent. The album contains a good use of bass and synth, just a great mix and excellent songwriting. There are a few songs I don't like as much as others but the songs I love are so good I have to give five stars. If you have a good stereo to listen to it with, it really rocks. Some of my favorite tracks are \\"Broken\\" and \\"Welcome to My World.\\" I didn't have high expectations for this album but it is really great. I've been listening to it for a few weeks and it just gets better. Do yourself a favor and pick this up!
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone!!!  It is a great movie!  It was filmed in small towns in Arkansas; Dumas,<br />Back Gate, Pendleton, DeWitt, Stuttgart, & Crocketts Bluff.  The bar scene in this movie is filmed in my bar, Gail's Sports Bar at Back Gate, located 6 miles East of Dumas.  I got to meet Reese Witherspoon during the filming of the movie.  That was very cool!!!  My sister, brother, dad, nephew and a few friends are in this movie!!

The whole entire book is a thought experiment of what might have happened to the Swede the main character of the book after a highly traumatic event.  This book could have been at least a hundred pages shorter and been a better book as a result.

I really liked the body of the movie, but I didn’t really like how it ended.

Bo is a succubus and has no allegiance to the Light or Dark Fae (every Fae is supposed to pick a side).  Bo creates her own detective agency with best friend Kenzie, and the show is about their cases and how they fit into the Fae world.  If you love Syfy and are a nerd like me, you will love this show!
B00AKFG15S|4.0|Could not wait to read the third part of the Clifton Chronicles and whilst I really did enjoy it felt that it was not quite as good as the previous two - mind you will still look forward to Part 4.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|This is the second set of DVD'S I have ordered & I have had no problems!  I love the service, I got them when promised, & they were perfect! Will be ordering season 4 soon! ♡♥♡♥♡♥
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A book that creates empathy and compassion for the complexity of family connections, the rich history of Afghanistan and the challenges faced by characters you will learn to love.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Amazing Movie. QT is a monster!!! and the picture quality is incredible. I dont know if anything gets better than this flick right now.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Thought this was a fun game......looking forward to more rooms! This is a great game for kids looking to be challenged or for adults just wanting to disconnect for awhile.
1863514260|5.0|I am \\"color challenged\\" and needed a book to understand combining colors in a way beyond or different than putting a color wheel in front of me.  This book has helped me in other areas besides needlework, which is what I purchased it for.  It has helped me understand and effectively choose complimentary color combinations for our home, which include wall paint, furniture and accessories.  I have even used the well explained principles in my personal clothes shopping.  But the most helpful outcome of reading and studying this book has been the confidence I now hold to make those color choices in so many areas!<br /><br />The book is amply supplied of picture illustrations...like an over stuffed stocking at Christmas.  I wasn't left wanting.  My favorite \\"principle\\" was learning about how light and angles of light will change the colors and how they will in tgurn affect other colors.  Buy this book and it will be one of the best investments you have made as it can be applied to everything that has color.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I am absolutely loving my life proof case.  I purchased my life proof to replace a falling apart Otter Box.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie has everything I like in a western. Lots of action, plus some good humor,along with a good storyline. I loved it! Excellent acting also!
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|The jeans fit well and the length was good, I have long legs. However, they were not comfortable.  I found the material to be &#34;rough&#34; and not what I want from a jegging.<br /><br />I love Calvin's, just not this pair.  Sorry:(  I returned them.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|It feels wonderful to finally have a CD of Leonard Cohen.  It arrived very quickly, and I have started wearing it out already.  There is a wonderful feeling listening to his voice and this music.
B00BMGUIJE|5.0|Where do I start, I order this awesome figure and it came in 3 days, that's what I call fast! The detail on this is absolutely amazing, this figure is absolutely flawless, I love it. I recommend it to every OP fan :)
B003E48AYC|5.0|I love this movie it's the best. It's a little dark but I love it. It's my favorite Alice in Wonderland!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|i was playing at first and it was great but then it stared to crash messed my whole game it didnt ruin my kindle but it ruined the whole APP!!! get it if you wanna have fun for a few weeks or a month but then its done they should really fix that
B006ID01OS|4.0|A great read and wonderful book!<br />I would keep this book on my leadership shelf always!<br />It has help me understand the intent behind a &#34;Strategist&#34;
B0064X7FVE|1.0|As many have noted, the recent changes have made this app more annoying than useful. Much functionality has been moved to the point of being hidden. I have replaced this app with Weatherbug,but am watching to see if they fix this.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|What ther to say?  It Izzy and he is the best at his mucis.  This is a wonderful CD to own.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|I loved it. Amazing truly amazing please buy the book you'll love it. Makes me smile every time I read it.
B00CZAYNOC|3.0|The Good: Lift Me Up, I.M. Sin, and Dot Your Eyes are three of my favorite songs off of this album. Catchy riffs, driving bass, and a really upbeat pace makes these songs stand out. Anywhere But Here (Feat. Maria Brink) is a fantastic duet that is also one of my favorite tracks. Moody's growls and singing works perfectly with Maria's and Rob Halford's, creating two very unique songs that are somewhat of a departure from 5FDP's signature, but they work perfectly. I.M. Sin and Dot Your Eyes are a little more in the traditional vein, but they are great songs to rock out to.<br /><br />The Bad: I've seen plenty of albums that include remixes of their songs as bonus tracks, but I can't say I've ever seen one where the song was basically left intact, with the guest appearance singing only one verse, and then still including the original song on the album as well! Although I love I.M. Sin and Dot Your Eyes, the addition of Max Cavalera and Jamey Jasta don't do anything at all for the songs, in large part because their voices don't really sound that much different from Moody's. If you are going to bring in a guest, it's important they add something to the song that wasn't there before (such as Anywhere But Here). Brink's voice makes that song far more varied and interesting that without her (as we can hear a few tracks earlier). Honestly, it took me two or three times of a quick playthrough before I even realized how those two tracks differed from the original. That's very unfortunate and a missed opportunity. Other songs such as M.I.N.E., Watch You Bleed, and Wrong Side of Heaven are decent tracks. There's nothing really wrong with them, but they aren't very memorable and only have moments where they are really interesting. Serviceable, but more mediocre filler tracks than a line-up a heavy hitters.<br /><br />The Ugly: You, Burn MF, and Mama Said Knock You Out are some of the most repetitive songs I have ever heard (with special emphasis on Burn MF). I get that MSKYO is acover, but these songs really take away from the album rather than adding to it. There's not much else to say about these.<br /><br />Overall, the album is a bizarre mix of songs. You have absolutely fantastic songs, ones that are pretty good, and ones that are just terrible. I'm not sure if making it into a Vol.1/2 set was a way to get people to buy two albums for one albums worth of good songs, but it's sure shaping up to be that. We'll see what Vol. 2 brings, and I'll give 5FDP the benefit of the doubt, but this was a bit of a letdown. Especially after Stone Sour set the bar as to what a 2-disc album set should be. So yes, I've listened to several of the tracks a dozen or more times now, but in a month or two, I'll only have three/four songs from here that will continue to survive in my playlists. That warrants three stars.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I love these kind of puzzlers which aims at giving you a nice quality brain tuner.<br />This can be taken up anytime...play for a while and then continue with your work.<br /><br />Each stage is unique and checks more of your reflex and planning.
B000021Y77|5.0|Loved this movie. Ordered and received it with no problems whatsoever. Happy with the product. Bought it as a present for someone and it was quite successful in pleasing him.
1616550414|5.0|This is an awesome item that every Zelda fan MUST have. The book was a bit bigger and heavier than expected, which made it better looking to me because the artwork can be nicely appreciated. The paper used and hard cover are super high quality as well as the printing. There are so many things to see and read within it's contents that you'll need days too completely look at it and won't mind taking a peek after some time.
0767812166|5.0|Well, it's a classic, you know. I loved it the first time I saw it back in the eighties. And you get to see a naked young Jeff Bridges from behind as a bonus, lol. So, I ordered it, received it quickly, watched it and found the product quality good and still as enjoyable as it was originally. So, happy me.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is a great movie to help gain some insight on what it might be like to be autistic or interact with someone that is. Autism is so variable and each individual expresses it so differently. Temple Grandin is so successful and she has amazing support from her family and friends. This movie gives an insight to some possibilities. I found it fascinating. Obviously she is very intelligent.
0553801473|5.0|What more can I say? I am a big fan. I love the book. I can't wait for the next one to come out. The book came to me in good condition and very promptly.
B00COCY67A|5.0|This is another lovingly compiled collection of Elvis's 70s recordings at the great Stax studio. Critically dismissed at the time of their original release, these songs put Elvis in one of the great rock and roll studios ever and use a mixture of Elvis's guys and Stax greats to record a typically diverse group of songs including rock, pop, country, blues and gospel. As with all of Elvis's 70s recordings, they were surprisingly uncommercial for American radio of the day, with just a few songs clearly designed to be singles (Raised on Rock the best example), which showed that Elvis had stopped trying to make hits and just recorded songs he liked. The result is an collection that shows that Elvis could still shine when he liked the material as he clearly did at Stax. It's Midnight, Honkey Tonk Angel, and Loving Arms are great country songs. If that Isn't Love is a classic Elvis gospel. And then there's Promised Land, the greatest recording of one of Chuck Berry's great songs, a song that showed what Elvis was still- capable of doing with quality rock material.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I don't know why it took me so long to see this movie, but it was fantastic! The minions are so cute and the characters are very lovable. Not as predictable as other animated films. Definitely worth watching!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|First things first - Downton Abbey is a soap opera. The quick cuts, the large cast, the intertwined plots. But somehow it seems so much classier than most other soaps. The cast is excellent and the story, while predictable, is very entertaining. Can they keep this up in season 4?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is a fun way to learn how to take care of your own horse(s).<br />It is a NaturalMotion Games Limited.
B007LYB4BC|3.0|I like the music/songs here. My issue is with the recording and production. It seems they were going for a certain type of old school sound. It sounds like a mono record. To me. this is the biggest mistake. I would have enjoyed it so much more if there was a wide soundstage that didn't put all of the musicians in a single focalpoint. The other result of this is that it is &#34;in your face&#34;. This will make this record, one that I doubt will get much play in my system. What a waste.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book! It's just amazing read. I could have finished this book in less than 24 hours but really wanted the story to last, so I paced myself. It is very moving to get the insight of life through Charlie's perspective. He thinks of life so deeply that it's honestly hard not to get lost (not literally) in his thoughts. It's a great read and I highly recommend it! <3
B006LXQID8|5.0|There is so much to this movie.. I see something new everytime I watch it. The quirky characters make it very entertaining, yet it also has a deep message.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a very cool game. Once you start playing it you can not stop. Can not wait to see the movie
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVED the previous version. I was all upset when they updated it. Can you please bring it back. Don't &quot;fix&quot; what ain't broke!!
B004UID2LC|1.0|I cant think of anything good to say about this app. You can't search for videos, even if you can, I couldn't find an option that should be right there. The page design is lazy and unappealing, it is hard to find certain videos with the format, and it is just a waste of memory. Don't buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|THIS APP IS SO F******** STUPID IT HAS NO PURPOSE TO IT WHAT SO Ever mane you or whoever plays this app should just play temple runnor something
B00CWGLOY6|4.0|I haven't read comics in a long time so don't have enough to compare it to, but Saga is a witty, funny story that combines enough science fiction with medieval style magic to make it creatively delightful. The story continues to surprise, and foreshadows the saga started by a Romeo and Juliette love affair that will bring peace to a warring universe (that's my assumption at least).
B00CNBS5XS|5.0|this product was absolutely AMAZING! the product was perfectly priced with that wonderful 0.10 cents per piece.<br />despite the long delivery time the product was amazing!<br />BAZINGA!
B0076DCT2G|1.0|This is the first book read by this author and was very disappointed.  I can not believe all the good reviews.  I guess others like the smart-alec main character.  It became tedious at best.  Never again!
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|Gameloft has done it again! This game is much better than Rio, and has MUCH better graphics. This game is worth the price. Buy it! I rate 5 stars. Thanks, Gameloft.
0446547654|5.0|HAVE READ EVERYONE OF HIS BOOKS.  LOVE HIS WRITING. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK THAT COMES OUT IN SEPTEMBER.
B00E193TM2|5.0|PERFECT CD TO PUT IN  CAR  ON DRIVE HOME FROM WORK AFTER A BAD DAY AT WORK KICKS ASS.THEIR BEST ONE YET.CANT WAIT TO C IF THEY CAN TOP IT WITH PART 2.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|its a great game with well made grafics I rate it 5 stars because its challenging but not too easy ot hard
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series gets better every season!<br />Maggie Smith has the best one liner zingers.<br />So happy this was offered on Amazon Prime!!
B008A36R2Y|5.0|Works well to emulate keyboards.  It took me a little while to get the code just right for my project, but this was my first time using Arduino.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|We play as a family and challenge one another who can get the most coins in one run. We always have fun with this game.
B00C8985DU|5.0|This set, is also a great vault of memories, and it's incredible how the shows of Sir Paul didn't change all these years, the same list of songs, and the great memories he revive in our hearts with his songs and the ones from the Beatles as well.....<br />It's a must have for a respectable Beatle fan........!!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|the eagles farewell tour dvd was very enjoyable because it shows most of there hit songs bring sung on film
B009ZG6YPU|5.0|I must admit that this book is incredible, one of the finest I have read in a long time. A must read!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used the Weather Channel app daily for the.past 2 years.  After using the new app for a week.or so I became so frustrated that I removed it and loaded a competitor.  You ruin a nice app with greed and poor software design.
B00CSJYYO4|4.0|Un libro que ayuda a encontrar el camino a la felicidad....a no pasar por este mundo sin aprender a valorar el significado de «vivir».
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I first got this game because it was free, planning on playing it once or twice and then removing it from my Kindle. That was several months ago. I have played it several times daily since then, and I can only say it is a great game.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Not what I was expecting at first, but a fun way to pass time.  I like that it's not timed, so I can walk away if I need to and take care of something else.  Great if you like finding hidden objects.
1594746036|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It wasn't at all what I expected it to be. I love the strangeness of it; it's has just the right amount of paranormal and the characters are very real, even though they are extremely unusual. The ending kind of left me up in the air, but I was glad to see there is a book that follows it because I can imagine all the wonderful adventures these children will have. The only thing that left me a little uneasy was how easily the dad was duped at the end. I can't imagine not going crazy if my child were to do what Jake did, but it did fit the story and after all, Jake was much more like his grandfather than his father.<br /><br />I would totally recommend this book. Great read!!
B0061S0A64|4.0|I don't play with it, but my 2 & 4 year old girls think it's pretty and fun to play with.
B00ANDPGJE|5.0|I really enjoyed this &#34;mini-series,&#34; first produced about 20-25 years ago.  Several great British actors of the time, put their &#34;heart and soul&#34;  in acting out their character.  I highly recommend &#34;House of Cards.&#34;  I recently purchased the 2012/13 United States production with the same title.  It is brilliantly acted by Kevin Spacey as the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives.  This version has been nominated for a &#34;2013 Emmy Award.&#34; I  strongly recommend purchasing this current version as well.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love that this app lets you customize the exact mixture of sounds you want. I also like that there's no distinguishable loop that is so distracting in other white noise apps.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|This album is going to be listened to frequently in both my home and in my car.  Paul once again provides an excellent vocal performance on  all tracts.  I highly recommend it to &#34;Pop&#34; fans anywhere in the world.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I think Mr. Quick over did it just a little on the football side. That kind of drove me nuts with all the Hank Baskett and AAAAAAHHHHH Eagles. I don't know how the chant goes thank goodness. Even though I read that chant I refused to let my mind picture them doing it. I thought about humming and skipping 10 lines every time I saw Eagles. As you can tell I'm not an Eagles fan. The story is gripping pulls you in even if you don't like the Eagles it might get a little annoying but you got to look for the silver lining. I liked how Pat view his life as a movie and most of the book take place during his apart time. He's working on bettering himself so he could have his silver lining. I think that is what kept me reading I wanted to see if Pat got his silver lining. Overall very enjoyable read.
006220629X|3.0|This novel is not as good as Watcher in the Shadows but it gives a backstory to some of the characters from Watcher in the Shadows.  Worth the time.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Star Wars has been in the far reaches of my mind since I was a little kid.  It showed the same story we've all heard, but brought us somewhere different.  And when good guys defeat bad guys with a well-placed proton torpedo, climaxing with a triumphant exploding space station, you've got my little kid attention again and again.  Not so much for the cuddly Ewoks.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I was swept right into this tale of horror. Bram Stoker is truly a master.
B002DQFHKM|5.0|Not all &#34;HEAVY METAL&#34; but still a very good soundtrack nonetheless ... Of particular note is Nicko McBrains band Trust...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best minion game around. I wouldn't mind paying money for this application it is great for all ages that love the movies and these unforgettable minions.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I had to revisit this program all because of a dream that I time traveled and talked to MYSELF when I was about oh, 12 or 13.  She told me that she was watching Twin Peaks and I told her something like, \\"Remember, Bob is scary!\\"  Cause I really did watch the show when it was on.  Bob scared the crap out of me.  The story of my time travel dream is on my blog [...]  and the post is titled, \\"Time Travel IS Possible!\\"  My husband and I have completed the series and celebrated with a big plate of donuts and some coffee :)  Bob doesn't scare me anymore but I think he scared my husband hahaha  Now that we have finished it, we are kinda sad that it's all over.  Laura said she would see Agent Cooper in 25 years.  That time is approaching....crossing my fingers that David Lynch gives us all something similar to watch on tv.  He and Mark Frost wrote great stuff!!  I kept notes while watching the episodes.  I was not surprised to find many many synchronicities each night we watched that went along with the day I had or my life and what I believe.  I can happily say that Twin Peaks is one of my favorite shows of all time.  And I laughed my butt off at the SNL skit.  And we really enjoyed the \\"Slice of Lynch\\" piece.  :)
0439023521|5.0|I pretty much didn't put the book down once I started reading it. You almost can't.<br />I liked it a lot, even though it's a lot more violent than I would expect a young adult book to be.<br />Even so, it's a great book. I read it after I saw the movie, and I liked the movie a lot, but enjoyed the book even more.<br />Katniss is an easy heroine to root for, and I plan to read Catching Fire before it comes to theater.<br />I definitely understand why this book has caused such a sensation.
B0061S0A64|2.0|I'll give it 2 stars because it is fun when it works.... but it almost never works. Bugs, crashes, etc. Try again and try harder next time.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I liked his explanation of his vision and experience but found the medical jargon a little too much.  His family dynamics was interesting and his connection to his birth family was powerful.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I love the weather channel on my phone and on my Kindle. It is usually more accurate than our local news
B007EECSFA|3.0|I found it unbelievable that a woman could change her character do drastically until I came to the end. A good read.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great! Must see for any Sherlock Holmes fans. I really enjoy this series! My only complaint, the season is too short. I wish there were more episodes:)
B00BE97ONM|4.0|This book was very entertaining and hard for me to put down. I loved the emotional impact of the intense plot.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I have had the standard DVD of this movie for a couple of years and just recently realized I could up grade to Blu ray.  There is a big difference in Blu ray over DVD, even though my player is supposed to &#34;up scale&#34; the DVD to better quality.  It is really too bad that this franchise was discontinued.  Firefly was a great, original Sci fi series that I used to watch (or tried to watch until it was canceled).  The series went on to be a cult favorite and this movie was the result of fans putting pressure on the powers that &#34;be&#34; .  This is a really great Sci fi movie and series.  If you are a true Sci fi fan, this is a great movie.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I wish I read it before seeing the movie.  Well written.  Great plot.  The movie follows it closely as it is hard to improve on perfection.  Can't wait to see how this develops.  Starting book two right now.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time and I am not a reader of romances.  This one talks about feelings and the author is superb in describing the author's feelings.  I have recommended it to all of my friends.  Great read!
0375413405|5.0|I broke the bank buying these and it is as grand as the woman behind it and can be handed down for years
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I like mixing my own melodies. It is relaxing just to create them and since I like white noise this is so nice to take when staying away from home.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Good thing about this, is that it’s available in different colors.<br />And if you only have one controller, like any other wifi device that receives a lot of usage, you MUST get a second one so you could have on standby when the other runs out of juice.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I just wanted to rate it 5/5, but if I have to give it a review, I would say that it does what it is supposed to do without too many complex options or graphics.
B00CW665VI|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I loved how she referred to things going on in our generation. I can totally see some guy saying and thinking like Drew. I wish there was more to the story. I am hooked.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I like all , Jack Reeacher  book. They are very exciting. Lots of action. Mystery and  suspense. I have read them all.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Works great for my 8 year old! He loves that it is not bulky and is still protective! Will buy another one soon for my other child!
0345535421|5.0|More violence, illicit lust, warfare, &#34;he men&#34; being &#34;he men&#34;, fair damsels with a touch of black magic.  Great following book to Game of Thrones.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|Doesn't present the same challenge as the same game on my Ipad. In some ways it seems to be for a very young group of players.
B00A85EMVK|1.0|I started watching this when it arrived today.  First thing I noticed was that the picture was grainy, especially faces.<br /><br />Then I put in the Old DVD version I have... Not Blu ray by the way.  I used the 2D to 3D feature on my TV and the result was much better.<br /><br />I noticed when I bought the Shrek movies in 3D.  The first few were released before 3D was available and I noticed when I put the DVD in that my TV said 2D to 3D....<br /><br />If you think about it, how are they going to take a movie from the 80's way before 3D and Blu ray and make it a 3D Blu ray?  they cannot re film it so they have to manipulate it.<br /><br />I would save your money.... in the future I won't by a pre- 3D movie in 3D.  I'll just use the conversion feature on my TV if I want it.<br /><br />I hope this helps someone.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Have only played it once. Was glad to see the same challenge as the same game on my wife's Ipad.
B00DURILJ2|3.0|This movie was just an average movie and kept my attention for the most part.  Based on the stellar reviews from critics and the general populace alike, I had much higher expectations.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|All puzzles are very intricate, challenging, yet solvable if you are willing to spend some time really thinking them through.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loveee thee book. Please continue to write more. Please continue on from fifty shades darker. I want to know what happens next with Ana and Christian. Your my Favorite author!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I strongly suggest adding fire to the game because then people can set of TNT easily and burn down trees.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Got this as the FAOTD a while back, and the nag screen to rate came up today reminding me to tell you all that it is packed with just about evert timer function you can shake a stick at. And can you say customizable?  Yes it does. Fantastic app
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the game!! It's really fun my sister's watched the movie but I wasn't there get the game! It's really fun. I rated five stars. (:
B00BESM14U|5.0|OHMYGOSH<br />best movie ever! saw it 3 times and it was still awesome each time<br />my friends and I gathered in our basement with our decorated tissue boxes (for the sad scenes, or if her cat sat on our faces) and watched it

B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book hit home. My brother had bacterial meningitis at7 years old with ten days in a coma and also made a full recovery. The power of prayer is real.
0375812024|5.0|This book is about 10in by 10in, very thin paperback.  PERFECT for sticking in your carry-on for your child's plane trip.  My 20 month old son can spend hours with Cars and Trucks and Things That Go, so I knew he would love this one as well.  And he did.  Perfect way to keep him busy on his first flight.  Well, that and the toy airplane from a gift shop!
B002HWBS96|5.0|This was not for me, but was a Christmas gift for a friend.  She was delighted.  And, so am I.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|Despite its length I was unable to put the book down.<br />I am now eagerly awaiting book 4 of the Clifton Chronicles. I hope Mr Archer remains in good health.. ( I confess that the hope is selfish... )
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Honestly, I was skeptical about this game at first because a lot of movies that also have games are really bad... But this is completely DIFFERENT!!!!! My brother and I both like this game and I would definitely recommend this game!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Amazing weaved in lives over many decades, across many countries and cultures, the story was easy to be lost in. Hard to put down!

0385349947|5.0|I  enjoyed this book a lot.  Lean In has the flare of a biography, a lot of moments of being a self help book, with the power of being a full fledge feminist manifesto.<br /><br />But ,I would describe it mostly as a call of action to society who continues to undermine, underpay and under value the contribution that women bring to the workplace and to those who are afraid to disrupt the status quo.<br /><br />A call of action to women- to Lean In even if they want to fall back in order to move up.<br /><br />Many have criticize this book as blah blah from the elitist Harvard graduate whose degree entitled her to better career opportunities.  My response to that is so what?  Yes Harvard can open the door (We all know that )but it is still up to the woman to step in and have what it takes to stay.<br /><br />So don't dismiss this book as just another over privileged , elitist talking , read it and you will see that many points will resonate.<br /><br />For my full video review and other book reviews please visit PattysKiss on Youtube.<br /><br />http://youtu.be/ySuRLpXATMI
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This game was fun prior to the update. I would have rated it five stars before. But since the update I haven't been able to play. When I start up the app it gets to the loading screen and just stays there: loading, loading, loading, loading, loading, loading, loading, loading. I let it go for a whole hour and it never went past the loading screen. I guess since I can't play it anymore I should have given it zero stars. But it was fun when I could play it, so I gave it two stars.
0345803485|1.0|This book was released last year (and i just got around to wanting to read it) it has received extensive media attention and a lot of hype due to it's erotic content.  All I have to say after reading it is \\"ah\\"<br /><br />I was not shocked by the content, if anything I was shocked that people found it so scandalous. Apparently, I am the only one who enjoys reading free romance novels from Amazon,... now those are eye raising, steamy love scenes that makes you want to say \\"her legs are where? he is doing what?\\" \\"wait let me read that again\\" this like I said was \\"ah\\". The writing.... the bad writing and the character's lack of chemistry made those steamy scenes almost seem tame and it took way from what we should have be focusing on... the fact that Anastasia a naive, virginal 21 year old is over her head, in a world that is foreign to her, where she falls hard for Christian Grey, the 27 year old handsome and billionaire. who is literarily the master of that world. The concept was good, but it just never played out for me.<br /><br />Please visit PattysKiss on youtube for the full video review of this book and others.<br /><br />http://youtu.be/sZJ3K9pLz1E

B008200LHW|5.0|A GPS receiver with the SiRF 4 chip (a few dbm more sensitive than the SiRFstarIII) for less than $40. It works well with two Win7 laptops I've tried it with. You need to install software that converts one USB port to a COM (serial) port (software is included). Then plug it in, fire up your favorite navigation software, and make the necessary settings in that program. I've used it with two versions of MS Streets & Trips (2009 and 2013), plus DeLorme Topo North America. It locks on even in the house, through a roof. Faster outside, of course. I also have an older version of the same device, except with the SiRFstarIII chip. Both are a bargain.

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|if your into great drama, acting, story telling, suspense and of course, last but not least , zombies this show reigns supreme.<br />Their are some people who will never ever give this show a chance just because of the zombies, or will this show ever receive any Emmy Awards because of the walkers, but as far as I am concerned who cares, the ratings speak for themselves, and these people don't know what their missing , so \\" F \\" them.<br />This show is a drama first and horror TV series second. I thought the first 2 seasons were brilliant, and their wasn't to me 1 boring episode. Just seeing the individual characters slowly changing from episode to episode was interesting to me.<br />Some people or so-called fans of the show endlessly complain about season 2 on the farm being boring, these people seem to be more horror or action fans and must see 100% gore in every episode or they are just not happy. My suggestion to them is to go to the movies and watch Evil Dead, the horrible World War Z or whatever other rubbish Hollywood continues to crank out and pump millions of dollars into which virtually lack any story what so ever and are only made to create more CGI effects to hide the fact that THERE IS NO STORY.<br />I must admit that season 3 was only about 80% great and seemed to loose its way here and there, but now that they have a new show runner, Scott Gimple who wrote some of the best episodes in season 3, and after seeing TWD panel and a preview of season 4 at the 2013 Comicon convention I have total faith the show will be better than ever except for of coarse the constant complainers who endlessly blog about how bad the show has become but for some reason can't stop watching it.<br />Oh by the way, here's another suggestion, if you don't like the show then stop watching it, and shut the \\"F\\" up, or just stick to the comic book which this show does not follow and stop expecting it to be like the comic books.<br />Hail Odin!!!!!!!!!
B008XGW1CI|2.0|Perhaps Ms. Rowling had to write this novel to free herself of all the good in Harry Potter, but it is my belief that she should have never sent it to publication. To me it's like the letter you write when you are totally mad at someone, you write it but never send it.<br />I find it very difficult to believe that a whole community is without any saving grace as this book contends. Were it any other author than Ms.Rowling I would have put it down before 100 pages. Since it is her, I kept looking for a turn-around of some kind but none appeared.<br />As has been said before, there are more books written than you will ever be able to read, so this is one that should be skipped.

0375826742|3.0|The third installment of the Inheritance Cycle is better than the second, but suffers from the same chronic excessive details that plague the first two books. Whereas in \\"Eldest,\\" the story stalled in the middle with the several hundred page visit to the Elves for training, \\"Brissingr\\" stalls chapter after chapter with unnecessary scenes and excessive details that slow the pace of the story to a mind-numbing halt.<br /><br />I can see why the trilogy expanded to a four-book series of ever growing word count: Mr. Paolini doesn't know what's relevant to the story, or rather, the series became very popular and dragging out the story for the sake of creating a fourth book would be very profitable, even if it diminished the quality of his writing. It's like he's married to every single thought he's ever had about any of the characters and must include it in full detail. As a reader, I don't mind slogging through an epic series, but it's frustrating when each book of the series is 100 pages longer than the previous one, yet has 200 hundred pages less actual material. \\"Eragon\\" had short chapters, which prevented Mr. Paolini from dallying too long on any one scene. In \\"Eldest\\" and \\"Brissingr,\\" the chapters become longer and longer, but no additional content is introduced. As a result, scenes that should last for 5-7 pages last for 30-40, sometimes even 50 pages as he goes from one chapter to the next with the same irrelevant scene.<br /><br />In my opinion, Mr. Paolini has lost contact with Eragon's true nature. He begins to behave in ways that are irrational compared to the previous two books. We've gone from being lectured on privacy and vegetarianism to contemplating justice and religion. Eragon has been diminished to a puppet for Mr. Paolini's views on the world. Roran is implausibly perfect. In \\"Eldest,\\" I thought his plotline saved the story, but in \\"Brissingr,\\" his scenes were repetitive and too incredible to be believed. Roran is a cardboard cutout of the perfect hero, which makes him boring because I know he's going to survive every mission he's sent on. Newsflash: uncertainty = interesting; predictable = boring. Nasuada, who should be one of the most interesting characters in the story, is largely ignored. There should've been more conflict between her and managing the troops and keeping the army together, but it's glossed over. If the book were short and condensed, I would get over it if Mr. Paolini opted out of developing every character, but for a 748-page book, there's no excuse for neglecting a significant character. While we're on the subject of characters, Mr. Paolini introduces some of the most interesting side characters and then does absolutely nothing with them! Blodgharm (sp) arrived with a bang and then nothing. The werecats - nothing. Angela - nothing. Elva - minimal. Every single time I thought the book was about to get interesting, Mr. Paolini backed down from advancing the story and went off on some lengthy tangent.<br /><br />Minor plot spoiler:<br /><br />What was the purpose of spending 50 pages in the desert with Arya and Eragon towards the beginning of the book when Arya disappeared for the rest of the book without any indication their relationship would change or something interesting would happen in the final book? Stuff like this irritates me. There was absolutely no reason so many pages needed to be wasted on that scene. Then there was the never-ending description of swords and armor, the dwarf election that took so long I didn't even bother counting the pages. Mr. Paolini is afraid to truncate or skip any moment in time. When characters are moving back to parts of the map the audience is already familiar with, there's no need to describe their travel unless something significant happens. Page after page was wasted on superfluous descriptions. This could've been a much more interesting story if it was 200-300 pages shorter.<br /><br />If I hadn't bought all four of the books at the same time, I would've quit midway through \\"Eldest,\\" but as I paid for the books and can't return them, I feel obligated to continue. Needless to say, I'm not looking forward to 850 pages of \\"Inheritance,\\" but I am looking forward to being finished so I can go back to reading interesting books written by authors who aren't afraid to let the audience fill in the blanks with their imagination.<br /><br />-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you are a science fiction fan then this is the book for you. It is well written, keeps you guessing, has a great plot and great characters, and as one gets closer to the end it has you speculating like crazy as to what caused all this and where it is going.<br />One of the greatest compliments one can give a book is to say that on putting it down you immediately go and order the next series and that's exactly what I did.<br /><br />Good on you Hugh Howey, and I hope you are writing the final series since I am anxiously awaiting to read it.<br /><br />[[ASIN:145377372X An Advanced Academic Reader: The Complete Guide to Learning Reading Comprehension Strategies]]
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Very well written page turner! Worthwhile reading, especially if you plan to see the movie! Great new mythology with excellent, fun and interesting characters. 4 stars only because we've been here before... Derivatively speaking that is. Familiar but different at the same time. Although this series creates its own world very well, there are lots of nods to series that have come before...maybe it's just me, but I'm reminded especially of that wizard-school series placed in England. ;)
B007G92QGO|3.0|While I quite enjoyed the novel, and it is well written, it is not memorable. It is certainly not as memorable as the tale it is based on: The Bad Seed. The idea has basically been overdone in the past. The good parents, but the bad gene that is handed down through the generations. It is also an idea that is not just less acceptable nowadays but also has been overdone on TV and in films over the years -- blaming nature rather than nurture.<br />This is basically what I would call a holiday or hospital read; pleasant but undemanding.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1475067011 An Advanced Academic Reader: Book 2: The Complete Guide to Learning Reading Comprehension & Strategies (Volume 2)]]

B00B0X4PIO|3.0|While the book is well written the story line is weak. One wonders if Hosseini started off at the top and unfortunately the only place to go is down. The Kite Runner was a wonderful novel, well-written with gripping plot and fascinating characters. A Thousand Splendid Suns was still a good story with solid characters but not quite as gripping. His third novel seems to show a definite slipping down the mountain. The characters are introduced and disappear and Hosseini seems to be relying on creating an atmosphere rather than a solid story. For fans of the first 2 novels expect a disappointment.  Personally, I hope Hosseini finds his stride before his next novel and doesn't just rely on the Afghani background to do the work for him.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1475067011 An Advanced Academic Reader: Book 2: The Complete Guide to Learning Reading Comprehension & Strategies (Volume 2)]]

B000ID37RM|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a story about the idea that to grow up is to overcome prejudice. It tries to prove this idea with three plots, one of each type:<br /><br />-An external plot seeking justice for a wrongly convicted Tom Robinson<br />-A relationship plot between the children and Boo Radley<br />-An internal development plot of the children's maturation<br /><br />The external plot is the main driver of the story: a black man has been falsely accused of rape by a white woman. Worse, he is wrongly convicted by a jury of white men after having the audacity to declare that he was helping the woman out of pity. This plot results in a failure as Tom is convicted and killed while trying to escape. The plot has a reversal at the end in which the true criminal (and perpetrator of prejudice) is himself killed and his killing is accepted by the law as eye-for-an-eye for Tom.<br /><br />The external plot unfolds in the formative years of the children and has a distinct impact on their relationship with an ostracized neighbor. They begin by fearing, judging and harassing Boo Radley, only to find that Boo has been helping them from the shadows. The plot ends when the children welcome Boo as a friend.<br /><br />The internal plot of the maturation of the children makes steady progress. They demonstrate an innate acceptance of others (in sharp contrast with the societal mores) and end up overcoming their own fear of Boo by accepting him as a friend (when even society has not accepted him).<br /><br />To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful story with a great idea: that growing up means overcoming prejudice. It seems to suggest that children have innate goodness and acceptance but can be molded by grownups and society to become blinded or become mature members of society. This contrasts with the idea that prejudice in any shape or form is childish and dangerous trait in adults and society as a whole. The story makes this point by tying together the three plots at the end: Boo kills the man who embodied prejudice to bring late justice for Tom Robinson, Boo does this to save the children, and the children accept him as a friend even though society still shuns him.<br /><br />It's a great movie.<br /><br />My only beef is the children's internal arc does not have many negative turning points. Their fighting (seemingly negative) is based on justifiable defending of their father's reputation, their jeering at Boo seems playful and child-like rather than childish and their talking Mr Cunningham out of the lynch mob and taking Boo's hand at the end feels a little caricatured and cringe-inducing. Maybe that's just my own feeling. Overall the point of the story is well taken and appreciated.<br /><br />My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.lls the man who embodied prejudice to bring late justice for Tom Robinson, Boo does this to save the children, and the children accept him as a friend even though society still shuns him.<br /><br />It's a great movie.<br /><br />My only beef is the children's internal arc does not have many negative turning points.

The inside of the steelbook is plain aluminium. But for 9.99 you can't complain. Great classic movie presented in HD. The transfer is pretty solid for such an old show.

0770437400|5.0|Gotta admit, when starting this book, didn't think I was gonna \\"get it\\". I was expecting a story in novel form and this does not work that way but if you just stick with it, youll find one gem of a tale, or tales, within. This isn't \\"The Walking Dead\\" or just another zombie splatter-punk novel with more guts and gore than story. Robert Kirkmans \\"TWD\\" torture porn comics do not belong anywhere in the same sentence as this masterpiece by Max Brooks (oops, just blew that one). This fine, exciting work is nothing short of amazing and thought provoking and so much more than just a bunch of people getting eaten and tortured to death. We have heroes, although most of them are not the super duper, totally fearless, pretty, handsome beyond belief,  over the top superheroes of so many books these days. The survivors in this one are mostly average people, the average soldier, the average family, the average pc nerd but in their own unique ways aren't so average after all. We have triumphs that turn to tragedies, and tragedies that turn to triumphs. Brooks shows extremely frightening yet plausible scenarios if a Z apocalypse was anywhere possible (which we know its not) but his stories will make you pause for thought. If youre a dog lover, which I am, then you will relate to one exciting passage in particular, grow to love Dachsunds if you don't already, yet feel a bit of grief over the circumstances of how this survivor became the man he is. There are passages of battle, from the beginning to where mankind and the military didn't have a clue as to how to fight this particular war, to the point, eventually, where we really seem to get our act together,  impressively so. There is enough hope, faith, insanity, sanity and despair to have seconds, even thirds. You will meet one elderly, blind Japanese gardener who is the biggest Z killing/surviving badass to come along this side of Daryl Dixon and then youll have a potential family tragedy between two Chinese nuclear subs.............or maybe not.<br /><br />If you can get by the logistics of the differences of reading this as compared to the average novel, then you will never regret it. As for zombie fiction, this is as good as it gets and I think will be the undefeated champ for many apocalypses to come. Thank you Max Brooks from this gushing new fan, and curse you as well, because I wish I had been smart and creative enough to write this intelligence infused masterpiece instead.

B0081G3MWI|5.0|I think most people who are gonna buy this album are already Baroness fans, they like heavy music and they expect that from this band. Something to know is that you'll have to be open to some more hard rock and pop influenced music in this album fused with metal. There is no growling, all vocals are clean. Can it be a heavy album? As a whole no, but some songs are.<br /><br />With all that said its still a wonderful album and all I can say is sample a few of the tracks online if you need to but dont let the shift is muscial style deter you from making this purchase.

1471101231|3.0|This autobiography is predominately about Ian Thorpe's comeback to try and make the team for the London Olympics and therein lies the main problem: he unfortunately did not make it, and so the detailed diary entries articulating the many technical aspects of his training regime during this process are tedious and boring. The last chapter is by far the best, where he finally reveals personal emotions including his struggle with depression and alcohol addiction. If only the whole book had been like this. Thorpe seems quite resentful in many parts; of his teachers who were apparently jealous that he was making more money than he was; of the media who apparently were constantly out to get him; of the constant questioning about his sexuality, even though he admits to living with a Brazilian swimmer for three years, going on holidays with his family, and attending red carpet events together (and then he writes that it is ridiculous to suggest he is gay); of his coaches; of other swimmers; of his father; of the Australian culture (tall poppy sndrome); of people who BBQ meat (yes this is in the book); of officials; and many others. Other times he states that he took Stilnox regularly because everyone else did and saw nothing wrong with getting an advantage from special swimming suits. He also writes about taking up smoking and drinking too much wine alone in his hotel room. The most interesting anecdote was when he was scheduled to be in the World Trade Centre when the terrorist attack happened.<br />Thorpe makes excuses for a lot of the negative things that have happened to him by externalising the issues; in other words, the problem is with others and not him. This may be true but the way the book is written portrays him in a less than endearing light at times. Elsewhere however the reverse is true, such as his charity work with Aborigines. Thorpe comes across as a troubled complex soul who still needs healing, and I hope this book was therapeutic for him.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, keeps you guessing! I couldn't put it down and it kept me entertained until the very end. Awesome!
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|Have you ever played Tetris and wished you could move around the pieces you've already placed? This is Slydris in a nutshell. A short but thorough tutorial gets you started. The premise is simple: slide the pieces at the top before they fall, or slide the already fallen pieces at the bottom. Complete a row to make it disappear.<br /><br />There are three game modes: Zen, which has no timer; Infinite, which is what I would consider the&quot;regular&quot; version; and Survival, which has you racing the clock to clear the bottom rows before a ton of blocks fall and make life difficult. There are, as usual with this genre of game, combos and chain bonuses, and the game ends when you totally fill the screen.<br /><br />The game is somewhat customizable: you can choose between three music options, three color schemes (with a &quot;color blind&quot; option, which seems to reverse the colors, but I could be wrong) and the aforementioned three game modes. The colors are vibrant without being overwhelming, and the music is not any more annoying than most similar games and better than some. Slydris also uses Game Circle, if you're into keeping score.<br /><br />Is it worth the buck to play? All in all, I think this is a pretty fun game. The problem is that there is a LOT of competition in this genre. I'm going to go ahead and say that I would pay the asking price for this game. There's nothing groundbreaking here, but it's a good time waster and the permissions aren't ridiculous. That by itself is worth the download, in my opinion. Since this is the FAOTD today, I would definitely recommend it. For free, you have nothing to lose. I may just keep this game around for a while, and at the rate that I delete these free games, that says a lot.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|love the game but don't think its fair I have to pay to complete it! the price is4.99 way to high
B009DCOU9S|3.0|This was a fun game for the pre teen age, they tell you where to go an what to do. It was a nice game.
0374531269|5.0|Very descriptive, heartfelt, and in-depth about what a boy went through as he tried to run from a war that captured him and took over his life before being reformed and running more from it so that it would never touch him again. Beautiful story.

0451450523|3.0|I had been wanting to read this book for long over a decade. Now that I have read it, I am glad I did. It was good. I enjoyed how there was a connection to the characters and a uniqueness about each one. The story of the unicorn as well was quite exciting yet sad all at once. It wasn't overly extraordinary. I suppose I had too high of hopes for it, but if you like stories about fantasy worlds, magicians, heroes, kings, and unicorns, this is a must read.<br /><br />The Last Unicorn is about unicorn who seems to be the last unicorn in the land.  She is concerned and wants to find more like herself.  While on her journey, she meets new people and a new set of problems. Could she forget who she is? What is really her life about?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so cool you get to run get bananas  unlock cool minions and just have fun with it
0441013597|4.0|This book was extremely confusing for the first few chapters. Thankfully it got very good. My husband egged me on about reading this since we named our firstborn Leto (as he is Dune obsessed). It was certainly a good read. Such an imaginative story. I have since read the first 5 books in the series, and this is one of the best from it.<br /><br />The Atreides family needs to move to a desert planet called Dune, or Arrakis, as they call it.  Duke Leto, the lady Jessica, and their son Paul will have their lives forever changed.  There is a mass spice production on the planet, and whoever controls the spice, controls the universe.  Paul meets the people in the desert called \\"Fremen\\" who captivate his heart.  There is a common enemy called the Harkonnens who have a blood lust and are power hungry.  They want the Atreides detroyed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game and simply cannot wait for the Redstone update to come. Within hours I found 5 Diamond's! Like I said this game I worth the money and personally I think it's a million times better than X-box
1423101499|4.0|Out of all the books so far in the series that I've read, this is the best one. It isn't as predictable and fast moving. There are a lot of details and puzzle pieces to put together in your head while reading it. The labyrinth is being used to try to receive a special string by the Titan army so that they can put an end to the gods/goddesses and rule supreme. Percy and his friends set out to find it first, but each face their own battles in the process.
B000HWZ5W4|4.0|Well Robert Plant goes out and shows everyone that he is not a one trick pony and is able to reinvent himself, which he has done many times over after the breakup of Led Zepplin. On this his second solo project he moves further away from anything Zepplin based and gives the listener something new and interesting. Phil Collins plays drums on this one.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|For any fan of the series, this is the book you've been waiting for, it's amazing.  The book is essentially a series of battle sequences that are rife with action.
B0098466CK|5.0|The Sword delivers a great listening experience again. If you liked previous releases then this will sound to you a worthy addition to your collection.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I read the reviews on this book,and they were not favorable.I really liked this third edition of the Crossfire novels.The characters were much more softer and really in love.However I hope Ms.Day won't make us wait an entire year to find out what happens next.Before I read Entwined,I had to skim through the ending of Reflecting to remember what happened.PLEASE! Don't make us wait.

B00C6BACF4|5.0|You already like Shaun of the Dead! Or you don't. It's been a long time since this movie came out, so you've had time to decide whether or not you want to see it. I'm not going to change it now probably.<br /><br />But if you are wondering if you should spend the money on this Steelbook version, yes. It's super slick looking, good quality, etc etc.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Best record of the year. Experimental, good, catchy, viva Daft Punk! We just wish for a remix album soon !
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Waited forever for this due to me wanting the form factor and compatibility with my other withings products; blood pressure and scale.  The display is ingenious and works well, I can view it while it is still on my belt -  it was not clear to me to wipe the display to get previous days but have noticed that Withings does not give complete info on their products - they try and keep it simple and probably assume you will figure the rest out later.<br />Sync'd first time with iPhone 5 but an upgrade failed - locked in middle.  I was able to get out and subsequent upgrade worked.  Sleep info is amazing, will have to get more data points to comment further.<br />No charger comes with it - must connect to your own USB charger or laptop - lots of companies doing this - where did the savings go?  reduced product price or increased profit?
B00AC8ZIXO|4.0|I watched this as a series on Machinima Prime's youtube channel. It's a great movie/series though. I enjoyed it thoroughly.
B00123IAVA|4.0|I remember when this album first came out (1970 or so) , and I think I was the first in the neighborhood to buy it (on vinyl of course). I was blown away by the opening track, &#34;Speed King&#34;. Still am. Soon I was lending it out to everyone. I still have the original album, pretty worn out though. I lost my LP player and I had to buy the MP3 version. Even though this album has the classic &#34;Child in TIme&#34;, which I think ranks with &#34;Stairway to Heaven&#34;, as one the best songs from that era, and Ian Gillan's vocals are great, this is still not my favorite Deep Purple album (that being &#34;Machine Head&#34;).
B005T4SW7K|4.0|The focus on objects and daily life is very productive; the period introdutions are also very good.  This is the kind of book that should have a high school version.

B00DHSK3RM|5.0|Lots of fun and easy to play if you have the time to spare or need a distraction.  Don't get sucked into spending 99cents at a time because it will add up.  Most levels can be won without needing to buy extra stuff if you're patient.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game as of right now has ten levels but is free so why not get it! The levels are fun and somewhat challenging. You have to escape the rooms by finding things that can help you escape. Makes you want to keep figuring out how to escape and can be fun to do as well as make you think about what you are doing. Have fun if you get the app it's worth getting.
0763660531|5.0|What a wonderful journey thru the imagination for a child of any age! A great adventure, wonderfully illustrated but wordless.  It reminds me a bit of \\"Instructions\\" by Neil Gaiman. (This is a must get for any fantasy fan, esp if you have a child to read & show).<br /><br />Altho it is wordless it is not really meant for the toddlers, more for the imaginative grade-schooler .  Now, yes, you can't \\"read aloud' with your child, but I can see many ways of enjoying this together.<br /><br />The illustrations are simply amazing and breathtaking.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of my favourite games. Keeps me pickup poured while I'm at work. Love the different themes and the missions keep it interesting.
B000001ESF|5.0|This is a legendary rock album and a legendary progressive rock album from a band that defines the genre.  For fans of hard rock or progressive rock Rush made many excellent albums, and 2112 is one of the best albums from ANY rock band including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />For people that do not know Rush, this is a perfect introduction to their music and progressive rock.  In my opinion Rush and Yes are the two flagship bands of the progressive rock genre.  The roots of progressive rock start with the Beatles' &#34;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&#34;.  It evolved with psychedelic rock of '60s with bands like the Doors.  Prog rock matured into its own style in the 1970s with Yes and Rush, and the album 2112 was a big part of that history.
B004132HZS|5.0|Love Cumberbach's portrayal of Sherlock.  This Sherlock is modernized, yet true to Sherlock details. I can't wait for more.  I watch it with my 20 year old daughter.  We both love it
B00009Z574|3.0|A good and underrated Yes album featuring one of the more popular Yes lineups (Anderson, Howe, Wakeman, Squire, and White).  However, the same lineup is featured on a better album &#34;Going for the One&#34;.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is very fun but too short. We need more levels. Keep up the good work. It was challenging but not too hard to make you crazy.
B007XH6BPG|3.0|This is a good album that seems to be done as a side project for these two musicians.  My criticism is that they are two famous musicians for the bass and electric guitars, and the album does not present that as much as their main projects in Yes or Genesis.
B004W2ZHD2|5.0|NOTE: This is NOT a DVD. It's a 12\\" Laserdisc. These record album-sized predecessors of today's DVDs were visually superior. Until the advent of Blu-Ray technology, Laserdiscs were the best video format available.<br />.<br /><br />The 80's home edition of Neil Simon's MURDER BY DEATH (with b&w cover photo) is a good quality transfer. Its box is designed for security, with the tape removed for playing from the side rather than the bottom; a side flap tucks in to prevent the video from accidentally falling out.<br /><br />In this classic mid-70s farce, five detectives (based on such fictional characters as Sam Spade and Hercule Poirot) and their sidekicks are invited to an atmospheric mansion for dinner and an opportunity to solve a murder that will occur at exactly midnight. People, and even the house itself are not what they appear to be: false identities, trick rooms and hidden passages add to the challenge.<br /><br />An all-star cast, Robert Moore's direction and one of Simon's wittiest scripts make this who-dun-it a delight throughout.

B00CW7KK9K|1.0|After a few months, and mixed results with the Pulse, I am updating my initial review. Things got off to a bad start when  \\"out of the box\\" i got a fatal HW failure 1 error. Following the troubleshooting instructions (full charge and hold power for 15 seconds for a reboot) did not fix things. Thankfully Withings support were quick to respond and within 6 days I had a replacement device - very pleased.<br /><br />The pulse does some things well. As advertised it counts steps and can measure your pulse. It also syncs with the Withings app as expected. What it lacks is an ability to calibrate the unit, and as a run i know to be exactly 5.89km consistently reports at 7.2km, I dont have much confidence in the step counting accuracy. And sleep mode has a bad habit of waking its self up in the middle of the night on regular occasions. I have contacted Withings Support about this issues numerous times and they no longer respond to me.<br /><br />Maybe the next one will be the one.<br /><br />Good Luck.<br /><br />UPDATE: Replacement is also confirmed faulty and to be replaced.
B0079J28NW|5.0|From KING FEATURES, creators of such low-budget cartoons as [[ASIN:B000WC38NM BEETLE BAILEY]] and [[ASIN:B0000C2IX8 KRAZY KAT]], comes the full-length animated classic, YELLOW SUBMARINE (1968).<br /><br />This is a superbly crafted film, one that holds up remarkably well. Intense, vivid colors, complexly designed animations, easy-to-recognize characters and an enchanting story are only a few of the picture's highlights.<br /><br />Best of all are the visuals that illustrate several Beatles tracks.<br /><br />\\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" like the song itself is properly British with its quick flashes of English scenery, crowds of faceless people and glimpses of the rundown neighborhood where this sad and lonely woman lived and died.<br /><br />\\"Only a Northern Song,\\" combined with its music is almost trance-inducing. Very trippy right from the outset, the sequence culminates with an arc of slowly-moving Beatles above a large cube that hypnotically pulses every 1/24th of a second between day-glo green and lemon yellow.<br /><br />\\"Lucy in the Sky\\" is an outline of a flapperish-looking girl, animated as a sort of rainbow color blotched Toulouse Latrec poster. She dances on the song's upbeat choruses in her flowing dress and feathers.<br /><br />\\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" explains in animated text that there are more than 33 million minutes in 64 years, then illustrates how long a minute really is, by using giant numbers in a variety of bizarre designs (including characters from the movie) that click by in time to the song.<br /><br />There's much more to enjoy here. If you're an animation aficionado and have never seen YELLOW SUBMARINE, please do so. It's a treat for the eyes, ears and soul!<br /><br />In addition to an epilogue cameo by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, cartoon voices are provided by:<br /><br /> Paul Angelis - Chief Blue Meanie / Ringo<br /> John Clive - John<br /> Dick Emery - Jeremy Hilary Boob, Ph.D - Nowhere Man / Lord Mayor / Max<br /> Geoffrey Hughes - Paul<br /> Lance Percival - Young / Old Fred<br /> Peter Batten - George<br /><br />Related item--<br />The one-hour 1967 BBC TV special, [[ASIN:B008RTE08E MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR]] is a curious mix of the mundane, comic and surreal.

0316066524|2.0|I have read a number of articles and essays about David Foster Wallace, especially those connected to the recent biography by D.T. Max. I ordered \\"infinite Jest,\\" and I made an effort to read it, to get into it. But I did not succeed & cannot recommend it. On one level, it is an extraordinary feat of language-production. But, to me, it is unreadable, not a book that (speaking for myself) a reader can engage, can be engaged by. It reminds me in this respect of Stein's \\"The Making of Americans\\" and Joyce's \\"Finnegans Wake,\\" both works of genius, both nearly impossible to read. \\"Bleak House,\\" \\"Middlemarch,\\" \\"The Golden Bowl....\\" For many readers, if not for all, these writers & novels, and  Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Proust.... Some big novels have points of entry for readers, become absorbing, captivating, however dense and difficult and even tedious they are in places. But Wallace's novel: again, it shows a kind of genius. But I wonder how many readers, outside a small circle, find that this writer is speaking to them, is addressing them.

B00BH0VSM6|3.0|I've only recently discovered Jo Nesbo's writings on the heels of &#34;The Girl With...&#34; series by Steig Larson. For better or not, I read the novels pretty much in reverse order so it was interesting to read an earlier work by Nesbo. One can clear experience the literary development of the writer and the increasing levels of sophistication in his later works. The Bat was an interesting journey &#34;down under,&#34; but the character development and story line are less compelling than Nesbo's later efforts.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|I have always been a Phantom of the Opera fan, but I never got the chance to see the stage musical, instead listening to the original soundtracks. Here with this Special 25th Anniversary, I was finally given the opportunity to see what the stage version is like. While the actors are no Michael Crawford (the best phantom I think to grace the stage), and Sarah Brightman, I found that I enjoyed Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Bogess. Sierra Bogess gave an astounding presentation of \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again,\\" and Ramin Karimloo hit the notes perfectly in \\"Music of the Night. I did feel that Hadley Fraser's Raoul was a bit too possessive of Christine unlike the romantic Steve Barton. The opening scene with the chandelier going up and the orchestra playing is absolutely beautiful. The costumes on the set were amazing, and the rest of the actors did a great job. This is a must see for Phantom of the Opera fans.
B00E6Z0THE|2.0|Ever have a game you really like, and then you get a certain puzzle you can't solve because you lack sufficient dexterity to complete it? Well, this has one of those. You can't skip it either. I guess I could live w/ some of the clues being in French, and even that the clue system needs much to be of good use; but when you get stymied by one puzzle so that you cannot continue the game is just stupid! I was ready to give this game at least 4 stars until I got to this puzzle. All the other puzzles are quite easy to solve, so yeah, it's too aggravating! !
B0085OF4GS|4.0|Top Secret<br /><br />Val Kilmer played in some really funny comedies when he was first starting in the movie business.

I had heard that Ramin Djawadi was a pupil or in some way affiliated with Hans Zimmer so I figured that the soundtrack was worth buying.  Unfortunately, there are only 2-3 tracks with memorable pieces to it.  Considering there are a total of 25 tracks, 2-3 good ones is low compared to soundtracks by Hans Zimmer.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I bet it would be great but it's not really working, it would fizz up so I deleted it sorry if I had a kindle fire and not a HD one, I wouldn't deleted it D;
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I bought this for my 19 year old boyfriend's birthday, and I don't think he's put it down since. After reading the reviews it is exactly what I expected. It's obviously plastic and feels a bit light at first, but it's the perfect size and the designs on the handle give it a very realistic look. It's lasted for months without breaking and is an excellent deal.
B00BU987C8|5.0|super fast delivery. That shit was crazy.<br />The music wasn't too bad. My major beef with this album is that he claims Compton in his songs... Compton has changed since 1984, its not the same Compton that everyone has heard of. If Easy-e was alive and NWA was still making music I don't think Kendrick Lamar would have made any money.<br /><br />For today I think this album goes down the right track. It has that Compton feel, that old west coast gangster sound but it just doesn't have the NWA or Easy-E attitude.<br /><br />I liked this album but I hope Kendrick can pull it off better next time.
0307474275|5.0|I've already read this and I bought it for my 12 year old. I had to write a negative review previously because the vendor shipped so slowly.<br /><br />Excellent quality. Just like I bought it fresh off the shelf.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Right now i'm super drunk and I am listening to this album. Honestly this daft punk album is super crazy. It goes from highs to lows, every song is completely different and I just cant describe how this sounds. It's weird and if you are a fan of things that are weird, you will like the album. Fair warning, there is no particular sound that can describe this album, it goes al over the place. Did I like it? Well yeah a little bit but I am super drunk after all.

B0044C3RB4|5.0|OK, first, this is a fantasy! If you didn't like X-Files forget this show and don't even give a try, because make-believe and non-ending story lines will drive you crazy. I have no idea what they are doing and how they solve these dilemmas but it is really fun anyway. A little bit like the new show \\"Under the Dome\\", you are in the dark a lot of the time. The stars of the show are quite captivating, and generally covers two different roles in two different dimensions of time(I don't think that is a spoiler). The genius professor in his Harvard lab steals the scenes and the show regularly. Try this great sci-fi show.

B000FVE3AC|5.0|This is my second Invicta Divers watch. I also own a model 3044 which is a black version of the 3045. I purchased this second one because I dropped the first one on a tiled floor breaking the crystal. It is now with Invicta awaiting for the repair to be completed.  I have used the 3044 daily for over 2 years and during that time it has been subjected to all manner of abuse. I have used the 3044 for scuba diving and everyday at the gym. It looks great and often elicits positive comments. It is solidly built and very heavy. Perhaps some people might find the watch a little too heavy. but for me the weight adds to the overall perception of quality.  The watch keeps great time and as a result I can only remember 1 or 2 occasions when I have needed to make a small adjustment. Because it has an automatic movement it needs to be worn otherwise it will stop. However my experience is that it is possible to not wear it for up to 24hours before it stops. Even then it can be started with the smallest of movements. One weakness is the poor luminosity of the time points on the dial and fingers. It is difficult to see the time after dark.<br /><br />Overall the new watch (3045) seems as though it will be as strong and durable as the 3044.<br /><br />If you do not mind the weight this is a nice quality good looking watch that keeps excellent time and it seems as though it will continue working for many years.

B00DDZM0GQ|2.0|\\"Infinite\\" is the mode that I have played in the most. I did try them all, however. In all modes, I noticed that the game piles on too much too fast without a logical way out much of the time. It's all up to luck of the draw more than it is to player skill. Oftentimes, there's no way to make a block fit through no fault of my own. Games that are more random and luck of the draw rather than skill just don't interest me very much. Hence, my review.<br /><br />In that regard, while the original Tetris also had an original randomness to it, it did not detract from the game and there was still mostly skill involved. I do not find that to be the case here.<br /><br />I'm just calling it as I see it, like I always try to do.<br /><br />I appreciate the game modes and attempts to make this game \\"playable\\" within the realm of the \\"sliding blocks\\" idea. But no matter what mode I try, I just cannot get into it.<br /><br />This game needs SERIOUS fine-tuning. Maybe the idea itself just isn't workable. But please, Dev, slow down on adding the blocks! At least in the beginning, stop with the avalanche and let us hit a rhythm or something? Please?<br /><br />A game needs to be playable and fun. The polish and good graphics (well, as good as blocks can look, I suppose) do not excuse the game play.<br /><br />2 stars until they make a real game out of this.

0062238868|5.0|In February of this year, I, along with basically the entire country, heard about Chris Kyle's tragic death in Texas.  While I don't really swing right or left on the political spectrum, I will confess to a lifelong admiration for the United States military, an admiration which was magnified when my best friend joined the Navy several years ago.  As a fan of combat memoirs, I had seen \\"American Sniper\\" in various stores and hadn't gotten around to picking it up. When I learned of the circumstances surrounding Kyle's murder, as well as his reputation as one of if not the deadliest snipers of all time, I had to make this my next purchase.  I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />Let's get a few things out of the way first: I love war stories because I'm a relatively passive, admittedly out-of-shape nerd who has never and never will spend any time in a combat zone.  As a result, one of the reasons I dig on these type of books is because in a way I'm allowed to live vicariously through the adventures of the narrator.  And there was no shortage of adventure here.  Kyle was a larger than life figure, a modern-day gunfighter so feared by the insurgents and terrorists he was fighting that he earned the nickname \\"the Devil of Ramadi\\" and had a $20,000 bounty placed on his head.  An unabashed comic book/action movie fan, he dubbed his men \\"the Punishers\\" and and wore the famous Marvel anti-hero's skull-logo on his flak jacket.  His book, while not spectacularly written, doesn't have to be: the man's record speaks for itself.  Furthermore, I actually found the conversational tone of \\"American Sniper\\" engaging; I felt like Kyle was sitting across from me, telling me these stories.  His tone is so matter-of-fact and understated that at times I found myself laughing out loud. From a purely visceral standpoint, Kyle's book delivers in a big way.<br /><br />That being said, at the risk of sounding like the theme-song to a certain popular movie series, Chris Kyle was a complicated man.  Whilehis book is filled with the usual hair-raising accounts of firefights and near-death experiences that populate most war memoirs, what really made \\"American Sniper\\" stand out for me were the stories that did not take place on the battlefield.  A truly inspired choice for this book was allowing Chris's wife-now-widow Taya to write various passages spaced throughout the overall narrative.  As much as I loved Kyle's blood-and-thunder tales of sniping terrorists in Middle Eastern backwaters, Taya's frank and often messy accounts of what it was like to be the one left at home really brought the story home for me, making me admire her as much as if not more than her husband.<br /><br />Also, although Kyle tends to have a high opinion of himself--an opinion which is certainly earned and even encouraged by the culture of which he was a part--he admits that he was a flawed individual; he could be a barroom brawler, at times not the best husband or father, a man who often put his work before his family and even flirted with alcoholism and infidelity.  His compassion for vets suffering from mental trauma is palpable and refreshing, and it was unfortunately this same empathy for wounded souls that brought him to his untimely death.<br /><br />\\"American Sniper\\" is a valuable addition to any combat aficianado's library, as well as a compellingly human story about what it's like to serve and what it's like to be stuck at home while a loved one puts themselves in harm's way.  Politics should not enter into it.  Whether you're a Democrat, a Republican, or unaffiliated, Chris Kyle was a man to be admired and, most importantly, remembered.  Read his story to see for yourself.<br /><br />RIP Chris Kyle.<br /><br />P.S.: Nicholas Schmidle's piece for The New Yorker, \\"In the Crosshairs,\\" is a fascinating companion to Chris's book, not only for the new information it reveals about Kyle but also the man who killed him, traumatized former Marine Eddie Ray Routh.  It, like this book, is absolutely worth your time, and can be found online if you don't feel like buying the actual magazine.<br /><br />GO NAVY.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I thought this game was too hard-- but give it to a 3,5, or 6 yr old and they will play endlessly!  They had to go back a few times but loved the challlenge. I'm sure the movie helped add to their desire for this game but that's a plus. Can't give an opinion as far as older kids/adults go because I am horrible at games!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love this game. Truly an exceptional game. Only thing I would change is the point system. Takes to long for the cards to generate points.
0979019710|5.0|Making dramatic changes in your life is never easy, but Hal's brook makes it extremely simple. His guidance makes it extremely clear how you can create a routine that, while seemingly simple, will change your life. I have had more energy, more excitement, more productivity, and other truly astonishing developments. My business is growing as a direct result and I have attracted potential partnerships that I could never have dreamt to be possible. Buy the book, read it, make your routine, and change your life. It's that simple.<br /><br />P.S. My girlfriend and I did it together, it helps to have an accountability partner even if they don't live under the same roof.

What was I thinking when I saw her the first time??&#34;  I LOVE this album!  I love her lyrics, voice and delivery. Lana takes me along for a nice road trip through Americana and inspires me in so many ways!

B005KMX866|4.0|4 stars for &#34;the voice&#34;; it's all about the material;never the voice or the showmanship.  This is a hit and miss collection of classic Sun material.  Saw Chris in person, same week as purchasing c.d.  Master showman on stage....would go see again and again.  Album on the other hand is too &#34;one flavored&#34; for me though.

057809665X|2.0|a tedious book.  it's one of these deals where they string you along forever, reassuring you that what they're about to say is profound and life changing, before they drop the main point.  And every chapter repeats earlier content ad nauseum.  It could have been easily summed up in a blog post, and a short blog post at that.

B000FCKGPC|4.0|I enjoy the writing and the storylines. This book is a little slow though. It seems to focus on the same characters that don't seem as central to the story.(unless they are in the next book and finale). It seems like they just do a lot of traveling. The one thing I do like is you see another side of The Kingslayer. It kind of seems to hint that some of the people we thought were dead might still be alive. I have not been disappointed by any of the books so far. (other than being upset about &#34;red wedding&#34;)

0525478817|5.0|5 stars plus (spoiler-ish)<br />Let me start this review by saying that this will be my first, honest, indepth review. Also, let me say that I now truly understand what an honest-to-god 5 plus star book is.<br /><br />I have been seeing people mention how everyone should read &#34;the fault in our stars&#34; and I was hesitant at first after reading the premise on amazon. I knew this book would be intensely emotional, and honestly I didn't want to drag myself down to those depths while dealing with a bout of sadness myself. I'm glad that I took the chance to read this book.<br /><br />The book starts off with us meeting our heroine hazel who is a bit of a Debbie downer but in all actuality a realist. She has been dealt a shit lot in life and is left basically going through the motions. Her mom, the typical clingy mom one can expect when faced with losing an only child, and dad, the thought provoking crier, are supporting characters who add a ton of depth and insight to the book. After being somewhat forced to go to a support group for cancer survivors, hazel meets one Augustus Winters, who from first sight brought Hazel out of her pessimism and taught her to live her life.  Their story is beautifully intertwined while we go through their development into love that some of us wish we can experience.  At the risk of not wanting to spoil the book for anyone, i must say that I cried during about 2/3 of the book and at most of those jags of crying I had a lump the size of Texas in my throat. The book is, as expected, tragically sad but adds a plethora of poignant quips to help the reader truly think about our lives and how we fit in them.<br /><br />One such poignant quip is &#34;the voracious ambition of humans is never sated by dreams coming true, because there is always the thought that everything might be done better and again.&#34;<br /><br />The book seems to somewhat parallel the book within, whereas it seems to end in the middle, not like a dreaded cliffhanger, but to let the reader see what they think of as the ending. We aren't left with as many open ended questions as in &#34;an imperial affliction&#34;, we find out what mom and dads lives will entail after Hazel dies, but we never actually experience her death. I like to think that she was able to live as well as possible and died a somewhat painless death. But that's just what I hope.<br /><br />I know this review might seem jumbled up and all over the place, but I feel since Mr. Green took the time to write such a beautifully tragic book, that's easily 5 stars if not more, then I can take the time to express my gratitude for it.

B00E25KVLW|5.0|After his Asterisk book and his first book about Rails 3 the author shows again, that he has the ability to guide a beginner through the whole process of learning a very powerfull and very complex programming language.<br /><br />The \\"Rails way\\" is not the easiest way for people that have worked with other languages like PHP or Perl, but with this book everybody can manage it.<br /><br />The book starts completely from the very basics without getting boring for readers, that already know the basics of programming. For me one of the most important thing was, that the examples have a practical use (not like many other examples I know from my old university books). Because of the practical use the reader can just start playing around with the new knowledge an try to solve some problems in his daily business.<br /><br />After all exercises the reader will be able to write his first application!<br /><br />I can only recommend this book!
B001AKTZOQ|5.0|i love this cd! i had the (vinyl ) album when i was youngerand played(drums) along with it. if you're a creedence fan and you've always wanted the full version of &#34;i heard it through the grapevine&#34;, then, you've got to have this cd.

B00AO2SGHI|5.0|I've loved Dido's music since her debut and she is so authentic. I love her own words, her unique sound, and her originality. Her second CD in this duo pack is excellently mixed dance music. If you love artists who create their own, she's your woman.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Had me hooked from the first episode...British tele at its best.  Characters you love and characters you love to hate.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|I love Amy's voice. She has a powerful voice that is different from most others.  The band is also great. I have evanescence's other cds and this is a great addition to those.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game is lots of fun great way to kill time while waiting at apts will recommend to my friends.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I use this on a tablet, and think it would be too little to use on a smartphone. It's a little busy, with not really good graphics, but it's free. And you can shut off wifi and it won't pester you about shutting down like some other free solitaire games do.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|...gotta like dependable reads...not always predictable, but dependably enjoyable.  Have yet to be disappointed by Baldacci's books.  Keep bringing them!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I heard that there was gonna be a movie coming out based on this book after I saw an ad online. It looked like one of those horror movies when someone gets possessed by a devil or something, (because Clary kept drawing the angelic power rune). But then I saw a tv spot and I was like, \\"this looks so awesome!\\" Even though it had to do with demons, I'm really not a fan of that. As soon as I started to read it, I instantly became hooked to the book. I even read the book in bed! Then I learned this book doesn't seem even CLOSE to horror. Heck, I even want to be a shadowhunter for Halloween and its like two months away! This, I swear, is the best fantasy book I've ever read (next to Harry Potter of course, I mean who doesn't like Harry Potter?) That's why I rated it 5 stars. I highly recommend this book to 7th graders and up because in this age range, every one loves something that has to do with teen romance and fighting (I know this because I am a seventh grader myself)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was very cool and it had very good graphics! The only problem was that it was too short! I think that there should be more levels in the game to make it last longer. But this game is by far the best thinking game I've played!
0618918248|1.0|there is no way some one can prove god exists but also no 1 can prove god doesn't exist. but there are many sings that god exists.if the universe is out of control this world will vanish so some 1 is out there who is in control . the author did his best to prove god don't exist but there are many signs in the holy scriptures which matches with science and humans cant reveal them so I would rather recommend this book [[ASIN:1491219149 The God Delusion VS.

B005PK1G76|5.0|I have UPPA BABY and this works great on it. I didn's want to spend $30 on the uppa baby adapter, so this is awesome. It can hold 2 bottles, plenty of space in between and it seems to be made of a strong material.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's super easy to find ideas, inspiration, DIY and more. This app makes it easy to sort what I 'pin' on my boards. I prefer the app over using the website on the computer. love love love.

B009OCR1X4|5.0|This soundtrack is beautiful, incredible and just an incredible masterpiece. The combination of the composers with the art of the film work seems as if it were crafted by geniuses. I'm so happy they released this perfect soundtrack. &#34;Cloud Atlas End Title&#34; track is absolutely, hypnotically, mind numbingly amazing. I higly recommend buying this one in a billion unique OS.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|My only complaint is the game is too short. It is a nice free little app. I think kids would really enjoy it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I usually think of Spock as a master of deception, however, I am starting to like the new Spock.  He is honest, brave, and sensitive to others.<br /><br />The plot is great.  400 year old villain is revived, Khan the wolf, Sonn is brought back from cryogenic freeze to build advanced weapons designed to destroy the Klingon empire.  The admiral feels that \\"War is inevitable\\" and that he will be the general leading the war.  In an effort to destroy the crew of Bounty Bay, 72 pods armed with photon missiles is target at the Klingon homework.  The plot almost worked, but Kirk decides to bring Khan back to earth to face his crimes and answer for the death of Admiral Pike.<br /><br />Kirk saves Spock, Spock saves Kirk, McCoy saves Kirk, Spock kicks Khans butt.  The war with the Klingons does not happen.  Spock fight scenes are fantastic: the vulcan nerve pinch, the vulcan death touch, and the rage within. Vulcans are war like race that control their combat tendencies.  Spock demonstrates a high degree of courage and resourcefulness.  Khan skull crushing technique is very ruthless.  Khan is a superior being, psychopathic killer, with desires to conquer.  Kirk is set to fall in love with Dr. Marcus.<br /><br />The cast was great:  Scottie was resourceful and the trans warp technology remains innovative.  Chekov continues to be impressive at the helm and in engineering.  The Warp core looks like a fusion reactor or collider, a nice twist between sci fi and real world technology.<br /><br />The sci fi special efforts were great.  I loved the cgi city, the colors and backgrounds, and the music.<br /><br />What do we learn about the federation?  We learn the federation is war like and the top brass is invest in technology that will defeat the Klingons or any enemy.  The federation is powerful and armed with a weapon that can destroy ships in warp, a predator ship.  We learn the federation moon of Praxis has been destroyed.  The Klingons are tribal and in survival status.  However, there was no indication that the Klingons were trying to occupy federation planets or were attacking the federation.  Uhara correctly accesses the Klingons as having honor.  The Klingon code of honor makes them less of a Villain.  The Klingons are in a civil war and the tribes or clans are struggling for power.  The federation does not seem interested in helping the Klingons rebuilt and prefers them to remain in a state of chaos, backward development, and isolated.r, there was no indication that the Klingons were trying to occupy federation planets or were attacking the federation.

B00B7Y0206|2.0|I got this app thinking &quot;hey I can watch youtube videos so much easier now&quot; well I was COMPLETELY wrong. See if you watch a video that's over 4 min long (who doesn't?) It just either freezes or takes like 20 minutes (even with good internet). The worst part is youtube doesn't work on my kindle anymore so I'm stuck with this app. D':  I mean if you make the videos load faster then I'd take back everything I said and<br />say this was a 5 star app but until you do anything like that I'll have to suffer with this app and you'll have to suffer with bad reviews. (Also the only reason your not getting a 1 star review is because you actually play video unlike every other youtube app in this appstore
1400069807|5.0|You've no doubt subtlely felt that corporate food manufacturers were swaying your grocery store purchases. But this book lifts the veil that consumers are \\"supposed\\" to experience, revealing the incredible efforts that go into getting us hooked on sugar, fat & salt.<br /><br />This book is a wonderful, eye-opening read that has confirmed my deeply-held suspicions that I am not the hapless, overweight consumer I once thought I was. I am a pawn in a big-money game of PROFITS BEFORE EVERYTHING.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|Great puzzle game for toddlers! My son loves it! Four free puzzles and only $1.99 to unlock the rest. The puzzles start out easy and get progressively more challenging as you go along.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|Easy setup, linked quickly to my iPhone Withings App and Withings website. Update downloaded without issues. It seems to track sleep and heart rate quite well. I am concerned about the accuracy of steps and miles. It was way off from my RunKeeper app over the same route. Need to give it a week or so to see if it improves, although I can't think of how it could refine its measurements.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/7/13:<br /><br />I set up a road course of 3.00 miles with my car; here are the results of the Pulse and RunKeeper<br /><br />PULSE: Time-1HR 27MIN. DISTANCE-3.8MI. CALORIES-400<br /><br />RUNKEEPER: Time-45:51 DISTANCE-2.99MI. CALORIES-400<br /><br />I realize there are a lot of potential variables and the time seems to be wildly off.

B000G8NXYG|5.0|It came quickly, well packed, and in great shape. I thought the price was more than fair.<br /><br />This is an all time classic and I hope to pick up a copy for myself at some point. I have not had a chance to watch all the bonus features etc. As I said, it was a gift for someone but, I can only imagine that it is a movie nerd's (like myself) dream.
B0062OCNAI|3.0|Normally, I don't read fantasies, but years ago I had a very good friend who had been in a coma for 3 months.  The doctor told her husband she was brain dead, her condition was irreversible, and she would never recover.  But after 3 months, she awoke, albeit with some mobility and speech deficits, but was able to tell us that while in the coma she had heard everything everyone was saying but had been unable to respond.  Then, more recently, my husband had an out-of-body experience during open-heart surgery after which, to the shock of his cardiologist, he later described everything that occurred during his surgery.  Thus, the subject matter interested me.<br /><br />First off, let me say the writer is very talented.  Her narrative kept me spellbound and interested throughout the book.  Although I generally figure out \\"who-done-it\\" long before the ending of a book, this one took me a little longer and still had some surprises left near the end.<br /><br />SPOILER:  Although I am sure the story will be one I won't forget, based on my personal experiences, I disagree with the author's comments about the story wherein she stated there was no other possible ending.  Often, it is the tragedies we read that stay with us the longest, and I have read many that I have enjoyed.  But I prefer to read books that offer hope and have a happy ending.  I think the ending of this book was a little harder for me to accept because, again, from personal experience, I knew it did not have to end the way it did.  Nonetheless, because of the excellent writing, it was worth the read.
B005JR47R6|5.0|Came fast, well packed, and was fairly priced.<br /><br />Another season of an all time great series and character (actually several) Obviously, Gregory House but also, I put James Wilson in my pantheon of all time TV characters as well. The show just wouldn't have had the impact and Laurie wouldn't have been able to show as many of those glimpses of humanity without Robert Sean Leonard's excellent portrayal of Wilson. Their love/hate relationship, drifting apart and then back together throughout the series, and quirky relationship is in many ways much more true to life than those steadfast, always got your back, relationships that have existed on TV throughout the years.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Absolutely amazing! Could not put it down. An amazing end to the trilogy. Can't wait to see the movie! Enjoy!
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Wow, compared to Expendables this was actually a good and entertaining movie.<br />Was well written as opposed to the first Expendables which was dumb.<br />We enjoyed it.
B00637D114|4.0|My kids liked this movie - well made!!<br /><br />8 year old girl and 10 year old boy<br /><br />Excited for the next one
B004RQVVGU|5.0|this is truly the album where Ozzy separates himself from Black Sabbath and shows the world what Rock& Roll truly means to him, as evidenced in his hit song,&#34; You Can't Kill Rock & Roll&#34;...
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love this app. The game is very fun and challenging at times. I might have a bit of an advantage since I am fairly good at drawing. But, even amateur doodlers can play. I just wish there was an added feature in which you can view the drawing that you create and also save it. I know it's possible on iPods but not on the Kindle fire, which is my device. Overrall, this game is fantastically creative and deserves 4 out of 5 stars.
B000WBZZ20|1.0|I was excited about receiving the Matrix Trilogy, but alas, it was programmed to play in Europe, not the US.<br />This was not stated in the movie description. I had to incur the shipping expense to return it. Bummer!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A fascinating look at animal psychology and human survival.  Great dry humor and spiritual co-mingling.  I highly recommend this book.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|I have to say, I was initially put off by the premise of the movie but gave it a chance out of curiosity.  I'm really glad I did, this movie complacently blew my expectations, so much so that I've spent the money to buy the DVD of it.  I recommend it to anyone who likes the show.
B001QWBM62|4.0|The sound quality is unbelievable. No one has mention sensitivity?  In a large room, it will pick up a whisper 30 feet away. Do not get a memory card over 8GB because when you power it up it will take too long to be in the record or play mode. The built in speaker is weak. The battery longevity is not great. Otherwise, a well make recorder. ZOOM sells a newer model, but I am stuck on this one. I just bought a second one for backup.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I ordered this CD after I saw the musical &#34;Jersey Boys&#34; with my daughter. She got the CD and I got the free MP3 download.  Great music! Great purchase.
B000PC0SPU|5.0|This was a great book possibly a life changer. The premise of the book applies to almost every profession and the future is coming for the artistic person..
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. Makes you appreciate those you have around you even more, and the amazing effect of small gestures. Good read!
161218412X|2.0|This is a beautiful set.  I was greatly looking forward to it.  Unfortunately, though the package it arrived in was not damaged, the books themselves were poorly made where the spine attachment was falling apart on all four volumes when it arrived.  I sent it back and reordered it, but yet again it arrived very damaged even though the box it was mailed in was immaculate.  I did not order it a third time.  Bummer.
B0083SBJXS|2.0|The blue ray DVD would freeze up in the first half of the movie.  We had to watch it on the regular DVD.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great story! It Should be prooofread better, though. There were a few misspellings and grammatical and punctuation  problems. More Will Robie novels would be much appreciated.
1475143389|5.0|I also read Michael's book \\"Muscle Myths\\" and this book was the perfect companion. It is such an easy read because he just simply knows how to write without filling the book with bs. Also, like in Muscle Myths he has references and citations for all the scientific studies he mentions. Which is another thing i love about his book, it's not fueled by Bro Science, which can be informative but he has the real facts from real studies. This book fills your head with the right information you have wanted. I love Michael Matthews as an author, I wish I was buddies with him so I could text him whenever I had workout/health questions. The end of the book includes a link to download a free one year workout and nutrition plan. You just can't beat that value. I'm starting the one year challenge workout plan next week, and I am the most excited I've ever been. A must read for anyone trying to get healthy and change their life.
1439102813|5.0|One of the most insightful books I have ever read.  I ordered 2 copies and although one was in excellent condition, the other one was damaged on the cover.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Could be a better game! It's a true challenge and is wonder to play with the kids. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00D5YNQWM|5.0|Amazing piece of work, Casey Tebo!  We all believe in you now!  Hoping for many, many more of these.  Aerosmith is an incredible band, still looking and sounding fantastic!!  Loved the \\"off the stage\\" footage.  Thanks again, Casey, for taking the initiative.  Great job, Aerosmith!
B00D6B4PUG|4.0|I said I liked this because it is a handy gaget to take along and be able to send my g-<br />mail.
1449410243|5.0|I got this for my stepson, who is almost impossible to please.  He and I have completely different tastes in almost everything, but we both love cats.  I read it, he read it, and the cats probably read it too!  It's surprising how on-point it is re cat behavior, but it's very funny too.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|The game is ok I think it should start out a bit faster. Also, the controls, once you swipe, it takes half a second to recognize the move which makes gameplay very frustrating, but otherwise an awesome game worth playing get it now!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is a great pacifier for the grand daughter, she loves playing it and we love it too. all you have to do is down load to my Kendal and have at it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is awesome. You have to pay close attention to every detail. Very tricky as the levels increase. But once again I love it.
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|THIS IS NOTHING LIKE THE FIRST JSUT MORE BLOOD. ALSO EVERYONE BECOMES POSSESSED AND TRIES TO KILL EACH OTHER UNLIKE IN THE OTHERS. THE TREE RAPE WAS UNNECESSARY AND IT DIDNT ELAVE HER BODY. THERE WAS NO MENTION OF WHO THE MAN WITH THOSE OTHER GUYS AND THE OLD LADY ADN LITTLE GIRL WERE AT THE BEGINNING NOR OF ASH. WHY DID THE BROTHER HAVE TO STAY INSIDE??????????
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I didn't want to by amp. Head phones just for watching movies on a flight.  The Fiio E6 was the best solution.<br />Inexpensive, small, and great sound even with a splitter and to sets of ear buds attached. If you turn the volume up to<br />Max, it can be to loud. Great for my Toshiba tablet.
B000ICXQOM|1.0|IS SO STUPID THAT ID RATHER WATCH HOWARD THE DUCK IN ROTATION. HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FIRST TWO EXCEPT THE BOOK. BRUCE CAMPBELL IS A HORRIBLE ACTOR. UM WHERE WAS BRIDGET FONDA?????????????
B005IQZB14|5.0|I enjoyed the journey. Cheryl wrote in a way that made you feel what she felt along the way. It was good to share the journey as it is one I would never imagine doing alone. Sharing it from my couch was good enough!
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|amazing book well worth the read couldnt put the book down now im on the last book of the series!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What an amazing book!! Everything about it was perfect.  It makes you gasp out loud.  I feel like I was part of the story, every single chapter captured my thoughts and emotions. I didn't want it to end.  Absolutely loved it!!
B004W1GCNC|5.0|There are NO dislikes. It is a wonderful production.The acting----the costumes---the story line----poor Persy! I can't imagine anyone giving this a poor review.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Great book and suspense was earth shattering.  Could not put the book down  this was a great amazing book to read.
B005QPMB2Y|1.0|I thought it was something different and now i wasted mu money and had to delete it, it really sucks
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|pretty good game some are tough but still a good game keeps busy that's what I like about games. even mind five year old likes this game n can guess some that I fang figure out lol....
140053271X|5.0|Easy to use.  I got it mainly for the ability to adjust the font size for easier reading as the public library has a limited number of large print books.  When we travel I don't have to lug around 3-4 books.  The Nook fits easily in a small travel bag or purse.
B007SOQBCM|5.0|awesome app wish it supported high quality!!! big fan of twitch.tv here i think its awesome they support kindle fire.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Truly a great series. The multiple perspectives really makes things interesting teaching us a lesson: history doesn't always get it right.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Very close to the book, very good acting.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the books.  I'm looking forward to the next movies in the series
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Ideal in for the nights where the f***ing cat is &#34;singing&#34; in front of your window.  You can adjust the volume.  Warning don´t use it  to much, can get an addict.  Try to leave your phone a little bit away while using this App for not to sleep with it.  (Scientist said that is bad...who knows...).  But I like it, recommended after all.
B0047T86G0|5.0|It is however useless on the Kindle. (Explained above and at length with 'Customer Service (2 hour chat!!)) - Refer to Roshan's submission.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|This App did not work on my Ace.  Better to change my cel or search to games style Nokia 1110 (snake, bounce, etc)...
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|After seeing this I kind of wish I would have seen it in the theater in 3D.  Was a fun ride, loved the troll, Jeremy Renner and Famke.  The effects were fun and not too much, although it was a bit kabuki theater (which is what would have made it a blast in 3D)
B00CH87HF4|1.0|This game is not for my new coming &#34;old&#34; Galaxy Ace.  Better buy other era celphone (SGSIII, SGSIV, IPhone), or will still searching Nokia 1100 style games....
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Done and done, worked very well, my fan no longer overheats trying to keep the temp of my PlayStation 3 down.
1401937519|5.0|Great writing style. Wonderful message. I read it every single morning for spiritual awareness. Feels good to read random paragraphs as often as needed.
B0012CH350|4.0|It fits fairly well, but I would like to see a pull tie and the base.  I use a bunge cord to hold the cover in place, otherwise the wind gets under it and can blow it off the grille.
B000FGGERC|5.0|i love this album so much that i listen to it alot,<br />so much so that im surprised im not tired of it.<br /><br />but im really not tired of it and i dont feel like i ever will be.<br /><br />i really, really love this album.<br /><br />it might be my favorite album.<br /><br />its definitely one of my all time favorites.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Overall challenging game with lots of replay capability. My 6 year old can play but that would be the youngest I would recommend.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|And because it's awesome. There is no blood in the game. When the car flips and he looks like he might break his head, there is no reaction or blood. This is nice because I am eight years old.
B000A0K2JO|5.0|Well constructed, performs very well, shipped well packed, quite satisfied. I need these to set up a secondary computer workstation and these fit the bill exactly.
B00992CF6W|4.0|the creepers and zombies are supposed to die in the sunlight, but they were just chilling in the water in the sunlight
0061950726|3.0|Having a Masters in History, I am glad to see this chapter in history receive more focus.  Vivian's story was well formulated.  Her experiences as an Orphan Train rider are very interesting and let the reader see the full spectrum of possible outcomes for these children.  What is really sad is the shame and stigma this issue had carried for so long.  It took two more generations (1930's- 1970's) for this experience to come to light.<br />What I thought was contrived and unnecessary was the characterization of Molly's foster parents.  They were pathetically mean Christians.  The woman, Dina, lays on the couch and watches HGTV while painting her toenails.  She is Pro Life, and a total tyrant.  The husband Ralph lets Dina run the show and never stands up to her poor treatment of Molly.  Really?  Sterotype much?  Evil Christians!!!!<br />I taught in the local Juvenile Detection Center for two years.  I didn't see any 'happily ever afters' there.<br />Imagine what it would be like if this social experiment were to be attempted today...?<br />This is a good book, read with a discerning eye.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|Got this for my daughter and she loved it! Listened to it all the time. it was a great gift
B002N44XSG|5.0|I really loved this clever addition to the Percy Jackson series. It was a good  light read to exercise my brain a bit before school  starts. Overall it's a very good book!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well, I had heard some praise about this book in the world of media and planet hollyweird. Didn't really know what the story was about, but was curious! Well, I was certainly surprised as I entered the world of bondage and how erotic it was!!!  It could certainly be entertaining with someone you really feel comfortable with! I found myself becoming really attached to these characters which is, of course, what the author was working toward. Glad I decided to give it a chance.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|pretty creative game that keeps you challenged. maybe more riddle style problems would make it even more challenging. I would like to see more floors.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|love this book and show. enjoyed watching all of the episodes that were available on netflix. so glad that i started this.
B00E9HML1Q|5.0|Why would anyone want to put a negative review on something they have not owned yet and have no intention of owning?<br /><br />It's like a vegetarian reviewing steak and giving it a one star. \\"I don't eat steak and I will not buy it. Meh.\\"<br /><br />I suggest amazon delete all these reviews including mine until the item goes on sale.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I'm a big fan of Neil Gaiman, so I tend to really enjoy anything he writes. This book is more of a novella, and it didn't surprise me to learn that it grew out of a short story that was just too long to be part of an anthology. It feels more like his short stories than his novels.<br /><br />That being said, Gaiman creates a compelling world and characters who stick with you long after you turn the last page. Definitely worth a read if you like Gaiman, but I would suggest Good Omens, American Gods, or the Sandman series to someone who is new to his work.
B00846REIS|2.0|First impression: ripoff of Fifty Shades.  Too much graphic sex without a real love story. Aggressive females can be/are  a turnoff.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Although there have been many other 'Godfather' editions in the past, this really is the definitive collection capturing the 3 films + extra's.  It truly is a classic of the American screen and like a fine wine...it grows better with age!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|It just didn't grab me..  The back story and romantic interest just fell flat.  Maybe I've been spoiled by some really good stories lately.
0316227706|5.0|A talented photographer, Seth Casteel, takes the most stunning photographs.  He not only takes these marvelous pictures, but he shares his talent in teaching other photographers.  From what I have read he teaches not only the underwater photos, but he teaches photographers to take pictures of animals in shelters.  The photos of animals, in shelters, make them look less sad, and through these pictures more animals are adopted!!  This is a good thing, and I have to respect someone who gives back.  I can't wait until his next book comes out!!
B003TFDXAW|5.0|Taught me more about Perot than I ever knew. Very well written. One of his best. It is easy to read.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I always like Nelson DeMille and especially John Corey. I read some negative reviews about the book being too much smart mouth by Corey but I enjoyed it, possible more so because I was just near where this took place in Yemen.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Enjoyed it and it was comical and full of action. Great to see older actors in this type of film.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I read this a`few years ago but when I learned Vince Flynn had died from prostrate cancer recently, I purchased all his books on Kindle as I was working in Afghanistan and re-read all of them. I am so sad about his passing, truly a great author with good instincts about how to handle terrorists issues.
B0037VIBGY|5.0|This movie is so sublime, so insane, so heartbreaking and beautiful and disturbing and hilarious, often times all at once. Tom Hardy really establishes his reputation as a genius chameleon powerhouse of an actor in this based on a true story of a tragic artist/monster fighting the whole world in the arena of the British legal/prison system. Sexy comic ultraviolence at it's pinnacle best!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I know, I spelled his name wrong.....Sorry.  This was a classic Tarentino screwball take on a spagetti western.  Funny and sarcastic as the same time.  Jamie Foxx was terrific and Christof Waltz is just remarkable.  What can I say?  The production values were off the charts.
B002Y2K2KA|3.0|this is one weird film, which will leave you asking questions such as is it all a dream, is the main character a ghost. You get no answers to these and other questions but its a good watch.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Best story yet from this author, I recommend all his writings.  Have you read The Kite Runner?  l loved this one as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|IT IS GREAT I Have a lot of fun playing this game I can just pull it out an  play it and have  lots of fun an  I love the new lair I  is a great game
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is fun and addictive. it will keep you coming back even when you want to give up. so good. worth it
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|Fun with different modes of play. Survival mode made me laugh and holler &quot;I'm gonna die!&quot; lol It will be a good one for when I want a little fast paced action, or even slow paced action.
0385486804|4.0|\\"I read somewhere...how important it is in life not necessarily to be strong, but to feel strong...to measure yourself at least once.\\" (Krakauer,Into the Wild) Jon Krakauer beautifully remembered the life of Christopher Johnson McCandless through the biography, Into the Wild. Christopher, aka Alexander Supertramp, believed in living life to the fullest, welcoming adventure and all the consequences with which is associated.  Living a typical upper middle class life, Chris a recent double major graduate from Emroy University, wanted to break away from all the materialist influence from his home and embark on his much anticipated adventure to Alaska.<br />  Christopher constantly challenged himself to find an adventure by taking responsibility in fulfilling his void in life; a true journey. He defiantly pushed his limits and allowed life to take him under its wing. Friends, memories, and many miles where accumulated during his travels as he continued to learn more about himself and the uncontrolled elements of nature. Down to his last breath he was able to stay strong to his motive and measure himself with the support and freedom of nature.<br />  Despite the scattered timeline of the written story, Into the Wild was a very enjoyable read. Christopher's journey is very inspiring due to his ultimate goal to live independent from material substances, however depended on the forces of his current natural surroundings. I would rate this book a seven out of ten and absolutely applaud the accuracy of Jon Krakauer. By publishing the inspiring life journey of Chris McCandless, Krakauer was truly able to fulfill Chris's motto, \\"Happiness only real when shared.\\"
0500516766|5.0|A wonderful book for a &#34;tinkerer&#34; or anyone who is interested in what's inside lots of different things. My only regret is that there doesn't seem to be any posters of the pictures - they would make great gifts.
B008CIUS72|1.0|This is simple app doesnt work on my kindle or android tablets wish i would of listened to the reviews. It opens but as a flash player no dice still need the right plugin or kindle and amazon to bring adobe back
B00AHJL7BK|3.0|I've been a big fan of Cross Sums since I was a kid.  I'm always looking for a good electronic version.  This version is okay but needs a lot of work.  The graphics look nice and the play is straight forward and not hard to grasp.  However... There is no way to create your own puzzles.  You can't choose a different puzzle of the same size if you don't like the one presented.  There should be a way to check for errors.  I'm also not a big fan of the base color of the game.  It would be nice if that was also configurable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable me: Minion rush ... it's the best game ever even for little kids I love the game SUPER addicting.
030789701X|4.0|And this one is full of everything you'd need to wander around Skyrim for hours and know where you're going.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Awesome the best game I ever played yet I don't like it I love it people should rate this game 100% 5
B009K916ZK|2.0|While this works just fine, the adapter is scuffed and the wire has a small crease in it as if someone has used this previously.  It's clearly a refurbished product or used and repackaged.  The price was much cheaper than the other ones on amazon when I purchased this, but I would have paid more for an actual new one. I didn't order used, I didn't want used.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have lots of fun, and it gives me stuff to work towards saving up my bananas. And my father had fun like me
B009NQZVKG|3.0|I have read a LOT of Mr. Rollins' work and have been a fan for some time.  I am dissapointed though that he never got the memo that one of the goals of eBooks was to bring down the costs.....
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really love this game it's super fun and I love playing it an  making all the family's:) I love the baby mammoths:) so cute:) they did really good  on  the animations and it make  it seen more alive then most games:) I really like it and hopefully they make another ice age movie! That would be freaking awesome!!!!!!:)
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|When I first downloaded this app it was originally for my 3 yr old son. Turns out I'm just as addicted as he is!!!! Would definitely recommend this to anyone.
1401216676|5.0|The history, the ending, the irony, the characters, the twist and most of all: The Joker. Everything that has ever made Batman great is done in a brilliant way here. The writing and art were already remarkable, but the re-colouring gave it a new meaning in the dreaming sequences.<br />  Actually, the only flaw from this will be if you don't agree with the material. Despite don't having any noticeable flaw, the graphic novel takes the beloved characters to places, situations and actions wich they never had been before or since, so in that way it is kinda polemic.<br />  Regardless, is fun and it will make you read several times.<br />  For fans of Batman comics, for psychology enthusiasts and for fan of good complex characters in general.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is a very amazing app and I highly recomend it to anyone with a good game in need! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR GET IT!!! (In a nice friendly way:)
B002CPMB9O|5.0|I thought that the video and sound quality of this movie was excellent for DVD!  The movie is a good story, good acting, etc., etc.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is one of the first apps u got and I use it just about everyday for work and home.
0670014893|4.0|Even in his less efficient pages, le Carre is a wonderful writer.  Never unhappy reading him.  All of his books are terrific
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This works perfect with my Kindle Fire. I misplaced my original cord and I was worried it wouldn't work as well as the original but it does
0425263916|5.0|The second book is even better than the first one. The plot is much more in depth, it is a mystery and erotic romance all in one.
1594746168|4.0|To be honest. I originally bought this book just for the fictional codex at the rear of the book, after going over that I found that the book was a good read, rather brief, but always interesting.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B005544V6A|5.0|This is another show with amazing writing & interesting story lines. The characters are unique & interesting (though now predictable) and their fast paced, witty banter between each other makes each episode speed by. The stories contain enough twists to prevent them from being totally predictable. This show is great fun.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book held my attention from the beginning to the end and wanting me to continue reading the next books from this set.
B005LAII62|5.0|This is a cute movie.  Keeps attention of the kids well.  Nice color and story line.  My 6 and 7 year olds love it.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is alright. Definitely will keep me busy when I am bored or on a long flight or something.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This program is so good even my husband loves it.We have a friend who is from England and she recommended it.The first time I watched the current live program on tv I called my husband in to just take a look and see. Well by gosh he stayed for the whole program.<br /><br />I love the scenery of the countryside and the interior of the manor. You are sharing the stories of each family member and the characters are so real.<br /><br />We really enjoy the commentary after the episode from one of the actors<br /><br />W hen I found the complete episodes from the beginning of the show I was estatic. Really glad I have Kindle Prime Membership. They were all free and brought me up to date on the program from the beginning.<br /><br />Highly recommend Downton Abbey. The story line includes the servents and what is happening in their lives.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|.<br />Very well done , kid friendly. A little laggy. Graphics are cool. There could be more info in the help section.
B000FA675C|5.0|I understand that this is fiction, and that Dan Brown played up rumors and stories about the Catholic Church (for the record, I'm not of the Catholic faith). Still, the story was exciting and well-written, and I thought it was a great read.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I have used Adobe Reader from the very beginning, and find it useful on all my computing devices.  Many manuals are pdf files and it's extremely useful to have on my mobile devices when traveling.  This is a must have app!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game!  Fun and addicting. I have never played this type of game before. I am really enjoying it. Challenging, but not too hard. You won't be disappointed.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I recently purchased a new Samsung Note 10.1 and wanted to transfer all my books from my Kindle.  After downloading this app, all my books were immediately downloaded from Amazon.  This will be great for all my future book purchases.  This is a great app - highly recommend!

B008Y6TF4Y|4.0|Really good movie, a must watch if you like suspenseful movies and surprise endings. It'll keep you guess till the very end a good set of actors. The movie not with its faults but if you can see passed some lengthy expositions then youll be in for some fun. I'm giving Saw a 4 out of 5 star! Watch it!
B00785P2QC|4.0|. wish u could view more info on buildings before u by them... like environment ratings and such.. some things cost to much to.. I understand u want our dollars but don't make it clear to impossible or no chance at all to buy certain things

1400052181|5.0|I was very happy with this book. Looked brand new, cover and pages were in perfect condition, as stated. Thank you.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|The best part about this movie is that it is based on a true story.  What a great movie to watch with your kids.
0375842209|5.0|This writer knows how to keep his reader captivated.  The approach from the Grim Reaper's story telling was very riveting.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I, like many others presumed that this would be a bad film. But boy was I wrong! I finally decided I'd give it a shot and I'm so glad that I did. I was immediately hooked when watching it and didn't want it to end. It's a truly brilliant film and it's a real shame that it flopped in cinema. I only hope that Disney somehow come back from this and bring another one but this time sell it!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|AWESOME! Love this game, just wish it was unlimited playing. It isn't a great feeeling to have only a certain amount of games to play per day
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|a few days ago, would have been a five star review, but now, after the update, will not open. I am disappointed as it was quite enjoyable and working fine until today.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This game is unlike other adventure games and would be a good game to start with. It is told in story form and the graphics are great. I really enjoyed the story.  There are a lot of hidden object and other types of puzzles, but it isn't just a hidden object game.  It has many chapters and you don't have to be a math whiz to enjoy it!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Could be a true story. Was funny, sad but a heartwarming story. Would recommend it for a book club read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is very very very very very cool I love this game it is an awesome movie I am glade a game of it
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|I love their work, Great Album!!!  They even do great recreating covers.  Youtube them NOW! You will love their videos!
052118939X|5.0|I have an old version of this book and paper was quite thicker and more suitable for pencil drawings than new one. Now it's more like glossy. Like magazines paper which looks cheaper for me.
B009AMAJPA|4.0|Not my most favorite Colin Farrell movie but still very good.  What I liked most about it was the twist to it.  The action could have been stringer, but it was decent.
1609611543|3.0|I read it.<br />Some interesting concepts.<br />Glad that Amazon cares about all customers.<br />GOOD JOB.  Keep doing always your best.<br />R.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|My daughter had to read this book for school, so it was in our kindle library. I started reading it on my flight from Florida to Calgary and was hooked. Couldn't put it down!!!
B0041KVXLK|5.0|I was about 15 years old when I bought this album for the first time (in mono)! About seven years later something happened in my life and I lost all my vinyl albums I collected untill then. Now, after some 40 years, I started recollecting my old vinyl collection and this was one of them.<br />As I collected most of the lost treasues buying them used, I thought this is such a milestone in music history that I wanted a brand new copy of this album. I don't regret!<br />It still has the same impact to me as it had so many years ago!<br />It's a &#34;must have&#34; in every record-collection!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Quite informative and varied..  Great radar map, but loop is too short .Would be better if it was longer. Would give 5 stars in that case.
B001B0G5WA|5.0|Everybody should have it!<br />Such a milestone in rock music!<br />Brian Wilson wrote a true masterpiece with beautifull compositions and stunning harmonies!
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|Well, I finally read Diary of a Wimpy Kid. I enjoyed the humorous escapades and misadventures of Greg and Rowly. I was disappointed about how critical and negative Greg was. I'm sure he would experience more success and happiness in his life if he tried to actually care about others and thought about life more positively. I kept waiting for some big climactic payoff in which Greg finally succeeded at doing something cool, but the story seemed to end rather abruptly with the Cheese touch scene. All the same, Jeff Kinney got me to buy in to his characters and I look forward to reading more about Greg Heffly's quest for belonging and recognition among his peers.
B000VFGSI2|5.0|Gould brings his tremendous talent, so evident in his many recordings of Bach's keyboard works, to bear on these Beethoven sonatas
B0070Z97LG|4.0|well done not horror show- pycho drama - Daniel Craig is believable -all around good date flick--or pop corn and beer
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|This guide to Scarface is clearly written by someone who is not only a fan of the movie but also an expert who has crafted a book which is both informative and extremely interesting.<br />I believe it would be impossible to walk away from this guide and still have questions about the film, the background and the making of the movie.<br />Detailed yet accessible this is a 'must have' for all fans of this cult film. The narrative is dotted with quotations, statistics and anecdotes which add depth to the knowledge learned about Scarface.<br />If this is the quality of the film guides this author can produce, then I look forward to reading more of them.
B000VX0416|5.0|I have been purchasing this particular shoe for more than twenty five years and I just love them. Very comfortable and good fit. Very please that Timberland has continued this shoe over so many years.
B004XCFR40|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much that I told my son to read it. He thought it was a ripper. There was humour, excitement, a tad of romance and just a touch of melancholy at the end. I would recommend this book for all ages. I will definitely read more by this author.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Totally Enjoyable!! You can loose an hour or more very quickly!  Can not wait to play again and have my friends join.
B00A83075M|5.0|I love this movie. A lot of fun for the kids and grown-ups. It reminds me of all the games I sued to play as a kid!
B0058YPGSY|4.0|I really don't have any input for a review. I bought this CD for my son-in-law's birthday gift..He's a big Sons of Anarchy fan..but, if he's happy with it, so am I.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I didn't think I could enjoy this as much as Before Sunrise but I was wrong.  Just as good and possibly a little better.  I loved the music and especially Nina Simone at the end of the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the minions...this is a fun and funny game to play!!!!<br />I am a little slow on getting the hang of it, but I am having a laugh while trying.
B0045HCIZY|5.0|This is a wonderful movie and very romantic.  Loved the dialog.  Ethan Hawke is great and I never appreciated him before.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS game is amazing and when your really bored its just really fun to play like seriously i was addicted to subwaysurf but then i found this game and IM ADDICTED!!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|You either love it or hate it (although as of the end of Season 3 it's starting to feel like Downer Abbey...)  That said, I can't wait for Season 4!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Everything was great until the game updated now I get stuck in el macho's lair. It loses all my information and is just a bad app now. Get it fixed and maybe it would be worth more stars.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Proof of Heaven is a verification of the book 'Heaven is Real'  that is why I rated &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; 5 stars because this story is an eye opener for non-believers.  In my opinion this is a must read book!!!!!
B00CMQX84A|5.0|teen beach movie is a awsome movie to just have fun with my. favorite part is the song is falling for you.
B001GA1RFA|4.0|This book is the novel equivalent of easy listening. Some of the themes are overworked, but as a story it all works quite well.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Growing up on Jurassic park that inspired me to become a paleontologist, I had high<br />hopes for this game.  It's a good pace that gives reasonable goals.  I personally don't understand any negative views on this game.  Great way to learn your dinosaurs, amusing during free time and better yet it's free!  Favorite game on my kindle as of yet.
1401937268|5.0|If you want a lighter version of tarot, this is an excellent deck.  Even friends who would normally steer clear of traditional tarot because of some of the darker cards seem to accept these angel tarot cards.  It's almost like angels make it ok for some folks.  Regardless, it is a beautiful deck and I am really enjoying it.
0385344228|5.0|Very well written - Surprise ending.  Held my interest till the end. Would make a great movie! Loved the set-up.  Writing style was clear.  Did a great job with the parenting issues.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|the three in one set has something for everyone viewing likes. The special features on the blu ray give the depth of the movie.
B000YABS8E|5.0|I never get tired of watching this movie!!! It is a fun filled and I enjoy the actors in the movie!
B002JVWRAE|5.0|To take on a subject that has many different points of view and put a new spin on it , is wonderful.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|This was the best when I first saw it when it came out. I don't know how many times I have seen it now but it is still fun and we enjoy showing it to friends when we all want to be in a good mood.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This blu ray is fantastic about giving the movie experience that pixar has painstaking done. To give us a glimps into another culture at the same time some wholesome family values.
B007X612AQ|4.0|A case of the streaming sites getting me to buy digital music<br />focused in on Froese via a Tangerine dream station I started on RDIO.  This collection looked like the best way in to get to really know his music.<br /><br />Very please so far
B004YM6JP0|5.0|this blu ray has so many wonderful way to give this awesome job that the writers of this show envisioned.
B00CLF80O0|3.0|Let me say that I'm a big latter day fan of Whitesnake material (with the Aldrich/Beach twin attack...and Brian Tichy is a monster).  But for anyone who's actually been to a recent Whitesnake concert or is able to pull up YT vids, it's painfully clear that Coverdale's best days are long behind him.  I'm willing to bet the vocals on this \\"live\\" CD were punched in after the fact (a la Halford and Unleashed in the East), no way can he sound this good at this stage.  Plus, as many others more astute than I have mentioned, the production is terrible. Which is a shame, because the guys in his band are killer good.
B003L77GHE|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of the season that has many more interesting details.  I am looking forward to many more surprises.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Fun game...my son loves it.  He has a great time buying property and buildings. Easy to use...even for younger kids.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|I liked the developing story line and variations on mini games. I did have to keep locking and unlocking my device to unfreeze the transition screens.<br />Enjoy
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game I can't stop playing it. It is so fun it dies my battery down. I love this game so much!
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|Filled my morning commute for a couple days. Fun and cute. Had a few glitchy moments, but nothing that interrupted game play long.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is probably the best book I have ever read. It made me laugh, it made me cry and it made me realize how lucky I am to have everything in my life...this book is amazing. The book is called \\" The Fault in Our Stars\\" but really, there was nothing wrong with it. It was perfect.
B004QX07G4|1.0|I love Ellen, but this book seemed disjointed to me. Perhaps my chakkrahs are misaligned. I feel bad that I was so disappointed.
1476733953|3.0|I read this because Justin Cronin(The Passage) gave it a solid review. While this book is compared to the Passage in some areas there is NO WAY it compares. Be prepared for a story in a very contained environment. For those GAMERS out there, imagine FALLLOUT 3 w/o ever leaving the underground compound. Ok Book and I will finish the series but I'm not psyched about it at all.
B003QSPTAY|5.0|My nieces thoroughly enjoyed this movie during their last sleepover and were excited to see the same version their mom and I watched. Both my husband and I had fun re-watching this movie, and especially enjoyed the songs, and outfits. It is a classic that all will love.
B0000042H4|5.0|First, some comments on the recording: played on a good turntable with an excellent cartridge tracking at less than 1 gram, the original LP recording is by far the best. On the LP recording, the opening bass note of Das Rheingold is riveting. You can feel it. On the CD version it is there and on the MP3 version it is probably there. The differences may not be quite that extreme but there is a definite drop-off through the media I have discussed.<br /><br />Now on to the question of the \\"Culshaw\\" sound. Some other reviewers have damned, condemned, ridiculed and otherwise blasted the sound of this recording as overdone, excessive, inaccurate, invalid and about everything else. They have done so without stating any other conditions, which in my mind only demonstrates their well-meaning, unintentional but gross ignorance. Years ago I used to be a minor operatic soloist. I participated in numerous rehearsals and sat just about every place you can sit in opera houses during rehearsals. I heard the sound from everywhere except the orchestra pit. I have also attended many live performances, the greatest of which was a world-class performance of Siegfried with world-class performers. Through absolute blind luck, I was given a ticket to sit stage center in the second row back from the orchestra. Let me tell you, a Wagnerian orchestra from less than 10 feet away is absolutely stunning, overpowering, extraordinary! You can absolutely localize every sound, the violins on the left, the bases and cellos on the right and everything else. When Siegfried plays his famous hunting horn solo you can tell precisely where it's coming from in the orchestra pit. You know it is not coming from his horn on stage. The vocalists, especially the Sopranos, absolutely blow you away. When Brunnhilde \\"let go\\" I felt like Charlie Brown in a baseball game as a ball shot back through the mound and he found himself spinning in the air. On the other hand, if you are sitting 40  or 50 rows back or for that matter up in the balcony, the sound isn't nearly as impressive and you can't localize sounds remotely as well. Everything blends together. The clear separation you experience close-up is lost. The reviewers who complain about sound are apparently accustomed to sitting farther back in the theater because that is the sound that is normally found on most operatic recordings. Based on my experience, Culshaw's Ring recording has put the listener stage center in the most expensive seat in the opera house. So, on the matter sound, you make the choice. Do you want to listen from the balcony or from the most expensive seat in the house? To those who condemned the sound of this recording, go sit in the second row and then rewrite your reviews. You may not like the valid second row sound but at least listen to it live before you make your final conclusion.<br /><br />I have to agree that there are some sound effects on the recording which were overdone. However the reverse is also true. This is especially obvious in Das Rheingold when we hear the gold being pounded in the underworld. Real gold bars from a bullion depository were used and the sound was thin, almost a \\"tink.\\" Not at all impressive but accurate.<br /><br />Soloists. There never has been a perfect operatic cast and there never will be, although there certainly have been a number of close ones. Unfortunately Caruso and Milanov were not contemporaries, nor were Caruso and Callas . Various reviewers have complained about the cast, stating that some voices were over the hill and others were inadequate. I can't argue with this but I do understand why certain people were chosen. For example, Kirsten Flagstadt was dying of cancer when this recording was made. Almost all of her great recordings were monophonic. To me, even though her voice may have been diminished, making Rheingold without her would have been unthinkable. This was the last chance to capture her voice in full stereophonic sound for posterity and I applaud Culshaw's choice. I leave the other cast choices and comments to you. I can live with Culshaw's choices and some of them were brilliant<br /><br />On to the orchestra. I have heard the Vienna  Philharmonic live in Vienna and on numerous recordings. They are always superb. No more need be said.<br /><br />Everyone seems to have their own ideas about which ring is the best. I'm not qualified to state which is the best and which is not. I leave that to the experts. There are other ring cycles I do like. I do not have the sophistication to comment on the specific differences between conductors and their interpretations of the score, although I certainly recognize them and can appreciate and in some cases not appreciate them. I can only say that I do like this recording of the ring and do not diminish any of the others in comparison. It is clear that if you ask many different people which cycle is the best you will come up with a number of different answers. It may simply come down to sophistication and personal preference. Nevertheless, I recommend this as very enjoyable recording  and one that I have enjoyed over the years.
B00138F7XI|5.0|This disc came out in 1995, shortly after the height of the Grunge era.  It was the year I graduated high school and Toto was a good example of a band in which I had no interest.  They were the slick remnants of the 80s, the very antithesis of the flannel-clad white-knuckled angsty rock that had been the soundtrack of my teen years.  It took many years before my tastes had broadened enough that I could appreciate something like this album, and I am glad that happened.<br /><br />Sure it's slick and produced, but there is also real feeling and emotion here.  The lyrics are often vague and sometimes even a little cliched, but they convey a sense of searching and longing that is bigger than just the words.  The music, polished and expertly crafted, also has a wide-open-sky kind of feel which is perfect for driving (at least where I live, in California).  Together they form something greater than the sum of their parts.  The ballads drag a bit but the epic scenescapes (Time Is The Enemy, and especially The Road Goes On) are moments of true and absolute beauty.  The instrumental Dave's Gone Skiing is a surprising slice of prog-rock awesomeness that reminds me of some of Rush's better instrumental pieces.  There is a lot to appreciate here and although it may be best digested in smaller bite-sized pieces, taken as a whole this is something of a masterwork.<br /><br />Toto is part of a genre that gets a lot of unfair criticism and oversight, and this particular era in their career seems to be particularly maligned by critics.  I can't understand why this hasn't changed over the years.  At any rate, as someone who has heard easily as much music as most rock critics (if not more) in many different genres, I can recommend this album very very highly.  It truly stands the test of time.

B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I love Channing Tatum, I love the Rock, I love Bruce Willis so can you imagine how happy I was that there was a movie with all three?  I'm usually easy to please when it comes to action movies but this was disappointing, There's a lot of action, but it lacked maybe flow or story, I'm not exactly sure.  It was kind of like a lot of little scenes put together.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|This pic delivered! I always have reservations when looking at Cruise's movies.  But, this one was very entertaining.  A little bit on the cooky cutter side, but good otherwise.
B00D7JGL36|2.0|While the music itself is timeless, this presentation leaves a lot to be desired.  While I do appreciate the effort, Vince Gill's singing just doesn't fit the genre of \\"the Bakersfield sound\\".  I have always been somewhat dubious of Paul Franklin's abilities and this reinforces my feeling that he is a journeyman at best and not the \\"master\\" that everyone tags him.  The mix has Paul so far in the background that he is often lost under the bass and drums.  Yes, he is probably the most recorded steel guitar player in Nashville and there are reasons for that that are best ommitted. I have been involved with and around country music for more that 65 years so I feel like I have the creds to use.  While others may differ, suffice to say that I personally wouldn't buy this CD again. Sorry, Vince.

B000FC1MCS|4.0|While it isn't quite a modern day \\"grapes of wrath\\" or \\"silver linings playbook\\". The book is a first person narrative told by a character that suffers from behavioral issues, in this case he is autistic or perhaps has aspergers. It is impossible not to be drawn into the story and the characters, yet the perspective makes it difficult to know what is coming next.  The length and pace make the book a very light weekend read, and will be of particular interest to people interested in psychology or behavioral health, without wanting a deep dive.  I enjoyed it quite a bit.
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|This is Mezco's second Breaking Bad action figure (the first of which was Walter White in Hazmat suit from the episode \\"fly\\"). This figure is Walter White as his drug dealing alias \\"Heisenberg\\". People have said that this isn't an action figure because the waist and legs and arms aren't articulated, while that is a bummer, this still is an action figure. Heisenberg comes with a removable hat and sunglasses, a duffle bag full of cash, a bag of 99.8% of the pure blue crystal, and has a revolver sculpted into his right hand. Also, I really like the attention to detail Mezco displayed by really accenting Walter's wedding ring on his right hand. A small detail but a very important one, after all Heisenberg exists so Walter can provide for his family.<br /><br />While I can understand peoples valid complaints about the lack of articulation, it doesn't matter to me because I am keeping this figure blistered to its card. The card looks like the opening title for Breaking Bad on AMC with a green background and the Breaking Bad table of elements logo and a side profile shot of Bryan Cranston as Walter White in his Heisenberg outfit. The  head sculpt  looks good and pretty accurate to the source. As well as the style of clothing and the body sculpt, only the coloring is not source accurate. The jacket and pants are all black and the figure is wearing a maroon shirt, never once in the show does Heisenberg wear this outfit. Mezco should have made the pants Khaki and painted the shirt with a plaid design, but this is Mezco and they put their own style into the license's they tackle so this doesn't bother me much. Though I can see how it may bother collectors and purists.<br /><br />I am an action figure collector and I am hard pressed to find action figures based off of currently produced television shows for adults. The Walking Dead is the only other license that comes to mind. The packaging and sculpt are great, the figure comes with some awesome accessories and though the articulation is limited and the paint scheme is not source accurate, that's ok with me. The paint apps are great, no bleeding or missed spots, the hat and sunglasses fit great, the overall look for the figure is great and any fan of the show needs to get their hands on one of these before they are hard to find and jump in price.

B008A36R2Y|4.0|This board is great given the form factor.  I like having the surface mount ATMEL chip given the low profile.  In my experience the Arduino is a tough little board.  I have never had to replace the ATMEL chip so the socket was not a feature I required.  Also given the mini USB connector is a plus.  All of the other boards I have use this size of connector.
B00ANGSSWS|5.0|Not nearly as heavy as I was hoping for from them, but it was a grand listen.  Every song felt like it told a story, and that's why I keep coming back to the Black Veil Brides.  They have a great sound and amazing lyrics.

0767919408|5.0|I started this book after reading EIFFEL'S TOWER, going from 1889 Paris to this overview of the United States in the summer of 1927, as brought to life by the inimitable Bill Bryson, and it was quite a ride. Chronicling the events beginning in May when several teams of aviators prepare to compete for a $25,000 prize offered by Raymond Orteig for a nonstop New York-to-Paris (or vice-versa) flight (among the bigger names participating is a Minnesota unknown named Lindbergh, who will be flying a tiny aircraft in which the pilot can't even see out the front window) and ending in September, Bryson paints \\"the Roaring Twenties\\" in big, colorful brushstrokes, a decade--and a summer--when the United States and not Europe began to make news.<br /><br />In a sprawling narrative joined by the thread of Lindbergh's flight and subsequent fame (which appalled the reserved airman) celebrated by an exhaustive tour of the United States, Bryson introduces us to the other colorful characters of the era: \\"Big Bill\\" Thompson, the mayor of Chicago, who wasn't big on intelligence, but who had a loyal political following; Ruth Snyder and Judd Gray, whose murder of Snyder's husband was as big as the OJ trial; Herbert Hoover, the superlative organizer and engineer whom no one had ever seen laugh; Al Capone; hard living and hard playing Babe Ruth; the quiet powerhouse Lou Gehrig; taciturn Calvin Coolidge, who kept his nose out of other people's business--including the thousands displaced by Mississippi River flooding; Henry Ford; the big fight between Jack Dempsey and Gene Tunney (broadcast over radio by a mellifluous newcomer named Graham MacNamee); and Sacco and Vanzetti--to name just a few. We are taken from Prohibition Chicago to the sky over the Atlantic to Mount Rushmore; from ballparks to hotels to the top of a flagpole where \\"Shipwreck Kelly\\" holds everyone's attention. We also meet the unhappy realities of the time: the racists especially embodied by the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan, the eugenicists who believe \\"the unfit\\" should be sterilized, the criminals brought to fame by Prohibition, even the United States government poisoning their own citizens with alcohol additives to curb drinking.<br /><br />This book is like paging through a delightful set of snapshots of a bygone era; don't expect much depth, but that's not what the book is all about. My only caveat is that I found an obvious historical error, and, not knowing all the details of 1920s history, wonder there could be more. No matter--pick your favorite aspect of this book and research it more thoroughly--this book just makes you want to pick up other books about the era--but in the meantime enjoy this breezy portrait of 1927 America.<br /><br />(For more on Charles Lindbergh post-1927, please consider THOSE ANGRY YEARS.)n, the eugenicists who believe \\"the unfit\\" should be sterilized, the criminals brought to fame by Prohibition, even the United States government poisoning their own citizens with alcohol additives to curb drinking.<br /><br />This book is like paging through a delightful set of snapshots of a bygone era; don't expect much depth, but that's not what the book is all about.

B00DHNJGCU|3.0|I have to be honest; I fell asleep after about the first 30 minutes into the movie...as did my fiance and our two friends. There was a good amount of action, but a little hard to follow what was going on and then I got a little bored...hence, the falling asleep. I started to watch it again from the beginning the next day, but again, started to get bored even quicker. I almost never fall asleep during a movie, but this one for some reason made me tired two times in a row. Probably not the fairest review since I didn't watch the whole thing, but thought it was worth mentioning.
0767919408|4.0|Bill Bryson is an author who makes history come to life. I have always enjoyed his work, and I ended up reading One Summer (400+ pages) in a little over a day. Like many of Bryson's other works, this book just captured my imagination from the opening page and held onto it throughout.<br /><br />=== The Good Stuff ===<br /><br />* I had never really considered 1927 to be all that special a year, but this book made it seem to be one of the most interesting patches of American History. Bryson does a masterful job of interweaving Charles Lindbergh, Babe Ruth, the stock market, prohibition and a few other topics into a single narrative. In doing so, he points out a number of relationships that I sort of knew, just forgot to think about. For example, I was surprised to realize that Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic before soundtracks were added to pictures.<br /><br />* The book is full of facts that I had never read before. I never knew that Zane Grey earned more than ten times the amount that F. Scott Fitzgerald ever made from writing, or that Grey led a life that would have shocked most of his fans. The book is full of such facts and observations, and I enjoyed reading them.<br /><br />* Bryson captures a personal side to many of the people in his book. I had never appreciated how much of a social misfit Charles Lindbergh really was, and can only imagine the pain that years of being a A-list celebrity caused him. It seemed like the man couldn't brush his teeth without a parade and speeches. Similarly, it was amazing political scandals, Hollywood gossip and shady business dealings are as common in the 1920's as they are today.<br /><br />* The book takes a broad view of topics, and manages to touch on just about everything that seemed important in either the 1920's or today. Sports, movies, radio and television, crime and punishment, thrill seekers, technology, business, law and politics are all interwoven throughout the book.<br /><br />=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===<br /><br />* I am not really a fan of the format of the book. Bryson likes to tell relatively simple narratives, but branch off at every opportunity into the background or other related details of some part of the story. It makes the text somewhat hard to follow, and it is not easy to keep the chronology straight as you read. The end result is the book appears somewhat disorganized and haphazard in its organization.<br /><br />* There are many details of events covered that I had never read before. I read a lot of history, so this either suggests a book that is either very well or quite poorly researched. Normally I would spot-check a few references, but the proof copy I had does not have the references listed.<br /><br />* Bryson has a habit of stating opinion as fact, and of simplifying issues beyond what is reasonable. For example, he lays the blame for the Great Depression solely on a decision by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in 1927. I would agree that it didn't help the situation, but the economic collapse of the US had many factors leading up to it. It is inaccurate and overly simple to blame any one action.<br /><br />=== Summary ===<br /><br />The positives far outweighed the negatives, and I very much enjoyed this book. It is written in a fast-moving and easy-to-read style, and made excellent summer reading for a history fan like me. At first I was concerned that 1927 was just not all that interesting a time, but the book touched enough different areas, and crossed into other time periods, so it ended up being enjoyable and relevant. I'd definitely recommend it to any history buff.r /><br />* I am not really a fan of the format of the book.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|As this novel is from the author of \\"What Alice Forgot,\\" I was anticipating a good read. I was not disappointed. Though I found the pacing a little off - the beginning was quite slow for me- I'm glad I stuck with it. The characters were multi-dimensional, the setting good, the premise intriguing and the storyline was strong. The plot of the story was a bit obvious, but the author added some twists and turns along the way that left the outcome a bit doubtful. I am glad to say she wove it all into a satisfying ending; and used a different writing technique to close the book.<br />*I received my copy from NetGalley.com in exchange for an honest review.

Do much has been written and speculated about this movie and the nuggets in it, can't add anymore.  If you haven't seen it and are not a Science Fiction fan, pass it.  Pure Science Fiction with all the thinking that goes along with it.

B00DCRE83S|4.0|Jason started a new chapter of his musical career when he released the \\"Metal\\" EP a few months ago under the band name Newsted.  The four songs on that EP were a perfect sampler of what Jason's first full-length album would hold.  This CD is comprised of eleven songs that could all be described as basic heavy metal, with music similar to old-school, Motorhead-inspired speed metal, some groove-heavy riffs that sound like the better-sounding parts of Load, Re-Load-era Metallica, and some Testament-style thrash, but more simple.  For music like this to appeal to me, which Jason has openly stated is meant to be basic, it needs to get my head banging, or my foot stomping, or my fist pumping.  Newsted gets it done on most of these songs.  The riffs aren't complicated, but they're powerful and have a good, heavy groove.  I might complain about the solos, which mostly sound like Load-style hard rock solos, or the drums, which are nothing to get excited about.  Then again, these songs are simple enough that a Gene Hoglan-caliber drummer might not sound right with the music.<br /><br />The two big highlights of the album for me are Soldierhead and Long Time Dead.  Those are the two that have the most speed metal influence, and where Newsted seems to have its most potency.  Soldierhead was on the \\"Metal\\" EP, and was the first song Jason released with this band.  It's the album's fastest, most thrashy track.  Long Time Dead has some infectious vocal lines during the verses and a great upbeat Motorhead bounce.  On the down side, I don't see much going for As the Crow Flies or Above All, which are both slow to mid-paced, generic, and kind of forgettable.  The main riff in Above All gives the word basic a whole new meaning.  All of the other songs hit the four-star mark for me.  They're above average, have a nice mix of slower and faster sections (although I could use a lot more speed overall) and often have very catchy vocals that will stick in your head.  My favorites of the four-star songs are Heroic Dose, Ampossible, King of the Underdogs (also from the EP), Nocturnus, and most of Twisted Tail of the Comet (the first half borrows a lot from Children of the Grave, which is ok, but then it changes in the middle and gets fast at the end).  I think this is a good debut from Jason and shows a lot of promise.  I'm hoping he does something with this band and makes it into an actual force in metal.<br /><br />**Edit, 8-21-13:  After listening to the album for a couple of weeks, I've grown to like Above All quite a bit more than at first.  It's very basic, like I originally said, but the vocal melodies, chorus, and even that super-basic main riff are so catchy they can't help but grow on you.  I'm also promoting Kindevillusion to one of my favorites, and Futureality is really good, too.  I'm still not too fond of As the Crow Flies, but it's not bad.  I sincerely hope this same line-up puts together a second album at some point.**r-star songs are Heroic Dose, Ampossible, King of the Underdogs (also from the EP), Nocturnus, and most of Twisted Tail of the Comet (the first half borrows a lot from Children of the Grave, which is ok, but then it changes in the middle and gets fast at the end).

1781162646|5.0|I've been a long time Stephen King fan and have been a little disappointed in the last few books.  They always started off strong, then sort of fizzled at the end.  This book was a pleasant surprise.  The storyline was solid and held my interest all the way through.  As always, King's character development is superb.  Not the normal supernatural thriller but a very good story.
B0031QVW2U|4.0|Well worth the money, the BRAD snugly secures the over-the-shoulder BlackRapid strap from moving about or falling off. Removable clip allows for easy removal of Black Rapid strap. The webbing clips could be a tad bit wider to prevent the main BR-strap from becoming twisted and bunched, but overall this accessory is a well designed and highly recommended modification to the BlackRapid family of products (The BRAD is compatible with the RS-1 through RS-5 straps).
B007KUFDBY|4.0|I remember when I first saw this movie in theaters and was blown away by the marriage of 2D and 3D animation (especially being an aspiring animation student at the time). Silver was done extremely well and I thought that would be the future of feature animation. Turns out I was a little off.<br /><br />If you look at this movie from a conceptual perspective it's very bold and daring. You take a classic story and give in a sci fi spin, not exactly the easiest thing to do. Then consider Disney was trying to capture a more male audience and you wish this would have done better. It would be nice to have male oriented movies that are a little more edgy with Disney style animation vs. the princess stuff which turns people towards Anime.<br /><br />The environmental designs are fantastic as are all the ship designs. Aliens crew members could have been a little better, but if you like artistry in Disney movies this is a good one.<br /><br />The story however falls a little flat, especially when BEN comes into the picture. My one big problem with this movie is it was never sure what it wanted to be. You have an angsty teen looking for purpose in the world which appeals to a more teen based audience (which is fine). Then you have the annoying, slap stick, and extremely LOUD side kick that takes it down to a &#34;child&#34; movie. The marrying of the concepts works great, the marrying of these two themes don't. I feel Atlantis suffered a little from this as well.<br /><br />Over all a good movie, and great on Blu Ray. Just don't expect a fairy tale.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|This app provides all the financial data I need and it's easy to use. It not only provides up-to-date information (yields,,P.E ratio, earnings, and more; it also includes graphs for each investment that you input.
034580709X|4.0|This book tells it all, where it all began, how Harry started his investigative career and how he really pronounces his name.  It give insight into the real Harry Hole and his investigative techniques.  It introduces the tormented detective Harry Hol leh and his battle with alcholism and his relentless pursuit of killers and cases.  I wish I had read this book before the others.  A great read.
0425252868|5.0|This book is so well written and so very interesting! It would be wonderful if someone would make it into a movie (or even a documentary with reenactment)! I loved it!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love these game I love because I can play with friends and never get old expected with u run coins an  it just die to play so if u love uno buy if u don't try it it does hurt to try
B009XIXVU6|5.0|After reading other reviews I was skeptical about buying this.  I couldn't put it down!  I liked the way the author developed the characters and was able to tie them all together in the end.  I enjoyed reading The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, so I was anxious to see what the author could do with this one.  I am happy to say I was not disappointed.  I like the historical perspective, but unlike the other two novels, we were spared the harsh treatment of the characters that was sometimes hard to read.  I consider it a bit more reader-friendly.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I was on the fence about buying this vinyl box set.<br /><br />I wanted to purchase it as soon as it came out. The reason I did not, was because I had read here and on another forum, that the pressings were poor. I heard people had off center labels, spindle holes that weren't cut right, no fill problems, warped records....you name it.<br /><br />I don't know whether I was lucky, or if there really were a lot of problems early on, and that they now have been corrected. Whatever the case, my set is perfect. The records are flat, the labels are centered properly, the records are quiet, the packaging is amazing.....and that is all before we get to the music.<br /><br />I own the 2009 CDs in both stereo (minus Help and Please, Please Me) and mono (box set). I must say, these vinyl records are the very best format I have ever enjoyed this music on. I got my set a couple of weeks ago, and I have been playing them non stop, looking for any flaws. I have found none, and am amazed at how beautiful they sound. In my home, I may never listen to The Beatles on any other format again, until the mono vinyl comes out.<br /><br />I own several vinyl box sets, including The Stones and The Who. I rank this among the finest for the quality and sound of the vinyl. It is the very best, as far as presentation, value (beautiful, collectible, hard bound book) and packaging.<br /><br />Thank you Beatles and EMI.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon for another perfect transaction. The box was shipped inside a box, with styrofoam insert support, nice and tight. Great work!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app I'm addictid play it everyday the best game ive played in so long overall its awesome
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I love this case and charger.  You don't have to charge the case but maybe twice a week.  And I wear my headset everyday
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is a totally awesome game I think every one one of you should have it and it is also kind of addictive.
0120884674|4.0|This was a very helpful book, I received it quickly. the pictures were clear, and it made for a great companion guide
B002JXK5VU|3.0|My son recommended; the concept is interesting, and the cast consists of many good actors.  This series is much better than the current Dome on TV today.  Realistically, I've only watched a couple of episodes.  We'll see if it keeps my interest.
B004QOB8SO|4.0|I have enjoyed the Sherlock series when it has been on the BBC.  Benedict Cumberbatch is a talented actor, and Watson is quite the fellow.
034580404X|5.0|Both sets were in great condition. I gave them as gifts and both friends feedback was great reading.  they both had no idea of subject matter and was very surprised. They both wrote saying I loved it.
1611761921|5.0|I really enjoy the unabridged versions. As I was doing a lot of travlling they are ideal as you can listen to the story whilst looking around so you don't miss anything.
B000FC130E|5.0|I'm new to Neil Gaiman. Sort of a literate Harry Potter for adults. Pretty much couldn't put it down. Read this and The Anansi Boys in a tear. Great great reads.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really great app that keeps you on your toes and your fingers moving!  From dodging cars, to ducking under fire pits, to riding the fluffy unicorn....this game is full of excitement!  Love it!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This was a wonderful app until the update. Now it wants to tell you everything but the weather. You cannot even read the words that are about the weather on top of the daytime pictures.  Do the developers not use this app either? I have tried to learn to use it, but I just hate it more every time. I am deleting it.
B0061S0A64|5.0|Works a bit like a mind mapping tool but with music.  It's fun and nice colors.  Definitely would recommend it.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Quite a different take on the zombie genre. It's short interviews with apocalypse survivors that all have different views on the fictional Zombie War. I liked it as it was a different way to present a story.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|A good story just not great. He is a great writer just doesn't always hit the mark. If I am being fair it is as good as most of his other stuff. Not a big fan but wanted to give him another chance. An okay read though:-)
B005LAII44|1.0|The movie started off not too bad, but, the acting was bad.  The Rock would have done better to stay in the ring and why, oh why, did Bruce Willis do this.  Was he hard up for money?  Finally, as a retied Marine, I was insulted to see the female lead TRYING to wear a Marine Corps uniform that was no where near what the uniform looks like.  An insult to the Corps.  I wish I could get not only my money back but the time I wasted watching it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Enjoy this app with my girls.  They beat me 5mil to 1mil!  I like the fact they have power ups and you can continue on if you have a mishap.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I think this is a great game!!  Been wanting it on my Kindle Fire some time now.  So, thanks for finally adding it.
B00005NKK8|5.0|This CD brought back so many memories of past decades.  I can listen to it over and over again.  Perfect for a summer afternoon.
B00COHIFQS|4.0|The movie kept me entertained from start to finish although the end left me with a lot questions. Overall I liked it.
B0002ZMITY|4.0|If you are a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen then this is a must have. Decent extras as well. .
B000SO7OL6|5.0|I love this album. It makes the house feel better - I feel like even if things are all together, life is snazzy and sassy - get me a glass of wine, please.
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|I've given over my Kindle to my grand daughter to play games.  I don't seem to have the knack for using it.  She loves the games.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wish I had read this before seeing the movie. However, there was no disappointment from reading this. The author is great and I cannot wait to read the others!
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|Not my favorite Jane Eyre movie. The actress that pays Jane is too passive and barely speaks. She makes it hard to connect with her or to feel her agony. I liked the actor that plays Mr. Rochester better than some I have seen. He is gentler...not quite so mean that it makes it hard to like him. Over all it was ok.... but not my favorite.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is the second Quell game that I purchased. They are addictive,  challenging and fun. I recommend. for all ages.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|It was a great thing to see my son so happy to watch Cars for the first time!  Good moment.
B009AMANBA|1.0|This had to be the most boring movie of the year, at least it was for me.  And I was not all that impressed with Daniel Day Lewis's acting either and am always annoyed when the Best Actor awards seem to usually go to actors and actresses who study films of real-life people and then do their best to imitate them.  I would think it is much more difficult to create an original character rather than copy someone's mannerisms and speech.  And then there's Spielberg's direction...slow, labored, darkly lit, with his expected sensationalized Civil War tableaux filled with piles of dead bodies and body parts, something he loves to do apparently, as in \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" \\"War Horse,\\" \\"Schindler's List,\\" etc.  I just did not think this film was very original or very interesting and mostly could not wait for it to be over.  I'm amazed at the critical acclaim it received and think it is highly over-rated, simply because of the presence of Spielberg and Lewis.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I love discovering new authors.  The book is thought provoking without being heavy.  Made me contemplate how we remember our youth and how it creates who we are today.very good and a definite retread!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK.  I ENJOYED THE INTRIGUING STORIES OF CHRISTIAN AND ANASTASIA. I REALLY LOVED WHEN ELENA WAS TOSSED OUT OF THEIR LIVES. GRACE REALLY SURPRISED ME WHEN SHE SLAPPED ELENA. I WOULD LIKE TO READ ANOTHER BOOK BY EL JAMES.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Took a lot of attention to keep track of where this had been and where it was going. Would be better If viewed more than once.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I chose this rating because it was really good.<br /><br />I liked that there r pictures in every book to help tell the story.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to people who like funny books!!
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Enjoyed this as a mental recreation and no extra thought needed. Nice graphics and special effects. Would recommend to others.
B002RV01Q8|5.0|Anything Enya sings is great.  Hard to describe this CD/DVD .  Either you like her style or you don't..  I would recommend it to anyone who likes her as this is the &#34;Best&#34;  of her songs to date.
B00646UU5Y|4.0|Am a Sci Fi fan and this was a fun series to watch. Much enjoyed it and would recommend it to others.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game woot woot so much fun realising them into the wild and getting them back soot woof woot
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I watched this, but it was alittle short on action and originality.  Would not recommend it to others, but not terrible..
B000TEUSJK|1.0|Only seen less than 15 minutes and eject and feed it thru my paper shredder to it's final resting place. Disgusting to women and men, for how could people do this to one another in that era and be proud of it. DISGUSTING!!!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|would not download, kept freezing or just would not download to my grandson's kindle and he really wanted this. tried several times and never would download.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Excellent book, one of his top best. Highly recommended, especially if you like alternate history, time travel, and a little bit of sci-fi.
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|This is the ultimate guide to the movie Scarface.  Everything you wanted to know is in here.  Even details about the shooting, actor selection and how many of the things from this movie have entered into our daily lives in the form of comments we make...like \\"say hello to my little friend.\\"<br />This is a short but worthy excursion into the making of a classic movie.  I really think you'll enjoy the journey.  Nice job done by the writer.  Evidence of a lot of research here.
B000Y1ZXU2|3.0|I felt it could have been more than 1 song. The music, artwork and computerwork are great, but just one song? could and should have been more for the price
B006M7JCC2|5.0|My friend told me about this book, I ordered it, and read it fast.  I love the way she writes, I know its real, and so affirming.
1878424319|5.0|I have been buying this book for years.I keep it by my bed for reminders each day and buy it for family and new friends.<br />always try to keep an extra one in closet.I have probably bought 50/75 over the years,I used to get the local book store<br />to order it but amazon is much easier
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's simple and works just like a real calculator.  What else to you need?  Just this!  It does exactly what it's supposed to do.
B007KCG7MQ|3.0|EN: Joe Walsh is a big thing of rock, he doesn't need the Lynne's style to sweeten his music. As a matter of fact this album is more a Lynne work than Walsh's. Lynne plays the bass, guitars and drums in the most songs.<br />Finally you've got a kinda ELO/Lynne nice album rather than a sarcastic and troublemaker Walsh rock album.<br />It's good to have a new album by Walsh in two decades but Joe and Jeff don't go together well,  to create rock at least...<br />___________________<br />ESPAÑOL: Joe Walsh es un grande del rock, no necesita el tonillo de Lynne para edulcorar sus canciones. Lynne toca el bajo, las guitarras y la batería en la mayoría de las canciones. Así tienes una especie de bonito disco de ELO/Lynne más que del rock gamberro y sarcástico de Walsh.<br />Está muy bien tener un disco nuevo de Walsh en dos décadas pero Joe Y Jeff no pegan haciendo rock...
B005OP7162|5.0|Good plot and good acting. Great to watch while staying in and avoiding the hot summer days!<br /><br />Keeps you on your toes with lots of unexpected twists and turns. It is fun to watch the &#34;bad guys&#34; get what's coming to them.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|The language was crude at times but there were several times I laughed out loud!  It was fantastic told from the guy's point of view giving us a good look at just how the male species thinks and acts.  Drew could be a real jerk at times but the key word here is REAL.  That's what made him so utterly charming. Beneath all the cocky swagger and crude manner beat a heart of gold and when he fell in love he fell hard. Can't wait for the next book in the Tangled series.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Wonderful cast and great show.  The writing is awesome and I look forward to watching the rest of the seasons!
B007RRFUHM|5.0|If you have a chance to sample the songs- please do! Every song is a different sorry, this is the kind of music that can be played anywhere you are.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|So happy to watch this, shows like a broadway musical but well written and acted! Love love Katharine McPhee! Try it you'll like it!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved to this story.  Being an adopted child myself, I could relate to Victorias difficult journey to find love and connection for herself. Her need for solitude and her fear of touch and abandonment. Vanessa Diffenbaugh weaves a beautiful story, a story of love and our human desire to feel deeply connected to something or most importantly to ourselves. I loved how the flowers and their meanings are weaved beautifully into the story. I would definitely recommend this book, especially to adoptees, or adopted parents, wonderful book.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Adult fantasy is not my ideal genre but once in awhile it is nice to open something different.  Good description and characters.  Not the greatest book ever but entertaining nevertheless.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like the fact that it's like real puzzles. You can choose  to break it down to a small group of pieces or to about up to 250 pieces. You can also buy more puzzle packs. Some are even free and only use this one app.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Kids love it! I love it! Lots of fun for all of us. Need to have a way to earn Gru points, don't like a game that forces you to buy stuff with real money in order to move forward. Would be 5 stars if not for that.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The new changes make the app harder to get to what you want to see. I tried to click on weather info and got the gift stuff and I can't get rid of it. The changes were at the same time which made maneuverability difficult. I don't like the change of the map.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was a success. It started as a sci-fi book than became a book of literature. It really was a good book.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This app is an awesome game. A bit like Sim city, but a lot more simplistic. I think you should make a computer version of this game.
B009ICQ6KO|2.0|Sometimes CD's take a couple of playing's before I grow fond of them. That never happened with this CD. It's not that I don't like it completely, but it sounds unfinished, like a demo. Once I saw the DVD that came with it, I was convinced it was a demo. I expected a little more polish and structure to it.
B00992CF6W|3.0|There might be a little glitch that me and my sister discovered while playing on her world. I went to tap on the chat thingy and my kindle screen went a grey color and I was able to hit the on/off button and it would turn black to grey and then it became unresponsive and it stayed like that all night this also happened to her kindle fire HD to so if that is a glitch pleaseeeeee fix it.
B009DH379C|5.0|If you are a Queen fan do not walk, run and buy this great bluray. The quality is so amazing. Freddy is in fine voice. The transfer from film to bluray is amazing. I was very fortunate to see Queen twice. I am so lucky to have this time capsule. Enjoy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super addictive cute game. Love to play with friends and family. I highly recommend it for everyone. Absolutely awesome! *****
B00CUWKHVI|5.0|This is a more consistent album than his previous The Pursuit. All tracks are very solid. Recording is first rate. Only track I don't care for is the Cole Porter song &#34;Love For Sale&#34;. Other than that it is another great cd from one of my favorite  performers.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|An amazing look into the greed, corruption, and blatant disregard for any moral footing on Wall Street pre 2008. The fact that this crisis should have been so obvious to so many people, yet was either ignored or glossed over, is disgusting. A great read. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to gain any real understanding about what actually led to the financial crisis of 2008, and why we are still recovering from it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great time waster. the minions are adorable. recently added a third location to run. I would like it if the weekly challenges were still available.
B000C13Y2S|1.0|its a piece of rubbish dont buy very cheap product<br />although it seems that the seller used to sell a high quality ones years ago from the review i see here only old buyers rate it high.<br /><br />but for now dont waste your money its nothing like what you see in the picture.
B0055S348W|5.0|The best app I've had EVER. It found my printer right away. Works with all my programs. Copy paste anywhere doesn't matter. I've tried a bunch of printer apps and thought there was no app out there, but  this app does it all. Great going guys
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great time consumer. Not difficult to play. Really a lot of fun. Sucks that you end up with no coins quickly but it regains its maximum amount within time.
0345529057|5.0|not much more to say, love the books and the hbo sereis. wish i had started reading the books sooner.
B000SNUMFC|5.0|I rarely write reviews, but this performance of Lisa Batiashvili of the Sibelius concerto deserves one. I love this concerto, it is my favorite for violin and orchestra and I think she nailed it. Surely I wouldn't throw away my records of Leonidas Kavaakos, Pekka Kuusisto and Hilary Hahn, but I put Batiashvili performance together with these as my favorites. Very expressive but not mellow as the awful Anne-Sophie Mutter performance. The tempo is sometimes a little faster (specially on a few orchestral passages) than I am used to, but not nearly breakneck fast as Jascha Heifetz, that plays brilliantly but way too fast for me.<br /><br />Very recommended.
B008RJFRTK|5.0|App is great. I have wifi only unit and this is fantastic.  Havent found any errors yet.<br />Took road trip through utah, aarizona nevada and it really came in handy.  Soooo much easier than paper, andcsaved time by not havingvto reroute the gps.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|No hints or suggestions on what to look for or how to get it. I'd like to play the game...but the frustration level isn't worth the effort. So I'll probably delete it Money lost...lesson learned.
B009MYARIK|5.0|This is a great summer read. It is entertaining, Sophie Kinsella at her best. I enjoyed the characters and had to laugh out loud a few times If you are looking for an amusing story, this is it.
B00077F948|5.0|John Williams is often accused of clinical playing, but he obviously enjoys playing this beautiful music. Being technically skilled should never detract from the picture as long as the emotional content is intact, and to my ears these perfomances are unbeatable. Extreme detail, impeccable flow and great sensitivity is a real treat when combined as beautifully as here. I have listened to this album countless times and it still grows on me and brings a tear to my eye.<br /><br />I own John Williams' previous Barrios album as well. It is good - but this new recording is vastly better, both musically and soundwise. John Williams may have felt a need to pay an extra tribute to the composer since he chose to re-record basically the same selection of pieces. The result fully justifies the effort.<br /><br />The music itself is probably the finest romantic guitar music ever written for guitar. Most of the popular and spectacular \\"guitar classics\\" - e.g. Albeniz - are actually transcriptions. And the 19th century virtuoso composers - e.g. Sor and Carulli - were not capable of producing a fraction of the musical substance displayed here.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|It is just clumsy and hard to use...with time, it gets a little easier, but not smoother.  Good buy for the price.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Peter Jackson has taken a book which is light, fun and fast-paced, and has made a movie that is enthusiastically imagined but ponderous with additions. These additions betray Jackson's and Fran Walsh's peccadilloes: cutesy characterizations, a love of gross-outs, and an obstinate refusal to rein in any detours in the story.<br /><br />That refusal is one of the weakest parts of the movie: By hour two I just wanted them to get to the damn Mountain already. I saw no narrative reason for the movie to end where it did, nor to take so long to get there.<br /><br />More objectionable even than that, however, is the tremendous massacre that Gandalf and the dwarves inflict on the goblins under the Misty Mountains. Yes, the dwarves were taken captive, and their lives were in danger. But, as Gandalf urges them to \\"Fight! Fiiiight!\\" he and the dwarves start a no-blood-in-evidence bloodbath by decapitating and hacking at the location's established residents. \\"Follow me quick!\\" is what he says in the book. Rather than curb Tolkien's endemic racism and portrayal of a good-races-vs-bad-races war, Jackson has blown it out of proportion.<br /><br />While I enjoyed seeing more of Radagast the Brown than Tolkien ever showed, the character inevitably had a Jacksonian flavor. Tolkien's Radagast always seemed like St. Francis to me, but Jackson's -- aside from the cutesiness already mentioned -- has a hatred of spiders and bats that is rather un-Franciscan but right up Jackson's alley.<br /><br />Then there are the musical numbers. At Bag End, the dwarves burst into a number (\\"Blunt the Knives\\") that had me wondering if this was going to be a Broadway musical. A bit later, they sing a song about their lost home, but that is an important plot moment--when Bilbo first gets the adventuring bug--so I thought it was fine. But when the goblins sing \\"Down in the Deep of Goblin Town,\\" again, the genre veered toward Broadway musical. But these are the only three songs I remember--somebody correctme if I'm wrong. So the movie seemed rather confused on this score.<br /><br />Tolkien's book draws Bilbo from his cozy home into a love of adventure by taking him, and us, on a thrilling and ultimately light-hearted ride. By contrast, the movie adds threads of political intrigue, creeping darkness, cruel vengeance, and debates about whether Bilbo should continue his journey -- all of which were more at home in \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Add to that the gross-outs (e.g., the goblin-king's huge beard-like goiter), the promiscuous violence, and the somewhat out of place musical numbers, and I'd just as soon wait for all three movies to come out so that someone can edit them together into a two-and-a-half hour movie, which I'd watch instead.
0156030209|5.0|Even though this was a gift i thought it looked great before i gave it to the person and they loved it!
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Downloaded game this morning and loved it.  Wasn't sure I would after reading some of the reviews, but it is a simple  block dropping game.  Some people compare it to tetris, and while it does drop blocks to erase layers, it has a different feel.  I will enjoy playing when I don't feel like reading.
0375507256|5.0|Even though this was a gift i thought it looked great before i gave it to the person and they loved it!

B002JVWR4A|5.0|All I can say is if your a &#34;Bones&#34; fan you wont be disappointed my video came earlier than stated, it was well wrapped and damage free. The item is brand new. I am very happy with this purchase and this seller. I recommend this video set  and the seller. Enjoy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fantastic app.  cant seem to stop playing.  I would recommend to anyone. who likes the challenge. this is such an intriguing. came.
0393327655|5.0|This book by Sam Harris tells it like it is. It's very informative and thought provoking. Any believer in any god should read this book if they have the guts.
B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|Maybe he's done better recordings but even Stewart's mediocre music is better than most others.  Perhaps he does the old standards better than these.
1451683405|5.0|I'm not sure where I stand on the whole free will debate, but I tend to lean in the direction of free will being an illusion, and Sam Harris has some very interesting and informative insights. It's a very short book and doesn't take long at all to read, but in it's few pages it speaks volumes.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This one app gathers your most used social media and places it in one central, easy-to-use, enjoyable application. The app performs well on my Android devices (Droid RAZR MAXX and Kindle HD) with good speed. I especially like the &#34;flip&#34; transitions and their speed and high quality graphical interface. Very nice.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|Won't run unless connect to net<br /><br />Useless to keep kids occupied on a road trip.<br /><br />Any app bought thru Amazon is the same way...
B008MM9630|5.0|I  really enjoy this game!  I think it is fun for all ages, I play it with my grandson!<br />Love the animals!

B00CFNUMD0|3.0|Not sure if the audio for the ending and the interludes is encoded in a format that my reciever doesn't like, but there was no audio during those parts. Also, the audio overall was super low.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|got the game and it wont even open stuck on loading with the tip. highly disappointed in this game. I hope the developers fix it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is an amazing and fun game that will be exciting for adults and children alike. So many things to do that you will find it hard to become bored with this creative and delightful little game
140006922X|5.0|This was an excellent, though extrapolated, perspective on Jesus.  Next should be the historical perspective on Mohammed.  A scholar should provide that.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|there are to many names and people who offer nothing in the story. some times it goes  slowly and with no interest and then it speeds up again. I think the author is trying to keep it long and so he is loosing the main story.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is my favorite app and remember to save the Gems<br />Plus if you forget have some fun with the game
B00DVMOLOU|1.0|It was free and there were no reviews, so I gave it a shot. It only supports cbz, not cbr. The interface is screwy and unintuitive. Steer clear. Criminology, though not flawless, is still the best comics solution on KF.
B008B4KVS8|4.0|It was a great old flick! The blu-ray edition only made it better. I loved watching to old time actors do their thing. Rock Hudson, Ernest Borgnine (horrible Russian accent but loveable), Patrick McGoohan (love the Brits), and sadly Jim Brown (should have stuck with football). What made it most memorable was the music score. It just stays with you. Great memories.
140006922X|4.0|This book is well written, and Aslan pieces together some very compelling arguments, in a masterful way. It's entertaining and compelling and educational.<br /><br />I only regret its popularity because a lot of people will read this who are not familiar with historical Jesus studies. More than likely, these people will be unduly taken in by Aslan's effortless reconstruction. What they don't realize is that effortless reconstructions of the historical Jesus that make sense of a lot of the data are abounding in the last two centuries--and are quite diverse. Albert Schweitzer's \\"Quest for the Historical Jesus\\" is an early and felicitous example. These types of reconstructions seem so compelling for the reason that the data they offer to their readers is the data of which they have made sense. The data that doesn't fit into their reconstruction is precisely with what they will not familiarize their readers. In the author's note at the beginning, Aslan indicates his hesitance on this matter; I think he sensed that a few well-directed questions from Jesus scholars could undermine major parts of his reconstruction.<br /><br />One important problem with his ragged-bellicose-peasant-rebel-rouser Jesus is that the movement continued by James after his death was decidedly not like that. Moreover, if Jesus had been crucified primarily for leading a seditious onslaught on the temple, then why were the disciples allowed to escape and even return to the Jerusalem without being crucified? Aslan mentions the dozens of crosses that would have littered the hillside of Golgotha on the day of Jesus crucifixion. Are we to believe all of these were leaders of revolts? As Aslan would say, \\"Of course not!\\" Rather, most of them were merely PARTICIPANTS in seditious activities. If Jesus was leading a seditious movement, why were the disciples not crucified too? Instead, they continue the movement Jesus had begun and were not even so much as approached by Rome. In the final analysis, it seemsthat the gospels are correct in portraying Jesus as someone who was peaceful and unconcerned with overthrowing Rome but took on the religious leaders in Jerusalem. This would explain why the religious leaders would have tried to convince Rome of the dangers Jesus posed without even trying to indict his disciples. (Also--from my personal interaction with the first-century data--Alsan's claim that an attack on the religious leaders of the temple would have been seen by Rome as an attack on them is seriously questionable. Rome generally tried to stay out of religious scuffles; further, they probably didn't discourage them, since if the Jews were fighting each other, they weren't fighting Rome; Rome feared religious unity more than religious conflict.) That there was a clandestine plot behind the arrest and crucifixion of Jesus is a serious historical plausibility that Aslan dismisses for the sake of his system. In short, Aslan's Jesus is too much of a zealot to fit all of the data.<br /><br />This also brings to bear a mistake in Aslan's handling of the source material. His view that Mark transformed Jesus into a peace-loving teacher of universal truths after 70 AD is dubious. For one, almost all scholars agree that much of Mark's material existed as oral tradition long before Mark compiled it. In addition, Q also presents a picture of a peace-loving Jesus. For example, the sermon on the mount/plain (including the phrase \\"love your enemies\\") is part of the Q material! And in case you're not familiar with source criticism, here's the problem with that: even the latest dates for Mark put it in the 70s, and Q existed prior to Mark. Does Aslan expect us to believe that Q also developed after 70 AD? This is untenable.<br /><br />Instead, it seems that the success of the Jesus movement after 70 AD can be explained by a concept of \\"the survival of the fittest.\\" The reason that Christianity flourished after the destruction of the temple was precisely BECAUSE ALREADY the central message of Jesus was peaceful toward Rome and was universally applicable. The destruction of the temple laid the groundwork, then, for the expansion of this sect. By writing a Greek gospel with the oral sources, Mark was merely seizing the opportunity made available to him by this historical event, not creating the opportunity by inventing stories. Such an idea is ludicrous! Even Aslan himself must adhere to the oral source hypothesis to use anything in the gospels to reconstruct his picture of Jesus (e.g., at the last supper, Jesus' reference to the two swords as \\"enough\\").<br /><br />Though I don't think it is wrong for a Muslim to write a historical book--or even a religious one for that matter--about Jesus (he is a public figure), I believe his Islamic faith does skew his portrait of Jesus. Considering the bellicose beginnings of his own faith, it would be quite advantageous for Aslan to prove that Christianity (the rival religion) was started by a ruthless revolutionary. In fact, it is often true that he sees more conflict in the early movement than is there (and tends to exaggerate it).<br /><br />Nevertheless, Aslan's book has raised some important new questions. He also gives some important insights. So this book is a good contribution to the historical Jesus debate. It's just probably unfortunate that it has become popular.
1423141997|5.0|Absolutely fabulous author and love the books I have  read so far. I am trying to read this one before the movie comes out in theaters as I know we willo be going to see it.
B002MCYWHG|5.0|Pros: light weight seat, very useful front head rest, fits on bike perfectly<br />Cons: center mount is heavy, installing center mount takes alot of time and patience<br /><br />This is a great bike seat. My kid loved it. In fact, he felt so comfortable in it that he plopped his head on the headrest and fell asleep...within minutes of his first ride!  Definitely worth the price.
B00280LYHS|4.0|I would be very happy to rate this book had it been sent to the correct Kindle.  I am now using Angela's third Kindle as mine was broken and unfortunately did not have insurance on it, as it was a gift.
B0013N7AD8|5.0|Come on what could anyone say bad about this movie! This great to watch with the kids or by yourself, just plan fun.
B008DVJO7I|5.0|.This is one of my daughters favorite CD's.  It was purchased to replace her copy that was thoroughly listened to then damaged by getting lost under the seats of her car when it fell, then stepped on by her toddler.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had to see what everyone was talking about so bought it out of curiousity. I could not stop reading it. Awesome. Now I need to buy the next one.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Very suspenseful and clever.  Although half way through I had the killer figured out but not how they did it.  Great read!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I found it hard to complete this movie because it was, well, annoying.  The lack of continuity, though the author tries hard to make it seem all the people are related, is appalling.  The stories made me yawn except for one funny scene almost at the end of the movie.  It certainly kept me on the edge of my seat trying to understand the dialog.  By the end of the movie I had had an epiphany.  The language they were speaking has been used in another film: Airplane.  At least in Airplane, there was an old lady who could step in and translate when some of the actors were speaking JIVE!
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This is indeed a Nintendo product. Aside from it's Japanese box and longer cord it is the same as the controller that came with my Gamecube. Many of the reviews I read for similar products turned out to be cheap third party versions that didn't feel right or last very long. I bought one of these on Ebay in spite of my concerns and as soon as I knew it was from Nintendo I hopped on Amazon and bought another. If that's what you're looking for I highly recommend it.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|they should be a little easier but it was fun and I'm really just doing this to tat free cions bye

0802473156|4.0|I like it. I'm not sure if I agree with all of it, but it's interesting. I wouldn't want to give up any of the love languages as I think they are all important and that's what I don't necessarily agree with.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|A great game to play when your bored and such great a learning game although you get a little mad when you have to wait an hour to coins and stars.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|This app makes it so easy to keep up on the go. Definitely good for business contacts an keeping up with former co-workers.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I am a big fan of these, having now ordered them twice. Not sure if I just have abnormally small ears, but it's always been impossible for me to get in-ear headphones to stay in. (probably not the worst thing, since I don't like them anyway & they end up hurting after having them in for more than 15 min) These headphones are lightweight, don't hurt after wearing for an extended period of time, and seem to have great sound quality. The first pair I had lasted for about a year, which isn't bad for a $10 pair of headphones. Definitely recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very fun and a great during a long car ride! Haha but this game is super fun and I recommend it to anyone who loves the despicable me movies.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I had needed to pick up a USB hub and have a lot of devices using USB 3.0 so this was the perfect device for me to use. The cable is a decent length which worked out well for me in being able to set my devices a little further away since they have short cables. The transfer speeds were the same between using the hub or plugging right into the USB 3.0 port. Charging my phone I got the exact same charge speed you would expect from a non powered device and it did the job.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and found every spare time I had to continue reading this book. I would highly recommned this book.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I had tried out fitbit but when I had it read the pulse would be coming out in the future. I returned the fitbit so I could pick this up and see which I had prefered, and the pulse won me over. I keep this device on me everyday as you are supposed to and check in daily on the app. I love the app layout on android and find it very easy to use, I really love what they have done with the online app most of all. I initially had the new ws-50 scale and found the online layout to severely lack but that has changed now and keeps changing for the better.<br /><br />When I first picked up the device on day one they had already launched an update giving you the ability to look at the past 2 days on the device. A few days back they launched yet another update which has now given users the past 10 days which is nice to see them constantly updating the pulse. Also the battery life has only gotten better with each update. I have yet to use runmode so I will need to report back in on that later but it looks to be a very useful mode.<br /><br />One complaint I have is that within a few days of using it the metal broke through the rubber on the clip you use for pants.
0060987464|5.0|It's an extremely well written book that I at least enjoyed. Some of the things that happen are probably a bit to demented for some people, but I found it to be an enjoyable read for myself. There was nothing wrong with the physical quality of the book and it arrived on time so I'm happy.
1909313033|5.0|I'm pretty sure this book is based off my pugs, so many true etiquettes in here its uncanny. Made for a great surprise gift for my gf
B00D7JGL36|5.0|This is the best real country music album I've heard in the last 20 - 30 years.  Kudos to Vince and Paul with a lot of respect to Buck and Merle.  Brilliantly performed classic Bakersfield songs.  This is what country music should sound like!  Real classic country at its best.  Can you tell I like this album? :)  Vince's singing and guitar playing is superb, Paul franklin the most respected pedal steel pedal player in the world, and some of the best classic country songs from two real icons of country music - what a combination!  A must have for anyone that appreciates good music.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|If you read any subreddits or forums you'll always see people recommend this watch (and it's other colors) you can dress this watch up, down and in between. This was my first automatic movement and I love just watch the skeleton back, the stock strap is very comfortable and is very durable. I actually gave this one to my good friend as gift and it's now is daily wearer. Couldn't be happier with this watch
B0028RXXFC|4.0|Got this for my uncle to watch. Thank you for your help and time! He really enjoyed watching the series.

I've seen people complain or mention that the spine falls apart but I haven't seen that yet, as I am only on book 1.

B004YW4L5K|5.0|What started as a summertime read developed into a mesmerizing trip through time, space and my beliefs. To say that I looked forward to each chapter would be an understatement verging on fraud. This book is a philosophical adventure and the type of science fiction I haven't had the pleasure of experiencing in decades. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story with interesting characters and a captivating plot.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Simply a classic. This story never grows old, as the reader follows as each joy and sorrow with the March Family. Truly a treasure of a story.
B000UZNRS2|3.0|I love the camel club books anyone who enjoys adventure and mystery will to. I highly recommend this and the others in the series.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|awesome compelling entertaining musical quite the nice series opener.  Met all my expectations and then some from ages 9 to 47.
B007HO392S|5.0|That describes the CD perfectly! It's already had four hit singles. My favorite is her current hit. I Will See You Again.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|This was amazing I loved every single poem they made me laugh I am going to tell all my friends about this book
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I just love free Kindle books!!! This one was one of the good ones!!!  I would definitely recommend it to anyone!!Really makes you think about how you approach people!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is awesome I like more than the 4th one you take less damage to most equipment you need coins to buy them  you can with gold to
B00DP3IESY|5.0|If you love Sci-Fi movies you will love this one. It makes you think too. It has everything a great sci-fi movie should: robots, cool vehicles & aircraft/spacecrafts, cool guns, good battle scenes. Does it have aliens? Watch to find out!
B0067LXQAW|5.0|Really great songs on this album, I recommend this to any Cranberries fans. Sounds just like their old work :)
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I had a lot of fun with this book.  I read somewhere once, that the &#34;five year mission&#34; of the Enterprise suffered over 140% causalities (someone took the time to count the total).  It makes me wonder what would happen if that crew had the same warnings.  I was laughing all the way through...thanks John!
B00005ABII|3.0|It's pretty good, I think I should of gone with &#34;Pressure Chief&#34; Still some really good songs on here, if you like Cake that is :)
B007REV4T8|3.0|This isn't a bad movie but this James Bond feels somehow different to me. Up to &#34;Die Another Day&#34;, I had a sense of continuing story line that was helped along by the various movies that relating back to the movies before that helped fill out the James Bond character. With Casino Royale, that linkage was broken, and this has continued thru to the current movie. The reason for this appears to be the idea that all of a sudden you would show how James Bond got his license to kill. Well, that wouldn't be a bad movie IF you used a flash back to go back in time to show how this happened and then came back forward to now and the story all falls into place. However, this wasn't done. You get a story that ALL takes place NOW and that destorys any of the pass links to the previous movies! This requires the viewer who is used to the links being their to all of a sudden dump them all. For me, that's asking a lot. Anyway, this movie is pretty good but somehow it just doesn't meet the standards that I have and that's a real shame as Daniel Crag makes a good Bond but for some reason the Bond feeling just isn't there anymore. A real shame...
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|Great fun for a while but now the game won't  load. If you do get this game do NOT spend any money on in game items. Since this has been going on since the game first came out, it is either a ripoff or the developers have abandoned it.
B00005JA8B|5.0|Just as good as I remember it being with one small thing that sort of surprised me. On the VHS version, the Hi-Fi sound is great and doesn't need much volume to be heard. On the DVD version, I noted I had to turn my 5.1 speaker system up higher to get the same good sound. This is a minor thing, and the DVD has a much better picture than the VHS, but it would seem to me that all things being equal, the DVD sound should be just as good. Anyway, the movie itself is great and even though there is some very graphic violence and language, it's a must-have for anyone that likes Arnold Schwarzeneger films. Highly recommend it!
B003VS0CXS|5.0|Very beatiful movie, is a classic for all people
B00005JN0A|5.0|Although some parts might have been a bit cheesy, there were more great parts than not.  I had just left St. Peter's Basilica a few days prior to watching this for the first time and you could tell they actually filmed this at the square.  That just made it that much more hilarious to me.  Not to forget the opening part, Matt Damon acting as the lead singer to Lustra, haha too funny.  Everyone knows &#34;Scotty doesn't know&#34;
B004EWFV9K|4.0|Always a good and slow-developing story.  A view from Sweden of so-called allies.  Too much repetition of Wallender's old age issue - it got irritating.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have to admit that although there are some holes in the plot, I really enjoyed reading the book.  Grisham tells a good story, even when some aspects may not seem totally plausible.  Grisham himself admits that he is lazy when it comes to research, and some of that shows with this book. However, I found I just could not put it down. Is Malcolm Bannister a good guy or a bad guy.  He is, after all, in prison. Read it to find out.  If you like \\"The Partner\\" (my all time favorite Grisham book) I think you'll like this book.
140006922X|4.0|...and I bought this book out of revulsion for their bigoted and stupid interviewer.<br /><br />But, to coin a phrase, this book is not Holy Scripture.  Mr. Aslan writes fluently, and restates some positions and theories that I had first learned about in early adolescence. Without the Fox-induced dustup, the book might never have achieved best seller status.<br /><br />I do not see how one can ever know about a historical Jesus. There is close to zero verifiable information, and everything is speculation based on myth, as far as I can see.  That speculation is a reflecting mirror upon us, our own hopes and fears. As for Jesus, if he existed, we will never know for sure.<br /><br />An interesting read, but in no way definitive history, or even history.<br /><br />**********<br />Added thoughts, five days later:<br /><br />As the Aslan controversy continues to play out in the press and on the internet, my appreciation grows for the beneficial effects of this book. I still maintain that it is an interesting literary construction, rather than actual history  (and how could it be otherwise?) -- but it is causing at least some people to think outside the parameters of revealed religion, and that is a good thing in my view.<br />l<br />And so, I am upping my rating from three stars to four.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|All of your favorite characters from Middle Earth are back and the adventure begins for Bilbo Baggins.  I did have trouble however trying to figure out why the fighting mountion scene went on for so long - seeing that it only took up less then two lines in the book. .<br />But for the most part it was good.  Not quite as good as Leonard Nimoy's Ballad of Bilbo Baggins which can be seen on utube but for a rain Saturday night I say go for it.
B000KFB4PK|4.0|My 4 year old loves this watch. Although he cannot read time, the colors and Lego design deem it a great accessory (my husband owns many watches). The only problem we had was when a piece came apart, we broke it trying to put it back together. This is in part because it had been a year since we bought it and forgotten the instructions. At @$20, it was well worth buying again.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Well, what can you say about a movie were you are hoping the bad guys win? - That's right - not quite what I had expected either. I think the Giants got the wrong end of the stick in this telling of the tale. But then don't they always? Just watch the 50's classics,\\"Attack of the 50 Foot Woman\\". This movie is a little too rough for little guys say under 8 or 9 so be aware of that when you rent it.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I loved this movie.  It was definitely a movie Sam Raimi made for himself and I loved everything about it from the long list of B actor cameos to the nods to Oz history in film and stage.  I was glad it wasn't Disneyfied like some other recent movies and I really liked the acting.
B00CA3C1N4|3.0|The concept of this game is to conquer the universe.  The game play was simple and easy to follow.  It just wasn't my style of game.  I prefer puzzle and physics based games but it was the faotd so no loss no gain.  Others might find it interesting.
B00CA4S27W|3.0|I own all of their albums.  This was better than their last one and the vocals and guitar work are solid.  That being said, I kind of miss their ren fair rock versions of classics like their first three albums.  This one seemed to come back to the mysticism of former albums and I did enjoy this one better than Secret Voyage.
B005CFWHCC|4.0|Great for running around in the summer.  Stylish, but not a problem if you get caught in a summer shower.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|I'm not a fan of musicals.  I bought this because I am a big fan of Cyndi Lauper.  That being said, I ended up really liking the music and really enjoying the humor and heart.  There is a lot of sentimentality in musicals that can come off as, well, like a Broadway musical.  There is some of that here but overall, the music has a catchy feel to it and this cast is very talented.  Even the cliches are often humorous and used very tongue in cheek.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|As you should be aware, this is not your typical upscale job with no improvement.  Paramount actually green lit digital improvements which really do help the SFX look, but not quite fit in, with more modern television shows.<br /><br />Either way, if you're a Star Trek fan and have somehow gone all these years without buying any of the series, these blu-ray remasters are a great time to start!
0345528581|4.0|Great book. The workouts are pretty good and a great alternative to using traditional weights. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a good workout and doesn't want to buy weights and machines.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|This is a good book for grades 8-12.  Each grade has their own issues with this topic and the underlying causes for possible teen suicide.  Each person who reads this will/should get their own meaning of what really caused Hannah Baker to commit this act and what really drove her to end her life.  Was it that no one really saw her and paid any attention to her or was it that all of the wrong people did pay attention to her and ruin her high school days by the Bullying she experienced.  This is for the reader to decide and to support by examples from the book to support their opinion.
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|The 7 original nightmares on blu ray, the DVD set may have had better artwork (each movie came in it's own case with the movie poster on front and small description on back) But this one is allooot slimmer than the other box set and has cool extras without making you play tht stupid game were u walk around a basement looking for clips that last like 2 to fifteen minuets. And includes 2 episodes from freddys nightmares! And i loved that show it was pretty much like a twilight zone with Freddy as the host, hard to find it now a days i think they show runs on chiller (channel) or syfi.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|Love this movie, had to buy it so I could watch it over and over again. I wish they had a special edition version, the more special features the better!
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|This was an above average game with very interesting puzzles. I found it rather challenging. I hope there will be a sequel.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have always loved escape games and this one is no exception! I had a lot of fun playing it!
B0058YPGL6|5.0|Really, I did. I mean, come on. Teen Wolf, a show about teenagers and werewolves on MTV? The same network who brings us gems such as 16 and Pregnant and Teen Mom 1-3? Yeah, right. HARD PASS. When I heard about this show, I laughed and rolled my eyes and went about my business. But then I noticed that the people I follow on Tumblr were getting into it. And I still laughed and dismissed it. Imagine my shock when my best friend broke down and watched it, only to whisper to me in surprised horror, \\"It's actually...really good.\\" Well that's when I decided I would give it a chance.<br /><br />Despite all of that, I still wanted to hate this show. It just seemed so cheesy and dumb and MTV-pandering-to-14-year-old-girls-with-sexy-actors that I tried to resist it. Imagine my shock as I watched the first couple of episodes only to realize that the show was, in fact, good. Sure, it's no masterpiece. It's cheesy and not a super intelligent show, but it is fun. And the 14-year-old girl inside of me certainly appreciates all of the half naked muscle-y men that are always ripping their shirts off. Damn you MTV, you got me there.<br /><br />Let me start off with one of the first reasons I fell in love with this show: Stiles Stilinski. I have never watched a show and loved a character so quickly. He's sarcastic, hilarious, clever, and he flails a lot. I love it. But to my surprise, all of the characters were likeable. I even sympathized with douche-y jock Jackson. And let me tell you, I personally find it super rare to genuinely like all of the main characters (example: The Walking Dead, I hate damn near every one of them). The cast is just fantastic, something I was not expecting. The main cast consists of Tyler Posey, Dylan O'Brien, Holland Roden, Crystal Reed, Tyler Hoechlin, and Colton Haynes. And they are all superb. Especially O'Brien, who constantly steals the show as Stiles.<br /><br />Let me also interject about the music. I can not speak highly enough of the music that ison this show. MTV knows what they're doing, and the upbeat indie pop is so fantastic! Do yourself a favor and if nothing else, go check out the music the show features!<br /><br />The plot itself isn't super complicated, All Scott McCall wanted was to make first string in Lacrosse, win the heart of beautiful new girl Allison Argent, and hang with his best friend, Stiles. But then he gets bit in the woods one night and becomes a werewolf. Now he has to figure out what is up with creepy Derek Hale, who the hell the Alpha is, not to mention how to live with his new affliction, and still pass his classes. Plus there's the fact that his new girlfriend's dad is a werewolf hunter. Yikes. Teen Wolf is humorous and just plain fun. The characters are snarky, there's a lot of humor to balance out the dark/mysterious atmosphere, Derek Hale is almost too much of a creeper to function, and Scott McCall is adorable as he stumbles his way through teenage love and lycanthropy.<br /><br />The season only gets better as it goes on, and the second season is even better. So if you are like me and have judged this show quite harshly, you owe it to yourself to give it a chance and see what you're missing out on! I wanted to hate this show SO BAD, and instead I ended up fiercely loving it instead. Go figure. So give it a try, you might just get the bite too!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|This did not download for me.  They said that it was corrupted. So was glad that it was a free item.
B00C7KYXHW|2.0|I'll admit that show is intriguing. It's a very interesting premise and I can't deny the show has style. Mads Mikkelsen and Hugh Dancy are fabulous, their acting is great. Not to mention they are both very easy on the eyes. Despite all of that, I just really can't get into it. The show is just SO dramatic and over the top, it's extremely dark, and the gore is too much for me (I'm super sensitive to gory stuff though). I can see the merit to this show, I can certainly see why it has a pretty big fan base already. However, it is just not something I want to continually watch.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|I loved all the books in the series, it's a perfect escape from my daily life. The storyline and its twist are unique, every time I expected the outcome, there was a different one, well written.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|i love this game! it is so fun to try and figure out which mutations work best and get my disease the most infectious and severe to kill everybody!!!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Love the card game, minus the ads. Fun to play at home or on the go. Brings back a lot of memories.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|We never lose that ability to love no matter how old we are.  This movie was truly wonderful.  A must see.
B00BSN0K1C|4.0|I actually bought it for my sons, I didn't realise that it is an adult collector figure, and the the only thing that I don't like is that the head doesn't move that much and some articulation in the torso like Batman from The Dark Knigth Rises, but my kids love it, they're happy with it, so I'm happy.
0525953728|5.0|Great!  Informative!  The only drawback is that you don't know who the real Navy Seal is.  I would love to see his actual photo.  The book left me with much more knowledge and respect for the military men who are fighting for our freedom.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This movie completely caught me off guard. I had seen the previews for this in other movies and had disregarded it as just another teeny-bopper movie. I was pleasantly surprised at how real and true to real life this movie was. Without giving too much away—this is a must see!!!!
0618871713|4.0|Link to review: [...]  Review:  My rating: 4 of 5 stars    Alison has had an odd relationship with her father. Not only did he work in a morgue, but he was hiding a major secret. Once she comes out of the closet and is in college, she realizes that her father was gay. This was not the only secret left for Alison to solve.    This book would be hard to read aloud given its layout. This would be one that I would point out on the bookshelf, but I would not want to expose the entire class to the content. (There is at least one sex scene.) If I were to have the class read from it, there would be specific sections and I would be sure to announce on Open House that I am available if parents would like to discuss the content of any of the books.    I thought this was an easy read and a good book. I am very naïve about what goes on in the lesbian world and I thought this was a very interesting book. After talking with a professor (who is lesbian) I realized that this was a common \\"finding self\\" track for lesbians (figuring out they were lesbians--not their fathers being gay).    View all my reviews    ***    What I Want To Add:    I read this book for a college class about human sexuality in America. We had a guest professor come in and lead the class discussion on this book. It was interesting to hear this book about a lesbian's life from a lesbian. Being a straight female, I was really unsure as to what to expect or if the author's experiences were common, etc. I loved listening about everyone's different takes on the book itself.    I didn't have any major issues with this book. I would read it again if I even had the opportunity to do so. I would recommend this book for anyone in middle school or older. From what I remember there might be some adult language, and I know for sure that there was some nudity - but none of that was the main focus. This book might help some of those who are going through similar experiences (even if those people are straight or gay).    My rating: 4/5 stars    Sincerely,    Taylor    Have questions, requests, etc.? Then feel free to e-mail me at taylorreadingblog23@yahoo.com
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|Very good read, if you ever had an experience living abroad it will resonate even more. Nice characters, nice observations on life in Nigeria, UK and the US.
140123755X|5.0|Link to review: [...]<br /><br />Review's text:<br />Book Review: Fables, Vol. 1: Legends in Exile (Fables, #1)<br />BY TASTRON23 ON JULY 18, 2013<br /><br />Fables, Vol. 1: Legends in Exile by Bill Willingham<br /><br />My rating: 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />The classic characters such as Snow White and the big bad wolf all come together in this town called \\"Fables.\\" When different townspeople are found dead, it is up to some of children's most loved characters to solve the crime.<br /><br />This comic series puts a unique spin on fairy tale creatures. This might be an interesting project for students to branch off of - they could create new fairy tales or write their own sort of Fable town.<br /><br />I love this book and I have enjoyed other books from this series. I think there's a TV show called \\"Once Upon a Time\\" that does a similar thing as this comic book series, but I think students might enjoy reading these tales more than watching a show. That is my hope, at least.<br /><br />View all my reviews<br /><br />What I Want To Add:<br /><br />I have always been interested in comics. However, I rarely ever really sat down with them. Fables is one of the first comics that I really got into and I have loved every minute of it thus far.<br /><br />With that being said, I have not had the time to reread a lot of comics and it has been a while since I really sat down with this series. I do know that I enjoy the series. I haven't reread it due to a lack of wanting to, but due to a lack of time. Hopefully I'll be able to in the near future.<br /><br />The volume is different from the rest of the series. It sort of has its own story-line that does not connect with the rest of the series. Sure, the characters are the same and whatnot, but this sort of just gets a general feel of the comics. Think of it sort of as a pilot for a television show.<br /><br />My absolute favorite character is \\"the big bad wolf.\\" He is one of the central characters and I love that that means I getto read more about him. I do not really remember why I like him so much, other than I love the whole vampire/werewolf thing. ... Though he's not a werewolf technically but I think my mind made that connection nonetheless.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for anyone in middle school and older. I know some adults that absolutely love the series. Given its age, I fear that not a lot of younger readers know about the series. I hope to have a least one copy in my classroom to share with students.<br /><br />My rating: 5/5 stars<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Taylor<br /><br />Have questions, requests, etc.?

B00B22ASUM|5.0|I loved this triumphant story. Cats are the next higher evolution for us humans!  I understand James very well, I'm a better human for the love my cats give me.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I baby sit during the summer so this has tones of ideas also I live to go camping I love it!!!!
0761169253|3.0|This book is very cute, but not extraordinary.  It contains much common knowledge.  I wish I had my money back.
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|I couldn't believe how bad this movie SUCKED! First of all, if being gay is what you like then be gay, but WHY do I have to sit for 45 minutes and watch it?! Yes they have gay friends we KNOW THAT but I DIDNT BUY THE MOVIE TO SIT AND WATCH THAT!<br />And then the movie had NO PLOT! The went to Dubai annnnnnnnnd......? The fashion was lovely, but this movie was STUPID!
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|a really good vampire movie, sucks you in and doesn't let go.for Blu ray fans I can recommend this movie,has a great picture from start to finish.
1781162646|5.0|I loved this book and read it in one day! It was a fun and relaxing read! Great summer book!
B002RVCD6O|5.0|The battle against Voldemort keeps getting more intense.  As the characters grow up, the danger grows with them.  The characters continue to evolve, while keeping those qualities that readers/fans have come to appreciate.<br /><br />I am glad I did not read the series until J.K. Rowling had finished the series.  I can't imagine having to wait to go on to Deathly Hallows!
0684824906|5.0|This is my second time to read the book and I have learned even more about our 16th President.  Abraham Lincoln was truly a man for his time.  His wisdom and humanity are unequalled. His ability to work with rivals who become friends and followers sets an example for today's leaders.  Wonderful book.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Touching review of the brilliant mind of Beatrix Potter and a one thought mother who wanted Beatrix to marry the right class of person and not consider Beatrix's needs at all.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game!!! This is the best game ever!!! I recommend this game for ages 3-15. Everybody who has a device should have this game
B007JVJ3C4|3.0|While sticking closer to the comic book roots of the character, and with improved visuals and environments, this second installment of the GR franchise lacks the villainous touch of Wes Bentley, with no antogonists really posing a threat to GR, nor has Cage's take on the Human or Demon form of the Rider improved much on the second go around. The 3D is done well, and it does add to the film, but despite the much darker and &#34;hellish&#34; visuals in the film, they cannot hide the mediocre writing or the whimsy overacting that ruins the main character.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|I saw this musical in NYC before any Tony nominations were announced.  At that time I felt it was the most enjoyable show I had ever seen.  I was waiting for the CD to be released.  It's wonderful music and reminds me of the time I saw the show in NYC.
B005IZLPME|5.0|Cap makes his solo appearance in this fantastic entry into the Avengers percursor film with a sock to Hitler's Jaw. Besides fantastic jobs in casting and performance, the ambiance of the film lends to a more classic tone backed by war propoganda and nods to the wartime fascination with advancement of science and technology. The wizards of the CGI department took Chris Evans from a ripped beefcake, to a 90lb runt, then back to full glory. After &#34;Flaming On&#34; as the Human Torch, many doubted his ability to perform a dual role, as it were, into another Superhero costume. In his portrayal, and rightfully so, I feel he played more as Steve Rogers and less as Captain America. He makes you look to the man at the core, the heart behind the shield, and the gentleness under the muscles. In making the classic cut, polite, All American Man stand ahead of the hero he becomes, he portrayed a vision of what we would exemplify as a representation of an ideal America in its values and character.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving delivers masterfully as the Red Skull, as not an over the top evil doer ala Dr. Doom, but as a depitction of the evil genius promoted from a Nazi Germany representation of what we envioned as the evil of our WW2 enemy. He has the smarts, determination, and ruthlessness to pull off a maniacal menace without making it look like he was trying. Both before and after shucking his fake face, he never had to sell you on the appearance, as that is not what made him devious or powerful.<br /><br />The environments, vehicles, costumes, and set pieces are a brilliant mix of 40's/50's World of Tomorrow mixed with classical American flair, and a dash of James Bond. The romantic subplot hints just enough to make it a tangible force, and the star supporting cast makes each character memorable and indespensible. Not only is it great to see a hero who unquestionably stands for what is right, it was great to see he did not need to a &#34;Dark Hero&#34; or live in a crime ridden metroplis. He lived the motto, &#34;With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibilty.&#34;  while wearing the bold colors of the Red, White, and Blue. Uncle Ben would be proud.metroplis.

B0013E5HEG|5.0|very detailed, beautiful little lion.<br />Arrived promptly. No complaints.<br />Photographs well too!<br />I would recommend it to anyone interested in a little plastic lion!!!
B00CRS88IO|5.0|As a James Bond fan, with every movie in both an old VHS and DVD collection, I found The Ian Fleming Files ~ Operation Armanda ~ A WWII Thriller a great story. It would make a good movie to add to the James Bond's many films. It has the beautiful brave women, the horrible aggressive villain and of course the hero that accomplishes his impossible mission his tougher than tough boss gives him. If you like James Bond, you will love this one!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is great fun.  If you like Temple Run you'll love this cute, addictive game.  It's the best game I've played since Diner Dash.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I'm sure the author feels he has total recall, however very difficult for me believe. These tales of miraculous recovery from devastating disease leave me doubting.
B005NKGEP2|2.0|I did not like this book at all.  I found that it jumped around so much, it was hard to keep track of the characters. You really did not know where you at.  I did not finish the book
B000RPCK1U|5.0|Besides Sean Connery, Bronson's James Bond was classic and the very best. Tis a shame NBC denied his appearing as Bond in his youth. The series with Ian Fleming's James Bond would have been top drawer forever.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It's exactly what is says it is. High Def. of the complete 6 episodes. I love the story and this in 5.1 surround sound is just great. Shipping was quick. Packing was brand new! Thank you.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Was not thrilled with this James Bond being a thug. But they gave him some class and culture. Still don't understand a martini shaken not stirred. As an old bartender, martinis are always shaken except extra dry... straight gin and a wave over vermouth...... always the show+ tip
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I really enjoyed this. I was surprised since I got it for free but it was actually great.  The writing was nice and it flowed beautifully even though it went from one person's point of view to another without  warning.  It was never confusing.<br /><br />Megan is a battered woman trying to build a new life.  Todd  is the handsome next door neighbor who knows what he wants, and he wants Megan.  He's seen his fair share of loss and is ready to find his HEA. He just has to convince his beautifully damaged neighbor.<br /><br />I will definitely read this again and can't wait to get started on the next book in the Pride Series.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Exceptional movie from an awesome book series. Great cast and gripping story of following a story to it's bitter end.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This movie was a great mix of drama, action, and humor. It turned out to be a lot better than what i thought it was going to be and is worth the money to see it.
B00AEFYS8G|5.0|One of my favorites, love to watch when I feel like it. Great cast and the extra of Henry Fonda as a bad guy.
B004S5D3B6|5.0|Great movie, great story. It is hard to watch at times due to the strong themes, but it is really great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is fun and silly but it is really hard to earn coins<br />Like many other things to but after all it is fun
B001609SQA|4.0|I thought this sequel to&#34; Alien&#34; was a very good. Usually when you have a sequel it does not compare to the first but this by far was a great movie. I do recommend the &#34; Directors cut&#34; of this movie. It fills in some blanks that really need to be filled in.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Happy to sync my ipad 2 with my hd tv. Now hoping to get more vendors on board to caste.
0321356683|5.0|Correctness is not enough. This book is playing a role as mentor who helps you to a master.<br /><br />Extremely recommend to every developer working in Java.
B0063FGG22|5.0|As you might expect Alfred Hitchcock, master of suspense,- still keeps us sitting on the edge of our seats.  He makes us want to reach in and grab that matchbook before James Mason sees it. Even as he aged, Cary Grant gave us believability as his character became accidentally involved in events that were so far removed from his own reality.  All our heroes don't have to be in their 20's.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Advent Children on Blu-Ray is pretty neat. Plenty of graphical upgrades, special features, and extras to keep the nostalgia happy.<br />Extended fight scenes were seamlessly integrated.
B00AEBB8H4|5.0|Simple elegance, fineness, style and Grace (Kelly-to be exact).What appears to be a simple story evolves into the kind of intrigue and suspense that we expect from Alfred Hitchcock.  Haven't seen this film for more than 20 years - so I had forgotten the ending.<br />So well done that I didn't get it - right up until 'Hitch' was ready to give it away.  Those were the days when 'Whodunit' meant&#34; lets not give it all away in the first 5 minutes&#34;. When writers and directors had a high regard for the intelligence of their audience.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Love Violet (the grandmother) - what an awesome actress...her facial expressions are priceless!  Don't forget to watch the last episode -Christmas At Downton Abbey. I almost didn't because it wasn't listed as Episode # whatever...but it is the BEST!  Enjoy!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game it is a really fun game.And i love how it goes all over the world! People should.really get this game.
B000001ZS3|5.0|This music is so other-worldly. A very important part of my very eclectic music collection. I love New Age music and Jarre is greatly appreciated.
B00DYTKKGI|4.0|I'm 14 years old and I play it and love it it's fun to play and isn't too gory! Recommended for you !!!
0446547646|5.0|As always, Nicholas Sparks out did himself. Great book, sad ending! Reading it for the second time in a row :)
B00CF2UORK|5.0|This is an enjoyable stop motion collection. Well worth your time and rental fee. It is funny that the bright ones in this team's work are the animals. The humans are clueless... I would watch it again
1592402690|5.0|It has some very heavy material, but it's also made of some very heavy material as well. Never in my life have I held a book heavier than a shot put. JESUS CHRIST, WHAT A HEAVY BOOK!
