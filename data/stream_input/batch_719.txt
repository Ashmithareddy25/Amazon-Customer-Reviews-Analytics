0143038419|4.0|As was mentioned in a previous review, I enjoyed this book but not as much as Happiness That Is Guaranteed.  It is much deeper and more substantive, less self-indulgent.  It take you straight to the source of transcendent, joyful states that Gilbert approaches side-ways.  No need to travel or change anything external.  It is an internal journey to potentially will provide everything you want or need.      [[ASIN:1403369615 Happiness That Is Guaranteed]]
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Well, i'm new here and i'm a braziliam guy, so, my english is not very well, but i'm gonna try to say something to help the future consumers.  This show is very amazing, i saw only the firs disc until now, and i have to say that i'm grateful for the show. Everything is perfect, the set-list, the musicians performance, the Royal Albert Hall (Maximun Temple Of Rock Concerts), the lights and everybody involved with this gig. I had following the career os this musicians since 1969, and i have to take off my hat to this performance, it's absolutely grandious. Gilmour and Wright who represented in my opinion 75% of the Pink Floyd are making his best, i've much more to say, but can't express everythin because my poor english, so, forgive me. I recomend strongly this DVD, already is the best for 2007!   Thank you David, Richard, Phil, Jon, Guy, Steve, Dick and the guests, you're THE BEST!!!
B00005K3O4|5.0|I had never seen this film before and my boyfriend had spoken about it in the past. I purchased the dvd and we sat down and watched it. It brang back so many memories of awesome movies in the 80's. I enjoyed this film alot and found it to be different to alot of high budget films. Killer Klowns had it's own style. We both gave it 5 stars.
B0001I55OC|4.0|Enjoyed the film very much.  I do like  Gerard Butler.   Was supprise to see Micheal Sheen who did an excellent job in the Queen. It is sad he didn't get an Oscar for his part as Prime Minister.  But that's the way Hollywood is, to  bad.  I feel it was because of the war in Iraq.
B000ELJBAK|3.0|The music inside this disc it´s very David!, remebers me something like a Shine on Your crasy diamond, Animals an little bit of echeos.
B00005JO9J|5.0|The first season on this dvd is very crisp and clear for viewing. Of course it is entertaining, it's Grey's Anatomy. I can't wait to order the second season.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|This album is fantastic! His use of metaphors and imagery along with the sometimes pop-ish rythem makes this one of his best projects to date. Thanks, Bruce!!!!
1932100660|5.0|This is definitely the best book on nutrition I've read and I've gone through ton's of 'diet' books.      This book seems to have finally gotten to the 'truth' about state of the art nutrition.  Refreshing, excellent, and... it's about time!  Thank you  Colin Campbell, PhD, for finally giving the public an honest, forthright look at the field, the research and for guidance on applying the research results.  I'm also sure many of those making money off our dietary misery will not like this book or the changes suggested by current valid research.    I thought following the advice gleaned from the scientific studies would be hard but actually, it was easy and I found I didn't crave my 'old' diet at all.  The food I ate even tasted better; something I thought only happened with smokers who quit.  I feel much better now on all fronts and don't seem to have a problem keeping the weight off even though I'm often eating more than before.      The 'inside' look that the author gives of the research establishment, government and the food industry were enlightening and give me a better footing to evaluating their 'advice' in the future.  It also explains a lot about things I've read about in other diets and about nutrition guidelines in general.
B000O5AYCA|2.0|From all the rave reviews, I expected a lot more. This isn't a bad album, but it's dull, derivative and forgettable. If you want moody, introspective rock, take a pass on the National and buy something by  Joy Division, the Smiths and/or Elliott Smith.
B000006O7C|5.0|I cannot believe the negative and unfortunate reviews here for this album. Do so many people really feel cheated by this CD, calling it a bunch of rough demos? That is just insane!<br /><br />Heres the thing - this is a very superior collection of songs that in no way can be called demos. Just because they aren't of the highly polished variety such as the ones on 'Grace' in no way makes these recordings inferior.<br /><br />Take for instance the second track - 'Everybody here wants you' - is there a single more touching torch song in the entire Jeff Buckley catalog? I don't think so. What a song. What a melody. What a voice! That song alone is the worth the $15 asking price for this CD.<br /><br />Needless to say, I am a huge Jeff Buckley fan, and consider 'Grace' to be the greatest male album ever recorded. However, repeated listening to this double disc might make you wonder if THIS isn't Jeff's best. It is much more musically versatile when compared to 'Grace', and its also very diverse in his vocal stylings. Theres rock (very Led Zep), alternative (very cold play), soul (very Maxwell), love-pop (very Barbra Streisand), and blues (very Nina Simone). Tell me of another album that does all these genres this well.<br /><br />People, this is a masterpiece and a necessary addition to your collection. Get it today. Don't let this one slip you by.<br /><br />Five Stars - A timeless classic.
B000002NIW|5.0|Deftones \\"Around the Fur\\"-  I bought this cd a couple of weeks after I bought their debut \\"Adrenaline\\".  I was immediately hooked to \\"Adrenaline\\", so I went out and bought this one.  Needless to say I was also immediately hooked to this one.  It's definately heavier than \\"Adrenaline\\" (In my opinion).  The chugging riffs and Chino's signature vox are there but it seems a little slower than \\"Adrenaline\\". But in a good way.  \\"Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)\\" is definately one of my favorite Deftones songs.  Also, make sure you fast forward after \\"MX\\" to the hidden song \\"Damone\\".
B00008G9JN|4.0|I normally prefer the earlierst Tull albums, but this one isn't too bad. My favorite tracks are Hunting Girl and Pibloch; my least favorite is the title track. There are too many bits in it that remind me of Spinal Tap's \\"Stonehenge\\". The bonus live BBC track, Velvet Green, is a bit weak compared to the studio version. I don't see why more BBC tracks from that 1977 concert weren't included;as it is, the album's total time including bonuses is less than an hour.
B000002GQK|5.0|After learning about the Moody Blues in the winter of 1970-71, I bought this album when it came available in the summer of 1971. I listened to it once, and thought, \\"Well ... good. Nothing special.\\" Over the years, I changed my mind. I think this is their best. The lyrics are (for lack of a better word) \\"deep\\" (i.e., thought provoking). There are great words and great music. Along with \\"Who's Next,\\" and a grudging nod to \\"Deja Vu,\\" EGBDF is one of the finest albums of the rock era (1965 - 1973). I still listen to it, and think of it as their best effort, with \\"7th Sojourn\\" sort of putting a (lesser) cap on an amazing string of albums.
B000U66PK8|4.0|Ok - I'm a fan of Chef Ramsay. I've seen all 3 years of Hell's Kitchen and I'm currently watching the Kitchen Nightmare series. The man definitely knows what he is talking about. He is direct, abrasive, and doesn't suffer fools. But his advice and assessment of other's skills is usually \\"spot on.\\"    I truely respect Ramsay's eye for detail and perfectionism. But I wish he'd brush up a little on his people skills. Read this book, which is pretty much an autobiography, and you'll get a little understanding of what made him who he is and why he is so driven. He had a pretty crappy childhood and that could've made him a bit jaded. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this book is for the numerous profanities -is the \\"F\\" word really an agjective, verb and noun? If his vocabulary was as professional as his food service skills, I'd have given this book 5 stars!    If you are in the food service industry, you can learn a few things from the master Chef. If you just want to know more about Gordon Ramsay the man, this book is very insightful.
0670034711|5.0|I am so enamored of Liz Gilbert after this book.  She has an amazing writing style that takes the reader on the journey with her.  I am taking a 6 month sabbatical in Europe, and it was awesomely encouraging to read about her travel & her spiritual pilgrimage.  Definitely a must read.
B000MV9026|5.0|Loved this movie.   From the exciting action to the best of music. Passing from the King all the way to Latino heat, this is a great movie about being who you are. Accepting  the challenges of being unique and being brave when challenged. Shows a great deal of friendship and most important, FUN!!!    I loved this movie, and bought it so my kids can laugh with it too!!!
B00005K2UF|5.0|If the two ballads weren't so gorgeous, this would be \\"Swing, Swing, Swing.\\"  The charts are full-bodied and the big band plays with incredible \\"pop!\\"  The soloists are great, too.  Meader is not just a great vocalist and arranger, he is fine saxman.  The tight vocal harmonies are impeccably in tune.  I have bought more than 10 copies of this CD to give to friends.  It's one of my all-time favorites.  If you liked the Four Freshmen or the Hi-Los, you'll adore this CD.    John Whitney, Allegany, NY

1400063515|3.0|I'm 94 percent through reading Nassim Taleb's remarkable book about random events having higher than expected occurrence throughout history.  I'm an unusual reader however in that many of the people he's met, read about and formed friendships with, I've also had the opportunity to meet, read about or write to.  Being the \\"loner\\" that I am however, unlike Mr. Taleb, I didn't form friendships with these guys.  Didier Sornette and Benoit Mandlebrot are two of his hero's if I can use poetic license, whose works I've followed throughout the years and as an applied scientist working first in the aerospace and auto industry, and now in finance, have had a chance to apply their work and ideas to real world problems.  However, I've also been a student of Newton, Kelvin and Einstein all of whom would and did make room for the \\"Gaussian\\" curve that Mr. Taleb has disgust for.  I would also fall into one of Mr. Taleb's cohorts with whom he has high disdain, since I also was educated in physics and mathematics in the usual academic curriculum.  This being the case, I feel I have some credibility to offer a secondary review of his work having used the tools of \\"Extremistan\\" as he calls it.<br /><br />To begin, there are many statements in his book that I agree with.  The Nobel self-congratulatory awards, the assertion of many academics to request a mathematical proof of his \\"theory\\", the view that mathematics exists only in the mind for nature offers neither a true square, diamond, or triangle, the lack of an explanation for the observation of highly probable events and his continued persistence that an explanation isn't necessary are just an example of his high intellect that in the \\"real world\\" we all come to appreciate and assume some brotherhood with this smart-alec of a man.  However, there is clearly a mischievousness in his demeanor that snickers at anybody who disagrees with him that is uncalled for.  This appears as high arrogance that rightly his mother ascertained fromhis character when she said to him, \\"if you can get people to pay you what you think you're worth, instead of what you're really worth, then you've got something\\".<br /><br />Let me make a thoughtful empirical criticism which underpins Mr. Taleb's ranting and raving in the book.  Mr. Taleb says on page 281 of the Black Swan, \\"you need one simple deviation to reject the Gaussian, but millions of observations will not fully confirm the validity of its application.  Why?  Because the Gaussian bell curve disallows large deviations, but tools of Extremistan, the alternative, do not disallow long quiet stretches\\".  His overall argument fails on this one simple account: there are more than one cause in effect for almost all known observations of any phenomena in the universe.  What's typically done in physics is to attempt to understand the strongest influencers of an outcome, not ALL of the influencers of an outcome.  He fails to understand that it's not one distribution or one cause in effect, but always multiple causes occuring.  Extreme events have a different mechanism that triggers cascades while every-day events, those occurring that aren't extreme have a separate cause.  One only enters into the conundrum of explanation when you try and link all observations, both from his world of Extremistan and Mediocracistan together into one cause.  This is never the case in any phenomena I've ever dealt with or heard about, from weather forecasting, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, chemical kinetics, or the financial markets.  There are competing effects going on, not just one.  Some trigger daily and can be observed regularly, some trigger every 100 years or more.<br /><br />Take for example his principal teacher of Black Swans, the financial markets.  Okay, so thirsty bubbles, credit crunches, LTCM, October 1987, August 2007 occurred and weren't explained by the \\"Gaussian\\" model.  Well, for ease of explanation, say there were two underlying distributions with two completely different mechanisms involved.  One cause of market movements say, results in a distribution of returns modeled like a Gaussian and the other cause, is best explained by some distribution that has extreme tails, infinite variance and allows for discontinuous jumps.  I have yet to meet a physicist or mathematician who wouldn't agree with this and it satisfies Mr. Taleb's points exactly.  What he fails to comprehend I believe, is that multiple causes are in effect simultaneously in any problem I've ever encountered, each resulting in its own distribution of outcomes.  What's not separable and creating havoc in explanation, are the multiple causes that create the underlying distributions and/or which cause has what distribution?<br /><br />As a practicing computational and modeling scientist since 1987, I see Mr. Taleb's book as delightfully playful, but certainly amateurish.  His understanding of science is quite ignorant really.  I was amazed at the name dropping, though he continually disavows making a habit of it.  And why Mr. Taleb can't see to find anybody but Herr Dr. Professor Mandlebrot to agree with him is beyond me?  Perhaps the physicists he did find who agreed with him, weren't quite as famous as they needed to be, to be quoted in his book.  Lastly, being a student of history that Mr. Taleb purports to be, I was amazed he didn't dig up these two quotations, one from the supreme empiricist Isacc Newton and the second from the best theorist I know, Albert Einstein:<br /><br />Thus far I have explained the phenomena of the heavens and of our sea by the force of gravity, but I have not yet assigned a cause to gravity.  I have not as yet been able to deduce from phenomena the reason for these properties of gravity.  For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena must be called a hypothesis; and hypotheses whether metaphysical or physical, or based on occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy.<br />I. Newton<br /><br />Newton forgive me; you found the only way which in your age was just about possible for a person with the highest powers of thought and creativity.  The concepts which you created are guiding our thinking in physics even today, although we now know that they will have to be replaced by others farther removed from the sphere of immediate experience, for we know that science cannot grow out of empiricism alone.<br />A. Einstein<br /><br />I would say that one can't predict extreme events so one doesn't model them generally.  It's not a failure of \\"modelers\\" as Mr. Taleb suggests, but of tackling simpler problems first.  We didn't throw Newton out when his laws failed to account for relativistic velocity; we shouldn't throw Markowitz, Merton, Sharpe, Black and Scholes out either for their early contributions.  Sure, they'll be overtaken by Rachev and the Levy-Stable distribution function but in 1968, who could compute a numerical basis function on a piece of paper since computers were hardly around!  The Gaussian was used simply because you could compute it; it had a closed form analytical equation.
0312330863|5.0|We listened to this book on a trip and wanted to keep driving so it wouldn't end! It was a collection of Mr. Herriot's adventures as a country vet in England, and was so delightfully written. Having lived with the various ailments of large animals, the occasional realistic descriptions of ailments did not bother us. Someone not accustomed to large animals and their care, might find it too descriptive. We enjoyed the book immensely and hope to hear them all!
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|We bought the CD because we liked Kelly Clarkson on idol and saw her perform Never Again.  It sounded like a rockin' CD and not a \\"pop\\" cookie cutter CD.  We didn't know what to expect because of the bad publicity she got over arguing with the record label.    Well, we LOVE the CD.  It seems to reflect a real Kelly, up and down, fast and slower.  We love the variety and pureness of Kelly's voice.  You go Kelly!

1400063515|5.0|I got a great many headaches trying to keep focused on Taleb's book--yet enjoyed it immensely.  It was, to be sure, challenging reading.  It gives me hope (a forlorn hope, granted) that publishers might take heed and slow down the constant stream of \\"get rich quick by following my formula\\" and \\"C'mon, C'mon Get Happy\\" books.  The white swan proclaims that if one poor boy can get rich, so can you--by buying his book.  It also says that if the grinning guru on the cover with the dove on his shoulder has found nirvana, so will you.  We so love that.<br /><br />Sadly, people the world over want to believe there are only white swans.  Budding young writers want to believe \\"quality\\" is their assurance of publication when in fact it is chance (or privileged status, of course).  Politicians who merrily predicted the outcome of the Iraq War now have a big black swan staring in the window at them.  The workings of a jury, the terrorist eluding `perfect' security and `controls' over world economies will never follow the sagest of predictions.  We'll dance naievely on, however.<br /><br />I'm not a great intellectual and yes, Taleb's style at times made my teeth ache, but this is a book that will stand the test of time.<br /><br />by the author of \\"The Swan\\" at [...]
B000OY8NII|5.0|Working overseas with limited access to American TV, I saw this series listed on Amazon and decided to order Season One, never having heard of Eureka. What an enjoyable discovery that turned out to be. With it's interesting premise of a town created to house the nation's genius population and well-written story lines, we enjoy each episode. With hopes that the writers keep up the good work, we plan to order future episodes when released.
0525950079|1.0|\\"World Without End\\" seemed endless by mid-book, repetitive, embedded  research facts worked into the story with clumsy style; and, what's with the use of the term \\"shagged\\" from the mouth of one character within the narrative time-frame, 12th Century?  Maybe?  Nevertheless, I will slug  it out to the end.  And.....

B000URDEB0|3.0|First let me tell you that I'm a very big Nightwish fan since 2000 when they were completely unknown and their album Oceanborn surprised and excited all reviewers in metal magazines like Rock Hard. This combination of music based in the talent of keyboardist/composer Thomas Holopainen plus the heavenly soprano voice from Tarja Turunen just blew my mind. After 7 seven years and 6 amazing albums, Tarja was rejected from the band, and Nightwish's next step for all was nothing but a mistery. Which girl are they going to hire? How does she sing? Today this mistery is solved and I felt is such a way similar when Metallica released \\"Load\\". At that time the first words that came to my mind were: pop and commercial. I don't want to be so aggresive with this album, because indeed is a good one, buy I would lie if I say something different. In this album, Thomas focused completely in one style for composing music : EPIC. And he had a wonderful result musically talking. But then it comes Anette Olzon, and all this epic feeling enters in conflict with a POP feeling. Let's summary in this way: Anette Olzon voice is so commercial that any good metal fan can't withstand with this for the complete 70 minutes the album last.. but in the other hand the music is so wonderful and so epic, and so complex, than my wife cannot enjoy the album as a regular POP album.. This is my opinion.. But better experience it by yourself  :)
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Tarantino's best work so far.... produced in a 1970's style this is the best stunt driving since Vanishing Point - maybe better!  Kurt Russell is great in this too, wonder if Goldie gets a ride in the car?   Get this Video - It IS worth it!

B000002TQV|5.0|I always scratch my head why people tend to say OK computer is the best Radiohead album. The BENDS has musical quality that is listenable and extremely artistic. This album is equally great or may be better than any Rock album ever made. The passion and the majesty is beyond belief. Soft whispering leads to masturbatorial insanity. The BENDS is truly a journey of musical excellence. It's so ashame that Radiohead turned into some artsy unattainable band that thinks noises, pulses and whatever else is music. Bring back the days of The BENDS, Radiohead and you'll be the band you're suppose to be.
B000TGJ8IU|4.0|What can I say? Well, I never thought this film could really looks that good. This Director Cut is much way better than the theatrical cut. There is more character development and the battle secuences are better.    I think Wolfgang Petersen did a good job with this cut.  The package is stunning and so the extra material.
B000PKG6TE|1.0|Songs for the deaf and Lullabies to Paralyze were two of my favorite albums, so naturally i was excited to hear that QOTSA was coming out with a new album. the first single (Sick, sick sick) was a great song and it only heightened my anticipation. i bought the album, and i was like WHAT?! this album is so unbelievably wierd and stupid its not even funny. I don't understand what they were shooting for when making this, nor do I understand why critics are saying that this album is so good. Sick sick sick is the only good song on this album. I beg you not to buy this album: it is horrible. If you don't have it, get Lullabies to Paralyze: that is an example of excellent queens of the stone age. era vulgaris is without a doubt the worst album i have ever heard.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|I recieved this product in the amount of time that I was told. I have had no issues with the CD and it was everything I expected it to be.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|\\"Minutes to Midnight\\" is an ambitious mixture of the sound that made Linkin Park famous blended with some quieter mainstream pop sounds and serious comments on current events.  In general, there is more singing, less rapping.  The first track, \\"Wake\\", serves as an intro and reminds me of U2's intro to \\"Zooropa\\", which I always thought was just brilliant.  The next 3 tracks sound pretty much like vintage Linkin Park, with the difference that Chester dominates 2 and 3, while 4 is mainly Mike's.  Tracks 5 and 6 slow things down a little, showing more U2 influence, in the guitars, the strings and the harmonies.  The next 2 tracks are overtly political. Track 7 is Mike's version of the state of the world, with a rather solemn backing, and track 8 is Chester's, very fierce hard rock;  neither one is very optimistic lyrically, and I would say they both hit the nail on the head.  \\"In Between\\" is a softer song about the difficulties of communication.  The final track, \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\", undoubtedly is about the Hurricane Katrina disaster, with all that talk about water \\"...while the nation simply stares...\\", but I'm not sure exactly what their message is.  However, as a Katrina survivor myself, the lyrics certainly hit home, and the track evolves musically into a beautiful power ballad (again, the U2 influence) which provides an appropriate cathartic effect to the song and to the CD as a whole.<br /><br />To be sure, some of Linkin Park's fan base will not welcome these stylistic changes.  But as one who has bought the previous 2 albums and likes them both, my mind was open to the change, and I think the CD overall is an artistic success.  It obviously succeeded commercially.

B00005JPFH|4.0|I know mine is not a popular opinion, but I think Spider-man 2 is the weakest film of the Spider-man trilogy. Spider-man 2's plot is profoundly flawed. The worst of these flaws is the \\"spider-man no more\\" premise borrowed from the comics. I found the idea that Peter's mysterious loss of his power was a physical manifestation of his psychologically desire and that his power's could be completely nullified by his will alone to be \\"very thin\\" (To quote Riggs from Lethal Weapon). It would have been more meaningful (and believable) if Peter simply made a conscience decision to be spider-man no more with powers intact.    Another flaw is the movie version of Doc Ock. I think it is sad the writers decided to use the tired and overused idea of \\"evil A.I.,\\" reducing Doc Ock to a victim technology, instead of a truly menacing villain like Willem Defoe's Green Goblin. Alfred Molina is a gifted actor who deserved better. It would have been better to have Doc Ock driven into madness by the death of his wife and swear vengeance on Spider-man, who he blames for her death. Doc Ock could then regain his sanity by coming to terms with his role in his wife's death.     The last flaw I will discuss here is the fact that Spider-man appears unmasked in the presence of every major character in the movie, not to mention half the city of New York (unconvincingly portrayed by the city of Chicago). The reactions of the New Yorkers who filled the train car as they peer on an unmasked Spider-man are more unbelievable than a teenage boy being bitten by a genetically altered spider and receiving super powers from it.     While I will admit that Spider-man 3 is an overly ambitious film, it is clear that the actors fit comfortably into their roles for the third film. Thomas Haden Church played a perfect, sympathetic Sandman and James Franco gave his strongest performance yet. Topher Grace does well with the little time he is given on screen. And, to my surprise, Bryce Dallas Howard was a convincingand attractive blonde (playing Gwen Stacy). Admittedly, Spider-man 3 does feel like it would be better as two movies (one for Venom and one for Sandman), but Sam Raimi does a surprisingly good job of bringing all the plot points together for a satisfying showdown between the villains and the heroes. Additionally, the visual FX in this film have absolutely trumped both its predecessors. Peter's first encounter with the villainous Harry, the birth of the Sandman, and the final reveal of Venom are some of the best FX in a comic book movie to date. Lastly, the film does a respectable job of giving closure to the character relationships and arcs of the previous films. In my book, Spider-man 3 was a welcomed improvement over Spider-man 2.

B000R7HY0K|4.0|Well, this is a fine addition to the Tarantino..70s superfan collection. He goes grindhouse with some witty dialogue, great action and more kick ace babes. Oh yeah, and Kurt Russell plays a sadistic former Hollywood stuntman turned souvenist slaughterhouse in one mean looking automobile. Plus the usual pop references from yesteryear for the movie buffs. Worth the watch. Not on the level with his classics, but fun nonetheless. Think From Dusk Til Dawn...but take out the vamps and add a V8!
B000WSHF4E|4.0|The sets, the costumes, the sheer beauty of the landscape is enough to earn this film a 5 star rating.  Parts of this film were so gloriously done they inspired the awe I feel looking at an illuminated text with the gorgeous gold leaf border and kid smooth binding.      Cate Blancett was stellar as an aging Queen Elizabeth, coping with the decline of her fertility while she still had to play the game of trying to find a suitable man to sit beside her on the throne.  Her wit dealing with Sir Walter Raleigh had everyone in the theatre laughing at one particular line regarding Raleigh's proposed name for his colony.  Her quandary over dealing with Mary, Queen of Scots was touching--what should she have done with a kinswoman and Queen.  Her leadership during war was inspiring.      I do not have sufficient scholarship in English history to comment on the verity of the romantic storyline with Sir Walter Raleigh. The general accounts are true, whether they were over-stated for film purposes or not should be determined by someone with more knowledge than I.    I will say the film was very worth attending and I'm glad to have seen it full screen in a theatre.  While modern home technology does do a fine job of rendering films--there's nothing to compare with a large-scale screen for the more gorgeously filmed movies.      I'm predicting at least a nomination for Blancett as Elizabeth as well as for the costumers, set designers and cinematographers.  This may well be a movie to buy when it comes out--particularly if you have the capability to really showcase this gorgeous film.

IMO he's been in Dylan territory for over a decade. One of the most important American songwriters alive... and this album is fantastic. I'm not going to review each song for you, it's all good.

B000QFCD5O|5.0|The Original ASIA line-up back together for the 25th Anniversary!!  Wetton's vocals are indeed up to par and the musicianship is as good as ever!  This 2-Disc live set also includes intriguing covers of \\"Roundabout\\", Intersection Blues\\", \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\" and \\"The Court Of The Crimson King\\" not previously released on CD by the original line-up (Like \\"Video Killed The Radio Star\\" was on \\"Live From Russia\\").  A must have for any fan of the original ASIA incarnation and their 3 releases (before Thrall replaced Howe and Wetton's departure, and the subsequent line-up).  One can only hope that these four re-unite and create new studio music for us die-hard fans! Add this to your ASIA cd collection as fast as you can!

0812932293|3.0|There is an updated (614 page) version of this title available, but I can see that this first edition is still widely available. No matter where you go, they are trying to sell this at \\"full\\" price, taking advantage of Branson's popularity. Meanwhile, if you want more bang for your buck (and who doesn't), why not get the latest edition instead? Branson is in my opinion totally unique in his personality and drive (charisma, I don't know, I think some others have more of that) and I learn a lot from his experiences, so can you!

B000002LBH|4.0|I have to say this is The Smiths best compilation album. If you love The Smiths you'll love this album
B000HEWEEE|5.0|the lake house is a splendid film. wonderful and truly makes you wish you were in fantasy land. it doesn't hurt to go off in your own world once in a while and that's where this movie takes you. a love story that's hard to believe, but at the same time you can't help but hope. it takes you to fantasy island where wishes come true and true love is forever. when a movie takes you there then you know it was good. i guess it all depends if you're a romantic or not. whatever you like, but i know i did. it's about two people who meet via letters. a long distance relationship, seperated by time, two years to be exact. for some reason or another they found each other, they bonded and seem to know that they're made for each other, but how do they meet. how is this possible. they're love runs deep and their only seperation is time. they try, something happens, she gives up, he doesn't want to let go, but how can they meet. time goes by, she realizes she can't be without him, she made a mistake in turning away, is it to late. can they still be together. during the whole movie you're just rooting for them hoping things will end happily ever after. this movie made me shed a tear. for real, it moved me in a good way. it's that possibility that true love can overcome anything, even time. as for the actors, sandra bullock one of my favorite ladies. excellent actress, so down to earth, and she just has this sensitivity that she just delivers in this movie that you can't help but care for her. just another great movie that she made possible. as for keanu reeves, this man is great. he gives the role that romance that soft side that every woman looks for. he never gives up. very talented and has many movies to prove just that. their chemistry is unbelievable. so much that any movie they do together is bound to be a good one. speed was all action, this is nothing but romance and they have proven that they can do both. magical.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|I think the ending of this movie was also going to kill somebody so that the scriptwriter had to change it. And the producers had to accept the fact that the movie wasn't going to be great but just okay. That's the only part I can criticize.   Other than that, the movie helps questioning the ordinariness of life. Harold Crick(Will Ferrell) is the main character in a book narrated by Kay Eiffel(Emma Thompson), who only writes tragedy. All of a sudden, Harold hears Eiffel describing what he is doing, feeling etc. I think this is when a criticism on existentialism enters the movie. Harold is an IRS auditor and his life is all about numbers. His watch symbolizes the fact that his life doesn't have any room for emotions. Harold's days are so monotone that he doesn't know how ordinary they are because he doesn't have one day that is different to compare to. It can even be said that he just works and breaths and sleeps. However, when the narrator describes his feelings, he realizes that he has feelings and therefore he has so much more to live and also to offer to the world. The climax is when Harold learns that he is going to die.  He has already changed, but he pushes his limits to stay alive and so, declares his love to the baker named Ana(Maggie Gyllennhaal). This change in Harold's life reminds us what we are also missing from our lives: it can be love, sports, travelling, success, anything...   Oh and also I think Harold's realizing of such narrating refers to the fact that we live our lives thinking what others may think or say about us or about what we do. Because of this very fact, we don't have a life of our own but we are leading a life imposed on us by society. Even the most rebellious person has that little voice of society in his head. Now, is that a good thing or bad thing? Is it why we have morals and right and wrongs?    Harold's life is, in fact, everyone's life. I think that's why the movie's name is Stranger Than Fiction. Waking up each day mostly at the same time, going to somewehere, making money or making plans to make money, eating same things over and over again, and going back to sleep are and will always be a part of our lives which make our lives a boring fiction novel. The new chocolate cookie, surprising film, different friends etc. are what will change the end of our days making them \\"stranger than fiction.\\" Overall, this is a movie with wonderful acting, messages, ironies, metaphors, symbols and \\"a better vocabulary!\\"     If you liked the Truman Show, by Jim Carey, there is no doubt you are going to adore this movie!

1594489505|5.0|If you're looking for something light-hearted, this is not the book to pick up.  This novel is a tale of two Afghani women who are living under the brutality of their husband and the Taliban.  At odds with each other in the beginning, the two women form a very tight and loving bond, and help protect each other against a patriarchal society that is trying to crush them physically, emotionally and spiritually.<br /><br />A Thousand Splendid Suns is violent.  It is heartbreaking.  It is disturbing.  But ultimately, the book reveals the power of the female bond and the strength of human heart.  Despite its almost crushing sadness, it ends with hope.<br /><br />Khaled Hosseini writes with incredible tenderness and compassion.  This is a worthy second novel, even better than The Kite Runner, which is also brilliant.  The characters in this novel - particularly Mariam and Laila - will stay in your memory long after you finish the book.  It's been several weeks now since I've read A Thousand Splendid Suns, and I find that I'm still thinking about it.  An absolutely unforgettable read.

B00005214X|4.0|I love this album dearly and count it as one of my personal Top 5 favoritest albums.  It's so so special to me, one of those albums I never get tired of and couldn't get through the tough times without.  I even want the title track to be played at my funeral when it's my time to pass on, hopefully not for many more decades, and would even consider having those four words tattooed onto my arm because the lyrics are just so hopeful and comforting, like a mantra to repeat to yourself when things aren't going so good and you think it will never get better.  And being that I share a lot of the same spiritual and philosophical beliefs George had, listening to it puts me on this huge spiritual high.  I've never gotten the criticism that a lof of his songs are \\"preachy\\"; to me they're more like putting universal nonsectarian spiritual truths and personal experiences into song, not saying \\"This is the definitive way to live and believe, and if you don't do and say exactly as I do, you're some immoral sinful misguided loser.\\"  It also seems like just the type of album people in 1970 needed, a gentle soothing comforting hug and reassurance after all of the chaos and violence of the late Sixties.  The only thing marring this album from being completely perfect is that stupid pointless \\"Apple Jam\\" section rammed onto the end, which seems to go on and on forever, really wrecking the mood that had been established.  They have nothing in common with any of the 18 tracks that went before and just belong on an entirely different album.<br /><br />I've been listening to this album on a pair of cassettes for years, and was really impressed to finally be able to hear these well-loved songs in an improved remastered audio format.  Many of them sound so much better than I'd been used to, almost like hearing them for the very first time all over again.  And while I'll retain a sentimentality towards the albums I still own and listen to on cassette, this is one that I'll probably have a hard time ever wanting to listen to in that way again.  However, this upgrade, in my opinion, isn't all for the good.  First of all, why would anyone think it were a good idea to colorise the artwork on the front cover?  It's one of those images that just belongs in black and white and didn't need any tampering years later!  It makes it look kind of artificial.  Secondly, the majority of the bonus tracks don't strike me as all that great.  The only one I really liked was \\"I Live for You,\\" which is also the only original bonus track.  The rest are just alternate versions of songs already on the album, like \\"Beware of Darkness\\" and \\"Let It Down.\\"  I've been used to hearing the first 18 songs (not counting the Apple Jam) in a certain order for a very long time, so hearing that familiar flow broken up by all of these bonus tracks in between \\"Run of the Mill\\" and \\"Beware of Darkness\\" is a very unsettling experience.  The Apple Jam section itself was slightly altered; now the short \\"It's Johnny's Birthday\\" is featured first, followed by \\"Plug Me In,\\" \\"I Remember Jeep,\\" \\"Thanks for the Pepperoni,\\" and \\"Out of the Blue.\\"  The original running order was \\"Out of the Blue,\\" \\"It's Johnny's Birthday,\\" \\"Plug Me In,\\" \\"I Remember Jeep,\\" and \\"Thanks for the Pepperoni.\\"  Not that I ever listen to that part of the album anyway, but it makes no sense to alter the original track order on a rerelease.  A better strategy would have been saving all of the bonus tracks for another disc, or sticking them on after the final original track, the way it's ordinarily done when a classic album is remastered with bonus tracks.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very glad this classic album has been remastered and that the songs sound better than ever, but I just wish they had retained the original cover art and not messed around with the track order so much.  When I transfer the songs onto an iPod, I'm going to select just the original 18 tracks, starting with \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\" and ending with \\"Hear Me Lord,\\" no disruptive bonus tracks in between anything to disrupt the mood and flow.  When you get used to hearing an album in a certain way, any other version just sounds wrong.  Adding to something that's already (nearly) perfect just makes the whole thing collapse.bonus tracks in between anything to disrupt the mood and flow.

0060763280|2.0|Near the end of the book, T. Harv made a great point about \\"if you learned something, it was worth it.\\" - I don't think he was referencing the book, but i did learn a few things...and with this logic, it was worth the quick read.  What I couldn't stand were the non-stop references to his seminars and subtle hints about how pyramid schemes can make folks money.  I'm guessing there is some sort of referral/pyramid scheme with his seminars, hence the majority of the book came off like one big sales pitch to attend his seminar.  Take out all references to his seminars and how much they'll help your or have helped others, and you are left with 1/2 of the content, which again, would be worth the read and has some good ideas/points.

0786186291|5.0|I came late to this table, intrigued by the excellent Russell Crowe movie. (A note for new readers arriving by the same route: the movie is an amalgam of several of the books in the series, then modified even further by the supposed needs of Hollywood.)<br /><br />When I bought this 13½ hour CD reading of the first book, I was delighted but also somewhat baffled: the language is extremely challenging, even to one with years of sailing experience. How could this series have sold millions? Another Amazon reviewer set me straight: the books are written so that they could be understood and enjoyed by the characters themselves, and describe the harsh sensibilities of the times without apology or explanation.<br /><br />An extremely difficult feat to pull off, writing in the 1970s. Being a rather proud writer myself, at first my anachronism police came out in full force, looking for missteps. Oh they are there, if you want to get curmudgeonly, but instead, why not just enjoy the author's magnificent accomplishment? The book has become my nightcap: one chapter per night, with a rewind each morning to the point I fell asleep. It has also become my traveling companion: I ripped all 11 CDs down to one mp3 disk, and traffic jams immediately stopped annoying me. (For people wishing to do the same, it can be encoded at a generous 256bps and still fit on one CD). And there are still another 21 novels to go...<br /><br />To the meat: You will have to put up with sometimes excruciating detail: is it really necessary to have an unbroken five-minute naming of parts? The top mizzens, each and every backstay, the exact length of each spar? But perhaps it is. The internal voice of Aubrey: a sympathetic man whose company I would nonetheless not enjoy, the utter callousness towards human suffering displayed. We wouldn't judge Jane Austen for having archaic sensibilities; Patrick O'Brien should be given the same leeway.<br /><br />But with your investment in place, the rewards are enormous. The battles, the tactics, the seamanship displayed and the characters involved are described at close to the level of Conrad. It is impossible to read (or listen) without trying to imagine your reaction to being hauled off a side-street, impressed into the Navy, given your 14\\" of hammock-space and sixteen hours of daily work, with the lash readily available if you ever care to demur. And as a reminder, the monthly reading of the Articles of War, with almost every infraction being followed by: \\"...and shall suffer death.\\" O'Brian probably accurately describes this monthly litany as comforting and reassuring to the men.<br /><br />The reader, Simon Vance, does an excellent job. He trips up occasionally by repeating himself, and his occasional Scottish accent is strictly from the James Doohan Hollywood school, but those are hardly gripes: his friendly voice is accurate and his personality is quite invisible, as it should be.<br /><br />\\"Aubrey!

0743297334|2.0|The Sun Also Rises     By: Ernest Hemingway    247 pages     The Sun Also Rises, by Ernest Hemingway represents the generations that go by too quickly to notice. The title is symbolic in the sense that no matter what happens in the world the Sun will always Rises the next morning. Hemingway uses many ways to feed you information with out directly telling you. Jake Barnes, the protagonist of the book, has to find a way to live a normal life even with his life-changing WWI wound.      Lady Brett Ashley, Jakes brief companion, causes Jake much emotion pain though out the book with her constant affairs. Her unwillingness to give up sex causes her to leave Jake for other men. Jake, trying to get his mind off Brett, goes with Bill Gorton, a friend from war, on a trip to Pamplona to fish and later attend the town fiesta. While there the runs into Brett with Mike Campbell, her fiancé. They continue their fishing trip when they meet with Jakes close friend Robert Cohn. The book ends with Brett telling Jake: \\"we could have had suck a damned good time together\\" (247).       The key theme of this book is the harmfulness of sex. Brett could have been happy with Jake if it weren't for his War wound making him incapable of having sex. I would recommend this book to readers who like to feel the emotions of the characters they read about.

This book motivates you to become rich. The author recommends to develop and use your ingenuity to create wealth.<br /><br />I couldn't still understand why \\"buying a house\\" couldn't be considered as a way of asset creation.

0306812835|5.0|The author, who worked as an aeronautical engineer during the war, was fond of asking his colleages \\"but shouldn't we put feathers on the wings\\". That his answer effected an instrument design of my own is strange enough, but it's his persistence in asking such a question well into middle age that is perhaps of higher value. It illustrates the childlike joy that marks the pleasures of engineering. In another example, a drawing of a wing feather showing the quill not centered but close to the leading edge provides a vivid punchline to the story of the development of the mono-plane. How putting struts in the center of their wings made them twist off when pulling out of a dive - resulting in the deaths of many Fokker pilots. He deepens our understanding of shear stresses through examples of form-fitting cocktail dresses made of fabrics cut 'on the bias' - heightening my appreciation both for the human form and Poisson's Ratio. That a book on structural enginnering was a pleasure to read was a surprise. That it was un-put-downable boggles the mind. He enables what we most hope for and least expect from a book: to see the world afresh.

1400079179|4.0|The Da Vinci Code<br />By Dan Brown<br />ISBN: 0385504209<br />489 pages<br />US: $24.95<br /><br />Many of the books my father suggests to me turn out to be confusing, slow and complex.  Granted, the novels he recommends are beautifully written, they do tend to lose me somewhere in the first chapter.  For all of these reasons, I was pleasantly surprised with my father's most recent suggestion: the Da Vinci Code, by Dan Brown, a fast-paced thriller that reads like a movie.  The third paragraph of the novel reads: \\"The curator lay for a moment, gasping for breath, taking stock.  I am alive.  He crawled out from under the canvas and scanned the cavernous space for someplace to hide (Brown 3),\\" throwing the reader into the thick of action and endless page turning.  In simple vernacular, Dan Brown expertly weaves character development, mystery and action throughout the novel.<br /><br />The young American professor and symbologist, Robert Langdon, has high hopes of a bright future ahead of him, until the French Police find the renown gatekeeper of the Louvre, Jacques Sauniere lying cold, dead, and naked on the museum floor with a pentacle carved into his stomach.  Langdon is then ordered to the Louvre by the Bezu Fache, head of the French Police at 12:32 in the morning to help shed some light on the meaning of the symbol carved into Sauniere's stomach.  However, Langdon soon learns that Fache believes him to be guilty of Sauniere's murder, and with the help of a French cryptologolist and the granddaughter of the murdered Jacques Sauniere, Sophie Neveu, he runs from the police and finds himself on a wild treasure hunt for the key to the unraveling of the Catholic Church itself.<br /><br />While Brown keeps his readers caught up in the intensity of the plot, he also fleshes out strong character development in the heroine of the story, Sophie Neveu.  In the beginning of the story, Sophie is a hardworking, emotionally-hardened, successful careerwoman.  However, the death of her grandfather forces her to painfully look back on her past and all of the secrets she had to live with and what she witnessed on that horrific afternoon that made her permanently leave her grandfather.  As the story progresses, she finds her heart and her place in a two thousand year legacy she never knew existed.<br /><br />Furthermore, the most significant source of intrigue in this novel is the way Brown walks the fine line between fact and fiction in the life of Jesus Christ.

0671578855|5.0|To enjoy this book to its fullest, the reader must be among those who have read other books in the series, AND also reads and enjoys Regency Romances.  Judging from the other reviews, there are a number of her readers that fit in this category.  If you have not yet read this book and fit into the catagory as well, rush to acquire the book.  For those who understand what is going on in Mile's life and the conventions of a Regency Romance, A Civil Campaign is the funniest book ever.  I read it when it first came out at the World Con, and made quite a spectacle of myself in the lounge reading and chortling away.  The people who panned it need to become more ecclectic in their tastes -- most of us who liked this read military SF, which is why we are reading the Miles books, and Regencies as well.  You are missing out in life that you have never read even one Georgette Heyer book.

B00005JLKN|3.0|This is a little better than I expected. It may be closer to the book (which I have not read) but its not as good as Manhunter, and its a big drop in quality from the under-rated Hannibal and it certainly doesn't stand up to any comparison with Silence of the Lambs. However, the cast are good and there are some chilling moments, but good as the cast are, Ralph Fiennes is just not scary compared with Tom Noonans performance in Manhunter.<br />My advice if you want to buy one version of the Red Dragon story is to buy Manhunter. If you really must see this version, rent both this and Manhunter and only then if you prefer Red Dragon buy it.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|\\"Is there anybody alive out there?\\" yelps a clearly rejuvenated Bruce Springsteen. Having pushed the folk bug out of his system via [[ASIN:B0007WF1WS Devils & Dust]] and [[ASIN:B000EU1PNC We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions]], he reconnects with the E Street Band and plugs the amps back in. His best album since [[ASIN:B0000026E5 Tunnel of Love]] burns rubber from the starting line with \\"Radio Nowhere,\\" a hard rocking slam about both the current vacuousness of radio and music, with Springteen trapped in a car and scanning his dial with unsatisfying results. \\"I want a thousand guitars, I want pounding drums,\\" he protests, and thus the album starts with fire.<br /><br />And what a joy. While there are politics here (no one seemed to mind that on [[ASIN:B000069HKH The Rising]]), they are couched among Bruce's standard fare of cars, women and the joys of life. In fact, if I had any gripes at all about \\"Magic,\\" it would be that some of these songs seem a tad too generic (\\"Girls In Their Summer Clothes\\" and \\"I'll Work For Your Love\\" being the most obvious offenders). But when the real winners kick in, all is forgiven. \\"Living In The Future\\" is perfect driving-wheel material, and the \\"hidden track\\" that closes the album, \\"They Broke The Mold,\\" is a fine tribute to a lost friend in the mold of the \\"Devils and Dust\\" or underrated [[ASIN:B000002BFL The Ghost of Tom Joad]].<br /><br />The real drive seems to be the residue of his involvement in the \\"Vote For Change\\" tour. There are three semi-obvious political statements here, \\"Devils Arcade,\\" \\"Gypsy Biker\\" and the angry \\"The Last To Die.\\" There aren't any blatant Bush-whacks here (like on John Fogerty's excellent new [[ASIN:B000ULQVCK Revival]]), which is to Springsteen's credit. But there is no mistaking the righteous anger that fuels a chorus like<br /><br />\\"Who'll be the last to die for a mistake,<br />the last to die for a mistake?<br />Who's blood will spill, who's heart will break?<br />Who will be the last to die<br />for a mistake?\\"<br /><br />You could play that today, you could have played it in 1969. It would have meant the same thing. Sadly, you'll probably play it in 2030 and the meaning will have not changed. Just as timeless but more subtle is the title track, shining its wordplay on the hucksters who would \\"cut you in half while you're smiling ear to ear.\\" I doubt if anyone will be mistaking the underlying message the way many misconstrued \\"Born In The USA.\\"<br /><br />The E-Streeters sound great (even though I, like many others here, found the production to be too compressed). Clarence Clemons drops his instantly recognizable sax solos throughout, and those unmistakable harmonies are as vital as ever. \\"Magic\\" may not pull any rabbits out of its Asbury Hat, but in a time when any kind of rock is in short supply, it sure feels good to have Springsteen back and ready to roar.at today, you could have played it in 1969.

B00005ASHM|5.0|What it is there to say about this album. It is without doubt one of the greatest albums of the popular music era. However until recently I didn't know the album that well, and so I've put it on my Ipod so that I'd hear it a little more frequently. With the Ipod in shuffle mode occasionally a brilliant track would come on that I didn't know (didn't even know it was The Beach Boys believe it or not), and I'd rush over to the Ipod to find out what the track was, only to find it was from Pet Sounds.<br /><br />So what makes it so good. Well for me its the combination of the beautiful sounds that Brian Wilson produced for the album, combined with his brilliant songwriting. Perhaps its best summed up by 'God Only Knows', which is such an exquistely crafted song, with trademark Beach Boys harmonies and that achingly beautiful melody. However the marvellous 'Here Today' pushes it close as the best track on the album.<br /><br />It really shouldn't matter what sort of music you like, this album should be in your collection.

All I can say is:  \\"Don't waste your time or money\\", seems like the second book was published as a first draft, poorly edited and way too fragmented. The main character fades away after 14 chapters then a different person takes her place, the book ends leaving you wondering where you started. It seems as two different poeple wrote Hosseni's books.

B000TUXL2A|3.0|I am genuinely sad to give this CD a three star evaluation; it's the first time I have awarded anything by Mark Knopfler less than five stars. I have loved both Dire Straits and Mark's solo career uniformly up to this point, but I have listened to \\"Kill to Get Crimson\\" several times over the last couple of weeks, and it has largely failed to grow on me with a few exceptions.<br /><br />There is no question that the musicianship here is first rate; there are few things that I enjoy more than listening to Mark with an acoustic guitar in an ensemble setting (although I love the Stratocaster, too, of course!) but my problem with this release is the startling uniformity of the songs. One of the things I always appreciated about Mark was his ability to master different musical genres and styles within a given album; here the songs are simultaneously excellent, yet predictable. With the exception of \\"Punish the Monkey\\" the songs on this CD are largely interchangeable stylistically, to the overall detriment of the work. It pains me to say it, but some of the album is just...well, boring. While any given song can stand by itself, as a collection I was underwhelmed.<br /><br />I liked the first half of the CD less than the last half, with \\"The Fizzy and the Still\\" being my least favorite in the collection. The second half of the CD is more interesting. I like the corporate intrigue that is so well illustrated in \\"Punish the Monkey,\\" which I consider to be the best overall song on the CD. The other standout is \\"The Fish and the Bird,\\" a song about two star-crossed lovers who could never be together even though it creates lifelong pain; it's a beautiful song about responsible romantic realities. \\"Let It All Go\\" is another winner that highlights Mark as an ensemble musician.<br /><br />While I am reluctant to give any Mark Knopfler CD three stars, I still recommend the album to fans, particularly to Mark completists, folk, and country audiences. I am glad that I bought the CD, and though it will never be my favorite of his works, I will surely revisit it on occasion, and will certainly see him on the tour that supports the CD release.r be my favorite of his works, I will surely revisit it on occasion, and will certainly see him on the tour that supports the CD release.

0375757856|4.0|This is an important work to read because it is known as the first real Engligh detective story.  As the first detective story it sets many of the standards for the modern-day detective story genre.  Another reason why this book is interesting is because of the various eye-witness testimonies that make up the book.  And I must mention here the first half of the book is written by Gabriel Betteridge, the butler for the family involved in this tale.  This part of the book is excruciatingly funny.  Betteridge's servant's viewpoint is pure genius.  The book was published in 1868, and Wilkie Collins was actually quite advanced in his thinking for a writer of this era.  The book is about the disappearance of a priceless diamond that had been brought to England from India as a spoil of war.  The diamond has a curse on it, and it proves to be the undoing of various people throughout the book. The book is long, but the various viewpoints presented help to shorten the story.

B000VUQ4HW|5.0|Now that it has been officially released in the U.S., there are no more ifs ands or buts. This edition of NOSFERATU is truly the ultimate restoration. If you want a sneek peak at how the film will look and sound go to the Kino International website and check it out. There is a three minute excerpt that shows how the restoration was done with before and after results. There is also a full length documentary as well as a first time recording of the 1921 Hans Erdmann score putting this edition of NOSFERATU in league with the work done on METROPOLIS and BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN.<br /><br />NOSFERATU is one of the true landmarks of German silent cinema as well as the horror film itself. It has always been around in inferior copies from 16mm prints for years which attests to the film's importance but only recently have we been able to see it in something close to what Murnau intended. There are a few good versions out there now but be prepared to be blown away by this one. Proper colorization, correct film speed (18 frames per second), and the original orchestral score make this head and shoulders above the rest. And that's just the film!<br /><br />Also included in this 2 disc set are a wealth of extras including the original German intertitles and excerpts from other Murnau films. Even non-silent film enthusiasts will want to get this one so order your copy now. For those of you who don't know, this is the original Dracula film and there has never been another one quite like it although Werner Herzog directed a 1979 remake with Klaus Kinski. Copyright infringements nearly destroyed it but like Dracula it has returned again and again in various forms until now when it can be seen and heard and enjoyed in all its glory.
B000PY52EU|5.0|Words can't describe the power behind the storyline of Black Snake Moan. In the sea of movies to feed the masses floats this gem that stands out like no other. I have never seen 'harsh' and 'surreal' blend as they do in this film. Even the unsaid elements compliment the viewer's ability to use their own imagination and power of reason. Impressive and artistic in every way, I was pulled deeply into the movie. For those who are still trying to decide on whether or not to taste this cinematic treat, it is graphic and definitely not for children.
1401322336|5.0|`Cook with Jamie, My Guide to Making You a Better Cook' by the British culinary wunderkind, Jamie Oliver, is a long drink of cool water for fans of Oliver, and a joy to read for any dedicated foodie, who enjoys reading cookbooks. It is a special treat to read two manuals on `how to cook' in the same month from such distinguished practitioners such as Oliver and Alice Waters.<br />At 447 pages, plus fabric bookmark sewn into the spine, this is obviously a serious book, especially since it lacks some of the graphical razzle dazzle and cutie pictures which have cluttered some of Oliver's books in the past. As Jamie himself says, this almost seems like it should be his first book instead of his seventh. Oliver even goes so far as to hope he has created `a timeless, modern-day classic' manual on how to cook.<br />The book has much which would qualify it for consideration as a `timeless classic'. Unfortunately, the bar for `timeless culinary classics' is pretty high, set, among others, by Oliver's compatriots, Elizabeth David, Jane Grigson, Claudia Roden, and Nigel Slater. So, while I don't believe it achieves those Olympian goals, it is still a very, very good cookbook, especially for younger readers and students.<br />The thing which sets Oliver apart from practically everyone else who chants the `fresh, seasonal, organic, local' mantra is that Oliver is committed to these principals in his heart and soul. He is not just repeating a party line. And, that commitment jumps off of almost every page in this book. This and his overall `joie de vivre' are simply infectious, and they bring his cookbooks alive with enthusiasm. Like many of his other books, especially `jamie's Italy' and `jamie's kitchen', one is almost surprised at how many original culinary insights one encounters on his pages. Given the pedagogical objectives of this book, they are more common (and certainly more highly expected) in this book than in his others.<br />My five favorite sections in this book are:<br />The Salads chapter. I would line this up with the comparable chapter from salad specialist, Alice Waters in `The Art of Simple Food', and I believe Jamie would match her point for point. Oliver and Waters both arrive at roughly the same place, but Oliver has the skill of getting points across just a bit more dramatically than Miss Alice.<br />The Fresh Egg Pasta section. Oliver here does things which are missing from even the best pasta instructions from Marcella Hazan. Hazan may demonstrate the basic technique more effectively, but Oliver gives excellent pictorial instructions on making six (6) classic fresh pasta shapes.<br />The Selection of Dried Pasta Recipes. This, of course, is Oliver's real forte. With his apprenticeships with Gennaro Contaldo and London's River Caf&eacute;, I believe his selection of pasta dishes is second to none in tastiness and originality.<br />The Diagrams on Cuts of Meat. Almost all other diagrams of this sort you see are more complicated, and the diagram of the chicken cuts is a bit misleading, but the simplicity of the hoofed animal parts is remarkably illuminating, especially in the way the loins are depicted.<br />The Vegetables Chapter. Oliver rhapsodizes about vegetables with as much or more virtuosity he applies to salad greens. Sir Jamie cleverly concentrates his attentions on those vegetables which are most familiar to UK, Irish, Aussie, and American tastes, with several different recipes for potatoes; carrots; peas; leeks and onions; broccoli and cauliflower; cabbage and zucchini.<br />I must also give honorable mention to the sections on custards and meringues in the chapter on desserts. The chapters on pasta, vegetables, and salads alone are worth the price of this book. Everything else is pure gravy.<br />For those of us who have not seen Sir Jamie since his `Jamie's Kitchen' TV series, the introduction brings us up to date on his `Fifteen' project where he subsidizes the culinary educations for deserving teens whohave had something of a tough time of it in the world. There are now five `Fifteen' restaurant / apprentice shops, with three in the UK, one in Amsterdam, and one in Australia, and all the profits from this book will go to support that endeavor.<br />While I love the book, overall, it is not quite the great tutorial on how to cook that Jamie may have been aiming for. It has great insights, fine sections on choosing equipment, food safety, and herbs and spices, but it simply does not cover everything you would expect in a textbook. The treatment of pastry, breads, shellfish, soups and stocks and egg dishes is too light. There is very little on serious knife skills, and there is no bibliography. If I were to recommend a single culinary manual to an earnest, inexperienced amateur, I would suggest Waters' `The Art of Simple Food' unless the person had a serious Jones for Italian cuisine or they were in high school or middle school.<br />But that does not mean this is not a dandy book. More than any of Jamie's earlier efforts, this one really deserves your attention if you love food, and especially if you teach younger people about food. Aside from its snappy insights, the rich photographs are more likely to appeal to an inexperienced cook. The only thing which may be lost on a newbie is the great originality of so many of Oliver's dishes, many of which were developed in the `Fifteen' kitchens. For this virtue, the book stands as a great cookbook in itself, even if you ignored the pedagogical material.<br />My final word on Jamie's book is that unlike most writers, Jamie can evoke in the reader with his enthusiasm those special flavors and sensations so important to working with food. He does not have the literary elegance or encyclopedic range of Elizabeth David, but he certainly gives Nigel Slater and Nigella Lawson a run for their money as a pretender to David's throne.orld.

0385733577|1.0|This is my first review ever, but I felt compelled to write one because the writing in this book is so awful. The story had some interesting ideas -- a malevolent Elder Race, for example, is a novel concept and I looked forward to learning more about them. Unfortunately, the author's habit of repeating obvious things felt like someone hammering a nail through my head, and I had to put this book down after chapter 7 to move on to something else.  I agree with the reviewers who think this book could have been condensed to 150 pages. The author needs some quality time with Strunk and White.
B000SNUMC0|2.0|I see people giving this album 5 stars and wonder if we are talking about the same album.    I mean this album does not come even close to 'Stormrider', 'Something Wicked', 'Dark Saga', 'Burnt Offerings' and yes I also love 'Horror Show', and because I love Iced Earth so much I want to say this album is not Iced Earth.  Album cover was more impressive than music.    Has Jon lost his touch?  To my mind he is one of the best composer of heavy metal music.  And because of above mentioned five albums I will buy Iced Earth's next album as well, and hopefully it will be a better effort.

B000V8I2QU|5.0|Magic is a welcome and inspiring return to form that rivals Bruce's best work. The Seeger Sessions and the solo acoustic projects are somewhat interesting, but Springsteen's place in rock and roll history is all about the unique and original sound he created with the E Street Band. The side projects give Bruce a chance to take a break from the expectations of being Bruce Springsteen, but on Magic he confronts his legacy directly. That's not so easy, and it didn't work very well on The Rising. This time, he nailed it.    Radio Nowhere, Gypsy Biker, You'll Be Coming Down, Last To Die, and Long Walk Home all stand with his best songs. He picks up where he left off on The River and Born In The USA by turning up the lights on the best and the worst of the American Dream, with a rock and roll beat. It hits home, and these songs are evolving and getting even more powerful in concert.    When interviewed, he says he decided to write in a more hook-oriented and pop style. Maybe. As Bruce knows, the great style he created combines roots rock with R&B, and the juice that comes from all-night rocking in seaside clubs. He understands the power of music and the church of rock and roll better than anybody. Hey Bruce -- thanks for bringing it all back home. Here's a thought -- for your next two albums (one is already in the can) skip the side projects and go right back for the jugular. We need it more than ever.

B0009IW88A|1.0|From the overly precocious track titles to the absolute lack of memorable themes, this is possibly the worst Batman soundtrack since Nelson Riddle's theme music in the 1960's TV show. The bass line throughout sounds like it was ripped off directly from Mozart's Symphony No 40, and the rest is just mood music which rumbles around in the background. I don't get any excitement or chills, but just laughs at how amateurish this score sounds. I expected nothing more from Mr. Zimmer, though. Too bad the next one has him at the helm again. I just wish they would bring back Danny Elfman, or put some other more accomplished film composer in the driver's seat. Zimmer should have stuck with the British techno scene...     Long and short of it is, save your money, this one just isn't worth it...

Both are excellent speakers and they due a superb job of reading the material in a very energetic and passionate manner.  I would highly recommend getting the audio version of the book as I think it conveys the author's ideas in a much more interesting and engaging format than reading the book yourself.  The only complaint I have about the audio is that the woman's voice comes across noticeably louder than the author's voice so at times I found myself turning up the volume when the author spoke and turning down the volume when the woman spoke.

1400034205|5.0|What's it all about? It's a question that many have asked but few have done so as effectively as Maugham. In this novel, peopled by attractive, fun-loving, educated, multi-lingual, upper-class Americans living in Europe between the world wars, Maugham gives two extremes. On the one hand you have the personification of Cindy Lauper's girls just want to have fun in the form of the beautiful Isabella. She loves Larry--crazy about him--- but won't marry him because Larry wants to live on a shoestring while traveling the world seeking the meaning of life; instead, she marries Larry's steady-Eddie friend Gray. Then, there's Larry, a very strange enchanted boy, much like the one that Nat King Cole made famous in Nature Boy: he wandered very far, very far, over land and sea, a little shy and sad of eye but very wise was he. Indeed, Larry goes to India where he lives and learns from holy men. He practices meditation, abstinence, mortification, and healing. Much to Isabella's chagrin, Larry, becomes so totally unselfish that he feels obligated to marry Sophia a suicidal old schoolmate turned prostitute drug abuser. With an assist from Isabella, Sophia skips out on Larry in favor of a fix and some rough sex. In the end, Sophia is murdered; Larry gives away all his possessions; Gray and Isabella get to live fat and happy on an inheritance from Uncle Elliott. So, what's the message? Perhaps Mick Jagger said it best: you can't always get what you want, but you can always get what you need.
B000JKA0B0|5.0|This collection is a must-have for any Rammstein fan.  I have been a fan of Rammstein for ten years and I have to say that this is one of the best live collections they have done thus far.  The photos are powerful and moving.  The music is great, as always.  I reccommend the limited edition 100%!
B000001ELR|3.0|This is Kiss' \\"heaviest\\" album. This and Animalize I think are their \\"most metal\\" albums. With the additions of Vinnie Vincent and Eric Carr, Kiss found renewed energy and it shows. I'll always like the original lineup with Ace and Peter the best, but Vinnie to me was the best post-Ace guitarist they ever had. This album has more in-your-face production, with booming drums and ultra-distorted guitars. Standout tracks: Creatures of the Night, Danger, I Love It Loud, I Still Love You, Killer, War Machine.
0143038419|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and while envied the authors' ability to travel at length, agree that the search for self-love and acceptance is, in actuality, the opposite of selfish.  I am thrilled that this author found limitless compassion and understanding for herself through her spiritual practice as she then was able to extend that same compassion and understanding to those around her.  In her courageous honesty about her own feelings of superiority, judgment, lonliness, anger and despair she allows her reader to relate without shame.  And if we let ourselves, we can all relate.  We are all human beings.

B000M343BM|5.0|UPDATE -- NOVEMBER 29, 2008--DISTINGUISHING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS VERSIONS OF \\"Major League\\":<br /><br />I recently ordered and returned (for not being unique or a two disk version as the description claims) \\"Major League: I Love The 80s,\\" [[ASIN:B0019GO5AU Major League]].  I also rented the original DVD version of \\"Major League\\" (ASIN: B00006F7IM) to better understand the differences between the various versions.  While \\"Major League: I Love The 80s\\" has a unique cover and the description states that it is a two disk set, the fact is that it is the same DVD as the original \\"Major League\\" movie with a CD of four songs I have never heard of in a cardboard sleeve packaged in with the DVD.  The original \\"Major League\\" DVD, [[ASIN:B00006F7IM Major League]], is no different than the VHS version, [[ASIN:B000003KMM Major League]].  Here then is a summary of the differences between the various versions of \\"Major League:\\"<br /><br />1) Major League (1989) VHS Version, [[ASIN:B000003KMM Major League]], is the original movie with no special features.  Format: Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC.  Language: English, French.  Rating: R.  Release Date: May 29, 2001.  Run Time: 106 minutes.<br /><br />2) Major League (1989) DVD Version, [[ASIN:B00006F7IM Major League]], is the original movie with no special features, but a DVD Version rather than a VHS tape version.  Format: Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, DVD-Video, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSC.  Language: French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), English (Dolby Digital 5.1).  Subtitles: English.  Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1.  Rating: R.  DVD Release Date: September 24, 2002.  Run Time: 106 minutes.<br /><br />3) Major League (Wild Thing Edition) (1989) DVD Version, [[ASIN:B000M343BM Major League (Wild Thing Edition)]], is the original movie with the following special features: 1) locking safety storage box; 2) Commentary by Writer/Director David S. Ward and Producer Chris Cheser; 3) \\"My Kinda Team;\\" 4) \\"A Major League Look at 'Major League;'\\" 5) \\"Bob Uecker: Just A Bit Outside;\\" 6) Alternate Ending with Filmmaker Introduction; 7) A Tour of Cerrano's Locker; and 8) Photo Gallery.  Format: Color, Dolby, DVD-Video, Widescreen, NTSC.  Language: French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), English (Dolby Digital 5.1).  Subtitles: English.  Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1.  Rated: R.  DVD Release Date: April 10, 2007.  Run Time: 107 minutes.<br /><br />4) MAJOR LEAGUE: WILD THING EDITION / (WS DUB SPEC) - MAJOR LEAGUE: WILD THING EDITION / (WS DUB SPEC) OR MAJOR LEAGUE: TURF EDITION DVD Version, [[ASIN:B000MGBTQ6 MAJOR LEAGUE: WILD THING EDITION / (WS DUB SPEC) - MAJOR LEAGUE: WILD THING EDITION / (WS DUB SPEC)]], is the original movie and special features (indeed the same box) of \\"Major League (Wild Thing Edition),\\" described above, with an Artificial Turf slip case.  This limited release Artificial Turf slip cover is the only difference between this version and the \\"Wild Thing Edition\\" described above.  This is primarily a \\"collector's\\" version.<br /><br />5) Major League (1989) [I Love The 80s] DVD Version, [[ASIN:B0019GO5AU Major League]] is the original movie and a musical CD with four songs \\"from the 80s:\\" 1. \\"Lips Like Sugar\\" by Echo & the Bunnymen; 2)\\"Chains of Love\\" by Erasure; 3) \\"Need You Tonight\\" by INXS; and 4) \\"Take On Me\\" by a-ha.  This version, sporting a new cover that states \\"I Love The 80s\\" across the top, is essentially an updated release of the original DVD version, although this disk has a baseball covering.  Format: AC-3, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, DVD-Video, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSC.  Language: English 5.1 Surround/English 2.0 Surround/French Mono.  Subtitles: English. Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1 (Amazon lists this aspect ratio, but other listing do indicate that it is still in 1.78:1).  DVD Release Date: August 5, 2008.  Run Time: 106 minutes. No Extra Features were found or listed. THIS IS THE MOST RECENTLY RELEASED VERSION.<br /><br />UPDATE--OCTOBER 25, 2008:  In looking over my reviews, I found that Amazon has apparently created a new listing (ASIN: B000MGBTQ6) for \\"Major League: The Turf Edition\\" (if one can go by the picture), eliminated the listing that this review was originally written for, and lumped it in with the reviews for all the other editions--an action Amazon.com tell me \\"helps\\" buyers to be aware of all the editions available, even if the review doesn't specify which edition it is for.  Please see my review of item [[ASIN:B000MGBTQ6 MAJOR LEAGUE: WILD THING EDITION / (WS DUB SPEC) - MAJOR LEAGUE: WILD THING EDITION / (WS DUB SPEC)]] to learn about the \\"Turf Edition.\\"<br /><br />As such, then, this review is now relevant to \\"Major League (Wild Thing Edition)\\" ASIN: B000M343BM, which is the edition Amazon kept sending me when I ordered \\"Major League: The Turf Edition.\\"  While this review is also posted under \\"Major League: I Love The 80s\\" (ASIN: B0019GO5AU), a two disk special edition, clearly my comment cannot be relevant, as I do not own that edition, all be it the movie is the same movie.  As to how this edition differs from \\"Major League\\" (ASIN: B00006F7IM), I cannot say, as I do not own that edition either--although this and all other reviews are listed for all these editions.<br /><br />Now for my opinion:  Needless to say, as a Cleveland fan since 1959, the thrill of \\"what if\\" was great--and I own a copy of every version that I am aware exists.  But, this movie--no matter what version you purchase--is an outstanding show.  The performances by all of the actors show a sincere desire to make a great movie.  In particular Dennis Haysbert (perhaps best known for his role as President David Palmer on 24) as Pedro Cerrano is awesome, while Charlie Sheen gives his best comedic performance.  Wesley Snipes as Willie Mays Hayes, not quite as well known at the time, engrossingly demonstrates his ability to do comedy--he really needs to do more comedy.<br /><br />The baseball scenes are all believable and well shot; although more cameos by real players would have been even nicer.  Having been to many games, I think that the movie does a very good job of portraying what is is like to attend a professional baseball game.  Indeed, with Bob Uecker, I almost thought I was listening to a live game.  If you like baseball, Major League is one of the best--for entertainment, not drama--and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />While I am no expert on judging true widescreen versions from \\"matted\\" widescreen presentations, the item description states the aspect ratio is 2.35:1; the description on the back of the box for \\"Major League (Wild Thing Edition)\\" states: \\"This Film Is Presented In \\"Widescreen\\" Format.  The Black Bars On The Top And Bottom Are Normal.\\"  It also states: \\"Widescreen Version Enhanced for 16:9 TVs.\\"  (If the other versions are different, I cannot say.)<br /><br />Bonus features for \\"Major League (Wild Thing Edition)\\" include: 1) commentary by writer/director David Ward and producer Chris Chesser; 2) My Kinda Team; 3) Major League: A Look at \\"Major League\\"; 4) Bob Uecker: Just A Bit Outside; 5) An Alternate Ending with Filmmaker Introduction; 6) A Tour of Cerrano's Locker; and 7) a photo gallery.  How many of these bonus features are on the other editions, I cannot say; although I would hope that these and more are on the two disk edition (ASIN: B0019GO5AU).<br /><br />As a realist--knowing that the language,etc. that led to the \\"R\\" rating is all around and often needed to make the movie as realistic as possible--I ignored the rating and started watching this movie with my sons (on VHS) when the youngest was only six (now sixteen).  Major League remains one of their all time favorites, and we have watched it together several dozen times.  In my opinion, children get the excitement of baseball and ignore the other \\"adult themes\\" found in Major League.  Major League is a movie to watch with both family andfriends, as it enhances the \\"being there\\" feel that the film provides.<br /><br />If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.  My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments.  So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful.  Thanks.more cameos by real players would have been even nicer.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|They kind of tried to make too many people happy instead of sticking to the fan base but still a good movie. They even altered the original story a bit but whatever I guess. Haven't checked out the special features yet but knowing Joss I am sure they are good.
B0009P42TG|4.0|This is a great movie by all means. I'm not a fan of anime but I watch some from time to time and in my opinion all the factors of a good anime such as high drawing quality, smooth motion and a great storyline all exist in this movie.  However, try to get it on a DVD because the one missing star was for the limited picture quality offered by the PSP, real movies look great on the PSP, but for this movie since it's animated some flaws like too dark frames and not very smooth lines are visible.
B000001FI7|5.0|This is almost the perfect album. I bought this recently having listened to it years ago and it was like finding an old classical watch or something. It moved me. The hits are great of course- 'Sour Times' and 'Glory Box'. Songs like this just want you to run out and open a lounge with a blue light or something! Then there is the absolute gem in \\"It's a Fire' with that wonderful bass running through as her voice weaves between the notes. This album is a beautiful moment in time.
B000UR366S|4.0|The moment I heard the opening piano chords on the first track, a sophisticated instrumental piece called \\"One Week Last Summer\\" with Bob Sheppard's gently meandering alto sax, I knew I was listening to Joni Mitchell's genuinely one-of-a-kind music - beautifully haunting gliding over an unpredictable melody. Once her voice is heard on the second song, \\"This Place\\", an edgy environmental warning wrapped in a sauntering melody and a twangy pedal steel guitar, it sounds surprisingly coarse with her natural chirpiness devoured by years of smoking. Even if her voice at 64 seems far removed from her buoyant peak over two decades ago, Mitchell manages to use it to her advantage by bringing an added gravitas to the serious messages in her songs.<br /><br />Genocide and global warming inform the lyrics of the powerful \\"If I Had a Heart\\", while the passive indifference of the human race is the all-encompassing subject of the moody \\"Bad Dreams\\", which is underlined by Mitchell's familiar minor-key piano playing. A similar melodic line is pervasive in \\"Strong and Wrong\\", a bold anti-war anthem almost old-fashioned in the way she blames men for all past carnages. If all this sounds heavy, it is most defiantly but not completely. \\"Hana\\" offers a persistently syncopated beat and Sheppard's wailing sax to the tale of a woman in charge of her own destiny. Mitchell's Zydeco-style update of her classic \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" may sound comparatively happy, but she strums her guitar with powerful conviction with her singing informed by a tinge of bitterness.<br /><br />The propulsive \\"Night of the Iguana\\" has the most complex melody of the songs here yet the most ingratiating rhythm, as she evokes third-world images to show how a young traveler deals with constant temptation. The loping epic title track brings streams of compassion to her desultory images and downtrodden words by extending on the spiritual, \\"The Little Light of Mine\\". And leave it to Mitchell to get cheeky at the end and turn Rudyard Kipling's \\"If\\" into her own personal statement of hope by giving us some semblance of her old self. Mitchell remains a true iconoclast who refuses to be categorized and repackaged. At the same time, she continues to be stubbornly relevant and often amazingly elegant in her idiosyncratic approach. While this disc is not a complete return to form, it is a worthy reminder of her innate greatness as composer and musician.g's \\"If\\" into her own personal statement of hope by giving us some semblance of her old self.

6302767741|5.0|Any film that begins with six of the greatest British actors of their generation in a kickline wearing garters and rainbow cancan skirts cannot possibly go wrong.  Or rather, it could, but it doesn't.  Peter's Friends is a gem of a small movie, with touching characters and some truly hilarious lines.  Rita Rudner's script (and acting) is beautiful.  Fans of any of these actors must watch it, and others will become fans.  Get this to DVD!!!
B0002IQKV8|5.0|but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23)    These are two terrific musicals, but both so sad; neither protagonist can escape the worldly consequences of their sin.    Moulin Rouge is a tragic love story, with the story's heroine finding true love and ready to turn her back on a life of shame just in time to find out it's too late.  I thought Ewan McGregor made an adorable love interest, and was surprised to find out both he and Nicole Kidman sang their own parts.  Great singing, clever use of pop tunes, memorable musical numbers.    All That Jazz chronicles a gifted Broadway choreographer's descent into a doom of his own making.  He craved his sins above everything and every one he loved most, including his career success and his beloved daughter.  The movie is at its best when it is at its most surreal.  For me, the one detraction was the dance number shown to the show's investors, which was just a gratuitous, eroticized gymnastics act.    A great pairing of two movies perfect for a two-boxes-of-tissues movie night.

B000WTDGD2|1.0|Thought I'd give the new service a try, but found two major strikes against it. Okay, three. First, there is no place to provide feedback on the Unbox service itself. Second, I have Windows 2000 and can not load the Unbox player. Third, the Ipod with Video is not one of the devices I can transfer videos to. Until these items are addressed, I'm afraid for me that Unbox is three strikes and out. NBC was foolish to dump iTunes in favor of this service given these limitations.
1582701709|3.0|Anybody who thinks that reading this book will instantly change his/her life is, allow me to let you in on a little secret, Wrong. The book is well meaning and attempts to positively influence our thought process and how we veiw the world. Under most circumstances positive thinking can positively influence our day to day lives; however, as many other critical reviews point out, our thoughts can't be exclusively held responsible for what happens to us.   The Secret is an easy read but should not be taken too seriously. If it was as simple as the Secret outlines we could all sit around our house, have positive thoughts and simply receive what we ask of the universe. Wouldn't that be nice.
0143034545|5.0|Some reviews have been critical, saying that the material is common sense.<br /><br />That is the beauty of most things that work.  The book is a lot like Dave Ramsey's financial advice.  It's common sense, but organized in such a way to make you most effective.<br /><br />That's what I like about this book.  Each portion of his system is extremley intuitive and simple.  You put it all together, and it makes you effective if you have the self discipline to do it.<br /><br />One really good part of the book is that it accurately explains our \\"stress\\" as the vague feeling that, despite what you are working on, you should be doing something else, or, that you can't get everything done.  He shows you how to organize your workflow so that you can make your daily (hourly) decisions on what to handle confidently - because you are aware of everything that you have to do, and where it ranks in your priorities.<br /><br />I also like that his system is realistic and flexible, for those days that 3 fires hit you.  I also like that it is not software or hardware (certain special calendars) specific.  I have always been skeptical of organziational books that seem like they're just trying to hook you on selling you other merchandise.  This guy's system can be done with a looseleaf notebook or a PDA.  Whatever floats your boat.
0143038583|3.0|The Omnivore's Dilemma is an often-quoted book, and for good reason. Pollan does a very impressive job gathering mountains of information about the American (and to an extent, world) food chain. He divides the book into three sections, devoted to the \\"industrial\\" chain, the products of which you'll see in your average supermarket; the \\"organic\\" food chain, represented on one end by WholeFoods, and Joel Salatin's Polyface farm in Virginia on the other; the \\"hunted-gathered\\" chain is the last one. The surprise here is that WholeFoods fare is \\"industrial organic\\" which is at the moment only slightly better than \\"industrial\\". The ideal is seen in the Polyface farm, an enlightened place where nature's cycles are respected and harnessed. The last section shows Pollan trying to hunt, gather and cultivate his own food, and seems separate from the previous two sections, more a philosophical exploration of eating than an investigation of an industry.    The book is at its best when Pollan shows that \\"organic\\" does not necessarily mean eco-friendly, sustainable or humane, and has become just another label. His description of Salatin and his farm is wonderful. The description of the US's dependence on, and subsidizing of corn, and how this corn is used to \\"grow beef\\", is concerning and repulsive. You realize the extent to which a well-intended policy can create a monster.    Now for the flaws, which are important. In a book that is clearly ambitious and seems to attempt comprehensiveness, Pollan allows himself freedom to introduce arguments at face value.  You'll see him quote reams of articles and statistics to back up some statement, and right next to that he'll criticize an establishment because \\"the animals look unhappy\\" or \\"the smell is nauseous\\". Those arguments would be fine in many types of books, but here it seems the author just stopped digging. Is \\"bad smell\\" necessarily a bad thing? Can he better describe what he understands by an unhappy animal, and how that unhappiness affects its own life, and our health?  Pollan describes four meals, representing industrial, organic, local-organic and hunted-gathered. The industrial meal is represented by getting take-out from McDonald's and eating it in his car. Point taken, but I'm sure plenty of healthy and tasty industrial meals can be had. I would have liked to hear, say, a chef defending some industrial product - I'm sure one could have been found.  Another problem is that Pollan settles into arguments, and particular words, that he then repeats to exhaustion. Often, his personal thoughts seem out of place, and not that original anyway - there is a brief foray into vegetarianism that left me unimpressed, for instance.    I have the impression the book tries to be too many things - an indictment on an industry, a travelogue, a philosophical treatise, a literary work and an impartial documentary. I would have liked it much better if it had focused more clearly and consistently on one of its aims.

B000OYC7A8|4.0|Best bits:  A  wonderful version of Shine On You Crazy Diamond, the band doesn't play the entire piece, dropping out to allow Dave's solo guitar and vocal to work with Crosby/Nash. Probably the best live version I've heard of SOYCD.    Echoes - wow. Laughing wah-wah feedback and all! And don't miss the acoustic Echoes closing section live at Abbey Road on disc 2!    Both performances of Take a Breath are scathingly good.     Wot's... Uh the Deal is a great tune from the underrated Obscured by Clouds.    Dark Globe, Domino and Astronomy are nice tributes to Syd.    Richard Wright is great in this, and seems to have a larger role than on previous Floyd videos. Phil Manzanera is great, good interplay with Dave.    When you get down to it, this is a nice, stripped down Floyd set, the absence of Mason on most of it doesn't matter. No pointless projections or flying pigs. No caterwauling female bg vocal trio. The music without the bloated bombast you usually get in a Floyd show (see Pulse).    Disappointments/Gripes:    Sorry, but the Dark Side medley, Breathe/Time/Breathe (reprise) is starting to sound a little tired. Thanks, Dave for not putting on another version of Money, it's been done to death.    No material from Gilmour's first two (great!) solo albums? I know the tour was to support \\"Island\\", but would have been nice to have \\"Short and Sweet\\" or \\"All Lovers are Deranged\\" instead of yet another boring version of \\"Coming Back to Life\\" and \\"High Hopes\\".     I found \\"On an Island\\" to be a disappointing album (with the exception of Take a Breath), and the entirety is performed here, although it has better impact on concert video.     What's with the stage lighting designer? Is it necessary to put a million watt klieg light behind Gilmour shining into the audience to blind us?  Restrained, tasteful use of lasers, tho.    Deducted two stars on these points, but added a star just because of the amount of stuff here. (Almost) two complete concerts plus three documentaries, videos, and more extras.  Almost deducted a star because the tour didn't make it here to Texas.   By the way, the three songs on the Best Buy EP are: Coming to Back to Life, High Hopes and Take a Breath. If you like Pink Floyd at all, get this DVD set.

B000BVQ9JO|4.0|No, I shouldn't be reviewing this album because I don't know how to talk about it.  And I think my interpretation of some of the songs may be off, given the outerspace theme people talk about (I totally miss that in the album aside from the title).<br /><br /> Suffice to say I am a huge fan this one.  Strokes albums never got me the first or second time listening to them.  My brother kind of force fed the first album to me when I'd ride in the car with him. I think the second album I bought even though I was burned out on hear about the band, deciding initially on a few songs were worth listening to.  Then I liked more.  Then I loved the second album completely (\\"I thought I told you this world is not for you\\" was probably my in for connecting to the album).<br /><br />  So I think listening the Strokes albums becomes rewarding once you find your \\"in.\\"  The key to unlock its riches.  \\"Fear of Sleep\\" was probably my in on this one just because of the manic level it slow reaches for.<br /><br />  Yeah, I can see how this album might be more difficult for casual listeners.  It takes its time getting to its hooks.  Its themes probably more mature than what people want from a bunch of young rock stars.  And maybe a little darker than they want, too.<br /><br />  Like I said, I didn't get a space vibe from this album.  I got more of a Blood On the Tracks vibe.  Troubled relationships going to hell vibe.  And maybe something ultimately beyond that, too.<br /><br />  That is some of my read of things, for what it's worth.  I've had this in the CD changer in my car for several months now, and it's the only CD I haven't taken out or begun skipping over.  It has a lot of traction.  Many levels to explore.
0399226907|5.0|I bought this book for my 20 month old grandson, and he loves it.  When we read it, we put his index finger in each hole of the food that the caterpillar eats.  He seems to enjoy it more when he can participate in part of it.  Usually by the time we get thru all the food that the caterpillar eats, instead of being excited about the beautiful picture of the butterfly, he is ready to go on to the next book.  This book is perfect in every way for his age.[[ASIN:0399226907 The Very Hungry Caterpillar board book]]
B000W4HIX6|5.0|Alan Rickman plays Hans Gruber not Alexander Godunov, he plays Karl in the film the \\"No one kills him but me! Understood?\\" guy.  I just watched diehard on DVD not too long ago and i must say that i'm excited about its upcoming release on blu-ray. On a side note I am glad that fox is using blu-ray over hd-dvd which in my opinion is the way to go for the full HD experience. This movie will be top notch if they got the same company that did the [[ASIN:B000F9RB9Y The Terminator [Blu-ray]]] transfer, the audio was incredible what they did with the blu-ray title. just a couple quick thoughts as i wait for its upcoming release.
0743243153|4.0|A unique study of growth through psychotherapy; anyone can benefit.  Peck says we already have the knowledge we need, we just draw on it through our conscious; we learn what we already know.  He uses patient/doctor discussions to explain his point.  Refreshing and informative from the very first page.  You will also find it insightful and well reasoned.  He finds his chief enemy is invariably laziness; it will take work.  Before Peck begins he wants us to know:      \\"As a psychiatrist, I feel it is important to mention at the outset two assumptions that underlie this book.  One is that I make no distinction between the mind and the spirit, and therefore no distinction between the process of achieving spiritual growth and achieving mental growth.  They are one and the same.\\"    The book begins, where it all starts: with good parenting, via tuff love, kindness, comfort, and delayed gratification.  Without this, Peck shows how childhood went on to corrupt our adulthood.  And now we need to relearn.  The book is divided out into flowing sections; each section is covered by short descriptions set off by sub-headings.    So we learn poor parenting leads to problems in adulthood.  Taking the extra time when they are young saves more time later in life.  As adults, procrastination haunts us; it is better to suffer now than later; the problems don't go away.  We end up passing our freedom on to others (just look at how our country votes!).  Because we tend to fool ourselves away from pain and difficulties we don't open ourselves to challenge and growth.  Regulating anger is a major problem for many of us.  Holding our marriages together is another.  There are some very important misconceptions on love.  \\"For the most part, mental illness is caused by and absence of or defect in the love that a particular child required from its particular parents for successful maturation and spiritual growth.\\"        How often does the miraculous slip by us without notice; could it occur more than we may know?  \\"Among humanity love is the miraculous force that defies the natural law of entropy\\"; the mysteries that are grace.  Peck says mental illness occurs when one deviates from the will of God:  \\"The closer one comes to godhead, the more one feels sympathy for God.  To participate in God's omniscience is also to share His agony.\\"  Every one of us has a religion, \\"so we squabble over our different microcosmic world views, and all wars are holy wars\\".    Even Jung sees there is something more:  \\"Life has always seemed to me like a plant that lives on its rhizome.  Its true life is invisible, hidden in the rhizome.  The part that appears above ground lasts only a single summer.  Then it withers away----an ephemeral apparition.  When we think of the unending growth and decay of life and civilization, we cannot escape the impression of absolute nullity.  Yet I have never lost a sense of something that lives and endures underneath the eternal flux.  What we see is the blossom, which passes.  The rhizome remains\\".    Wish you well  Scott

B00000IFP6|5.0|In our skeptical age, Beethoven's nine symphonies have been subjected to a degree of cavil and criticism in an attempt to shake the hold they have exercised over many generations of lovers of music.  But, regardless of these attempts, in their grandeur, passion, variety, and depths of feeling, Beethoven's symphonies remain at the heart of music. Beethoven's symphonies are unique in the manner in which they reach out to the listener to produce involvement in the drama created by the score.  Although only one symphony, the \\"Pastorale\\" has an explicitly programmatic content, it is difficult to hear these works without feeling Beethoven's effort to communicate to the listener feelings of the highest inspiration.  The moods of the symphonies range widely from the humor of nos. 4 and 8, through the lyricism of the slow movement of no. 2, the \\"heroism\\" of nos. 3 and 5, and the grand hymn of no. 9. The symphonies cover the course of Beethoven's entire compositional career.  The First Symphony, which is much indebted to Haydn and Mozart, is the product of Beethoven's young manhood in Vienna while the Ninth, completed in 1824, is separated from its nearest predecessors by 12 years. Symphonies 2 -- 8, in all their variety, are the product of an extraordinary productive decade of composition (1803 -- 1813).<br /><br />On the whole the Beethoven symphonies are highly tonal and their melodies and strong repeated rhythms make them accessible even to relatively unsophisticated listeners.  Beethoven is truly a composer with universal appeal. The symphonies have been a source of inspiration to me throughout my life.  They are essential listening for those just coming to classical music.<br /><br />Beethoven's the symphonies have been well-served on recordings, both for individual works and for compilations of the entire cycle.  I have been rehearing and rethinking the Beethoven symphonies in this highly-acclaimed set recorded by the American conductor David Zinman (b. 1938) and the Tonhalle Orchester Zurich in the late 1990s.  Zinman uses the new Barenreiter edition of the scores prepared by Jonathan Del Mar which makes numerous changes in orchestration from the earlier edition commonly used in performances.<br /><br />Zinman offers period performances of Beethoven using modern instruments.  Those listeners familiar with other recordings of the symphonies will notice at the outset the fast tempos.  Zinman tends to avoid rubato (subtle shifts of tempo) and other romantic gestures, and the strings have a clean, simple sound.  With the quick tempos, there is a lightness and a lyricism to Zinman's readings that is immediate and endearing.  The tempos do not lead to a driving performance of these scores but rather to readings with a graceful, lilting quality.  The orchestra has a transparent sound, and the winds come through prominently and beautifully.  The impact of the Barenreiter edition varies from work to work, but I found it most pronounced in the \\"Eroica\\" symphony, with the violin solo in the finale, and in the Fourth symphony.<br /><br />In this set, I enjoyed most the performances where Zinman brought new insight to these works; and I found these insights strongest in symphonies 3,4, and 7.  The Symphony no. 3 \\"Eroica\\" is perhaps the greatest of the symphonies.  In his tempos, vigor, and lightness, in the passages for winds and brass, and in the surprising violin solo in the finale, Zinman offers a splendid account.  The Fourth Symphony, which remains the least heard of the nine, also receives an outstanding reading, especially in the lovely slow movement. In the Seventh Symphony, Zinman is superb in bringing out the rhythms and the many kinds of moving dance-like movement in the score.  The second movement, allegretto, is taken at a faster than usual pace, but it captures the mixture of tragedy and joy that is inherent in this remarkable music.  I also thought Zinman's reading of the Second symphony, a work on the cusp of his early and middle styles highly impressive.  The weaker moments of the compilation include portions of the Ninth Symphony, especially the second movement, where I thought the tempo was too driven, and perhaps moments in the \\"Pastorale\\" symphony, which could have used more rhythmic variety in the finale.  But Zinman still offers impressive readings of these works.  Altogether, this is an outstanding set that will introduce the new listener to this music and that will have a great deal to offer those who have long loved the Beethoven symphonies.<br /><br />Zinman's performances are on the budget-priced Arte Nova label.  The symphonies are available in a 5-CD compilation or in five individually packaged single CDs.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanive.

0143038419|5.0|Who among us hasn't come to know on a somewhat intimate basis our bathroom floor, or whatever other surface has served to collect our tears.  That's where we join Elizabeth Gilbert.  Where we separate from her is in what we do about the circumstances that bring us to tears.  Gilbert's solution was to look for herself through food and friendship in Italy, fellowship and spirituality in India, and growth and love in Indonesia. While most of us don't have the means to take a year off to find ourselves, the path Gilbert travels in her mind, heart and body can serve as a road map for many even if you travel no further than the bounds of your own home town.      The book is an easy read, written in a combination journal/travel log format.  A bit more complex are the stages and changes through which Gilbert transcends.  Her sense of humor is glorious and significantly adds to the enjoyment of her adventure - for both herself and her readers.     If nothing else, Gilbert's book serves as a reminder to women everywhere (perhaps men as well, although I see this as a she-book) that you can move beyond staying trapped in an unhappy situation, even if it does come with all the right trappings.  This is a book that you read and then pass along to that friend we all have who needs a little help packing her suitcase and filling out those change of address cards.  Personally, I've already wrapped two copies as Christmas presents for my daughters because I can't think of a better gift for any mother to give than encouragement to eat, pray and love!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I had never really heard of this show before purchasing it, but it seemed interesting enough to buy for $19.99 or however much it cost.  Sure enough, it turned out to be a great show!  This show is perfect for all those sci-fi buffs out there.  It's not quite the X-files, but it does provide some genuinely scary moments.  The lead actors work well together and every episode seems to have one \\"hot\\" girl in distress...haha.  I don't know if it's just me, but I found that to be funny, but I understand the reasoning behind it.  You won't regret this purchase and you definitely can't beat the price.  I just ordered Season 2.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|I am more a fan of later Corgan than earlier Corgan.  I was more a fan of Zwan, than earlier SP (bust still liked some older SP), I liked Corgan's solo work and I am really liking SP.<br /><br />I have been listening to the CD off and on for over a month now and it really has grown on me.  I don't like first impressions of CDs at all.  Although my first impression of this CD wasn't bad, it still took me a while to appreciate it.  I love Corgan's lyrics and his more positive deep views of life.  It isn't so much young angst, but a more mature view of life.  However, Corgan seems a bit rusty and I think the band still is trying to gel, but other than that a great CD.
B000TGJ8F8|5.0|I am rating this HD DVD at 5 star because of excellent video transfer, after all buying HD DVD means expecting impressive visual. when you watch this movie try not to place logic into the story line as this will make no sense. enjoy the action and beautiful sceneries.  This is an extra notes as owner of both Blu-ray and HD DVDs, virtually all HD video transfer are of very good or excellent quality, while Blu-ray varies from totally rubbish (Bram Stroker's Dracula)to excellent (Casino Royal).

B000025XKM|5.0|As I slipped into the cold rain on a beautifully rainy Saturday morning, I casually walked to Starbucks. I ordered a nice, hot drink and found myself a nice place to sit and watch the pitter patter of the rain on the street. I realized that I had delayed my purchase of some album that my friend suggested to me, but remembered that he said it was perfect for rainy days. I lazily made my way to my car and found the nearest cd store and immediately found a nice brand new copy of the cd. Something felt right about the purchase.    I ripped open the cd shrink wrap (triumphantly, no doubt. don't you love that feeling of tearing off the plastic?), and found an intimidating picture of the man known as Nick Drake, glaring at the owner of the cd. I popped the cd into the cd player to hear a nicely strummed guitar leading into a lulling whispery voice, remnant to me of a more emotionally disfigured Jack Johnson. The singer singing to me about a Pink Moon coming to get me, which at first seems scary, assured me with his voice that it would be alright.    The album keeps its dreary, but pleasant, tone throughout the whole album. Drake sings to the listener about moons, mornings, love, the process of aging and mostly unsurity and weakness. The lyrics, as Allmusic put, are definitely not upbringing (\\"you can say the sun is shining if you really want to\\", \\"I am the parasite of this town\\"),but also are definitely not depressing. They express a tone that is beautiful and longing, almost emotionally scarred by the tragedy that the singer went through.    Nick Drake, musically, has interesting chord tunings, useful picking styles, peculiar rhythem movements and chord patterns. His voice falls over the chords with an ageless easyness. He constantly lulles the listener into a state of awareness, and self-realization. He sings with a kind of vulnerability that no other artist could emulate.     The lack of additional instruments gives Drake's voice and ethreal quality. With just an acoustic guitar, the singer-songwriter gets his message across clearly. He puts his voice on record, in such a way, that its a gorgeous, heart-wrenching listen. The album made me feel a little saddened that this was the man's last effort, only to overdose on anti-depressants.    As each song flowed into the next, I took a long sip of my warm drink, only to think that this was the perfect album for the day.

B000002H97|5.0|Without going into details, this album displays many of Metallica's greatest strengths which include Hetfield's great lead vocals, and a unique capacity for melodic heavy songs that are actually touching lyrically.  This is not pop metal like Def Leppard, nor is it that ponderous screamo, wailing, woe-is-me-the-world-sucks-and-it's-your-fault crap that so many bands put out.  This has a rare maturity that cannot be faked.    Well-recorded too!  This CD will appeal to non-metal fans as well - it's just good stuff.
B000001E18|5.0|Listening to this album 14 years after it was realeased...it still sounds more modern and fresh than must of all current records. I have to say that back in 1993 I was dissapointed by the lack of more traditional guitar assault and anthemic songs  à la Achtung Baby or The Joshua Tree. But the minimalist arrengements the subtle keyboards, the restrained vocals are all amazing. This experimental side of U2 has often been neglected by fans and even  by the band itself in favor of their arena rock side, but I think this sound is  an integral part of their sound and their legacy, as very seldom artistis this popular experiment as freeley as U2 did in the 90`s whit such great results. Standout tracks: Stay, a perfect drunken 3 o`clock walking home song; The First Time, a littel gospel song in the middle of a sci fi record; Lemon, a geat pseudo dance song with amazing guitars and choruses; Zooropa (all three parts) and of course The Wanderer. This song is the sound of redemption at the apocalypse in the year 4349. In all, this is one of those rare albums that U2 did not try to make a collecton of singles, but a art pop mastepiece. Anaway, this records deserves to listen from 1 to 10, again and again and again....
B00000FCBC|5.0|This is a cover CD but it really shows how diverse these guys really are. My favorite song on this double CD is Astronomy; The More I See is my second favorite but most of the songs on these CD's rock!

B000000WG4|5.0|I bought the original album when it first came out then I watch the exorcist and the music was in the movie so I did not listen to it for many years.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|I must say that this was the ONLY Madonna album where I didn't have to skip tracks! Here, she dazzles with all the dance beats and flirts with disco(I LOVE Disco!). I have been somewhat a fan of Madonna for years but I must say this album is the best one I like from her. I am hoping that she thinks about this idea on her next album(Whenever that is) Because it seemed to have done tremendously well!

B000HC2LI0|5.0|After mulling this purchase for quite a while because of the cost, I finally took the plunge--and it was worth it!      The box set is, quite frankly, the only presentation that could be done for this outstanding program.  It's wonderful to have the whole series at your fingertips, along with a book providing a brief overview of each episode--allowing you to find exactly what you want.  The special features on the DVDs are fun (wish there were a few more).    I only have 2 complaints (and it's not about this product):     (1)I so miss this show.  It was the best of the best on TV.  I wish we could have seen the first year (or term) of the Santos Administration, etc.  What a shame that NBC killed this great show.  I take solace that I can now revisit those great shows at anytime.    (2)My wife is constantly wondering where I am.  Simply, I've escaped the real world and I'm upstairs watching the West Wing!!!  This box set is, in a word, addictive.    A definite must buy!
B00018D44U|4.0|I like Norah Jones.  She's a good singer, and quite a good musician all around.  She certainly shines in her songwriting and piano-playing skills.  Her sound has a sultry, low, country-blues feeling to it.  I feel that there are definitely influences of Robert Johnson in her music.<br /><br />My only problem with Jones is that she is just a good singer, not a great singer.  Her skills as a songwriter set her apart from other mediocre vocalists, but without that skill, she would have certainly been forgotten under the blanket of \\"okay\\" vocalists.<br /><br />Certainly, her voice suits the music that she writes, but that would only stand to reason.  What I do not see is a musician trying to take risks and try something new.  Maybe breaking into a different sound would \\"wake up\\" her sound a bit.  A blend of her music with Native American rhythms... anything!  I'm getting bored with the same sound over and over.<br /><br />On the other hand, she is certainly providing me with a lovely genre of songs to perform myself or to pass on to my students.
B000GPI2LS|5.0|What the previuos reviewer expect from a reissue? This one it is a perfect reissue: stunning package, awesome sound, interviews, new songs, bonus, different type od sound (sacd, DTS, Dolby). I just can´t understand how someone could rate this item as 1 star.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I had worn my copy of the VCR out and was delighted to get the DVD - love it fantastic - Julie Andrews is fantastic
B00006LPER|4.0|After I saw \\"La Pianiste\\" several years ago, I said to myself that I would never see it again, so powerful and disturbing it was. Time went on but I could not get the movie and its main character, Erika Kahut out of my mind. The story of a respected Piano teacher in Vienna Conservatory, cool and collected on the surface, an expert in classical music, with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear, self-loathing and self destruction strong enough to ruin her demanded more than one viewing. I read the book \\"The Piano Teacher\\" by Elfriede Jelinek, the controversial Nobel Prize winner in literature that the film is based on and after reading it I saw the film again. Second time, all pieces of puzzle came to the right places. Not very often an outstanding harrowing book is transferred to the screen with such brilliancy as \\"Le Pianiste\\". Three actors gave outstanding performances. Franz Schubert's Piano music, \\"soaked in the morbid humanity\\", is another bright star of the movie.<br /><br />I only have one problem with Haneke's vision.  There is a scene in the film where Haneke made some changes to Erika's character comparing to the novel.  In the book, the furthest she went to reveal herself to Walter, the young student in the conservatory who became attracted to her was in a letter. As soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed to her how much he was repulsed by that, she had stopped communicating with him. Erika of the book would never chase Walter to throw herself to him. She kept everything inside - she did not like to act, she was not a chaser - she loved to watch. The big scene during the hockey game was not necessary. It tried to make Erika sympathetic (and of course, Huppert was heartbreaking) but it took the mystery that surrounded her - Jelinek did not write that scene, it sounded and looked false in otherwise excellent film.<br /><br />4.5/5 or 9/10

0156027321|5.0|The Life of Pi    Yann Martel, ISBN 0-15-602732-1. 319 p. Canada: Random House, 2001. $14.00.     Pi Patel is a quiet boy. He grew up being ridiculed and under the eye of a zoo keeping family. He focuses much on his religion, being a Hindu, Muslim, and Christian is hard to keep up with. His academic studies are important to him, but the zoo his family owns is a also a large part of who he is.     Yann Martel opens The Life of Pi, with much background information on the main character, Pi Patel. Much on of the beginning may seem pointless and like a lot of useless information, but as the story progresses, the large abundance of background information comfortably finds its place in the story.     Pi and his family soon find themselves on a boat to Canada: Their old home was not fit for a zoo any longer due to new governmental control. As their voyage is taking place, the boat Pi and his family are on, the \\"Tsim Tsum\\" sinks and leaves Pi a castaway in the massive Pacific Ocean. However, he is not alone in his new home. Pi is grouped with a hyena, a zebra with a broken leg, an orangutan, and much to his despair, a 450-pound Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker. Soon all of the castaways are disposed of by Richard Parker, except Pi. Pi, driven to do anything to stay alive, braves Richard Parker's territory and uncovers a locker that saves his life. In the locker Pi finds the necessary tools and items he uses to stay alive for the rest of his days on the lifeboat. After much deliberating with himself over how to deal with Richard Parker, he realizes he must tame Richard Parker to stay alive. Using his cunning and wits, Pi tames Richard Parker using only a whistle, the lifeboat, and the Pacific Ocean. Over time, Pi eventually loses hope and goes blind from malnutrition. He finally lays back and accepts his death. However, after some strange events, Pi finds himself on a mysterious island. Here he replenishes himself and the Tiger, and sets off in the lifeboat again. Pi eventually lands in Mexico, and to the end the book, is interviewed by the owners of the shipping company that owned the boat \\"Tsim Tsum.\\" Like the book, The Outsiders, the end of the book is where the story first starts, back with the author writing the story we had just read.     The Life Of Pi is a great book. The author writes in a very catchy manner, incorporating religion and philosophy into the book that makes the reader think hard about what is happening in the book. Yann Martel hypnotizes the reader and often throughout the book one might mistake the story they are reading for a true tale, but is ultimately brought back to reality with the knowledge they are just reading an amazingly well written, fictional book. Although the book has its deep, pensive depressing parts, humor finds its niche in the book as well. One might find themselves laughing at the lengths Pi goes to keep himself alive. The book seems written for an older audience; however, many teens are mature enough to grasp the story of tattered human being. Overall, The Life of Pi is an amazing book for anyone who wants to enjoy a well-written book.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|It is an eye-opening film. So much emphasis is placed on race in America, it is good to see a film about class within a group and it is very romantic. Very wonderful actors and actresses. I love this movie. This is highly recommended.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|I watched this twice.  This movie did not appeal to me while it was in theaters, but I decided to give it a whirl once it showed up at the video store!  This movie was great it brought such a barrage of various emotions to me. I loved the combination of story lines and their minute connections to one another.  This movie brought it all, fear, anger, sadness, desperation, happiness a conglomerate of emotions.  Highly recommended and highly entertaining.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|such fun to get this in a DVD...I remember getting it when it first came out in the 45's...now I will have it forever...also bought copies for all my grandchildren.
B000UGG3A0|4.0|More collective vocals and less varied instrumentation, seems like their best work (Blackout & Sing Loud...) are behind them. Warriors Code was good and this about up to that level, definitely needs a few more spins to grab you. however, DKM, Rancid & NOFX are still the holy triumvirate of American Punk/Rock N' Roll today. Even a fairly good release such as this, is 95% better than the crap they play on commercial radio.
B000J10EQU|5.0|Fabulous sequel!!! Overall, this movie is superbly well-crafted.  The acting is right-on (what a cast!!), and the special effects elevate Superman into the 21st century with style.  The story line is also very good for a comic book adaptation.  Lex Luther's scheme was a bit lame, but Kevin Spacey can pull off any script.   This movie is an instant classic, and belongs in everyone's 'family-movie' library.
B000062XFG|4.0|This season is great. It has some interesting ideas, and takes Star Trek to where it hasn't been before, i.e. into the Klingon vessel chain of command. This season contains a couple of episodes that are quite dark, and stir up the good old morals that we all felt watching the old series.    We also get introduced to the good doctor Polaski, who, though she is not Crusher, brings an edge and her own flavor to this particular season.
B0006HB84Y|5.0|Another terrific CD by Josh Groban.  What a talent.  Never seem to tire of this great voice.
B0007OCG56|1.0|I tried to enjoy this film but could not at all!  I honestly do not see why this movie got such high ratings, including the two thumbs up from Ebert and Roeper.    This movie made no sense to me.  It was mildly entertaining but in the end I saw no character growth whatsoever.  Everyone stayed the same.  Nothing was resolved, everyone was disappointed by conflict inflicted by themselves or others.  The quote at the end of the movie, \\"I am my mother's daughter.\\"  Cheesefest!    This movie had so much more potential than what was given.    Highly disappointed, Would not recommend to anyone.    If you like Adam Sandler films, and or quirky romance, try Punch Drunk Love, that was a great film in my opinion.

It doesn't have the same number of fantastic songs as Breakaway, but there were immediately 5 that I loved.  Can't wait to see her in concert next month!
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Wow! Vive la haute définition. Images à couper le souffle. Le seul hic est que nous avons droit qu'à seulement à quatre des 5 DVD offerts en standard... dommage!
B000R8YC18|5.0|I am not a fan of the DVD companies releasing SPECIAL EDITIONS of their movies. Usually they'll put a couple of little features on the NEW ULTIMATE VERSION of the movie but really its not worth buying the thing if you already own the old version. Such is NOT the case with the new edition of TAXI DRIVER. It blows the old version away. If you are a fan of the movie TAXI DRIVER and you already own it on DVD, I will tell you that's its worth spending the money again to upgrade to this version. Lots of extras that you will ACTUALLY ENJOY. Get it.
0385522401|3.0|Was a little hard to get into this book but was glad I stuck with it......good ending!
630522577X|5.0|Saw this on Broadway...the DVD is wonderful as was the VCR...but I wish they had let Julie Andrews play her original role...Andrew Hepburn was lovely but Julie's voice was fantastic,
0316166685|3.0|This is a book that had many bright points, but it was still a little rough around the edges.    What didn't work for me:  1- Sebold wanted to include a lot of back-information about her characters, but didn't know how to smoothly incorporate it into the story. A lot of it seemed random which brought the story to a hault in some places.  2- Sebold kept dropping hints about how the story was going to end up... to the point the reader is convinced that there is going to be this big reveal. SHE NEVER DID IT. I was so mad about the way she ended the book or, better yet, where she failed to take the story... I through the book down when I finished it. I felt cheated.    That said... I love that the narrator is dead. Very clever. I also enjoyed the insight on how family and friends cope after losing a loved one. I thought both of those elements were very real.    I would recommend this book, but caution that your biggest question/anticipation throughout the book never gets satisfied.
0385522401|5.0|One star or five? Well judging by these reviews what makes a good book is far from clear and highly subjective.    There are parallels here with Scott Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby\\" which received similarly mixed reviews on its release - some totally dismissed it for its \\"novelette\\" length and its superficial and incomplete story-line while others lauded it as a work of pure genius. In fact what Fitzgerald had done, which only a highly skilled writer can, was to take a complex love story and then cut everything back to its bare essentials, re-crafting every paragraph and sentence to the absolute minimum and, in doing so, leaving the reader to imply key elements of the plot and to ponder on how and why these things happen. The result, as time has shown, was a novel that precisely because of its superbly compact writing and pervading air of mystery was far more emotionally charged and thought provoking than novels of double or treble the length and, as a result, unforgettable and timeless.    And this is exactly what McEwan does here. Beneath \\"On Chesil Beach's\\" short and superficially simple narrative is a complex, multi-layered and deeply moving love story, executed in a similarly minimalist style that ultimately leaves the reader to reflect on the reasons for its outcome. Almost every page requires one or more repeat readings to appreciate how incredibly well written and constructed they are, while his ability to distil genuine tension, emotion & mystery into single sentences of superficially casual observation turns the whole book into something that's equally thought provoking and unforgettable.    Maybe McEwan is trying to emulate Fitzgerald's masterwork, maybe not, but the parallels are uncanny - not least in peoples' initial reaction to it - and, while not in the same highly rarefied class as \\"The Great Gatsby\\", my guess is that time will also show \\"On Chesil Beach\\" to be seen for what it is... which is?... a quite brilliant piece of writing.
0316067598|5.0|The greatest generation .... men like Marcus Luttrell. Fascinating book, highly recommended reading to all.
0743486285|4.0|I have to start this review by saying that I am now and have always been a huge Nikki Sixx fan, so read into that what you will.    The Herion Diaries was a vivid look into the mind of our hero at his lowest.  It takes you on the heartbreaking trip of this addicted soul at the height of his addiction and Nikki spares no detail.  You are with him through out each trip to the closet, each paranoid night in a hotel somewhere on the road, each bout with nausea until the final shoot out.      I remember clearly the reports of Nikki Sixx being dead from an OD.  It is the rock and roll story, isn't it?  But actually had no idea of how serious his condition was.  Herion Diaries cleared it all up for me. I now know how close we were to losing him.    It isn't pretty, it's rough, and glaringly real.  I cried almost everytime I opened the book, not because of his physical addictions or situations, but because of his mental issues -- his feeling of being lost, no family connections and not having anyone to cling to.  That was the heartwrenching part for me.  When he says he doesn't know what to do, and that he could just sit in the middle of the hotel room and cry, I am right there with him, crying.    As with all addiction stories, it is sad and depressing and it makes you glad that it is not you, but with Nikki's story, there is a happy ending.  Not right away, he falls off the wagon and backslides, but he gets back on and is finally victorious.  I applaude him for bearing his soul and his dirty laundry.  I hope that others can learn from his story and help themselves.    If you are looking for literary prose, keep looking.  If you are looking for humanity at it's worst...and best, stop in.  Nikki is has opened the doors so that you can take a look.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Peter Pan is delightful...I saw it with Mary martin when it was first produced and it just gets better - also got copies for all of my grandchildren.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|This is a great voice. We could end the review there. However, some people knock Maddy for sounding like Billie Holiday.Would you knock an up and coming basketball player because they play too much like Michael Jordan?Of course not. Ms.Peyroux does not do Billie material. She does not use a similar band. She is not a 'period' revivalist. Look at the wide swatch of material she covers on this cd. Note too, the use of Charles Giordano,master of all things with keys. (See the Springsteen \\"Live in Dublin\\" video) Musically, this is a voice that calms and refreshes like hot chocolate on a cold winters morn. Yum.
0060290110|5.0|A must-have for all Lewis fans.  The art work alone is worth the price of the book!  Perfect for any age but a great way to introduce younger children to the world of Narnia!
0374105235|4.0|What an interesting story. Having lived all over the world, it is very interesting how stories of civil strife always seem to include child soldiers whether Palestinian, Lebanese, Iranian, Liberian or Somalian.     I recommend this book for those interested in the world around them.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|We have the VCR and wanted the DVD for more background information - just lovely.
B00005JKG9|5.0|AIDA  Attention- The allstar lineup should catch you attention.  Intrest-  Are you intrested in the extrordiany performance by Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, and Alec Baldwin, I know you will be, Decision- Have you made your decision for this movie?!.  And Action.   One of the top 25 movies since 1980-Alec Baldwin himself.  He is definately right on that.
B00007BKVC|5.0|The movie keeps getting better for me each time I see it. My question is about Earl the tongue wagging truckdriver. I have seen a bumper sticker which reads \\"Earl's in the trunk\\". I have been told that it comes from The Dixie Chicks. When I check The Dixie Chicks I see the song \\"Goodbye Earl\\". So, which Earl came first the movie or the song, and are they supposed to be connected?    In real life I see way too many \\"Earls\\" - it was satisfying to see at least one get his just desserts.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|Unlike Discovery before it Human After All isn't a song that you can listen through without skipping more than a song or two. While it isn't a cd filled with singles there are a few songs that shine through such as Human After All, Robot Rock and Technologic. However there are a few Daft sounds that are used a bit too much throughout the cd and some of the loops are indeed too long. I hoped for a bit more out of these guys. A solid effort for most but a bit below par for Daft Punk.
0446528056|5.0|I love all of Sparks' books and have first editions of all of them..my only criticism is that they all end sadly.....
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I wasn't so keen on watching yet another Masterpiece Theatre adaptation. Am I ever glad though that I did! Some of the scenes were so mortifying. I really felt for Jane. Only drawback were her duck lips. They got quite annoying by the third hour. Good casting and good acting all around - what else is there to ask for?
B000EDWKXI|5.0|Hey? What do I know? I just have an opinion...a hunch...even when I review a movie I somehow have forgotten the whole point of why I review on Amazon; it's for fun and to better hone my skills as a writer.  Well..here goes.I thought that CASANOVA was the best film of 2004 for lots of reasons.It is a sharp,snappy piece of elegance couched in a rollicking good time of a farce,sumptuous in look,articulate in wit,edited so tightly that there is no fat to cut,the best Alexandre Desplats soundtrack ever (SYRIANA), and acting from Heath Ledger,Sienna Miller,Oliver Platt and Jeremy Irons that has the absolute correct comical timing.Directed by Lasse Halstrom and filmed on location in Venice (the year is 1753),I loved it on the big screen and the DVD is outstanding for the proper ratio to keep this film at the look it had in the theatre and for myriads of interesting extras.It is rated R, but only for sexual entendre (lots of it,naturally), but shows no skin nor has any objectional language.You cannot beat the price as it sells on Amazon under $2.00.  Hey, what do I know? This is just my silly, for fun, opinion!
B000059MEK|5.0|Daft Punk's best album to date for certain. The songs dance into your body affecting it without your knowledge. You don't realize what you are doing until passengers in a nearby car are giggling at your dancing. And after either blushing or shrugging you'll go back to tapping the steering wheel or nodding your head along with the beat. It is a truly infectious and danceable cd that is not to be missed.
B000056HE9|5.0|I have the VCR off this and wanted the DVD for more information - perfectally lovely.
B000E41MS6|5.0|What's to review? If you are even looking at this then you probably already know what you're getting into. This is the DVD set of the first series.<br />We in the US will be surprised to find many new scenes that were cut from SciFi's & BBCA's broadcasts. Each disc has neat stuff like interviews and behind the scenes stuff. It's the new Doctor, it's on DVD.<br /><br />You know, I do have one thing to complain about. The packaging is not terribly practical! One must remove the plastic sleeve and then unfold the box to remove the DVDs. If you are like me and constantly switching out discs, you'll go mad and wish for a much simpler design. It's really more of a collector's package. But that doesn't diminish the glory that is Doctor Who!
B000I0RNV6|5.0|If you have not seen this movie order it now. Watch immediately. Yes very   sentimental. The end is just brilliant.
B000000WCV|3.0|Who knows what the state of techno/electro/house fuse music would be in if it weren't for Daft Punks release of Homework. It certainly wouldn't be where it is now. If you wish to hear where much of it began this is your album. As far as other Daft Punk albums go I would rank this 3rd in listenability however it still has a song or two guaranteed to bring back memories.
B00000F14B|5.0|Delightful...saw the original on Broadway and this was almost as much fun as seeing it originally...we have watched it a number of times.Have it in the VCR and the CD as well.
B000URDEB0|5.0|Alright so Annette's brought a different feel to Nightwish's traditional sound with her vocals - yeah I admit I feel like just the vocals changed the music's overall aura - the bad thing was that it didn't exactly feel much like Nightwish anymore. But that's just the only thing I have against this new era in Nightwish's career - the feel is a bit more pop and they're starting to sound less-unique as they start to sound more like typical gothic female fronted bands like Epica. But the good thing is that this sound is solid for Nightwish - what DOES make them unique still is the musicianship - it's still Nightwish in that sense (take a good listen to the instrumental CD of this special edition CD - still very Nightwish). And another thing is that they still maintain an epic soul to their music with the full orchestra similar in vein to \\"Once.\\" \\"Dark Passion Play\\" is definitely something new to Nightwish, but you might want to give this a try. I found it quite - no - VERY enjoyable to listen to despite the not-so-Nightwish feel with the vocals, but it's still some solid epic metal. Nightwish is not over yet because of Tarja's departure but more like a different chapter has begin for the band - something new, different, yet quite solid in a good way.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|As I expected, Another overhyped Quenton Terantino drug trip.  What the heck. If I wanted to watch a B-quality picture, I would go get one (attack of the killer tomatos, Toxic avenger, Critters,vampirella etc).  I don't need any Artsy recreation.  I pay good money these days to watch a clear film, so why the heck do I want to watch a new symulated scratchy/poorly cut/edited film when their are plenty from the seventies and eighties available.  Second, the film was slow, boring, and just a bunch of Diareha of the mouth/constipation of the mind. As with his other films, to many words...reminds me of woody allen films, all talk and no action...or plot...boring.   Only one good scene, the death scene when he smashes the car.  Otherwise, just a long and drug out process to get to the action. Painful waste of money and time.  I guess I must not be \\"stoned\\" enough to appreciate this one.  To strait laced.  Good grief Hollywood, why the heck do you waste money producing this crud. No wonder my movie tickets are so expensive...the good movies have to recoop money lost on this junk.
155890641X|5.0|My mother kept an old clipping for years describing SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS when it opened at the huge and prestigious Radio City Music Hall in New York City and received a rave review from newspaper columnist Westbrook Pegler.<br /><br />He usually wrote about politics but on this occasion he took time to devote an entire review to Disney's new film. He called it a \\"masterpiece\\" and said that when the projectionist slipped those reels of film on the projector, the audience at the Music Hall witnessed one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.<br /><br />Coming from him, that was high praise indeed. And seeing the film now, restored for its video bow, we can appreciate his words. There are faults, to be sure, but basically it has to be admired for the innovative techniques it used in the art of animation. There are memorable sequences thanks to daring use of the multiplane camera: Snow White's flight through the woods, the Queen and her Magic Mirror, the Queen in the thunderous transformation scene as the camera seems to whirl around her, the Dwarfs in the mine and their march over the bridge as they sing \\"Heigh-Ho\\", the dwarfs chasing the witch in the thunderstorm. Even the rippling effects of the water in the wishing well scene.<br /><br />And, of course, there are the genuinely comic moments that made even the great Charlie Chaplin applaud in admiration. Dopey's antics are always a delight, as are Doc's and Grumpy's. All of the dwarfs are given inventive and funny things to do. The animation for the heroine herself is so gracefully done, particularly in the \\"Yodel Song\\" sequence where she dances with the dwarfs, that it's almost like watching a real \\"Snow White\\" go through the paces. That scene remains one of the most charming moments from the entire film with the dwarfs all displaying their own distinctive traits.<br /><br />The music is a standout: Someday My Prince Will Come, Heigh-Ho, I'm Wishing, The Yodel Song, etc. The young in heart will always love this classic. The art work is so rich in detail that the cottage scenes take on a life of their own, as do the images of the Wicked Queen at her castle.<br /><br />It belongs in the top tier of Disney's crown jewels, along with Pinocchio, Bambi, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.<br /><br />Summing up: an inspired work of art on every level that will remain a timeless classic.<br /><br />Note: This review is based on the VHS and theatrical version of the film.rk is so rich in detail that the cottage scenes take on a life of their own, as do the images of the Wicked Queen at her castle.

B00000J7SS|5.0|The first time I heard this \\"music\\" I have to admit, I was floored!  I didn't know what to make of it.  I was used to listening to the mellowness of \\"Kind of Blue\\". But having an open mind when it comes to music, I delved into the sound and found harmony among the primal beats.  The electric period of Miles is the only thing I listen to now primarily.   I love the this music, it is my favorite Miles Davis album!      When Miles put this album out which is essentially a jam session, he was embracing the future full on.  Very creative and eccentric, but that continues to embody the mystery of the man with the horn.
B0002EXH40|4.0|Megadeth's \\"Youthanasia\\" is a very small step down from \\"Countdown\\" - in a way it's much less thrash and more to conventional heavy metal - say it's Megadeth's \\"Black Album II\\" but I thought this was a good CD. There are more personal lyrics on this album, simple song structures (like in \\"Countdown\\"), fewer technical guitar solos, more melody, and not much of fast paced thrash metal tunes. A plus on this record I think is the sound of Dave Mustaine's vocals improving - it's a little less-whiny if you know what I mean. If you liked Countdown, you'll probably like this too.
1594489505|5.0|There, I said it. Possible literary heresy, but I'm gonna stand by it, and hopefully it won't generate ~too~ much Amazon controversy. The beginning of this book reminded me of Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, the middle evoked Great Expectations, and the end pays tribute to A Tale of Two Cities. Hosseini has talent. He creates characters of flesh and blood and maps out their arcs in ways that are suprising, thought-provoking and completely believable. As Laila and Mariam's lives are woven together, there are moments of brutal heartbreak and also ones of tremendous hope. It takes a skilled writer to balance the two without manipulating the reader. Khaled Hosseini is one more great book away from becoming my favorite contemporary writer.    There are plenty of books out there to tell a good tale. But it is a rarity for the book to actually have something to say. Rarer still is a book that educates. A Thousand Splendid Suns is an eye-opening introductory course in Afghanistan's turbulent history. That it does so with such heart, conviction and even, dare I say it, morals, is not just worthy of applauding, it's downright astonishing. This work reveals the greater truths of life. There is great pain within. The abuse and violence are not for the faint of heart. But it is real. The characters are heroic in their suffering and sacrifice. The author quotes poetry and the Koran with the same reverence as refuges of healing amid strife. \\"Surely he is the Mighty, the great Forgiver.\\" I loved this book.    Finally, I wanted to record here my favorite passage from the book. I will never forget the moment in the book, but Hosseini states it so beautifully, I wanted the passage verbatim. (So please stop reading here if you haven't read the book yet, because it reveals a major plot point)  \\"..she could not accept what the Mujahideen readily had: that sometimes in war innocent life had to be taken. Her war was against Rasheed. The baby was blameless. And there had been enough killing already. Laila had seen enough killing of innocents caught in the cross fire of enemies.\\"
B000LPS47U|5.0|I've loved this movie ever since watching it as an early teen (thanks dad!)<br /><br />Jeffrey Combs is startling as Herbert West. This film manages to be scary, disturbing and funny at the same time.<br /><br />The last 20 minutes have to be seen to be believed, the \\"giving head\\" scene is notorious - and for good reason.<br /><br />Good to see this one remastered in all it's glory, as soon as I heard the brilliant theme music it brought me back to happy times.<br /><br />Thanks Mr Gordon, long may you continue to bring H.P.Lovecraft to us movie watchers.<br /><br />Thanks for reading, enjoy.
B0000AYJXR|5.0|I'm a college student at Oswego State University, but recently I've been looking up products that remind me of my childhood, because lets be honest we all want to relive our wonder years. So I came across Space Jam, and i thought back to how much I loved this movie as a kid, I knew the movie by heart, every line. I remember trying to emulate Mike, every kid was in shock and awe when he dunked it from the half court line while the MonStars held him down. This movie is a classic, and enjoyable for all ages, and it comes with special features that were nonexistent when VHS' were poppin'. It's a nice addition to your DVD collection.
B00005V0X5|4.0|Well I've never heard the original version of \\"Killing...\\" but I can hear from this that the production was a bit raw and underproduced, but that did not take away the song quality. Megadeth's debut album was somewhat similar to Metallica's \\"Kill 'Em All\\" however Megadeth out-sped Metallica with this one - the songs are much faster at wrist snapping speed, and guitar solos are more chaotic. It isn't quite full of more quality written songs as they'd evolve to with \\"Peace Sells\\" but the songs are still good on this record. I would have to point out that speed is definitely emphasized in most of the record and the song structures are quite more simpler and the guitar solos are more wild and chaotic rather than technical. But hey, it was a solid start to Megadeth's career, might wanna get this if you're a fan of thrash and 'Deth.
B000002U9L|5.0|Few movies have touched me over the years the way Labyrinth has, and the music has been even more endearing. The eerieness of \\"As The World Falls Down\\", \\"Within You\\", and \\"Hallucination\\" are forever embedded in my memory for better or worse, but my favorite song from the entire soundtrack is \\"Chilly Down\\" a straight-up piece of hard funk in which David Bowie spits out some very black-sounding dialogue.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|I sat for 3 hours watching this thing and afterwards wondered \\"what was that?\\"<br /><br />Lynch is a genious, unparalled in hollywood. He really went off on his own tangent here and pretty much filmed a 3 hour long nightmare.<br /><br />The scene where Laura looked at the camera and slowly approached it was one of the scariest damn things I've ever seen.<br /><br />No sense going into the story here, it makes little sense whilst watching it buy it was sensational and challenging viewing, all in all a total brilliant film and I'll be glad to have it in my DVD collection with the other Lynch favourites.<br /><br />Can't wait for his next one!
B00003CXPD|5.0|I went to see Billy Elliot - The Musical while in London recently after hearing great things about it.  The stage show was magnificent and I then felt I needed to see the film.  The movie was just as good and very moving.  I will watch it many times as the acting was just superb.  Can't believe that Jamie Bell was not Oscar nominated for this role.  What an injustice.
159562015X|3.0|It was an interesting exercise but not altogether aligned with my strengths. However, the book is inexpensive and short enough for you to read each of the themes (strengths), highlight your strengths within each theme, and reread each theme a few times. By doing this you'll be able to determine which are your primary themes.
B000002WAD|5.0|A smooth pop-soul singer with a deep baritone voice uncommon for a (then)-21 year old white guy from England, Rick Astley burst upon the music scene like fire in the winter of 1987 with the huge hits \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" and \\"Together Forever.\\" Both of these are prime examples of the sweet, catchy pop that is the trademark of the Stock-Aitken-Waterman team, along the only slightly less sizable hit \\"It Would Take A Strong Strong Man\\". As I mentioned in one of my previous reviews, S-A-W certainly know how to create a hit, but the song is twice as good when you have somebody like Rick Astley to sing it.
B000EDWL82|5.0|I was introduced to \\"the editors\\" by a friend and once I got hold of this album couldn't stop listening.<br /><br />Was lucky enough to see them live, awesome.<br /><br />If you love interpol and, to a lesser extent, Joy Division, you'll love these guys.<br /><br />Great album, one of the best of the last 10 years for sure.
B000002JSJ|5.0|Replacing my vhs tape library dating back to the early 1970s with CDs.  Had forgot just how good this album is!
0783219695|5.0|Excellent movie.  Excellent acting.  Excellent view into history. Now that we are moving toward a moon colony and a trip to Mars, it's time to remember the heros who got us here.
1405204265|5.0|This book is based around the idea that A. A. Milne's stories of Winnie-The-Pooh can be used to illustrate the basic notions of Taoism.  Hoff is not by any means arguing that Milne was a Taoist.  He is merely saying that Milne's inner attitude to life, as revealed by the stories, intuitively follow along the same path as Taoism.  Owl is wise, Rabbit is cleaver and Eeore is smugly superior but the real hero of the books is Pooh, the apparently stupid yet strangely successful and able bear.<br /><br />The book covers the Taoist principles of:<br /><br />Tao, or the  indescribable Way of the universe,<br />P'u, or natural simplicity, the Uncarved Block,<br />Inner Nature, being those things that make us exactly who we are,<br />Wu Wei, or proceeding without doing, causing, or making,<br />Tzu Jan, or 'self so', meaning that things happen by themselves, spontaneously,<br />Tz'u, or caring and compassion, and,<br />T'ai Hsu, or the Great Nothing.<br /><br />Along the way we learn the pitfalls of being too busy and the benefits of doing nothing (for example meditation and contemplation).  Having read this I now try to arrange my day so that I can spend half an hour a day in my garden with my cat just doing nothing but observing nature and thinking the thoughts that come to mind.  I recommend it to everyone.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I have this idea in my head about how great Supernatural is because I love the show so much. The problem is, I tend to forget from on season to the next whether the preceeding season was actually any good. Fortunately, in the case of Supernatural, it's better than I remember. And the gag reel at the end of disc six is hysterical!!! If you are a fan of the show, it's worth buying it on DVD. And even if you're not, buy it anyway, you may be pleasantly surprised to find yourself looking forward to 9 o'clock on Thursday nights.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|My Family and I went to see Ratatouille the weekend it was released; and let's say, we weren't even close to dissapointed. My family has always loved the Disney movies, including Pixar's, and I knew, this was one of those excellent Disney movies. The meaning of this movie is excellent for kids, teaching them to never give up on their hopes and dreams, even if they believe they can't do something. It's also a funny and entertaining comedy. I think this was Pixar's best movie yet (including Cars and Toy Story). Disney and pixar do so well in creating an entertaining story and plot, while teaching good lessons. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to have a movie night with their family.
B000VI04HK|3.0|THE DVD IS HORRIBLE. NEVER STAYS ON ANYTHING FOR MORE THAN A FEW SECONDS. IN AND OUT SWIRLING AROUND FLASHING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER. I JUST WANTED TO WATCH THE BAND PLAY. ITS LIKE ONE LONG VIDEO. TURN OFF THE TV AND GET THE GREAT MUSIC THEY MAKE WITHOUT ALL THE DISTRACTIONS.
B000ASDFEU|2.0|Take a terrific cast, add great cinematography, add realistic battle scenes and what do we have?-A chorus of boos and jeers.  Connery seems to be the only personna that the viewer can latch onto, and none too well at that. Redford does a decent sequence, then disappears. Olivier seems totally miscast,and his lumberings down a dirt road under a full sun as a finale typifies the entire movie.It lumbers for 3 solid hours with the Allies and Germans giving \\"matchstick man\\" perfomances (to borrow a line from the Rock group \\"Status Quo\\").Annoying scene changes disrupt any flow that the film might have. Also, am I the only movie-goer who found the dialogue too faint and the music too loud? Anyway, the \\"good guys\\" won while the Germans and the audience finally lost.
0060922583|4.0|Talbot died quite young, but was nevertheless able to churn out several excellent books about the connections between eastern mysticism (and several other esoteric subjects) and quantum mechanics. Very eye opening and well written. The title is somewhat misleading however, since Talbot is not literally proposing that the universe is holographic in a Star Trek sense.
B000M341QE|4.0|Outstanding movie,full of violence and blue laguage,seemingly in context with the subject matter.Damon fine as informant, DiCaprio even better as police infiltrator of mob gang, and Wahlberg won best supporting actor as obscenitities laden police inspector who understands it all,and is suspended for his efforts. But Nicholson really steals the show as mafia leader who seems born for the role.Multiple viewings are likely,but by whom?

B00005S6K8|5.0|My wife loves this movie and I can see why.  It's funny and romantic and has some great acting.  A chick flick?  Sure, but manly men like it, too!  Pop some popcorn, pour a glass of wine and enjoy it together.  Gotta love Sabrina!
B000UFAURI|4.0|This is a very satisfying effort by the Foo Fighters, a much-anticipated return to what they do best. It is a maturing of the path they have always traveled, and I have recommended it to my friends.   Great job, guys!
B000HIVQK8|5.0|This is a killer album - possibly my second favorite Harrison release, though that's a toss-up with [[ASIN:B00006LSM3 Brainwashed]].  For whatever reason, \\"Material World\\" gets forgotten - probably mainly because it followed up the epic [[ASIN:B00005UKE0 All Things Must Pass [DIGI-PAK EDITION]]] and how could it possibly have lived up to those expectations?    Well, maybe back in the early '70s, but all these decades later I think it's only fair to judge the album on it's own terms.  The lyrics do get a little heavy on the religion - which may or may not be an issue for you.  \\"The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)\\" is every single bit as heavy-handed as the title would suggest - but the music is great, so it doesn't especially bother me.  George did all his own lead guitar playing on this album, as opposed to his last, and he is far and away in a different league than during his Beatle years (he was just beginning to reach his mature style in '69).  Even more striking than the guitar playing is the passion singing George musters on \\"The Day the World Gets Round\\" - though obviously never possessing the range and power of Lennon or McCartney, on this track he is every bit their equal for expressiveness.      This isn't really a rock album - most of it is down-tempo and rather mellow.  But not without exception:  the title track chugs along at a good clip (the Indian-music-themed bridge, \\"In the spiritual sky...\\" is drop-dead gorgeous) and \\"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\\" is one of the most commercial-sounding pop records George ever did.  Speaking of pop singles, \\"Give Me Love\\" was a deserved number one hit single.  Oh, and \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" cuts a surprisingly deep groove - GREAT slide playing from George on that one.    The only clunker for me is \\"Try Some, Buy Some\\" which I understand was originally recorded by Ronnie Spector and George re-used the same backing track.  Something like that.  I don't care about the backstory all that much, however, because it just isn't all that good a song.      Here's where things get a little complicated: whether to go for this deluxe boxed version or the single disc version.  For the vast majority of people, I'd say hte single disc will more than suffice.  Both of them have the same two bonus tracks - each previously released as b-sides, but making their CD debut.  \\"Deep Blue\\" is is a good bluesy track, I believe it was an expression of grief following the passing of George's mother.  The A-side was \\"Bangla Desh,\\" so far only available on [[ASIN:B000002UCN The Best of George Harrison]].  I was disappointed at it's exclusion, but I guess there must be other plans for it.  The other B-side is \\"Miss O'Dell\\" which is a fantastic George song, perversely marred by hysterical laughter from none other than George himself.  It's funny to hear initially, until A) you realize how good the song is and B) you watch the DVD.    The DVD is frustrating because it should be the main attraction; the most compelling reason to shell out beaucoup bucks for this deluxe version.  The DVD is too short, but the problems go beyond even that.  First up is a Live In Japan performance of \\"Give Me Love\\" - fine, that makes sense and it's nice to see (though the complete concert will hopefully be released someday, at which point this one song will be redundant).  There are two bonus tracks on the DVD that play over slide-show images.  These should have been bonus tracks on the CD, if you ask me.  What I was getting at about \\"Miss O'Dell\\" earlier is that the song appears on the DVD as well, in an alternate take with no laughing!  I really truly wish this version had also been featured on the CD.  The second song is a demo of \\"Sue Me Sue You Blues\\" which is quite extraordinary - just George singing over his acoustic slide guitar playing - and is sounds like something off an old Mississippi Delta blues recording from the '20s!  Okay, okay - I'm not a blues expert (I wish), so Mississippi Delta might not be the correct comparison.  But my point is, this sounds a lot like an old vintage blues recording - and NOTHING like any George playing I've ever heard.  It's awesome, and I really wish it had been on the CD (and I really, REALLY wish I could hear the rest of George's demos for this album!).  Outside of that, there is a very unusual 'music video' of the album's title track that shows footage of the vinyl record albums being pressed and packaged.      So get this album if you like George Harrison and/or the Beatles, but be forewarned: this version is a bit too expensive considering what the extras are.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|A truly great movie and great story.  The realism is a bit overwhelming at times but there is no other way to accurately depict that time in our history.  The strength of the story (to me) lies in the fact that it illustrates all the ambiguities of the Civil War, particularly the home guard units and vigilante organizations that were so prevalent in the South.  This war was a great hardship to the ordinary yeoman farmer who was not a large land owner and slave holder.  The movie also pointed out that support for the war in the mountainous areas of the South was weak at best.  People in those regions served more because of State loyalty than any passionate issues or independence.  This is an extraordinary movie by every measurement.  The casting was very good--and performances are outstanding.
B000001OAA|5.0|NOTES: Garbage is my favorite band.<br />1=bad, 2=average, 3=good, 4=great<br /><br />Supervixen: I'm totally content with what's written as performed by Shirley (who sings like a goddess here; so regal and confident that when she commands me to \\"bow down\\", I'm happy to oblige), but the true appeal of \\"Supervixen\\" is its all-encompassing, mammoth-sized din that cleverly conjures a hypnotic fever pitch (especially during the self-aggrandizing chorus). It's blaring, subversive mind control with a come-hither wink.<br />4 / 4<br /><br />In Queer, Shirley personifies a praying mantis and her provocative, alien whispering muddles the reality that you'd better watch yourself after the deed is done. Decrying her newfound date/mate for having nothing worthwhile (after tearing him apart upon closer inspection), she's grossly disappointed and it shows. Our lady may be all class but it's easy to imagine the entire affair taking place in a seedy motel room. And scarily, I don't think this is the first time it's happened.<br />4 / 4<br /><br />Only Happy When It Rains is a biting, sardonic tune that's emblematic of the period it was released in and Garbage on the whole. What I like most about it is the black humor: \\"I only smile in the dark\\" (and there's no doubt it's a Cheshire grin). Depending on your perspective, this is either a derision disguised as a parody of pessimists, or a glorious tribute to them. I spent two years \\"riding high upon a deep depression\\" but can't settle on a verdict.<br />4 / 4<br /><br />As Heaven Is Wide: Although the woman-scorned card is one that gets used all too often,  this time it's played with such raw, ferocious, teeth-bared effect that I have no choice but to defer to it my complete, trembling attention. The band is at the top of its game with this apocalyptic number, using religious imagery to describe the sheer magnitude of betrayal that has transpired. Shirley lambastes her ex for excoriating her (\\"If flesh could crawl/my skin would fall/from off my bones and run away from here\\") and it's f***ing awesome.<br />4 / 4<br /><br />Not My Idea is the actualization of promised revenge as evidenced by one of the most surprising avowals the group has ever written: \\"Now I'm here burning down your house\\". On subsequent listens, it's clear that the entire song is preparing us for that remark. Initially it all feels merely peevish compared with \\"As Heaven Is Wide\\". But it's impossible not to cheer Shirley on when she ignites the lighter fluid after a few iterations of the stirring, staccato chorus.<br />3 / 4<br /><br />A Stroke Of Luck: At this point in the progression of things Shirley is understandably cynical about another relationship and considers her latest to be doomed from the start (\\"Here comes the cold again/I feel it closing in\\" she laments). Her life is smeared with the colors of a sickly sunset and there's no way to wipe the canvas clean. The frosty gale blowing throughout is a reminder that history repeats itself. Note the neat reversal of the chorus during its second repetition.<br />4 / 4<br /><br />Vow: Only our favorite lead vocalist (in the whole damn world!) can describe herself as \\"like Joan of Arc coming back for more\\" and \\"like Jesus Christ coming back from the dead\\" and not elicit laughter. Shirley returns to vengeance mode with the strength (and auditory similitude) of a tornado and has apparently ditched her pyromaniacal urges for something a little more homicidal. And we clamor for more! \\"Vow\\" was a good first single because it set the standard for this disc and the next.<br />3 / 4<br /><br />I've always thought Stupid Girl never really deserved most of its accolades. It doesn't matter if the drums were sampled from the Clash as the sound design is not up to par with anything else on this recording. And vocally gutting a \\"stupid girl\\" for being fake and manipulative is been-there-done-that territory. If Shirley's referring to herself, she makes the lyrics moderately more intriguing but not enough to compensate for shallow indictments like, \\"Don't believe in love/don't believe in hate/don't believe in anything/that you can't waste\\".<br />2 / 4<br /><br />Dog New Tricks: Crunchy, adroit guitars seething beneath the surface help drive home awful truths such as, \\"Everyone lies/everyone cheats\\" and \\"Everyone I know has gone away/died or left or just forgot to stay\\". An intellectually gratifying testament to those mistakes we all make in life and don't want to acknowledge. The relationships we screw up. The ideas we have trouble articulating. It's hard learning how to change and \\"Dog New Tricks\\" has no easy answers.<br />3 / 4<br /><br />My Lover's Box: After a brief retrospection, Shirley doesn't exactly repent but asks for a path to salvation anyway. With her charismatic and sympathetic yearning to ascend higher despite her shortcomings, she becomes our fallen angel. If there's hope for someone in her predicament then is there hope for the rest of us? At the end the music intensifies, escalates, and maybe she's being lifted up to heaven after all. Garbage peaks with this majestic elegy and subsides in its two concluding tracks.<br />4 / 4<br /><br />If \\"My Lover's Box\\" was the climactic foretelling of Shirley's death, then Fix Me Now is her funeral dirge. She asks to be resurrected but eventually relents (\\"I'll go without a fight\\"). It's a pensive piece in which the background wailing deflates slowly so that by the time it's over the poor woman can be laid to rest among the clouds. The whole eulogy's a fanciful daydream of course (\\"Things don't have to be this way/catch me on a better day\\"), but it's haunting nevertheless.<br />3 / 4<br /><br />A postlude with one bizarre lyric (\\"I am red hot kitchen\\") and an explanation for everything that came before (\\"I am lost/so I am cruel\\"), Milk began the Garbage tradition of picking an adagio lullaby as the farewell to each album. It's a lovely way to close out the proceedings, projecting us into a starry realm where all the songs are on an infinite loop. This one reveals Shirley to be an ultimately lonely siren, willing to try for love once again. And we honestly hope that somehow, this time, it turns out well for her.<br />3 / 4<br /><br />Best: As Heaven Is Wide<br />Worst: Stupid Girllieve in hate/don't believe in anything/that you can't waste\\".   2 / 4    Dog New Tricks: Crunchy, adroit guitars seething beneath the surface help drive home awful truths such as, \\"Everyone lies/everyone cheats\\" and \\"Everyone I know has gone away/died or left or just forgot to stay\\".

0684857219|5.0|I had bought this book for my 18 year old son that is very health concious and is into weight lifting. From the time I got it, he read it in every night and has shown me a lot of information in it as well. My son's friend saw it and started reading on it every time he was over and he stated \\"This is my new favorite book\\". So I ended up buying another one for him for his birthday! They both are always looking things up in it and taking it when they go to work out. Two thumbs up!
B000R9J3XE|5.0|Garbage is my favorite band. Shirley Manson is the only celebrity I want to meet before I die. I can't express how highly I revere this group.<br /><br />Absolute Garbage (2007) is a fitting \\"greatest hits\\" collection. It does NOT include every single the band ever released, only the most popular ones. And although we can all gripe about its omissions, the fact remains that what we're left with is a fine, comprehensive-enough album that presents an exciting retrospective of Garbage at their rise, peak, and fall (in surprisingly chronological fashion).<br /><br />The first 5 songs are from their eponymous debut (1995) and of them, \\"Queer\\" and \\"Only Happy When It Rains\\" are the truly great cuts. \\"Vow\\" and \\"Milk\\" are good while \\"Stupid Girl\\" remains average and the weakest pick from their first CD (although it was a huge hit).<br /><br />Tracks 7 - 11 hail from Version 2.0 (1998) and I would call all of them terrific, except \\"When I Grow Up\\", which is good but not great. \\"Push It\\", in particular, is almost the best song Garbage ever produced (my personal favorite would have to be \\"So Like A Rose\\" from beautifulgarbage).<br /><br />\\"Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!)\\" and \\"Shut Your Mouth\\", both from the third album beautifulgarbage (2001), are two of the best selections from that release, which was filled with dizzying highs and terrifying lows.<br /><br />Although \\"Why Do You Love Me\\" was the first (and best) single from Bleed Like Me (2005), that album's title track was one of the worst songs Garbage has ever made (though admittedly \\"Bleed Like Me\\" is a love it/hate it affair). The remix of \\"It's All Over But The Crying\\", a middling ballad that almost became a single, is a little more downbeat and snappier but mostly it's not much of a deviation from the original.<br /><br />Fortunately there are three other tracks (all of them great) scattered throughout that deserve special attention:<br /><br />#1 Crush is so brilliantly twisted that you can either issue a restraining order or take it as a darkly comedic retelling of Romeo + Juliet (the soundtrack this came from). Underneath a canopy of pulsating drums, Shirley drones on with creepy pledges like, \\"I will lie for you/beg and steal for you/I will crawl on hands and knees until you see/you're just like me\\". \\"#1 Crush\\" is the kind of obsessively lovelorn stalker who rummages through your trash and keeps a blow-up doll with the same color hair as yours in their closet.<br /><br />\\"When we first got together, we all said that we wanted to make a James Bond Theme, because that's how we come up with our songs.\\" - Garbage, The World Is Not Enough Ultimate Edition DVD<br /><br />The World Is Not Enough represents Garbage at their swankiest, naturally evolving from the brisk, posh sonance of Version 2.0 to a Bond theme that melds `90s techno fiendishness with `60s orchestral flourish. It's a riveting achievement, showcasing melodramatic radiance (\\"There's no point in living if you can't feel alive\\") and insatiable craving (\\"If we can't have it all then nobody will\\"). Shirley's expansive delivery is pitch-perfect and she's arguably never sounded stronger. Too bad it was attached to one of the worst Bond movies.<br /><br />If Tell Me Where It Hurts is Garbage's fond goodbye, then I couldn't think of anything more appropriate. Shirley finally finds the right man (\\"To hell with everybody else/all I care about is you/and that's the truth/they don't like me yeah I can tell/but you do\\") and we applaud her wholeheartedly. Steve, Duke and Butch paint the sumptuous music with shades of nostalgia in a sincere salute to their fans. \\"Tell Me Where It Hurts\\" catches our gorgeous firecracker reflecting (\\"I've been loved but I didn't know how to feel it/and I've been adored but I don't know if I ever believed it\\") and its exquisite lyrics culminate with a grateful payoff that was worth the wait (\\"I've been loved my whole life but I didn't know how to take it/until you\\").<br /><br />This is a magnificent offering that can be enjoyed by hardcore fans and newcomers alike. If you've barely (or never) heard of Garbage or, like me, have bought BOTH versions of Absolute Garbage just to complete your collection, there's no reason not to check out this disc. In a word, it's amazing.<br /><br />(P.S. Check out my reviews of Garbage's other four albums for a song-by-song dissection.)never) heard of Garbage or, like me, have bought BOTH versions of Absolute Garbage just to complete your collection, there's no reason not to check out this disc.

1932100660|5.0|This book is very informative. Every American needs to pick this book up and read it. Read the Introduction that Amazon shows before you buy and you'll agree that it's a must read. America is the richest and yet one of the most poorly nourished nations in the world. The only way to change that is to pass on the data and information like in this book.
0061122416|5.0|This book was great, it kept me interested from beginning to end!  Very insperational and exciting!
0143057375|5.0|I read Tolle's book, The Power of Now, shortly after it came out in print and since then have read many of his other books.  He is a master teacher of how to live in the moment.  A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose is his  masterpiece. Some may find it repetitious, but it's in the repetition that we finally learn what we need to know.  If you are anxious, fearful or angry, this book may help you to let go of the past, not project the future, and be present in each moment, because the \\"present\\" is really all we have. I expect that Tolle's philosophy will be life-altering for some. It re-opened my mind to what I had once known and had forgotten. Take time to read/listen to this book as you will need to reflect upon what you heard/read.
B000JKA0B0|5.0|Got it for a sweet price when amazon first listed it.  This is a great live package, and the book is a nice plus.
0385333846|4.0|Wow - little nervous about the flaming I might receive for giving this less than the full 5 stars.  It's a good book, and is a 'compelling work of art,' but we're not talking Crime and Punishment here. The art of the book, I guess, is that Vonnegut created a fun to read (albeit bizarre) fatalistic world that somehow, in the midst of the sci-fi and light humor, portrays the horror of Dresden (but not with the force of a traditional straightforward delivery, in my view).  If read aloud, one senses that a dull monotone is appropriate.  The world of this book is fatalistic, ironic, and ultimately without point.  Like 'Groundhog Day,' reality is on an endless loop, and Billy Pilgrim glides in and out of the planes of time without control or pain.  I have to admit that I didn't really get all of the nonsense about aliens and time travel and all that, but I did see that Pilgrim is portrayed as (I think) the only human in the world who really understood what was going on, and everyone else was a tragic actor in a stupid and violent play.  For me, I could not get over-the-top gaga about the book - there is too much absurdity for that to happen.  And while it is not an endorsement of war, certainly, its message of anti-war is lost a bit in the clutter.  Give Vonnegut some leeway; he was probably stoned out of his mind while he wrote this.  Anyway, KV had a nice conversational style and this is an enjoyable book.  4 Stars.
B000VI04HK|5.0|Spectacular, classy, thoughtful as always. They are so amazing live. Certainly a must have for REM fans and any intelligent music lover. This set just confirms that I am so blessed to have had REM's music to help define my adult years.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I think because I really heard this one first, it highlighted for me how different this is from \\"Parachutes\\" or \\"Rush.\\"  I tend to like more crafted pop music, and, listening to those two cds (on a streaming service), I was disappointed at most songs which tended to have a first part with a very simple melody and a second falsetto chorus.  You know what I mean: \\"Yellow\\" or \\"Clocks.\\"  X&Y does it for me because these sprawling, ambient songs seem so much more sophisticated than the earlier stuff.  I genuinely don't guess where the melody is going.  If it suffers from anything, it's a tendency toward New Age platitudes and excessive sentimentality, almost a therapeutic  or Oprah-like tone on \\"Fix You.\\"  But I can forgive that for beautiful, sprawling compositions like \\"White Shadows\\" (my favorite) or \\"Speed of Sound\\" or the title track.  And THAT'S why I think this is the best Coldplay cd.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|This is by far the best metal cd I have ever purchased. It by far the most sensational, exhilarating, full of emotion and in your face CD that I have ever found. Metal was once lost but now is back with FIVE FINGER DEATH PUNCH!! Not only are they the most talented individuals, but they have a heart of gold! They absolutely love their fans and recognizes each of them. THEY REALLY DO CARE!! I have never seen any band that cares as much as these guys do!! Their performance on stage is nonstop shredding both musically and vocally!! IF YOU LOVE METAL, then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD!!     -Kathys
B00000J7J4|1.0|Pull out/borrow/buy a copy of Santana`s 1972 masterpiece \\"Caravanserai\\", pay close attention to the track titled \\"Song Of The Wind\\", and then compare it with the absolute DRECK on this 'popsy'-nonsense, and then ask yourself whether this is even the same guitarist. I recommend the old stuff-- before Carlos felt the need to become a mainstream pop star, for some reason.
1582701709|1.0|I'm appalled at how many people rate this author credible. She is, on the contrary, a detriment to her readers, a revolting megalomaniac, and dangerous to society, particularly the ever-malleable youth to say the least.        For those rave reviewers that \\"cannot find the words\\" to describe The Secret, here's a few to get you started: ad nauseam, trite, drivel, pseudo-science, b.s., delusion, wishful thinking, lazy, oversimplified, feeble-minded, occult magic, hogwash, shallow, materialism, greed, arrogant, boor, psychobabble, and pure bunk.       What's next Ms. Byrne, you and your cronies fabricate stellar reviews?  Most of them in my opinion are suspect and in no way elaborate to the books effectiveness.  Moreover, you owe my good friend an explanation (and an apology for deceiving her) as to why her positive thinking hasn't manifested into bringing her husband home from Iraq. Maybe her thoughts are why we are at war in the first place?  A lobotomy is a prerequisite for your book.    More harm than good.  If you buy into this, the earth is flat.
B00005A9ZC|2.0|I've never understood the appeal of Daft Punk.  \\"Around the World\\" is probably the only track by them that I like.  Everyone raved about this album the week it was released and the catchy, \\"One More Time\\" hit the airways chronically.  Of course I bought it that week also, and probably thought a little (but not by much) more strongly about it at the time.  Listening to this album today on the other hand, truly unmasks how aweful it really is.  Daft Punk may know how to create a few tracks that will make it into the pop top 40, but these guys have very little talent when it comes to quality electronica.    2/5 stars.

B000059TCE|3.0|In recent decades a new technology was made. A technology to make animals talk. No, animals did not REALLY talk. Movie producers used computers to make their mouths move to  make it SEEM like they were talking.  Then, like cartoons, the actors would be the \\"voice\\" of the animal.    What a fascinating technology!  It was done in the movie \\"Babe\\". Babe the pig talked beautifully. It was done on \\"Incredible Journey\\". The technology made \\"Dr. Doolittle\\" with Eddie Murphy look so fine!     Now we have the remake of 101 Dalmatians, a cartoon where the dogs were the stars of the movie. They all talked and all had wonderful unique characters all their own.    .....So why the heck didn't Disney use the same technology in this movie as they used in all the others? Why did NOT want to make those dogs talk?    Not only does this make the movie less interesting to watch but it mutilate the integrity of the movie as well. The dogs themselves were supposed to be the stars of the movie, not the humans. The animals THEMSELVES were supposed to rescue the puppies, not Scotland Yard.     Talk about taking the ice cream out of the ice cream cone!    Well, there IS one bright spot to the movie. Glenn Close DID do an excellent job as  Cruella Di Vil. Although if the dogs only talked her character would have been even more funny she still stood out. She is the reason to see the movie.    ... and it's nice to see Hugh Laurie again on the big screen.

1582701709|3.0|I like to read self help books like Tony Robbins, Napoleon Hill,Norman Vincent Peale,etc..  The Secret, the book is inspiring yet I felt there were some conflicting ideas in different chapters.  I would have also liked to see the references sited.  There are some big statements made about events happening.  I would like to know where they got each instance of historical info. or state it is speculation or theory.  I also enjoyed the DVD which the book refers to several times.  There as well, a bibliography would help.
B000002G7E|5.0|Something that needs to be be remembered about The Velvet Underground is their willingness to make each of their studio albums different from its predecessor.  When you hear The Velvet Underground & Nico, you hear different sounds and genres.  Examples are the following: Pop-flavored sounds like in \\"Sunday Morning\\", Moderate sound, (neither too loud nor too soft) like in \\"I'm Waiting for the Man\\" and \\"There She Goes Again\\", Slow moving ballads like, \\"Femme Fetale\\" and \\"I'll Be Your Mirror\\", and finally, songs of intensity and dread, like \\"Venus in Furs\\", \\"Heroin\\", \\"All Tomorrow's Parties\\", and \\"European Son\\".  With the album, White Light/White Heat, you get extreme loudness and intensity throughout just about all of the songs.  In the title track, \\"White Light/White Heat\\", you hear a moderately loud tone and tempo, then towards the end, both the tone and tempo get much louder and faster.  I'm not so sure what the subject matter of the song is.  My guess is that it's about sex and drugs.  But you the listener should make your own interpretation of it.  In \\"The Gift\\", the band plays approximately at a walking tempo, and John Cale narrates a story about not so wonderful love relationship.  A man named Waldo Jeffers decides to put himself in a postal package and mail himself to his ex-girlfriend, Marsha Bronson.  Ironically, her best friend Sheila Klein takes a knife, plunges it straight into the package, and winds up having Waldo meet his demise.  In \\"Lady Godvia's Operation\\", Lou Reed depcicts a woman named Godvia who is in tears beacuse she has to undergo surgery.  Once the doctor starts to operate, he realizes, he did not give her enough anesthesia, because she wakes up yelling after having his scalpel inserted into her.  Towards the end of the song, you hear strange sound effects.  My interpretation is that it resembles sleeping and snoring during and operation.  However, you should listen to the song yourself and draw your own conclusions.  The song, \\"Here She Comes Now\\" tells about a woman who has a great form and fits a certain man's visual taste.  The instruments are played in a not too loud tone.  In the song, \\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\", a man laments over the death of a woman who cared about him to the extreme.  You hear a fast tempo by Maureen Tucker and abstract guitar solos by Lou and Sterling Morrison.  Finally, in the song \\"Sister Ray\\", you have different people in different verses being depicted.  In each verse, you have certain people, committing certain sins.  Most of these sins are either violent, or sexual, or both.  Along with that, you have this imaginary nun, Sister Ray, permitting them and discussing with them on how to committ these sins.  Once again, draw you own conclusions.  The song at a moderate tempo with extreme loudness and distortion from the guitars.  During the middle of the song, Mureen starts playing the drums faster and you hear it accelerating more towards the end.  John plays effective organ chords and licks thoughout the song.  This album has been I huge influence on the punk and heavy metal scene.  I think that members were influenced by several tracks in The Velvet Underground & Nico.  However, most of their style is borrowed from the album, White Light/White Heat.  This kind of music is not for everyone.  But it is definitely an album that is beyond its time. You can hear its influence in groups like Black Sabbath, The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, Talking Heads, Judas Priest, Guns 'n' Roses, Nirvana, Sonic Youth, Slayer, Nine Inch Nails,etc..
055358894X|5.0|This was the most entertaining book that I have ever read.  I loved it. My boyfriend loved it.  We actually raced to see who would get to the finish line first.  He won.  The story is unique.  There's plenty of comic relief through out the story and all of the character's have these great dimensions.  There's a lot going on in this story, but you wont find yourself getting lost.  Enjoy!
0525950079|1.0|I read the first book in the series years ago, and was excited when I heard there was another one coming out. I waited anxiously for months, and have just finished reading World Without End. I am very unhappy that Ken Follet chose to make this a quasi-porno book. He seems preoccupied with sex, even raunchy, explicit sex, homosexual sex, you name it, it is on almost every page. I started just skimming instead of really reading it about halfway through.<br /><br />Aside from the unnecessary sex scenes, the writing at times is almost juvenile. I have a hard time even believing this was written by an acclaimed and highly regarded author. Much of the dialogue seems like something written by a ten year old (no offense to ten year olds).<br /><br />All in all, a big disappointment. I wish I could send it back and have my money back. It was that bad.<br /><br />I wanted to like this book...a lot. But it is not worth the time.
1592332803|5.0|I recently began listening to the author's podcast, which is how I heard about this book.  It's really a gorgeous cookbook with many color photos and a terrific layout. I know there are people that criticize cookbooks with lots of photos as fluff, but trust me, this is one of the most comprehensive cookbooks I own.  As others have said, there is a *ton* of information on vegan baking, as well as tips scattered throughout the book.  The vast majority of ingredients are common and familiar.  I am a new vegetarian and there was only one ingredient that was new to me.  I was most impressed with the variety of desserts included.  Another reviewer already listed the categories so I won't repeat them, but the list is really extensive.  I just received the book yesterday so I'll have to amend this review once I've had a chance to do some baking (the lemon bars are at the top of my list), but I'm already hoping the author will create future cookbooks for all types of dishes!!    Update: I promised an update once I had tried some recipes--yum! I've made the chocolate chip cookies, the lemon bars, the apple pie with the flaky pie crust, the pumpkin pie with the pecan crust, the light lemon bundt cake, the blueberry orange bundt cake, the lemon cheesecake, and...my favorite...the German apple cake.  From the ingredients, the cake doesn't appear to be anything out of the ordinary, but it certainly is.  I couldn't get enough.  The chocolate cake (with her chocolate frosting) was the best I've had--moist, \\"chocolatey\\", light and fluffy.    In response to the comment on my original post, I wanted to add that while the quality of the recipes are obviously an important part of any cookbook, other characteristics are important too.  Is it easy to read?  Do the recipes use easy-to-find ingredients?  Is the layout attractive?  Am I, as the reader, given \\"bonus\\" information above and beyond the recipes?  The answer to all of these for the Joy of Vegan Baking is yes!!

B000VKJ6VS|4.0|Wow, I can't help but listen again and again.  This album, is as amazingly good as it is different from anything on the first Alter Bridge album or by Creed.  It is a new and exciting musical direction for Mark Tremonti even though the classic riffs are still there.  He brings in a lot of new tones and approaches to the melodies that he never used with Creed.  I read on their web site that this was truly a group effort by incorporating Myles this time in the writing process.  He also played supporting guitar on many of the tracks like \\"Rise Today.\\"  The title track demonstrates their ability to tone it down while not coming off sappy.  A definite must have for any self respecting fan of good guitar.  Creed who?

My other books I have read a little here and there.  I am ready for another more advanced book.    Thanks
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I love this movie I thought it was wonderful. It makes you ponder upon your future life, weather you'd wind up struggling or making it the easy way throughout life. The movie showed a caring father who loves and puts no one above his child, and gave a good example for young men these days, telling them that no matter what happens you should always be there for your child, and to always let them have that father figure in their lives. The way Will Smith played those roles so perfectly that you could feel his hurt, pain, and stress within the scenes in your heart. You know its amazing to see a black man show a great example of a great man coming up from nothing and making his life worth something, so that his child would do the same. I really enjoyed this movie it touched me in so many different ways, for a moment I sat down and thought about weather or not I was going to be like the mother in that film to just give up on my husband, when we are going through hard times and just walkout and leave. I couldn't do that! This is a strong and inspiring movie for everyone and I think it should be #1 in everything!                                               Amber Dillon
1401322336|4.0|Cooking has never been in my favorite things to do until BBC Food had a full day show rerun on Jamie Oliver's The Naked Chef. Very engaging fellow I'll say and his way of cooking is an absolute 'ezzy brezzy' for a so-so cook like myself. This book is as inspiring as his TV shows. And for the fact that this book is dedicated to help other less fortunate people out there makes it a worth while book to keep. Although, I wish he would explain more on the science of the food assembly he created. But I guess there's always another book for that.
B000E97Y6A|5.0|I love this movie because of the effects and heart touching moments.It is like they are showing what happens when man messes with what is not harming them at all.

B000007SPU|5.0|A slow lingering polished project of fathomless melancholy.  Mystified storylines of love and tragedy beautifully presented yet somehow pleasantly disturbing.  Gothic storms and effervescent fires slowly burning through the ages. One cannot escape being drawn in deeply by songs of sad happiness and mysterious emotional landscapes.  A skilled production by Ivo & Frye.  This was the second of three such productions and the masterwork of the trio.
B000VDDDY6|1.0|This is related to all the studio's , video and music that want to suck the blood money from the customers. Just like DRM these studio's want to get our money and tell us what to do with the product when we own it. paramount has ruined this Star Trek set, we have to come together as the consumers and say NO. If you pay the price they want you are playing into their hands and they are using you.We want a fair price not their one sided price, and we want Star Trek as it was not changed with so called special FX. The studio's are old school and these new times are something they will never understand, all they care about is the evil dollar.                They will get our message, DON'T BUY THIS !!!

B0002KVUKM|5.0|From the word go you are off and running.The animation is incredible and with surround sound cranked up the effects and musical score are part of the ride. For those that favor the wolfman in a turtle neck sweater stick to the classics If you favor a buzz saw of gnashing teeth and daggerlike claws tearing your way than you have found your flick. The  storyline was soooo easy to follow that I have to wonder about anyone who found it convoluted......to the purists who cling to the past you really should not compare the two.
B00005V1WO|4.0|In its eighty-eight quicksilver-fast minutes of existence, Gothic packs in a lot of sheer frickin' sex-oozing  brain bashing madness among the literati of the Regency era. Forget for a moment their contemporary Jane Austen with her hoity-toity prim and proper tales of eye-batting heiresses and manner-infused country gentlemen, no, this is Ken Russell's take on how the age's reigning rock star poet, George Gordon, Lord Byron, spent one memorable, acid trip like weekend in a rented Swiss castle along with some \\"unexpected visitors.\\"<br /><br />The events that followed left Byron's friend, physician, and sexual admirer Doctor John Polidori suicidal, Byron's sometimes bedmate Claire Clairmont insane and pregnant, saw the radical Romantic poet Percy Shelley scampering naked, crab-like along the castle's rooftop during a thunderstorm babbling about electricity being the germ of life, and overwhelmed Percy's teenaged wife Mary with visions of death and tragedy to the point where she saw her own demise as the only escape. And oh yeah, the weekend also inspired Mary to produce an oft-misunderstood little novel you've probably heard of: it's called Frankenstein.<br /><br />When things are done in Gothic, Byron has his way with just about everybody, no one is spared a bad acid trip's worth of crazed visions, and for those of us sitting back watching it all unfold, it's pretty interesting, particularly  if you come to the movie pre-loaded with the background story on the main characters and the legendary weekend about which Russell unabashedly speculates.<br /><br />Gothic stands as the perfect antidote to all those saccharine-esque Hollywood feel-good movies you've been seeing lately. It gives the soul a good old-fashioned leech-bleeding.

B000URDEB0|5.0|I must admit that, due to a variety of factors preceding the release of Dark Passion Play, I harbored a secret belief that this album would be the biggest disaster in Nightwish's career. The most obvious source of doubt came from new singer Annette Olzon, who, while proving herself  adept as a singer on the first single, the ballad Eva, felt like a very conventional choice for this subgenre, for which Nightwish was a major architect. To my worried ears, she sounded almost exactly like Sharon den Adel from Within Temptation, and I was afraid Nightwish's sound would lose a lot of its distinctiveness. My other anxiety stemmed from their previous release, Once. The album was so damn good, I feared that Tuomas might have blown his creative load at the first sign of a full orchestra, and might be out of original ideas for this album, leading to a derivative retread.    On both scores, my concerns have proved unjustified. Dark Passion Play slowly revealed itself to be a new masterpiece in the Nightwish catalogue, conventional vocalist notwithstanding. Annette's voice, while not nearly as unique or distinctive as Tarja's, is still very powerful, and matches the songs almost perfectly, although she does seem strangely underutilized, sharing much more time with Marco than Tarja ever did. I have a feeling this has to do with the fact that all the songs were already written when she came on board, and by the time Tuomas pens the next album, he should have a much better idea of what her voice is and is not suited for and adjust his process accordingly. Hopefully, I won't have to wait another THREE YEARS to find out if I'm correct or not.    The musical style has also continued to grow. While there are inevitably a few passages that feel reminiscent of Once, by and large Dark Passion Play is its own album. Apart from the new vocalist, the biggest stylistic change here is a tendency toward darkness (as the title might suggest). Tracks like Bye Bye Beautiful and Master Passion Greed are among the heaviest and most aggressive Nightwish has ever performed. (This makes sense, given their subject matter.) Uplifting tracks like Amaranth and Meadows of Heaven keep the angst from becoming overbearing.     One of the things that most impressed me on the album is the variety of musical influences it culls together in the space of seventy-odd minutes, a length that, if I'm not mistaken, makes this the longest Nightwish LP ever. Sahara is an energetic composition laced with a light sprinkle of Arabian flavor. The Islander, penned by Marco Hietala and centering around his soulful vocals, is a beautiful, Celtic-style anthem, immediately followed by the violin- and bagpipe-soaked instrumental, Last of the Wilds, which wouldn't sound out of place in a Final Fantasy videogame (yes, that's a compliment). Meadows of Heaven begins with Annette's slow vocals perfectly complementing an atmospheric piano accompaniment, and gradually builds to a soaring Gospel choir that bring to mind a Southern Baptist church on a Sunday morning. The effect of this, on first listen, is a bit jarring, perhaps even to the point of confusion, but the more I listen to it, the more I fall in love with it. To me, it's a perfect example of why Nightwish is at the top of the symphonic metal genre: their willingness to take risks and think outside the box. I can't imagine Tristania ending an album this way.     More traditional fare is also prevalent, such as the gothic-tinged Cadence of Her Last Breath. Eva is the inevitable, yet catchy, ballad that has some of the most prominent lyrics I've ever heard in a Nightwish song, crafting a story around a young girl who imagines faraway worlds to escape her abusive peers. Whoever Brings the Night is a great headbanger in the vein of Dark Chest of Wonders, with shrieking choirs and great, sludgy metal riffs courtesy of Emppu, who wrote the song. 7 Days to the Wolves is the Planet Hell of Dark Passion Play, a big, bombastic marvel with a no-holds-barred chorus that culminates in a frenzied orgy of orchestral strings and Jukka's pounding drums.    And that, of course, leaves only The Poet and the Pendulum, a 14-minute behemoth that really deserves its own paragraph. It was pretty ballsy of the band to start the album with such a long track; even now, I'm not sure if it shouldn't have been included later on the disc, as it's a bit much to take without first getting a general feel for the album. Be that as it may, The Poet and the Pendulum is nothing more or less than what we've come to expect from a long Nightwish track, smoothly slipping from fast to slow, heavy to melodic, light to dark from one moment to the next. In terms of epic scope, I would place it lower than Ghost Love Score (in spite of the latter's shorter length, it feels much more dynamic and slightly less gratuitous), but above Fantasmic and Beauty of the Beast. The Poet and the Pendulum feels just a minute too long and a hair too static to be as tremendous an accomplishment as I think Tuomas was aspiring toward. Still, it's more than a worthy addition to Nightwish's growing list of amazing epic tracks. The orchestra was beefed up significantly for this album, and on The Poet and the Pendulum, it certainly shows.    Dark Passion Play is going to have to overcome a lot of extraordinarily high expectations; even a full two years after her dismissal, Tarja purists are still griping about it like they just found out yesterday. While I will certainly continue to follow Tarja's solo career with great interest (her new work sounds damn promising, as it happens), DPP has convinced me that Nightwish is larger than any one vocalist. We fans are standing at the threshold of a new era, not to sound too melodramatic, and while I cannot yet guarantee that this album will have the staying power of Once or Oceanborn, my immediate feeling is that it is a top-notch kick start to what will hopefully be a long and consistent chapter in the band's professional life.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|I find it rather strange that movies like this exist.  For some reason, the companies would rather hype some of the other trash that they want you to see, but when a movie comes along that gets great reviews and the public loves it, they just dismiss it in favor of their other rubbish.<br /><br />Such is the case with Stardust.  So far, everyone who I've taken to see it has raved about it for hours after coming from the theater.  It is a superb movie with a perfect mix of comedy, romance and adventure.  It reminded me a lot of 'The Princess Bride', and like Princess Bride, it manages to have just the right mixture of all three.  It also maintains some similarity with Willow, so if you've seen and enjoyed either of those movies, you'll probably find this one right down your street.<br /><br />Charlie Cox makes an excellent hero, named Tristan...seemingly rather naive in his actions at first, he soon learns some of life's hardest lessons during the adventures from this tale.<br /><br />Claire Danes is a most beautiful 'princess in distress', and she shines (literally) in her role as the desirable and vulnerable Yvaine, a star fallen from heaven.<br /><br />The plot thickens as you realize that Yvaine is desired by quite a few people...and not for healthy reasons, either.  The royal princes want her because she has the necklace, and without it they cannot be king.  The witches (with Michele Pfeiffer is excellent one of the three evil sisters) want her  for her heart, which will restore them to beauty.  Yet Tristan and Yvaine must outwit all of these adversaries in this excellent adventure.<br /><br />Even though the story is about their romance and adventure, the comedy was great.  I haven't laughed so hard in a movie for awhile.<br /><br />I won't go too much more in to the movie if you've not seen it, but suffice it to say...I think that even though it may have slumbered at the box office, this will become another of those movie classics that everyone has on their shelf.
B000063S31|5.0|This was Elvis' first studio LP after being in the army for 2 years.(Try and picture one of today's artists being drafted and pulled away from the spotlight for 2 years!) \\"Elvis is Back\\" is a remarkable record: Pop, gospel, rock, blues (and, oh, the blues on this record!)...this is pure Elvis! He would go on to record a couple of other great studio LPs in the early 60s (\\"Something for Everybody\\" and \\"Pot Luck,\\") but, unfortunately, all would be overshadowed by the soundtracks. When \\"Blue Hawaii\\" topped the album charts for 25 weeks, the dye was cast: Elvis would be stuck doing 14 song \\"travelogues\\" for another 7 years; but this album catches Elvis in great voice and spirit. Elvis was back, baby! Buy this record!

1591841666|2.0|The Dip shouldn't be a book onto itself.  It should be a chapter of his last book.  It's not that Mr. Godin doesn't communicate well the need and importance of his notion of quitting and when and why to do it.  It's just that it's not necessary to write a small book about it.  His book can be summed up by this: \\"Don't fall in love with a tactic and defend it forever. Instead, decide once and for all whether you're in a market or not.  And if you are, get through the Dip.\\"    Mr. Godin is an excellent writer, communicator, and thinker and highly recommend his book \\"Small is the New Big.\\"  In particular, he has a very evolved blog-oriented succinct style.  \\"The Dip\\" seems to drag out what was probably a blog entry for 100 pages.  It feels like a paper you wrote in college where you just keep repeating your thesis statement over and over in different ways to drag out and make the paper long enough.

0446613444|4.0|The first thing that stood out about this book is how good the writing was. I started reading it and even though the events where not following at a very fast pace, I found myself halfway through the book in no time. The main reason behind this was the skill Connelly displayed for describing the different characters, and the ability for creating engaging dialogues.<br /><br />There are two reasons why I did not give this novel the top rating. The first one is that I felt a little cheated by one of the points near the end. Halfway through the book most readers will likely start thinking about a likely solution to the mystery, but will discard this due to a very specific piece of information, which at the end gets explained in a not too convincing way. The other reason for a less than excellent rating is the number of mistakes on Spanish expressions. It is surprising that an author of this quality cannot take the time to verify that the little Spanish he is using throughout the novel is accurate. Instead, we find several cases of gender incompatibility in the expressions, and misspelled words, like beer as \\"Cervesa\\" instead of the correct \\"Cerveza\\", not once, but many times in a row.<br /><br />The good points are much more prominent though, and it is really hard to pinpoint all of them. I would have to say that the thing I like most about these novels is the main character. Harry Bosch is a detective that does not care about politics in the department, or about what the press may think; he just wants to find the culprits and deliver justice for the victims. He also has a heavy personal baggage related to his childhood and upbringing, which still affects him to this day and makes for some mesmerizing psychological aspects. But this character is just one piece of the puzzle, since the author clearly has a great ability for weaving an interesting plot and then uses the detective to start revealing the facts layer by layer, as if he was peeling an onion until getting to its core. And in this case, there are many layers to consider. Harry gets involved in a series of murder investigations that include among its victims a member of the force, an informant, and a laborer. Adding some romance to the dangerous mix works wonders, and we are drawn into the story as a moth to the fire.<br /><br />I am confident that most mystery readers will find this book to be very satisfactory. The fact that the author has created a complex main character, and has displayed a natural writing ability leads me to believe that this series can only get better. I am looking forward to reading the next installment!n this case, there are many layers to consider.

B00011F5DK|5.0|I look for toys and games that can stand up to my kids' short attention span and I think I've found the perfect game!  I don't know what part of the brain it stimulates, but the stategy borders on that of chess in that it encourages one to think several moves ahead.  Nevertheless, it was  easy to learn and so much FUN!  But beware, three players is not as much fun as four or two players because having to alternate playing the green pieces is somewhat confusing - some would say challenging; no one cares if green wins or loses in a three-player game.
0805079831|1.0|I feel really bad for the person who's never been exposed to economic or finance ideas before.  You might take this seriously.  I'll sum it up for you briefly:    1. Socialism is the best form of government / civic life, but...  2. A ruthless right-wing conspiracy defeated it.    I think the saddest part of the book is how she disparages Milton Friedman.  This is an economist who was well regarded from across the political spectrum and really changed the way everyone thinks about the economy today.     If you want a left-leaning book on economics there are a lot better places to go.  If you want to understand how the center-right understands these issues there are also a lot better places to go.

It's a heartbreaking trip down memory lane to the time I loved the Crue the most, but it's a wonderful read, and a tribute to Nikki's intelligence, capacity to love, and his ability to forgive and overcome the demons that haunted him since his childhood.

More recently I picked it up again, this time determined to see it through.<br /><br />Although it wasn't compelling at the start, with the appearance of an old pirate, Billy Bones, at the Admiral Benbow Inn run by young Jim Hawkins' father, it did start to pick up a head of steam as I pushed my way into it. I was pleasantly surprised to find it catching me up with the discovery of the map and the appearance of the pirates in hot pursuit of Billy Bones, and Jim's race to Dr. Livesy and Squire Trelawney to gain their protection. Intriguingly these upstanding English gentlemen, pillars of their community, decide to hunt the treasure for themselves though the squire, at least, lacks the good sense or discretion to keep the project secret. And so young Jim is swept along into the excursion, upon the death of his father, and soon finds himself aboard a suspect ship manned by an even more suspicious seeming crew on the way to a desert island in the Caribbean where old pirate Captain Flint's treasure is purportedly buried.<br /><br />The most interesting character is, of course, the by now famous Long John Silver who has long since entered into the cultural zeitgeist. But Silver's not nearly as charming or charismatic in this book as he has come to seem in popular recollection. Young Jim Hawkins, for his part, is a mischievous fellow who manages to get himself into one scrape after another while always coming out alright, even when he is obliged to face down a treacherous mutineer or when he stumbles unthinkingly into the pirates' own nest.<br /><br />In truth Treasure Island is not quite as exciting or as easy a read as one might expect for all its reputation. Still, it was nicely done and kept me reading to the end (though it did end with something of a letdown, leading me to think it somewhat overrated). It was a boy's book from the first, according to its author and I think it works well enough as that. Still, it's somewhat dated and lacks the excitement we've come to expect in our adventures today. Good but not among the best, in my view. I thought Stevenson's Master of Ballantrae much the better book.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]ated).

B000KN9FQ2|4.0|Bloc Party is one of those prolific bands that is constantly writing material. Between albums they write a new song - they release it as a new single. When they go in to write for an album, they write enough material for two albums and then release a constant stream of singles and EPs with unreleased b-sides. As a fan I love this, because they always have something new or something I haven't heard yet.<br /><br />This is the Japanese (Import) version of their latest full length 'A Weekend In The City'. The cool thing about this version is that it has two Bonus tracks: \\"We Were Lovers\\" and \\"England\\". Both songs are great and are as good as any of the songs that build up the \\"core\\" of this album.  \\"We Were Lovers\\" starts as a pretty and intricate song that breaks out into a driving rocker about half way through. This follows the pattern of many of the songs on this album - they build to a release. I think this works well. \\"England\\" is a more moderate tempoed song that stays mostly constant and has a good catchy riff.<br /><br />The \\"core\\" group of songs that make up this album are the same no matter where it was released. It is a very cohesive album of songs that all fit well together. There are some solid stand out tracks - 'Uniform', 'Song for Clay'; and some great singles - 'Hunting for Witches', 'I Still Remember'.<br /><br />*I just wanted to make sure to point out that the Bonus Tracks here are different than the ones that came on the Best Buy and the Target Exclusive versions of this album. The Target version contains the Bonus Tracks 'The Once And Future King' and 'Secrets'. These are also really good songs, especially 'The Once And Future King'. 'Emma Kate's Accident' and 'Version 2.0' are on the Best Buy version. I have bought all three of these versions of this album ( and also a number of the singles) so I could get all these great b-sides. I've found about 12 b-side tracks after searching through all the different versions of this album and its accompanying singles!<br /><br />'A Weekend In The City' is a great sophomore effort from a great (dance-rock?) band. Fans of good music will like this one. Fans of Bloc Party like myself, will enjoy hunting down all the great b-sides. Wikipedia.org has a good breakdown of their discography which will help you find all their hard to find tracks. Also look at some of the international Amazon websites for sinlges and versions that may not be on the U.S. Amazon site.

B00005RFAI|4.0|This is a very good CD... I love 3 songs that are included on it... but now I have listened all of them, I like the other ones... Pink hasa huge talent...  she writes her songs and that's very valuable...<br /><br />The CD was used, but it was in perfect conditions... I trust them

B000V8I2QU|5.0|I'm a Springsteen fan, yes.  But certainly not as big of a fan as I know tens of thousands of others are...as in I have every CD and I've seen him in concert half a dozen times.  I've never seen him in concert and I owned 3 CD's prior to buying \\"Magic.\\"  But now that I have listened to Magic, all I can say is that I'm completely dumbfounded.  How is it possible to have made something THIS GOOD???  I've never listened to a CD for the first time that is so INSTANTLY \\"listenable\\" and \\"craveable\\"!!!  The phrase that keeps coming to my mind as I listen to it is... it just \\"fits\\" in your ear.   I don't see how anyone who loves music could not love this CD.
0763619612|4.0|The Dot is a beautifully illustrated book about a VERY good art teacher. I found it when I was already an adult, but in a way it is written for adults anyway. The book addresses those who are unsure of themselves, which occurs in adults just as often as in children. The message is clear but not didactic, and the illustrations underline the moral.

It is about 50/50 techniques and projects and covers everything in great detail.  The projects are really interesting and different for anything I've seen before.  The finished items look really professional and prove that polymer clay can be pretty amazing when in the right hands. I would strongly recommend that anyone into polymer clay get this book.
B00004YX39|4.0|The sardonic brain trust that comprised Steely Dan in this outing, explore with delicious irony and wit various ills and taboo associated with American societal organisation; moreover, in the decade that followed the one undeniable theme that comes from this album and its predecessor (Aja) is that despite the inevitable innovation, production advances and marketing associated with the music industry, that those lyrics and music, which will stand the test of time comes from both individual musician and songwriters whose passion is to tell us a story or to evoke  through music both pleasure and pain that has been either masked or embellished. Something the popular music failed to accomplish in the eighties, thanks goodness these musician and lyricist saw fit to utilise, jazz, pop rock and words to suggest to the next generation of musician and songwriters that it is indeed about the music.
B00006AVRK|5.0|Quick delivery in just 2-3 days!  Can't beat the price either.  Top-notch DVD quality all discs.  No flaws at all!  Wonderful chemistry between actors Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry--they bring that BBC \\"British quirkiness\\" to each episode.  Watched the whole series in less than 2 weeks and am starting again.  Great jazzy score and a real feel for 1930`s London.  Recommend the set to anyone!!  If you like value, here it is!
B000H7J9QM|2.0|This review is strictly on the quality of the HD transfer. The story alone is great whether on VHS, DVD, or HD. However, the transfer to HD isn't as good as I would have hoped. I'm actually not very demanding in regards to perfect HD quality, but lets face it, this transfer leaves a lot to be desired. I have this movie in DVD and Blu-ray. It does look better in blu-ray, however I don't feel that it was that much better that it was worth the extra cost. In some scenes, it felt like I was watching the DVD. This transfer was actually one of the more disappointing bluray transfer that I have seen. I did not notice any pixelation, but everything just wasn't sharp or defined as a true HD movie. I would recommend it if you don't already have this on DVD.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Best movie of the year and since the movie is all about the music the soundtrack is a must.  Though the songs are great on their own I suggest seeing the movie first.  Once you see Once once you'll see why you need to get the soundtrack.
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|This movie was full of characters from most of the popular FF games, but lacked a true story line. Was easy on the eyes but heavy on the wallet. Will wait until a real full feature movie of FF flair comes to air and proves to be worth purchasing.
0670038040|4.0|Typical of John Mortimer's novels... amusing, beautifully written and topical.  Pity it had to be so short, but worth the read as it is.
1596912375|4.0|There really ought to be another word for 'gripping' - it's so trite, and yet it's ideal to describe this crackerjack read. I hadn't read anything by William Boyd before this, and I'm delighted to have found him.  And I'm always a bit fascinated by men who can write so convincingly in the first person as women ...   Mr Boyd's crisp, articulate prose carries you along without ever getting in the way - which keeps things clear so you can concentrate on who's who and who's doing what in all the cloak-and-daggery. The plot's quite simple: Ruth, a young English woman, discovers her mother, Sally, had been a WWII spy, working on propaganda for a small British intelligence organisation.   Mr Boyd's technique of alternating chapters from Sally's memoir with chapters from the daughter's life heightens the drama: we swing from Ruth's humdrum life in 1970s Oxford to Sally's derring-do as she progresses from recruitment in pre-war Paris to missions in the US as it tries to withstand pressure from Britain and Russia to enter the war.  Like all great spy stories, the tension builds beautifully with twists and intrigue and subterfuge, of course, and though the plot thickens -- sorry! -- it never bewilders.  I enjoyed the parts that dealt with Sally's recruitment and training, loved the sense of atmosphere in '40s London and New York, and sympathised with  both women as each struggled to come to terms with the outrageous skeletons in Sally's cupboard.  A ripper.

B000V8I2QU|1.0|I love the new songs, so I'm not going to spend time going over them one by one. My beef is with the production of the CD.<br /><br />How is it possible for EVERY instrument to be playing at exactly the same level throughout every song, throughout the entire CD? The music is SO compressed that at times I can barely hear the vocals. There's an organ in there somewhere- I thought I heard it. Guitar solos... I hear something, but I can't make out the riff. Sax, snare, bass-- all sounding as if they're being played through a funnell. Was this mixed for AM Radio??<br /><br />I know there has been chatter about CD's being issued too hot, too loud, but this is ridiculous. And I don't care if it's Springsteen's \\"signature\\" sound - this CD goes over the line. As great as the songs are, its painful to listen to them. How bout a 5.1 mix to open it up? It would be great to hear the drums and bass and organ and guitar and vocals--- instead of just drumsbassorganguitarvocals !
B00000JGHM|3.0|\\"Heat\\"<br /><br />Robert Deniro and Al Pacino head a star studded cast (including Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, Tom Sizemore) which has some brilliant dialogue throughout, but an unrealistic ending.<br /><br />While both Deniro (playing a young Vito Corleone) and Pacino (reprising his role as Michael Corleone) starred in the \\"The Godfather Part 2\\", they didn't appear in any scenes together so you can say that this is their first time together (if only for a short time).<br /><br />Their only real dialogue is a sequence at the center of the movie that clarifies the movie's real subject. As it begins, a Los Angeles police detective named Hanna (Pacino) has been tracking a high-level thief named McCauley (Deniro) for days. McCauley is smart and wary and seems impossible to trap. So, one evening, tailing McCauley's car, Hanna turns on the flashers and pulls him over.<br /><br />McCauley carefully shifts the loaded gun he is carrying. He waits in his car. Hanna approaches it and says, \\"What do you say I buy you a cup of coffee?\\" McCauley says that sounds like a good idea.<br /><br />The two men sit across from each other in a diner: Middle-aged, weary, with too much experience in their lines of work, they know exactly what they represent to one other, but for this moment of truce they drink their coffee.<br /><br />McCauley is a professional thief, skilled and gifted. When Hanna subtly suggests otherwise, he says, \\"You see me doing thrill-seeking holdups with a `Born to Lose' tattoo on my chest?\\" No, says the cop, he doesn't. The conversation comes to an end. The cop says, \\"I don't know how to do anything else.\\" The thief says, \\"Neither do I.\\" The scene concentrates the truth of the moviw, which is that these cops and robbers need each other: They occupy the same space, sealed off from the mainstream of society, defined by its own rules.<br /><br />They are enemies, but in a sense they are more intimate, more involved with each other than with those who are supposed to be their friends.<br /><br />Beyond that, Heat is anti-climatic.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|Very good! ! !  I recommend!  The album more fun and more of the troubled career of Avril Lavigne! !  This is the best! !  Note: I bought the first Deluxe Edition that came out! !  This is also the same as the other only changed the cover! ! Very good! !
B00003RQNJ|3.0|This is one of those odd films that was pretty great at its release but failed to weather the test of time. It's about two bandits (and a gal), who travel the west, and ultimately to Bolivia, robbing banks. Their big thing is to not kill anyone.<br /><br />It's a bit of a love story and, for me, that was the superior facet of the movie.<br /><br />If you saw this film when it was released, and re-watch it now, it's a bit of a disappointment. The director relied heavily upon cliche-type  material and that is the chief failing of the work.<br /><br />I will comment that the cinematography is just excellent, which makes the movie still somewhat enjoyable to watch. But it's not at all a film that most western fans will savour.
B000UGG39Q|5.0|All of us Down fans have waited a long time for this. If you are down with Down, why are you reading all these loving reviews, and haven't bought it yet? This album has been in my stereo since I got it! Only gripe, is that Amazon TOOK WAYYYYYYYYY TOO LONG to ship out the CD! Fave songs are: Beneath the Tides, Pillamyd and In the Thrall of it All, and Nothing in Return. Stop Reading. Buy Album. Play Loud. Repeat ... PLAY LOUD! If Down is playing in your town. GO! Sorry to be so bossy. But, I'm right, as always. ;-)
B000022TSY|5.0|I have loved this film since it was first released and began playing at drive-ins all over America back in the 60s. The teaming of Peter Fonda (his top film), Dennis Hopper, and Jack Nicholson was pure brillance in casting.<br /><br />The story is about two free spirits who score a big dope/cash connection in Mexico and then head east, cross-country on their chopper motorcycles, for New Orleans where they intend to celebrate Mardi Gras with the masses. Along the way, they encounter all manner of people and societies including poor Mexican families, hippies in a commune, really mean rednecks, and many more.<br /><br />The larger theme here is the perceived freedom of the sixties, which turns out at every intersection to be little more than a fantasy. But I need to say right here that the filmscore for this movie represents one of the top Classic Rock albums of the 20th Century. Jimi Hendrix, Steppenwolf.... need I say more?<br /><br />The top performance in this film, no question, was by Jack Nicholson who plays a drunken, seedy, small-town lawyer who throws caution to the wind and permanently forsakes his small-town life to ride with the boys to Mardi Gras, his pilgrammage of sorts.<br /><br />If you have any interest whatever in the 60s, in rock music, or in the sociology of the free-love society, you really cannot afford to miss this incredible art-film. It's just superb!
B00005RRG9|5.0|This is one of my all time favortie Disney movies. Hayley Mills is just a delight to watch on screen and expertly pulls off playing both \\"twins\\". Maureen O'Hara is as beautiful as ever, adding quite a bit of humor along the way as the twin's mother.    I have to admit, I love the house in California that is featured in the movie and that's a big part of why I watch it over and over again, but the main reason I watch it is because of the songs! I can sing along to all of them and I enjoy every minute of this classic film. I hope you do too!
0792844793|5.0|This is Dennis Hopper's top film. He ACTED better in \\"Easy Rider,\\" but here he had the premiere role.<br /><br />It's all about a creep who is sexually out on the fringe. He whacks scissors, sucks oxygen and calls for his mommy while he gets his jollys. Now I know that doesn't sound like all that great of a movie, but it is.<br /><br />It's a fascinating psychological study -- very creepy!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I became hooked on this show after catchign a few free episodes on the 101 from directv. After catching the tail end of the series I had to see the beginning, Show is awesome a CSI type show, not as science-ie with an awesome twist on the main character. I definitely recommend buying now and recording the second season asap.
B00003CXCW|5.0|This is the story of a demented old silent film actress who decides her day is not over. Through a comedy of errors, a happy-go-lucky and handsome young screenwriter stumbles into her realm and she latches on to him like a spider on a fly. He's broke and she's filthy rich -- she commissions him to live-in and write her Pinnacle role which she intends for Cecil B. DeMille, her friend of the good old days, to produce. She also intends for the young man to be her gigilo, a role that he's unwilling to fulfil.<br /><br />DeMille actually makes a cameo appearance in this fine old black and white production and the story is just a great one.<br /><br />I particularly recommend this movie to anyone interested in the doings of old Hollywood; however, almost anyone would enjoy this picture of love, hate, hope, revenge, and ultimately, murder!

B0008KLVG4|4.0|There are plenty of reviews of this one so I'll hit on some specific points:<br /><br />1. I think that the casting was a little lame -- the people in the roles are pretty much \\"as expected\\" and I thought that took away from the movie. I didn't see any newer actors \\"develop a future\\" thru this horror vehicle.<br /><br />2. It's a good story, a great white shark plagueing a resort town, and the subsequent political and other conflicts between the mayor, the police chief, the marine biologist and, the shark hunter.<br /><br />3. The suspense was really great -- few movies, short of \\"The Birds\\" achieve this level of keeping you on the edge of your seat. The creepy  soundtrack probably accounted for 50% of this actuality.<br /><br />This movie isn't for everyone but I'd watch it again.
1595141715|5.0|I don't often write introductions to my reviews.  In fact, the last time I can remember doing so was with the wonderful [[ASIN:1595140557 Pucker]] by Melanie Gideon, which I read in 2006.  However, THIRTEEN REASONS WHY, the debut novel from author Jay Asher, is the type of book that begs an introduction.  So if you'd like to skip down to the third paragraph for the \\"meat\\" of the story, I won't hold it against you -- but you'll be missing something important.<br /><br />If you have the chance to only read one novel this year, THIRTEEN REASONS WHY should be that book.  It's sad, amazing, heartbreaking, and hopeful, all at the same time.  I dare you to read it and not become so immersed in the story that you lose track of time and your surroundings.  You'll cry, several times, while reading this story.  You'll have no choice but to think about your actions, and wonder what type of effect they have on other people.  And, in the end, you might also find the need to say \\"thank you.\\"<br /><br />Now, on to the story...<br /><br />When Clay Jensen finds a package on his front porch, he's excited.  A package, for him?  With no return address?  What could it possibly be?  What Clay finds is a shoebox full of cassette tapes, each marked as \\"Cassette 1: Side A,\\" \\"Cassette 1: Side B,\\" etc.  Of course he rushes to the old radio/cassette player in his dad's garage to check out these mysterious tapes.<br /><br />And soon wishes, wholeheartedly, that he'd never picked up that stupid package from his front porch.<br /><br />What he hears when he inserts that first tape is the voice of Hannah Baker.  Hannah, the girl he'd crushed on for longer than he could remember.  The girl he went to school with.  The girl he worked at the movie theater with.  The girl who had changed, drastically, in the last several months.  Hannah Baker, the girl who committed suicide.<br /><br />Clay soon realizes that these tapes aren't just a suicide note, aren't, really, even a clear-cut rendition of why she did what she did.  Instead, these are thirteen reasons -- thirteen people, to be exact -- who created a snowball-effect of events that led Hannah to believe that suicide was her only option.  But why is Clay on that list?  How could he possibly be one of the reasons that she killed herself?<br /><br />As the day goes on, Clay becomes obsessed with listening to the tapes.  And what he hears frightens him, disturbs him, and, in the end, leads him to realizations that he never would have expected.  As Clay listens to the role that thirteen people, including himself, led in the ultimate death of Hannah Baker, his view of the world, and himself, changes drastically.<br /><br />You will love this book, because you won't be able to help yourself.  You will feel what Clay feels.  You will, in a very strong way, experience the highs and lows of Hannah's life right along with her.  And there is nothing, in my opinion, that could speak better for the authenticity of a book.  Read THIRTEEN REASONS WHY.  And then, if you're like me, you'll read it again.

B00005JPRD|5.0|ACROSS THE UNIVERSE was indeed a surprisingly amazing film from Director and writer Julie Taymor. Taymor visually displays the tumultuous 1960s, and uses the most popular and influential music of The Beatles, which brought the generation together. Besides the music, the story line and the very artistic images make the film, which conveys the confusion, revolution, and love that was generated by one of the most misunderstood generation.<br /><br />The interesting aspect about the film is that the six major characters possess names from Beatles songs. First, there is Jude (\\"Hey Jude\\") from Liverpool, England, who takes a respite from his job as a ship dockworker, and heads for New York City to find his long-lost father who works as a janitor at Princeton University. Second, there is Lucy (\\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\"), who waits for her high school sweetheart who is fighting in Vietnam. Third, there is Max (\\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\"), Lucy's brother, a Princeton dropout, who moves to Greenwich Village and becomes a taxi-driver, but is later drafted into the war. Fourth and fifth, Sadie (\\"Sexy Sadie\\")and Jo-Jo (\\"Get Back\\"), the musicians in the film who are a cross between Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, but act more like Ike and Tina Turner. Sixth, Prudence (\\"Dear Prudence\\"), the lesbian-cheerleader from the Midwest, drifts in and out of the picture.<br /><br />There is plenty of symbolism in the film that crosses a variety of genres, which include music, art, and politics.  Foremost, the images in the film represent the events that shaped the Sixties, such as the Anti-war movement, Civil Rights Movement, Vietnam War, hallucinogenic drugs, and free love. And the highlights of the film is the appearance of Joe Cocker and his rendition of \\"Come Together,\\" and U2's Bono who plays Dr. Robert and sings \\"I Am The Walrus,\\" (he almost looks a little like Dennis Hopper's character in EASY RIDER).<br /><br />Overall, ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is a no nonsense entertaining film that relives one of the most powerful periods in American history. At times, the images of yesterday almost resonate an ironic present.most powerful periods in American history. At times, the images of yesterday almost resonate an ironic present.

B000FS9FCG|5.0|The year is 2020 and the people of Great  Britain are blind. It's not entirely their fault--the government in the persona of High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) has put blinders on the British as much as they are too frightened to see what is happening for themselves.     Britons' everyday world is very much like George Orwell's \\"1984\\".  The heavily censored media controls what they see.  Language has morphed to the point where harmless words now carry a serious threat. The Party is all-powerful and can make people disappear without questions.  The countryside is mined with cameras and microphones to detect any protest and the police and military are empowered to eliminate enemies of the state. The Government may well be responsible for the deaths of over a 100,000 of its citizens due to St. Mary's virus.     Then one dark November 5th night, Evey Hammond (Portman), a young British woman is walking home and is accosted by men bent on doing her harm.  She's rescued by a black clad figure in a Guy Fawkes mask.      He calls himself \\"V.\\"     V (Hugo Weaving) offers truth and hope to the British people.  Taking his cue from the Guy Fawkes of history who tried to overthrow the British Government almost 4 centuries prior, V promises that in a year's time, there will be a revolution--the Parliament building will be destroyed and the old government will be overthrown.       The film covers the next year's time.  First, the police are attempting to locate V through various means.  Evey parts from V and goes out on her own only to be captured.  And V continues to spread the word to the British people.    Every book writer aspires to at least one good line per page.  I cannot say how many that translates to in movies, but \\"V\\" is beautifully and thoughtfully written.  In addition, the acting on the part of the major characters is good as well.  How Weaving can translate so much character without a facial expression, eludes me.  Natalie Portman's performance as Evey in captivity is also stellar.    As I started off, I really regret not having seen this film in full screen.  I understand it's available in IMAX format and I'd love to catch it on that kind of venue.  In particular, the scenes from High Chancellor Sutler would probably be hair raising.      Though I have rented this film, it's now on my wish list to add to my collection.  There is enough content to make \\"V\\" worth watching again--and showing to my friends.

0066620996|5.0|This is an outstanding book that is very interesting and fascinating reading. The fact that the book is based on five-years of research makes the research findings and conclusions credible and believable. This book answers a fundamental question: \\"Can a good company become a great company?\\" I also enjoyed the case studies inside it which greatly reinforced the author's message.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the topics on hiring (having the right people on the bus and on the right seats and the wrong people off the bus) and the Hedgehog Concept. The Hedgehog Concept basically says that if you can't be the best in the world at your core business, then it can't be the basis of a great company. You need to have a deep understanding and incredible simplicity. You need Big Hairy Audacious Goals (BHAGs) sitting in the middle of your three circles. Another interesting finding is on leaders that drive great companies. Jim Collins identifies the Level 5 Leadership who typically is self-effacing, quiet, reserved, shy and have a blend of personal humility and professional will. They are ambitious for the company and what it stands for and do not seek personal glory or self-aggrandisement.<br /><br />From the middle manager to the CEO, anyone involved in business management can find valuable leadership and business strategy tips, ideas and advice from this seminal work. Students or business persons seeking to truly understand what it takes to be a successful leader must read this book. The book teaches how even individuals can make the leap to outperform the market or the current market leaders. If you don't have time to read, get the audio book and listen. Jim Collins is extremely lively, interesting and easy to listen to.<br /><br />One possible weakness is that the study and its conclusions could be dated. The rate of change in the business world is so rapid in the past 5 or so years that it is quite possible that there could be a shift on what makes good companies great. So the argument by Jim Collins that he has uncovered basic facts about human organizations that will be unchanging may ultimately prove not to be totally correct.<br /><br />In case you have not yet done so, I recommend that you also read Jim Collins' other classic \\"Built to Last\\" which he authored with Jerry Porras.im Collins that he has uncovered basic facts about human organizations that will be unchanging may ultimately prove not to be totally correct.

B00005JLWN|4.0|After barely surviving World War III, the human race decides that they will not survive another war.  Eliminating emotion is the accepted panacea for future wars. Each citizen is to take a dose of medication every day.  In addition, books, works of art, artistic embellishments, and music are all banned--a loudspeaker continually announces the latest \\"bans for E10 content.\\" Their hope is to create a sterile utopia.  What they create instead is a totalitarian state run by the \\"Father\\" (Big Brother) of an order of Grammaton Clerics.     John Preston (Christian Bale) is the chief of these clerics.  In the first scene, we see him verifying the authenticity of the Mona Lisa--and then firing it himself instead of allowing it to be taken in 'because some things manage to escape.'    Preston is literally the 'cop's cop' and he's as straight arrow as they come.  When his partner, Partridge, begins to feel for the people of the Nethers, who are resisting being drugged and suppressing their emotions, Preston turns him in.      Preston may well have eradicated the Resistance problem had it not been for an accidentally skipped dose of medication.  The next day, he saw the sun rise for the first time and began to unthaw himself.      Preston begins to feel and consequently, his sympathies change.  He's thrust into a plot to overthrow the current government by killing the Father.      Bluntly, I could pick this film apart--yes, few of the individual ideas are new.  However, the way the film's ideas are put together is very well done.  Battles are in my opinion, better than \\"Matrix\\" and martial arts fans really need to see the \\"gun katas.\\"
B000VL9XNI|4.0|In the anticipation of waiting for AC/DC to release there new album, Sony have gathered together this 3 disc collectors edition of some rare performances and clips you may have seen that is mostly all live. Saying that, there are a couple of performances that are miming, but thats due to TV shows making them do such a thing for whatever reason they have. But still good to see them on stage performing it, in a way.    This is kind of like Family Jewels, only the performances are live. Starting with some rare black and white footage from 1974, the sound quality is not great, but after all, this is a collectors edition, so it will most likely be AC/DC fans purchasing this.    The titles are already written on the reviews here, so i wont waste time writing that out again.     The only reason I don't give this 5 perfect stars is not because of sound quality, but for not containing footage from the Fly On The Wall or Blow Up Your Video tours.    Apart from that, this is a must have for the AC/DC fanatic that can not get enough of the worlds most electrifying band.    As a hardcore fan, I have seen most of these performances via bootleg and live promo clips that have been around for years, but it is great to have much better then VHS quality versions now. About the only promo clip i can think of that is not included here is a For Those About To Rock clip they did as the actual promo. But i'm sure they will release that some day.    Even tho having the full shows of Rock Goes To College and things like that on bootleg and this only shows a couple of songs from it, this DVD still contains a lot of great performances from the last 30 years that I had never seen. in particular, i was ecstatic to see them perform an underrated song called Bedlam In Belgium, I just wish they could have included preformacnes of Thats The Way I wanna Rock N Roll and Are You Ready.    The bonus features are more live clips, and interviews. I had seen most of those interviews before, but not I havea much better quality version then what you can get from youtube or a bootlegged VHS/Beta quality.    The packaging is a nice tall box like that of Bon Fire, containing the 3 discs and a bunch of collectible things and posters. Mostly it is reproduced images of old tickets and badges etc.. and a nice big H2H poster with the promo info on it like what was pasted around places in 79 for that tour. Even the cover of the packaging looks nice, tho it might look black with a shiny AC/DC logo on it, if you hold it in the right light you can see some interesting nostalgia images reflecting off the cover.     Overall, great release, if you are not an AC/DC fan, it's hard to say weather you will like this release or not.  Some have complained already about it not being in surround sound, but it would be annoying to produce some songs in surround and some songs in stereo, you'd be adjusting your audio all the time you are playing it, so it's probably better to just leave it as the one sound throughout it. There is no way they could improve the quality of the sound for the early early footage, the sound is not great, but at least they have done what they can for the footage. They can not get rid of all the lines thought the footage, but I'm still glad to see them perform the Chuck Berry song School Days.    Now heres to hoping that we see a new AC/DC album within this century.
B00003CX8N|5.0|Several years ago, I took a bus tour through Scotland.  My companions couldn't understand why I spent an entire evening on my own prowling the local bookstore instead of the pub.  Truth is--when I was young and on a limited budget, I decided I'd rather buy books than booze.  Honestly, I'd rather buy books than almost anything.     In the Scottish bookstore, I loved perusing books I knew to see how the cover art, binding, and paper differed from ours.  Then, there were the UK-only editions, which that filled my spare suitcase on return. Pity I didn't find an antiquarian, I might have managed to stumble onto a shop similar to the one in this film.    Seeing this film, I so wish I had.      The story details the correspondence between Helene Hanff (Anne Bancroft) and Frank Doel (Anthony Hopkins). Helene is a voracious reader and freelance writer who cannot find the English books she seeks in Manhattan.  When she sees an ad for Marks and Co, a bookstore in London offering hard to find and out of print books, she writes.  She receives a reply from Frank, an employee of the firm--and thus their nearly 30 years of correspondence begins.    Letters between Helene and Frank span everything from WWII and the food rationing to their respective sports teams. As times goes on, professional relationships turn into friendships--and a good deal of the authors' lives are shared in the correspondence in addition to book  sales.     I would not recommend this film to a die-hard action and adventure fan, but for those of us who love books and would rather buy them than almost anything, it's a must-see.  Bookstores like Marks and Co are a rare find--and growing rarer as Ebay and online presences take over the business.  The story and the store are a refreshing trip to a past time.  Very well done.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|great service and quality of DVD. it was not a sample DVD that stores get to show on display for the public, those usually have somewhere that \\"not for sale\\" and the DVD has cut in it. I strongly recommend this provider.
B000UR9T82|1.0|Amazingly silly dance routines. Baaaad acting. Lame, lame, lame story (I particularly love how the meteorite happens to land right next Peter and Mary Jane while making-out on a giant self-made web). And all for a mere $60 retail. Thank god for Amazon! If you're into this sort of thing that is. Don't let the effects dazzel your brain, this is truely one of the worst comic book movies, yet. And it's Spiderman, how can you screw that up.

B000UBMZ4S|5.0|Probably the best sci-fi movie, ever! Intelligent and dark, it does not take the viewer for granted. \\"Blade Runner\\" was the first DVD movie I ever purchased and I've watched it dozens of times over the years, and it has never grown old. Its vision of the future down to the style of dress reamains incredibly modern, so much so, one gets the feeling, especially from the new cut, that it was a newly released movie instead of one that hit theatres some 25 years ago. A must for your HD-DVD collection.
0316067598|5.0|Having a grandfather who served in the First US Special Forces Unit (Black Devils Brigade) during WWII and a father who is a Naval Academy grad and served over in Vietnam, I found this story to have particular interest on a personal level.    I read this book in 2 days and it left me speechless when I completed it. The heroism with which these soldiers serve our country needs to be acknowledge much more than it is, and this story truly shows the strength and courage that these fine men bring to the people's lives that they touch on a daily basis. Much of the book left me feeling angry at the political situations which end up killing our soldiers, but it was also a breath of air to have heard this story first-hand from one tough son of a gun and hear about the brotherhood that these guys have.     If you know anything about the SEALs or want to read about one of the most powerful stories I have ever read, I implore you to pick up this book and give it a go; you will not be disappointed.
B0007R4TAS|2.0|I can't help but see this film as \\"Scrooge\\" playing Mr. Rochester, and quite frankly, that will never do. Not a favorite, but I'm glad to have added yet another twist on Jane Eyre into my collection.
0374105235|5.0|Amazing, horrifying, well-written, and a book that every American should read in order to better understand the conflicts of Africa.  What strikes me most about this boy's story is the fact that he was in the governmental army, not the rebel army.  But many times there was no difference between the two.  Such facts certainly make me doubt that any African or UN \\"peacekeeping\\" force will be able to change anything in that region.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Miss Potter is a remarkable story.  It has been a while since I have read anything about Beatrix Potter but thought the movie did her justice.  Everyone was perfect in their roles.  Animating the characters of her books and showing her connection to them was just the right touch
B000URDEB0|4.0|Ok, so I'm obliged to talk about Anette before anything else because I know that's what everyone if interested in.  I want to negate what someone else said about her sounding like Sharon Den Adel of Within Temptation.  Sharon Den Adel is an absolutely amazing, versatile singer - one of the best in progressive rock.  To compare Anette to Sharon is simply on the basis that neither sings operatically like Tarja did, but there is still a vast difference between the two.    So, about Anette herself.  I really did try to give her a chance.  I didn't immediately hate her like some old Nightwish fans.  However, I can't honestly say that I really like her that much.  There's nothing wrong with her voice but it's far too weak to really hold its own in a lot of the songs - her voice even gets lost at points.  Tarja added another layer of epic to the music which Anette simply takes away.  New comers to Nightwish might actually prefer Anette because of her more mainstream way of singing (I know it took me a little while to get used to Tarja in the first place but now it's hard for me to hear Nightwish without her).  My final consensus is that Anette doesn't ruin the music (we still have Tuomas' genius, at least) but she doesn't add anything to it, either.    I'll go through a brief run-through of each song:    1. Poet and the Pendulum - 10/10  This is truly the old, epic, orchestrated Nightwish style.  It's heavy and wonderful - if a bit lengthy (they definitely could have cut out quite a bit and it still would have been good).  Anette's voice tends to get VERY lost in this song but it's more of a chorus-type song so it's not too bad ( I can't help but imagine Tarja on this, though).    2. Bye, Bye Beautiful - 10/10  When I heard that Tuomas wrote this song for Tarja, I thought it was going to be a ballad.  It's actually a heavy, Marco-screaming filled rant at Tarja.  But it actually manages to come off tactfully enough (at least it's Marco screaming and not Anette) and if anything, it's the one thing that makes me forgive the band for kicking out Tarja because it's so emotionally charged.    3. Amaranth - 10/10  One of the singles of the album: I seriously overwatched this music video when it came out and thus, I am actually a little sick of this song.  It's a great song, though.  Old Nightwish style, very catchy, nice intro (I would parallel it to Nemo on Once).  Anette actually sounds fairly decent here, although she doesn't stand out.    4. Cadence of her last Breath - 8/10  The album starts to loose it's \\"Old Nightwish\\" sound here, and move onto a little bit different style.  Slower choruses dominate from here on out.  This is still a fairly good song.  Fairly catchy although the chorus is slowed down.    5. Master Passion Greed - 7.5/10  The heaviest song on the album - supposedly another rant at Tarja but I don't pick it up as much as in \\"Bye, Bye Beautiful.\\"  Lots of Marco screaming.  This song has the fatal flaw of being so heavy at times that it really looses most melody.  The orchestrated interludes between the singing generally bring some relief, though.    6. Eva - 9/10  The second single.  A very beautiful ballad.  It isn't really very typically Nightwish but it's still beautiful.  This is one of the few songs that Anette truly shines in - the simplicity of her voice fits into the beautiful simplicity of the song.    7. Sahara - 9/10  Tuomas tosses in some Arabian feel to the music every now in then.  It's a great song, although I do wish that the chorus was a little more fast-paced (the album loses all such choruses after \\"Amaranth\\").  There is a fairly nice haunting feel to this song, though.  Want of Tarja haunts me most in this song more than any others - I think she could make it an epic.    8. Whoever Brings the Night - 8.5/10  Ok, I lied.  This has a fairly fast-paced chorus.  But it still lacks the epic feel of \\"Poet and the Pendulum\\" and \\"Amaranth.\\"  It's good, it's catchy, but it's not really the reason we love Nightwish.    9. For the Heart I Once Had - 7/10  I sometimes skip this song.  It's just too... happy, almost, for Nightwish.  I know that sounds weird since the song is about losing a heart but it's just the sound of the music.  It's worth a few listens.    10. The Islander - 9/10  A very interesting celtic song reminding me strongly of \\"Blackmore's Night.\\"  No drums or heaviness, simply acoustic celtic.  Marco sings this song very well.  It almost makes me wish he became the primary singer instead of Anette (although, he does sing a lot on this album).    11. Lasts of the Wilds - 8.5/10  Very good purely instrumental song, still with a little bit of a celtic feel.  I feel like the placement directly after \\"The Islander\\" was rather bad taste, though, since they are both very weird songs for Nightwish and to place them both together starts to give the album the feel of a non-metal, celtic album.    12. 7 Days for the Wolves - 8.5/10  We get a little heavier here, again.  More of an epic feeling but it's more of a slow and heavy feeling, not of fast-paced energy.    13. Meadows of Heaven - 4/10  So Tuomas must have been aiming for more ballads but this one is actually truly bad.  It's just plain repetative and not very moving.    The major flaw of the album is the lack of very many fast-paced, energy-filled songs which characterized Nightwish previously.  However, it's still good stuff.  The first three songs are a particularly that Nightwish (well, maybe I should say Tuomas since he writes everything) still has more to give.
B000001GX8|5.0|When I saw that some customers had rated this item with 2 stars or less, I couldn't believe my eyes.  This is by far the best recording available.  How can you go wrong with such a cast, a Fischer-Dieskau is at his best in any opera.  He's such a delightful musician and artist. I disagree that the performance is plodding - it is anything but.  Bohm contrasts well the fast and lyrical overture and opening numbers with the slower arias later on into the first act.<br /><br />Bohm does well to contrast the characters with different voices.  The rich and bold voice of Fischer-Dieskau with the energetic lightness of Prey.  The same goes with the Countess and Susanna - Bohm's use of contrasts.  How boring if all the characters sounded the same!  The contrasts help to set the characters apart. It's such a stunning interpretation!  Mozart would have been proud.<br /><br />As for the lack of 'Italianness' - I think people forget that Mozart was Austrian, and not to mention that the opera is set in Spain and was based on a French play retooled by an Italian lyricist.  I don't think that it is fair to listen to this opera for its 'Italian-ness'.  It does the work an injustice to label it geographically or expect the music to represent a particular \\"culture\\" since it touches so many corners of Europe.<br /><br />This is a wonderful recording, and you won't be disappointed.

B000002UZ1|5.0|Some way, some how, four teenagers from lower middle-class families in Liverpool, England formed a rock band, called themselves The Beatles, and changed the world. Their music is love, it's rebellion, it's fun, it's sophisticated, it's thought-provoking, it's magical, it's silly, it's beautiful, it's rock n' roll, and it's GREAT. The Beatles 1962-1966 and The Beatles 1967-1970 (Red and Blue) are both 2-CD compilations of the best of their music. It's all in chronological order, and the song selection is on the mark. Get both of these collections (54 songs), listen to them often, and raise your kids on them (I do). This music will enrich your life, lift you up, make you happy, and give you hope when all hope is lost. The Beatles were, and still are, a very special gift to our world. Enjoy!
B000QQFKYE|5.0|Plot:  This is the wrong idea to start from as it's possible to write a thesis on the various interpretations of the film.   Anyway here's my take on it.    Like Mulholland Drive this is a dreamscape told symbolically via Hollywood, with all of the attendant illusion and memory.  A projector leads us to the inland empire (the internal world of the mind--here a sleeping mind very much as in Finnegans Wake) to replay incidents from the life and violently derailed marriage of a woman seen from different angles as she sleeps.  She's a whore, a killer, a betrayer, a wreck, a liar, and an `actress' both haunting and berating herself.  On the way Lynch plays with coded themes--the Axxon N references (axons in the brain with the added X and N mathematical symbols for multiplication and factoring, i.e., the endlessly complex mind dividing ceaselessly back into itself), the carefully buried yet clearly evident sexuality of the human-form rabbits (as in \\"breeding like rabbits\\") in their weird stilted sit-com with their secrets and problems of identity,  the stories within stories that smack of the imagination, the dislocations of time and space which do the same, the artifice/uncertainty of the settings, the need to defeat an illusive `phantom' and the probing camera (the restless eye more as an I) which is always there just behind the scenes.   Finally there is the symbolic death and self-reconciliation which seem to have become key Lynchian themes, plus the big clunking subconscious-heavy reference (sawing wood as the cliché for snoring/dreaming) as a tip-off in case you didn't get it.    On a second viewing I felt like setting-up a help group for the people who were probably wrong about Lynch's artistic motivations for creating this movie--before promptly signing myself into it.   In any case, noting that the relatively straightforward Mulholland Drive had puzzled much of its audience, I think any group of that kind would oversubscribe in seconds.      Inland Empire is deliberately irrational and determinedly non-linear so if you're not prepared to give it enough time, and spend some effort spinning theories,  then just don't bother. You'll probably hate it with a passion.    Cast:  A welcome return for some of Lynch's regulars and semi-regulars, along with brilliant character portraits from first timers.  There is no doubt this is Laura Dern's best performance and the film would be a complete mess without her.      Imagery:  The most striking in all of his work.  Although the lack of polished 35mm sometimes counts against him, Lynch has turned the digital process into something uniquely beautiful and/or terrifying.  The scenes in which people fade-in or suddenly disappear, as if in a dream, are magnificent.  The sudden bursts of colour are equally dazzling and some of the computer manipulations are 18-cert disturbing.    Lynchisms:   The entire film is one long Lynchian carnival.  If you know his cinema then you'll be busy spotting references to Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, Mulholland Drive, Wild At Heart, Eraserhead, The Straight Story and (sadly) Lost Highway.   For real Lynch aficionados there are also the above mentioned inclusions of Rabbits and references to Axxon N, which were previously limited to online subscription.  Likewise the dialogue is Pinter via Days Of Our Lives and the shifting timeframe is pure 2001--there's even the same kind of Louis XVI furniture and bits of a very popular Kubrick horror score.    Rating:  Inland Empire is not Lynch's best film.  It suffers from a lack of editorial control and is at times sloppy and self-indulgent.  In a similarly negative vein, the entire project wobbles dangerously close to being weird and difficult just for the sake of it.  As Lynch had already done this with his clunker Lost Highway, the hope was that he'd learned his lesson.  IMO at least the Straight Story and Mulholland Drive seemed to show that he'd regained the disciplined mind of an artist and not that of an over coddledego let loose to create a mess.  Plus there is quite a bit of Transcendental Meditation in here, and despite what Lynch says he is fronting for a cult.    The plus sides, however, are thoroughly rewarding and Inland Empire should not be missed.  For three solid hours it plays as one of the most disorientating, hallucinogenic experiences that you'll ever see.  It's so honestly mentally invasive that you'll end-up dreaming sections of it...I just hope they're the pleasant ones.  I never want to relive that endless house again.  Nor do I want to cross the backdrop of an empty soundstage while ripping the sheets off my bed looking for an exit.           In summary:  If Lynch has decided to go hell-for-leather after his own brand of weird visions then good for him--even if it turns out to be a mistake and his career closes with Lost Highway 10.  If that's what he finally shuffles away with then I'll still respect the man as he's earned my loyalty.    My only concern is the inclusion of  increasing references to TM in Lynch's work, as it has the kind of dark reputation which befits its brand of pseudo-scientific nonsense.  My advice is to take a meme inoculation before accepting Lynch's PR role and look instead to his artistic foundations.  You probably came for those anyway, and not for some deluded sales pitch on behalf of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

B000000WFZ|4.0|Probably most well-known as the composer of music for Sergio Leone's \\"spaghetti westerns\\", Ennio Morricone is a most prolific composer in many film and television genres. This happens to be one of my personal favorites of his -- mostly haunting or outré variations on a few simple themes utilizing orchestra, chorus, and several exotic solo instruments. This one seems to work well as \\"absolute music\\" and not just as background to filmed drama.
B000TGCR38|5.0|\\"The Black Book,\\" Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's newest feature film, and the first he's made after a six-year gap, is also the first he's made in his homeland since the 1970's.  And, surprise, surprise, it's proving every bit as controversial as his earlier works -- best known, \\"Robocop,\\" (1987), and \\"Total Recall,\\" (1990), both criticized for excessive violence.  And \\"Basic Instinct,\\"(1992), criticized for excessive violence and prurience.<br /><br />Verhoeven, working with his frequent collaborator on Dutch films, Gerard Soeteman, is said to have begun writing \\"Black Book\\" in the 1980's.  He wanted to salute the heroism of those in the Dutch wartime resistance, and Holland's Jews; this he surely did.  He also produced a taut and suspenseful spy thriller, set on the large, color-filled, canvas of his wartime homeland.<br /><br />After an odd flashback-and-frame opening, the film gives us Rachel Stein (in an outstanding performance by Carice van Houten.)  She's a beautiful, smart Jewish woman, resolute and resourceful, agile in mind and body.  She's waiting for the war's end, everyone is; they all know it's coming.  But before the great day, Allied bombers hit her refuge.  She decides to move on to liberated Belgium, visits the lawyer who's holding her family's assets, and discovers to her amazed joy that her family still survive.  But not for long, unfortunately; the boat on which they set sail to freedom has evidently been betrayed to the Germans, and everyone aboard, excepting her, is murdered, stripped of their assets.  To revenge her family, Rachel finds her way to the resistance, where she will become blonde spy Ellis de Vries, and will be set to penetrate local Gestapo headquarters by any means necessary.  Lucky for her, the local Gestapo comes in the good-looking guise of Captain Ludwig Muntze, (Sebastian Koch, good-looking playwright in the recent Oscar-winning German film, \\"The Lives of Others.\\")  These two will soon surprise themselves by developing feelings for each other that may well fatally complicate their lives.<br /><br />Some of us could live without the flashback and frame device.  But we must be grateful that the writer-director does not choose to enumerate, one more time, the pettier harassments visited on the Jews before the Germans got really serious.  As to the usual charges: you try making a war movie without scenes of violence.<br /><br />Prurience?  It's been said that Verhoeven demands his actresses give their all-- you could check it out with Sharon Stone, star of his \\"Total Recall,\\" and \\"Basic Instinct.\\" However, as to one of the scenes in this movie that upsets the morals monitors, Verhoeven surely didn't invent the concept that collar and cuffs should match.  Ellis tells Muntze that, before the War, she was a Berlin cabaret artist.  Remember the band of blonde showgirls that backed Sally Bowles (Liza Minelli) in \\"Cabaret?\\"  They undoubtedly matched their collars and cuffs.  This world of the Berlin cabaret before the war-- between World Wars I and II, in fact, was the world in which Ellis sung.  That period is known by historians as the Weimar Republic, and the Nazis got their start running against its supposed decadence.<br /><br />There's another fairly upsetting scene in \\"Black Book, \\" where it appears that Ellis's friend Ronnie is sexually egging the German troops on, and will earn herself a very unpleasant night for her efforts.  But, by giving her all, she's creating a distraction that will enable Ellis and Muntze to make a getaway. Be that as it may, Van Houten, who is currently playing a major supporting role in GAME OF THRONES, has surely indicated once again that she doesn't mind giving the camera her all.<br /><br />The Dutch have a reputation in Europe for being down and dirty.  Verhoeven has previously said that they have always been more scientific, interested in detail; certainly less idealistic and more realistic than others.  He added that, if you went back to Holland's art scene 400 years ago, the Dutch were known for their realism even then.  He cites \\"Prodigal Son,\\" a painting by the Dutch master Hieronymus Bosch, who is known for filling his large canvases, corner to corner, with some pretty colorful, outlandish stuff.  At any rate, \\"Prodigal Son\\" shows a drunken man relieving himself against a brothel wall.  Bear that in mind, please.cene 400 years ago, the Dutch were known for their realism even then.

0307346609|5.0|This was a GREAT book. I'm actually not into zombie movies or books, because, well, they scare me. But I do love I do love post-apoc stories so I thought I would try it.<br /><br />This book was so intelligently written I couldn't put it down. It was very well thought out; he did a great job of creating scenarios that were completely believable and interesting, while still being super creepy. I had nightmares the whole time I read it - and it was worth it! Along with him totally selling the whole scenario (which is no easy feat - but he makes it work) the human element is what kept me reading, his take on how humankind might react seemed very plausible and compelling. I was actually bummed when I got to the end, I wanted more!

A truly enlightening memoir.
B000VI04HK|5.0|R.E.M. has moved from its so called alternative roots, to become the single best rock n roll band in America. Silly classifications aside, they have not changed so much as their audience has. Perhaps they are part to blame for 'us' growing to love them for what they say, as well as how they sound. I have had the Rapid Eye Movement albums in constant spin for the past week or so... I have never enjoyed them so much, from first to last, each album is in its own way is a wonder for the senses. If you don't get it (or them) you are missing out on one of the real treats in life.  The aural delight of a band that does not 'beat' the instruments into senseless noise, nor Mr. Stripe's voice, is to be savored.<br /><br />There are wondrous layers and textures in R.E.M.'s music, boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes if you will. The more you listen, the more you hear... They have stood the test of time, their music has weathered well. They survived success and remained real people. I have enjoyed my first spin of this new work and find it to be worthy of those whom created it. Fault is not hard to find, nor does finding same make one an 'expert?' Dear, me if you found a lyric or sound level to be a tad 'off' in a live album, get a life. Listen to the music, enjoy the unprovoked tingle of the body and smile it brings to ones face.<br /><br />There is just not enough of R.E.M. to go around. Grab all you can and hold on to it. They are the best band in America. Period.

Even like some of the albums many others don't, like Tom Joad, Human Touch, Devils & Dust, etc.  I'd never give any of his other albums fewer than 3 stars, and some are of course astounding 5-star classics (my fave is The Wild, the Innocent...).    But I REALLY dislike The Rising, I just find it extremely boring musically.    Basic hooks, repeated over and over.  I'm all for lyrics, but first the music has to be interesting.  There are a few good songs here, most notably Worlds Apart, but mostly they are just boring.  Even the basic poppy songs on Born in the USA were much more advanced than this.

B0000BWVCM|4.0|Bryan Singer's X2 is the rarest of sequels. It manages to be better than the original. This is the movie that comic fans were waiting for. It has action, a message, and a story line that does its best not to insult movie goer's intellegence.    The film starts shortly after the battle between the X-Men and the Brotherhood that ended the first film. There has been an attempt on the life of the President of the United States by a strange mutant who teleports. The mutant is the Amazing Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) and he is seemingly under someone's control. The person in control is William Stryker (Brian Cox) who adds another layer to the already complex mix of characters. Stryker is a human who wants to eliminate the mutants and is not above kidnapping Xavier to do it.    This film has elements of action, revenge, comedy and even an unresolved love triange. It's impossible to go into much detail without destroying the fun. This is one of the few big budget blockbusters that should be seen. It's a great second feature in a developing franchise that promises much more in the future.    The disc that I viewed included two commentary tracks: one with Singer and cinematographer Tom Sigel; the second with the producers and writers. Both tracks were informative and aid greatly in ones understanding both of the comic universe created and the production in particular. A second disc provides hours of extra features on just about all aspects of the production and should serve as a standard on features of this type.    See this one it is worth it.
B000UOOT1W|3.0|It is true that this Best Of... disc covers Santana's entire career, and it DOES cover Santana's music on Columbia and Arista, but don't be fooled by those ideas.  It is VERY loaded with more recent Santana hits, with a few of his more classic songs thrown in for good measure.    Most of the songs are from the Supernatural era and beyond (1999-), so you are missing a great, great chunk of Santana's 60's - 80's music.  For most of Santana's relatively new fans, this is a fine compliation of pop hits.  More serious/long-term fans are probably better suited to hold onto their previously bought (one of many) compilation CDs.    The ULTIMATE collection?  This is not.  Santana needs a substantial double-CD covering everything: the 60's and 70's latin soul jams, the 80's pop stuff (yes, including \\"Winning\\"), while still including the Arista years.  Wait for it.    All things considered, this is a fine compilation.  The mastering is very clean and dynamic--it does sound great.  Unfortunately, the track selection just misses the mark...
B000ICLRIE|5.0|This movie was butchered in the theatrical release, but this director's cut is 5 stars. For all the praise Gladiator got, there is much more to KOH. It's not as in your face as Gladiator, but from the script by Monahan it is a much more emotional film. Orlando Bloom's, Bailian, is a very conflicted and complex character throughout. While many male leads would have gone over the top with this role, Orlando gives a very understated performance, that makes it seem all more real.        This Blu-ray transfer is pretty flawless as well, complete with a lossless audio track.
B000UNYJV8|4.0|\\"This is England\\" is a riveting story about a lonely young boy who lost his father in the Falkland War and who turns to a group of young \\"skinheads\\" for kicks and friendship.  All of the kids are tough troublemakers who get the kid, Shaun, involved in activities that no twelve year old should be involved in, but they are depicted as mainly a good group of kids, who don't have much besides each other and so really care about each other.  They are into music and drinking and the occasional \\"spliff\\" but aren't haters and don't like violence.  That is, until  the return of an old friend who spent three years in prison and acquired a violent and totalitarian and racist streak, and tries to recruit the \\"gang\\" for his own \\"political\\" activities.  Shaun, who is apparently based on the director's own past, has to make a choice, and the film is about how that choice will profoundly affect his young life.  The film also draws an ironic connection between the colonialist activities of England overseas and the xenophobic and nationalistic tendencies of the homegrown skinheads.  The music is perfect, and the film should be seen for the soundtrack alone; the filmmakers do a nice job tying the story to documentary footage from the era and seem to have created a spot on characterization of the period; the film is hard to watch, especially because everything that happens is happening to or is directly participated in by a twelve year old boy; and the language, while presumably authentic, is extremely harsh (both in the sense of its extraordinarily prolific usage of a word that begins with f, and in the sense of being hard for at least these ears to discern fully due to the heaviness of the regional accents).  Still, if you like your films to open you up to a different world, and to be honest in their depiction of that world whether it is comfortable or not, and if you appreciate thoughtful filmmakers who take risks and who push in small ways the envelope of commercial filmmaking, then this is definitely one to watch.en this is definitely one to watch.

Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. I wizzed through it so fast and since then I've been trying to find similar books that could keep my interest as well as this one has. I really compare every book I read to this one. I'm not saying it's a CLASSIC or anything like that, it's just the best book I've read so far. I tried another Jodi Piccoult book, Mercy, but got bored before I finished the first hundred pages.  I LOVED THIS BOOK! The action started right away and continued throughout the book.  If the plot sounds remotely interesting to you, I would definitely recommend giving it a shot.

B00006L83N|5.0|The genres of progressive metal and power metal can have certain pitfalls that many bands can't help but fall into. Many prog metal bands tend to be complex for the sake of complexity. Power metal bands too often spend much of their time mining the catalogs of Iron Maiden and Helloween instead of finding their own identities. Both genres can be quite incestuous and seem to be full of bands that are better at showing off their chops and putting on clinics than they are at writing compelling and original songs.<br /><br />Symphony X not only dodge those pitfalls, but they also fill them up with cement. Nowhere on this record will you find songs that gallop off into infinity like some tedious power-chord polka or become tangled in arrangements that were designed to confuse the casual listener. The Odyssey is this band's most astounding victory to date. One thing that instantly struck me about it was the anger and savagery that came through songs such as \\"Incantations Of the Apprentice,\\" \\"Wicked,\\" and my favorite track \\"King Of Terrors.\\" Unlike many of their peers, Symphony X appear to have found something to make their collective blood boil and have freshened their sound as a result. There are no wasted moments on The Odyssey. Even the epic title track manages to avoid padding and fluff to entertain throughout its entire twenty-four minutes.<br /><br />More than ever, Symphony X show that they are Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force as a democratic ensemble. Michael Romeo displays some of the most amazing feats of olympian metallic guitar agility I've heard this year as he fires off solos and riffs that bob, weave, dart, and dash like bolts of lightning. Russell Allen steps to the fore as one of metal's master thespians, channeling Ronnie James Dio, Warrel Dane, and even Steve Walsh whenever he needs them. Mike Lepond and Jason Rullo hold the entire ship together with beams of rhythmic strength and percussive might while wisps of Jon Lord, Rick Wakeman, and Keith Emerson emanate from the subtle keyboards of Michael Pinnella.<br /><br />In recent years I have grown weary of prog and power metal, but Symphony X have reawakened my passion for these corners of the metallic spectrum by intertwining them into one and composing songs within that framework that defy physics. I've been wondering if someone would come along and best Blind Guardian in 2002. Symphony X may have won this duel with elegant ferocity, mind-bending intelligence, frightening skill, and visionary imagination.subtle keyboards of Michael Pinnella.

B0001ZX4MK|5.0|Banco (del mutuo soccorso) is a wonderful prog band and along with groups including PFM and Osanna certainly represent the high point of the Italian prog scene.  Although sounding a lot like the debut (1972), Darwin! (also 1972) shows a bit more development, which would come to full fruition with the excellent Io sono nato libero (1973).  On the whole, this is especially fine progressive rock.<br /><br />The lineup on the album includes the remarkable, operatically trained vocalist Francesco di Giacomo; Vittorio Nocenzi (Hammond organ, synthesizers, and clavinet); Gianni Nocenzi (acoustic piano and clarinet); Renato D'Angelo (Fender electric bass guitar; and acoustic bass); Pier Luigi Calderoni (drums and tympani); and acoustic/electric guitarist Marcello Todaro.  These guys are all excellent musicians and there is some ensemble work of breathtaking complexity on the album.  A big part of the general Banco sound however, is the keyboard work of the Nocenzi brothers - especially the Hammond organ, which ranges in texture from a majestic, \\"churchy\\" sound to a somewhat dirtier and overdriven sound.  Synthesizers also make a dramatic appearance on this album and the tone colors are very warm and organic sounding (it sounds a lot like a mini-moog synthesizer although I may be wrong).  I am a huge fan of Francesco di Giacomo and his vocal approach (vocals in Italian) - in fact, I could not imagine these compositions without his superb vocal technique.  My only wish is that there was more of a guitar presence - Marcelo is an excellent player.<br /><br />The seven tracks on the album range in length from 3:42 to the 13:59 opening suite L'Evoluzione and are linked somewhat by instrumental passages and most importantly mood.  The arrangements are really interesting too and use different instruments very effectively.  In large part, there are some absolutely frenetic prog rave ups, with manic, tortured sounds on the synthesizer and more delicate, melodic passages with impassioned vocals.  However, the band does not predictably alter between these dynamics, but rather work along the whole continuum from loud to soft.  In general, there is a lot going on in each piece.  Then there is also the occasional use of other musical styles including subtly European avant-garde passages and a smidge of east coast American (hot) jazz.  However, they skillfully weave these styles into the dominant style (classic English progressive rock) so that you do not notice them (it is a fusion rather than a patchwork quilt of sounds).  I especially appreciate their willingness to explore with these other musical styles; it gives their music a distinctive sound. It is worth pointing out that Vittorio wrote all of the music.<br /><br />This remastered album was released as part of Strange Days Italian Rock series paper sleeve collection and is a bit expensive, but definitely worth it.  The package reproduces the original LP format and, unfortunately, the somewhat \\"thin\\" sound of the original production.  There are liner notes in Japanese and the original Italian lyrics are also reproduced on the inner record (CD) sleeve.<br /><br />All in all, this is an exceptional album of progressive rock and is very highly recommended along with the eponymous debut, Io sono nato libero, the compilation entitled Banco (1975); and Come in un'ultima cena (1976).ned vocals.

I myself know nothing about economics, but I'm learning fast, and with new interest, and a great deal of that is due to this book.  I really cannot recommend this highly enough - a compelling, fascinating tightly researched work that reds like a thriller - and this one's in real time.  Outstanding work.
B000086EOB|4.0|Before the term \\"Hair Metal\\" was coined, and a billion bands came along during the late 80's and really ruined the metal scene (that become a joke) there were solid west coast metal bands such as Motley Crue (pre Theater of Pain) and Ratt, but a band that seems to get lost in the shuffle is WASP. Wasp had a certain rawness to them, that put them over the edge of other bands of the time. Not as heavy as early Metallica, nor did they have the thrash/black/death or whatever you wanted to call Early Celtic Frost,Venom, and Kreator, yet they did have a really heavy sound generated by the guitar playing of Chris Holmes, and Blackie Lawless was the mastermind of the sleezy lyrics. \\"The last Command\\" is my favorite WASP album, and its a bit stronger then the debut. Sadly the bad would only make one more Great album, which was \\"Inside the Electric Circus\\" and the  average \\"The headless children\\" and then  they would fade into obscurity only to reincarate themselves with a batch of piss poor albums. This one is the best of the bunch and is a headbangers delight no matter what kind of \\"Metal\\" you like

B00011RPB0|4.0|Sofia Coppola's seond feature Lost in Translation is an audacious filmmaking project.  I found to be really enjoyable, thought provoking, and well acted.  Bill Murray pulls out one of his best performances in years, although he hasn't necessarily fallen off.    Two strangers in Japan going through the motions until a chance meeting sparks their livelihood.    I encourage you to see this movie.  It's what great filmmaking is all about.    The DVD features a making of featurette, a few deleted scenes, and a conversation with Coppola and Murray.    Highly recommended.
B000FZETKC|5.0|I have a step-daughter who was born in the 90's and sharing this teen movie from the 80's has been so much fun! We both enjoyed watching this one~ the plot and storyline COULD seem outdated in the year 2007, but the teenage angst rings so true. Great movie!
B00005YJMX|3.0|A visually compelling and idealogically fascianting film, Herzog's inernationally acclaimed version of NOSFERATU doesn't measure up to F.W. Murnau's silent-era orginal.  Herzog's Dracula (as performed by actor Klaus Kinski) is a reluctant angel of death, consumed more by unrequitted love and melancholy than bloodlust.   Though Kinski certainly looks scary thanks to a fine make-up job, he rarely manages to infuse his role with any real menace.  Even when he pays an uninvited visit to Lucy (Isabelle Adjani), Dracula fails to impress either the viewer or his intended victim and must slink away like a whipped dog.  As the heroine, the aforementioned Adjani is beautiful but cold, much like the relationship between she and her husband Jonathon (played by Bruno Ganz).  In Murnau's original, the young couple were clearly passionately in love with one another; Herzog takes that passion away from his characters, and as a result the viewer never feels the empathy with them that the original generates (particularly for Lucy).  Herzog's Van Helsing is weak and ineffectual, and like all the other characters never establishes any sort of rapport with the viewer.  The role of Renfield is played for camp and falls flat, jarring terribly with the sombre, even dreary tone of the rest of the film.  Though it is interesting to compare Herzog's version with Murnau's, Herzog has not given us a very powerful film. It is as though he purposely wants to keep the audience at arms-lenth, and at no point in the story is there any on-screen energy.  Cinematography is excellent, however, and Herzog's NOSFERATU could certainly never be criticized for being overly violent or gory, as there is virtually none of either.  Unfortunately, neither is there any supsense or character empathy--deadly to a story that is inherently character-driven.  Ultimately there is no reason for a fan of the original to watch the remake, save for curiosity's sake.
0393061310|5.0|I believe Guns, Germs and Steel is one of the more important books written in the last 25 years. Combinging anthropology, geography and linguistics, Diamond fashions an interesting and often compelling argument as to why civilizations developed where and when they did. Although a number of scientists have criticized a number of Diamond's conclusions, one thing cannot be denied: Diamond recast the debate about differences in cultures and civilizations, moving it away from race-based inquiries into a more logical,constructive, and empirically based dialogue.  Moreover, he did so by posing a question brilliant in its simplicity: why was it that the Spaniards sailed across the Atlantic and conqured the Aztecs?  Why didn't the Aztecs sail across the Atlantic and conquer Spain?  Think about it.  Then read the book.
B00005R87K|5.0|F.W. Murnau's silent-era adaptation of Dracula was the first movie version of Bram Stoker's classic tale; unfortunately, it was unauthorized, and Stoker's widow successfully sued to wipe NOSFERATU from the face of the earth.  But vampires are hard to put down, and in true Dracula fashion NOSFERATU rose from the grave to assert its rightful station amidst the classics of cinema.  Decades later, NOSFERATU continues to entertain and frighten lovers of classic cinema everywhere.  Even today, after dozens of Dracula adaptations ranging from the excellent to the ridiculous, including a famous but disappointing remake from Werner Herzog, NOSFERATU remains one the three greatest Dracula films ever produced, rivalled only by Universal's DRACULA (featuring Bela Lugosi) and Hammer Film's HORROR OF DRACULA (starring Christopher Lee).  And lest we forget, NOSFERATU was the inspiration for the critically acclaimed SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE, a fine movie in its own right.<br /><br />What makes NOSFERATU so great?  Above all else, it's hard not mention Max Schreck's unearthly performance as the eponymous vampire, Dracula himself.  Schreck's Dracula is no urbane playboy; rather, a ghastly goblin who remorselessly preys upon the young and brings the plague with him.  Schreck's bald, ratlike visage grows ever more monstrous as the story progresses, and if it cannot necessarily be said that his intepretation of Dracula is actually better than Lugosi's or Lee's, it is certainly scarier--indeed, Schreck's Dracula is the most truly terrifying vampire of them all, and for that matter much more like the depictions of vampires in traditional folklore.  Greta Schroeder likewise brings a full-blooded heroine to life in her portrayal of the benighted Nina, whose innate righteousness and love for her husband give her the strength to make the ultimate sacrifice.  But Murnau's personal vision and directorial flair cannot be ignored--the cinematography is oustanding, even by modern standards, and Murnau's shots of fay-haunted woodlands, sweeping mountaintops and gothic castles are both beautiful and eerie.  Murnau creates a waking nightmare, one which is brought to a head in one of the most powerful climaxes in cinema.<br /><br />What a shame that most contemporary movie lovers--particularly horror fans--won't give a film from the silent era a chance.  Doubtless Herzog's color-and-sound version from the 1970s is more likely what a modern movie-lover would choose to watch, simply becase it's newer.  But make no mistake:  Murnau's original is superior in every way.<br /><br />NOTE:  This review is for the Alpha Video DVD.  Though DVD's from Alpha are of variable quality, NOSFERATU is of generally good video quality, at least for a film that is so old, except for a few frames near the end (thankfully after the climax) which momentarily freeze up.ots of fay-haunted woodlands, sweeping mountaintops and gothic castles are both beautiful and eerie.

B000K4WPCC|5.0|Heterosexual director Renny (DIE HARD 2, DEEP BLUE SEA) Harlin has inexplicably slipped over to the other side with his boy-band-of-witches saga, THE COVENANT. He has taken a bunch of Aberzombies, put them in some sort of prep school and given them supernatural powers, forced them to join the swim team, and thrown a few disposable girls in for good measure. And at no point does the plot of the film or the acting interfere with the camera's view of said Aberzombies' abs.<br /><br />This tale of the \\"Sons of Ipswitch\\", the gifted descendants of the founding fathers of Salem, moves along fairly briskly, with some decent effects and fun stunt work, but first and foremost, the real object of the film is to linger lasciviously upon the admirable assets of young, unironically-named Steven Strait. Seriously - the witchcraft, spiders, explosions, raves, and everything else take humble second-stage to loving shots of Strait rocking a tanktop, Strait rocking a tight v-neck t-shirt, Strait wearing a Speedo. We haven't seen male body-worship on this scale since Ryan Reynolds battled evil spirits that threatened to keep him wet and shirtless for Amityville Horror's entire running time.<br /><br />Strait plays Caleb, a member of an elite band of underwear models who have gone undercover as witches at a prep school in Massachusetts. (You know, so as not to attract attention). Aside from Caleb, there's the long-haired one, the blonde one, and another one who evades description entirely, to the point that it's impossible to identify him in any group scenes. The Metrosexual trickle-down has apparently left our high schools populated by an army of pomade-enhanced, cap-sleeved man-boys who are so self-approvingly pretty that the girls in their lives can do very little to distract them from their vaguely homoerotic navel-gazing. (Whereas DAZED & CONFUSED presented teen angst in a haze of pot smoke, here it is clouded by an overabundance of Axe Body Spray.)<br /><br />The plot of the film was summed up well enough in the commercials (and is ultimately too mind-numbingly simplistic to get into)  --  the important thing is that in this teen witch story, the witches are the popular kids. Rather than your typical \\"supernaturally enhanced underdog\\" story (CARRIE, THE CRAFT ), here we watch four rich, white boys who clearly dominate their school and also happen to enjoy a gift that allows them to perform magic. But, watching these kids get everything they want is not nearly as compelling as watching someone who actually NEEDS this power to get back at their enemies or overturn the status quo.<br /><br />The overwhelming homoeroticism of THE COVENANT includes a scene where Caleb and his best bud Pogue are talking on the phone, and both are shirtless, lying in bed, and drenched with sweat. We seriously expected the words \\"MEET LOCAL GUYS!\\" to flash across the top of the screen. There's also some locker room action featuring buns galore and a gay-baiting incident where another young man gets called a \\"fag\\" by a different long-haired boy (seriously, it's so hard to tell these guys apart...) and the young man beats his tormenter down - without actually denying the accusation. (Interestingly enough, he even makes reference to looking at the kid's manhood.) At another point an evil Aberzombie pins Caleb to the floor and kisses him on the face roughly -- In a FEAR NO EVIL kind of way, only with far more attractive men involved.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a satisfying all-male companion piece to the excellent teen-witch thriller THE CRAFT, keep waiting. This isn't it... If - however - you are looking for a warm-up to wet your guests appetites as they arrive for All-Male Porno night, look no further - Renny Harlin has done an admirable job.ugh in the commercials (and is ultimately too mind-numbingly simplistic to get into)  --  the important thing is that in this teen witch story, the witches are the popular kids.

B000GY729M|5.0|I don't know about anybody else, but as a guy who grew up during the late 70's and into the 80's, I really have to say the the '90's were an absolute cultural vacuum, especially with all the bland, depressing sounding alternative rock groups that all sounded completely the same.  (Not to mention the horrific gangsta rap crap that invaded the airwaves of the 90's as well as all the movies with their down and out depressing \\"Forest Gump\\"-type endings.)  Ah, but here we are now in the mid 2000's and I can honestly say that things on both the music and the movies front have seem to taken a turn for the better--MUCH better.  This is clearly demostrated with bands like The Killers, who, with their upbeat hard rock mixed with synth pop, have, (gasp, shock, horror!)  resurrected the seemingly long-dead notion of raw talent with music that makes you want to dance the night away!  (You mean to tell me its not a SIN to love great music and be HAPPY for a change?)     Give this album a few spins and enjoy great music!  A notion that seemed to had vacated this planet during the 90's and early 2000's.    Thanks to glamorous indie rock and roll for saving us from the depressing, dismal abyss of the no-talent 90's.

B000063COX|4.0|In 1980 Iron Maiden released their self-titled debut album, starting what would become a legendary career for the band. They were one of many promising bands in the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement at the time; and still some development away from being the leader of the pack. However, some historic record covers soon made them quite famous, giving the band invaluable PR at the start of their career.    Musically, Iron Maiden's debut album is an inconsistent affair. They try out a number of different styles, and it is obvious that they are uncertain of what type of music that really suits them at this point. The guitar riffs used in most tracks obviously have been somewhat influenced by the punk movement; and in tracks like \\"The Prowler\\" punk inspired riffs are used extensively, played in a fast and simple fashion. The overall sound also indicates the influence from 70's hard rock though, and the track has a surprisingly light pop feel about it.    Tracks like \\"Remember Tomorrow\\" and \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" showcase Iron Maiden's progressive influences; and the latter track also showcases some of the styles Iron Maiden would pursue later in their career, especially the \\"epic\\" chomping guitar riffing underscored by bass that the group would utilize in many future long songs.    Strange World is the odd one out on the album; one of the few mellow tracks ever made by the band. The slight psychedelic touch and the detailed moods made in this track are unique in the history of Iron Maiden; and tracks like this one probably was abandoned when the band started figuring out where to go musically.    The rest of the tracks here are to a greater or lesser degree mostly fast paced hard rock tunes with some metal edges to them; relatively simple in structure and style. There are quite a few differences in detail on the tracks; but all of them share some basic facts - punk-inspired riffs, influences from 70's hard rock to a greater or lesser degree, and high on intensity.There are quite a few standout tracks on this album; and all of the songs here are seen as classic Iron Maiden tracks, apart from the mellow \\"Strange World\\". Not all of the tracks are at their best here though; the band was young and inexperienced when this album was recorded, which is easily heard. In many instances the later live recordings of the tracks here are much better than the original recordings; and as the overall sound here is much unlike what Iron Maiden would sound like later, this is not a release that can be seen as a must buy. Indeed, fans that haven't heard this album previously will be rather surprised on first listen.    Still, it's a good release as long as you're able to live with it's various shortcomings; and a must buy for anyone that wants to find out more about Iron Maiden's musical background and inspirations.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|First off, let me start be saying that I never found Jessica Biel to be attractive during her Seventh Heaven years. Boy, was I wrong! What was I thinking? She's quite striking!  Anyhow, on to the flick. Concerning what another reviewer said about Nicolas Cage's recent failures--alluding to Lord Of War, Weatherman, and this movie.  WRONG! Weatherman was a bit on the boring side...true, Lord Of War could have been worlds better...granted, but Next does not belong in that list. This movie is entertaining and enlightening from the start. The reason for four stars instead of five though is this:    SPOILER AHEAD!    There was absolutely no reason to go through 50% of the film in a vision of the future only to have Jessica Biel's character taken out of the equation altogether. With that occurrence, the only recovery would be a sequel. So bring on the next Next!    This movie is a must-see!
B00000889Y|3.0|US based rock band The Cramps were officially formed in 1976, and have most of the time been an underground band. They still have a cult following, and are still active after more than 30 years. Off the Bone is a compilation of early singles, b-sides and obscurities first released in 1983.    Musically the band's major influences are from old rock music; rockabilly and fifties rock 'n roll especially. The bands take on that musical style is to twist it into something else - at best they create dark and twisted rockabilly and rock 'n roll mutations sounding like an Elvis impersonator from the deepest pits of hell, at worst their music sounds like punk influenced noise made by young teenagers in the garage. The vocals are often whacky and off beat; with more or less effective vocal fooling around instead of singing.    The songs on this record is a collection of bits and pieces; and it shows. Some of the tracks are superbly done, while others leave you with the question \\"Why was this ever recorded?\\". But getting this album is an easy way to get all of the early singles from the group; and for the tracks that aren't really good there's always a skip button.    Recommended for people that would like to explore the earliest music from these rockabilly punk veterans.

B000VDDDY6|4.0|I'm not happy about the outrageous price, or the decision to make combo discs (I'm staying with standard DVD until one format or the other wins out). For that reason, I'm holding off on this until the price comes way down (or perhaps I'll find them used somewhere).     But what I really want to talk about is the new special effects. Personally, I've really enjoyed them! I'm sorry, but for years we've had to watch those god-awful shots of the Enterprise where the nacelle on the left side looks like it's disintegrating. It's awful, and it's always looked awful. Sometimes you'd also get dumb mistakes like a planet being one color, and a few seconds later that same planet would suddenly be an entirely different color (see \\"Let That Be Your Last Battlefield\\")! Most everything else, effects-wise, looks dated and cheesy but I won't criticize too much on what the creators had available in those days... It was what it was.    Anyhow, while a few of the new effects fall flat, most of them look beautiful. There's lots of great shots and angles of the Enterprise, and other ships, moving in ways we couldn't have seen them doing 40 years ago. I also really like the new looks for both the planets and outdoor backgrounds. Much more realistic, and some of them are just stunning. Anyone catch the new \\"Amok Time\\" on TV? Those shots of Vulcan (with Kirk & Co. in the distance, walking to Mt. Selaya) are outstanding. If anything, I feel like the people creating the new effects haven't done enough! I'd have gone to the trouble of doing more fixes. The cruddy map of the Romulan Star Empire in \\"Balance of Terror,\\" for instance, could sure use replacing. I wouldn't be against having new, CGI versions of the Gorn, Mugato and Horta either. I'm sure others will disagree though.       Really, this is nothing like George Lucas' tampering with Star Wars. There, Lucas was making wholesale changes -- some that even altered the story -- for specious reasons. In the case of Trek, nothing being done ischanging the plots in any way, and it's all being pretty tastefully done. There's no excessive business going on in the backgrounds to distract the viewer. The same cannot be said about Star Wars.     Besides, after seeing the same epiosdes dozens of times I got tired of them. Many of the plots just don't hold up anymore (although some of them remain as strong as ever), and no matter how much some may love the show the originals really do look pretty hokey these days. Actually, it looked pretty hokey to me 25 years ago as a kid, but that's not the point. The newly remastered episodes have renewed my interest in this show. That's a good thing, since I haven't been terribly interested in any Star Trek since (the seriously underrated) DS9 ended its run eight years ago.     It might help create a new generation of fans. That's also a good thing, since this messed up world or ours could use more Trek's IDIC philosophy right about now. Let kids learn about the REAL Star Trek, not that abomination (or so it appears) headed for movie screens Christmas of 2008.

B000V8I2QU|2.0|Read all these 5-star reviews with caution; Springsteen's latest just isn't all that good, despite the wishful thinking and irrational exuberance of his faithful throng.    There are a handful of decent songs here (Long Walk Home and the Devil's Arcade stand out).  But after two exploratory and brilliant CDs (Devils & Dust, The Seeger Sessions), Springsteen seems to have come home worn out and bored.  It's not just that he falls back on a formula now more than 20 years old; on Magic the writing, performances and production are all half-hearted.    There's nothing like Springsteen performing live with his E Street Band, and I suspect even these songs will gain new life in the stadium.  Back in the studio, though, it seems this team may have lost its magic.

B000VSYDRM|4.0|Well, I really was just bowled over by this movie. And for the record I give it 4 1/2 stars, with a half star being deducted for the uncharacteristically poor performance from Dustin Hoffman who was really just miscast.     First of all, the cinematography. This movie is so unbelievably lush, you just sit and watch the colors and sounds cascade across the scene, in almost erotic vibrancy. I definately recommend watching this on a big high def system if its available. The reason for this is that the entire movie is about smells, which is rather hard to convey via our current AV technology. However with just a smidgeon of imagination you can almost catch the odeous odiferousness of the putrid stink of the streets of Paris, or the heavenly inebrient of the lavender fields surrounding Gras, filmed in the beyond idyllic location of Provence.     The opening scenes of the absolute, utter, completely wretched, squalor of Paris is enough to send some running for a bucket, however their vomit would only further serve as a testament to the power of this film's images.    Secondly the messages behind the movie, are some of the most provocative in any debate arsenal, and ones which there really will never be an answer to. I speak of the debate on judging the work and not the artist. Now of course most people will say that they will judge art without bias in concern to the man/woman who created it. However, when we are presented with the almost sociopathic actions of the main Jean-Baptiste the Super Smeller in Perfume, this becomes a task easier said than down. I mean, could people really sympathize with Beethoven's music, claiming it as potentially the greatest ever written, if they knew he was a pedophile (he wasn't to the best of my knowledge, but for the sake of argument...he was).     Also it is shown that Jean-Baptiste could create purfumes of stunning quality using the already practiced and un-harmful methods already in use, and yet still he strives to create a scent which to smell is to know the face of God. What if there was a tenth symphony for Beethoven to write that if heard would immediately induce absolute nirvana upon the hearer and forever after all other music would sound as nails on a chalkboard. Of course many would want to listen to it, however would so many be clamoring for Ludwig to compose the jaw dropping mind melting 10th if he had to kill, say twenty people to complete it. This is of course completely ridiculous, however Perfume, is a fantasy story, as one learns by the end, and for the sake of argument, this is the argumen that the viewer must decide on.     Needless to say, these are some of the more challenging arguments for people to cope with, and Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, presents such heavy themes with beautiful, (sometimes heartwrenchingly so) scenes, as well as excellent performances from most of the cast, especially the lead, Ben Wishaw as well as Alan Rickman.    WATCH PERFUME, I, as only an unknown set of words and opinions can, assure you that you will not have seen another movie at all like Perfume, and if nothing else, seeing a movie that is not the same ol' crap with different actors, is enough of a reason to eagerly pop Perfume into your DVD tray.

B00001PE4D|4.0|Amazon has already provided the plot so I won't rehash the details here. The surprise is in the actors. When actors will be measured against Faye Dunaway, John Malkovich and Michelle Pfeiffer they better be pretty damn good. To my great shock Sarah Michelle Geller, Reese Witherspoon, and Ryan Phillipe prove up to the task. They may not be quite as interesting as the more sophisticated cast of the older movie but they are very, very impressive. Sarah Michelle Geller. in particular, is a revelation. I would not have believed that she could play a role this nuanced, and this unlikable, with complete conviction. But she succeeds totally as the serpentine enitity who encourages the corruption in everyone around her.  Witherspoon is the \\"good girl\\" but she is smart and strong and eventually turns the tables on the Geller character with grim determination.  Phillipe is surprisingly effect as the upperclass preppie romeo/who is a completely repulsive character until he finds redemption by revealing himself in all his  spiritual ugliness to the one he loves.  I think this movie was more interesting because I had seen the older film. I would  strongly suggest getting both to heighten your enjoyment of each version of the story.  Parenthetically, Geller was exceptionally alluring in this project, a quality that I never saw in her other work.
B000VD9MG4|5.0|From its inception, American horror has always had its roots firmly planted in foreign soil.  Silent German expressionistic chillers led the way for Universal Pictures' cinematic monsters of the 1930s, (Frankenstein, Dracula, the Werewolf of London, the Phantom of the Opera, the Hunchback, the gypsy werewolf that bites Larry Talbot, the Mummy) all of which were foreign born and reinforced the xenophobic and isolationist beliefs of Americans at the time.  The 1940s ushered in a wave of true-life European nightmares as American moviegoers viewed grainy newsreel footage of nazi concentration camps.  We collectively wondered, \\"How could a civilized society perpetrate such crimes against humanity?\\"  In the holocaust documentary film SHOAH we get the answer when a Polish villager of Treblinka was asked about the atrocities committed in the camps, he crudely conveys the notion that the victims are not worthy of contemplation because they are not us.  They are Jews.  Strangers.      Eli Roth's HOSTEL successfully exploits this formula and creates a horrorscape of a post-Soviet satellite country that's more terrifying than any cardboard Transylvanian graveyard.  Roth exposes the true nature of fear: to be a helpless stranger in a strange and dangerous land at the mercy of people who will only view you as \\"the other.\\"  This is the true power of this film, a force that will wreck havoc on your subconscious --- not a man tied to a chair.

B000FVQM2Y|4.0|Dubious of PK's choice of movie, I was surprised when Brick turned out to be one the best movies I've seen this year. Which, I guess, I should have known. As a fan of independent films, ones that are story and character driven, they are usually thousands of times better than half the films the major studios produce, even the ones they save for Oscar season.    This debut film from writer and director by Rian Johnson, is a stylized and clever film noir, where the teenaged cast speak in the jargon of the classic black & white films of the 1940's.    Levitt-Gordon plays Brendan, a teen who is an outsider who wants to be just that, with his floppy hair and round glasses, that makes him look like a cross between Harry Potter and Jared Padalecki from TV's Supernatural. When his ex-girl friend contacts him unexpectedly, sobbing about how she's screwed up every thing, and then disappears he becomes consumed with finding her.    But to do it, he must submerge himself within the dangerous drug culture of southern California. He contacts The Brain, his one and only peer, who can get him information on socialite girls, a dangerous thug named Tugger, a girl named Kara and school's quarterback Brad. In doing so, Brendan also comes into orbit of The Pin, a drug kingpin of the area.    And when Lukas Haas turns up late in the film, as the baroque Pin (looking much like Jonathan Frid from Dark Shadows fame) he steals the film.    At first, I found the florid dialogue a bit distracting, it reminded me of the updated Romeo and Juliet from a few years ago - set in present day, but using the Shakespearean talk. But after a while, the story sucked you in, along with Gordon-Levitt's and Haas performances.    A winner of a film.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|As a big Friends fan, I am truly delighted with the collection, especially the outtakes on specific discs.
0066620996|5.0|This well researched book provides the principles to enable good companies to become great.  The \\"first who, then what\\" concept contradicts the old \\"What first (Vision, mission, guiding principles, tactics, etc)\\". Having read [[ASIN:0471414646 Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self]], I am convinced that there is an additional step required to experience organizational optimization - execution based on Optimal Thinking by individuals, teams, departments and the entire organization. When we choose, attract and retain the best, we stop settling for second best (which could be great).  I recommend both books.
B00013RC9I|4.0|After 70 previous reviews, I was reluctant to add my 2 bobs worth, but, hey, why not? Better than Moon Safari for me, but both are enjoyable and worth buying. My girlfriend, who had never heard Air before, went into a bit of a trance when I played the disk in the car. Cherry Blossom Girl is delightful and the album is worth buying for that song alone. For lovers of synthesised sounds and daydreaming.
0061547832|5.0|Trump and Zanker give solid advice for the entrepreneur. In an era where many people still believe that wishful thinking will bring success, Donald shows you what it really takes.  Equipped with a Wharton School of Finance education, love of making a deal, he has mastered the art of branding. Donald believes you must love what you do if you want to make it. It would be hard to find someone with Donald's brilliance and charisma, so I thoroughly recommend this book along with two others.  [[ASIN:0471414646 Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self]] to optimize your thinking and [[ASIN:0671027034 How to Win Friends & Influence People]] to gain the skills to influence others.  Read all three books.
0446677450|5.0|While it is difficult to imagine what new commentary one could add to the thousands of reviews of this fine book, I thought it would be beneficial to point out a significant characteristic that seems rarely touched by others. Namely, the testimony-like nature of the message.    While there are many business and investment books on the market worth the time to read, few are as adept as Robert Kiyosaki (and his actual writer, Sharon Lechter) at contextualizing his instruction. By giving the reader a \\"this is what happened to me, and this is what I learned from the experience\\" message, the author is essentially giving his own personal narrative of his life's journey into his present understanding of business and investments. By so doing, he offers the reader insight into the WAY a person of his economic stature thinks...and more importantly, WHY.    The autobiographical nature of the text adds tremendous flavor to the message this best-selling book conveys. In my opinion, Rich Dad, Poor Dad is a remarkable book that anyone interested in business and/or investments should consider a \\"must read\\" in their studies.    Moreover, to truly garner the key nuggets of the author's revelation, one should also immediately read the sequel, [[ASIN:0446677477 Cashflow Quadrant: Rich Dad's Guide to Financial Freedom]]. Nearly twice as thick, this second text is truly the finishing touch on the original work.    In conclusion, the few negative reviews I have read of Rich Dad, Poor Dad seemed to be written by those who expected something different than what was intended by the author. By logical extension, it appears obvious that they failed to read the sequel so that they could truly conceptualize the appeal of the author's message...an appeal that has made this not only a best-seller, but a true legend in the business non-fiction genre.

B000OLGCI4|1.0|They cropped (or left out) the top and bottom of the picture to accommodate the new wide screen Tvs. Not good! This makes the earlier release on DVD an instant collectors item. It's a shame too because the rest of the restoration is beautiful. Walt Disney would be rolling over in his grave to see how they mangled one of his masterpieces. Give us the movie as it was originally intended please.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|The story begins in the 19th-century village of Wall. But Wall isn't your average country village -- it guards a low, stony wall between mundane England and the fantasy kingdom of Stormhold. No one crosses the wall -- except for young Drustan Thorn, whose curiosity led him to an otherworldly market and a single night of passion with a captive gypsy -- or princess -- and nine months later he was given a son, Tristan, who was left for him by the wall.<br /><br />Flash forward 18 years, and Tristan (Charlie Cox) hopes to win the heart of his beautiful but shallow love, Victoria (Sienna Miller), by recovering a star that fell somewhere beyond that wall. So Tristan sets forth on his own journey in Stormhold. Meanwhile in that magical land, the dying king (Peter O'Toole) has set his four surviving sons on a quest for the crown. And the witch Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) is seeking the heart of the star for an entirely different purpose, one that probably will not turn out well for anyone else involved in the story.<br /><br />Despite initial trepidations over seeing a favorite Neil Gaiman story converted to film, \\"Stardust\\" is all I could hope for. The settings and scenery are lush and beautiful. The effects are seamless and spectacular. The score by Ilan Eshkeri is dramatic. Narration by Ian McKellen is compelling. And the casting is exceptional, from Robert De Niro as the delightful sky pirate Captain Shakespeare to Pfeiffer as the sumptuously evil witch.<br /><br />Claire Danes is absolutely radiant as Yvaine, who in one way or another holds the resolution of every quest. Poised, beautiful and sporting a great English country accent, Danes glows even without the benefit of special effects. And Tristan Thorn is a classic everyman hero, a simple young man who grows and flourishes on his journey; Cox captures the role perfectly. A relative newcomer to the screen, he's without question an actor to watch.<br /><br />Gaiman is a brilliant writer, a man with an imagination like no other. Fortunately, director Matthew Vaughn bucked the Hollywood trend by respecting the source material, creating a splendid film, one that will surely become a classic for generations to come.<br /><br />by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(NET) editorMatthew Vaughn bucked the Hollywood trend by respecting the source material, creating a splendid film, one that will surely become a classic for generations to come.    by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(NET) editor
B000RZIGVS|5.0|If you're a die-hard Trekker like me who hasn't yet invested in the complete TNG, this set is truly a dream come true. The packaging is, yes, a little cheesy, but when you consider what you're getting here -- the entire series, all seven years, plus an exclusive bonus disc of special features in one relatively *small* bundle, it's a bargain and a half. The individual seasons were originally released at 60-70 bucks each, so for the complete series fans shelled out around $500, and for something that required an entire bookcase to display. This new set is compact, complete, contains additional special features and is comparatively CHEAP. Go for it!

0061547832|5.0|If you are a fan of Trump's like I am, this book is a must read.  I love motivational reading, and Trump's no-nonsense, no B.S. style is spot on.  Trump spells it out the way it is in REAL LIFE, how to deal with the sharks in the world of business (there are MANY) and how to be successful in business and in your personal life.      The biggest point I took from this book is to do what you love.  The money will follow.  At the end of each chapter are bullet points that reinforce and summarize the chapter.    Trump, thank you for releasing an EXCELLENT book without sugar coating or making it Politically Correct.  Right to the point, the way it should be.  This book will no doubt take my real estate business to the next level.
B0000026KQ|1.0|I was very disappointed with this CD. It is a commercial CD at best, in my opinion. With the big name musicians, and reputations to match, I was very disappointed. It is a CD that's geared to a classic-rock minded listener who thinks what you hear on the radio is all that exists. It's boring, and simple.

B000I2J0VA|5.0|It's about time WB finally are in talks about releasing the Exorcist on HD DVD. In my opinion it's considered the scariest movie of all time 33 years after it's initial release and can't wait until I have a copy of it. I hope that they would do like a double feature package the original on one side and the version you never seen before on the other. I hope the 25th anniversary piece is added too. I have not purchased a HD DVD but I can tell you this much as soon as this HD version pops up in stores I will buy the HD DVD and will enjoy a true horror classic.
B000063DFS|5.0|Ozzy delivers huge on this album with big hooks and awesome melodies it's no wonder he's one of the most celebrated men in rock history. Though I'm not sure he gets the respect he deserves. Hard rock and metal bands should be taking more notes from him rather than from idiots like Lamb of God, Pantera, or Tool. Need we forget that Ozzy's biggest influence is The Beatles, and he writes melodies that would make even Paul and John wet themselves!!!
B000VR824S|5.0|The strength of this 12-hour guitar festival taking place on a sweltering day in Chicago can not be visualized just by the immortal lineup. With such a talented group of shredders, everybody knew that it would be $90 well spent. What the audience did not know was that this concert would go down as one of the best, if not THE best, in post 60's and 70's history.    With godly performances from Clapton, Jeff Beck, Derek Trucks, Steve Winwood, Buddy Guy, and John Mayer, little was left to the imagination. The audience was screaming at times, and even crying at times. BB King made a very emotional appearance, even driving many to tears. TWO THUMBS WAY UP.    There were very few low points of this concert, but the best part is, I get to fast-forward through the dull parts.    I am pre-ordering this now.
B000089RV6|5.0|When you look up rock n roll in the dictionary it should say nothing more than AC/DC. Who knew that after the untimely death of origional frontman Bon Scott the band would celebrate their finest work to date!!! Very few bands have replaced a legenary lead singer and lived on to success but only AC/DC have done so and surpassed themselves. Brian Johnson takes over on lead vocals and takes to band to unsurmountable rock n roll status. Back in Black is filled with inuendo and sexual energy that would make even Steven Tyler proud. Well done boys!
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|Despite its ominously cheeky title, Annie Lennox's latest disc is not a political diatribe against the Bush administration, even though there are random references to a world suffering from its passive indifference and at least one song focused on the need for global human rights. Impeccably produced by veteran L.A.-based producer Glen Ballard (Alanis Morissette's [[ASIN:B000002MY3 Jagged Little Pill]] was his biggest success), the album chronicles a desultory state of personal affairs brought to life by Lennox's soulfully textured voice. The clearest examples are the somber opener, \\"Dark Road\\", and the aching ballad, \\"Smithereens\\", both of which reflect a gently soulful grit while showing off her accomplished vocal chops. With its chugging acoustic piano, \\"Love Is Blind\\" sounds almost like a Scissors Sisters cover, but it's really an angry declaration of independence disguised as a suicide note.<br /><br />Not all of the songs reflect expressions of soul-bearing emotional pain. The hard-driving \\"Ghosts in the Machine\\" sounds like late-80's Eurythmics with a breathless accordion propelling an insistent beat and Lennox exhibiting a swaggering new-Jill swing most welcome. Sassy with a funky Motown girl-group vibe, \\"Womankind\\" is hip-swinging feminist fun with a rap interlude from Nadriah X; and with its hazy synth-heavy sound, \\"Coloured Bedspread\\" is a complete throwback to early-MTV Eurythmics circa [[ASIN:B0000CFXNP Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)]]. On the other hand, \\"Big Sky\\" is a wailing soul shouter that Lennox handles with aplomb. And \\"Through the Glass Darkly\\", with its title a nod to Ingmar Bergman's classic film, is power pop at its most propulsive, while the otherworldly \\"Lost\\" has Lennox reciting a mournful elegy in inviting three-quarter time.<br /><br />The most talked-about track is the African-tinged \\"Sing\\". An all-female chorus of 23 stars (including Faith Hill, Bonnie Raitt, Dido, Sarah MacLachlan, Gladys Knight, Beth Orton, Celine Dion and a most discernible Madonna among many others) sings a gospel-fueled anthem which one can view as a more serious-minded sequel to Lennox's memorable duet with Aretha Franklin from over two decades back, \\"Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves\\". While nominally about female empowerment, the song really reflects Lennox's dedication to bringing global awareness to the HIV/AIDS crisis. The soaring piano ballad, \\"Fingernail Moon\\", makes an appropriate closer with its dynamic sense of isolation brought to life with an impeccable arrangement. For all its polished craftsmanship, the disc does not feel as bracingly refreshing as her first three solo efforts - [[ASIN:B000002VMH Diva]], [[ASIN:B000002VUC Medusa]] and [[ASIN:B000089RVU Bare]] - and while the song subjects reflect well-trodden themes, Lennox fans - including myself - will likely be more than satisfied by the end result.nna among many others) sings a gospel-fueled anthem which one can view as a more serious-minded sequel to Lennox's memorable duet with Aretha Franklin from over two decades back, \\"Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves\\".

B000BT97AO|5.0|Ok, I read all the other reviews here (over 130!) and noticed either Jubilant enthusiasm, or random distaste...  I wonder about that, because I thought the film was astounding.<br /><br />It is a coming of age (burgeoning adolescence) fantasy story and it has its predecessors (Wizard of Oz, Alice in Wonderland, etc.) but no one would say not to try telling that story again, because it is based on an archetypal tale of a characters search for themselves (mirror and mask are both powerful symbols for the search for the true self!)<br /><br />Some people said the visuals try to tell the story, and the plot is shallow because of it... Well, remember that Gaiman and McKean are coming from the world of graphic storytelling where visuals ALWAYS move the story along, with the writing assisting.  An example of this is shown where Helena looks at one of her drawings with fish all moving in one direction towards a center, and then turns around and tells Valentine they are going the right way... No explanation needed, the fish are indeed floating by them in one direction as she is talking.<br /><br />Other people (who didnt like the film) felt that the Jim Henson studios should be ashamed to have been a part of this after producing The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth.  My response to that is why?  This is yet another fantasy story told with extreme care and the talent is extraordinary, and I would argue that this film is above the quality of those films, albeit with a different artistic guiding hand (the beautifully surreal Dave Mckean).<br /><br />I also didnt see much talk of the music and sound effects of the film in the other reviews...  The music was really excellent, and the sound effects were equally so...  There are some amazing soundscapes throughout the dream sequences...<br /><br />Without going into any more plot points, I wanted to say I agreed with the reviewer who said the dream logic of the film was necessary since we were in a dream for most of the film...  No one can accuse Neil Gaiman (creator and writer of the Sandman (dream) series) of not knowing how dreams work..  He is an expert on writing in dream logic.<br /><br />So one final thought... If we attack originality in film (which this most definitely is) how do we hope to escape the mundane work generated on a weekly basis from the major studios???r of the Sandman (dream) series) of not knowing how dreams work..

B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite For Destruction may just be the best rock n roll record ever conceived!!! From start to finish it kicks you in your teeth with attitude. The hooks are big and the tunes are flawless. Not a single filler song on the entire album!!! GNR shows why they are still one of the most talked about bands in history. This album is their finest hour!
1564148793|3.0|I give this one an \\"eh.\\"  If you have an affinity for the kitchen-witchery/spell concoctions (which can include things like nails, grave dirt, and a few fairly unpleasant ingredients) which are then applied physically, like being sprayed around the house or buried outside, then this is a book you'll really enjoy.  If you are fascinated by Hoodoo, this is definitely a book for you.  The author was obviously writing from that perspective, with repeated references to various Hoodoo spells and terminology.  It was also heavily laced with his personal fascination with Hekate, and includes a number of rituals incorporating her.<br /><br />I viewed it as an interesting collection of folk and Hoodoo remedies, with a large amount Hekate-oriented Wicca worked in.  Not being particularly interested in Hoodoo and old-school folk magic, I found the book of limited value beyond curiosity.<br /><br />It provides a nice collection of useful web links at the though, with starting points for research, and shows how someone who really uses these techniques would operate.
0374280967|5.0|It may be more accurate to classify The Uncommon Reader as a kind of literary parable.

B000002LGA|5.0|I bought this album on cassette in 1988 from a mom amd pop record store on the seeming advice of a Rolling Stone critic whose name I do not recall. In retrospect, this album was named one of the top 100 of the '80's by that aforementioned magazine. Anyway, the reviewer was accurate in his description of Reed's work. Being from the South, a small rural town in Georgia, I know almost nothing of the realities of New York City so Mr. Reed's truths are quite possibly wasted on my limited insights. Movies offer only sketches of dramatized truth. I can assert, however, that Lou Reed's \\"New York\\" is one of the best albums throughout that I've ever heard. Mr. Reed and his band garage rock from provincial musing to provincial musing with no seams, no falterings. This CD, album, tape whatever one wishes to refer to it as is brilliant, showing no weaknesses at any point. There are no best songs, only tone driven ambiance - songs for moods and inclinations. Finally, as Mr. Reed states in the liner notes, this is an album to enjoy in one sitting, as an entire work. Yet, if one is driving to his/her neighborhood convenience store, \\"Strawman\\" is a great listen when the sun is going down and a refreshing chill is in the air. This album has no comparisons. It is a meshing of alternative, guitar driven rock with poetry. It contains no wedding reception or dinner party songs.

B000W1V7K4|4.0|After watching all those disappointing sequels this year, I finally saw a \\"part 3\\" that has charisma, good chemistry, and more importantly, entertaining moments. Surprisingly, Ocean's Thirteen is a step up from the previous film--which was pretty boring by the way. This time around, everything is bigger--the stakes, money and casinos. It has its minor flaws, but it was much better than expected.<br /><br />Brief Story Intro:<br />Successful, and very arrogant, casino owner Willie Bank (Al Pacino) double-crosses one of the original eleven, Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould). The evil Mr. Bank basically ruins him economically and mentally--All of this to build his new monster casino in Las Vegas. Reuben is so devastated by his loss that he suffers a nervous breakdown and he is unable to speak. It is time to get even. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) finds all this insulting and gathers the rest of the gang to plan an attack to ruin Will Bank. The task won't be easy. They will face new obstacles along the way--even a super computer similar to the one from Superman III. Also, they'll need to team up with an old nemesis Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) to get the job done.<br /><br />Review:<br />More dynamic and entertaining than the 2004 sequel, Ocean's Thirteen follows the same old formula, but has all the right ingredients to keep you entertain. We enjoy the same old chemistry between the characters, double-crosses, jokes and new plans to ruin Bank's business--this time they have to penetrate a state-of-the-art hotel & casino with an artificial intelligence super computer. Some might find the plot a bit silly and hard to follow, especially with all their new plans to scam the casino--which are more elaborated this time around. But towards the end of the movie, everything starts to make sense and perhaps will put a smile in your face.<br /><br />These are A-class actors who give us great performances. But the actor who really got my attention is Andy Garcia who is more charismatic and entertaining than before--in my opinion, he did a much better job than superstar Al Pacino who played his same old character. I also enjoyed the cinematography which is more colorful than the previous films.<br /><br />But there are things that should have been done to make the film more entertaining. First of all, the movie is a bit long (2 hours). Yes, there are some draggy moments, but they are not that big of an issue, at least for me. Unlike the other movies, though, there is a lack of romance--Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones are absent.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />It's the same old formula but it still works. If you were disappointed by the 2004 sequel, Ocean's Thirteen is an improvement where we get a good story, extravagant actors, big locations, and entertaining moments. I recommend this film.--in my opinion, he did a much better job than superstar Al Pacino who played his same old character.

B000VNMMR0|5.0|Bruce Willis is probably one of the few old-school \\"macho\\" actors that can still kick butt, even in his 50s. He demonstrates his \\"muscle power\\" once again with his new movie Live Free or Die Hard, a new sequel of the Die Hard series. He is back as the charismatic John McClain--the character that made him famous. This time around he has to neutralize a smart cyber-terrorist who is trying to bring down the US by hacking into government computers. Great stuns, good chemistry, cool technology, car crashes and \\"McClain\\" humor are the trademarks of the Die Hard movies. This is one of the best action movies of 2007.<br /><br />Brief Story Intro:<br />It is present day and John McClain (Bruce Willis) cleaned up and now he is a detective for the NYPD. He is assigned to arrest a computer hacker named Matt (Justin Long) who might be involved in a computer attack against some classified government computers. When McClain goes to pick him up, they get attacked by unidentified killers with automatic weapons. Meanwhile, other computer hackers are being killed around the country and more strange problems are happening to more computer networks. What is going on here? We soon realize that a renegade computer programmer Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) along with his army of hackers is systematically destroying The United States infrastructure by hacking into mayor government networks--he gets full control of transportation, communications, electricity and TV networks spreading fear. It is up to McClain and Matt to stop him, but it won't be easy. Thomas kidnaps his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and threatens to kill her if McClain doesn't stop. What would McClain do?<br /><br />Review:<br />First it was Stallone with his big Rocky comeback, and now it's time for Bruce Willis to do same and we couldn't ask for a better action movie. Live Free or Die Hard brings the best of the Die Hard tradition. It takes us back the \\"good old\\" excitement of action movies from the 80s when it was all about the \\"wow\\" stuns, character development, fun dialogue and humor--this time around with a bit more of the \\"high-tech\\" stuff. Bruce Willis is the one that makes this movie work. He is a veteran actor and knows how to portray this character. As always, McClain is very patriotic, charming, determined to get the job done and makes his enemies go crazy. I always enjoyed his character.<br /><br />Technically, the film looks and sounds excellent. I enjoyed the way director Len Wiseman (Underworld) presents the movie. For the story, he gives us a feeling of panic and chaos, because it is a realistic scenario of what would happen if we get a cyber attack like that. The cinematography is very dynamic with excellent camera work--very similar to Michael Bay. The action scenes are intense and breathtaking. Mostly real stuns are presented with very little CGI. All the good ingredients that Die Hard fans will enjoy.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />Hollywood Veterans are kicking butt lately. They bring back the action, muscles and \\"punch\\" that the audience need. Live Free of Die Hard is a sequel to one of best action movies of the 80s. If you're a fan of action movies--like myself--you'll be pleased by the way Bruce Willis brings the beloved character back to the big screen.w\\" stuns, character development, fun dialogue and humor--this time around with a bit more of the \\"high-tech\\" stuff.

The cinematography is very dynamic with excellent camera work--very similar to Michael Bay. The action scenes are intense and breathtaking. Mostly real stuns are presented with very little CGI. All the good ingredients that Die Hard fans will enjoy.     The Verdict:  Hollywood Veterans are kicking butt lately. They bring back the action, muscles and \\"punch\\" that the audience need. Live Free of Die Hard is a sequel to one of best action movies of the 80s. If you're a fan of action movies--like myself--you'll be pleased by the way Bruce Willis brings the beloved character back to the big screen.
1594489505|4.0|Khaled Hosseinin is a talented writer. I find his books gripping, his style, easy to read and entertaining. Ofcourse what is good about his books also is that he provides us with glimpses of life in Afghanistan and the minds of afghans.    His narrative is so easy to read, I finished this book in one day. His stories however read like bollywood scripts, a bit a tragedy, tories of deep friendship,tryrannical characters,sufferings, sacrifice (in friendships) and eventaully happy endings.
B000UR9QIK|3.0|This is a classic and always worthy of your bookshelf. However, I think they could have done better with the video quality. My Oppo SD DVD upscaler can almost match the quality of this Blu Ray, save for that micro-detail in some scenes.<br /><br />There are quite a number of low quality Blu Ray's out there and it's unacceptable. The quality of HD video should have an industry standard rating so that you know what you are buying.
B000WPAG1Q|5.0|In this DVD, Christina Aguilera: Live and Down Under, Christina Aguilera shows us and delivers her greatest concert to date. She shows us why this one the highest grossing female tour of 2007, and why she is in the music business in the long haul. If you thought the Stripped: Live in the U.K DVD was amazing, just wait until you order this and watch it. I can't wait to finally watch this and see a true artist command a stage.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This is one of those rare movies that defies any neat classification. It isn't a traditional love story by any stretch. Though it is filled with music from beginning to end it isn't really a musical. In the traditional musical characters will suddenly burst into song but it represented an interruption in the otherwise semi-realistic tone of the movie--think of Gene Kelly in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN. But all the songs in this film are in line with the overall realism of the film, they are all songs that occur in normal life.<br /><br />I don't want to reveal much in the way of details about the movie since much of the joy of the film is discovering the ways it defies expectations. In broad outline it is about a street singer who has put his emotional life on cold storage because of a broken heart and the woman he meets who helps him open himself back up to life. During the day in Dublin he sings familiar standards for tips but at night, when the crowds thin out, he sings his own original material. We see him this way for the first time through the eyes of the Girl as she first meets him (in the credits the two lead characters, never addressed by name, are listed as Guy and Girl). He, played by Frames' frontman Glen Hansard, is singing an absolutely stunning song with intense passion. As he finishes, the camera pulls back to reveal her standing there. From thenceforward we see the two of them get to know each other as they perform a string of amazing songs together.<br /><br />Neither Glen Hansard nor Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; is a professional actor. Hansard did have a prominent role in another great Dublin film about music, THE COMMITMENTS. In that one Hansard played the band's guitarist Outspan Foster, one of the two original members of the band (he is the one who resists the suggestion of the other original member to call their band A Flock of Budgies). In real life, of course, Hansard has long been the resident genius of the great Irish rock band The Frames and both one of the great singers in rock as well as an absolutely brilliant songwriter (neither of which anyone who sees this movie will be inclined to doubt). While visiting Prague a couple of years back he met a precocious teenager who was none other than Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;. One thing led to another and within a year of their meeting they recorded and album together entitled THE SWELL SEASON. Next they appeared in this film by John Carney, himself a former member of The Frames. So their time together has been amazingly productive (she also appeared on the critically acclaimed new album by the Frames, THE COST).<br /><br />The film is filled with wonderful little moments, like the first meeting (driven by Hansard's magnificent performance of \\"Say It To Me Now\\"). Or the way the sound engineer recording the Guy's song goes from disinterest to interest as he realizes just how good he is. Or the marvelous extended shot that follows the Girl from a convenience store where she has bought batteries for a CD player down the street for a few blocks as she sings the lyrics she has written for a song the Guy has written the music for.<br /><br />This truly is a very special film. It does not have the greatest production values; indeed, it feels like the low budget that it is. It works because the two leads, while not professional actors, have a wonderful chemistry both romantically and musically and because Glen Hansard is one of the finest songwriters around. In fact, the soundtrack for the film has to go down as one of the greatest soundtracks ever released. I would urge anyone who loves the music in this film to investigate not merely the soundtrack for the film, but both THE SWELL SEASON, the album by Glen Hansard and Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;, and two albums by the Frames, FITZCARRALDO and THE COST.s in rock as well as an absolutely brilliant songwriter (neither of which anyone who sees this movie will be inclined to doubt).

B00003CXUM|4.0|One of the reasons I love Wong Kar-wai is that he has an amazing ability to write good smooth dialogue. Even if the film lacks in other areas like picture quality for one, he takes your mind off of that by focusing on these characters and their cool conversations. He creates what I believe are magical scenes of emotion between these characters with his charming writing. The actors he casts are perfect, no wonder why he sticks with them. Especially Tony Leung who sets the mood with his smooth style but I must say Maggie Cheung has equal skills here. In the Mood for Love is extremely simple, two couples meet in a Hong Kong when they become next door neighbors in an apartment building.<br /><br />Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) who is a journalist meets Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung) a secretary when they move in on the same day in the apartment. The two have a few things in common like they are both married to people who work all the time or at least this is what they think. Chow and Mrs. Chan's spouses are both cheating on them with each other. Yes that sounds really crazy but that's what happens. The two find out the well kept secret and then begin developing their own relationship and become close friends. Throughout the film I kept wondering when all these things were happening. I felt like this movie could've been so much better if you had a slight clue that something was going on between the Mrs. Chan's husband and Mr. Chow's wife.<br /><br />You watch the film not knowing the plot so some may be suspect to turn the movie off before it develops because it takes to long for the conflict to be exposed. Also when your told the two are cheating it's too simple, Mrs. Chan says something like \\"I can't believe they were together\\". You never even get to see their spouses; you just hear their voices, which is not so cool. You'd like to see them together to actually understand and really believe the situation. Mrs. Chan talks to Mr. Chow like a close friend after making clear that she was distant from him because of her own loneliness. You can tell an amount an unexplained ammount of time passed. She attaches herself to him too quickly and it creates a bit of an unrealistic feeling in the film.<br /><br />On a more personal expectation I wish the relationship between Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow could have had more to it than what it had. I hope people don't get me wrong when reading my review because I liked this film but to me it could have been so much better. I rate it high because I love the direction from Wong Kar-wai. The way he puts his characters in environments where they have to be near each other. He gives them good deep dialogue where they pick each other's brain and get to know themselves. He makes them feel like real life people. I also love his settings, choice of music, and camera angles. I want to like this movie and did but I saw a few flaws that took away from it. The loose sequel 2046 shows that Kar-wai learned from his mistakes with this film.

B0007PAMR4|5.0|I never got to see it when it came out, but I love the movie. The miniseries was a major disapointment. They tried to redo the movie but didn't really do a good job of it. This is the Extended/Drectors Cut that plays on the Sci-Fi channel. This explanes alot that in the orignal didn't make sence or left you going \\"HUH\\". It would had been nice to had seen what the movie would had looked like if it wasn't shorten for the movies. If you liked the orignal Dune you will love the Extended version. This is well worth the cost.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I think it's important that everyone who watches this movie knows that the only person running for US President who has Michael Moore's support for their healthcare plan is DENNIS KUCINICH.  Dennis Kucinich is the only candidate of any party who is offering a single-payer, not-for-profit universal healthcare system.<br /><br />The other candidates want to keep insurance companies and big business involved, which means premiums, co-pays, and deductibles will still be through the roof.  Please see Dennis Kucinich's healthcare plan!  This is from my own writing with some included background:<br /><br />Dennis Kucinich is the only candidate for President with a plan for a universal, single-payer, not-for-profit health care system. 1 out of every 6 people in this country is without health insurance and even more are underinsured. Many people know that the United States is by far the wealthiest nation in the world. Yet many people falsely believe that the United States has the best healthcare system. On a 16 point study, the<br />United States ranked 12th out of 13 countries studied for their healthcare systems. Sweden, for example, has universal healthcare. The Swedish spend LESS per capita on healthcare, their government spends LESS funding healthcare, and their percentage of GDP spent on healthcare is barely half of what we spend. And the real kicker is that a Swedish person's life expectancy is more than TWO YEARS greater than<br />ours.<br /><br />So we've covered the facts that universal healthcare would cost us less than we're paying now (as far as individuals), it will cost our government less, and we'd get better care. But some critics say that there would be a shortage of doctors and nurses. This is where it gets really interesting! Critics often say that people would have less incentive to be doctors or nurses because they would be paid less under a universal healthcare system. Yet the facts are surprising. Considering the US, 9 of every 1000 people are nurses and 2 of every 1000 people are doctors. Sweden, however, has 28% more doctors per 100 people and 10% more nurses than the United States. The statistics are similar for other<br />wealthy countries. Out of 50 countries ranked by life expectancy, the United States ranked 38! Dennis knows that this is not acceptable for the wealthiest and most powerful nation in the world to be ranked number 38 in anything, but especially the health and well being of our people!<br /><br />But what makes Dennis' healthcare plan different from other candidates? As I mentioned earlier, Dennis is the only candidate with a single-payer, not-for-profit healthcare system. What this means is that mega insurance companies are no longer the only option. Private health insurance will still be available for those who desire it and wish to pay for it, but there will be no more expensive premiums, co-pays, or deductibles<br />for those who choose to be covered under the universal system. Choice equals freedom, and so Dennis gives us a choice. But being taken care of is a right that everyone is entitled to, and that is why Dennis supports single-payer, not-for-profit healthcare.<br /><br />DENNIS KUCINICH<br />[...]<br />[...]re doctors.

But wherever you start, it's hard not to like these wonderful books.

0743451503|3.0|At first it is hard not to fall in love with Gloria Gilbert who, like all the self-besotted children of the heady and hedonistic Jazz Age, is so riotously frivolous, so ingenously self-centred. You excuse the fatuous languidness of her husband Anthony Patch as the transitory aimlessness of youth. But you know that these two have it coming when Gloria - in what FSF calls her \\"Nietszchean moment\\" - declares \\"I don't care about truth; I only want happiness!\\" While the rest of the Ivy League brahmins live out their dreams as writers and movie-makers, Gloria and Anthony squander their money and beauty on endless parties and clubs. At the end they are the flotsam of the Jazz Age. This tale strains at tragic grandeur without quite achieving it, chiefly because its two main protagonists remain essentially unlikeable, without any redeeming attribute that would stir our sympathy. The prose drips with lyricism, but it is without grace, poise and maturity. FSF was only 26 when it was first published, and this book displays a raw diamond that would attain polish a little later.
0060775858|1.0|We got this book as a gift at my baby shower.  Having heard so many great things about this \\"classic,\\" I was expecting a wonderful children's book.  Maybe these high expectations were part of the problem, but I was extremely disappointed.  I just don't see what the fuss is about-- just because something has a reputation for being a classic, doesn't mean it's good.  The story is not interesting at all, but worse, the illustations are completely unengaging.  I do not like that some of the pictures are really tiny, and the fact that every other page is in black and white seems unfitting for a children's book.  My daughter is only 6 months old so I don't know her opinion of this book yet, but I can't get myself to read it to her.  My mother-in-law can't understand how I don't consider this book to be a wonderful classic, but I think she's just being sentimental since she read it to her kids and can't see beyond this.

1400032717|3.0|This book was very highly recommended to me by an avid book reader whose opinion I trust. I enjoyed the book; it was interesting to peer into the mind of an autistic boy and it held my attention. However, I wish I hadn't read [[ASIN:0618711651 Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close: A Novel]] by Jonathan Safran Foer beforehand, because this one felt a little too similar. \\"A Curious Incident\\" is narrated by a fifteen-year-old austic boy who, we learn, has lost his mother, and sets out to investigate the death of his neighbor's dog. \\"Extremely Loud\\" is narrated by a nine-year-old boy who lost his father in the 9/11 attacks and sets out on an investigation of his own pertaining to a certain key, and while not autistic, has certain traits and characteristics not unlike Haddon's narrator.<br /><br />All that to say that had I read \\"The Curious Incident\\" first, I would have appreciated it an awful lot more and likely would have hailed it as brilliant.

B000GFLE86|5.0|Listen.     Well, I guess that says it all.  Let me explain.      Picture this if you will...   You've had a bad day and just want to get home to relax. You walk in the door, kick off your shoes and get you're coffee maker goin'.  You pop into the living room and click on your audio system... letting it warm up while you get into something more comfortable.  You grab a cup of coffee and head back to the living room. You pop Half The Perfect World in the CD player. You grab the remote and head for your listening spot. You click the 'GO' button on the remote and AHHHHHH... utter relaxation!      Great music and  great performances. There's nothing left to say.     I rated this CD FIVE STARS based on the music and performances and that I'm writing to a non audiophile audience. HOWEVER, if I were reviewing this for my web page, I'd rate it this way:    Music A+  Performance A-  Recording C-    About the recording... the overall sound is \\"thick & muddy\\", that is, it lacks overall clarity and ambience.  If you can relate to the difference between flying thru the air and swimming in mud, this thing was recorded in a mud puddle.    But don't let that stop you from buying Half The Perfect World.  The beauty of the music and the excellence of the performances far outweigh the muddy, 1950's jukebox sound.    As I suggested at the beginning of this review ...sit back, relax, enjoy.

B0002X1JKU|5.0|A must-read for anyone who has a serious interest in investing. While very informative, I do have to admit the prose is a bit stilted and it was a slog in some places. The commentary by Jason Zweig was excellent and gave a much needed change of pace from the text.    While it's true that many of the ideas presented here are now old-hat and can be found in many other books, there is something fascinating and sobering about reading the source. I think it will give any investor a historical dimension to their thinking that will prove valuable to them.

B000NA28I4|1.0|This movie is the most boring movie ever.  After reading the book, I had pretty high expectations.  After watching this movie, I never wanted to pick up the book again.

B000OYC7A8|5.0|This is certainly the best concert DVD I have ever seen, and I have seen many. The concert and the multitude of special features are both top notch.  I say it's better than Pulse, In the Flesh, or even Live at Pompeii. The Royal Albert Hall is a very beautiful venue to house the amazing light show to go along with excellent camera work and a fantastic sound mix. I'd say the highlights of the concert are \\"On and Island,\\" \\"Shine on you Crazy Diamond,\\" and \\"Echoes.\\" This is an absolute must for any Pink Floyd/David Gilmour enthusiast or is a fair introduction to those unfamiliar with the work.
0066620996|5.0|As I was reading this book, I thought numerous times of how wonderful it would be if I was working at a company that was trying to transform itself from good to great. The reality, however, is that most people don't work at great companies. Instead, most of us work at mediocre companies fighting to stay alive in today's competitive business world, unsure as to the one thing the business could do better than anyone else.<br /><br />This book is thoroughly researched and thought provoking. The ideas are timeless and, if followed, I am convinced that the results would speak for themselves. The eleven or so companies used as model companies in the book that changed from good to great are still thriving today, six years after the book was published, and the employees engaged in the work love it, I am sure. And who wouldn't? Working with a company determined to be successful would be exciting, if not challenging. I only wish I could bring up some of the practices described in detail in this book to those leaders of my current company. Until changes are made, its greatness will forever be on hold.
B00004YKSD|2.0|The video resolution is very poor, I in fact have to watch the DVD in \\"zoomed\\" mode in order for it to make it fit the screen.
B000CPGZHA|4.0|I bought this DVD after seeing a 1- hour Kylie special called \\"On a night like this\\", an abbreviated version of her \\"Live in Sydney\\" concert. Let me start by pointing out my only two (minor) objections to this DVD.<br />First, Menu navigation: cumbersome. The concert is divided in \\"acts\\", so if you want to hear a song in, say, act five, you have to start in screen one (\\"Act 1\\") and then press the \\"next\\" key four times. Second: the audience. Though you can see Kylie trying to \\"connect\\" with her audience, their response seems at times a bit cold and distant. Please don't get me wrong, I have nothing against the Brits, but if this same show had taken place in, say, Canberra or Sydney, the crowd would probably have gone wild.<br />Now for the good stuff: the sound quality in this DVD is excellent (If you have a Home Theater System, now is the time to use it); Kylie's musicians are first rate; some versions are an absolute \\"must\\", (i.e. \\"Better the devil you know\\") and the \\"Behind the Scenes\\" is much better than I expected.<br />If you don' t know Kylie Minogue well, maybe you should start by watching \\"Live in Sydney\\" and decide from there. If, on the other hand, you saw \\"Live...\\" or have heard a few more of her songs, then you owe it to yourself to buy this DVD and enjoy it. It is WONDERFUL.
B000M4RG4C|1.0|I would love t write a review of the film 'Flags of Our Fathers' as I found the book quite, quite absorbing and recommend it for anyone.

A pointless deal I feel.  Alack and alas.<br /><br />  K Reynolds (joken041@yahoo.co.uk)
B000UOOT1W|5.0|All in all this is a great CD. My feeling is that it should have been a double disk as it's impossible to fit the Ultimate Santana onto one CD. Where is She's not there, Winning, Well alright, Open invitation, All I ever wanted. With that said,  if we look at a single disk version as a great collection of Santana songs, here you go. Every song is incredible, remastering is perfect. The older tracks blend seamlessly with the newer ones. There is not a weak track on the CD, enjoyable listening. Carlos's guitar work get's better with age, if that's possible. Don't look at this as missing tracks and being incomplete, look at it as a masterful body of work and play it loud!
B000I2J2WM|5.0|The Picture is really Unbelievable on this some 30 year old movie. James Garner in the French Riviera with hot car races and romance. Must have in HD DVD!
B00005JLCI|5.0|I've waited a long time for the DVD edition, and now accept its time for a wide screen LCD panel on which to truly take in the luminescent performances and cinematography of this film. (its too wide for a boring 'old' 68cm Trinitron)    A charm to watch for a hamlet fan: so natrual and fluid, and so hard to flaw.     (note the extremely high hit rate for this item - 96%)
038572179X|5.0|Stupendously beautiful novel. I almost literally could not put this book down (an affliction caused by all magnificent stories). I became completely invested in the characters. A marvelous & gripping drama.
B000VL9XNI|5.0|What a fantastic collection of rare and previously unavailable tracs and interviews from AC/DC, one the greatest bands ever to grace a stage.  This is raw stuff...typical AC/DC...and they don't disappoint.  The tracs were left in many of their original forms without the benefit of remastering, but if you have a good sound sytem it won't matter.  It was an intentional decision by the band to show their raw talent, emotion, and sound from their formative days.  Why remaster?  We all know what AC/DC sounds like.  This is more like a historical journey than a concert, and to see Bon, Angus, and Malcomb in those early clips belting out pure rock and roll is an amazing sight.  I highly recommend this set to any AC/DC fan or anyone who loves rock and roll in its purest form.  AC/DC can flat out rock the house, and they tear it down in Plug Me In.
B000I0RR76|4.0|This is an old classic presented in full screen 1:33 ratio (original aspect ratio of this 1938 film). If you like old classic film in color and don't mind the full screen, you'll enjoy this film. The colors are surprisingly great for this almost 70 years old movie.
B000SNUMC0|3.0|For as long as I've been listening (since Burnt Offerings) Iced Earth, and moreover Jon Schaffer, have never let me down. I remember the excitement of buying Dark Saga, Something Wicked, and even Horror Show.  And then I wore my cd player out listening to them over and over (Sure, Horror Show didn't have the staying power of those before it but I still loved it when I first heard it). There was some trepidation over Glorious Burden, because Matt left, but those doubts were washed away by the absolute awesomeness of one Tim Owens. Burden now stands behind only the mighty Stormrider and Something Wicked as my favorite Iced Earth album. So it was with GREAT expectations that I bought Framing Armageddon and experienced something I never had before with Iced Earth... disappointment.  Framing is not a bad album, it's just not a great album.  And when I think of Iced Earth, I think great. Ten Thousand Strong is the only classic I.E. on the album. I think The Clouding is a great new sound for the band and there a couple of other good tracks, but overall the album is far below par for this band. Where are the classic galloping riffs? Why does Owens sound like Edith Bunker in some songs? And there are WAY too many choir vocals. Framing Armageddon just doesn't FEEL like my favorite band. Let's just hope Part II is back on track.

1400063515|5.0|I picked up this book at an airport bookstore. I was two pages into the Prologue when I looked up and announced that this was going to be one of the best books I've ever read. The Black Swan is filled with simple thought experiments that demonstrate that the world does not work like you think it does; that the world is far more complex than you think it is; and that your mind is programmed to find causality where none exists.     My favorite thought experiment is to put an ice cube on the counter and then predict the shape of the puddle two hours from now. When you try to find and control for all the variables involved, you quickly discover the problem is too complex; and how do you know everything will stay the same? Maybe someone will open a window, or turn on the heat, or wipe up the puddle. Now try it in reverse; look at a puddle of water on the counter and try to figure out the shape of the ice cube that produced it. You can't. In fact, you can't even be sure that the puddle was produced from an ice cube. Yet your mind will try to generate causality from minimal evidence, despite the impossibility of the task. (Although Taleb doesn't make this point, this thought experiment sheds light on the problems with all theories concerning the origin of life, the universe, and everything.)    Another concept is to ask a man of the world (Fat Tony) and an accountant a standard statistical problem; if you flipped a coin 99 times and it came up heads, what are the odds that the 100th toss will come up heads? The logical person would say 50%; while Fat Tony would say 99% because the game is obviously rigged.     Highly recommended.

0066620996|5.0|This book was recommended to me by someone I respect so I didn't do much research before ordering.  At first the easy reading style gave me the impression that it had little substance.  However, after getting into the book I realized that there was a great deal of substantive research backing up the recommendations.  Some of the reviews have indicated a concern that the rules may have changed since the research was conducted.   I too had reservations that his research might be a bit dated.  However after further reflection and observation of current organizations I would have to firmly disagree.  Mr. Collins and his research team have uncovered timeless recommendations that I plan to put into action in my organization.  Moreover, my company was listed as one of the \\"Comparison Companies\\" not considered \\"Great\\" during the time periods analyzed.  Fortunately, a lot has changed since the analysis period in the book.  We merged with a better company which resulted in a much stronger leadership team and more effective corporate culture.
B000000OSE|5.0|Guns N' Roses steps up their musical talent and diversity on their pairs of Use Your Illusions - this one is the more angrier side in an overall sense. Aside from the straight up hard rock from \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" you've got GNR with more influences branching from blues, country, and classical music - I thought it was an interesting combo for the band and it all worked out well. \\"November Rain\\" is a classic - classical orchestration, beautiful piano, and the excellent guitar work from Slash in the solos and the drama at the end of the song is just intense! Aside from angry songs like \\"Right Next Door To Hell\\" you've got calmer and blusey songs like \\"Dust N Bones\\" which was a personal favorite and Axl isn't the only singer in GNR - I believe Dizzy Reid does vocals too? I'm not sure but it certainly adds a new dimension to GNR. \\"Live And Let Die\\" sounded interesting - more heavier than the original of course and more sound to it, but I'd stick with the original. In an overall sense, \\"Use Your Illusion I\\" is a musician's step forward from \\"Appetite\\" but just as in your face and quiet at times , highly recommended.
0307387178|4.0|Like several recent reviewers, I read this book when it came out 10 years ago and recently re-read it in anticipation of the movie.  I wasn't that impressed with it originally, but I probably appreciated it a little more this time around.    How you react to the book will largely depend on your attitude about Chris McCandless, who dies from starvation after spending slightly more than three months in the Alaska wilderness.    Was he fool hardy or was he an adventurer who should be admired for pursuing his dream?  McCandless didn't master crucial skills to survive and was ridiculously ill prepared.  To make matters worse, he threw away his map and lacked sufficient provisions.    Krukauer says it's easy to stereotype McCandless and that he wasn't as reckless as others thought.  He tries to show us the mindset of people like McCandless by writing about other pioneer types and earlier adventurers, including himself.    This is a thin book (barely over 200 pages) and it's apparent that Krukauer had to pad what was originally a 9,000-word article with material that wasn't directly related to McCandless or his adventures.  But since there were gaps in his journal and his entries while in Alaska were sparse, there wasn't a lot known about what he did during that time.    Krukauer's masterful writing, however, makes the book work.  It is interesting, thought provoking and heart-breaking.
B0002HMQUS|5.0|I really like this monopod. It's a lot better than my last one which was a real cheapo that I lost at a concert. (Good Riddance) If you're looking for a solid value, this monopod will deliver.   I have a 300mm with a 1.4 TC which is a bit heavy and this pod handles it perfectly. The locking mechanism on the tilt head really locks down my equipment and holds it in place. The locking height  adjustments on the leg are built really well and should last a long time. If they should fail, it appears that they can be replaced very easy. Not the case with  el-cheapo junk.  The only drawback I can think of is the weight which really isn't an issue considering that this monopod doesn't cost  ( less than $100) as much as some of the ultra-lightweight ones do. You can buy this monopod with the tilt head, keep it awhile and upgrade to better head in the future and have a great rig with a minimal investment.
1582701709|5.0|They say dynamite comes in small packages, and this book is proof. Built on the premise of \\"as a man thinks, so is he,\\" this little but mighty book is filled with inspiration on the subjects of health, wealth, following our dreams, and more.  It's diminutive size makes it portable and easy to access for \\"instant\\" gratification.  The author's collection of wisdom, encouragement and guidance from many exceptional people provide a comprehensive coverage of it's subjects. One of my favorite passages is a quote by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (on pg 57): \\"Take the first step in faith. You don't have to see the whole staircase. Just take the first step.\\" While I don't quite agree with the theory that (all) disease is caused by negative thought, I do agree that there's a great deal we can do to heal ourselves and to be joyful regardless of our circumstances.  I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this book for yourself and for gifts.  You will find yourself reading it over and over again.  Well worth a full purchase price!
B000002JKA|5.0|Dream Theater's \\"Awake\\" was a little darker and heavier than the previous record \\"Images & Words\\" but musically more complex filling more guitar solos and heavier riffs. \\"Awake\\" is sort of an evolution from their first 2 records with longer song averages and they would eventually continue this song writing style throughout the rest of their career up to now. The vocal approach is at times more aggressive and less calm as well. This was DT's last album with original keyboardist Kevin Moore, and his keyboard and musical talent is displayed fairly well on this album. I give this album a solid 5 stars because it's still classic Dream Theater, and quite enjoyable to listen to how they experiment with their music.
B00003CWPL|4.0|This is a cult classic surreal post-apocalyptical dreamscape. Nottice the atomic mushroom poster on eraserheads bedroom, the industrial waste looking location and of course the mutant baby. This is a must see for anyone interested on non-commercial cinema and cult cinema wannabes.<br />The Pixies used to cover the song the lady sings just before playing where is my mind.
B000MZHW40|5.0|I seen an edited (PG) version of this movie and it was Great!      The writer follows a person's life experiences to bring out different facets or issues regarding the blood diamonds.    Dicaprio throws his heart into this movie and is very believable as the character.     You can tell that the people who made this movie and wrote the script put their heart into it, not to mention probably took risks, and if you think deeply about it,  its much like a diamond with a lot of different facets.  It's good to know there are people out there who still care what is happening to people in other countries.    Loved the acting, loved the script, Loved the movie!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Dream Theater still maintains their progressive metal roots but much heavier, angrier and more aggressive - I don't find it bad at all! This is actually one of the favorite albums by Dream Theater. There's definitley more technical guitar soloing by Petrucci on this CD and I love that! I don't find anything wrong with this album at all - it's just a heavier and sharper side to Dream Theater. There's quite a good amount of progressive music on this album as most of the songs run over 10 minutes! Riffs are heavy, guitar solos are very virtouso - I love it all!

B00003CXC7|5.0|This movie is my personal favorite Hitchcock, and my favorite movie.  Its just one of those I could watch again and again.    Jimmy Stewart plays L.B. Jeffries, wheel chair bound photographer, the representation of the audience.  He looks out into the world of his nieghbors, as if they were a movie being played for his amusment.  The gorgeous Grace Kelly play's Lisa Freemont, Jeff's girlfriend, and the soul of the very movie, who also views the show, but is less detatched then Jeff.  Thelma Ritter plays Stella, Jeff's nurse, who never has a problem fixing sandwich's with common scence spread on the bread.    As Jeff watchs his neighbors, he begins to notice something wrong in one of the apartments.  A man named Thorwald, whos sittuation is the reverse of Jeff and Lisa's, might have killed his invalid wife and dumped her body.  Thorwald is getting ready to go, and Jeff and Lisa have to prove a murder that no one else saw.
B00005RG6B|5.0|What can I say about this DVD that hasn't already been said.  I was at this concert in Madison, WI.  It was an experience that I never forgot.  I've been to several concerts from big hair like Poison and Crue to Metal giants like Pantera, Zombie, and Manson.  This concert is still number one.  Mindcrime is still one of my all time favorite albumns.
1400049628|5.0|Max Brooks seems to do research just as well as any author out there, especially in `World War Z'. The laughs, however, in ZSG are quadruple those of `WWZ', due to Brooks' superior deadpan writing style. I would have given anything to be able to see the look on his face as he wrote some of his prose.    Ostensibly, the book sets out to be a `true' survival manual, and the author does a great job of not breaking the fourth wall, because doing so would render all of his efforts in creating the `Zombie Survival Guide' meaningless and pitiable.    However, with Brooks' earnestness, you can't help but love all of the tips given for the sake of survival. My favorite: Blades don't need reloading. Some of the other parody how-to books seem to fail because of a false sense of bravado or some other thing.    What really helps Max Brooks, though, is the fact that he really appears to care about keeping the integrity of the book as true as possible. This book isn't for fans of `Scary Movie'. This book is the `Catch-22' of survival guides. Think about it.
B0000262QW|5.0|Chick Corea at his best in my view. Simple yet complex, this is a wonderful relaxing album. If you buy only one Chick Corea CD, get this one.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|If you like the Chili Peppers, you'll like this album.  The Peppers have a very distinct sound (some of my friends argue that all their songs sound alike), and this album is no different.  I'm a big Peppers fan, and have really enjoyed this album...but if you're not a fan, and you want something that sounds different than their previous albums, you shouldn't buy this one.
0316018953|3.0|I enjoyed the story line as it is very much vintage Connelly. Also liked the part about Harry and Rachel Walling teaming up again. However, at 225 pages (hardcover edition) you could hardly call this a novel. It's more a novelette. The buyer should be warned in advance that you are not getting a novel for the money you are paying.
0446608955|5.0|Landon Carter is now 57 years old and he is telling his love story from when he was a senior in high school. He still remembers the events of something that he thought was just a friendship as if it was yesterday.<br /><br />Jamie Sullivan was a minister's daughter, who wore boring brown sweaters every day, always tied her hair up in a bun, and always had her Bible with her. She is the girl that you would think of when you would imagine the person who gets made fun of in high school. She had never been on a date in her life, and Landon was one of the more popular boys in his high school.<br /><br />Landon didn't have a date for homecoming, so he decided that he would ask Jamie because she was too sweet to say no and wouldn't have a date yet. When he asked, she said \\"promise me that you won't fall in love with me.\\"<br /><br />After a horrible night at homecoming, Jamie asked Landon to play the male lead in an upcoming Christmas play that was performed every year, and was a very big deal in the town. Landon didn't really want to, but Jamie talked him into it because she was playing the lead female and her father had written the play -- and Jamie wanted the play to be very special. After about two months of constant rehearsals, the play was performed and the town knew that this had been the best year ever. And Landon had to admit that it went well, and that he was falling in love with dorky Jamie. But there is a secret that Jamie was hiding from Landon. What could it possibly be? And why did she tell Landon not to fall in love with her?<br /><br />This is another powerful love story from an author that makes you believe in love. Read this amazing novel to find out the secrets of Landon and Jamie.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Taylor Rector
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is one of those albums that takes at least a couple of listens all the way through to sink in due to the unique nature of the arrangements. Once my brain caught up to it, it became one of my very favorite things to listen to. It's often described as depressing or otherwise negative, but to me the album has a very positive message. To me, the message is that we as human beings shouldn't let the mechanisms of modern society force us into a monotonous, uptight, overly programmed existence. This message is the theme of the album, but even without that theme, the music would stand on its own as brilliant. This is what sets this album apart from other \\"concept\\" albums. The songs all fit together to convey the message, but each could stand on its own. There's no \\"filler\\" on this album except \\"fitter, happier\\", but that's more of an interlude that a song.<br /><br />People become fanatically devoted to Radiohead because they really are one of the best bands in the world, and also because they are completely unique in their approach, style, and perspective. They also find a way to keep evolving drastically, and their music is literally twice as good in concert too, so one gets even more enthralled from seeing them live.<br /><br />Because of the excessive zeal of many fans, there has been a backlash. I think we, the Radiohead fans, need to realize that it's okay to be tone deaf and not like Radiohead (kidding :)), and those that are backlashing need to realize that it's okay to be really into some music if it's THAT good, and that it's okay to like music that other people like, even if those people happen to be hipster d bags, which many Radiohead fans are.
B0006J28L4|4.0|****(*)<br /><br />MALCOLM X is Spike Lee's masterwork film, his most generally accessible work, and a biopic and homage to the oft-misunderstood Malcolm, here portrayed brilliantly by Denzel Washington.<br /><br />Although Spike Lee occasionally falls into careless stylism (choppy, non-linear scenes and art school cinematographic indulgences mar the film in spots), the overwhelming tenor and drive of MALCOLM X reduces these flashes to dismissable annoyances.<br /><br />Far better is the story, first of a young Malcolm Little, who from the day of his birth was forced to face institutionalized and endemic racism. The viewer's heart both breaks and flames as the ten year old Malcolm protests, \\"I get the best grades in class,\\" only to be answered by the smarmy, smug white schoolmaster, \\"Yes, but you're a ni**er. And a lawyer is no proper job for a ni**er. Why don't you become a carpenter? Jesus was a carpenter, you know.\\"<br /><br />It is little wonder that the light-skinned red-haired Malcolm (whose mother was a Grenadine, and three-quarters white), turned his frustrated brilliance toward a sordid life of crime and drugs, making his mark in Harlem as \\"Detroit Red,\\" a successful scam artist and pimp. A term in jail turned Malcolm around, converting him into a Black Muslim. Denzel Washington plays the ever-changing Malcolm with passion.<br /><br />At first totally hypnotized by the Nation of Islam message that all devils are white and all whites are devils, Malcolm became a firebrand leader and spokesman for the African-American community, calling for their liberation \\"By any means necessary!\\" at exactly the moment that his contemporary, Dr. Martin Luther King called for black liberation through nonviolence. Although the two men seem to be opposites, they are far more alike than circumstance paints them. King figures only passingly in the film, but King's philosophical evolution was mirrored by Malcolm's, who likewise began moving toward a muscular nonviolence as he moved away from the parochial and exclusivist position of the NOI, and adopted a more global and cosmopolitan worldview of Islam as a unifying and all-inclusive force in the world.<br /><br />His assassination (by extremists) in 1965 robbed the world of a man who was about to become a spokesperson for universal human dignity. Spike Lee's film is both a record of and a memorial to, Malcolm X, who he was, and who he was becoming. What he might have become . . . we will never really know.<br /><br />FOUR STARS FOR THE FILM<br />FIVE STARS FOR THE MESSAGEusivist position of the NOI, and adopted a more global and cosmopolitan worldview of Islam as a unifying and all-inclusive force in the world.

0340839937|4.0|I was very excited through the first half of the book because of the vast range of creative ideas and thoughtful insights into human personalities & psychology. The influence on the author of WW2 and the cold war after it are evident, in stories of loyalty and betrayal and traitors within. The ending is a bit of a let down after such a beautifully crafted work. I think this book has been missed out on by a lot of people (like myself in the past) who dismissed the idea of a powerful novel within science fiction. It probably deserves to be in the top 40 books of all time.
1592402038|3.0|Perhaps a book best enjoyed by English majors, writers, and general punctuation loonies. This manifesto otherwise provides ammunition for the `get a life and just use grammar check' crowd. Truss is quite militant in both her indictment of and attack plan against bad punctuation; she WILL NOT stand the assault of comma misuse any longer. Rectification includes: white out, felt markers, and a gun. So it's easy to see why she sometimes feels the Sisyphus of the punctuation realm and at least she acknowledges her neurosis. This short exercise primarily serves as her steam vent via humorous anecdotes and some punctuation genealogy with general pointers (otherwise found in your beloved Strunk and White or MLA Handbook) on commas, apostrophes, parentheses, periods, dashes, and my beloved semicolon.
6305736650|5.0|Timeless movie filmed  in appropriate black and white. (Avoid the artficially colorized version like the plague). Again,incredibly, I've talked to many who have never seen this film! Am I the only person who's noticed that Bogart and Rains are walking the wrong way in the final scene?  Or is this just a form of \\"poetic license\\" given to producers and directors?

0887307280|5.0|I have read and re-read this book (and the original) many times over the past 15 years.<br /><br />With the first reading I was struck at how many people I knew that fit perfectly into the nutshell descriptions of individuals with locked in mind-sets presented!<br /><br />The entrepreneurial seizure; The Fat Guy & The Skinny Guy; The Entrepreneur & Manager & Technician; customers Sam Tommy and Mary; Bookkeeper Harry; the suppliers, the improperly trained helpers, the desperate owner, and many others. I KNEW these people! Or at least the essence of them.<br /><br />With later readings I became aware of ALL of them as being aspects of my own self, and the possibilities each offered. Attitude is Everything! Change the attitude, change the outcome!<br />For me, this is the main value of the book, learning to understand myself, and why I do the things I do.<br /><br />I feel the overview presented by the E myth should be understood by each new business owner BEFORE making that first leap.<br /><br />No one book can be all things to all people, but for those interested in starting or improving a business, this one comes close.<br /><br />In my mind, there is only one minor failing in the book. It does not examine in great enough detail why people would want to work for you. Success comes from helping other people get what they want. What are their interests, dreams and goals? How can you help them reach what THEY want? Why would they want YOU to succeed?<br /><br />Great businesses can only exist if they have great people.<br /><br />All in all, this is my most valuable Business Book.
6301972139|2.0|One of the best movies of its time is little more now than a \\"period piece\\". Indeed, the movie's terrific theme song has stood the test of time much better than the movie. Paris in 1890 is not exactly a \\"big draw\\" to today's movie goers.Ferrer, on the other hand, does a masterful job in playing Toulouse-Lautrec, brilliantly portraying the handicapped artist whose sketchings and posters hang today in the Louvre. But, the overall production seems prolonged and repetitious, and the fast paced banter of the actors seems difficult to follow.Since its release in 1952, many other films including \\"Rainman\\" and \\"Forrest Gump\\" seem also to have pushed director Huston's \\"masterpiece\\" aside. Now, however, if Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio would care to try an updated version...
B000OYC7A8|5.0|well what can you say, this really is the stuff of legends, Gilmour showing a full range of instrumental talent as well as vocal. Crosby and Nash backing on \\"on a island\\" absolutely brilliant. Robert Wyatt's solo on \\"then i close my eyes\\" loads of feeling, seemingly fully appreciated by Gilmour.I don't mind saying but this did goose me. Shine on you cazy diamond, superb and Bowie on \\"arnold layne\\" please do it again!!. May i add that this was not a Gilmour concert as i feel it was more then 50% floyd with Richard Wright on keyboards and Dick Parry on the Sax.  Now i really wish i had forked out the fee to to the concert, it would have been worth it.

0525950079|1.0|I read the first ten chapters of \\"World Without End\\" and then wondered, \\"What in the world were the critics thinking?\\"  The language did not sound like 14th century lingo, the action was  contrived, and the sex scenes were vulgar.  In an opening climactic scene, a main character fights off his attackers in a huge forest right in the same spot where four children just happen to be playing.  In another scene, the cathedral starts to shake for no apparent reason (after standing perfectly fine for 200 years) and one section collapses.  No one is hurt.  But it does create a great way for the right characters to be in the same place at the right time for the plot to move forward.  Amazing!!  I gave up when another character had sex with a girl who he wasn't attracted to just because he felt sorry for her when she started to cry.  I wanted it all to end.  I have much more important things to read!!
B000H6SXLU|5.0|The music and Dunne's singing, especially Lovely To Look At, can't be beat. She was versatile, beautiful and a joy to watch. What a great lady.  I agree that Rogers dancing was never better. Keep your eyes peeled during the Fashion Show and you will see a very young Lucille Ball.   If you want to see class! If you want the \\"best\\" in voice and acting (Dunne)and the best in dance (Astare and Rogers) than by all means Roberta is a must see!

0385522401|1.0|For me, Atonement is the pinacle of McEwan's writing. After reading Atonement I read his previous novels and for the most part liked them very much as well, especially because they were leading up to Atonement.  But On Chelsea Beach was even more boring though not as dissapointing as Saturday. Unbelievably boring that is. I finished it because, because.........I really don't know why. I hate the direction McEwans writing has taken.

Instead it is a platform for change packed with thought provoking ideas that will enable any seasoned small business owner to relate and take immediate action to re-engineer his business' organization.  I only wish I had read or listened to this book when it was originally published 20 plus years ago.
B0002YLC24|5.0|This was a great sequel to the orignial. The first time I watched it I was somewhat disappointed with the ending, but the more I watch it, the better it gets. It just captures everyday life and human relationships perfectly. No fancy Hollywood show here. The soundtrack is great too - I ended up buying it. Overall, great acting, dialog, scenery, and music. Can't go wrong with this movie.
B000069KE0|5.0|This CD is a great reissue of Chicago's incredible second album, featuring great songs such as \\"Make Me Smile\\", \\"Colour My World\\" (both featuring late guitarist Terry Kath's gruff baritone), and \\"25 Or 6 To 4\\" (featuring the tenor of Peter Cetera), all of which have become some of the most beloved songs on both the Classic Rock and Adult Contemporary formats. The latter is about insomnia, and is something I can relate to because I've done exercises or worked on a paid job on my computer when this situation happened to me. This album is a must-own for any classic rock fan.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is hilarious.  I laughed out loud throughout the entire movie.  This is one of those rare movies that you can laugh by just looking at a character.  John Heder plays Napoleon Dynamite to perfection and the rest of the cast is flawless.  The movie could have probably done without Sensei Rex, but whatever.  This movie isn't for people who prefer comedies to be mostly getting hit in the crotch, passing gas, and then getting hit in the crotch again.  \\"Napolean Dynamite\\" is low key, very dead-pan, but extremely funny.  \\"Gosh!\\"  How can someone not like this movie?!
B000069KGM|5.0|This CD is a great reissue of an incredible debut album by Chicago (then known as Chicago Transit Authority; the real CTA objected, hence the name change). The album features such classics as \\"Beginnings\\", \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\" (both sung by keyboardist Robert Lamm), \\"Questions 67 & 68\\" (sung by Peter Cetera), and a cover of the Spencer Davis Group's \\"I'm A Man\\" (where Cetera and the late Terry Kath both sing lead), as well as instrumental pieces that were ambitious for their time. This album remains the band's best work.

B000R7HY0K|3.0|I really liked the action scenes and effects,no doubt,but they talk and talk for hours non-sense,at least they should have included another action stunt to make it less boring,then i would have given it 4 stars.
1590171993|5.0|I found myself half way through Stoner telling my wife how much i was enjoying it yet couldnt put my finger on why and i didnt have much to say when asked what the plot was.  Of course more twists in the plot soon developed after that conversation but i think that the plot doesnt really drive this book.  Our hero is someone I have no interest in meeting and I dont know anyone who resembles him.  often when i read about charachters that are withdrawn and uncomfortable in the world i become frustrated with them, wanting them to grow and to break out of their shell or stand up to those who keep them down but with Stoner i did not have my usual response.  The writing is excellent, you feel a part of everything and although one could come away from this book saying that not a lot happened it is hard to put down since you want to know what will happen next, i plan to introduce this work to my book club and i assume they will enjoy it as much as i did.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|as someone who has watched a lot of horror films, tv shows, i am a liitle bit jaded when it comes to watching a new one, i was expecting predictable plots, but i was suprised with this series, the producers manage to weave and mold well known urban legend stories, refreshing and scary, lastly, there is a chemistry between the two main characters, they compliment each other, definitely, would recommend.

B0000019PA|5.0|In \\"Sonny's Blues,\\" by James Baldwin, the narrator says, while listening to his brother in a jazz club, \\"For, while the tale of how we suffer, and how we are delighted, and how we may triumph is never new, it always must be heard.  There isn't any other tale to tell, it's the only light we've got in all this darkness.\\"  This is my all-time favorite story, and this passage speaks directly to my two all-time favorite albums:  John Coltrane's A Love Supreme, and Neutral Milk Hotel's In the Aeroplane Over the Sea.  With a few listens, you'll be both entranced by Jeff Mangum's grieving over the depths of the human condition, and uplifted by his longing to preserve humanity's beauty.
B000UCEJEQ|3.0|As always I have very high expectations of Annie Lennox having one of the greatest voices in the field - so I am sad to say that this album is altogether another disappointment.  The song material is rather dull !  It is like a beautifully executed movie with a poor story.  To paraphrase Groucho Marx:  I have heard great CD's - but this isn't one of them !
B000RG1FMO|5.0|This album made me want to move to Chicago.  Thanks, Kanye, for overcoming the sophomore slump with #2, to \\"go head and switch your style up.\\"  If they are \\"hatin', let em hate, and watch the money pile up.\\"  The end.
0805079831|5.0|To those who rated this as a bad book and then go on to say the book faults capitalism is missing the point.  The world is not black or white or pure capitalism versus total dictatorial communism.  For capitalism to really work there needs to be regulations so that the playing field is fair. For a free country to really be free the people must have an opportunity to be part of it (i.e. free quality public education, health care, etc.).      If those who find pure capitalism and the shrinking middle class ok, I only point you to the words of John F. Kennedy, \\"If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich\\".  If you don't like communism or dictatorships, then support social programs that give the poor an opportunity to become middle class.  I can point to example after example of countries where the wealthy took more and more and gave no opportunity to the poor that eventually had the poor take over and end up with a dictatoral communist country that was far worse than a democratic republic with good regulations on business and robust social programs.
B00006J9OT|5.0|This CD is sensational!!!!  I have most of the tracks on other CDs of hers, but this is the very best.  She sings with more conviction and confidence.  Her vocals are so much 'fuller'than the orginals.  Her instrumentals have more detail ..... sound is terrific.  It is a wonderful tape to own if you know her music or not! I highly recommend it and am purchasing it for close friends who enjoy her talent and the soft jazz sound!!
B000SFJWLU|5.0|The Way Of The Fist by the band Five Finger Death Punch truely lives up to it's namesake. An album of kickass metal from 5 talented musicians who all hail from previous bands really hits you hard and gets you hooked instantly. The stage performance these guys bring is out of this world. They're all very humble and personal with their fans and don't forget them in the least. The lyrics and vocals from Ivan Moody are raw, powerful and beautiful in their own ways. Definitely recommended to everyone with a good taste of music that loves metal. The best album to hit the shelves in quite some time. It takes 5 fingers to make a fist.
B00005JPRD|5.0|I saw this movie yesterday and was blown away. I'm no movie critic, but as an old Beatles fan, I just loved the way this movie was put together using their music. GO SEE IT! While it's still in theaters if possible.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Well, I have always been told this movie was a classic but this is the first time I have ever sat down to watch it. I was taken aback by just how compelling it was. I must say that its reputation is well-deserved. Yes, Henry Fonda is outstanding, but John Carradine's Jim Casey was the most unforgettable character. This is allegory at its finest and its practice may be something that the average is incapable of nowadays. The Grapes of Wrath is considered Steinbeck's most important novel, but, even if it wasn't, the plot fits the big screen in the manner of building size saran wrap. All of the emotion the author intended us to feel is conveyed by this magnificent John Ford production. Its qualities, like those of Gone with the Wind and Casablanca, are truly timeless. The people onscreen are people as opposed to ideological constructs. Here is humanity and that is why this film continues to resonate. This is one of those movies that most kids would never consent to watch, but, if they did, there is no question they would appreciate it. Bravo!
B000RJO578|3.0|Hot Fuzz has won a lot of critical acclaim. It is not the sort of film you would dislike. Simon Pegg is absolutely great as a police officer who's been transferred to a small town in England from London. He is a thorough professional and takes his job a tad too seriously but he's stuck in a peace loving place like Sandford. At Sandford (small town) , he manages to find a few clues here and there as to murders which are made to look like accidents. The film is really fast because there are many one second shots and the movie dictates it's own pace. It is a good watch for almost all kinds of viewers. However, I felt the film was a tad too self indulgent in terms of it's comical structure. There are no overtly funny scenes because the storyline doesn't leave much room for humor. Humor is however squeezed out, almost cheesy sometimes. This is not a bad film, just isn't a standout either. One might disagree but \\"Death Proof\\" is my film of the year. Watch that.
0525476881|5.0|\\"An Abundance of Katherines'\\" is the kind of quirky young adult novel I find delightful.  The main character, Colin, was a child prodigy.  Now he's a teenager and wondering how to make his mark in the world.   He also has a penchant for falling in love with girls named Katherine, and the girls named Katherine always dump him.  His best friend, Hassan, trying to get him out of his funk after being dumped by Katharine #19, suggests a road trip. And the road trip leads them to Gutshot, Tennessee, the improbable resting place of the Archduke Ferdinand.      In Gutshot, both boys get a job and decide to stay for awhile.  This decision leads to some hilarious moments and even a little romance.  For those of us who like \\"Eureka moments,\\" both Colin and Hassan have real moments of clarification, where they discover some interesting things about themselves and life.  Okay, there are equations in the book, but rest assured that you don't need to understand them.  In my opinion, skimming is acceptable, and you won't miss anything important.  Don't let the Math put you off; this is a road trip that was fun to take.

B000UR366S|1.0|I'm a huge Joni fan. Not of her generation, but not in my 20s either. She is one of the finest composers and lyricists of the 20th century. But this is the 21st century...    I had to buy this album, how could I not?    The opener is a gorgeous instrumental with chord changes that gave me the chills. A bit long, a bit repetitive, but still, I loved it.    Now, I know Joni has smoked since she was a kid and her voice has suffered greatly for that. It's hard for her to hold a note, which can be painful to listen to. On this album, she may have ditched the cigs for a while: she doesn't sound quite as hoarse as I had feared.    She's got ex-hubby Larry Klein on bass, Brian Blades on drums, she plays guitar and piano herself. How could she go wrong?     Well, she did.    The lyrics are some of the worst I have yet to read from a major artist.  I found it hard to believe they were hers. Trite save-Mother-Earth-pleas, unimaginative lines with very few exceptions. Worst of all: boring as hell: it was hard to read them all.    The music sounds a bit like her late 80's album \\"Chalkmark in a Rainstorm\\", but without the passion or interesting arrangements. Mosts tracks are slow tempo, a few uptempo. Best one hands down is surprisingly one of the uptempo tracks, which also has the best lyrics and title: \\"Night of the Iguana\\": latin rhythms with supertight sublime drumming by Blade, thumping bass by Klein and some fab guitar shredding by Joni.     The cover is godawful: ballet butts in tights - apparently dancers from a production in Canada. Joni did the packaging herself. Ouch. One cool photo inside of a ballerina standing under a street light, but what's the connection to the album?  No idea.    Prince's latest album is a huge disappointment. And now this?  My heart is breaking like a twig.  What's going on?  Are our premiere musical artists running out of ideas or just getting lazy? Beats me, but it's too bad the rest of us have to suffer after shelling out good money.     Back to the drawing board, Joni.    NOTE:  Joni talks so much about Mother Earth this and Mother Earth that on this album. I find it a little ironic that she then picked Starbucks/Hear Music to release her CD. Some of the crap found in the landfills, in the street, on the beach and in the ocean are..... Starbucks coffee cups. Maybe not styrofoam and maybe partly made from recycled material, but still.
B000A78Z82|3.0|The major-label debut of an artist with rising popularity is no small deal. It just might make all the difference. This album, seemed to be a success for Banhart both musically and commercially. Hell, it was the first time I've ever heard of him. I'd think many others may say the same.     The music keeps you entertained, but it does seem that Devendra still has some exploring to do musically. It seems like he has to find himself, without getting lost, which certainly can be a hard thing to do.     Not every song on this album seems to be played to it's fullest. The album as a whole is a bit sloppy, but there are many parts where Devendra shines through his teeth.     A Devendra fan will surely love this album, a folk fan would appreciate it, but I feel Devendra as better things in store for us.
0743486285|5.0|What a book. It's sad, depressing, funny, entertaining and enlightening. It's truly amazing that someone can survive all he put himself through to be able to tell his story. The best aspect of the book is that those close to him (if that's even possible) told their experiences with this addicted paranoid rock star. If you liked The Dirt, you'll love The Heroin Diaries. A must read for any Motley Crue fan.
0142004235|5.0|This book is a 600 page masterpiece. This book grabbed my attention from start to finish. I read it in 1 week. It did get a little slow during the middle of the book. But I feel Steinbeck wrote that in as a plateau for such a mountain of a book. He is a true artist with every word & sentence. He draw's the scene out with a paint brush with fine brush strokes. Then when the scene is finished. He let's the great character's speak. They speak with true life meanings and lessons. I stopped reading for many years and this book is going to inspire me to keep reading for the rest of my life. But I don't think any book will live up to the masterpiece of this book. I will probally compare the rest of my readings to this book and find nothing will compare to it. I will surely read everything he has wrote and find joy in each one.
B000UJ48U4|4.0|1999...a great year for films.  The Straight Story, Fight Club, and The Sixth Sense were released that year. And this one, the swansong from Stanley Kubrick.  I was so excited when this film was announced.  I counted the days (even taking off July 16th, 1999) so I could see it on its opening day. I have never done that with a film.  I am a massive Kubrick fan, and I could barely sleep the week this film was released. Seeing the opening credits have me fidgeting in my seat. And seeing \\"a film by Stanley Kubrick\\" was heartwarming.  And I wasn't disappointed. Again, even after his death, Mr. Kubrick managed to confound expectations yet again. Why did people hate this film? Pacing, no really hot sex, slow, long....I don't know.  All I know is that I loved it, and it's one of Kubrick's best.  He really creates a great dreamlike atmosphere that creates a sense of dread and claustrophobia.  The pacing is very slow, which was really bold in 1999.<br /><br />There were some people who felt the film was dated in its attitude towards the war between the sexes.  It isn't.  It's a universal struggle, and that there will always be conflict between men and women.  This is one of Kubrick's most visually stunning films, shot mostly in primary colors.  There are 4 sequences that equal the great sequences in other Kubrick films.  First, the opening party sequence is gorgeously shot and edited, the orgy scene, the scene in the hotel with Alan Cumming majorly flirting with Cruise (it's absolutely hilarious), and the climatic scene between Cruise and Pollack.  These 4 scenes are quite long, but they are so well put together and really create a tension (especially the Cruise/Pollack one) that transfixes you.  As for the controversy as to whether this film is actually Kubrick's final cut, it is.  I recently saw Leon Vitali, Kubrick's long time assistant, at the Lincoln Center in NYC and he said this was the final cut of the film.  Aside from the digital figures inserted into the film to avoid the NC-17 rating, it wasn't altered in any way.  Reportedly, this new 2 disc edition is the NC-17, unaltered director's cut of the film, which is a wonderful development (I have seen the unaltered orgy sequence before, and the digital figures are annoying in the censored version).  The cut that Terry Semel, Bob Daly, Tom Cruise, and Nicole Kidman saw 4 days before Stanley died was the film he wanted to be played in cinemas.  I have seen this film many times, and it gets better every time I see it.  It will be re-evaluated soon.e NC-17 rating, it wasn't altered in any way.

B000H7JD4A|5.0|When a band comes to a certain age, their longtime fans usually expect one of two things: The band will be going through the motions, and release decent albums much like a person clocks in and out of a job, but they will never do anything groundbreaking or classic. In the case of Iron Maiden, it took them nearly two decades to come up with something on the par of Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.<br /><br />I usually judge albums as a collection of songs. If some of the songs don't hit me as hard as the other ones, or they drag down the album a bit I refer to them as \\"filler\\". Being as Iron Maiden's albums have had filler No Prayer For The Dying on, I was unexpectedly surprised by this one: NO FILLER. Nothing qualifies as a bad song. Of course I like some songs more than others, but the QUALITY of the songwriting and musicianship is at such a consistent level, that this is truly the comeback 7 years in the making (after the reunion).<br /><br />Now enough accolades and on to the music. The only thing that sort of qualifies as filler is the beginning track. Its the \\"Wickerman\\" of the album, or to look back at Manowar's Into Glory Ride, this would be its \\"Warlord\\". Its a good song, nevertheless, but doesn't really fit amongst the other ones.<br /><br />Now on to the rest: Most of the songs DO follow a formula. Its kind of extrapolated from the \\"X-Factor\\" formula, that is a slow buildup to a heavier part that climaxes. These \\"climaxes\\" though are part of what make the album brilliant. For example in These Colors Don't Run, it goes to a full on progressive part in the solo section, and then comes back for the chorus. Its kind of like a tootsie pop, the outer edge has the center that is a tootsie roll, but instead of a tootsie roll, its a \\"prog\\" roll.<br /><br />Pretty cool analogy, eh?<br /><br />Anyway, the songs feature some of the best riffs and melodies Maiden's had for years. The Pilgrim is one of the greatest songs Janick Gers has been a part of, complete with its phrygian middle eastern scale section. \\"Brighter than a Thousand Suns\\" marks the first time Maiden has approached thrash metal, but its done in a way that doesn't betray the style they're going for. The Reincarnation of Benjamin Brigg is a dark, heavy emotional song, the subject matter that we will probably find out more about on subsequent albums. \\"Lord of Light\\" is all over the place, some Sabbath \\"evil riffs\\" in the middle, a synth guitar solo courtesy of Smith, and more. And these are just some of the highlights. The Legacy features Maiden sounding like Harris's inspiration Genesis moreso than any other song they've ever done. Its weird angular progressive riff is the closest they've come to Dream Theater, period.<br /><br />The lyrics are deep and moving, similar to the X-Factor's war themes but with some spiritual and occult themes thrown in as well.<br /><br />Overall, I congratulate my favorite band of all time for surpassing every album they've made since Seventh Son, and for making a true classic metal album in the year 2006. An amazing album.<br /><br />One more thing: The recording and production is the most natural production I've heard on a recent album. They decided to go against modern production values (again, The Loudness War articles on the internet would explain more), and go for a natural dynamic feel with regards to the production. It only brings out the dynamics and flow of the album more.ghter than a Thousand Suns\\" marks the first time Maiden has approached thrash metal, but its done in a way that doesn't betray the style they're going for.

630587493X|1.0|I have always hated the concept of machine taking over man. In this movie Machine tries to marry human? I thought that they would have created a female robot for William? I had nightmares about the concept of robot marrying human afterwards. When they finally grant him \\"Human Citizenship\\" I was a little freaked out.
B000063DHL|5.0|Somewhere in Time is not a \\"concept\\" album like its follow-up, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, but its comes close at times (ha, get it). Anyway, this is an album that originally (upon release) caused some casternation among some longtime fans. In were keyboards (well in this case guitar synths, same difference), and out was the statement in the linear notes of Piece of Mind; \\"no synths or ulterior motives\\". However, unlike bands such as Judas Priest, etc, their journey through the realm of technology wasn't motivated by some \\"streamlining\\" of their sound at all, and even if it were, it certainly didn't turn out that way. One of the greatest things about this album was Adrian Smith's maturing as a player and songwriter. Some of his greatest songs (Stranger in a Strange Land) and solos (practically every song) are found on the album.<br /><br />In regards to the music itself, Prog Rock influences permeate much of the album. They're subtle, but they are definitely there (making Iron Maiden a \\"precursor\\" to prog metal, as controversial as the statement may be). For example, the rhythmic structure of the beginning of Heaven Can Wait is somewhat similar to Genesis's Watcher in the Skies (I wonder if anyone else has noticed the similarity, and being as Steve Harris practically worships at the 70's Genesis altar, I can see how the influence can come into play). Also, Stranger in a Strange Land has some similarity with latter day Pink Floyd, especially come solo time with its solos complete with a wash of delay and reverb (Adrian Smith's MASTERPIECE in my opinion)- it reminds me of the rhythm of Floyd's Young Lust, with much more atmosphere. Speaking of atmosphere, I don't think there are many 80's metal albums with such a dreamy, futuristic feel as this album. The synths serve the album well and take one to a faraway place. \\"Time\\" definitely permeates the lyrics, from the title track to Heaven Can Wait, to Wasted Years. \\"Deja Vu\\" fits the \\"time\\" concept as well, and Alexander The Great covers History like only Iron Maiden can do. Alexander the Great features, among other things, some great progressive time changes, odd timings, clean guitars with a \\"bolero\\" style buildup, and some great modal interplay. In other words, I take back any statement that Iron Maiden aren't progressive metal. They helped create the genre with this release and having already conquered the world of metal, they conquered the world of Progressive \\"thinking person's\\" metal with this album.<br />Songwriting: I have to say this album's songwriting demolishes most of the other albums. Its hard to say which Maidens are my favorite, but this is definitely in the top 3 or 4.<br /><br />My fave album cover of theirs as well.eat covers History like only Iron Maiden can do.

B000002I53|5.0|A 1961 release which featured pianist McCoy Tyner and Elvin Jones as drummer working with Coltrane for the first time. Steve Davis on bass was later replaced by Reggie Workman to form the famous quartet of Coltrane's. This is one of the seminal works in Coltrane's portfolio, not as revered as A LOVE SUPREME but as a personal favorite I enjoy this one more then any Coltrane release. While his version of SUMMERTIME is not as exotic as Miles Davis version which just bleeds passion, Coltrane's version of MY FAVORITE THINGS is one of my favorite jazz recordings. It is so smooth and enjoyable, I can listen to it over and over.

0646418432|4.0|The Mysterious Affair at Styles was the first novel to introduce the great Hercule Poirot to the world. It also introduced Arthur Hastings, who appears in a number of other Poirot novels. The story begins with Hastings arriving at Styles Court to visit an old friend and his family. While he is at the estate, the Mistress of the house is killed. By a lucky coincidence, Poirot is in the nearby village and free to investigate the matter. The cast of suspects is largely drawn from the woman's family. Poirot interviews them all in his unique style and his little grey cells are put to the test as he attempts to untangle the mystery as many twists and turns ensue.     Because this is the first Poirot novel, you might expect that it would be lacking compared to the later efforts. It is often the case that characters become better developed in later stories, for example. In this case, you will find a very typical Poirot novel, with no real evidence that Christie hadn't yet found his voice. His little witticisms and eccentricities are present, the upper class suspects, the relatively remote \\"bottle\\" location for the murder... all of these are typical elements in a Hercule Poirot novel and all are well executed. Once the story gets going, it moves along very well and the mystery certainly held my attention to the very end. The suspects were all pretty interesting and Poirot himself is pure gold. The only sour note for me was Hastings who is a bit too dense for my taste as well as being too pure of a Dr. Watson clone.     Overall, The Mysterious Affair at Styles is well worth reading. If it isn't the best Poirot story, it is still far from the worst. While I might recommend a first time Christie reader to look elsewhere [[ASIN:1579126898 Death on the Nile: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Hercule Poirot Mysteries)]], or [[ASIN:1579126286 Evil Under the Sun: A Hercule Poirot Mystery]], this is definitely worth trying for those who have read several Poirot novels and are looking for their latest fix of the little Belgian.
B00005JCA9|4.0|What would you do if the world's most famous movie star walked through your door and the two of you fell madly in love with each other? That's the question, screen writer, Richard Curtis (\\"Love Actually\\", \\"Bridget Jones'Diary\\") attempts to answer in the light-hearted, 1999 film, \\"Notting Hill\\".<br /><br />For those who don't know, Richard Curtis is the King of the 'Romantic Brit-Com', genre. This is a genre of usually small budget, comedic films that are about the romantic lives of good looking Brits (usually with a close group of witty, quirky, supportive friends), who must overcome self-doubt and bad timing to make true love happen. A good number of these movies star Hugh Grant and have been written (and sometimes directed) by Mr.Curtis.<br /><br />In this romatic comedy the setting is the trendy, old London neighborhood of Notting Hill. The streets are filled with vendors and lined with interesting little shops. William Thacker (Hugh Grant) runs a tiny, dusty book store, that sells only travel books. Both William's professional and romantic life seems stagnant and on hold. That is until  movie superstar, Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) discreetly pokes her head into his shop. At first Anna seems wary of William. But soon the two can't deny that they have a definite attraction for each other. The film follows over a period of time, Anna popping in and out of William's life. The pressures and circumstances of stardom & celebrity always seeming to get in the way, leaving poor William's romantic hopes dashed. Luckily he has a group of witty, quirky, supportive friends to get him through the tough times. Can't an ordinary fellow have a romantic relationship with the world's most famous movie star?<br /><br />As Richard Curtis' romantic Brit-coms go, \\"Notting Hill\\" is a pleasent film that will keep you entertained. In a small way the film is close in both story structure and character motivations to Curtis' first big hit \\"Four Weddings & A Funeral\\".(A love lorn Brit who can't romatically get it together with an American Woman, but luckily is supported by quirky, witty, friends, who have there own mini-dramas) The big difference between the two films is \\" Notting Hill's\\" look at celebrity life and pressures.<br /><br />What really keeps the film going is both Curtis' trade mark of writing  good, endearing characters and the film's talented cast. Hugh Grant is excellent presenting a quiet, melancholy, exasperation of an unfullfilled love life. It may be type casting and not much of a stretch, but Julia Roberts as the world's most famous movie star is just perfect. She's gives a good performance making you want to believe that Anna is not only a self-obsessed celebrity, but every once in a while, \\"just a girl, standing in front of boy, asking him to love her\\".<br /><br />This is one of those films, where the supporting players really do help make it a success. There are wonderful performances from Rhys Ifans, Emma Chambers, Tim McInnerny, Gina Mckee, Hugh Bonneville and James Dreyfus. If you are in any way a fan of British film & television, then you will recognize the faces of these hilarious character actors.<br /><br />In the end \\"Notting Hill\\" turns out to be nothing more than a good old fashion love story, that has excellent characters , wonderful performances and some good laughs. Highly recommended!ogether with an American Woman, but luckily is supported by quirky, witty, friends, who have there own mini-dramas) The big difference between the two films is \\" Notting Hill's\\" look at celebrity life and pressures.

0425129608|5.0|Evil Under the Sun takes place at a secluded seaside resort in England. Arlena Stuart Marshall, is young and beautiful and one of those Agatha Christie characters who seems to inspire all she meets to wish her dead. So it is small surprise when she is killed and none other than Hercule Poirot is called upon to solve the case using little more than his famous little grey cells.     This is a very typical Christie novel in many ways. It happens in a \\"bottle\\" environment where no one else comes and goes, it has an eclectic cast of characters almost all of whom seem to have a motive, and the crime seems impossible to solve. It is, however, different from many of Dame Agatha's works in the sense that it is executed so very well. Not to say that most of her novels are poor, but this one really shines. The suspects are both interesting and entertaining. Poirot is at his best as he works through things in his fashion with his little remarks raining dry humor at just the right moments. And the mystery itself definitely kept me engaged from start to finish.     I've read a number of Hercule Poirot novels, and found some very good and a few not so good. Evil Under the Sun is an excellent mystery novel that I would recommend as a great starting point to readers new to Agatha Christie as well as established fans of her work. It's both funny and compelling and features one of the great fictional detectives at his very best.

All songs were beautifully written with honesty and paired together with beautifully meaningful lyrics.<br /><br />  I definitely like the way Annie did the vocal arrangements on each track. Her voice is still soulful and what makes this cd brilliant is, this time, it feels like as if her voice itself was dancing on groovy tracks and weeping when the ballads arrive.<br /><br />  This cd is definitely best heard with \\"Diva\\" , her first album. Why? Just because.

B000UOOT1W|4.0|The new 'greatest' by Santana sounds outstanding--crystal-clear and pulsing with energy and sound.  The standards are on here, and they sound great.  However, I do not think this collection represents the best of Santana.  There is too much of his newer (collaborative) material, and while I enjoy the new songs, they are not as strong as his early music.  While this is ultimately a satisfying album, I would not consider it the definitive collection of the Great Carlos Santana's works.<br /><br />Four stars.  Good, not great.
1881273156|3.0|The Five Love Languages, by Dr. Gary Chapman is a good, practical, and helpful book in the arena of communication in marriage. It is very good at helping people to see the way their spouse is wired, and how make inroads to communicate in a way that the spouse understands affection. The five \\"love languages\\" that Chapman asserts are Quality Time, Physical Touch, Acts of Service, Recieving Gifts, and Words of Affirmation. Perhaps the greatest aspect of this book is Chapman's explanation of the \\"in love\\" and \\"out of love\\" stage that most in the world today seek after. He shows that this isn't true \\"love\\" at all, but rather a temporary lust. While I have experientially seen first-hand a great improvement in my own marriage from the application of certian principles in Chapman's theory, I do see major weaknesses as well.  The most disappointing issue I see with The Five Love Languages is that from a Christian standpoint, and as a conservative Christian author, Chapman misses the best think he could share in a published work-- God's Word. Biblical references are almost non-existant in this book. Furthermore, God gives clear commands and guidelines in His Word for the basis of marriage and the roles that the husband and the wife are supposed to play. In addition, while Chapman is good at helping people express affection to one another, this is not truly, \\"Love\\" in Biblical terms, because those without the Holy Spirit to produce the Spiritual fruit of \\"Love\\" (Galatians 5:22), cannot do this at all. The greatest downfall to Chapman's book is that he never takes the opporunity to share that the greatest problem with marriage is sin, and separation from God-- and that the greatest solution starts not with commuicating better or helping your spouse feel \\"loved,\\" but by a saving relationship with Jesus Christ as Lord of your life, and Lord of your marriage. In the end Chapman covertly shares his personal faith walk, but missed the perfect opportunity to clearly share the best thing that could transform not only marriage, but a person's life forever.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Rob Marshall and company got it exactly right in transferring Chicago to the screen. Though I was not a Renee Zellweiger fan, she changed my opinion with her total tartiness here (and she was terrific in Cold Mountain), she dances competently, and sings the role wonderfully. Katherine Zeta Jones was perfect as Velma Kelly. The rest of the cast are marvelous too....Queen Latifah coudn't have been better cast. Though I have never been conviced of Richard Gere's acting ability, he pulls off the role of Billy Flynn admirably, even his singing and dancing work effectively. They brilliantly wrote a screenplay to encompass most of the stage show, where songs were cut, they needed to be. A well deserved Oscar winner for effectively bringing a musical back to the screen!!

I would highly recommend this book as well as \\"The Five Love Languages for Couples\\" for ANYONE who would like to improve any reltionships in their life.  Understanding exactl what it is that makes us feel loved and also identifying what makes others feel loved is a wonderful and fulfilling experience and has helped to enhance all my relationships, even those I did not believe needed improving to begin with.

1416911049|5.0|I was blown away by this book, and will be recommending it to all readers I know with anything in common with my tastes.  Part of its impact on me is due to the low/moderate expectations I set out with. I'll also be singing its praises to younger readers, especially my nieces and other young girls (not excluding boys - but the body image themes are often more relevant to young women.  Research shoes that this is changing dramatically to include men, however).<br />I'm an adult reader who likes a bit of a challenge, so I must admit to needing to adjust my expectations a little bit - but that became very comfortable in a short time. A book to really settle into and live in for a while.  The advanced and mature themes are as sublime as any I've encountered in other reading - and it would be a real boost for the culture if this book continued to gain popularity.<br />Light sci-fi, beautifully written characters. 5 stars from me.
B000E1155E|4.0|one of the better new albums i've gotten recently. a couple of the riffs in these songs sound hugely familiar, but i can't place what i think they're similar to. i hear a bit of Franz Ferdinand in here, and a few other things as well, but if their sound isn't entirely unique it is quite good: catchy, rough-edged, solid, and i do have to say i love the singer's voice.

I am not a religious person and I have to admit that when I originally received this book as a birthday present, the \\"Pray\\" part of the title landed the book at the bottom of my to read pile.  What a perfect example of why you shoudn't \\"judge a book by it's cover\\".  Elizabeth is funny and completely relatable.

B000NA77YO|4.0|When you hear Black Sabbath, the first thing that will come to your mind will be Ozzy. And rightly so. Having said that, Sabbath w/o Ozzy was the best thing that could've happened to both sides. And I always thought the Dio era was better than the Sabbath era. I bought this cd when it first came out, so I'll make this short and sweet, this cd would've gotten 5 stars if not for the following:<br /><br />1-Sabbath should've released the Dio Years as a box set as originally intended. Forcing me to go out and buy Dehumanizer (their best), Mob Rules, and Heaven Hell<br /><br />2-Why they chose Falling Off The Edge of the World instead of Sign of the Southern Cross is a mystery to me. Poor choice, seeing as how I really didn't care for The Mob Rules, but Sign of the Southern Cross really made The Mob Rules standout. Also, three songs from Dehumanizer? C'mon, how could they not include Computer God and Too Late? Not that I'm not complaining about the choices from Dehumanizer as those were better choices than the ones they made for Mob, but could've added a few more.<br /><br />3-After hearing the new songs, it's obvious that Dio and Sabbath couldn't really recaputre the magic they had with Dehumanizer. And if they were to ever do a new album, I would buy it, but with reservation. Another reviewer mentioned that we can finally get out the shadow of the Ozzy era, that reviewer was right. Sabbath was a lot heavier with Dio, and the song writing killed. And listening to The Dio Years, w/the exception of I, Dio can sing the Ozzy era stuff with no problem. Can't say the same for Ozz.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|This CD is incredible.  It's no doubt one of his best.  Brad always tells the best stories. If I could keep only 10 CDs in my collection, this would qualify.  I love his song ONLINE.

B000O75F7C|5.0|PT appeals to different people for different reasons. And different PT CDs appeal to different people for different reasons. But this is the third CD in a row -- after \\"In Absentia\\" and \\"Deadwing\\" -- that I think is a very fine effort. Steven Wilson and his band make some quality music that can appeal to far more than just fans of prog-rock. Call it \\"pop-prog\\" if you will. It's very listenable, very accessible, and yet has a lot of the little things that I look for in prog: extended pieces that are not boring because they contain enough surprises and clever turns to keep me interested.
0743486285|5.0|I am and was always a fan of Nikki from the early days of MOTLEY CRUE to his other solo projects. I was in the Hollywood scene around 1990-91 and to be honest none of us were naive to what was happening, but I will say I had NO idea the scale of the problems. This book ZAPS you back to those days of debauchery, and MAKES you remember how it actually felt to be whacked out of your skull. This is a very sobering book, and the fact that Nikki is so forthcoming about his experiences shows just how much he wants to try to help anyone from going down that dark ugly road.

B000TJBNFI|5.0|In my opinion The Shining is the greatest of all Stephen King adaptations and then Misery.  There are actually a lot of similarities between Misery and The Shining.  There both about writers, in secluded locations, who are deserted at some point due to a snow storm.  They both have characters that aren't all there mentally and we are witness to their descent into madness and loss of reality.  Both Bates and Nicholson have a way with tools, whether it be an axe or a sledge hammer, and with these tools they have cut and hobbled their way into our memories and into film history.    Kathy Bates is the star of this film and deserves her Oscar win as the at times lovable Annie Wilkes, the obsessed fan of author Paul Sheldon played by James Caan.  Annie goes from saving Paul to keeping him hostage for her own agenda.  The \\"shining\\" beacon of this film is without a doubt Kathy Bates who for me is one of the most memorable and witty villains of modern horror film up there with Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.  With that said Caan is there like a dance partner for Bates every step of the way, he is like John Stockton to her Karl Malone always ready to assist her in enhancing the dark comedy throughout with his reactions by facial expression or perfect delivery of his lines.  Caan's non verbal reactions to Annie's tirades are priceless and only enhance her dialouge.  Pay attention to Caan's facial expressions during the scene when Annie explains about \\"chapter plays\\" and don't call them cliffhangers.    So getting back to the king and queen of horror, I had an idea, what if Bate's character Annie Wilkes had rescued/kidnapped Jack Nicholson's character Jack Torrance and what would that dialouge be like.  I think it would go something like this:    JACK:  \\"Annie, let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration. You're distracting me. And it will then take me time to get back to where I was. You understand?\\"   ANNIE:  \\"Understand? UNDERSTAND? I will tell you \\"what I understand!\\" I go out of my way for you! I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you, and what thanks do I get? \\"Oh, you bought the wrong paper, Annie, I can't write on this paper, Annie!\\" Well, I'll get your stupid paper but you just better start showing me a little appreciation around here, Mr. MAN!\\"  JACK:  \\"Now, we're going to make a new rule. When you come in here and you hear me typing  [types]  or whether you DON'T hear me typing, or whatever the F you hear me doing; when I'm in here, it means that I am working, THAT means don't come in. Now, do you think you can handle that?\\"  ANNIE:  \\"I thought you were good Jack... but you're not good. You're just another lying ol' dirty birdy.\\"    Just a thought, forgive me for prattling away and making everything all oogy, here's the dvd features.    COLLECTOR'S EDITION DVD FEATURES:  (A reviewer listed them above but in case they got lost in the review shuffle here they are again)  First if your like me and like a nice pristine transfer and good sound the dvd is a definite and worthwhile upgrade.  The picture quality far surpassed the older version on dvd and I own both.  Also on the sound there was no Dolby Digital 5.1 on the old version and on the Collector's edition there is.  SPECIAL FEATURES:  Audio Commnt by Rob Reiner and screenwriter William Goldman  Misery loves company featurette, Marc Shaiman's musical Misery tour featurette  Diagnosing Annie Wilkes featurette, Advice for stalked feature, profile of a stalker feature, celebrity stalker feature and anti stalking laws feature.    This is a must for any horror fan to add to their collection.  It is already a classic and is the type of horror that gives you that warm, glad to be inside, tucked into bed feeling if you can avoid getting hobbled.    A great watch for Halloween.  Enjoy!

0743298039|5.0|It's wonderful to find a book that you read and enjoy purely for the story being told.  There are no self-help hints; no underlying messages about politics, the environment or the decay of society; no theories about religious wherefores or arguments about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin - just a great gothic tale told in a modern day setting that kept me engaged until the very end.    Diane Sutterfield's debut novel  centers on the lives of two women:  Vida Winter, a famous writer who is nearing the end of her life, and Margaret Lea, an amateur  biographer, who is summoned by Vida  so that she can at long last tell the true story of her life.  Up to that point Vida has told curious interviewers each a different story of her life - all tall tales -- but Margaret insists, as a biographer, on the facts.  What evolves is the telling of two lives because as we learn about Vida, the story of Margaret's life also unfolds.      The novel, while not a literary masterpiece, is remarkably well written in that the reader is drawn into the room for each story telling session.  Vida being old and of ill health, her sessions with her biographer are limited in duration.  I felt as though I had taken a comfy overstuffed chair in a dark corner and was right there in the room  when the two women were together.  It was easy to be drawn into the story and I willingly and eagerly went with Margaret as she traveled from Vida's home to her father's rare book store and back again.  The characters are so well developed that you feel as though you know them both very well.  The story takes many twists and turns, but the progress of the plot is well thought out and thoroughly readable and believable.     If you enjoy a great read and a well told story, then The Thirteenth Tale is a must.  For greater enjoyment, choose your time and place keeping in mind that this book is best read with long spans of uninterrupted time and a warm fire and glass of good wine optional.      I'm notyet convinced that there is at least one great novel waiting in each and every one of us, but Diane Sutterfield certainly proved this true for her and I know others join me in hoping there are at least a dozen more tales for her to tell.
B000V7B90C|3.0|I have to say, this was a major disappointment.  Let's put aside the fact that you cannot get any AC/DC in digital format like Itunes, napster, etc so we have to buy the stuff in the store.  So no Dolby?    What about the fact that I cannot play the darn thing in my computer's DVD player!!!!! Is there some type of cripple on it to prevent this?    IS anyone else having problems?

1428156585|5.0|In her own words you hear the author, Ayann Hirsi (Magan) Ali relate to you her life story with the passion and emotion that can only come from having lived it.  It is a brutally honest portrayal of life as a woman raise in a Muslim society.  What impressed me the most was how totally different and isolated her life was growing up in Somalia and Kenya from my western way of life.  Clitoral excision; covering your body from head-to-toe lest you inflame male desires; submitting to the males in you family in all matters, including arranged marriages; all part of the daily life of an Islamic woman.  Add to that beatings from her mother whenever she dared to question their ways and you have a compelling look into the life of one of the most oppressed groups of people on the planet.<br /><br />I suspect if you were to ask Ayaan, she would say she had no choice but to seek asylum as a refugee in Holland, but everyday Muslim women around the world accept their lot to live this kind of life.  Her bravery is inspiring, and I am grateful that she chose to share her story so that westerners like me can better understand a Muslim's way of life and the differences that separate their beliefs from Christian beliefs.  Yet, I also take heart to know that we share many of the same values, concerns, and desires.  She is someone I could easily befriend.
B00005JPWF|5.0|I saw this movie expecting something good but when you have a movie based on a true story,an american ACTOR directing (and wrote the screenplay) whom is pretty 'hollywood' you can't expect a masterpeice, but it was! i recomend this movie to exeryone,this one is sure to become a classic and the young actor who plays the main character is sure to remember this as his breakout role. this movie is an oscar winner for sure!
B000H305U0|4.0|He was hot in 2006. So hot, that we all got sick and tired of seeing him and hearing Sexy Back and What Goes Around... every day, twice a day (or more) during the summer and fall of 2006. Trust me, I was so sick of him, I thought that the overexposure would never ever end. And I'm right. He's still burning strong.<br /><br />I actually respected him for making the album Justified, because his vocals were smooth and the production was fun, yet laid back.<br /><br />What do I honestly think about his latest outing, FS/LS?<br /><br />Not much.<br /><br />Here is the short version of what I think of this CD:<br /><br />Overrated, over-bloated, less R&B-inspired than his first (which is a shame) and quite trite. Some of the songs are passable, and his voice is nice and pleasant like I noted earlier but overall, I wasn't feeling it.<br /><br />Here's the longer version, for all of you with a decent attention span:<br /><br />FutureSex / LoveSounds: Bouncy production, and sexy, sexy vocals. Has a been-there-done-that feel. :-/ 7/10<br />SexyBack: Never ever really liked this song, and thought it was a tacky first single, at best. There are worse songs though. 6/10<br />Sexy Ladies / Let Me Talk To You Prelude: Bland. 5.25/10<br />My Love Feat. T.I. The second single off the album. Both dudes are attractive, but only one holds any talent. You can guess who that is! 8.25/10<br />LoveStoned / I Think She Knows Interlude: Decent vocals, and the lyrics are passable. 6.75/10<br />What Goes Around... / ...Comes Around Interlude: I didn't like the video, but this isn't the video. It's the song. It was the third single released, and probably did very well. Nice lyrics, and I love the switch in sound it makes at the 5:22 mark. Second best track on the album, and the best song he released from FS/LS with a video. 8.5/10<br /><br />Chop Me Up: The name of the song probably speaks volumes about the substance and depth of this particular track. Not my favorite by a long shot, but all I have to do is turn it to my favorite radio station to hear a Rap song way worse than this. Doesn't make this much better however! 6.25/10<br />Damn Girl Feat. Timbaland: Nice beat. Lyrics are lacking though. But this is for sure; if Timberlake ever produced a \\"throwback\\" this is it. Should have been a single. It would've been rather huge!! 7.75/10<br />Summer Love / Set The Mood Prelude: Repetitive, but again nice beat. 7/10<br />Until The End Of Time: Probably his greatest song ever!! Has an old school R&B feel to it. Nice bass, but not overdone. Is it a ballad? Maybe, but either way it is awesome in more ways than one! To be very honest, if this was the last track (which I wish it was) it would've left you saying, \\"Damn. I want more Justin!\\" And you would probably have played the CD again, or at least put that song on for an hour or three! 10.5/10<br />Losing My Way: I never got into this song until now. Lyrics are solid and very, VERY real. Could've done without the choir though; that was over the top. 8.25/10<br />(Another Song) All Over Again: Guess I was wrong. This is simply the most old-school soul-ish (that's right, I said SOUL) composition this beaut has ever written. It's just simply beautiful! I never would've expected something like this out of him!! Especially on a CD titled, FutureSex/Love Sounds! I guess this CD ain't as bad as I initially thought. 12/10<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't be embarrassed to purchase this CD because the last song is in my top 10 favorite songs EVER! I think it's probably in my top 3 greatest love songs EVER!<br /><br />And this is the guy who said that this CD wasn't worth much! Goes to show you I was proved wrong! And I'm glad!!<br /><br />I never want the music I listen to to suck!!<br /><br />Vocals: 7/10<br />Writing: 5.5/10 (11/10 for Another Song (All Over Again))<br />Production: 8/10<br />Overall: 7.916666666666667<br /><br />3.9583333333333335 = 4 stars.<br /><br />OMG. 4 stars? I just gave Justin 4 stars for thisrelease!<br /><br />Wow...<br /><br />Um. Well, I guess Until The End Of Time and Another Song (All Over Again) made that happen!<br /><br />4 stars. Even I can't believe it!
B00005JPRD|5.0|This movie is simply amazing!The way the songs of the beatles are used,aspecialy 'i want you(she's so heavy)', in this masterpeice is imaginative,unexpected and perfect. The actors in his movie are also perfect with beautiful voices. And GREAT apearences from Joe Cocker,Bono and Salma Hyek(who plays a mini dress wearing nurse,wink wink.) I'm not a huge fan of Bono but he was the exact person to play the 'D.r'. I recomed it whole heartedly to anyone and everyone!   This movie is a futur oscar winner!   p.s. gratuitous nudity!
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|I found The Illusionist to be a clever story but Edward Norton was not the best choice for the lead.  His intense (hypnotic?) gazes were believable but I found his acting flat and uninspired.  The love scene was uninspired, but after Nicole and Jude in Cold Mountain I think the pinnacle has been reached. I would have liked to see a performer of the Illusionist's calibur more animated or intense.  Norton seemed to recite his lines rather than perform them.  Now, the supporting Paul Giamatti, did a fantastic job with his role.  Paul's subtle expressions and body language make him a sympathetic villain and believable.  I found myself wishing that Johnny Depp had played the lead.  Edward's performance in American History X and Primal Fear were his best.
0307275639|4.0|The special thing about this book was that this was the first book my teenager niece ever read. And it made her cry again and again. This got me curious and I borrowed the book and read it slowly over a week or so. As my father had also passed on recently after an illness, the story had a personal relevance for me.    The book is written in extremely simple language, and there is very little complex philosophy here. The story (apparently real) is about an aged sociology professor who is told that he is about to die due to a terminal illness. This sets him thinking - and he decides to approach his death with dignity, openness and as an essential part of living. He also decides to continue living till the very end, continuing with his profession - teaching. His last months end up as a special lesson in real life for one of his favourite students.    The book is well-written and appeals to one at an emotional level. The progress of Prof. Morrie's passing on maintains one's interest in the story - there is no other complex plot. Death is a much more frightening prospect in West, than it is in the East. It is therefore easy to see the greatness of the teaching in this book. However, some of the extra lessons (embedded in the story) are laced with a kind of rejection of modern life - some people may find this annoying.     Reading the book has a slightly negative effect, as it focuses on death and describes many of the last moments in great, personal detail. However, this also had an interesting consequence.     It led me to pick up Deepak Chopra's '[[ASIN:0307345785 Life After Death: The Burden of Proof]]' recently. I found this book to be much more healing and positive about death than 'Tuesdays with Morrie'. Where Morrie merely accepts his impending death, and tries to continue living till the end, Deepak Chopra shows an alternate approach - how to see death as a mere continuation of one's journey, may be with some extra benefits even. This is perhaps what Lord Jesus meant when he asked Judas to free him from the body that he found himself trapped in ([[ASIN:1426200420 The Gospel of Judas]]).    All in all, a good book.
1554072840|3.0|This book is just ok. It talks from the mom's point of view which I thought was strange. It is kind of graphic. My daughter did like it but the potty in the thing is shaped like some weird dish. There are better books out there.
B000007491|5.0|For those of you that do not know, Supertramp was MUCH different on this self-titled album released in 1970.  The songs here are either much heavier and rocking compared to their more commercial stuff starting a few years later, or the melodies are softer and more pleasing (in a Neil Diamond kind of way).  This album is strangely addicting in the way it blends the softer and heavier numbers without anything sounding out of place.  The album has a nice flow to it.  It's extremely melodic too.  The first time you listen to it you'll immediately pick up on the melodic ideas.  For some reason, this album has the same kind of exciting uncertainty and willingness to experiment that the Scorpions debut album \\"Lonesome Crow\\" did.  Albums that show you a band in their early days of creating music that aren't afraid to reveal some exciting, creative and just plain DIFFERENT musical ideas.<br /><br />\\"It's a Long Road\\" is a pretty good rocker.  It seems to be surrounded by very pleasant vocal melodies.  In fact, if the album has one problem, it's that it's probably slightly hard to separate some of these great melodies and try to match which songs the vocal melodies are coming from.  It's just one extremely pleasant-sounding song after another.  You'll remember these great melodies after the album is finished playing, but will probably struggle figuring out which song contains the melody in your head.  There's another song on here that reminds me of Al Stewart (\\"Home Again\\").  This is certainly an album worth picking up because you won't be disappointed with the quality of the songwriting.  In fact, the songwriting is so strong you can just go ahead and call this a lost classic.  It probably is.  Is it better than \\"Crime of the Century\\"?  Probably not, but it's not far off.<br /><br />Towards the end of the album the music takes a turn for more heavy rockers, sort of similar to what the Steve Miller Band was doing at the time.  \\"Try Again\\" is incredible.  Everything comes across as nicely-written and very pleasing early 70's rock.
B000URDEB0|2.0|Listening to the album all the way through, you get the feeling you've heard this song before. While not a masterpiece, \\"Dark Passion Play\\" is not a complete failure either. It dips its toes into the pools of both categories, finally treading water as a decent rock album. It could've been better, of course, but when you pause and consider that \\"Eva\\" was the first single, it could've been a lot worse.
B000002UJQ|4.0|OK Computer is supposedly Radiohead's masterpiece.  Well, I wouldn't go that far, but it's certainly a nice album overall.      \\"Airbag\\" opens the album.  Many consider it a classic, but not for me.  It does open with a good heavy riff and features a U2-like vocal melody.  \\"Paranoid Android\\" is next up.  A BRILLIANT multi-part song.  Wow.  Incredible!  The guitar playing rules.  Check out the cartoon music video if you ever get a chance.  It's great.  \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" opens with a mysterious intro which then turns into a slow, dreamy dance-like vocal melody.  Another classic.      \\"Exit Music (For a Film)\\" is a captivatingly quiet little tune.  The intro to \\"Let Down\\" reminds me of something off the Genesis album \\"A Trick of the Tail\\" and the main vocal melody reminds me of an old Who song.  It's a good song though, so don't think I'm just comparing it to older songs from years ago.  \\"Karma Police\\" is another incredible song with its catchy vocal melody and interesting lyrics.  It's a classic and nothing more needs to be said.    Elsewhere we have some filler tracks like \\"Climbing up the Walls\\" that personally doesn't do a whole lot to excite me, but to be fair, the song contains a haunting atmosphere.  \\"No Surprises\\" sounds like an updated take on that old 50's rock-ballad style.  I love it.  \\"Lucky\\" is perhaps the most under-appreciated song on the entire disc.  I love the quiet vocal melody build up.  Really good song.    I'll give the album four out of five stars, because I think that's the right call.  I have to be honest about something though.  I really don't see much of a connection to Pink Floyd on this release.  Maybe songs like \\"Comfortably Numb\\" can be compared to something from this album, but otherwise, while both artists are good at the dreamy atmospheric stuff, the two bands clearly aren't the same, in my opinion.  Two separate beasts.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|so many great reviews that to add the usual would bore all who bother w/ this site .  So I'll try a different approach :    # (1)  After reading so many reviews even by Amazon,  nowhere does anyone give Gloria Stuart her due as playing the elder version of Rose . First I'll remind all,  not about some unknown movie she may have played in BUT, does anyone recall or scary movie buffs own a little movie which is a Classic  now too,  titled \\" The Invisible Man \\" ?     Gloria Stuart was a beauty back in 1934 playing the lead opposite Claude Rains ( invisible man )  . How many actresses can say their careers lasted so long ?  She did a helluva job here and believable as well . If you enjoy a good horror /scary ?  movie then   \\" The Invisible Man \\"  ought be in your collection too  , especially if you realize the that they had pretty good special effects back in that day ...think about it ...after you see it .  I, as well as  many folks have seen other versions of  \\" Titanic \\"  and was sketical about it's re-make once more . Usually a disaster of proportions such as a \\" Titanic \\" sinking !  But was SOOO wrong ! I love it !    I own both versions of this 1997 Titanic movie and some true books on it as I am interested in the truth as well about that devastating voyage and the  rich & well known people aboard her .    I am happy to say that I was lucky enought to visit the exhibit here in Phila. when it made it's tour and own many reproduction ( of course ) plates, etc. of that white star line ( Titanic ) , in fact I went back a second time.  There's nothing like seeing some of the artifacts that people who sailed that voyage actually owned.  They even had under heavy plexi-glass a piece of her Hull which you could place your hand inside and touch .    If you ever get the chance ...don miss that opportunity ...you'll be forever changed in how you feel about that ship and the tragedy of that night & those people on board .    Anyway, when the 10 year anniversary comes  four DVD comes out in Nov. 2007  , I shall purchase that as well .  No, I don't own many DVD's just classics of which this one  can be counted . Enjoy the mythical Rose & Jack , but, never forget the real ( over )  1,500 people lost .
B000RJO578|5.0|So, I was recommended by a handful of friends to give this movie a watch, and, being in an action movie state of mind after watching the Bourne Ultimatum and Casino Royale, I gave it a try and fell in love with what I saw. Bear in mind I had never watched Shaun of the Dead, so I didn't know what to expect from Hot Fuzz. By the time I get to the end of the movie, my arms are thrown up in the air and I'm hollering with joy, \\"This movie is so awesome!\\"     Why should you watch this movie? Well, for starters, if you liked Shaun of the Dead, you'll probably like Hot Fuzz even more. The gags are great and there are plenty of hilarious bits, and it's does well to balance the line between action comedy and full on spoof. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a parody, because while the setting is sort of a spoof on the slick, urban environments most buddy cop films take place in, it also makes several homages to other classics (and even name-dropping some: \\"Point Break or Bad Boys II?\\"); however, it can still stand on its own as an action movie in its own right. Granted, the actual plot behind the murder mysteries is revealed all too fast (I've watched the movie more than ten times now and I'm still a bit murky on the details of the crime), but the gist of it is there, and you should be able to get a general idea of the plot without having to fully comprehend the minor details.    All gripes aside, this movie is excellent, and while the beginning is a bit slow, it ends on a perfect note, and is a thoroughly enjoyable film overall.    Now, as for the DVD itself, it is a bit light on special features, but it  delivers the goods. Features that are more content-heavy include The Fuzzball Rally, where you get to see the antics of writers Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright and actor Nick Frost as they toured the US promoting the movie, the deleted scenes, which had a lot of great content that, sadly, hit the cutting room floor during post-production, (there's even an extended version of the fence jump!), various commentaries (one with Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright for the feature film, and one with Edgar Wright for the deleted scenes), and best of all, the Fuzz-O-Meter, a trivia track which adds some great insight to the feature film. There are other special features that are pretty minor, like \\"The Man Who Would Become Fuzz\\", where Pegg and Frost impersonate Michael Caine and Sean Connery, respectively, and also \\"Danny's Notebook - the Other Side\\", but they're also pretty enjoyable, no matter how short.   If I were to compare these to the special features on the Shaun of the Dead DVD, or even the special features on the DVD release of Hot Fuzz in the UK, it's pretty barebones, lacking a few things that I wish were included, such as a making-of featurette and the like.  If you're a REALLY die-hard (pun fully intended) fan of Hot Fuzz (or Simon Pegg in general), I just recently learned that Rogue Pictures will be releasing a 3-Disc special edition of the DVD, [[ASIN:B000VNMMWA Hot Fuzz (3-Disc Collector's Edition)]], which I hear includes all of the special features from the UK release for the United States and Canada. Of course, it does cost more, but if you're a huge fan of the movie, this alternative is highly recommended.
0634022296|4.0|Excellent Content  In this book: A great selection of songs \\"Chorded\\" out for easy use. A chord chart precedes each song for a quick reference and a discography is in the back to clear up who wrote what and on which album.    The Binding  A songbook this thick should be spiral bound. It won't stay open unless it's creased, hurting the glue binding. I think it will last for a while before pages come loose, it's not cheap, but paperback books don't wear abuse well.    Conclusion  I'd give this 5 stars for the content, not tablature, no notes or solos, but an easy to read chord book. I subtracted one star for the binding.    It's easy to read, but not easy to use, at least not until it's broken in proper.
B000MCIBB6|4.0|I've always felt that \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" is the Doors' most underrated album.  It's often slammed for it's pop edge, but I think that helps make this one the band's most immediate and visceral release.<br /><br />This recent release, however, is a somewhat different album.  The remix present here tends to emphasize the 'rock' side of the band more than the psychedelic.  As a fan of psychedelia, this is sort of disappointing.  Much of the compressed atmosphere of the original is opened up on the remix, but I feel that it robs the band of much of its mystery and makes them sound less distinctive.  It's like a modern mix of vintage rock and doesn't quite work.  With alternate instrumental and vocal parts appearing the new mix severely alters the feel of the original in a way that other modern mixes such as the stereo \\"Pet Sounds\\" does not.<br /><br />On the positive side, the new mix is a showcase for drummer John Densmore.  He is a technically superior and musical drummer, and it's nice to hear him clearly here.  Unfortunately, this is often at the expense of Morrison and the rest of the band.  \\"Wintertime Love's\\" shuffling rhythm is awesome, but it works much better underpinning the song than right on time in a mix more reminiscent of a modern rock mix.  \\"Five To One\\" really suffers musically as Krieger's guitar parts are practically buried, and listening to Morrison's vocals requires significantly more attention.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are of interest once or twice, but are not quite essential.  \\"Albinoni's Adagio In G Minor\\" includes lots of recent overdubs and is more a piece of retrofitted history.  A complete studio take of \\"The Celebration Of The Lizard\\" is very interested, but it's not in the same league as other Doors epics, and the best part of it is still the \\"Not To Touch The Earth\\" Section, which remains best heard in the original album version.<br /><br />This is still a great album, and the remix does offer a nice alternate perspective of the Doors.  Still, if you want to hear this album at its best, you'd be best off finding a copy of the well remastered 1999 editions of the original mixes.  I've already returned to the original mix after giving this one a few chances.this album at its best, you'd be best off finding a copy of the well remastered 1999 editions of the original mixes.

B000KX0HVY|5.0|Well, who'd give an Elvis Presley album less than five stars if they'd gone to all the trouble to hunt it up and order it?  Of course I like it.  A day without Elvis is like a summer without roses.  Why we don't give every newborn an Elvis CD is beyond me.  Sometimes the federal and state governments lack imagination.  A nice album.  I would have been happier,  though, if it had contained \\"A Fool Such as I\\".  But it didn't. Neither  was \\"I Want You, I Need You, I Love You\\".  Nor was there \\"Trying To Get  To You\\".  But, you know, it's so cheap and sleazy to second guess the poor  guys that have to jam a major artist's work onto two CDs.  The Essential  Elvis Presley is an excellent starting point for an Elvis collection.
B000MCIBE8|4.0|Now this is a frustrating release.  Up to now, all releases of this album has been a bit too slow and this CD thankfully corrects that.  The band sounds more youthful and charged while plowing through their seminal debut.<br /><br />But there's a catch; this is not the original mix either.  The surviving Doors and engineer/producer Bruce Botnick have taken it upon themselves to completely remix the album.  It's more like a modern mix now, and the sound is clearer and punchier.  Unfortunately, this also does away with the creepy, compressed atmosphere that was a trademark of the original mixes.  The balance has swung away from the psychedelic into more typical classic rock territory.<br /><br />As is common with more modern mixes, the drums are also more front and center.  It's fun to hear John Densmore's creative and musical drumming clearly, but it obscures the rest of the band more than I'd like.<br /><br />After hearing this, I have trouble listening to the original mix's slightly flat sound, but I miss the original's atmosphere with the new mix.  I guess the best thing to do is never listen to this, and grab a copy of the still fine 1999 remaster (which also includes the infamous lost vocals on \\"Break On Through\\" and \\"The End\\").  If you're new to the Doors, this new disc may serve it's purpose, I feel it's missing the aural mystery and majesty of the original.
B000RW3YYA|4.0|The series just seems to be getting better each time. New twists, old friends showing up (well Michael isn't really a freind per-say), and it never seems to get too old. The Series leads up once again to a suspensful ending where you can't wait till it it comes back on to see what happens next.
B00003CXA2|2.0|When I first saw this movie I didn't think it was very credible and could not understand what all the fuss was about.  I find it impossible to believe that a person with an IQ of 75 could achieve the things Forrest Gump did and have the wisdom that he was shown to have in this movie.  A much more credible performance about a mentally challenged person is given in the excellent movie: \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape.\\"  Leo DiCaprio's portrayal of how a mentally retarded teenager's limitations and antics cause major problems and upheaval for his family should have earned the young actor an Academy Award in my opinion.  Forrest Gump is just a mildly entertaining fantasy.  I can't understand why Forrest Gump would win for best picture.  I was incredulous as I watched this movie, knowing how impossible it would be for someone of his intelligence to achieve the things he supposedly does in this movie, i.e. graduate from H.S., go to college, join the military, etc., etc., etc.  If you want to see a believeable movie about a mentally challenged person and his family, see the movie \\"What's eating Gilbert Grape\\" with Johnny Depp and Leo DiCaprio.
061891868X|4.0|A very good book; nicely written. Gives one (of the Laity) a small feeling for the beauties of high energy particle physics and the elegance of the so-called Standard Model.  The book then goes on, at some length, to define and, at least partially discredit, the Next Big Thing in Science: String Theory in its multiple versions.     Judging from many of the reviews that I scanned, the book has been carefully read (and thoroughly dissected, praised and/or criticized) by persons of substantial scientific credentials.  But there have also been some excellent commentaries from persons who, though not scientists, are intelligent appreciators of complex issues. I think of myself as one of these (Yes: I have read \\"The Elegant Universe\\" and \\"Not Even Wrong\\".  Understood some of both.)    And yet, as important as a Demonstrable Theory of What It All Means is, I cannot see where it will change the beliefs and perceptions of millions and millions of the believers in the great religious works such as the Holy Bible or the Koran.  It will NOT make any difference to the Faithful of the World's Religions.    So the concern that a Unification Theory may not put the notion of Intelligent Design to rest  is, for many, many souls, not simply an issue for Physics, but--far more important--an issue for the highest, most cerebral reaches of Philosophy.  This, to that huge population of Believers, is of no consequence.    To me, such a Theory would be most welcome, for I believe in science and mathematics and sweet rationality.  I have the feeling after completing this excellent work, that that is not going to happen anytime soon (Something like waiting for a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis.)    Bottom Line: Give the book a try.    Naf Los Altos
B0000DBJDM|5.0|I bought this without reading any reviews, put it in, and thought  \\"... what did I buy??\\"  Very distracting and non-coherent directors cut.      I read reviews here and realized the real purchase would be for the part included as an \\"extra\\"- the original film.      It is so nice to have that film on DVD with excellent sound and video quality, it contains excellent  recordings of music from \\"..Saucerful..\\" and other albums very worth having.    I'll try the directors cut off and on and see if I see where he was going, but I'm not sure it works wells with the original material he used as a base.
B000QXDED6|5.0|Excellent film,I never knew about Sparta til the release of this film and the sacrficies they made to protect their individuality and homeland.  Though history tends to also teach us they were also as barbaric as their enemies.  However, it was well directed and a strong content.  The acting was intense.  It keeps your attention and at times pulls at your heartstrings and also can make you feel a wide range of emotions.  I have watched it many times over and never tire of it.  Gerard Butler was excellent as Leoniadas as was the rest of the cast.
B000VL9XNI|3.0|I am torn on this set. I love this band. Seen them three times live. Have every album, including imports. I wish I could have a Bon Scott concert with good sound. Why can Led Zeppelin remaster their DVD and not AC/DC. While I still would buy this set, just to see my favorite band and add it to my collection, I am hoping they spend some time and money and remaster \\"Let There Be Rock\\" the movie in 5.1. I would forgive them. Family Jewels in 2.0 was unacceptable. Every band has a greatest hits in surround sound I can think of.     This is still worth buying. Just have to find a good setting on your receiver and live with it. After you're done, throw in Donnington, or Stiff Upper Lip Live and then you will appreciate your system that much more!
0738711500|4.0|The cards are just beautiful and very easy to work with.  I bought them with the book because they were on special and it was cheaper than buying the cards alone.  The book has some good information although it is annoying that the whole suit is not described in one section, the only problem I have found with the book is in its layout, the minor cards, grouped together for each suit, then the court cards of each suit, one at a time.  Obviously the reason for this is to teach about the cards but when the book is used as a reference it is very annoying trying to find the pages you want.  Overall though I am very happy with my purchase.  I am thinking of buying another one for a christmas present for a friend of mine.
B0007LCNKM|5.0|A friend sent me Mr. November and I was instantly in love with this band.  I bought some of their cd's and was just blown away at how powerful each song was.  When I saw them live at he El Rey. They came out and walked around a bit and even listened to a few songs by their opening band. It showed that they are very modest as performer. Also, Matt Berninger's voice works with the rest of the bands music.  I hate when lead singers sing over the music or are drowned out by the music.  Perfect harmony with these guys~!!! :D

B000RW3YYA|5.0|Season 3's main achievement is with the characters. The team was likable enough before, but in season 3, they become absolutely endearing thanks to this season's outstanding job with character development. Ronon wasn't a favorite of mine before, but it's all changed after watching \\"Sateda\\", one of best episodes of the series so far with \\"Common Ground\\".    Unfortunately, just when the season is almost over and you're cheering the producers for having achieved the perfect chemistry among the SGA team members, you get hit over the head with \\"Sunday\\". I only get to watch SGA when the DVDs are out, so I was totally unprepared for the shocking ending which left me speechless at first, then very sad, and finally very upset with the producers. What were they thinking? Who in the world first came up with such a \\"brilliant\\" idea?     Season 3 is excellent, you will love the characters, but I wonder what season 4 will be like. I heard Sam was joining the cast. Amanda Tapping is adorable, but - please don't hurt me - I find her flawless supergenius-to-the-rescue character too unidimensional and boring. I much prefer flawed multidimensional characters like SG-1 Vala (Claudia Black). As for Jewel, I have seen very little of her yet since I don't get to watch Season 4, but I simply can't imagine her as the new chief medical officer. She was a much better fit in Firefly. One can only hope Season 4 will be at least as good as this season, but when there are people in charge making decisions like killing the most lovable character of the show and, to make matters worse, replace him with someone totally unbelievable in the same role, I'm not holding my breath.
0812974611|3.0|We all know the ending.  It is certain that Vesuvius will blow and the beautiful seaside resort of Pompeii will be buried, its people immortalized forever in stone and ash.  However, knowing the ending does not in any way detract from the suspense and impending sense of doom as this novel races to its inevitable conclusion.<br /><br />I readily admit that historical fiction is not my favorite genre, but I was anxious to read this before visiting the Pompeii Exhibition now touring the US and scheduled to open soon in my area.  While I found the painstaking detail Harris gave to describing the structure of the Roman aqueducts and the scientific explanations for the eruption a bit much, I can certainly appreciate the importance of his work and the background it gives to those who relish discovering the WHY of everything.<br /><br />That being said, I did enjoy this for the wonderful details he gave of Italian life in 79 A.D.  The customs, lifestyles, manners, and more have all been amazingly researched and presented by the author.  I know this will make a spectacular transfer to the screen and am glad to read that Roman Polanski is doing this very thing with a target date of 2009 for the movie to arrive in theaters.<br /><br />Attilius, the young aquarian and hero of this novel, has been sent to replace the former aquarian who left his job under suspicious circumstances.  Many things have been happening that are out of the ordinary:  the failure of the matrix, the trembling of the ground, springs running backwards into the earth, sulphur poisoning of eels, and more.  Attilius promises Pliny, the eccentric historian, that he will repair the aqueducts and insure a water supply for the people.<br /><br />But can the good and decent Attilius overcome a natural disaster of this proportion?  Will his growing romantic interest in Corelia consume him?  Will her evil father Ampliatus have Attilius murdered?  Can the eccentric historian Pliny make sure his reports survive so that others can benefit from his observations?<br /><br />Beginning two days before the eruption and ending shortly after, this book gives you the feeling of being transported for a time to this epic event.  As the author  reminds us with a quote from the Encyclopedia of Volcanoes, \\"It is dangerous to assume that the worst is over after the initial explosive phase.  Predicting an eruption's end is even more difficult than predicting its beginning.\\"s observations?

B000TGCR3S|1.0|It was a nicely done anime. But the blur between reality and imagination makes this movie a hard one to follow. I was left wondering, what was the conflict, and did it get resolved? Or are they day dreaming? There was nothing finite to it. What made the movie so highly acclaimed is still a mystery.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I am not a musician and I cannot comment on the rhythms and styles. I just know that this album, IMHO, is the best in years. Vapor Trails was good, but it was recorded poorly and sounds too distorted.    I think that lyrically, this is the most thoughtful that Neil Peart has been in years. I also like it because it does away with much of the synthesizer sounds that made some of the more recent songs sound techno-ish.     I have had this cd in my truck since I first bought it and I just can't find it within me to change to something else.     My favorite songs are Armor and Sword and Workin' Them Angels.

B000UAE7RW|5.0|A remarkable film noir classic, \\"Chinatown\\" finally gets the deluxe treatment it deserves on Blu-ray.<br /><br />Blu-Ray: The Blu-ray looks quite nice. There is grain evident throughout but it isn't obstrusive staying true to the \\"look\\" of the original film and films of the time. Detail is quite nice throughout with my only complaint a bit heavy handed DNR on occasion in some scenes but that, again, could be justified if the grain was wildy inconsistent from shot to shot. The transfer walks the fine line of providing us with a sharp looking transfer that doesn't fall into the DNR pit of plastic skin and textures so smooth they rob the film of detail.<br /><br />It appears that the print used for the previous DVD (and quite possibly the same transfer although I haven't been able to confirm this)was also the source for this edition of the film on Blu-ray. It's also possible this is an older HD transfer (again, I haven't been able to confirm when it was done) which might explain the look of the film for BD. either way, \\"Chinatown\\" looks quite good although purists might quibble with the amount of visibile grain and texture at times.<br /><br />The audio is spectacular for the film.<br /><br />As near as I can tell all of the extras from the previous special edition have largely been ported over which is good and bad--it would be nice to have some nice extras perhaps something looking at the film within the context of the original proposed trilogy a bit more or with hindsight in relation to the under rated sequel[[ASIN:B000UAE7RM The Two Jakes (Special Collector's Edition)]] which seemed to inherent the production trouble that was largely avoided on \\"Chinatown\\".<br /><br />We get the audio commentary with writer Robert Towne being interviewed by film director David Fincher; the feature length documentary \\"Water and Power\\" about the inspiration for the film; a half hour documentary \\"Chinatown: An Appreciation\\"; \\"Chinatown: The Beginning\\", \\"Chinatown: The Filming\\" and \\"Chinatown: The Legacy all addressing the issues surrounding shooting, reception and where it stands in film history and as entertainment. We also get the original theatrical trailer and, although my edition is missing it, reportedly there is a booklet with stills and info on the film.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Is this worth buying again? It depends on your TV and how good it displays high def and, more importantly, how important THIS film is to you. \\"Chinatown\\" has always been one of my Top 10 Films of all time so for me it was a no brainer.<br /><br />DVD: The latest edition of \\"Chinatown\\" has much better contrast, a cleaner, richer looking transfer that more accurately captures a pristine theatrical presentation of the film. The anamorphic transfer has a bit more information on the sides than in the previous edition suggesting that it was cropped slightly differently (and I can't say which is truer to the original this edition or the previous one). Audio features the same 5.1 Dolby Digital mix that was a highlight of the first edition. We also get a cleaned up original mono soundtrack for purists. Both sound very good with the 5.1 featuring a nice dynamic mix.<br /><br />This new edition is a marked improvement over the previous DVD version(s) and highly recommended.inatown: The Legacy all addressing the issues surrounding shooting, reception and where it stands in film history and as entertainment.

B000001YOW|5.0|As somebody who grew up listening to the 1970s prog giants, having bands like Porcupine Tree around gives me renewed faith in progressive music.  This has just as much to do with their willingness to experiment with current trends in experimental music (e.g. ambient) as with their ability to look to the future.<br /><br />The lineup on Signify includes Richard Barbieri (analog synthesizers; Prophet V/System 700 electronics); Colin Edwin (fretted and fretless bass guitars; acoustic bass); Chris Maitland (drums and percussion); and Steve Wilson (vocals; electric and acoustic guitars; piano; organ; mellotron; percussion; and samples). This is my favorite lineup and there is great interplay between the bassist and the fantastic drummer - they provide an excellent accompaniment to the synth and guitar parts.  Steve Wilson has an excellent voice that is well suited for this material and his guitar playing is great too.<br /><br />Along with The Sky Moves Sideways (1995), Signify (1996) is another favorite of mine and represents the last of the lengthy \\"proggy\\" albums before the band started tightening the format up a bit on the excellent Stupid Dream (1999).  In large part, the twelve pieces on Signify (which range in length from 1:41 to 8:57) blend together as a seamless whole, with instrumental passages tying together melancholy, ambient sections and heavier, more \\"modern-rocking\\" tracks.  This stands in contrast with The Sky Moves Sideways, which featured extremely long pieces.  Scattered across the album are various sampled voices and other effects that add a lot to the psychedelic \\"vibe\\".  I especially like the use of analog keyboards on the album - it gives the music a very dreamy, spacey, and open feel.<br /><br />Porcupine Tree is a fantastic band that is heading in an exciting direction for progressive rock and is certainly one of the more interesting bands currently active in the scene.  Signify is very highly recommended along with Up the Downstair; The Sky Moves Sideways; Stupid Dream; Lightbulb Sun, and Recordings.eam; Lightbulb Sun, and Recordings.
B000002G87|5.0|This is one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded. What is amazing is that it was ever recorded at all. Look at the state of the musicians in the photos inside of the sleeve and you'll see a bunch of wrecked guys who look as they though were their just for a party (and they probably were). A lot of drugs and alcohol were being taken during this recording session. Sadly this has taken its toll on the musicians who played with Clapton on the album. For those who don't their rock history Jim Gordon (Drums) is in prison, Carl Radle (bass) died of a Kidney infection in 1980, Duane Allman (Guitar) died in a motorcyle crash in 1971. Only Bobby Whitlock survives apart from Clapton.<br /><br />However the music is mesmerisingly good. I remember hearing the guitar intro to Layla on the radio a few times when I was quite young (10 or 11) and not knowing what is was, but was completely transfixed by it. Not many pieces of music have had such an effect on me. But don't think this is a one track album. Clapton wrote another classic for this album in 'Bell Bottom Blues' and there are inspired covers of famous blues standards like 'Key to the Highway' and 'Little Wing'.

B0000009SG|5.0|This is the perfect way to introduce yourself to multiple talents of Frank Zappa. Guitarist, Composer, Songwriter and Satirist.<br /><br />The track listing is:<br />Camarillo Brillo<br />I'm The Slime<br />Dirty Love<br />Fifty-Fifty<br />Zomby Woof<br />Dinah-Moe-Humm<br />Montana<br /><br />The lyrics are frequently very near the knuckle (especially on Dinah-Moe-Humm), but they are also very funny and pertinent to today's society. Take 'I'm the Slime' as an example:<br /><br />\\"I'm the tool of the Government, an industry tool, for I am destined to rule, and regulate you, I may be vile and pernicious but you can't look away, I make you think I'm delicious, with the stuff that I say, I'm the best you can get have you guessed me yet? I'm the slime oozin' out from your TV set\\"<br /><br />Bare in mind this written over 30 years ago, and you can see that Zappa was on the ball. Of course it's true he lived in the US where the awfulness of TV was way ahead of us! Whilst the songs may be near the mark, this is one of Zappa's more catchy albums.<br /><br />With Ian Underwood, George Duke and Jean-Luc Ponty in the band the standard of musicianship is also very high. Listen to Fifty Fifty and Camarillo Brillo as examples. Zappa will not be to everybody's taste but this is as a good a way to start as I know.<br /><br />If you're still not sure, try the cheap compilations Cheap Thrills and Son of Cheap Thrills.

B00005JPRZ|3.0|Its not that the jokes aren't funny.  The problem is, everything--EVERYTHING--is telegraphed in advance.<br /><br />The casket arrives and...guess what?  Its the wrong guy!  Bada bing!  (there were only two options: (1) wrong guy or (2) empty, right?).<br /><br />One of the characters is a pharmacy student and he's been altering some capsules, re-filling them with LSD.  You don't suppose someone will take them by accident, do you???  Mayhem ensues.<br /><br />The great Alan Tudyk (from Serenity) gets one of those pills and locks himself in the bathroom.  You don't suppose he's gonna climb out the window, do you?  And if he gets on the roof, maybe he'll threaten to jump!<br /><br />A guy who nobody in the family knows, shows up at the funeral.  He's a dwarf (good, so far) but with the most androgynous face you've ever seen.  He must have some connection with the deceased.  Hmmm...you don't suppose this could be the gay joke, do you?<br /><br />And so it goes.  Its so routine, let me just tell you want doesn't happen.  The casket does not fall out of the hearse and tumble down a ravine.  There are no animals barking or pulling at clothes.  And none of the women get their skirts pulled off, leaving them screaming, running around in a slip.<br /><br />So yeah, its cute.  But no better than a half-hour Judy Dench comedy you can catch on TV.  I did enjoy the few funny exchanges between the widow and one of the wives.  I don't remember the actual conversations but their thinly veiled, yet polite, dislike for each other was amusing.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B000BGR0OM The Ultimate Collection]]  This is the best cd Annie Lennox has recorded as a solo artist.

The next track which is a favorite of mine \\"Smithereens\\" its a beautiful song and sounds like nothing she has ever done before!!! There are a lot of songs on this cd that sound a lot like Eurythmics such as \\"Womankind\\", \\"Colored Bedspread\\"...& even the soulful upbeat \\"Sing\\" which was recorded with 23 other famous divas!! If you like Annie or Eurythmics pick up this cd!! Its great!!!!

0618680004|3.0|Let me first say that I found this book very insightful as to its arguments in support of evolution. I have also read Sam Harris' \\"Letter To A Christian Nation\\", which, when it comes to arguing about the validity of the existence of God, was far superior. The two problems I see in Dawkins' approach concerning the existence/non-existence of God are:  He excessively uses the infinite regress concept, applying it to God (If everything regresses, was God also created, and thus infinitely backward), and  Dawkins, using the anthropic argument, attempts to show that the existence of a \\"knob twiddling god\\" is improbable.  To both of these arguments I must say Dawkins fails from the get-go, because he doesn't have a clue as to how theology works. He is attempting to explain away the existence of God using scientific method. This methodology is fallacious and brings the contender to a false conclusion. It would be like me showing Dawkins an algebraic problem, and then handing him a French Dictionary, and telling him he must use the dictionary to solve for \\"x\\".  The only problem Dawkins and most of his fellow atheists fail to grasp is: you may be able to decry a concept of God, but that doesn't prove God doesn't exist, only that that concept is unlikely. If we were to say God is like Satan, there goes the conundrum of \\"How can a good God exist with all this evil?\\". Or, how about Krishna? A God who is at times good to people, at other times selfish or capricious, or even downright deceitful. An atheist may declare that such gods are not worthy of thought, much less worship, but that does not prove their non-existence. Once we have set up this parameter, then the discussion either goes on to what to believe about God, or deny the defined gods, and slip into a blind, unthoughtful denial, much akin to radical agnosticism.  If anyone reads both sides of a debate, like atheism/theism or evolution/creationism, the answers are not as clear. In my discussions with others, I have discovered that those who KNOW where they stand haven't read the other side, only snippets of the other side, offered in a biased form by the side the believer stands so strongly with. Stay open!

020161622X|5.0|Since I was young I wanted to be a programmer.  I got my first development job only a few years ago, and have spent much of my free time reading blogs and the like.  The problem with that was there were too many conflicting schools of thought on too many different methodologies and practices.<br /><br />I found this book only a few months ago, and poured through its pages.  After finishing it, my approach to software development has changed so drastically that I would say it changed my life.  That may be a dramatic way of saying it, but I think it certainly did.  I began writing tools that would allow me to follow the simple development guidelines in this book.<br /><br />For instance, after reading the section about the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself), I wrote a script that would read through my application's codebase and find similar chunks of code, and identify them.  I ALWAYS found a case where I could refactor, writing easier to follow code, and consolidate repeated code into one area.<br /><br />Instead of spending tons of time trying to filter out the noise of the blogosphere, buy this book, read it, and then live it (my apologies for any \\"religious\\" connotations...)

B0000TB01Y|4.0|I went to see the musical and decided to buy the CD too. I love it.
B00005JO5L|2.0|Just before the outbreak of AIDS came this lightning rod of a thriller from director/screenwriter William Friedkin ([[ASIN:B000BZIST4 The French Connection]], [[ASIN:B0000524CY The Exorcist]]), a grisly murder mystery set deep within Lower Manhattan's gay, S&M subculture. It comes as no surprise that it has taken so long for this 1980 movie to come to DVD because it is difficult to watch just as much for the weak storytelling as its more unsavory elements.  Based on a 1970 novel by New York Times reporter Gerald Walker, it is heavy on atmosphere, which Friedkin and cinematographer James Contner realistically capture in often graphic detail, but extremely light on character development. This turns out to be the film's ultimate deficiency since it is hard to assess what motivates a lot of the characters' actions beyond the plot circumstances.<br /><br />A serial killer is on the loose in the aptly named meat packing district, and Captain Edelson assigns ambitious young cop Steve Burns to go undercover to find him. Burns pretends to be a gay commercial artist named John Forbes and immediately befriends his neighbor Ted to get to know the area. Soon enough he enters the underground leather bar scene and is simultaneously shocked and intrigued by what he sees and experiences. In hindsight, these scenes still have punch but now have an added layer of emotional complexity with the spread of the AIDS crisis. At the same time, Friedkin spends too much time on this aspect of the story at the expense of the crime drama itself. What happens is that plot points rush by with one innocent suspect brutalized at the police station and then an overlong sequence when the real killer is revealed and methodically pursued. All the while, Burns keeps his girlfriend Nancy in the dark about his undercover work, while he grapples with aspects of his own identity. This is where the story gets the most muddled, and the overly ambiguous ending is the result.<br /><br />In 1980, Al Pacino suffered a temporary career setback playing Burns, but his relatively subtle performance is actually one of the film's redeeming qualities. As Edelson, Paul Sorvino is a somber presence, while Richard Cox does what he can playing a man driven by his father's disapproval. Karen Allen, just before hitting it big in [[ASIN:B000F201HK Raiders of the Lost Ark]], has little to do but look understandably confused as Nancy. Friedkin provides a detailed and fairly interesting commentary track on the 2007 DVD. There are two featurettes - \\"The History of Cruising\\" and Exorcising Cruising\\" - which run a combined 43 minutes and better explain the film's genesis and the firebrand reception to the production and the release. Friedkin participates as do several members of the cast and crew (though sadly not Pacino). In 2007, the film provides curiosity value more than anything else.areer setback playing Burns, but his relatively subtle performance is actually one of the film's redeeming qualities.

B000NA28A2|5.0|It's an excellent CD. Each song is awesome!! You'll find any rhythms, including merengue, salsa, bachata... and even and English song kind of \\"classic\\"... that anyone would love! (Something good is coming).  Totally recommended!!
B000KCHZK6|2.0|I remember when Norah won the grammy for \\"Come Away With Me\\".  At that time, she stated something to the effect of \\"this wasn't even a real album ,it was just a demo\\", or something like that.  But, the thing is, it WORKED.  It showcased her amazing talent and her wonderful voice.  Her talent is great enough that it doesn't need anything more than a demo--we're not talking Britney Spears here.  Unfortunately, things have gone downhill since.    Her two albums since her debut have suffered from \\"studio-ization\\".  Her voice is not as clear on the last two albums, and on her 2nd album, her voice was ruined by the mix which was drowned by studio garbage.  (The right kind of studio-ization works for some kinds of music, like M. Ward for example, but just not for Norah.) This, her 3rd album, is a little bit better than the 2nd mix-wise (though still way below the first), but not as strong song-wise.  The couple of best songs on this album are, unfortunately, barely on par with the worst songs on the first album.    Norah Jones proved she can write great songs, as demonstrated by \\"Come Away With Me\\", however, in her attempt to write or co-write ALL of the songs on this latest CD proved that she also still has a LONG way to grow.  It seems that she would have been better off singing more songs from the likes of Jesse Harris or others, while letting her songwriting talents grow in the background. After all, Elvis was great because he had a great voice and a great interpretation style, not because of his songwriting abilities.  At this point, the same applies to Norah.  If she writes a great song like \\"Come Away With Me\\", then fine, include it on the CD, but the songs on this CD are, quite frankly, boring.  And, yes, I've been listening to this CD off and on since its release date, but it just doesn't do it.    I haven't given up on Norah yet because I still like her and have great hopes for her, but I wish she'd realize just what it was that made her debut so great.  It didn't need what I call studio-ization because the songs were great and the talent was greater.  There's no need to mess with the sound here for radio-friendliness, just let the talent shine & choose great songs, no matter who they're written by, and she'd be fine.      That doesn't mean that she has to keep on doing the same things--I certainly encourage growth in music, but just realize where the greatness currently lies: her singing.
0812977246|5.0|Smith brings new life to the Dashiel Hammett/Raymond Chandler strain of this genre by relocating his lonesome detective/white knight from Los Angeles to Brezhnev's Moscow.  Delightful, rich, atmospheric, and original.
B00030590I|2.0|If your a Nartial Arts fan this movie is ok, the fighting is ok. But the directing is bad so is the script. I can be hard to follow at times. I think this movie was very boring and cant understand how it has 5 stars
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I totally enjoyed this CD as it provided all of the initial songs that brought the Beatles to fame and carried us through our teenage years but then continued with the Beatles' greatest hits that came later in their careers.  Younger music fans will be introduced to songs which they may not know but which their parents were immersed in in their youth and occasionally \\"hum\\" on a sunny day.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|we like it hot hot.  this movie is a blast to watch by yourself or with the kids. when my grandson moved back to california this was the one movie he couldn't live without.  needless to say he is so excited to have gotten his own copy and gets to see it everyday after homework.  it also reminds him to be good , santa might be watching!  he also loves the songs on it too. i highly recomend this as it always makes me smile.
B000UR366S|3.0|...and Ms. Mithcell's best lyrics have always been her personal. This CD got rave reviews in our local paper, but for me, it was disappointing. The music is lovely, rich and lush, but it reminded me of \\"For the Roses\\"--not a bad thing, but not a new thing, either.      I've always thought that she just doesn't do \\"cause\\" lyrics well, and nothing on this album changed my mind. Where her personal lyrics are evocative and yield additional insights with repeated listenings, her \\"cause\\" lyrics--and certainly in these songs--are just kind of ham-handed and unsubtle.       The album I hope she has in her--and that she'll make--is the story of how a woman in her 60s who, after years of love affairs, comes to terms with getting older, with being old. I'd love one more Joni album that speaks to me.        And I loved her voice on this.
0446677450|1.0|I bought this book out of curiosity, to see for myself what the hype is all about.  I have to admit that the first part really drew my attention. Co-writer Sharon Lechter did a good job placing the story in the setting of two kids growing up. It makes the simple content digestible.  But then out of the blue Mr. Kiyosaki takes the word and it feels like the editor didn't have the time to finish her job. It is embarrassing to see K. showing off and telling us how he made his fortune being a real estate speculant.    Regards,  Norbert
B0007DAZW8|4.0|I am obviously one of the few who believes that this is the best record that Daft Punk have ever done.
B00007KWI9|5.0|The sound quality is outstanding, especially for an album of this age (1970).  The clarity here is so crisp it almost sounds like a new recording!  Even though I already own all their LP's, I am considering buying the remasters of Yes' classic progressive albums \\"Close to the Edge,\\" \\"Fragile,\\" and \\"The Yes Album,\\" just because the sound on this one is so good.
0385341067|5.0|Many novels present a child's vision of reality but this narrow-focused story most resembles \\"Lord of the Flies\\" in that only details relevant to the moment are included.  This is a must read, as human nature is pitted against pure survival in a tale told through the eyes of a black child whose struggle to sustain even  the basics of life is thwarted at almost every turn. The question of trust in adults is explored in depth and its results are surprising.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|Quentin Tarantino and bloodshed. The two seem to go hand-in-hand. From [[ASIN:B00008975Z Reservoir Dogs]], [[ASIN:1558908455 From Dusk Till Dawn]], the [[ASIN:B00005JMEW Kill Bill]] duet (One and Two), and now the GRINDHOUSE couplet (DEATH PROOF and [[ASIN:B000XASD1K Planet Terror]]), Mr. Tarantino likes to play with crimson. And he sometimes does it very well.<br /><br />What makes Death Proof watchable is its homage to the drive-in days of early technicolor when scratchy editing and concession stand intermissions were commonplace. The story itself is fairly unremarkable (with the exception of Kurt Russell's performance as Stuntman Mike, a psychotic, out-of-work, stuntman who has girl issues for no apparent reason). His mood swings from depression to exhilaration are done well and mark him as the crux that holds Death Proof together.<br /><br />The \\"Tarantino Girls\\" are sure to be eye-candy for most male watchers, their languorously long legs and tight Daisy-Duke shorts being a bit overly focused upon. Although this is what makes Tarantino films appealing, especially when harkening back to the 70's when big hair and revealing clothing were making their way into the mainstream.<br /><br />And what Tarantino flick would be complete without some cool cars. Souped-up Nova's and Dodge Challengers are indicative of the times (the 70s), a time we're supposed to find ourselves reminiscing about. But Tarantino fails to continue on the right path and veers out of control.<br /><br />Cell phones pop up in the second act of Death Proof and pull us away from the first (the second act takes place less than two years after the first). I had to ask myself exactly \\"when\\" we were. Confusing us further, the Dodge Challenger that the girls go check out is designated \\"a classic,\\" yet, again, the second act (which is where this happens) takes place only 14 months after the first.<br /><br />Kurt Russell's Stuntman Mike is creepy and funny, and it is his hysterically frightening performance that pulls Death Proof up a notch. His stalking of the pretty girls is spooky, while his later encounters with them are laughable ...and sometimes sexy.<br /><br />The car crash scenes involving the classic Dodges is sure to make MOPAR owners cringe, each crunch of metal on metal eliciting a screeching quality from the cars themselves and those who love these rare vehicles.<br /><br />The girls in both episodes are great looking gals: Zoe Bell, Rosario Dawson ([[ASIN:B000KB489I A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints]]), Vanessa Ferlito ([[ASIN:B00005JLF2 24]]), Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Tracie Toms ([[ASIN:B000J103PC The Devil Wears Prada]]), Rose McGowan, Jordan Ladd, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (BOBBY) round out the leggy women whom Kurt Russell's character harasses ...but not the way he intended in the end.<br /><br />This is a modestly entertaining film, if only for its sentimental value for those who spent time at the drive-in a few decades ago, or for Kurt Russell fans. If you're a diehard Tarantino-ite, you might find it enjoyable as well. But for mainstream audiences, this one might crash and burn.<br /><br />(NOTE: This is only a review of half of the GRINDHOUSE film, which, for some reason, was divided into two separate DVDs when released. A review of PLANET TERROR will be forthcoming soon)His stalking of the pretty girls is spooky, while his later encounters with them are laughable ...and sometimes sexy.

B000WSHF4E|2.0|I wanted to love this movie.  It does fall a bit flat and stale when compared to the first Elizabeth and other costume movies.      The Plot - There is a plot but it is scattershot and a bit vague.    The Dialog - It is rather weak at many times during the movie. Much of the dialog is in the form of questions and sarcastic humor. That gets boring after the first 20 minutes of hearing it.    The costumes - They look amazing!    The cinimatography - Is a bit on the artsy side and is rather grainy at times.  It still managed to look appropriately stylish.    Obvious disappointments - The Queen was in armor but she looked so uncomfortable up on the horse.  I did not feel conviced that she was going to fight in the war and she didn't which I thought was going to happen. It would have been awesome to see the Queen sword fight even if it did NOT happen in reality.  It would have been entertaining.    The characters were very annoying especially the rogue man that Elizabeth had a crush on.  It was rather unbelievable that such a \\"strong\\" Queen would fall for such a low life loser.    Was Spain that threatening to Elizabeth and England? Well the director didn't convince me enough to dislike Spain.    The acting - It ranged from average to excellent.  Cate did her best with the stale script and probably insufficient directing.  The other female actress (blond younger lady) did a great job too.     I hope they make a third movie and do a much better job at forming a quality script.     Overall it seemed rushed and it was somewhat dull.    This movie was worth watching for the drama and neat costume design that it presented but I will not purchase this movie once it is released on DVD.    Comments on my review are welcomed. :)
B000UR9TQE|4.0|While we have seen The Song Remains the Same before, it's not the complete show. But here's what Jimmy Page has to say about the re-release DVD and the soundtrack:    \\"We have revisited 'The Song Remains The Same,'\\" says Jimmy Page, \\"and can now offer the complete set as played at Madison Square Garden. This differs substantially from the original soundtrack released in 1976, and highlights the technical prowess of Kevin Shirley, who worked with us on 'How The West Was Won.' When it comes to 'The Song Remains The Same,' the expansion of the DVD and soundtrack are as good as it gets on the Led Zeppelin wish list.\\"
B00005JO5L|2.0|I saw the movie \\"Crusing\\" in the theater back in 1979 and remember the fear it provoked in the gay community.it was so \\"now\\" and the performances were all top notch,so you can imagine my excitment when i saw that it was now available on DVD. Well that was then this is now,it does not stand the test of time. We were all bored and kept wondering what was it that we liked so much before? Maybe we are all so desencatized now days.so to put it in a nut shell it was really bad and not even bad in a campy way.there are so many movies you can watch over and over again and they hold up well...this is not one of them.
B000W9DTG6|5.0|I cannot wait for this to come out.  In my opinion, this collection is one of George Clooney's best work!!  I am pre-ordering it as soon as I finish this comment.  Great movies, Great acting, Great all round....LOVED THEM ALL!!!!!!!!!!!
1595141715|5.0|I received an advance reader's copy of this book a few months ago and it is easily the best book I had read this year.  I loved it so much, in fact, that I was able to convince my school district to purchase over 200 copies of it, to give away to other teachers who attend my book talks on young adult literature.  Yes, it is THAT good.<br /><br />In this book, Clay receives a mysterious brown-wrapped package.  When he opens it, he finds a handful of cassette tapes.  After finding a cassette player (because, heck, it is 2007, who uses cassette players anymore?) he pops in cassette #1 and is shocked to find that his classmate, Hannah, is speaking on the tapes....Hannah had killed herself just weeks before the package's arrival.<br /><br />As Clay listens to cassette #1, he finds that anyone who receives the package is indeed one of the thirteen reasons why Hannah committed suicide.  This page-turner will keep you up all night, as Clay pops in cassette after cassette, to find out what his role is exactly in Hannah's death.  Could he really be somewhat responsible?<br /><br />You won't regret reading this book....and it won't take you very long.  It is a fast read and will keep you on the edge of your seat, as you read on to find out more about the circumstances surrounding Hannah's death.
B000V8I2QU|1.0|tired clichés, predictable rhymes, uninspired lyrics, even more uninspired music.  I don't whether I'd re-name \\"Magic\\" as \\"Don't know when to quit\\" or \\"Can't remember how to hit\\" -- I gave it one star because you can't go any lower; in any case it is a total waste of money!
B000MV8ABS|5.0|This film combines horror with sci-fi.  Believe me, this one will keep you on the edge of your seat for the complete movie.<br /><br />Two brothers discover the local mortuary isn't what it seems.  The Mortician has a legion of hooded killers (souls of the damned) working for him.  Let's face it.  We're all scared of cemeteries at night and can you imagine roaming around in a mortuary at night with the lights out?  I can't!<br /><br />Although I know nobody that has ever seen \\"Phantasm\\", it is a truly scary movie and a horror classic.  I consider it one of the scariest I've ever seen.<br /><br />This version has scenes never seen in America before.  It was written and directed by Don Coscarelli who went on to \\"The Beastmaster\\" and \\"Bubba Ho-Tep\\" fame.  There are three sequels.<br /><br />Don't watch this one alone.

055358894X|5.0|What a surprise this book was.  In short:    Positive  1.  Original and entertaining storyline  2.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next (sure, sometimes it's obvious, but overall there were enough surprises)  3.  Enjoyable & real characters    Negative  1.  The city never really took shape for me.  I have a hard time visioning the items he described.  2.  I did find that periodically I had to re-read a paragraph or two to understand what the author was trying to get across.    The long version:  I have read hundreds of fantasy novels over the last 15 years and it seems like the good books ran out about half way through.  I'm sure my aging had something to do with that as well.  Anyway, I thought I would try and break out of the norm and did some research on new authors.  I don't usually like that approach, because I don't like waiting for the next book in the series to come out.  However, in my search I found some positive reviews on Scott Lynch and so I gave him a try.  It was well worth it.    This story is wonderful.  It was a new twist in fantasy that I find myself longing for.  The lack of a big war, wizards throwing bolts of lighting, political backstabbing, etc was refreshing (I still enjoy that stuff, but it does get old when you see the same storyline over and over again).  I also enjoyed the use of real language (thieves do curse, and quite a bit if I were to guess), because it gave me a feeling that I was part of their lives, not having a children's story told to me.    I could go on and on, but in the end it comes down to good characters, surprising twists, and page hanging excitement.  I'm very pleased.    As noted above, there are some negatives.  I never truly grasped the city that the author was trying to reveal to us.  Glass buildings illuminated at dusk and the like.  It just never clicked.  I also didn't like the whole \\"it's from the people before us\\" stuff.  I'm not a big fan of futuristic aspects being brought into medieval themed fantasy novels.  That's just my own thing though.    Also, I did find that there were some sections in the book I had to read twice to fully understand what the author was trying to say to us.  It wasn't too often though, so I didn't have an issue with it.    With that being said, I highly recommend this book.
B000E1155E|5.0|These guys are quickly becoming one of my all time favorite bands.  This album has a punk influence and catchy lyrics that make you want to rock out.  The lyrics give away the age of these guys since the album is primarily about partying and picking up girls, but it does make you nostalgic for your single college years.
B000J4QWM2|1.0|I am glad I did not pay $10 to watch this in the theater.  I am glad I did not pay $5 to rent from Blockbuster.  I caught it for free on HBO and was very, very disappointed.  I fell asleep half way during the movie. There are no exciting (or even non-exciting) action sequences.  The acting is terrible and the story is way overdrawn.    In conclusion, if you want to see Michael Mann at his best, watch Heat.  If you want to see him at his worst (or are having difficulty falling asleep and need some help), watch this snooze-fest.

0393316041|5.0|This book provides insightful and sometimes hilarious commentary on the experiences of a very intelligent person.  His meetings with \\"great men\\" while working on the manhatten project and his anecdotes about life and living make for a book that is surprisingly hard to put down.<br /><br />I've stayed up late reading this book.
0451208706|2.0|This book IS quite interesting, a captivating plot and lots of historical detail sure to delight most readers. Its the cheap sex, lust and glorification of adultry that damns the whole thing. Not to mention, this book has the trashiest climax I`ve come across in a long time.     Mr. Folletts obsession with adultary is extremely frustrating as he writes what are otherwise excellent historical thrillers. Trust me, if you have an ounce of traditional values in your body you'll want to hurl this book accross the room.     Pick up A Dangerous Fortune or Pillars of the Earth first. Lets all hope Mr. Follett wakes up and takes his job a little more seriously soon.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I purchased this for my son for Christmas!  The whole family has enjoyed it.  It is very stimulating to the mind and the game is never the same twice so it never gets boring.  There is competition and thought and planning involved.  Wonderful game!
159562015X|1.0|The book was enticing, especially because the leader of a meeting I attended this week recommended it.  I purchased it on a Thursday, sat down to take the assessment on this Saturday morning, and after 35 minutes of the quiz, NO RESULTS!  Instead of results, my computer screen just said,  \\"Error.  Please contact customer service.\\"       The company must not work weekends because 6 hours later, no response, not even a thank you, we'll get back to you later.  The three times I relogged onto the website, I waited while it said, \\"Please wait.  Calculating your results.\\"  and then the same error message.  If you're busy, this is not for you.  The book is pricey and absolutely useless without results from the quiz.  Based upon my experience, DON'T BUY IT.

You don't know who's trustworthy and who isn't.  I recommend this story to all who are interested in good reading, especially fantasy.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|The most triumphant moment in modern Indian history is encapsulated by  the commentary of American journalist Vince Walker(Martin Sheen)-with whom the central figure of this film first became acquainted in 1890s South Africa- at the height of the summer of 1947.<br /> ...\\"Whatever moral ascendancy the West held was lost here today! India is FREE! For she has taken all that steel and cruelty can give, and she has neither cringed nor retreated....\\"<br /> This was the moment for which Mohandas K. Gandhi--so aptly and unforgettably portrayed by Oscar winner Ben Kingsley with a subtle spark of divine fire--had campaigned  for over three decades.<br /> But Richard Attenborough's  1982 Oscar winner puts too fine a point on how little time India's Mahatma would have to enjoy it before meeting his tragic end at the hands of Hindu fanatic Nathuran Godse (Harsh Nayyar) in 1948 while en route to a prayer meeting accompanied by his nieces Manu and Abha(Supryia Pathak, Neena Gupta).<br /> We view a solemn procession, ancient Hindu rites, and after a reverent summary of Gandhi's life by a Western radio commentator (Shane Rimmer), we travel further back in time, and to a different place.<br /> In 1893 South Africa, we see a 24-year-old Indian-born, Western-educated attorney en route to deal with a case, traveling by train with a first class ticket. When a European passenger (Peter Cartwright) raises an objection to the Indian lawyer's riding First Class, Gandhi is thrown off the train despite protesting his right to be where he was. This is the official beginning of a lengthy struggle for human rights.<br />  One of his early supporters in this endeavor is the Muslim Indian, Kahn (Amrish Puri). We witness the brutality of the British authorites for simple offenses, such as burning the passes nonwhites are forced to carry. He attracts the support of certain Westerners such as the amiable Reverend Charlie Andrews (Ian Charleson, who played athletic clegyman Eric Liddell in the previous year's Oscar Winner for Best Picture, \\"Chariots of Fire\\"), and Dr. Herman Kallenbach (Gunter-Maria Halmer). During one of Gandhi's early incarcerations, General Jan Christian Smuts (Athol Fugard) proves sympathetic to Gandhi's plight.<br /> Watch for a cameo of future Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis as a South African street thug.<br /> Gandhi changes his lifestyle drastically, and instead of  living in an upper class structure with an Ayah (Charu Bala Choksi) for his three sons, he and his wife Kasturba (the beautiful Rohini Hattangady) take up a simpler existance at a communal Ashram with their supporters, hoping to illustrate the ability of those of all races and creeds to live together--experiences later chronicled in Gandhi's book \\"Ashram Observances in Action\\".<br /> Returning to India in 1915, Gandhi meets those who will play the most crucial roles in the struggle for India's independence, including Jawaharal Nehru (Rashan Seth), Sardar Vahabhai Patel (Saheed Jeffrey), and representing India's Muslim minority, Mohammed Ali Jinnah (Alyage Padamsee). Professor Gohale(Shreeram Lagood) tells Gandhi that he believes India's future to be in good hands now that he has returned.<br /> Gokhale's faith in Gandhi, of course, would be well-placed.<br /> Encouraged by Gokhale to get to know his native land better after many years abroad, Gandhi and his supporters tour the country by train, leading to a few comical moments.<br /> During another stint in jail,  Gandhi tells Reverend Andrews that the best thing he could do to help is to accept assignment in Fiji, so that Indians will have the largest role in the fight for their own independence. But Andrews petitions British authorties at the highest level to help the effort as a final act of generosity.<br /> Economic and social injustices by the British mount, but Gandhi's movement of passive resistance  grows. In April, 1919  British cruelties reach their nadir as General Reginald Dyer (Edward Fox) orders Nepalese troopsto fire on thousands of unarmed civilians in Amritsar's Jallianwalah Bagh.<br /> Through it all, the self deprecating Gandhi endures repeated incarcerations and fasts, largely with sparkling-eyed-determination.There is a lovely moment when he reunites with Walker and he and Kasturba reenact their wedding ceremony.<br />  Soon Gandhi is on the march again, in defiance of the British ban on Indians gathering salt from their own ocean. After six year's imprisonment, he returns to preaching nonviolent resistance of British rule. By this time a British Admiral's daughter, who is renamed Mirabehn (Geraldine James), has joined his household. Through her comes the revelation that British mill workers, who are ignored by their own government, which is too busy plundering other countries to address their needs, are among Gandhi's staunchest supporters.<br /> We observe the efforts of Gandhi and colleagues to end fighting among various Indian factions. The British finally see the futility of abuse and incarceration, and soon enough are fighting to preserve their own independence from Nazi Germany, ultimately compelling them to extend to India what they wish to maintain for themselves.<br /> Candance Bergen's Margaret Bourke-White captures the Mahatma on film and through his final days.<br /> The 30s find Gandhi attending a conference in London about Indian independence. It is amusing to see John Gielgud's Lord Irwin, surrounded by the trappings of wealth, humbled by the man with a loincloth and walking staff while extending the invitation to attend the conference.<br /> The 1940s find Gandhi enduring another incarceration, the loss of his beloved wife, and seeing his country win independence at last, but he is heartbroken that the long-standing dream that he and many Indians have had for centuries of a united India has been denied.<br /> But as Mirabehn observed: When we most needed it, he offered the world a way out of madness.\\"<br /> Since my first viewing of this film, just after its 1983 Oscar Night victory, I've often pondered Gandhi's words about the eventual fall of all tyrants.<br /> This film is a fitting tribute to the man who defeated History's mightiest Empire not with lethal weaponry, but by the might of a wanderer's staff. For a Hindu, he was a better practitioner of Judeo Christian values than many raised in those faiths.<br /> At the close of my review, written to honor both 60 years of Indian independence, and the 25th anniversary of this film's release, I take note of the fact that the Biblical connotations of this man's life are indeed admirable!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This little known show may quite possibly be the best show ever put onto network television.  I recommend this for people of all ages.  A must buy!!
B000P6YNSE|4.0|Warning: some spoilers!<br /><br />Overall, not my favoirte Lost season. Now, i have been a Lost-acholic ever since i bought the first season on DVD and i belive that it is one of the most well crafted shows out there. Sure, it may bring up more questions then answers but then that will give us more answers and revelations.<br />So you can pretty much divide this season into two halves. The first being the 'fall season', which was the first six episodes and then the 'spring season', being the next sixteen. I thought the Fall season was pretty...well, boring to say the least. Barely nothing happens and nothing is resolved (unless u count Jack's tattoe's, but i really didn't pay much attention to them anyway). However, things definently picked up during the Spring season. First smart move, getting rid of Nicky and Paolo, in a very nicely contructed episode that ended with a macarbe and sinister end. Second, getting Sawyer and Kate off that island. Finally, bringing a background to Juliette and some of the other 'Others'. And finally, that season finale, by far the best one yet. I mean honestly, who can say they saw THAT one coming?<br />Now, the new season won't start until February. For the Lost fans, thats bad. But for the rest of you, its the perfect oppertunity to pick up the first three seasons of Lost so you can get all caught up before the season premire. and for the rest of you, just give it time. Trust me, all good things come to those who wait.
1594489505|5.0|This book is a reminder of what the true riches in this world really are and that the endurance many bear to sustain these riches in the face of great suffering is testimony to the strength of the human spirit.  Those who value these riches most are often those who have faced the most challenges and where the tenuousness of these values are tested in ways that we in America can't even begin to imagine. This book was a double edged sword.  While the writing style made its reading so easy and enjoyable, the story itself was incredibly painful. However, regardless of the sorrow, reading this book brought me great joy and a renewed appreciation for freedom and democracy.  Therefore I highly recommend reading this book.
0143038419|5.0|This readable, laughable, lovable journal of the world travels of the author is an adventure for readers.  The cultural insights are fascinating.

0891419195|5.0|Watching the varios retrospectives shown during the 50h anniversary of the end of WWII was fascinating,but what delighted me was seeing Eugene Sledge on televlsion and getting to see what he looked like and what his voice sounded like.I'd read his book several times and it was great actually seeing him.As the cliche goes, I felt like I knew him. I assume that he's passed away because he wasn't on camera during Ken Burns' new documentary, The War,and I felt a real sense of sadness and loss when I realized that he was being discussed but wasn't being interviewed-which made me assume that death had finally caught up with him.Damned shame.He authored one of the finest American memiors of a fighting man.He brilliantly conveyed the pride and excitement that he and his fellow Marines felt on finally \\"making the team\\"and he just as brilliantly conveyed the horror and disgust that a thinking man must feel sitting in a hole in the ground surrounded by rotting bodies and human excrement,waiting for an incomprehensible foe who was eager to die in battle.RIP Eugene. Thanks for what you did for your country.
6305076995|3.0|Ah...My first introduction to Yes was the live 3 lp set of Yessongs in 1973! I heard The Yes Album. \\"Roundabout\\"'s mystic arrangement was bouncing around in my head; As was the Anderson update on 'The Jetson's' theme song: \\"Long Distance Runaround.\\" Realized the rhyme, so much later. Much later. I bought the VHS version of this landmark yes \\"document\\" in the mid-Eighties. Had to have it. Yessongs is the quintessimal live album of that era. It easily equals Allman Brothers At Fillmore East. These guys kicked butt, live.    Aurally this differs enough from the landmark Yessongs[still, itself waiting to be upgraded to the millenium sonically]. But even the 90's upgrade of the Yessongs' 3 album set to 2 CDs is passable.    What is a crime is that this magnificant \\"documentary\\" of the key Yes lineup: Anderson, Squire, Wakeman, Howe, and White languishes in the distended state it is. Even un-updated aurally and visually this concert   is still powerful.     I only wish it had gotten the loving care and re-integration that Pink Floyd's Live At Pompeii had. I'd give it more than 3 *** if it was seriously upgraded. But it ain't. See, also The Grateful Dead Movie.  C'mon Jon and Chris; Are you ashamed of your baby pictures?

006074815X|5.0|EYE OF THE NEEDLE is a classic of the espionage genre, and very arguably, the best of Ken Follett's many works. Tensely and tautly written, Follett not only places us deftly inside each intricate scene, but also inside the minds of his characters, each of whom is a complex, multidimensional human being.<br /><br />In thrillers it is far too easy to fall back on stock characters and canned plots, but in EYE OF THE NEEDLE, Follett is writing history that might have been.<br /><br />The unexceptional Englishman Henry Faber is in reality the extraordinary German spy \\"Die Nadel\\" (The Needle), known for his secretiveness, his effectiveness, and his trademark stiletto. In the early months of 1944, The Needle discovers that the planned Allied invasion of the Pas de Calais is a vast hoax and that D-Day will occur at Normandy.<br /><br />While trying to get back to Berlin with this vital information, The Needle finds himself caught up in the unhappy marriage of Lucy and David. David is a mustered-out unblooded RAF fighter pilot who has been rendered a double amputee as the result of a freakish auto accident. Never having gotten into the cockpit and having been reduced to a helpless cripple (in his own mind), David takes his only pleasure in tormenting Lucy, a loving wife. When The Needle appears, handsome, sophisticated, and sexy, Lucy becomes his willing sexual partner.<br /><br />When Lucy realizes The Needle's true identity, a small war erupts on the isolated farmstead where she lives with David in his miserable emotional exile. A small war, by which hangs the balance of the World War.<br /><br />EYE OF THE NEEDLE is a book that is readable and re-readable many times over. Follett's gifted storytelling never palls, and this book retains its dynamism even after the ending is known. It is often counted as one of the top ten espionage tales ever written, and it deserves the honor.

0790742780|3.0|I've always found this to be an intriguing movie, and though it is no deep and profound commentary on our culture and behaviors, it does, nonetheless, touch on an issue of real importance in our society: the issue of social interaction  between strangers, and how it can go horribly wrong.  Bill Foster, the main character, is clearly presented in this movie as the bad guy.  He's emotionally unstable, demonstrably capable of extreme violence, and judging by his relationships with his ex-wife and his mother, not completely in touch with reality.  Nevertheless, as so many other reviewers here have noted, despite the fact of his bad guy status, one can't help but feel sympathetic with him.  There's really no mystery to this; we've all been faced with rude store clerks, snotty fast food cashiers, supercilious rich people, and so forth.  Some of us have even been face to face with violent, dangerous punks.  And probably all of us have fantasized about punching the smug, sneering face of the arrogant jerk in front of us in such situations.  Bill Foster is a sympathetic character because even though he overreacts violently (although I wouldn't call his response to the gang thugs, or the neo-nazi overreaction, as his life was truly threatened in those cases), in each case he IS genuinely provoked.  Not one of the strangers he confronts thoughout the course of the movie would have had anything to fear from him if they had simply treated him courteously and respectfully.<br /><br />This movie ought to be taken as just as much a warning about the potential consequences of certain behavior (in this case, rudeness) as another of Michael Douglas' movies, \\"Fatal Attraction\\" was about adultery.  It's never a bad idea to treat others with the same respect and courtesy you would want for yourself.  You never know what the person in front of you at any given moment is going through, or what that person may be capable of.  And although this is a movie, a work of fiction, we've all read about violent road rage encounters, and other incidents arising from seemingly the most trivial provocation.  Just the other day I read about someone shooting someone in line at a convenience store because the person ahead of him was taking too long to make a purchase, and responded rudely when urged to speed things up.  Don't go around being rude to people.  The stranger you snap peevishly at may just become angry enough to knock your block off.  And quite aside from fear of what others might do if you irritate them, being polite is simply the right thing to do.  And it costs you nothing, so why not just be polite to people?<br /><br />In this movie, Bill Foster throws off the restraint most of use every day when faced with such provocations and irritations, and soon finds himself the object of a manhunt by the police.  Even though he self-destructs in the end, and even though we are presented (in the form of Detective Prendergast) with a character who manages to cope with just as much stress and bad human behavior as Foster, we still feel a twinge of sympathy for Foster, right to the very end.lent road rage encounters, and other incidents arising from seemingly the most trivial provocation.

B000URDEB0|5.0|When it was announced that Tarja was being removed from the band, many Nightwish fans were in fear for the band's future. For quite a while, people wondered if they'd ever release another album at all.    Well, they found a new singer and released a new album, and it's fantastic. Anette is very different vocally than Tarja, but still a fantastic replacement, and Nightwish is thriving with her voice. In addition, the male vocals are better than ever--traditionally something of a weak point for Nightwish. The music is as epic and powerful as ever, but they've made some interesting experiments on this album, with some styles from around the world incorporated--styles which I don't think would have fit well with Tarja's operatic style, but work perfectly with Anette's voice.    Every fan of power/symphonic metal should own this album.

I refuse to act like an idiot and, whine over it! Both movies are spectacular!

1573225517|5.0|Nick Hornby has effectively redefined and given new meaning to the word 'Antihero.' The protagonist of High Fidelity is such a petulant childish bafoon that even I had to question just how selfish he could be at times, and that says a lot about him.    And that is what makes Rob so real, in my opinion. He's not perfect - or even sympathetic a great deal of the time - but you feel yourself rooting for him. It's almost as though he's the villain of the novel.    Rob is so original that you can't help but laugh at the horribly cynicaly life he leads, which is almost cynical to the point of being naive, if that makes any sense. I haven't been through a break-up in several years now, but I think that if I were to, this might be the male equivalent of a pint of ice cream and a show on the CW.
B000AMB21O|5.0|Very different from \\"El Topo\\" and \\"The Holy Mountain\\", \\"Santa Sangre\\" goes beyond the wakening of the inner self and rather shows a psychological horror drama.

B00005ONMP|5.0|From the first entrances, the symphonies and overtures of Felix Mendelssohn come alive under the expert direction of Maestro Claudio Abbado.  Sensitive phrasings and dynamics make the most of Mendelssohn's lyric melodic lines, helping to shape each work into a cohesive whole.  The \\"Hymn of Praise\\" contains some rather extreme dynamic levels, in my opinion, but overall, it is a stunning collection, with excellent soloists and choir.  I highly recommend the two-disc set to anyone fond of Mendelssohn's music!

B000002JSP|5.0|Let me preface this review by saying that I go WAY back with Led Zeppelin, having purchased all of their albums from \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" through \\"Coda\\" right off the rack.  (Yeah....being a teenager in the 70s was as great as the youngsters of today imagine it was:  Zeppelin, the Stones, KISS, Bowie, Alice Cooper, Funkadelic, etc, etc......aahhhhhh, what a time for music!)  Anyway, I do feel it's necessary to point out that I'm writing this review relative to buying the album as a NEW product, doing my best to steer clear of the hindsight of history.    Into my 4th decade as a LedHed, I'll go out on a limb here and say that this is perhaps MY FAVORITE Led Zeppelin album, a neck-and-neck photo-finish with \\"Physical Graffiti\\".  This recording has been often (and unfairly) criticized as \\"watered-down\\" Led Zeppelin, relying too heavily on the direction of John Paul Jones.  Jonesy's contributions are indeed at the essence of the sound of the album, but I don't hear that as a bad thing or that it somehow makes this \\"something less\\" of a Led Zeppelin album.  As other reviewers have noted, this was definitely a time of transition for the band, personally & musically.  They had matured into men in their 30s and the music scene dominance had shifted to disco & pop, with New Wave (and, to a lesser degree in America, punk) smashing at the gates, desperate to enter into new territory.  My opinion is that the music of this album was not a self-conscious change of direction for the band....it was simply a fresh change dictated by their personal environments, which included hearing new sounds on their radios and turntables.  Maturity (not to mention 'tragedy', and in Led Zeppelin's case, particularly Plant's) has a way of ushering in change.  The Beatles are the classic musicial example of growing up & moving on.    I vividly recall purchasing this album when it first hit the record racks, as did virtually everyone I knew.  Like all Zeppelin albums that preceeded it, it stayed on myturntable for weeks-on-end.  The moment my sister told me that John Bonham had died is forever burned into my memory, as if by a white-hot branding iron.  Bonzo's death was a tragedy in many ways to many people....not the least of which being that my sister & I were planning to get tickets to see the band at the Philadelphia Spectrum, the tour having been recently announced.  It was to have been the band's first trek through America since 1977.    Bonzo's death no doubt lends a poignancy to the album, particularly at the time when it was new and the tragic event actually happened.  I recall clearly that this poignancy was evident to me personally in the tracks \\"Carouselambra\\" and the album's closing number \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\".  With hindsight, I'm not sure why those particular tracks affected me that way, but they did....and still do, three decades later.  To this day, \\"Carouselambra\\" rates EXTREMELY high on my list of favorite Led Zeppelin songs.  I'll take it over \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" in a heartbeat.  (I can already picture the torch-carrying lynch mob at my heels, howling for my blood!)    ANYWAY.....The Music: \\"In The Evening\\" is a suberb opener; the spooky, ominous Jones organ introduction alerting us that something big is coming our way.  Zeppelin always did select GREAT opening tracks for their albums.  Classic, heavy Zeppelin sound here, with an added, undeniable maturity.  \\"South Bound Saurez\\" is a fabulous tune, one of the best on the album, light-hearted & bouncy, with great work all-around.  What a band this is!!  \\"Fool In The Rain\\" follows in this breezy vein, with a wonderful Latin-flavored bridge that always causes me to smile and to  immediately begin drumming on the closest object I can find.  I remember wondering at the time how they were going to play this song live.  \\"Hot Dog\\" wraps up Side A and it's a KILLER track, with superb work from Pagey, in particular.  Three light-hearted tracks in a row; is this REALLY a Led Zeppelin album?!?    Flip therecord to Side B and we're into the MAJOR event of the album: \\"Carouselambra\\".  It would be VERY difficult (if not downright impossible) to put into words what this track means to me, and perhaps this album review is not the place to get all misty-eyed over one of my favorite songs of all-time.....so I won't.  I will say that this 10-minute, 3-part opus is unquestionably Led Zeppelin at their finest and most mature: moody & glorious, mysterious & inspiring, all at the same time.  THIS is a textbook example of how to create and record a classic song.  DEFINITELY the album's centerpiece.  This gem is followed by another major event, \\"All My Love\\".  As a single it works extremely well, as evidenced by the innumerable times it's been played on rock radio....but it's too bad that radio has to play this flawless piece of work out of the context of the album because it's placed perfectly there, coming on the heels of \\"Carouselambra\\".  This song features some of Plant's most heartfelt lyrics and the orchestration courtesy of Jones' keyboards is simply stunning.  To wind up this classic album, we return to the agonized, blues-based sound that perhaps epitomizes Led Zeppelin: \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\".  Aaahhhhhhhhh.....sheer bliss!!  Featuring a nice introduction from Jonesy's keys and a lazy, lumbering tempo, Pagey lays down some blistering guitar work and Plant's banshee wail is at full, spine-tingling power.  A terrific close to the album and the recording career of Led Zeppelin.    It should be noted that, in addition to the album being heavily influenced by the keyboard work of John Paul Jones, Bonzo's drums are crisper-than-usual on the high-end & feature boldly in the mix, although this is not often noted.  If you're a fan of the endlessly-creative, stomping, brutal drumming of John Bonham, this album is right up your alley.    If you can possibly get your hands on a nice, clean copy of the vinyl, I recommend that you do so, as this is the preferrable way to hear this classic.  Actually, it's the best way to hear ANY Led Zeppelin album, in my opinion.  When I get a hankering to hear \\"In Through The Out Door\\", I usually always turn to the vinyl.  Just last night, I sat on my back porch in the chilly, misty Pennsylvania Autumn air and listened to this and \\"Physical Graffiti\\" back-to-back on vinyl.  It was a glorious way to spend a Friday night and was the inspiration to finally give this album it's due in the form of a review!    To those who haven't yet heard this brilliant recording, it will be impossible to hear it in the same \\"I-was-there-when-it-happened\\" context in which this review was written.....but you're in for a stunning experience nonetheless.  On a scale of 1 to 10 it rates a 12; it absolutely has my highest recommendation.  If you don't have this ESSENTIAL recording, what are you waiting for?!?  Get it NOW!!
B000OLROWC|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater as a teen and now my teen asked me to find it for him to watch. We downloaded it from unbox and it was so worth it.

B000059TFO|5.0|The voice of legendary WBZ personality Carl deSuze had none of its buoyancy that morning in 1964: \\"and if we sound differently this morning,it's because we feel differently..we all are different this morniing\\". I soon learned that the bodies of 3 civil rights workers had finally been found,dead as expected,shot then buried in an earthen dam in Philadelphia, Mississippi.The radio is not a medium well suited to cover stories such as this one; film and the cinema are highly superior (if used properly and in context). \\"Mississippi Burning\\" is a moving experience; heck,any number of actors could have played the lead roles. It's the number of top quality scenes that become etched in one's mind: the swamp search, the hanging outside the church, the burning cross, the backroom bar, Hackman administering a \\"close shave\\", the wife beating,the molotov cocktail, the courtroom, and countless other outrages make multiple viewings almost mandatory. See the movie, buy it, just don't miss it!

B000TSIK14|5.0|Man, was I positively surprised when I bought this record. Scorpions go from beautiful ballad to pounding heavy metal in this record. The concept is great, the cover art this time is not something I am ashamed to bring home (like Virgin Killer, though I do tip my hats off for stirring the controversy), and the production quality is top notch. Heck, they even use symphonic elements in Humanity. My favorite track on this record is 321. A really catchy rocker that stays in your head for weeks. I have family that don't even like Hard Rock/Heavy Metal and really enjoyed this song along with the others. I even enjoyed the presence of Billy Corgan on The Cross. Now keep in mind, I hate grunge or any of that alternative garbage that was released, but I really believe that Corgan's voice complemented Meine very well. I have to give Corgan a round of applause on this record (but Smashing Pumpkins still leaves a really bad taste). Many have complained that this record has too many ballads, but that did not bother me. I liked all of the songs on this record. Each song has its own energy. If you are an old time Scorpions fan, you will love this album. If you fairly new to the Scorpions, you will still like it (but I recommend that you listen to Blackout, Love at First Sting and Fly to the Rainbow first). Hope you guys like it as much as I did!!!

B000H7JD4K|5.0|Iron Maiden is probably my favorite band, however I do not appreciate EVERYTHING that they have done in the past (such as not keeping Smith and Dickinson). This record is by no means a Powerslave, however it is an excellent metal record. Fans of Iron Maiden and even the casual fan (although most metal fans are by no means casual fans) will enjoy this record. AMOLAD goes from more upbeat songs such as Different World, which really reminds me of Heaven can Wait in terms of its positivity (used loosely). These Colors Don't Run is also a great heavy song. My favorite song is the legacy. This track is a VERY different Iron Maiden, yet it still manages to capture the power this band has to offer. I really enjoyed the classical sounding intro to the heavy twin/triplet leads. You must beware of a few things on this record. The songs are a bit lengthy, but I personally believe Maiden pulls of the long songs. The production quality is by no means Somewhere in Time or SSOASS, but at the same time, Maiden wanted to produce a good raw record that represents war. And you've got to remember, this is NOT ST. ANGER. The production is not nearly that bad. I personally like this record a lot more than Fear of the Dark and No Prayer for the Dying and even Piece of Mind. Overall, I think this is a great metal album. I would give it 4.5 stars, but amazon does not have this function. If you like Heavy/traditional metal, this album is for you.
0679746323|4.0|This is a VERY detailed account of Mao's life and I give credit to the author for the research that went into this book. Anyone would be hard pressed to match that in a book in comparison. The 'outing' of Mao's atrocities are ghastly revealing and the power of mind control over his people is the worst revelation. The first 100 pages of this book are hard to get thru. I felt it lumbered a bit but after Mao is in charge, the flow is smoother and the description of Mao's relationships with Stalin and other world leaders is priceless.
6305428042|5.0|I own Hocus Pocus on VHS so it was only a matter of time before I purchased it on DVD. It is one of the greatest movie comedies about witches I have ever seen. Whomever buys it will not be dissapointed. The best part about this movie is that it can be viewed by all ages.  [[ASIN:6305428042 Hocus Pocus]]
B000UJCALI|4.0|I've just received this from the USA this morning [ I live in England ] and the first thing I had to do was compare the 'cropping' of this new DVD edition with the DVD from 2001 [ which was full screen flat ] , which I bought in Illinois, where I worked at the time.    The short answer is:  you're either gonna love it, or hate it.    Personally, I prefer the 2001 disc; what you're seeing there is the fully-exposed camera image, before the cropping that took place in the cinema, when the movie you were watching was projected, as per Kubrick's [ apparent ] wishes.    The problem with this new re-formatting, is that you lose information from the top and bottom of the frame - and it doesn't look right, it feels squashed and uncomfortable.    The image is less sharp than the 2001 transfer, too - not greatly, but it's definitely there, and those of us with an eye for these things will notice it.    The saving grace though is the commentary by Baxter and Garrett Brown, the Steadicam operator on 'The Shining'.  Tremendous!  Full of insights into the production from Garrett, Baxter's comments being largely redundant.      A second disc has three new featurettes, which are interesting as far as they go, but nothing particularly illuminating or special.  Ironically, the fourth ' Special Feature' on this second disc, is the best by far - Vivian Kubrick's masterful documentary on her father's film, which was previously on the 2001 edition.    The long and short of it is this:  Like the Ultimate Editions of the Bond movies from last year, if you're a true fan, you'll want both versions - but KEEP AHOLD OF YOUR 2001 EDITIONS !
B000T05R8Q|2.0|The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is one of the most important albums in rock history and a singular work of genius by the late great Syd Barrett.  It is a perfect testament to a brief moment in London history, that like the Summer of Love in the Haight, was essentially over by the time the public figured out it was happening.  Only the people who were there in 66 and 67 will know what it was really like.  As a big fan of Barrett and his muse I had high expectations of what a 40th anniversary edition might be like.  For the most part it is one huge bummer. Let's get the biggest atrocity out of the way first before reviewing the package content.      As a Floyd fan, I am really disgusted with the surviving band members for the lack of their personal contributions and recollections, their memories of this most special album.  Come on!!  This is the big 40th special edition, it's a groundbreaking album, and Syd just passed away.  Could there have been a bigger MISSED OPPORTUNITY GUYS for the inclusion of a page or two from Roger, Rick, Nick, even Dave and Norman Smith?  For such a big moment, I would think each could have taken a moment to contribute their personal memories of the sessions, their views on Piper's place in history, and most importantly a bit of gratitude to their recently fallen band leader.  But of course there must be some liner notes by a journalist, or some studio notes from Abbey Road, right?  No.  Nada.  They may have some lame reason why this wasn't feasible, frankly I don't care.  Guys with their power could have made something very special happen here if they had the will, sadly, they did not.  But think for a moment how cool those pages of personal notes would have been in this little book format they released.  Rant over.      Let's take a look at what you get for your money, considering that many of you have already purchased Piper several times in various forms.  You get two versions of the actual remastered album, the stereo version and the mono version.  This is nice for mono fans and audiophiles with trained ears who can appreciate the differences.  Then there is the all important bonus third disc of extras.  This is where many Floyd fans are frustrated, wishing they had released all of the missing lost recordings like Vegetable Man, Scream Thy Last Scream, etc...My understanding is that they chose to stick with only the songs that were a product of the actual Piper sessions and not get into the slightly later stuff.  Whether this is the real reason or whether they just saw more opportunity in releasing those in yet another package is for Floyd fans to debate.  On this bonus disc you will get Arnold Layne, See Emily Play, and Paintbox which were already out there on Relics.  The more interesting items are Candy And A Current Bun and Apples And Oranges (two versions), two singles.  These are really nice psychedelic pop songs though probably not as strong as Piper tracks.  Then there is an alternate version of Matilda Mother and two different versions of Interstellar Overdrive.  These are very cool because Syd never really did anything the same way twice.  As with Syd's solo work, \\"alternate versions\\" are gold because they are often like another new song, a completely different take or feel.  That is not so much the case here because Syd had more constraints than he would have later, but they're different enough to get excited about for Barrett fans.  So if you don't care about a mono mix, and you don't care about these different versions, there is really no reason to spend the extra money if you own the standard Piper.       Let's move on to the packaging.  Looks impressive on the web scans, doesn't it?  It's nothing to get too excited about.  For all that packaging, you get a few pages with lyrics and photos.  The reproduction of Syd's collage notebook is of interest to very hard core Syd devotees and those folks will already have this in their possession.  For the regular Floyd fan this little 12 page booklet will mean nothing more than what their 2nd grader brought home from art class.  Syd's artistic jottings and musings are nice but they are not exactly as essential as his music.  That's all there is.  The package itself is of fair quality, I have a hunch that the glued portion of the construction may not hold up that well if one opens it often to remove CDs, but we'll see.  The CDs are held in digipak holders glued to the inside and back covers.  The back one that holds discs 2 and 3 is really cheesy, they place one disc partially over the other so that they can touch, and so you must remove the top disc if you want to get the one on the bottom.  Sure it's not the end of the world, but again, this is Pink Floyd.  You would think they could afford to do this thing up really nice.  Maybe they decided they'd try harder for the 50th anniversary.      Piper (and Pink Floyd, and Syd) are favorites of mine.  I don't mean to be overly negative here but I wanted to make sure people realize this \\"Special Edition\\" is mostly hype...ZERO LINER NOTES for Chrissakes...so they don't spend extra money if these little tidbits are not important to them personally.  I am really amazed this is the best they could do, given their budget freedoms and the importance of this material.  This is 5-star music but this release is 2 stars, for hard core fans and collectors only.  Everyone else should stick with their regular Piper remaster until the 50th anniversary edition is released.  Hopefully Roger will grace us with a few of his wise musing at that time.  [In the meantime, Syd fanatics will get far more bang for their buck with the new Mick Rock book, featuring tons of stunning rare Syd photos and sincere interesting recollections of their personal friendship.  Another great book is John Cavanaugh's \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" which is a no-nonsense detailing of the Piper sessions for under $10 bucks here at Amazon.  If you love this album, it's a must read to learn how the masterpiece was created.]
0894803123|4.0|Just what I was looking for. A great book with lots of different flavors of ice cream. Also gives great advice on how to make fruit flavored ice creams.  Best part is the recipes are quick with no cooking required for a great tasting ice cream.
0790729393|5.0|This chilling story of sexual torture and rape rings true to me.  I also endured sexual abuse in an all female boarding school.  In my opinion, no one would fabricate this abuse history for entertainment purposes or financial gain.  Whether the trial took place as it is depicted or not, is irrelevant to me.  Whether the revenge was a Fantasy or Reality is a moot point; it makes an abuse survivor/victim feel vindicated as he or she views it.  The neighborhood ambience portrayed of Hell's Kitchen seems startlingly accurate.  I recommend it highly as an educational tool to illustrate the unimaginable horror and permanent, invisible scars inflicted by pedophilia.
B000UR366S|5.0|I have listened to Joni's music for close to 30 years now. \\"Shine\\" describes perfectly what she does to those who love her music. Having the great benefit of seeing her live in concert 4 times, I can only embrace her new release even more. She is ultimately the hippest and coolest female musician out there. Try listening to her album on a clear dark night while driving around town when the traffic has died town. Look around and listen. You will get it.
0634022296|5.0|This is a great book:  - It has great songs (even not written by the Beatles)  - It has diagrams for all chords  - It simply got it right. Sounds much better than I anticipated.
0671799320|5.0|Fascinating account of the history of the oil industry. I would say that just the four chapters on World War II--and the oil role in it--are worth the book. Reads like a novel, where Yergin jumps back and forth between history and details about the industry main players. And the amount of details that enrich the historic account is just perfect. The research done to put this work together must have been mind boggling.
B00005JO5L|1.0|I was drawn to this film because I was told it wasn't as bad as it's reputation suggests and may have been ahead of it's time.  What time?  The Stone Age?!  Every print of this flick should be burned and banned from human consumption.  I've never been accused of being a champion of gay rights but I smell class action suit here.  This flick is seamy and has no socially redeeming qualities.  William Friedkin's direction is clueless.  Al Pacino, in probably his worst performance, seems puzzled as to how to play his character.  The script is consistently incoherent.  The lone saving grace in this film is Paul Sorvino's portrayal of a police captain.  Run from this flick if you ever get the urge.
B000002AAC|4.0|NOTE: I meant to give this album 3 stars, but accidentally gave it 4.     I'm a huge ELO fan from way back, and I've just recently been listening to their albums for the first time in many years. I can't comment on the CD version of this album because I only have it on vinyl.     I loved \\"Discovery\\" when it came out (I turned 13 that year), but I have to admit that it has aged poorly, more so than any of my other ELO albums. The disco sound is too strong on some songs (\\"Shine A Little Love,\\" \\"Last Train to London,\\" and \\"On the Run\\"--all of which used to be favorites). There are three ballads: \\"Need Her Love,\\" \\"Midnight Blue,\\" and \\"Wishing.\\" The only one I ever liked much was \\"Midnight Blue,\\" but now they all sound corny and weak, especially \\"Need Her Love.\\" The only song on the album that completely holds up after all these years is \\"Don't Bring Me Down,\\" which is, was, and always will be a stomping pop music monster, somewhat in the vein of their earlier hit, \\"Do Ya.\\"     On the plus side, ELO was at the height of its craft when this album was made. They knew how to emphasize a good hook, and the vocal harmonies and overall musicianship are excellent. If you love ELO, this album will be worth your while, but if you are just getting into them, you will do better to start with \\"Out of the Blue,\\" which came out just before this one and has more of a spacey prog rock feel. \\"Discovery\\" took them a little too far into the realm of pure pop.
B000HBKCDC|4.0|Let me state upfront that I am generally quite sceptical of mainstream artists a Christmas album. Like clockwork, out they come every year in October. For whatever eason, I 'dismissed' when this album came out a year ago, but with a renewed push now that the Christmas season is upon us (in other words, October, according to the music industry), curiousity got the better of me and I had to check this out.<br /><br />\\"Wintersong\\" (12 tracks; 46 min.) starts off tentatively with a straight-forward cover of John Lennon's \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\", arguably the weakest song on the album. After that things immediately get a lot better, with a great adaption of the traditional \\"What Child Is This\\", followed by an intimate cover of Joni Mitchell's \\"River\\", and then the title track, the only new song McLachlan wrote for this album. Other highlights include \\"The First Noel/Mary Mary\\", with soaring vocals from MacLachlan, \\"Song for a Winter's Night\\" (which actually was recorded in 1994, according to the liner notes), and \\"In the Bleak Mid-Winter\\", another traditional beautifully arranged by McLachlan (you can just feel the Canadian cold coming through your speakers!).<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty terrific Christmas album. It reminded me in theme and atmosphere of Over the Rhine's excellent first Christmas album \\"The Darkest Night of the Year\\" (OtR has just release an equally impressive sequel CD, called \\"Snow Angels\\"). Meanwhile, I know that I will be playing \\"Wintersong\\" a lot this coming winter.
B000AA4JMU|5.0|The 1969 Academy Award winning Best Picture will leave you singing for a week.  A wonderful musical adaptation of Charles Dickens' OLIVER TWIST, it makes for a wonderful evening of family entertainment.  While rated G, there is some violence and darkness that may be a little too much for very young children. Set in 19th Century England, it conveys in a light hearted but yet sober manner the social problems prevalent then, especially child labor which Dickens tried to portray. Although a hefty two and half hours long, the time goes fast. The music is upbeat, the costumes and choreography and settings are all terrific.  Well deserving of all its honors-a classic for the ages. For a few dollars more, get the DVD/SOUNDTRACK combo.  It's well worth it. WWW.LUSREVIEWS.BLOGSPOT.COM
B000RMQH30|4.0|Ben Harper & the Innocent Criminals have not been slacking lately: last year they released the double-CD \\"Both Sides of the Gun\\" album, followed by a long world tour. At the end of the European leg of that tour in November 2006, the band holed up in a Paris studio and recorded this album in just a matter of one week (not sure why it then took another 10 months or so before the actual release).<br /><br />\\"Lifeline\\" (11 tracks; 41 min.) brings yet another facet of Ben Harper, this time the relaxed singer-songwriter. This becomes immediately clear on the opener \\"Fight Outta You\\". Combining folk, soud and country rock, the band brings a more focused effort than on many of its previous studio albums.  \\"Fool for a Lonesome Train\\" is similar in tempo and atmosphere to \\"Fight Outta You\\". \\"Say You Will\\" brings a livelier sound, with glimpses of gospel even, and as such stands apart from the mostly introvert sound of the album. The title track closes the album, and is mostly Ben and acoustic guitar, nothing more, nothing less, a great way to finish up the album.<br /><br />I rate this album 4 stars because it improves over last year's \\"Both Sides of the Gun\\" album, which simply was all over the place (and would have been much stronger had it been whittled down to a single CD). That said, I still have not heard the 'perfect' Ben Harper studio album, as his live shows surpass anything he's done in the studio.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I have to say that this album has taken me by surprise.    I never was a huge Creed fan.....maybe a casual fan at best but I never owned a Creed album.  I listened to some of their stuff after they broke up and actually knew about Myles Kennedy from that Rock Star movie.  Had seen that and was impressed by his voice just in that limited role he played.  I read somewhere in a blurb that he was added to the former Creed lineup for Alter Bridge and bougfht that album a year or so ago.    That first album was a pretty good album.  Nothing great, but pretty good rock.  None descript really, but I am a bit melodic rock fan and it was decent fare, decent enough for me to look forward to the next release.  That sophomore disc is always so pivotal in a band's life to know whether the first one was a one-shot wonder or if the band has any legs.    All I can say is that this album is incredibly good.  I am an old school guy that likes to buy full albums and has never bought singles.  Even though that is the case, I invariably get into a rotation on any disc where I will listen to only a few of the songs because the rest is just filler.      All of that to say this - Blackbird is one of the VERY few albums that I own that each and every song stands alone on its own and is worth a listen.  I gotta say, I have listened to this album solid for over a week now and it gets stronger and stronger.  The songwriting is dynamite.  the drumming is incredible and Mark's guitar work is getting better and better as well.  I have really grown to apprecaite him as a guitarist and love some of the riffs and changes he comes up with.    Most importantly, Myles' voice is just insanely good. Man, what a talent.  The funny thing is that I have never really been much of a vocalist type of listener - I have always listened to music concentrating on the pure musical portion....a good guitar riff, a good drummer.  Myles has a voice that is just really, really strong - he is a Jeff Scott Soto type of voice that just brings the music to another level.  Piercing.    I could go on...suffice it to say that this is a masterful record.  I only hope that it finds an audience - what a shame if it doesn't.  What with how screwball rock radio is today, it is a crapshoot as to whether this disc will hit its intended audience, but I truly hope that this one hits home with many.  WELL WORTH THE MONEY.  BUY THIS RECORD.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Do you remember when you were 10 years old and you got that one Christmas gift that you wanted more than anything else in the world? For that one moment, everything was right...there was nothing but joy. Well, with Alter Bridge's new album, Blackbird, all 59:17 is like that one special moment.   Whether you're one of the loyal fans counting down the days to its release, or a new listener, you realize you're in for a treat from the first 6 seconds of \\"Ties That Bind\\". The band has put forth an album that pleases all rock fans.  If you like your rock a little heavy, then \\"Ties That Bind\\", \\"Buried Alive\\", \\"Coming Home\\", and, especially, \\"White Knuckles\\", will more than deliver the goods. If you like a slow song to introduce someone to the band, then let him/her have a listen to \\"Watch Over You\\". It is one of those songs that makes you want to hold up your lighter while you're listening. If you want melodic rock that begs to be played in 20,000 + person-capacity arenas, then \\"Before Tomorrow Comes\\", \\"Brand New Start\\". \\"Come To Life\\", \\"One By One\\", and \\"Rise Today\\" will make you pump your fist. Lastly, if you want an epic song that defines exactly who the band truly is, then \\"Blackbird\\", the title track, is that song. Every band craves that one song, their \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" -song, and Alter Bridge has found it with \\"Blackbird\\".   Each of the components of Alter Bridge is on full display for your listening pleasure. Mark Tremonti has established himself as the top guitarist in rock music today. His riffs, while always impressive, hit a new high. His solos, especially on \\"Brand New Start\\", will keep aspiring guitarists scratching their heads and reaching for their picks. He and Myles Kennedy will surely go down as one of the great duos in rock guitar history. They will join the likes of Angus and Malcolm Young (AC/DC), KK Downing and Glenn Tipton (Judas Priest), Adrian Smith and Dave Murray (Iron Maiden), and Matthias Jabs and Rudolph Schenker (Scorpions). But, what istruly special about Myles Kennedy is that none of those duos also have the ability to be the lead singer of their respective bands. Myles' voice will soon be one of the most recognized in rock music today. His ability to shine with slower and heavier songs show the range that most lead singers fail to possess. Scott Phillips and Brian Marshall establish backing rhythm that is purely special. Listen to \\"White Knuckles\\" to hear them on full display. Also, if you're lucky enough to own the \\"Best Buy\\" version, then listen to Brian on the bonus track \\"The Damage Done\\"...awesome! Expect each of the musicians to be featured in all of their respective instrument-magazines because everyone will want to play like them.   Every so often a band comes along that makes music that makes you feel good. No matter what type of mood you're in, you just feel good. Alter Bridge is that type of band...and Blackbird is that type of album. Every album I have ever owned has at least one song that you skip or fast-forward through. The biggest compliment that I can give to Alter Bridge is that this is the first album I've ever listened to that I did not have to/want to do that.    Whether you're listening to Blackbird alone with headphones on or driving in your car cranking it loud, realize that you're listening to greatness. I was fortunate enough to listen to that greatness on October 9th, 2007. The best part of it all, is that I get to listen to that greatness again tomorrow, and the next day, and the next...
0316067598|5.0|What an incredible book.  I read it twice, back to back.  A true American Hero.
0440238609|4.0|I like to think of myself as a person who can read something from a point of view that differs greatly from my own, and still find the merit in it.  This is not one of those phony concepts such as \\"celebrating diversity\\"; rather I like to think this is what \\"free thinking\\" is all about.  Perhaps I'm still naive enough to believe that a person can be of any creed or religion or lack thereof, and still be a free thinker (and likewise, also prone to deceit).    \\"His Dark Materials\\" has all the elements of a great story.  Engaging characters, underlying themes, tension, and mystery are but a few of the beautifully combined features of the series.  Pullman has a rare gift of being able to make an unconventional character, such as a 12 year old boy who has been evading shadowy stalkers much of his life, plausible and entertaining.  His manner of weaving the mundane world we know into the realm of fantasy, and tying in ancient ideas of alchemy with modern physics, works on a literary level without the need for massive suspension of disbelief.  As a fantasy author, he trumps almost every effort that preceded him, and most of his colleagues as well.    I interpret Pullman's theme a bit differently than many others.  I don't see it as anti God or anti religious, despite my knowledge that Pullman is a devout secular humanist.  I rather interpret his theme as promoting the self reliance of humankind.  Pullman's actual message is very uplifting if one can look past the exterior and see the form.  It's a positive affirmation that human beings are capable of creating a heavenly republic if they choose to do so.  If my analysis is true to the author's intent, I couldn't see how either the devoutly religious or the firmly atheistic could disagree with the message.    Nevertheless, no book is perfect, and especially, the Amber Spyglass begins to degenerate.  I can only guess that Pullman was either racing a deadline with this volume, or got careless in his zest to promote a personalconviction.  It is reasonably entertaining, but here is where Pullman's devices begin to get rusty and defective.  This book is the culmination of much of his own personal philosophy, which I respect despite its differences with my own.    Unfortunately, Pullman does something of a hackneyed job delivering the mantra of numerous characters, relatively undeveloped previous to this volume.  Assumptions characters make to describe their motivations lack the most basic axiomatic justification, making the reader feel as if Pullman is simply spewing rhetoric at them.  I don't want to spoil anything with this review, so I will leave this as a warning to the reader that things do get somewhat feeble near the end.  It is truly a shame, because Pullman is capable of masterful character growth.  Amber Spyglass is still a good story and HDM is delightful to read, so it comes with the highest recommendations despite the few slipshod ipse dixits interstitially woven into the text.  Take the books for all the good their worth, and enjoy the read.
B000068FXR|5.0|I first bought this album when it came out on vinyl in the 70's.  I became a Supertramp fan back then and am still so now nearly 30 odd years on. I guess soft rock is one of my favourite music genres and \\"Crisis? What Crisis?\\" fills the bill admirably. I'm happy that I was able to obtain a copy on CD.
B000R7GKQE|4.0|We really liked the first season of Supernatural because of its original theme (we love watching scary movies and shows) and because the repartee between the two stars gets to be funny sometimes. Not to mention the fact that both stars are quite hunky. This second season has the same type of stories as the first season, however we found that the writing was a little too soft at the beginning and in the middle of the season, between the 3rd and the 10th episodes. We were actually considering not to buy the next season when it goes on sale, however, as we watched the last 12 episodes of this season we were hooked again. Now we're really looking forward to see the 3rd Season.

0374280967|4.0|Once upon a time the Queen of England was walking her dogs in the Buckingham Palace gardens when they took an interest in the bookmobile parked behind the palace kitchens.  When the dogs refused to come back to her, Queen Elizabeth went to retrieve them and decided to borrow a book from the mobile library just to be polite.  Before she knew it, one book led to another, and the good Queen became an avid reader and lived happily ever after.<br /><br />Alan Bennett's The Uncommon Reader is a laugh-out-loud novella that does indeed read like a fairy tale at times but the little book packs a lot into its 120 pages.  Avid readers will recognize themselves in Queen Elizabeth as she exercises her \\"reading muscle\\" and progresses from reading anything suggested to her by others to falling in love with \\"new\\" authors and more serious literature.  They also will recognize the reactions of the Queen's family and staff who are somewhat bewildered to find that she carries a book with her wherever she goes and has lost interest in many of the things that previously kept her busy.  Not only do they not understand her new love of reading, they come to resent her for it, and some even suspect that she is showing the first signs of senility.<br /><br />Her move along the road to a new sensibility and self-awareness allows Elizabeth to make some observations that are guaranteed to put smiles on the faces of book lovers.  At a reception in Canada, for instance, she remarks to one Canadian minister, \\"Can there be any greater pleasure than to come across an author one enjoys and then to find they have written not just one book or two, but at least a dozen.\\"<br /><br />On another occasion, when being briefed by a befuddled member of her staff who does not understand why she suddenly prefers reading to his briefings, she tells him that \\"...briefing is not reading.  In fact, it is the antithesis of reading.  Briefing is terse, factual and to the point.  Reading is untidy, discursive and perpetually inviting.  Briefing closes down a subject, reading opens it up.\\"<br /><br />For a while, the sheer joy of reading is enough for Elizabeth as she begins to regard the world and those around her with a new empathetic understanding.  But, as her self-awareness continues to grow, she comes to believe that she is meant to be not only a reader but also a writer.  That is the twist that leads to Alan Bennett's unexpected, but perfect, ending to his charming little tale.  This one will be special to book lovers everywhere.efing closes down a subject, reading opens it up.\\"     For a while, the sheer joy of reading is enough for Elizabeth as she begins to regard the world and those around her with a new empathetic understanding.

B000Q6GUW0|4.0|I just finished all 12 episodes of this fantastic show today and can gladly report that, yes, it is above and beyond good. This is definitely a groundbreaking serial, as it's the first one I can think of that portrays a serial killer in a sympathetic light.<br /><br />What many viewers will have a problem with, though, is that after a point one starts empathizing with Dexter and you go `He's just like me!', and of course you then have to remind yourself that you're not a serial killer. But that's the point. The show makes you understand that everyones human and has a bit of a bizarre streak - and all of us have weird extremes that only we know about. Dexter is not perfect - in fact, he is delusional yet perfectly functional.<br /><br />The part I related to the most was the depiction of Dexter as someone with no heart at all. He is unable to feel. The show places him in these moments where any normal man would feel extreme joy or pain, but Dexter is never moved by any extreme. As it stands, he has no feelings for anyone, and is thoroughly self-absorbed in his own world.<br /><br />Remember one thing though - Dexter is sort of a modern day Robin Hood here - he only kills people who he thinks deserves to die, and people who he's earmarked as `bad'. Obviously this is very relative, but he always chooses people who've done horrible things. Towards the end, you will find yourself morbidly agreeing with each of Dexter's choice of victim.<br /><br />The supporting cast is also excellent. Particular mention should be made of the actress playing Dexter's sister. Both actors lend their characters so much personality - in fact the lead role is perfectly cast. It was refreshing to see a role post `Six Feet Under' where this talented actor could actually shine on his own.<br /><br />However, there is a lot of blood here, and a lot of gore. Much of it is implied, but this is a dark, brooding show that doesn't shy away from the morbid and macabre. In fact, it almost celebrates it. On the DVD, the red hues of blood are brought to life in HD detail - this is one manic gorefest, and some scenes cannot be easily forgotten.

B000T17ZY4|5.0|I just love this Cd! I travel with my job and listen to it all day. It has a calming effect!
B000ULQV0W|5.0|I just saw the movie tonight, and within minutes of the opening credits, I knew I'd buy this soundtrack.  It's simply awesome.  I can't find the words to describe how it affected me at a soul level.  I've always loved Eddie Vedder's voice, but this time, he's surpassed everything he's ever done with Pearl Jam.  And those of you who love this CD, do yourself a favor and go see the movie.  I think we'll see some Oscar nominations come from it.

B00005JPRF|3.0|As with Live Free or Die Hard, this movie will come to dvd in an unrated format. The movie has probably the worst editing of scenes in a horror film since Friday the 13th Part 7: the New Blood. Just when you think your going see some cool gore, it cuts away. Its a given this movie will come out unrated. I thought the movie went by fast and the story didnt seem to gel. I still enjoyed some scenes but it does seem a bit rushed. Enjoyable if you dont follow storys and want violence.
B000VL9XNI|5.0|I was eagerly awaiting this release. and it certainly didn't disapoint! As much as I liked \\"Family Jewels\\", I like this much better. Why? Well mainly because it's AC/DC live in front of an audience, which is what they do best. And also because it also covers the years from 1996 to 2003, which Family Jewels doesn't touch. I'm a fan of both Bon and Brian, and both have great showcases here. I particularly enjoy the old historical footage on disc 1 that shows AC/DC in some of their early club performances. It's easy to see how they built their legend in Australia (especially the black and white St Albans and the color Myers Music Bowl footage). And disc 2 shows how they've kept the legend going all the way to today. The extras on here are great too, encluding interviews and TV spots and promos over the years. Plus the portion of the 1983 Houston Summit show on disc 3 is a great mini-concert. So while there's no complete shows on here there's a good reason for that. It's a retrospective and they can get much more on the way it was done. Besides the 3 disc set is 7 hours long as it is and we all have full length AC/DC concert DVD's at home anyway. There's been a little complaining about sound quality on other reviews, but as it states on the package the clips were chosen here for historical reasons first and foremost and some of them we're lucky still exist at all. Trying to mix this for surround considering the varying sources these clips came from and varying quality would have been a huge undertaking. Early VHS and 3/4\\" video cameras had limited audio capabilty anyway, but nothing here is unlistenable. Besides if you're Joe Audio and have to have everything in 5.1 you probably have Donnington or Stiff Upper Lip anyway. No, instead enjoy this set as it was meant to be, a must have for any and all AC/DC fans as a testament to the greatest live rock and roll band ever! Enjoy
B000W01G3I|2.0|I just opened the dvd about 10 mins. ago and was disappointed as soon as I saw the packaging.

0141439475|4.0|In the spirit of Halloween, I've sought out a piece of famous literature to review: Frankenstein.<br /><br />It starts off with Captain Robert Walton's expedition through the icy waters of the north. Lonely, unschooled and with an awkward affinity for men, Walton haplessly finds Victor Frankenstein near death on the tundra. He takes him aboard ship, EAGERLY befriends him and nurses him to health like Florence Nightengale. Frankenstein then takes over the story as he tells Walton all about how he came so close to dying as he pursued a \\"monster\\" over the freezing plains.<br /><br />Victor is a major outcast, antisocial and withdrawn. Though difficult to get close to, he does latch clingingly to those who manage to connect with him. He finds success as a student at the University of Ingostadt. There, author Mary Shelley lets us know in the vaguest way possible that, Victor discovers the \\"secret of life.\\" He develops a God complex and vows to create a new race of beings who will worship him. His only successful subject, patched together from dead body parts, is \\"The Monster.\\" Victor immediately abhors this wretch and casts him out, realizing that this was a really bad idea to begin with.<br /><br />Just when Frankenstein thinks he can just go on his merry way and live life like nothing ever happened, news reaches him of his little brother having been killed. When Victor returns home for the funeral, the monster seeks him out and takes over the story, eloquently spinning a dreadful yarn about loss and abandonment. The Monster is not happy at all with Victor, his god, creator, master, who sent him away out of disgust at his physical form. The Monster is expressed as being 8 feet tall, disfigured in the face and able to move at superhuman speed. None of this reminds me of Boris Karloff, making the novel a stranger story than the movies.<br /><br />The Monster reveals to Victor that he did kill his brother, that he learned to speak and read no thanks to him and that his benevolent nature had been twisted into something cruel and terrible thanks to society's intolerance for people who look differently. Pissed off at having to live life in hiding, the Monster says that he will kill everyone Victor loves unless his \\"god\\" does this for him:<br /><br />make him a mate - someone as gruesome as he is, to live happily with, refusing the rest of the world in peace.<br /><br />All three voices - Walton's, Frankenstein's and the Monster's are well done but Shelley doesn't step into the male role very well at all. Some of the dialogue between seemingly heterosexual men could come right out of a novel with Fabio splashed on the cover. But I felt sorry for the Monster and I think Frankenstein was a jerk and had it coming. I'm still very awed at how different the novel is from the movies, which were apparently adapted from the stage plays. I think I better appreciate the novel, an instant success upon publication.d into something cruel and terrible thanks to society's intolerance for people who look differently.

B000VL9XNI|3.0|I agree with Brian on many of his points and I have a few things to say about this 3 DVD set..  I bought it today (3 DVD set) at Best Buy for $34.99. IF you bought a Audio CD Sampler they have avaiable of PLUG ME IN.. ONLY thru Best Buy for $1.99..you get a coupon with the CD worth $3.00 off the price of either DVD set. They are selling the 2 DVD set for $16.99. Both of these prices last until 10PM on October 20th.  As far as the quality of this set and the 3rd DVD...Here goes  The sequencing on this is dissapointing...AND for those of you have acquired AC/DC video material in the past (bootlegs)..you also know that most of these performances are not only out of sequence..but are also INCOMPLETE...like some songs were left off the DVD intentionaly.  This is quite evident in the Bon Scott material.   I have a great ROIO DVD (called LIVE WIRE...LIVE FROM EUROPE 1977-1978 from the Captain Video Label) of all three of the Bon Scott Concerts from the Rock Goes to College, Sight and Sound and the Apollo Glasgow Scotland..and they are all COMPLETE performances and I have to say actualy BETTER video quality than what's provided on this disc. The audio on this DVD is in sync with a Stereo mix and is outstanding..but songs are missing..and some of these songs that are missing are on the Family Jewels DVD set..i.e. RIFF RAFF from the Glasgow is the first song..with R& R Damnation is second and so on..  The 1983 Summit Houston TX concert is of excellent quality for its day..being shot on 3/4\\" videotape (Video geeks will know what this is) and the audio is a \\"live mix \\" from the video..not post produced in stereo or anything..just a basic 2 channel mono mix with the mix at the mercy of the FOH audio engineer. BUT as the other concerts on here..it is INCOMPLETE....the concert IS played in sequence for what was played on the Flick Of The Switch tour..but its missing the 5 last songs of the concert....after Hells Bells which is the last song on the disc..its missing Highway To Hell, Whole Lotta Rosie, Let There Be Rock, T.N.T. & For Those About To Rock.  The interview stuff on the 3rd DVD is interesting, but IMO not really enough to buy the 3 DVD set.  The only reason to have the Bonus disc iS if you really want/love the Flick Of The switch tour for the Houston TX show. The poster (which is pretty cool...but), backstage passes, ticket stubs, etc..that are included in the 3 DVD set are all to me just a waste of time/material unless you are into that kinda memorabilia. Instead of the memorablila stuff..I myself would have rather had another DVD included with COMPLETE & in sequence concerts from the Fly On The Wall, Who Made Who, or Blow Up Your Video tours..which ARE in existance!
B000WSL5Y0|5.0|This is a confident and assured directing-debut for Ben Affleck.  He has proven to be a good screenwriter (he co-wrote this one, as well as the Oscar-winning script to GOOD WILL HUNTING), but has been prett spotty as an actor.  Sometimes his choices were poor and sometimes his performances too.  He is obviously very intelligent and capable...but that doesn't always come through in his performances.    With GONE BABY GONE, filmed in Affleck's beloved and familiar Boston...he has established himself as an outstanding director.  There aren't any fancy tricks or special-effects here.  Just an understanding of how to set mood and how to give good actors space to operate.    The movie (based on the novel by Dennis Lenhane, who also wrote MYSTIC RIVER) tells the story of two low-rent private eyes (Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan) who are hired by grieving relatives to help the police in their search for a 4 year old missing girl.  The belief is that people who won't talk to the police will talk to them.  This proves to be an astute assumption, as the two investigators (who are also a loving couple) quickly make headway.    Regulations apparently compel the police to cooperate, so two veteran detectives (Ed Harris and John Ralston) assist the couple in their work...and vice versa.  I liked the fact that there was tension between the two groups (which we certainly come to expect when we see similar scenarios in movies) but it fairly rapidly is lightened when it becomes clear that the two private eyes are actually making progress and the two cops are actually willing to act on this information and to take some risks themselves.    I'm going to leave the plot there...suffice it to say that no one is quite who they appear to be.  It is an intersting and surprise-packed story on the surface...and that's almost good enough...just watching the case unfold and the twists get revealed.  But what earns this film an extra star is the moral and ethical tale just beneath the surface.  These characters grapple with moral choices, and the movie shows over and over that our consciences and religious beliefs may be tightly held and admirably adhered to...but they can nonetheless get us into serious trouble.  As viewers, we understand fairly clearly what we think everyone OUGHT to do...but we also feel the pain of internal conflict when they don't.  Because we understand their internal battles.  And we also feel for them when they live with the consequences of their prideful stubborness.  Doing the right thing isn't cut and dried in this film at all.    Pretty much everyone in the film does great work.  Special mention should go to Casey Affleck, an actor that I've pretty much paid no attention to.  Well, he's having a great year (with this film and THE ASSASINATION OF JESSE JAMES...) and he's an interesting performer.  Unconventional looking and seemingly a little slow and sleepy-eyed...his character bursts forth with shocking actions and bravery.  He uses bluster to get out of sticky situations...but you can also easily tell that he's probably quivering in his boots at the same time.    The film isn't perfect.  Michelle Monaghan's character is both underwritten and underplayed.  I think this movie stretched her skills just past her breaking point.  She isn't awful...but I was distracted by her lack of convincing reactions in many scenes.  And a couple of brief flashback scenes go by SO quickly, and they're so important, that I think I may have missed a couple of minor points of plot developments.    Quibbles aside...this is a stirring, adult, thought-provoking, well-acted, well-written and SURPRISE, well-directed thriller.  I HIGHLY recommend it.
B000P0J024|5.0|This is the Haley's comet of musical collaborations.  Never again in our lifetime will such a cosmic convergence grace us - truly a gift for the ages. The DVD, although far too short, is worth every penny, granting us glimpses of greatness, just being themselves, simply good friends who love music (and yes who just happen to be some of the most influential musicians of the past 40 years.)
0316018953|4.0|Other reviewers seem to be disappointed devotees of Connelly and his detective. This is my first acquaintance with them so I do not have the adverse comparisons to make . It is a short, fast moving detective story, and I for one did not anticipate the ending. If you want an easy, exciting read for your flight or vacation I can recommend it as a topical crime thriller. It will entertain but not stretch the mind.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|Hi to All, I am from Hungary and recently purchased this CD from Amazon. I am a Mark Knopfler fan and have all His CD's. This is one of the best of them.

B000N4SHOE|4.0|This is a fine film for all ages beautifully depicting The Lakes and Victorian London. Zelwigger seems perfectly Engish to me.

B000J103PC|5.0|Last night I sat down to watch THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA  with the wife.  I knew it was a chick flick going into it.  So I knew it would be tough to get through.   But give me a break!          About 30 minutes into the movie,  having all the fashion, make-up, clothing, and shoes I could handle,  I got up from the couch,  nodding approvingly and smiling.  It was one of those forced smiles, like when you're out for cocktails, and realize that the sushi you ate an hour ago was rotten and there's about 200 people between you and the nearest bathroom.    Fortunately, I was at home,  and the bathroom was right by the living room.  What! was I going to do to get out of watching this damn movie??      \\"Think!\\"   I said to myself.  So I grabbed the curling iron,  plugged it in,  put my head in the toilet,  and dropped the curling iron in it too.      \\"Ahh,  what sweet relief this would be!\\"  I thought.    Nothing.  It didn't do anything.   So I towel dried my hair and went back out to the couch.  I suffered through another 15 minutes,  but it seemed like years and years gone from my life.  I got up again and headed to the bathroom.  The electric shaver!  That should do it.   I plugged it in,  turned it on,  zzzzzzzzzzz,  plunged my head into the toilet,  and merrily dropped the shaver in after it.  ZZzzzzzzzzzzzz,  blurp, blurp...................... Again,  nothing.   What the f***?    I ran up the stairs,  grabbed the toaster,  went back down and into the bathroom.    \\"Are you all right?\\"  she asked.    \\"Fine\\"  I said.    Desperately, I plugged in the toaster,  pulled down the lever, waited til it got nice and red-hot,  dove head first into the toilet,  and  eagerly pulled the toaster into the oven.    ZZZzzzzzttttt.   Zap!    ZZzpppfff.       One little shock!?  That's it!?  I could get that by licking a god damn 9 volt!    DAMN THOSE G.F.I.  breakers on the bathroom outlets!   Damn you!
B00005JPAO|5.0|I really enjoyed this film and found it better than I expected. Everyone knows Mirren was superb, but Sheen had Blair's voice to perfection and I thought all the actors did well, particularly the unsung heroes, four corgis of Her Majesty. Other reviews set the scene of unresponsive, out of touch queen versus the people's new prime minister. But I did not find this to be an anti-monarchist film at all. Blair is an instant convert to royalism it seems and the film faithfully portrays why the Queen behaved as she did. One does what one perceives to be one's duty and does not wear one's heart on one's sleeve. I confess all my sympathies were with the Queen in her distance from the gushing emotion and pseudo-grief of Joe Public. I think the story about the stag was to show the Queen had more feeling for dumb animals than a dead princess, but then the stag had not given her any distress in the past. I think the message portrayed was that it was not merely that the Queen did not show the emotion of grief over Diana but that she was not really feeling her loss, apart from her concern for the two boys. Of course one knows that a lot of what was portrayed here is mere speculation but the one historic thing I question is the congregation in Westminster Abbey applauding Althrop's speech. Did they? If so I must at the time have been so disgusted by his speech that I missed the applause. Thankfully the parts of his speech in which he criticized the royal family were left out. Message of the film.? The monarchy must modernise. Personally I am happier with the monarchy than with pseudo-emotion from the great British public.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|This album is probally the Best metal cd i have heard in years.  FFDP has everything that is good in metal . . . heavy music , intense lyrics and a frontman that can blow you away.

B000VNMMQG|3.0|I had been looking forward to seeing this ever since the film came out but I regret to say I was disappointed. Ioan Gruffudd was better than I expected as Wilberforce. My beef is with Michael Apted the director for giving such a blatantly unhistorical drama. I do not have time to list the errors but the two most blatant ones are to do with John Newton. The present tune we sing to Amazing Grace was unknown in England at that time so Wilberforce would never have sung it. Newton was not a monk plagued by guilt for being a slave captain. He was a vicar who knew God's grace and forgiveness, hence the hymn. Right from the start when a screen caption told us the British Empire was built on the back of slaves one sensed that present day (erroneous) judgment may be evident. Wilberforce was not bothered by his addiction to opium. It was the one analgesic available and he controlled, not increased, his dosage throughout his life. I do though doubt that he would have been alone with an unmarried lady, unchaperoned through the night. The production is so inaccurate I thought that the director must be American, but no, to our shame he is British, portraying a royal duke in the House of Commons, Fox erroneously ennobled and still there to give the econium on Wilberforce in the hour of triumph though Fox died before 1807.<br /><br />It was not merely the historical inaccuracy that disappointed me. The flash backs were confusing and took away from the whirlwind nature of Wilberforce's courtship. I found the whole thing rather dull and not a patch on say, Chariots of Fire for an inspirational Christian theme. It was sympathetically done but could have been so much better. Perhaps viewer's who do not know the real story will be more impressed.
B000001EAQ|4.0|I would basically have to reiterate some of the other reviews posted here in saying that Pop has been needlessly maligned. Sure, it's over-processed, like pepperoni cheese, but like pepperoni cheese, it has its own unique flavor. I have to part company with some of the other reviewers in saying that this is nowhere near my favorite U2 album. If you're used to the more bare-bones U2 of the 1980s, you might find the veneer of slick production value on this product to be unpalatable, but give this a chance. The melodies go deeper than that, and the lyrics, while occasionally a little trite stylistically, are as cutting as those on any other U2 album. For those of us who prefer our music with little or no artificial additives, All That You Can't Leave Behind was certainly a refreshing departure from the technological apex that was reached with Pop, but Pop could hardly be said to have crossed the line into over-the-top fluff.    Don't gloss over Pop--it's hardly U2's best effort, but just as no big Pink Floyd fan can pass over The Piper at the Gates of Dawn for being a foreshadowing of greater genius to come, no big U2 fan should shrug off Pop for being coated in thick polish (apples to oranges, I know, but I hope I've made my point).
1594489505|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed The Kite Runner and the author's second novel does not disappoint. He is a fine writer whose plots are not predictable. Once again we have a novel set over the recent history of Afghanistan from the last days of monarchy through to the overthrow of the Taliban. This time the story is mainly through the eyes of two women.<br /><br />I recall an old Jewish prayer thanking God for not being born a Gentile, slave or a woman. Reading this, one will be thankful not to have been born an Afghan, Muslim or woman and certainly not all three. One is not spared the horror of life in Kabul as it is destroyed by the Mujahdeeen's civil war then gripped by the fanaticism of the Taliban. For women in general, life was better under the Russians. Nothing though ever prevented the mistreatment of the women in the story by hypocritical or brutal husbands and fathers. This is in many ways a horror story. There is some happiness at the end but along the way is unspeakable cruelty, especially to women, which makes for very unpleasant reading at times. But this is a skilled author. There are good caring men portrayed too and I think his portrayal if Islam and its effects is fair and non-judgmental. One of the good men portrayed is a Muslim cleric. Read it and you will be moved by the plight of women under Islam and of the country of Afghanistan with such violent recent history.
B000T05R90|4.0|I wouldn't call myself a Pink Floyd expert, and it was only recently that I began listening to this album. While I don't enjoy it as much as some of their later efforts, it's really begun to grow on me, and not only because the songs are great. While casually listening to this, it might appear as though the Pink Floyd sounds much like other bands of that type and era. In listening more closely, however, you can pick up the little ways in which they departed from the style of contemporary artists, and it's fun to listen to the dialects (for lack of a better word) of the musicians develop, to hear the blueprints for their unique sound being drawn.    (Unfortunately, I can't say anything good or bad about the anniversary edition, as my remarks are based solely on having listened to a previous release of the CD.)    I highly recommend The Piper at the Gates of Dawn for any Pink Floyd fan who would like to go beyond the requisite The Wall and Dark Side of the Moon.

0380820498|5.0|Robinson has done it again, delivering a chilling page-turner that I found impossible to put down. Mimicking his last outstanding novel, [[ASIN:0380733285 Past Reason Hated]], the author chose to include two cases, that seem separate, but whose relationship soon surfaces, as the backbone of this book. All the usual characters are present in this installment, and we get to see the return of Jenny Fuller, a character that I have liked all through the series, and who with her psychological insights make these novels much more enjoyable.<br /><br />When a seven-year-old girl is taken from her house by a couple posing as social workers and not returned when promised, the mother contacts the police. Inspector Banks and Superintendent Gristhorpe are thus immersed in a tough case, which proves not only complex and brutal, but also presents little promise for recovering the victim alive. When the body of a young ex-con surfaces a couple of days later, Banks suspects a connection, and decides to pursue this case, leaving the first one to Gristhorpe. The two teams are thrown in a race against time, to beat the odds and recover the victim before it is too late.<br /><br />I liked the idea Robinson had when he decided to have Gristhorpe handling one of the cases. Up until now, the involvement of this character has been fairly limited, and in my opinion, this change made the series better. The author also goes a little deeper into Banks' personal life, which I greatly appreciate, since when reading a series I always look forward to knowing more about the main characters and understanding what aspects of everyday life and their pasts affect their actions. The Inspector is going through the beginning of a mid-life crisis, with one son gone to college, and a teenage daughter that is growing fast, even if his father wants to ignore the fact. This also forces Banks and his wife Sandra to reinvent their relationship outside of their parenthood.<br /><br />As is usual the case with Robinson's books, we get a mystery that has an interesting and coherent plot, with mesmerizing characters, especially the mother of the girl and her partner, and with dialogues that are among the best I have come across in mystery novels. The only thing that was a little taxing was that the case involved a little girl. Since having my daughter, who is now two years old, I have noticed that I am affected more by books or movies that touch upon the topic of child abuse. In this case, it was tough at times, but I have to accept that the author handled the topic well and did not twist the knife in the wound. I can understand though that some people with less tolerance may have a hard time reading this novel. Apart from that caveat, I think this is one of the best mysteries I have read in a long time.ystery that has an interesting and coherent plot, with mesmerizing characters, especially the mother of the girl and her partner, and with dialogues that are among the best I have come across in mystery novels.

I absolutely love Liz Gilbert's writing!  She made everything seem so real!  YOU GO GIRL! ! !
B000UGG39Q|5.0|It's been awhile now and I wasn't quite sure as to what became of this metal supergroup {sort to speak} that features members of Pantera, C.O.C. and Crowbar. So good to see these guys back with their third effort. Extreme metal at it's finest. Tunes here that I was most blown away with were \\"Three Suns And One Star\\", the frantic \\"I Scream\\", \\"Never Try\\" and the near-brilliant \\"Nothing In Return\\". I've recently seen the band on tour in support of this blistering modern day metal classic. Go SEE them live is my advise to you. Line-up: Phil Anselmo-vocals, Pepper Keenan & Kirk Windstein- guitars, Rex Brown-bass and Jimmy Bower-drums. Recommended.

B000MG1ZGA|5.0|Between their debut album in 1967 and this, their final album, in 1971, the Los Angeles based Doors took a giant leap stylistically.  I think their first 3 albums can safely be described as psychedelic/acid rock - trendy, popular and very well produced.  In general, all 3 included an air of dark mystery and sometimes violence.  The 4th, \\"The Soft Parade\\", was an effort to change and move on, and it turned out to be a hodge-podge of different styles.  Experimental and eclectic, it's not so bad, right?  At least it shows the diversity these musicians were capable of.  Then, on \\"Morrison Hotel\\", they once again found a zone they were comfortable in:  bar rock and blues.  This is not one of my favorites, but it does contain \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" and \\"Waiting For The Sun\\", both of which I do like, a lot.  What I find missing from the album overall is that early air of mystery.  It's too much of a \\"fun\\" album for my taste.<br /><br />Miraculously, on \\"L.A. Woman\\" the dark elements and the bluesy rock are synthesized to form a final album anyone would be proud of (and it is beautifully remixed like the other 5).  On \\"The Changeling\\", Jim's gruff, boozy vocal is perfect for someone who is living on the edge.  Likewise, \\"Been Down So Long\\" and \\"Crawling King Snake\\" are nothin' but mean, evil blues at its best, featuring Robbie's awesome guitar work.  There's more blues in \\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\", but it is calmer, more traditional.  The title song is a rock classic among rock classics;  Jim goes through quite a workout and it sounds like he made a few pit stops along the way to complete the track.  \\"Love Her Madly\\", a big radio hit, \\"L'america\\" and \\"Hyacinth House\\" remind me of the early psychedelic Doors.  \\"Riders On The Storm\\" is very commercial and benign musically when compared to the other tracks, but lyrically, who except The Doors could have come up with the line \\"...If you give this man a ride, sweet memory will die...\\"?<br /><br />There are 2 bonus tracks.  \\"Orange County Suite\\" is slow and bluesy, not really remarkable but not bad, and \\"(You Need Meat) Don't Go No Further\\" is standard old school blues-rock with appropriately suggestive lyrics.<br /><br />With only 6 studio albums, The Doors managed to establish quite a legacy.  I regard them as the premier American rock band (The Byrds are a close second), on a level with The Beatles and The Stones, although certainly less prolific due to circumstances.nty Suite\\" is slow and bluesy, not really remarkable but not bad, and \\"(You Need Meat) Don't Go No Further\\" is standard old school blues-rock with appropriately suggestive lyrics.<br /><br />With only 6 studio albums, The Doors managed to establish quite a legacy.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|If you watch this expecting a \\"Christian movie\\", you'll probably be disappointed. If you watch this expecting a movie about a Christian and how his faith informs and directs his life and his work, you'll probably be greatly encouraged.    Amazing Grace tells the story of William Wilberforce, a member of the British parliament in the late 18th and early 19th century, who worked to abolish Britain's involvement in the slave trade. Wilberforce's co-MPs posed quite the opposition, both because of prejudices and economic factors (the livelihood of many who voted them into office depended on the slave trade).    Although strongly interested in abolition early in his career, he began to wonder if a newly redisovered faith demanded that he abandon politics and dedicate himself full-time to \\"the Lord's work\\". He consulted with many -- even John Newton, a former slave ship captain and writer of the eponymous hymn -- all of whom recommended that he remain in politics.    While still wrestling with the decision, Wilberforce encountered Thomas Clarkson and several other abolitionists who convinced him that he could marry the two concepts -- by pushing hard for abolition in the political arena in which he found himself, he would be doing \\"the Lord's work\\".    And therein lies the crux of the story for the Christian who is watching this film. While God certainly calls some to abandon a \\"secular\\" career for a \\"sacred\\" one, there is work to be done in the secular world in which we live. And Wilberforce did not stop wrestling with which way to go until God gave him a clear sign through Clarkson and company.    How the story ended is obvious -- when's the last time you saw a British slave ship? But how it gets there, and the lives of those involved, is what is so compelling. I'm not really one for historical movies about 18th century Brits -- my dad rolls his eyes at my mom's enjoyment of what he calls \\"stiff neck-ed\\" movies -- but I was pulled in quite quickly. People from a distantland and even more distant time come alive as regular people.    William Wilberforce was a man extraordinarily used by God in a \\"secular\\" profession. This is the message of Amazing Grace -- the movie, the song, and grace itself.
B000002L9B|4.0|Usually when an album does not follow the success of a landmark album, the expectations for the second follow-up are not high.  Not was the case when Prince would prepare to release his 1986\\"Parade\\" album.   Prince was less than one year from his \\"Around the World in a Day\\" album which was the follow-up to his landmark album \\"Purple Rain\\".   \\"Around the World in a Day\\" would go in a completely different direction from \\"Purple Rain\\" - abandoning the Rock-infused style of \\"Purple Rain\\" in favor of a psychedelic sound on \\"Around the World in a Day\\".   This sound might have disappointed some of the expanded fan base that Prince acquired during the success of \\"Purple Rain\\", but it would add a whole new element to both Prince's music and the \\"Minneapolis Sound\\".  However with the case of \\"Parade\\", things were different because \\"Parade\\" was going to represent the soundtrack for Prince's follow-up film to \\"Purple Rain\\" - \\"Under the Cherry Moon\\".   Many fans of that film were also hoping for a film with the energy and intensity of \\"Purple Rain\\".  Unfortunately even many loyal Prince fans would be disappointed with the follow-up film.   However, while musically Prince did not re-create \\"Purple Rain\\", he would once again continue to refine the \\"Minneapolis Sound\\" and keep his legacy moving forward.     The \\"Minneapolis Sound\\"  contained a mixture of Funk, Pop, R&B, and Rock.  Prince was largely responsible for being a contributing architect to this sound movement.  As mentioned for 1985's \\"Around the World in a Day\\", Prince would add a psychedelic element to the \\"Minneapolis Sound\\".   On \\"Parade\\", Prince would continue to explore the psychedelic element as well as focus around a Funk element.   The one new element he would add is a \\"European influence\\" - this would be because \\"Parade\\" served as a soundtrack for \\"Under the Cherry Moon\\" which would take place in France.    Here is a song by song synopsis of the nine tracks of \\"Around the World in a Day\\".  Most of the songs seemto follow a loose segue from one to another, but the first four songs are near continuous and tightly coupled.    \\"Christopher Tracy's Parade\\": This song is best described as psychedelic music meeting marching band.  I loved this track and was surprised that this didn't get any radio airplay.  This song is named after the lead character in \\"Under the Cherry Moon\\"  John L. Nelson - Prince's father is a co-songwriter on this track and once again proves he is a worthy songwriter.    \\"New Position\\":  This song proves this isn't \\"Purple Rain\\".  This song takes a little while to get used to.  I would describe this song as Funk with some Caribbean percussion.    \\"I Wonder U\\": This song begins with a quasi \\"live setting\\".  The beginning also almost sounds like 2000's hip-hop, but quickly this song takes on the psychedelic feel of \\"Around the World in a Day\\".  Not my favorite track, but the song does have an interesting sound.    \\"Under the Cherry Moon\\": This is another song co-written by John L. Nelson.  This is the title of the movie from which the music from this film comes from.  This is the first song with a strong \\"European Sound\\" (this almost has an Eastern European sound).  This is a slow track and like \\"New Position\\", this song is going to take a few listens to get used to.    \\"Girls and Boys\\": This is classic \\"Minneapolis Sound\\" funk.  Prince effectively uses Sheila E, Wendy Melvoin, Susannah Melvoin, and Lisa Coleman to provide female vocals.  When Prince collaborates with other vocalists, it usually works very well.  This song is no exception.    \\"Life Can Be So Nice\\":   A terrific mix of psychedelic sound and Funk.  This song \\"flew under the radar\\" in terms of recognition.   I particularly like the use of the percussion on this track.   This song also has a perfect segue as it flows from \\"Girls and Boys\\".    \\"Venus de Milo\\":  The opening piano sequence reminds me of Tears For Fears' \\"I Believe\\", but this quickly flows into a very classical sounding instrumentalthat is dominated by piano.  This song is pure instrumental and once again shows the European influence that is present on this album.    \\"Mountains\\": This song flows very nicely from the classical \\"Venus de Milo\\" and back into a good mix of psychedelic music and Funk.   While this song garnered radio airplay, I'm surprised it didn't climb to number one.  The harmonies of this song are simply outstanding.   I also like the horn work on this song.    \\"Do U Lie\\": This is perhaps the most European sounding song of the whole collection - and in particular the most French sounding song.  This song also takes a few listens to grow on you.    \\"Kiss\\": This would become a number one song.  This song is near a cappella and has become a fan favorite.  However, I just don't like it.  I feel Prince has many songs which are better than this one.    \\"Anotherloverholenyohead\\": This song has a perfect hand-off and transition from \\"Kiss\\".  It almost starts out like Jody Watley's \\"Looking for a New Lover\\".  It quickly becomes classic Funk-infused \\"Minneapolis Sound\\".  This was a single and I'm surprised it didn't have greater success.    \\"Sometimes It Snows in April\\":  This is a very soft and sad song.   It is not one to listen to while you are depressed.   It contrasts the positive sounds heard on the opening \\"Christopher Tracy's Parade\\".   I think this song wraps up the CD perfectly.    There are no lyrics in my liner notes on this collection.  This would turn out to be the last album Prince would do with his band - the Revolution. Overall, while Prince doesn't try to recreate \\"Purple Rain\\", he does succeed in continuing to refine and solidify the \\"Minneapolis Sound\\".  While still not as strong an album as \\"Purple Rain\\", I do think this is stronger than \\"Around the World in a Day\\".  Definitely worth checking out.
B000VDDDY6|4.0|For all the 40 year old losers who complain about the new FX, get with the 21st Century.  This is a next generation format for the next generation editions of this series.  I personally think the episodes look amazing with the HD transfer, and new CG FX.  It makes the classic series blend better with the 90s TV series, as well as the new Star Trek movie coming out in 2008.  Move out of your parents' basement and accept that time moves on people.    Let me say I was not intending to offend Trekkies, as I've been an avid fan for decades.  The Trekkie stereotype is so well known I thought people would get the joke.  And yes the original versions have been released countless times, so obviously if Paramount paid for the high def remastering, there are going to release the new HD versions.  Maybe eventually they will release the old school versions, for completists and to take more of our money, but I like the new changes.

Of course I'm a Bach uber-fan but even if you just love classical guitar music you should buy this fast.  Bach is actually baroque in his era but we tend to think in terms of \\"classical\\" music.  You'll hear familiar melodies sprinkled throughout the lute suites and realize the origin of all those snippets of beauty that still find their way into our popular culture.  Don't cheat yourself out the mother's milk of true masterpiece musicality and glory.  And I'm not exaggerating one little bit in my praise.  I actually love every single note in the lute suites.

0679735909|5.0|POSSESSION: A ROMANCE has been on my shelf since 1991. I read it because it won the 1990 Booker Prize, and once under its spell, I've never wanted to let it go. A.S. Byatt -- sister of award winning novelist Margaret Drabble -- tells a complex story within a story, moving back and forth between modern-day scholars Roland Michell and Maud Bailey, and the fictional Victorian poets who are the subjects of their research.<br /><br />Victorian literature can seem like a dry and rocky road, but Byatt foreshadows and advances her story with the poetry, letters and journals of the Victorian pair, whose love affair is revealed as the research progresses. From simple lyric poems (\\"They say that women change: 'tis so: but you / Are ever-constant in your changefulness ...\\") to complex narrative poems and stories, they are well integrated with the story, though sometimes lengthy. The Victorian scene comes to life most successfully, and it's astonishing how fluently Byatt moves not just from present to past, but among the many different literary forms of the two Victorians.<br /><br />The story within a story, or more specifically the unraveling of a mystery from the past, is a popular device. It's been used in Josephine Tey's DAUGHTER OF TIME, THE MOONSTONE by Wilkie Collins, THE NAME OF THE ROSE by Umberto Eco; and more recently, THE DANTE CLUB and THE POE SHADOW by Matthew Pearl, THE RULE OF FOUR by Caldwell and Thomason, even Dan Brown's blockbuster THE DA VINCI CODE. Byatt weaves her two stories together beautifully: POSSESSION may be the standard by which to judge this type of book, as both stories are richly developed and rooted in the idiom of their time. The Victorian imagery reveals the love affair between the poets, and eventually between Roland and Maud, with its typical mix of emotion and restraint. The modern story satirizes the British academic scene.<br /><br />POSSESSION: A ROMANCE may not be the easiest book I ever read, but it's among the most rewarding. If you haven't read it in the many years since it was first published, then I recommend it to you.e many years since it was first published, then I recommend it to you.

0316067598|5.0|Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of Seal Team 10 is the most incredible book I have ever read.  This is an incredibly harrowing account of four highly trained Seals going up against over two hundred fanatics.  In the end, one Seal was left alive while the Taliban group may have lost half or more of their number.  Tommorrow, October 22, 2007 Lt. Michael Murphy will be presented posthumously with the Congressional Medal of Honor for his truly heroic acts during the battle of what Lutrell calls, the Battle for Murphy's Ridge while fighting off the Taliban in the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan.  The team was trapped, wounded and the radio was kaput.  After being shot in the stomach Lieutenant Murphy left his cover and walked out into the open to use his cell phone to call for help.  It was there that he was mortally wounded with a shot in the back, but returned to his comrades and resumed fighting when he eventually succumbed to his injuries.  This is a true hero who deserves to be recognized for his bravery.  Many first hand accounts leave the reader with a feeling that the writer is inflating his own actions, but not in Survivor.  Latrell's intentions are obvious, he wants the world to know of the heroic actions of the four man Seal team.  Throughout the book, this tall Texan (6', 5\\") purposefully minimizes his own efforts in the battle while praising the actions of his friends.  The book starts out by Latrell describing how he always wanted to be a Seal.  Finally he joins up with a full third of the book dedicated to the incredibly rigorous training to become a Seal, the most highly trained combat specialist in the world.  Of the 180 men who started out, only 32 were able to finish.  Then the rest of the book describes the lead up to Operation Redwing and afterwards.    The four man crew was tasked to take out a Taliban leader but was discovered by some goat herders.  The team followed the Rules of Engagement and letthe men go free who promptly informed the Taliban where the team was located.  What followed could only be described as Custer's last stand.  Over two hundred hate filled men carrying AK-47s attacked the Seal team over and over again.  The Taliban fighters ran towards the team firing wildly only to be mowed down by four men who made their shots count.  But the team was out numbered 35:1.  Eventually, the team had to retreat, and then retreat again.  Slowly but surely the firing of the Taliban's Ak-47s, RPGs, and grenades began to take their toll on the four man team.  One by one they all were felled until only Latrell was left.  Severely wounded and sought by the Taliban fighters, the one remaining survivor crawled seven miles (Holy Cow!), seven miles before being taken in by some Afghan tribesmen who protected him from the Taliban at great risk to themselves.  This is also the story of the power of prayer.  Time after time, Marcus Latrell found himself falling down a cliff or blown back by RPGs, he lost his med kit, his canteen, and even his rifle, but every time Marcus would find his trusted weapon right beside him.  His family prayed for him continuously and miracles happen.  Marcus Latrell along with two of his comrades were awarded with the Navy Cross for their heroism.  And Marcus's best friend, Lt. Michael Murphy will be awarded with the CMH.  This book is riveting from the beginning to the end.  And as I said, it is the best book I have ever read.
B000UGG39Q|5.0|I was apprehensive about what this album might bring,but after listening to it for the first time under the influence of thc and candlelight,I can honestly say that this is the most thoughtfully put-together and technically-advanced Down material so far.It's the spawn of the heaviness of the first album and the mellow experimentaions of the second,but a third  head has been reared as well.I wouldn't dare to call this album \\"commercially acceptable\\",but I think that years down the road this album will be veiwed as one of the turning points of metal because of the vocal and instrumental risks taken in it:not everybody,fan or commercial-rock radio-lover,will \\"get\\" what this album is;I sure as hell don't have a full scope of what it is yet.This is an album that DEMANDS that you read the lyrics,surrender yourself to a mood,and allow yourself to be swayed by sound.As of now,I'm tempted to liken \\"over the under\\" to a country-tinged merging of Pink Floyd-styled rock and an airy type of 70's/90's metal.<br /><br />I like that the with third Down album the members have chosen to take their own path;I hope that that path will start a movement towards heavy music becoming more intelligent and less superficial in content and meaning.
0061142026|5.0|When you grow up, you tend to find that the fairy tales that you enjoyed as a child are, well, strictly kids' fare.  For the adult reader, the shallow characters, simple narrative and implausible plot twists are a little much, yet even for the grown up, there is an affection for the fairy tale genre.  A few writers have been able to tap into this fondness with good adult fairy tales, with probably the most well-known case being William Goldman's Princess Bride.  As good as that book is, however, Neil Gaiman's Stardust is even better.<br /><br />Stardust starts off in the town of Wall during the time of Victorian England.  The town has, on one side, an ancient wall which in one place has a hole that people can cross through, though this is rarely allowed except for one day every nine years when the mortals of Wall can meet with the Faerie on the other side at a special bazaar.  Dunstan Thorn of Wall has a brief but meaningful encounter with a beautiful slave girl from the other side and a year later, the infant Tristan appears at Dunstan's doorstep.<br /><br />Seventeen years later, Tristan is a young man in love with the beautiful but shallow Victoria.  To put to rest his efforts to woo her, she tells him that she will only marry him if he brings to her a star that has fallen in Faerie.  Rashly, he decides to do just that, but in that magical land, the star has taken the form of a beautiful girl who fell out of the sky after being struck by a topaz gem.<br /><br />Tristan is not the only one interested in the star girl.  There is also a trio of witches who want to consume her heart to restore their youth and power.  There are also the sons of the Lord of the Stormhold who seek the topaz as it represents the power of their domain. Both of these groups will threaten the progress of Tristan and the girl as they make their way back to Wall, but there are also powerful magic elements that are willing to assist them, and Tristan's half-faerie nature will also help.<br /><br />In my opinion, Stardust does nothing but cement Neil Gaiman's reputation as the best adult fantasy writer around today.  He writes well, he avoids the cliches of the genre, and he is that exceptional fantasy author who writes single volume stories.  If Stardust has any flaw, it is that it is a mere 248 pages (in my edition); when a book is as much fun as this one, it ends much too quickly.s nothing but cement Neil Gaiman's reputation as the best adult fantasy writer around today.

Even when you feel like you've caught on to the author's writing style, he changes it up and surprises you again. I am currently just over halfway through the book and I honestly have no-idea what is going to happen on the next page.    If you loved Pillar's then you will love this book just as much. I also highly recommend A Dangerous Fortune and Eye Of The Needle.

B00000G3Q4|5.0|I really really love this movie, and specially this Elite Entertainment DVD is awesome because it is presented in 1.33:1 full screen which was the original aspect ratio of this movie at the time of releasing and the aspect ratio in which the movie was shot (16mm film). although I had the Anchorbay's wide screen DVD already but when I bought the Elite Entertainment's this DVD, and saw movie in full frame, I really start loving it more than before. also the picture quality and color information within this Elite version is better than Anchorbay's new release.<br /><br />So now this thing is clear in my mind that not the all new thing are better than its old versions.
B000002KYR|4.0|Yep, it's hard to imagine that ZZ Top with their gimmick beards and simple fat fingered blues constructs were one of the biggest bands on the planet circa 1983. Eliminator with it's MTV friendly videos as a massive hit and what is interesting is that the Top really did it the old fashioned way, beavering away on album after album and grafting away, honing their sonics and gradually moulding them into the sort of chunky hard rock that spoke to people in simple grooves, shifting millions in the process.<br /><br />And groove laden this is, gradual slow burn songs attacking with a simplicity reminiscent of AC/DC, even the more anonymous tracks on this album containing a certain charm in their simple yet effective rifferama and both bands are obviously in love with the idea of brazen everything louder than everything else rock `n' roll, as opposed to outright metal. And that is perhaps the key to the longevity of both bands. Take for example the relentless blues based structures on this album, such musical workouts probably just ooze out of Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hill and you just know these guys listen to some awesome blues guitarists whose names have been forgotten by the mainstream music world - in fact Billy Gibbons gives full credit to his musical inspirations in his book.<br /><br />Personal favourites of this bluesy hard rock mega hit would have to be Got Me Under Pressure with its' clipped and lively delivery, Sharp Dressed Man for it's non-sensically catchy rhythms and the lead cut Gimme All Your Lovin which is a guilty pleasure but a pleasure all the same. Ditto for Legs.<br /><br />The rest of the albums cruises down the highway in a relentless barrage of heavy boogie rock and in so many ways this album is one of those perfect road trip albums as the bouncy delivery and production qualities means that this is a reliable choice for drivin' tunes just about no matter what company your in. Heck, my father thinks the musical world begins and ends with country and western (we have both kinds....) Yet he's never batted an eyelid when I've slipped this into the stereo as background to music to a burn down the highways and byways of Australias East coast.<br /><br />A highly recommended good time album that doesn't set out to change the world nor argue any particular viewpoint. An album that plugs in and rocks out without any fuss.kinds....)

Being born in the 70's and having a hard rocking pedigree that so many of the other bands that were around them didn't during the mid 80's means that it's unfair to find ZZ Top guilty by association.<br /><br />Yet their big bucks heyday did go a long way to forever imbedding their status as a novelty hard rock act totally obsessed with well endowed women wearing not much of anything on MTV and this best of is certainly guilty of pandering to their late 80's/early 90's phase. A quick look at the track listing proves that this is a veritable casual fans delight. Really, the casual hard rock fan or the casual Top fan can't really go wrong here in terms of picking up a slice of southern tinged hard rock Americana. The big radio hits: Gimme All Your Lovin, Sharp Dressed Man, Got Me Under Pressure and Legs are all here. Even lesser hits like Doubleback come alive when surrounded by the bearded ones choicest cuts. While some of the double entendre is a bit forced (Pearl Necklace) it's really not much worse than that of bands like AC/DC or early Skid Row (I'm thinking Big Guns here).<br /><br />A highway album for sure, this is an album that you can just put in and press play and let the deeply blues steeped toe tapping hard rock thump out of your speakers and wash over you. It should also be noted that some of the tunes here were remastered which is perhaps fair enough given tunes like La Grange reach all the way back to 1973 though the simpler production values of the 70's are actually perfectly suited to ZZ Tops working mans boogie rock. The liner notes sadly don't really add much apart from some trivia knowledge and the fairly tacky cover and booklet art is pretty cringeworthy.<br /><br />Those little quibbles aside this is probably a pretty darn useful album for anyone who has lived under a rock since these guys started out. The fact that the source album for each track is duly noted is a bonus, allowing the listener wanting to explore their reasonably extensive back catalogue a clue as to where to start based on what tunes they like most.<br /><br />A good career retrospective, whether the purists agree or not, and well worth your dollar.since these guys started out.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|Supernatural has to be one of the best TV shows that has been aired these past 18 months.  Amongst all the \\"reality\\" clap trap tv SUPERNATURAL is a show worth watching.  Good scripts, brilliant direction and superb acting from the two main stars - especially Jensen Ackles who plays Dean Winchester - although being fair to Jared Padalecki who plays his brother Sam, with the first season introducing us to the characters and Sam being less than enthusiastic about returning to \\"hunting\\" the Sam character did lack a little in strength but by mid season 2 Sam had developed a lot - but not so much as Dean, I have to say.  The scary bits didn't really scare me - but then I've been brought up on Hammer House of Horror, Vincent Price, Chris Lee and  others and this was only TV so it can't really get too gruesome or scary. However,the story lines are excellent for TV drama and there is a lot of darkness and a lot of humour in the episodes which help to make it compulsive viewing.  This series could be a world winner but for some reason WB or the CW network just haven't put their marketing department behind this show = which just astounds me. Very little magazine coverage, hardly anything in the TV listings promoting the show which is probably the main reason why this programme is not on mainstream TV where it belongs.  BUY THIS SET THOUGH if you like good TV that doesn't \\"dumn down\\".    Season three has just started in the States and the three episodes I have seen promise a good third season. ITV2 have brought the rights to two more seasons and I hope they schedule them for a prime slot. I personally hope this show will run and run.  Good TV is so rare now a-days. SUPERNATURAL IS BRILLIANT TV TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO TELL THEIR FRIENDS!  MY ONLY COMPLAINT:  I have two copies of the US version - both purchased from Amazon.com and neither of them have the \\"special features\\" as advertised on the box set.  No gag reel, no \\"Jared's screen test for the role of Sam\\" no Webisode gallery and no Interactive Devils road map.  The English box set DOES have the gag reel but, again, no Jared's screen test and no Webisode gallery and no interactive Devils road map. But, after all, it's the episodes I want and that's what I've got.
B000005RTD|4.0|One of the greatest documents of the NWOBHM, Saxons Wheels of Steel stands head and shoulders above so many of it's peers that it's almost cruel to name names. The simple fact is that apart from the NWOBHM heroes we all know such as Def Leppard only a few of them were actually any good, regardless of how important the movement was in the history of hard rock/heavy metal.<br /><br />And the fact is that on the strength of this album Saxon were one of the few. This molten slab of pub infused metal is unkempt and raucous in it's delivery, oozing passionate zeal with a band experienced enough to know what they were doing while still being young enough to have that irreplaceable, one off youthful bravado at the opening possibilities. Wheels of Steel is a collection of heads down numbers. The production is simple and traditional as one would expect of the albums vintage. The cover art is minimalist (on my pressing anyway) and the entire package is understated. Except for the music.<br /><br />Some of Saxons best songs are on this album, Motorcycle Man, 747 (Strangers in the Night) and the title track itself. All are great metal songs that race along with purity of mission. And the reason this album hangs together so well is that even though the other songs all meld together. Every song sounds like it belongs here despite the fact that not all are up to the same standard. An almost AC/DC like consistency is at play here as everything gels.<br /><br />I truly feel that on this album Saxon hit a groove that they rarely achieved again. It is the place to start for my mind, as opposed to the compilation album entitled Collection of Metal which for me was too middling and spent too much time on their weaker late 80's material. In fact my gut instinct is that this single album is better than that supposed best of. Buy this instead to find out what the fuss was about in regards to Saxon. They were/are a second or even third tier band overall, but here they really do fire up.

B000002NFM|4.0|Bursting onto the scene in 97 with this breakout album Prodigy in many ways took the baton of industrial metal from Trent Reznors NIN and ran with it. It really is inconceivable that without NIN paving the way for them Prodigy could of had anywhere near the impact they had on the mainstream. This album is killer stuff, taking a range of traditional hard rock/metal shadings and giving them a new set of clothes and really adding a serious dose of accessibility to the industrial metal pantheon.<br /><br />Starting up with Smack My Bitch Up the band show themselves to be no record company darlings. I mean it's not the most subtle way of starting up an album is it? The album moves along from there to Breathe, one of the hits off this release and belting the listener up front with two of the best songs on the album is a clever bit of conventional track listing. And in many ways, music aside, this is a very traditional metal album. The whole shock rocker look of the band and the `hey look, I'm a borderline nutcase' shenanigans of the frontman fitted perfectly the mood of the mid to late 90's and the bands videos had just enough of a touch of the gothic to rope in some goth metallers for a bit of a boost to album sales.<br /><br />Further down the playlist of the album we get a series of songs that by themselves aren't world beaters but they are solid and they hang together very well and bludgeon the listener. Except of course for Firestarter, a slow burn industrial nugget that uses it's hypnotic repetition to good effect and it's this catchiness that probably inspired the band to put this out as the lead single, paving the way for the albums climb up the charts in a number of territories.<br /><br />Personally I would perhaps have finished the album with Firestarter as by the time Climbatise and Fuel My Fire set out their respective stalls the listener has pretty much heard it all. Not that they are bad tunes, but they aren't up to the same levels of frayed sanity as Firestarter.<br /><br />Prodigy never managed to better this album and it still stands as one of the most commercially successful industrial metal crossovers ever and for good reason. The guitar textures and the relentless backing beats create a textured wall of sound that sucks the listener in. The shock rocker act seems fresh and about as real as it ever is and this is, without a doubt, pretty much the most humanly connective industrial metal album around, the band sending forth concise blasts rather than the more downbeat musical labyrinths of NIN.ever managed to better this album and it still stands as one of the most commercially successful industrial metal crossovers ever and for good reason.

B000TGCR3S|4.0|I'm usually a person that has to see an anime, in any of its forms, before I buy it. I bought Tekkon Knkreet blind, and I am happy with my decision. Going into it, I knew it would be visually amazing from the trailers I saw when it was released in Japan. What I wasnt prepared for was a deep, emotional story that really pulled me in. The story deals with friendship, brotherhood, loss, the inexplicable, insanity, differing visions, and overall fighting for what you love and believe in. Even if you aren't a big fan of Japanese animation, but can take animation, and have an imagination, I definitely recommend checking out this title.
B0002EXH4A|3.0|Following the trend of so many bands to try and get a third royalty cheque for the same album (by that I mean the original sale, the CD release years later and then a third bite of the cherry by later on putting out a remastered version with bonus tracks) Megadeth have gone down the reissue path with just about their entire back catalogue scoring a remaster by their main man Mustaine who, after years floating around studios and armed with fairly unshakeable self belief has actually managed to enliven the original mid 80's knob job quite well. The guitars leap out of you in a way that they didn't quite manage to previously, the whole things seems very fresh and it does allow an interesting insight into how he would like these albums to sound. Hardcore original fans may not feel that this is worth another dollop of their hard earned but for those who may have only discovered this band via the various compilations put out in the 00's then these remixed and remastered versions are certainly the way to go.<br /><br />As to the actual music of this album itself it must be said that it really contains a few early era `Deth classics in the form of Mary Jane, In My Darkest Hour and the number most evocative of the bands mascot Vic Rattlehead - namely Hook in Mouth. The album both musically and lyrically is quite similar to the bands debut Killing is my Business and the Peace Sells album, the three albums in many ways forming a tryptich of old skool thrash any modern fan of the genre really should own along with Bonded By Blood by Exodus and the first couple of Metallica albums. The album fairly races along to its conclusion (original release had eight tracks) and the band sound quite tight. How I've no idea given their chemical commando shenanigans but they do. In fact the variety of the album means this is perhaps the most connective early `Deth album. Given the varied pacing of the albums and the way it seems to breath more, to be less dense than either Killing or Peace Sells the whole package IMHO outshines both the aforementioned releases.<br /><br />For example the use of an instrumental to open proceedings shows a band willing to play with the traditional album format. The storming Set the World Afire gets the listeners had banging and then the cover of the old Sex Pistols classic Anarchy in the UK followed by the more slowburn Mary Jane is really an inspired tracklisting. 502 is a more traditional fast paced thrasher that touches on so many teen angst themes such as blazing down the highway, a bit of juvenile hopelessness thrown into the mix and some nuances of anti-authoritarian sentiment all combine to make the track a fine piece of metal. Not to mention that the album closes out with In My Darkest Hour, an ode to Cliff, followed by the thrash metal of Liar and finally Hook In Mouth to round out the `regular' tracks. And that's pretty much the album. Fine metallic slices that form a very coherent yet somewhat varied disc.<br /><br />As for the bonus tracks they are all different versions of tracks already on the original release and consequently are of limited value except to completists. In fact they aren't extended or instrumental version or anything, but just different mixes by one Paul Lani.<br /><br />Which explains my viewpoint that if you already have this album on disc it is not worth forking out yet again for the same tunes just to get these bonus tracks. If on the other hand your a newcomer to the band or don't have this album at all, you might as well get more bang for your buck eh?<br /><br />Anyway, that's my two cents worth, hopefully it's given you an idea of what your getting here.whole package IMHO outshines both the aforementioned releases.

B000OONQ9O|4.0|I had been hearing about The Warriors for years, but never had the opportunity to watch it. Once it hit Blu-ray, I finally put it in my rental queue to see what all the fuss was about. After my initial viewing, I just had to order a copy of my own immediately. I definitely know why this film is regarded as the cult classic as it is. Great characters and a simple, yet engaging story. A gang, wrongly accused of a crime, must fight ther way back home. No fancy effects, no silly one-liners. Just a group of guys going through a brutal fight to get to where they need to be. And visually? I dont know what the original DVD looked like, as Blu-ray is my only reference. But honestly, if you hadn't told me it was an older film, I would have guessed it was filmed this year, along with a really good costume design team. Another fine example of what a great new way to enjoy movies the Blu-ray format provides.
B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|I thought that this was one of the most irritating movies I had ever seen. You see it uses this gimmick in which the Cage character can see into the future and live out various possible outcomes to the same situation. I guess it's meant to be clever, and it could have been if it wasn't used to death throughout the movie; after a while everything just becomes predictable, for the auidence as well as Cage.    I wanted to like the movie - I like all the actors - but the characters were flat, especially Julianne Moore's character. There were some decent moments, but they were killed by the storyline, which by the end just makes you feel cheated.
B000067FP8|4.0|GREMLINS 2 is a solid sequel that has its reptilian tongue planted firmly in its scaly cheek.  The setting has moved from a small town, Kingston Falls, to the  ultimate high tech fantasy building in Manhattan.  There the young lovers from the original Gremlins, Billy (Zach Gilligan) and Kate (Phoebe Cates), find employment as well as their old pal Gizmo the Mogwai being tortured in a science lab.  As we learned in the first film when Gizmo gets wet he multiplies and his \\"offspring\\" are mischievious to say the least.  This new batch is soon fortified with special potions from the lab giving them diverse powers including flight, web spinning, great intelligence and apparently the ability to produce musical spectaculars.  Pop culture references abound, some of which are all ready a bit dated. Some of the sight gags that may have worked well in the theater do not really translate to the small screen.  Despite these minor flaws this is an entertaining film which is suitable for tweens and their families.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This was recommended to me by an extremely competent European commercial intelligence manager, and while I tend to shy away from sub-titled films unless they are in French, I found this one, in German with dubbed sub-titles a bit oversize and therefore *very* easy to read, to be RIVETING.<br /><br />As a former spy intimately familiar with the stench of stake-out locations and cars, the mindless patience of hours on end with nothing happening, the tedium of typing every word when only one word in ten thousand might be worth all the trouble, I found this film to be a five star film in several categories: ethics, humanity, character, tradecraft, pathology of power, gentle love, artistic integrity.<br /><br />I do NOT agree with the churlish editorial comments in the Amazon-provided description of the movie, about two many epiloges.  This movie<br />ends BRILLIANTLY, I cannot imagine a more perfect conclusion with closure for all.<br /><br />There are other excellent reviews with more detail that I shall not replicate.

B000R7HY0K|1.0|I saw \\"Grindhouse\\" in the theater.  The reason so many people are complaining that the trailers for fake genre movies are missing from the DVDs is because they were the best part of the theatrical release.  They rocked!  Hilarious, with several \\"did I just see what I think I saw\\" moments.  The second best part was \\"Planet Terror\\".  You have to have a high tolerance for gore to \\"enjoy\\" it but it is fast moving and overstuffed with ideas drawn from the grindhouse/horror genre.  By far, the weakest, dullest part of \\"Grindhouse\\" was \\"Death Proof\\".  It is a Tarantino trade-mark to have characters engage in pop culture discussions, but in his good films that dialog is woven into the ACTION!  In \\"DP\\" it's 20 minutes talking- 2 minutes action- 40 minutes talking- 15 minutes action.  Even in the theatrical cut \\"DP\\" dragged.  They sure as hell didn't need to make it longer. There weren't enough ideas to sustain a 70 minute film, much less an extended version.  Also, the car stunts are not impressive.  The girl on the hood was tense but other than that it's pretty much \\"Dukes Of Hazard\\"(TV series) quality.  I liked Kurt Russell's performance and some of the girls were cute.  But they would have been a whole lot more attractive if they would have shut up and DONE something interesting.  As someone wisely observed, \\"Sometimes Tarantino just can't stop typing.\\"

B000A42QIU|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys gave us another awesome CD with this release of Very. The orange textured packaging is great artwork in and of itself; and the quality of the sound is excellent.<br /><br />The track set begins with \\"Can You Forgive Her?\\" This opens with a solid musical intro involving strings, percussion, drums and more. The Pet Shop Boys perform this to perfection. They sing of how a man loves a woman even though he knows it's not going to be the perfect relationship. Great! \\"Liberation\\" boasts another great musical intro; and this song has a great chorus verse as well. Moreover, \\"Dreaming Of The Queen\\" features The Pet Shop Boys singing flawlessly about love, heartache when a love goes awry and comparing a lover to \\"Lady Di.\\"<br /><br />\\"To Speak Is A Sin\\" begins with a good musical intro using strings, drums and percussion. \\"To Speak Is A Sin\\" explores relationships people share even though their relationship would be scorned by society. \\"To Speak Is A Sin\\" refers to a man who wants romantic time alone with another man. Great musical interlude!<br /><br />\\"One In A Million\\" has a dance music/disco flavor to it which work wells for this number; and the music compliments the vocals very well. \\"One In A Million\\" refers to how a man wants his lover to stay even though his lover wants to end their relationship. Listen for some great sound effects on \\"One In A Million!\\" Last but certainly not least, The Pet Shop Boys perform a rousing rendition of \\"Go West\\" which was originally performed by The Village People. \\"Go West\\" will make you want to jump up and dance wherever you are--it's THAT good. \\"Go West\\" with its choir provides a strong ending for this excellent album.<br /><br />The liner notes have terrific artwork; and we get credits, too.<br /><br />The Pet Shop Boys struck gold with this album entitled Very. I can only hope that people rediscover this great album so that it comes back into print. Thank you, Pet Shop Boys!

0316286850|4.0|I purchased this book aswell as Kevyn Aucoin's other book Face Forward with the intention of learning how to do make-up properly for my high school formal.  I'd been to a professional make-up trial and I wasn't at all happy with the way it had looked so I thought it might be fun to have a try myself.    I found making faces to be the most helpful of the two books as it demonstrates more of the basic techniques ie, shading, eyebrow shaping, contrasting etc. Face Forward was also very helpful in giving some more creative looks though the examples in making faces were a lot more wearable.    I was very happy with both of the books, the instructions are clear and easy to follow, the glossy pictures are of a high quality and the structure of the book is easy to read.  It's also fantastic to see the Aucoin doesn't push any of his or other companies products.  His unique phylosophies on life and beauty and are a welcome change to the boring and stereotypical.  When I ordered the books I was worried they might be a bit outdated but that wasn't the case at all, they were both completely up to the minute.

1400063515|4.0|The following is an excerpt from John Stuart Mill's _A System of Logic_: \\"To an inhabitant of Central Africa, fifty years ago, no fact probably appeared to rest on more uniform experience than this, that all human beings are black. To Europeans, not many years ago, the proposition, All swans are white, appeared an equally unequivocal instance of uniformity in the course of nature. Further experience has proved to both that they were mistaken\\" (chapter III, §2, page 226 of the eight edition). As this white-swans-only example of misinduction was first used by Mill, I believe Taleb should have added more bibliographical reference to his black swan metaphor. There is only one final, rather dismissing note on the work that gave Taleb nothing less than his catchy title.    I miss credit to Daniel Bernoulli when Taleb tells that \\"[c]learly your well-being becomes rapidly insensitive to further quantities\\" (page 89). I also miss credit to Burton G. Malkiel in Taleb's chapter dedicated to Philip Tetlock and Spyros Makridakis's separate studies on how economists and mathematical models fare poorly when their forecasts are confronted with the harsh reality. Malkiel has been preaching this, with much more substantiated arguments, since the first edition of _A Random Walk Down Wall Street_ in 1973!    _The Black Swan_ is an excellent book, and refreshing in that it shows how lost we live in the torrent of daily information and what an easy prey we have been to experts with fancy, math-heavy explanations for bogus forecasts. \\"Science tells us what we can know, but what we can know is little, and if we forget how much we cannot know we become insensitive to many things of very great importance.\\" Bertrand Russell wrote this in 1946 in the introduction to _History of Western Philosophy_, but it quite anticipates the ideas laid out in _The Black Swan_: try to know what you don't know, and don't think you can predict the future projecting your past observations. In other words, thereare more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in philosophy. (I hope you got the cheap plagiarism in less than three seconds.)    As you see the idea is not new, but Taleb did a wonderful job connecting the dots. His case against the misuse and abuse of the bell curve is implacable, all the more when illustrated with the crash of the LTCM fund run by Nobel Prize geniuses, whose models, well, could never be wrong. Yeah, right.     Finally, I hope you heed Taleb's advice to be suspicious of experts, and don't believe that anyone with a natural tendency can have a swimmer's body just by lifting weights or taking steroids (page 110). Taleb the physiologist, schmiologist.    Enjoy the book!
B000LC3ID8|2.0|\\"SAW III\\" or the entire \\"SAW\\" franchise for that matter has already been known as one of the goriest horror/suspense series (except, probably \\"Hostel\\" and some of Miike's films), so I expected what I would see from the beginning. Frankly I didn't care the amount of blood or violence, but when the story seems to be repeating itself, there must be a problem. Actually some part of \\"SAW III\\" is only repeating what we already know in the previous two films (though it is told from a different perspective with flashbacks).    But what is most disappointing for me is that in \\"SAW III\\" the intriguing relations between Jigsaw and one character (you know who) are not fully developed. The filmmakers, it seems, spent most of energy to set up various methods of tortures, which is fine, I admit, but they could have created something more interesting out of the master-pupil-like relations between them with more subdued approach and less swearing.     I also find the film shows its hand too early. During the film's story, we only wait for the next \\"challenge\\" to start and the results are now fairly predictable. (Remember the first \\"SAW\\" of which script showed some intelligence even in the gory trap scenes). And if Jigsaw is terminally ill, how did he manage to set up such elaborated torture machines?    The only scene I was interested is the brief moment where Jigsaw's past is suggested. After all it is him and his eccentric personality that has made \\"SAW\\" a cut above other slasher films. Let's see what happens next in the forthcoming fourth installment because considering how \\"SAW III\\" wraps up, to continue the plot after that would be the hardest part of the entire series.

0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson loves and hates Australia.  It's sunny climes and lush hills on the Gold Coast, flat open seemingly endless expanse of desert, and then another wonderful coast all serve to fill him with prose of praise for the place, and remarks on some of the stranger aspects of Ozzie life.      The people's charm is pleasantly placed next to the strangeness of a land where a Prime Minister can walk into the sea and no one hear from him again.  Or that they built a city to house all the politicians, filled it with fantastic gardens, and yet have no idea how the government actually works.      The book follow Bryson on his trip around and across the southern-most continent and is chock-a-block full of interesting stories, people, and places.  His usual wit and sarcasm does seem to fall off a bit, but (having been there I can say) that has more to do with the place than the writer.  It's almost impossible to find nasty things to say about Oz.    If you've even been to Aussie-land you'll love this book for the memories it evokes, and if you have never been consider this book as a fantastic rainy-day travel guide and let your imagination sore (then get down to your travel agent and book a flight ;)   ).
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|This is a great movie, Blu-Ray high def is the only way to view this movie.
B000PKG6TE|4.0|I think there is definately some unwarranted hate being directed towards this album. It's definately not as good as \\"Songs for the Deaf,\\" but that was when they had the absolute best lineup they ever had; the presence of Nick Oliveri and Dave Grohl really exemplified the possibilities for this project. But something you have to understand; this isn't a band, it's pretty much Josh Homme's main project.    What we have here is not an classic album like \\"Songs,\\" but a nonetheless awesome stoner rock album. There are some duds on the album ie: \\"Battery Acid\\" and \\"Into the Hollow.\\" But most of tracks are Josh Homme at his best or at least pretty damned close to it. Some pretty good tracks are \\"Turnin' on the Screw\\" and \\"3's and 7's.\\"     However, there are four songs on this album truly worth buying. \\"Sick, Sick, Sick\\" contains one of the gnarliest riffs that Homme has created since \\"Songs for the Deaf.\\" \\"River in the Road\\" is a fascinating song where an steady rock drum gallop is contrasted by surreal reverb-guitar wails and Homme's ghostly voice. \\"Run Pig Run\\" is an excellent, intricate finish to a solid album, which features bizzare shift from a power-chord-happy verse to a bizzare demonic march in the chorus(if it counts as one). Finally, the albums shining moment, \\"Make it Wit' Chu.\\" Don't be fooled by the shamelessly stupid title, this is Homme at his catchiest and his sleaziest. Even if the album doesn't get remembered, \\"Make it Wit Chu\\" is one of the best songs of 2007.    I know that some people may be wanting \\"Songs for the Deaf II.\\" Some may even want another \\"Lullabies to Paralyze;\\" I have no idea why anyone would want that... but I digress. This is a good, sleazy, trippy and damned catchy rock album. If you don't dig at one or two of the songs on here, you don't have ears.
0060578793|3.0|Very dry reading, most topics are not covered in detail, very general direction/instruction is given. Seriously, the book covers way to much for a novice. Survival experts might find this book useful because it can give them refresher training, however, for example, the fire bow section is less than half a page. This can be misleading for a novice who might think it is just that simple. Do not buy this book if you are a novice unless you have other books to learn from first. Try everything you want to learn at home, before setting out into the bush. Make a fire in your backyard using the fire bow first, then try it in the bush with a lighter in your pocket!
B000OY8NII|5.0|I had great and fast service when I ordered Eureka season 1.  I live in Europe and have an APO address and sometimes have to wait 4 or 5 weeks for items to be delivered.  Amazon shipped my order to me quickly.    Great Job!!!!

0786930640|3.0|Too many years ago for my mental comfort I used to play Dragonlance.  At the time I read the Dragonlance Chronicles and I recently decided to go back and pay a visit.  It was much what I remembered, and actually it fared badly with the number of quite good fantasy books I've read since.<br /><br />It does read like fictionalised role-playing sessions.  The team are several different people with different reasons for what they do and I'm really not sure that in the real world they would be anywhere near each other.<br /><br />Still it's fun to revisit, and it reminds me of my college years, I still like Raistlin and the team of half-elf, dwarf, kender, dark mage, barbarian, warrior and knight have appeared in a lot of books since.  The cliches are the but many of the cliches started here.  The Draconians are interesting and the path to the truth is starting to become clear.<br /><br />It's an interesting story but it's not the best.  Worth the journey back but I'm not sure I want to read more soon. Someday I may but sometimes forward is the only way to go.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|Purely and simply a stunning album, a very rich, a diverse blend substantive melodies, lyrics and vocals which hold your interest. I ordered \\"Funeral\\" after hearing the first 4 songs on \\"Neon Bible\\". Do not pass up this band you will not be able to stop playing it. In my mind the songs present many of the writings and philosophies of the late Kurt Vonnegut. This band needs to get more tours in the US -- perhaps with the Flaming Lips.
0743486285|5.0|This book was so amazing!  I loved it.  It was so raw and honest.  If you were a Motley Crue fan back in the day, you have to read this.  I felt sick to my stomach when I read some of the things he did and as a fan, I had no clue.  I saw them in concert quite a few times on the Girls tour and had no idea he was so sick.  He is an inspiration to other addicts and hopefully he can help people who think all is lost.  Im so glad things worked out for him.
067942850X|4.0|Krakauer has always been a non-fiction writer with a style very heavily seeded in literature, as his powerful narration shows in this novel. The story of the main character is one of recklessness and youthful aspirations taken to an extreme degree, and yet Krakauer--using his strong narrative skills and personal experiences--makes it so easy to identify with the main subject.<br /><br />It's a short read, but well worth the trip.<br /><br />I haven't seen the movie yet, but I wonder how good it could possibly be without Krakauer's stirring narrative prose to provide the elaborate and stunning background information found in the book.
B000UX6THK|3.0|Season 1 set had a fantastic video transfer and DTS soundtrack.  I purchased the Season 2 set and found an average video transfer with no DTS soundtrack (only DD).  So......I believe I'll wait for the Gold Box to be released on HD-DVD.  Then I'll have a real reason to buy all the episodes again.
B000WXO9HA|5.0|Kind of an honor to be the first, or one of the first, to review this great and historically important album.    Imagine, Hendrix appears at the Monterey pop festival in 1967, and launches full-force into guitar-driven hard rock, using distortion and blistering runs, and caps it off by torching his guitar. He almost shyly tells the audience before the last song, \\"Wild Thing,\\" that he loves them and will sacrifice something that is precious. Hearing those comments for the first time explains his intent in lighting his guitar on fire, an iconic image.     The audience must have been stunned, wondering what they had just experienced when Hendrix, Redding and Mitchell walked off the stage. I suspect most of the audience had NEVER heard rock played like that before.    Forty years ago, the music is still fresh. Hendrix was a pioneer, and showed versatility, from the whimsical \\"Castles in the Sand\\" to the driving \\"Foxy Lady.\\" Hendrix's innovations, making his instrument a wailing creature or a droning storm, are still copied today.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I got this for my 6 year old grandson.  He loves it.  He plays it over and over again and likes to act out the scenes.    He has become very interested in dance and can even identify the type of dance shoes each of the cats wears.

B00002SSKI|5.0|This movie intertwines the fabric of adulthood with the memories and shared events of childhood among 4 girls and their life journies ....things we take with us and things left behind ...I am fortunate to have 3 girlfriends like those in the movie and we continue to celebrate our friendships and life paths over 34 years now ...and I sent them each a copy of this DVD for our 56th birthdays this year ...

B00005N9CV|5.0|Diana Krall is a talent that enters in upon the human community once in every 100 years.  I am fortunate to be alive at the same time.  In this collection, she reaches into our psche to wrest control of what we know we are: bodies of emotion and anticipation.  I have not heard this kind of musical arrangement since the great Antonio Carlos Jobim conspired with Claus Ogerman to steal our hearts away.  Graceful, masterfully delivered, the lady lets us know who is charge of our emotions.
B000000OTY|5.0|I've loved Peter Gabriel's inspiration and creativity since the early 'Genesis days' and really appreciate his eclectic field of diverse interests and influences.  This is a killer CD.  If you're put off buying it because you have the tracks imbeded in other CD collections etc- don't be.  Gabriel does really well bringing fresh energy to his works in different seasons and this is no exception.  It is just fantastic. Consider it a fresh interpretation of many classics and an exercise powerfully assisted by the energy of the perfomances, the vib of the audience and the not inconsequential collaboration with Paula Cole.  The DVD is also great!
B000E6EH1S|5.0|There are so many recordings of the Berlioz Fantastique that the best ones help to emphasise its unique qualities. One of these superb recordings is this version by Sir Colin Davis and the Concertgebouw Orchestra. Although some people might find it a little austere, Davis secures superb playing from the Concertgebouw Orchestra. This performance is accorded superb sound that has corrected the problems of the original CD release.<br /><br />This performance stands out because it maintains the steam throughout all the five movements, and Sir Colin Davis's tempi pushes the music along. After a rapturous reading of the opening Reveries section, he hurtles the Concertgebouw into the Passions, presenting the motto-theme of the symphony simply, yet sustaining the strands of the arguments. The Ball scene sounds suitably neurotic in his hands, and the Scene in the Country conveys a rapt sense of repose, with disturbing undercurrents towards the end. I know some people will complain about the over-austere character of the last two movements, but no, Sir Colin continues to sustain the momentum of the symphony. The March to the Scaffold may not be the most propulsive, but he certainly makes it sound grim, and conveys a suitably nightmarish and macabre effect. The finale, Dream of a Sabbath Night, is taken at a brisk clip and maintains the adreanaline to the end of the work, capping a scintillating performance of this groundbreaking symphony.<br /><br />In short, I think this is a self-ercommending performance of the Fantastique that probably faces up to the competition today. Yes I know that Sir Colin's 2000 LSO Live version presents some stiff competition, but this superb studio recording has its own merits despite being 25 years old.
0345363132|5.0|After reading more historical novels than I can guess, I feel I need to go back to this book that I read quite awhile ago. This is one of my favorite books and one of the ones responsible for my love of era. I would recommend this to anyone who is willing to plow through 900 plus pages. I read all Of Sharon Kay Penman's Welsh trilogy and am sorry there has not been any recently.
B000BPFBVW|5.0|I owned the SA-CD Version and liked that a lot, especially the surround sound. But the Monster Version does this much better.  And you'll have a bouns track, too. And some MP3 versions. And an iPod versions. And ... even the price is lower.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I made a mistake with this cd.  I didn't listen to it enough, before I made my opinion.  But for whatever reason, after about the 8th or 9th listen, something clicked.  Now what can I say?  This cd is fantastic.  Its does start to trail off at the end, maybe 10 songs would have been stronger, but who cares.  Great work, by a great group.  I hope they keep putting out music for a long long time.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Honestly never watched a set of dvds more than this one! Greatest footage of wildlife ever! I completely recommend the BBC series to anyone who loves nature, the environment, and wildlife! Amazing.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I was disappointed the first time I listened to the album because I was expecting new versions of the old songs, the angry Linkin Park I know and love. But I did enjoy the music and the lyrics, and so when I listened to the album again I found that I loved this new side to Linkin Park. Some of the songs are more ballad and lyrical, but there's still plenty of harder stuff to get you going.
B00004SA88|5.0|Excellent work from Accardo. 30 years old recording sesions on this cds. Good price from 6 high quality cds. Remember that they're from Deutsche Gramophon's Label!  Some concerts have any variations respect \\"Works from violin and orchestra\\" played also by Accardo. I stronlgy recommend this cd too. Pure class A!  Regards.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I bought this on a whim. It was offered when I went to buy Coco by Colbie Caillat, and after listening to the preview on site, I figured what the hey, and got the both of them...    I'm so glad I did. I keep digging for it when I'm in the car, singing songs under my breath all day at work, and generally enjoying every second of music that she's put together. It's fast becoming one of my favorite CD's.
B000R4SMCW|4.0|I saw this the same day as Michael Clayton so I was already prepared to accept the wildly implausible.  Honestly, I liked Fracture better.  I realize it is now customary to show killing in as much detail as possible and was thankful that Fracture didn't go too far in that direction.<br /><br />Usually, I figure out the story, including all possible \\"surprises\\" within the first 10 minutes (assuming the surprises aren't spelled out in the trailer) but this time, I only got it a bit before it was revealed, so that was fun.<br /><br />And Anthony Hopkins does all this so effortlessly.  Ryan Gosling (sounds like a football player) wasn't bad, either.
0060786523|3.0|Although the core of this story is about finding a suitable groom for Lata, the book traverses different story lines at snails pace and suddenly in the last 100 or 150 pages, things come to a sudden end. Seems like the author suddenly lost interest and wants to finish a tome. Otherwise good.
0007229739|2.0|I was surprised to see that Amazon has sold 815,000 copies of this book but that no one has reviewed it yet.  So I'll give it a shot.  I actually listened to the Recorded Books version rather than read the book.  Out of work programmer, Jack, starts to worry about how hard his wife Julia is working at Xymos. Xymos is developing a swarm of nanoparticles with distributed intellegence for the military.  The application is military surveillance, the swarm will be used as a camera.  The details really don't matter.  After Julia is nearly killed in an unexplained auto accident, Jack is hired by Xymos to help them with a programming problem. Some of the programmers at Xymos used to work with Jack.  Jack had developed a program called PredPray for distributed intellegences and Xymos told Jack they were having problems with his program.  What Jack finds is that the manufacturing facility, located way out in the desert, has lost control of several swarms of particles which are now living in the desert around the facility. And they are dangerous, killing local wildlife and reproducing.  Needless to say, Jack eventually saves the day.  I have two big problems with this book.  First, Jack is pretty slow on the uptake.  It seemed pretty apparent to me that things were much worse at the facility then what Jack was being told.  The whole story is told in first person perspective by Jack so the reader is not aware of anything other than Jack sees.  People at the facility whom Jack knows, including his wife, are not acting like themselves.  And although Jack questions this in his head, his suspicions are not translated into action until things start to get out of hand.  The other problems is that Crichton seems to be treating his readers like they are a bit dim witted as well.  There were multiple explanations of the same concepts to the point where I was practically yelling at my CD player to get on with the story for God's sake.    And the ending was unsatisfactory.  Too many looseends.  When Julia has her car accident (her car hurtles off a cliff and she is barely injured)  there was apparently a swarm in her car.  Jack seems to realize this but gives no thought to what happened to it.  The car crash wouldn't have hurt it.  I guess we'll have to wait for Prey 2.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|9 dvd's 53 bucks you can't beat it i love it and the price is right.
0767827791|5.0|This is one great flick!  Who would have thought that William Holden had such great dance moves?  A beautiful play, nicely adapted.  Good acting by Holden, and Kim Novak
B000PMGS8G|3.0|This garish Star Wars cash-in takes time getting going, but it provides good 70s fun.  It's both ambitious and unpretentious.  The picture on the DVD is sharp and colorful, but how about slapping on some extras?  A commentary track or a history of the character might have been nice.
1594489505|5.0|Every once and a while a book comes along that, at times, is truly difficult to read. Not because of the writing, which in this case is lyrical and beautifully precise, but because a character you have grown to care for is dealt one hurtful blow after another. Cheering for the two women who loom larger than life and outgrow the confines of the written page is an automatic response and despite the bittersweet outcome, one is enriched by having known them at all. This is the kind of book you think about days, weeks, even months later. Its lesson haunts in subtle ways, reminding us about all the gifts we have that are often taken for granted. Another triumph for Hosseini.
B000WSL5Y0|4.0|Gone Baby Gone is Ben Affleck's directorial debut, and it's a good one. He obviously knows this territory-the rough streets of South Boston--and this people, and the result is a movie that feels real, populated by characters who breathe, make mistakes, try their best, and often fail. The movie is full of unexpected turns, but they never feel contrived or silly, as in so many other films. I look forward to seeing Affleck's next movie.
B000WSJNWQ|5.0|Watching this movie made me think why haven't this subject been tackled so far.  Secret Service agencies have been practicing \\"rendition\\" post 9/11, this was long due.    Very good performances by everyone.  The plot kept me riveted for the entire time, well actually at the corner of my seat.  Well done movie.  Every American should watch it.
B000R8YC18|5.0|\\"Taxi Driver\\" is certainly one of the finest films in the American tradition; it stands out among films from a very strong decade. It's certainly one of Scorcese's best, and one of his earliest mature works- if \\"Mean Streets\\" works as a transitional stand-alone film between his early, genre pictures and his later, more varied works, \\"Taxi Driver\\" is only his second film of the period. It is a directoral masterwork; each decision that Scorcese made here was the right one. It's also one of the clearer examples of the extent to which the American 70s were in a thrall to the films of the Nouvelle Vague. But I digress. The movie has one clear thematic problem, and it's Shrader's. Why does Bickle take Betsy to a porno? If he idealizes her (and he does) he should separate her from the mass by which he is clearly disgusted. Thus, he should wish to protect her from the things he associates with the mass- namely pornography and prostitution. Bickle is clearly torn between including himself in the mass he envisions as damned and separating himself from them; he sees Betsy as a means of saving himself. He only goes to porn theatres to ritualistically purge himself of the tendencies which align him with the mass; Betsy is supposed to take him out of it altogether. Yet, he takes her to a porno. This doesn't make much sense and it's the only reason \\"Taxi Driver\\" isn't as good as \\"Raging Bull,\\" \\"Goodfellas,\\" and \\"Mean Streets.\\" This doesn't mean that \\"Taxi Driver\\" isn't a great or important film. It's outstanding, and this new edition is much-needed.    Speaking of this new edition, it's long overdue. I own the 2001 Special Edition and watched it last week only to be horrified by the grainy, defect-ridden transfer. The 2001 print is a mess- the movie looks as bad as the grindhouse flicks it sometimes mirrors. The transfer in this set could be as bad as an average '01 release and still it would be an improvement. As I don't own the new set, I can't comment on the new features, but they look to be substantial. Therefore, this 2-disc set is absolutely essential for every person with a DVD player.
0805079831|5.0|It is easy to get te wrong impression of The Shock Doctrine:  The Rise of Disaster Capitalism.  The premise (a cabal of politicians, academics, multi-national businessmen, and researchers seek to remake the world in their own image for the fun of power, control and wealth)is dark.  The author is a gorgeous eyeful.  It would be easy to imagine this as another far-fetched ghost-written consipracy theory clammoring for acceptance.    Except that this work is 444 pages long with 70 pages of footnotes to validate its claims and as such it deserves to be seriously considered by any who are concerned with the declining standard of living and order in their world.      The scope of this work is impressive as it traces the current state of things back to the 60's CIA mind control experiments through the \\"regime changes\\" in places like Chile, Argentina, Poland, and South Africa, to the more recent debacles in Katrina afflicted New Orleans and Iraq.    To read Klein's work is like putting on a pair of corrective lens that allow the reader to make sense of so much of history of the past 40 years.  This book deserves to be bought, read, and discussed among thoughtful people concerned about the future.
B000063UR1|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time when it was in theaters. Younger movie fans will find it can't compare with modern film-making in special effects (no movie this old can) and will have no reason to suspect the level of impact it had on teenagers and college students at that time. Despite being pre-Star Wars, the models of the space ships and scenes inside the ship were impressive. The technology and mission felt big and important - impressive - and the autonomous robots Huey, Dewey, and Louie were wonders. Add to that a lead character (Lowell) and his cause played brilliantly against the backdrop of rebellious attitudes of the day. (Just look up Joan Baez, who sang folksy save the children and the earth songs through the movie, in your history books.) Despite being a psychotic megalomaniacal murderer, I have friends who still remember Lowell as a heroic friend of the true earth and the human spirit. I must therefore, give this movie a full five.
0446364495|5.0|As most know, The Bridges of Madison County is an instant classic.  Although a bit of a chick-flick type book, it provides great insight into the longings and motivations of women. And Ladies - it's a great emotional story, but NOT one we should replicate!
B000O75F7C|2.0|Save your money. You've already heard everything Wilson has to say here on Deadwing and In Absentia.  I've been a big fan of Wilson's earlier works and I will admit the playing on FOABP is as good as it's ever been. However, the overall song writing has continued to slip. At this point he's just beating a dead wing. I mean dead horse...sorry I couldn't resist.  Let's hope it's just a case of temporary \\"writers block\\".

B000R7I3LY|5.0|Why in heck am I am not hearing Sara Bareilles on the radio???? This is an AWESOME cd, people. If you like Sarah McLachlan and Norah Jones but think they're a little too soft, mellow or long-winded, you'll LOVE Sara Bareilles. She writes beautiful tight melodies with evocative lyrics that you can listen to all day. Plus she has a beautiful voice- go check out some of her live performances on youtube and you'll see that she really has the pipes. My personal favorites are \\"Love Song\\", \\"Bottle it Up\\", \\"Morningside\\", \\"Between the Lines\\", \\"Love on the Rocks\\" and \\"Gravity\\". I usually only like one or two songs on a cd, but this one is full of quality music. Just go buy it already!

0316166685|3.0|This book didn't even come close to wowing me, however much I expected it too. I was expecting something along the lines of The Kite Runner or Life of Pi, an relatively new book that I would enjoy.    The premise was very good, but the plot lines just sucked horribly. Half formed plots that you get the idea that the author thought about developing but then just went nah. This book flits from here to there with no real feeling of going anywhere, and you know that's not a completely horrible thing, it fits in with the idea of the book, the theme being mostly about life, but still, things happen, and you expect other things to happen related to that, but they never do. The climax of the book comes when Susie gets laid, really, that's it, just thought I'd add that.    The shining part of the book was the occasional times it could make you feel empathy for the characters, and often times it was strong, it's the only reason this doesn't get a 1 from me, but I guess that's ok, again, the book wasn't meant to be big on plot I don't think, but a little structure would of been nice.
B00008CLOA|5.0|In a Sony SCDCE595 player hooked up to 2 small Bose speakers, the difference in sound compared to a CD I bought in the 90s is huge.  There is so much texture to the sound on this SACD that it was distracting & even took me a moment to get used to.  What a treat for my ears.  To think vinyl sounds better than this.  Amazing.<br /><br />Afterwards, my old CDs sounded flat & boring.  Newer & remastered CDs sounded ok.<br /><br />I can only imagine what this will sound like with appropriate speakers.  I suppose that's my next project.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|R&eacute;my (Patton Oswalt) is a rat, constantly risking life in an expensive French restaurant because of his love of good food, as well as a desire to become a chef. Yet, obviously, this is a rather tough dream for a rat. But opportunity knocks when a young boy named Linguini (Lou Romano), who desperately needs to keep his job at the restaurant, despite his lack of cooking abilities, discovers and partners the young R&eacute;my. Its up to the two of them to avoid the insane head chef, bring the rest of R&eacute;my's family up to his standards, win his partner a girl, and, of course, produce the finest ratatouille in all of France.<br /><br />The short feature preceding this, Lifted, involving an alien spaceship, is brilliant, now that WAS funny! Not wanting to put a dampner on things, but I didn't actually find Ratatouille as funny as previous Pixar films such as Monsters, Inc., Toy Story or The Incredibles.<br />OK, there were some funny scenes/gags in it and great slapstick when Linguini is \\"controlled\\" by R&eacute;my tugging on his hair underneath his chef's hat, but it isn't a laff-riot in my opinion and quite a lot goes by without many obvious jokes.<br />However, strangely, that may work in the film's favour as where it is strongest is in its story - the well-rounded characters that show more subtlety than most real human actors, the human characters like loveable loser Linguini and female chef Colette (Janeane Garofalo), as well as our rat hero R&eacute;my, and some scenes which are surprisingly emotional and touching. Pixar has always been very good at that sort of thing and the complexity and beleivability of the relationships in the film - for example, some moments of shy arkwardness between Linguini and Colette will strike a chord with any nervous guy who has fallen in love, or the scenes involving R&eacute;my and his family are perhaps even more appealing to adults than to children.<br />Peter O'Toole steals the show as slimy food critic Anton Ego, himself a swipe at critics.<br />Overall, despite the lack of belly laughs, it's a very enjoyable, fine animated film.belly laughs, it's a very enjoyable, fine animated film.
0061547832|5.0|I was able to read this book in one sitting and was able to take things from it that I can apply to my own business life. I will disagree with him on Chapter 9 concerning pre-nuptual agreements. My attitude is that if you need that much \\"certainty\\", then you have NO BUSINESS getting or being married. If you're married to your business where the spouse takes a back seat, don't get married. What I wished Trump would man up about is that it wasn't  his \\"marriage\\" to the business that got him in hot water, but his own infidelity that caused the demise of his first two marriages.    I always recommend that people treat books like these as you would a Chinese buffet: take what you need and leave the rest for the next man.
0618680004|4.0|Let me start out by saying that I am an atheist like Dawkins. I have not read any of his other books, but his credentials in the scientific community are vast, from what I have learned of him. Having said that, I find that there are whole sections in this book that I didn't know quite what to make of.<br /><br />Let me start with the negatives. Dawkins seems a tad bit too much of a fan of Darwin for his own good. His constant mention of the phrase \\"Darwinian Evolution\\" gets a bit tiring in spots. He could've just used the word \\"evolution\\" and his points  would've been just as clear. This is not to diminish Darwin's contributions to science, which are evidently immense. His discoveries may well be THE most important in the field of biology - ever.<br />Also, the alternate cosmological theories he goes into, such as the multiverse theory, seem to me a little vague. Granted, those probably work on fewer assumptions than the positing of a god as an explanation for the cosmos, but they still seem little more than hypotheses. This could be my fault, and further research may illuminate these points more. But, that is precisely my gripe. Within the scope of the book, it seems out of place to devote an entire section to these theories, which would need much, much more development to even begin to be understood by laymen.<br /><br />Now, on to the positives. His treatment of the most common arguments for God's existence is devastating and concise. If you have read any atheist book before, you've probably heard those before, and just as well refuted. A good one that comes to mind is George H. Smith's \\"Atheism: The case against God.\\"  That book was written in the 1970's. Therefore, Dawkins includes some more recent \\"arguments\\", such as the Bayesian and (surprise!) Irreducible Complexity/Intelligent Design. His refutals don't get any better. These arguments are shown for what they are: sad attempts at holding on to the \\"gaps\\" in scientific knowledge, and proclaiming God as the solution, without any logical sequence or causal relationship between the phenomena and God.<br /><br /> The section on The Bible is also delicious, if not really new. Anyone who reads the Bible without ASSUMING that it HAS TO be \\"perfect\\" can plainly see the obvious atrocities, inconsitencies, and downright hate in it. Assumptions are something to avoid if one wants to think clearly. Yet, obviously, unwarranted assumptions are the lifeblood of religions. Of course, they euphemize it to \\"faith\\", but we know what that truly is.<br /><br /> Dawkins' application of evolutionary ideas to the field of morality was quite fascinating as well. Evidently, given the scope of the book, he is merely sketching out the basics. Those concepts would also need more space to be developed properly. But, in my opinion, this section can stand on its own, as opposed to his sections on alternate cosmological theories.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great book, yet not without its flaws. It is full of food for thought. Like other reviewers have pointed out, the deeply faithful would not even read a book like this. Those who do, would probably not get it. Religious people in general are not used to really (and I do mean REALLY) analyze their own beliefs in a truly critical, truly unbiased manner. That said, a book like this is much needed in this day and age. Lucky for us, Dawkins is not the only one.any logical sequence or causal relationship between the phenomena and God.

0321334876|5.0|There are very few technical books that I have read more than once. I can count on one hand the number that I have read three times. Scott Meyers' Effective C++ is one that I have not only read more than once, but have bought three separate editions and read them all more than once. This latest edition is not just a minor updating of previous editions. It contains far more information than earlier editions, and even goes beyond what libraries provided with common compilers currently deliver, making use of the tr1 (Technical Report 1) stuff that will be the future. That's not to say it cannot be used right now - learn from Meyers and use the Boost library (downloadable free) until tr1 becomes commonly available.     In my opinion this third edition is no longer suitable for people new to C++, but once developers have some C++ experience under their belt this becomes a must have. That's not just because most interviewers get their technical questions from Meyers' books (they really do!), but because the content is genuinely useful.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|KILL TO GET CRIMSON is the work of a mature artist very comfortable and skilled in his art and craft. Knopfler here makes his song stories into soft watercolors and vivid oils that take on movement with a pristine soundtrack. His voice is full and his guitar performance effortless, set in sparse, tasteful arrangements. The rich recording and elegant production by his longtime engineers and musical partners, Chuck Ainlay and Guy Fletcher, add the final artistic touches.

0143038583|5.0|This book had me enthralled from start to finish. Pollan's writing style is informal yet skilled - effortless to read yet highly informative. That's so much harder than it sounds. Furthermore he's willing and able to confront his own ambivalence on an issue and will gladly acknowledge opposing points of view even as his own view changes. This sort of introspection and personal touch is quite rare for a book that's so informative.    It's divided into three main sections: first, a history and overview of American agribusiness, which is a history and overview of corn. Corn is in nearly everything you buy (even the cucumbers in your produce section have a corn-based wax on them to help preserve them). It's subsidized and grown unsubstainably to the tune of billions of dollars a year, then the gigantic piles of surplus corn are further subsidized as they try to figure out just what to do with it all. The answer is to get you, the consumer, to eat more of it. It's all quite fairly handled, I think, but the depths of the excess are still shocking.    In the second part of the book, Pollan examines sustainable grass farming as compared to the industrial model. This is where your hope may be restored, even as you realize what a tiny part of the giant food chain farms such as Polyface are. But he also examines what a joke the term 'organic' has become - you may be mortified to find that certain brands are really nothing more than an excuse to sell you crap produced in nearly the same way as in giant non-organic farms at a higher price. They do this by selling you a picture of a happy farm with cows and chickens out to pasture (as Polyface really is) when the reality is far, far different. This is not going to be a good book for you if you're a fan of Whole Foods Market and don't want to know how you're being fooled.    Finally he sets out on a quest to produce a dinner from scratch containing only items he's grown, harvested, or killed himself - which turns out to be an amazing amount of work. And this is the chapter where religious vegetarians go nuts. Pollan examines his own beliefs, goes vegetarian for a time to further put them to the test, but then nonetheless hunts and kills a wild pig for his dinner. His description of the entire process, from anticipation, fear, nervousness, joy, utter disgust, and final acceptance rings very true, and he spares little of himself in writing it up. And in the end he decides that it's more the process (how industrial livestock is treated) than the principle (eating animals) that matters to him the most and reconciles himself with eating meat.    So if you are a vegetarian for moral reasons rather than simply health reasons you are going to hate this chapter and it's going to spoil the whole book for you (as you can see in some of the other reviews). For the rest of us, however, it's a rather inspiring examination of the problems of eating meat, or indeed of eating at all. He lays out a hierarchy of food production desirability from local sustainable production and consumption to full scale industrial on the other end. I have already adjusted my habits and am eating less industrial food - and have noticed just how nearly impossible it is to give it up entirely unless you grow your own food, which I'm not in a position to do.

B00006J9OT|3.0|I can't say I've ever been blown away by Diana, but this album turned me off somewhat.  Like many female singers of note - Jennifer Warnes, for instance - Diana's voice can be too strong, and in too many places here she doesn't restrain it.  Perhaps she's a better jazz pianist than jazz singer.  I do enjoy the instrumental portions of this album.

Since then i've been hooked and must have listened to One Day Remains at least 20 times. Waiting for Blackbird, i  knew that this cd was going to be amazing, but the first time i listened to it i was literally blown away. The first track Ties That Bind grabbed me and wouldn't let me go. Simply put, this is one of the best pure rock albums to be released so far this year and it is a must buy. If you are a fan of rock, you need to own this cd.
B000UR9T7I|5.0|I saw both the first and second and am waiting until the 3rd is released on Blu-Ray before making my review, but hands-down number 2 took a dump/poop. Spidey 1 is my fav at this point. I would not base my conclusions/opinions on what others have posted here that's for sure!!!!
B000WSL5Y0|3.0|Less a detective noir thriller, as reviews and promos have led me to believe, and more of a melodramatic Boston crime saga, like author Dennis Lehane's \\"Mystic River\\", with an unlikely 'surprising' conclusion crowning an otherwise dark involved drama concerning the disappearance of a four-year old Boston girl.<br /><br />The girl's aunt and uncle, frustrated by the police's lack of success hire a street level private investigating team, (Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan), who quickly unravel a connection with the girl's disappearance and a drug king's stolen booty.<br /><br />Casey Affleck, directed by brother Ben, is a striking and unassuming leading player, a cross between a short John Cusack, and an adult Beaver Cleaver, and his common man characterization, all searching eyes and wiry reflexes, as he reveals a genuine familiarity with seedy Boston neighborhoods, (in real life he would have been shot a couple hundred times), is really the only redeeming factor I could find in the film. He deftly pulls off a righteousness that would seem impossible in a tough Boston private eye. Michelle Monaghan, as his partner in bed and in business, is a badly drawn character, who apparently represents only femininity, and does little else but worry the entire film. She's a dull girl Friday who would have been knocked out of the way by Miss Marple on her search for a clue.<br /><br />Given it's theme and one scene of a brutally molested child, the film's lesser roller coaster ride of standard detective fare is a trifle off-beat and insignificant. Twists and turns are piled as high as a pastrami on rye, and the conclusion is simply melodramatic trite, like a lesser Agatha Christie, and seems and excuse for Affleck to deliver his fine little speech on truth and dignity.<br /><br />If you loved Clint Eastwood's \\"Mystic River\\", you'll also love Ben Affleck's \\"Gone Baby Gone\\". If you like your crime fiction with a little less emotional bloat, and your idea of gritty realism doesn't include tortured murdered children, I suggest another round of \\"The Maltese Falcon\\".children, I suggest another round of \\"The Maltese Falcon\\".

B000UGG39Q|4.0|Haven't been able to sit down & listen to the whole thing through ... but so far it's just a great album!
B00005IC2H|2.0|Ok, they have an original sound. The lead male singer sings like a female ingenue - which is good as he does a good job of getting the maximum emotional value out of the Icelandic/nonsense lyrics (which serve as a blank slate that you can superimpose any meaning on - which isn't a bad idea, either). A few of these songs do evoke the barren Icelandic landsscape that has plenty of volcanoes, ice, and few (no?) trees. I'm afraid that all of that is not enough to sustain an entire cd. This gets tedious quickly. A lot of droning in minor chords, music that goes nowhere, etc. Yes, it is different. But if it's only appeal is novelty, the novelty - like all novelties - wears off quickly. They need more substance and less surface sheen.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|My purchase of this CD from Amazon was an example of outstandingly good fate, since I bought it as a package recommendation on a whim without listening to any of it.      Paolo Nutini impresses me as an exceptionally gifted young musician.  It's hard to describe what makes him uniquely absorbing.  He has a great voice, writes interesting songs, and all.  But there is something more to me.      He conveys to me a genuine love for making music and for whom much comes quite naturally.  Some of his songs have great lyrics, but are really short on verses.  He pulls it off by resinging the same lines but transforming them with the accent, tempo, or melody.    I have not yet seen him perform, but know and have heard from those who have, that he is phenomenal.  What I do know from experience is my \\"favorite\\" song on the album keeps changing, always a great sign to me.
0525950079|5.0|I cannot even begin to agree with the negative comments posted here. Maybe we did not read the same book?  I read Pillars of the Earth when I was many years younger, as I suspect many have.  Many years have gone by, and \\"Word without End\\" reflects the advent of the internet availing greater capacity for extensive research about the period in question, thus more accurate and graphical descriptions are on reach. However, it is not a rehash of the first book; the time is two hundred years later when changes were not mind boggling as in the last 100+ years or so. Mr. Follett openly discusses (in today's language, oops, how could he have done that?) many issues germane to the facets of daily living amongst the town's folk and neighbors including common sexual practices,political, social and financial interactions, courting and marrying practices, medical, agricultural, religiouos and technical issues. I found the book fascinating from the story telling to the description of technical etails. I did not enjoy the description of less pleasant subjects dealing with common day practices of torture and misstreatment of both people and animals; but those issues were very much part of the 12th century as well. I think it is amongst Mr. Follet's finest works.
B000WCBPOG|4.0|If you loved this film and it moved you, it's well worth having the soundtrack. I like the new interpretations of the song, as they remind me of the feelings in the film. Hearing the songs in a genre blender is fun and creative. It is worth the extra money to have the Deluxe Edition, the songs painted a delicious picture in my mind, and I like revisiting all of them in my mind for a little extra money.    I will say that if you are a die hard Beatles fan, you may be happy that a movie of this concept was created, but you may also be upset that the original songs were not used. I say that this soundtrack is a wonderful and moving interpretation and tribute to the power that went into these songs originally.    Get this album if the film moved you and you liked the music, not just because it's the Beatles. A magical film, and what comes from it is a magical soundtrack.

B000QFAJ7S|1.0|Im a HUGE fan of KC's first two albums.  Unfortunately, this one is a coaster.  Part of the problem is in the engineering.  Often the music smothers the vocals.  The other part of the problem is the songs just arent very good.  It almost feels like the music was recorded seperately from the vocals, and they were paired together by some random means.  I respect the fact that this is the album Kelly wanted, but for me its just a horrible waste of talent.   She was obviously aiming for edgy, but she hit 'bad' right on the head.
B000UOOT1W|4.0|Imagine if Capitol Records put out an ULTIMATE BEATLES collection, but didn't include anything from A HARD DAY'S NIGHT through SGT PEPPER. That's what ULTIMATE SANTANA feels like. There are six tracks from their classic first three albums:  SANTANA (1969), ABRAXAS (1970) and SANTANA III (1971). Then (except for \\"Europa\\" from 1976's AMIGOS), none of the remaining tracks date back any further than 1999's SUPERNATURAL. In fact, more than half of the tracks on this collection come from Santana's \\"comeback\\" period when the band released three star-studded albums including SUPERNATURAL, SHAMAN (2002) and ALL THAT I AM (2005).<br /><br />Longtime fans will be better served by 1998's single-disc THE BEST OF SANTANA or 2002's double-disc THE ESSENTIAL SANTANA. This latest collection is principally targeted for Santana's latter-day fans. There are flashes of brilliance with the big name cameos (\\"Smooth,\\" for example, was a huge hit for a reason--it's a damn good song), but overall they pale in comparison to the band's seminal Seventies' work. If you're interested in Santana's work over the past decade (but don't want to purchase their last three albums), this does a nice job of catching you up.
0060082569|4.0|the quality of the audio tapes is good.  makes listening to them easy and interesting... however, with my order one of the 16 tapes was broken and could not be repaired in any such way :(  so i lost out on about 2.5 chapters of the end of the battle of Ia Drang.  overall the movie is no substitute for the book... Hal tells what really happened at Ia Drang in full detail and one is also able to learn exactly what the vietnamese PAVN and VC troops did in the future to prevent full scale battles like the battle of Ia Drang (not to mention learning about how General Westmorland didn't take heed to Hal's after action report and therefor we suffered more casulties in the future after Ia Drang)...  ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ.
B000W4HJ44|3.0|You probably won't like my review but that won't stop me from writing it.    I have seen the original John Waters version of the movie and saw the play on Broadway (I missed the run with Harvey Fierstein playing Edna but I have the CD of the music).  When they announced that they were making this as a movie, I was excited until I heard that John travolta was playing the role of Edna Turnblat.  It just didn't make sense to me because the role calls for talent.  It also calls for impersonating a woman.  They padded him up with fluff and dressed him for the part but still he couldn't pull the part off.  I kept thinking to myself that they should have brought in Harvey Fierstein to play the role--it would have made the movie 5 stars easily.      Michelle Pfeiffer--keep your crabs.  You missed the boat there.  The whole audition for the Corney COllins show should have included the \\"I can hear the bells\\"--why put it afterwards in the school?  Then to have in it's place an overdramatic Michelle Pfeiffer playing miss baltimore crabs - a major letdown on 2 of my favorite songs from Broadway.    After being nasty I can now allow myself to be nice.  Queen Latifa -- EXCELLENT.  Tracy Turnblat -- shinging and brilliant!  The rest of the cast were excellent as well--including Jerry Stiller (the only returning character from the original John Water's movie (though his part changed).    in summation, 5 stars for the music, dancing, excitement and story line.  0 stars for Edna turnblatt.  Average -- 3 stars.  Next time don't go for star appeal, go for star quality.
B00009ATIX|4.0|Steven Soderbergh's 2002 film Solaris (based on the book [[ASIN:0156027607 Solaris]] by Stanislaw Lem) is a very intelligent and thorougly insightful film.  It's slow and meditative, but it's not as cold as those descriptions would make it out to be.    The premise of is a ship circling a newly found, but mysterious planet with the ability to generate lost loved ones.  From then on, every question that comes out of that situation is brought up.  The line between human and artificial, the reality of love, the intelligence of the unknown.    This is a very good movie that, if youve seen Tarkovsky's 70's version [[ASIN:B00006L92F Solaris - Criterion Collection]], works as a companion piece.  Fantastic actually.    The DVD features a commentary from the director Steven Soderbergh ([[ASIN:0767812158 sex, lies, and videotape]], [[ASIN:B000067IZ3 Traffic]]) and the producer James Cameron ([[ASIN:B00005N5S5 The Terminator]], [[ASIN:B000ANVQ0K Titanic (Three-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]]), also featuring two featurettes, a behind the scenes one, and a inside the planet one, and the original trailer and screenplay.    HIghly recommended.

0321344758|2.0|I am definitely not a usability expert but I was expecting much more substance from a \\"self proclaimed\\" expert. The examples are so obvious, dumbed down and old (from 1999-2000). I think this book should entirely be written with Web 2.0 in mind. I agree that design principles do not change over time, and this book is not about technology, but users expect more and more with new technologies. While some design patterns stay the same, some evolve and become expected with the advent of newer technologies.    Don't waste your time with this book, and buy a more recently written book for people who really want to know about usability.
B00005JPKE|5.0|As much as I liked Flags of Our Fathers, I was not prepared for the emotional reaction I would have to this brilliant film. Eastwood is one of the greatest living directors (and will rank with the best of all time).  He is consistently growing in scope and compassion; he's long past his Dirty Harry vigilante movies.  I think only an Eastwood could have pulled off this movie showing the Japanese side of the battle of Iwo Jima.  At the end I was crying, for these soldiers who knew they were dying and doomed, as well as for our soldiers who fought bitterly for that island.  Most of all I cried for the horrendous waste of life in wars started by greedy and unscrupulous politicians, right up to today's Bushes and Cheneys who glorify war (but never fought themselves).    I couldn't forget (nor was I meant to forget) the horrors inflicted by the Japanese on the Allies or the Rape of Nanking.  But this one focuses on the soldiers who are taught dying is great for their country, many of whom would just prefer to be home with their families and don't think the war is great.    The acting is first rate; so were the direction, the script, photography.  In short, this film is damned near perfect.  I cried for all the soldiers forced to die for something many did not believe in.  As Dylan once wrote, every country thinks God is on its side.

B00005JPWF|5.0|I'm probably in the minority in having gone to see Sean Penn's film version of \\"Into the Wild\\" without having first read Jon Krakauer's book. The movie has met my most stringent test: it made me want to go out and buy the book immediately. I had always thought of Chris McCandless as some sort of suicidal fool, but Penn opened my eyes to another, completely different interpretation: that McCandless was in the great tradition of American wanderers, from Daniel Boone forward, who sought distant horizons and a more intense, more direct engagement with nature and life. We're used to hearing the success stories in wilderness adventure; McCandless' story, alas, ended tragically, through a series of misfortunes and miscalculations such as (at least according to Penn) could have befallen most people in the same situation. But, as Penn shows us, McCandless' two years of wanderings across America before meeting his end in the Alaskan wilderness were quite a ride. Working from his own screenplay and with the aid of the brilliant photographer Eric Gautier, Penn presents McCandless as an intelligent, educated young man who sought escape for the usual reasons: an unhappy home life and a general disgust with the materialism of American life, particularly as represented by his family. McCandless' experiences on the way to Alaska, and the people he meets along the way, lead him finally (again, at least according to Penn) to the revelation that happiness is not a solitary emotion; it must be shared. Unfortunately, he comes to that conclusion too late. I can't help but wish that, before his journey, McCandless could have met John Haines and had the benefit of his advice. Haines, another educated young man who went to roughly the same part of Alaska as McCandless and homesteaded there successfully for the better part of 40 years, in the meantime writing some of the best American poetry of the latter half of the 20th century. (At the time McCandless left for Alaska, Haines was teaching in the Jenny McKean Moore program at George Washington University; I was one of his students there.) However much Penn's movie diverges from Krakauer's book or the reality of McCandless' life, there's no question his movie is a powerful experience, enhanced by the honest, thoughtful and emotionally direct performance of Emile Hirsch as McCandless. The supporting cast is also noteworthy, including William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden and Jena Malone as McCandless' family and Brian Dierker, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and Kristen Stewart as folks McCandless meets in his travels. The best supporting performance is by Hal Holbrook--these days looking more like T.S. Eliot than Mark Twain--as an elderly desert-dweller who takes a grandfatherly interest in McCandless.n the Jenny McKean Moore program at George Washington University; I was one of his students there.)

B000OCY7JE|5.0|After the Wedding is seamless, holding our attention, engaging our emotions and satisfying our cinematic needs with a story of human weakness, strength, heart and the capriciousness of fate, incredibly heart-wrenching, and full of some very, very strong performances, great film.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|There have been so many reviews written here that there is not a whole lot that I can add to what has already been said.  I'll merely state that this is my favorite animated film of the year.  I'll also confess that when I first heard about it and saw the previews, I was not impressed.  To me a movie about a rat who was also a cooking genius seemed both farfetched and ludicrous.  I was convinced that they had more or less run out of ideas.  I was wrong.  The film is bristling with great ideas and wonderful touches of humor.  The software that allows them to produce this level of CGI is nothing short of astonishing.  It only makes you wonder what software thirty years from now is going to make possible.<br /><br />One interesting decision is the way that in their CGI and character design they've decided to go incredibly realistic in all inanimate objects, but somewhat \\"cartoonish\\" in all animated characters.  The software has clearly come to the point where it would be possible to make humans look extremely realistic.  Instead, they decided to make them look like extreme caricatures.  I personally applaud this decision.  It makes for far more expressive characters.  Also, if they were trying for extreme realism it would call too much attention to that fact.<br /><br />After this film and THE INCREDIBLES, I might be willing to say that Brad Bird is my favorite animated director currently working in the United States.  I can't be too confident in saying that simple because his total body of work is too small.  But I was delighted with THE IRON GIANT when it first came out and he has done nothing since then to disappointment me.  From here on out I'll go out of my way to see one of his movies.
0374280967|5.0|For such a slim novella, \\"The Uncommon Reader\\" operates on many levels. Most obviously, it is a charming, comedic story. But it's also a meditation on the merits ... and the limits ... of books and reading as a means of opening one's eyes (as the book's subject might say) and softening one's sensibilities. It's about what an awakening familiarity with literature can do to a person, and also the havoc it can create for people who expect life to be led in certain familiar pattern. That's a lot to fit into a hundred-and-some pages, but Alan Bennett does it extremely well. Though I'd been somewhat familiar with him for some time, this is the first time I've really explored his writing. No wonder he's thought of so highly.<br /><br />One of the things that most pleased me about this book was the sympathetic and affectionate portrayal of Her Majesty. With so many people evidently taking it for granted that the Windsors are all a bunch of cold-hearted nitwits, Bennett's Queen is -- if admittedly somewhat limited in the breadth of her education -- thoughtful, self-aware, eager to learn, and on the whole a most memorable personality.<br /><br />I think anyone who enjoys reading and appreciates the power of books will enjoy watching The Queen's royal progress in these pages. But beware: the realization she eventually reaches (about writing as well as reading) is one I believe Bennett wants to lead every reader to, common or otherwise.

I have many other SACD recordings and take great pleasure in rediscovering emotions through them, but I find this mix extremely lacking in bass, and the recording completely saturated. Not at all as how I remember the original.A very disappointing re-mix of a super album.

The reality of production and the amazing performances of the actors, as well as the beautiful music are enchanting!!! Richard Armitage as John Thornton is perfect! And Daniela Denby-Ashe as Margaret Hale is also amazing! I could not put the DVDs down, I watched all 4 parts right away! 5 stars for this gripping drama and for the fantastic performances given!!!!

Basically, if you enjoy indie/alternative/techno/experimental music, this album doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />What's great is that each song has it's own unique feeling. You've got your dance-driven tracks like Get Innocuous, Us V Them, and more mellow tracks like Someone Great, and the ballad-like New York I Love You But You're Bringing Me Down. Even after my first listening, I could distinguish songs apart, and it didn't all \\"blend together\\". I'm not familiar with anything off of LCD Soundsystem's debut album, but after listening to Sound of Silver, I'm looking into buying that too.<br /><br />At only $6.00 for the MP3 Album download, it's well worth the money!<br /><br />Best tracks: Get Innocuous!, Time To Get Away, North American Scum, Us V Them, Watch the Tapes, Sound of Silver<br /><br />If you fall in love with this album like I did, I would also recommend LCD Soundsystem's A Bunch of Stuff EP, which contains great remixes of the songs on here.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|I classify movies as see/don't see. Amongst the \\"see\\", they're either rent or own. I own The Good Shepherd, but would be just as satisfied if I had rented it.  This is the genre of John le Carre, not James Bond. It's closer to fact than fiction. The spy business is slow and painstaking. As such, the craft doesn't lend itself well to dynamic fictional films we've grown to crave.  Good Shepherd accurately depicts the recruitment by the character representing Wild Bill Donovan (Robert DeNiro)of Ivy Leaguers into the OSS..aka \\"Oh So Social\\". Right on target there. The chill of the Ivy League personality is well portrayed by Matt Damon, but his character goes overboard. Not to give away any highlights, but it would take an abnormally and truly unbelieveably cold man to resist the amorous advances of a young, randy \\"Clover\\"...Angelina Jolie. His war years and craft development droll on slowly. Return to the States and a marriage to the new CIA - clearly chosen over \\"Clover\\", whom he opts to ignore to the point you are thinking he either has a) no emotion or b) no testosterone. His relationship with his son is as warm and fuzzy, and resurfaces as a keystone in the film as Damon is haunted by questions of honor and the memories of his own Father. The cinematography is pretty good, as is the overall acting. Don't expect to see the Damon of the Bourne films or the sharp mouthed wit of Good Will Hunting...there is a memorable line delivered by Damon during dialogue with Danny Devito that's not to be missed; it screams volumes of the WASP elite culture. The cast is solid, the story a good one...and disturbingly believeable. Conspiracy theorists sensing a Skull & Bones Yalie behind every Government action will walk away nodding their heads. However, every actor in this film has given far better performances elsewhere. Unless you're obsessed with CIA or OSS, rent, don't buy.
1400063515|4.0|The Black Swan - The Impact of the Highly Improbable could have been titled The Black Swan - An Epistemic Fowl, but this might have impaired sales. Nassim Nicholas Taleb arrives at his erudite but not arrogant story after a childhood in war torn Lebanon, obtaining a Wharton MBA and years trading on Wall Street. He makes abundant use of these experiences as he weaves a complex story about the importance of these inadequately appreciated rare events to our increasingly quantified and specialized world.      His journey takes us from Plato to Popper, from Gauss to Mandelbrot and from errors of induction to errors of confirmation. An appreciation of epistemology (the philosophy of knowledge) is not required but will make the journey more enjoyable. He sets up a straw horse by showing the inadequacy of the Gaussian distribution to account for events which are several standard deviations from the mean and, therefore, are the events in which we have the least confidence.  He offers some hope by using a fractal (power series) model which allows him to transform some of his black swan intractable problems to tractable gray swan problems.  However, his analysis is non exhaustive and he does not consider non Gaussian models or discontinuous distributions.    We are left with an adequate argument against Gaussian quantitative models but with no replacement except the traditional qualitative narrative of boom and bust, creation and destruction which has been part of human culture for thousands of years.
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|I will typically go to a movie each week, and no matter how much I enjoy a new release, I rarely see the same one twice.  This is not the case with the Bourne Ultimatum.  I have been to three different theatres in San Francisco to see this movie and enjoyed it immensely each time.  Unlike \\"Memento,\\" where subsequent viewings reveal more plot elements and nuances, the Bourne Identity played the same to me all three times - it is just a flat out great action movie.  The dialogue to action ratio will please fans of the strictly action genre, but I would take nothing away from the plot, the writing, and the directing.  This is a \\"thinking person's\\" action movie.  In parts, you are almost grateful for the dialogue driven scenes so you can take a breather from the onslaught of great chases - by foot and by car - and the astounding choreography in the hand to hand fight scenes.  One final plug: this movie was not gratuitously violent so I was able to share my enjoyment of the Bourne Ultimatum with my 14 year old niece.
0143038583|3.0|This is a lively and readable book, but it loses points -- and credibility -- because of the hunting section. I know he's trying to fully-explore how humans get their food, but maybe in light of his very obvious discomfort with killing an animal like a pig, himself, he should have taken his perspective out of the book.<br /><br />For one thing, he says that he's like our Paleolithic ancestors just because he's hunting. With a high-powered rifle. In the age of modern medicine. If things go horribly wrong and he gets attacked by the pig -- which is a meat-eater, too -- there are ambulances, painkillers, casts, surgeons, and antibiotics. In contrast, the remains  of true Paleolithic humans show a spike in mortality rates at the point in the lifespan when males started hunting. Skeletal remains of males show unset, badly-healed bone breaks, bone abcesses, and untimely deaths from the dangers of hunting that simply do not exist for Pollan.<br /><br />And there's no way for Pollan to replicate the emotional impact because, for Pollan, hunting is an entirely optional act. Nobody he loves will go hungry if he makes no kill. Instead, there is the Marijuana Thing. Pollan talks about smoking pot before hunting the pigs. But on that hunt, he forgets to put a round in the chamber of his long gun. He is forgetful and focused on things other than hunting a pig. But all through that chapter, he extols marijuana and floats the idea that smoking pot helped the ancient hunters. He. missed. his. kill. Because he did. not. load. his. gun. Put down the bong and step away from the firearm. And let everyone in your hunting party know you're handling a firearm while high. I hope they tell you how dangerous that is.<br /><br />It is also in the hunting section that Pollan rationalizes the most. Yes, if we're eating meat, we are accomplices to the killing of animals. But let's not make anything more of hunting than that. Those of us who do not hunt do observe our environments. Hikers can tellwhat animals have passed by, and can observe the animals present and draw inferences about the environment there and what else might -- or might not -- be about. Hikers maintain a close connection to the environment for many reasons -- least of which is that sudden changes in climate can have severe consequences if we're not paying attention. We also don't make the mistake of thinking that wild animals are pets. They must be treated with respect and distance. It is possible to be quite at one with the world without having an intention to kill the animal.<br /><br />The book is a great read, but these flaws detract from it.That is certainly NOT the case with mushrooms. Or, if you are having symptoms, it may simply be too late. Some mushrooms have no symptoms until it's too late -- or maybe have symptoms over a day later. No one should eat wild mushrooms -- or indeed any wild plants -- without being accompanied by an expert.    The other caveat actually contributes unintentionally to humor in the book. Pollan all but comes out and says that he smoked marijuana prior to hunting the wild pigs. Perhaps a moral and sensitive man like himself needed to blunt his affect a bit before going and killing a social animal like the pig. Most of Pollan's prose in the book is good, workmanlike, journalistic prose. It does what writing is supposed to do. Sometimes it's better than that. The prose in this section is terrible. It's purple. It's over the top. He even says as much. He claims this is the effect of hunting. But similar claims have been made about cooking.    And he talks in this section not only about smoking pot, but about forgetting to put a round in the chamber of his gun, and other behaviors symptomatic of marijuana abuse -- forgetfulness, fogginess, lack of mental acuity. But all through it he exclaims about how marijuana might have helped the ancient hunters. Uh, maybe this is what happened to the Neanderthals: marijuana smoking dulled their wills, memories and hunting acuity, and they went extinct.     It is also in the hunting section that Pollan rationalizes the most. Yes, if we're eating meat, we are accomplices to the killing of animals. But let's not make anything more of hunting than that. Those of us who do not hunt do observe our environments. Hikers can tell what animals have passed by, and can observe the animals present and draw inferences about the environment there and what else might -- or might not -- be about. Hikers maintain a close connection to the environment for many reasons -- least of which is that sudden changes in climate can have severe consequences if we'renot paying attention. We also don't make the mistake of thinking that wild animals are pets. They must be treated with respect and distance. It is possible to be quite at one with the world without having an intention to kill the animal.    All in all, an excellent book.
B000P0J09W|5.0|Before I had a DVD player, I heard about the release of this excellent film on DVD. I had to have it when I discovered it included a commentary featuring all of the Goonies with the director. I begged and pleaded with my parents to get a DVD player so I could see it, and finally, my wish was granted.<br /><br />How could I be disappointed? The movie is fabulous. It is an adventure story and a teen movie mixed into one; it covers the coming of age theme and finding buried treasure at the same time. I know what you're thinking: \\"Rubies, and emeralds... and diamonds?\\" Yes! A group of kids who call themselve \\"The Goonies\\" are facing their last days in Astoria, Oregon. Their homes are being taken from them by a rich family who wants to extend their country club over the properties. Mikey (Sean Astin) and Brandon Walsh (Josh Brolin) are brooding in their home when Mouth (Corey Feldman), Chunk (Jeff Cohen), and Data (Ke Huy Quan) drop by. In their boredom, they decide to explore Mikey's dad's attic where he keeps all of the rejected museum items. There, they find a map showing where the kids can find pirate One Eyed Willie's buried treasure on the coast. Fueled by boredom and a need for money, the kids set out to find it. Brand tries to stop the boys, but consents to go along on the adventure when they meet up with Andie (Kerri Green) and Steph (Martha Plimpton). However, they run into trouble when they find that the place where the treasure is buried is also the hideout of the Fratellis, a group of murderous criminals. Filled with great scenes and great lines, (\\"I smell ice cream,\\" \\"That's my mom's most favorite piece,\\" \\"I'm setting booty traps!\\") you'll find yourself quoting this film and talking about it with everyone. It appeals to young and old alike.<br /><br />The extra features are great. Besides the commentary which adds a lot of insight into the hijinx behind the scenes, there are both parts of the Cindi Lauper \\"Goonies R Good Enough\\" music video, a short featurette with behind the scenes information, and three deleted scenes including the famed octopus scene. Even the main menu is beautifully done.<br /><br />I paid significantly more for this DVD than it is being listed for here, and it was worth what I paid for it and more.

The bloody fight scenes seem less bloody with the background on the rigid training to become a spartan warrior...the acting is great.

B000V8I2QU|4.0|\\"Magic\\" is almost certainly Springsteen's finest hour in 20 years.  He has always specialized in anthemizing everyday lives; listening, we can feel larger than life ourselves.  On his last E Street Band release, \\"The Rising\\" (2002), he tried to work that magic with the heroes and victims of 9/11.  But they had already been transfigured into legend by the events of that day, and so Bruce's lyrics actually abstracted them.  It was an honorable, wobbly record with a few fine songs.  With \\"Magic,\\" he's back to sketching lives of \\"the lost and lonely ones,\\" and despite their unmistakable (if unspecified) references to the second Iraq War, the songs work outside of any moment in time, as examinations of people coping with dread, powerlesness, grief, and the risks of feeling hope in dangerous times.  The E Street Band roars as eloquently as any Bruce fan would wish, and Brendan O'Brien, whose production on \\"The Rising\\" seemed to be in search of an identity, has found it here: dense, propulsive and bursting with life, even on two numbers that lean toward pop (they're achingly beautiful, like Pernice Brothers songs on steroids).  A couple of numbers aren't on a par with the rest, and I don't know if \\"Magic\\" will hold up in another 20 years as well as Springsteen's greatest albums have.  I do know that today, it sounds pretty damn fine.

B00007J4SI|5.0|When talking about Scriabin, of course, maturity is only a relative term. He died in 1915 at only 43 years old. He composed an extensive large collection of piano music. Scriabin was a very complicated person and his life is surrounded by many myths. He is known to only be able to compose after extreme intoxication or physical intimacy. Scriabin was able to express so many different emotions with his music from anger, fear and mystery to light, love and ecstasy. This 5 CD set allows us to hear his development as a composer. The very first piece on the set, the 3 Pieces op. 2, is one of my favorite pieces, the Etude in C sharp minor. These first 3 pieces were composed when he was only 15 years old. The second, a Prelude, gives a taste of things to come in its extreme beauty that Scriabin was able to capture in only 45 seconds. The third is an Impromptu whose melodic and harmonic style as well as the nature of the left hand accompaniment could almost have been lifted from a page of Chopin. Several of the earlier pieces show the influence of Tchaikovsky, and in the more virtuoso pieces, of Liszt. There could scarcely be a greater contrast between this music and the music from the end of Scriabin's life. From the early 1900's he began to be interested in matters divine and mystic, and as these preoccupations found their way into the music, the music became less immediately accessible, less melodic, and distant from what what others were composing at the time. Scriabin began to view the music he composed in the later years of his life as a sort of preparation for some huge project which would bring together his religious, mystic and musical philosophies. His death intervened, and we can never know how his very particular thinking might have developed, nor to what conclusions, musical or otherwise, he might eventually have been led by it all. The music of this period is characterized by new harmonies, based on the interval of the fourth, and mystic chords became associated with him. Fantasie in B Minor is typical of this period, at one moment somber and sad and then burning with a kind of diabolical energy at another.  One of my favorite pieces of Scriabin's music is the whole set of 24 Preludes, op.11. The Preludes in the black keys are the most interesting, especially Nos.13-18. Hardly two minutes in length, these short works take the pianist through the whole keyboard with cross hands, accentuating chords requiring all ten fingers to run across the black keys with great intensity. No.13, which starts off in a slow manner, is rich with sustained chords in the left hand and gliding arpeggios in the right which just end on a hanging note. The Preludes in some aspects have connections to Chopin's preludes. Scriabin's teacher was a student of Chopin. The influence is subtle but very real. Scriabin's desire to reach new heights surface in works like the Three Morceaux. The first work, Feuillet d album, is extremely slow and looks so playable to an inexperienced pianist. However, it is full of expression that extends beyond just the fingers and a lot of thought and feeling has to be put into playing it. Anyone interested in Scriabin's music definitely needs to get this set performed by Michael Ponti. It contains all of Scriabin's piano works except for the sonatas and a couple of other works that are also available from Vox Box on a 2 CD set.
B000002TQV|5.0|Over the past 3 generations, music industry executives (most with no or little musical education) have reduced the quality of popular music to the lowest common denominator.

The level of this Album's artistry is simply unsurpassed - even by RADIOHEAD themselves.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B000RJO578|5.0|I resisted watching this movie. I just assumed it would be an idiotic waste of time. I was so very wrong!<br /><br />This movie is about a relentless and highly successful London Police Officer (Nicholas Angel). He has a high arrest record and the other London Police say that \\"you're making us look bad.\\" So they transfer him up to a sleepy, beautiful town called Sandford - where there hasn't been a crime committed in years. Or so it would seem...<br /><br />Well, in the sleepy, peaceful town Nicholas finds that all is not what it seems. Viewers see the first of several grisly murders - that murder is then staged as an accident. The town is prepared to write it off as an accident, but Nicholas is not. Against his protests that the accident is no accident, but actually a murder, the head of the local police force refuses to see it as anything other than an accident.<br /><br />The plot then takes off relentlessly as Nicholas begins to untangle a web of deceptions. Mixed with the serious theme are so many genuinly funny scenes that this movie is more commedy than serious. At the end you will both cringe at some of the gory scenes and laugh at the same time.

B000E1YVZU|2.0|I've become a burgeoning Renthead, but I've never seen the musical yet. I listen to the soundtrack constantly. Actually my first experience with Rent was through this movie. I loved the songs and the music, but after seeing pics and some video of the original show, I came to the conclusion that Chris Columbus took Jonathan Larson's inspired work and made it so uninspiring.    His first mistake was to shoot on location or sets that look like New York. When you look at the set design of the musical, it was conceptual and abstract. If the set designers of the musical wanted to copy reality, they would have done that, but they realized that Rent (like many musicals) is a fable. Therefore the stylized abstract set works with the rock musical genre. The look of the movie is based on reality (they are singing in the streets and dancing in cafes). And because of that, it looks like every other musical or rock video set in New York. And other musicals, like West Side Story, do it so much better. And this is a shame because Rent was so fresh and different and this movie makes it seem so ordinary.    I'm not a filmmaker, but I think it would have been very interesting to shoot this musical with all of the actors against a bluescreen and then add a GCI conceptual stylized version of New York in the background. That way the environment of New York could look fresh and different, just like it did in the original musical.    Another aspect of the film that is so dissapointing is it's failure to carry the same emotional weight of the musical. Take for instance the scene when the cast is walking away from the funeral and begin arguing. This is one of the most emotionally charged scenes in the musical, the breakdown of this family of friends that we've come to love. How does Columbus handle this? He shows us a far establising shot with the friends walking through a cemetary. You can barely see their faces! And then he edits out the arguement/duet between Mark and Roger which was theconclusion of that emotional arc in the musical. Just like his two Harry Potter movies, Chris Columbus does not know how to bring out the emotional arc of a storyline.    The best part of this DVD was the No Day But Today documentary on the 2nd disc which tells the story of Larson and Rent. That was much more interesting and inspiring than the movie. And it is a shame because this was/is an innovative unique musical. There was nothing like it that came before and there has been nothing like it since, and this movie makes it seem so pedestrian.

0440238609|1.0|This trilogy was one of the most annoying works I have ever read. (And I have read a lot - I'm a retired English Lit teacher and adjunct professor.) The cosmology of this story is not only deeply, deeply flawed, it is inconsistent, ill-conceived and poorly conveyed. I felt that I was waiting in suspense for a overarching explanation that would clarify how it was that good was evil and evil was actually good, but I was left instead with a confused collection of twisted scenes from Paradise Lost that was obviously written by an author with a hatred of the Church and disdain for Christianity as a whole.<br /><br />I have read that Pullman considers himself an atheist, yet this is not the work of an atheist. Consider that the books require a cosmology that includes a God (the Authority,) His angels, and fallen (Rebel) angels. A true atheist isn't against God - that acknowledges God's existence. An atheist does not believe in a spiritual world at all.<br /><br />Pullman writes well at times, but many characters are flat and evoke little interest. His novum of visible animal souls is a creative stroke of genius - and I think a strong contender for why so many people are enamoured of the books. Pullman is, in the end, unable to pull it all together to create a world where there is a moral structure that works. He manipulates the forms well, brilliantly at times, but left me with a distinct empty feeling, and one of disatisfaction.<br /><br />These books are not for children, and I would question the appropriateness of providing them to children without some sort of guidance - again, these are not godless - as the Harry Potter novels have been acused of - these are books in which God is killed.<br /><br />Pullman is an artist, but his art is used to twist things so far that even his best efforts are incapable of connecting them again, and so this trilogy falls as flat as a Saturday morning cartoon that readily reveals that it's true goal is simply to sell toys to children, not to tell a story. Only Pullman isn't just selling harmless toys.man isn't just selling harmless toys.
B00005JPWF|4.0|For me, the only negative is that the film does drag a little at times, but I still never lost interest. The acting is very good here. Emile Hirsch is fantastic as the lead character and looks to have a promising career ahead of him. Vince Vaughn and especially Hal Holbrook are great supporting characters as well. The music (mostly by Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder) fits the movie like a glove. While sad and depressing at times, Into the Wild will either move you, or have you moving for the exits.<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars
B0001GL3K4|1.0|I guess the point of this movie was supposed to be Love Overload, sending women into an overdose of estrogen with every romantic turn.  Any one of these plots might have made an interesting movie, but each is chopped down into something about as substantial as a 30-second commercial.  Most romantic movies only ask you to endure one or two cheesy gimmicks, but by the time I saw a marriage proposal accepted between two people who barely knew each other at all, I had reached the end of my rope, and I realized that none of this was anything like real romance.    Without disdain, I can advise that if you're into the cutesy shmaltzy stuff then you may love this movie.  The actors are superb with what little they've been given.  (LIAM NEESON MARRY ME!!!)
1592332803|5.0|Being vegan, it's always difficult to find great cookbooks on baking.  This collection has everything all in one place from pastries to cookies, candies to pies!  Plus, mounds of information on the best egg-replacers, sweeteners, non-dairy milks, and other essential ingredients.  The opening chapter is a must-read for anyone wondering \\"why vegan\\" is a healthy & ethical choice.      And this book isn't just for vegans!  Anyone wuld enjoy these recipes - in fact, I've served many of these sinful treats to family & friends who had no idea they were eating \\"vegan\\" food until I told them.  I've already loaned this book to my mother who is not vegan but loves the chocolate brownier recipe.  Cutting cholesterol?  This is a great book of options, as well.    I can't recommend this book enough regardless your motivation - there are great recipes in here no matter how you slice it.
1400063515|5.0|More good ideas and quotes per page than any other book I've read recently. This is one of those books that presents a concept that in retrospect is perfectly obvious, but before the concept is properly presented, is well, highly improbable.     One of the key concepts reminds me of the geologic argument years ago between uniformitarianism (the processes operating today are the same that operated in the past) and catastrophism. In the Black Swan, Taleb poses the argument that the processes that today are not necessarily the processes that will operate in the future due to \\"unknown unknowns\\" -- highly improbable events that are not only impossible to forecast, but that have definite and very profound effects (drastically changing the future). After the fact we build a story to explain what was not only unexplainable but also inconceivable, as if it had always been (or should have been) obvious.     This is also a book, that once I finished reading it, I immediately realized I needed to read it again. The author's casual conversational style slides down easily, but I found the book so loaded with \\"aha\\" moments, it demanded rereading. It is also the first book since I finished post-grad work twenty years ago, where I've highlight key passages for my own reference.

1416523359|5.0|I never write reviews about the books I read here on amazon because it always seems as though others have written and the consensus would not be changed by my review.  Here, however, I was surprised to find the all the negative reviews.  I greatly enjoyed \\"Lisey's Story\\" for the same reasons others seemed to find it unbearable.  I have read just about everything Stephen King has written.  As a teenager, I enjoyed his earlier stuff because it was gorier and more bloodthirsty.  It was what I required after coming from reading mostly R.L. Stine and Christopher Pike.  Now that I am a bit older, I enjoy his newer stuff because it has heart as well as gore.  This story reminded me of \\"Bag of Bones\\" and gave me the feeling I had at the end of that story--they both deal with the inner as well as the outer.  Yes, the inner language of Lisey and Scott's marriage took time to work into, but I've been around couples before who have their own rich inner language and it makes one feel uneasy not to be part of it.  As soon as I felt part of that inner language (or could at least navigate around it), I enjoyed it.  My husband and I have our own fledgling language which puts the outsider at a disadvantage, so it was great to see something like that portrayed.  This type of inner language was also portrayed in the case of Lisey and her sisters (this includes her parents and grandparents) as well as with Scott and his father and brother (this was another complex relationship that was portrayed beautifully).    I was also surprised by the reaction to Lisey's behaviour and the opinion that this behaviour was not logical or believable.  To say that Lisey has to do what she does because the plot demands it is a ridiculous and belittling statement that could be made of any action that any character has ever taken in any work of literature.  A writer is always working with some kind of plot in mind so, of course, the characters must act in certain ways; it is only a matter of making those actions believable, which I think King does.  Also it is ironic that this charge is brought up at all, since King deals with that odd kind of reaction in his book.  \\"Reality is Ralph,\\" he says and that is exactly the case.  Truth is stranger than fiction as the cliche tells us and literature is supposed to mirror a reality that can be strange and alien.  I found Lisey to be a multi-dimensional character and I could empathize with her loss.  I don't think (as others have alleged) that the introduction of Boo'ya Moon was at all forced, as it had been eluded to several times earlier in the book.  I think it is childish to expect an author to come clean with all his tricks and plot twists at the beginning of the story.  \\"Lisey's Story\\" is complex and it does take work to get through it.  If you are looking for an easy read (something akin to sitting down and watching a show on television where it is not necessary to think), I would suggest a different book.  This is a book where emotions run deep, you experience loss, love, forgiveness, and, yes, horror.  This is a Stephen King book after all.

0374105235|5.0|A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier by Ishmael Beah is a moving, tortured yet uplifting story of Beah's involvement in war.<br /><br />Living in Sierra Leone, Beah was a typical 12-year old, playing soccer, dancing, singing rap music, reciting Shakespeare and hanging out with his friends.  Beah and a bunch of his buddies ventured to another town when civil war came to their village.  Not being able to make it back home, they were forced to flee--trying to find somewhere safe as well as a source of food.  Their goal was to avoid being captured or killed by the rebels.  Instead, they were discovered by the government army and turned into soldiers.  Some of these boys were so slight that they couldn't even hold the AK-47s they were given as weapons.  They were also given prodigious amounts of illegal drugs.  For three years, Beah served with the army until UNICEF removed him from military service.  During those three years, he was shot a number of times and escaped death repeatedly.<br /><br />While Beah's physical injuries healed, the psychological scars from the war tortured him for years.  He especially suffered from nightmares and migraines.  With the help of the staff of UNICEF and NGO, he not only healed enough to be \\"repatriated,\\" but he was also chosen as a representative to the United Nations First International Children's Parliament.  It was here that he met the woman who would become his surrogate mother, and arrange for his eventual escape from Sierra Leone.<br /><br />Ishmael Beah is a powerful, eloquent voice for the many children who were forced to become soldiers.  These children were robbed of their families, their limbs, their childhoods, and often, their lives.  After a nightmare, \\"I would try desperately to think about my childhood, but I couldn't.  The war memories had formed a barrier that I had to break in order to think about any moment in my life before the war.\\"<br /><br />I wish that Beah had gone into more detail about his journey to the United States.  Perhaps he's saving it for another book.  But even without this information, A Long Way Gone is an excellent book by a very young author.ps he's saving it for another book.  But even without this information, A Long Way Gone is an excellent book by a very young author.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I love the idea of communicating and falling in love via letters anyway, but the \\"two years apart\\" angle with a \\"magic\\" mailbox only makes me love it more.

The two stars have great chemistry in my opinion.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|For quite a long time, I never liked Stargate; but now, after seeing Atlantis, I realize that I was very wrong. Everything about this show is almost perfect--almost perfect acting, strong storylines, and incredible special effects!    First of all, the actors:    Joe Flanigan is great as John Sheppard; he gives the character a wry twist, somewhat like Jack O'Neill but a bit less ironic. Rainbow Sun Francks makes Aiden Ford likeable and goodnatured, but willing to take charge when needed. Torri Higginson is better at playing Elizabeth Weir than her SG-1 predecessor, although her character isn't very interesting until the 14th episode. Rachel Luttrell is calm, cool and collected as Teyla. And, of course, David Hewlett, as Rodney McKay, is both annoying, endearing, and hilarious! As for supporting actors, some of the best are Paul McGillion as Dr. Carson Beckett, David Nykl as Dr. Radek Zelenka, and Craig Veroni as Dr. Peter Grodin.    Each of the episodes are very well written. SPOILERS FOLLOW for anyone who hasn't seen them!    1: Rising. 10/10. This episode starts off the adventure very well, with Daniel Jackson figuring out the riddle of the Lost City. We get to see the city quietly hiding underwater and, even better, erupting upwards in a blaze of sunlight. Colonel Sumner's militaristic personality makes us appreciate Sheppard even more. We meet the Wraith, run away from the Wraith, and in the end realize that we haven't seen the last of them. It sets the stage for the stories to come.    2: Hide and Seek. 9/10. Very, very interesting. Of course, it's regrettable that the whole problem was started by some foolish kids, but otherwise it's great. The entire scene with Rodney and his personal shield is one of my favorites!    3: Thirty Eight Minutes. 10/10. This has a tense feel to it. Sheppard's strength is ever so slowly being sucked away by a hideous bug, but no one can help him because their 'shuttlecraft', the Puddle Jumper, is stuck in the Stargate! Tensions rise and, surprisingly, the whining Dr. Kavanaugh helps more than he hurts.     4: Suspicion. 7/10. Okay, but not one of my favorites. The constant mistrust of Teyla's people, the Athosians, in season 1 gets to be annoying.     5: Childhood's End. 9/10. This episode is pretty interesting, involving a group of children and some more Ancient meddling. Sheppard's team gets in trouble, but ends up unscathed.    6: Poisoning the Well. 7/10. The biggest problem with this episode is the fact that the Hoffans--a people who are willing to die uselessly in order to keep the Wraith away--are not the only stubborn ones in the Pegasus Galaxy. They totally refuse to find a better way to fight the Wraith, and that is quite frustrating.    7: Underground. 8/10. This episode introduces the Genii, militant people who pretend to be farmers and fool even Teyla. Although not one of the best Genii episodes, it's all-around strong, especially with Colm Meaney giving a great performance as Cowen, leader of the Genii.    8: Home. 9/10. The team finds a gate with a supposedly unlimited source of power and thinks they can use it to go back to the Milky Way, but of course problems arise. Surprisingly, this episode is not quite as predictable as you might think! Near the end you slowly begin to realize just what's going on, but throughout the entire episode, you're fully in the dark.    9: The Storm. 10/10. This is one of the best episodes in the series so far. A giant storm threatens Atlantis--they begin to prepare--but they'll have to fight off the Genii first! Rodney and Dr. Zelenka come up with a great way to temporarily defend the city, and Commander Kolya is introduced. A wonderful episode.     10: The Eye. 10/10. The conclusion to The Storm, this is another stellar episode. We see what happens to the city and its inhabitants, and face the Genii. Thankfully, they didn't give the storyline a weak conclusion.    11: The Defiant One. 10/10. In this episode, we first see the Ancient Defense Satellite that's featured later on. On the planet below, a single Wraith has survived for ten thousand years and silently waits... Very nerve-wracking and, in a way, sometimes annoying (i.e. the Wraith figuring the Puddle Jumper out in seconds). Rodney's line to Sheppard: \\"What are you, Captain Kirk?\\" Great!    12: Hot Zone. 10/10. One of, if not the best, episodes of season 1. A contagion is released inside Atlantis and is almost impossible to stop. We get quite a bit of foolishness from Dr. Weir, however, who refuses to sensibly deal with a situation, making Sheppard eventually have to disobey orders in order to resolve it. Thankfully, that doesn't take away from the adventures in this episode.    13: Sanctuary. 8/10. An interesting concept, but not so great in the end. After a while, the Ancients lose their luster--stupidly refusing to destroy the Wraith and punishing those Ancients who try to. It doesn't help that the entire episode goes by without the Atlantis team gaining any allies or getting a safe haven to evacuate to.    14: Before I Sleep. 10/10. Finally, a Dr. Weir episode that deepens her character! It's too complicated to say much about, but in the end we finally respect and appreciate Elizabeth. A wonderfully complicated time-travel concept helps to add the sci-fi.    15: The Brotherhood. 8/10. Sadly, this episode is just like Sanctuary. It leaves Atlantis with absolutely nothing, all because of Rodney's big mouth. In a way, it's slightly frustrating.    16: Letters from Pegasus. 10/10. This episode is both escapist and intense. Teyla and Sheppard try to rescue some of the former's friends from the Wraith, while everyone else records messages to send to SGC in a quick data-burst. It shows a hidden side of everyone, which helps to deepen their characters drastically.    17: The Gift. 9/10. A secret is revealed, and Teyla becomes even more valuable--in a way. This episode serves to give us more information on her and her people, so it's good to watch.    18: The Siege, Part One. 10/10. A wonderful, tense, horrific, and dazzling episode. The Wraith finally come to Atlantis, despite the efforts of Peter Grodin, an intelligent and likeable British doctor, who's regrettably killed when the Wraith destroy the Ancient Defense Satellite. No one knows if they'll survive, and there seems to be no hope.     19: The Siege, Part Two. 10/10. Just as good as Part One. A group of Marines show up from SGC, bearing somewhat good news, but in the end it seems that even they won't be good enough to stave off the Wraith. It leaves you nervous and very impatient for Part Three!    All in all, Stargate Atlantis is one of the best sci-fi shows I've ever seen. Even if you've never seen SG-1, you should try to get this. You definitely won't be disappointed.
159102594X|5.0|I picked up The Blade Itself with a pile of other fall evening reading.     I began and by ten pages in found myself unwilling to spare the time to eat. Normally one or two characters capture my fancy and I accept the others as necessary to the unfolding of the tale. Here though I found them ... gripping, puzzles full of surprising twists and insights and turns of phrase.     When it ended, I went to my computer and ordered the second volume from England. As soon as it arrived I stopped all else and began Before They Are Hanged. Now that too is done. I long for volume 3.    I do not begrudge simple heroes their time. Those who wallow in self-induldgent angst hold no charm for me. The folk of these tales are are neither. I do not know if I like them but I do know I want more. As much as I can get.
0553805460|1.0|I just finished this book and was really, really disappointed.  The only reason I read it is because it was supposed to be considered as a movie by Martin Scorsese, as it touted on the back of the dust jacket.  Apparently Leonardo DiCaprio would play runt Jordan Belfort, and Terrence Winter (Sopranos) was set to write the screenplay.<br /><br />A blurb in \\"Daily Variety\\" (March 26th, 2007) claimed \\"Like 'Catch Me if you Can', 'Wolf' would be a two-hander with a key part for a second star: Much of the film would hinge on Belfort's relationship with the FBI agents who tried to make him an informant.\\"  There was maybe one paragraph devoted to this.  Instead of a suspensefull Wall Street cat-and-mouse as I expected, The Wolf of Wall Street is simply a diary of debauchary, a one-sided confessional by pathetic Belfort.  He comes off so incredibly dislikable, has nothing good to say about anybody, and in the end rats out all those who were loyal to him just to save his skin.  He claims he did so to keep his gold-digging ex-wife from indictment, but that logic is never explained.  It's so obvious he squealed to save himself.  There's nothing heroic, or interesting, about a rat, especially a drug addict rat.<br /><br />Scorsese/DeCaprio making this book into a film astounds.  He already made \\"The Departed\\" about informants within Boston's Irish mafia.  At least that story had life-or-death consequences.  The last shot is of a rat so that theme has already been explored in his films.<br /><br />With Great Gatsby Leonardo is going to be in back-to-back movies playing rich guys in suits.  How about someone we can relate to Leo?  Take a page from the roles Ben Affleck chooses.<br /><br />Like the thousands of Belfort's victims, the Stratton Oakmont and other investors, I feel cheated (albeit I got off only losing the price of this lame book, plus the time it took me to read it)<br /><br />Ni doubt the publisher will paperback this with release of movie and Belfort will host numerous talk shows, but this should be in the bargain bin.
