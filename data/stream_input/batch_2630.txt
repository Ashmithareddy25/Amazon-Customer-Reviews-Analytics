B00CX1TSSO|5.0|great movie no matter what age if you like animated this is awesome I bought it and will watch it again we have seen it twice but I cant wait to see it again
B0002Y4T92|5.0|I guess this is a product review. the seller was excellent and the used product (2-DVDs) was in perfect condition. I am not a huge fan of eric Clapton but I do enjoy jj cale and Clapton admires him so I guess that is okay. is he playing at this festival? james taylor is always a hoot; he has a good sense of humor, sings good blues, and I can't spell accoppella. Webster can: &#34;a cappella&#34;. poor joe walsh b-4 he got sober doesn't play very well; but hey joe, good for you... :)
B0081336FO|5.0|The acting is great. The Sherlock and Watson characters warm your heart. The plots are exciting. There is a good mix of drama, intrigue, and humor. I love the way the clues are often written on the items being noticed by Sherlock as he looks at them. He often lists the clues he sees to explain how he came to a particular conclusion. It challenges me to try to be more observant.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|Anne & Jake are great together. Great chemistry I very much enjoyed the movie.<br />I have photographed them both many times and they are great to work with which<br />you can't sat about all actors. Also a great chick flick.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|this cd is excellent I haven't stopped listening to it since I got it. welcome back ozzy. hope you come to la soon so I can see the concert woo hoo
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I'd wanted to watch this movie for a long time. I thought I'd love it. I love Spielberg and his knack for telling history. I love history. But I found that while I like and enjoy this movie, I didn't quite love it.<br /><br />Maybe Lincoln is too iconic a figure, but Daniel Day Lewis never quite seemed to fit the man's admittedly large shoes. I think he's got the looks down, but the voice is a bit to light for me. Maybe it's historically accurate, but nothing about the voice says \\"authoritative\\" to me. Sometimes this works to actually humanize Lincoln a bit better. It's nice to see our greatest president depicted as human and not a myth. Lincoln does some very human things in the movie.<br /><br />Many have complained that the film is slow. While I normally have no patience for the movie tastes of today's ADD/hyperactivity generation, I do think there's something to this. I think part of the problem is that the film often seems to be going from one \\"HUGELY IMPORTANT SIGNIFICANT MOMENT\\" to the next. Whether it's Lincoln telling yet another story or Stevens speaking in Congress, it feels like every moment is drawn out and important. Individually, many of the scenes are really worth taking in. But together the viewer gets the sense that the movie is going nowhere fast. There are no scenes of frantic bustling in the House of Representatives to give the impression of the passage of time or things getting done. Rather, we hear the vote of nearly every single representative on the amendment, which was a bit much. In short, it's slowness without substance.<br /><br />The movie was adapted from a book (Doris Kearns Goodwin's famous \\"[[ASIN:0743270754 Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln]]\\") and it shows. There are dozens of smaller scenes scattered throughout the movie with little to no context. One of Lincoln's sons, Robert, went off to enlist in the war. We never got to know him beforehand, but it's made into a big deal. Then, afterwards, we never see him again. It seems like Spielberg thought it was an interesting scene but it doesn't fit with the story and never gets introduced or resolved. There are a few other scenes, such as the assassination and Lincoln's inaugural, that really have little to do with the passage of the 13th amendment. I'd say this movie could have been streamlined into a much tighter and more compelling story.<br /><br />Again, I really like this movie. It works more often than not. But I can also understand how it didn't win best movie Oscar for 2013.
B00CEMH31Q|4.0|its good/decent album hanson made. i would rate this album a 9. there some good and decent songs on the album. i like the songs Fired Up,get the girl back,juliet,and cut right through me.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It's not often that I say that a movie is better than the book upon which it was based. But Life of Pi takes what I thought was a simple and unemotive book and creates a visually stunning and emotionally evocative movie.<br /><br />As other reviews are noted, this movie is a visual masterpiece. Ang Lee injects the film with a bold and unique visual style. There's rarely a boring frame in this movie. There's always an interesting composition or lighting effect on the screen. That's no small achievement given that the story primarily takes place on a small boat with a single actor and a CGI tiger. I'm not often wowed by special effects, but some of the shots from underwater really were impressive.<br /><br />I think Ang Lee and actor Suraj Sharma did a great job at drawing the emotional story out of this book. As I wrote in my review of the novel, the writing style is a bit dry and doesn't really evoke any emotions. However, Suraj Sharma's narration adds real depth to his character. He's not just telling viewers how he caught fish, but also conveying his grim determination to survive. I'm sure it's easier for live actors to convey emotion than it is for words on a page, but I found myself caring far more about the characters in the movie than I ever did in the book.<br /><br />The movie is very faithful to the book. Perhaps surprisingly so. Ang Lee even kept the part in about Pi's conversion to Christianity and Islam. Again, I thought this was an improvement over the book. I thought the book spent far too much time in the beginning with random musings. The movie presents the same information but much more efficiently and beautifully.<br /><br />Overall, I'd imagine this movie will please fans of the book, as well as any viewers who appreciate a good yarn. Even if you didn't care for the book, I strongly suggest you give this a try.
0307887960|2.0|I will start off by saying I did NOT try the diet; the review is on the book and the info it contains.  I had high hopes for this, and believe  that people probably do lose weight on it (I have no way of checking that).  I would like to compare it 'slightly' to Atkins; yes, there are similarities.  It is high-protein & ketogenic.  There is a sort of 'induction' phase.  That can last 1-10(?) days.  He was VERY vague on that point, and several others, IMO.  Is it one day or a week?  Big difference.  Also, there are no height/weight charts, no real idea of what your &#34;true&#34; weight is supposed to be (he infers your body will just 'know.').  How will it know?  I am supposed to go along in step 2 until I reach my ideal weight, but I have NO CLUE what that is supposed to be!<br /><br />Other things jumped out at me like red flags, which made me doubt his science or legitimacy.  For example, there are NO veges allowed in the first (of four) phases, and very few in the second phase.  That can be months of your life with very little vitamins.  He just adds in some weird oat cake daily.  No substitutions on this--eat the oats!  Why would you think greens and low-sugar vegetables are taboo, but add in grains???  I get the need for fiber (he does talk about the expected constipation [oh, joy], but says to drink more water and take medications for that.  And eat the oat cake.<br /><br />Another MAJOR issue is his restriction of fats to the point of craziness.  This is dangerous, and you can google lots of info on something called 'rabbit sickness.'  I guess if one consumes vast quantities of protein w/ no real carb and no fat, it can cause such havoc in your body that many people have died from it.  You can apparently live on nothing but fat (as the Inuits do--yuk!) and be fine, but all protein & no fat is horribly dangerous.  For a doctor to recommend this seems unethical.  Again, there is research out there, esp. from the Colonial times where it WAS killing people.  And all fat is bad to him except salmon, but avocado & nuts are off limits.  ?????<br /><br />Dr. Dukan also not only permits diet soft drinks, he encourages them, even in the case of pregnant women!  (Is there anyone who thinks aspartame is good for an unborn child?!  Seriously.)  Finally, the diet makes it SEEM like once you get the weight off, you can eat whatever you want in life except for 1 day per week.  Reading in depth, however, he infers you can't do that & maintain low weight; you will need to stick to level 3 most of the time & have treats now & then.  It just felt, for me, like a big lie from what he espouses, but in the fine print, so you might miss that point.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure that regardless of high carb/no fat to high protein/low carb, just about everyone from Dean Ornish to Dr. Atkins himself regard vegetables as 'the more, the better.'  They are filled with vitamins and phytochemicals, as well as fiber & water.  I think most weight loss experts would also recommend staying far, far away from aspartame & other yucky chemicals, in the name of health.<br /><br />My opinion:  I won't be trying this b/c it is important to me to 1) make choices based on nutrition, not just weight loss.  I want to be full of vibrant health, not full of weird chemicals;  and 2) I want to teach my child about healthy eating and steer her away from bad things.  I think this diet WOULD work for a short term event (wedding, reunion) where you need to be diligent, but the weight probably will drop off.  I do not see how someone could maintain this forever, and question some of his suggestions.  I would rather go back to Atkins or Zone, where the emphasis is on health.all fat is bad to him except salmon, but avocado & nuts are off limits.  ?????<br /><br />Dr. Dukan also not only permits diet soft drinks, he encourages them, even in the case of pregnant women!

B00992CF6W|5.0|Its awesome sure it doesn't have an infinite world like pc  edition but it's still awesome. Get it if you have enough money they updated it to having milk egg cake buckets and non hostile mob spawners it's Avery good game.
B00BX3KZAS|3.0|Yes, I own every album. No, this does not dethrone the greats. Yes, this album is worth listening to. No, this album is not what it could have been.<br /><br />There, I said it.<br /><br />After listening to this album, you can tell the COB boys are tired. Its been many years of swearing and hanging with the reaper. Somethings gotta give. Maybe they just cant hate like they used too? Maybe their just a little too old for the same old ****. Will I dis this album? Why would I? Some of these tracks are exactly what I want/expect from COB. A few others are just hungover ideas from some wild parties.<br /><br />What else can I say? Its not perfect. Its not terrible. They do their name justice on a few tracks. A few others, I can live without. As a true COB fan tried and true, I wont abandon a band I've seen live 8 times. These guys are masters of the genre they basically pioneered. That's all that needs to be said. Listen to it. Judge it for yourself. I'm sure you can find some old Hate Crew in a few of these tracks, just like I did.<br /><br />Till next time,<br /><br />Pixxle
B000VSAEYI|5.0|I bought this pool through another website but I have to rave about it! My daughter loves this pool...it is big enough for two grown adults and my two year old to relax it while she plays. The slide is awesome too!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day is one of my favorite authors.  I love the crossfire series and am looking to read more of her stuff.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Simply put, I love it.  It's everything I hoped for and more.  When an iconic front man leaves, it really puts the spotlight on the contributions of the rest of the best.  I've loved Queensryche from their first album, but I'm also one of those who felt like some was missing after DeGarmo left and as much as I tried with each new album--there were some good songs, but they never left me amazed like the early material.  Could this really still feel like Queensryche?  With this new release, the band has demonstrated that the creative forces that put Queensryche on the scene did not leave with the front man.  They are alive, well, and... no doubt, this band is Queensryche.  The magic is back.<br /><br />First, let me say that this band, once again, feels like the early Queensryche I fell in love with and yet everything is revitalized.  There is new energy but with a precision of a bunch of seasoned musicians who know what they are about.  It's rare you find the energy and the experience that stands out in the these new tracks.  I could never imagine anyone replacing Tate as a vocalist, but Todd LaTorre is the real deal.  There is no compromise in his vocal.  He's was made to sing this material and again, brings his own energy and creativity to the sound.<br /><br />Congratulations guys... Queensryche could have crumbled into a legal debacle.  Tate's doing his own thing (and there are some good tracks on his FU album), but these guys simply made their case by putting out an amazing album, start to finish.  Just brilliant.  Let the music speak for itself.
B008JFUPFI|4.0|As for aesthetics, Man of Steel boasts a star-studded cast, a hunky new S man, plus imaginative sets and wardrobe. My teenager thought this film was the best superhero movie he has seen - to offer a different demographical viewpoint. There is more action and less romance than previous shows on Superman for sure. Overall, I thought it was pretty good, though a number of scenes felt contrived, awkward, and even a little hokey. The story was re-imagined, I just wish that some of the formulas had been as well.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|The Orphan Master's Son is a wonderful read -- the plot, imagery, and techniques are fascinating. It has been a long time since I have enjoyed a book this much.

B00992CF6W|5.0|It's fun and I recommend it. You should get it but it is a little expensive . I love it anyway
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great thought provoking game.  Each room a little harder than the last.  Looking forward to the addition of more rooms.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|Loved this movie, originally brilliant. Keeps you thinking and wondering all throughout the film. Watch it and you will see how this movie does not have a typical plot and will make you think and smile.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|I heard the cut &#34;Hold On&#34;  and I wanted to check this group out. The CD is good, the production quality is okay and there are several tunes that have some punch to them.
B00CMYRSQG|5.0|I have been listening to this album for a few months now. At first I was listening for Leveler, Constellations.<br />So that being said I was not hearing what I wanted!<br />I forget their other albums and now I am just listeing to this for what it is.<br />I love it.<br /><br />Like all the other albums this one grew on me.<br />It is beautiful and it is amazing!<br /><br />I am going to write my honet review on this album. I have listened to this twice now!<br />First off it is awesome just like all there alums.<br />I love there albums Constellations, Messengers, Home and Leveller. I love that stuff. At first I just like the whole screamo aspect but as time went on I started to truly enjoy it. It grew on me and I loved it more and more. It is now the music I can listen to and love always. I do not get that with all bands.<br /><br />Another band that did this to me was Brian Head Welch solo album Save me from my self. Most of Demon hunter did this. I can always listen to there music and love it every time.<br /><br />This album. I enjoy and I am sure as time goes on I will fall in love with it.<br /><br />One last thing I wanna say. People say to me, heavy metal is not music. For some reason any other genre is music but scream is not? Why not, it is compiled of notes just like any other style of music.<br /><br />I love it, August Burns Red just ditch scream, distortion, low tuned guitar and start playing melodious relaxing beauty! One of the songs on this album half way through, a violin rips out and it is just amazing. They do this on there other albums to. I love all styles of music and when they play this calmed music. It is like saying, yeah in your face narrow minded people. We can play other styles, flawless!<br /><br />They are extremely talented

B007PM218K|5.0|This movie is about a little history of the United States and the Depression and what happen during the Dust Bowl in Kansas by over cultivating the soil!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game. It really makes you think. You have to think so hard that I have been stuck on the level with the red car and the weights and the ship with the numbers under the dresser for 4 days. Can not for the life of me find the last weight or figure out the numbers below the ship. Other then that I love it.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|I downloaded this app as a back-up alarm after a recent storm knocked out the power and I couldn't find my cell phone (had left it at the office). It's a straightforward alarm and it works exactly as advertised. If you have songs installed on your Fire (not on the Cloud) you can use those songs as your alarm ringtone. Otherwise, you select from a limited but functional set of ringtones.
B0094M2X6Y|5.0|This is a great movie that is very entertaining and funny that follows a classic book. Highly recommended family movie.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I'm partial to this app because I love sharks. Hungry Shark Evolution is a cute animated app that lets you play a shark. You start with a reef shark, and evolve into stronger forms of shark. I'm currently at the Hammerhead.<br /><br />Your shark swims along looking for food. Your health bar depletes the longer you go without eating. You earn experience and get achievements for various things, like eating a fisherman off of his boat, swimming into the surge to snatch a swimmer off the beach, or eating so many of a certain type of fish in so many seconds. Your shark can't eat everything that comes along, however. Some items are only edible to certain types of sharks. And of course, some things will try to eat you. There is also generally silliness to be had, as the beach owners apparently plan mines in the water to stop you and, as you evolve, start sending things like torpedo boats after you!<br /><br />The game is designed to either use the touch screen to move your shark or simply tilt the screen back and forth to move it. But I've found trying to navigate the maps just tilting the Kindle too problematic, particularly when trying to avoid obstacles.<br /><br />Its a fun game except for the fact that it crashed by Fire twice. These weren't just temporary freeze-ups, but full crashes (though it has frozen up several times as well). That is the type of thing that will prevent me from spending real money on a game. An unstable interface that crashes my device doesn't earn my confidence. If the game was more stable, I'd probably be willing to spend a few dollars a month on upgraded items for my sharks. As it is, for now my sharks will have to manage without any add-on toys.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|i felt this series got better as it went on....more of a plot.  Very quick and enjoyable read.  would recommend it.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This game is awesome. Very fun way to kill time when you are bored. I would d definitely recommend downloading.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a good book to read. The story keeps you wanting more. I'm glad I started to read this series. You'll enjoy it also.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|though i'm excited for a fourth book, i really thought we would wrap up their love story in this book.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|As much as I loved the book, I HATED the way it ended.  I was hoping to get a little farther along in their relationship.  Can't wait for the next book to come out.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|It was good and had some hot and heavy parts....but it was just missing that excitement and drama of the first two. Luckily this is kind of a middle book...so I assume it fits it's role properly. Hoping the next two in the series have some more drama and plot twists. Nevertheless, the characters are still awesome and have a deep and powerful romance.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|How sad I am that I have come to the end of this trilogy.<br />I am still smiling as I so quickly reminicse about some parts of this story.<br />  Words that made me cry, gasp, cringe, smile and sometimes I actually turn away as if that would change the words I have just read into ones less ghastly.<br />Totally captivated.<br />Stressed because the characters were so slow to do what I knew was coming.  Stressed because at times the action was over so quickly I had to read it again to make sure it happened.<br />Would I recommend this series?<br />Yes.  But I know tonight I will sleep hearing a hiss .....<br />Katnisssssssssss.......
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Hope to see those guys getting Angry Birds success.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I spent a long time searching through headphone reviews, and there were always a few people who really hated any given headphone, even the models at $150+ in price.<br /><br />This meets all of my needs without being too expensive.  The sound is great!  For everyday use of listening to music and playing games, these headphones are awesome.<br /><br />The downsides are that the bass power is average (but crisp and clear), and you can get a little hot around the ears when wearing them for a while.

034580404X|1.0|I started reading the first book, and thought it had too many similarities to the film \\"Secretary\\". The film stars James Spader as Mr. Grey (yes, he was the first Mr. Grey), and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Lee Holloway. Lee is young and naive. She and her boss, Mr. Grey, embark on a BDSM relationship. It has a great story; great acting, writing, directing,character development, very erotic, romantic, funny, etc. I HIGHLY recommend this movie if you have an interest in these books. This happens to be my favorite movie of all time. I first saw it in 2005, and fell in love with the characters and their story!
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|very intense movie...feels like you are there a the resort. Realist movie with a great ending to it.  Liked alot
B00821OX98|5.0|Something about starting any story with the 'aftermath' ..... I did not realize I was watching the 1st episode ..... OK, whatever. I did like what I watching ... As I kept watching; I was intrigued and the story line did captivate my attention .... so much that I watched all of season 1 in 2 days and season 2 in the next 2 days ..... For me Falling Skies is worth watching. I am a woman of few words --- AND --- how rare is that! :)
B00A23MYCC|5.0|It's pure comedy for laughs giggles and dang! Mark Walberg is hilarious, this is a movie my hub and I can watch over and over again.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Very good reading, I don't give it a 5 because<br />it is too much like other stories, like other<br />happenings in the world. It is missing some<br />surprises or unexpected happenings.<br />Very good read
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book because it showed suspense and emotion that sort of connects to me.<br /> I recommend this book to people that enjoy books that make you want to keep reading

B0032UYFA6|5.0|This is one of the best shows I've seen. To bad they are ending it. It could go on for years.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If i had to sum up this game in two words they would be; fun, and addicting. I also love how you can personalize your horse and yourself.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's just awesome ok me get it it may cost slot but worth it<br /><br />ITS AWESONE U CAN PLSYBWITH O YT? HER PEOPLE
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|it's  a good game but if you pause or stop the game you lose all lives.  buying lives is to expensive just wait for them to replenish. to many hesitations during the game
0525478817|5.0|I think the book perfectly described the \\"coming to life\\" of all the characters. I lived the plot and I don't expect what happen near the end. The characters were funny and interesting. The beginning of the book, was intriguing and had me addicted and I could not put the book down. I loved every part of it. I highly recommend this book to anyone, at any age.
1603427244|5.0|Instructions are really easy to follow, especially if you are a beginner like I am.  I was able to find a Bind Off that I wanted to use & follow the instructions to finish my project with ease.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|This game is awesome it's not a bad game all the people who think it is bad must not have played it that long.GET IT.IT'S AWESOME
B007L5KT76|5.0|This is another wonderful RDJ film. It has<br />Interesting plot twists, and just when you think you know what will happen the whole plot changes. I loved it and give it 5 stars.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I usually like Sophie Kinsella but I wasn't crazy about this one.  It got a little repetative with the problems Lottie & Ben had with their wedding night.  I didn't find either Lottie or Fliss very likable.  But the situations were funny.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved the game....challenging!  Had to let close sometime to then have different perspective.  I hope new room updates will be available soon!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Addicting! Only wish you could name your horse something you choose. This is fairly realistic for as hard to depict as horses are.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is soooo much fun. You can't get bored with this game. It's age appropriate for 2 and up. It also changes locations were they run every 23 days atleast. U SHOULD TOTALLY GET THIS GAME!!
B003YL4L0W|5.0|I enjoyed this emotional story, very well written.  Always a good reminder that things are not necessarily what they appear to be.  Definitely worth a read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's a great series...from the sets, costumes, the cast.  The storyline never tires.  I have watched it several times over.  Great historical fiction come to life.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Its a fun game yes, but no matter what it wont let me connect to my facebook. my Internet is fine but it still wont connect to my facebook!!!! :(
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Hinton Blitz is one of my favorite games.  Highly addictive, this fast paced (no pausing) pits you against a roomful of other players from around the globe.  A common entry in the Chat area is GL FROM _____, with the abbreviation GL meaning Good Luck.  Players win prizes in each room that that oncecollected can be traded for other prizes or cashed out once the collection is complete for playing credits.  This Hinton game also includes power ups that can assist by daubing extra numbers or granting access to a treasure chest which might yield additional power ups, game credits or extra bungle cards.  Great game that promotes teamwork with administrators that keep the chat appropriate and safe for kids.
B003R1B9MW|5.0|This real life sports movie about golfer Francis Ouimet had an engaging personal storyline with beautiful cinematography and wonderful musical score.  One of the best sports movies made.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers from the daily challenges the missions I especially love the way they travel around the world world like Tokyo and Paris ....... it is just amazing very on should get it
B0060MYKTY|5.0|Since the very first season this stories had catch my eye, I can't wait to get the third season I love it
B007ZI06FE|4.0|This was my first foray into &#34;steampunk&#34;-I actually had to look up what the heck it was because I was a bit confused when I started reading it.  That being said, if you can get passed Victorian Era meets cyborg, and I did, the book was great.  I thought the plot kept it entertaining while at the same time weaving the beginning of an interesting series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is the best game I have played in a very long time. it has a good balance between mentally challenging and solvability
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed this game. Keeps you engaged. Everything is a clue. Once I understood how the rooms and clues worked, I was able to open doors fairly quick. I wanted to give 5 stars, but I was a little disappointed there were only 10 rooms. I wanted more!
B005PK1G76|4.0|It's a good console. Fits the city mini stroller by baby jogger nicely. Good price too. What else can I say?
1582701709|5.0|So far this book is awesome and is helping me change the way I think everyday! Shipping was fast and the book is in great condition!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|THIS BOOK LEFT ME WANTING MORE.  THE WRITING OF SYLVIA DAY MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE ONE OF THE CHARACTERS.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK......WHEN IS THE NEXT ONE COMING OUT?
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I listen to TED talks a couple times a week and always find something inspiring, funny, informative and useful. Some days I start my day with a TED talk to avoid the negative news in the general media. I'm a late comer to the TED community and I'm glad I found it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games is, without a doubt,  a very gripping book with such a wonderful display of events and emotions. Everything planned in the making of this book is layed out carefully, almost flawlessly. So creative, so dark. It was written well.<br />However, I feel as if something is lacking from making The Hunger Games an exceptional, incredible book.<br />It is a very great read though and I enjoyed it a lot.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|The transaction was as it should always be: quick and easy. And definitely a good quality product. Would buy again. Completely satisfied
B006TTC54A|5.0|Having grown up in the Chicagoland area, there are a lot of familiar sites in this movie for me. I've been a Blues Brothers fan since they hit the scene back in the day, and I laugh out loud dozens of times every time I watch this movie. The scene where Jake and Elwood pilot the Blues Mobile through the crowd of \\"Illinois Nazis\\" - causing them to scatter like frightened cockroaches - is a scene I watch two or three times each viewing. Lots of celebrities in this movie, some in places where you least expect them; like Steven Spielberg's cameo appearance as the clerk at the Cook County Assessor's Office at the end of the movie. I've watched this movie dozens of times over the past 33 years, only to realize who that was just recently. There's always something new I've never seen before each time I watch this movie. Enjoy!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I thought this was a great love story, but also a great story about a woman recovering from and overcoming an abusive relationship.  As I read, I thought women really go through this type of abuse and it was good to read a story where the woman was able to break free and eventually live a god life.  I thought the movie should have stayed true to the book to show her strength and selflessness in the face of danger.<br /><br />I do think Julianne Hough was a good choice actress based on the character in the book and of course, you can never go wrong with Josh Duhamel.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Because I saw an article in a magazine that said if I liked Fifty Shades, I'd like this trilogy.  Well, the magazine was wrong.  It's not that the book is awful, it just wasn't as good as Fifty Shades (not in content or fluidity).  It seemed to be a lot going on in the book, but with no conclusions (spoiler alert).  I really didn't care for Eva and all of her worrying, seemed unnecssary when Gideon was written to be the type of man that took care of business.  I also didn't care for the constant repeating how they were each other's soulmates and could just read each other without speaking words.  Not saying that those relationships don't exist it just seemed to be filler that wasn't really necessary.  I thought, ok I get it they were made for each other. I guess I can conclude my review by saying if you got through the first two books, you can get through this one, but I can't say you'll be satisfied with the ending or that you'd purchase a fourth book....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am just in love with this game. I can never put it down. It is great game for any age.
0062255657|5.0|THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE is a gorgeous book. From the perfect cover to the very last page Gaiman depicts a lush story about agelessness, childhood fears and memory.<br /><br />We meet our intrepid protagonist driving towards his childhood home after leaving a funeral. He isn't driving anywhere in particular and after a bit he finds himself driving down an old country lane to a house he vaguely remembers. At the Hempstock Farm old memories begin to surface.<br /><br />During his childhood his family's car is stolen and a man commits suicide in it not far from his home. This unleashes a darkness and our narrator (whose name we never learn) soon finds himself involved with the Hempstocks in trying to contain it. He quickly finds himself becoming friends with the youngest Hempstock - an eleven year old named Lettie.<br /><br />Lettie and our narrator begin to investigate what got out when the thief committed suicide and it quickly becomes clear to the both of them that there is now something out there that does not belong in our world.<br /><br />Gaiman does a masterful job of giving the novel a distinctly growing sense of horror as the forces unleashed begin to wreak havoc on the narrator's life. What's even more impressive is the masterful job Gaiman does of never letting this feel like a young adult novel even when the two main characters are both under the age of twelve.<br /><br />This is an extremely emotional novel and an extremely hard one to review as to give away any more of the plot than I already have would, in my opinion, kill the enjoyment of reading THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE. This is a book to take out on the porch and savor and I can't wait till I have time to read it again.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Got hooked on the TV series. The books are just as compelling although I'm glad I saw the TV series first - helps to keep track of who's who and visualize the characters.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love this series; however, only gave 4 stars because the author decided to stretch the book further...I really thought this was the last one. I waited a year for this to finally release and I'm disappointed I have to wait longer to see what happens next....
1843106698|5.0|Hi All & Hi all fellow Aspies.<br /><br />To quote another reviewer, if there is to be one book, let it be this one. It's the book that kept me sane when I self diagnosed in november 2008. It helped me ask the right questions. I now would like to sidetrack this review for what I feel is an important missing link for people who like me mostly suffer from the depression that often follows on the coattails of Asperger's Syndrome.<br /><br />I like to start by mentioning another book, Alone Together: Making an Asperger Marriage Work by Katrin Bentley, forworded by Tony Attwood. It is this book that I read a few years after reading TCGtAS by Tony Attwood that \\"made me see the light\\" by pointing out to me the importance of light, more specifically the way light triggers the production of serotonin, important in countering autism related depression.<br /><br />As an Aspie I am seriously hindered by light and  noise, I do live in a house I adapted to be quite darkish and quiet for this very reason, in a country that REALLY is not sunny(Belgium). Being light shy cut me off from natural serotonin so I tried the next best thing, serotonin in form of an antidepressant prescribed by my regular medical doctor.<br /><br />This works, but only up to a point. It does upset melatonin production big time. Serotonin = wake up & be happy hormone, melatonin = sleep & be rested hormone. You basically replace depression for lack of light with depression for lack of sleep.<br /><br />Being thus dead ended I sought out a psychiatrist who after reviewing among many things my medications suggested light therapy. Light therapy with specific lamps is used the world over to counter Seasonal Affective Disorder/depression aka winter blues. A sufficient dose of the \\"right\\" kind of light in the morning will trigger the normal production of serotonin to get you going without upsetting the normal and timely production of melatonin. After nearly a month of using light therapy glasses I am no longer using the antidepressants nor do I need sleeping medication. I did not relapse into depression and am slowly regaining a normal sleeping pattern.<br /><br />I would therefore like to suggest light therapy as an alternative for medication for autism related depression.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER<br /><br />I am not a medical man.<br /><br />Medication was prescribed by my regular doctor, the one you go see also for the flue. Light therapy was suggested(strongly) by a psychiatrist who is completely up to date on Asperger Syndrome, the writings of Tony Attwood and Simon Baron Cohen. I did check on this because even in this day and age there is still a lot of disinformation out even among mental health care professionals. If you think light therapy might be a solution for you (if you're a fellow Aspie) or you are a caregiver I respectfully suggest you do your own research first and/or talk to a professional caregiver with experience with light therapy. The light therapy glasses I am using were suggested by such a professional and are marketed under the name of Luminette. Other similar products are availlable (even here on Amazon ;-)<br /><br />more DISCLAIMER<br /><br />I am in no way (other then as a very happy user) associated with the developers or sellers of the light therapy glasses I am using. I went to my local pharmacy ordered them & paid for them.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Ive used this for over a year, battery still holds for hours... And They turn junky earphones to good quality buds. And they turn good quality buds into supreme quality buds!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game! Good graphics, you do need wifi but that is easy enough!! J love competing and training my horses, and pretty realistic too! I am an equestrian who lives for horses, so I tend to rate horse games pretty harshly, but I like the fact that you train,  groom, ride, pet, feed, and care for this horse on your own! (If only mucking out a stall was that easy...)
B0055SWM08|4.0|This is a fun game, but it is hard, although that is better than being too easy. It's nice that it shows you how to solve a puzzle if you can't figure one out, so you don't have to worry about getting stuck on a level. Overall I enjoy it!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|We loved this story!  I read about the real life people that it portrayed and the film followed fairly closely to the true story.  Very touching, very funny, not at all sad, as I was imagining at least parts of it would be.  Two people who came together out of necessity and helped each other grow in ways neither imagined they could.
B00D8WJ9JK|4.0|Smart, witty, J.cole is definately headed in the right direction with this album.He has the approval from the rap gods
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is a great app to have, it is so compatible with so many ebooks, I even got library books through this! Thanks
B004NELBPC|1.0|I used to love reading HuffPo but this is just ridiculously hard to use.  Change it back, it wasn't broken.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's very useful cause it gives you the things you really need to do in FB. It could be much better but it is a good app.
006178480X|5.0|I am not a fan of James Rollins' co-written THE BLOOD GOSPEL. I am a longtime fan of the Signa Force novels.<br />And...<br />THE EYE OF GOD is possibly James Rollins' best ever... that seductive admixture of history and science and perhaps and possibility!<br />As usual James Rollins provides us with Historical and Scientific Notes and a delicious Glossary! These are so well written I'd buy the book just for them!<br />I love his commitment to travel and onsite research.... he may not yet have \\"magnetic fingertips\\" but he definitely has \\"magnetic eyes\\" when it comes to spotting a compelling plot possibility!<br />I just re-read SHIBUMI and concluded that these two spelunkers.... James Rollins and Trevanian << NOT the birthname of either of them... are brothers under the skin on the DNA lightwave.<br />James Rollins continues to travel the path of mastery when it comes to mastering the modern bestseller. The research shows that most pre-lease buyers are college educated and their response sets the tone for the reception the book will receive.<br />  In James Rollins hands.... history becomes more satisfying and demanding of our best efforts as does science....<br />we are put on the cutting edge of the \\"real\\" so as to see beyond into the mesmerizing realm of possibility and all the<br />ramifications along the way.<br />  Sigma Force members are a well-written cast of characters worthy of our time and respect...you always find yourself identifying with one or more of them ...<br />  and the plot is a read that requires mentation and imagination and courage.<br />Every reader becomes a member of Sigma Force and on the cutting edge of saving the world.<br />BRAVO! THE BLOOD GOSPEL I found disappointing. It is so very comforting to find that James Rollins is back full force in<br />THE EYE OF GOD.<br />  Whether in traditional book form; as an ebook on your Kindle or computer or other reading device... or on audio... THE EYE OF GOD is sure to become known as one of thebest ...if not THE best ...SIGMA FORCE adventure to date.<br />  And you'll want to read it more than once... as it opens up worlds.<br />As with Dan Brown's INFERNO... THE EYE OF GOD lends itself well to concommitant googling of sites and maps as both Brown and James Rollins are inveterate researchers and travellers in geography and those fields that interest them.<br />Only 5 stars for this one... in its genre: Bestselling Suspense Thriller....
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I really love this app. I can upload ebooks and pdf's with the cloud feature and dowload it to any of my device's. Fast and easy to use.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use / navigate thru the bible. And it's free. Don't waste time with all those other versions like the NIV, RAS, etc... Just go with the 1611 Authorized King James Bible. I especially like the audio ability to listen to when driving.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Pros: Good movie for the whole family to watch, not to kiddie but still good for small children.<br /><br />Cons: None
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is fun and addictive.I like that it's not too easy but still challenging enough to make you think and have fun.the only problem I had is it wouldn't let me play it off line but I'm hoping that was only because I hadn't opened it right away after I downloaded it and that since I got online and played with it that next time it'll let me play without being connected.I also like that even after you completed a level you can return to it later to beat you score and get trophies( there are plenty of trophies to work towards too). I was worried when I seen that you could buy coins only because I don't really like having to buy coins to play a game but I haven't had to purchase any and you earn them easily by playing. As far as I've seen there's no need to purchase coins but if you want to you can to get levels unlocked b4 finishing the previous levels. This is not a problem for me because I like working my way through but if I do get stuck I have earned enough coins through gameplay to move on so as not to get frustrated by having to play that level over and over I guess.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|Ok so love this game but has very little colors and people so it's ok but could be better so ya
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its so awesome its that kind of that gets you so addicted and when you think you want to give up you just cant you want to beat the game so badly I love this game just make it a little harder though
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It's cool and all but not so amazing. Unless your someone who likes to let a rip and floor it, its the game for you. I don't really like it though, but I did give it four stars because it was not horrible, if you a guy who thinks  going to fast and tipping your car over and breaking your neck is funny, get it. Bye!
0142410322|2.0|My kids (5 and 8) loved Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and we had a wonderful time reading it together. It was natural to move to this book as a follow-up, but I'm afraid it has none of the magic of The Chocolate Factory. The characters are flat, the story has nothing inspirational, and the what humor exists is essentially forced puns. Oddly disappointing story, and I actually wish we hadn't read it and had instead stopped after his last book.
B0095P33IW|4.0|pretty good movie had a lot of action and a moral to the story .  so if you want to watch a movie  go for this one
B000VUDSH6|4.0|Jackie Chan is one of my favorite actors / directors. His martial art are astounding and has to be admired for doing his own stunt work.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is an awesome game, very interesting l cant wait for more levels to come. hope tge get them out soon please. love this game
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Having a hard time getting into this one!!  But Syliva Day is a great writer.  I am sure it will get better
B008YKGQR4|5.0|A very good application just like using a laptop version or much better because of its portability. Great job for those program designer. Looking forward to more enhancement or upgrade the product in the future updates. Option like linking the program to a personal address book but with the users choice and simply unlink if it need too. Features such as option to stay at a certain version of the product will be plus to some user community.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Every Nicole Sparks book is worth reading! As always, never disappointed in his stories or the emotions they bring. Love.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love these books. Very well written and I easily get sucked in to Eva and Gideon's world. Can't wait for the next!!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I loved this movie. The acting was superb.  Especially Jennifer Lawrence.  Coming from a bipolar family myself, I could identify with the  dynamics of the families.  A favorite movie
0739382365|3.0|Fun and light listening!  I enjoyed it but not sure everyone else would.  British in a lighthearted, nonesoteric, amusing way.
0812982622|5.0|I have read several nonfiction accounts of North Korea, and I got a glimpse of life there.  But this is a story rather than a report that tries to be a story.  I am only about 160 or so pages into it, but it is fascinating and hard to put down.  One thing that I have a habit of doing and that is avoiding the line at the library and just ordering my own copy from Amazon and then passing it around. It gets to be expensive over each year, but I am a book person.  In my geographical area, which is a vacation destination and summer retirement community, the library list of waiting readers is always long. THen you must read it in a given amount of time.<br />Well, back to the review of this book. The author did a remarkable job of putting together life in North Korea...terribly interesting, and although I do not know who is reading this review, I'll venture that you will like the book and be glad you read it.  IT really does answer some of the behavior that we've seen in North Korean leaders this year!
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Could have been so much better, and that's disappointing. A bit more background earlier in the movie would have made a difference, as I found the lack of \\"why\\" lent an air of uncertainty to the whole story.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I watched this movie so that I could go see the second one soon. Really enjoyed the storyline. Great picture quality. Watched on a iPad. Easy to access and pause and restart.
B0007MAO0M|4.0|HOW I WISH THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TRUE!!!  ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE WESTERNS.  GOOD VERSES EVIL.  THE WAY THE MOVIE OPENED WITH SCOTT GLENN TAKING ON THOSE BAD GUYS IN THAT SHACK TO ALL THE CHARACTERS WE MEET IN BETWEEN, WHAT A RIDE!  I NEVER WOULD HAVE PEGGED KEVIN KLINE FOR A COWBOY, BUT HE PULLED IT OFF.  YOUNG AND EXUBERANT KEVIN COSTNER WAS GREAT IN HIS ROLE, AS WAS FUTURE LETHAL WEAPON STAR DANNY GLOVER.  BRIAN DENNEHY, JOHN CLEESE, LINDA HUNT, AND JEFF GOLDBLUM, ROUND OUT A  GREAT CAST.
1781162646|5.0|As previous reviewers have noted, this is at heart a coming-of-age story with a crime mystery thrown in for good measure.  Devin is a very likeable character and the amusement park setting was delightful to read about.  Of course, being a Stephen King novel, there is a touch of the supernatural...  I highly recommend \\"Joyland\\" to anyone who likes a \\"gothic\\" story with mystery and suspense...  and a little romance, too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! Its a great, fun game. The only bad thing about it is some things cost ALOT of coins to buy. I have the double coins thing and its still hard to get enough coins. Other than that its a GREAT game! (and it's FREE)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You'll have a lot of fun with this game! You get to take care of your very own horse and even buy more.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Lots of characters but engaging - look forward to reading the trilogy and seeing it sometime on tv in some format.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Much like 100 Rooms, this game will make you use your noggin to proceed.  So far not too challenging though.  I hope the puzzles get more involved in the later rooms.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I have never bought a Credence or John Fogarty album.  I do think CCR's \\"Heard Through the Grapevine\\" one of my top 10 songs of all time, but for most of their stuff, it wasn't quite my style (I'm a Deadhead, but also like CSN&Y, Jackson Browne, some Eagles, Moody Blues, Who, etc.), but when reading the reviews, I decided to give this a try.  It has been a long, long time since any album grabbed me like this one-maybe 2 or 3 decades!  It is simply that good!  It reminds me of the best of the best from the late 60's through the 70's.  It has been in the car CD player since I got it and has been played through at least a dozen times, without changing to another CD.<br /><br />Get it-you won't be disappointed!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|The openness and the gut wrenching truth that a man can write about his own life without the sugar coating or the elaborate storytelling that you would come to expect. This book reveals a man who was so dedicated to the cause and helping his teammates that he would risk his life time and time again. I really enjoyed the perspective coming from his wife. Especially knowing that some people have struggles but thy can get through them
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Works great, using on a samsung note 8, works just like the web site.<br />I would definantetly recommend this app.
B0090KZDSK|2.0|I was so looking forward to the next episode with Gideon.... that maybe I set my expectations too high.<br />The much awaited third book in the series did not move the story along as much as it should have in my opinion.<br />It feels like the story, (finally the happy ending that these two people deserve) is just too long in coming. I think the author could and should have given the readers what we wanted in this book rather than forcing us down the road of a fourth book.<br />Entwined lost the rapid momentum of first two books. I read both the previous books in one sitting, not this one though.<br />I was disappointed. As I said, maybe my expectations were just too high....
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Season 2 was awesome! They are really trying to stay true to the books. These are very complex story lines and tons of characters but so far they have done a great job of getting it all in there without changing anything!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play Subway Surfers everyday. This game is the best game I have ever played on my Kindle. Thank you whoever made this game. Keep up the great work!!!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Loved the books when I read them and was thrilled but apprehensive when I found out they were coming to TV! Bravo!  They  have done a spot on job of the books thus far.  Have really enjoyed the series!
B005LHOKFS|4.0|We have used this app many times with great success.  I like that it ranks the restaurants and allows you to check out the reviews quickly.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Taking these story lines and characters to places I did not think they would go to. None the less I really like where Julian Fellows is taking it. Keeps you on your toes! Love it!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Wonderful game, lots of fun when alone and nothing to do. Challenging enough to keep mind busy with the different ways to win.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This book really leaves you hanging and can't wait to read the next book in line.  Keep  enjoying reading the crossfire novels!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I got this game thinking I might use it to divert myself. Instead I got a very good puzzler, if a bit short. I can't wait for the next chapters. I only hope they live up to the beginning of this story.
1781162646|5.0|What an excellent book! It didn't have much in the way of the supernatural (though there was certainly some in there) or crime (though it walked through most of it as a seemingly insignificant sub-plot only to pop it's head in in a big, bad way at the end - no spoilers, just sayin'...), but it had an outstanding main character and a neat setting. Devin Jones is (was - he's remembering this fall of his 21st year from our present time) is a heart-broken 21 year-old who got a summer job at a small amusement park (Joyland) on the shores of North Carolina. You can read the description of the book to see what the main thrust of his story is, but he basically makes some great friends, touches some lives, saves some lives, and has the most memorable summer/fall of his life in 1973. He proves over and over to not just be a superb human being, but to have a great voice. The reason this book succeeds is because he's a character who's head is fun to share for almost 300 pages. He, along with the setting of Joyland, make this book as special, as entertain, as touching as it is. Don't expect to be overwhelmed with the speculative side of fiction, as Mr. King usually dishes out (there's some in there, and it's quite satisfying indeed), but go along for the ride in the mind and life (or at least summer and fall) of Devin Jones (Jonesy). And going along for the ride is something you should do at an amusement park like Joyland.
B00821OX98|4.0|This isn't very realistic, but this is all fun and games anyway.  Hope season 3 is offered on prime soon.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Now 2 updates behind Google play. Don't buy it here as amazon has not given us an update for several months. And Google posts them as they come out.
1440503257|5.0|Have you ever wondered what Cauldron cakes, treacle fudge, or Chocolate Eclairs tasted like?? Or how to make Aunt Petunia famous Strawberry Trifle or Knickerbocker Glory?? Well, this is the perfect recipe book for anyone who has ever wanted to taste the magical foods of Harry Potter!!! Highly recommended for all Harry Potter fans!!!
0316286869|5.0|I absolutely covet this book. I am never going to let go of it. Kevin was such a beautiful make up artist.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|This book is a classic for a reason...heroes, villains, action, suspense and beautiful writing. GREAT book for boys, but I'm a middle-aged woman and I loved it, so toss any preconceived notions out the window and read it!
B007OLYQ4E|3.0|A Christmas memory is the best story in this collection. It is such a great sad story. Breakfast at tiffany s reads similarly to the movie with more detail.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|love this series better than the movies.  One of my favorites.  Happy that amazon offers this.  can't wait until season 2
048623231X|4.0|what i expected and great companion for the divine comedy edition bought. really clear prints and commentary is easy to understand.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Disney stands for so many things and if you want to be cynical about them there is plenty of opportunity. For me I look to the things they've done the best and \\"Jungle Book\\" is one of the very best.<br /><br />The characters are all well defined visually and the voices match the look perfectly. The songs are not just memorable they are almost necessary for a well rounded childhood.<br /><br />No matter your age there will be someone here that you identify with. (I'd like it if I were Shere Khan, but I'm probably a little more King Louie) This is a fast paced, jazzy and fairly hip (for it's time) feature. It was one of the few that I never minded the kids saying, \\"More! Again!\\"<br /><br />The extras are fine, but I rarely judge a DVD release by the extras. In this case I was very happy with restored brilliance of color and sound. It looks just great on my Sony TV.<br /><br />The kids I used to watch it with are now Sergeants in the army and computer techs for Microsoft, but I still watched it anyway. I remembered every word to every song and it all made me feel happy.<br /><br />That is what Disney does best.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Having fun.  Lots of different types of tower games to choose from.  Keeps me busy &amp; helps with eye coordination.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really liked this game ALOT!!! It is very addicting, it totally sucked me in and I played until beat each room or level, very well made...can't wait for more rooms
B00BSWMITK|2.0|In my opinion his last good work was &#34;Is There Love In Space?&#34;. Since then<br />it's been down hill. Please note that I have purchased nearly every CD and<br />DVD Joe has put out. I really respect his talent but I definitely think he's past<br />his prime.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|when I try to install it says cannot install. kindle has enough memory. I will hare this until I can install.
B004H0M8EA|5.0|Jared Diamond is a thoughtful academic, and in Collapse he puts forth a chilling set of parallels between past societies and modern society. A must read for anybody who cares about the state of humanity, their present course, or the environment.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This was a wonderful ending to an enjoyable series. I will miss having Sookie books to look forward to, but it was nice to revisit some of the characters that permeated throughout the series. I loved the ending.
1905113153|5.0|this book is great. this book has so many great ideas. it is very clear to understand. i would definitely recommend this book
1591396190|4.0|This was an quick, enjoyable read. The book articulates some rather simple concepts that are seemingly overlooked by many, or avoided because they are a departure from the more typical yet paradoxically difficult competitive strategies. I did feel the book droned on a little too long with too many examples, but most of the examples were interesting. I prefer a more direct, concise delivery, but an example story never hurt anyone.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I like it. works great and can check out my docs, pics,  or drafts anywhere with my pc,  kindle or phone. using it with my team to stay on track for organizing and planning events.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Picks up right where the last book left off. And the end leaves you hanging again which means this trilogy is going to end up a series. If you liked the first two you will like this one too!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so entertaining and fun really helps the reflexes. I love all the cute characters and love the missions.
0061150142|1.0|The book was a mess, falling apart, it was even missing about twenty pages. It was a great read I just wish I didn't have to buy a second one to keep reading.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The story flowed like all the other books. The book is intense and kept me on my toes like always.
0143123173|3.0|I love the tv show so thought I would try the books. The characters are likeable & believable but the story tends to wonder. You will be reading along then the story suddenly changes course with no warning. It's also hard to follow which character is talking. I would recommend it to all the shows fans, but pay attention as you read because its easy to lose your way
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Little kids can enjoy this at the basic level. But the higher levels are definitely for older 'kid's'. There are a few boards that make you really think. Some are mindless if you are spatially aware.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day is awesome, you get to know her characters, feel for them, hope for them, cheer them on.  The Crossfire Series is by far the best books I have read in a long time.  Ms. Day gets you from the start.  You will fall in love with the characters.
B003GMJ9WO|5.0|This is the real Superman, beautiful DVD!  Just what I wanted for my well rounded DVD collection for all ages
1781162646|4.0|I am no book critic let me make that clear but I do read a lot so here is my simple review for anyone questioning buying this book:<br /><br />I will start by saying no it is not an on the edge of your seat mystery crime thriller but I think it does have a good story that is great for a simple read (finished this book in a couple days). King always has a way of pulling the reader in and having them become attached to the characters and this book is no exception. Devin Jones was a great main character and he was very relatable. The ending was very satisfying and was not predictable which is also why I give this book 4 stars.<br /><br />All in all I think it was not one of his best books but by far not the worst either; I did not feel like I wasted my time after reading this book and that is good for me. If you are contimplating buying this book just give it a try for yourself it is not expensive or an extremely lengthy book and I am sure you won't feel like you wasted your time either.
B001BANK32|5.0|I always wanted to read this book and when i found out that there was a sequel for it being released in September I jumped on it right away.  The story is good, really good, not scary but very intense, very suspencfull.  It was written in the seventies and a sequel for it will be released for it later this year.  I can hardly wait.
B009PNQUXO|4.0|Works very good! Love the app! I. Used it on nexus 7!  I am going to try to use it on my evo!
B008ROELL0|5.0|Great thriller!!  the performances by Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall are what we would come to expect from two of the greatest actors of my generation.  Great Movie!!
B008476HBM|5.0|I can easily see why this classic has stood the test of time! I am glad I finally made the time to read it. Anyone who is a romantic at heart should read it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I totally like this game because i get to do cool things. I always liked games like this. I love the people's names to.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|The directions are not good enough to let you know what you are supposed to do.  I was not able to even get the game started.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|It depresses me that the e-books are $10 more than the actual physical copy.  It doesn't make sense to be honest. When these drop in price ill get them because its easier to carry around an iPad instead of 4 thick books. Disappointing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I made a lava wall it's cool my friend Ronald Raymond and me builded over 100 world's I made a girl with a butt pooping and a face with items coming out of his mouth I builded a mansion with fake ghost<br /><br />  Randall Ferree with ron
B0092S4WLY|5.0|it feels awesome to play something other then minecraft and cooking games it is so fun lil :) p.s. love to play it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It wakes you up completely and is a great app. It serves it purpose. I definitely plan on keeping this app. You won't be disappointed. I guarantee that.
B002V9PEU4|5.0|You love Arnold, you love Action, you love cheesy one-liners, then you already know you love this movie as well
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love the book it had a lot of details and info.... I wish I could read it a again
B000XJ5TOK|5.0|Enough said. Her and Michelle Rodriguez are some of the hottest actions stars out. Mix in some monsters and winner winner, chicken dinner.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|in the words. of my 5 year old &quot;I love the game cause I love I web sling. and get bad guy's &quot;
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|It's unreal how many times I have watched this movie. I even owned a burned copy but had to have the blu-ray. And the sequel comes out in August, YES!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun game.  It challenges you and makes you think.  It has math problems you must solve also.
B004ULEEY8|5.0|I love the fact that this costed 5 dollars, and that it got here safely and in time. The only thing that could be not as good as i hoped was the actual blu-ray package was very flimsy, but it was in a nicely cushioned package so no damage to it. I liked the movie .. it was ok, and i really only bought it because aaron eckhart is a pretty cool actor. We saw a tv version with a name much like this actual movie, it was terrible ... not even close to comparable with this movie. This movie could be compared to a movie you would redbox ... but at such a low cost, you might as well own it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The adaptation of the period is spot on, location, dialogue , costuming etc. It's even better because it's shown on PBS.<br />I had only been a &#34;from time to time viewer&#34; but now I'm hooked.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Happy to have stumbled upon this gem! I am in love, can't wait to read the next one! A wonderful combination of the supernatural and history.
B007ZYJT1U|3.0|I have no problem watching people kill people, but this flick rattles my killing sensibilities in the first 5 minutes. There are some things you just don't kill on film.  This is one of those flicks I'm sorta glad I saw but will watch again only if I start enjoying sticking pins in my eyes. The acting is superb and I wanted to like this movie more than I did. The protagonist is a very angry, but not young, man.  He is lost with no place to go and, as these plot-lines go, he stumbles upon an equally lost soul. The carnage continues and his &#34;mate&#34; becomes a more fully realized character than our protagonist. We get to understand her and her plight. Not so with Mr. &#34;I am REALLY pissed off&#34;. Without a deeper understanding of this late middle-aged mans angst, it's near impossible to buy his level of rage. I recommend this flick only if you feel you are in need of a hard slap in the face.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Some of the sounds, like Train Ride, are a little repetitive, and you start to notice where it loops after a while, but that's not a dealbreaker as there are so many other tracks to choose from.  I sleep with Crickets almost every night, and Brown Noise and Singing Bowl are perfect for concentrating during work.  They have saved my sanity many times when a neighbor is blasting awful music.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Charges really fast, frees up port. If I trip over the cable it pops out without disturbing the tablet .it's a must have.
B00COGXGNQ|1.0|slow, predictable and pointless.  cute couple but watching grass grow is more exciting.  Sleeping with the Enemy is much better.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|The app is very helpful. It tells you how much battery life is left and how long it will survive until you have to charge your phone. It also tells you how long it'll take for you to charge your phone. I like the app very much.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love this game! Helps with eye to hand co-ordination as well as just being plain fun to amuse oneself. Would recommend this game.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|it won't install on my device it says can not install and I can not find anything else to use for watching videos
B0062QRTKA|5.0|This game is an entertaining man-made work of fiction not based in reality and not to be taken seriously, just like the bible.
0345803485|1.0|This book is one of the worst books I have ever read. So repetitive and unfeeling.  I can't believe an adult person wrote this.  I consider good books like fine art and treated as such.  This book went in the trash after I strugled through the third chapter.  No more needs to be said.
0765325950|5.0|The last of the Wheel of Time series, this book was not as good as the previous 14 (13 plus the prequel) but it did attempt to pull all of the strands of the weave together.  I enjoyed this series so much and would recommend the books to anyone who likes fantasy sagas.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Lots of story lines and no ending. Just like the first book- feel like I wasted my time reading it! Second book was great this one- eh
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Um for a period of time the game is fun then, it gets a little boring basing on the fact tht there are power ups and new clothes that cost a crap ton of money so it has its bad and good sideds.<br /><br />PS, coins are so overrated in this game
B007RV5T1U|5.0|Easily the best film of 2011. Hopefully this masterpiece of a film will expose the world to Pina Bausch's work.
B000HL09MG|4.0|The first time I saw this movie, I was very &#34;meh.&#34; This time, maybe because I'm older with children, I really got into it. The themes were more apparent and relatable. The slow pace really works well now -- this movie is intended to be sipped and savored, not chugged.
031618201X|4.0|4.5<br /><br />I had a rather difficult time getting into Soulless the novel, so I thought I would try the graphic novel version instead. I must say, I loved it. Especially the amazing artwork, just beautiful, it actually enhanced the story, for me anyway. It was almost like gorgeous hip pop art meets the new wave of Americanized manga.<br /><br />However, I found myself with the same problem in the graphic novel as I did in the original novel, I had a little trouble with some of the language Carriage had for her world, like \\"preternatural\\" and some other vocabulary that was never really explained well enough for me, so I felt a little left out here and there. But overall I enjoyed it far more than the novel and read it in a single sitting. I fell in love with the characters and I can't wait to read the second volume of the graphic novel.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|This has got to be the best app I've downloaded so far. I've not completed all the levels but what I have played so far has made me laugh, it is the cutest!
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|The only way to advance in a reasonable amount of time is to buy game pieces with real Money.  You must spend 2-48 hours to upgrade things.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|This movie was a timeless movie that I first saw in 1963. You can't go wrong with Alfred Hitchcock. He directed his movies with the viewer in mind. Every move was to ensure our visual and intellectual pleasure.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Great book.  The only downfall like every series, it leaves you hanging at the end and you have to wait until the next book.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|If you can, get an 8-core processor, however I cannot complain about this 6-core, which in fact a hyper-threaded 3-core processor.<br />I works very well with my new motherboard, and is greatly compatible. Performance on demand, while saving energy!<br /><br />The machine is quiet, smooth, and fast. I can run Diablo II while the computer is still running an SVN server on the background, and I have Visual Studio 2012 Pro loaded doing some compilation. Now that's multi-tasking right there!
B004G8QTS4|4.0|Book starts off slow and relaxed, but finishes fast. I believe it pick up where the Dawn Patrol left off. Haven't read that yet, but it is next on my list.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great I like how about every 33 days there's a new theme or place this game really rocks.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have read all three books and am looking forward to more about Gideon and Eva.....Sylvia creates a wonderful,captive,hard to put down read.  I would recommend this series to anyone who likes, adventure, hot romance, adult themed... it is just a really good series......keep up the good work Sylvia Day.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game to play when you need to relax at the end of the day. As some reviewers said not too easy and not too difficult. played on my kindle with no problems.
1781162646|5.0|i thought this book written by a master story teller lived up to all expectations.<br />no horror.  just good old fashioned story telling with a bang-up ending.
B005BGBPBG|5.0|I absolutely loved &#34;Something Borrowed&#34;.  It was a fresh new twist on a classic love triangle story, and I found it very believable and also relatable.  It was funny at some parts, and touching at others, which created the perfect movie.  The characters were well developed and the dynamics between them were excellent.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie, and I would recommend it to everyone.
B003YOXINU|5.0|One of Gabriel's better albums.  I love every track.  Happy to have this album in my collection.<br /><br />Highly recommend this for Gabriel fans.
159463176X|5.0|This was a beautiful story. The author has outdone himself. I love being brought into the characters souls. Housseni has this down pat. If you loved The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, you will not be disssapointed here.
B0002BO0US|5.0|Great sounding remaster.  There are several versions of Odessey & Oracle.  This is the best total package considering the extra tracks that are included.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|I wonder why Steve chose to write this book. Without it, he, still in my mind, will be the creative and good guy I wanted him to be. But I  have to say this is a really good book. If you want to choose between success and happiness, buy this.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|I was about to purchase this app, but then I saw the reviews, and was so glad I didn't buy this app. There is another app called Midnight Mysteries, and it starts out like a demo, but to purchase the whole game it is only $0.99. It is really fun. Keeps you occupied for hours, but i hope you guys find my review helpful....:)
B005PR422K|5.0|This book is about applying lean principles in your business. This can help a business which is on its wheels, and on a wrong course , better. But have to say, there are some very good ideas and techniques discussed in this book, which makes it a interesting read. One thing I did not like is the inclination into the web and technology when it comes to examples.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game easy but challenging. Once you finally find the objects you get amaze of how easy it was to find. I always get this aha moment.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really good like looking after a real horse. Love it. Especially all the tack sets and competition clothes. Movement is v real too!
B00846F1YW|4.0|This is the second game I bought from this company and I really like the games they make. It's not just hidden objects there's a story to solve. My only complaint way to short for the price both games. They need to make their games longer then I would give 5 stars. If you like this game you will like million dollar adventure. Can't wait to play more games like this you have to buy it though because free does not give you enough to play.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|The movies arrived as expected and I have since watched this show no less than 20 times.  I love it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book was incredibly written. I felt emotionally connected to each of the characters. I will recommend it to everyone that I know. Beautiful family relations that I think most of us experience in our own lives. Family, whatever the history, is connected by some element, that either time nor loss of memory can take away.<br />Beautiful story.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|Just what I wanted for my new Kindle Fire.  It opens immediately and is easy to pare down messages ready for deletion.
B0041KKYGU|1.0|American Pie and Horrible Bosses are \\"raunchy fun.\\" Bad Teacher is raunchy but not fun. It looks to me like the intended audience for this movie is young teenagers, but the bigger problem is that it appears to have been written and directed by young teenagers, too. The entire movie is a repetition of the same one-line gag: The bad teacher, Cameron Diaz, says one vulgar thing after another. She's vulgar with her fellow teachers and she's vulgar with the kids. These are middle school kids and yes, she's as raunchy with them as with the adults. She's an alcoholic and a drug addict who keeps a large stash of drugs in her classroom desk and in her car. She sleeps during all of her classes, and on the few occasions she's not sleeping she's being vulgar with her students.<br /><br />With the exception of one teacher - the gym teacher, a completely out of shape, unathletic, and fellow drug addict Jason Segel - all the other teachers talk and act as if they are lobotomized Pollyannas teaching Kindergartners. In an attempt to make Diaz' character more \\"complex,\\" she's not only vulgar but a major liar, gold digger, embezzler, thief, cheater, and extortionist. Hey, but men fall in \\"love\\" with her because she's hot. Apparently she's a teacher because she needs a job to pay the bills until she marries a sugar daddy. Why she chose teaching as a bridge to that goal is beyond all comprehension. She'd have to attend college for five years and then get her teaching credentials just so she could teach for a year or two before getting married and quitting? She hates kids and she hates teaching. Actually it goes deeper than that: Being such a shallow and greedy person she hates giving anything to anyone; it's all about what she can get other people to give her, by hook or by crook - or, by sex. Why Diaz, Timberlake and Segel agreed to do this movie I'll never know. There must have been a lot of money in the budget for their salaries.<br /><br />Those of you who disagree with me and say I'm just a prude who doesn't like raunch, fugetaboutit, because I do enjoy raunch and I already told you I like American Pie and Horrible Bosses. And if I give it more thought I could probably think of more raunchy movies I like. And let me tell you something else: No matter what you've heard about the \\"hilarious\\" sex scene between Diaz and Timberlake, believe me, it's anti-climactic (pun intended). I'll admit that it's the funniest scene in this pathetically unfunny movie, but that's not saying much. It is not nearly as funny as Diaz' hair gel scene in There's Something About Mary.<br /><br />Aw heck, no matter what I say you're going to watch this movie anyway, you poor saps. Just do yourself a favor and don't pay any money for it. You'll thank me later.'m just a prude who doesn't like raunch, fugetaboutit, because I do enjoy raunch and I already told you I like American Pie and Horrible Bosses.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|So nice to have those pictures instantaneously on Kindle.  It's great to have the PC format at home and the Kindle format when traveling.
B0037A4ILC|5.0|I loved the show. If you loved K2 then this movie will be right up your alley plus its a true story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game and looking forward to new levels coming out. It was challenging and enjoyed the uniqueness of each room.
1451627289|3.0|I wanted to love 11/22/63<br />The first third was engrossing.  But then the story and sadly the writing devolved, became bland with little to none of the lyrical evocative descriptions Stephen is historically gifted at creating! I did slog through to the end. I was glad it was a library book.<br />The postscript was more fun to read than the book.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Lots of fun and stress relief is what this game is all about, challenging too!<br /><br />Would definitely recommend this game to others.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is all out fun. the challenges are fun and you can try to beat<br />Your freinds score. This game is just plain awesome
B00CS74W0C|5.0|This series is awesome.  I actually reread books one and two because the characters are very interesting.  I am hoping that there is a book 4 because too many things unanswered.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is great! some people complain that you have to have a credit card just to finish the game, and to that I say, FOOHY. That is a complete lie. To finish the game, you don't have to buy the gems, just take the extra time to earn them! that makes the entire game free. to do this, you can find &quot;the pony in the box&quot; or just go on 4 or 5 days in a row to earn gems.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|This is a classic story that will entertain young and old alike.youth today would do well to learn to read and use their imagination on stories like this to exercise their mind. Let your imagination work and not the video!
B007TNQ7EY|2.0|It's awesome and I can't stop playing it not even for a second I lost out of control that I was so happy
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|I could not get into the Twilight books and only marginally more impressed with the movies, so when I was given The Host as a gift I had real doubts about it. I read it and then I read it again, it is in my permanent keeper collection. It is also on every Kindle device I own. When the movie was released I again had doubts but not anymore, it was great. It remained very close to the book and that rarely happens. I heard they will be making more Host movies and I can't wait to see how they turn out. I highly recommend both reading the book and seeing the movie.
B005K17RU0|1.0|This game stopped me useing it,it said I did not own it I went to download it again and it did not let me

B000FC1HBY|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a book that much in a long time. I had to force myself to put it down and go do something productive now and then. A really good read. Enjoying A Storm of Swords now!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|was worth it though. even without multiplayer it is still a fun game. might still get it on 360 to play multiplayer though.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|You simply want to know more, twists and fate confound even the most devout readers. I can't wait for more.
B0058Z4NR8|4.0|Fascinating treatise regarding why some countries have and some have not.  This is a good companion book to Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel.  A great overview of human nature and sociology.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series.  It shows a different time and different place and how they lived and the challenges they faced.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|After I got to level 3 it froze. If I can't play I won't know if it is fun or not.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Easy to control with one finger, lots of power ups, huge fun, works on my Asus Transformer 700 table as well as my Galaxy S4. Fun stuff.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|The game has heart  that you need to wait to reload after you play but other than that it is fun.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I would recommend this show to sci-fi fans.  It has some wonderfully quirky humorous moments.  If &#34;the trouble with tribbles&#34; is your favorite Star Trek episode, this series is for you.  The show moves along at a good clip, too.  The only slight negative is that the British accents can be a bit hard to follow for my American ears.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|As expected, Quentin delivers another riveting script with his unique brand of action, drama and humor. The cast was spot on!
B00127RAJY|5.0|good packaging, dvd works fine, and workout is awesome. Had been doing level 1 from youtube video, and am now doing level 2, tough workout, but very doable since it is only about 20 minutes
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|I enjoyed the music. I like Cole and he delivered what I expected. I would recommend this album to anyone who follows his music and those who enjoy lyrical witticism.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I found this book to be very entertaining.  It combined many different elements such as humor and empathy. As usual, a good dose the legal profession was included.  John Grisham's books are always page-turners for me and this one does not disappoint!
B00DF0POXA|5.0|'Ye did his thing on this one, although It is a little short with only 10 songs. I'd recommend this to any of his fans and to those who like heavy electronic synth sounds melded with Hip Hop.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It isn't like other ones where you take turns fighting. It's very hands on but I wish that you could modify your character.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|This is his second pair in about a decade.  (The first pair still work fine but, they look a mess.)  They enhance the clarity of the music that he enjoys listening to.  He had me listen to a few familiar songs  like George Michael's &#34;Father-Figure&#34; and Eric Clapton's &#34;Layla&#34; and it was like i was listening to them for the first time.  They also have some external noise cancelling properties.<br /><br />He is a tech-guy so any headphones that distort sound or produce an artificial sound do not please him and he is a tough critic, but really likes these.
B000OLROWC|5.0|I watched this when I was a kid. Purchased it for my little ones to watch. It was a little slow at parts for them, but overall they enjoyed it.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I'm loving my new mouse! When I was looking for a new mouse there were so many options. Some had too many buttons, some not enough. Decisions... decisions. Well I went with this little beauty and am thrilled. I'm able to program the buttons how I want them for playing games like World of Warcraft for different spells and abilities and then if my husband wants to use my computer for something the button on the top changes how fast the mouse will move which makes him happy since his computer mouse is set crazy FAST! I don't mind it being corded as the cord is long enough I can pull it and have excess behind my monitor that it's not a hassle and it's more convenient than having to charge it daily or change the batteries for those of us who use our computer and mouse more than the average casual computer user. I highly recommend this and I know my husband does as well as he's jealous of my mouse and upset he got a different, more expensive one, that he's not happy with. :)
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Powerful Book.  It's hard to put down.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in history or just a great book.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Works good as it supposed to. Has a good heft and feel to it so it'll probably last.<br />I use it with an aftermarket $20 charger for my MBP 15 retina and it works well.
B0000AI45P|5.0|If you are at all interested in the music of the last 50 years, you need to listen to this album, and honestly you should own it. Play it over and over again until it sinks into your bones.
1439127727|4.0|This is a compellingly researched story about the support and camaraderie between living Presidents. Despite the sometimes petty rivalries and machinations that continue among this exclusive club, the overall spirit is one of competitive cooperation. The line: \\"I am rooting hard for you\\" really spells out the spirit of these political giants. There are times when the book seems to depart from its original charter and devolves into pure presidential history without much reference to the Team. And there is a limited inclusion of verbatim vulgarity; I suppose that any book drawing from Nixon or Clinton transcripts would have to include a few stray F bombs. But the overall story is hugely informative and ultimately hopeful. If all of Congress could unite for the common good the same way, say, that Bush 41 and Clinton did, it would be a hopeful trend indeed.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Because we want to. Believe that is. A book of what your worth is. A book that I hope \\"doesn't fade into the past like a memory forgotten or a shadow into the dusk.\\"
0307165485|5.0|I have given this book as a baby gift for the last 20 -30 years.  It is more than a story book.  It helps teach the alphabet, numbers, names of foods, different kinds of trucks, colors and I could go on and on!  It  is without a doubt the BEST childrens book I have ever seen!!
B004T6IBNY|5.0|I have always loved pinball machines and now I can have one at the tip of my fingers.  I can carry it in my purse to pass the time while I am waiting for appointments.  I just love this game.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Perfect for running/jogging! Stays in place unlike the earplugs. The sound quality is not as good as the ear plugs but it works for me!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This book had taken me a lot longer to get through, due to it just didn't have the spark like the other two books did. I am not saying it was bad...I am just saying it was a little more drawn out...which in the end I see why...the story concludes into another book or two.<br />If you love the Gideon and Eva storyline then you won't be disappointed. I love their love story, just to me this book was a little harder to stay focused on!
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is hands down my favorite new show! It has glamour, suspense, tension and comedy. The acting is excellent and the plots are well thought out.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|While the movie was good overall, the whole theme behind the hunger games and these kids all killing each other for sport is a bit appalling.  I guess that is what people want today, as is evident by the growing violence in the world.  I was going to turn it off after the the first 15 to 20 minutes, but my partner said to let it go and see how it plays out.  Dead Dead Dead.  Everyone dead, but 2.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|you keep playing just to see what the next puzzle is. not hard,  but challenging. great for waiting at airport or bus stop
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Good album, as everyone knows by now.  For some reason, I never did get around to buying it, probably because of the constant airplay on the radio and XM.  But, I finally broke down and ordered the CD, which was cheaper than buying the MP3 album, yet included it for free.  Funny, huh?<br />Listened to it completely through 2 times in a traffic jam.  Still like it!

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It is a shame when one is presented with the awesomeness of a dream of God that man must deconstruct it and reduce it to a logical, rational meaning. But then, what's religion for?  Reading the various reviews, one is impressed by the various interpretations that are made; this dialogue alone indicates the depth and scope of the topic presented.  It will become a classic.
B008B8AOQI|4.0|Evocative vocals and a hard edge in the lyrics. An excellent album that makes me think of my days as a student coping with life.
B005DD7TI0|5.0|This movie never made the big picture that well, but to me this was one of his best roles in a film. An interesting concept too, since many kids today use adderal to give them that kind of effect!

B005LAIGW8|4.0|When i saw the first Ghost Rider years ago i was not a super hero person i never liked that stuff. How ever after seeing it i started to open up a small bit. I liked the first movie but like all movies it had flaws it felt like they tried to play safe with it. Now im still not a super hero fan but when Ghost Rider 2 came out i planed to watch it asap. When i saw it i loved and hated it. Lets start with why i hated it..................<br /><br />-Dislikes-<br />The acting is awful and embarrassing to watch.<br />The plot is not really there<br />Johnny Blaze is aimed at kids more than teens-adults he does & says things that are just stupid immature and pointless<br />Ghost Rider is strange he acts strange and moves weirdly<br />When ghost rider wants to \\"come out\\" johnny acts weird and crazy<br />Johnny acts to strange at times.<br /><br />Now that you heard the bad lets go to the good!<br /><br />-Likes-<br />The Effects are AMAZING!<br />Ghost Rider looks more bad-ass in this one<br />I enjoyed how everything he touched turned into a \\"ghost rider\\" type thing.<br />The editing & camera angles were creative and unique<br />The action was top notch and exciting<br /><br />As you can see this movie was more about effects than story & acting but you should watch it once.<br /><br />0/10 on acting<br />2/10 on story<br />10/10 on effects

B0063IH60K|5.0|If you can put up with the ads, this is a great game. I have other Solitaire games on my Kindle Fire, and this one is the best I have found.
B008CYDD7I|4.0|Great B Horror classic from the 80's. If you collect this era of movies then you won't want to miss out on this one!

B005LHOKFS|5.0|I downloaded this app when my wife and I were travelling to Europe.  It is very easy to use and gives lots of detailed information about hotels and local sights and things to do.  If you love to travel, you will love this app.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|Fall Out Boy is one of those groups that you just want to dislike. You can't put your finger on why, but you just know that you shouldn't like them. But they're good. Their songs are catchy, they lyrics can be smart and their energy is very evident.<br /><br />Save Rock and Roll is a very good album. From beginning to end, these guys have managed to make a more grown-up record than any of their previous outings. Where &#34;Under the Cork Tree&#34; could have been the soundtrack to someone's high school years, Save Rock and Roll is the soundtrack for someone who's just reached the point in their life where they have accepted that they're an adult.<br /><br />I was going to pass on this album and ended up buying it a few months after release and I've been more than happy with it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a great game my kids love this I love it very creative. Would recommend to everyone<br />Love the different missions you can do
B00AYQNOQ2|5.0|No plot, no characters, but definitely a theme.  Watch this on your big screen TV.  Incredible video from around the world depict the near-endless circle of Samsara. (It's a concept in Hinduism.)  There's some imagery that might not be wholly appropriate for young children, but it's a great viewing experience.  This isn't commercial dreck but I think this is accessible enough not to be considered &#34;art house.&#34;
B00992CF6W|5.0|This was the most awesome game ever but is really slow on updating but that is Amazon's fault Mojang is not evil people!!!! I recommend this app for anyone looking for a way to pass the time.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|As usual, great action, although the subway train accident was just slightly less than plausible.<br />Solid plot, with the not totally unexpected exit of Judi Dench as &#34;M&#34;.<br />Interesting &#34;teaser&#34; with Money-Penney in the shaving scene.<br />Definitely colder side of Bond being exposed as Daniel Craig continues to hone the character<br /><br />Will continue to enjoy many, many more times...too bad I missed it at the big screen.
B005K17RU0|4.0|If you need a solid weather app look no further. AccuWeather presents just the necessary detail. Runs in the background; always has the current weather at any desired level of detail. Allows more than one location to be selected. THIS IS THE ONE I INSTALLED.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I like animals. I like all them the best. I love movies on there and games and gave life. They are so kind of cute sometimes but not to much.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Understandably, the father wanted to protect his son and believe in him.  He knew most likely from the beginning that something was wrong, but this was his son and everything in the father wanted the son to be OK.  Someone else must have done it.<br /><br />This story could be anyone's.  It is real and sad and loving.  Read it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love the good wife. The show gets  better and  better. This is the only show I try to watch on a regular basis. The stories are unique and the recurring characters amazing. I love the attraction between Alicia and Will.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|As always, East of Eden is well worth reading.  It is one that I'll read again and recommend in the meantime.
159463176X|1.0|Not in the least as like his 2 preivous books, kept jumping back and forth from past to present and people  were not  tied together ....If you are looking for a read like his past books forget about this one, very disappointed in this one!!!!!!!!  Should have gotten it from the library and saved my money.
B00CA4S3UI|5.0|Music LovinDad beat me to the punch, but I agree with everything he says.  I am normally leery of albums with multiple singers, but in this case it works beautifully.  Magnus' songwriting is so strong that the songs have his personality shining through no matter who is singing.  The worst song on the album is really good, and the best songs are crazy good!  My personal favorites are the appearances by Ralph Scheepers (Higher) and Tony Harnell (Stronger), but of course your mileage may vary.  As a bonus it turns out that Magus has a fine singing voice!  He could have done this whole album by himself and it would still have been great, but if I had his friends I probably couldn't resist asking them to do a song either.  His guitar playing is, of course, phenomenal.  His songs are catchy and hook laden, the choruses are huge and anthemic, his rhythms are crunchy, and his solos are by turns beautiful and jaw dropping.  This album is truly the perfect melodic metal album.<br /><br />Do yourself a solid and buy this album.  If you can afford 2 albums buy Freefall and Jorn's Traveler.  Then go out and buy everything else Magnus ever played on (Allen/Lande, Primal Fear, Scheeper's solo album, etc.).  I hope this album gets some exposure in the states, because it's high time that the metal community jumped on the Karlsson bandwagon!<br /><br />Magnus, if you're ever in Texas (probably with Primal Fear) I will buy you a beer!  It's the least I can do for the joy you've given me over the years.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I was sorry to see the series end, but it ended the way I knew it would because of earlier comments by the author. It also ended the only way it could. I did have some issues with how the fae were portrayed, but not enough to diss the book.
1577314808|5.0|This book is exactly what I needed at this point and time.  Better late than never.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to make the most and best of each day.

B00338QENI|4.0|I understand the need for some kind of rating process .  I do not understand the need for 500 words --not less.  I am not rating the quality of authorship which is beyond my paygrade.  I ordered the books, they arrived promptly in clean condition.  Books were about the subject  I expected.  I would much rather have a more brief review system .  Did I like the book?  not your problem.  You offered books for sale, I ordered some.  You did your part well.  I suppose you could offer an expanded description of some books. A title isn't always descriptive of content,  but then one gets into how much is enough.  Like high school English,  Have I expanded my comments enough to satisfy the number requirement,  we shall see.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I loved this film.  As a senior citizen, it was fantasy land with extremely good actors . I have viewed this film over and over again, never tiring of plot.  I must admit, I was put off initially by the title because it made no sense. My 26 year old grandson thought the title sounded like a porno flick.for old people, go figure...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great mind game . Keeps you thinking ! Loved solving the different clues. Cant wait for them to add more floors.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I have not tried this app yet but I would give it 5 stars.<br />Racing is awesome but you could get hurt very badly.<br />When you drive it feels like your free.<br />It does not feel like you are a baby anymore.<br />Then when you learn how to drive you will be driving your family everywhere.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|For those of you like me who loved Queensryche back in their heyday and have been longing to hear them sound like that once more your wait is over. With this self-titled cd the old Queensryche has returned! Scott tears it up on the drums, Eddie puts down some great bass lines, Whip and Parker bring back the guitar sounds not heard since the days of Empire and prior and Todd on vocals, well his voice brings back the old sound that makes you believe you are listening to Queensryche circa 1989. From the first to the last track this one delivers and stands right there with the likes of Operation: Mindcrime, Empire and all their classic stuff. If you loved them back in the day, with one listen to this new cd you will fall in love with them once again. On a scale of 10 I would give this an 11!
B0090KZDSK|2.0|It was basically just a run around little diffrent things in the book, it never really went anywhere and the ending was atrocious, It was just like she couldnt e bothered finishing the book properly, It was like thats it I'm done for another year. Boring boring boring!!
B00CX7OX6U|2.0|\\"You got me out of the darkness. You gathered me up from earth. You've brought me back to life.\\" Neil (Affleck) is an American who is traveling in Paris when he meets Marina (Kurylenko) a divorced mother with a ten year old daughter. Striking up a fast romance they both move back to Oklahoma. Not long after the move the relationship begins to stale and when her Visa expires Marina and her daughter return to Paris. When she moves back Neil reconnects with an old friend and they begin to fall in love, until Neil hears troubling news about Marina. I'm not going to lie, the only reason I can write that summary is because I read it off of IMDb. I did watch the movie but I couldn't really understand what it was about, even after reading the summary I still wouldn't have guessed that was the plot. I also am not sure if the movie was told in present time or one long flashback. I did have a feeling this is what I was going to get going in though because this is a Terrence Malick film (his last one was Tree Of Life) and his movies are very different that everything else. There really isn't much I can say about this, mainly because I didn't understand what was going on. I can usually follow movies, but Malick's are much to smart for me. Overall, if you liked Tree Of Life or movies like that then you will like this one too. I just thought it was boring. I give it a C
141659521X|2.0|No plot arc what so ever, no character development, hardly any surprises, an untouchable main character that survives anything. It's written as if it came from a production line, not from a creative author.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|Love this show!  I could watch it over and over again.  Amazon's video feedback is the best!  Looks amazing on my Smart TV.
B00C46QUCK|5.0|Caro is evidently huge in the UK and I'd never really heard her before but listened to some snippets and thought, well that's quite catchy. Yes, she does fall into that whole slew of women who seem to have benefited from Amy Winehouse making inroads with their raspy voice and throwback songs but Caro is more girl group poppier and upbeat which I am a fan of. Handclaps, harmonies and catchy lyrics this is a great summer pool party listen. I can't wait till her second record gets released here.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Like her style more than her content. Pretty rough, especially since those characters acting out the content are mostly teens.

Thank Amazon for this....  We thoroughly enjoy it on FB, but truly wanted it for Kindle Fire.  Biggest problem is \\"no way to earn more lives permanently\\", and the pricey cost of help items!!  But definitely a great fun game.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|A very important book that all should read. Enjoy the novel, but rejoice in the philosophy. Not to be missed
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie, and it is worth watching over again once you know the punch line.  We were skeptical at first because who wants to sit through 2 hours with &#34;a boy on a boat with a Tiger&#34;...which is all I previously new about the book...which is why I never read the book.  But I must admit, I was wrong.  It was very interesting and I never got bored.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this. game is a lot of fun. my kids and I spent a few hours solving the puzzles. highly recommended.
B00571F26Y|4.0|The book provided an interesting insight, although it's focus seemed to be more on people with chronic conditions. The data provided prompted me to limit my wheat consumption.

This is supposed to make sense?  This is supposed to woo my sympathy?

B00CXL6XP0|4.0|Like many other QR fans, I thought the band had been more or less &#34;dead&#34; for years -- despite them having released some [LAME] work over the past decade. I was aware of the drama of the past year regarding the band split, and have always taken THE band's side over Geoff Tate's (based on all of the information about his shenanigans over the past two decades). But I never really looked into Todd LaTorre's work and never expected the band to be a factor.<br /><br />Last Saturday a friend &#34;dragged&#34; me to a Queensryche show in Sheridan, Wyoming (of all places!) and I was just BLOWN-AWAY by their performance. LaTorre just nailed the early Tate vocal sound while performing most of The Warning, some of Rage for Order, Mindcrime, and Empire. He gave it his all for 90 minutes, as did everyone. Rockenfield was a BEAST on drums, and everyone seemed to be firing on all cylinders. They also played one tune (can't remember which one) from the new album and it sounded great, so I made a note to pick-up the album on its release day here at Amazon.<br /><br />My first listening experiences weren't the right way to listen to an album, because I was stuck here at my office desk... where I can't turn the music up loud enough to really soak everything in. But I liked what I was [barely] hearing. Now, a couple days later, I've had a chance to hear the tunes and I dig most of them. As others have said, it's a short album. But the bottom line is that this album IS the best album the band has put-out in almost two decades. So I'm VERY satisfied with the direction I see the band going and now know that Queensryche is VERY much alive and well. Whereas before now, the thought of a new QR album would have registered a &#34;meh... I won't be bothering to buy it response&#34;. NOW, I'm excited for the future of the band and hope that the next album takes-off from this point and continues on.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|More beautiful prose and a compelling storyline from Mr. Hosseini who brought us The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.  My only regret is that I may have to wait another couple of years for his next book!!  I recommend all three books, but each stands on its own as well.  Enjoy!!!

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book started out a little slow, but then got crazier and wilder by the minute!  I couldn't put it down and had to finish it.  I liked it so much, decided to read &#34;Sharp Objects&#34; by same author.
B000002GJH|5.0|The infancy of the Seattle music scene erupted with an explosion and boy did it erupt...Temple of the Dog, was a tribute 2 Andy Woods from mother Love Bone...Boy wat a tribute!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book really makes you question &#34;what just happened?&#34; at the end and &#34;how did it turn out?&#34;.  A very good read; how far would you go for your children?
B0002TJGQS|5.0|They are real batteries and work in my devices. I could not believe that I got them so cheap. It is a real bargain.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game.  It keeps you entertain.  It's a very addictive game that keeps you into the moment.  I would suggest this game to all my friends.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|IT is full season 5 of a really good series that we liked very much and look forward to season 6 on video.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I hadn't even heard of it until I saw it on Prime....I wondered how in the world I missed a JJ Abrams series....It's like Warehouse 13 meets NCIS meets JJ Abrams Awesomeness. Highly recommended!
B00D23GXB2|5.0|I am in love with G.P.A's style of poetry. I watch all of his videos on you tube and I have almost all of his poetry books. I am a huge fan and I wish him much success in his journey. Keep up the great work from yours truly Book Groupies Book Club(BGBC)!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Lots of matches. Great power ups. Pass ur FB friends.Quick refilled on lives. Great game! Fun and Easy!! I downloaded it on 2 kindles.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I absolutely adore mystery, especially Sherlock Holmes. What I loved about this was the fact that it was a free classic (gotta appreciate free stuff), I love the way it was written, and how suspenseful it was. I would read this over and over again. This book...
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game is awesome it runs really well on my G3 phone.  Now if you could get to run on my kindle it would be perfect.  Still worth 5 stars.
B0017TFLBQ|2.0|Game freezes up alot and will not go to actual size of my screen, seems to be a knock off or burned game but i can deal with it for the price i guess
B00D2K40WY|5.0|fun princess game with cute dresses. like it and kids luv dress up type games. like the art work and easy to load.
159463176X|5.0|The book is fabulous!  His writing is amazing.  Fully lived up to his previous books.  Now how long do I have to wait until I can enjoy the next one?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a fun game and a good way to waste time. u shoud get it,  it is free and it does 't take up to much space
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I can see what all the fuss is about, as this story is very different type of book from the usual kissy-kissy stuff - but not really my cup of tea. Definitely not well-written.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Run duck jump dodge surf jump collect coins I really like this game its a lot of fun<br /> jump run skip
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|A great read I cannot wait for the next book!  A three books in this series were excellent! I would recommend these Sylvia day books.
1616550414|5.0|This book is short to be called the definitive Zelda compilation, but do not misunderstood, is A GREAT achievement of art and history of the Zelda universe, hardcore fan or not you should definitely have this art book compilation!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Why dont they make this app free for peaple that dont have the money they could get it free and not wayst monny like i did
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting. You can play any state every update and you don't have to pay for it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this. It truly makes you think outside the box. I suggest this to everyone. I plan to play this repeatedly.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|King takes a vary common them and adds some delightful thinking about Time and whether or not Time can be changed. No horrible monsters. A love story!
B003XF1OJK|5.0|The book was awsome. I loved it. And who knew that the Master Chef was a six year old kid.I y<br />Think you should read it.
B00CLZ4B4I|3.0|I bought this to show to my 6th grade class as a special treat for the end of the school year.  The story was good and the actors were believable in their roles.  I think it was just a bit too drawn out.  It lacked real action throughout the middle and left my students a bit bored.
159562015X|1.0|If you take this test thinking it is like the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) then you are mistaken.  The results are rather a psychological profile that really doesn't help you know what sorts of jobs you would be better suited for.  A total waste of money.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|It is a great family movie with an inspirational message.  I look for family movies that encourage and this one does.  Great actors and great for the whole family.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I waited for this book. I was sooooo disappointed. It was a pot boiler to make more money with more books.<br />Shame on publisher and shame on the author.<br />They promised three books and lied to us. I  won't forget that.<br />Beside the fact that the plot was poor and the characters went nowhere.<br />I didn't return it because I read it. Sad to say.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|Very pleased with the new Twyla, nice color combo! Glad for the new variety with the 13 Wishes line. Looking forward to receiving them all.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|An immensely satisfying mouse. The buttons are in the perfect place and as far as everyone's concern is about the thumb buttons in the way, the mouse is designed to rest your hands right below and thus I've had no issues (right out of the box even) with pressing them! The DPI is the reason I ordered this and at that price you can't beat it. The quality of this mouse is above exceptional and rival's that of Razer and other major companies in the gaming mice industry.<br /><br />Cons: The fact that the weights could be a little heavier I'm using all of them and would like even more weight (which I'm sure somewhere I can find these little pegs at a heavier dose to allow my mouse to have even more weight). Although even as light as it is with all the weights I feel it still feels like a solid mouse.<br />And lastly you can only adjust the colors of the logo on the palm of the mouse not the scroll where or the 4 led's (that signify what DPI level your at) so that was a little bad but not worth any loss of stars.<br /><br />Still an extremely good deal for such a high quality mouse.<br /><br />(note)<br />for some users you may think the mouse is way over the top sensitive, make sure you go in to the Anker settings and actually lower the &#34;Mouse Point Speed&#34; to about 2 notch's this will allow the mouse to act more smoothly since it will be the one processing movement instead of windows guessing (this &#34;Mouse Point Speed&#34; option is linked to the Windows Control Panel &#62; Mouse &#62; Pointer Options [tab in window] &#62; &#34;Select a pointer speed&#34; setting and it is better to adjust this option with the Anker software since your mouse whenever it updates the profile will overwrite any setting you change it to via Windows Control Panel - Extra note &#62; in the Mouse Control Panel uncheck the &#34;Enhance pointer precision&#34; in the same &#34;Pointer Options&#34; tab and you will also benefit more from less windows interference )<br /><br />Screenshotsfor any help if needed<br />http://i.snag.gy/xPps1.jpg<br /><br />http://i.snag.gy/5LTNE.jpg
B000JLSM00|5.0|Liked it because of it's tacit messages - not everything needs to be spelled out explicitly.<br />I recommend John Wayne movies to everyone who was just too young to get into the cinema when they first were screedned.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I really enjoyed the book.  Dr. Alexander had a life changing experience, and he is a  very gifted writer, also.
B000O599WG|5.0|The movie had the right mix of high tension and quiet moments - Dean Martin as I have never seen him before
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Easy to read. A little odd to be reading it as if reading a diary but a good story. Since the story is about a young teenager writing to the reader the words are simple. Maybe a little too simple...but overall good.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this app is my fave app on my kf! u will not regret buying it! some other words: pickle hair shoes fashion
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I can check my bids and my shipments.  It's super easy! It is easy to search for items I want.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Can I have a cheeseburger?<br /><br />Marcus Lutrell is a true warrior and great American.<br /><br />Excellent book! Wonderful story about the battle, as well as his journey to becoming a SEAL.
0385535147|5.0|Grisham does it again.  What a great book to add to his collection.  Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|His story will enlighten you on what really happens in war. Chris is a true American Hero. He save many lives.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I think the show is great. loved the second season too. can't wait for the third season to come out!
B0071MQ37E|5.0|Not very far from live experience. Music, acting, and producting qualities are superb. I definitely recommend this to people who are fans of POTO.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|This was possibly the worst book I have read in a long time.  It became very tedious about half-way through.  The character development was weak and the plot was even weaker.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Watching the movie led me to purchase this, and I can say it is by far the best production of Les Mis. The feelings that I got from the movie is heighten in this concert like the Prologue and Bring Him Home with Alfie Boe, Lea Salonga's staging time, and Samantha Barks as Eponine is fabulous. I love Ramin Karimloo's Enjolras and Lewis Norm's Javert (like his voice but feel like his portrayal lacks depth).<br />And how Nick Jonas get cast as Marius is beyond me. Probably his appearance was the main reason and him trying his best is appreciated. However, his voice is weak and it was painful yet amusing to watch him being overpowered just by Samantha and/or Katie, not even to mention the full-flow cast.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I could not  put the book down.  l Loved it and can't wait for book number 4! Hope it is soon!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves this game because it's like taking care of an real horse. I love it! She She absolutely loves horses.
B001MM28JG|5.0|This movie is truly a masterpiece. If you love Star Trek and you don't like this movie there is something wrong with you. The actors, the script and the director all come together in this truly funny \\"what if\\" flick.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I first played this game with a friend who said they loved the game so I got it myself. I can't wait till they make the next room!! Me and my brother love the game. Though if you get annoyed with challenges you might not like the game, the room is a challenging game, It does give small hint though.<br />I hope you will enjoy tithe room as much as I did.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I probably am not adding anything new, if feels like I've been reading Thai forever and am still not through it. I hope with the show going it will force this story somewhere. Anywhere. Because I feel like I've read a billion pages and I feel- nowhere.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|i kept reading and waiting for something to happen. Then it was just a fluff. Also the release date changes peeeeeeed me off. Was way too long between books.
B004WY1FJK|5.0|I have completely work out my paper copy of Cupcakes and love just about every recipe in it, so when it was time for me to make some cookies this was a must have. I'm so glad I was able to get it on kindle, so much easier for me to have a digital version. I've made several of the recipient and they are perfect.
0385513755|4.0|My son loved the illustrated version of this book and so did I!  Some of images really helped me to grasp some of the more obscure references in this book.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I  (and returned) 3 other mobiles before I found this one. My LO really engages with this one. The music is great, audible, and lasts for 20 mins before you have to restart. I live that you can restart by just pushing a simple button on the mobile itself or using the remote. The best part about this mobile is that each of the animals turns 360 degrees on its own in addition to the spinning of the mobile.<br /><br />Warning, this is not a mobile to put your LO to sleep though!<br /><br />I just wish manufacturers would make mobiles to fit on playpens.
0316023744|4.0|First of all, I am a big Antony Beevor fan.  I count his books on Stalingrad and the taking of Berlin among my absolute favourites.  I thoroughly enjoyed The Second World War but have a few minor gripes:<br /><br />1.  It's not as well edited as his previous books.  There are obvious syntax errors and the book just feels like it was rushed to the printer.<br />2.  I can't figure out which version of English the guy is using.  For the most part, he follows British English practice but he mixes it up with American English.  Colour and Harbour are spelled with a \\"u\\" and, in most cases, he uses \\"s\\" rather than \\"z\\" (prioritise rather than prioritize) but not always.  I guess this is really a subset of my beef on the editing.<br />3.  It is annoying how he uses outdated terms for the names of Chinese cities and other geographies.  Chung-king rather than Chongqing, for instance.  In some cases the difference is so great that it's difficult to understand his reference.  Contrary to well-established convention when writing in English, he also places Japanese family names before given names.<br /><br />Others have complained that AB did not include this or that within the book.  Of course he didn't!  Imagine how many volumes this work would be if he covered every aspect of the war!  (an impossible task, of course)
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I paid for this app and now it won't download. Someone please help me. I really want this game. Help
B00AFPVPDG|5.0|I really liked this book.  Before picking it up, I hadn't given much thought to learning new skills.  But once I started reading, I started compiling a growing list of skills I want to learn.  Everything from learning to draw to flying a plane is now within reach.  The idea that a skill can be acquired in 20 hours opens up some new possibilities. That doesn't mean it's easy,but the process is clear.  I found the chapters on breaking down a skill and on learning to be very beneficial.  The rest of the book contains case studies on how Josh Kaufman applied his ideas to learn new things.  I enjoyed reading these cases.  They provide some good contextual ideas.  The key with this book is to apply the ideas as early as possible.  Start thinking of some things you'd like to learn.  Then read this book and get started.
B009R659L8|5.0|Could not stop reading this book, great characters.  Mary Higgins Clark does an excellent job of her characters.  Keeps you guessing
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|This is a great app for people who hate having to plug/unplug their KF from the usb all the time.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was thrilled with this game. Not since Must have I been as captivated. Looking forward to the next Room. WHEN CAN WE EXPECT IT?
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This is such a cool game!! I love how you can was there hair do facials,<br /><br />put makeup on and dress them up!!  I could play this game for hours I had to get the wedding and prom one to, and they're no the very very Fun. I am going to have to get the full version!!!
006178480X|5.0|A comet is passing by but drawing energy from the earth causing a space time wrinkle.  It is causing asteroids to come into earth's path.  A satellite in space, linked to one on earth, captures the energy of the comet, and reveals the East Coast in ruins and it is only a matter of days before the end happens.  However, there is something here on earth that is emitting the same kind of energy drawing the comet and asteroids that will end the world.  All the Sigma Force- Gray Pierce, Monk. Kat, Painter Crowe, Duncan, and yes Seichan now with Sigma, not the Guild- are assigned tasks to recover the downed space satellite.  They are aided by Jada, a physicist, who knows the ins and outs of the satellite, about space-time, other dimensions and reality.  The object on earth attracting this comet was brought to light by the Vatican Monsignor Vigor Verona who enlists his niece Rachel to track down the object, which has connections to Genghis Khan.  Of course, the Sigma forces, thwarted at every turn, save the day.  The action is fast paced and leaves you questioning what you believe about reality, other dimensions and the possibility of one having another life in another dimension where things come out different.  Do you really know what is out there, how space time affects our life, where we go when we die, that what we see and think is actually real?  Makes one wonder.  I missed the Guild in this book.  Seichan actually lets emotions come out when she and Gray find her mother, long thought dead.  Are Seichan and Gray going to be an item?  Is Duncan and Lala going to wind up together?  Is Lala going to be part of the Sigma force? Stay tuned.
B009POHHR6|4.0|This story does not disappoint. It's engaging, unexpected, and nothing but fun from start to finish. This is a purchase you will not regret. But keep in mind, this is an elseworlds story. It's not really Superman.<br /><br />In the realm of Superman stories, [[ASIN:1401229174 All Star Superman]]  is the superior read over Red Son by far . However, as a stand-alone alternate reality tale, Red Son is fantastic. A great \\"What-If\\" done right.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The Brits really know their acting. No special effects or filthy language just a superb story line with amazing actors. The story line just keeps getting more & more interesting to where you can't wait for the next episode . I love it and gave it 4 stars.
B009ZW9DU2|5.0|I loved this book!  I am enchanted by the amazing relationship between James and his cat, no ordinary cat indeed. This was a delightful breezy read that touched my heart.
B006IYFCIM|5.0|Dan Ariely writes another great book on our behavior and why it's so important to actually analyze what we're doing.  The look at honesty is a great aspect to look at, and each chapter of the book reveals some truths that I feel we all need to look at.  Great book!  I highly recommend picking it up.
B009K677CE|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful and well-produced albums you'll ever hear. If you already are a fan of Claudia, Propaganda or Act, don't be put off by the fact that this album is entirely made up of covers of other artists' songs. The choices are eclectic and inspired, and Claudia (with producer Stephen Hague) works her magic to make them her own. And if you're not already a fan of Claudia and her previous bands, you will want to buy up everything she's done after hearing this gem. Five stars!
B007V4530A|5.0|A great book to read if you're thinking about presenting at all.  TED delivers great presentations, and if you want to learn how to talk like the best of TED, this is the book to pick up.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. Has all the right cliches, &#34;Who;s John Wayne?&#34; This is a movie I can watch or sleep through. Safe and guarded. Good acting. I love it. &#34;We already had breakfast!&#34;
B003EY7IUY|5.0|Another enjoyable shopaholic book. There were many funny parts. It was a quick read and a great way to kick off the summer.
B00BN3DPQ4|1.0|I saw this movie a few days ago by renting it from Redbox's most famous Hit & Miss categories. I just made that up of course, there is not such category but there ought to be. I believe Redbox is hitting my dopamine receptors a little too precisely, like a gambling machine I can't stay away from really great to really bad movies, all of which have passed my retina in the name of self-enlightenment or entertainment.<br /><br />This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, it's right up there with AI and Madonnna's Swept Away. Some great actors starred, like the truly divine Forrest Whitaker, and for what he's worth, that Austrian dude whose name I can't spell right now but who rocked in all the Terminator movies.<br /><br />This is not an action flick in the likes of Vin Diesel, Milla Jovovich or Jason Statham (can't think of any black action heroes right now, weird. That bothers me a lot. Which black actor is on par with Vin Diesel and Jason Statham? Will Smith? Maybe. But when we think of franchises like the ones Tom Cruise or Matt Damon star in, only Lawrence Fishburn comes to mind and gorgeous Jamie Foxx, who should have a franchise like Terminator, Iron Man or the Fast and the Furious.<br /><br />This is action driven, humorless drab, and it's unfortunate because plot is equally important as new tricks (I refer back to Jason Statham, who supersedes stunts with every movie he does, and keeps thinking of innovative ways to brutally beat up his opponents). An example of an amazing action flick with incredible stunts, dialogue, plot and humor was \\"Get the Gringo\\" with Mel Gibson. Thank you, Redbox, that was a hit. [[ASIN:B008M34INW Get the Gringo]]<br /><br />I only watched this because it was filmed here in NM and it doesn't hurt to see how our tax dollars keep Hollywood at work. Unfortunately from the get go it was one lame action sequence after the other, dimensionless acting, Forrest was greatly underutilized, and again, no humor. And what's up with all the head shots?! Yes, every single bullet fired caused exploding heads. A little overdone, don't you think, Special F/X department and Director?<br /><br />The only good thing about \\"The Last Stand\\" was a stack of Reason magazines on the couch, and with my cat sleeping in my lap I spend a wonderful afternoon. Lastly, I forgot to mention Dwayne Johnson. He may be the proper heir to Arnold, who should go back to politics and stay there. Evidence: \\"The Rundown\\". [[ASIN:B001F1YJ4Q The Rundown]] Of course, that also had Rosario Dawson, Christopher Walken and Sean William Scott. And humor.head shots?! Yes, every single bullet fired caused exploding heads.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is awesome, I find it kind of addictive because u want to play more so you'll get more points. I just looooove this game and I only now bought it!! I would totally recommend this game to everyone! 132 GAMES IN 1, now that is amazing! &lt;3 : )
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Mind numbing fun. Like the change in cities every 4 weeks. Makes for new challenges when you think you are bored with the game.
B005FISBTO|5.0|It's Dexter, we enjoy the plot and the cast of characters although some of them are a little garish. Definitely not for children.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really hope  you get  the new  levels<br /> I'm was addicted to the game and each level got harder and harder
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun because of all of the weird games in it. why I rate it 4stars is because the games take a lot of time to get that is why I rate it 4stars
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Love Nemo and the scenery will not disappoint. Don't waste your pearls speeding up the plant process or to open trunks..pearls are very hard to come by and this game does everything to encourage you to buy more. Music is nice and relaxing but if you're looking for action this won't be the game for you..I can see it getting boring but enjoy it for now.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|The Matrix is easily my favorite movie of all times. I can use it as a metaphor to discuss religion, politics, education, and so on. What is reality? What is illusion? This film illustrates the fact that the greatest majority of our population will never know.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I was impressed by the quickness in delivering my products just like it was promised. I am very happy with my order. Great service Amazon.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is so much fun and it is almost like having a real horse and the graphics are great too I love it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|that is a great game.  The only thing is that u don't get many bimands. But it is still a great game.
B004T4LUPW|1.0|I installed Calengoo and it removed all of my events from my G-Mail calendar.<br />Next I now have duplicates, of anything I install now,
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I LOVE this series.  This book wasn't as good as the other ones bit it was still good.  Kept me on the edge of my seat!!!! I didn't like the ending though!!!! I can't wait for the next one!!!!!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|For a  grown up to have this much fun with a kids game, I certainly didn't think it was possible. One thing I'm not liking is the push to buy pearls. I know you need to pay the bills but not all of us have a lot of extra money.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I always enjoy reading Khaled's novels, but I thought this was &#34;predictable&#34; in terms of his style and formation of story line...Still, it is wonderfully written and worth the time.
0307476464|5.0|I hadn't read anything by Murakami before, but am glad that I took the time to jump into these 1,000+ pages. The book captures all of the best elements of romance, sci-fi, fantasy, philosophy, mystery, and culture all into one. The characters were introduced methodically and were well developed. Good read!
B00742GBDM|5.0|I loved this movie and if I'd had time, I would have watched it 2-3 more times. I wish the rental period for Amazon was longer, like it is for Netflix. Great movie.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Old or young this game will keep you entertained for hours. Its a race to get the kindle at the end of the day. My daughter and I love this game.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I find I spend time thinking when I play with this app.  It is to me much like doodling where I do free thinking while drawing to work things out in my head.  I like the way I see old math problems solved or physics of colors work on the pad.  I like the play of color have started using layers of colors to show things.  I start on the background then work up to the foremost top subjects.  Not spending even if I upgrade it is less than 2 dollars so my do that right now I am enjoying the basic one I got for free.
1781162646|5.0|I love to read anything Stephen King writes, you can never go wrong with a good book from him, loved it
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is so fun i play it all the time and its realy addicting you will not regret getting this game!!!
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|Since 6/27/13 update this app won't open in Kindle Fire OR HTC Evo. Please fix cuz someone at Backflip Studios sure dropped the ball on this update. Boo!
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite CDs - Frank Ocean is absolutely original, soulful and interesting. I listen to this... every day!
B005R32L66|5.0|I have recently purchased a tablet for convenience. My laptop does not have a camera...I have met some great ladies from Israel while on a cruise...we stayed in touch via facebook. It was suggested by them  that I get Skype so that they can see my face now and then. So being technologically challenged, I gave it a try! I must say that I was impressed with the concept of &#34;Skype&#34;. Never had it before, and so I downloaded it on my 9&#34;tablet. And now we communicate at least twice a week by video chat! Sometimes the call &#34;drops&#34; but I heard this often happens even on cell phones, so I don't mind. It is so great to see the smiles on my new friends face if only for a little while! Thanks!<br />Ms. Berneta Ingram, USA!
B0049J2BSM|4.0|It was good movie, getting ready for MU tonight...Be interesting, I wonder if there will be more characters from the Big Lebowski?
B0044C5SCU|5.0|When Fringe was on TV I missed most of the episodes or dropped in in the middle of an episode or two.  The plot is far too convoluted for the casual viewer.  Advise:  watch each season from beginning to end and you will be hooked.  Excellent science fiction.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Saw documentary about &#34;Sugarman&#34; and realized what a genius Rodriguez truly was in the 60s and wonder if he was so good the so called music industry did not want competition for Bob Dylan? Who knows. His music was so pure, yet the lyrics so powerful. To this day, his soul was never for sale, and he has always so true to his music. Rodriguez is still to this day, such a humble, kind and compassionate human being and loved by so many. I would buy all his music and pay any amount to see him in concert.
159668139X|4.0|I may be expanding my expectations regarding weaving after I read through this book.  I am looking forward to getting started.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Same as my review for Coming from Reality - the very, very best. Would highly recommend to buy all Rodriguez music.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Made me laugh out loud repeatedly. Observations about real life were so accurate and hilarious.  I really enjoyed it immensely.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|As someone said, starts no where and leads no where.<br /><br />The only positives people mention about this movie are the cinematography/artistic production. That's crap for rating it above what it is, a solid 1-2 stars.<br /><br />It had me hooked at a few points and I was eager to see what was coming next but like stated before, leads no where.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|We luv it it good sorry bad English we Australian it fun ond entertaining so dank u for making it us and our mates luv it it's ausome
B00C7KYXHW|2.0|I just couldn't get into this show. I really tried but my mind would wonder when I was watching it. Too much dialog.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well first off I wanna say that subway surfers is a great game I only got it because my friends had it but when I started playing it I was hooked the fact that you can earn your own money is great you can also collect keys without wasting money and if you complete the weekly hunts you move to a new country or state first it's the flamingos then the towers and so on you can also connect with Facebook to compete against your friends I can go on forever but my point is this is an awesome game you should download it goodbye
0767805712|5.0|this movie is just terrific! It really hits home on certain aspects of what the world could turn out to be and I love everyone's character.  I have watched this movie about six times and every time I watch it I either see something new or just understand it a little better.  There is a sort of plot twist in it which changes the movie from being seemingly predictable to just pure amazing!
B008K6HN8I|4.0|This app has everything I could ask for in a file manager, and would get five stars except that it doesn't connect to any cloud services (never leaves &quot;Loading authentication page...&quot;).
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so much fun! It never gets old.  I like that there are daily and weekly challenges to keep you interested!
B000FCKBCU|5.0|I laughed aching, snorting belly laughs through the whole book! Thank you, Sophie, for such hilarious entertainment. Trust me, I'll be back for more of your books.
B0030DBGXY|5.0|This is &#34;the one.&#34; I own most of the Cold Steel fixed blade line at this point and a few folders as well. This is my daily carry blade. It is, quite possibly, the perfect knife. In fact, I routinely refer to it as Goldilocks. It really is just right. I typically use high carbon only blades and this is the first VG-San Mai III blade I have purchased. The idea of steel laminate seemed both a marketing ploy and something that just aspires to be mediocre. But now that I have put this through its paces, I have to say it is anything but average.<br /><br />I use this knife every day. I keep it spotless clean and strop daily. I've used it as an ice pic, pry, box cutter, bottle cap opener, cut cans with it, batoned through 5&#34; logs, dug through rocky dirt, used it in the water, in the sand, used it to cut meat, cut plastic, cut bone, the list goes on. Its not just used, it is routinely used for things that would make most knife enthusiasts cringe. I abuse this thing without a second thought. Like I said, its my daily carry piece. Its what I use.<br /><br />I clean it with mild soap and water usually right after each use, but sometimes it needs to wait a few hours. I try to strop it every day. Its still shave sharp. In fact, in spite of the soft outer shell of the san mai III its relatively blemish free considering the hard heavy use.<br /><br />Make no mistake, I'm sure I'm going to have to sharpen it at some point. But I'm shocked that I haven't had to by now. I've done some pretty stupid things to this edge and not a chip is to be found.<br /><br />Its the right size plus a half inch which really lets it perform like a larger knife (recon scout) but its slightly thinner (3/16&#34;) and lighter which lets it excel at bushcraft. Not having to oil this thing really puts the icing on the cake for me. All in all, this is one hell of a knife. My advice, add Goldilocks to your collection.
B00AFPVPDG|1.0|the book offers a basic 10 steps to acquire skills. Like \\"choose a topic of interest\\".<br />The rest of the book consists of some basic intros into various \\"skills\\". The descriptions are very easy to read, but they are not a great tutorial and they do not show anything special about learning.<br /><br />Yoga<br />His wife is a yoga teacher and his \\"secret\\" is, that he makes her show him some bends. great. The real problem about yoga is not that there is anything complicated about the exercises. Its the very very frustrating fact that it takes weeks and weeks just to touch your toes with your fingers - something he could do when he started. So he doesn't even understand why yoga can be hard in the first place. And he had 15 lessons before he even \\"started\\" to learn it so, yes, of course it was easy for him.<br /><br />Programming<br />I am a computer programmer and believe me the first 20 hours in a new programming language are the easy part. It gets much more complicated once you leave tutorial land and are stuck in a project of yours. So, again, he only talks about the easy part (learning the basics) and leaves out the hard part. And again he already did know the basics about programming - something my students have a surprisingly hard time to understand.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />The hardest part about learning is not learning: The hard parts are<br />- forgetting<br />- sticking with it for weeks and months<br />Two topics that are not really present in his 20 dedicated hours approach. So the book is actually fun to read, but it will not help you learn anything faster.
B0047DVHV2|5.0|Given my dislike for using drugs recreationally, I'm somewhat surprised that after reading Keef's book I really like the guy.<br />What a life, what a musician (I'm enjoying trying to play some of your songs in open G), what a frack'n good story teller.<br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who lived before the 80's, anyone who loves the guitar, of course any Stones fan & anyone who is interested in learning about a pivotal time in our social & musical history. Don't retire Keith.
B00005JKGO|5.0|I bought this DVD version of La Dolce Vita when it became available in 2004. The two issues with this DVD set are the subtitles, they are very badly placed on the screen; and the translation, which is inaccurate and overly simplified. There are many other 5 star great reviews here on Amazon for La Dolce Vita so I won't waste your time repeating how wonderful La Dolce Vita is. But I will mention things to look for in the film: the origination of the Paparazzi, the first Elvis impersonator ever, the use of openly gay characters, is that a water tower in the background of Steiner's apartment balcony view of the sky or is it a mushroom cloud (?), and the film score written by Nino Rota. Fellini won multiple Academy Awards for La Dolce Vita. Many of his other films made previous to La Dolce Vita and after were also nominated and won Academy Awards. Today, La Dolce Vita isn't shocking as it was in the early 60's when I first saw it. But the films message is very meaningful today because our USA society has reached the same level of shallow decadence and narcissism that appeared in Rome in the late 1950's.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game can be addicting, so user be warned. LOL. I have alot of fun keeping up with this app, but I wish that it didnt take so long for ceratin items like more real estate to be created when it is purchased. And the increases in land prices as you buy more property gets out of hand.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun little puzzle game, but fairly easy and a bit on the short side. Overall, worth picking up and you can't beat the price.
B00CBKLO52|5.0|I enjoy playing this app when i have a little extra time on hand. It soothes the itch for a little bit of RC flying. The helicopter is a bit wild on control, but if you can get it together, it will do as you wish.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book had a lot of twists,and turns which you hoped for a happy ending but it wasn't there.I would recommend it for an adult and young adult to like reading this book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Couldn't wait to get Season 3 to see what was happening in everyone's lives, and I wasn't disappointed. Now we have Season 1, 2 and 3 -- which we'll try to re-watch (for 3rd time) before Season 4 starts. Love them!!!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I read several reviews before purchasing the book. Several were openly critical. That there wasn't enough personal information, etc. to the contrary I found that there was more detail than I expected. I also realizes that even Steve Jobs may have had his issues he still allowed his genius to come through.
B0030ZOYJ0|4.0|.... Oh yes we can!<br />Have not seen the original tv anime series so these films are an amalgamation of several episodes from what I gather. Made the mistake of watching the second film (v2.22) first, which made little sense! But watching this one filled the blanks (more or less) There's still some major plot points that are not covered, though internet searches would help perhaps!.<br />The artwork/animation is fine, English dub is very good (I'm yet to be anywhere near competent in Japanese) Voice actors reprise their roles throughout multiple versions of this &#34;juggernaut&#34; of the anime world, which is a good thing.<br />Solid film/ good voice acting and interesting concepts, it is worth it to watch (several times at least to understand things more hopefully) :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed it very much. I do wish there was a way on my Kindle Fire where you could leave it for some time and not have to start all over.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love anything Steve Carell is in. I would recommend this everyone! Can't wait to see Despicable Me 2! Rent it!
B0089LOKHG|5.0|This was the best conclusion to this MAGNIFICENT trilogy. I did wish it had more to it but it's a good thing that Lauren Oliver didn't because it explained the true meaning of life, you never know what might happen and you just have to wait and see
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Ha i knew it, anyway! What a wonderful story, like with the rest of the series, the end makes me long for more to come... What a wonderful feeling, maybe next book we get to know more about the arrows!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|not to bad of a game, 10 levels goes quick tho can't wait for more levels to come. little easy and a little hard trying to figure out what you need to look for
B0090KZDSK|3.0|We waited sooooo long for this book and when it finally did arrive I was disappointed. I had pre-ordered this book so the wait was ridiculous. How long does it take to write a sequel to the novel especially when others were written and published in between.<br />Questions from the previous book were answered. Which was good.<br />I agree with others that its being stretched out with all the new leads. I also agree that a trilogy cannot be stretched out to book 4 or 5. Come on.... I had enjoyed the other books and recommended them highly to my friends as being better than &#34;50 Shades of Grey&#34; but now it seems that I may have to change my recommendation..<br />I was very annoyed at the ending.  It was all wrong and now there is to be another book. How long do we wait for that????
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love twitter and I can love it more on my kindle fire. I think its perfect I would recommend it to anyone.
B008J05EL8|4.0|All the city parks in the city of Merida Yucatan Mexico have free WiFi and so when working with a client. we can always stop for something to drink  go sit in one of the many beautiful parks and make notes to send to the office. and it is called work!!!
B0086449YA|5.0|As usual, Knopfler's music spans genres and there is something for every mood. His lyrics, they may actually make you do a little reading (I know what a Border Reiver is and who Lonnie Donegan is thanks to MK). Every time Knopfler puts one out, I think that it may be his best. Maybe that's just because his music & lyrics are always fresh and interesting.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|The BBC always have excellent programing and I enjoy catching up on series I have missed previously. Will continue to watch more.
B0001Z37HM|3.0|This could have been a better movie than it is.  As a swords and armor film, Arnold Swarzenegger as Kalidor was right in there picking up where he left off in Conan the Barbarian.  Sandahl Bergman as the evil queen Gerden, I believe, was miscast.  I liked her better as the much sweeter Valeria.  Brigitte Nielsen as Red Sonja is the tall athletic warrior is sexy and great looking but has some really bad lines as do most of the other characters in the flick.<br /><br />The plot is a quest to destroy the powerful green orb and vanquish the evil queen Gerden.  Supporting actors, Paul Smith (as Falkon) and Prince Tarn add little to the plot.  It might have been better if they were left out.  There are many fight scenes, however, there is no gore as in the Conan films.  The sets were elaborate and well made as was the costuming.  The score was not overly impressive and didn't add much to the emotional impact.  I think that the talent of the actors, while not overly strong, was not fully explored as it might have been.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good and entertaining film that could be enjoyed once and then forgotten.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this game but I'm bummed there are only 10 levels available right now. hopefully there will be more levels soon.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I like it but I wish you did not have to pay $9.99 to unlock all items. I recommend this for kids who like to play dress up or do makeup.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm so glad I watched it. I cried, laughed and now can't wait for season 4.  It was definitely worth the time watching it.
B0095NCXKI|1.0|With all the positive reviews of this show, I may have to study whether TV can cause Stockholm Syndrome. That was a joke I thought off the top of my head, and it had more substance anything I saw in the show. 2 Broke Girls biggest problem is that it thinks its more clever than it actually is. The show thinks its a symbol of economic struggle and women's rights, but it does so little to let the characters express themselves as people instead of sexual objects. Any substance is thrown out because the characters are only there to recite sexual innuendo to each other. I will give Beth Behrs some credit. She is trying so hard in this role to make Caroline more than the writing wants her to be. It is to the point that she overacts to try to sell the joke. Kat Dennings seems so lost. She has no idea what to do with the character. It is like she is afraid to let Max have an expression because it will destroy the tough-as-nails character. The socioeconomic aspect of the show is almost non-existent. They never really seem to be struggling like real people in the same situation. I would give the show credit for that if it had the talent to at least do that right. Unfortunately, any sense of realism (which the station heavily marketed before airing) is not there. There's no point in talking about the obvious sex jokes, racial stereotypes, or the overly-padded script. My opinion will not change your mind. The only people who will look at this will be the people who already hate the show. That's what I did before I saw that very few people actually dislike this show. I just want to add another voice to the minority.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|She did it again! A great read that had you wanting more! Can't wait for the next book in the series to come out! Enjoy
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Love love this game. Could not put it down. Never got bored. Helped pass the time away. Very entertaining. Definitely one of my favorite games.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|What an amazing album. I was enamored with a couple songs I had heard on the radio and had to have more. I can tell you this album is easily one of my top 10 favorites of all time. The lyrics intrigue me and the melodies seduce me! I can't get enough. I will be buying the next album in a heartbeat.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Period pieces are always iffy for me but this movie was so well done.  We loved stepping back in time with all the characters.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|She promised three books. What a lie. Sylvia day is making stupid problems to for couple who should have had a happy ending by now. Way to sell out. She certainly doesn't care about readers anymore only more money. I'm done with Sylvia day.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|This book had a fast and exciting beginning! The middle was kind of slow, but the author made up for it at the end.
0553382179|5.0|Thank you, Fly Lady! Some of us need structure in order to keep things orderly, and that is what is offered in Sink Reflections.
0061726834|5.0|I loved the Hunger Games and so I took a walk down the \\"teen\\" aisle to see if there might be any other interesting books that might feel similar. When I stumbled upon this one it peaked my interest. I was not disappointed. This book & the two following it in the series kept my interest from page one all the way through the series. These were well written and definitely worth my time...and that's saying a lot since I'm a mother of two and own my own business!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like that if has a little challenge to it. Wish it had more floors and was just a little more challenging or had more things to find and solve to get to the next floor. Hopefully there will be more rooms coming soon. I know I'll play them and so will my boyfriend. He totally got into this game.

B00CHRB9RM|5.0|First of all, I just found out about this new set yesterday. I ordered it here and decided to try out the Prime membership trial with free two-day shipping. It came in ONE day, today, just an hour and a half ago! Man I popped the live disc #4 into the player and MAN what a sound! Incredible mix! Sounds even better than Fillmore East! And what a beautiful package the whole thing comes in, with pictures and booklet. Very well done! It was a great album when I first bought it 40 years ago. Forty? Can that be possible? Indeed, it was right after I graduated from high school, maybe even that same week in June, 1973. Man, we Allman Brothers fans were still hurting from the loss of Duane when Berry got killed on HIS motorcycle during the recording of this album. How did the Brothers manage to go on and create this masterpiece after that? Incredible, but they did. And then they went on tour with new members Chuck and Lamar, and the power and beauty of that tour is captured perfectly on these bonus live CDs. The Brothers reinvented themselves with this album, and it became their biggest-seller ever. Those guys had a lot of soul to be able to pull this off, I'm telling you! Chuck Leavell is incredible here; his acoustic piano works perfectly alongside Dickie's guitar. And Lamar Williams clicked perfectly in the bass spot that Brother Berry left behind. This version of the Allman Brothers was just as good as the original, in its own way. Of course nobody or nothing could ever replace Duane Allman, and indeed they never even tried. By some mark of genius they chose a whole new direction with a piano player instead of another guitarist. And boy did it work! This great album, both studio and live, is testament to that. Though the band has changed and evolved over the years, including the current long-running edition featuring that original two-guitar sound made famous by the original lineup, they were like this only for a little while, so that makes this wonderful set of CDs all the more priceless. THIS was The Allman Brothers! Fantastic package, a must-buy for fans who remember this era so well like I do. Indeed, I only saw the band with this lineup, twice, in 1973. Never saw Duane or Berry, never saw any of the versions to follow this one. Saw them play in front of 40,000 people at old RFK Stadium in DC with The Grateful Dead. Great show, great musicians. So glad this great album has finally been re-mastered and given this new life. Bliss!the more priceless. THIS was The Allman Brothers!

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|So, I was looking forward to this book as I enjoyed the first two books and unfortunately discovered that I grossly overpaid.  The ending was awful.  I feel completley ripped off.  The ending made no sense at all. I won't get sucked into the rest of her series.  Sylvia Day is taking advantage of her readers.  I am so disappointed.
B005LAIH2M|2.0|This is the kind of movie I usually enjoy, but I couldn't find anything to like about it. Well, maybe some of the special effects with the witches were good, but in general, it was a dismal flop. Jeremy Renner must have owed somebody a big favor and gotten roped into this loser. In this version, Hansel and Gretel have very modern-looking weapons (never explained). Language is modern (dialogue is lame and uninspired), outfits are corny costume medieval, and there are no twists or turns in the plodding plot. Hansel and Gretel have a weird incesty thing going on. Hansel starts to have a relationship with a beautiful white witch, who dies (sorry for the \\"spoiler\\") and no one seems terribly upset about it, least of all Hansel, who can't wait to be back with his sister, I guess. Creeeeeepy! I haven't seen such a bad movie since Her Highness. Please, no sequel for this one. Two stars for some okay special effects.
1442419814|5.0|Son is reading as part of advanced reading class in middle school, my daughter read it as well, they both liked it and enjoyed the series!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|My most anxiously awaited release in years and it did not disappoint. Others have done a great job of breaking down the album track by track so read their reviews. If you are thinking about buying this, just do it.
030758836X|5.0|More twists and turns than a mountain road. My feelings about the &#34;gone&#34; girl changed multiple times throughout the story. Great summer read!
B006IYG5HE|5.0|A little confusing at first, but written so well that I wanted to piece the puzzle together as quickly as possible.  Excellent characters, good twists and turns that kept me intrigued the whole time.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|An interesting story.  It starts out in the days when Afghanistan was a viable country, primitive but peaceful.  Then as time passes the country becomes less and less hospitable.
B000W93CHC|4.0|I chose this book be cause it was the sequel to &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; which was a great book.<br />Well worth reading.<br />It is an amazing book full of intrigue, and shows the problems between religion and the ordinary people.  Which still exists today.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is one of the Best HBO series in my opinion.  It has many twists and makes you want more at the end of every show.
B001I0T92Q|1.0|This adapter worked fine until I removed it from my PSP for the first time, then the casing started to split open.  Now the SD cards won't stay in at all.  Do not buy this if you value your data!
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Very nicely done it is hard to believe the things that happened back then. The story line is great, and the actors really capture it all.
0767903374|4.0|For those with HSP traits, this book is great.  However, she is trying to get you to be out in the mainstream crowd which is a huge trigger for depression for a lot of HSPs.  It's something to read bit by bit and step away and come back too.  I am applying it and I've seen my life become easier with naps, listening to my body, more self-reflection, and embracing these traits that make HSPs better artists.  If you hate self-reflection or you don't want to go into your past experiences, don't read this book.  I highly recommend this book as it shows HSPs they are not alone.  This book has helped me see my traits are something I can't help but I certainly can have a happier life.  There is a free online HSP test Elaine N. Aron, Ph.D. offers so I'm including it here:  [...]<br /><br />You'll have to copy/paste.  Enjoy
B009AMANBA|5.0|It is a good movie, gave some insight into Mary that I never really thought of.  Don't know why they could not of cast an American Actor to play Lincoln.
0823016714|4.0|This book covers male and female facial expressions from teen to senior citizen.  I will keep it in my library along with the other figure/head drawing books as a great guide.  I highly recommend this book.

The Goblins are funny and well done for the time period in which this was made.<br /><br />I'd love to see a part 2 with David Bowie again<br /><br />Great movie - Worth Owning!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Much different than I thought. Not much into zombies, but I loved the social commentary. Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Very original.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The game is great to play when every you need to waste time but after a while it gets addicting so be careful lol.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great way to pass the time. The puzzles get harder as you go, but are totally doable. The music is a little boring as it never changes.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this game is pretty fun I am nine and me and my sisters and my mom play it is fun
B002NNA9N0|4.0|Great actors and well adapted from theater.  Has a ply feel to it.  Love the actors and do a good job. Alec Boldwin, I thought when i first saw the movie years ago, had a quick, dramatic speech in the beginning that set the tone.  Now I see it as &#34;hokey&#34; and over-acted.  I like his comedy, but every time i see him trying to sell hard drama, i just keep waiting for the punch line somewhere.<br /><br />Overall still a must-see if you love cinema, but I don' think the film ages as well as some of the individual actors have.
0425241505|4.0|I bought this book at my favorite local used bookstore, A Novel Idea, because it was featured in my Paranormal Romance Book Club that is also featured at the bookstore. From the cover, I was a little afraid there was going to be some beastiality of sorts featured in the book that was going to disturb me to the extent that it did in the Anita Blake series. I am a fan of were-animals (or Wyr in the case of this book) but I would prefer if their love scenes are between their human forms and not their animal.<br /><br />I was surprised to find that there wasn't really any of that in this book. I breathed a sigh of relief and allowed myself to thoroughly enjoy the book. I found myself finding Pia adorable and quick-witted and Dragos's domineering persona was interesting to watch.<br /><br />Pia and Dragos's relationship was unusual.  Pia breaks into the dragon's stronghold and steals from his possessions which throws Dragos into a rage. Then when he finally catches up with the fleeing Pia he basically falls head-over-heels in love with her. It was funny to watch the male protagonist in this story be the completely smitten party while the female was the more rational minded. Often it is the other way around in typical romance titles.<br /><br />The story moved very quickly, in a matter of days the two are in love and fighting against the ultimate evil of the Dark Fae King. In fact, the story moved fast in all aspects. I would have liked a little more fluff in the story (yes, fluff). The transitions from one event to the next seemed jammed together and not well described. In one part a character gets knocked back off their feet in an attack and the next apparently it was an arrow that lodged in their chest and was the cause of the fall? Uhm, okay then. That could have been worked out a bit better. Also, the story had a lot of leading up to the climax of the story and then a really quick fall. Most of the story is rising action with virtually no falling action on the other end.<br /><br />Aside from the quick and slightly confusing layout of the story, I loved the story overall. I liked watching Dragos learn to love (he didn't even know the meaning of the word before Pia), I loved that there was a comic relief character, and I loved the introduction to the Wyr side of the Elder Races. I hope in the subsequent books I will get to see more of the other Elder Races such as the Light Fae, Dark Fae, and so forth.<br /><br />This was a good little paranormal romance read. Although there were some criticisms and issues I had, I was sucked in quickly.

I liked watching Dragos learn to love (he didn't even know the meaning of the word before Pia), I loved that there was a comic relief character, and I loved the introduction to the Wyr side of the Elder Races. I hope in the subsequent books I will get to see more of the other Elder Races such as the Light Fae, Dark Fae, and so forth.    This was a good little paranormal romance read. Although there were some criticisms and issues I had, I was sucked in quickly.

B004S3MB2U|2.0|I had expected more.  I'm sticking with the free RpnCalc 2.15.  The layout wasn't particularly appealing.  It's a good start, but better options are available.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|This is a wonderful CD . Alice in Chains is showing their staying power as a band and great musicians.<br />As you listen to &#34;The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here &#34; you can hear the maturity of the band, yet still keeping the edgy music that brought them to fame in the early days. Great Job AIC!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is exactly the type of point and click puzzle game that I love. It's challenging but if/when you decide to go to the hints, they don't let you get stuck. My only criticism is the length of gameplay--way too short! I attribute my disappointment to how awesome the game was, though, thus the 5 star rating. Gimme more rooms!
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|The movie was full of action.. The witches were fun to watch. The movie looks like it will end early but do not be fooled
159463176X|3.0|And The Mountains Echoed by Khaled Hosseini<br /><br />This book is best described as a series of short stories, intertwined by the fact that the characters are somehow related and going from 1949 until present.<br /><br />The first story is about two siblings, Abdullah and Pari, Saboor's children.  Their mother died in childbirth when Pari was born and they shared a link that was quite strong.  After starting the book with a story told by Saboor about a din who stole children in poor villages, Sabbor sells Pari to Suleiman and Nabhi Wahdati in Kabul, a rich couple.<br /><br />Saboor Marries Parwana as his second wife and the next story is about how Parwana and her twin sister, Masoona share their life.  Masoona is the beautiful one, whereas Parwana is just plain: so at age 17 Parwana pushes her twin sister off a tree, thus crippling her.  Parwana is thus forced to take care of her sister until Masoona frees her from her duty so she can marry Saboor.<br /><br />Another story is about Nabi, Masoona and Parwana older brother, who finds employment with the Wahdati in Kabul as a chauffeur and cook.  Come to find out, Suleiman Wahdati was in love with Nabi, but because that was forbidden, Suleiman just hires him for his company.  As Suleiman has a stroke, his wife abandons him with the daughter, Pari, whom they bought from Saboor, and Nabi is forced to care for Suleiman until he dies; thus their love story is told.<br /><br />Another story is about cousins Idris and Timus, who were neighbors of the Wahdati's in Kabul.  They come to Kabul in 2002 to reclaim their old house, which they can rent to the foreigners for a lot of money.  Idris meets a little girl at a Kabul hospital - Roshana - who needs a surgery to heal her from an ax wound to her head.  Idris is a physician himself and he bonds with the little girl, promising to take her to the US where he works to have her surgery.  Unfortunately once he goes back to the US, he just forgets about Afghanistan and the girl.<br /><br />Another story is about Nila Wahdati and her adoptive daughter, Pari as they live and grow in Paris.  Nila is beautiful and a poet; she has plenty of lovers and makes Pari feel guilty. They even share a lover and Pari has to take care of her mother until she kills herself.<br /><br />Another story is about the warlords of the new Afghanistan.<br /><br />Another story is about a Greek plastic surgeon, Dr. Markos Varvaris, who's from Tinos, an island in Greece.  He is currently inhabiting the Wahdati's residence in Kabul which is now owned by Nabi. It tells the story of a friend of his, Thalia who was the daughter of his mother's best friend.  Thalia was abandoned in Tinos because she had a terrible disfiguration on her face and she grows up like a sister and ends up taking care of Markos' mother.<br /><br />The last story is about Pari, daughter of Abdullah and Sultana.  Pari is so named after Abdulla's sister, the one he lost in Kabul.  Pari has dreamt of that sister from birth and is finally contacted by her aunt, Pari, who wishes to visit her.  The aunt found out about her because Dr. Markos called her to let her know her uncle, Nabi, had instructed she should be found.  It's from this that she learns who she really is and is able to contact her brother who now lives in northern California.  Unfortunately her brother has had a stroke and can't recognize his sister.<br /><br />The stories are written either from the first or third person point of view - a thing I found annoying - and each one is more depressing than the prior one.  I love Mr. Hosseini's prose and his ability to story tell, but I wish he found something more pleasant to write about.r /><br />Another story is about Nila Wahdati and her adoptive daughter, Pari as they live and grow in Paris.

B0007PAMR4|4.0|First off this is a film that is not for everyone, which I think is one of the reasons critics were so unfairly tough on \\"DUNE\\".  The plot is complex and there are a lot of characters.  This is also one of those movies you have to watch a couple of times to fully take in.  If you have a short attention span then I don't recommend this one, but if you enjoy a good scifi/fantasy, focus and give \\"DUNE\\" a chance.<br /><br />I enjoy both cuts of this film and think it nails the most key elements from the book.  The only problem I have with the Extended cut is that it's missing scenes that are in the theatrical cut.  Most notably the scenes establishing the vile Baron Harkonnen on Giedi Prime.  An extended cut should be the theatrical cut plus the additional scenes.  The theatrical cut cuts to the chase of the overall tale, but the extended cut gives you more story, fills in the gaps, and runs almost an hour longer.<br /><br />There are also some excellent performances from some well known actors here too.  Kenneth McMillan steals the show in his scenes as the evil Baron Harkonnen.  The film also sports an outstanding musical score by the 80's band Toto.<br /><br />Although he's distanced himself from it I think this is one of David Lynch's best films.  Now if only Universal would release both versions of this 1984 classic on Bluray as a set.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Irish humor! Great sense of morality. A libitarian Druid. I like tho author. Recommend this series highly, & I just started it.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|When this book came out, it was considered one of the best spy novels of all time. And this adaptation is done very well. The suspense is well played, and to piece together the storyline as you go is also done very well. Knowing you are going through the past in the present keeps it moving right along. And all the characters are well played by the actors who portray them. And what a fantastic cast it is, led by Gary Oldman, who plays George Smiley to a tee. I highly recommend this to all who are looking to add a great spy movie to your collection.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|This review is more about the changes I have seen with the apps that Alawar Entertainment Inc. have now been putting out. The first app I bought of theirs was The Mystery of Treasure Island, and it was awesome!!! This app was also awesome (why the rating is a 4), and it was a great app for a great price. Both apps have stunning graphics, intriguing things to do, and well, just plain addictive to play.<br />But over the last week or so, I have noticed the new apps they have come up with, and it broke my heart. I couldn't wait for more apps by Alawar after the ones I had purchased and played, but it seems like they have changed in a way like so many others. Most of their new apps cost more,  but not unreasonably so. But here is the kicker: almost ALL of their new apps not only have to be purchased, but THEY HAVE IN-APP PURCHASING AS WELL!!!!!!! Are you KIDDING ME?????????<br />After purchasing the app, they want EVEN MORE MONEY WITH IN-APP PURCHASING!!!!!!! I think this is the one thing that will stop me, as well as many others, from buying an app. In apps like these, you can choose not to purchase anything, but then you either miss out on the &quot;cool stuff&quot; to have in the game, hints/help in the game, unlocking more of the game, etc.<br />Whatever happened to purchasing a game ONCE and the game being all there and being able to earn things/unlock things in the game by just simply playing it?????<br />I thought that Alawar was going to be this kind of company after I had gotten these first apps and I was like &quot;FINALLY!!!&quot; Now, I am so disappointed.<br />Alawar Entertainment Inc., PLEASE DON'T CHANGE FROM YOUR ORIGINAL STYLE!!!!!!!! On the first of your apps, there are MANY, MANY PEOPLE WHO LOVED YOUR APPS (just check the number of people who wrote GOOD reviews)!!<br />On your newer apps, I know they haven't been out too long, but it seems like there isn't the same response as on your older ones. I believe a lot of people feel like I do, and don't like the added in-app purchasing.<br />I mean, why mess up your AWESOME apps with something that is going to deter people from buying them??????? You can make more money in the long run by selling more of the apps themselves than by in-app purchasing that turns people to other apps that don't have it.
B0086449YA|5.0|I sense that Mr. Knopfler really enjoys doing ballads. What is enjoyable for us is that he does a real good job at telling them through song. This is a two-disc set, so you do double your music for your money. Make sure you check out &#34;Corned Beef City&#34; and &#34;Got To Have Something&#34;. If you are a Mark Knopfler fan, add this to all the other music that Mark has done. You will not be disappointed.
0345529057|5.0|Been watching the series and love it. Love how they stick to the books. Now I need to finish the books before the series ends.
B000002KAT|5.0|After listening to this for the first time in a long time (I never had the album), I could understand why many people have recommended this recording. Van gives his all, and it shows in real emotion and excitement. He has since moved on to bigger and better things, but this will still be a true testament in  what Van Morrison is all about. I recommend this recording, as well as &#34;Moondance&#34;.
B007REV4YI|5.0|One of the best james bond flicks, if not the best. Great action and humor as well as tying in the past
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Everybody had been on me to get this, saying that if you like music, you will like this. And they were right. And so were almost one billion people who have this, or have seen her perform, or who have listened to the radio. Every single cut off this recording is wonderful. I don't have to recommend this. I believe it is already made its mark.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Very entertaining movie and cannot wait for the second to be released. I was having a difficult time finding this movie in blue ray in local stores, so amazon was logical choice. I had to have a digital copy and was pleasantly surprised to find out that amazon gives you 24hr online rental with the purchase! Movie was exactly as described, but local shipping service had some issues!!!!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I love this movie and purchased it so that I could watch it over and over. Great story and great characters.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|IT HAS SO MUCH ROOM AND YOU CAN TAKE A WHOLE LOT OF PICTURES WITH THIS XD CARE ITS GREAT
B00992CF6W|5.0|mine craft is the most awesome game ever trust me<br />it's fun I could play it for hours it's so fun so please pick it for me
B009U9S6FI|5.0|this is something everyone should read. it makes you question your motives to life, and challenges you to find its true meaning
B0064MGU98|5.0|Good performances by Julianne Margulies and the entire cast; suspenseful writing and great camera work make this a series worth watching.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I did not find this book as compelling as the other two novels. I was &#34;hooked&#34; at the beginning, but began to lose interest as the characters multiplied and it became more of a soap opera. A good effort, but definitely not my favorite.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|The first book really captured my interest to the point that I couldn't put it down. The second one was slightly less intriguing, but still kept I still kept reading it. But the third book fell much lower than my expectations. Gone was the suspense and excitement and originality of the first book. This book felt like a fan fiction with little thought or reason to the plot.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Unbelievable book. Great read could not put it down. I bet you will see a movie about operation redwing in the future.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I am playing it on a normal kindle with 1.15 gb or whatever it is and the game plays excellent. You need to free up room on your SD card. Like me you probably tried deleting every game to no avail, so download a file finder like es file explorer. It will let you know where everything is going, and free room on your internal storage.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book was very good...not as intense as the selection....a bit slower in getting to the details but I still needed to know what's was next...a definite page turner!!!
B00D6M86RS|5.0|Luv this pinball app! Very addicting and awesome to play!!!  I love playing pinball and absolutely love marvel!! The best of both and works great on the Kindle Fire!
B00881PTRC|5.0|super fun game I just wish it had a bit more words involved in the gameplay but it's pretty entertaining regardless
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game. This is my favorite non Internet game I have. I play it all the time. You should get it!
B003UESJHE|5.0|Excellent movie. Love it. Love Colin firth. So happy he received an Oscar for his work in the movie. Helena Bonham Carter, and Geoffrey Rush, played their roles so very well. Helena looked queenly.
B00006F83Y|3.0|Bought it for the second cut &#34;No One Knows&#34; and was hoping there would be other cuts that I liked, but no such luck. I guess I'm just too old for the rest.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|This is a great concept, 3 in 1.  However I will not buy another one unless they revise S&H.  I bought 2 pens in 1 package and it came usps.  The S&H was $7.99!  I would not have bought it if I had been paying better attention.  The price of the pen is great but they make it up by gouging on S&H
B00992CF6W|5.0|good idea making minecraft on a mobile device! I love the updates! I'm a great fan of mojang and I would say to every one buy this app! its epic!
B00BAVJW8Y|5.0|Can't recommend it enough. First class look into how to apply design thinking to service based fields and organizations. Well organized and highly digestible.
0345529057|5.0|I'm reading this along with view the series on video and it's a great way of integrating the whole package!!
B005COO1X6|5.0|I have been avoiding Stephen King for years, because his books were too long for my taste and because I don't really like horror stories.  I stumbled across this short story and got it not knowing what to expect.  It was a great short story.  Could have been a little longer even to fill us in on some of the rest of the story.  I will consider some more of his stuff, having read this one.  I wouldn't call this a horror story, but maybe because I don't read them, I don't recognize them.
B007REV4T8|5.0|What can I say it's James Bond and Daniel Craig.  Bond is always great. Craig as Bond is more down to earth and realist.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great movie, outstanding cinematography, fine acting and great direction. This was a nail biter even though you know the outcome.
B000FBFN0Q|1.0|I always finish a book I start, even if I don't like the book. That said, I just had to stop reading this. I made it about 1/3 of the way through, just waiting for it to get better. I finally gave up. I did not like the characters and constantly reading the main characters insipid train of thought made me just want to slap her. Every time I picked up the book to read it, it just annoyed me and made me ask myself why I was wasting my time reading such drivel. Finally just thinking I had to finish what I started wasn't enough of a reason to keep reading this when I have so many other books waiting to be read.
B00CV5ZPA2|3.0|Its good.  But overhyped.  Its everything that he has done before all mashed together and thrown all over the place.  The songs that are so called &#34;different&#34; are the worst.  Best song &#34;Bound 2&#34;.  Classic Kanye feel.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I struggled with how many stars to give this one. In the beginning it would have been two. I thought it was OK but slow. The imagery is great but the story was slow and hard to follow. It jumps back and forth in time and I had to page back to remind myself where we were on the timeline. By the time I was half way through the book I was more engaged and enjoying it more. By 75% in I really liked it. In the end I enjoyed it and have recommended it to others but I still have some questions about what happened and how the characters fit together. I fluctuate between thinking I really liked the book and thinking it was just OK. I originally rated this 3 stars but now a few months later I have such positive reaction when thinking of this that I have bumped it to 4 stars.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Best book I've read in a really long time it's really a great story and shows true love can happen
B000VM9Z8K|3.0|This was a good time book.  It starts out like a  mystery and continues to bring you along. Hope you enjoy it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Why not get one app that does both work as a timer s well as a super alarm? I like the variety of sounds as well as the ease of operation. Five stars!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great 2nd book in a series. Had a good twist that makes me eager to read to last book in the trilogy.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Everything you expect from Weather Channel, on your Fire. Radar and option of multiple cities that you can keep as favorites.
B005EHILV4|4.0|I was looking for a USB mixer, something basic, and when I did my search settled on the XENYX 502.  Except it turned out that the 502 isn't a USB mixer.  I ordered this one while debating whether to return the other one.  I currently daisy chain the two together for home recording.  The 502 handles all my 1/4&#34; jack needs, and between the two I can plug in a pair of condensers for acoustic instruments.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app gives you more than just battery status; it also gives you running time for various uses you might be using your Fire for, i.e.,music, video, etc.<br />Easy to use, nice graffics.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We have enjoyed all three seasons of Downton Abbey!  The actors and actresses are perfectly suited to their roles.  Anyone fascinated by the British lifestyle of the past, will enjoy.  Character studies are well developed.  Gratuitous sex and violence are absent.<br />We are hoping they are filming season 4!!
B007BT0RKG|5.0|When they used a street in downtown Cleveland to shoot a movie, this app came in very handy! We also used it on our Amtrak trip.<br />The only thing, you have to load the states b4 you loose your internet connection.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Fathers' Day.  We both love it!  Not just a documentary; interviews, older and more recent video, and of course the phenomenal music of the Eagles.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Wonderful and magical story for the young of all ages. Disney outdid himself when he combined real actors and places with animated subjects.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this littlest pet shop game it's so much fun.  I even have a lot of the toys. This game is so cute. Love Love Love it!
B0049J2BSM|5.0|My kids love it and it also leaves something fun for adults that get stuck watching it with them. Pixar never disappoints.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|I read this as part of a book club list.  It was not what I expected, but there were some fascinating little tricks for memorizing those occasional lists.  Good discussion!
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|&#34;The Biology of Belief&#34; is absolutely amazing. Dr. Lipton's personal story of how he discovered that a person's happiness and joy spreads from cell to cell to help us maintain that happiness is fantastic. He explains the science without being too scientific; he puts it in layman's terms. It's truly an incredible journey and proves that we can all be happier than most people are.
B006N0YWGY|1.0|Dude no throttle its a stupid lame ass game. Steering is impossible and its a complete waste of time even considering downloading it
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|If you are a die hard you may have a bit of a hard time.  But if you are willing to give it a try you will love it.  The story keeps your attention and the actors are all great.  Give it a try you wont be disapointed
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|this game is way better than other flight Sims I play needs helicopters though otherwise it's a really great game
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|This represents queensryche as the band we all new and loved. .. Could not have selected a better lead singer then Todd and  hope this puts them back on the map..  rycnroll !!!
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Best music and best sound ever.  It was everything I expected and more.  I would of paid more for the CD if necessary.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|we had heard about Downton Abbey before but did not want to watch it unless we could see it from the beginning.We have now watched all three seasons and cannot wait for season 4.  It is truly an amazing show. The attention to detail,the period clothing,the castle,all are superb.We are immersed in the lives of these people. It is admittedly a soap opera but on such a grand scale.Do yourself a favor and savor this masterpiece. We are glad we did.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am so not into horror movies, never really have been. This particular show is soooo addicting. You have to know what happens next, so it gets you hooked. I guess after a while of watching this series, the less the Zombies seem impossible and that they become more real and believable.  Awesome show, check it out.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works well, easy to understand and use. Good help from Amazon on how to use and how to  download for this new user of the android.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Good game, fun to play, enjoy, able to be played by a three year old,<br />Family-friendly,  great for horse lovers<br />Nice
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Great album.  Can't get enough of the band.  Wish I had time to catch a show some day soon ya
0156027321|5.0|I purchased this book for my daughter. She is a rising senior and this book is required summer reading. She has found the book to be very useful both academically and practically.
B00CRS88IO|1.0|I quit after reading after a little over a third of the book.  It reads as if the author went to one of the early James Bond movies and decided to write a book from the experience.  It might have helped if he had used a fictional character instead of Ian Fleming.  Ian Fleming was actually involved in Naval Intelligence during the Second World War, but in a planning and support role, not as an active agent.  I also noted several minor inconsistencies in the book; by themselves they wouldn't have bothered me, but as they kept occurring it was just too much.  I don't know if I'll get my 99 cents back from Amazon or not, but I have requested it.<br /><br />About an hour later:  I just got an email from Amazon that they are refunding my 99 cents.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This is fun and I spend too long on it, but it takes ages to earn a decent no. of coins.<br /><br />Also minus a star for borring upgrade that has lost all my flamingos. I'm not happy
B00BD62X14|5.0|I don't know a word of French but love listening to Carla Bruni sing.  She has a very sweet delivery of her songs.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|This is cute, I have some trouble collecting money bags but crashing into things amuses me. For all those people with kindles complaining about the touch controls, I have a kindle and u can choose tilt mode.
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, as I do most of this author's work. This book gives good insight into what drives the mysterious Councillor Krychek.
B00B29J0I6|1.0|I like the game.  But I'm so frustrated by the interruptions that I don't want to play anymore.  It takes all the fun out of it.  Is there some way to turn those notifications off??  I've looked and can't seem to find a way.  If I could turn those off and go back to playing uninterrupted, then I would give it five stars.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|excellent book.<br />I am a dog owner, and since reading this book, I feel ,I understand, and even love him more since reading this book.<br />I have relaxed more about, letting him wander into the living room, even if his hair goes all over the place.<br />He is 11yrs old, so he may not be with me much longer. Whatever time he has left, because of this book, our relationship will just get stronger.<br />`he has been a loyal friend to our family , and seen us through many things as we raised our family
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I personally think that Facebook is awesome you can talk to anyone anywhere and you can talk to friends that moved that's why I think Facebook is awesome
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I haven't seen this one since I was a kid. Needed some light reading for a trip to the island. Perfect. Even if you read it before, still great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a awesome game used to your ability you can be week and still can play doesn't matter the age just matters how determined you are at it I love the game and all the locations and people and look forward for more characters and settings&lt;3&lt;3!!!!! :) :) :) :)
076115678X|5.0|My 22 year old loved it.  She is getting alot of great ideas and is able to care for her curls in a fasionable way.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a really fun adventurous game to play the upgrade your game to different places on the map and you will love it. For everyone who didn't try it you should download this app its free and fun.  TRY IT!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun and gives you a chance to think outside the box to solve the puzzles.  I can't wait for more levels!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game really makes you use your mind in solving each level. It has a lot of interesting scenarios. I am surprised at every new level.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|By the time I actually read this I had pretty much read everything contained within the book elsewhere on the Amazon KDP website or elsewhere, but this was still worth reading to ensure that I hadn't missed anything.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This app is very addictive however it does freeze up from time to time. Other then that it is great game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun addicting like temple run 1 and 2 and stick run survival run you a are chased by a c<br />op and a dog at a subway for doing gerfete
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have to admit that I had my doubts about this game.  Most of these type games are pretty lame.  But, this one is surprisingly fun.  It isn't too difficult or too easy and it goes at a pretty fast pace.  So far, I've been pleased!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME , BUT WHY CAN't I get on Facebook during my kindle fire 8.9. My friends and I are middle aged Women, so why do we love this game so?
B0013527I4|5.0|The third season of the Muppet Show is the funniest of all three. Also got to say that it have more knowing celebrities than the first season. In the first season it can be seen that most of the celebrities were theater actors and in the second movie actors and in the third one there are famous singers.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre and couldn't find it for the longest time on DVD.  It's a very well acted move that didn't get nearly enough credit.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Wonderful book.  I very much enjoyed the writing style and the storyline.  A very quick read and a poignant story.
B008OHV4PG|2.0|This is painful to write, because I really wanted to like this, and not just because I bought it.  I very much enjoyed the Neil Young Blu-ray Archives Vol. 1 boxed set, and, of course, a lot of his recordings, but, to me, this disk was boring, both cinematically and musically.  I guess this means that although I have loved much of Neil's music, I am not enough of a fan to be enthralled by watching him drive around and perform what appears to be an impassioned, if musically uninspired, set.<br /><br />So, if you are a *real* fan of Neil, I suppose this will satisfy, but for the more casual admirer of Neil's music, I would advise watching and listening to a friend's copy before deciding whether or not to purchase this disk.<br /><br />If you want to be amazed, purchase, watch, and listen to \\"Searching for Sugar Man.\\"  It's not Neil, but it is cinematically and musically compelling.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great game, lovely graphics.  there were a few glitches, but not anything big enough to ruin play.  sometimes when you try to use the monkey (which is a super cool part of the game)  a code message came up on the banner that shouldn't have...
B0063IH60K|5.0|I haven't played solitaire in a great while. Just browsing decided to download this game and I love it!  Can be addictive! I would definitely recommend this app if you like the game.
193700788X|2.0|spoiler!!!<br />Okay she ends up with Sam....<br />Honestly its author's choice vs reader's choice for this books apparently. The author was going in the direction she was building her characters up to. However the storyline didn't end with enough closure to this reader. Honestly it seemed thrown together at the last minute. She could have gave Eric and Sookie's relationship a better ending before she tried to make us fall for the Sam and Sookie pair. All it did was leave me disappointed in this new relationship. It just made it seem like she settled for Sam more than any real chemistry. All in all it was a mediocre ending.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|If you are interested in the world of God's and Goddesses of Roman and Greek mythology this is the best book for it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great I could play all day I absolutely love it I can't take my hands hands off and I wish I could thank the people or person that made this thank you
B007FEFLTO|5.0|We learn nothing from war it seems.<br />Just keep repeating mistakes and setting to war again and again.<br />Good to read just for the history leading up to wwII and after.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A parent of a child in my class said he was reading Job's biography. He said that even I might have had trouble teaching Steve Jobs as a young student. I knew I had to check it out. I think he was right. Jobs was an amazing and complicated man. The author did a great job presenting the man without sugar coating the good and the bad. This book caused me to do further research on early Macs and the history of Apple. I would recommend it to everyone. It also helps a teacher look at each student in her class with a slightly different eye!
B00CL68NOG|3.0|It was funny,  I enjoyed this movie, you should watch it. Barbara is a trip<br />what do you have to loose
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is really fun. Wouldn't  better if it saved it content incase you accidentally delete it. It kinda sucks when that happens.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|It was Little slow,  I enjoyed this movie, you should watch it. Daniel Day-Lewis is a trip<br />what do you have to loose
B003VS0CXS|5.0|What a great Movie!<br />A bit of nostalgia for us and real Thrill for 5 year old.<br />Whats not to like songs, kids and a flying car.<br /><br />Takes multiple sittings for her and she is mesmerized which is great considering she normally only likes animated movies.<br /><br />We got a great price on Amazon and super fast shipping through Amazon Prime.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|Found this film very entertaining as well as thought provoking in addressing the lives of perfomers after their prime, and the problems they faxce.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|challenging without being too hard<br />walkthroughs available on line,  just have to google the floor u r on.<br />recommend this game,  5 out 5 stars.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|Perfection from start to finish, Cumberbatch is mesmerizing Great updating of classic stories, a MUST have for all Holmes Fans
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Justin has done it again.  This CD is off the chain and my favorites are:  Pusher Love Girl, Suit & Tie and Mirrors.  These three songs keep you patting your feet and singing to the lyrics.  Excellent CD....
B004132HZS|5.0|Steven Moffatt is a genius, He has taken Doctor Who to the next level and has done tihis with Sherlock Holmes
B0052UZIFA|4.0|My daughter loves this and has bought it on every device she owns.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The third book Entwined with you was so good. All of her books have been so good that I couldn't put them down! I'm never bored. I cannot wait for the 4th book to come out.<br />I think I might like the crossfire series more then the 50 shades of Gray Series.
B007T99ENE|1.0|Didn't enjoy 5 minutes of this book , I found the whole story unbelievable and pointless ... I really can't find anything good to say about it!
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Hang in there... takes a little more than couch stupor to get this movie. It is not a  three beer and a belch genre. Amazing that they can maintain the level of intrigue and excitement across so many story lines. The mulitple characters played by the actors adds some fun. I will probably watch it a 3rd time!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Coworkers talked so much about Downton Abbey I just had to see what all the hoopla was about, well I found out.  I watched all three seasons and now I am HOOKED.
B000P0J09W|5.0|A great family movie.  Fun to play on rainy days. Some cursing so you may want to be careful at age appropriateness.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Only rated a four because there is two more books up and coming. Know we have to sit and wait ..
B0000UJDLM|4.0|The only reason I choose this rating is because I liked the movie but didn't remember all the cursing.  Showed it to my class and was a little embarrassed.
B007SGM084|3.0|I found the series to be just OK.  I don't get what all the fuss is about.  It was actually a bit disturbing to think that millions of readers enjoyed reading a series in which dominance is admired.  I found it to be a bit degrading.  Two grown adults in a sexual relationship should not enjoy inflicting nor receiving pain as a source of pleasure.  Maybe I am being prudish; but I certainly enjoy a very active sex life with one partner and without pain being involved.  One should not be subservient in what is supposed to be an equal partnership. JMHO.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Loved the diversity of his music choices.  From Piaf to Presley....all wonderful!!  His voice just gets better and better.  My favorite album on his so far!
B001EC2IXK|5.0|If you don't enjoy this movie, you don't understand good films.  A MUST SEE!!!!  Paul Newman is just great in this film.  I think you will be glued to your seat.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|It was good, but not as good as the first & second books.  I thought it was a trilogy.  Now I know there's more.
B000067FP8|3.0|I view Daffy funnier in his mogwai form. In fact, out of both Gremlins movies, this crazy character is essentially the only one I liked.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Much more comprehensive than the other apps I've seen out there.  But I hate that if you want to review it that you have to make sure you have enough words.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very thought provoking in that it requires putting clues together to advance. While each level requires the User to think as one goes it was easy enough that my seven-year old was able to play with me.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I wasn't very sure what to expect from this book. I enjoyed the suspense of not knowing what is going to happen. This is a real dystopian book to me, more so than Divergent or the Hunger Games. I honestly can't tell if this story will have a somewhat happy ending or will end completely horribly. This book doesn't have just physical harm, but I think the mental suspense is more terrifying. Great read! Can't wait to get to the next one.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I only spent a penny on this, but it looks and plays like it's brand new.  The jacket and the disc are in mint condition.  I didn't even have to wait that long to get it.  I am very happy with my purchase.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful acting, terrific cast.  Interesting twists and turns.  Can't wait for Season 4....especially with the cliff hanger at the end.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|however, language was at time lewd & vulgar and not appropriate for family with younger children (even in reality children,<br />boys behave as they do in this movie) .  The movie it self is fast pace and fun to watch.
034580404X|5.0|I started this trilogy and could NOT put it down.  Only for mature audiences.  The only con I could say about this text is the use of complicated words.  Written at a high reading level, but I like being introduced to new vocabulary.  Can't wait for the movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is amazing and they even have upgrades!!! Way better than temple run!!! I wish more games were like this.
B009NY43NY|4.0|The ending of this book, this series to me sadly was a huge let down. There was no closure in my opinion.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|Works good, exactly what I was looking for! great if you wan to listen to music in your car. thanks
1613832788|1.0|Never thought I'd have to review the &#34;specifications&#34; before I place a book order, but I should have.  This hardcover is only about 7&#34; x 4&#34;.  It's tiny for a hardcover, like an airport paperback.  I haven't seen a hardcover book this small since I was in elementary school.  The print is tiny, the binding is falling apart.  All in all, I wish I hadn't bought it.<br /><br />That being said the story is still great, just by a different release.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I am a new fan. I Love the whole CD. I heard &#34;Radioactive&#34; on Defiance and had to find this music.<br />I am mezmerized by their haunting sound.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Very fun time taker love the different attributes during battles. The upgrading troops sometimes can take for ever trying to get all the crafting ingredients. ..but if u want to spend money makes it faster.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game! It takes time to move on sometimes so you don't beat the game as soon as you get it. Unfortunately, you cant name the animals or dinos.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|nice fun game but needs more levels puzzles are just hard enough to keep you trying to get out hope to see new levels soon
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Cut the rope and cut the rope experiments were funny but nothing is compared to two om noms at the same time.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome amazing brilliantly designed and absolutely perfect this is the best game I have ever played 4 words I love this game!!!!!! Thank you who ever mad  this game!!! Absolutely AMAZING!!!!
B000SGGUWS|4.0|A lot of differences from the show. Book geared to younger age group. I am going to get the next in series.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked this game a lot it would be better if they came out with new levels faster and made the levels just a little bit harder
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Dungeon Hunter 4 is a great game to play. Has a few characters with a lot of items to use, good graphics. But the potion thing, 2 hours to give u 1 potion. If they had an update they should change the potion time or just use a couple of gold to get a potion. Anyway, this is a good game to play.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Gideon and Eva showed us what real love can do. Is a story full of exhitment. Every new chapter had an amazing twist and mistery somehow. Just Loved it! cant wait to see if theres going to be a next book!
1932735410|5.0|To pass the pmp exam on the first try I used this book, the pmprepcast and reviewed with a second book.<br /><br />This book is something a person can read, and has more value than simply passing the exam.  Still use it for my project reference.<br /> I can't say if this book is the best, because I only used this one to get the job done. It has sufficient information to pass. I had the fourth edition pmbook exam, so you should probably be looking for the edition number 5 guide.<br /><br />Thanks Rita team for keeping this work alive!!!.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|The classics are always the best.  Some of the language is a bit cumbersome but a very good read. Would recommend to anyone interested in historical mysteries.
1442444053|4.0|After letting 20 years go by between readings, I found  this reading to be a little disappointing.  Still, a good  yarn for young people to know about.    Please see my review on [...]
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Just started The Shield marathon, finishing season 1 quickly and moving on to season 2. Absolutely love the writing, cast, storylines, although some are disturbing.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Excellent value for the money!  I also have a Tamrac backpack and the Amazon backpack is a much better deal.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like jcpenny because it has wifi.  And it is a hair dresser. you will like it too. it's awesome
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is excellent!  The acting is very good. The costumes and scenery are so beautiful. You really get a feel for the period and the social rules of the time. The characters are so \\"real\\", with both good and bad qualities. There are no one dimensional stereotypes. This is so much richer than the silly, banal sitcoms on American television.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its a good little app mostly for kids but good to kill time! And great for horse lovers. Have fun!
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I'm giving this 4 stars only because Amanda Seyfried's voice reminded me of a little chirping bird from Snow White. That said:<br />Everything else is 5 stars. Amazon delivered right on time, the disc worked, the movie itself was absolutely beautiful...... Hugh Hackman has risen to my top actors list. Who new wolverine had an incredible voice. Many say Inspector/ Russell Crowe does not have a strong voice compared to the other actors, but I disagree. I like his voice, he carries the songs well (Stars is beautiful) and is a Very good actor. Anne Hathway surprised me as well; she's a great actor, but I didn't know she could sing. Very convincing as Fantine.<br />Overall, a must see, no matter if you are in theatre or are just an appreciator of theatre. It's definitely different watching it from stage, but a good different. I admire how the actors had to actually sing on set.<br />-On a side note: I would take precaution when showing this movie to a younger audience; there are definitely some inappropriate scenes that I can't even handle like when Fantine resorts to prostitution. The 'lovely ladies' are not quite lovely.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|My son & I have read the books, and I finally rented the movie. I had hesitated for some time because of the bad reviews here.<br />It is NOT as good as the book. There is really no question. And there are multiple differences between the book and movie. I would guess that there was some thought that perhaps the book was so detailed that the story had to be more streamlined to make the movie work in 2 hours. But in doing so, I think lots of interesting content was sacrificed. There were too many missing pieces for me. Also, some acting is not wonderful.<br />That said, I disagree with the reviewers who have written this movie off as terrible. If I hadn't read the books, I may have enjoyed it more. But it is entertaining, not without flaws, and my teenage son loved it. So if your kids like these stories, they may like the movie, too.<br />It had some pretty interesting visuals with different monsters. I'd say it is exciting, but not overly scary. I'd say it is very appropriate for ages 7 and up.<br />If you have been on the fence because of other reviews, I would say go ahead. It may not be your favorite movie ever, but it is entertaining and family-friendly.
0061122416|5.0|You need to just read this book as you would a childhood fable:  a good story with a moral but written for adults.  We read this book for our book club and it was well received.  There are, as with any good fable, parts of the story where you need to suspend your reality and just enjoy it.  It was a book I would read again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was lots of fun and kept me entertained. I need more levels soon! I would recommend to puzzle lover's!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I really love this game and I have the related game prom salon!!!they are both great though!!!!loving it!!!!!<br />also you others should download prom salon!!!!!
B00884GR0W|4.0|I really love this game. Its better than mindcraft. it has guests you can do and it has better graphics. than mindcraft and it's much cheeper too. Althouh I have a hard time playing it recently. It stops in the middle of a game and it goes to the home page and I have to start over. bummer. besides that I would highly recommend this game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app is a good game with lots of puzzels i wish there was more levels very fun game! you should try it.
B00992CF6W|3.0|this is a cool game but before you spend $7 on it I would try the free version of mind block story to see if you like it better. it has better graphics and it has quests you can play and the full version is only $2. I would try mindblock first.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun for anyone no matter what age I would recommend this game to anyone.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|I passed this one to my daughter and it is making the rounds in the right circles now.  The one thing that stands out is that the author comes from a moneyed and influential family so that had to have played in on some of her success.  Not many of us have that background advantage.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|SHE WRITE A VERY GOOD MYSTERY ANOTHER WRITER WHO HOLDS YOUR ATTENTION RIGHT FROM THE BEGGINING ALWAYS A GOOD READ

B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I LIKE HIS BOOKS HE SEEMS TO KNOW JUST HOW TO GRAB YOUR ATTENTION AND HOLD IT  I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR HIS NEXT ONE
0061122416|3.0|Decent story, but very heavy handed. Great for those seeking inspiration, particularly from religion. If you are at least a little bit cynical, this book is probably not for you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|awesome app just like the original ipod touch SUBWAY SURFERS!!!!! I would DEFINATELY recommend this app!! one of the best games ever
0385333846|4.0|Kurt Vonnegut is a great story teller. I'm glad I read this classic. The constant changes of scene keep the reader interested.
B0042UEU8M|5.0|This is a 5 star sad movie. If you love sad movies, this is it. It's so heartbreaking, sad, and depressing. This movie is slow. For me, there is already too much sadness around the world and in the news that I have to see everyday, so this is not my kind of movie. I like pick me up movies. If you love movies about death and heartbreaks, this movie is for you.
B0051XQI84|3.0|Why does Amazon take videos OFF so one cannot watch or rent them. I was so looking forward to renting this for my kids.
B0038YIDHM|5.0|While I dont believe that this will be the final record for the superior group Scorpions I do believe it has been a record long in coming.  Heavier rock and still a quality sound from the in my humble opinion the best rock and roll group out of Germany and you will probably never see another like them.
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|Im glad they made this movie...its one of the better ones related to the OZ story.<br />The CGI and sets were done pretty good, and if you review the extras you will see<br />basically how they put this movie together.<br /><br />Looks like they tried to make a movie for KIDS AND ADULTS...instead of for kids<br />and bigger kids.<br /><br />Wont compare the classic to this one cause, nothing beats classic. This one had<br />some new ideas...some good one ...some bad ones.<br /><br />Here is what i was thinking after the movie: (warning..some spoilers)<br /><br />1. I rather have flying monkeys that flying baboons.<br />2. I would have never choosen Mila Kunis for the bad witch part...come on get<br />  someone not as pretty and a bit older ..<br />3. Lots of time spent with the witches..and that phoney little scam from Franco<br />  to get the girl...and Mila Kunis turns evil because of this...hummm<br />3. James Franco was better near the end...but not as good at the beginning..<br />  not the right choice for the wizard.<br />4. The wonderfull people of OZ...costumes and looks were great..but they<br />  could have added some short songs and musical numbers.<br />  The little people started a song and dance routine..but was cut short..<br />  Come on...where's the magic.<br />5. The witches soldiers could have kept the Original ooo umm ooo song as<br />  marched, but they improved that sound only to make it sound like the<br />  soldiers in Lord of the Ring movies....<br />  So the sound went from scary for kids ...to threatening...hummmm<br /><br />bottom line...i like this movie...i will eventually get a (cheaper) copy and<br />i really hope another OZ movie will be made.......there is still room<br />And working with Blue Screens is wonderfull for CGI but takes a bit of life<br />from the actors/actresses ...so they do have to work and imagine even harder<br />than before. The ones that dont....points to a films that wont work as good.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I like that this book still stands the test of time and that Clarke's plot can still surprise.  Of course modern truth is still stranger than fiction in some ways - much is predicted in terms of technological advance in this book, but not all. Consider flat screen TVs, PDAs & mobile phones and Internet.  The metamorphosis is both exhilarating in scale, but also leaves you feeling a little sad and wistful at the end.  Is group think really the ultimate echelon of evolution or is it the dynamic interplay of individuals? One wonders.<br />A great starting point for AC Clarke's collection.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is an enjoyable story  that is intelligently written. It is the kind of writing that captures your heart & mind before you are even aware of it. It will make you think. It will make you feel. It will make you wonder. It will make you want more.
B00338QENI|4.0|Highly recommend reading.  Very informative and easy to read. Glad to see the book was a success with telling a story about the family.

B002ROKQJM|4.0|Having given the FictionFan award for Book of 2011* to Adiga's great novel [[ASIN:B004J4X7B2 Last Man in Tower]], I backtracked to this earlier book with very high expectations, perhaps too high. The White Tiger won the 2008 Man Booker Prize but, while it shows all the same skill in writing, the humour and the ability to compel the reader to keep turning the pages, for me it lacks some of the humanity and warmth that characterises the later book.<br /><br />On the eve of the Chinese President's visit to India, Balram Halwai, the White Tiger of the title, writes him a series of letters ostensibly to explain how democracy and entrepreneurship are the factors that differentiate the two countries. However as Balram's story unfolds, it become a confessional, as we learn of the unconventional way in which he broke out of the `Rooster Coop' that keeps the lower caste Indian in a state of poverty and servility to the rich.<br /><br />Balram's job as driver and servant to a rich businessman gives Adiga the opportunity to show the contrasts in Indian society, as does Balram's move from the poverty of rural India to the rich parts of Delhi in the wake of his master. Adiga's writing is so assured and flowing that the book is a pleasure to read and Balram, despite his faults, is a character it's hard not to empathise with and like. But somehow the descriptions of the society seem a bit shallow - not enough shades of grey. Adiga is wryly scathing about the corruption endemic in politics and the police, but so many of the characters seem purely driven by greed that often there's very little room for the reader to sympathise with them.<br /><br />Overall, I found this a well-written, enjoyable read with obvious signs of the talent and promise that for me Adiga fulfilled in Last Man in Tower. Recommended.<br /><br />*The prize for this prestigious award is that I guarantee to buy the author's next book!
B004QX07G4|2.0|First let me say that I love Ellen! But with that said this book seems pretty much like the ramblings of some one with a.d.d.  just trying to fill up pages.<br />Everything that's useful is all summed up in the final chapter.<br />Sorry Ellen! Luv ya!
0316228532|5.0|This is a great book by J.K. ROwling. This books focus is not fairytale and magic of Harry Potter land but the harsh reality of classicism. She came from a very meager background and I am certain she used that as inspiration for this complex stories where most of the characters are flawed but complex. The story is not a far stretch from what it is like to loive in slums that are just a stones throw from the Upper Class and how the poor are marginalized and vilified. Many do not like the book because they want more of her Harry Potter writing but this book demonstrates her fluidity as a writer and her compassion, she is a very large philanthropist and has opened centers for disadvantaged children.<br />Book arrived to a friend first and it was nearly 24 hours after order placed.
B005LAIIJY|1.0|Tarantino still got no ideas.He comes along with a so called homage to the genre as previously kill bill exploits the eastern movies , inglorious basta exploits the war movies and now django unchained exploits the western genre.If you want to see something real good get yourself the old Django movies with Franco Nero or Sabata with Lee van Cleef.<br />Or \\"Take a hard ride\\" :o)
1455502758|5.0|Again Hitch has tested my vocabulary, has had me reading passages out loud to people in the room, and has offered new perspectives borne out of a brilliant confluence of logic and irony. He has done all this with a mind clouded with chemotherapy, waves of pain, profound uncertainty about his future and a totally absorbing drive to live. Mortality is as much a treasure as any of Hitch's work. He is generous to his critics, but does not cringe from balanced observation and cruel insight. And, ultimately, Mortality is in places one of the most wickedly humorous of his collections.<br /><br />It is probably little wonder that a talent like Christopher Hitchens used his final illness as a journey of exploration and affirmation. Appropriately, his wife, Carol Blue, has the last loving word in Mortality, and even more appropriately, this final volume helps ensure his place amongst those renowned commentators and public intellectuals whom he so loved.

B00C5W3SBE|3.0|When I first heard about \\"Oz The Great And Powerful\\", I was admittedly not that enthused about it. However, as the release date for the film drew closer I was persuaded to go and check it out.<br /><br />Admittedly, this is a darker Oz than perhaps what we are used to from our childhoods and the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" film/books and more in tone with \\"Return To Oz\\" and the \\"Wicked\\" series of books. While not a bad story overall the darker or more serious aesthetic may turn off a lot of people looking for a lighter film. That is not to say that this film is not suitable for children, while there are a few scenes that may frighten **Spoiler Alert** (*Most Notably, Theodora transforming into The Wicked Witch of the West)** it is perhaps not as \\"disturbing\\" for lack of a better word as some of the events/themes touched upon in the Harry Potter series.<br /><br />The acting in the film runs the gamut from spectacular to lackluster, with no one really being horrible in their respective roles, they just lack panache or the ability to convey their characters as well as they could have been. But I will touch more on that later on in my opinion on this film.<br /><br />The film opens in Kansas, circa 1905 with Oscar Diggs, known as Oz to his friends. Is performing in the Baum Brothers Traveling Circus as a magician. He does the normal run of the mill magic acts one would expect to come with a traveling circus or carnival magician. But he feels that his talents are wasted, or that he could achieve a great deal more if only afforded the opportunity, stating himself that he wishes he could be like Thomas Edison. We meet a woman from Oscar's past, Annie, someone with whom he was either friends or romantically involved we are not told. However we do learn and it is implied that Oscar has not been keeping his heart to himself as he has been leading several woman along with a cache of cheap music boxes, and a story about a deceased grandmother. (This ultimately being what gets him into trouble.) Oscar flees the circus upon a liaison with another performer's wife/girlfriend comes to light and he must make good an exit. Hopping aboard a hot air balloon the circus uses for advertising/controlled ascents he lifts off and away from his captors only to be dragged into the Land of Oz by an oncoming cyclone.<br /><br />Oscar lands in Oz, where he meets three witches: Evanora \\"The Good Witch of the East\\", Theodora \\"The Good Witch of the West\\" and lastly, Glinda \\"The Good Witch of the South\\" and daughter of Oz's former King. I'd go into further detail about the plot, but I feel that would ruin the story.<br /><br />I do think that this is a movie people should see, however, as far as owning goes...that is a more complicated matter. I saw this movie in theaters and at that point, I had resolved that when it came out I would purchase it. After purchasing it, I believe that it is a movie, that at least in my collection will only be viewed occasionally, not b/c I feel it is a bad film, I just feel that it is a film that I will not be drawn to watching multiple times in quick succession. So you may want to purchase it, if you feel that you're getting it for a reasonable price, or you may want to wait til it becomes available on Netflix etc and watch it then.<br /><br />Now, back to what I said earlier in regards to the acting. There are people in this film that I think are acted well, Theodora, Evanora and Glinda I think are all portrayed very well and the actresses bring each of their characters a weight to them. Other characters, like Finley who serve as comic relief as also portrayed well as is the China Doll. However if I had to list any singular complaint as far as the acting went, I would have to place that with James Franco as Oz. It just seems that he can neither do the \\"Oz the con man\\" or \\"Oz the sympathetic\\" character very well. He sort of waxes and wanes and in my opinion at least really only comes into his own towards the end of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, a movie definitely worth seeing with some good acting, decent story, good visual effects and very well done soundtrack. As far as owning goes, if you like it after seeing it and can get it for a reasonable price, the certainly b/c I think you can do far worse than \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\". But keep in mind, in my own opinion this is NOT a movie you will be drawn to watch numerous times in succession with friends and family and will in all likelihood end up being on a shelf a good amount of the time.
B004KKX814|5.0|L Drago is the awesomest because he is the attack type. I really like him. I like him in the whole world because he can attack from above. You really have to have him because he is important. And you better have him because he is better than any beyblade in the world. And he is a special one that is a dragon.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|Magic and reality are wonderfully blended here. You look at the core events - and you see quite typical-magic-adventure ones, but the story unfolds in a lovely landscape, that is a totally great experience. Every problem solved has a price, not every solution is the best one, giving so \\"fantasy done right\\" feeling. The best flavors of \\"American gods\\" and \\"Coraline\\" are blended together. Maybe, there could be less loose ends, maybe it could last a bit longer - but I totally liked it as it is.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|This game is very simple and relaxing and totally addicting. I play it on my Kindle Fire HD and it's super fun. Definitely give it a shot.
B000OLROWC|4.0|My son is 7 years old and his name is Daniel and I must say this is his favorite movie now and he<br />pretends to be Daniel Russo all the time. This movie, even thought it's almost 30 years old, has few<br />things to show and teach this generation.<br />There are few words you need to watch out for but I am sure kids heard them before  - like it or nor.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie was excellent from start to finish. Saw it in theatres and couldn't wait for it to come out on bluray. Nonstop fun and if you don't like it then you have issues and shouldn't be on amazon reading reviews about it.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|Great Product
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Any batman fan will have seen this movie tons of times and there's no reason not too. Excellent origin story for Batman and Nolan did a great job directing. Bale played the best Batman of any film.

B00957T6X6|5.0|I ;love George R,R, Martin's Game of Thrones.  It is so easy to read on my Kindle.  I have it in paperback but I need to put on my reading glasses.  With the Kindle it is really easy on the eyes.  Since I love the TV series I wanted to read the books and I am immersed in the books.  Great summer time reading especially for fantasy lovers.
B00003CXWV|5.0|Great Product
B004RJMUJO|3.0|This game is a family favorite, however lately it's been glitching and no matter where you touch it doesn't acknowledge and ends up freezing. It says it's not responding. This needs to get fixed! Especially when you paid for the game due to the free version doing the same thing.
B009R659L8|5.0|What a book it keep me questing until the end, I gibe it five stars, can't wait to start my next book I do hope it as good , I usually read love stories on ly but got into Mary & her daughter while in charge of the Recreation Center in Iraq and been a faith for readeer every since.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am so hooked! I love the characters. I have a hard time waiting for the next episodes! Hurry up season 4!
B00C25TCZ0|4.0|As a life-long Lizzy fan, I was really looking forward to hearing this new line-up. I am glad they retiried the Lizzy name as it shows they are not just a band of retreats (as you see these days with bands from the '70's touring for their last paycheck using the same name but only one or two original members). BSR is NOT a retreat band - they are a great new band bringing the Lizzy twin guitar harmony with their twist to the new generation of rockers.  You can sense that the band tried to think what Lynott would write about if he was around these days and did a good job. The guitars (of course) sound great - you still got it Scott!. Marco on bass is awesome and really apparent on the songs.  Only slight negative is Ricky's voice is great but doesn't vary enough during the album making many songs sound alike. It is something they have to work on the next album, and I hope there's a next album because it's high energy/guitar rock that I like.  I would love to see Brian Robertson guest in for a song in the next album? Maybe Eric Bell??? Bring back Brian Downey for a song?
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|Love Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann, but this movie felt like over 2 hours of the same thing. The movie also ended way too abruptly. Some funny parts, but I wouldn't watch it again.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|After 15 years++, the band is together (R.I.P. Dio) and have they have not missed a beat. Ozzy's charisma is dripping everywhere on this album and his lyrics show our society of as a mass of pretention, duplicity, and lies.  Ozzy calls it like it is!<br />The music is the classic dark and brooding Sabbath sound with some predicitible song patterns, but it's predictible because we we just know what's coming next.<br />My only negative is that I don't hear enough Tony Iommi doing enough solos. His crushing guitar work is out in front (and the back ground) but I wish I hear more crushing solos. I've only listened to the album 3-4 times so I need to go back and do some pleasurable homework.<br />Overall, the album demands your full attention while listening to every lyric and Ozzy is back and bringing his philosophy of life, death, and our modern times to us in no BS terms.  Highly recommondable and certainly a must for orgininal Sabbath fans.<br />P.S. No bad words either...
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|One of the most enjoyable reads and certainly the best self help book on the market. If you really want to change your life without hand-holding, no fictitious malarkey, not a single sentence of BS, this book has it in spades!
B004KBSQBA|5.0|One of my favorite albums of all time.  Couldn't use my old tape in a new car so ordered CD and can't stop listening.
193700788X|5.0|This is suppose to be the end of this series which I'm okay with cause she ended up with Sam and I love that Idea and I really never saw it coming. Even though I know this isn't the last book in the series they have a little tiny one coming out and I cant wait to read that one either!!:)
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This app is a nice, easy way to wake up.  You can set the alarm to start a song at low volume and then increase volume gradually till you get up.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Good game but a little directions would have been nice. I like to find the clues and try to solve the puzzle.
B001MM28JG|5.0|If you've ever been a Star Trek fan, you'll love this movie.  It's a light-hearted parody of Star Trek that is too funny.  I still laugh at it even though I've seen it several times.  The cast is excellent.  A must see for any Star Trek or Tim Allen fan.
0307730700|5.0|This book is about so much more than the SEALS; it's about the life of a heroic and selfless American. It's perhaps the most inspirational story I've ever read. The way Adam treated others and his commitment to his family, his friends, his country, and his faith all had an enormous impact on me
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is the best game ever! this game is super fun but super challenging. because. you have to use a lot of thinking skills.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|Absolutely love it and wear it everywhere! I even play Tennis with it occasionally. Very well built watch! Would recommend to anyone.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is really fun. It keeps me up for hours with its brain teasers. I love it a lot a lot.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|How can you go wrong?  You get a decent dose or history of a very well known President along with Vampires!  The scenes were bloody, sometimes gory but not to a point where you were jumping out of your seat like you would in a horror movie. The actor (Benjamin Walker) plays Abraham Lincoln who realizes that vampires at planning an all out assault to take over the United States.  And it is his job to stop them.  The scenes were as close to realistic without going totally to CGI as in most movies and the story flowed great!  The multiple characters included in the movie did a wonderful job and the scenery, really did look authentic to the period.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I hadn't expected the story to go on beyond this one so I was all syched up for it to end but to my pleasure the story will continue!
B001LRJH0U|3.0|Well, I was a little disappointed with the movie.  You have some very big name actors - Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen, Jeremy Irons and Renee Zelleweger who are cast in the movie and I would have expected a deep, cling to your seat movie.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.  The acting was great as you would expect but the movie just seemed kind of cheesy.  The gun fire sounded like a bottle rocket going off and I felt like the actors were reading off cue cards.  The story was good but again, I would have hoped for better.  Note, I have watched several westerns, even from the 50's - 70's that had more of a story and better sounding gun fire, etc.  Overall, I am glad I paid under $10 for the movie.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This app rocks. I can be the bad dude. I say this app is for ages 5-9. My sister loves this app more than any other app and she loves all apps. Better than mindcraft and mindcraft is an awesome App.
B0074AGVWK|5.0|It was easy to read. Lots of humour and very down to earth and believable. Could relate well to the story.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It's a good game for children teens and so all I can go on and on but that's what I want to say
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Just finished reading Game of Thrones. I loved the people in the book, and the story line. My favorite person in the book is Daenerys. I would tell people to read the series first before watching the HBO series
B00A44HRG2|4.0|Pretty fun app but some of the cameras are just looped recordings. Great app for those just looking for something to do. Can look around other countries. Just wish I could control the way the camera looked.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good game to increase problem solving skills.  Violence free and fun.  I enjoyed playing it very much.  Wish it had more free levels.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game was so difficult but i figured it out finally thank you this game was so much fun everyone should get it
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I loved all 7 novels!  My Children are Frasier's (Fraser's) and my youngest son has so many of Jamie's physical attributes that I keep seeing him as Jamie. He has a red beard, loves long hair and is a tall &#34;big man&#34;  He is fearless just like Jamie and all of the children, who are adults now, are proud of their Scottish heritage.  Looking forward to the release of Number eight!
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|So talented and unique.  Need to watch a few of their Youtube videos to get acquainted with them.  Was fortunate to see them on tour this spring in Denver ~ amazing show ~ the talent, videos, and lighting!
B00AALXPN8|5.0|Downloaded this onto my Kindle HD and it is great! My little girl is enjoying this movie every day. would recomend this movie to other families.

B007FY9ZWI|1.0|This app does not work for the kindle fire. I don't understand why amazon offers apps that don't even work with the kindle fire.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|At every level Dawkins eloquently presents the case for a world without &#34;gods&#34;.  His discussion concerning the abortion debate is systematic and conclusive.  Clearly, Hawkins is progressive in his vision of what humans are capable of achieving, the source of optimism, in direct contrast with the regressive claptrap of the fundamentalist worldview.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Can't play some videos, but adobe flash player is not compatible with the kindle.  I can't figure out what version is?
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|It was good, but I was under the impression of only 3 books total. But NO... This book ended to soon and left you hanging on. So I guess we all have to wait for the next one!
B008IJTFYW|3.0|It was advertised, so I tried it out, and it was free. Pretty cool, just don't have a need for this app. But  I am keeping it. Would be good for someone with a small baby that needed some relaxing sounds.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME AND CRAZY AND UNBELIEVABLE AND SUPER FUN SO IF YOU READ THIS BUY IT. YOU WILL REGRET IT IF YOU DON'T SO DO IT NOW BUY IT ask you parents first though. =P
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Excellent. Just as I  expected. It was worth the wait. With each new book, I like this series more and more.
B0093X805W|5.0|I'd watched the movie dozens of times since I was a kid and the book is so much better!!  Lots of details about Charlie's world and how tough he has it and how wonderful his experience is at the factory.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I have never been so excited about a book release as I was waiting for this one. The story line in this book was not what I expected it to be. I feel like there was a lot of \\"fluff\\" this time. Yes it was exciting to actually get rid of the villain but in doing it I feel like we lost some of the fire between Gideon and Eva. I guess really what got me is the fact that this one DID NOT have to end the way it did. I thought I was reading a trilogy and now I find out that there is not only a fourth book but it will even be stretched out to a fifth one. Come on Sylvia your readers like cliff hangers but this one just looked like a hold out so that you have to read the fourth and fifth. I think a lot of people will see this as a bad spin off Fifty Shades now. E.L. James is an original writer so take some tips from her. When your writing a trilogy like she did actually make it a trilogy. Yes it will leave your readers wanting more but isn't that what you want?
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just as good as the hunger games but more complex.  The story starts off slow in my opinion but quickly picks up speed and is action packed!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game. I play it on my kindle fire and have no problems with it. The horses look good not cartoony at all
B002MQYOFW|5.0|An adventure way off in the future after our current population destroys the earth, or at least is appears that is the case.
B00D56GJCE|1.0|I click on this but it never starts playing.  I watched all the other episodes without a problem and now want to see the last one.  What gives, Amazon?<br /><br />PE Kennedy
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Oh how I wish the shorty wasn't over but it is.  A great ending, heart wrenching in spot.  Can't wait to compare it to the movie when it comes out.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I like it a lot they keep producing good songs. They are fun to listen to and cover a lot of different styles in this album
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Lighthearted and funny, this is a good read.  I love that the story began as a night out and turned into a complex relationship.
1781162646|5.0|I enjoyed Stephen King's Joyland so very much. It was hard to put down once I started. A true murder mystery without all the unbelievable monsters and happenings. I enjoy his other books but this one was outstanding. I'm sure that whoever buys this book will consider their money well spent.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I bought this to support Jaycee Dugard, it's a tough read with all the details of what happened to her but gives insight into her strength and how she has been doing after her rescue.  Highly recommended.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great. I love the daily scriptures. I highly recommend this app. It is easy to search subject material. I like the way it gives you different versions to reference.
B004HEXSLI|3.0|nice quick read..........wonder what the follow up would  be for all stroke victims as far as recovery in the long run?
1597801585|5.0|William Gibson coined the term \\"cyberspace\\" in his short story \\"Burning Chrome\\" (1982) and later popularized the concept in his debut novel, Neuromancer (1984). Gibson visualized a future of computer networks and artificial intelligence and spawned a genre and movement with many pop-culture memes. Likewise Paolo Bacigalupi's fiction visualizes a future but here the key technology being examined is genetics. In his future Earth, generippers have created a host of altered creatures with consequences remarkable and terrible. The story is not the strongest part of this book, but it's a fine multi-character story and demonstrates solid writing skills. The highlight of the book is Bacigalupi's vision of future-Bangkok, which is richly textured, political, believable and feels as \\"new\\" as anything I've read lately. A fine piece of SF writing, and a strong voice in the genre, you can't ask for much more than this in a science fiction novel.
0060987464|4.0|Pros:<br /><br />-Very well written<br />-Funny<br />-Interesting<br />-Personal<br />-Shocking  (if you like that)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Could of been a little longer?<br />-I admit some parts of the book are hard to stomach!<br />-This came out in 98 or 99 i believe??  So it is somewhat outdated because Manson's career still was unraveling from 2000 up until today.  (plus he released like 4 more albums)
B004Y03LQ2|5.0|Great album and collection of songs..... a very good collection of songs to add to my ever growing Iron Maiden collection.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a fun find it game... with a twist. I like the flashlight levels. it really make you look extra hard
B001974DG0|4.0|Koontz's biographical information includes a beloved dog he owned by the name of Tricksy, the dog gave Koontz a new meaning to life. In this story a scientifically altered dog who has the intellect of a human plays a significant role and gives the protagonist a fresh new meaning to life. One can feel the passion and inspiration Koontz felt for his own special pet in this story and it is well told.  The antagonist is a co-product of the experiment that positively changed the dog but horribly went wrong with the creature.  Suspense builds as Koontz's adds a professional hit man and a developing love affair between two people who have mutual needs. The creature has a mission, there is killing and the challenge is on to see if indeed it finds the protagonist and his new friends and if so what will happen. Koontz only failure was to abandon the alternate story lines toward the end in favor of the development of the dog. It comes together in the end and is a good read
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun and a amazing game to play for kids and adults .....I love the first one and temple run 2
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, now. Granted the story telling can be hard to follow at times, I love it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game, truly gets you thinking. Difficulty on levels is well balanced. Great game for strategy players. Enjoy how math, logic and patterns are incorporated within the game.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Wow! That's all i could come up with! It was suspenseful, and there was a very twisted ending! I am not gonna tell u anymore cuz im gonna leave u to experience it yourself, and yes, there are sound effects along with clips that go along with the game!! Awesome and Spectacular!!!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Show is interesting and exiting.  This is a modification of the War of the Worlds type story line, but is updated and fun.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I have never cried while reading a book before.....until now.  Bravo, Mr. Rollins, although I have to admit I had a hard time at first with the new characters...they grew on me!
1589949811|5.0|I'm a causal gamer that had been looking for a game (especially a card game) that I could play by myself or with friends: this game has satisfied this desire beautifully. The art is awesome, the game play is immersive and complex enough to satisfy an experienced gamer but also a casual gamer as myself. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who likes to plan strategies and likes a game with replay value. I've only played the game for less than a week and have already ordered two more expansions! It's that awesome.
B0081336FO|5.0|I stumbled on to this series and glad I did. The actors/ characters are smart and interesting. The writers have great imaginations and story development, I eagerly await the next season.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|Lynch's first novel is a fantastic read, capturing the reader within an amazing new world.  The Gentlemen Bastards pit themselves against the mighty & powerful, trying to pull off their next big heist while the world around them turns to chaos.  Vibrant characters in a fantastical new world, the story leaves you eagerly awaiting the next novel!
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|I do not understand all the low-star reviews for Yeezus here at Amazon.  If Kanye West is not your bag, then fine, but why come here just to drop a 1-star review?<br /><br />If you are a Kanye fan, then I do not understand how you don't love Yeezus.  It's not all that different from the path he has been pursuing since 808s and Heartbreak, and is certainly a natural progression from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Watch the Throne, and Cruel Summer.  It's musically innovative, it's lyrically strong, it's funny, it's disturbing, and it sounds great with your stereo's volume maxed out.<br /><br />Seriously folks, this is likely the record of the year, and I hope you'll come around to it in a few more listens.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|I have become an aging baby boomer and loved Boz from years ago when I was in my 30's.  Hearing his voice again brought back great memories and I thoroughly enjoy listening to him singthese new ongs.

193700788X|1.0|I absolutely hated the ending of this True Blood book series.  After I read who Sookie ended up with, I felt betrayed.  Charlaine Harris created all these fabulous True Blood books, and characters, especially these two incredible vampires that we all fell in love with, and then she has Sookie Stackhouse end up with the very last man I would have expected, or wanted her to end up with.  I felt it was a betrayal to all True Blood fans, but also to Sookie too.  Why?  Because Sam her boss was an okay guy, but not either man Sookie had fallen in love with through all these books.  But the very worst part of what she did, was turn Eric Northman into a completely selfish vampire, even though he was in love with Sookie too!  She made him walk away from Sookie, and go marry the bitch queen of Oklahoma.  Betrayal, betrayal, betrayal to all her true blood characters.  After reading this last, and final book, and the way she ended it......I said I will never buy another Charlaine Harris book ever again.  Unless she writes another &#34;last&#34; book, and brings Eric back to Sookie.......
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|the story is pretty good with some plot holes here and there.  Otherwise enjoyable, and keeps you guess to the very end.
B0034KZE9U|3.0|These shoes are great! I am on my second pair, and my first pair lasted over a year of consistent use. The material shields my feet from hot water spills and prevents me from slipping so I will continue to buy this exact shoe. Not to mention it compliments our dress code.<br /><br />However, I work as a barista, and we are constantly moving and pivoting. This results in the bottom sole of the shoe peeling off. It starts from the top as a minor lose area but eventually I can feel it when I walk. When this happened with my first pair, I put it off (because it took a while for the damage to worsen) but eventually purchased a new pair on Amazon (since it was cheaper than the Crocs store).<br />Yet, I have only used this new pair for a few WEEKS and the same peeling is happening already... I know for a fact it didn't start to happen with my first pair until after at least a year of use... I don't know why the quality does not seem as strong when buying it from Amazon, but that is all I can think of.<br /><br />I prefer Crocs over traditional sports shoes since the plastic/ rubber material shields my feet completely from boiling hot spills, but at this rate it is not lasting as long so I may have to reconsider...<br />That is the ONLY reason why I did not rate this 5 stars... I am about to shop for an adhesive to stretch the life of this pair.  =/
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|Loved the first season! The characters are introduced in an interesting way along with a storyline that can't help but draw you in.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Been waiting on the new Yeezy CD forever....I don't know about just ten tracks, but I bet West is gonna pull a Timberlake and release more around the holidays.<br />Still though, worth every cent, especially for those of you with some thump in the trunk. Put this in, turn it up, and just enjoy.
B000I186FW|4.0|This movie was pretty prophetic, and some of the ideas in this movie are now coming true.  Big brother is watching and manipulating all of us.  They think that if they say it enough times that makes it the truth.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Me and my girlfriend watched this whole season from start to finish in a matter of days. The special features are also worth a watch (I dont say that too often)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Totally not real, but dang I wish it was! Can't wait for the the 4th in the series, there are still loose ends.
0425264351|4.0|This is actually the second Jack Reacher novel I have read, previously I read One Shot which the Tom Cruise movie was based on and the first thing I would point out is that Killing Floor is a totally different sort of plot to that book/movie.  This one's written totally through the main character Jack Reacher's eyes whereas he doesn't even appear in One Shot for quite a while, then we have different character perspectives throughout that book's pages. In Child's first Reacher adventure, you do need to suspend any want for the plot to be plausible, ignore what would really happen in the aftermath of many actions by Reacher as well as accept that Reacher's background clearly doesn't have a speck of possibility of ringing true if he existed real life.  The novel also is fairly formulaic following a standard B Grade type action movie plot, tough guy minding his own business on his way through a small rural town is seen as an easy expendable pawn by the bad guys who of course don't know who they're messing with.  Their attempts to intimidate then get rid of him when that doesn't work after he outsmarts them of course doesn't work and leaves a few bodies behind, as again they don't know who they're messing with. Now he's angry!  But prepared to let it all go and move on as he doesn't need the hassle.  But oh no, they just made it personal!  Now he's going to declare war on them and they've never encountered anything like him before.<br /><br />Saying all that, if that sort of stuff in a book doesn't really hamper a fun read for you (and I'm one of those people), if you're prepared for a book that is fiction after all to be formulatic and cartoon like in it's realism than you're in for an entertaining read.  I quite like TV show characters like Luther, Sherlock Holmes in Elementary or House where the character can notice you missed a spot shaving so therefore must have drunk a certain brand of cola, and the only place you can buy that from since the company stopped distributing it three years ago to shops, was the location next to where the victim stops to go to the bathroom on their way home from work.  Complete b s yes, but hey I like it and Jack Reacher notices clues and solves problems by doing the exact same far fetched thing, so if you're like me you might actually have loved that aspect of the book. If that's not your thing then you probably won't and might want to give this a miss. I also liked how in a split second Reacher can think ten steps ahead of what is about to happen, pulling some obscure fact about hand to hand combat some monk he met while stopping for a sandwich somewhere told him or something while someone is trying to kill him. This again isn't for everyone.<br /><br />There's a lot of plot holes in this (read the one star reviews where many of them are discussed) and the story relies on coincidences occurring to work.  You've also got bad guys who you thought were dead popping up to extend a scene and things like this which is a little bit lazy writing.  Like with One Shot the ending for me was a bit over the top, a lot of reviewers on here have said the whole book was, which I would agree with but the ending for me was like Child just didn't know how to wrap this thing up.<br /><br />Saying all that though I would recommend this book to others, and I am glad I read it.  It is a lot of fun, just completely implausible. But sometimes that's just what you're looking for!uting it three years ago to shops, was the location next to where the victim stops to go to the bathroom on their way home from work.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great read no I have to see the movie, hope the it does the book justice, recommended for everyone old enough.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Not too easy. Not too hard. But way too short. Had fun playing it however,  wish there was a part 2 or the game was later longer.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love iron man 3  the game lists kid eggs huge god logic end outcry herb hth herb high hth
1858705231|5.0|I love it. It comes with the new CD and a book all about the CD and band. It was well worth the extra cost. I took my family to the concert in Atlanta, A and all I can say is that it was the best concert I have ever been to.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|This movie is fun, and has some good effects. Good spin on the old classic fairy tale.  Well acted and a good cast.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|I am a huge JGL fan, but I keep forgetting my rule of thumb, if Bruce Willis is in it, DON'T WATCH!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so fun you get to unlock character's and personally love this game because I never found the right GAME for me and then I found SUBWAY SURFER the best game ever and I think oh wait I know you would think the same thing!<3
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a great game for anybody who loves caring and loving for a horse I a virtual world game this game is awesome
B006N0YWGY|5.0|I love the speed of the racing. Sometimes hard but that makes it more of an adventure and harder.:) you should get it
B000FC146C|5.0|I have read it before and love Sagas about families and their interacting lives. Am a fast reader so like a long story
B009POHHRG|3.0|While the ending has some well-crafted character interaction, the story itself seems to have been written just to frame this finale. I'm not very knowledgeable on Batman in the comic world, so I may be lacking some context, but this story didn't live up to the praise I've heard.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|All I have to say is that I wish that almost every thing was not locked but overall the game is good
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's very challenging and addictive, I can't stop playing it. Each level gets harder and there are more steps to getting out. So it isn't boring!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think every body should own this game because its better than any game in the world nearly get minecraft today
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I have read this book about three times now. This book made me stay up into the late hours of night reading while on the verge of freaking out the whole time. But if you like gaming, have played dungeons and dragons, or like rush then this book is for you. I would recommend this book to any one looking for a very good book to read that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B00BSBUZT6|3.0|The Eagles two disk history is great and reason why I bought the product. The extra disk of the live concert however does not play. This was the reason to replace the first purchase. Even the replacement disk of the concert does not play. I get visual but no audio.<br />This is not the problem of the Sony Blu-Ray player but a problem with this concert disk itself (now the second time around).<br />Please advise as to how I can get a workable product. Again, there is no problem with the two History of the Eagles disks. The problem is with the concert disk.<br />Patricia Fiscarelli
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|Ok, there may be spoilers in this review.<br /><br />I have been wanting this movie for a while.  I have the box set of the other movies.  So, I got this.  When I saw it was 90 some minutes.  I told my mom is was going to suck.  I am just going to tell you the bad stuff.  There was nothing good in my opinion.<br /><br />Ok, while the movie was 90 some minutes, really, it was like 70.  The reason?  he beginning of the movie, there is what I can only guess is a twenty minute car chase.  It just goes on and on and on.  It may be kind of cool at first, but after like 10 minutes is just hits that dull phase.  We actually all started laughing.  You get to see cars flip and fly through the air.  Whatever, it was a waste of time.  This you will find is something that happens many times in the movie.  Your time gets wasted.<br /><br />Now, the story.  I mean, there was none.  Something about someone stealing nuclear stuff from, ready, Chernobyl.  When I heard them say that I was like OH, MY, GOD.  So I guess these people want to steal nuclear stuff to make a weapon.  Alright, the place they want to get it from is so full of nuclear waste and so dangerous that even if you had the most advanced suit with protection, I do not think you would be able to survive even an hour there.  Yet, these terrorist just walk around.  THEN, and this made us all laugh, the father and son go in, fight and walk around with no protection on.  Just la, la, la, walking around a highly filled nuclear zone with no protection.  It was freaking ridiculous.  That is another thing you will see a lot in the movie.  The freaking father and son CAN NOT die.  I mean, they fall from a building, hit some stuff on the side and just survive.  Once, they are in a building and a helicopter is firing in shots from one of those guns.  I am not sure how many rounds a gun like that shoots off.  But let's just say they would be ripped in half.  But, nope.  They survive.  They have a slow motion scene and you see like 5 bullets coming in the building.  Really?  Five bullets.  Some on.  That entire building would be no more.  One scene, the father jumps from a helicopter, fly's through the air and goes in the side of a building.  Guess what?  He is fine.  I mean, they just make is so damn stupid.  These guys can not die.<br /><br />Ok, the father and son have something going on.  The son does not like the father because the father worked to much when the kid was young.  Really?  They try to make their scenes funny and witty.  But I assure you, they are neither.  One scene the father is talking to someone about not being there for his son.  I mean, it is the WORST acting I have ever seen.  Like he is reading right from a piece of paper and putting nothing into it.  At the end, the freaking father and son are getting along great.  Again, really?  The father interrupts a mission the son is on.  I guess the father thinks it is fine to just get into a vehicle and start killing people.  Even though he is not even in the U.S. any more.  They kind of ruined the original movies making the son hate the father.  It just makes the originals feel sad.<br /><br />This movie had so many great actors.  But, the acting was some of the worst I have ever seen.  It was like a cheesy, 70s B movie.  One that you would see at a drive in while high. It really was one of the worst things I have ever seen.  The best part of the movie was the last 20 or 30 minutes.  I think it is because you start to see why some of the stuff is happening.  That or you know the freaking thing is about to end.<br /><br />I almost feel like this movie was made as a joke.  They said \\"hey lets make this movie and make it as stupid and as far from Die Hard as we can.\\"  I have no clue why they even slapped the Die Hard name onto this movie.  This just I don't know.  Not Die Hard at all.  I actually didn't feel like I had even seen Bruce W. in the movie.  That is how bad the acting was.  Just 90 some minutes of pointless, meaningless dribble.  I can not sell the movie.  Again, I have the others and want this to add into my set.  Plus, I paid like $24 and something for it.  I would only loose money.  Just a bad idea to get this movie all around.ss dribble.  I can not sell the movie.  Again, I have the others and want this to add into my set.  Plus, I paid like $24 and something for it.  I would only loose money.  Just a bad idea to get this movie all around.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I watched the season well after it aired on tv via Amazon Prime. Did the series jump the shark with the season finale? I don't know. It is really one of the most enjoyable shows to watch anyway. I understand the director had to deal with certain inevitabilities with a few of the characters/actors, so the ender came off as forced. Aside from the ender, it was another great season to watch. We'll see how it plays out, I guess.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|It's a fun and creative game. You can create many items and people. Don't think this game is easy, there are lots of fantastic challenges.  Well Done!
B00006AVRK|4.0|I was very disappointed that this was not captioned. Even with head phones I missed a lot. Do the Brits all have perfect hearing?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My son got this and now I'm hooked. I wanted to keep it simple but they will not let me.
1594203334|4.0|Like other parenting books, you can glean some useful information from this book. The technique she prescribes which is more French is definitely a more hands off approach to raising your children. For example, at the park, you see a lot of parents on the playground going into the playhouse and playing with their kid. However in France, the parents let their kids play on their own in the playground and they observe in the distance. Overall I think it's a good read and we will take some of the advice on keeping our own space and not letting the kid dominate all of our time!
B0084I2PEO|5.0|This story will touch your heart.  You will cheer and cry for the women in this story.  Each page is a definite turner.  You will be on the edge of your seat as your heart races to discover the turn of events.  Keep a hanky handy, as you will definitely shed a tear.  This book is a required 9th grade reading assignment  for my daughter.  I hope she enjoys it as much as I did
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Most addictive game I have played since Pac man. And that was a long time ago so you know this must be great!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Waited a while for the price on this 3D movie to drop from the $100+ price point; never understood why it was like that. Well worth the wait. Favorite part of the movie- the tree assault.
B008M721MS|4.0|Well, it can be a bit boring cuz u cant call people without paying and stuff. But i guess its ok. I wouldn't give it a 5, thats for sure.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|Not a fan of outrageous fast cars, crazy fights or egos bumping into each other in the name of ownership. But in the words of a teenage kid this movie is &#34;Awesome&#34; just relax and feel the adrenaline rush.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I anxiously awaited this book along with everyone else & was sadly disappointed by the ending or lack there of. I felt like the story kept building with all these different stories and elements being introduced that lead to nowhere. Themis book lacked a climax. After deviouring the first two books of the supposed trilogy I found this one lacking. This serious blew the Fifty Shades series out of the water for me. So much so that I'm \\"Christian who?\\" Team Crossfire here!! I plan to reread the first two books to reignite my love for the series. Crossing my fingers and hoping that Sylvia acknowledges the disappointment of her readers & revives the series in the next book.
B00821OX98|5.0|In my opinion, this series has a great balance of action and drama. Pacing is also spot on, never boring! This is my favorite amongst the many zombie/alien invasion themed shows.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm ready for book #4!! I love how Sylvia makes you fall in love with the characters. I want the books to go on forever!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I am reading this series with my 13 year old daughter.  She loves them and I find them enjoyable as well.  Our favorite of the series is book 3 followed by book 1, 5, 2, and 4 (rated by her, I'm still on book 4).  I like the way the characters develop throughout the series.  Can't wait to see the movie ...
B00821PCJS|4.0|The show has several overarching mysteries and as they answer one they create a new question to keep you guessing about whats going on. Good action and most of the characters are not those generic characters you're used to in TV shows.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addictive<br />It keeps my kids quiet and well behaved i love this game better than temple run
B0055OK2T0|4.0|It was not bad. I would watch it again. It has a cool twist. The love thing was very annoying.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Why think you i gust want to say i love it this awesome book .<br />omg<br />Think you some much for talking to you.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|Story lines that keep you hooked and very complex characters. Love it. Watched the first season on TV and had to know what happened- with no commercials the DVD or streaming is the way to go!
1419702238|5.0|I loved this book! Although I did not order this on amazon so I can't complain about packaging, I love the story<br />It was definetly fun to read I would recommend it to anyone.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Child does a wonderful job of putting everything together in this flashback novel. I'm a huge fan of the Reacher novels and this is one of the best!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|VERY GOOD ADDITION TO MY APP COLLECTION. DOWNLOADED IT 2DAY SO I HAVEN'T REALLY PLAYED IT YET! :-[<br />VERY,VERY,VERY GOOD GAME FOR BORING RAINY DAYS! [ AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO<br />KIDS[MOST LIKELY BOYS] WHEN THEY GET BORED! ;-D ]
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Good game my whole family plays this,1 question,why are the birds mad at the pigs+why are the pigs green,tell me on kik,and as usawal kik me<br /><br />Kik= reznoph
B0054S6N04|2.0|The list was immature at best. Really sex all the time? I'm surprised that the woman were rooting and continuously talking about it. Jaine and Sam's relationship was entirely unbelievable and based purely on lust. Very 2D characters. Mire of this was lust then suspense, though I do give credit to the twist of Corin/Leah. Sad thing is this was all over the place, guys don't read this book, just let someone spoil for u cause it's not worth it. I even didn't care if the characters died it was that bad.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|My pick for Album of the Year. The band has matured into something really special. Not a bad song to be found. The first 3 songs are mind blowing. Buy this now.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|It was okay. I just don't like the way that you have to build the restaurant. And all u do is watch the guest come in and eat and leave. You do get to cook. It is okay.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a real page-turner for me.  I enjoyed the suspense of not knowing how it was going to end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just love how you can have friends on here&lt;3 if you have a Facebook page you can get a bonus
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game 24/7. I love it soooooooooooo I should of capitalized that SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much. I recommend this to all people
1572816295|4.0|So I just received my Paulina Tarot deck, which came in a timely manor. I Love the fae like creatures that really speak to me. Also, it is printed on nice sturdy paper and is clearly printed. Although, I did see some flaws.<br /><br />First of all, the company that published the deck is \\"U.S. Games Systems, INC.\\" and I don't really think of tarot as a game. It (to me) is a tool to help one gain knowledge on their Wiccan journey. I do understand that it is just the name of a company but it still upsets me a bit.<br /><br />Secondly, the description claims it comes with a book containing 48 pages, two of which were notes. This book is just a thin paper thing that goes from the top of my pinky to my wrist. It gives a brief description of each card and only one lay out. So if you don't know much about this form of divination, you may want to purchase a more in depth book on the subject or find material on the internet<br /><br />Other than this, I would highly recommend buying this deck.
0316247545|5.0|This book is really cool.  Lots of fun graphics and character descriptions.  The back of the book even has all the song lyrics.  Considering the price it's a must have for any fan of the show!
B00BC24NT4|3.0|This book was very difficult reading. About half way through, I began to understand was happening and things got better. I think you were supposed to be mystified in the beginning.
B00845MRKE|5.0|If you're a fan of Blade Runner this is the one and only collection for you! A great buy love it!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Greatly enjoyed details of his life as a SEAL. Not so much for the detailed personal narrative provided by his wife.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day is my NEW favorite author! I have read 4 of her books and awaiting the sequel to this trilogy! Love her sensuous  style of writing and her imagination! I can just visualize the characters and setting in all her novels.
B009HOU672|5.0|Certain parts of this remind me of the best parts of My Bloody Valentine-- the epiphanies and majesty of melodic polyphony (some, like our 1 star reviewers, might call it noise... to each his own, I call it shambolic heaven).  Except Richter has broken this down into a more traditional rhythm and lead two track, a la rocknroll.  which is probably why i respond to this on such a humanic, basic level.<br /><br />The general philosophy at play also reminds me of one of my favorite reconstructions from the 90s:  Bill Laswell's take on Miles Davis in \\"Panthalassa\\", though Richter's specific methods remind me distinctly of Phillip Glass in the classical realm and Sigur Ros in the, uh, less classical realm.<br /><br />If you love Vivalidi's original (who doesn't?), then you will learn something, and (absent our cranky 1- and 2-star reviewers) at least like/appreciate it.<br /><br />Unqualified, highest praise.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is a great TV show; full of surprising twists. Great characters both good & evil. You will want to watch the DVDs straight through!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It took me several hours, but no better way to weather a layover or long flight. Looking forward to their next installment.
B005H5H3LW|5.0|Really enjoyed this film one of the best from japan lots of action space fights fantastic graffics loved its lots will be watching it again and again
B009IH0ICG|5.0|If you DON'T need an entire full-size chimney of coals, this is exactly what you need. If you fill up the full-size chimney only half way, there will be big gaps among the briquets.  This smaller chimney stacks together smaller amounts of briquets for efficient starting.  It is especially useful when using with my Smokenator in the Weber Kettle - you need to heat only about 16-20 briquets for the Smokenator.  This smaller chimney is ideal for that.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Can't wait for now rooms. Very challenging &amp; keeps you wondering/ figuring out how &quot;what goes where &amp; how it goes?&quot;
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Great game for adults or kids. Prepare to have lots of fun. Time just flies by.<br />Battle others or just play the computer. See you in the game.<br /><br />.
B003NS1JHY|5.0|Nuf said. Will Smith is hilarious! He's still in his comedy days, but can see him get a little more serious in this film which is cool.
B00AAU7AI0|5.0|This book is full of wisdom and good advice on how to live and let live without getting preachy it lets you discover the uniqueness of our existence as human beings
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|So easy to use!  Quickly it tells me what I am looking for.  Better than the others I have used in the past.
B008FQ1O1K|5.0|This book lets you think on time as a commodity rarer than gold! Time is precious, we all agree, but in THETIMEKEEPER you get the feeling that it is deeper than that. Time in itself is also alive and forever.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Excellent show, drama and intrigue!! I really love it.  My family enjoy every minute.  The first time I use amazon prime and I don't regret it. It gets better each season.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I have this app on my kindle fire and it works great! You can choose the difficulty level for the computer which is nice if you suck at chess like me.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|This is amazing and wonderful  read for the beach . I downloaded on my Kindle and I love this book.  I have read it at least ten times!
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|Absolutely love it. I've been an avid fan since Fate of Norns and this album doesn't dissapoint. Amon Amarth continues to deliver that brutal high-energy viking goodness we've all come to know and love. More than that though they have continued to grow and experiment with their style. Hel, Track 8, contains some interesting sync'd guttural/clean vocals that I think worked out very well. The riffs and transitions throughout the album are great and varied. Amongst a sea of other metal acts that seem to stagnate or even devolve into a muddy mess of generic sounding crap, AA continues to shine and grow with each new album. Going to be even harder to wait for their next delivery after Deceiver of the Gods!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I really like this Doctor! I was saddened when he left the show. Oops spoilers! If you're reading this and know the show you will understand the reference.
B00004R99F|4.0|I bought this for my nephew. He loves goofy so it is great. It keeps he thoroughly entertained It is a great movie.
B00B2DSK06|4.0|It is definitely a kids movie.  There is a story to it but is fun action.  My granddaughter enjoyed it.  She watches it all the time.
B003VS0CWY|5.0|This was a gift he loves this movie and didn't own it. I'm so glad I was able to find it for a good price on here. It was worth the money.
B003L77FYS|4.0|I have only seen a couple episodes, but Season 3 looks the same as the first 2 seasons, so if you liked those, you will like the 3rd season, and vice versa.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so much fun because there is different themes and new people in the game and trust me u will love it
B00AC8ZJPQ|1.0|Could not stand another minute of this. Bad acting, weak plot, unknown actors. A bunch of wimpy kids trying to be tough. Really bad.
B0058YPILY|5.0|Criminal Minds is our favorite as we enjoy the role each character plays on the Team and each episode is so well written.  The program is real life and ethical.  Their may be some dramatic, bloody scenes but it is true to life and the language is not offensive.<br />Excellent program.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Kinda hard to follow at times. I would watch it again but its too long to watch twice. Its not a bad movie, I think its just average. A good movie to watch on a long plane flight.
B005VPRETE|5.0|I got this for my friend's daughter for Christmas.  She opened it and screamed she was so happy.  I come from a LEGO family so I can tell you, for kids that are creative, you can't go wrong with these little LEGO sets.  Its very affordable too unlike some of the larger sets.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I really liked this movie. Had me jumping in my seat a few times. Pretty creepy and startling at times. I recommend watching this.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I am so sad to say... I was not a huge fan of this book.  I am a HUGE zombie fan, as well as a fan of end-of-the-world scenario books, but this one was disappointing.  I don't want to give anything away but all I will say is that there are no real characters to follow, that you become invested in.  It jumps from disaster to disaster.  Is was entertaining, but I guess I just prefer getting to know some characters.  The good thing about the movie is that they take the cool things from the book, and give us characters.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The way the author set this story up has been much different from most books I've<br /> read.<br /> I'm enjoying the book very much.
B0079KGAOY|5.0|Must we even ask how many stars this should get???  Its Lethal Weapon movies!!  My fave is the one with Jet Li.  This was a great deal and if you collect movies, you gotta have these in your movie library.
B008JEJPT6|4.0|On my feet all day at work and these Crocs are great. Very Comfortable and give me a lot of support.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|I really try not to burn out movies, so this is one that I really like, but have only watched three times (spaced out over three years), and I sware it gets better every time.  I've loved Star Trek for years (mainly next generation onward because of my age), and getting my wife into it was impossible.  That all changed with this movie, and she is now addicted.<br />Even my sister (who is not into scifi at all) is brought to tears in the first five minutes (and admitted it).<br />We all saw the newest star trek, which is very good, but having gone back and watched this one... I have to admit its much better.  It'll be hard to ever top this one.<br />Kudos.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Kept me entertained from the beginning to the end! Definitely going to read the next two before the next movie comes out!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Life after death is not new for me, since in Hindu culture it is an aboriginal idea. God is with you, always and within,  and Loves you....&#34;You are Loved&#34;. The idea is very well depicted.
B007HPO3CC|5.0|My husband really loves this tv series.  I bought it for him as a gift.  He has enjoyed watching over and over again!
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|Of the three HexLogics I have downloaded, HexLogic Hot Air is my favorite. The bright picture of the hot air balloons lend themselves well to this game.
B00594XOZU|5.0|GET IT!!! !!!! No doubt at all that this app is great. It works fast and Is a great app if your parents wont let you get a phone yet.
B002J301NM|5.0|I went to Grays Papaya in NY just because of this movie. I wish it were for purchase because I can watch it over & over! Salma Hayak is fantastic and (while over the top) Mathew Perry really is in love with her - you can just tell!
B0090KZDSK|4.0|Great Trilogy.. Was hoping for a better ending, but I'm thinking it may be left open for book four should Sylvia Day feel the need  to take it further :-)
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|This is so much fun the whole family can enjoy. The kids get the most out of it when he repeats what they say.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is so well written with interesting characters who are each so well developed.  Each aspect of the series is wonderful.  I enjoy following each of the rich and varied characters.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game keeps the kids busy while I am doing something else, they try to compete with each other with it.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I was not sure what to expect compared to the book, but overall it was a great movie to watch.
B009R659L8|5.0|Have not read yet  but sure. It will be just as good as all others!  Usually great summer read.  Thanks
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Not your typical courtroom drama.. filled with twists and turns. I love a book with an unexpected ending and this book delivers.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Started slow, but once it picked up, I couldn't put it down. Reminds me of The Hunger Games. Looking forward to The Scorch Trials.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Anita Moorjani is the link I have been searching for with respect to tapping into the Universal Mind.<br /><br />Her riveting account of her NDE and her life before and after it is truly inspiring. I eagerly await an opportunity to see her and hear her story delivered verbally.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Was a great game, have played it more than one time. It's worth getting it and playing over and over.  Hope a 3rd game is being made
B008OOYALE|2.0|I really like the game however it is really difficult to expand cause it cost a lot of coins and/or gold to get anywhere. It is certainly not the kind of game to want to spend a lot of time on cause each goal and or project takes days to complete either cause it takes several hours for items to get finished and lots of coins to even start a project. (If your looking for a game like this but would like to play for a few hours at a time try Dragonvale) The dragons are cute but they all have the same cartoonie look about them. (Again if you are looking for a larger variety of dragons try Dragonvale.) The thing that may tick a person off is how you think your clearing an area for more room after several thousands of coins and several hours, once done surprise  you find more brush/plants under neath which will cost you over a million to get rid of plus another day. Man I would have quit at that point but my son started the dragonvale account and I don't have the heart to take it over.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I had heard that the books and the HBO series was great and I finally started reading them. I'm very happy that I did and it's hard to stop reading and can't wait to get into the rest of the series.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|I love this band & this CD is just what I expected from them.  I am glad I found it!
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|Ok, before I'm starting off my review of this movie, I want to ask as I was browsing through the review section of this and people think this oriented towards zombies and/or something rated 'R'. I highly doubt they'd do anything that gruesome in a movie like this, especially a KIDS show no less! Why are people making reviews of a trailer/movie that doesn't exist? What the....? -_-'<br /><br />Anyway, onto the review of the ACTUAL movie:<br /><br />Meghan McCarthy, you blew me away!!!!!!! I mean, WOW, I came into a theater with low expectations, but it pretty much blew my expectations off the wall! I like the fact that they actually establish a reason for Twilight to even go into this other dimension (aka the human world), since someone stole her crown to use it for diabolical deeds. This also had some nods from Season 1, episodes 1-2, where she had to make friends in order to reach her goal to not only retrieve her crown back, but also beat an enemy that wanted to take over the world, plus also had DERPY with a MUFFIN!!!! That made my day (what made it even more hilarious was that my friends didn't even notice Derpy walking in a song sequence, but a bunch of little kids saw her too)! lol XD<br /><br />Again, this movie blew away my expectations in the water... I'll definitely buy this DVD/Blu-ray/Digital release! I mean only for $20? That's a deal right there!!!!<br /><br />One more thing:<br /><br />Quote from Pinkie Pie, \\"I'm so NERVI-CITED!!!\\" XD<br /><br />Well, I hope we can see the home release come in soon (another month or so as stated in the release date)! It's a must-see for all people of different ages! Heck, if this movie got not only kids to see it, but also me and my friends to enjoy it, it's an AWESOME (20% cooler!) movie for sure! ;)
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|My husband and I had heard a lot of good things about the movie but found it a little boring.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Every situation has various viewpoints, this explores the conflict from a different perspective.  Very well written and a &#34;can't put down&#34; genre book.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I love this show and season 3 was fantastic. Can't wait to see next season.I did have a little trouble downloading it initially but customer service was helpful and said to wait a bit and that worked.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I enjoyed this film very much that I watched it twice. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a soppy story with a happy ending
B000000WFU|3.0|I like the music of Karl Jenkins, but I have to admit that a little bit goes a long way. Great for car rides.
B005TF24GO|5.0|My child with autism loves this movie  but she loves the peacock  ( shen ) but once again the only toy that you can find is just a little tiny one  it would be nice if you are going to make these movie could you pleasemake toys to go with them
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game. it works off and on line. it gets faster the longer you play. the different themes are very interesting. you choose your own character and board. one of the best games you could find.
B0014KI57K|5.0|I've waited years to find to proper copy of this record. And did. So worth the wait I may just wear out my record player.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|If you like Iron Man, this is a fun one to add to your Kindle Fire apps. And, it's free.
0345803507|2.0|This onne turned into a suspense novel which made me nervous.... did not finish it. I read the ending to see if it all turned out right.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Classic scene with Hulk thrashing Loki.  Every fanboy's dream realized - live action fight between:  Thor & Ironman; Thor & America; Thor & Hulk; Hulk & Black Widow; Hawkeye & Black Widow; and of course, bad guy, Loki.  Can't wait for the sequel!
B0089LOG02|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much and learned a lot about the way orphans were treated during that era.  Would definitely recommend this book.
1781162646|3.0|This novel was just OK, perhaps I expect too much from SK now. It is certainly NOT the Gunslinger series.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|This movie is a must see. The acting is outstanding. The story is one of triumph, humor, compassion, and learned life lessons.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Thus book was great read it late at night and at some parts I was laughing some crying th we book was all out excellent
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is good and I really like it is cool you should try it. TRY THIS GAME YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Rolled down my face as I almost p______ed myself!!!!! Loved this book.  Drew and Kate are just so good together.  You would want to sit and hang out with them.  Great read!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like challenges...  its like a puzzle; find ur hidden clues and pieces...  I enjoy playing this with my 8 yr old.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|The goal of this game is simple: Buy and sell goods while going from place to place trying to get the most money and running from the cops. There is NO speed control or breaks, which gives the game a certain level of difficulty. There is bonus money for each round (when you go from place to place) and you try to get the silver and gold money bags on the way. Both bonus money and money bag amounts increase after every round. You can hit a multitude amount of items, from alligators to houses. Hitting items does slow you down, though it seems (for me) almost impossible to miss most of them.<br /><br />There are three controls: touching the screen (left/right side of screen), tilt, and one for a gamepad as well. The touch control was kinda hard to use as it doesn't seem like the boat would turn as fast as I wanted it to go (I even tried pressing down and tapping the sides). So, I ended using tilt (at 4/10 sensitivity since 7/10 would turn the boat too fast). Tilt was much easier to use, however, there were times when tilt just stopped working for a few seconds. Other than that, I had no problems on my kindle fire with this game.<br /><br />The graphics were decent and I liked the animation of hitting the various objects. The sounds were good. However, I'm starting to think the cops were added just for fun, since none of them could drive their boats.<br /><br />Overall, a fun game, even if I'm not able to play for too long without having to switch to something else. For $1, I think this game is very well priced. I would recommend this game to older kids-adults (as the lack of speed control may make it harder for some younger kids) and anyone who wants a new game to try out!
B000GDH9JQ|4.0|There is some decent acting here, and the superb dancing makes the film worth watching; with a believable plot line.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Well written, heart wrenching read. The love, joy, and pain of the well established characters could be felt deeply with every word on the page. Excellent way to spend a summer afternoon.
0316247545|5.0|I was surprised when I got this on how small it was. Definitely smaller than I thought it would be. However it has 256 full color pages and seems very high quality. I love it!<br /><br />Get it. You know you want to.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|cant wait for more rooms<br /> t<br /><br />cant wait to be challenged with some more rooms.  I thoroughly enjoyed this game. I found it to be challenginag and fun.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|It makes you use real money. My mom asked my sister how you got 123 cards!!! She said&quot;I use real money to get it&quot;
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|I like it. It gave me a good night. That girl finally do sth stupid is weird. That's not a good destination.
0345529057|5.0|Absolutely the best price and a satisfactory quality,no problem about the manufacturing.<br />I couldn't expect anything more. Can't wait to start the reading.
B009T8XBBO|4.0|Fun little game and a good way to pass time when I'm bored or waiting for something to get finished up.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The can you escape game is awesome it challenging nut fun. It's also creative each level is mysterious and I love I hope you enjoy it to.
B0073TZ1AA|4.0|I give a high rating because it worked the first time, and after that too.<br />I don't like that it doesn't change pages on the screen as it reads each page, It's great for studying, all I have to do is listen.<br />Works great for me, reads a little slow, but, I'm not much faster.
B007N85POS|4.0|I have this game on my cell. I really like it and was so glad to get it on my kindle fire hd.
B0063IH60K|3.0|good game to pass time away if you are a solitaire player. I've seen better with more options and layouts but this app does what it's supposed to do. if you're looking to pass time away......... play on!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I just downloaded this a while ago. I haven't used it a lot yet but like fine it so far.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Magic 2014 is the best magic game I have ever played besides the real thing!  The sealed deck mode is awesome and allows for a lot of creativity!
6305692572|2.0|I bought this movie cus I like Andy Garcia I think hes a good actor.when the movie started I liked Meg Ryan and andys chemistry but the movie gets boring quick I thought it was Gonna be a cute little comedy but it wasnt.I did not like Meg Ryan in this Andy outshined her but the script was bad.I wanted to turn off the movie in the middle but I was waiting to see if it got better but it didnt so the only thing that kept me from shutting it off was andys good looks Lol I started focusing on how hot he looked in the movie and forgeting about the story.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|We received the cassette sooner than we expected, and were thoroughly pleased with the music we found there!  McCartney showcases his love of music and his versatile song-styling.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the bomb .com. I looooovvveeee it the horse is amazing SOOOOOOOO realistic you actually feel like your on a stable taking care of the horse
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I was looking for a book to read when I saw this gorgeous man on the cover of a book called Beautiful Illusions[[ASIN:B00DKGZT7A Beautiful Illusions.I had to get this book to find out what his name was. Upon reading this book I found myself so drawn in. I had a hard time putting the book down. This isn't your regular run of the mill romance novel. It has a great story, an interesting plot and some really good character's. I really love it!!! I can't wait to read the sequel.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this app is so awesome  because it stress your brain and makes you think and its fun to find the hidden stuff and make things open and close with codes my only complaint is more levels please :)
B00A50PDDY|5.0|It's rare when I listen to a band that I automatically love them. It's even more rare when I play that music at a party or in the car and all of my friends like it too. The reason: this band covers so many genres of music in every song. At times they're a rock band, other times they're rappers. Sometimes they get into house/electronic sounds and other times they sound like a metal band. And that all happens within every song. All that, plus the crazy tempo changes make for a completely fresh and invigorating sound. I definitely recommend this album to anyone looking for that new band to listen to.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This game was just as riveting as the first one. I hope that there will be a part 3. Believe me, the Jangada deserves it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I've been meaning to read this for a long time. I wanted to read it before watching it. The world George R.R. Martin created is so detailed and in-depth. The various lands have their own cultures, customs, and histories. Reading about them is really cool! I also like that each chapter goes to a different character. It gives you a better understanding of the world and the plot. The author is also really good with suspense and cliffhangers! I don't want to post any spoilers in this review, so that's all I'm going to say :) But seriously, READ THIS BOOK!
B004GYY714|5.0|A very nice selection of internet radio stations.  Has been working without a hitch on my Nexus 7.  Highly recommended.
B00CRMWMZ0|1.0|Bought into the hype and purchased this album, only to be disappointed. A couple decent tracks, but seemed like it contained 90% of just 'filler' content. Get Lucky is a really good track. I really liked Daft Punk for being so cutting edge, but was just bored with the album. You'll find yourself skipping most tracks.
1611761808|4.0|I listened to this book on an audio CD.  I've listened to many books in the last<br />10 years, but these three readers were the worst.  For two especially, it seemed as<br />if English was their 3rd or 4th language, and it was a definite challenge to understand<br />what they were saying.  In spite of this, I really liked the book, think it's Hosseini's<br />best.  But I might have to read it as well as I'm sure I missed many nuances of the<br />plot.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Excellent performance from Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic need more scenes with Jon Huerta and Tamala Jones there anther reason I watch the show Love it
B003G4W49C|5.0|I love this book and have read it many times Orsen did an amazing job of taking me into the books.  I think it is a must read
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This is a great book that I  funny in some parts but the saddest book I've ever read in ways
B005K17RU0|5.0|The other weather apps I've tried haven't been user-friendly. This app is simple to navigate. It also offers features which other weather apps don't, including hourly forecasts, news footage, and multiple map location settings.  And best of all, it's free!  So it's at least worth a try.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not to hard, but pretty challenging. I like that there are no hints.....you have to just figure it out on your own.
B0053JJLLC|3.0|I am a fan of Crichton and loved all his books so I was excited when I saw there was one more book. If you read \\"Micro\\" expecting Crichton, you'll be disappointed.  However, I don't think the book is all that bad.  The science isn't up to the level you'd expect from Crichton but it's a fun read.  I enjoyed the book after I let go of the expectations.  I bought my copy in the remainder pile at my local bookstore and it's worth the $6 I paid for it.
B00881PTRC|4.0|I just love the set up and the &#34;character&#34; during play;<br />you guess the letters needed and if you continue to<br />guess incorrectly, the &#34;character&#34; does some funny<br />things! It's a Keeper for me!
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Perhaps not as good as his earlier works, but definitely an entertaining book worth reading.  Some of the science is to scary to think of and gives one hope at the same time. Rollins is a master of disguising his wish to make you think in a shoot'em up adventure theme. Go Ahead! It's good.
B00B29J0I6|4.0|and it's a change up from playing Solitaire (for anyone that plays, to pass the time)<br />I found it interesting to play. You need to figure out how to get Roby into the<br />shipping crate, through different scenarios.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|When I saw Nutty Fluffies Rollercoaster on the app store I wasn't too sure about it. Then I was at my friend's house but I had to stay for extra time because it was raining. while I was over there she showed me this app on her nook. Once I saw how fun it was I was super excited about downloading it on my kindle fire. Now this is in my favorites and I could never delete it. very addictive but in a good way. Trust me ;)
B004EPYZZ8|4.0|of this young woman is so uplifting! I really<br />enjoyed seeing her story and know what<br />a wonderful woman she has continued to be!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'd never read any of Nicholas Sparks' books before, although I've watched several of the movies that were made from his books and always loved them. I decided to read Safe Haven before watching the movie this time. I was not disappointed! I fell in love with Alex and his children in addition to Katie... The characters were so well developed and I felt as though I was in the story with them...feeling their sadness and excitement as they were experiencing it. I had such a hard time putting the book down even when I had to go to sleep or work. The suspense in the story really surprised me, as I was just kind of expecting a love story, and I absolutely loved that! I'm hooked now and I will definitely be reading many more of his novels. Beautifully written!
B00004XPPC|4.0|Fictional movies are created to amuse and distract ordinary people from the doldrums of their daily lives and they sometimes deviate from plausible reality to achieve that purpose.<br /><br />I enjoyed this work despite the controversy around the film's historical inaccuracies. I thought the plot of the story, the appealing cinematography of the geographic region and the performances of Alec Guinness, William Holden, Sessue Hayakawa and others presented credible entertainment. I recommend the movie to all
B000058983|5.0|Love's 3rd album \\"Forever Changes\\", (1967), is an album everyone who loves rock, pop and jazz should hear.  Released in late '67, this would be Arthur Lee's masterstroke of genius.  Their first two albums were both 5 stars, but this upped the anti to 6 stars!  This album has many flavors,  folk, pop, psychedelia, jazz and a little country.  This album was produced by Arthur and Bruce Botnick (who later produced The Doors).  They were going to use session musicians, but the band finally got into it, after listening to some of the tracks Arthur laid down.  The string and horn arrangements were done by David Angel.<br />The leadoff track may go down as one the best songs of the 60's, Bryan MaClean's tune \\"Alone Again Or\\", this is a drop dead classic!  Sweet acoustic guitar with Mexican trumpets and beautiful strings.  Bryan couldn't reach the notes in this song, so, Arthur sang it.  The 60's vibe lyrics written by Lee, \\"A House Is Not A Motel\\", with some stinging guitar by Johnny Echols, Michael Stuart brings the beat in this one also.  Arthur gives us the string laden ballad \\"Andmoreagain\\", \\"And i'm wrapped in my armor\\".  \\"The Dailey Planet\\", is a great pop song, with flooding acoustic guitars, with nice signature swings, on this track session musicians appeared.  MaClean gave us another winner in \\"Old Man\\", Ken Forssi's bass is so smooth here, Bryan's vocals are so delicate, some nice horns.  Arthur Lee's \\"The Red Telephone\\", was about the bomb, is another fine example of 60's writing, this song has that psychedelic feel with some great swirling strings, \\"There locking 'em up today, I wonder who it will be tomorrow, you or me\\".  \\"Maybe The People Would Be The Times Or Between Clark And Hilldale\\", (what a title), this jazzy number with those horns and acoustic guitars, splendid indeed.  They let it fly at the end of \\"Live And Let Live\\", Love at their very best!  \\"The Good Humor Man He Sees Everything Like This\\", (wow, Arthur had a thing for long titles), the sweet horns and strings make this a keeper of a tune.  The strut of \\"Bummer In The Summer\\", some nice picki' here.  And the album closes with the pure L.A. feel song, \\"You Set The Scene\\", nice strings and horns and the band just sounded great, \\"You look so lovely, with that same old smile\\".<br />Bonus material include the demo \\"Hummingbirds\\", early version of \\"The Good Humor Man\\",  produced by Jac Holzman , recorded in 1966.  The sunny bright pop-psych of \\"Wonder People (I Do Wonder)\\",  but you know this tune has to be a little dark.  The alternate mix's of \\"Alone Again Or\\" and \\"You Set The Scene\\".  A very interesting track is the recording of \\"Your Mind And We Belong Together\\", with run throughs, \\"Relax a little guys, take 36\\", good stuff, Arthur taking control.  Then we get the final version of \\"Your Mind\\", the time signature's with Echols guitar and Forssi's bass are amazing!  \\"Laughing Stock\\", is a nice little romp.  This line-up would break up after this release, Arthur would bring in a new band for Love's 4th release \\"Out Here\\".  Like  i said everybody that loves rock, pop and jazz should listen to Love's \\"Forever Changes\\".
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|After reading Kite Runner, I was motivated to follow up with the next Hosseini book. While it isn't as moving as Kite Runner, it is certainly a masterpiece in its own right. There is bravery in bringing to light the hardships and struggles of female in Afghanistan, as this country still has a long way to go when it comes to equality (I'm currently in Afghanistan). That said, it is fitting because females in Afghanistan are exceptionally brave and deserve a tribute like this.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next one!
B0095P31L6|5.0|This was our second time watching the movie and we still laughed and smiled...the movie is just so realistic - in what the life is all about, what characters you meet in it and how to best live it to the fullest.<br /><br />Johnny Depp made the movie what it is, that's for sure, but there's plenty of characters that make you say: &#34;I know that guy!&#34;
B008ROGZUU|5.0|Georgiou and Jonas kaufmann worth the money spent on buy it.<br />The quality of sound and image is normal on Covent Garden's productions. Terfel wondrous as ever. Scenary superb.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Soooo good. I love this show & you will too.<br />Never watched it while it was on tv, but once I started on prime I was hooked
B0090KZDSK|5.0|not as good as 1 & 2 but i loved it reading it the 3 rd time a waitng for the continuation of the series
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Typical Grisham, great story and well written. Once you through the first few chapters it has you guessing what's going on.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This game may look really fun but look at the pictures. Or just try it out. Very hard to control, bad graphics, and its ridiculous that you have to buy mostly everything. So scratch what I said, don't get it.
B001P4ESGC|4.0|Two leading actresses make this work, along with interesting cases &#34;ripped from the headlines&#34;.  Good support from award-winning actors like Ted Danson also help.  I watched all seasons and, while I tired of the zig-zag nature of the relationship between the two women, I was interested in the outcome.
B00CD4RPWM|4.0|So fun to see a visual representation of Outlander. It actually translates to a graphic format quite well. Give me more!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Super easy. Fun. Enjoyable, creative and I think this fun. No brain left? Play this. It did load fast. Like the tilt driving. Sure my 2 year old will beat me soon.
B001Q9J4PG|3.0|Pretty preachy. Unblelievable made almosy believable in the madmen and woman who want to kill almost everyone tp 'save' the planet.  But was UNBELIEVABLE that neafr the end scientists and englineers would leave a well construted builiding to go head to head with 'TRAINED highly armed commandos in the jungle.<br /><br />But I do love what Clark does to the Nature Worshipers' in the end. More or less saying if you 'natural' order so much see how you do doing with it?
B008IJTFYW|5.0|i LOVE this app and i use it all day every day to calm my two month old baby....for a free app it has tons of options including the vacuum cleaner (my baby's favorite) and lots of other neat calming sounds that I enjoy as well. This app is a lifesaver!
B00CE0BJQ8|5.0|This CD (album) is a rarity nowadays- one you can put on and listen from start to finish.  No fillers.  The lead vocalist is of the same mold as Ed Sheeran, and it's good to see those two linking up (youtube passenger and ed sheeran).  Both great talents.  Both British :)  Putting the 'Great' back in Great Britain.<br /><br />Edit:  Make sure you get the 2 CD Deluxe edition that just came out 6/25/2013
B007IXWKUK|4.0|yes they're raunchy, but i enjoy the story line as well of christian's tortured past and their unconditional love for eachother. i read every night while I nurse my baby before bed and I have a hard time stopping :)
B005AV93JI|5.0|In the epic Indian scripture Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna teaches Arjuna &#34;Arjuna, thinking of whatever entity one leaves the body at the time of death, that and that alone one attains, being ever absorbed in its thoughts.&#34;<br /><br />I am sure Chris was focused on that one thing alone which he searched for throughout his young life. And I am sure he would have found what he was looking for, laying inside the sleeping bag stitched by his mother, alone in the trailer bus among wilderness of Alaska. I am sure his mother & father also got their peace when they saw the place where Chris spent his last few months, all alone, in the wilderness. Starving to death must not be a very pleasant experience, I know people who do all sorts of crimes and face dangerous situations, degrade their life, just to avoid having an empty stomach. But Chris choose this path voluntarily. I think it was easier for us in India to understand and appreciate what he was going through and did with his life. Aren't we all at times tempted to leave everything and head for the secluded mountains and forests in search for inner peace and to find the answers to those hard questions of life, the truth of why we are living.<br /><br />There is only a couple of years difference between Chris and my age. in early years of 1990's when he was started hitchhiking after his graduation, to find the answers to his inner questions, I too was facing extremely difficult situations and from early childhood the question of finding the ultimate truth of life is the one repeating itself in my mind 24x7. But I could not afford to do what Chris did, I think I lacked the courage that Chris had. I struggled to stand up on my feet, support my mother and my family. I used to think those that that once I get over these priorities I would try and quench my own thirst of knowledge, I would try to find the answers the the questions which haunt me in the wilderness of Himalayas. But then, not everybody is as brave as Chris.<br /><br />I think Chris would have got his answers, found what he was looking for, in the solitude of that trailer bus in Alaska. And and think for sure that he would have reached his ultimate goal, got his peace within his heart and soul. I am also sure that his mother and father would have got their peace too when they saw the beautiful place where Chris spend his final months. Sleeping inside the bad his mother stitched. He may have died of starvation of body, but I am sure his heart and soul were fully nourished and content with what he achieved in the short duration he spent on this planet earth.
B00000J048|5.0|I can't say enough how great these are.  My 3 year old absolutely loves these and they added onto the Tech Set by Quercetti and now we can do even more.  The tech set is definitely geared toward older kids but my son and husband will play with these gears for and hour uninterrupted.  And if you have a 3 year old you understand how that's a REALLY LONG TIME to hold their attention!<br />I have now purchased this Kaleido Gears set as a gift for several friends and their little ones all with positive feedback!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is a fun tile matching game that will easily suck up time when you're playing on your phone.  If I didn't get it free as part of the Free App of the day I would buy it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this book!<br />You will have to read it and enjoy it as much as I have.<br />I take my time reading it because I don't ever want it to end.  Such a great love story with sexual twist fit for the characters.  I love Sylvia Day.  Thank you so much.
B00B7ERH04|3.0|The video quality and sound quality are good. The files are too big to email from my Kindle, and there is no sharing mechanism for sharing to You Tube, FB, Google, etc. Just email.
1439153663|5.0|A lot of research went into this book.  The suffering and heartbreak the slaves had to endure is heartbreaking.  The novel brought to light the plight of indentured servants in US history.
B000SZK41M|4.0|The 'Die Hard' series almost seems like it is getting out of hand with ridiculous action scenes, but the original here to me is the best.  Alan Rickman does a great job playing the sinister foe and even does a pretty funny impersonation in the movie.  Great 80's movie for anyone wanting to be entertained!
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Great story...just read the first page or two and see if it's for you.<br />An amazing adventure with soul searching reflection, too.<br />It had to be that long, and still could have read on and on...
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I've seen this important film several times and will again.  It's an enlightening perspective of how our country really began with as much information as a large history book but much more entertaining to watch.  I really appreciate the attention to accuracy and its best viewed with the onscreen historical guide.  One of my top two all time favorites!
B003FL4O9E|5.0|Great movie to keep kids and adults attention. Great for both to watch. My kids are 5 and 6 just starting to watch some movies with real people in then and not cartoons and this was a great movie. Bad quality though but that is amazons fault not the movie
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Addictively fun! Unlike any other digital game I've played. This would appeal to many but especially those who enjoy Clue.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A very exciting sequel, dark but also inspiring.  It is not difficult to connect some of the tragic injustices of the human race in this fictional story to our own present and past.  Very thought provoking.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Addictive and makes time go faster when bored. I like that they change it up about monthly to make it more interesting. However I don't have friends that play so challenges involving friends never get completed.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Hans Zimmer has done it again and with such force that it would be difficult to say that this isn't the best soundtrack in a while. People need to play it over several times to really appreciate the creative ingenuity he has developed throughout this composition.  There are tracks on this album that bring you to sudden appreciation of all that goes into creating a composition such as this right down to a track that evokes a feeling of steel within the music.  You will need to find that one on your own.  However many stars there are, this one deserves them all.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins can sure tell a story wrapped aound scientific and historical facts. This novel is another of his compelling reads that also makes you stop and think. A great read.
1476733953|5.0|I loved the world the writer designed.  I didn't love the ending, but will still read the sequel.  Maybe that will redeem it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I wanted to read this long established book based on the realease of a film based on the book. I like to read the books before the film so I can more fully appreciate the story. I was certainly glad I read Ender's Game. I don't know how the film will stack up against the book, but the book was a very enjoyable read. I can see why this book has developed a strong following sinces its initial publication.
B002RHL8DC|5.0|I loved this series.  It is realistic, imaginative, high production value, and deals with serious issues while remaining humorous (sarcastic mainly) at most times.  With the new premise of the gate ship and seed ship, it opens up so many possibilities and they were just beginning to scratch the surface of what this series could have been.  There is some great acting, and some okay acting.  I found this on a different video streaming site, as I rarely watch live tv and don't care what is trending (i.e. glee, grey's, voice, etc.) and after realizing it was a SyFy show that had been cancelled I wrote to SyFy for the first time ever contacting a media outlet about a loss of programming and begged them to bring it back.  What a shame.  If you like BSG, other SG series, Lost, x-files, this is for you.  If you have Amazon Prime I recommend a marathon viewing of at least the first three or four episodes, if not the whole first season, there is no reason not to.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Reveals truths we often don't want to accept about influencing others and how to do it. Worth reading and re-reading!
B005OCFGTO|4.0|The first thing he did was pack them up and take them along on a trip so he could share all of them with some of his other relations.  He had a wonderful time and they watched all of the 8 movies.
1446303314|5.0|I recommend this book and it pattern to who ever enjoy  fairy tales easily understood patterns and beautiful picture of items.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love this game. Great to play with my daughter. She absolutely loves helping find all of the items and gets so excited when we reach a new level.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was an interesting, engaging book to read. Although all characters seemed to be &#34;damaged&#34; they were likable, except for Dad. I have not seen the movie yet, but after reading the book I definitely will.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|My husband and I watched the entire season in 3  nights.  Love the characters and the beautiful setting, well maybe not the war, but the castle is beautiful.  We are hooked and have already begun season 3.
B006C1DH92|5.0|The whole family loved Fruit Ninja, but we were getting a bit tired of just trying to get the highest score since we won all the blades.  This is a great new twist.  More stuff to unlock, and fun games.  I just got it and have had no problems.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|I bought the series with only seeing the miniseries and meeting some fans at comic con. It is totally awesome. I'm only on season two because I'm trying to make it last as long as possible. The premise is fascinating to all of us (the end of our world) but you also have the intrigue of space travel. Humans are so very human that you just have to yell at them sometimes and hope that it works out. I'm very happy I bought this set.
