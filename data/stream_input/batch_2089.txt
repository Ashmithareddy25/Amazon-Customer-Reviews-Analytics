B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I heard about this book after a 6th grade class had it for a read aloud. I decided I'd read it to see how it is. It was very good!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great app! If you don't already have it you should totaly get it! It is amazing! GET IT NOW!!!!!!:)
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Thought it was by great could not put it down.  Loved the price of it as well. Thanks so much
B005K0HDGE|5.0|What a wonderful story!  Mr. King presents a compelling situation and story, and I was thoroughly involved from the very beginning.  At the end of the day, this is a love story set in a framework with President Kennedy's assassination a focal point, but it is so much more.  The characters are people I came to really care about.  Highly recommended!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Inspiring and thought provoking.  Comforting if you've lost someone and thought provoking if you wonder what may happen in the afterlife.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much.l am so glad my friend made me buy it. l would recommend this game to every one who likes to have fun!
B006MW3V6U|2.0|My family and I love this series and after enjoying the first season with Netflix, we were pleased to find that we could stream Season 2 using amazon prime.  Unfortunately, unlike the Netflix product, Amazon does not provide subtitles, which makes streaming of limited use for family members who are non-native English speakers, those with hearing impairments, or those who simply are not used to various English accents.  We were particularly disappointed to learn this only AFTER we had paid and started streaming the first episode.  I understand that Amazon has exclusive rights to Downton Abbey Season 2.  What a shame we won't be watching it here. Hope that they work on getting a subtitled product like their competitors did for Season 1.
B00A4OALL0|5.0|What a line up.  Music of the highest caliber, sophisticated, yet easily accessible.  Throughly enjoyable.<br />Just wanted to enter my vote.
B00683JK9K|3.0|I love puzzle games. PROS: This one has  beautiful images. Several layouts to choose from. Can rotate pieces. Nice music.  Cons: No space to lay your extra pieces...the border fits right up to the edge. Not enough photos. No capability to add your own photos.
B004RZGUBM|1.0|While the book is a great collection to have, the novel portion has no index and therefore the only way to access a new novel is by gong to the last chapter of the previous novel and page to the end, You then can find the beginning of the next novel. It will not allow you to &#34;search&#34; by title as the result is &#34;title not yet indexed&#34;. A huge oversite.
0062238868|1.0|Live by the sword... die by the sword... I believe the bible makes that statement. I'm not religious but it seems like that might be true.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was a very good read.  It kept your attention from cover to cover.  I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a good romance novel.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|i placed my orline online on a friday evening. 1 hour later i get an email from the company saying it was shipped. i just picked up the item today. icant believe i got my item withen 3 days of ordering. the packaging was great to. my item was not broken or damaged in any way.
B004RL9T50|5.0|Megamind has all the ingredients of a superhero movie and more.  There's humor, fear, redemption, community and mystery.  The fight scenes are mostly light and funny making it okay for little ones who can handle some fighting.  There is one scene towards the end that is fairly intense, but other than that the movie is easy and entertaining to watch.
0920668372|5.0|This. Is a wonderful classic story!  I love this story and hopefully my children will as well! Very cute. I highly recommend.
B0071MV540|3.0|Just OK nothing to inspirational here. It was something to do if there is nothing else. I like romance with action
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Need more angry birds because there are times when it seems one more bird will do the trick and some are not effective'
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I loved this movie. I watched it OVER and Over! Perfect chick flick. Rent it with your girlfriends and open several bottles of wine.
0345803493|1.0|\\"Oh,why did I not read the reviews?\\",is the question I continue to ask myself. This was one of biggest time-wasters disguised as a book. that I have purchased in my life. It was too bad that I couldn't ask for my money back.  This story takes the reader on three very boring journeys, with each book worse than the first.  If it is true that a good writer, begins with something that is familiar or with something from their background, I would hope that this author has a more exciting life than what was played out in either of these three books.<br /><br />The dialogue was stilted, inane in some places, the characters were rather vapid and lackluster.  Had this not been a reader club choice, I would not have finished even the first book. There were several times when I wanted to pen a note to the author and suggest that she read some erotica before writing another book that might include sex, sexual themes, or sensuality. And to think, this book may wind up being a movie.<br /><br />I can honestly add, that if women believe they have a need to spice up their sex lives or relationships, this is not the book that will bring a twinkle and warm silly grin as you make it to work the next day.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|What can I say I love the series. So romantic. Can't wait till I see part two. Loved the books and the movies
0440422973|5.0|Loved it!  Good insight on how some neighborhoods co-exist and shows how easy it is to fall into the competition amongst ourselves trap!
B0081L37Z0|4.0|Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill was awesome together. This is a great movie to watch if you want to laugh your bum off.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  It keeps you guessing and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys mysterys. Ready for the sequel.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved season 1 and season 2 was just OK but this season is my fav. Love the cast, love the clothes and the house. I am English by ancestry and I can't get enough of it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is loads of fun. in my opinion it is a lot cooler than the first Temple Run. Lots of cool new stuff.  5*'s 4U!
B009VB97EY|4.0|I really like Channing Tatum. I like Matthew McConaughey but he looked so old in this. Nice story with a moral.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is really very cool and it is very addictive, i highly recommend this app, it is loads of fun
B007PS0X0W|4.0|I have seen them all and enjoy watching the series. I like movies with strong females and vampires are so cool
B006GWO5NE|5.0|THIS CHARGERING PLUG IN WORKS GOOD.  IT IS ALITTLE FASTER THAN THE OLD ONE BUT IT WORKS.  MY OLD ONE WOULD NOT CHARGE.
B000ZM1FXO|1.0|Didn't finish this movie. It was old and disgusting. I loved the series ROME and thought it might be good. I was so wrong!
B005LAIH2W|4.0|I would NOTsay JOHN CARTER was the worst movie of 2012...nor was it the BEST..I enjoyed it enuff to want to see it again
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series, but I did think there were too many people that died in Season 3. Looking forward to season 4!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it is a good game I love playing this but if you don't do something right it will lock up and you cant play it
B00683JK9K|5.0|This app works very well. There may have been earlier problems that have been fixed as I have had no problems. I have the other Magic puzzle app too and they have more free pictures and great deals on puzzle packs. Any problems, they have a Facebook page and they do answer questions posted
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was really pleased with this book.  It was the best book I have read since I got my reader!  Written very well, lots of surprises!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Wonderful and terrible. Simple. Addictive. Irresistable. My entire family wants it for their phones and cannot stop playing!<br />This game is a ton of fun.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This is an album worth it's price.  All songs are the ones you wanted from Kelly. Definitely glad I bought it.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love this show best zombie tv show ever you need to get this you will not be disappointed with it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I couldn't believe how she caught on to this game...you have to remember twists and turns and when to duck and when to jump over something...she would fail and fail and fail but get further and further each time...we had fun laughing when the guy would not make it across a gap in the road or hit a tree...good fun
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loooovvvve this app. it makes me teal like I have a real horse. I like the mini games. I also like the compotitions. This app is ideally awesome!!!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Finishing up the last of the trilogy.  I enjoy the twists in the story.  I started reading the books to watch the recent movie but I have yet to watch the movie.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|I put this Cd in my car about a week ago and I just can't stop playing it. I just sounds fantastic, Eric Burdon at his best. Music well played and produced with a lot of soul and feeling. It could easy be an early 70's Animals CDs or even a 70's Rolling Stones CD. Highly recommended! As good as R&B and Hard rock and roll can get!
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I found Nicholas sparks always knows how t o keep a reader so intense even up to the end! Enjoyed this love story!
0765325950|5.0|As a fantasy reader, The Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan has been my favorite. I have read other series that went for eight to ten years and just fizzled on the last book. This final book is an excellent read and a fitting end to the series. I was saddened at Mr. Jordan's passing but Brandon Sanderson has done a remarkable job of taking a very complex story and finishing it in a very satisfying read. Many thanks to Mrs. Jordan for taking care of the fans!
B007N85ZXY|4.0|I LIKED AND DIDN'T LIKE THIS. SOME OF THE SONGS I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY THEY WERE ARRANGED. I ONLY GOT IT BECAUSE OF NOSTALIGA OF FOLK SONGS
B008602KQI|5.0|Obviously the book is better, but they did a great job with the adaptation. I can't wait for the next movie to come out...
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Despite it's title this is not a disaster movie. After a very thrilling 15 minutes the movie is then a study in alcoholism and drug addiction. It can be very depressing and is much too long. If these topics interest you then so will this movie. If airplane disasters interest you then you will be very disappointed. I really enjoyed the hope and healing at the end of the movie.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is an outstanding history book. Ms. Goodwin had to spend hundreds of hours reasearching this work and putting it into an exciting history read. Bring your lunch, 750 plus pages is a long pull but well worth it. Reading it on Kindle is the only way to go unless your arms need the workout!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome cool graphics better than the 1 one tottally recomend this game awesome  get it its free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game for kids and even grown ups love it. I wouldn't think that grown ups so would like it or even myself
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Read the book after seeing the movie. As usual a good movie came from a great book. Great depth compared to the movie.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have always loved Angry Birds, but the Starwars version is the BEST. It's definitely worth getting the paid version. I am an addict!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Amazing, awesome series! This is a show the whole family can watch.  Thank you for having this series in your video streaming collection.
B007WCJSWA|5.0|How does some one follow up Big Neighborhood? By being himself. Mike Stern is so impressive with how much better he gets as a musician and composer with each album. The playing is top notch with great guests!
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Wonderfully written.  Great descriptions.  One of the better books I've read.  Long book but worth the read.  Highly recommend it.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I was hard pressed to find a nice wired gaming mouse as my previous Logitech M510 was having issues with lag and playing anything was unbearable.  I've heard all the hype surrounding the top mice from top reviews (G9X, G500, Cyborg, Deathadder, Naga), I even had a friend recommending the Razer Naga.  They all sported similiar features ranging from numerous buttons and configurations, macros, dpi switching, weights, fancy lights and designs that were both aesthetic yet functionable.  What they didn't sport was a cheap price and that's what initially attracted me to this mouse.  I was skeptical at first, I've never heard of Anker and they don't really sell gaming peripherals, mostly iphone and ipad accessories.  I was somewhat amazed at all the features that this product boasted and based on reviews of other owners (who are ALL raving about how awesome it is) I had to go for it, and to be honest, it's exactly everything it's advertised to be and it's as great as everyone else says.  I couldn't be anymore pleased with how well it responds, how it feels in my hand, how it looks and more importantly gives me the competitive edge I need for gaming.  I highly recommend this mouse.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|There is never a dull moment in this show, I would rank it up there with HBO's True Blood. Amazing cast of characters.
0385732554|3.0|Not a book for a young child.  It was a page turner, just to see what the world was like.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app but the update needs to come all my freinds have it on thare I-pods and stuff like that
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I love NCIS! I hope the show lives forever. The cast shines, work together as one. The scripts are brilliant.
B00433TO52|5.0|I love this collection. I am going to try to read as many as possible; can't not wait to get to the next play.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My 3 year old and 6 year old loved it. I also enjoyed it too. Would recommend to any one.
B003B02O14|5.0|you can not put this book down once you start reading.  For me the ending was so ironic and sad.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I fell so in love with this book- I could not put it down! I can not wait to get the next book
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It is amazing who Grisham can weave a story and make it so real.  It is also amazing who he thinks of so many details along the way.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|you didn't know that the real Michael Oher hadn't ripped the movie for inaccurately portraying some important things. I don't know enough about him to know why they portrayed him with low IQ when he graduated with honors from college. He claims he already knew how to play football when he got to the school, so maybe the whole thing in the movie about teaching him what to do was dramatic license. I don't know, but it was a great movie, nonetheless!
B003B02O0A|4.0|Grisham is a great story teller and it is hard to put the book down.  you are not sure how the story is going to end
B0095VP8D4|4.0|I love using these on my normal system builds. They give a solid value in performance and cost.<br /><br />They are in no way as fast as the Intel in raw numbers, but  for most people who aren't going to be playing a lot of games or doing heavy video or image work, they are very fast.
B004I9G486|1.0|Once i got it, i tried it on my 2012 Audi A6 AMI and it only chrges my iphone but doesn't output any audio !!
B000N90JGI|5.0|I have always loved this movie.  I purchased through Instant Video and as of right now, have not had any problems viewing the movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a fantastic read. Not only is the subject matter interesting, intriguing in fact, but the writing is perhaps the best quality writing I've read in a considerable amount of time. I'm not just talking about using proper grammar here. I'm talking about the ART of writing, something too many authors have forgotten, never knew, or have abandoned altogether. Howey has a way of constructing thoughts and painting pictures that is simply enjoyable to read. This is a high quality read for far too low a price in my opinion (not that I'm complaining) and I am very much looking forward to his next offering.
B00AECDDYY|4.0|Love the strategy,  but I was hoping for some rpg with it. I was reminiscing of the old iigs pirates game
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Jolly good entertainment. And a sexy Dr Watson? Brilliant! Hope this one stays on for many seasons. Rocnrev Mike San Luis Obispo
B005HSG3U6|3.0|It is okay.  I expected the back cover (black part) to be more heavy duty.  Also, it does not stay in place very well. The front cover is very nice.  If dropped, it will protect the Kindle.<br /><br />However, I would not purchase another one.  it was not worth the cost.
B000641D2Y|4.0|There is nothing like New York at Christmas time. It doesn't feel like Christmas until I see this movie and the first one.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Just like the 50 Shades story, there's a lot of heat generated in this story. Add to that a solid plotline and you've got a great combination - a real pageturner.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have a love/hate relationship with this show. I can never say who my favorite characters are though, because they’ll end up dyeing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game was fun, kept me occupied for about a good hour<br />I really liked it and am going to continue to play it for a long time!! =)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow, what an intense second book. Mind blowing passion throughout. My heart ached for the couple during the down part of their roller coaster ride. Not looking forward to waiting for book three to be released.
1451673442|5.0|Awesome book, Awesome Movie.  Positivity Reinforced.  Law of attraction conceptualized, visualized and experimentalized on real life situations.  Secret to hapiness revealed.  Pick it up today.  easy read.
B00846REIS|5.0|I've caught the Gideon/Eva bug. They have such great magnetic pull on each other, it's hard to put the book down. What vividly painted love scenes the author has given us. If you've read Fifty Shades of Gray then this is sure to hook you too.
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|Quite playable with the built in joystick. A little frustrating using the gyro so I am glad the dev gave the option. Very nice change from the normal shoot or get shot games.
B004FCEFUK|5.0|Anytime I see a rock or metal grand opus that's about over 18 minutes I begin to salivate at the mouth. I know that in almost all cases (post-Kevin Moore Dream Theater doesn't count) the band has worked extremely hard in putting together something truly memorable and interesting. Not since Theocracy: Mirror of Souls have I been so impressed by a band. It's an amazing space-opus worthy of the same praise Ayreon gets. It's going to take a 50 listens to truly appreciate this song. It's a story about people leaving earth on a space ship going to a new earth. Only problem is, the ship gets knocked off course and some incredible things start to happen on the ship. I won't spoil the story but it's a great tale about human nature.<br /><br />(Btw: There is a female guest singer on this track and Longway Home too.)<br /><br />I've never heard Tommy sing better than on that song. His entire range is used from falsettos to Geoff Tate style emotional singing. There is this one part towards the end of the song when he belts out the lyrics in a way that I had no idea he could. Absolutely stunning and I have to say that I believe he's got some of the best vocal chords in this style of prog-power metal. It's no wonder Kamelot chose him as a replacement for Roy Khan.<br /><br />The guitar work is extremely well done, from the perfect mood setting warm tones of the acoustic guitar - out of this world literally - to the crunchy rhythm sections and super soft and emotional solos and that were expertly planned out. No filler rhythm sections here.<br /><br />All the synth sounds were excellently chosen and the keys really help elevate the song's melodies. I really love the string sections here. They are not perfect but they are damn good. There are plenty of great weird choices too for some sections that perfectly fit the space story.<br /><br />The bass is hard and full - It helps support the piece and there is even a few cool solo sections.<br /><br />The drums do the job - honestly I'm the best guy to be reviewing the drums (which in this day in age are 70% mostly fake a lot of the time) but everything sounds great to me here.<br /><br />The only ONLY ONLY bone I have to pick with Seventh wonder is I really wish they repeated a portion the beginning lyrics of the song and put them at the end. ---5.0 out of 5.0<br /><br /> That song alone is worth the full price of the album. But luckily for you, you've got several other amazing songs to listen to.<br /><br />1. Wiseman --- 2. Alley Cat: are both pretty similar. They are great songs that throw hook after hook at you. It's hard not to get hooked. Great short prog-metal hits. - 4.8 out of 5.0<br /><br />3. Angelmaker: Honestly, if the Great Escape was not on this album I'd say this song was my favorite. And at 8 minutes there is so much variety it's hard not to love this song. My favorite part is towards the end of the song. Extremely strong finish and very creative. - 4.9999 out of 5.0<br /><br />4. King of Whitewater: Another amazing 7 minute long song. Great melodies here. Not my favorite but could be a month from now - 4.6 out of 5.0<br /><br />5. Long Way Home: Okay, some people may hate this song but honestly it's the easiest song to get into on the album next to Alley Cat. It's a great and proven song formula that sure to give you chills a few times at the end. And at 4:32, Im not complaining. I listen to this song when I come back home to my gf after work if I'm late and she's mad at me (which happens a lot haha) listen to the song to find out why. Great song, shortest song on the album and i'd easily give that song a 4.7 out of 5.0<br /><br />6. Move ON Through: It's a song about how much music helps people and it gives you examples of people getting through the day because they have music. You'd think a song about this would be boring but it isn't. It's actually really well written and when I listen to this song I can see \\" rich girl in a private jet Holds on to the part cause her futureis already set\\" - the song is in the same formula as Alley Cat with some twists and turns here and there. Great song, I love it. 4.8 out of 5.0<br /><br />In order to truly appreciate Seventh's Wonder: The Great Escape, you need to purchase the CD and leave it in the CD player of your car for awhile. Don't listen to the stooges who are angry Seventh Wonder didn't split up the last song. Save the song for a drive on special trip like I do. I'm a commuter in NJ so it's always great to have a 30 minute long song help pass the time.<br /><br />***Seventh Wonder, I just wanted to tell you guys that I really enjoyed the underlaying vocals behind the main vocals. It's great! It's taking a lot of listens just to fully digest those with the lead vocals. The amount of background vocals you guys did for the album and particurally the title track is unbelievable.

B0099Y2MYK|1.0|I absolutely love Downton Abbey. I pre-ordered this DVD believing that it truly is the original UK version. I am sad to say that this is an edited version! If you watch the episode on pbs.org and then watch the episode on the DVD you will find that there are scenes left out. Thirty seconds here, thirty seconds there. The advertising is incorrect. I am very dissappointed.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Martin had me from start to finish and left me begging for more at the end. This guy cannot write books fast enough for me. The rich detail in Martin's books is a hearty feast for the mind.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Ernest Cline's novel will appeal to gamers, 80's lovers and pop-culture geeks alike. Finished this book in a week, couldn't put it down!
B001H1SVO8|5.0|What a wild ride---a definite thriller---very dark comedy---Pitt and Norton are superb in this movie. Watched it with my wife--she couldn't watch it---made it halfway thru----probably a guy flick---a wild, wild ride of a movie. Couldn't believe Meatloaf was in it----thought he did a god job!!
0316069434|4.0|In the beginning, I nearly gave up on this book because I'm not crazy about a gang storyline. I stuck with it because I love<br />Bosch. Connelly finally hooked me once the story got heavily into the investigation of a cold-case crime Bosch was involved<br />in back in the nineties. Excellent as usual, plot twists in every chapter.<br />Overall, a super suspense read!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I like almost all of the Lee Child books that I have read.  And, this was a very good one
B00969GFFU|1.0|I could not connect to one character in this story.  I did not care one wit about these privileged peoples' problems.  I found the whole premise of this story so juvenile.  The catalyst for everyone's angst, depression, competition and acting out is based off of some foolishness that happened or didn't happen between Patti, Walter and Richard in college.  Really?!?  I just felt like telling these people to man-up and get some real problems.  Every single one of these people is their own worst enemy.<br /><br />The time I spent reading this was a complete waste of my time.  I like books that change me in some positive way or get me to think about things differently.  This book just exasperated me.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I did not read this book.  After I saw how the first one started I decided not to continue reading this series
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app! I have it on my iPhone and on my android tablet! Its so much fun! I also have \\"Temple Run\\"! This is a fun game almost for any age, my kid is 4 and she plays it constantly!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Got this on sale, and it's such a cute, fun movie. I love everything about it! Recommend it for adults & kids.
B008B92U32|1.0|I have a Samsung galaxy tab2, and after downloading I couldn't even get to the play with pictures part. It would ask me to pick a picture or take one, but either way I tried would just bring me right back to the same screen again. I gave up and uninstalled it. Too bad, looked fun.
B008602KQI|5.0|I love The Hunger Games.. I went and saw it when it first came out and I couldnt wait to get it on DVD. Just watched it again and yep, still love it!
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|It could've been better. I think they may have been resting on the laurels of the &#34;Alien&#34; legacy. I had to go on wikipedia to track down what was being implied through part of the movie. It's a good movie for the Alien die-hards, otherwise not-so-good.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Hopeless kept my interest from the beginning to the end.  Very well written.  I definitely recommend; a good, easy read.
B005LAIHPE|1.0|I tried. But even with Alexander Skaarsgard, I still don't know what the plot was, the point of it. Just some people bipping around in the water. No clue.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I think that when a guy who rides on a jetpack<br />Avoiding missiles in stuff.<br />Is pretty creative.<br />Who's with me?
B000OY8NII|5.0|After watching this series, you will be quoting particle physics principles with the best of them. The characters are awesome, the plots are new. Definitely new. Saw an episode in a hotel on a business trip. Had to buy it. The sheriff is &#34;everyman&#34; in a town full of &#34;non-everymens & women&#34;. Oh, and the christmas episodes....awesome.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great idea. I think that it's my favourite app.<br />Also temple run 2 is a fun game too.<br />It's challenging and fun.<br />Who's with me?
B005LAII0I|5.0|Ever want to hate Julia Roberts? This is the movie for it. Even though, this is a highly entertaining movie. Worth it to see the &#34;puppy love&#34; scenes.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I felt this cinematic version of Judge Dredd did a much better job of capturing the spirit of the 2000AD comic than the 1995 Stallone movie. Highly recommended if you like your sci-fi action neat, without the excessive kitsch and bloatedness that ruined the first movie.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|If only snow white wasn't in it; it could be a great movie. The dialogue between the huntsman & the character definition of the queen are fascinating, bringing a new take on an old classic. However, I still am fast forwarding any of the dialogue of snow white. If only she could have a facial expression that didn't look constipated, that would save it. I'm glad I didn't spend the $ to see in a theatre.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|Excellent movie. Denzel Washington plays the great and tragic anti hero. Worth watching and discussing this movie with friends. Highly recommended.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game. Reminds me of the old school games. Would let my kids play this. Lots of family fun
B007ADIRDM|3.0|I have 9 grandchildren, 6 who are girls ages 4 to 19.  The girls love the dolls and I like the concept.  I even spend time searching and researching the dolls and their stories and I fell for 'it.' (those who know me know that this is not my style).  My favorite is Rebecca Steam.  The dolls are delicate so I just remind the girls to be careful and to take good care of them. I created staging areas in thier rooms for the dolls to go so they don't strewn around.  Like the American Girl doll, each doll has a story to tell.  Unlike the American Girl doll, monster high dolls' histories have no redeeming value.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|The basic story was good and well written,, except that Lee Child uses too many  details and goes off point to do so.  This tends to confuse the reader, and make the reader forget what they were reading prior to the added detail.  No one cares about what Reacher knows, knew or what he did in the past or why or how, etc.  This book was ruined because of it.  Lee, has not your teacher told you that less is more?  Even an aspiring writer like me knows that!
B00APUQH0W|3.0|Certainly not his best work, but also certainly Clint being Clint, which is what he does best.  You know where the movie is headed, but the ride is pleasant, if gruff, and you care about the characters.  It's worth a couple of hours in your recliner.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|I might be biased here but this is another MN. Connelley book and I alove all his writings.  These were short stories and all were well written but too shoirt.  Left you hanging wanting more.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Fantastic concert, as noted by others though the finale is worth the purchase alone.  The BluRay production is tremendous and made it better than the 10 year concert.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|been using this case for over an year. It survived atleast 20 drops. No damages to the phone and this is a really great protective case.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it in a movie theater, and enjoyed it just as much at home in 3D. The 3D wasn't particularly impressive, but the with the high definition graphics and some depth in the graphics, it was fun to watch again.
0783225725|4.0|My husband really likes it.  I personally, dislike all of Eastwood's &#34;spaghetti westerns&#34;, and this was very little different, only with a ghost story thrown in.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I was looking for something light and adventerous.  This fit the bill.  Some of it was a bit predictable, but enjoyable all the same.  Nice method of weaving a story with old and new.  I recommend this if you're looking for something entertaining.  It will not disappoint!
B009A87ZKG|5.0|What is not to like regarding Patton in blu-ray.  Fantastic movie and now in a far superior format than DVDs.
B009LROCJI|1.0|Monteverdi recomposed a mass by Gombert. Bach recomposed Vivaldi long ago. Handel recomposed everything he could get his hands on. Veracini recomposed Corelli. Mozart recomposed Handel. Sch&ouml;nberg recomposed Mahler. The list goes on of both successful and unsuccessful \\"re-compositions\\" of already brilliant music. Painters do it also; my favorite canvases by Miro are his re-paintings of Vermeer, and van Gogh repainted Millet.. So I'm not opposed to the effort, and I don't \\"require\\" that the new work be superior to the model. Not at all! In fact, that's seldom the case. Veracini reworked Corelli precisely because Corelli was sublime; Miro repainted Vermeer because Vermeer made Miro look better. What I do require is that the new work be good enough, on its own terms, not to embarrass the old. I want new insight or new energy from the re-composition, else why should I bother with it?<br /><br />I get no new insight from these clunky travesties by Max Richter. And energy? Strobe-lit auditorium thumpa-thumpa energy. Certainly not a wart on the energy of Arvo P&auml;rt or Philip Glass or Erkki Swen-T&uuml;&uuml;r. An arbitrary faux-minimalism churned into a froth of not-very-skillful fiddling. Make that fiddle-faddling! As the ever-caustic reviewer from Santa Fe has already declared: this is a one-listen CD. Save your money.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its fun, and oh so addictive!!! I play it every chance I get. I think I play more than my children...lol
B009UX2YAC|1.0|please for my sake dont't get this app.  I had over 75000 coins. I had 10 characters 3 were limited editon 95000 coins a pop. please I cried for days!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Outstanding!!! 100% recomendable. May be blu ray's menu could be better, but it doesn't affect the quality of the product. All 3 movies looks  great.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|An alarm clock shouldn't be that big of a deal and yet I've come to rely on my alarm clock app on my phone.  I just got my Kindle Fire HD and went looking for a suitable alarm clock app.  I picked the first one I found figuring they're all alike and then realized it was not the one for me because of its annoying ads so I promptly deleted it.  Then I found this one and I just love it.  It makes me realize that a good alarm clock app isn't that easy to find and this is one of the Best I've found so far.Now I have to see if this one is available for my phone too.  If it is, I'll promptly delete the other one I've been using and add this one.<br />Good app.  Thank you.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|We've watched it many times already.  My daughter and her friends (15 years old) love it.  It's a very funny, entertaining movie.  Some adult humor, but not raunchy.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was a great...what if book. I flew through it and will slow down the second time. It was recommended by a friend and I will certainly pass it on to others. Better not wish for something, it just might come true and not have the results you wanted!!!
B004JOCU2O|5.0|love the real life suspense drama. i actually operated a train on that very line when working for Conrail. Love the movies done w minimal CG and filmed on locations.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Tried twice to install this on my Kindle fire. Couldn't get it to work. Maybe I am doing something wrong?
B001EBV0P8|5.0|I love the real justice, and all the time and patience it takes to survive thru the trials and tribulations. Biblically, God rewards patient endurance, and this gives the greatest satisfaction of conquering your circumstances and beating back the Bully. This is one of my top-10 of all time..
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Good puzzles that aren't too easy or too hard.  So far I've enjoyed both G5 games I've played, so I'm looking forward to more.
B002W7P5UE|5.0|EMSaint is so demur and sensual. Cary's best movie. Great Hitch suspense and lots of on location camera covering NY to So Dakota's Faces... great escape from scary bad guys stuff that keeps you on the edge until the very end... one of my fav movies of all time..
B002ZG99G8|5.0|...is absolutely ridiculous, but I think that's a large part of why I enjoyed it! :D<br /><br />The dialogue, especially, is very snappy; one witty, smartass line after another. (Even the Evil Henchman got smartass lines, and that made me gleeful, and - perhaps oddly - rather sympathetic to his character.)<br /><br />If you want a takes-itself-seriously movie, this is REALLY not for you. If you want a good time and lots of laughs? It's very worth it!<br /><br />(My one complaint is that the English subtitles miss some of the dialogue in places. It's never more than a word, maybe two, at a time, and not super common, but if that's a potential issue, now you know.)
B002RSOTSM|5.0|toss up between N by NW and RW, but I think this may be the one that proved he really had the EdgeOfYOurSeat perfected. Grace Kelly is stunning. could never get enough of her.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME IS THE BOMB I AM TRYING TO COLECT ALL OF THE CHARACTERS IF YOU DONT HAVE SUBWAY SURFERS GET ITS THE BEST GAME EVER
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Addicting...can be tedious trying to earn enough coins to unlock boards and characters.  Otherwise it is pretty entertaining android game.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I love it it's so much fun . Some stuff can be challenging but that makes me want to play it more!!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I fell in love with the first one and I'm loving the enhanced graphics and new tricks for this version. Really,  how can you *not* love this game?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is the best game so far..you will be addicted to this game..I don't want to stop playing...so download this game and have fun! Oh and it's not easy so put your game face on..
B0013D6LEM|5.0|A must have if you're a real Micheal Jackson fan... I had the original album when I was a kid. I'm definitely pleased with this purchase (:
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I absolutely love it. This is a necessity for me. Without a dictionary, there will be less communication. Let's get real... no dictionary=no communication=no friends...
1616550414|5.0|I very rarely write reviews, but honestly I just want to contribute to the rating here on Amazon because this beautiful creation deserves all the praise it can get! (Also, perhaps I just want to put my mark in the history of reviews.)<br /><br />Anyhow ... this historia is exceptionally well done. Just top-notch quality. And while I haven't read much of it, I flipped through the pages and there is a dazzling amount of content, insight, and gorgeous, wonderful art. I really feel like this is a timeless, mystic book of legends. If you are a fan of The Legend of Zelda, get this book, and get it now. Before the price rises and before production inevitably ends. It's a true gem, and a real work of art chronicling the greatest and most riveting game series of all time. I know I'll hold on to it my whole life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Cool game really like the world tour update love to work for you someday. Keep it up you dudes. Great game well done.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|It does work pretty well on round bottles but I did find<br />that very thick glass just won't break clean.<br />My only problem with the product is the cutter its self-<br />because its set up where you can rotate the blades as<br />they become dull you can't tell which ones you've used<br />or not. Also where do you buy replacement blades?<br />Julie
0525953728|5.0|When all Americans were clamoring for details over the killing of Osama bin Laden, Matt Bissonnette using the pseudonym of Mark Owen in 2012 published the book “No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission that Killed Osama bin Laden.”  Release of the book a year after the raid caused a bit of controversy because the content was not cleared first with the Department of Defense which claimed the book contained classified information.  I, like many other Americans, pounced on the book and was fascinated by what I read.<br /><br />In the first half of the book, Owens tells of being raised in Alaska, operations in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Navy Seal, and his involvement in the 2009 rescue of the Maersk Alabama ship and crew hijacked by the Somali pirates. In the second half, Owens gives a detailed account of the raid that killed bin Laden. “No Easy Day” offers a clear, concise portrait of what makes up a Navy Seal, how they function on missions, and the sacrifices they make. I thoroughly enjoyed this personal and moving account of a day that shaped American history.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|The graphics are nice, and there isn't a lot of storyline wasted (that is, you don't have to sift through a lot of character interaction/dialogue to understand what's going on; the plot is unraveled during the challenges/mini-games).  good mix of mini-game types, though none really too challenging. i also liked the prequel option in the extras; that was a nice touch and opens the storyline up even more to allow for further development of related games.<br /><br />overall I like the plot, was pleased with the setup, and would very likely play a sequel.
B008VMTZ3W|4.0|I could have gone with Killer Klassic but I chose not to. You're welcome. I'm not sure this is an apt comparison but I like to think of the Killers as our Coldplay. In a good way. The comparison seems stronger on the album more so than the usual u2 comparisons. This is a more personal record and the songs seem stronger for it. It's a solid album start to finish but standouts for me were &#34;Runaways&#34; and &#34;Flesh and Bone&#34;. Vinyl buyers should also appreciate the solid packaging, with a photo book and an honest-to-god poster.
0761536434|5.0|Steve took the time to be extremely thorough. He starts from the very beginning of games back in the 19th century to the modern area of video game console up to 2001.<br /><br />I have had the chance to speak with Steve on this book. He had told me that he did not like the title of this book, but the publisher forced him to use this title for marketing. His intention was not to be an ultimate book, but to keystone the major turning points of video game eras.<br /><br />The book is ideal if you want to understand the background of how video games have evolved.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I had this game on a fruit device and throughly enjoyed the free arcade action. Game Circus makes some great games that dont cost you a dime to enjoy. You can trade in prize lines for extra coins and the new shake feature is just a great addition.  The graphics are smooth and top notch. The random prize coins are a welcome when coins are running low. Just leave the app open to collect coins quicker! You cant lose by downloading this jersey shore fun machine. and when you run out of coins, just go download Paplinko from Game Circus and enjoy some digitial pachinko in the amazon app store, which we all know has the great free app of the day! Its a win win. Ichiban!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I received this item as a gift to get use out of one of my old Apple MagSafe charger. I had the MacBook Pro 15\\" Retina, and new new thin plug for the MagSafe needs this adapter to convert older MagSafe chargers from my 2008 MacBook Pro 15\\".<br /><br />I considered this as a much cheeper option than buying a brand new MagSafe charger. This allows you to have one setup, say at home and a work or a travel one always ready to go. That way you do not have to wrap one up. It helps efficiency of time and space.<br /><br />As a final note, my old charger is a 60W compared to the newer one being 85W of the MagSafe 2. The lower wattage does work, just a slower charger on my Retina Mac. Lower wattage is gentle to your battery, which can allow it to maintain larger duration of use. Larger wattage is for times you need to charge fast to be ready on the go.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really do love this app its awesome but on the other hand its not the same, what I mean is that the computer version is more adavnced and has more types of blocks I got survival craft the other day and it is like the computer version of minecraft in. a way more stuff more animals etc. unlike this also this is really slow when it comes to updates almost everyone in my school plays minecraft and they have the update when I don't and I cant even join their world anymore because its a &quot;outadated client&quot; I actually had to get it on my ipod just so I could get the update,  please fix that. next it lags a lot and If I ever do join worlds the app crashes and I have to start over,  or it just wont let me click on the world at all. finally they lie about updates, I read earlier that we were gonna get buckets and even dogs on the new update but they never got them then they said they would fix the bug on the joining of the servers but that's a lie too. well that's that the game is awesome and all but you NEED to fix these then you can get 5 stars from me.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Can u get better than Temple Run??? I see that is possible I loved the first one and this one is that much better love love love this game.
0062082353|2.0|This must be a good read for those,  who want to understand better the special force soldier psychology - the poor,  one-sided view of the world that comes with it, lack of any ethical doubts, lack of any respect for another country,  it's people,  culture,  religion,  human life, etc. It gave a perspective to me why fighting wars - even seemingly justified ones,  is bad,  and why America must be hated in Iraq, even if the ultimate purpose must have been a reasonable one. As a read,  it lives up to the low expectations - it would be a surprise if a guy with standards as they are described, would have written something much stronger.
B004YOEFG8|5.0|Very good 3d Film. Makes you appreciate this place we call home. Did it make itself ?? I don't think so.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Penny in the Age of Conan episode makes this season worth the price of admission alone.  The rest of the cast is great as well. I must have watched this season 20 times already.
B001C4CI8U|4.0|I thought I ordered a &#34;like new&#34; product (I may have been in error), but the delivered product was a bit tattered - However, the DVD quality was fine.  It also arrived a couple weeks after the accompanying Second Season - however, I'm still happy and safisfied with the purchase.

B00110K62U|5.0|Excellent!  We had a CD of the soundtrack, but being able to see the production is just wonderful.  It's  a good production, and very enjoyable.  Next best thing to &#34;being there&#34;.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|I really like this game. wish there were more opportunities to win acorns. I just refuse to spend real money on a game. I guess they are string to make money, but still.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie is hilariously funny but not in a disgusting way. Good comedy for the whole family. Great movie for all ages. A must see
B00170I7GG|5.0|Whenever I see this movie it reminds me what it means to have what we have right now.  It allows me to pause and reflect on those little things we take for granted and dismiss as a waste of time -- getting to know someone in depth, patiently learning a new skill, doing things for others that you may not necessarily want to do at first, discovering a part of yourself you never thought existed, pause to enjoy the present moment, etc.  Bill Murray is brilliant in his role as Phil as well as the rest of the cast.  The story offers a lot of lessons for all ages and the characters are richly executed.  Skillfully directed and very memorable!
B009NPKTN6|4.0|Although this movie is a bit corny, the best thing is that the music was sung by the star studded cast. It's sure to become a cult classic in the years to come.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I love every song on this thing! Got it preorder so it showed up very soon and is one of my favorite cds still!
B004TI5N38|5.0|Best book ever written.  A must read for all Baldacci lovers.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat.

B008AK8FHM|2.0|Too much theory.  Noone really knows about the hearafter and what's religion is really right. I am a Catholic , but after the Church's disgraceful handling of the pedifile priest's scandal.  I don't even go to church often.  I realize this is getting away from the review.  I guess my bitterness just comes out.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Merida, the protagonist of \\"Brave,\\" may be the spunkiest Disney heroine yet! My favorite line occurs after her suitors vie for her hand in an archery match. Merida leaves her throne, steps into the arena, and shouts, \\"I am Merida, and I'm shooting for my own hand!\\"
B002BGCCZC|5.0|Just saw these guys live in Seattle and it was earth shatteringly epic. They are absurdly good, and this album contains some of their best hits. Buy it and listen to it voraciously. Because you're worth it.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I wasn't disappointed in this movie, as I often am when I see a movie based on a novel. There were a few minor changes and some characters left out. But, overall, I enjoyed it.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|this album would have been perfect if the songs were more varied. I listend the first time on a long drive and by the time it ended i was over it. Not the trip the repetiveness of the songs all sounding alike. 1 and 2 are the best tracks.
1610390938|5.0|This book is about people that spend less than what you can buy for 99 cents per person per day in the USA. In 2005, 865 million people actually did, most of them in Asia, Africa and Latin America.<br /> The message of the book is that in all countries extreme poverty can be reduced much faster and more effective than is happening to day. A lot of effort and money is wasted because the causes of the poverty are not understood leading to wrong policies and right policies that are poorly executed (often lack of follow up). The positive message is that significant progress can be made with without radical changes of institutions, corruption, or enormous subsidies.<br /> Finding ways to lead poor people out of their poverty traps is far from easy. You have to understand how they make decisions, and if they make the wrong decisions what method is effective leading to correct decisions. That is not easy either. Understanding is not a question of only questions and answers and verbal persuasion.  The authors describe many examples like the problem of state paid teachers in poor villages in India that were often absent.  The book describes a wide range of common problems l reducing hunger, insurance for healthcare and drought, poor teacher performance, family planning, ethnicity problems, the merits of entrepreneurship of the poor and additional action required for more \\"good\\" jobs, that is with a fixed stable income over time, the significant merits and limitations of microcredit, the need additional credit possibilities, saving money without risk and reasonable returns. I was surprised to learn that many of these very poor save money, lend and borrow from each other, and why it is so difficult to replace moneylenders.<br /> The two authors are Professors at MIT and use a scientific method making experiments that prove if a method works or not, (RCT) Randomized Controlled Trials. That means that they compare the performance of groups that are exposed to different methods, and analyzing the results. It is fascinating to read about these tests and how excellent solutions were discovered.<br /> These two academics point out that they have radical different views from other well known academics in this field notably, Jeffrey Sachs, Darin Acemoglu and James Robinson, and Paul Collier. These academics present Big Ideas like radically changing the institutions, even by force, or doing no more than promoting freedom. These generalizations can lead to doing nothing or wasted effort and funds. To be successful you have to investigate causes, test solutions and monitor implementation.<br /> Some leaders of government like Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva Brazil and Deng Xiaoping of China and Manmohan Singh from India, have introduced policies and programs that have significantly reduced poverty. However these countries still face serious poverty problems. Many of the projects described are from these countries<br /> I have been amazed about how much can be done with simple measures in what look like hopeless situations. Just one example. Corruption is a huge problem. In Kenya the government paid for schools, teaching material and teachers but there was some doubt about how much actually reached the schools. An audit was made that found that only 13% of the funds the government sent to the schools actually arrived at the schools. These results were widely published in the newspapers. Soon thereafter the percentage became 70%. This is one of several examples how corruption can be reduced from the bottom up, rather from the top down, that is policy change leading to political change. Other similar examples are described. Improvements can and should be made top down and bottom up in politics and policies. For me a brilliant idea.and analyzing the results.

B004XCUEU2|5.0|Being a huge Foo Fighters fan this DVD was automatically AWESOME!!! Even if i wasn't a fan it would still be a killer DVD!  My sister in law didn't really listen to them before she watched this with us and now she's a Foo fan!
B009O2XY12|4.0|I thought the game would be a little more challenging. It's designed for little kids rather than adults. I would recommend it for only smaller kids

B008HK3XU4|5.0|I have neck, back, and shoulder problems, so that holding a book to read is sometimes a pain.  I installed the Kindle Fire HD, which was very easy to do, and set the standing case on my lap or a side table, so it is easy to see and reach.  I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I first saw these when my first granddaughter was born but never purchased.  I bought one for my grandson and it is great.  He loves to hold the animal and it helps to keep track of his pacifier.  There are no loose or small pieces on the animal to worry about.  Great idea.
B000069HZP|5.0|I bought the DVD because I thought highly of Michael Douglas' acting skills, and was happily surprised.  This mystery/thriller has twists and turns you never expect, all with a happy ending.  Very nicely done, and I'll watch it over and over.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's very refreshing when a clean, classy, and well written/acted show airs.  With all the trash on TV, Downton is a breath of fresh air.  The acting superb, storyline very well done, costuming unprecedented, and nothing racy or inappropriate is ever shown in great detail.  A series for the times, that you can watch over and over again.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|Succeeding is not by IQ alone, Paul argued that ,It is by the extra effort that is in built in us (what do you want to achieve), what drives you? what burning desire is motivating you?<br /><br />He also suggested that poverty of poor intellect from poor parent also negatively affect children, as the saying goes &#34; you can not give what you don't have&#34; richness and rich experience is essential for successful growth of children. And making children also succeed requires constant L&C licking and cuddling (lab rats experiment). experience that the youngster goes through is also very vital (let them experience it themselves), there is no greater teacher than experience.<br /><br />Finally, Grit, self control, Social intelligence, zest, optimism, curiosity  and gratitude are all very very important tools to make a successful life.<br /><br />It is a good book, I recommend it, please take time to read the book it will do you a world of difference.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|A galloping, entertaining read.  Not to be taken too seriously but well written and great fun.  Take on your next holiday.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Ultraviolent ones, that is. But I do love futuristic dystopias so Dredd was right up my alley. The special effects, the acting, the plot-- it's all superb. I especially loved Anderson's character. She was strong, kicked ass, and never had a moment of weakness that other movies may have included just because she's a woman. Dredd couldn't have done it without her, and I love that.
B000BNI99K|5.0|I heard one of these albums at a friends. Came right home & ordered  this collection. I usually find it tiresome to listen to an album of 1 artist even if I love them.  But I find that I don't grow at all weary listening to Stewart's voice.<br />He does a TERRIFIC job with all these wonderful old tunes & never becomes tiresome. I am an older person & know all these tunes, but I believe anyone who appreciates lovely easy listening music from the past would definitely enjoy  these albums.  They're GREAT!  Get them!
B000V7J82S|5.0|This item came when expected and was exactly as described. Im very please with the purchase and my daughter absolutely loves it!

B0013527I4|5.0|When can we expect season 4????  These are great to see again.  Quality is top rate and so funny!!  What wonderfully talented group of performers.  Bring on the next season!
B00683JK9K|1.0|This app requires Adobe Air, which isn't mentioned in the permissions.  Since Air permits sticky broadcasts, I won't install it, which means I can't use this app.  Air has a security disclaimer, but, why would I trust that?

B007IPJMCM|5.0|I've had the good fortune of seeing these guys twice in Buffalo n.y & also had the great fortune of meeting Vinnie Paul & the late great Dimebag. The power coming off the stage was HUGE! This cd manages to capture the power & intensity of this band which is no easy feet. All tracks here stand out no filler anywhere. Even the bonus track Piss is great which is rare, most times you can tell why a band left a track off an album. Not here! From the brutality of Mouth For War & Walk it never let's up. Great tone & musicianship through out. This is a definate for any collection! PLAY IT LOUD!
1451695187|4.0|Very interesting. Some medical terms I did not know, but most I did. It was easy to read and kept my interest to read it all the way through.
0553212419|5.0|the item has arrived far before the scheduled date and it's in good state, as advertised. very satisfied. for a very reasonable price
B005LAII12|1.0|Watching the movie Ted was a waste of my time.  I do not know how people come up with these ideas.  A pot-smoking teddy bear, who can speak, are we sure the director wasn't high when he came up with the script for this movie?  I still cannot get over the fact that this is a movie about a pot smoking teddy bear.  This bear does not want to grow up in life and he does not want his best friend to either.  Then you have two obsessed people (Father and son) who are trying to kidnap this bear because he is \\"magical.\\"  This movie was very odd and different.  I feel like this movie is dehumanizing towards women.  Granted, this bear is only in Mark's life because he didn't have any friends, and Ted was his best friend, people are going to make connections and support networks throughout their lives.  It still was a terrible movie.  My opinion could be biased towards people.  I watched this with my boyfriend; he could not stop laughing throughout the entire movie.  Maybe I just couldn't understand the humor?  I'm not sure, but I do not suggest this movie to anyone.  You would be better off going for a run.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|I listened the music before watching the movie and I already loved the combination that Tarantino offers on this ost...Morricone, Bacalov, Ortelani and hip hop sounds perfect together. And after watching the movie, I think is one of the best ost of Tarantino´s movies. Great.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Not very original and not very developed...but very predictable.  Don't think I will risk buying the next book in series.
B00AJLHUWQ|4.0|What an incredible album Riverside released...is what Opeth did with Heritage, a different but a huge step, that probably will divide their fans. The sound is great, amazing work on the bass lines and musically has everything. Ambient, melodies, power and that 70 taste....a must for the prog fans and be prepared with this band, they´re growing a lot.
0765325950|5.0|not what the way I thought it would end but it was a great ending.  fir it was not the end but it was an ending
B008L1DNGI|4.0|I do like playing this game.  My only complaint is it doesn't save the game in progress so you end up starting it all over again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the large key pad, all of the functions. I can use this during our homeschool sessions, then with the household bills, very easy to use for all our family members.
0765325950|4.0|A Memory of Light has been the best book in the WOT series since A Lord of Chaos and it might have got five stars if it wasn't for the memory of the slog one had to go through to get to the end. Brandon Sanderson needs to be commended for being able to finish the longest series in fantasy history from RJ's notes. If it hadn't been for the drawn out plots in books 7 - 11 which had to be wrapped up properly in 12 and 13 before the final novel, I might consider it to be the greatest fantasy series.<br /><br />There were many deaths of minor characters in the novel as one would expect in a novel about The Last Battle, but only one real major POV character. If this had been GRRM it might have only been a single major POV character who survived. There are many people who would be sad that Egwene was the character who died, but to sound a little morose I was pleased. Egwene has been one of those characters who constantly made me put the previous novels and walk away. I suppose there will always be characters who will get under my skin because if I had been in control of Lost, the self-righteous character of Jack would not have survived the first season.<br /><br />There are some questions raised in the series which are not answered. But that's how RJ wanted things to end and it was perhaps best that they weren't answered and will now never be.<br /><br />My biggest gripe with the novel is that Rand didn't actually die at the end of the Last Battle. It's become a little bit of cliche in fantasy that the prophecy which says that the great hero meant to die at the last battle doesn't (just look at Harry Potter). I think it might have been a good little twist that the prophecy ended up being right and the great hero sacrifices himself for the rest of the world.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The series gets better as the writers provide enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat while staying true to the period and the characters. Love it!
B000IDEORY|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie until now and loved it. Now I know what everyone is talking about when they reference it.
B0064NTZ6W|5.0|As a cold war submariner who made 7 war patrols in the cold North Atlantic of the early 1960's, I found this movie to be the most realistic.Red October and Crimson Tide were good and related to the type submarines I was on but this WW2 action movie  hit it out of the park. Blue Ray enhanced the already good sound and film quality. You felt like you were right there on the sub. It made me glad I was on a Polaris American submarine in the 1960's instead of the iron coffins of WW2
B009K0P10K|5.0|A fun and well done series..like to see the fashion and interaction with the characters..always suspenceful to see what Emily will do next .
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|It has a good story. I like that it's actually R rated, for bloody gratuitous violence.  It is a good remake!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book, and all the books in this series.  You feel like you are loosing friends when you get to the end of the book!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game!!If you love horses,you must get this game.You get to feed and groom a realistic,kind horse!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book!  It was well written, had lots of surprises and was very visually stimulating.  I am hoping they make a movie out of it.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|When I first heard of Lana Del Rey I wasn't so sure how I felt about her. I heard a few songs but never really listened. One day I decided to try again and I was hooked. Now I'm a huge fan of her and Born to Die is definitely one of my all time favorite albums. I also like her Paradise album and hope for more music soon!
B003E8P9G0|3.0|This was just OK.  I was looking for something to read after the Hunger Games and this was a recommendation, but I think this may be for younger readers.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|I bought this for when I'm recording road trips on my motorcycle. Works great so I can stop and start recording on the fly all day because the GoPro can stay plugged in.. No changing batteries.. No problems with lens fogging up with elevation or temperature changes.
B007712XAU|5.0|I love this series!  I am excited that it has done so well.  These DVD's were actually a gift for another Downton lover :)
B007STXHTM|4.0|Picked up one of these to take with us on our honeymoon in the Caribbean.  Images were clear and we got some excellent video from our snorkeling excursion.  1 star off for the lens screws.  I bought a Red filter and polarized filter for the dive lens.  The screws were extremely hard to loosen to add the filters. Since we were only snorkeling and weren't going more than 3-5 meters deep I only used the polarized filter. The screw heads stripped and there is no longer any hope of removing or changing the filter now without having to get new screws. Very disappointed..  No leaks and no regrets though. I'm just going to have to get a 2nd dive housing for the red filter now.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love, love, love this series!!  I would love to find more books like these.  I am so sad that I am at the end.
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|The album gives you the smooth music that make you want to sway and bob your head. Meanwhile, Lana's lyrics makes you say, \\"wait, what?\\". It's her style - sweet sounds and controversial lyrics. I like it, I love it, I want more of it!! I would've liked more tracks for an album. That's why it gets a 4 star review. At least two more songs should've been available b
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game. I have really enjoyed playing it.  Only problem is sometimes it says come back in 24 hours to get a mystery prize, but then you can't get the game to advance.  It just stops at 0:00 and you miss the prize.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|Great movie!<br />The cast was a good choice and the story was much more interesting than the standard animated film.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I've only seen the first episode but already want to see more. I think the first season should be on prime.
0062238868|5.0|Thank you for your service to our country Chris, may you rest in peace. You died doing what you loved to do, helping others!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Once again I lost sleep over this one, but not because I was staying up late to read just so I could see what happened next.  I had very vivid dreams after reading this one.  Kind of freaked me out actually...in a good way.
B00B7FXYJG|4.0|The movie had its vulgar parts, but they didn't deter from telling a great story. We got to see Superman here and Bruno!
B00846REIS|5.0|HOT, HOT, HOT!  These are a couple of really screwed up people but dang if they're not hot together!!!  Not gonna lie, Gideon scares me a bit though.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game would be great if it didn't randomly shut down, usually after a nice long run. Of course, when you restart it, none of your acheivements counted. But, you find that any gems you used do count against you, sometimes resulting in a negative gem count (because the ones you collected didn't count). Frustrating.
B000BMYWYC|5.0|Best adhesive for models, by far. Doesn't make a mess, and has very precise application. I totally recommend this product for people who  hate using cement glue. No mess, works quick, and is all you need.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|cool game I  loved it!!!!! great for horse lover's so realistic the graphics are amazing so happy it is free!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is similar to temple run.Someone is running after you and you can jump on to things and have a jet pack and get cool characters!I got this game for free and it was worth getting it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is simple, elegant and easy to use.  I especially like the way it shows your previous calculations.  I use it every day, with zero issues!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved this book.  It was an amazing book. I liked at the end how he made me think that Logan and Keith both died. I chose a 5 star rating for this book.  Nicholas Sparks is o me of favorite authors.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|I thought this movie wa a good one and one to put with the other ones that has been made.I think it is time ti move on to something else.There has been too many of the Missiom Impossible movies done.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. John Green makes it seem real and just like how two people can fall in love no matter what situation that they are in. I chose a 5 star rating for this book.  I love reading John Green`s books.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|I liked this movie very much.It kept my interest through out the whole movie.I have always ilked Liam Neeson,I don't remember a movie that he was in that was not good.This movie is a keeper.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a good ending for everyone.  It is a little sad but we all know that after a tragedy life always goes on.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter and I love this game! We are entertained and challenged to keep achieving goals. When we get started it is hard to stop. It is the game we play 90percent of the time.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is very easy to use and very easy to read.  We really like the 10 day forcast feature.  We have also used the satellite images.  It is helpful to see how close the storm is to you.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks certainly knows how to keep hopeless romantics entertained! From page one until the very last page, you are kept entranced as you watch the mysterious past life of \\"Katie'\\" a beautiful waitress unfold. From her relationship with Alex, a single father who runs the family store, to her bond with his two kids, and the abusive life she left behind, you will not be able to put this book down! One of Mr. Sparks' finest works. This story also has a chilling ending with a twist that will keep you on the edge of your seat! FIVE STARS!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have been a huge facebook fan for several years now.  It is nice to be able to check facebook on my kindle fire hd.  Thank you.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game , halfback did a really nice job with this game. I know halfback are the kind of people who like to put upgrades in their games, but they really outdone themselves with the whacky upgrades and cars.

0385344228|2.0|This book was engrossing reading; couldn't put it down.<br />Trouble is, that a good number of facts almost conclusively pointed to the innocence of the accused and then , in an unbelievable and uncharacteristic final twist, everything detailed earlier was simply disregarded.<br />I love a good , well written mystery, but I hate it when  it insults my intelligence.<br />This book was both well written and an insult to a thinking reader's intelligence.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is so fun. I think that this is a very fun g game. I like ok t as lot. We play . It all the rtf one. Oil like it a lot it is as super fun as nd c uhh te
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is one of those books that reveals things about its characters layer by layer until you feel like they are a part of you.  We all make judgments of others whether knowing or unknowingly and this story reveals the humanity behind some of the things others do.  Suddenly you find yourself smiling, understanding, and even identifying.  It is a beautiful story of a man who finally dares to do something different and finds redemption along the way.
1452110581|5.0|There are some really funny poems in this book.  I enjoyed it.  Here are eight more words.  Oops, three more.
B003O86FMW|5.0|All I can say is I couldn't put it down.  I did nothing else but read until I finished.  A lot of twist and turns.  You think you know where it is going and then you are completely surprised.  Very good characters. Excellent writing, keeps your interest to the very end
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I purchased the &#34;original uncut UK&#34; version because I thought it would have scenes not included in the version we get in the US. Other than a few slang words that are used in the UK and not here, I don't see any difference in these versions to what I have been watching. I still love the show and am glad to have them, and will purchase seasons 1 and 2 as soon as possible. But it doesn't seem necessary to buy the UK version. (If anyone has had a different experience I would appreciate knowing.)
B004AKCMD4|3.0|I'm sure the book is fantastic, but this 1 1/2 hour movie tries to cover too much in too short of a period of time.  There's no character development, the timeline is obscure, and the story just...isn't.  The graphics are utterly amazing and worth the price of admission.  Couple that with a killer surround sound, and it's worth the watch...once.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Now in his early 70s, Bob Dylan has hit the ground running with this album after a lengthy uninspired period. His ballad about the sinking of the Titanic is as good as anything he's ever done. Though his voice has gone gravel-y he uses it to dramatic effect and he's added a new creative signature to his work---a precision to the enunciation of particular words, so compelling that the listener cannot help but repeat them. There's a deeply emotional tone to the lyrics throughout the album and now, again, we can hear them clearly.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game!  Definitely more fun than the original Temple Run.  Can't wait to see how far I can go.
1452110581|5.0|All those who live with cats can tell that the author knows about cats.  My cats could have written any of these &#34;poems&#34; themselves.  Great expression.<br /><br />When I saw the title on the shelf at the public library, I had to take it down and see what it was about.  I was delighted and after reading it, I had to purchase my own copy to share with others.
B008MEM24S|4.0|my kids (ages 2-12) and I really enjoy this app.  my 2 year old enjoys Perry even though she doesn't understand the game as a whole.  and at times it challenges me and my older kids.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|I didn't know there was a sequel to &#34;From Larkrise to Cranford&#34;-so I'm so happy to find this quality movie for the whole family! It has awesome actors!
B001JU4S44|3.0|We hadn't seen the series in a while, so went back to watch them.  This was OK as far as movies goes, but it doesn't reach the level of action and story as the others in the series.
0800141660|5.0|Another Great adaptation of Jane Austen's work. The cast are quality actors. All the family can watch this dvd. Worth buying!!!
B00280LYIC|5.0|The percy jackson series is my 2nd favorite series of all times. One problem is the kindle version is 4 dolllars and I alraedy buoght the real books for alot more money
6305907145|5.0|This is a very modern version of Jane Austen's story. They use Jane Austen's thoughts from her diary too througout the movie. There is a brief nudity scene so this is not suitable for young children. It is a good story with good actors. I liked it.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Such a good history of one location deserves 5 stars! watch this movie and you won't be disapointed! peow! Peow!
B00005MP58|5.0|Love this version. The actors are awesome. The scenes are great in this movie and so is the costumes. Love this DVD!!
6305127646|4.0|A little dated, but timeless at the same time, like The Hunt For Red October. I'm glad I got this. Cool movie, If you like the Bourne movies, you'll probably like this too.
B00063F8B2|5.0|If you loved the movie you will love this CD. It has all of the songs and the quality is great!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like it. wish we could go trail riding that would be really cool. also in the paddock it is hard to get her to run hut other than that's its cool
B002MQYOFW|5.0|must buy this book it is fantastic! I suggest this book is for children 13 and up. the book is a lot more graphic than the movie so keep that in mind when buying for children.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|i loved from the start. it is very addictive. can not wait to get more coins every day. the game can be enjoyed by both kids and adults.
B003O86FMW|5.0|i love this book i have reread it multiple times it is fantastic kept me hooked till the very end
B0055SWM08|5.0|Easy to get lost in the game, next thing you know, you just lost a bunch of time.  Worth it, though.
B007SAP83Y|4.0|somewhat redeemed by orchestral detail-especially the winds, and five of the six soloists. Above all do not purchase without auditioning a large sample. His earlier Cosi overture ca 1964 sounds quite similar to this one but it is misleading in re about 60-70 percent of the performance. This is tragic. I owned it on lp but could bear only the first<br />hour. In comparison with Eugen Jochum's great, quickly paced  but not perfect complete DG version, this one is ten minutes longer:180 minutes vs. OK's 190. Jochum is cursed with Seefried's painful Fiordiligi, while Klemperer's<br />Guglielmo, Geraint Evans, sounds woolly and too elderly for the role. Both Margaret Price and Yvonne Minton are superb.  Price meets no trouble in the mezzoist range required in Come scoglio and Per Pieta.  Minton possesses<br />a smaller but sufficiently penetrating voice with a lovely timbre.  Luigi Alva sounds young and sings attractively<br />but his Un Aura amorosa is a bit too light/weak. Popp and Sotin have been equalled but not bettered, I think. When Popp enters, the sun emerges and she seems to enliven Klemperer a bit. Try her \\"in uomini\\"  Sotin and Evans perhaps should have exchanged roles- Evans as Don Alfonso  would require less youth, power, and voice than Guglielmo. Prey and Fischer-Dieskau are perfectly cast for Jochum. Popp and Jochum's Despina Erika Koth are the best Despinas that I have heard, with Bohm's 1975 Reri Grist quite close. Sotin and Popp are balms, but the tempo elephant is not absent for long. Try the farewell chorus in Act 1 CD 1 or the Act I finale on CD 2 for example.  All in all, I consider this  barely a four star performance (from a five star conductor who had loved and touted Cosi for at least fifty years- long before its current popularity)rather than one with three stars, depending<br />largely upon one's reaction to the tempi. If tempi are not problematic, the stars rise.<br /><br />peers: Jochum/DG; Davis/Philips; Bohm/Decca and DG (both abridged-see my reviews); Marriner
B000002NIW|1.0|Really bad quality. I got it a little late and once I did, I played it - NONE of the songs worked.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I have played this game on the computer for a long time, and I loved it. When pocket edition came out, I bought it right away.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|While I enjoyed the book, I was nagged by the feeling that it had been rushed through the editing process.  Tedious in places while the author developed characters to an extreme and then rushed toward the end.  It was as if someone said, &#34;o.k. enough of this, time to wrap it up.&#34;  Another good Grisham read.  Not a great one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book really flowed well and I would recommend to everyone . Defiantly one of my favorites of Nicholas Sparks!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Was hooked from the beginning and an unexpected ending that was better than I could have imagined...  I will be reading everything else Nicholas Sparks has written!
B007P6VM04|5.0|Watch the SMASH hit on t.v. And enjoy the music  a great deal. Ordering it online s a lot easier than going to the store.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good but went a little far at the end. It said I need 11 more words so here they are.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Entertaining enough to read, a quick read. This book is similar to but not quite as good as The Hunger Games. Recommend more for the younger crowd.
B000AP04NI|4.0|Not my favorite musical by far, but there are several memorable songs in this movie (and some very talented voices).
1608871088|5.0|I've seen so many artbooks of animation films through my whole life, but this one definitely goes up to my favourite ones. It's art's so amazing and the text just makes it better. I'd never regret buying it at all. Maybe I wish there'd be more about the concept art for the movie and something about deleted scenes, but it's okay since everything else it's just perfect. Definitely a must have if you're interested in animation, or illustration.
1451613512|4.0|I would definitely recommend this book as it filled in many side incidents that I was unaware of. If you are a conspiracy fan this will give you more material to possibly give you grist. The greatest problem is that it was not a scintillating read. It read like a dry text, thats why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5. You have to be motivated to plod through it. Having a degree in Intelligence and an MA in national security studies, I pushed myself to read it, and enjoyed it. I'd recommend to history buffs primarily.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Good graphics and gameplay, but I finished it in less than two hours. It looks like it was chopped-down so they could release a sequel. Not very many locations to search and the puzzles are easy to solve. Good for beginners, but pros should look elsewhere.
B002ECEUL2|4.0|I chose that rating because of the level of my satisfaction of the book.<br />Book's content on disadvantaged and posibilities
B00A77II0U|5.0|While most mystery game apps are the usual \\"find this object\\", STRAY SOULS: DOLLHOUSE STORY also uses this strategy as a small part of a bigger story. Some of the puzzles are hard, but the clues are there for you to find. I've played quite a few of these type of games and this one rates up there with one of the best. Unlike most game apps for your Android device, this one will take you a lot longer to finish, which makes it worth the price. The graphics are quite nice and some of the cut scenes managed to raise a hair or two on the back of my neck. Spooky without being gory.
0765325950|5.0|Been waiting for this book a long time. It is worth the wait. I'm now a fan of Sanderson's work.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Plenty of locations to search and puzzles to solve. I would say this was an intermediate mystery game app. It may be too hard for beginners and somewhat easy for pros, but the gameplay is addictive and, unlike some games, it autosaves where you last left off. If you like using your brain while you play games, THE LOST CITY may be right up your alley.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Everything in this series is wonderful. I can't wait for the fourth season. We need to thank the family that owns that beautiful place for sharing it with us.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Good book, kept me interested and wondering.  Many twists and turns.  It also was easy to read.  The ending however...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 continues to be as good, or better, than previous seasons! More surprises than ever...and with more sarcastic humor! I love it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Read the book to find out what katniss will decide and who will she pick, Peeta or Gale...............This has no spoilers
0671027344|5.0|My daughter could not wait to read this book, so I surprised her! She loved it. She will not be giving it away because she will retread it!
0399226907|5.0|Awesome Book for any age! I bought this for my daughter and grandson to read together... and they both Love it!
B000E1YVZU|5.0|My son bought this as a gift for a friend and she loved it, especially that it was the special edition.  They have watched it many times.
B002D0L0R2|3.0|It was not the origional one so I'm giving it a rating of 3 . I liked it but not as much as origional Hair Spray Movie inwhich I thought I had ordered.<br />Thanks
B003Y5H574|5.0|This was a gift and it was loved! It had been watched over and over. Great actors in this movie!
0345803507|5.0|This book is a keeper i read part 1 & 2 the best book ever can wait for the movie.
B008J34466|4.0|I purchased this CD for her song &#34;Try&#34; and was surprised that the vast array of songs on here. I love P!nk and her attitude.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|It was the third book of Gillian Flynn that I have read and I started noticing patterns in her way of writing. This book was OK, certainly much better than Gone Girl, but a bit too much dwelling on dark side of &#34;decent&#34; town and psychologically wrecked girls. And the plot twist reminded me the other book of Gillian Flynn, but I can't go into details without spoiling. However, it becomes somewhat predictable.
B00454U1NS|5.0|Nice collection of P!nk songs for anyone that wants to get to know her music better and the path that has brought her to where she is.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|A good fun game for all ages. Reminds me of the old Sonic game just get the coins instead of the rings.
B0095H4FAA|5.0|I literally couldn't put this down. I would start reading and the next thing I knew 3 hours had passed, and I STILL couldn't stop reading. It truely is THAT good.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Although not really aimed at my age group (70 plus), I enjoyed all three of these books and am looking forward to seeing the movies.
0061537969|5.0|If you're a dog lover (even if you're on the fence), read this book and you'll have no doubts left. What a heart felt book, I can't say enough positive things about this story.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|pretty trashy, more kinky sex than storyline, really not well written, I don't know why every body is raving about this book
0307454568|5.0|The begining was a bit hard to get into because of all the political references, but overall it did not disappoint! It was a great read just like the first 2 books in the trilogy.
B005DNPKSQ|4.0|I watched this movie for one of my classes.  Normally I get really bored with movies I have to watch for class, but this movie ened up being a good movie.  If you are into sociology, then I recommend you watching it.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|best book I have ever read my father fought in ww2, battle of the budge, went thu d day. and extermanation camps liberation.Greatest generation ever...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|ive played this game on my lil bros ipod and it was a million times better than temple run I'm typing words to get 20 minimum
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|What could I say? It's The terminator! The sound and video is excellent. I saw things I hadn't noticed on the DVD.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This makes me cry every single time. Each character is relatable in their own way, and this book confronts issues that we all face on some level.
B004EPZ00C|5.0|Funny , funny.  I have the first one. Funny. Buy it you will like it. It has all of Rowans best antics in it. Funny.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Absolutley great cd from beginning to end.  If you love Shinedown then you will love Amaryllis.  Can't wait for their next one!
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you tap screen, cards will float to where game thinks it should go.  Obviously, for more points, it is better to drag card to desired pile.  Just play and enjoy
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I had a completely different idea of what this book was about.  I was drawn in trying to see if Mr. Grey could change his ways and love.  More of a love story than S&M
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Sliding on ropes and riding in rail cars are a few of the new things you can enjoy in this new version. Oh and there is just one giant creature chasing you instead of as bunch of little ones
B00571F26Y|5.0|I am enjoying all of the information that is presented. It is written with a sense of humor and an in-depth look at the science behind what the wheat we now consume.
B007L6VR12|5.0|I happen to love Wes Anderson movies and this was no excpetion! Saw it in the theater and knew I wanted to own the DVD when it was available. Fun story and good characters. Probably doesn't rank as high as some of his other movies but still very good.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|This cover gets the job done. In red, it makes my Kindle Fire easy to  spot regardless of where I set it down around the house. It also protects my Kindle Fire from the elements. Now, if they can make the Kindle Fire capable of being read outside, I've got a winning combination.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great graphics...fun game for everyone<br />lots of cool surprises<br />much better than temple run 1<br />I highly recommend<br />love it!...Can't put it down!
B003QSPTAY|5.0|As usual this original is better than the remake.  Our kids all loved it and there was a lot of laughter while they watched it.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This was a gift for someone else , but I had the opportunity to listen to it , it is great.
B00846REIS|5.0|Similar to 50 Shades, but a much better story and I think better written. Can't wait for the third book to come out this spring.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I have no idea why everone was so down on this movie. It had lots of action, great FX & had a good story. Yes it didn't follow the books but so what it was still a fun movie to watch. I Recommend this to anyone that wants a good show.
0765325950|5.0|I have been a huge fan of this series for over 16 years!  I am very happy with the culmination and enjoyed the book tremendously!  I can't wait to reread the entire series again with the final piece of the puzzle!  Thank you Sanderson, for completing Jordan's work!
B000PC6A3E|5.0|This is a great movie that anyone would like. Lots of action & it's Batman enough said. Buy it you'll love it
B00B7FW6U4|3.0|The movie picks up after the other 3.  It was good but I liked the original 3 a little better.
140003180X|5.0|I love this series and have decided to collect all of them. Some passages seem more like poetry than prose to me. Highly recommended!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Just what I wanted works great may get another one later on.. Had a off brand and didn't like it at ll.
0739480898|5.0|Since I was born in 1944, I do have any personal recollections of World War II. This story was an eye-opener for me in many ways. And I was intrigued by the descriptions of how people lived during those times.
B00A757EFW|2.0|There is not a lot of control in this game. I wish the screen was bigger so you can really see whats going on.
B005SFR7YE|4.0|It is nice having my own copy to watch on my time frame.  I've seen it live in SF and can appreciate the differences.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book is great, really a must read, now must rent the movie and see if it compares. Definitely recommend this book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm 10 years old and I can see the real beauty of this book.The way it speaks to you I can't even put into words.I highly suggest The Hunger Games trilogy.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|The story was fantastic and addicting it would be a 5 if it wasn't for the spelling errors. Nothing indecipherable though.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I totally recommend this game who loves slipping sliding jumping zip lining and adventure action apps. I am ADDICTED to this apps!!!!!!
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|This book was very good and entertaining for a while, but once i got to about 2/3 of the book, it just started getting a little repeditive. On the last page of the book, i diddnt even know it was the last page. Not a very good solid ending, i hope the Pandemonium book will pick up from the unfinished scene it left off at.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers  is a very good game . I think you should put a African theme to it to make it better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great. There is always more to do. The best part is its free. Also you can log onto Facebook and see your friends high scores ans stuff like that. It is also very easy to play and hack.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Compelling in the first half, but gets way too involved at the end. Not believable and the ending, if you can call it that, leaves you with some resentment after you've slogged through to the last page.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|My four year old grandson loves this toy.  It is very well made and a nice size for playing in the dirt. I expect it to last for years.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun game. I can't even put it down. I play it like 23 hours or of the 24 hour day period. Some times it glitches though that's why I give it 4 stars but this game is so fun!
0399160450|5.0|Cyber action world wide.  Timely and interesting.  Should be required reading for Congress.  Current information matching current news.  Smells like China.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mindcraft is totally worth 7$ because you imagine it and build it's the best thing the whole wide WORLD/earth it's WORLD and its earth so get it rite.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Great movie! Major departures from the novel, but will provide excellent conversations. Bought to show to my students. Works in my work computer. Great cast.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Tantalizing, mesmerizing, couldn't put the book down. Will definitely read the trilogy.  Very very very very very good and erotic.
B004SEUJ82|4.0|Bought this to show to my students. It arrived quickly and is a great movie. Very powerful, especially the ending. Doesn't follow the book exactly, but will generate great conversation. However, the DVD didn't play in my work computer so I couldn't use it.
B0039YZPZ4|5.0|Great movie.  Just enough action and humor and puzzles to hit all the right notes.  Very much enjoyed it.  Recommend.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I got caught up with this one early and plowed through as many levels as I could in one sitting.  I've played a bunch of times since, and it stays fresh.. rare among most games.  Some boards take me 5 seconds, others have taken me upwards of 20 minutes.  For some reason, it's satisfying every single time.  Good game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a great book for ppl who like romance, but with a freaky twist. Most wonderful first kiss! Definitely reading another one of her books.
1594484805|5.0|Drive has certainly influenced the conversation about motivation in the workplace---the topic of which is full of nuance.  Nuance aside, Pink gets the big picture right. It's an important book....well written, from an author who not only has has a seat at the table' but a \\"bully pulpit\\" to boot!. It stimulated my thinking in many important ways...I suspect it will yours too!<br /><br />Bill Wiersma, Author--The Power of Professionalism
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I purchased it for my Kindle HD and it loaded easily.  It starts out easy and progresses in difficulty.  The colors and textures are varied and the pictures are whimsical.  The game had a lot of content for the price.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|this helps my little one with his reflexes...its an ok game, not something to play constantly. there are a few levels on it that should be pretty good for an older person.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so much fun. Addicting! It reminds me of temple run a bit! So I think everyone should try it! Go subway surfer!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this game is sooo fun. i love games like this, and this is the best puzzle type game i have played in a while.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this for the current wrath and forecast.  Much easier than opening the web browser and doing a search.  So far, the forecast has been pretty accurate.
0765325950|5.0|I have been waiting for this book for a very long time. It has exceeded my expectations and I love the ending. Left me feeling very fulfilled.
B003RDB8HQ|5.0|Great movie, it is so refreshing to have the French spin on life and love.  Generally they are masters of film. I am good with subtitles and have watched the movie several times. It is earning a place in my favourites.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Casual Vacancy was a surprise for Harry Potter fans!  Present day portrayal of one man's influence on a small town.  Great character development, but slow at times.  Seems to end abruptly although most loose ends are wrapped up.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|Unless you like firepower an lots of destruction the weak dialog and foolish plot are not worth much.  Time to retire and watch their own fight movies.
B000ID1J5E|5.0|This is a great movie! Meryle Streep plays an awesome role! Suspenseful and keeps you entertained! My 11 year old soon really enjoyed it too!
B002W5UVSM|5.0|i would recommend this fantastic book to friends and family. It was funny sad and very entertaining. so sad the author is not alive to write more
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you haven't seen Serenity then buy it along with this. The sci-fi moody cowboy show with bits of chinese language thrown in will make you laugh out loud for real. Great fun and wonderful dramam this is a series you'll watch over and over.
B004SRNH10|2.0|On Galaxy S3 app store stalls on install to no avail even after reboot. This version is weak and runs constantly in the background even after the initiating app has closed.<br /><br />I installed an older version with Titanium Backup and it works much better than this current colossal failure version.
B00589AYWW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and learned a lot from it. Tuchman's writing is clear and precise and makes a potentially dry subject read like a novel.
0307592731|1.0|I found this book depressing, as it is marred by unnecessary detail about the author's seedy past experiences. In the middle of a nauseating story about euthanizing her mother's horse by shooting it in the head (let's just say it didn't go well) I had to quit reading.
B005K17RU0|5.0|An excellent app that provides awesome graphics, as well as excellent benefits, providing a robust solution , plus ITS FREE! Recommend without hesitation.
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of those books you ahve trouble putting down; would recommend to anyone wanting a great read; Looking forward to the movie in November.
B0013ND30M|1.0|The DVD didn't look like the original one and it stopped working 1/2 way thought. Disapointed that it stopped working.
030758836X|4.0|The book Gone Girl was recommended to me by several people.  I will be the firs to admit that the story will grip you from page one.  Everytime that I thought that I had the book figured out I was wrong.  DEAD wrong.<br /><br />At the beginning, you really feel bad for Amy.  Amy is one of two main characters.  She disappears on her fifth wedding anniversary.  The way that you hear from Amy is through her diary.  One chapter is told by her husband Nick during the time of the disapperance.  The next chapter will be told by Amy through the diary.  The diary is supposed to give the reader a background look at Amy and Nick's relationship from dating through their present married state. Amy's diary is told by a lovestruck woman who \\"fawns\\" over everything that Nick does.  All the while, you really hate Nick.  From way he acts when finds out his wife is missing, to finding out he has been keeping a big secret, you will for sure think he killed her.  Did he?  I won't tell.. read for yourself.<br /><br />I will tell you this.  By the end of the book you hate them both. They are both twisted and sick individuals.  I am glad that this story is a work of fiction.  I truly hope that there are not people as sick as these two in the world.  It is still a good read that will keep you guessing.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|The Bourne Series is officially dead.  This film was completely unnecessary as it was basically the same as the first Bourne movie but only half as good.  They really should have just stopped.  The only reason they made this film was because the Bourne Name is so huge that making it would net them an easy $150 million regardless of script.<br /><br />Its not that this film is bad per say, moreso that it is just completely redundant and compared to its predecessors, its just not a good film.  If the 1st three Bourne films were lions and tigers than this film would be a sick house cat by comparison
B000SW4DV2|4.0|5 year old son loved it as did I. Great humor, loved the comedy. Going to buy this one for the collection.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|After viewing Seasons 1 and 2 for free on my Kindle, I have been purchasing each episode of Season 3.  I thought I'd be able to catch up with the t.v. version; but I found out the UK version (which is what I've been watching) is behind the U.S. version; so now I'll have to purchase at least two more before I can start watching it on t.v.
B008476HBM|4.0|Beautiful, classic story.  The descriptive language brings to mind romance, fancy balls and gallantry no longer found in this modern age.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I really enjoyed this season.  I was unable to watch it on FX, so I bought the first season.  It was interesting, creepy and kept my interest.  I recommend it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game I love it!!! I play it all the time great way to pass the time! Hope they come out with more add ons.
0679805273|5.0|I ordered this book to add to my collect of random favorites.  Comes in brand new perfect condition. Great present for anyone, especially cute idea for someone going through a life change that might need support, or just enjoys Dr Seuss!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire was all about adventure and very exciting.  This book makes you want to get the next book Mockingjay.
0718157834|5.0|It will make you laugh, cry, it will surprise you and eventually break your heart..There have been a few days since I finished reading this book and I m still thinking about it!
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I enjoyed most moments of this movie. My kids loved it though. Definitely tailored for younger audiences with some very simple humor.<br />Not very though provoking or deep, just an enjoyable little movie.<br /><br />P.S. The amazon prime rental for 24h was a bit too steep for my liking ($3.99) maybe the pricing will go down in the near future.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Where was this Prince Charming when I was single?  He is too good to be true but I enjoyed the fantasy.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I was worried that the magnets would be loose and not stay in place very well but after using this for over a month... I can say that both the magnet connecting to your charger is quite strong... and the magnet connecting to the laptop is as strong as the connector that comes with my mac.  Would definitely recommend instead of buying a whole new power adapter.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I bought this novel as an ebook so I didn't realize how long it actually is. Because of its length, I have yet to finish it, but I have gotten about half-way through it and it's pretty good so far. I'd recommend it to others.
1616550414|5.0|I ordered this just for the time line and it was a great read! Most of the art is skyward sword but I loved the concepts and how characters were originally.<br /><br />If you think about this book, buy it! It was a great purchase and the comic in the back is great too!
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|It's not worse than any of the other Resident Evil movies, but it's definitely not a great action movie either.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|Purchased the Let Me In DVD several weeks ago and I just think this is one amazing movie. Everything about the movie; the story, the acting, the darker mood and musical score were just terrific. I did see the original<br />Swedish movie which was also good in its own right, but prefer this version so much more!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Apart from the awful songs sung by Russel Crowe, everyone else in this soundtrack does an extremely excellent job not only in singing, but actually making you believe that they are feeling every single word that they are singing. It's a wonderful soundtrack and would recommend any musical lover to purchase.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Funny movie but a little out there.  Pretty raunchy in parts.  Mark Wahlberg and Mila were great together.  Definitely not for children.
B0091REZMW|4.0|cool I like it a lot. great way to kill time. some are a little challenging but that's the best part.
0312641893|5.0|I was a little skeptical about reading this book because I love fairytales and was unsure about a robotic cinderella.  This was such a FUN book to read.  Marissa Meyer did an awesome job of making cyber cinderella so believable and still maintained that fairy tale feel.  I have pre-ordered Scarlett and cannot wait to read the second book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is so much fun. It got me so addicted right from the start. I love it! wonderful for making time pass.
1582701709|4.0|Great read. Just a nice guide to follow. its an informative and instructive way of life sometimes we could all use a little help this is an excellent guide
B0011UJMK2|4.0|This is a book that grabs you right from the beginning. I think it was well researched and an accurate interpretation of Russia under Stalin. I have read several books about Russia under siege during WWII, so it was really interesting reading about this time period. The development of the main character as he uncovers what really happened and how no one wanted to uncover the truth makes this a real interesting read.<br /> I enjoy reading a mystery book, that is more than just a who done it. The hero of this book is fighting and entire political system as well as trying to find the killer.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone. Easy to shop with my Kindle Fire and I have used it to purchase items.
B004Y042N8|4.0|Great time waster app to keep the ole noodle engaged in geometric/path puzzle solving.  Definately on of the more entertaining games of puzzle solving I have seen in a while.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the detail and customization in the game and how u can interact with it and that u can name the horse<br />1<br />@
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Contains the song highlights from the movie so I can re-live those moments in my head over and over again.  The Bellas and Treblemakers on demand and on my time, as many times in a row as I deem necessary.  Great sound, great voices, and for kids of the 80's and 90's...great music.  The millennial mix of pre-2K and post 2K is well done.  Definately worth a buy if you're a fan of the movie.
B004EI3ON4|4.0|While the US version does not have all the MP trax, it is still nicely mixed.  If you are picky, scrounge around on the web for the Canadian or import version.  If you are an enthusiasts,  buy this one while waiting on the other versions to show up stateside or keep you company while you globe trot hunting for a CD of all the trax.
B007XF4J70|5.0|Casablanca is a standard by which all movies should be judged.  It was and still is the greatest propaganda movie of World War II.  It was made to show how the Allies were working together and would prevail over Germany.  The plot was to show that west was not weak of inferior to the Germans and that they were willing to make sacrifices for the cause of victory.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game for kids 5-20years of age you should really get this game but warning this bane freeze up some time.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|Extremely happy.  Eartips are a great price.  Delivery in a few days.  I have ordered these eartips previously and had the same experience.  The rubber tips last a lot longer if you put the foam over them.  I will order again when I am down to one eartip.  Wi

B008HK3XYK|5.0|I absolutely love my marware standing case for Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;.  The orange was a great color because it is easy to find.  I like the fact that I can close my case with it's ribbon so I can keep all other papers out of it when I place it in my pocketbook.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was really good. It is a quick read. I really liked the twist in the plot. As soon as you thought the characters were finally getting through their conflicts, boom! I wish the book was a couple of chapters longer, but if I put my thoughts about why on here it will give it away. No spoiling it for you!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|We love NCIS! It's been our favorite show for years and is honestly the only show we make sure watch every single episode. Even after 10 seasons they've still got a great show. Love it!
B009O07NDY|5.0|My boyfriend is  HUGE LOTR fan. This was a perfect addition to his collection. The music, packaging, and booklet are beautiful.
B00005JPSM|5.0|This is one of my very favorite chic flicks! Actually, even my husband likes it! It's nice and clean, which is great for a chic flick. If you want a good chic flick, with great actors, a good story, great romance, and that isn't explicit or crass, this is the one for you.

B0031TZ8TU|4.0|This was a fun book to read.  I was aware of the characters and the crisis but not all the detail Ken Follett provided. It made for an interesting book and one that adds to my knowledge of the times and the people involved - especially Ross Perot.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Okay so avoided watching this film because I find sports movies boring. how wrong i was, this film is so beautiful and amazingly acted! I have watched half a dozen times. I watched it on prime but I bought a copy ten minutes after it was over.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I LOVED this book.  A captivating story about love and loss.  I couldn't put it down.  I finished it in 2 days.  I read Hopeless first and wanted to read another book by the author (loved that book, also.)  I was beyond thrilled when I discovered there was a second book to Will and Layken's story.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Okay so if i was going to say more, i'd say Jessica Chastain, Jason Clark, Guy Pierce and if that not enough... Gary Oldman.  Here's the real deal, i was so afraid that this would be unwatchable bloody, it's not. it's just enough bloody with a side of justice. every minute intense and edge of your seat, please see this film.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|i would have put 5 stars but there is a glitch that hinders me.i have to keep un installing it and re installing it because it wont turn on. i know its not just on my kindle because it does that on my friend's kindle too.<br />other than that this is an awesome game.<br />Imangi Studios, please fix this bug so i can change my review.this game would rock if you would fix the glitch.
0307719774|5.0|I am the kinda person that writes a novel not a journal. I am excited to have something so straight forward. I tend to go too deep and depressing in a normal journal but this helps me focus on the positive things. Some of the questions seem kinda silly but i have been trying to put my own spin on them. Today my question was what is the weather like? I live in Western Washington State and it's February so I could probably never gone outside and said one word, overcast. Instead, i went outside felt the air and tried to take in the details and appreciate them. This is so cool because it's like a personal time capsule. The book is small but after everyone's reviews saying how tiny it was it didn't seem to bad. there are four line to write and I didn't have any problem fitting what i wanted to say. i travel alot so small is good. the book is also very classic and well made.

B009FXIICK|5.0|Very fun and great for consuming time, when busy. I usually play it before bed. I definitely recommend playing it.
0345494768|5.0|Superbly written and illustrated, this book sets the bar so high for others in its genre. The stories surrounding the movie's creation (and Lucas' creative talents) are enlightening and amazing as well, and show the determination of a young George to tell a story through film the way a story -- bafflingly -- had never been told before. BRAVO!

159514188X|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why wasn't as amazing as The Future of Us, but it was pretty close. It was also a really, really, really sad and heavy book. \\"Clay Jensen returns home from school to find a strange package with his name on it lying on his porch. Inside he discovers several cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker - his classmate and crush - who committed suicide two weeks earlier. Hannah's voice tells him that there are thirteen reasons why she decided to end her life. Clay is one of them. If he listens, he'll find out why. Clay spends the night crisscrossing his town with Hannah as his guide. He becomes a firsthand witness to Hannah's pain, and learns the truth about himself-a truth he never wanted to face.\\"    I felt like the beginning of Thirteen Reasons Why was too heavy, too preachy, I suppose. But it got much better as the book progressed. Hannah tells about various people who caused her to fall deeper and deeper into a web of mistrust, and how they (unwittingly or not) caused her to commit suicide. Clay himself loved Hannah for a long time. And then there was the night of the party, really the climax of the book, when a lot is explained. The whole book basically builds up to that one scene, that one tape, that one moment. And the aftermath of it.    The format of this book takes a little getting used to. Hannah's speaking is interspersed with Clay's own thinking, her audio voice in italics, his in regular letters. Sometimes, I would be confused, and then realize that they had switched narration. But it fit the book really well. If Jay Asher had chosen to alternate chapters, it wouldn't have worked as well.    Just like in The Future of Us, there's this idea that everything affects everything else. In The Future of Us, what you do in the present affects your life fifteen years ahead. In Thirteen Reasons Why, if Justin spreads a malicious rumor about Hannah, and so-and-so believes it, and then they do something because of it, and then this whole chain of eventsstarts unfolding, ending with Hannah's suicide.    Speaking of endings, I loved the ending of this book. It felt right, and just a little bit hopeful. Like things could get better, and maybe Clay can have a second chance, even if Hannah can't. This time he can do the right thing.    [...]
B0042K6G6Q|5.0|It has Ben through some rounds of change and now has some too familiar ground and has a feeling of repetition. The acting is good and well produced and directed. It still has a future, if the writers don't get too tired and rest on their previous work. Not good for writers to get bored.... Good entertainment for TV.<br />David Kazm
0307938905|5.0|The book is one of my favorites but the audio needs a different voice!  Nothing like the book.  Kind of boring.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Despite my mixed feelings about the HBO series, I really enjoyed this book. I felt as though everything that was good about the series was even better in the book, and the negative aspects were played down or non-existent.<br /><br />I recommend this book especially if you were irked by the show, but appreciated the setting or story. The first season follows the book almost to the letter, but the book fills in all the holes and makes sense of some of the more confusing aspects of the TV show.
0316232955|5.0|Have you ever run into someone who is too smart for their own good? How about too opinionated? Then this book is for you. Colfer writes with a witty style that is very true to life. High school can be tough and mean, but it's what you make of it. I loved when Carson says, One day high school will end... He's very right. Love this book and I think you will, too.

B004XVMCMQ|5.0|A lengthier movie would have allowed for more character development, however I think it was very well written and acted. There were a few added things that did not appear in the book, but it did not take away from story. I wish Fanny and Edmonds back and forth interactions had been explored a bit more - I found in reading the book I spent the whole time hoping they would end up together and the fact that the outcome wasn't revealed until the very end kept me reading even into the wee hours of the night.<br /><br />All in all, a wonderful and very delightful portrayal of one of my favorite Jane Austin books!

B008AK8FHM|4.0|This was well written (lots of technical information) and held my interest throughout.  Got this book because of a recommendation from a friend and enjoyed it very much.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice n very readable n easy to use. Very helpful when I'm figuring out my bills. Recommend it to everyone.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This game should be free cause some kids want this game but they can't buy it.this game is very fun I always play every day.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This one of the best games I have ever play in my kindle fire hd.you don't get board of playing this game.
0345803485|2.0|Why didn't I think of this; write a stupid love story and explain in detail how a man can treat a woman as a sex object and make millions.  Gee, meanwhile you get to spread the idea of male dominance and lower the stature of women.  Sorry i bought this, it was my daughter's idea, a recent college grad who thought it was a cool book.  At least it led us into a lot of discussions of how not to be treated by men.
B00683JK9K|1.0|This app requires Adobe Air. No reason it should require this bloatware intrusive app to function..... This isn't mentioned anywhere in the description.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awesome the graphics are great but it gets glitched every now then I would recommend this for horse lovers
B00992CF6W|5.0|its great but i wish it had caves, buckets of water and lava, and superflat mode. otherwise its a great and fun game.

B005JR47R6|4.0|This was my favorate show to the point that I purchased the DVD's to be able to watch when ever I get the urge.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|I've been a fan of Garbage ever since their very debut album.  However, after Version 2.0 (my absolute fav), I somewhat stopped paying attention.  Beautiful Garbage was meh and I just couldn't get into Bleed Like Me.  So I was pleasantly surprised when listening this album.  Lots of great tracks, catchy riffs, and balanced electro infusion.  Some of my fav tracks are \\"Blood For Poppies\\", \\"I Hate Love\\", and \\"Man On A Wire\\".  Don't hesitate on buying this album - it absolutely rocks!!!

B000W91RUG|5.0|Awesome series. They have at least 6 seasons out at the writing of this review. I own the first five seasons and am waiting for the 6th one to be released on DVD to buy it. A bunch of nerds who are so funny they will leave you in stitches. They are awkward around girls but have a decent social life like anyone else. It lends insight into the lives of intellectuals. Very funny!! Highly recommended to anyone wanting to laugh, science crowd, math crowd, physics people and anybody studying how abnormal humans interact with others. AWESOME COMEDY SHOW!!
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book!! Very twisted, kept me on the edge of my seat, didn't want to put it down!! I highly recommend it!!
B000GCFO0S|5.0|I have never seen the Silent Hill movies before. I have only played the video games on PS3. The video games are stunning. But the movie is brilliant! The movie is just as creepy, bloody, gory and sophisticated as the video game. This movie takes you to another place in time; a sickly evil parallel dimension filled with the most gruesome monsters and creatures you could ever imagine. The sound, props, sets, and acting are all very impressive and solid. Great cinematography and top (A-list) CGI effects. This is one you buy. I recommend Blu-ray. Thanks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers is fun and addictive. You can get power ups, boosts, and mystery boxes. Cant stop playing it!I love it.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|My son encouraged me to get this and it is a great thing to use when I want to waste time while waiting. Fun game.
B009O2XY12|3.0|Is fun at first but then becomes somewhat tedious.<br />No specific criticisms but is not something I would play often.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Remember when you used to listen to an album all the way through, feeling the ebb and flow of it and finding new nuances and favorites with each listen? Welcome to an album that's meant to be enjoyed as a whole work, not just a collection of possible singles. Like Illuminations, All that Echoes explores the theme of seeking, finding, and losing love, but with a more hopeful outlook and a more diverse range of styles and rhythms.<br /><br />There's not a dud among these songs--I'll be listening through the whole way each time. That said, for me most of the standouts are the new ones, including False Alarms, a song that evokes longing and heartache but with a note of hope; Happy in My Heartache, a very different take on a similar theme, with folk and country undertones; the new single Brave, which is inspirational without being sappy; the stunningly beautiful Un Alma Mas, which features renowned trumpeter Arturo Sandoval; E Ti Promettero, a lovely duet with Laura Pausini; Sincera, a beautiful Italian power ballad; and Below the Line, a rocking anthem about combatting poverty that shouldn't work but does, brilliantly.<br /><br />The cover choices are an interesting mix that highlight Groban's versatility. My favorites are Hollow Talk, a haunting song with an odd structure that works very well with his voice, and I Believe (When I Fall in Love), a lush, full-treatment version of the Stevie Wonder classic. She Moved Through the Fair, a traditional Irish tune, pairs his voice with the uilleann pipes, to wonderful effect. The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress and Falling Slowly are probably the safest choices in terms of meeting listeners' expectations, but he makes them his own with lovely, heartfelt interpretations.<br /><br />Overall, All that Echoes is a great combination of old-world musicality and enough energy for the rock fan in me. Of course, the vocals are gorgeous--his range just keeps getting better, and he makes use of his molten baritone here as well as his upper register. Notably, the melodies, arrangements, and lyrics are all equally superb. If I have a tiny quibble, it's that his voice doesn't quite soar as much as it does when he sings live; it sounds as if he's being just a tiny bit restrained in places, when you want him just to let loose. Note to any future producers: Let him go full throttle, it's how he sounds best.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I have always prefered free cell to  regular solitaire because it involves more decision making on the part of the player.  Having played it for years I find I am able to complete/win the games about 75% of the time.<br />This version has nice graphics and I like being able to check my statistics at any time.<br />If you find the cards too slow floating across the screen at the end of the game you can click on 'new game' at any time.<br />A great game for passing the time while waiting for those time consuming appointments.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love being able to watch the episodes would have been nicer if AMC showed them on-line for free but thats okay $2 an episode is doable.

B002KMR022|5.0|A Blu-ray set that not outclasses its American DVD and Blu counterparts and then takes a few additional victory laps, Arrow Films's Dawn of the Dead gives the greatest of all zombie movies first class treatment. Great a/v quality, outstanding extra features, and some eye-catching packaging. This will surely be one of the centerpieces of my Blu-ray collection.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My two year old loves this app! I love it for its realistic graphics and that you can play for free!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of those books where you just can't stop reading.  The stories are interconnected and through them you have more and more questions which are slowly answered.  The pacing and plot development was excellent.
B007MG360G|5.0|I enjoy the Doodle series very much and was excited to see another chapter. This is designed much better than the previous two in my opinion, with the solid/dashed/dim line scheme that indicates whether something has a current match, future match, or is no longer used. It cut down on the endless tapping of elements that sometimes makes me put the other doodles down for a while. It's an amusing time waster, good for killing boredom especially when you hit upon one of the wackier combos you wouldn't expect.
1416955070|5.0|clare is an AMAZING writer - high energy - GREAT detail and character development .. i was sucked in from page one and have since read the entire series (so far) and cannot wait for the next book to be released ... looking forward to delving into her other series - the infernal devices.

B009VYF5E2|5.0|What's not to love.  This British TV series is just the best, and I'm sorry to know that season 5 is the last.  Which brings up the question - when will Season 5 be available on DVD here in the US?  I am watching it on TV now, but really prefer DVDs.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Season 3 of Downton Abbey was as the previous 2 seasons were, excellent, captivating and moving.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because one of the main charaters (Matthew) dies at the end.  Very disappointing finish.

B006CBSE86|5.0|Definitely Nightwish's best so far, it jumps around a few different genres and feels but it all comes together in an intriguing story line.
1846556694|5.0|Its a very complicated set of plotlines and I recommend taking the time to read it slowly and thoroughly in order to not miss tiny details. The small details make it very much worth reading and its a good look a Japanese Sci/Fi fantasy.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|...that there'd be some kind of collector's edition  of Serenity. I loved the film for the same reasons I loved the TV series: while I don't buy into the idea that Joss Whedon is some kind of uber-genius, I love his characters and his dialogue. He has few equals working today, and I while I will always believe that he and this series deserved better at the time, it's gratifying to see that Hollywierd has finally awakened to the fact that this man can tell a story and tell it better than all but a very few around him. Now--to the package itself: nice clamshell box holds two disks, one with the film and the original bonus features, and the other with what appear to be all the bonus features from the original TV series DVD release, plus a rah-rah piece celebrating the film. Overall quality of the package is high, and frankly, is probably what we should've gotten to begin with. Interesting to ponder what Universal'll dig out for the show's 20th anniversary...<br />A worthy addition, especially if you didn't get the original release of Serenity; otherwise, if you have the TV series boxed set and the film (and if you didn't, what's wrong with you?), you've already got it all.
B00AYL7OAY|5.0|A wonderful gift both for old and new fans. Yo La Tengo's unique style is a great contribution to music.

B005LAIIQC|3.0|**** Spoiler **** Good acting. Renner is the bomb! Weisz makes a passable scientist. This movie could have stood on its' own but then, of course, why would we go see it or rent it? It fell short for me when the Bourne/Treadstone/Pamela Landy references would appear. They seemed to work very hard to remind us it's a Bourne movie and to work in all the new angles as such. I would have rated it much higher if it didn't abruptly stop. No ...\\"conclusion with a window for a possible sequel.\\" Just wham/bam, roll the credits and play Moby. There is no question it was written for at least one additional film because it ends without any resolution what so ever.

B009MO5960|4.0|It was very good but I did feel it was mostly to pull in all the characters and lead into the last movie, worth watching as part of the whole series but not really a stand on its own unlike the rest of them.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great movie. Great price. My daughter watches this movie almost eveyday. I love this movie myself too. Can watch it again and again

1416550550|4.0|I really, really enjoyed this book.  This is my first Kate Morton novel, and I am excited to read more from her.  I had to pay pretty close attention because she switched points of view and time periods fairly often, and some characters showed up in a couple of different time periods.  However, that style really worked for this book.  There was a sort of cliffhanger at the end of each chapter and then she would change the point of view to help clarify what was going on.  It really held my interest well and I kept wishing I had more time available to keep reading.  I ended up being so engrossed in finishing it that I was late to work one morning!

B00A4OALL0|5.0|5 BRILLIANT Stars! Wayne Shorter's first Blue Note recording in decades is \\"Without A Net\\", capturing one of the most influential and riveting groups on the jazz scene in recent years, recorded live mostly on tour in Europe and one mega-track with guests in Los Angeles. On the CD, this all-star group excels at the art of spontaneous composition and exciting interplay and improvisation. The famed composer, tenor and soprano sax giant's all star group consists of the stylings of Danilo Perez on piano, John Patitucci on bass, Brian Blade on drums. The 'best of the best' begins with the Grammy-winning \\"Orbits\\" from Wayne's halcyon days with Miles Davis beginning with Perez' bottom bass notes contrasting Wayne's soprano sax, and the edgy, soaring beauty of \\"Plaza Real\\" from his Weather Report days. Other outstanding performances include the awesome \\"Zero Gravity to the 10th Power\\", \\"S.S. Golden Mean\\" with Shorter quoting directly from \\"Manteca\\" over an insistent vamp, and perhaps best of all, the 23 minute wonderfully-arranged \\"Pegasus\\" with The IMani Winds as an integral part of the Los Angeles proceedings, plus an out-of-this-world \\"Flying Down to Rio\\", with heroic Perez pianism, from the European tour is flat out amazing. At age 79, Wayne Shorter is at the height of his musical powers and still pushing the envelope 2 decades into the 21st Century with this exceptional group here playing classics and 6 new compositions and it gets My Highest Recommendation. \\"I dare you\\", indeed! Five EXCELLENT Stars. (9 tracks; 77 minutes:27 seconds. Based strongly on this recording and live performances, seven months after this review, Wayne Shorter and group won 4 first-place awards in the 2013 DownBeat International Jazz Critics Poll: Jazz Artist, Soprano Sax, Jazz Group, and Jazz Album. Then he took the Grammy for jazz solo: \\"Orbits\\")
0679809015|5.0|My little boy loves this book.  I bought it for him when he was about a year old and every once in a while he still picks it off of his bookshelf, even at three years old.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was looking for something to read after the Fifty Shades series, and came across this one.  I really like the characters and there pasts.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|nice to have, not as good as website tho, but could you expect any less?.. deffently use it when I dont want to use the browser, plus they give away free apps
B00846REIS|5.0|I liked this book and also the second one. I hope a 3rd is coming to purchase and read.  I love the hot scenes in it.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|I have several knife makers that I follow and this style tends to be the trend now, but I really like it. The blade is thick and heavy but this speaks to me of a knife that is ready for anything around the camp, or other things. I could not give it five stars because of one design issue. The blade is beveled more like an axe, and while that may prolong its durability, it is a bugger to sharpen. I actually had to file the bevel down to get a decent edge on it. Now that was my choice but I could not tolerate it as it was. I saw the reviews of the knife and went hunting for it and no one had any. I was surprised at how quickly this arrived.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like playing cards while waiting for my son at sports practice or sitting in a drs office to pass the time.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Really held my attention. I could hardly put it down. I enjoyed the fact that it not only focused on Lincoln but all those individuals that played an important part in his administration and their families. I came away with a real sense of the times in which Lincoln lived and an interesting look at his personality and political skills.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I figured out the ending pretty quickly but the book did keep me reading late into the night.  I have only found one of his books that I didn't like. I am a big fan of John Grisham books.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I think this game is totally awesome I can't do anything without it. so till me you love it right. if you  don't like it I hate you.
0525953728|5.0|I don't usually read a lot of non-fiction, but I could not put this book down.  Well written, incredibly interesting and entertaining.  I can not recommend this book highly enough.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like this game. it puts me in a good mood when I train with my horse! this game is just so fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I live this game!My favorite thing is the tasks. It cures boredom.I Can not believe  it was free. Great deal!
B009439HEY|3.0|Genesis is one of my all time favorite bands (quite possible, my favorite one). I have also purchased several of Steve Hackett's solo albums. It seems that whenever a member of a particular group...any group, releases a solo work, it is NEVER up to par with anything that was released by the GROUP. I have found this to true whenever and by whoever does this. This also includes Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins and Michael Rutherford, all of whom have released albums that could never compare to anything they did with Genesis.<br />Just think where they would be had each of them started out individually, rather than as members of the group, Genesis.<br />After reading such glowing reviews here about Genesis Revisited II, I purchased the cd. And I am listening to it as I write this review.<br />Is Mr. Hackett running out of ideas musically?  Some of the songs faithfully reproduce the music of the original songs. The vocals, however are never up to par to Gabriel or Collins. And the majestic \\"Supper's Ready\\" was a real disappointment on this cd.<br />I much prefer the original works by Genesis.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I  would give this book a 4 star rating and I recommend this book to all of the other people like you
B000VAPZM2|4.0|I purchased this item at my grandaughter's request. She loves it. I would purchase future items. I rate it 4 stars. High School Musical 2.
0765325950|5.0|wonderful book meets everything i waited for i wish the book never ended.<br />lets hope for the best and maybe Brandon will continue this title.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The book was awesome and just when you thought it was getting a little too weird it becomes something great :)
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I loved this app till the day it decided to delete all my progress and go back 2 demo mode please fix it.
B004LWZW9C|3.0|What made this movie enjoyable for me was that Josh Duhamel was in it. If it had not been for him being in this movie I would give it 2 1/2 stars. His story was the only one I cared to watch and wondering which woman he was going to meet til the end.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Slightly gripping at times but poor characters and very disappointing ending. Probably would be enjoyed by someone looking for easy non-challenging read.
044654759X|5.0|Ok I bought this book after seeing the previews of the upcoming movie Safe haven February 14, 2013. And I enjoyed the story. My sister liked it as well.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It was an enjoyable game, especially for being so cheap. Definitely the most in-depth hidden object game i have ever played.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|I really enjoyed the game, yes it was a pain to download but with a little patience I got it. The additional chapter was free so the game still only cost me 99&cent; well worth it.
1451627297|5.0|Could not put it down!  Make sure you have a week to devote to this book!  It is amazing and a great read!
B003XURDAY|3.0|I bought a lot of go hastings DVD`s but this one was the worst of the lot.With all these interuptions the show was a turn off completely...bb
B008NW67E0|5.0|Love them! Love them! Love them!  The album is great and you will not be disappointed- Broken Crown is a fave!
030758836X|5.0|Gone girl is an excellent read I recommend it to anyone who's newly engaged or who is a newlywed. No matter how much you think you know your partner the assumption can be wrong.
B005CGI4EG|4.0|It is the complete collection- great show!  Only down side is that the entire seasons are two rows of DVD's stacked on top of each other- scratches are inevitable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book! I highly recommend reading it, but not right before going to sleep...it makes you think and really stays with you.
0756686970|5.0|My 5 year old got this and he has read at least two pages every night- full of detail and fantastic pictures- it's a Lego fans dream!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I am enjoying my case for the Kindle Fire.  It lets me set it up so the Kindle is propped up or I can just fold the cover back and then use the Kindle.  It is attractive and appears to be well made.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|~ I love this movie and was so happy to find it on here!  Great packaging and swift service. ~
B004X6PRO6|4.0|I liked this book and found it fascinating to learn about North Korea but hard to believe some of the things that are described still happen to people in this day and age.  It is a very sad story.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by what these books had to offer. They of course have great appeal to the young adult audience as they will relate to the struggles everyone has as they learn who they are and how it fits into where they come from. I loved the relationships between the characters and how much history and culture are woven into the story. A magical and sometimes heart pounding story of young people who learn that the world isn't always black and white, and just because they don't fit into a mold doesn't mean they don't have an important place in the world. Fun, imaginitive and fast read.
1938895002|5.0|I did something that I usually don't do when it comes to diet and exercise, I followed someone else's advise. Word for word, tip for tip, I did exactly what Michael Matthews preached in this book. Wouldn't you know it, it worked. I mean IT WORKED. I began to receive compliments on my gains in a matter of a month or so, and I noticed my strength was finally improving to what it used to be when I played high school football a few years ago. Keep in mind, I am now 206 pounds lifting the same amount of weight as my lineman-built body a few years back at 235 pounds. I am also surprised to see that I kept some form of abs as well. Granted, my goal was to bulk and so it is impossible to do so without gaining some small amount of fat. However, Matthew's advise on nutrition and its precise nature truly helped me to eliminate my empty calories and ensure that every single thing I ate was contributing to my goals. I thank Michael for finally helping me to finding the quickest way to a bigger, leaner, stronger me.
1595141979|5.0|Again the story continues where the last one stopped. All the same characters are back.<br /><br />Thankfully, the romance has finally increased a little. I finally felt some real emotion from Dimitri, which was exciting and perfect and worth the wait. There was even a pretty nice, very clean, romantic scene between the two of them!<br /><br />Mason even showed his pretty, pale face for a shirt time, but who knows if it's because Rose is crazy or what... Adrian was  back again, as  I had expected. Though she didn't hardly show him the time of day! I still think he is growing on me though.<br />Basically the story was about the novices going through their field experience training. It was cool to see how they handled it, especially the few who had seen strigoi before. (Rose, Mia, Eddie) It was good to see how they would be expected to live their lives on an everyday basis. Kinda sucked to be a dhympir.<br /><br />Also, some (moroi and dhympir alike) are starting to fight for the ability to let the Moroi fight (with their magic) alongside the dhympirs. This was a kinda a big thing at the beginning  of the book, then it wasn't for a while,  then was again.  Im hoping in the next book, there will be some change.<br /><br />Then  towards the end, some strigoi attack and all hell breaks loose. Some die... even someone kinda important. And  it was sad... but I kinda feel like somehow that person will come back... I don't know.<br /><br />Also, we got to see the crazxy queen for a little while again. Which was disconcerting, as she doesn like Rose, and has some crazy big plans for Lissa (which don't include Christian) so... I also feel we'll be seeing more of her in the next book.<br /><br />Overall, more romance and more action make this the best book in the series so far.<br />review by: theresamjones.com
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is an amazing game. Somewhat like temple run but way better. With twists and turns this game has you off your seat. When you get caught you want to it again and again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this game its really fun to play. The only thing I don't like is that its not able to be played offline with no wifi. If u can play it without wifi then ur lucky cuz I cant.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I LOVE this game but I think you should have more versions and it should be an option for which version you want to play
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the back in forth communication between the characters. Can see he was very intrigued with how she is different than his previous girlfriends. I believe he is slowly realizing he could actually fall in love with her as a person to settle down and spend his life with.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it can be quite addicting!I love the rio version the nyc editition was allright it is a wonderful game
B007PM218K|2.0|Although this item was rated as ''good as new&#34; in fact several of the CDs were so damaged that they could not be listened to.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|$4.99 for a game that I can't finish!!!!!  The game will not load on chapter 4! It kicks you off completely at that point!  I was really enjoying this game.  I Love G5 games but will not be buying any more!!! I'M SAD!!!!

B004XDYJRU|5.0|We are really enjoying the endless choices of music on our Kindle!  We are living out of the country for the winter and this is the perfect way to hear the music that you like anywhere in the world.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's  is an  amazing game I would recommend this game to every one across the world it rocks. If you don't believe me try it out your self because there is absolutely no problem with the game
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is just a beautiful portrayal of life outside London in the 20s. I am struck by the grace and honor in the midst of difficulty and treachery.
1479189154|5.0|This was an excellent choice. I'm currently taking Finance in college and covered Keynesian economics extensively. His theory has dominated government economics for half a century now....and it's no surprise why we are in debt to the extent that we are. Keynes believed direct fiscal intervention was necessary to get a sluggish economy moving back towards full employment. Government basically sees this as a 'blank check'  'Lord Keynes' was a great thinker and I'm sure had the betterment of society as his focus. Governments have greatly distorted his model; Keynesian economics in modernity translates to nothing more than the irresponsible use tax-payer dollars by the government......<br />Keynes is such an intellect that it may appear difficult to stay abreast of his concepts. A firm handle on language is necessary for beneficial reading of this book.
B001P06GX4|4.0|I liked this game, BUT, we bought this game to take with us on our cruise to play with our friends.  We found this game to be more intense and on the more serious side like chess, rather than a game that is fun and full of laughs.
0060872675|5.0|Really enjoyable a twist to the childrens book and as i have said the artwork is amazing a worthy additions to anyone's shelf
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Best three dollars I may ever spend. It was a very easy read and motivated me to keep pressing forward.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|With Kindle offering me crazy books everyday, i am buying odd things, willynilly.  This book is a treasure, a real find.  I had to go back and read the reviews here after finishing reading the kindle version of the book.  Inexplicably fantastic, in both senses of the word.  Only criticism, as noted elsewhere by Kindle readers, is that the photographs do not render very well.  Reminds me more of Terry Prachett's Wee Free Men series than of Harry Potter.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I have been a Josh Groban fan for many years.  He just keeps getting better.  This CD is amazing.  From beginning to end, he can't go wrong.  If you buy one, I suggest you get the version at Target that has the 4 additional tracks.  I loved Satellite & of course, Grazie (Italian).  They are all great.  Brave was definitely the way to go for the first single. Keep up the great work, Josh!  I'll see ya out there sometime this year, if you are in the US.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The plot is interesting and well written and the actors are superb. I'm on the edge of<br />my seat from week to week!
B008XCPO2Q|4.0|I bought this movie for my girlfriend.  I've never watched the movie, but she seems to like it just fine.  Loses a star because now she asks me to do strip teases for her and I suspect that this film is the cause.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Take a little Nanny McPhee, throw in a dash of X-Men and add a sprinkle of Sliders and you get Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.  My first gripe with the book is what a lot of people like: the pictures.  I disliked them.  It pulled me out of the story instead of enhancing it.  It's impressive that the pictures came first and the story was built around them, but I found them distracting.  My second gripe is that it was basically a book version of a TV pilot.  The ideas were thrown out, but nothing was resolved.  The second half of the book was just the setup for the sequel.  You could see it coming a mile away.<br /><br />Now, with that out of the way, are there interesting characters here?  Yes.  Do I want to know where the story goes?  Yes.  I like what has been started and would love to see it grow into its own thing.  However, the execution of the story and the way the carrot was dangled turned me off.  The sequel isn't due until 2014 so I'll either let time wash away the things I didn't like and still read it or I'll forget about the Peculiars altogether.  Only time will tell.
B004WR125O|5.0|I purchased to pair with the Onkyo TX-NR515 A/V Receiver.  It works exactly as advertised and I haven't had any problems streaming any of the apps or downloading firmware updates thus far.  I use it mostly to stream Pandora through the receiver.
B009LHFYNG|5.0|This is the bible of Neuroscience - worth its weight in gold!<br />The depth to which Kandel et al go into the biochemistry all the way up to theory of mind is awe inspiring!<br />I recommend it to professionals and laymen alike.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book was informative and again reinforces the professionalism of these warrior patriots. The author's candid opinions of politics are not overwhelming but are welcomed. May the Seals continue to act on behalf of the USA in the anonymous way that they do. Great book.
B007NZDES0|5.0|I saw her in concert last year and it was the most fabulous concert I have ever been to. Watched this video and it is just as fabulous ;)

B00683JK9K|5.0|I have not had any problems on my fire with this app.<br />No missing pieces.  Very pretty puzzles.  I will try other puzzle apps by this co.
B0058YPL66|5.0|However; not for children under 8-9 years old. Some adult &#34;subjects&#34; (I think) are pretty intense. the story lines are really good and the graphics are GREAT!!!
B005LAJ212|2.0|The show started of surprisingly strong in the first few episodes.<br />Of course you have some of the typical ABC E.S.o.B. (empty shells of beauty) actors / cast......., but clearly a positiv standout for the network.<br />Unfortunately around episode 18 it turns into one of the usual boring,<br />childish shows we are supposed to watch nowadays. So I didn`t even finish it!<br /><br />Had the show been made with a smarter, more deliberate plot (perhaps for only one season) at a cable channel (therefore with better actors) it could have been one of the best shows in recent years.
B007MAETA8|3.0|I love every john mayer CD but this one let me down. I hope next CD is better. Too bluesy
B009POCG5Y|5.0|Trouble with the curve was one of the best Eastwood films I have seen in a long time . It was a movie that had its slow points in the middle but it developed the relationship between a father and  daughter. It really showed the strength that a daughter can count on her advise from a father on what it takes to pick up on what it means to hit a curve ball. I was glad to see Justin Timberlake and Amy Adams get together .....The other movie in which Eastwood should have been Nominated for an Acadmy award is Gran Torino.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is pretty fun! I totally recommended this game...you can also shook up with Facebook friends and beat their high score!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really enjoy this game...it helps pass the time and its easy for my cousins to play. I would like to see more games were u can learn the value of having an animal to care for.
B0006IEVFG|1.0|This model has a chronic problem where it resets to 12:00:00 1/1/2000 repeatedly. This seems to happen with every single watch. I've had mine replaced by Casio, now the replacement watch is resetting every day but I am now 1 month out of warranty so I'm stuck with it.<br /><br />Do not buy. :(
0739337270|5.0|Very much enjoyed the story and liked the production.  The reader does a great job as the narrator and the characters.  A must read.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|if you like their other games you will enjoy this one.  it was very entertaining and a pretty good story line.
B00942S4OY|5.0|Its a CD.  My daughter is obsessed with One Direction and thinks this is their best CD!  Don't know what else to say.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Contemporary lit that explores the horrors of mid-twentieth century Irish orphanages, while offering a fun and mixed up romance attempt. Complex and very simple characters. A good read.
B008ELUEQC|2.0|I too am somewhat unhappy with Rod's voice. I love Michael Buble though and the duet with Rod and Michael isn't too bad. Rod's voice isn't what it used to be though and this CD just doesn't do anything for me. Not recommended.
B00004YW6I|5.0|From the early 90s to now, PJ Harvey is supremely gifted as a song writer, vocalist, and guitar playing rocker.  I love her early work from the 90s, her early 2000s work, and now her 2011 album LET ENGLAND SHAKE.<br /><br />She is matched only by Chrissy Hynde of the Pretenders, Annie Lennox, and Hole from first two albums around 1994/1998.  PJ is still going strong and wicked wild.
B004GYY714|5.0|I use this app every day. We are moving and everything is almost packed, so I have this app to use on my kindle fire, which I have near me at all times
B00170I7GG|5.0|I have seen this a dozen times, but I will still watch it next year.  It is one of the best movies ever!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I get so angry when I miss one stupor little green thing, but with that said I love and am very hooked
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was a fast yet emotional read.  The character development was amazing.  There were so many stereotyped yet unique high school students.  There were many moments of reflection back to my personal high school experience that make you think about how acceptance is such a struggle.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Loved this game way back when, but this one can't keep up with my finger, but still like and play it
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas Sparks never seems to disappoint me when it comes to his romance novels.  There are perpetual themes within his writings but each story draws me in to its tragedy and hopelessly romantic events.  READ it and see the movie but always remember the book is better.
B006YC74E8|4.0|I haven't had the chance to use this app very much yet, but what I have seen/used, I like very much.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This novel has me on edge while reading.  It was not predictable which made it a fantastic read.  All conflicts were well thought out and thrilling to unwind.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am disabled and the time I spend confined to bed is passed with many games of solitaire. Love this game
B00AH8U3UC|5.0|I find this show fascinating, and at times depressing.  I just got around to watching season 5, and there have been changes in the lives of the characters.  Looking forward to finishing it!
B009PDO946|5.0|This is one of the long series of New Year's Day concerts from Vienna and features the conducting of Franz Welser-Most for the second time. This may not come as too much of a surprise as Welser-Most's Viennese credentials have been recognised and supported by a major bank in Upper Austria for over 25 years as a cultural envoy for upper Austria. This level of commitment to Welser-Most is more than justified by this particular release.<br /><br />There is an unusual number of first performances in this year's concert, partly to do with the 2013 anniversary celebrations of Wagner and Verdi's bicentenaries. As a result we hear Wagner's Lohengrin Prelude to Act 3 and Verdi's Act 3 ballet music from Don Carlo. In addition there are other references such as J. Strauss II's Melodies Quadrille based on Verdian themes.<br /><br />Another emphasis in this year's concert is the music of Josef Strauss with seven of his works of which five receive d&eacute;but performances at these concerts. His popular Music of the Spheres waltz is included and is a reminder of his own qualities as a composer of Viennese music. One extra link with Josef Strauss was the presence of his great-granddaughter whose 90th birthday took place the previous July and who was briefly identified on film, clearly enjoying the concert.<br /><br />Hellmesberger II and Lanner, both important figures in the Viennese musical world, are included too and the concert includes Suppe's Light Cavalry overture, last heard here in a gripping performance with Muti very much in charge. Welser-Most takes a more genial view which fits in with his whole approach to the concert.<br /><br />Geniality is a strong feature of the Carnival of Venice Fantasy by J. Strauss I which allows individual members and sections of the orchestra to be highlighted as the piece progresses. Once again, this is not the first time it has been played in recent memory with the last performance being conducted by Pretre in 2010. On this occasion each of the highlighted members receives a gift, mostly in the form of a soft toy which goes down very well with the audience and the orchestra. Welser-Most is presented with a chef's hat as befits his role as chief chef.<br /><br />The concert then rapidly reaches the end with the traditional New year's greeting, the Blue Danube and the Radetzky March which is started with a particularly energetic and enthusiastic side-drummer. The audience clap very well and show considerable appreciation at the end.<br /><br />The camera work has some remarkable shots from high up and which make use of phenomenal zoom capabilities of the lenses to cover all sorts of angles and views within the hall. This avoids rapid changes of cameras and inter-cutting and is a considerable technical advance. The imaging is especially crisp and with excellent colour. Attractive and short sequences of Austrian images are cut into the footage of the concert during some items. The sound is of an equally high standard and is presented in DTS 5.1 surround and stereo.<br /><br />There are several bonuses including the ballet sequences which follow the usual pattern of mini-stories of dance-based romantic situations. There is also the option to watch the concert items previously shown with Austrian images seen as by the audience and therefore without the Austrian scenes. There is also a 24 minute feature called 'Honeymoon' which follows a newly married couple, attractively acted, touring round various Austrian venues. This is really a travelogue set to music largely played by sub-groups from the orchestra. All the venues, the music and the performers are sub-titled which makes the film far more informative than some previous films of this type. Once more, the photography is outstanding both artistically and technically.<br /><br />I would suggest that this disc continues the fine standards of previous issues and surpasses some. As such it deserves to be considered seriously both as an 'only' purchase or oneof a sequence for committed collectors.equence for committed collectors.<br /><br />........................................<br /><br />Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:<br /><br />Another Excellent Review! (U.K. review)<br /><br />I thought that you might like to know that before I buy a recording I now look through all the reviews to see if you have posted one. Your assessments and opinions are invaluable. Thank you. (US review)<br /><br />I particularly like your format of review. They give the prospective purchaser an idea of the style of the playing and relevant comparisons. They are succinct. Keep up the good work! (UK review)<br /><br />I'm sure there are many other serious collectors, besides myself, who wait for your synopsis and opinion before spending their hard-earned money on new releases...<br />Keep up the good work!<br />Thank you  (UK review)<br /><br />............................................

B008ASGP3U|4.0|Rebus is back, and that's a good thing. A lot of themes are started that aren't closed out, and you have to think that means there's at least one more Rebus book coming to address those, and that's also a good thing. If you like Rebus, this is worth a read.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The Fall of Giants was a fabulous story, strong characters and I can't wait to start the second book which I plan to do almost immediately..
1400052181|5.0|I could not put this book down, I read it several times, this is a big book and I say up all night and read this book. What a page turner. What a sad story.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I like every story Jodi Picoult writes because they are full bodied and I get swept away in the lives of the people she writes about.  I become part of the story and breezed through her books and want to pick up the next one.
0765325950|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the Wheel of Time series and this book is right up there with the whole thing.  I can't seem to put it down.
B00683JK9K|4.0|This puzzle set contains gorgeous photographs. I was getting frustrated with the seemingly poor response to touch until I discovered hint #1 below. There are a couple of other tips that hopefully will be of help to someone else.<br />1  Don't drag puzzle pieces from the scroll bar; tap them and then place them. To put them back in the scroll bar, drag them.<br />2) There are two modes of play. One is with all puzzle pieces right side up. In this mode, pieces cannot be rotated. The other is with \\"Rotate pieces\\" enabled. The button that enables rotation is to the immediate left of the START button.<br />3) The puzzle did not lose any pieces for me. However, they may be covered up when the partially assembled puzzle is accidentally dragged.<br />This is not the most intuitive puzzle game, and definitely should be made more user friendly. Nevertheless, I ended up enjoying it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The 1st book made me want to know what came next. This second book in the series made me enjoy the ride;)
B005DOKM9M|5.0|This zip sleeve fits perfectly the Kindle Fire.  Form fitting and easily accessible for the Kindle Fire.  The sleeve is also durable.
B0074V3712|4.0|Very interesting.....Will want to read more of his thought provoking material. Recommended to anyone looking for deeper truths about why we are, the way we are
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I downloaded it for the grandson and he said it was much better than the first temple run! As long as he likes it, I'm good with it.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|I skipped this movie when it was released in the theatres.  The whole premise of a comedy revolving around bird watching just sounded dull.  But I ended up renting The Big Year from Netflix and discovered it was fun and entertaining.<br /><br />You can read the plot summary for yourself on Amazon. The movie really isn't about bird watching, but rather is about how each of the three main characters, Jack Black, Owen Wilson and Steve Martin, manage a crossroad in their lives while competing in \\"The Big Year\\", birding's equivalent of the Super Bowl. Many high jinks unfold as do spectacular outdoor backdrops as the three crisscross the country in search of elusive sightings of birds like the Pink Footed Goose and the Snowy Owl.  Although a comedy, the movie has its tender moments as each character wrestles with how their obsessive \\"hobby\\" has caused hardship and loneliness for those closest to them.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|verry fun you have to think a bit.about the path you choose.can be very adictive but still a fun game to play.
B00633W614|4.0|sequel to &#34;onlly Time will tell. I wanted to follow the characters .I found it very interesting Will probably read the next book about these people if there is one.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I'm addicted to Pinterest!  This was a little tricky for me to learn how to navigate at first.  But it works great and I've teamed it with my Chef App, so now if I find a great recipe on Pinterest I can download it onto my Chef app and bring it up to use in t kitchen or at the camper, whenever I want.  Anyone who uses Pinterest should download this app to their Kindle!
1616550414|5.0|This book is magical. It is so cool to look at the original concepts and character designs. I totally went ballistic when first opening the book. Yeah it's that cool. If you are a Zelda fan I highly suggest getting this book. It will be like a dream come true.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Anyone who knows anything about movies knows this is what you must have. The entire series of a classic series. Great quality video.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|The game gliches a lot but I do enjoy it still. Just wish it would have been done a little better so there wasn't that glichy-ness
B000VMFDW2|5.0|A great read.. really intense story.  Would highly recommend, ended up buying this for a co-worker.  If you enjoyed The Pacific this is a must read.
B000JQU1VS|1.0|I never received this book so therefore I cannot review it.  I don't know what else to say except I didn't get it.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Didn't think Band of Brothers could be topped or equaled in any way but they deffinetly did it.  Very intense
B008KGPEQG|5.0|I enjoyed every page of this book. What insight and perception! Thanks to this read I have already bought more Auster for my Kindle.
0552998877|5.0|This was purchased for my daughter...I guess she likes it as I haven't heard anything to refute that.  It's a book.
0143116738|4.0|I Received my  book on time and  that can be very important when buying a book for school .  :)
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Really good sequel to the Meade runner it was one of the best books I ever read. Super interesting and detailed
B008YFALF2|4.0|Hello, I'm a high school student in southern California and chose to do a project on this book and all I have to say about it is \\"wonderful.\\"<br />This book takes place in 1945 and the years beyond it to explain the personal story of six individuals and their grappling with the atomic bomb going in their town. The book is a great story about human kindness showing in the most darkest of times and also a spiritual journey and how hard it is for some people to keep living their lives by their old standards after an event like this happens. It is, to me, a book that everybody should read at least once in their lives.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Wonderful game that id low tech and relaxing. I find it easy to lose track of time; nut I do not get lost. Great game to play.
B005K2YTG4|5.0|I was looking for a simple envelope sleeve that I could store my kindle in while not reading it and this is a fantastic case.  My kindle is well protected while stored inside it and as I do not like to read my kindle in a case this is the perfect choice for me!!
0812981448|5.0|I bought one for myself and several others as Christmas gifts. A book that won't go in the recycle bin. Easy, inspiring read!
B000UAFDP2|1.0|This blue ray dvd is dysfuntional we tried viewing it in 5 different high quality blue ray players and it will not play it tries for about 5 secs then shuts down! And its a great movie but the disc is junk! VERY DISAPPOINTED!
B002UM5BXW|4.0|After seeing numerous episodes of Bourdain's various television shows / specials I had to read this book. If you've heard him talk, this book will read exactly like you would expect. Easy read and very entertaining.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The book could've been more interested. I think the story got quite a bit duller in the last book.<br />Still finished it, but wish the plot was better.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I've been a fan of Evernote for a number of years now, and see nothing diminishing that fact on the Kindle Fire HD iteration of the app. While I wish that it could do images inline, handled nested lists better, and offered the ability to insert hyperlinks into the text, everything else seems to be doing quite well.<br /><br />Compared to the iterations on my iPad (1st gen), I'm not getting the crashes, and consistently get better performance. That might speak to the difference between platforms, or just that I've got newer hardware on the KF-HD.<br /><br />Skitch integration has been neat to behold, but its not as big of an item as some would make it. Given the easy ability within Android to share between apps, its just easy to duplicate that feature ability. I would like to see Penultimate's inking come in, because usually I'm not trying to type, and would gladly use the handwriting mode to just scribble everything from ideas, to notes, to diagrams.<br /><br />Overall, there's always room for improvement, but I'm pleased.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is AWESOME!get it....right now! I love it the person who made this equals cool. Buy today and rate
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game. I like the characters and it is easy enough to play but challenging enough to make you want to come back for more.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|All in all it's not bad considering it's a new Kiss CD. I did not care for the mix of the CD though, you go past a certain volume and everything becomes very unclear and distorted (and that my friends is a bad mix not to loud of volume( I AM A RECORDING ENGINEER IN A RECORDING STUDIO) everything is bunched together vocal and instruments and not singled out like most CD's. Psycho Circus has the best sound for a KISS CD in a long time! But the songs are true KISS and unfortunately are very good but at low volume!!!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This app has great graphics &amp; lots of new obsticles. I would have given it a 5, but it randomly exits the game when you use the Save Me feature when you die. When it does this you lose EVERYTHING you earned in that game. I will be deleting this game from my device.-
B0042J6VUS|3.0|Use with Samsung Charge, a thicker phone.<br /><br />Fits quite well, decent design, especially with the bundled tripod.<br /><br />But the expandable back/clamp is weak, buckles with the Charge; and may break anytime, probably not more than five times of use.<br /><br />The tripod screw hole has a good cushioned seat, a good fit with the bundled tripod; but the seat makes it too thick for the adapter to be used with another tripod with a shorter screw.<br /><br />Product fitting the price.<br /><br />I'm glad I also simultaneously ordered a higher-priced and better quality item.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This is an amazing read. It will keep you guessing till the last page. I haven't read a book by Patricia Cornwell that I haven't enjoyed.

0307743659|5.0|\\"He would make her take her medicine. Every drop. Every last bitter drop.\\"  Chills.<br /><br />Jack Torrance is a husband and father.  After being fired from his job as a teacher, he accepts a caretaker position at the Overlook Hotel.  He and his family will watch out for the place during the off-season.  Because of the winter weather, they know that they may be stranded there for weeks at a time.  This will give them all a chance to be together and also allow Jack to write the next great novel.  The hotel and its' permanent inhabitants have a different idea.<br /><br />The Shining is a frightening book.  Yes, it's scary because of all the paranormal things that happen with the hotel's ghosts.  More than that, it's scary because of Jack.  He wants to be a good man, husband, father, writer, etc.  But, you see, Jack has some anger management issues.  He was fired from his job as a teacher because of an altercation with a student.  He broke his son's arm in anger.  Jack is `ripe for the picking' as the one to do the dirty work for the ghosts.<br /><br />The Shining is also sad.  You could feel Jack's struggle.  He doesn't want to hurt anyone but his demons won't allow him to live a normal life.  One of his demons is alcohol.  Most of us know someone who is a different person when drinking.  Jack is that person.<br /><br />Danny, Jack's son, has some special powers.  He has \\"the shining\\" or ability to talk with others with his mind.  He can also see what others are thinking and in some cases, what is about to happen.<br /><br />Wendy is Danny's mother and turns out to be one tough mother!  I much prefered her in the book versus the movie.<br /><br />Almost every other character is compelling - Mr. Ullman, Hallorann and so on.<br /><br />The Shining is a favorite and 5/5 stars.  Stephen King is now writing a sequel with Danny as the MC.  I cannot wait.

B0083ZRAJS|3.0|When I downloaded the e-book of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, I was feeling nostalgic. Memories of the times with my sister in our den while growing up were clouding my judgement. We watched this movie at least once per year (my sister does a pretty spot-on Glenda impersonation and I can do some of the Munchkin songs pretty well myself.) Unfortunately, this is one of the rare cases where I prefer the movie to the book. To be fair, I know every scene of the movie and all of the differences really bothered me. For example, the physical description of Glenda, the color of the shoes (?!?) and so on.<br /><br />The Flying Monkeys really aren't bad guys in the book either (and, yes, they scared us to death when we were kids.) The Wicked Witch just had control over them for a few commands. They didn't really work for her as they do in the film.<br /><br />I do have to give some credit to L. Frank Baum. He created the framework of a story and a world that become such an important part of American cinema. I just think the filmmakers took it to the next level and created MAGIC.<br /><br />3/5 stars.

0307341577|4.0|Since I had never read a Gillian Flynn novel, I decided to get my first one from the library (why spend the money if it may not be one you want to re-read.)  I was very glad that I made that decision.  While I appreciate the writing and the storytelling (hence the 4/5 stars I gave Dark Places), I will never re-read this book.  I think one of my Goodreads status updates says it best - \\"This book is making my heart hurt. It's a bit depressing.\\"<br /><br />Here is the synopsis from Amazon: \\"I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ.  Libby Day was seven when her mother and two sisters were murdered in \\"The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee, Kansas.\\" As her family lay dying, little Libby fled their tiny farmhouse into the freezing January snow. She lost some fingers and toes, but she survived-and famously testified that her fifteen-year-old brother, Ben, was the killer. Twenty-five years later, Ben its in prison, and troubled Libby lives off the dregs of a trust created by well-wishers who've long forgotten her. The Kill Club is a macabre secret society obsessed with notorious crimes. When they locate Libby and pump her or details-proof they hope may free Ben-Libby hatches a plan to profit off her tragic history. For a fee, she'll reconnect with the players from that night and report her findings to the club...and maybe she'll admit her testimony wasn't so solid after all. As Libby's search takes her from shabby Missouri strip clubs to abandoned Oklahoma tourist towns, the narrative flashes back to January 2, 1985. The events of that day are relayed through the eyes of Libby's doomed family members-including Ben, a loner whose rage over his shiftless father and their failing farm have driven him into a disturbing friendship with the new girl in town. Piece by piece, the unimaginable truth emerges, and Libby finds herself right back where she started-on the run from a killer.\\"<br /><br />So...here's the deal - I didn't care for one single character in Dark Places.  All ofthem are just unlikable and not good people.  You would think that the flashback scenes showing Libby's mother and two younger sisters would at least give me someone to pull for (even if you know they're going to die.)  But, her mother was weak.  You have to read the book to find out how weak but it's disgusting to me personally.  I don't have kids but NO WAY would I do that to my family.  And, her sisters were pretty much brats.  That didn't make any of them deserve to die but they were just hard to like.  Libby, our MC, is not a good person.  She steals, lies and makes money off the horrible things that happened to her family.  The club members were disturbing to me.  Some of the women seemed to be prison groupies for Libby's brother.<br /><br />The conclusion of the murder mystery was well conceived and written.  But, again, it just made me sad.  So many bad decisions by all involved.  Ugh...<br /><br />I may read another Gillian Flynn novel.  She has a talent for storytelling.  I saw an interview with her where she was asked about these awful stories she writes and how she separates herself to try to have a normal life with her family.  She said that she writes in the basement and leaves her `crazy' down there.  I hope she can continue to do that for her family's sake.  Whew.<br /><br />4/5 stars but I can't say it was an enjoyable read.
0439023491|5.0|The movie buzz is what got me interested in the series, but I wanted to read the books as soon as possible. I read them the first time a few weeks after seeing the movie and read them the second tiem several months later. I read Catching Fire before I read the first book and totally was able to follow it based off of the first movie.<br /><br />The library I went to had the Catching Fire UK edition paperback. Took me by surprise, maybe that's what they could find, but a printed copy in English was all I was looking for. It was indeed in British English. I wondered how much of a distraction that would be, but it turned out to be no big deal - I glossed over the alternate spellings, and understood the metric well enough.<br /><br />I wondered why Collins caught right to Victory Tour prep. She did skip/gloss over some dead time. I noticed there was a flashback on page 29. I noticed exposition of regular D12 life by way of saying what had changed since the win. I did see Katniss rebuilding her relationship with Mom post-Games which I figured would happen.<br /><br />A 9 year old girl in D11 was mentioned as one of Rue's little sisters, one of the little canon details I like to pay attention to. Also, Thresh's grandma was mentioned and his parents weren't, which lead me to assume the parents were dead.<br /><br />I noticed Gale's stolen kiss and the ILY were separate; the latter is where things really start to go south for his relationship with Katniss. I already thought that not rebelling might have been safer, but I hadn't remembered Katniss using that logic or it being part of the argument with Gale. I had been confused about choosing Gale versus choosing rebellion, perhaps not seeing the rebelliousness in Peeta.<br /><br />Why did Mrs. Everdeen complain about Katniss/Peeta at all? It seems hypocritical given her own past. Did she simply think they were too young? That seems to be the literal explanation. Did she think Gale was Katniss' true love?<br /><br />I was losing some sympathy for Gale; it felt like softening in my attitude towards Peeta was betraying what I had thought about Gale. Darn it, I think Mrs. Everdeen had a point about Peeta `being the very model of what a young man should be'.<br /><br />Part of me felt Gale's whipping and Thread's other harsh enforcement was the District 12 criminals finally getting what they deserved; the light law enforcement before that had seemed like a plot hole.<br /><br />The post-whipping kiss wasn't as dramatic as I remembered the first time. The Gale choice seeming hollow reminded me of something Everlark shippers insisted. Was Katniss denying a relationship with Gale about him in particular, relationships in general, or about saying she really wanted Peeta? The word `opiates' on page 144 seemed to confirm the assumption that morphling is related to morphine.<br /><br />\\"I want X, but I'm going to pretend otherwise since I'm not supposed to want X\\" - Katniss thinking along these lines about really being in love with Peeta versus the Capitol act; I've certainly thought that way about other things.<br /><br />It was clear that Peeta really comforted her. I saw those as moments of weakness and lost respect for Katniss because I thought she was tougher than that. Working on the plant book together, and the train embrace, was so sweet.<br /><br />I remember the clever BS'ing of Peacekeepers when Katniss snuck back from the woods, but I hadn't remembered Haymitch and Peeta playing chess (p. 187). This seemed like strategy symbolism, but it also made a point about a bit of old culture that was still left in Panem. Similarly, page 355 mentions a New Year's Eve bell.<br /><br />Now that I remember it, there were no other Victors present on the Victory Tour.<br /><br />Peeta often strikes me as obnoxiously goody-goody, but he does get aggressive about stopping Haymitch's drinking as they train for the Games.<br /><br />I remember there being no good-byes before they left for the Games again,but this time I thought about why. An anti-Gale/Katniss plot device? The Capitol being gratuitously cartoonishly evil?<br /><br />Why would Maysilee commit suicide with three tributes left besides herself and Haymitch?<br /><br />Again with Katniss thinking she doesn't need any help!<br /><br />The private session stunts are interesting in adn of themselves and because they're connected to each other.<br /><br />The Katniss interview stunt seemed necessary as a sign there was no second-guessing.<br /><br />It was awhile into the book before they got back in the arena, but once that happened the book mostly just flowed through the Games action, which was great. The layout of the arena was really clever (in a devious Capitol way to be sure), as opposed to the relatively straightforward natural arena in the 1st book.<br /><br />It seems Finnick covers for Katniss by overacting about the false pregnancy announcement; does he know it's BS? When he saves Peeta, it's interesting that Collins doesn't call it CPR. I wondered why Finnick did it - in Mockingjay, he says he recognized Katniss' love for Peeta was real when seeing how she reacted to Peeta hitting the forcefield. I wondered when Katniss really fell for him, that she had at some point was now clear. Him brushing off getting shocked to death seemed quite badass; I thought that wasn't his style.<br /><br />The `hunger of a different kind' bit included a flashback to the cave scene. I'm inclined to mock Katniss for being so clueless about sex.<br /><br />There was a lot of foreshadowing of the rebellion and the arena's clock structure, which Katniss eventually realizes. Mentioning the trackers seemed like foreshadowing of Johanna removing Katniss'. There was some foreshadowing of the destruction of District 12 and Peeta's hijacking.but this time I thought about why.

1451627297|5.0|\\"Life turns on a dime.\\"  Wow...just...wow.  I went into 11/22/63 expecting to like it (Stephen King always delivers for me.)  But, this was really one of my favorite books in recent memory.<br /><br />Jake Epping is a teacher in Maine who is shown a bubble in time by one of his friendly acquaintances, Al.  Al is basically trying to recruit Jake to go back in time to stop Kennedy's assassination.  His belief is that this will have a ripple effect that saves millions of lives (including Martin Luther King, Jr., Bobby Kennedy and many American soldiers in Vietnam.)  If you step through this bubble, it always takes you to the same point in time in 1958.  Every time you go back, it's a complete reset.  Jake eventually decides to do this - live there from 1958-1963 and save Kennedy (and others along the way).<br /><br />As you can imagine, it's not simple.  The butterfly effect is mentioned throughout the novel - if you change one thing in history it can have many unintended consequences.  Both good and bad.<br /><br />It's always interesting to think about things in history or even in your own life that you might want to change.  But, we really don't know that these changes would make anything better.  It could mean that someone you love ends up dying or it could alter the course of world history.  Plus, the past is obdurate and doesn't want to be changed.<br /><br />11/22/63 gives you a roller coaster ride of emotions while talking about American history and human nature.  I simply loved it.  5/5 stars and highly recommended.
0439023513|5.0|The movie buzz is what got me interested in the series, but I wanted to read the books as soon as possible. I read them the first time a few weeks after seeing the movie and read them the second tiem several months later.<br /><br />This strong finish to the trilogy solidifies my overall positive opinion of the series.<br /><br />The book mostly flowed through the battle action until Prim's death. I was confused by the later action scenes, but thought that was somewhat appropriate to the chaos. The ending wasn't pretty, but that's what made it realistic. Katniss' Capitol mission seemed to get a lot of people killed for not much reason.<br /><br />I found the life of District 13 somewhat offputting - a harsh necessity, Coin's manipulations at work, or both?<br /><br />Katniss blaming herself was mixed with the pawn feeling, as opposed to those being separate concerns for her. To me, it simply seemed smart for Katniss to get personal guarantees in the Mockingjay deal.<br /><br />I was sad when Finnick died. I started to like him in Catching Fire, and more throughout Mockingjay, particularly when it was revealed that he was a forced prostitute instead of a playboy. I was amused when Finnick spilled Capitol secrets. I loved the Finnick-Annie wedding scene.<br /><br />I was angry when Prim died (and surprised when Katniss killed Coin with the arrow meant for Snow). Katniss voting for a new Games seemed odd. I like a fan theory that says she planned to kill Coin (I first thought it was impulsive), and voted for a new Games so that no one would suspect it. Was killing Coin about avenging Prim or avoiding Snow 2.0? Not only was she the darling little girl, she showed such a deep understanding of the situation earlier in the book.<br /><br />It is clear how much Katniss loved Peeta by this point. She did seem relatively preoccupied with him, given the overall situation. I figured hijacked Peeta would be a less attractive mate, so I had thought it was stupid for Katniss to stay with him, yet it only deepends her desire to keep him. It's clear Gale/Katniss grew further apart after he lied about Peeta's TV appearance; I had an unsure reaciton to their D2 scene. I noticed some hints of Gale/Johanna<br /><br />Why did Gale go on the rescue? For whose sake or for the rebellion in general? I noticed the return from the rescue was about halfway through the book, the Nut raid slightly after - interesting when thinking about how to split the movie.<br /><br />As for D2 before the Nut attack - ranting versus actually doing those angry things is quite different, which I really identified with. Speaking of that attack, interrupting the escape really seemed gratuitous.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins was painfully obvious in explaining the symbolism of Hanging Tree and Crazy Cat, a major criticism of her writing style.<br /><br />Details I found interesting:<br />The District Thirteen auditorium was called the Collective and rank was distinct from the `Soldier' title, it was a 45 minute flight there, `cell disintegrators' as a future but pre-Panem weapon<br /><br />The Capitol was trying to recapture District Thirteen instead of simply destroy it - that seems like a plausible tactical decision although it backfired.<br /><br />The intermediate train station stage in the Battle Of The Capitol<br /><br />Finnick and Prim, on the other hand:<br />Were the deaths necessary to make Collins' point about war?<br /><br />I wonder if Finnick was settling for Annie, perhaps because she's crazy, although less so than Peeta. Is still wanting her convincing enough? I dream of being that handsome and charming, and getting laid that much. He complains about living that dream, so I find it hard to sympathize with him. At worst, it seemed like illogical behavior in the name of romance, which I tend to be quite cynical about.<br /><br />Part of me thinks Prim's death was deserved for being softhearted enough to help enemy civilians that never would have cared about her; Ifigure Capitol citizens being callous about the Games started young.figure Capitol citizens being callous about the Games started young.
B005HSL626|3.0|For those who havent played the android and ipod versions pf fruit ninja, there are a ton of features that are missing from this version. Such as the pomegranate and online mode. Also, it looks as though they simply stretched the game to fit on the kindle. So it gives the game a fuzzy look to it. Once they update this app to fix these issues and give us what other fruit ninja players have, it will get my five stars.

B008MEM24S|1.0|It is just like Wheres my water...not happy with either one. grandson downloaded this by accident and he dont even like it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is very good but there are some flaws.I wish it would be easier to get characters. Also what is it with all the different types i mean i understand the Christmas one but really Rio N,Y, city really? And why does everything cost so much it is crazy. The screen quality is very good but sometimes especially right before i get a mystery box it shuts off. If you could fix that i tree would be great. Why do they have the 2x when it does like nothing i just jump over them.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The writing was spot on, and the acting was extraordinary!  This is a great series and I can't wait to see the 2nd season.
B0058VW36U|4.0|He graphics are good but the game is very sensitive fun but not as fun as the experiments but you know still quite good.
B000FCK65W|5.0|As I said about Behind the Beautiful Forevers, loved both of these books!  Fun to read together for book club!
B007MNV5WU|3.0|This is no different than any of the others as in angry birds Rio halloween christmas valentines you know all of those.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Its a very awesome game!!!!!! It's very much like Mario bros. It has different levels and you can swim. Not like the first one yes the first one. Try the game!!!!!! I dare you!!!! But get the first one first.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|This is fun but can be hard a times it is very sensitive but still a very good game. The graphics are good too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|.This game is very fun for all ages,I love playing horse games so keep them coming ,I will be playing this game the rest of the day,thank you.
B008CRC506|5.0|I have watched this amazing series 2 or 3 times through and I am amazed at the amount of superb work and artistry that is put into a once a week tv show. It has to be a daunting task and I have been a fan of many of the stars for many years. I am truly amazed at Katharine's growth from the first days of American Idol until now (and yes I voted for her week after week). Megan, Debra, Angelica and everyone in the cast are superb. This video gets my highest rating as does the show! Long live Smash!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game ever! Must get it!! It's sooooo good! It's an amazing game, and its free!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for, just an easy to use calculator. I highly suggest this to anyone looking for such an app.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think this app is good. Sometimes I don't like it because it does<br />Not work but that is rarely. You should get this app I think if your<br />Bored this app will keep you busy!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I would recommend these books to anyone who likes 50 shades of gray. I love the suspense the drama and the unconditional love that the characters have for each other. It always keeps you on your toes and trying to guess what's going to happen next, and just when you think you have it figured out it takes a huge turn that you would never expect!!! I can't waste till the third book comes out!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun.Subway surfers is very much like the game Temple Run.If you like Temple Run then you will definitely like this game you can try it yourself it you think you kinda get the picture......It is fun....Here is the games link...[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B005K15XR4|5.0|Okay, so I only bought it because I hunted down the music for that Mass Effect 3 trailer (you know the one) but damn there's some good stuff on here that you'd normally never hear and remember. Well worth picking up.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its a fun game to enjoy in your free time with different scenes I really enjoyed this game even on my kindle fire
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Hilarious adventure of young Merida. Not ready for marriage still discovering life. Never a dull moment. Great movie for the whole family!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I work with Autistic children, and wanted to see this movie...I Love my kiddos and this movie was very instrumental in helping me to learn more about them!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint Eastwood does it again! Amy Adams as his daughter. Great story keeps you guessing. Great cast! Justin Timberlake was great.<br />Excellent movie!
B0012GMW0C|5.0|remembered it was close to be one of the first albums i bought.  loved it because i really don't like steve perry.  i like the original singer.  excellent music and brought back happy memories when i was young.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|A different twist from Arnies movie. Jessica Biel , Kate Beckinsale, Colin Farrell do a great job! Great special effects! Non stop action.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my fiance and she love this CD. She was glad to add this to her music collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfer is like...the best game ever. I'm so addicted to it. I like how they do that world tour stuff and where you can go to different places. Subway Surfer is seriously the BEST GAME EVER.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Thought it would be cute with a sweet Teddy bear....wrong. Very crude. Very disappointing. Nothing funny about this. Don't rent
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved it!!!<br />I wish it was longer... I Love all the puzzles and he hidden objects.<br />Ready to load another game.
B003KJF2WE|3.0|Ang Lee's &#34;Hulk&#34; tried for more, but with a poor casting choice for the Hulk. This Hulk is fun, but like Lee's, the 3D animation is not what it should have been. More to the point, this Hulk is just more formulaic. Edward Norton is an excellent actor, but he just doesn't have the presence. And if you've seen Mark Ruffalo in Avengers, you've seen what can be brought to the role. Tim Roth is good, but under-used. The 3D effects for his beast are weaker, I think, than those for the Hulk. The last 20 minutes of the film with the showdown between the Hulk and Roth's beast are the weakest part of the film. Again the 3D effects are surprisingly poor. For example, the helicopter in which Liv Tyler and William Hurt get tossed around looks like something we'd get in a SciFi (SyFy) channel homemade movie.<br /><br />All in all, diverting enough for two hours, but not much more than that.
0452289963|5.0|I found this book great and read it about 5 years ago as I write. I gave a copy to my dad and he had a life changing epiphany that genuinely, and lastingly, changed his perspective.  He was (finally) able to let go of aggression and anger.  For me it was less moving but an excellent book nonetheless
B007N9FKCY|5.0|when i first downloaded it, the expectations were low... but it's really great and fun. LOVE IT!!! absolutely love it :)
B000063K2W|4.0|It may be a chick flick but i have to admit its really quite good and in alot of ways still relavent in today world
0446554995|5.0|What more can I say?  Very entertaining.  Parts made me gasp and at least one made me laugh out loud.  The twin factor, with which most of us probably were acquainted, was handled in the most thought provoking way.  But now he's going on an extended vacation?  Hopefully not for too long
B009GEAPYW|5.0|This batman movie rocks. Would not recommend for kids but definitely for any batman fan. Shows why Batman is a beast!
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|This movie had a great cast and story line.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for an uplifting movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved all the suspense! I will read it over again until the third book comes out in May!!Hate waiting,it's going to be hard!
B008B68IEA|5.0|So happy I could find this Monster High Ice Bed.  Tough item to find in stores - price was right.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Good game once u get pass the first section of the game. Also good at making u use ur knogging a little
B005CRQ2IU|1.0|I probably would have loved it if I were able to read it on my kindle! I am sad to not have been able to enjoy it even though this was supposed to be a kindle offering.
B000NY17J6|4.0|Much of the same as above. Nice selection of her hits. Good quality and it was good service. That's it.
B00000DRYI|4.0|This is one of my favorite cd's by him with &#34;Over the mountain!!&#34; I don't think anyone has even D'coded the guitar solo part 4 it is just way 2 complicated!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This app was not well not poop and I think if you buy this app you will enjoy it and the best part is it's free.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game it should be called awesome surffers I would give this 1000 stars but I can only give it 5
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Would of never thought it, but I can clearly not get enough of this show!  Enjoy this show very much, and re-watch it regularly.
0425263916|5.0|Great book a litt short but I guess It was so good I read it in a day . I defiantly recommend you read it .
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Usually sequels just don't measure up.  The Men in Black run needs to keep running - if the next movie is as good as the first three then I'm ready for #4.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|The ultimate album, none like it.  I can meditate to as well as exercise to it. In the 80s I used this for nightly  meditation in an adolescent treatment center in Oakland,
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Jeremy Renner is great I this movie. If you are a Borne Fan than you will love this . I liked the action, plot and looking forward to more.....
B002ECN4P0|5.0|What can you say about a CD that has most of your favorite songs on it.  Excellent.  I exercise to it.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|It has a few parts that could have been left out for crudeness..but other then that it was so funny! The jokes are very well placed and written.
1564029654|5.0|When my oldest was a baby, we read this book so much to her that she started reciting it out loud to herself by memory but almost had us fooled into thinking she could read at 2! After my third child ripped the paperback version of this much-loved book to shreds, we were so happy to discover it came in board book form. Great story and illustrations. You can't go wrong with this book, especially with the toddler set.
B004PGO25O|5.0|I heartily reccomendation Mr. Pressfield's work to every and anyone who has ever struggled to get their work done. As I writer, I find myself arm-wrestling with my resistance on an hourly basis and ths book helps to bring the struggle into focus. Not only does he let you know that you are not alone in your travail, he gives practical and succinct advice to put you on the road to conquering the Goblins of Self-Sabotage.<br />&#34;Do the Work&#34; is a must- read!<br />Thanks
1600597963|5.0|Absolutely wonderful book.  Great pictures easy to follow instructions. I would definately  recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn this media.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|What a joy to have Brian Wilson at the helm of a new BeachBoys album. Fine songs, singing, and sonics make this a pleasure from start to finish.
160059672X|5.0|Love - love - love this book.  Great books with good easy to follow instructions. I would recommend this book.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I cannot wait until I can read the next one : )<br />I really liked chapter 10. Aabeth is over stubborn.
B008133MDK|5.0|The most enjoyable Sherlock Holmes I've ever seen and the interpretation is as Arthur Conan  Doyle would have wanted.  My hero.
B004SDEP38|5.0|I have to have this one and it is handy love it.  No problems at all great product.  It is very useful
0380715430|5.0|I have everything Bill Bryson has ever written....I think. He is a brilliant writer, his sense of humor is superbly funny.  There are facts that surprised me, that edified my repertoire of words and just made me laugh. Only one thing wrong with Bill Bryson. He doesn't write enough books to satisfy my craving.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Great app you have to have it if you want to be able to see important documents sent to you by e-mail,
B00992CF6W|5.0|wonderful game for my boys, it really lets them use their imagination! they love building, planting plants, and making it their own!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a fun game that gives you challenges you with a daily challenge other fun but hard challenges to level up.
B009MO57H6|1.0|Although the Resident Evil movies have always been somewhat disappointing compared to the video games they're based on, I still rather enjoyed watching the first three instalments and, once I made it through the obligatory Kung Fu scene of Afterlife, even that wasn't too bad. So I was really looking forward to Michelle Rodriguez's return in Retribution but, sadly, I was in for a major disappointment. Whereas the first four movies still had something resembling of a story to tie all of the action sense together, it seems like in this one the makers just got together to brainstorm ideas for their new movie but since they couldn't come up with anything good, they just shot every single idea they did come up with, edited them all together and called it a movie. The result is so messy it's hard to believe it was directed by the same man who made Soldier and Event Horizon. In my opinion, as much as the makers of The Walking Dead got the Zombie genre just right, that's how badly Paul W.S. Anderson missed the ball with Resident Evil: Retribution. The ending does leave an interesting opening for a 6th and hopefully final instalment but it's going to be tough to make up for this one.
B00632HWOG|1.0|in short, this is the worst app by far that I have ever used. I have 2 yahoo accounts into this app on the kindle fire. the software frequently opens the other account that was NOT selected. after reporting a message as deleted, the deleted message suddenly reappears. it's pitiful.
1616550414|5.0|The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia is friggin' awesome, it has many concept arts from various Zelda games and the book is full of drawings and stories of every game. If you are a Zelda fan this is definitely a must have in your collection, Shigeru Miyamoto put a lot of work in this book and the best of it all is almost 300pgs. Buy it NOW! xD
B00B2V66VS|4.0|i love this app. my only problem is that when ever i use a &quot;save me&quot;, the app force closes and restarts.... if that was fixed, it would be perfect!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm not a zombie geek, but I sure do love this show! Good writing, and the 3rd season has really taken off well. Can't wait for the second half! I think the southern setting goes a long way for me, but the writing and acting are (mostly) very well done. And the third season in particular has been highly thrilling!<br /><br />I will note--I would consider this series &#34;PG-13&#34; on the scale of zombie gore. I tried watching The Evil Dead and couldn't quite handle it, so I figure I'm not very hard-core. (I guess I'm okay with monsters you can outrun! Trapped in a cabin, not so much.) It's a LOT of violence and killing, but it's so....what's the word...fantastical? that it doesn't bother me, and this is from someone who does NOT like horror movies. But I love this show! Definitely worth your time.
B004TTMYQG|1.0|Used to be great.  Something<br /> changed and now it wont recognize appstore authorization.  Looks like several other Amazon apps are failing also.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is one of Ken Follet's best books and I should know as I have read all of his books. This takes off where book one left off with the same characters that we met in book one. This book builds on their personalities and delves into their strenghts and weaknesses. Even the weakest of the characters have changes as they find dissapointments with Naziism. I would put this book up with his other best sellers such as book one of the trilogy and Pillars of the earth.
B004QPOVF0|5.0|I cannot vouch for the product personally, because I bought it as a gift for a son-in-law. He appreciated the gift, and as far as I know, has had no problems with it. Sorry that I cannot say much else about it!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This is the best movie of the series and the whole series is excellent. All the actors are very good and the ending made it seem to be ready for another one in the series. That would be fine.
B003Y74KCK|4.0|it has a wave patteren on the back I'm not crazy about but it fits nicely and goes into your pocket like you aren't using s cover
B005LAIIQC|5.0|W<br />e liked everything about this movie. The acting and the actors.  The Bourne Legacy...Plus a good ending. Plus good acting.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love the game.  My husband is also hooked on it.<br />xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx xx x
B00AWTTUHI|4.0|Very rare do you see an adaptation surpass the original source material. The designs are brilliant. Peter Weller makes an excellent Batman. And the final fight is just spectacular. I highly recommend it.
B00683JK9K|5.0|This works well with my android 4.1.2 tablet. It runs smoothly and I have not had any problems with it.  I understand by reading some reviews it may not be the fault of the program but maybe a software or hardware problem....some programs will crash on my system while others run smoothly. Game play is good. I have had no problems with the tiles other than once in a while it seems like I have to swipe it again.
B00ACKU1NY|5.0|great product if you like watching french language tv. not a great product if you don't want to watch French tv
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Very realistically told story as I imagine what that time must of been like.  Disappointed the season didn't last longer.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome game for children, not violent; mostly chased by gorilla; jumping, running through obstacles.  Great game that kids will love.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the game is one hundred times better than<br />the original the graphics are way better the monster is scarier and there are new obstacle and traps and best of all its freeeeeee!!!!!!! get this app now
0140177396|5.0|This classic never gets old.  I read it as a child and I still enjoy reading it to this day.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Pac Man is one of my all time favorites.  It's a little hard to get used to using my finger instead of a joy stick.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|I love Mad Men.  Season Five was very entertaining and I have the opportunitly to look at it again and again.
B0067Q04AM|5.0|This is an exquisite recording [to this listener]. Great band playing and vocals through out. The track Ah Yeah featuring Musiq and Chrisette Michelle is a masterpiece. Mr Glasper and company seamlessly integrate rap, r and b, inspirational [the uplifting and beautifully sang song, It's Gonna Be Alright featuring Ledisi] with his jazz piano playing. It took me a while to buy this recording. It definitely is worth the wait. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I love Mad Men.  Season One was very entertaining and I have the opportunitly to look at it again and again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best game ever especially for free! It has lovely graphics and a BIGGER monkey! I definally recommend this game and if your not sure just try it, its FREE!
B001GCUER0|5.0|I love Mad Men.  Season Two was very entertaining and I have the opportunitly to look at it again and again.
1582701709|5.0|I purchase this book as a gift for my mother.  She absolutely loves it!  She's so happy with it that she has convinced me to read it when she get through with it.  Unfortunately, she keeps re-reading it so I may never get the chance.

B002CSC5EC|5.0|This dvd is unbelievable. The picture quality is perfect and the audio is THE BEST! I would recommend this dvd to everyone who likes the woodstock movie!!!!!!
B00914JWSW|5.0|Okay, now after months of this release, I have decide that this is one of my favorite Barbra CD's. I love hearing all the songs that I have heard on some hissy tracks on the internet in there full bloom versions.  I was hoping for a full box set..where is Shall We Dance, Make Our Garden Grow, On My Own, A Funny Thing Happened, One Day, For Pete's Sake... the list goes on and on. Are we ever going to have a Re-Release Me that has the songs like Frank Mills, Our Corner of the Night, Look, Et La Mer and that list goes on. I am giving this 5 stars because I have waited for these songs for years. I am VERY happy that these came out, but I just want way more. if this would have be a box set with all the above on it. It would be 10 stars plus!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this to help me with homework and it is just what I need for now. It is very basic and that is perfect for me. so if you need a good calculator app for the Kindle Fire get this one!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This novel combines religion, philosophy and cultural diversity in a fun and adventurous way.  An amazing combination of grins and gravitas.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|i absoltuely love this cd. There is not a song on here you wont enjoy. i love the breakup song.
B001XV3LSS|4.0|It was a great movie when I saw it years ago.  I recently bought a new tv with HD capabilities and really enjoyed the colors on the HD version of this movie.  My 11-year old nephew also saw the movie and really enjoyed it even though it's an &#34;old&#34; movie.
B008VBYN80|4.0|not bad, reminds me of farmville. the graphics aren't too bad either. will have to play more and really get the feel for the game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's Temple Run on a modern day railway...Extremely Addicting...Don't say I didn't warn you! Seriously, six more words? o.k. now?
B004U8VQOW|5.0|I have always been fascinated about space. This put a spotlight on some of space many mysteries. Product was just as advertised
B00992CF6W|5.0|really fun but it needs flint and steal on creative mode. it also needs buckets for water and lava .another thing it needs is pumpkins so you can make an iron golom
B001H5X7KC|3.0|I absolutely love this movie and it's why I ordered it. I think it's one of the funniest, savvy and intelligent comedies made in recent times.<br />My rating is a 3 for this disk because I don't actually have a BluRay player but the disk does not allow me to download a copy to watch on my laptop like other BluRays I have purchased.<br />Why did I buy it? Because I have been able to watch a downloaded version. And, I plan to buy a BluRay player in the near future, anyway.<br />I also followed the insert's instructions to go to Paramount's BluRay website which no longer exists. So, I tried their UltaViolet website and this movie isn't even listed there. Too bad. I'll have to wait a little longer to see it.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|was able to play for a few times before it quit loading and i had to uninstall and lose all my high scores and what not. Kindle Fire Gen 1.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|The one problem with books in a series is repetition. If you've read the other Harry Hole books, some of the content will be familiar, but this is a fresh story, and there's more than enough to keep a reader guessing, and entertained. Well worth a read.
0061950726|5.0|On the coast of Maine lives a wealthy ninety-one year old woman named Vivian Daly.  Yet in her attic are trunks that reveal the secrets of her turbulent past.<br /><br />It is the year 2011, and nearby in the same town of Spruce Harbor, lives a seventeen-year-old girl named Molly Ayer who has bounced from foster home to foster home, and is now in a situation involving petty theft that will require some kind of community service.<br /><br />Told in beautifully evocative prose, the story unfolds in alternate perspectives, revealing what has happened to each of them, and how the parallel lines of their lives now converge to spotlight the similarities between them.<br /><br />From Vivian's early childhood in Ireland, to New York City, comes her passage on the Orphan Trains in 1929.  A journey that will take her to Minnesota, from one home to another, never really knowing what home feels like, as she is treated like a slave and seldom has enough of anything, much less affection or love.<br /><br />What Molly sees when she meets the elderly woman is a wealthy person who could not begin to understand her or her issues.  But as the two of them clean out the boxes in the attic, the stories they share with one another reveal so much more than either could have suspected.<br /><br />The characters, both the primary ones and the supporting ones, brought so much color and emotion to the stories that I could feel as though I were sitting in their midst, observing and listening to them.  And as I neared the end of [[ASIN:0061950726 Orphan Train: A Novel]], I really could not have imagined a more beautiful or satisfying conclusion, and with it came a feeling that these characters would live on in my memories.<br /><br />At one point, Molly is at Vivian's home, taking in her recent good fortune:<br /><br />\\"Sitting in the rocker in the kitchen, looking out at the water, Molly feels oddly at peace.  For the first time since she can remember, her life is beginning to make sense.  What up until this moment has felt like a random, disconnected series of unhappy events she now views as necessary steps in a journey toward...enlightenment is perhaps too strong a word, but there are others, less lofty, like self-acceptance and perspective....\\"<br /><br />It is impossible to read this story and not take away from it the knowledge that wonderfully unexpected moments can happen in a life, even in one that is full of turbulence, pain, loss, and the sense of being an outsider.  And when such moments occur, it is also impossible not to celebrate.  Or feel the sense of exuberance that comes with the gifts of love, acceptance, and second chances.  A story with a perfect ending that I won't share here, for fear of spoiling it for the reader.  Suffice it to say that you will love Vivian and Molly and will feel the joy of their unique connection.  Five stars.up until this moment has felt like a random, disconnected series of unhappy events she now views as necessary steps in a journey toward...enlightenment is perhaps too strong a word, but there are others, less lofty, like self-acceptance and perspective....\\"<br /><br />It is impossible to read this story and not take away from it the knowledge that wonderfully unexpected moments can happen in a life, even in one that is full of turbulence, pain, loss, and the sense of being an outsider.

B001AH6ZWY|5.0|just an awesome movie. Jodie foster is a good actress.it gives you an understanding about politics and corporation and the way things can be covered up.
1416972250|4.0|Another fast paced, action filled, excitingly good installment in the series. With a huge sigh of relief for Jace & Clary. So happy this series is in the works for a movie. With the The Twilight Saga over, we need some new blood. Great, great and great. Can't wait to see how this ends.
0393317552|5.0|Lots of info to bite into! Sometimes can be a bit dry but Diamond delivers the info with out trying to bend you to his view point. His delivery is not jaded or hampered by trying to conform to being politically correct. He's a curious scientist with out bias or prejudice. He's straight forward with honest information that spans a wide array scientific knowledge. Fascinating!
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Good book. Too tired. To say 18 words want to show 100 per cent<br />Wanda Lee is finished. Cot<br />Wanda in out
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|This is a really cool app.  It could be made better if is gave hints on how to do better.  For example,for the life of me I can't remember names and the 4 digit numbers that go along with them.  Strategy??
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I liked this bag a lot. Its compact, easy to handle, has enought padding and i can keep more than 2 cameras in the bag.<br />Bag is made out of good material

0743496736|5.0|I am going to say upfront that I have not finished reading this book but so far it is a very engrossing read and I really need to understand why this keeps happening.  In December of 2012, in Sandy Hook, Connecticut we suffered a similar tragedy on a greater scale than what's portrayed in this book.  I say this because there were 26 victims and 20 of them where children whereas this book is situated in high school with only 10 victims and of course this is fiction (that is not to say that it hasn't happened).  I have a 6 year old daughter and was so sadden by Sandy Hook tragedy because I picture ALL the victims in this tragedy (teachers, children, parents of the children, first responders, relatives, etc...) and I know that this could happen to anyone of us.  I decided to read this book to try to get a feel for what goes on in school so that I can raise my daughter to understand that rejecting someone who is different from her is not right.  God created us all equal and therefore we should all treat each other with respect.  After I finish reading this book which is great so far.  I will have more to add.  Stay tuned.

0307957837|1.0|The Golden Compass book and movie were both beautiful, but with an underlying dark message that quickly evolves into absolutely nonsensical confused trash.  The message of this series is so odd and dark I felt like I wasted not only my money buying the books, but more importantly, my time reading them.

B00B1E6FF8|5.0|I really liked this movie, I had chills from the second I saw the previews for it! I became obsessed again with the finding of bin lain. I watched several documentaries about the war and on him and on his cohorts. I watched Seal Team Six, which was great for a low budget, true story film. I was in awe watching Zero Dark Thirty, I think Jessica Chaplain was ok, Jason Clarke was brilliant! What I honestly found most disturbing is hearing comments that there is extensive and/or brutal torture. There is none that I saw, none that you could not see on basic television. The movie was great. Very, very, educational! I think it should be shown in schools for world history.

The story was funny and very entertaining,but as the story continues she falls in love with him not knowing that<br />he plans to go to a place to end  h is life in six months..  She made an impression on him during the six months the guy<br />had given his parents to stay alive.  This turned into a love story that ended very sadly.
B005DBFZQU|4.0|I'm not going to interrupt the flow of praise here, except to ask if a recording should be given five stars when - on my audio system, at least - the piano is so hard and clangorous, and placed in an ambience too full of echo. These problems show up only at fairly loud volume, however. Andras Schiff is a strong Schumann interpreter, and where I avoid his Schubert because he is unremittingly too refined and smooth, I am attracted to his Beethoven by fits and starts because he has so many ideas. In Schumann the case is the same but the strange ideas are fewer.<br /><br />In this two-CD set the program spans Schumann's earliest great success for the piano, Papillons Op. 2 (the Abegg Variation are Op. 1 and are not to be shrugged off) to his lamentable last phrase, where distress over his mental breakdown clouds any assessment of the music. Schiff is entirely successful in Papillons, without being as adventurous and imaginative as Richter (on EMI or a live alternative on BBC Legends, which is the better of the two). Schiff favors a dynamic range that is never as soft or loud as Richter's. His success lies in giving each of the score's twelve episodes their own mood and characterization.  Except for Schiff's fans, however, I wouldn't call this an eye-opening reading, just as very musical, assured one. Throughout it is natural and unmannered.<br /><br />The F-sharp minor Sonata Op. 11 is a rhapsodic, sprawling work that introduces the challenge of holding together a large form that the composer himself may not have controlled very well. This opus was preceded by ten others that were all piano works, including the Toccata and Carnaval, so in terms of passion, melody, and rhapsodic poetry, Schumann was in full command. So is Schiff, in a masterful reading that brings out all the music's strengths. Only the score's weak finale keeps it form being more popular, I suppose. Schiff's playing is ebullient throughout and very alluring. A big success, then.<br /><br />Moving in chronological order, we get to the beloved Kinderszenen, where Schiff encounters opposition from legends like Horowitz and Argerich (but not Richter).  Schiff seems determined to not sound sentimental, but this makes him lean in the direction of losing the work's tender mood. He also avoids showing too much personality, when the whole point of Schumann, as it is with Liszt writing for the keyboard, is nothing but personality. This is fine, cultivated playing, but nothing is very memorable for all that. Tempos tend to sound a bit impatient throughout. If you want a dry-eyed interpretation, here it is.<br /><br />It would be hard to name a great pianist who hasn't attempted the Fantasy in C (Serkin, perhaps?), which gives scope for every Schumannesque mood - Eusebius and Florestan are both in full play. It's this wide range that makes the work so hard to conquer in its entirety, not to mention some treacherous technical demands. Schiff surmounts those demands by backing off too much in the first movement and refusing to ride to the trimphalism of the second  movement march. He inserts artful hesitations, quieter counterpoint, and a general tendency toward restraint, the effect is very musical, and when the shoe fits, in the third movement, Schiff wears it well. His experience and sophistication allow him to hold that elusive, shifting piece of contemplation together very well. So call this reading a qualified success, if somewhat too low key.<br /><br />Waldszenen Op. 82 comes late enough in Schumann's career that mental distress becomes an issue. Richter was attracted to its wandering expression; he found it a chimera worth chasing. (His sole recorded performance seems to be from late November, 1956 in Prague.) Neither Horowitz nor Argerich recorded the work.  Schiff more or less establishes a single mood - flowing and pastoral - and lets it go at that. I imagine that more could be done, but my reaction to these nine little episodes is one of declining powers on Schumann's part. I recognize but can't share the counter opinion, that late Schumann contains its own strange genius.<br /><br />The composer's last work for piano was the rarely played \\"Ghost Theme\\" Variations, which has no opus number. I can find only 14 current recordings, as compared with 126 for Carnaval.  A better translation of \\"Geister\\" might be \\"spirit,\\" since the suffering Schumann believed that the theme was being dictated from the spirit world. It's certainly a tender, haunting theme, and if the variations might be open to criticism, Schiff offers his tenderest, most sensitive playing here. I wouldn't have wanted him to leave out this last sad work, a swan song of aching beauty.n's part.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best shows I have seen on television.  The acting is very good, and the sets, costuming, etc make me feel I am back in the early 20th century.  The characters are absorbing.  I like the length, which allows for more character development than occurs in the normal one-hour episode.

B004PHSTY8|5.0|I've just recently gotten into &#34;Supernatural.&#34; Having watched the first and second seasons now, I'm hooked. When I saw on IMDb that this show is horror/thriller, I knew I had to give it a look-see because I love horror/thriller shows and I'm always looking for horror/thriller shows. It seems nowadays the only good shows are the hour-long episodic ones like &#34;Supernatural,&#34; although of the television shows I own (which is a little over 30 shows) the only more recent shows I have are &#34;Supernatural&#34; and &#34;Smallville.&#34; So far with, &#34;Supernatural,&#34; I can't wait to watch the the other seasons and get all caught up. I already have seasons six and seven, but I still need seasons three to five, which are on their way to being delivered.<br /><br />By the way, Jared and Jensen have great chemistry together and a lot of times you really believe they're brothers. And I have seen both of them act before, Jensen more so than Jared since I DO have &#34;Smallville.&#34; The only things I've seen Jared in is a little bit of &#34;Gilmore Girls,&#34; the remake of &#34;Friday the 13th,&#34; and his uncredited role of a bully in the remake of &#34;Cheaper by the Dozen.&#34; Having watched two seasons of &#34;Supernatural&#34; now, I have more of a perspective on how really good both Jensen and Jared are as actors.
B000005AYL|3.0|The track listing on Amazon shows the CD's tracks - but the vinyl version you will receive does not include \\"Certainly\\", \\"Otherside of the Game\\", \\"Drama\\" or \\"Rimshot (Outro)\\". In addition, the version of \\"Next Lifetime\\" on the vinyl is a shorter \\"radio edit\\" lasting 4:44 instead of the 6:27 CD version. Finally, the album packaging does not include the original cover art - it will arrive in a plain black sleeve with a sticker on it. Amazon needs to fix this listing!

Well worth the upgrade.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Led Zeppelin's newest double live album and DVD/Blu Ray set entitled Celebration Day was released in November of 2012.<br />For five years, many people had been awaiting the release of this album and DVD which documented the return to the live stage of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bass player/keyboard player John Paul Jones and Jason Bonham on drums (sitting in for his father who is still sorely missed) for their one-off reunion show at London's 02 Arena in December of 2007. Seeing I couldn't go see this live as limited amount of tickets were made available, when I heard that the show was being released on CD and DVD together I said \\"let's do it\\".<br />We begin disc one with a spirited \\"Good Times Bad Times\\" which buries the studio version. Next we have \\"Ramble On\\", which was not played live before but a great version that ends with a teaser of \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\". Then we go into a killer version of \\"Black Dog\\". Next is a haunting version of \\"In My Time of Dying\\" which has Pagey rocking out on slide, Jonesy on fretless bass, Percy singing his *ss off and Jason playing as good as his dad. We follow with the superb rendition of \\"For Your Life\\" which until this show not ever played live and it works. Next is \\"Trampled Underfoot\\" which is a great version showing John Paul Jones was not only a great bass player but great keyboard player as well and Pagey using some stellar whammy pedal on his guitar. Then we follow with a spirited version of \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" which is just a killer track. We end the first disc with a haunting version of \\"No Quarter\\" which is just an excellent version.<br />The second CD starts with a blistering version of \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" (which trumps The Song Remains version and Robert hits a scream that sounds like his younger self). We follow with a haunting but effective 11 minute version of \\"Dazed and Confused\\" which is superb. The violin bow section was the best I ever heard. Also, the jam that goes on is amazing and it ends with a killer Page solo. We follow with arguably the best version of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" although it is in a lower key than the original. Then we follow with a spirited version of \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" which buries the studio version by a longshot. We follow with a spirited run through \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\". Next is a great version of \\"Kashmir\\" which is excellent and trumps the version from 1979 on the Led Zeppelin DVD. We then have a stellar version of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" which is just smoking. we encore with a spirited version of \\"Rock and Roll\\" which ends (like it did on The Song Remains the Same) with the intro to \\"Celebration Day\\" and a great version.<br />The newest Zeppelin live CD/DVD/Blu Ray set of Celebration Day is proof that Led Zeppelin still had what it takes to perform live and if they did reunite for a tour, I'd go but since Robert Plant doesn't want to do it, this says goodbye to Zeppelin in GRAND STYLE!!<br />Recommended!s on is amazing and it ends with a killer Page solo.

B00009P1O2|4.0|Queen's Live at Wembley '86 was originally released as a VHS in the UK before its audio counterpart was released in June of 1992.<br />The DVD was filmed and recorded on Queen's final tour with its classic lineup at the now demolished old Wembley Stadium in London on July 12, 1986 (the band sold out two nights and could have done a few more Wembley gigs but was not available so it ended at Knebworth Park (which deserves a release for pure historical value)).<br />Regardless, this is a pretty damn fine show featuring a good mix of (then) new songs (The pulsing opener \\"One Vision\\", a killer \\"A Kind of Magic\\", a stunning \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\" and a great but short \\"Friends Will Be Friends\\") and classic ones (\\"Tie Your Mother Down\\", \\"In the Lap of the Gods (Revisited)\\", a short \\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\", \\"Tear it Up (with a teaser of Liar)\\", \\"Under Pressure\\", \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\", the pulsing \\"I Want to Break Free\\", \\"Now I'm Here\\", the acoustic \\"Love of My Life\\" and \\"Is This the World We Created\\", \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"Hammer to Fall\\", \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\", \\"Radio Ga Ga\\", \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are the Champions\\") despite some obvious vocal overdubs (as this came out on video in the late 1980s in Europe) on \\"One Vision\\", \\"A Kind of Magic\\", \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\", \\"Radio Ga Ga\\" and \\"We Are the Champions\\".<br />Also, there was a little jam called \\"Impromptu\\" which showcased Freddie's dynamic vocal range and Brian May's 9 minute guitar solo called \\"Brighton Rock Solo\\".<br />Also, the band decided to incorporate several 50's-era tunes into one medley (\\"You're So Square (Baby I Don't Care)\\", \\"Hello Mary Lou\\" (although Led Zeppelin did it better on How the West Was Won) and \\"Tutti Fruitti\\" (which was extended on this remastered version of Live at Wembley) and also the 40s song Big Spender which was part of the first encore. Certainly it is a slicker concert film but not as great as Queen On Fire Live at the Bowl (recorded in 1982 and released in 2004) nor Queen Rock Montreal (recorded in 1981 and released in 2007) nor even Hungarian Rhapsody Live in Budapest 1986 (released in 2012).<br />The Live at Wembley Stadium DVD is not bad.<br />In summer of 2003, it was released on DVD with FOUR BONUS TRACKS including killer versions of \\"A Kind of Magic\\", \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\", \\"Tutti Fruitti\\" and \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" from the first Wembley performance July 11, 1986 (which was better than the versions on the regular album and also overdub free) plus two documentaries (one of which featured then new interviews with Roger Taylor and Brian May) on the Wembley performances and also alternate camera angles on the band members for certain songs.<br />This live DVD is recommended!2004) nor Queen Rock Montreal (recorded in 1981 and released in 2007) nor even Hungarian Rhapsody Live in Budapest 1986 (released in 2012).<br />The Live at Wembley Stadium DVD is not bad.<br />In summer of 2003, it was released on DVD with FOUR BONUS TRACKS including killer versions of \\"A Kind of Magic\\", \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\", \\"Tutti Fruitti\\" and \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" from the first Wembley performance July 11, 1986 (which was better than the versions on the regular album and also overdub free) plus two documentaries (one of which featured then new interviews with Roger Taylor and Brian May) on the Wembley performances and also alternate camera angles on the band members for certain songs.<br />This live DVD is recommended!
B009DH37CY|5.0|Queen's newest 2-CD/DVD and/or 2-CD/Blu Ray package Hungarian Rhapsody Live in Budapest '86 is a must for Queen fans.<br />This CD and DVD package was recorded and filmed on Queen's final tour with its classic lineup at Nepstadion in Budapest, Hungary on July 26, 1986 (a few weeks after the more famous shows from the demolished old Wembley Stadium in London on July 12, 1986). Unlike Wembley, this is singer Freddie Mercury, guitarist Brian May, bass player John Deacon, drummer Roger Taylor and keyboard player Spike Edney warts and all live.<br />This is a killer show featuring a good mix of (then) new songs (The pulsing opener \\"One Vision\\", a killer \\"A Kind of Magic\\", a stunning \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\" and a great but short \\"Friends Will Be Friends\\") and classic ones (\\"Tie Your Mother Down\\" (in full on the CD), \\"In the Lap of the Gods (Revisited)\\", a short \\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\", \\"Tear it Up (with a teaser of Liar)\\", \\"Under Pressure\\", \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" (only on the CD), the pulsing \\"I Want to Break Free\\", \\"Now I'm Here\\", the acoustic \\"Love of My Life\\" and \\"Is This the World We Created\\", \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"Hammer to Fall\\" (in full on the CD), \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" (in full on CD), \\"Radio Ga Ga\\", \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are the Champions\\") and the band were playing with a fire that lacked on Wembley IMHO.<br />Also, there was a little jam called \\"Looks Like Tonight's Gonna Be a Great Night\\" (which is only on the CD) which showcased Freddie's dynamic vocal range and is better than the \\"Impromptu\\" that appeared on Wembley two weeks earlier and Brian May's 8 minute \\"Guitar Solo\\" (in full on the CD) which is one of his best guitar solo spots.<br />Also, the band decided to incorporate several 50's-era tunes into one medley (\\"You're So Square (Baby I Don't Care)\\" (only on the CD), \\"Hello Mary Lou\\" (also on the CD) and \\"Tutti Fruitti\\" (I believe extended on the CD as well) and also the traditional Hungarian folk song \\"Tavasi Szel Vizet Arast\\". Out of the three recorded documents of the Magic Tour (Live Magic, Live at Wembley Stadium and Hungarian Rhapsody), this is the best of the bunch IMHO.<br />Justin Shirley Smith and Joshua MacRae have done a great job restoring and remixing the entire show.<br />Also during the show, you get some footage of the band hanging out in Budapest (especially when Freddie asked how much the house of government was and if it was for sale).<br />Also on the DVD and Blu-Ray you get a bonus documentary on the Magic Tour which leads up to the shows in Budapest. Hungarian Rhapsody Live in Budapest is the peak of Queen on their Magic Tour.<br />This live album/DVD/Blu Ray is recommended!ut of the three recorded documents of the Magic Tour (Live Magic, Live at Wembley Stadium and Hungarian Rhapsody), this is the best of the bunch IMHO.<br />Justin Shirley Smith and Joshua MacRae have done a great job restoring and remixing the entire show.<br />Also during the show, you get some footage of the band hanging out in Budapest (especially when Freddie asked how much the house of government was and if it was for sale).<br />Also on the DVD and Blu-Ray you get a bonus documentary on the Magic Tour which leads up to the shows in Budapest.

B004SBS8LA|4.0|It is a good game. It is very hard to stop playing once you start. Fun and relaxing to play
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is sooo fun !!  I have temple run 1 & 2 and this is so much fun almost twenty times the fun... I would recommend or say something about it!!!<br />I love the way you can play with friends and challenge each other.
B004C0WVP6|1.0|I purchased 3 of these green drives for a home NAS to use RAID 5.  The first two failed within 6 months and the 3rd one went yesterday.  I purchased in March 2012.  Seagate charges for advanced replacement.  I have NEVER had a hard drive fail before so for these all to fail within 12 months, I was very let down by the company.  The only positive note is that I can say the return process was painless even though it did cost like $15 to do the replacement.<br /><br />Find something of better quality like WDC or Hitachi.  I cheaped out with these and in the end, it bit me.
B000AA4JMK|5.0|Outstanding musical with wonderful music and dance/choreography.  Wonderful for those of us who watched this as a child, and great for children today (you'll find yourself humming/singing these songs all day long) !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's good for time wasting big bang theory and Marilyn Manson rule I'm saying this to waste words so I can review
B000H4TX9I|4.0|I had to watch this for class and it worked fine.  It froze a few times but that was because I had paused it for an extended amount of time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Application is the bomb.com and I love reading this app.  It's the best I have seen, or used so far.
B002LANLDK|5.0|the whole series is great, just watched them all over again. this one and the first one are the best. This is the real squeal to the first one. 2 fast 2 furious, and Tokyo drift don't really fit in the whole story more side stories. can't wait for the 6 to come out on May 24th 2013...
B000002GKT|5.0|Ok, first off I grew up with this stuff but I don't like it because of some nostalgia for my youth. A lot of music I listened to back then is horrible to me now. I love the Who and Keith Moon was such an awesome drummer. They were a very English sounding band. Led Zepplelin had more soul, another band I love, with Bonham on the drums. If you have never heard Humble Pie, think hard rock jammed pack with soul. Every musician is on the same page in Pie. Every song on this recording is phenomenal. The excitement they generated in this recording is equal to anything I have ever heard. It was like the moment a bar chord on a Les Paul through a marshall was discovered. Imagine the excitement !! Steve Marriot is just so amazing. To hear him with the Small Faces and how different he was with Pie is a testament to his range.I am 53 now and have listened to jazz and classical music for decades and yet this gets me as excited as anything I have ever heard. A truly underrated group
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this show - great characters, acting and story! I am hoping there are many more seasons in the works!!!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I can't believe I waited this long to start watching this show. It's awesome. I'll be buying every season for sure.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so happy can play on my kindle .this is a great thing yay finally. add horsieluh. hfdg kgdssf kfsaf tay
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I found this description of stalking from the stalkers point of view boring.  My sister-in-law loved the movie, and it's. gotten. good reviews.  I wouldn't read it again, apparently the film script writer and director have managed to make a silk purse out of a sow's. ear.  So I recommend that you skip the book and just see the movie.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Originally, I gave this game 1 star in a fit of anger and disappointment. However, I've had some time to cool off. Now, I'm going to try and be as objective in this review as I possibly can so that you, the reader, can effectively determine whether or not this game will interest you.<br /><br />As many of the 5, 4, and even 3 star reviewers have mentioned, this game is highly addictive, entertaining, and fun for individuals of all ages. For all intensive purposes, it's a pretty awesome game. It's similar in style to Temple Run. The concept of the game is to dodge trains, barriers, walls, etc. to avoid capture by the Inspector and his dog. You can move left, right, jump (swipe up), or roll (swipe down) in order to avoid these obstacles. Running into any of these obstacles head on will cause your immediate capture and end your current run; \\"bumping\\" into or \\"stumbling\\" upon these obstacles will allow the Inspector to catch up. If you make another mistake within seconds of the first (~5 or less), you'll be captured.<br /><br />The game picks up its pace the longer you play, making it more difficult to avoid trains and obstacles. However, it becomes rather repetitive after a while (i.e. you'll see certain sections over and over again). Nevertheless, the game gives you incentive to play for several reasons:<br /><br />1. During each run you have the opportunity to score coins, which you can use to purchase new characters, boards, boosts/boost upgrades, and hover boards. You start off with one character, Jake, and have the opportunity to purchase/earn more in the shop. The cheapest character, Tagbot, will cost you 12,000 coins. The most expensive one, Prince K, will cost you 980,000 coins.<br /><br />Earning coins is no light task. You'll have to play often to bank a decent amount of money. But this is one of the incentives of the game. If you want to buy something, you'd better earn the coins to get it. Some people believe that these prices are ridiculously high, especially when it takes a great deal of effort to score a large number of coins. But that's up to you to decide. Also, you can purchase in game coins by using actual cash in the Amazon store.<br /><br />2. Hover Boards (HB) are nifty little boards that provide you with \\"protective insurance.\\" You start out with 3, and they cost 300 coins a piece. Aside from looking stylish, and being fun to ride, they give you a great level of protection. While riding on an HB, if you slam into an object head on, or bump into a couple of obstacles, instead of being captured by the Inspector, the current whole section of your run will disappear with a *poof,* allowing you to continue your run. Essentially, HBs are equivalent to having an extra life, and each one lasts 30 seconds. After using an HB, you must wait ~5 seconds before using another.<br /><br />3. During your run, there are several \\"boosts\\" that you can pick up. The Magnet (attracts coins in your vicinity), the Jet Pack (lets you fly above the course in the power lines, allowing you to avoid obstacles while scoring loads of coins), the Super Sneakers (allows you to jump higher and attracts any coins beneath your feet- my least favorite), and the x2 Score Multiplier (doubles your current score multiplier for a period of time [e.g. x20 → x40]). You can use these boosts simultaneously (i.e. picking up the Jet Pack when you already have the Magnet will NOT replace the Magnet with the Jet Pack. You can use both). However, if you get the Jet Pack while using Super Sneakers or a Hover Board, these \\"on ground\\" boosts' timer will pause until the Jet Pack use is up.<br /><br />Initially, each boost lasts for a relatively short period. However, you can \\"extend\\" the usage of each boost, and max each one out to 30 seconds in the shop. It will cost you somewhere around 60,000 coins, in increments of 5,000, 10,000, 15,000 and 30,000 I believe, to max out each one (so ~240,000 coins to max out all boosts).<br /><br />At the beginning of yourrun (within the first 5 seconds or so), you have the opportunity to use Mega Head Starts (which allow you to fly above the course and earn you a set number of points; each one costs 2,000 coins) and x5 Score Multipliers (a relatively new boost that turns all the x2 Score Multipliers in the course into x5 Multipliers, allowing for a generous score boost; each one costs 3,000 coins). These are useful for certain missions, and when you're trying to reach a new high score.<br /><br />4. Mystery boxes are items that you can pick up during a run (usually 1/run), or purchase in the shop for 500 coins. They contain a variety of \\"common,\\" \\"uncommon,\\"  \\"rare,\\" and \\"very rare,\\" prizes, including trophies (which don't do anything, but are nice to have), coins (ranging from around 200 to a very, very rare jackpot of 100,000), character tokens, Mega Head Starts, x5 Multipliers, and HBs (ranging from 2 to the very rare 10s and 40s).<br /><br />Let's discuss character tokens here. There are 4 characters that require a certain number of character tokens to be unlocked. These tokens can ONLY be found within mystery boxes. Tricky requires 3 Hats, Fresh requires 50 stereos, Spike requires 200 Guitars, and Yutani requires 500 UFOs. Aside from Tricky, earning these characters takes a lot of work, and weeks to months of play time. While purchasing Mystery Boxes helps, you're never sure of what you're going to get. So, like I said, unlocking these characters will take you quite a while, and is a pretty daunting task.<br /><br />5. Leveling up. What some people call \\"levels\\" is actually a \\"score multiplier.\\" You start off with x1 and, through the completion of various missions, reach a max \\"level\\" of x30. Each mission set includes 3 separate missions ranging in difficulty level. If you don't want to/cannot complete a mission, you always have the option of \\"buying out of it\\" in the shop for around 2,200 to 4,400 coins. Aside from allowing you to increase your score during a run, at the completion of each mission set, you are awarded a Silver Mystery Box, which contains rarer items than their typical counterparts. Once you reach x30, you can still complete various mission sets to earn Silver Mystery Boxes.<br /><br />6. New Themes. Subway Surfers is currently on a \\"World Tour.\\" Each month they offer an upgrade which will take you to a new place (January was NYC, February is Rio, etc.). New themes have also been offered during the holidays. Aside from vastly changing how the course looks (the run is basically the same as in the original), each theme offers a new, Limited Edition character (he/she will cost you 95,000 coins), as well as a new, Limited Edition Hover Board (which will cost you 50,000 coins) related to that theme. These characters and boards are only around for as long as the new theme is up (30 days tops), so you have a relatively short period of time to get them before they're permanently unavailable for purchase. It certainly is a plus to see what new themes, characters, and boards will be available each month.<br /><br />7. Daily Challenges are easy \\"missions\\" in which you have to collect certain letters to spell out a word or two. These words are usually related to the current theme or holiday. By completing these challenges (which are offered once every 24 hours), you can earn petty cash (anywhere from 500 - 2,000 coins), or Silver Mystery Boxes which can contain a lot more coins or other items.<br /><br />8. You can connect with your friends on facebook and challenge each other's high score. There's a leader board that ranks you and your fellow facebook gamers high scores, with the leader being number one. It's fun to try and beat the gamer with the highest score or, if you have the highest score, to either maintain it or even surpass yourself. Also, if you complete 50 runs (i.e. play 50 times), you earn a petty coin bonus for all your facebook friends (usually 70 - 250 coins). The same goes for you. If your friends complete 50 runs,you can also earn coins. It's a great way to pick up extra cash and help each other out.<br /><br />So, now that you have an idea of how the game works, let's get into the issues.<br /><br />Minor Issue #1: The game often glitches when there isn't an internet connection. Now, the extent to which this causes a \\"real\\" problem varies. If you're in the midst of getting a high score or completing a mission (particularly \\"collect 5 Xs in one run\\") and all of a sudden a glitch occurs, then you're essentially screwed. You'll either get hit by a train or run into an obstacle because your touch screen didn't respond due to the glitch. Now you can survive many of these glitches in any given run... but certainly not all, and certainly not for long. So, if you're going to play this game often without internet connection, then keep this in mind. It can get very frustrating very fast, believe me.<br /><br />Minor Issue #2: When you do have an internet connection, the ads that pop up before you engage in a run, enter the shop, etc. can become annoying. They often cause the game to freeze or shut down all together. Nevertheless, it's not such a huge deal if you otherwise enjoy the game.<br /><br />Minor Issue #3: Hover boards are supposed to keep you safe, right? For the most part, they do. Other times... not so much. There have been several occasions where I used a hover board and, right as I was about to jump over a barrier or roll under one, my hover board's timer would run out. As it disappeared, the game would temporarily freeze or glitch, causing me to smack right into the barrier. However, this tends to occur most often when there is no internet connection.<br /><br />MAJOR ISSUE: This, my fellow gamers, was the deal breaker for me, and may very well be for you. For no reason at all, the game can \\"forget,\\" or rather erase, your data. One day you'll click on it to play and, to your surprise, horror, anger, and disappointment, come to find Jake, 3 HBs, a score or \\"level\\" of x1,and nothing more. Every single character, item, board, etc. that you worked so hard to earn will be gone FOREVER, and there's absolutely NO WAY to get it back. Your high score will remain, but nothing else.<br /><br />I was personally devastated by this loss myself. I had been playing for months, and enjoyed this game a great deal, despite the occasional glitches that would cause me to lose a mission or screw up my attempts to beat my own high score. Up until February 5th, I had a high score of 9.5 million (yes, I played a LOT), 375 hover boards (I rarely used them because I rarely needed them to get insanely high scores :P), I was already at x30 (i.e. level 30) and had completed numerous missions thereafter, I had a little over $300,000 coins, 232 Mega Head Starts, seven x5 Score Multipliers, all trophies, I had maxed out all of my boosts, and I purchased all the limited edition characters and boards (from the Halloween and Christmas themes, to NYC and Rio). I even unlocked all the characters that required character tokens, including Yutani, and that took months of playing. As I've mentioned before, obtaining character tokens takes a great deal of time and effort, and is amongst the most time consuming challenges of the game.<br /><br />On February 5th, I clicked on the game and BAM, just like that, everything that I had built up over the course of several months was gone in a second. No new updates had been made to my Kindle Fire. It hadn't even been shutdown. In short, this happened for no reason. At first I was completely surprised, and made several attempts to restart my game to see if my data would come back. Surprise gave way to extreme anger which, in turn, gave way to disappointment.<br /><br />I mean, I worked so hard to achieve everything that I had in the game, and it was all gone (save my high score). The mere thought of having to do it all over again (I mean, collect 500 UFOs from the mystery boxes to get Yutani? Never have a chance to re-purchase thelimited edition characters and boards I had? etc.), was daunting, and I couldn't fathom the idea of playing again.<br /><br />In short, I believe this is a great game. It's fun and addictive. Despite the repetition and even occasional glitches, it gives you a number of incentives to continue playing. But, if you're the type of person who enjoys making achievements in a game and, you know, keeping them, this is definitely not the game for you. Whether it's days, weeks, months, or years, there's a great probability that one day you'll awake to anger and disappointment when your data gets deleted. It'll be worse when it happens after you've played it for so long, grown to love it, and prided yourself on your in game accomplishments. Once your data is gone, you can't get it back.<br /><br />In short, this is an addictive, exciting, and amazing game for individuals of all ages, especially if you already like Temple Run. But, if you're going to get the game, keep in mind the very real, very common risk that, at some point in time, your data can be deleted and you can never get it back. So, if you just want this game for the occasional fun, have at it. If you want it to win trophies, unlock/purchase characters, boards, etc., and basically get the fullest out of this game, do so with caution and at your own emotional risk. Personally, I deleted the game, and I want nothing more to do with it. Now, whatever you decide is up to you. Well... cheers!

B004BLTNJI|5.0|In case you're confused by Amazon's mislabeling of this product, as I was, this version (ASIN: B004BLTNJI) IS the 3D Blu-ray, which, like all 3D Blu-rays, will also play in 2D. It's not the one with paper glasses--you need a 3D TV to watch this one in 3D. The second disc is a bonus disc, and it's a standard DVD. If in doubt, check the product info. Is it ASIN B004BLTNJI? Then it's this version.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Seems like a cool sequel but I honestly can't play it because it makes the increased motion makes me sick. What a shame because I loved the first one. Only reason for 3 stars.
0393343405|5.0|Would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in history and books and religion. Very well written. My book club is reading this now and so far the members are enjoying it.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|As most agree, it's quite a letdown after the high drama of the third installment. I'm amused by all the psuedo academic attempts to explain this, both favorably and unfavorably in other reviews. I think I'll just use the neutral phrase &#34;interlude novel.&#34; If you like the prose and the character nuances, you'll keep going in the hopes that the transitions and vicissitudes of Westeros will somehow become relevant (in the sixth book?). I'm still enjoying the series. I guess knowing in advance that this novel does not replicate its predecessor prepared me for the experience.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I'll keep it short since these reviews get reiterative. It's really a terrific novel if you are in to the concept of the series as a whole. There are some riveting and heartbreaking scenes in the narrative. I was enthralled. The single combat scene late in the work was tremendous. The red wedding....was totally blindsided. Great stuff. It doesn't disappoint.
B003V2HWP0|5.0|I love the plot of this story. Beautifully acted by Sophie Marceau and Stephen Dillane.  After keeping the bargain to bear a child for Dillane, Marceau can't forget her baby and finds her only to become her governess to be close to her.
0765325950|5.0|Brandon, you did Robert Jordan proud by finishing his epic series the way you did!  I have the book and I bought the audio version on audible.com and I gotta say Kate Redding and Michael Kramer did a fantastic job.  Thanks to those two for hanging in the 20 years to create consistency in the narration of the books.  Awesome job all the way around, guys!  Mr. Jordan (and I know that's not your real name) thank you for keeping me company since 1993 when a friend turned me onto the first book.  You, Rand, Egwene, Lan, Matt, Young Bull, Nyneve and all the other amazing characters will be sorely missed.

B00003CXA6|5.0|When I bought the pre-quel to this movie I didn't realize it was a triology.  The movie is wonderfully done and if you have any civil war or history buffs in your family, this movie is a must.  It is done in a way so that you feel as though you know a lot more about the &#34;men&#34; that fought and died not just the facts and gruesomeness of it all.

B00AF6B22E|3.0|This Denzil Washington vehicle seems like a retread of [[ASIN:B00AXVFH5E Days of Wine and Roses [HD]]] with a prequel from [[ASIN:B002FCCUPY No Highway In The Sky]] thrown into the plot line.<br /><br />At its heart it is about substance dependency. Washington plays a pilot who is  a functioning alcoholic and drug abuser. While high Washington heroically saves all but six \\"souls on board\\" of a commercial aircraft by executing a masterful controlled crash into  a Georgia field. That he was high may not have been a contributing factor to the loss of the aircraft.<br /><br />So we go from action to soap as the captain and his representatives attempt to conceal his impairment from the NTSB. And herein lies the problem. The heroics are difficult to envision and the idea that good pilots can fly and even perform extraordinary feats while lit up is dangerous. Most airline pilots I know rigorously refrain from alcohol and other intoxicants from to taking command of an airplane. There have been pilots arrested for attempting to fly while intoxicated and those pilots have been turned in by a whole bevy of informants from initial security, to gate personnel to flight crew. This is how it should be and why I am glad this is fiction.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|Fun twist on my favorite game! The beginning levels are easy because they serve as a tutorial. Each level adds more tiles until you build up to a full set where some tiles obscure others like a true Mahjong game. Be patient and use short strokes to control movement. Tried it as a free App of the Day and I'm glad I did. :)
1591843065|5.0|I know that I have always been a visual thinking type of person.  I *see* problems and solutions in my head as pictures.  But until I got this book, it was merely something I just understood about myself; &#34;yes, I'm more of a visual type of person&#34; and that is that.  Just a self observation such as my right arm is stronger than my left arm.<br /><br />Then I got this book and it helped me better understand what it means to be a visual thinker but, more importantly, how to leverage and even strengthen those innate skills.  As a result, I am more excited to tackle problems and solution description as ways to sharpen these skills.  The more I practice, the better I get.<br /><br />Value of this stuff extends wat beyond corporate board/conference rooms.  The techniques are relevant in all aspects of life including home-life.  This has expanded my thinking, solution and communication skills and is, therefor, worth more than the price of the book.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|We've always loved this movie and watch it every year. Now that it's available in Blu-ray it fits our big screen. Great speedy service as well.

B000AOEMXM|1.0|I don't know who puts the packaging together for many of the DVD sets, but it's pathetic.  The case looks sturdy, but when you open it up you realize there is another flimsy case with the cds in it that will not last.  The CD holders are held together with a cheap piece of tape that hold them together like a book without a cover ... just tape to hold it together.  There is also a paper cover that is stuck on the outside of the main container that has to be removed in order to open the set (this is where the pictures are on the cover, etc.).  It is stuck on with that gunk they use to stick free samples to products.  What's the point of this?  My set was also missing the booklet for season 3 and one case was chipped most likely due to the poor packaging.<br />Damaged DVD's and cases, missing inserts, etc. seem to be a regular problem.  I have had to return DVDs too many times.  It get's old.<br />As for the series itself I liked it or I wouldn't have purchased it.  I will buy it again at some point, but am not in the mood for another disappointment and waste of my time.  Maybe they will repackage these into something that is not so pathetic.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is better than the first one. i absolutely love it and so do my kids.  couldnt ask for a more fun game. definately a trest. we hVe competitions to see who can get more coins....
B0055SWM08|4.0|The music in this game is so soothing that you almost forget there is a game to play.  The levels have decent challenge without being completely impossible to work around.  A great time waster.
B009YQJ322|5.0|I've watched it three times already. Finally a movie worthy of the great character of JUDGE DREDD!!! I refused to watch the Stallone version years ago hoping something like this would come out. Karl Urban was an odd choice for Dredd to me at first, but when you saw the scowl and no nonsense attitude, you know he did the job perfectly. And he never took the helmet off! Well done! I hope they do more! I'd love to see the Apocalypse War and Judge Death hit the screen!
B009HELT3C|5.0|Tommy Lee Jones was great. Just as good as one and two.. Watch it its great. HDTV version is the best.
B0074ALZ7Q|2.0|I have been reading this book with a mixture of annoyance and expectation. Probably this was the aim of the writer, because even if this nameless main character reveals herself as an extremely weak and complaining woman you cannot help but keep on reading to see how it ends. There is the husband, Maxim, who apparently seems to be cold and detached, but you somehow feel that something is killing him from the inside. Mrs. Denvers, on the other hand, is a woman you cannot find hard to hate. She is the devil behind a servant's eyes; the obsessed and crazy character. It is basically the story of abovementioned woman, who marries Maxim: a very rich widower and moves to his estate, Manderly to be confronted with the memory of his beautiful and successful deceased wife, Rebecca. After enduring her crazed self-pity for half of the book, sympathizing with the husband, who is not rejecting her despite of her unbelievably moaning and childish behaviour; while hoping that Mrs, Danvers falls down the stairs breaking her neck, the reader finally comes to the last couple of chapters and the story gets interesting. You end up eating the last pages like you are starving only to be confronted with a quite dull end. I am quite disappointed by this book.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I have become addicted to this game and it's a great game to pass the time when I'm waiting for something or someone.
0811879631|5.0|I bought this book as a birthday gift for my sister who is currently attending art school and is aspiring to be an animator/concept artist. She loves it!
B003L77TZI|5.0|This cd, along with some Ke$ha, will probably never be taken out of my car.  It's always nice to be able to drop it into the cd player and check out hit after hit after hit.  It hasn't grown old after many listens and the mix is powerful and clear with pounding bass - perfect for the road.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I just got new phone and this was one of the first games I transferred from my old device :-) I'm actually really glad it didn't save my progress because I get to play it again!
B000QRIGLC|3.0|Good book. I respect all who serve no matter what there role is, but I couldn't help but feel this guy was tooting his own horn a little too much. I would think someone in his position would've been a little more humble. I would've gave 5 stars if the bragging wasn't so blatantly obvious. You don't have to tell me how great you are to get my respect, you had it when you joined up.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have to say that I got sucked into this by my significant other, and to my great surprise I love it! Fantastic story, and characters you can really get behind.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|This series contains all six seasons of the L word and includes a bonus disk with the L word reunion. Great show, and I love having every episode in one place.
B00APUYN0I|1.0|I started watching this with hopes that it wouldn't turn into Glee, but I have to say that I was sadly mistaken. I can't stand Capella music, and this pushed me over the edge. I was told that it was similar to brides maids, but that couldn't have been further from the truth.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great fun on the go, when you only have a minute, or when you have all day! They improved vastly upon the first temple run, with tons of new features. Upgrades, multiple characters, powerups, and lots more. The environment also looks better with way more diversity and variety. 5/5 stars, definitely recommend to any age group.
0425252868|3.0|An amazing incident in World War II prompted the author to investigate both sides of the pilots flying combat.  Makos includes the pilots youth, training and many details leading up to the incredible event.  The story is told so that ages 12 and up can enjoy it and learn a great deal that is not told in \\"history\\" books......by Jan Churchill/ pilot/author/military historian.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Recommend ... a good read.  Part of a Trilogy so looking forward to reading book two.  Like the option to have e-read download.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|...but we still need our Walking Dead fix! Thank you Amazon and Roku!<br />This show appeals to a broad audience. My in-laws, who are in their 50's and are &#34;horror adverse&#34;, will even watch this. It seems to have the right combination of human drama, scary situations and great effects to keep most people interested. The average person seems to identify with one or more of the characters and will wonder what they would do if put in that situation. It usually leads to a good discussion about what happened in each episode and what's to come!<br />I like that the writers are not keeping to the exact storyline of the comics/graphic novels. It keeps everything fresh and makes for a great experience!
1439153663|5.0|My mom gave me this book for my birthday in October and I chose it for our book club to read this last month.  There is no question this is an excellent choice for a book club.  There is so much to talk about!  Slavery, alcoholism, parenting, family dynamics, and abuse are all topics that you will be sure to discuss.  My book also had discussion questions at the end of the book.<br /><br />With this book set during the late 1700's and into the 1800's, and in the south, there are certain expectations and rules that you have to remember.  Plantations were isolated from the outside world it seemed and really were their own little country, running themselves and living off of their own produced goods.  Slaves were common and their treatment was often tragically ruthless.  What sets this book apart from other books of this genre is that Lavinia lives in the slave world but is white.  She sees herself as one of them and doesn't understand that there is a difference between the two worlds.  So, once her life with the slaves is uprooted, her whole world is turned upside down.  Lavinia was very naive as to the societal expectations and social obligations and because of that, this novel has many interesting twists.<br /><br />This book is told is alternating chapters between Belle, a slave in the kitchen house, and Lavinia.  The naive telling of the story from Lavinia's perspective is compared to the harsh telling from Belle's perspective and in this way you get the whole story.  There are many characters in this story and it may be helpful to keep track of them all and their relationship to each other while you are reading.  The family of slaves is large and ever-growing throughout the story.<br /><br />At times, the story is difficult to read due to the atrocities that happened both to the white son and the slaves.  As the story builds, you begin to feel both anger and compassion towards those committing the violence.  Unfortunately, the lesson \\"hurting people hurt others\\" plays out in this story in many, many ways.<br /><br />As the story comes to a close, you will be sitting on the edge of your seat, reading the words and flipping the pages just as fast as you can to find out what will become of the characters.  If you are easily emotional, keep tissues close by.  The writer has built an interesting twist in the story that begins in the prologue and ends in the last nail-biting chapter.plays out in this story in many, many ways.<br /><br />As the story comes to a close, you will be sitting on the edge of your seat, reading the words and flipping the pages just as fast as you can to find out what will become of the characters.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I read this book on a cross country flight and finished it it one siting. This is rare because I am a pretty slow reader, but I just loved this book so much. Tina's voice and personality really shine through.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I saw this as a featured app and downloaded based on the positive reviews. First impression on my kindle fire hd impressed me. It´s nice to look at, full of content, syncs to twitter and gives a nice alternative to getting your news. After setting it up, I was hooked. I even deleted Pulse from my kindle, as this is so much better... If it worked 100%.<br /><br />The problem is the app force closing randomly. The developer needs to issue an update quickly to fix this and make it work as intended. I recommend this app. Hopefully you'll have better luck than me. And hopefully they fix it soon. Still worth a download.<br /><br />EDIT: I emailed support and received a fast response with a fix for the above issue. After clearing the cache, the app is working perfectly. Updating review to 5 stars. Wonderful app.
B0074ALZ7Q|4.0|Lovely read..... Easy to pick up and get lost in the text. Lost a star as the ending was a bit disappointing!

B008XG1X18|5.0|When using my Kindle Fire to access Pinterest, I was getting the 404 error message every time I tried to access a website related to a Pinterest post.  After installing the Pinterest app, I do not have that problem.  Thanks for the app.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book is highly entertaining and funny.  It deals with a very sensitive issue and is a great chose for a book club to discuss.
B0048064PI|5.0|This album, like an extension of The Faces, is beautiful. Jeff's blues touch is excellent and where Rod sings, you've got liquid gold. It stands with the best of the British blues of that incredible era which is enjoyed by kids and baby boomers together, still to this day.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|Mark Wahlberg tooling around with Peter Griffin as a teddy bear.  Pretty bad acting. A few funny one-liners.  At least the leading actors work Mark and Mila.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I just received this mouse. Plugged it in, works great, the software that comes with it is easy to use. The weights are an amazing feature, as I prefer a heavier mouse, and mice of this price are usually pretty lightweight. My only issue with it, is when you change the color on the mouse, it just changes the color of the anker symbol, instead of all lights on the mouse. Overall a fantastic mouse though
B006WXHJNU|1.0|The movie is awesome, the picture is great.  The reason why I gave one star is the audio.  It is either 2 channel stereo or 7.1  Absolutely no surround sound with a 5.1 system.  Renders this purchase a complete waste of money
B005529EI2|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I EVER WATCHED AND THE BEST PART IS IT WILL BE IN MY LIBRARY FOREVER
B008QOFOQW|5.0|I like the product and I hope my daughter will too, she has asked for it a while back so I can't wait to see her open when she gets it for her birthday.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My husband could (has) spent hours playing this while on a car trip.  Kindle Fire works well to play it.
B00000EFFZ|2.0|I dont know whats going on, I purchased the two tapes, couldnt wait to hear them, I even cleaned my deck player. And it dragged all the way thru it too! A big bummer!
0811876373|5.0|My mom loves this book and enjoys using the ideas to make new ones. It's great to use this book for helpful hints and &#34;how to&#34;s.
B001P06GX4|5.0|My husband and I love playing board games and this one is our new favorite!  I would recommend it to anyone!

B005IEF27O|4.0|The main element I liked about this Primus album was the lyrics of the new songs. 'Eternal Consumption Engine' and 'Moron TV', particularly.<br />Musically, I felt the closer to 'Antipop', or 'Pork Soda', which in my view, are not Primus' best albums.<br />All in all, I would only recommend this album to other Primus fans, as it is a great album but not for everyone.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Another great story by rick riordon - hope he continues these stories for yet another series. Always happy to see the next one come out.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I gave Downtown Abbey a five rating because of it's story line and the acting, that is well done by every actor.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Remarkable movie by &#34;non-professional, non-Hollywood&#34;  Christian independent filmmakers! Packs a great message wrapped around a riveting story told with both dram and humor.
0525425764|5.0|I think these books are very good for older children.  I am a grandparent and I enjoyed reading them.  I have loaned them to other families and they enjoyed them, too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I downloaded this game for my son, but I pay it more then him. I am addicted. Love love love!
B009D5VNLS|3.0|I think I was expecting a movie more like the other Princess movies and was a bit disappointed. While I don't think the characters always need to have a &#34;happily ever after&#34; with a &#34;prince&#34; at the end of the movie, I felt like she had a super boring life before the story and she was just destined for a whole lot of more boring at the end. It was OKAY, but I really loved Princess and the Frog, Beauty and the Beast, etc. and I felt like this one just wasn't on par with those.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|G5 has made me a believer that you can get a great game for a less expensive price and not skimp in quality. I really need to find out what is G5 call symbol so I can own part of the company.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I really love this game. I bought it as a gift for my husband who loves playing board games and while I usually don't get too excited about them, I've played this with him several times already and I like it. I do want to get the expansion soon and I think the price on these is rather expensive.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Learning about events in WW2 from different perspectives was eye opening. We're usually only exposed to the &#34;winners&#34;<br />Can't wait for number 3
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't put down the book until the end.  Full of surprises at every turn.  I can't wait to start the next one and continue the story.  A great story for any age.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|This is a wonderful book on Exposure.  I think every person interested in photography should get this book no matter if you are a beginner or a professional you will learn something.
B00124BNF4|5.0|Always great to find digitally remastered versions of classic rock.  Awesome!  Awesome!  Awesome!  Awesome!  Awesome!  Awesome!  Awesome!  Awesome!  Awesome!  Awesome!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am very pleased with this Bible.  I can look up any Chapter or Verse very quickly.  Although the King James Version is my favorite, I can change to any Version that I want to for better understanding.
B0090P98Z4|1.0|After spending money and time to develop the game, it all just vanished today! So now I have to start all over again and just suck it up about the money I'm out? Well if that's supposed to deserve a star and a favorable review from me they can whistle for it. I have always thought it really disengenuous to give people a &quot;free&quot; game then make you spend money to get anywhere in it. It was fun for a week then Glu killed it.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|It was entertaining, but the most intersting part was...The younger fellow did a good job imitating Bruce Willis's facial expressions.
0671004107|5.0|The movie \\"Contact\\", based upon this book, is a good one...but the book (and I'm sure you've heard this before) is ... stellar! (little astrophysicist humor).<br /><br />It's engrossing and entertaining and definitely a PAGE TURNER!<br /><br />There are a TON of things left out of the movie (necessary for a 2 hour movie), and these details, for me, make the book great.<br /><br />Also the ending is MUCH more fulfilling than the movie. In the movie it's more of a nature of 'faith' dilemma....definitely not Sagan's message. In the book it's more of a 'fabric of space' ending...and I won't say more...no spoilers.<br /><br />Buy it, read it, if you like Sagan, you'll love it.
B000025JMP|5.0|I am an Elvis Presley fan and this CD had a few songs that aren't on all of his CD's. It came very quickly.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Movie review:<br />See IMDb. If you're looking for a boxset of this trilogy, I assume you already know whether you like it or not.<br /><br />Product:<br />Great price for what you get.<br />Box is thin, fits well in my DVD shelf, and is aesthetically pleasing.<br />Nothing is too cheaply made.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I looooove Once Upon A Time, I watch the first season on TV and now I own it on DVD! XD I just love having my own copies of this *amazing* show!
0345529057|4.0|Negatives:<br />It looks like the packaging of this product is rushed.<br />Some of the packaging was torn and there are small scuffs and dents.<br />I got my books out of order (Shifted to the left so that it was order like this: CoK, SoS, FoC, GoT.)<br />This makes me wonder if someone out there got a boxset with duplicate books, since shifting in an assembly line could do this.<br /><br />Pages are thinner than normal.<br /><br />There are complaints of missing and duplicate pages, though I checked my set and all books were fine.<br /><br />Positives:<br />For the price most of the negatives can be ignored! This set if very good if you're looking for something cheap.<br />If you want a set in mint collectible edition, get the hardbacks.<br /><br />If you have any problems Amazon will be happy to help you out.<br /><br />4 stars, -1 for rushed packaging.
B000V7J82S|5.0|This is a great album. I gave this album, Legend by Bob Marley as a gift for the holidays! Yay.
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|I downloaded this on my daughters tablet so she can practice typing her address & name... But after playing around with it myself, I think I'm gonna download it on my tablet to use it for writing..
B00866JL96|5.0|I enjoyed this video very much and consider part of my ever growing video collection.  Which is growing higher daily.
0765325950|5.0|This story is high fantasy at its best and most glorious.  All of our favorite characters, converging together, shifting the pattern of the wheel, and finally performing heroically as they should as I knew they would is just soooooooo very satisfying to me.  I really hate, with a passion, for this book to end and that this story is at an end.  Alas, all good things must end. It's a really good, fast, thrilling read.  Thank you authors, publishers, and mostly distributors for over a decade old joyride!!!!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun and addictive game...must play...once you start playing this game u cant stop n i love how it always have the different tours n scene settings
B0084BMUFA|5.0|never read. enjoyed readig on of the classics at christmas time. i like to read on my kindle now o
B0038P59A0|4.0|The movie is well done and entertaining. Good plot with twists and turns.  As well as a good mix of action and dialogue.
B00785P2QC|4.0|hours of entertainment! Cant put it down. Enjoy the new challenges and strategies. fun to try to keep ahead of!
B008OHV4PG|1.0|I thought that the DVD was an all regions disk. Not so!!! It does not play over here is Aust.<br />So I have no bloody idea if it any good!!!<br />Maybe the advert needs to spell out if is an all regions disk or not.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I would highly recommend this to anyone even better than the first temple run 2 is finally here.  With mining cars ziplines gems and spike wheels temple run 2 deserves a 2 thumbs up.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|my kindle has no problem downloading any apps but for some reason when I try to download. temple run or temple run 2 it says that their is an error. it only appears with these 2 games.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|This game is addicting but needs improvements.<br />1. No real money for gems<br />2. Less time to chop rocks(7hours is insane)<br />3. Skeletons don't come so often.<br />4. Earn gems when a tree rock or house is done.<br />5. Earn skeletons by a house being done.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great romantic book with enough action to keep you on your toes and wanting more. Definitely would recommend this book
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I recommend this book to a lot of people and what I liked most about it is that Gregory doesn't have a girl and then Rowley tells him about Abigail. What I didn't like was nothing.
B00006690F|3.0|The AUDIO cd was Cracked,few shards of Audio CD in the case even.But I kept it for the Bonus Disc (rare stuff :D)<br />but I found out I had a copy of the audio CD of this album (guess I lost it a year or two ago) the bonus dvd rocks same for the CD.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like it but it's not as good as other games I've had before -like I said in the title of this review:). The camera is kinda confusing but at least it does' t glitch allot lot :). As bad as this may seem I don't mean it to be hurtful to the creator of this game : This game sucks compared to the other house caring games I've played in the pass:(. That was advice to the creator of this game to MAKE THE APP BETTER:(:(:D;););) :&quot;
B00APJLFEG|5.0|You and the kids will love this movie. First time I could stand Adam Sandler.<br />I had a great time watching!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it is one of the best games iv ever gotten in my life. just from the the details it is the best ever
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun to play and easy.  You can upgrade to go to Rio.  Many different characters to choose from and many hover boards.  This game is almost like temple.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book I have read in a long time. Great for everyone. One of the better series I have ever read.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|While I do not like giving poor reviews, this one certainly merits it. I could not even bring myself to try slogging through books 2 and 3. What the generalized hype says to me is that the general public has mastered reading to about a 7th grade level and that waaaay too many house-wife types are completely undersexed.<br /><br />How many \\"billionaire\\" business men are going to fall for an innocent, straight out of college, naive soul (unless they are into that \\"daddy worship\\" crap)?  Show me a real Dom with that kind of financial strength, commanding good looks and the world at his fingertips and I will show you his choice of an experienced sub who knows what she's doing.<br /><br />Put down your teenage hormones and try a REAL book.
B004HV54TU|5.0|no rsi symptoms in my mousing hand using this. button functionality slightly different placement than their older product, which i use on my other computer, so that's a little confusing going back and forth between them.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is such a great book! The ending is unexpected, but brought me to years. I love the characters, Alex is so patient and kind and Katie is strong, brave as inspiring. I only hope that if I am ever in Carly's position, I can write the same letter. Can't wait for the movie!!!
B008NABUU8|4.0|Kept me intested for a long enough time...would have paid a buck or two...controls are somewhat iffy, but I would not say unplayable..s3
B005CWRB44|4.0|Pros:  small, light, affordable, multiple brightness levels<br />Cons: switching between brightness levels can be annoying at times.  As you twist you may get a blip where it contacts, causing it to cycle through the brightness, leaving you in a different mode when you get it screwed down the rest of the way.  The light looks great without a battery in it,  but with a battery the brass construction of the bezel shows between the head and body,  looks a little bit dinky.<br /><br />Notes:<br />I purchased this light to use primarily as a way of getting a little more life out of my 123a's that I use in pairs in another, more powerful LED light.<br /><br />Used batteries will give adequate, but nowhere near full light output for a reasonable amount of time,  so it functions well for this primary use.<br /><br />With a new battery, this thing is plenty bright, and having multi mode functionality is great to have,  if a little finicky(see cons)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very Enjoyable.<br />After the first 2 books in the trilogy, I just had to read the third. I was not disappointed.
B005SDB6RK|4.0|Was a xmas gift for my son. Those guys are great. good buy for any snowboarding lover. whats not to love<br />crazy tricks in exotic locations
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Just finished 'Sweet Tooth' by Ian McEwan....described perfectly in a Boston Globe review as a set of Russian nesting dolls.  What a great novel. I have read the bad reviews too, but honestly, I think they misunderstood the whole thing. Very clever writing.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Too much sex concerning unmarried young people. Plot was interesting and held my interest so that I did not give up on it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|well this app is really good for those long trips in the car. it keeps you entertained that's for sure.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was blown away with this book. If l had to pick my favorite character it would be Peeta. Amazing.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I did not think it was going to be challenging at first, but it came on gradually, and now it's great.  I feel like a plumber,  I guess.
B00B1OEP32|5.0|I am very impressed with how \\"Believe Acoustic\\" turned out. The music sounds great, and I can't stop listening to it, which is not something I can say about all of Justin's music. Here is what I like about the album:<br /><br />1. Sometimes less is more, and when you have just a nice voice and a guitar or piano, that is exactly what you get. Justin has a nice voice, and the guitar sounds are incredible. The music is real, and very pleasant to listen to.<br />2. I like a lot of the lyrics from his most recent album, but I didn't necessarily care for its sound. The style is just not for me, and a lot of the songs seemed to hold back how nice his voice sounds. On this album you can actually hear him singing, and it doesn't sound like \\"canned\\" music that was done mostly on a synthesizer.<br />3. I didn't care for all the collaborations he had (I want to hear Justin sing, not all the others), particularly Nicki Minaj. To each their own, but I personally have no interest in listening to music with swear words. Nicki said the b-word during her solo on \\"Beauty and a Beat.\\" Of course, that solo and swear word, along with all the other collaborations are not on this album.<br />4. To me, this music doesn't sound like \\"pop\\" music at all. It is very nice and pleasant to listen to, and the lyrics are also nice.<br /><br />\\"As Long As You Love Me\\" is by far my favorite song on this album, and I love the live acoustic version of that one as well. There is not a specific reason for that one being my favorite, other than it sounds great and the lyrics are very good.<br /><br />\\"Nothing Like Us\\" was a last-minute addition to the album, and is about his break-up with Selena Gomez. He wrote that song himself, and the lyrics are wonderful. It's from the heart, and has a mature sound to it. It doesn't have the \\"teeny-bopper\\" sound that some people might expect from Justin. I love the piano accompaniment, and the mood that the song carries. I will frequently listen to it just for the relaxing sound.<br /><br />Overall, I think this album was incredibly well done, and a wonderful display of Justin's nice voice. I lOVE the guitar, which I think is by Dan Kanter. (I bought the mp3 version) Justin said he wanted to draw in more fans with this album, and if he is looking to transition to an adult fan base he did an excellent job with Believe Acoustic. Well done Justin!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun game I have enjoyed it so far and am looking forward to continuing to play the game. Great job
B007EC27QM|5.0|I have searched for simple yet easy to use calculator that keeps history.<br />This is a great product. I definitely recommend this one.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|All that without sounding cheesy or overwrought & managing to be eclectically varied, true to his roots but at the same time, NOT confined by them and managing to evolve and move forward without crashing & burning...a major accomplishment when you think about it!!  This type of approach is usually done in Euro Powermetal with female opera-trained singers, in bands like Nightwish...this is the first time a similar approach was done with a classically trained male singer/songwriter in a mainstream arena.<br /><br />To be honest, this is actually the first time I fully listened to a Josh Groban disc front to back with an open mind, and I was pretty impressed.  I've always been aware of his stuff but never actually LISTENED to a full record...mainly because I was never really a fan of \\"popera\\" and his stuff was deemed utterly \\"uncool\\" to like...partially due to his original fanbase of grandmas and the lame David Foster connection...just being honest!!  But the REAL Josh Groban started to surface, the cool hipster with great musical taste in alt-rock bands and who was actually HILARIOUS and made fun of himself on Glee and The Office and fit in well on Jimmy Kimmel & Jimmy Fallon...like, yeah, I'd hang and have a beer with Josh but would I buy a JG record or attend a JG gig among the uncool soccermoms, grandmas and Fanilows??  Er, no.<br /><br />BUT then, he started to expand his music...first by collaborating with Rick Rubin on \\"Illuminations\\"...but the single came off as a bit slow and not really rocking...people seem to love it so I may give it a chance next.<br /><br />THEN I read about his direction on \\"All That Echoes\\", with Green Day/Muffs producer (and now Warners PREZ) Rob Cavallo, how he wanted to rock out, how it would combine his classical roots with more rockish production...drums are by Abe Laboriel Jr on a lot of this album (he rocks out with Sir Paul McCartney), some guitars by Tim Pierce (who jams with Rick Springfield and many others)...and the fact that Josh is a songwriter/pianist and co-wrote 7 of the tracks is a good thing.  The 5 covers are great choices...The Swell Season's \\"Falling Slowly\\" is a great song and his version rivals the original.  Stevie Wonder's \\"I Believe\\" is one of my all-time fave songs, not just my fave SW song, and his version is as good as Tina Arena's & George Michael's covers, maybe better than both.  He sings well in both Espanol & Italiano, his collaborators in Arturo Sandoval & Laura Pausini are welcome...the album flows well, it's not slow, and goes through different styles, from Coldplayesque piano alternative pop to Celtic rock, to dramatic symphonic rock balladry...not one song sounds the same, and takes you on a thrilling journey...being this disc was taken out of my local public library so I could try it out unencumbered by cost, I will buy the Target edition with the 4 bonus tracks...Josh, man, you made me a convert!!<br /><br />Is his music still uncool??  Not at all...he's graduated from uncool to \\"actually alright\\" and maybe a little cool, maybe a lot.  \\"All That Echoes\\" is not an embarrassing listen and actually makes me want to explore his other stuff...now, will it make me want to listen to Andrea Bocelli??  Don't think so.  But if ever I get to take Josh out for a beer and be his wingman, I can also tell him good job on \\"All That Echoes\\"...maybe on the next record, he can get even MORE eclectic, maybe going all goth dance punk a la New Order/Joy Division??

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The calculator is a nice addition to the kindle. I used the one on my iPhone before I thought to look for this one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Way better than the first one!! It is a bit more challenging and some of the effects play tricks on your eyes which just means you have to pay attention. I could sit and play this game for hours. New system for earning certain upgrades which makes it more interesting. All around an awesome game!!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|A very enjoyable entertaining read,  just a little disappointed with the ultimate deep revelations that seemed to be so pedestrian.  Still, the characters were fun to follow and I would recommend the book.
B000LTAY1U|2.0|Has some nice features for the money. Strap is narrow and short. Overall a small watch by modern means. Returned due to being too small for my wrist.
B007THA4FI|2.0|JK Rowling is a brilliant writer and character developement is exceptional.  Of course the Potter series is beyond compare and she is delving into different territory, but that being said this book to me was dismal and depressing.  I think her writing so far only seems to portray such darkness and despair.  I cannot name one character that has any likeable qualities nor am I sympathetic to what happens to any of them.  I completed approximately half the book and moved on to another,  I found that the prospect of an additional half of the book still to be read to be a burden.  I may pick up the book again at some point and hope that there is some brightness in the second half.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Entertaining game with plenty to do. This was an easy way to pass time. Even better...it was free! This is the closest I get to horses.
