B000089RVX|3.0|If you're something like me, then you're probably getting kind of tired of the same syrupy teeny-pop/rock stuff that seems to pervade the airwaves. This album certainly provides a fresh sound for stale music world! Despite some of the press it has been given, it is NOT Euro-Goth Metal (too poppy and light for that), NOT Nu-Metal (doesn't really fall into that formula), and NOT teen-diva pop music, a-la Avril. What you have here is solid slabs of guitars, strong yet beautiful female vocals, backed intermittently with male vocals (which happen to be my biggest gripe...the male vocals sound too boyish, like a refugee from a Linkin-Park audition, and don't contribute to the strength of the album). If you want some music with more meat on it, but still like it melodic, and want something different from the TOP 40 drivel, look this band up.<br />On a side note, I have seen some people write off this band as a sugary copy-cat of the Italian band LACUNA COIL. Here's the deal: That is flat out wrong. Lacuna Coil can kick Evanescence's *#&@ . Lacuna Coil has been producing this style of music since 1996: They know the game and they play it hard. If you like Evanescence, but would prefer something a little more adult, a lot darker, and a whole lot better, look up Lacuna Coil. LULLACRY, hailing from Finland, is not too bad either...Lullacry stylistically fits nicely between Lacuna Coil and Evanescence. If you like one of those bands, you'll love all three of them. Europe has a thriving rock/metal scene: check them out and you won't be disappointed! Check out these albums: LACUNA COIL - Comalies and LULLACRY - Crucify My Heart
B000021Y74|4.0|This is a good movie for learning German, since phrases are repeated from scenario to scenario. As for the plot:<br />Supposedly, the third and final scenario is the true one. However, this is the most unlikely one. Somehow, in a city the size of Berlin, Manni is able to find the same homeless man who has his bag of money, and Lola gambles and wins 100 thousand DM, all in less than 20 minutes. The first two scenarios, in which Lola or Manni resorts to robbery and Manni or Lola is injured, are actually the more likely ones. Perhaps RUN LOLA RUN is poking fun at how neatly things usually turn out in movies.
0345440900|4.0|This book offers a similar overall approach as BabyWise but with a much nicer philososhy and without the condescending tone.  We've had success with the overall approach - assessing what the baby needs, aiming for a loosely structured routine so the baby knows what to expect.  Her approach to the baby crying at bedtime (pick the baby up long enough to calm him down, then put him back down) is great and has worked wonders for us.<br />One caution: THE BREASTFEEDING ADVICE IS PRETTY AWFUL!  One sided feeding should not be recommended, especially when a new mom is trying to establish her milk supply.  So take that with a grain of salt.<br />If you can get past the &quot;mum&quot;'s and &quot;love&quot;'s of the &quot;English accent,&quot; most of the advice is good.
B000063K5W|5.0|Adapted from the hit off-Broadway musical of the same name is this tale of an \\"internationally ignored\\" rock & roll singer who hails from Communist Berlin and who dreams of becoming an American sensation. Hedwig (John Cameron Mitchell), born a boy named Hansel, is raised by a single mother (Alberta Watson) who wishes to see her son do better than his poverty-stricken family. Some years later, Hansel is attracted to a good-looking American G.I, who promises a better life overseas for young Hansel, under one condition: that he undergo a sex-change operation to become a fully functional female who he can then marry. The operation is seriously botched, leaving the now-renamed Hedwig with an \\"angry inch\\" only to be stranded in a dingy Kansas trailer park on the day the Berlin Wall comes tumbling down. Hedwig then supports herself through a series of ill-fated lounge gigs and side jobs, meeting up with 16-year old Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt), a religious type who befriends her and later steals her songs and becomes the rock star Hedwig always dreamed of being. Undeterred, Hedwig continues to perform in the shadow of Tommy's sold-out stadium tour, attempting to make herself whole in spirit, if not physically. The film features several songs by composer Stephen Trask, who also appears as a member of Hedwig's disinterested rock band; Miriam Shor portrays Hedwig's newfound love and back-up singer.<br />A mixed-bag effort to translate John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Trask's ambitious rock musical to the screen, this remains a worthwhile movie experience on any account, successfully opening up its heartfelt, often sad account of an \\"internationally ignored\\" rock singer suffering from a botched sex change operation. Mitchell's fierce, hypnotic performance is as indelible on film as it was on stage - fearful, hilarious and moving. His direction is a bit less remarkable, as the movie offers much to look at, but little of it comes through in quite the same way as the music. The filmmakers too often literalize what should be expressed musically, which robs the viewer of some of the discoveries that might have made the film more successful. A few stretches sag as well, but the movie springs to life the most in its final reel - when the title character takes on a young prot&eacute;g&eacute; (a quietly effective Michael Pitt) - even if it fails to fully reach its emotional mark. Audiences at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival clearly found Hedwig refreshing: it won the Audience Award as well as a Grand Jury directing prize for Mitchell.lmmakers too often literalize what should be expressed musically, which robs the viewer of some of the discoveries that might have made the film more successful.

B00006FDCD|5.0|Stephen King's It is the one for you.  It is a must have for your collection.  Very true to the book in many respects, It will keep you up at night as the book did.  The characters are played in this series just as they are written in the book.  While it is true that some liberties were taken with small details, it is also true that the taking of these liberties does not in any way detract from the spirit of the book itself.  Indeed, the portrayals of the characters brings a new life to the true horror which the book It inspired in it's readers.  the sound is Dolby Stereo, and the commentary seems to have ben cobbled together from two seperate recording sessions, yet, even these factors will NOT detract from your utter delight as you become totally emersed in this wanderfull work of absolute and brilient horror.
B000002V1D|4.0|I can't think of a band that's more '80s than Duran Duran, so it's ironic that the band released its most consistent record in 1993.<br />The song that brought me onboard was &quot;Ordinary World&quot;, a sweeping, dramatic orchestral ballad that features an unforgettable acoustic-guitar riff, a great, confident Simon Le Bon lead vocal, and Warren Cuccurullo's fiercest guitar work.  The album version on here is far superior to the truncated, remixed single version.  &quot;Come Undone&quot; had one of the most morbid yet memorable hooks of that year (&quot;Can't ever keep from falling apart&quot;), and &quot;Too Much Information&quot; features unusually self-aware lyrics and opens the album on a strong note.<br />Duran Duran may be best known as a singles band, but I think it made a great record on this one.  The band's output since then has been spotty, at best, but this disc is still a regular on my player.

B0000797IO|5.0|Jennifer Aniston proves here that she can move beyond her Friends persona.  This is a quietly disturbing drama with a few moments of comedy thrown in.  It defies any category, but that seems to be the writer's method.  He was responsible for the equally disorienting CHUCK AND BUCK!  Jennifer Aniston plays a bored cosmetics cashier in a small Texas town that dreams of something more, even if she has no idea what that MORE is.  In a strange series of events she becomes living proof of \\"Be careful what you wish for.\\"  The cast is great, and the story is moving even if it moves at the slow pace of the town she is living in.<br />Much has been made of the moral ambiguity of the film.  I think it captures a poignant struggle for anybody when they realize the choices they have made and begin to question them.  The ironic title adds to this ambiguity.  It's a movie about a moral crossroads where a girl has to chose what is right and what is wrong for herself.<br />The DVD includes full-screen and widescreen versions of the film, a commentary with the director and screenplay author, a \\"selected scenes\\" commentary with Jennifer (which clocks in at 15 minutes maybe), gag reel (mostly people flubbing takes and laughing), deleted scenes, and the usual lot of trailers and photographs.  Transfer is great!  It looks better than when I saw it at the theatre, but remember it's a low budget film with a purposefully low budget look.
B00008DDXC|5.0|This is the best Harry Potter movie yet, I loved Rupert Grint's acing, it made the whole movie. It scary yet Rupert found a way to make it Funny as well, It was so funny I started to cry. It's much better than the first, which was great as well. I'd recommend going to see this movie. You'll have to wait a year to see the third one but you can buy this one now and watch it as many times as you want to.
B000084HAJ|5.0|An absolute stunner! Crank it up in 5.1 and prepare to transcend. The video transfer's a bit murky, but the shots are well chosen and serve the passages smartly. It's an aural knockout, pure bliss!
0393317552|5.0|Jared Diamond attempts to explain why certain societies evolved faster then others and then conquered those civilizations that were less advanced then their own. This in and of itself is enough to make most people gasp, not only at his audacity for tackling such a complex subject but also for taking on one that is so sensitive. Diamond handles both areas of his subject very well. Guns, Germs and Steel is a great read start to finish and one that does not fail to disappoint. Diamond examines all human societies and attempts to remove racial arguements and stereotypes in explaining why some societies grew more \\"civilized\\" then others and then conquered others. Diamonds evidence is compelling and he does a good job of presenting some complicated anthropoligical concepts in a very readable fashion. I would recommend this one!
B000089A07|5.0|I had relatively low expectations for the prequel to 1991s Silence Of The Lambs but to my surprise, Red Dragon surpassed my expectations and in my opinion, a somewhat underrated and underappreciated movie.<br />The movie begins in a dark and suspenseful arena where Agent William Graham encounters the extremely evil and psychopathic serial killer Doctor Hannibal Lector. However, after witnessing the extremely disturbing scenes of grisly murders that took place in someones house though creates enormous emotional trauma in Graham that causes him to retire from the FBI but three years later, two families are slaughtered on the full moons and Graham comes out of retirement and goes into a hunt to stop the next murder of another family when the next full moon occurs in three weeks. However, the next target of the mysterious Tooth Fairy Killer is Grahams own wife and son, and to the dismay of Graham, the only one who can be able to help him stop the horrific wrath Francis Dolarhyde aka Tooth Fairy Killer, is Dr Lector himself, the same man Graham stopped and put away years before. However, Dolarhyde is also being assisted by Dr. Lector in his murder spree and is the main villain known as the Red Dragon. Dolarhyde though is approached by an innocent woman whose blind (loss of eyesight) and falls in love with him, or so it seems. The psychopathic tendencies of the Red Dragon are driven by a painting that brings back memories of his childhood where he was horribly abused by his grandmother and the mental illnesses that resulted and he shows the remaining human that still exists. Sometimes in a way, its hard not to feel at least a bit sorry for him.<br />I have to say that this movie had a wonderful and incredible cast and couldnt have been much better. Ralph Fiennes absolutely brings out the evil and extremely disturbed inner being of The Red Dragon. Anthony Hopkins wonderfully and cleverly portrays the disturbed mind of Dr. Hannibal Lector. Edward Norton was wonderful as William Graham. Quite frankly, this movie benefits from the excellent acting by all of the actors and actresses in the movie.<br />The movie has a ton of suspenseful and dramatic storylines and is a wonderful adaptation of the book and kind of replaces Manhunter from many years earlier. Red Dragon is just the forerunner to what was to come on Silence Of The Lambs. The movie kind of drags on a bit during the first 45 minutes or so but then really takes off from there and becomes an intense thriller. A definitely classic this film is!

B00008PW3Q|5.0|For the Bob Welch era fan...no this is not that anywhere near that sedate.  Lindsey Buckingham shows all his strengths on this great LP. He knows how to produce Stevie better than anyone. The chances he takes on guitar and production on these songs are truely wonderful.  Thanks Lindsey for not putting our aanother \\"Mirage\\" again.  I liked Mirage but it was safe....\\"Say You Will\\" is Mac at it's finest...taking chances.  I did miss Christine not singing...she needs to comeback.  SAY GOODBYE is the most interesting song Lindsey has written since Tusk.  This was the album that should have followed Tusk and the direction of Fleetwood Mac is Back! Bravo!!!!!
6300182266|1.0|In 1976 the sci-fi genre attained a new degree of respectability with the commercial and critical success of \\"Star Wars.\\"  It was a given that the show would be imitated.  \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" represents the worst of these imitators.  It almost single-handedly restored sci-fi's undeserved reputation for being juvenile and silly.<br />From the outset, BG cannot decide if it is being goofy or serious.  It centers on a war, with graphic destruction and the ever-present threat of genocide.  Protecting us from genocide are cocky young hot-shots with comic-book names like \\"Apollo\\" and \\"Starbuck.\\"  If the writers couldn't take the show seriously, why should the viewer?<br />It is pointed out that the battlestar represents the most powerful vessel ever constructed.  However, the heroes do not stand up to the aggressors.  Instead, they run away like frightened mice.  Who wants to tune in every week and watch heroes running away?<br />For the serious sci-fi fan, BG is an insult.  It represents everything that makes non-fans snicker at the genre.
0375751513|3.0|This cautionary tale of sensuality, excess, vanity, and self-love is slow-going for today's readers, used to a brisker pace of writing. The story is wonderful but could have been told in far fewer words; however, word count excess wasn't important in the era in which Wilde wrote and lived his own unique brand of literature, art, and life.<br />Wonderful witty, sarcastic and caustic writing of course, all being Wilde's trademarks.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I will try to write in this review everything you need to know to gain interest in the movie and to prepare yourself for a very new and original experience. I own and have watched Mulholland Drive seven times. Please, take my summary of the movie over other reviews because I am actually a film major in college and have a strong interest in psychology.<BR>   This movie is a new kind of mystery. While Betty tries to overcome her amnesia, other characters and events will seem unrelated, plotless, and confusing. The mystery is primarilly the viewer trying to figure out what is going on. There is a dream sequence in this movie. You will not recognize it until possibly when Diane wakes up. Wakes up which time, I'm not saying. I won't say when or for how long it\\the dream occurs, other than it is long. There will never be an explanation given at the end like in a traditional mystery. You must know all the pieces and put it together for yourself. Things, faces and relationships will at one point make a change. Compare the set up before the change to the ending shot that shows Diane with the lights on her, her hopes and dreams. You will understand how \\"desire for things to have been this way(my own quote),\\" makes sense out of the whole movie (with a few exceptions). Many don't understand the first Winkey's diner scene. Put together the first and second time you view it, along with the blue key and it's possible location when the job is done, and you will understand. This is a very complicated movie. Also, relate silencio or silence with the little people and the psychological state of (I won't say) at the end, and you will find the significance of wanting silence. As a last note, events of real life (which you only get a hint at) will show up in the dream. I have tried to give an understanding of the movie, without ruining the plot and taking away the suprises the movie has to offer. One last note, At the party, keep track of all the faces. I hope you enjoy a truly amazing,ground breaking, and nominated for multiple oscars (including picture and screenplay) movie. ENJOY!
B00005JLEU|5.0|From start to finish (and everything in-between) Spirited Away not only demands your full attention, but also captures you imagination long after the viewing is over.<br />I hesitate on calling this a *movie*...it sounds so cliche...so dull. This is a cumulation of a fantastic story...amazing art that tingles the senses...and a moving soundtrack. All alone are tributes to themselves. Together they form the masterpiece that is this film.<br />I do not review here often and when I do, I tend to score low. That said, I do not give this movie 5 stars lightly. Great film making is very much alive thanks to the talents and hard work of Miyazaki and crew.
0060926317|2.0|As I read this work there was a nagging feeling in the back of my brain that the whole thing was so familiar to me.  So very familiar. . . .<br />Then it hit me!  The Kin of Ata Are Waiting for You.  This book is a direct repeat of the same ideas that Dorothy Bryant put forth in her work of 32 years ago.  I have no doubt that Ms. Morgan is quite familiar with the earlier work.<br />While Bryant's portrayal of the symbolic journey of the soul is told subtly and with rich symbolism, Morgan has a tendency toward redundancy and heavy-handedness.<br />My advice?  Skip this one. . .read the real deal.  You won't be sorry.
B000060P79|3.0|Come on, people.  The way some of you talk about Simple Plan, you'd think they shot your grandmother or something.  Lighten up a bit.  And for once, quit all your godawful whining about bands not being truly \\"punk\\".  Who cares?<BR>That said, this album does have weak points.  The lyrics are sometimes unoriginal and often juvenile.  However, for a band that is in their late teens-early twenties, that is to be expected.  Remember, Conor Oberst is the exception, not the rule.  Their sound is often poppier than I would like, as well.<BR>However, this album does have strenghts.  The hook at the beginning of the much-maligned \\"I'd Do Anything\\" is ear-grabbing and catchy.  \\"Addicted\\" is a catchy tune, and, personally, I like the line \\"I'm a dick/ I'm addicted to you\\".  And the bassy groove on \\"One Day\\" is better than anything I've ever heard from NFG or Sum 41 or all the bands you people compare them to.<BR>Let's face it.  More mature listeners are not going to appreciate most of this album.  However, for a band targeting their sound at early teens, they do it well and they do it with style.
0060523794|3.0|The first part of the book, which covered Gerstner's background and decision to join IBM, read very well.  Unfortunately, the rest of the book lagged and didn't clearly address the actual turnaround.  Rather than writing about turnaround techniques and difficult decisions, he spent most of his time discussing corporate emails, giving a high-level overview of the industry, and describing general business observations.
B00008BRB5|4.0|The first 6 songs of Police's \\"Synchronicity\\" (A.K.A. The Father of The Dream of the Blue Turtles) are very interesting and catchy. The Title song, part I, is written in 6/4. The second part is a pop scream. But Andy Summer's \\"Mother\\" is the most amazing track in this CD. No questions asked.<br />It's enjoyable as a horror movie. And it's not about Jung, of course, it's about Freud. It's not a love song for a mom but a complain about girlfriends and wives trying to act like a mother when that behaviour is uncomfortable for men. It's simple, but it unravels a lot about middle-aged men's psyche.<br />\\"Miss Gradenko\\" is a Stewart Copeland song, but Sting sings it. It's about a boy who's in love with his sexy russian teacher. Another Oedipus complex presented. The rest of the songs are just pop-love songs dramatically enhanced with paranoia; delivered by Sting.<br />So this album is a good Police record, for sure. But still, my favorite Police tracks are in \\"Outlandos D'Amour\\", \\"Reggatta de Blanc\\" and in the \\"Message in a Box\\" collection -where powerful B-sides are hidden.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Everything about this DVD is worth the [money]. First and foremost, the director's cut of the movie is so good it makes you wonder why it wasn't released to theaters like this. The theatrical release was like a middle age Young Guns, but this edition of the film is a real character study. Now, they movie does play fast and loose with the facts, but hey, we are here to enjoy ourselves, and this movie does that. For all of you who appreciated Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday there are more scenes with him, and it will make you wish that he was the focus not Wyatt Earp. The second DVD has some great extras and a really good behind the scenes look at the movie. If extras are you thing you won't be overwhelmed, but you won't be very disappointed either. It isn't the most packed DVD, but it isn't baren either. It is a good look at the movie, and it makes you appreciate the film a bit more, which is what a good DVD extra should do. BUY THIS DVD SET!
B00007KWHO|4.0|There are many albums by many artists that, when compared to their other, more widely-accepted works, seem tainted or underdeveloped. Time And A Word is one such record.<BR>   When compared to the great albums Fragile and Close To The Edge, this IS almost complete [junk]. But if you listen to this with open ears and an open mind, you will agree with me that Time And A Word is a truly valid musical statement. Bear in mind that the album does not feature the signature sounds of Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman. This fact alone discourages many Yes fans. But Peter Banks and Tony Kaye are good at what they do, just not quite as flashy or inventive. (Or phenomenal!)<BR>   Oh yes, the songs. THEN is one of the coolest Yes songs ever conceived. Sweet Dreams is a great song that takes a turn for the stupid in the \\"come everyone together...\\" part. The title track is an apparent attempt at a hit single, cashing in on things that made hit singles: Nice hooks, simple structure, you can sing along to it, and LOVE. But it's just missing something.<BR>   The area in which this record is lacking is the recording/production quality. The drum sounds are flat and lifeless, which totally underplay Bill Bruford's compelling style. The entire mix sounds a bit cheap, with some wow & flutter and some nasty tape dropouts. Whenever strings and/or horns come in it sounds as if the whole rhythm section has been bounced down to one mono track to make room. The end of Time And A Word is particularly nauseating.<BR>   Bottom Line: If you can get past the bad recording quality and any comparison to more \\"established\\" Yes works, you will find Time And A Word a valuable addition to your music collection.
B00008972S|5.0|This is one of my favorite films of all time.  I won't go into the plot as so many others have.  I prefer to just mention a few of my reactions to technical qualities of the DVD.  First, I agree with others who have described the picture quality as excellent.  However, I must disagree regarding sound.  I think the quality of sound is abyssmal!  There's an awful lot of background hiss on the DVD, which I found distracting.  I also felt the dialogue of characters as well as sound quality relating to musical numbers was very &quot;tinny.&quot;  I wonder if there are any others out there who agree with me?
B00008J4P5|5.0|I've been reading a lot of these reviews and it's clear to me that people either love or hate this album. First thing I have to say is it's a 2 person band! Jack & Meg do everything! that's pretty dayam amazing in itself. Second, is everyone is entitled to they're own opinion and I appreciate that Michelle M. Ellis at least took time to listen and she may not get it YET but thats cool too, there are plenty of people who do. I luv the Stripes but I'm being honest this is NOT a TERRIBLE ALBUM! (jus so ya know) When you get down too it it's the purest form of music out there right now on cd, just voice and instruments even though it's true what RollingStone said \\"they sound like an army\\". I appreciate good music and you know what? I'm not a rock conniseur in fact, I don't like most rock out like that new metal and all those little fake \\"punk\\" bands but I liked this immediately and I like it more everytime I listen. at least just be like Michelle and give them a chance,& no need for \\"Pink Elephant\\" comments either thank you.
B000083E79|4.0|Is this disc copy protected?  I only own a mac laptop and an ipod, so I *have* to encode my music to my iPod if I want to hear music with good quality (etymotic headphones <grin>).<br />If someone's review could address whether they've been able to encode the cd, I'd appreciate it.  BTW...I haven't bought any new music in about a year because I can't tell which discs are copy protected.  The new discs that let you listen on a computer, but not encode won't work because my laptop speakers are [inferior] and the software to let you do it is windows only.  I *have* to be able to encode a disc in order to listen to it.<br />To those that say for me to go get a stereo....I can't.  I live in an RV and even thought it's a 40 foot diesel, there's no room for a stereo.  The coach only comes with a combo player that plays cd-rw/mp3 cds.  I'd have the same problem on the built in cd player as I'd have with my laptop.<br />All I can say so far is that it appears to be a great cd from what I listened to at my local borders.  Until I can find out about copy protection, I can't buy it though.
0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck was set during the Great Depression in CA.  In this book there are two characters called Lennie and George.  They are the two migrant workers, who had travel together and they want to save some money and buy a ranch of their own.  George is a small person, quick and dark of face.  He always takes care of Lennie and he act like a father to Lennie.  Lennie is a huge man and has a mind of a child.  He always gets into trouble.  Every time when Lennie gets into trouble, George always gets him out of the trouble.  Lennie acts like a son to George.  Will George and Lennie make their dream come true or will Lennies weak mind and strong body destroy their dream?<BR> The book Of Mice and Men is a good book.  I will rate it as four stars.  In this book, it has a lot of conflicts and events.  Also it tells us how important friendship is event if it is a very hard time.  Friendship will help you get through anything.
B000059ZLH|5.0|I want to start off saying that Dream Theater is one of the most original and superb progressive rock/metal bands in existencce.  Now I want to make clear that I read all of those reviews below stating that the sound quality wasn't the best.  Fans even gave the DVD one, two, or three stars due to the sound.  When I popped the DVD in I was too enthralled to focus myself on bad sound or the such.  I thought the sound was fine.  Seriously, no matter how good dvds aare now, you will NOT have the same quality as actually being at the show.  I know, i've been to concerts and seen concerts on dvd theres a HUGE difference.  And if you were a TRUE FAN you wouldn't knock dt becasue the sound didn't please you.  everyone cant be pleased i'm sorry to say.  Anyways, any band that can take a song over 74 minutes and stratch it into 90 minutes and still totally ROCK THE HOUSE is an awesome band!  They not only jam their way through that masterpiece but they play \\"Metropolis part 1: Learning How to live\\", \\"A Change of Seasons\\", and \\"A Mind Beside Itself Parts 1 2 and 3\\"  Plus pics and Interviews and stuff.  If your a true fan of Dream Theater, it is your DUTY to own this DVD, no matter what the uncultured, ignorant, other people say.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park has been showered with adoring fans (and nashing assailants) ever since the release of their very first single, One Step Closer from Hybrid Theory. Here was a band that took hints of rock, rap, pop, punk, techno, and even reggae, and stirred it together in a concocted brew that didn't taste like .... in the result. In fact, it sounded quite impressive. This sound was experimented with using more techno on the Reanimation project.<BR>     Now LP adorns the punned optimistic darkness of their sophomore release, Meteora, named after a rock formation in Greece. Meteora was released less than a month before the date of this review, and already fellow-reviewers from this website have been brutally attacking the effort, with less reason than they think. You see, these reveiwers don't even care for the genre, so how could they enjoy Linkin Park anyway? They can't read the music, and I figure, if you can't read music, you really shouldn't be trying to write (about) it, or rewrite it. Stick with what you know more about, people. Besides, if the band or the genre was dead, would all the most popular radio stations still be playing Somewhere I Belong after over a month since its first air-time? Honestly, all a genre needs to survive is for the people to like what they hear, and the people like Linkin Park.<BR>     Don't Stay, the opening track, surprises the listener with an intro that has its own track (Foreword), on top of immediate flaunting of the ensemble's strongest points (Brad's riffs, Joe's rip-roaring splits, Rob's back-beats, Pheonix's slap finger dances over nylon, and Chester's shocking range and pitch control in vocal fury. Most comparable to One Step Closer.<BR>     Somewhere I Belong, I'm sure you all have heard.<BR>     Lying From You is stylistically unique, overdubbing Mike's syncopated rattles with assistance from Chester, flashing a slower tempo that Rob makes sound like art, and Chester actually switching pitches quite rapidly for a more melodic overtone. This song is the album's highlight.<BR>     Hit The Floor doesn't quite sound like the hip-hop bounce that Mike Shinoda was hoping for, however it sounds just fine with impressive chord jumps on the guitar at amazing speed and with impressive accuracy, all backing up a good lyrical message.<BR>     Easier To Run, another highlight, exhibits a difficult time signature: 4/4, but slowed down to half the speed you would expect, yet this tempo is disguised by a 16 beat-per-measure approach with the high-hat on the drums, thus making the snare hit on beat 3, technically, not 2 and 4, making it \\"tasteful\\" as the producer would call it.<BR>     Faint shows a new side of Linkin Park to the world, with a really fast tempo: 135 BPM. That's the most gripping part of that song, however.<BR>     Figure.09 has another syncopated guitar rhythm with a normal sounding tempo, making it sound like the guitarist is doing all the work.<BR>     From The Inside is another side of Linkin Park, with a 6/8 time signature: a signature that I haven't heard since Creed's Bullets. A pleasant surprise.<BR>     Nobody's Listening has an interestingly ethnic sound to it, with the band's first introduction to a Japanese Shakuhachi flute over \\"basement tracks\\". It sounds interesting enough, although the words don't fit the verses and chorus together. The first verse is classic rap approach, explaining in a rap that he is rapping in a basement and rewinding the tracks to hear the best part again and again (in essence, it's empty and pointless) while the chorus complains of being ignored (one of the album's themes).<BR>     Session is Meteora's Cure For The Itch.<BR>     Numb is a track that shouldn't be there. There are too many other songs on the project that came before this song that said the exact same things but only in a better way. Specifically, Don't Stay, Lying From You, and Faint all are thematically identical to Numb. Basically, I was left thinking, Ok, you made your point, don'trepeat yourself. Nobody's Listening and Numb are my reasons for docking the only star I docked.<BR>     So, yeah, Meteora's a blast, and I don't know what everyone's problem is. They DID mature, they DID improve, and their words ARE relevant AND personal, and yes, even deep, without profanity. As a matter of fact, the combined Special Thanks from the two studio projects strongly imply that Chester, Brad, Joe, Pheonix, and possbily even Rob, all share a faith in God (definitely a plus). Mike may or may not believe, but he's never talked about it. The point? They know what they're doing. They ARE a good band, but like all good bands, someone just HAS to bag on them just so he could say he did, and hope people will think he's better than the fans who appear to be trapped. That's a pointless game to play. Stick to your genre and maybe then I'll listen to you guys.
B00008J4P5|5.0|They recorded this album in 2 weeks in London with recording equptment that goes before the Beatles time and without aid of computers.But not because they are trying to be cool or anything of the sort, but because they can. It was truly all The Stripes needed to make an outstanding album. Jack/voice/guitar/piano and Meg/drums/voice. I wasn't fortunate enough to pick up White Blood Cells, I'm 15 and didn't have the money.But I will always be greatful I have eLePHANT The Stripes' masterpiece. From the first song Jacks guitar takes you in and his voice steals whatever is left of you. Not to sound too corny but there is definately something about Jack Whites voice that is truly unique and amazing. The songs are very well put together but without polish,one of the good things about this album. I can't do anything else except to recomend this cd to you and hope that you won't regret it. You taking the time to read this shows that you have at least some interest in the Stripes so I bet you will like it. Now Go Support Them &amp; Buy The Album!! :)
B00006GFAB|3.0|If you are a KISS fan, you already have all these on either the original CDs/albums or on any number of collections. The only thing this set offers up to make it worth having over the others is &quot;Forever&quot; and Ace's &quot;New York Groove.&quot; (Forget &quot;God Gave Rock And Roll To You,&quot; ugh....)<br />What we really need is a single or double disc set that DOESN'T include songs from the classic KISS period. Start with &quot;The Elder&quot; and go to &quot;Psycho Circus,&quot; but please please please not another collection with &quot;Rock And Roll All Night&quot; and &quot;Beth!&quot;
B000002W9Q|5.0|This is a great soundtrack to an extrodinatry &quot;underdog&quot; film. The CD quality is awesome, the the main song on the CD - &quot;(I've Had) The Time Of My Life&quot; is great - along with the others. For any Dirty Dancing lover, this CD is a must have. &quot;Yes&quot; by Merry Clayton was made in the 1980's, but sounds exactly like a 60's Mo-Town hit - the purpose for the song. I give it five stars.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|My first memory of the Beatles is when I was five and &quot;She Loves You&quot; blared from the six foot cube of mahoganised monstrosity my dad called a &quot;radiogram&quot;. It was quite a shock to a kid brought up on &quot;Puff the Magic Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; <br />Listening to this album is like charting my childhood. Although I was too young in '67 to appreciate the finer naunces of hippydom (if there were any), I knew even then that the fab four were more than just a pop band, and I can vividly remember seeing them perform for the last time on the London rooftops. <br />Who knows what they might have gone on to do if they hadn't split up. But then again, maybe it is best that they did, and left us with this perfect collection of pop gems. <br />This is how a boy band should be. These guys didn't need to be manufactured, they didn't need anybody to tell them how to perform, and they didn't need anyone else to write their songs for them. From Lennon's snarl, McCartney's way with a melody, Harrisons' fluid guitar and Ringo's solid driving force, the combination formed a band that worked so well together that they might never be bettered.<br />My musical tastes may have changed since then, but if you were born before 1965, these songs will bring a warm wash of nostalgia that'll make you forget the subsequent fates of the band members....for a while at least.
0446310786|5.0|WHen I first heard we are going to read TKaM, my heart sank considerably. First, our teacher announced this is her favorite book of all times. Second, I absolutely detested theo ther books we had to read, Potok's The Chosen, for example. But when I first received the book and started reading, I was awed. The use of language and vocabulary weere stunning and remarkbale. THe book is brutally honest, using original profanities used at the time in 1935 Alabama, but that did not tarnish the brilliance of the book. The tension escalates during Atticus' defense, and resolves in a tragic yet credible ending. However, the book taught a lesson that we would never forget. <BR>What made this book special to me is the moments between Atticus and his children. The dialogues are witty and at times funny that made me laugh out loud (the second book in my 15 years to do that). The plot is slow moving, yes, but that built the tension and kept you at your seat through the 200+ pages.
0684859106|5.0|I have made several of the cakes, frostings and the brownies from this cookbook. I found the recipes very easy to follow and the results were better than local bakeries. It is important to remember that baking is like chemistry. The recipes I made were huge success with my family and friends.
B000001GGV|5.0|Pletnev's Scarlatti is merely dull and correct. Pogorelich's Scarlatti glitters with grace, freshness, intensity, joy. He is sensitive, mature, yet powerful, exhilarating without exaggeration. I appreciate this delightful CD, although I do not like Scarlatti nor any baroque composer. I like Pogorelich's Chopin Four Scherzi as well as his Mussorgsky Pictures at an Exhibition.<br />Ivo Pogorelich was born in Belgrade in 1958, studied at the Central Music School in Moscow and later at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory. He married his teacher, Aliza Kezeradze, a renowned pianist, who died in 1996. Pogorelich has won many competitions, but his fame sparked with the prize he did not win, at the controversial International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw, where a furious Martha Argerich left the jury in protest.<br />His debut at Carnegie Hall, his exclusive contract with Deutsche Grammophon, and his performances in all the great concert halls throughout the world have created a sensation. He supports young musicians. In 1993, the Ivo Pogorelich Piano Competition was held for the first time in California.
B00005JLEU|5.0|\\"Spirited Away\\" won the Oscar for 2002's Best Animated Film. It richly deserved this award, for it is by far the best movie of its type in years. It may not be funny like `Monsters Inc.\\" or entertaining like \\"Shrek\\", but for sheer beauty and artistic integrity, it's almost impossible to top. Since words, like any other medium, have built-in limits, you will have to experience it for yourself to see what I am saying. <br />Imagine this: A little girl is riding in a car with her parents. They are headed to their new house. Dad makes a wrong turn, and they wind up traveling along a dirt road which ends at what appears to be a deserted train station. Dad decides that it's really the entrance to a failed amusement park. He and Mom decide to go exploring, and the little girl, filled with trepidation, has no choice but to go along. After awhile, the little family discovers a restaurant that is still operating. The parents gorge themselves until they are turned into pigs. Suddenly alone, the child finds herself in a place full of witches, ghosts, goblins and other assorted spirits. Aided only by an unearthly boy, she must now save her parents and find her way out of this surreal place.<br />The movie was made in Japan by animation master Hayao Miyazaki and his crew. It became the highest grossing movie of all time in that country. The people at Disney bought the American rights and lovingly added an excellent English soundtrack. The company's marketing department apparently was at a loss as to how to sell such an unusual animated movie. It was seen by relatively few Americans in theaters. I suspect that this masterpiece will find its audience here via video and DVD.
B00000K19E|5.0|SF Movies have suffered from a lack of style in recent years. There's only so many times you can see Bladerunner or Alien ripped off cheaply before you start to get jaded. And it doesn't help that they keep casting muscular dolts with the intellect of a plank in violent revenge fantasies that do little more than ape the \\"Death Wish\\" movies.<br />So it's three cheers for The Matrix, the film that restored my faith in SF movies.<br />It starts with a bang, a chase across rooftops with some spectacular leaps that make you realise that wherever you are, it's not the world you live in.<br />Or is it?<br />Neo (or is that Neophyte?) is a programmer by day in a faceless corporation, and a hacker by night, searching for Morpheus, a shadowy figure who may hold the key to Neo's longings for a different world. Morpheus on the other hand is looking for a Saviour, someone who will come and lead the oppressed masses to a new Utopia.<br />Soon their paths cross, and Neo is shown the real world, a world that is not all he thought it to be. In this world everything is run by \\"The Matrix\\", a super computer that controls everything and everybody, body and soul. (Or, as the Oracle so succinctly puts it, \\"Balls to Bones\\")<br />Neo is removed from the system's influence, and is told he is \\"The One\\", the long-prophesised saviour who can remake the Matrix to his own will. He is trained in how to fight the Matrix defense programs (or \\"Agents\\".....software that takes the guise of super-powerful humans and can take control of anybody still hooked up to the Matrix)<br />To accomplish this he is given a crash course in martial arts in a manner that would be great if it were possible today (I can imagine the ads - \\"Learn Kung-Fu in thirty seconds....no philosophising necessary!\\") . Once he reintroduces himself to the Matrix's world the stage is set for some climactic fight scenes, among the best ever seen in cinema history.<br />To say more would be to give away too much of the plot, but suffice to say The Matrix is one of the biggest, most explosive, most stylish SF films ever.<br />It succeeds where lesser films fail by melding a hi-tech glossy look with martial arts battles familar to Hong-Kong film lovers, and overlaying the whole thing with a mythic plot of the Saviour who is slowly coming to realise his destiny.<br />Even the names hold a mythic quality to them, from Morpheus, the god of sleep who knows who is dreaming and who is awake, to Cipher who is not all he seems, to Trinity, the embodiment of child, mother and lover and finally Neo, the classic neophyte trying to find a path through the mysteries. The ancient Greeks would have had no trouble in following the basics of this story.<br />Reeves has never been better, portraying confusion and frailty one minute, strength and resolve the next. But it is Fishburne's movie....it is his presence that holds the whole thing together and keeps you rivetted to your seat.<br />All that and a shadowing of a peril coming to Zion, the last stronghold of the true believers, and we're all set up for a blockbuster of a sequel. I can't wait.<br />Couple that with an outstanding directors talk-over, and an ingenious \\"follow the white rabbit\\" extras feature that lets you cut in and view how any particular effect or stunt was achieved, and you have a DVD that's hard to ignore for quality, quantity and entertainment.<br />All that, loads of black leather gear, big boots and guns. What more do you want?<br />And any film that contains a clip of the cult classic \\"Night of the Lepus\\" is always going to be worth a look.suffice to say The Matrix is one of the biggest, most explosive, most stylish SF films ever. <br />It succeeds where lesser films fail by melding a hi-tech glossy look with martial arts battles familar to Hong-Kong film lovers, and overlaying the whole thing with a mythic plot of the Saviour who is slowly coming to realise his destiny. <br />Even the names hold a mythic quality to them, from Morpheus, the god of sleep who knows who is dreaming and who is awake, to Cipher who is not all he seems, to Trinity, the embodiment of child, mother and lover and finally Neo, the classic neophyte trying to find a path through the mysteries.

B00008PW3Q|3.0|This is not a bad album but there are several things that could have been avoided :<BR>Issue 1 - The album stretches over more than 70 minutes. In my opinion, less is better ! There could have easily been 8 songs eliminated to create an excellent Fleetwood Mac album. The tracks they should have kept are : <BR>Track 1 - A very nice opener from Lindsey<BR>Track 3 - A nice mid tempo number by Stevie<BR>Track 4 - Another great Stevie number with beautiful guitars<BR>Track 5 - 'Big Love' 2003 - Great upbeat song from Lindsey<BR>Track 7 - Stevie's title track - certainly the next single<BR>Track 8 - The excellent first single <BR>Track 11 - Classic Fleetwood Mac - upbeat - beautiful harmonies<BR>Track 12 - A very pretty ballad from Stevie<BR>Track 13 - Another classic Fleetwood Mac song from Lindsey. Wonderful !<BR>Track 14 - Possibly the album's best track - even better than the version they released on 'The Dance'. Definitely another top 10 hit for the band.<BR>Issue 2 - Lindsey Buckingham is clearly taking over on most of the tracks. While I think he is a great guitar player, his 'over the top' playing is getting a little too much at times.<BR>Issue 3 - Christine McVie is clearly missed. Her contributions to previous Fleetwood Mac releases provided an excellent balance to Lindsey's and Stevie's contributions. Unfortunately, Fleetwood Mac 2003 sound like a Lindsey solo album with some contributions from Stevie Nicks. Again, it's not a bad album, the production and musicianship is outstanding, but there are just some ingrediences missing for this CD to become a classic Fleetwood Mac album.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Not often do you see good animation movies these days.  This is certainly one of the few.  My daughters (7 &amp; 4) absolutely loved it, and so did we.  It teaches great values so often lost in todays movies.  Like one reviewer, I also thought it ended abruptly, but nonetheless, it was great.
B00008DDXC|4.0|HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS [161 minutes / Rated PG for scary moments, some creature violence and mild language]<br />\\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" is even better than \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\", although both movies suffer somewhat from their slavish faithfulness to the children's books by J.K. Rowling. This may not be the filmmakers' fault because, naturally,  no one wanted to disappoint the beloved novels' readers. Still, this decision prevents either movie from taking flight on its own. <br />In this adventure, Harry [Daniel Radcliffe] begins his second year at the Hogwarts School of Wizardry. Forces are at work to keep Harry from continuing his education. As an especially gifted wizard apprentice, he poses a great threat to those sorcerers who want to use their gifts for dark purposes. Aided by his talents and those of his best friends and fellow students, Hermoine [Emily Watson] and Ron [Rupert Graves], Harry investigates the chamber of secrets, a place so terrible that it threatens the very existence of the school. <br />As in the first movie, the young cast holds its own against such formidable veteran performers as Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Kenneth Branagh, and the late Richard Harris. <br />The set design is fantastic, and the special effects are better than those in the first installment. <br />Pushing three hours in length, the film might seem too long for children to sit through, but its commercial success suggests otherwise. Its real problem is that it contains scenes that are genuinely scary, especially for children with phobias about spiders and/or snakes. Otherwise, this is fantastic family entertainment.

B00005JM1Y|4.0|Johnny English is unashamedly a spoof on the James Bond series of movies, and hilarious with it! Movie promo \\"He Knows No Fear. He Knows No Danger.\\" He Knows Nothing. Rowan Atkinson delivers a very controlled performance of a character which is a hybrid between TV's 'Mr Bean' and his Insp. Raymond Fowler in the 1995/96 BBC television series 'The Thin Blue Line'.  Johnny is attached to MI5 and believes he has the suave, debonair Bond persona, even to the point of having all the Bond gadgets and driving an Astin Martin sports car.  In reality he is a bumbling idiot, adept at using the wrong gadgets and making the wrong decisions.  The role may have been created just for Atkinson and indeed, it is hard to imagine anyone else playing Johnny English with such finess.  The obligatory love interest is provided by Natalie Imbruglia (Australian singer/actress) as Lorna Campbell, the vixen, or is she?  The villain of the piece is John Malkovich as a scheming Frenchman, Pascal Sauvage, who has a penchant for the Crown Jewels and is the object of Johnny's disaster laden adventure.  Ben Miller is a brilliant foil for Atkinson's comedy, at times providing his own brand of hilarity in the role of Bough, the offsider to Johnny English. This is 90 minutes of sheer fun and provided the cinema audience here with some of the best comedy in years.  Predictable but a most hilarious romp.

Chicago isn't just a musical now it's a movie masterpeice , the cast are superb.<br />Renee is just adorable is Roxie and her voice is suited to the role, Richard is fantastic as Billy with his crooning voice and tap dancing he should of got an oscar nomination! and then Catherine .... She was made to be Velma this is her role no if's and's or but's an amazing performance and a very well deserved oscar for her.<br />All in all if you like musicals or even if you don't I think you will love it as much as I did. With it's great performances and amazing music you can't go wrong.
B00006F7S4|2.0|for the last decade Beck has been the iconic master of eclecticism. each of his albums brought a new mix of every possible musical influence under the sun. and they were all, in their way, fun. this music is post-modern funeral dirge music sung without any joy, let alone any sense of melody or hooks. usually i'm not one to chastise an artist for doing something different, for taking a chance. but to go from such a great, visionary producer to making this joyless, spare, and utterly ...tastic record was in my opinion a career misstep. i hope he gets back on track with his next album.
0553212478|3.0|Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is at once firmly in the tradition of the Gothic genre that was so popular in the eighteenth century and one of the first of the science fiction genre that was to become so important in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  It remains one of the defining works of both genres.  The mad scientist, tampering with Nature with disastrous results, has become a stock character of SciFi/horror.  As for the Monster itself, only Dracula rivals him as a horror icon.  So the novel is important for its place in literary history, but does it still stand up on its own merits as an individual work?<br />The first thing to say is that it is not the story you know from the Hollywood versions.  The scientist is called Frankenstein and he created a man; the similarity ends there.  All the details are different.  The novel is a strange, obsessive tale, complex in structure and rich in psychological symbolism.  The real, underlying themes are incest, sibling rivalry and the self-destructive power of guilt.  I will refrain from further comment on the story itself, because you are better coming to it fresh and letting it unfold.  In that respect, the Bantam Classic edition has an excellent introduction by Diane Johnson which however, is full of spoilers.  Read it after the novel itself.  Johnson's interpretation is along psychoanalytic lines which I normally find unconvincing but in this case I think are right on the mark.<br />The author's style is always competent, often elegent, but never sublime.  She is not the poet of the family.  We are offered lengthy word-portraits of Alpine landscapes that are clearly intended to transport the readers but in fact leave them prosaicly in place.<br />Not in the first rank of literature therefore, but so strikingly imaginative and replete with such memorable imagery that it is still worth reading.
B000085RTZ|5.0|I thought Karma their previous album could not be topped, it was beautiful melodic and had great guitar playing. When I got Epica and listened to it I thought it was great but not enough to beat Karma. The more i listend to it the more it grew on me. Now one thing is sure, it did the impossible it topped Karma. Let me explain, the songs on Epica are fast Melodic, very epic with some well placed slower moments like Wanderer. The guitar riffing on this album is superior and more present than on Karma. The finishing touchs and the production level seems also to be better. but what really changed my mind on which album was better was the fact that Epica had an incredible flow. The CD flows like no CD has ever done. Never a dull moment and not a single bad song, even though i'm not to very found of Helena's Theme i do see the necessity to the story they are trying to tell. Roy Khan's voice is better than ever, very powerful and transmits emotions with such ease. On Epica we hear a more versatile voice, like on &quot;a Feast for the vain&quot; were Roy is sorta acting. Keyboards are also more present in the majority of the songs, a good example being Center of The Universe which also features female vocals to create a better atmosphere. This band has been greatly progressing since the 4th Legacy and it seems to me that nothing will ever stop there acension!<br />RATING: 5/5<br />HIGHLIGHTS: all of them! although Center of the Universe, The descent of an archangel and On The Edge of Paradise are totally out of this world.
B000005ZGZ|3.0|Of the six Fugazi albums that I own, \\"End Hits\\" is my least favorite. It isn't a bad album, though, and has some worthy moments. The first three songs are great, as is \\"Five Corporations,\\" even though it is a little too similar to Iggy's \\"Lust For Life.\\" \\"Arpeggator\\" is one of Fugazi's best instrumentals, and \\"F/D\\" is a typically solid Fugazi album closer.<br />However, on songs like\\"Guilford's Fall\\" and \\"No Surprises,\\" Fugazi sounds like they are just going through the motions with no real intensity or creativity. \\"Closed Captioned\\" could have been one of the album's better songs, but it comes off as awkward and meandering, and \\"Floating Boy\\" is just irritating. \\"Pink Frosty\\" creates a cool mood, but seems underwritten and doesn't ever go anywhere interesting. \\"Caustic Acrostic\\" and \\"Foreman's Dog\\" are both enjoyable, but unremarkable by Fugazi standards.<br />If you are new to Fugazi, I reccomend buying \\"13 Songs,\\"\\"In On The Killtaker,\\" or their latest, \\"The Argument.\\" If you're a hardcore Fugazi fan, you'll want \\"End Hits\\" too, but it isn't an essential purchase in my opinion...
B000069AUI|5.0|I'm not much of a fan of this type of music. I love Radiohead, which you can call similar to Coldplay in some aspects, but other than that, I usually stay away from this type of music. Last year, I heard the song \\"Yellow\\" and it became one of my favorite songs, but I never got Parachutes. Then I heard \\"Clocks\\", and once again, I fell in love. So, of course, I had to pick this one up.<br />Wow. The moment I heard \\"Politik\\", I knew this was gonna be a great one. Song, after song, after song...each one was an outstanding listening experience. The piano-guitar fusion really caught onto me. Chris Martin's voice is beautiful, yet when it sounds off-key, it sounds better than any other singer's off-key voice. Something about it is haunting.<br />A highlight on this CD is \\"The Scientist\\". It is one of the best songs I've ever heard, lyrically and musically. \\"Clocks\\", as I mentioned earlier, was the song that made me get this CD, so I like this one of course. The back-up vocals in this song really make their mark. \\"Daylight\\" is another favorite. \\"God Put A Smile Upon My Face\\" is a song that when you get used to it, it becomes a favorite also. All of these songs are great.<br />This is easily one of the best CDs of 2002, and you'd be dumb not to pick this one up. Go on, go on.
0783225881|5.0|Field of Dreams is a classic baseball movie that any sports fan should have to watch.  Based on the novel titled Shoeless Joe, the movie follows Ray Kinsella who begins hearing a voice that tells him,\\" If you build it, they will come.\\"  The voice is Shoeless Joe Jackson.  Kinsella builds a baseball field in his cornfield, yet he doesn't really know why the voice is calling him.  The movie follows his journey to discover the reasoning.<br /> This is an excellent movie with an awesome cast.  Kevin Costner is his usual good self as Kinsella with Amy Madegan as his wife, Annie.  The people that steal the show are Ray Liota as Shoeless Joe and James Earl Jones as retired writer Terrence Mann.  Both men steal the scenes they are in throughout.  This baseball classic is must see viewing for any sports fan.  The DVD is very good and well worth the price.  The documentary about the making of the movie is very interesting.  Also, the ending to the movie will have you in tears. Just perfect.  Do not miss!
B000089RVX|5.0|I have always loved angsty rock, but could never find a female voice that really spoke to me until now.  Every song has a punch to it, real emotion that you can feel as palpably as if it were your own.  I strongly recommend this to...well, everyone, dammit.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I know everyone else has already said a lot about the dvd anthology, so I'm just going to say this:<br />If you are a Beatles fan, if you love their MUSIC, then buy this, just for the music if nothing else. It has a few gems, like alternate takes and different mixes and such that are just priceless! The videos of songs, and the music interspersed throughout the dvd are worth having. Of course the interviews and history are great too, especially some of the old footage from Liverpool and Germany and their early concerts in various venues. But it's the MUSIC that is the best!<br />If you have a dvd and speaker system that supports 5.1 audio, then you MUST have it. If you don't have 5.1 audio, you still must have it! (But think about getting a 5.1 audio system when you can. It really doesn't cost that much, and it's well worth it! The sound on certain dvd's like this one, is incredible in 5.1 digital surround sound audio!<br />This is one of the best dvd's in my collection. Much better than A Hard Day's Night.  I love the movie, and it sounds GOOD, but not nearly as good as this!<br />Now let's hope they come out with Let It Be, in 5.1 audio, soon!
B00005JLEU|5.0|I was floored.  I am not a fan of anime normally, but I found myself wrapped up in this movie until the end.  If you watch carefully, there are little dramas unfolding within the larger dramas.  It's funny, heartwarming, breathtaking, beautiful and leaves you with oh so many messages about the human will, perserverence and more..  I bought the VHS tape and promptly ordered the DVD.  Awesome!
0688172377|5.0|Cheers to Waris for writing her extraordinary life story for the rest of us to read!  It took such courage to write, but I am sure is going a LONG way to ease and prevent some of the suffering of African women/girls.<br />This book is a quick read (I could not put it down for 2 days) and shockingly memorable.  I have a new empathy and respect for the Somali refugee women that abound in the Pacific Northwest.  These women are undoubtedly fighters like Waris, and continue to fight private struggles that I would never have known about.<br />Thank you, Waris.
B000003WFB|5.0|Paul's arrangement of this masterpiece is clearly \\"the best\\". I wish it was available on dvd as the theatrical part adds a lot to the total enjoyment. I have seen it performed on tv and it is outstanding.
B00008H2LE|5.0|I was worried that Linkin Park would only put out a few awesome tracks on an otherwise bad album like most bands out there. I consider their first album, Hybrid Theory, a great album as a whole. I could just sit back, let the entire album play, and enjoy every track. I didn't know that they would do it again. Meteora is the same way. If you liked Hybrid Theory, you will love Meteora! There is not a bad cut on the album. If you like LP's heavier sound, skip to &quot;Don't Stay&quot;, &quot;Lying From You&quot;, &quot;Faint&quot;, and &quot;Numb&quot;. If you dig the hip-hop sound check out &quot;Breaking The Habit&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot;. I used to think that LP was a great rock band that added in the scratching just to create a different sound, but after listening to &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot;, I consider LP a group with some skills when it comes to hip-hop. &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot; is the jam!<br />The DVD is also worth the extra money. It is a great look into the making of the album, and at the work they put into designing the look of the album as well. Beware of poltergiests in elevator though! Watch the DVD to understand what I am talking about. West Side!<br />LP fans will not be disappointed!
B000021YQV|5.0|Every so often, a music group explodes with such a different and solid style that just about everyone who listens to it happens to love it. System Of A Down is one of these groups, blowing up with their 2nd official CD, \\"Toxicity\\". This CD is near-flawless all the way through and any fan of hard rock will fall in love with it quickly. The lead vocalist, Serj, has such a crazy sound to his voice that it really grapples you into the songs. All in all, SOAD is filled with very anti-regulation, rebellious, good hard music.<br />The album starts out with a very hard song, \\"Prison Song\\", which is sure to hit the listener hard with its lyrical content and sound. It's a great introduction to most of the material we will be hearing later on the CD. Following the first song are two great ones, \\"Needles\\" and \\"Deer Dance\\", both of which have hard choruses and flowing vocals by Serj. After these comes a pretty short song (barely over 2 minutes, but short songs are somewhat common to SOAD) but hard and fast. The drummer really kicks in and goes crazy on this song. Track 5 entitled \\"X\\" comes in a bit slower but just as solid as the rest... then Serj goes very fast on most of the vocals. Next is the single track that really hooked me to SOAD's newer sounding style (over their self-titled LP a few years back), \\"Chop Suey!\\". This was a huge radio hit and is one of those songs that you love listening to even though it's so mainstream. The vocals are really \\"chopped\\" up but all flow together, and the chorus is... well... \\"heavenly\\" I guess. Very angellic sounding, if that makes any sense. Awesome song.<br />The 2nd Half of the album is just as good as the first. And truthfully that does not happen as often as it should in music these days. Track 7, \\"Bounce\\", follows Chop Suey! up with a fast paced and *insane* song. Definitely the craziest on the album. \\"Bounce, Pogo Pogo Pogo POGO!!\\". Good song. Following that is \\"Forest\\", a semi-long song weighing in at 4:00, but possibly one of my favorites. It has a medium paced beat going with it as Serj screams after every line. At track 12, we come to \\"Toxicity\\", the title track and very deserving of this title. Slower paced and more instrumental, this is one of my favorites. Psycho is a pretty dark song and very emotional, with a screaming memorable chorus, \\"Psycho...Cocaine...Cocaine...Crazy!\\" in increasing speed. A really good cut. And the final track: Aerials. This was their 2nd single and the most mainstream sounding song with the exception of Chop Suey!. They made a badass video to go along with this slow song. Good lyrics, and good end to the album.<br />Overall, I was unbelievably impressed with the quality of the work that System Of A Down was able to produce with \\"Toxicity\\". It's much more mature sounding than their self-titled CD even though that is awesome work as well! The group really made their own nitch in the hard rock community with this release and it's going to be great to see what System can come out with in the future. GET THIS CD, PERIOD.<br />Overall Rating: 9.5 / 10avorites. It has a medium paced beat going with it as Serj screams after every line.

B00005J9M3|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys in 1990 apparently didn't see why a synth-driven album had to be soulless or contain redundant lyrics.  Here we have articulate songs involving multiple emotions which  just happen to employ the keyboard wizardry of house and techno music rather than, say, the acoustic guitar.  The mood here, however, isn't dancehall heat, but Welschmertz and ennui.  <br />\\"Being Boring\\" is a complex study in nostalgia.  It makes references to the tragedy of AIDS:  \\"All the people I was kissing/ Some are here and some are missing in the 1990s.\\"  The  PSB tackled this issue before in \\"It Couldn't Happen Here\\" and would again in \\"Dreaming of the Queen.\\"<br />\\"This Must Be the Place I Waited Years to Leave\\" describes the hell of British boarding schools.  \\"To face the Truth\\" is a beautiful study of adultery containing the neat double entendre \\"I daren't expose the proof,\\" referring both to evidence and a camera-wielding private detective.  \\"How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?\\" laces into egomaniacal rock stars (Somehow I think of U2), and \\"Only the Wind\\" catches an alcoholic in the midst of his denials.  Just by tackling smart adult themes, the album has far exceeded the expectations of the synth-pop genre.<br />And I think its second half is even better!  \\"My October Symphony,\\" whose wonderful music sounds like something from Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On?\\" updated for a 2003 chill-out disc, talks about a Russian composer's inability to write odes to a country going through the tumult of Perestroika.  \\"So hard\\" pits a pair of adulterous but wily lovers against each other, resulting in a witty piece of trance.  \\"Nervously,\\" with its synth throbbing like a beating heart, tells the tale of two young gay men stammering their way through their first thrilling but nerve-wracking flirtations.  \\"The End of the World\\" features a teen girl's tantrum and gently chides her for seeing a night without a boyfriend's phone call as cataclysmic; such is the perspective of the young!  \\"Jealousy\\" wraps things up with an ode to envy that builds like a Broadway production number.<br />All in all, this is far more intelligent than dance music has a right to be.  You can hear the influence of Depeche Mode, Erasure, and New Order here, but none of them captured the pristine beauty or glamorous sadness of this record.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is an amazing CD! You can read the other reviews to see why. This is a message to all those preps who refuse to listen to the CD because it was mistakenly labelled Christian when, in fact, it is not! Don't deprive yourself of a good CD! Listen to their message, it's an expression of what they feel! You people who were disappointed because it wasn't \\"Christian\\" probably believe Creed is Christian, eh? Well, listen to their music, they're not! Do yourself a favor, buy this CD and support Evanescence -- true musicians.
B0000457HB|5.0|I've always been a huge Barry White fan, but had forgotten just how many of his songs were true smashes and are as relevant today as when they were originally released. Equally enjoyable for me, were some songs that I had never heard and all I have to say is if song number 7 on the second CD does not bring a combination of laughter and a more than a little heat to your loins, then maybe you are not human... All in all, the collection is not lacking any important songs in the Barry White song book and truly merits a 2 disc set, which can't be said even about other favorites of mine who have done it before. Also, no true fan should be without the star-studded &quot;Secret Garden&quot;, which was a single off the Quincy Jones' most recent Grammy-winning CD or Barry's duet with Tina Turner from her &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; release.
B00005ATQF|3.0|JUST FOR THE RECORD: The Marines only drafted 4.9% of their fighting force during the Vietnam conflict.  Most draftees were in the Army (50.5%).  Although, there was pressure to volunteer so you could choose your branch of service, MOS, etc.<br />This film is not a realistic portrayal of the war in Vietnam, but it does illustrate Marine boot camp fairly well (from what ex-Marines have told me).  R.Lee Ermey is excellent as the DI (he was a DI after all), and Private Pyle's character's experience was interesting (even with the unplausable ending).<br />It is the war in Nam where the movie gets silly and stupid.  First of all, not every enlisted Marine was obsessed with sex and prostitution.  Second, the way these soldiers behaved in combat (especially the NCOs) does not jive with the way they were trained.  Third, the simple historical inaccuracies are troublesome and I am not a Vietnam war expert by any means.<br />Like many Kubrick movies, it gets wrapped up in the device and methods of filming versus story material.  Yet, this is probably on of the easiest Kubrick films to watch.  For that reason alone it is worth watching.
B000002KBU|5.0|This is Joni's best album.  Yes, I've heard them all.  Court and Spark\\" comes close, but it's a little less emotionally generous than \\"Blue.\\"  \\"Hejira\\" is too bleak; \\"Mingus\\" too experimental; \\"Ladies of the Canyon\\" too abstract.  In fact this may be the best pop album by a female artist.  It's up there in the narrow company of Carole King's \\"Tapestry,\\" Patti Smith's \\"Horses,\\" and Tori Amos' \\"Under the Pink.\\"  But it's better than all of them I suspect.  <br />It opens with \\"All I Want,\\" which catches the singer in a hopeful romantic mood.  \\"When I think of your kisses, my mind seesaws,\\" she affirms.  Read between the lines, this song is about a bond in the singer's mind.  \\"My Old Man\\" is next, an ode to an out-of-wedlock affair blessed with a flawless vocal.  The melancholy \\"Little Green\\" follows, a song about putting a daughter up for adoption in 1967.  As an adoptee myself in 1968, this song has special resonance for me.  \\"Have a happy ending\\" is what I hope my birth mom was thinking as well.<br />\\"Carey\\" lightens the mood just in time.  It's a tempting invitation to a gentleman friend from a wandering woman in a touristy beach town in the south of France.  She suggests one more rollicking evening at the bar before she moves on--Lord alone knows where:  \\"Let's not talk about fare-thee-wells now.  The night is a starry dome.  And they're playing that scratchy rock 'n' roll beneath the Matalla Moon.\\"  <br />\\"Blue\\" is a lament for the passing of the 1960s as they sober into the 70s.  In \\"California,\\" with its leaping vocal and infectious melody, the singer longs for her home state even while lounging in Paris, lovemaking on Mykonos, and partying in Spain.  \\"This Flight Tonight\\" catches the singer looking ambivalently at a longtime love affair.  She's leaving on a plane (for good?) but second-guesses herself.  By \\"River\\" she's back in Cali (which we learn stays green at Christmas) lamenting the loss of her lover, though it's clear she broke things off herself.<br />\\"A Case of You,\\" the album's finest song, looks back at that affair.  Even at this distance, we sense its power:  \\"You're in my blood like holy wine.  You taste so bitter and so sweet.  Oh I could drink a case of you, darling, and I would still be on my feet.\\"  The vocal is delirious, seesawing, gorgeous.  Its fusion of the erotic and spiritual is potent.  Mitchell's vital lyrics are the blood here, and James Taylor's guitar playing, sounding like Bach in the background, is the holy wine.<br />\\"The Last Time I Saw Richard\\" fast-forwards the scene.  An old lover of Joni's encounters her in a cafe.  He has given up romantic dreams and entered a dull practical marriage that has him drinking at night.  She's still a hopeful romantic, and points out to him that his jukebox selections show that he's still in her world more than he thinks.  But after he leaves, she wonders if his fate is hers too and blows out her candle, afraid to talk to anyone.  She is different.  She will hold out for true love.  The last line of the song, of the album insists \\"Only a phase, these dark cafe days, only a dark cocoon before I get my gorgeous wings and fly away.\\"  As the stately piano ebbs at the end of this lonely song, we're hardly convinced.<br />Simple and spare, these ten songs focus on Joni's feathery alto and poetic lyrics.  A ducilmer, a guitar, a piano accompany her quietly in this, a singer-songwriter's showcase.  Joni writes about herself as itinerant and restless, a young woman who wants to see the world but whose youthful enthusiasm is losing ground to adult cynicism across a series of romantic hard knocks.
B000069AUI|4.0|Coldplay is not Radiohead, and frankly I think it is unfair to compare the two bands. The only real similarities I can see between the two bands is that they both hail from the UK. That being said, this is a fine album. There are a few throwaways, like \\"Daylight\\" and \\"A Whisper\\", but the rest of the album is very good. The standout tracks are the title track, \\"Politik\\", \\"The Scientist\\", and \\"Clocks.\\" The first half of the album is really great, before things fall off a bit in the middle before picking back up on the last two tracks.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I am a big fan of the Harry Potter series so I am biased towards this movie.  The DVD offers a ton of great extras, such as walk-throughs of the Chamber set and a 'building a scene' featurette.  Did I mention the movie is great?  The first disk is dedicated to the movie, though it does have a nice summary of the first movie, in case you missed it.  The movie is great, by the way.  The first disk doesn't have any commentary tracks though, which is somewhat disappointing.<br />The second disk offers all kinds of options, like cast interviews, deleted scenes, and the aforementioned walk-throughs.  There are plenty of extras to keep you, or your kids, enthralled for hours.<br />As far as the movie itself goes, it runs fairly close to the book of the same name.  There are a few points where big fans like myself just have to grimace in pain.  I understand needing to cut some things out for time reasons, but I don't understand why Nearly Headless Nick was cut almost entirely from the film.  For those who don't know, he played a fairly important role in the second book.<br />Looking past this, however, the movie is able to stand on its own.  If you know nothing except what you learned from the first movie, or if you've never seen it, this movie provides a clear enough plot-line.  In other words, you don't need to have seen the first one to understand this movie.<br />Oh yeah, it's a great movie, but not as good as the firt.
B000060P79|1.0|This album shows no creative effort.  It obviously was made to please 12 year old teeny boppers, so little girls with braces can scream at them when they are on MTV.  The lyrics sound like something a 5th grader wrote.  What makes albums like this even worse, is that they get labeled as &quot;punk or emo.&quot;  This album is not punk or emo, it is pop.  While there is nothing wrong with pop music, there is something wrong with manufactured music.  There is nothing wrong with &quot;pop-punk&quot; music.  Bands like New Found Glory and The Starting Line have put out some very catchy albums.  The difference between those artists and Simple Plan is that Simple Plan put absolutely no emotion or art into their music; the whole album is very generic.  If you are not 12 years old, you have no business listening to this album.  If you are over 12, and you like it, then you obviously have no respect for music.
B00005J9M1|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums, and I became interested in one reviewer's idea that it's actually a concept album about leaving the closet for the gay subculture--and the joys and challenges that result.  I also love another reviewer's notion that the album may be big and brassy (bright orange and riveted like sheet metal; full of happy house hooks) but it's also soul-baring and vulnerable underneath.<br />\\"Can You Forgive Her?\\" catches our protagonist in a heterosexual bond but indulging in secret gay romps behind the \\"cricket pavilion\\" and the \\"bicycle stand.\\"  Titled after an Anthony Trollope novel, the music is spiky and sinister, as if to demonstrate the tumult of a conflicted life.<br />A wave of euphoria comes next.  Our closet case has his first real relationship.  He has never known such joy, and he reacts jubilantly, whipping off his clothes and dancing to Stavinsky.  Still, he clings to heterosexuality, claiming \\"I Wouldn't Normally Do This Kind of Thing.\\"<br />\\"Liberation\\" is the final acceptance of his gay identity, a string-sweetened ballad about the moment of realizing a real and genuine love:  a ride home with his beloved's head resting against his shoulder.<br />Our hero has accepted his sexuality but now must negotiate the difficult balancing act of any relationship gay or straight.  \\"A Different Point of View\\" and \\"One and One Make Five\\" recall the possessive lovers that have always been at the heart of PSB songs, including \\"To Face the Truth,\\" \\"So Hard,\\" and \\"Jealousy\\" from their previous album \\"Behavior.\\"  \\"Yesterday When I Was Mad\\" works as a double statement:  A lovebird at the end of his rope returning to the nest only because he gets lonely--and a certain duo (ahem) frustrated by the music business.<br />It's not mentioned, but I think our protagonist breaks up with his boyfriend; next, he moves tentatively into the gay subculture in search of another.  \\"To Speak Is a Sin\\" describes the eye-intensive contact of a gay bar.  \\"Young Offender,\\" whose chugging music features video game blips in the background, describes our hero's effort to court a delinquent teenager.  Their bond seems exciting but ultimately unworkable.  The stately \\"One in a Million\\" ushers our gay everyman back to euphoria.  He has finally found another OR is back in the arms of his previous lover after a handful of miscues.  <br />Our hero's journey has a happy ending, but the album ends ambiguously.  Covering a catchy disco song by the proudly gay 70s dance band The Village People leads to a potent statement.  \\"Go West\\" is a zesty singalong about gay flight to the freedom and \\"open air\\" of San Francisco.  In the hands of the Pet Shop Boys, who eschew boisterous baritone gang vocals in favor of Neil Tennant's faint fragile tenor, it becomes an elegy for those who came seeking freedom and wound up ambushed by HIV.<BR>This is foreshadowed earlier in the album by the lush \\"Dreaming of the Queen,\\" which claimed \\"There are no lovers left alive.\\"<br />\\"Very\\" is the only pop album ever made about specifically male homosexual themes.  And it's one of the gems of the synth-pop genre along with Depeche Mode's \\"Violator,\\" Erasure's \\"The Innocents,\\" and PSB's own \\"Behavior.\\"
B00005QXXO|5.0|This is the best live album I've ever heard.  The songs are more accessible here than they were on Kid A and Amnesiac.  I think it was a brilliant move on Radiohead's part to release this album to help people digest some of those songs and come to terms with the sheer brilliance of those two albums.  For example, \\"The National Anthem\\" and particularly \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" undergo remarkable transformations on this album that make them sound fresh, almost as if you have never heard them before.  \\"Idioteque\\" and the title track, in particular, have an incredible energy and raw power on these versions.  And \\"True Love Waits\\" is fantastic and only found here.  I just wish it had more songs.
B00005Y7AW|4.0|First of all, Rufus Wainwright is a singles artist.  His nice contributions to the \\"Shrek,\\" \\"I Am Sam,\\" and \\"Moulin Rouge\\" soundtracks should have clued us in about that.  This album has no thematic cohesion.  Let's admit that off the bat and enjoy these tunes as singles.  <br />Secondly, he's not a rocker, not even a folk rocker.  His best songs owe more to cabaret, Broadway, opera, and Tin Pan Alley.<BR>His clearest theme is gay hedonism, the high life, the hotspots.  As Liberace said \\"Too much of a good thing is...wonderful!\\"  Therefore, when he tries to sound macho--as in \\"Shadows,\\" \\"One Man Guy,\\" and \\"Evil Angel\\"--it belly-flops.<br />Third of all, his first album, which everyone on here drools over, seemed to me unformed and uncompelling.<br />Your warnings complete, I will explain why this album is, aside from its pedestrian stabs at rock, a fine effort.  \\"Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk\\" is a cabaret masterpiece, witty, mischievous, and lilting.  Its shift from a major to a minor key is as subtle as a brick, and that's the point:  It even enjoys its musical pleasures unapologetically.  This is a campy defense of \\"carpe diem.\\"<br />\\"Greek Song\\" is a beautiful sun-drenched tune.  One imagines a pair of young men motorcycling around Mykonos.  Its melody is inspired, and Wainwright slows his voice into a kind of longing.<BR>Wainwright's tenor, though frayed and flat at times, is a lush instrument.  It can hold a note, piercingly, for quite a spell--which casts a spell believe me.<br />\\"Poses\\" is clever, but \\"California,\\" a set of vivid observations about the state (which are apropos of nothing) is an instant classic, full of surfers, dripping air conditioners, and (!) Bea Arthur.  Even the middlebrow poesy of \\"The Tower of Learning\\" and \\"In a Graveyard\\" are saved by Waiwright's campy sense of fun.  Maybe he's serious; maybe he isn't.  Poses, you know.     <br />\\"Grey Gardens\\" and \\"Rebel Prince\\" are my very favorites, a terrific one-two punch.  \\"Grey Gardens\\" contains strange and lovely images about the risk of being in love.  Like \\"Greek Song\\" it doesn't always make literal sense, but more power to its beautiful mystique.  Perhaps it speaks a \\"foreign language\\" quite purposefully, since it makes reference to the Polish boy Tadzio whose language his adult admirer doesn't comprehend in Thomas Mann's novella \\"Death in Venice.\\"  A pederastic love song, I think, joining a recent trend that includes the Pet Shop Boys' \\"Rent\\" and \\"Young Offender,\\" George Michael's \\"Father Figure\\" and \\"One More Try,\\" and Underworld's \\"Born Slippy.\\"     <BR> <BR>\\"The Consort\\" is a nice slice of palace intrigue but is perhaps too earnest and plodding.  Much better is the naughty \\"Rebel Prince,\\" which follows Morrissey's gay yearning (\\"Dear hero in prison...\\") for a bad boy lover.  Its Quebecois camp is<BR>endearing, especially when (Why not?) it lapses into French for a few lines.  This is a natural mate to \\"Complainte de la Butte,\\" his lush French/English addition to the \\"Moulin Rouge\\" soundtrack.  That should have been the bonus song here, not the prosaic take on the Beatles' \\"Across the Universe.\\"  <br />A message to Wainwright's handlers and advisors:  Stop trying to give him rock 'n' roll gravitas and let him make the loopy campy delightful intelligent caberet music he does best.  I hope to give his hyper-ironic third album a 5-star review!
B00000J7SS|2.0|Miles is a genius, but every genius has a bad idea,and this is very surely one of them.  I'm petty sure he convinced this all-star cast of musicians to contribute through his rather weighty reputation, but that' no excuse for putting their stamp on this sonic disaster.  Listen to it once or a thousand times,it doesn't make any difference.  It just sounds like a group of patients all suffering from some degenerative neurological disorder who have been given unfamiliar electronic instruments for some type of bizarre therapy.<br />Every one of these guys has made some pretty incredible music on their own; I suspect some of the younger cats learned from this experience but that certainly doesn't excuse the sum total when it comes to this unbridled catastrophe.  Two stars for the pedegree of the performers, otherwise zero.....
0440237688|5.0|My Favorite Book. It is amazing. People who think the Holocaust never happened or that Anne Frank's Diary is Fake should read this!  Nicole Burns is thrown into the Holocaust, Now she is Jewish and Nicole Bernhardt. As the Holocaust rules her life, family and friends the love in her heart keeps her in good spirits. When even that turns for the worst she keeps trying to go on and help her sick little sister. As she goes on she comes face to face with Anne Frank. Suddenly she's thrown out of the past and into the present. Where she realizes the Holocaust changed everything. She finds so much about herself and about a girl who became a famous writer and broke a million hearts, the one and only Anne Frank. I recomend this for 11 and up. As a rating of 1-5 I'd give it a 7.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|This is a great 12 track album.  Unfortunately, it has 18 tracks.<br />There's some really good stuff on this album, but its mixed with tracks that definately should have been eliminated during the editing process.  Come. for example, should have gone...<br />This will go down as a reasonable come-back album, but definately not the same caliber work we were used to seeing from FM.  Christine McVie is missing and unfortunately it shows.  I hope that she will agree to collaborate on any future releases.  <br />I'm not sorry I bought the album, but it could have been better.
6305508550|5.0|This movie is absolutely genius in several ways. The first one being that it relates to us all. The viewer of this film doesn't even have to have worked in an office in their entire LIFE; they just need to have worked in some type of environment. You'll see plenty of familiar characters of everyday life. The second reason this film is brilliant is in its dialouge. The jokes are cleverly inputted and lead on to other jokes. You have to pay attention to the film and really be interested in what's going on. My third - and final - reason for being why this film is really good is simple: it's clever. This movie is terrific, fantastic, super, incredible, and just plain fantabulous. If you don't own this movie on DVD, you're just missing out.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Adherants of Stephen Malkmus and Pavement will enjoy this.<BR>The Flaming Lips succeed in poking fun of japanese cartoons in Yoshimi and One More Robot, which are both enjoyable to listen to nonetheless. And poking fun of Japanimation and the like is fine by me. The other tracks on the album are also representative of the Lip's notorious style; techno-pop-electronica. The songs are perhaps more enjoyable upon the second or third listening. The Lips are truly talented.
B00005JKJA|5.0|As with the ending of any David Lynch film, one is left hoping they give you time to absorb the underlying theme of the movie, before they start running the credits. Alas, at the end of Mulholland Drive I was trying to digest the nuances of the film which was not unlike taking the New York Bar Exam. If one has prepared for the bar, then it is simply a question of applying cognitive skills (round peg, round hole) etc. and assembling the pieces to create an interpretation of the plot and pass the exam. With Lynch, it's unfair to try and stay in his lane when dissecting the subtleties of his methods. It's a given that when you plunk down your money to view his films, there is no guarantee of viewer comprehension or understanding of where the film has taken you, once the lights go up in the theatre. Tying up loose ends with a neat pretty bow isn't in the cards where Lynch is involved. Mulholland Drive is no different. The casting is the best since &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. Watts is more than solid in her role, and certainly is an equal to her Aussie buddy Nicole Kidman. Ultimately the film will be dissected at every Tier 3 College Fine Arts Department for years to come, as it should. Just be thankful for the PAUSE button on your DVD player. Mulholland is clearly Lynch's best effort since &quot;Blue Velvet.&quot;
6304936303|4.0|Yes, the characters are walking cliches.  Yes, the plot is inconceivably irrational.  Yes, comedian Taylor Negron plays the top henchman.  But this is not a movie you watch for well developed cinematic storytelling.  This is a movie you watch for  fights, shootouts, jokes and lots and lots of explosions, and it delivers them so wildly over the top that you won't care about the absence of film craft.  Just check you brain, kick up your feet and enjoy the wild ride
B000089A07|3.0|The HOPKINS/LECTOR shtick is getting old.  Almost identical in content to 1986's MANHUNTER save the very beginning and Hollywood cookie cutter ending, RED DRAGON is merely there.  Manhunter was the better film and BRIAN COX deserves more credit for basically inventing the LECTOR character for film by paving the way for HOPKINS tour de force in LAMBS. Although both performances excellent, it was nice to see two different takes on the same psycho. The canibal has now pretty much been turned into a mockery of himself and the 'franchise' needs to take the vacation DR. CHILTON did.
8408038818|5.0|This is an excellent book to put it in a short and simple manner and that's it.  All other reviews in this page are saying the same so I am not going to insist and repeat.  Just one thing, read it as soon as it becomes available again out of Spain (in Spain one can find it easily)or when it gets translated to other languages.  I know it will !!  It'll also make a great amazing movie in the right hands.  Yes, it is a very entertaining book, with a twisted plot that's going to keep you awake until you finish it.  But it also has deeper things going on:  the father-son relationship, the love for books, and a very critical attitude towards the winners of the Spanish Civil War.  About the author, I can only guess this is just the beginning of a bright literary career.
B0000640RX|4.0|I'll admit it, I've got a soft spot for Sly Stallone.  More than just a talented actor, I would call him a talented filmmaker since he has written or co-written so many of his films in addition to directing some.<br />The Rambo series is Stallone's second best (can't top Rocky!).  Let me take a brief look at the films that comprise this trilogy.<br />First Blood:  An all-time action classic, somehow underrated these days.  This is a relentless piece of non-stop action that has served as a model for many other action pics.  Some call John Rambo's \\"breakdown\\" scene laughable; I call it one of Stallone's finest acting moments.  5 Stars<br />Rambo:  First Blood Part II:  Totally different from the first one, this film was highly immitated due to it's overwhelming box-office success.  Not nearly as effective as the first, it is more of a \\"guilty pleasure\\" as it consists primarily of Rambo blowing stuff up.  3 Stars<br />Rambo III:  As Stallone's physique hardened, Rambo's personality softened.  Sly has never been more chiseled, but he has turned Rambo into a nice guy who tosses off one-liners whenever given the chance.  Still, there is more story here than in Part II (even if the topical story lost a lot of edge by the time the film hit theaters, as the Russians had pulled out of Afghanistan in real life).  I prefer this to Part II, this movie went way over budget but the money is on the screen:  the action sequences will leave you breathless.  3 1/2 Stars<br />This set is a bargain, and if special features are important to you (they aren't to me) you'll be pleased to have the 4th bonus disc which is exclusive to this set.<br />One important side note, unlike the previous DVD release, Rambo III does NOT include English subtitles for the Russian language that is spoken in some scenes.  This is a significant error on Artisan's part, so consider yourself warned.
B00005JKDR|5.0|A very entertaining movie. A kids movie that will be enjoyed by the whole family. Rent it or buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B00005JLH2|5.0|I think there should be more movies about marching bands. I mean after all there are tons of movies about other sports, football,cheerleading,and so on.        I think marching band is just as much a sport as any other I mentioned. Marching band members put their own time in to put on an amazing show for people to see and hardly anyone appreciates it. They do not  get the respect they deserve.     That is why I'm glad somebody actually made a movie about a marching band, maybe if there were more movies about band as there are other sports it would be popular.  Overall, anyone who hasn't seen this movie.  Give it a chance, it's really a good movie. Who knows, maybe you will look at band in a whole new light.
B000000W6X|4.0|Many music fans believe Massive Attack's &quot;Protection&quot; has 'the curse of the second album by a trend-setting band&quot;. There's no question Massive Attack had changed music with their debut &quot;Blue Lines&quot;, we observe it even nowadays though most people are, unfortunately, not aware of it. In contrast to that, &quot;Protection&quot; is considered the least influential Massive Attack album and hereby is kind of a black sheep in the band's discography. When people talk about Massive Attack, they usually mention &quot;Blue Lines&quot; and &quot;Mezzanine&quot;. Let's look at each song on the album in particular and see if there's some reason behind the grave underestimation of &quot;Protection&quot;.<br />Protection: here's where the trouble begins. Well sung by  Tracy Thorn, interesting lyrics, nice chillout music. However, the song completely fails its job as the opener- no proper intro into the album's world, no invitation at all. You don't get hooked even if you try to. Not a good sign when the opener is the first track to be skipped.   3/5<br />Karmacoma: Let the show begin! Tricky's &quot;laidback tension&quot; contrasts 3D's melancholy and they flow into a beautiful chorus. &quot;Karmacoma- jamaican aroma&quot; spoken over a tune likely to become your favorite. One of the best songs Massive Attack ever released.                      5/5<br />Three:        Nicolette is a seagull cheerfully floating the blue sky to the melody of gentle waves: That's the image you get when you hear this song.                              5/5<br />Weather Storm: To me this track is meant to be a pause between the first and second part of the album. A piano aimlessly wandering over a repeating bassline. They could have done much more with it.                                                                3/5<br />Spying Glass:  Horace Andy's first appearance on the album. He does a vocal job impressive as ever, displaying rasta wisdom. However, the outro is way too long and takes the focus away.       3,5/5<br />Better Things: Excellent lyrics, touching vocals by Tracy Thorn.Groovy and effective: should have been the opener.                                                  4,5/5<br />Eurochild:  Tricky and 3D take over again.The song wins in intrigue what it loses in grandeur to   &quot;Karmacoma&quot;. The end of the Tricky era and hereby the last real rapsong on a Massive Attack album.                                                    4,5/5<br />Sly:            Nicolette's tropic warm voice blended with dramatic strings and lazy drums: an outstanding mixture!                                                   5/5<br />Heat Miser:  The best instrumental by Massive Attack.Irresistibly moving.                        4,5/5<br />Light My Fire: Good live cover of The Doors' classic. Intended to be a hot goodbye kiss.             3,5/5<br />In my point of view, &quot;Protection&quot; is exactly the opposite of the band's latest work &quot;100th Window&quot;. It's nowhere as homogenous as the  new album or even &quot;Mezzanine&quot; but it has a bunch of standout tracks like &quot;Karmacoma&quot;, &quot;Sly&quot; and &quot;Eurochild&quot; that make &quot;Protection&quot; a Massive Attack essential.
1402545355|2.0|This \\"mystery\\" was placed in with the adult literature at the bookstore.   It really is geared to about 5th or 6th grade with the exception of some discussion of almost explicit sex.  I'm not sure of the author's intent, but the story and the writing was not of the complexity for an adult.  I might rate it higher if thought intention was to gear for children, with a warning about the sex inferences.<br />The story is set in Botswana.  A middle-aged woman starts a detective agency and investigates the regular cases that a detective agency would investigate.  No complex crimes, etc.  The woman is pretty simple and leads pretty simple life.  She solves the cases by using common sense, kind of like you would expect in Tom Sawyer or from Dear Abby.
B00008DDSC|3.0|Granted that SECRETARY is indeed \\"original\\", since it captured the \\"Originality award at Sundance 2002, Steven Shainberg presents a most unconventional love story, if it can even be termed 'love'...Well, I suppose so.<br />Maggie Gyllenhaal, the female counterpart of the dynamic bro/sister acting powerhouse that is Jake and Maggie, stars in her first truly breakthrough role as the emotionally withered waif Lee who works her way from the bottom up at a seedy law office run by vulture-like Edward (James Spader). Things look innocent at first, then the sensuous romp really begins, when Ed forces Lee to deliver papers on all fours, play \\"horsey\\", and don various S&M devices. Sexual pleasure, or merely a kindered spirit? Just another working girl? Maybe. Eventually, Lee is torn between obssession and mediocrity in her would-be fiance, played by Jeremy Davies. <br />While \\"Secretary\\" is no lightweight, it may present some viewers with issues of moral contridiction. What is true love? Is it always the most pure and innocent of heart, or the one who will best foster our needs, be they inane fetishes or no? Perhaps Shainberg is too hellbent on creating psychological depth in character, or in the case of Ed, not enough of it.  I would love to give into the conclusion that Ed and Lee live happily ever after. But while Shainberg molds his characters convincingly, he forgets a helping of heart and compassion, which seems stiffled and repressed. <br />What's wrong with innocence and love? Nothing apparently, but I guess bizarre fetish and sado-masochism goes a lot farther. Atleast that will keep your peepers on the screen for the hour and a half that is \\"Secretary\\". Kitchy, nostalgic colors and tones in the production values, and Gyllenhaal's powerhouse pormance compensate for a lack of charm just barely.
B00003CXFG|4.0|Pitch Black somehow managed to slip past me in it's original theatrical release, but the good word-of-mouth convinced me to buy the DVD. My original impression of the film turned out to be pretty much true: John Carpenter's \\"The Thing\\" meets \\"Alien\\". A diverse group of people are marooned on a desolate planet with three suns. One of the survivors, Riddick, (Played by Vin Diesel) is a mass-murderer/serial killer. The planet is inhabited by nocturnal, light-sensitive creatures who feed on human flesh....Luckily, the three suns force the Aliens to avoid the surface. Unfortunately for our hapless survivors, they've arrived just in time for a once-every-22-Years Total Eclipse....Is that the dinner bell I hear ringing....? And what's the bigger threat: The carnivorous Aliens or Riddick...?<br />  What sets Pitch Black apart is it's smart script. There are quite a few twists and turns here. Heroes who aren't so heroic, villains who might not be all that bad, a couple of unexpected deaths.....The effects are good, but don't overshadow the generally fine acting. Diesel did a good job as Riddick, but I did have to rewind and use the subtitles a LOT to catch some of Riddick's lines due to Diesel's mumbly delivery...<br />   The DVD has footage not seen in theaters, 2 seperate commentary tracks, theatrical trailers, production notes, cast & crew bios, a totally dopey \\"Pitch Black Raveworld Event\\" (20 minutes of people dancing while clips from the film play in the background), and a teeny-weeny little making-of featurette that clocks in at less than five minutes. Even though I'm not generally a fan of Vin Diesel's, if they do make a Riddick-based sequel, I'll be first on line....
B00008PW3Q|3.0|I've always been a fan of Fleetwood Mac, but not so much Stevie Nicks in a solo capacity.  This album needed more Christine McVie to offset the Stevieness.  All of the Nicks songs seem a little too much like her eighties solo work, meaning I've heard it all before.  They are still good songs but nothing in comparison to Lindsay Buckingham's work on this album.  By far the most stand out track is Steal Your Heart Away which is the cleanest most upbeat single-ready hit on the album.
0688163173|5.0|Dennis Lehane has a way of creating a setting that does half the work of telling his story without his having to hammer home the themes. Patrick and Angie's familiar and familial home turf and Mystic River's divided neighborhood in transition are now joined by the creepy and isolated Shutter Island of Lehane's new novel. Once protagonists Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule set foot on the island to investigate the escape of a female patient from the asylum/prison housed there, you know they're in trouble and you're in for a whale of a thriller ride. Inescapably surrounded by ocean, electric fencing, and too many guards, Teddy and Chuck ride out a hurricane in a place where it's difficult to distinguish the inmates from their keepers.  As always, Lehane's characters are pitch-perfect, from his lead investigators down to the various orderlies and patients who play fleeting roles. Teddy's and Chuck's dialog is snappy and funny, even as the mysteries within mysteries evolve to induce maximum paranoia and confusion. This is a terrific book that will leave you scratching your head and wondering why you didn't see the ending coming.
B00005YW4H|1.0|After all of the awards I decided to give it a listen, then again a few days later. Still what a snooze.  There are two ok songs but all sound the same and they would make great elevator music.  The tempo is so slow and I think I heard one up tempo part of a song.  This is a classic case of the record label or awards show trying to build an artist.  It would have been fine for her to win a couple of awards but not the volume she did.  You can't tell me there aren't other good musical talents out there or was she the only one for the entire year.  What a slap in the face of the awards shows staying open minded.
B00004WG2F|4.0|'Legends of the Fall', is indeed a film title that brings a sense of fear and drudgery into the hearts of men across the globe who would inadvertently label this epic 'a chick flick'. Add this to the fact that the film stars none other than hollywood's finest - Brad Pitt - and one may assume that their preconception was accurate. However, what we are delivered is an epic tale that contradicts all previous misconceptions.<br />Legends of the Fall[LOTF], depicts the tale of 3 brothers, their father, an indian tribal family and a lady, set in the late 19th early 20th century. Indeed, this does not sound very interesting , but as the story unveils through an excellent and engrossing script, LOTF shines from many other hollywood incartions as a film, where thought has been applied, rather than millions of dollars on overused special effects. <br />The strong story is backed by some truely delightful performances form Hopkins and Pitt, and this coupled to the brilliance of Quinn and Osmond, produces a very believable tale, hypothetically of course. The cinematography employed in LOTF is nothing short of spectacular, and if watched properly on a large screen, envokes a sense of depth which is truely breathtaking at particular points. The score is strong as all epics should be and helps add depth, but may be overworked at points.<br />However, some parts of the story are less believeable than others, and im sure this will be resonant from other critics of the film. Examples include the war scene death ritual, and the journey scenes by brad pitt, and this adds a fictional aspect to a film that, at points, exhibits characterstics of a drama. This bipolar discontinuinity is sometime frustrating and almost non-sensical, but overall does not disrpute the course of LOFT. <br />In essence LOFT is a well crafted affair that will be rememebed either for its brilliance or for its length. It is not another mindless film where everything is corrected at the end and all characters exudewith happiness, but rather an engrossing tale, which when rememebered will be thought of favourably. <br />Overall, definetaly a film to watch, especially if you have a night free and wish to be qietly surprised<br />A.Roy
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|One thing in the movie that caught my attention besides the acting was the soundtrack. This thing truely captures the emotion and sadness of the film. If your familiar with Nine Inch Nails material, i'd say most of these songs are reminscent of The Fragile instrumentals. Although there are only 4 main music sections and they get repititive in your mind you can actually picture the scene that is occuring at the moment. I might be a little ashamed to say this and i might be editing this review very soon, but just hearing the opening \\"Summer Overture\\" i literally balled my eyes out crying just remembering the pain and torture that the characters went to.

0156027321|5.0|Quite simply, I could not put this book down.  I was obsessed with the next twist of the plot.  It's kind of like Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea meets Kingsolver's Prodigal Summer.  From beginning to end I completely lost myself in this story.  When I started getting close to the end, I  slowed my reading so that I could savor every second of it.  When it was over, I was sad. This is the best book I've read all year.
0385507755|5.0|Read this book.  Frey takes you on a compelling, focused, stalwart climb from his near fatal collapse (literally and figuratively) to a peak of acceptance of and control over himself.  Ranging from despictable to noble, funny to serious, depressing to uplifting, the thoughts, emotions and acts presented in the book are a treat.  Plus, Frey's pulsating style of presentation enhances the impact of the book's powerful substance.  I was left wanting more.  I eagerly await another window into Frey's transformation and the addictive mind.
B00003CXXM|5.0|a thrill-a-second spy movie with some of the best fight scenes and car chases around. Matt Damon and his brilliant co-star from Run Lola Run are spectacular in their performances. The story is at least half-way believable and the action keeps you gripped from start to finish.<br />Highly entertaining film!
0671027387|3.0|After the first few chapters of Deception Point, I imagined a reworking of the Preston/Child idea used in their techno adventure \\"Ice Limit\\".  As in 'Ice Limit', there is a meteor, a team of scientists, and an odyessy where things go wrong because of misguided yet fiercely intense men and women whose behind-the-scene personal agendas leave the rest of humanity something to be desired.  But 'Deception Point' departs from 'Ice Limit' at this point and carries the meteor story into the political backyard of the presidency, an inscrupulous candidate and Washington's aggressive internal mechanism of disclosing information to the public at highly critical and crucial moments to gain the most spin and clout available.<br /><br />Using short chapters and multiple points of third person point of view narration, Brown weaves an interesting story that albeit formula, still keeps the reader engaged.  His characters are merely conduits for the fast action story, so don't expect any masterful renderings in this department.  Do, however, enjoy Brown's skill in seeding his purely imaginative story with enough of today's politics and headlines to satisfy and refuel even the most die-hard conspiracy theory disbelievers.  Sadly, I see this novel becoming a movie of the week thriller with less than believable characters attempting to flesh out Brown's already thin creations---hopefully this will not happen--this genre like Preston and Child's works should remain within the pages of a fast-paced novel where it works best.<br /><br />Recommend for all those who want a fast read that will engage during a day at the beach or a long plane flight.
0783225881|5.0|Ah, just one of many quotable lines from the movie -- from being &quot;guests in my corn&quot; to &quot;Is this Heaven? -- No, it's Iowa&quot; to the famous tagline, &quot;If you build it, he will come.&quot;  This is easily in my top 10 favorite movies of all time.  The haunting music, cued at just the right times during the movie just drives home its poignancy.  As stoic as a guy tries to be, if there's a bit of love for baseball or for his father in him, the line where Kevin Costner says &quot;Hey... Dad?  Wanna have a catch?&quot; just produces such a swell of emotion, it's hard to contain.  Truly outstanding performances by Costner, James Earl Jones, Ray Liotta, Amy Madigan, Burt Lancaster and Frank Whaley as the young Archie Graham make this movie one of my very, very favorites.
0385504209|4.0|This book is, as noted before, as a &quot;Can't put it down!&quot;. However, I felt I was just going through the motions.<br />Don't get me wrong, it was a good read. It just seemed like d&eacute;j&agrave; vu all over again. Langdon is woken up in the middle of a night with a phone call and is instantly running around Rome and now London again solving ancient puzzles and fighting secret societies.<br />Again, using historical and present-day reality brings a sense of urgency to the book. But what happens when Brown runs out of secret societies to write about?
0060194995|4.0|I liked the novel because it was about a town that was poor in wealth but rich in life.  The worked hard for their money and didn't squader it for lifes pleasures. <BR>   To Kill A Mockingbird follows three years in the life of eight year old Scout Finch, her brother, Jem and ther father Atticus.  Who defends a black man who is accused of raping a white women.<BR>   Like the slow-moving occupants of her fictional town, Lee takes her time to the heart of her tales.  First, we meet the Finchs the summer before Scout's first year at school.  Scout, her brother, and Dill Harris, a boy who spends his summers at his auts in Maycomb, while away, he spends his time reenacting the scenes of Dracula and plots ways to seek a peek at the town bogyman, Boo Radley.  In the bigining what it boils down to was that the alleged rape of Mayella Ewell, the daughter of a drunk and violent white farmer, barely gets through to the children's conscious.  Then Atticus is called on to defend the accused.  Tom Tobinson, and soon Scout and Jem find themselves caught up in events beyond their understanding.  During the trial, the town exhibits its ugly side, but Lee offers plenty of counterbalances as well dealing with an eldery woman's problem, the heroism of Atticus, and finally Scout's hard-won understanding that most people are essentially kind \\"who you really see them.\\"  But turns funny, wise, and heartbreaking, To Kill A Mockingbird is one classic that continues to speak to a new generation and deserves to be reread often.<BR>   Like I earlier stated I like this novel.  I like the way Lee blends everything together and makes everything to story easier to understand.  This novely with no mildew on its magnolia leaves, a funny, happy novel written with great precision.  To Kill A Mockingbird is about conscience- how it is instilled in two children, Scout and Jem Finch and how it operates in their, Atticus, a lawyer appointed to defend a Negro on a rape charge.  This is what I love about thenovel, the lessons it teaches us, the lessons that we can take with us for the rest of our lives.<BR>   I like how Lee combines two of the most common thesis of Southern writing-child's recollection of life  among people in a small town seemly untonched by the twentieth century adn glaring in justices of racial prejudice to create a comtemporay American classic.  It seems as though it could happen in real life back in its day.  Everything seems as though this could really be a story based upon truth.<BR>   I would recommend this book definitly to anyone who can appreciate a good book.  I enjoyed reading this great novel in my spare time, so you know it must be worth reading, knowing how much i read this must be a good book.  I would definitly recommend this to anybody and will probably read it again someday when i'm in the mood with for a book that will make me smile.

B00005JLH3|5.0|I can say that I lived in the exact same way and relived my years of being in a historically, nationally acclaimmed black band. It brought great joy to my heart to see my friends in the movie also. Its so sad though that Morris Brown lost its accredidation. Oh well though it was a great movie!
B00007JVBI|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing. As a fan of Chan Marshall, I always find her voice, lyrics, and melodies to be haunting, beautiful, unique, and just brilliant.  i think songs like &quot;Speak for me&quot; and her hypnotizing ballads like &quot;I dont blame you&quot; are masterpieces in any genre or age.
B000088E6M|4.0|I'm not the biggest fan of rap music, and I have to admit that my initial reason for buy this CD was for the song, \\"In Da Club.\\"  However, I was pleasantly surprised by many of the other songs on the CD, and I'm more apt to listen to those songs rather than just \\"In Da Club.\\"<br />50 Cent in a refreshing addition to rap music whose songs not only make you want to dance but also make you feel many emotions - something that doesn't seem to happen very often with rap music.<br />I would definitely suggest buying this CD if you want to listen to something different. Also, don't let the feud between 50 Cent and the Murder, Inc. crew sway your decision. Just buy the CD for the music and not the drama.
0385504209|5.0|THE DA VINCI CODE has been #1 on the best seller and as I write this it has already been reviewed exactly one hundred times on Amazon. Thus, after summarizing the plot, I will attempt to make this review as helpful as possible by briefly discussing the author's four books, comparing the plots, and describing and analyzing his writing style in summary fashion.<br />Harvard professor and symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to the Louvre to help Captain Bezu Fache of the Paris Judicial Police unravel the clues surrounding the body of the murdered curator, Jacques Sauniere. Sophie Neveu, a police cryptologist soon arrives, and it almost immediately becomes clear that it will take their combined skill and knowledge to follow the trail laid out by Sauniere before his death. As they attempt to uncover the hidden secrets of The Priory of Sion (a real organization that is hundreds of years old and has included as members Issac Newton and Leonardo Da Vinci, both of whom figure in the story), their search leads them to several Paris locations and eventually to England. Of course, others are also on the trail, including Captain Fachu, a huge albino monk, and an unknown formidable opponent who appears to be the only person in possession of a complete overview of the puzzle which they are trying to solve. The story combines history, murder, intrigue, wordplay combined with cryptanalysis, romance, religion and art. These elements are combined in such an incredibly captivating way that the pace never slackens as you are constantly being bombarded with both new facts and puzzles to solve. (I only solved one of the puzzles before Langdon and Neveu, and it is the one on which the author gives the reader some help.)  The pace is fast and the narrative has several threads which merge to provide a surprising and satisfactory conclusion.<br />This is Brown's second book involving Robert Langdon. My review of ANGELS AND DEMONS (Amazon 4/1/03) provides a detailed overview of that book. While this is not a sequel which requires that book to be read first, ANGELS has additional background regarding Langdon's character and academic specialty which made this book more enjoyable for me. Both involve religion, art and symbology, and both a have well researched and accurate historical basis. Thus they are superficially similar. However, ANGELS has three significant differences. First, it assumes further scientific advances and takes place in the future while DA VINCI takes place in the current day. Second, philosophical questions regarding the frequent conflicts between religion and science form the basis of the story and are the basis of some of the best passages in ANGELS. The philosohical implications of the mysteries involved in this story are just as complex but the discussion is much less profound. Third, in ANGELS the conflict among the various religious factions of the Catholic Church did not go the heart of the basis of Christian beliefs but rather to the existence and nature of God, the questions raised by this story are much more profound for Christianity. (This factor accounts for some of the  critical reviews.)<br />A common element in all Dan Brown's books is the very compressed time frame in which the stories occur. The tension is heightened by a race against the clock as an integral element of the nature of the various adversaries; this technique helps to make the stories real \\"page turners\\". In DA VINCI, the complete story except for a short epilogue incredibly takes place within approximately twenty four hours, yet the pace seems true to the events. (In order to give you an idea of the compressed time frames Brown utilizes, this is roughly double the time frame of ANGELS.) Both DECEPTION POINT (his third novel) and DIGITAL FORTRESS (his first book) also utilize this technique.<br />All the author's books involve extensive knowledge about the subjects involved, which is always imparted in a manner that keeps the reader's interest. Thus, they are for the reader who wants not only fast paced action but intelligent and absorbing fiction, a very different genre than the also enjoyable best selling James Patterson (at least until THE JESTER, see review of 3/15/03). DECEPTION POINT involves computer hacking and introduces the theme ofcryptanalysis which is revisited in DA VINCI. DECEPTION POINT involves science, oceanography, NASA and politics, unfortunately it veers into implausibilty.<br />In summary, Dan Brown knows how to keep his readers' interest. While each of the four books can be read independently, I would recommend reading ANGELS (available in paperback) if you only have time to read one or before reading DA VINCI. DIGITAL FORTRESS is an excellent first novel although not as polished as the later works. The subject is more specialized and probably won't appeal to as wide a range of readers. DECEPTION POINT is well written but  had the only conclusion that disappointed me  thus is not as highly reccommended as the other three novels.hey are for the reader who wants not only fast paced action but intelligent and absorbing fiction, a very different genre than the also enjoyable best selling James Patterson (at least until THE JESTER, see review of 3/15/03).

630460291X|3.0|If you want to see a great rousing Robin Hood film, get the Errol Flynn version.<br />If you want to see a wickedly funny Sheriff of Nottingham, get this version and fast forward to any scene with Alan Rickman.<br />You don't have to be a great actor to be a great Robin Hood - see Errol Flynn above - but you have to bring some panache and some style and some fun to the role, none of which Kevin Costner seems capable of doing.  His accent (or lack thereof) is the least of his problems.  Rickman out-panaches and out-talks this bland bugger to such a degree that you'd almost feel sorry for Costner if he weren't so mind-numbingly smug.  Was there ever a more clueless Robin Hood wandering around Sherwood Forest?  The only reason Costner, and not Rickman, is left standing at the end of the movie is that hundreds of years of Robin Hood mythology (and the producers) demand it.  But in acting muscle and sheer charisma, Rickman just flattens the other guy.<BR>Costner should stick to baseball; he's out of his league here.<br />Although there are some other talented folk here (Morgan Freeman and Mastrantonio), Alan Rickman and Geraldine McEwan (who plays the old hag) seem to be the only actors who recognized this 'epic' potboiler for what it was and decided to give it some gusto. <BR> <BR>This is Rickman having some fun at the expense of a mega-ego Hollywood bore, and what the hell is wrong with that?
B000066NW0|4.0|Starts off with some great tracks, Complicated, I`m with you, but that is all screwed up by teenage angsty tracks like Skater Boy which personally does not work for me.  She has definitely got talent and its pretty easy to listen to but only a few songs really pull me in
B00007CVSH|4.0|This performance was filmed on May 3, 2002 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. It was Mr. Hvorostovsky's first outing as Count di Luna. What a Count di Luna he was. His singing of di Luna made the usual baritone villain come alive with such passion.(Hint: the best sung cabaletta of the night was not \\"Di quella pira\\", but \\"Per me ora fatale\\". Masculinity personified.) Nowadays nobody can convey complicated emotions through singing more eloquently than Mr. Hvorostovsky. It was so evident in this performance. Just for this reason alone, this dvd is a must. But the dvd has much more to offer. There was a very well sung but rather restrained Azucena by Yvonne Naef. Her voice was strong and beautiful. Ms. Villarroel got points for her efforts. As for Mr. Cura, his vision for Manrico was \\"Latino macho man\\". Well, Mr. Cura succeeded just as that. He forgot that Manrico was also a poet. Even after countless viewings of the dvd, I still cannot control the urge to shake Leonora to her senses. Maestro Rizzi's tempi were on the fast side, so it made the opera sound more like a fast paced action \\"movie\\". Overall, the opera was very exciting to watch. (Expect some little surprises in the production.) I showed it to people who did not watch operas and the responses were very positive. The quality of the dvd is excellent. Both the sound and pictures are very clear. Of course, it comes with the extra features. Bravo to BBC-Opus Arte for an excellent job bringing this dvd to us. I hope someday someone will produce a dvd of \\"Eugene Onegin\\" with Mr. Hvorotovsky as the cad. Please do this soon before Mr. Hvorostovsky moves on to all those juicy Verdi roles.
B00005JL96|4.0|This film is a new breed of Disney. I enjoyed most of it and found it very cute not to mention the fantastic watercolored backrounds that gave it that extra paradise feel to it. <br />Why four stars? i thought the begging was kind of strange and at the ending is sort of streched a bit. <br />Overall: fun and beautiful to look at.
B00008DDXC|4.0|I gave this movie four stars because the acting wasn't the best, and some of the effects just looked fake. The plot was pretty good  as you probably know already.  Neither the game, the photo galeries, or the self guided tour were much fun. You just say left  right or enter. There just aren't many great special features. I would reccomend buying it if you have seen the movie and want to own it, not because of the special features.
0385312083|5.0|Slaughterhouse Five is excellent!  No other book has dealt with a subject like war in such a humorous manner.  Kurt Vonnecut writes about a World War II prisoner of war, Billy Pilgrim, who time travels throughout his life.  Billy is trying to find the meaning of life through the fractured pieces of his life. Though these time travels can be a bit confusing at times, they are an excellent basis for the book.  The reader is able to travel with Billy from the time he goes to war, to the time he becomes a feeble, moderately old man. Vonnecut's writing style is so superb that the reader feels like they are time traveling as well.<BR> I find the Tralfamadorians to be quite funny.  Billy's trip on a flying saucer allows the reader to escape from reality and have a good laugh.  I think the Tralfamadorians have an amazing outlook on life and time.  They believe no one ever really dies but continues to live in the different parts of their life.  I often find myself hoping this idea is true.<BR> After the trip to Tralfamadore, Billy believes he knows the true meaning of time.  I find I often get frustrated with Billy for believing in such an idea and making himself out to be a fool.  However, I do think Billy creates his own world to escape the memories of the detrimental bombing of Dresden, Germany. This artificial thought gives Billy an insight that helps him deal with his need to know what life was about.<BR> This book must be read!  It was truly one of the best books I have read.  It is extremely well written with the right mixture of humor and seriousness.  I believe there is a hidden meaning in this book that only the reader can experience.  I would recommend this book to anyone!
B00008977N|1.0|I have bought this dvd a 2 different stores...the DTS format on the sound did not work properly. I have a brand new Kenwood Vr60-70 with 6.0 THX, Dolby, and DTS and at first thought was there was something wrong with the dvd player and receiver but this was not the case. It was the dvd's and was probably was the manufactior of the product.
B00000JCB2|4.0|Although Significant Other is a better-than-average album, it lacks something that Three Dollar Bill Yall possessed: great sound.  Sure, a fair number of these tracks are awesome, but unlike their debut, a few are quite bad.  Their lyrics are still very good, but their metal edge seems to be fading.  This release, particularly the song Nookie, seemed to put Limp Bizkit on the music map.  But overall, I think this CD is more mediocre (in the face of rap-metal) than excellent.  Nevertheless, songs like Break Stuff and Just Like This are still good Limp Bizkit songs that are among their best.  Heres a rundown of the 15 songs:<br />1. Intro - ?/5 - less than one-minute introductions dont usually do much for CDs.  No exceptions here.<br />2. Just Like This - 3.5/5 - I am surprised that this track never made it big.  It has great potential as a hit; as the lyrics and music are somewhat reminiscent of the debut.  But the weird alien-like sound heard midway into the song takes away from its magnitude.<br />3. Nookie - 4.5/5 - you really have to like this song.  Its just so weird and out-there that even if youre looking for approachable, real lyrics you can still enjoy it.  As I said, it made Limp Bizkit a HUGE band.  But still, its not the best song on the album.<br />4. Break Stuff - 5/5 - this is the song thats most alike their debut.  Its edginess and almost comical words make it classical, though its not too radio friendly.  Theres no question this is the best song on the album and one of Limp Bizkits best... ever.<br />5. Re-Arranged - 3/5 - I actually think Re-Arranged is pretty average.  For Limp Bizkit at least.  Its an intriguing song and does separate itself from the rest, but the lyrics are common and, in the end, so is the music.<br />6. Im Broke - 5/5 - definitely, this is a hidden gem on Significant Other.  The music is similar to Break Stuff, which might explain why its so good.  Its about (if you cant imagine) lending someone money and not getting paid back; with a Limp Bizkit twist.  Awesome!<br />7. Nobody Like You - 3.5/5 - I do like this track, but its not as good as Korns All In The Family (on Follow The Leader, featuring Fred Durst).  It has a fast, rock-hard start, but it starts to slow down towards the middle.  Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots appears alongside Jonathan Davis.<br />8. Dont Go Off Wandering - 2.5/5 - heres another average track that has some decent lyrics.  Theres really no music, though, it tries to hard to be rap-metal.  It wouldve been more enjoyable as just a heavy rock song.<br />9. 9 Teen 90 Nine - 3.5/5 - the fast start gets you excited and then it kind of lets you down.  The second verse is much better than the first and the ending makes up for it.  Its swaying in and out of rock and rap is better than average for the CD.<br />10. N 2 Gether Now - 4/5 - although Im not a huge fan of Method Man, I love this track.  I can honestly say (to anyone) if you dont like him either, you can still enjoy this song.  The background beats and endless chants of shut the fxck up are hilarious and make it what it is; which is great.<br />11. Trust? - 3/5 - this one has a weird start, but picks up its intensity over time.  It acts as a mix between Break Stuff and 9 Teen 90 Nine.  Its rather vulgar, which can either be good or bad; depending on how much you like the f-word.<br />12. No Sex - 3.5/5 - as provocative as it is scary, this song is relatively enjoyable.  The lyrics might be some of the best Limp Bizkit has done, but the way they were used in the chorus were nothing special; and dont allow the track to stand out on Significant Other.<br />13. Show Me What You Got - 2.5/5 - this song seems like itd be better live, as the beginning is dedicated to [us, the fans].  It is pretty good, but nowhere near as entertaining as Three Dollar Bill Yalls infamous Indigo Flow.<br />14. A Lesson Learned - 2/5 - Fred Durst, again, comes up with some stellar lyrics.  But, again, the music does not support them as well as it could have.  The beats are weak and theres no real guitar sound for the entire song.<br />15. Outro - ?/5 - read what I wrote for Intro and replace the word introductions with outros.<br />16. Untitled - 3/5 - if you remember, and liked, Matt Pinfield from MTV, you might appreciate this bonus track.  Its not a song, its just Pinfield yelling about how he hates bad music.  If you skip to 16, itll appear to only be a four-second track; but you have to listen at the end of Outro and before it skips to plus time.<br />With Significant Other, I think Limp Bizkit tried a bit too hard to go mainstream.  Their musical sound on their debut was excellent and not what MTV would want.  But with this release, they gave them exactly what they needed.  Their lyrics are very good and still stand out, but the music no longer does.  Even though songs like Break Stuff and Im Broke are among their best ever, other tracks (primarily towards the end) are nothing spectacular and dont amount to much.  If you liked Limp Bizkits debut youll probably like this CD as well.  But you might be a bit disappointed with it.  I know I was.o Flow.<br />14.

B00008J2DR|4.0|Godsmack latest release \\"Faceless\\" debuted at number 1 this week and for good reason.  Godsmack usually know for its heavy but rhythm friendly sound has maintained a reputation from its last 2 CD's and does not disappoint with \\"Faceless\\".  The album shows growth and change in the sound, but nothing too drastic. A sacrifice of some rhythm for a heavier edge is a minor change that is noticeable but not unwelcome. The album's second track \\"Faceless\\" is definitely one of the albums high points with the adrenaline taken up a notch, and even a guitar solo...we like it.  The fifth track is somewhat familiar being that it was released several months ago, yes \\"I stand Alone\\" is also on the CD and is pretty typical of the album, it seems to fit right in.  Faceless even has a ballad of sorts, \\"Serenity\\",  with its relaxed pace and somewhat positive lyrics it is a nice way to wind down the album.<...
B00006LLNU|4.0|This is a just a very good progressive rock album, and why should somebody call this type of music anything else is beyond me. Sigur Rs's sound is nothing new, modeled primarily (but not only) after \\"Meddle\\"-era Pink Floyd, but with much better sound technology. Eight long and very very very very very slow untitled tracks relying not on melody, musicianship or lyrics but exclusively on \\"mood\\". Critics call it \\"post-rock\\" or something like that only because listening to progressive rock is not cool, so they just invent a new label for the indie crowd. (\\"Alright! This is NOT prog! Now go on and enjoy it!\\") But don't let yourself be fooled.
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica-<BR>I truly believe metallica to be one of the greatest bands in history along side black sabbath and led zeppelin. This album is great on so many levels its unbelievable. this is my favorite metallica cd with master of puppets close behind. This cd contains thrash, heavy, and softer at times too. Any time im bored i can pop this cd in and listen to it and it sounds great every time. heres a review of the songs.<br />Fight fire with fire-good song and good pick for a opener. starts with a classical sounding intro then jumps into a very heavy guitar riff. B+<br />Ride the lightning- One of the songs that sticks out right away. has a awesome beat at the begining and great lyrics about being sentenced to the electric chair. A-<br />For Whom the Bell Tolls- One of my all time favorite Metallica songs. king of spooky with the bells then it jumps into one of the greatest guitar parts ive ever heard. awesome lyrics and great all around song. A+<br />Fade to Black- Now here we go this IS my all time favorite Metallica song. I love the soft guitar intro its one of my favorite things to sit in my room and play. James Hetfields voice is awesome and everyone works together perfectly. A+<br />Trapped Under Ice- strong song not close to a filler but isnt one of my favorite songs. has a good guitar part at the begining and Kirk really shreds it up on this song. Catchy chorus. B<br />Escape- same deal as trapped under ice good song just not one of the ones i listen to all the time. Still worth a listen every time i put the cd in. B<br />Creeping Death-Good song i really like the begining guitars and bass. has a long intro thats really good. B+<br />Call of Ktulu- Man i really love this song. This is metallicas best instrumental although Orion and Pulling teeth are incredible also. The guitars are so awesome i love playing along with this song. The ending is also very great. All the band members fit together great. A+<br />Overall this cd gets a A+ or 5 stars. this is thebest metallica album in my opinion. every song on here has its own great parts and every band member does something awesome in every song. if you like this album you should pick up master of puppets, kill 'em all, and justice for all, and the black album.

B00005JLEU|5.0|I'd heard all the buzz surrounding SPIRITED AWAY and finally got around to watching it this weekend.<br />Wow.<br />Miyazaki, Japan's animated film auteur, has created a film with a new, amazing vision -- coupled with an ageless story.<br />Young Chihiro is a timid, scared girl. When her family explores an abandoned theme park, Chihiro is magically \\"spirited away\\" to another realm where gods, monsters and spirits live. A mysterious character named Haku befriends her and teaches her the ropes of this new spirit world. Soon, Chihiro is working in Yubaba's bath house -- a spa for the gods! All along, though, she just wants to see her parents again and return to the human world (\\"there's no place like home\\"). Chihiro, like Dorothy (Oz) or Frodo (Rings), must learn to find her strength and courage and does so by telling the truth, doing kind acts, and, ultimately, following her heart.<br />As an American, used to seeing the Disney films, SPIRITED AWAY's style is at first a little different. The animation is not fluid and realistic like Disney. However, the colors, direction, and story-telling transport you into Miyazaki's world. Some of the images are downright surrealistic -- oversized chicks, bouncing heads, the \\"stink monster\\". Miyazaki's imagination never ceases to impress and entertain. Some of his creative ideas are very funny, as well (Yubaba's baby!).<br />I'm an adult and enjoyed SPIRITED AWAY very much. I couldn't see anything in the film that would be offensive to young kids or families. Some of the film might be scary to them -- but, heck, so is THE WIZARD OF OZ (flying monkeys! Ahh!). <br />By the way, I watched SPIRITED AWAY with its original Japanese soundtrack and English subtitles.  Knowing that the film originated in Japan made me not want to hear the dubbed American voices and translation.  The subtitles allowed me to hear the film in its original language.  Of course, the DVD provides both options, so to each his own!<br />Mostly, though, SPIRITED AWAY has an amazing new vision that I'd never seen before. I liked it for its surprising creativity.

B00005V3Z4|3.0|DONNIE DARKO has been playing midnight shows at a local art house theater here in D.C.  I thought I'd rent it, since it seemed to have a loyal following.<br />The story, in a nutshell, is about a troubled teen (Donnie) who has visions of a rabbit who tells him the world will end.<br />The film, written and directed by Richard Kelly, captures the high school angst that I remember so well.  Kelly is young, and some of the film's themes are executed a bit heavy-handedly, but  the heart of the film is constant.  The time travel aspect of Kelly's script was a bit confusing -- I admit, though, that DONNIE DARKO probably requires a few viewings as there are themes and story points that make more sense after repeated viewings.<br />DARKO's cast is really incredible.  What a potpourri of talent!  Mary McDonnell is soooooo good. Katharine Ross (THE GRADUATE, BUTCH CASSIDY) is a welcomed presence as Donnie's therapist.  Patrick Swayze (!) is great as a guru with a secret.  Drew Barrymore (who produced DARKO) stretches herself as a liberal teacher at Donnie's school. Of course, Jake Gyllenhaal, as Donnie, is really wonderful.  He's tortured and sensitive.<br />The DVD looks great and the bonus stuff is kinda cool - especially when you can view pages from the Time Travel book!

B00005UKE0|5.0|I always said the Beatles did better on their own than they ever did as a group.  This is living proof.  One of the premier works of all time.  George's best work lies on these discs and the remastering is superb.  Memories come flooding back listening to these tunes and I realize how much Mr. Harrison will be missed.  I'm grateful, though, that he can live on with this superb set.
B00006LLNU|5.0|no words can describe this work of art. this is truly a masterpiece. if you could translate a painting, a sculpture, an art installation, it would sound like &quot;( )&quot;. amazing. powerful. unique. if you have the chance to see them perform live, trust me, it is an unforgettable experience.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Not their best album (Tusk was always a tough act to follow) but some pretty good stuff.  Lindsey Buckingham would have done well to restrain himself a bit as some of his work on here is rather out of place with the group.  The ever-enchanting Stevie Nicks is in top form and it's wonderful to have her with the group again.  Christine McVie is sadly missed.  A good album that is definitely worth the purchase.
B00005JCA9|5.0|Notting Hill is a stunning romantic comedy that you can watch many times over.  Julia Roberts is perfect as Anna Scott, the charming, gorgeous celebrity who encounters Hugh Grant's character, William Thacker.  Comic relief is provided by both charismatic actors, as well as William's roommate, Spike.  The story flows smoothly without being bogged down in unecessary scenes, such as flashbacks or the like. The plot is solid and filled with warmth, heart and extreme wit that is well built upon by the wonderful cast.<br />The DVD version is wonderful for any fan with several funny deleted scenes, insightful commentaries and an even a map of the charming English area of Notting Hill.
B000002JSP|4.0|Led Zeppelin ruled the 1970s FM airwaves, and \\"In Through The Out Door\\" arrived in 1979, at the height of disco, the counter punch of the punk revolution and the dawn of the New Wave synth-bands.<br />Having gone three years without a studio release, this was a welcome comeback for a band that had been on a long hiatus. That it became their last studio release, due to the death of John Bonham, makes it all the more striking. They were still experimenting, pushing the envelope of rock music, and produced a number of standout tracks, even if not up to the level of their earlier work. The member who stands out in particular on these tracks is John Paul Jones, who co-wrote most of the tracks and infused them with layers of keyboards and synthesizers.<br />\\"In the Evening\\" makes an excellent introduction with its spooky, murky electric guitar, then becomes a pretty straight ahead rock piece.<br />\\"South Bound Saurez\\" has a nice bouncy keyboard part, guitar chops and Plant harmonizing well with himself.<br />\\"Fool in the Rain\\" may have been overplayed in its time, but it still has a fresh feel. Plant's vocals are moving toward the way he would sound in his early solo career, Pages acoustic work is excellent, Bonham's drumming is right on, and Jones ties it all together with his piano. Then there's that fun little Latin rhumba in the middle, with more outstanding drumming and keyboards.<br />\\"Hot Dog\\" shows Led Zeppelin's rarely heard humorous side, with a country-western twang, shuffling drums and more excellent piano work by Jones. Plant has a fun time with the lyrics and harmonies.<br />\\"Carouselambra\\" is an epic synth-based tune, the closest Led Zeppelin came to disco. The dynamics work well here, and the song progresses through different musical movements.<br />\\"All My Love\\" is a 'gentle' ballad (with pulsing drums!) and an emotional performance by Plant, nice guitars by Page, and a cool synth solo by Jones.<br />\\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\" closes out the disk with a slow blue/r&b number with nice guitar dynamics and soloing by Page, and everything gels for the band.nice guitar dynamics and soloing by Page, and everything gels for the band.
B00005LK94|5.0|This remains one of my favorite films for a variety of reasons.   The cinematography, beautiful soundtrack, great acting are among these.<br />Fly Away Home is based on a true story, and let's face it, audiences love true stories.  From Finding Fish to Catch Me if You Can to The Pianist, real sells.  And why not?  It's familiar, it's heartfelt and it's touching, as is the case of Fly Away Home.<br />The story is that of orphaned Amy's attempt to live with her father, and raise a flock of geese.  She eventually teaches them to migrate.  Anna Pacquin is stunning as Amy and Jeff Daniels displays surprising skills as her estranged yet caring father.  The relationship between the two of them and Amy and the geese is hauntingly beautiful and so vivrant on screen. Mark Isham provides a sweeping soundtrack that will resonate in your mind for days.  It's a shame Columbia never released the CD, but the DVD contains an option for the full score. <br />As well as the score, the Special Edition DVD contains enough features to hold your attention for hours.  Documentaries, commentaries, featurettes, trailers and production notes bring together a fitting package for a captivating film.
B00005JKN9|1.0|After having seen the phenomenal GoodFellas, I would have thought that Gangs was going to be a great Scorcece film. I WAS WRONG! The movie was boring from beginning to end. I fell asleep many times and so I just started to freak on my girlfriend.JK. Leo DiCaprio is a horrible actor. He should not make anymore movies in his career. Daniel Day-Lewis appears to look like a toothpick on-screen and his performance in this film was worse than DiCaprio's. The only highlight of this film was Cameron Diaz. She is an extremely sexy actress and brought some much needed life to this film.

While there are a couple songs that fall short (particularly those written by someone other than Louris), there are very few albums these days that come so close to filling up an entire album with such addictive melodies. <br />This album proves yet again that the Jayhawks might just be the best band around that most people have never heard of. For me, this is a welcome return to top form as I thought Smile was very disappointing. For newcomers to the band, don't stop with this record, as this band has been doing it for years.

0385504209|5.0|I began reading this book with some trepidation because it, at first, seemed to be a book about infighting between various religious organizations, with a murder thrown in. Boy was I wrong. It is a very well written thriller about a very complex murder that requires the protagonists to decipher numerous codes and other religious based histories in order to solve, not only the murder, but also to prevent irreplaceable documents (Holy Grail) from being destroyed.<br />The other amazing part of this book is that it imparts a considerable amount of historical knowledge to the reader without them even realizing it. The many things I learned through reading this book would never have been looked into by me because religious history never appealed to me. Here, you get a big dose of it, without knowing you would, and then, being mighty glad you did.<br />Great Book!

After Back in the USSR it's all downhill from there.  And with two CDs, it's a long, long way to the end.<br />Buy the early Beatles music.

0688163173|3.0|Dennis Lehane's newest mystery is truly a mystery to me!!! On surface the plot seems simple - it's post WWII, two war veterans, now U.S. Marshals, set out to Shutter Island's mental asylum for violent criminals (or patients as Dr. Crawley insists) to investigate the disappearance of a patient who had no visible or reasonable means of escape. Their investigation soon meets a dead-end when the hospital personnel, doctors, nurses, and orderlies are less than cooperative with necessary information.  Meanwhile, Lehane introduces many other themes:  How does violence shape humans, especially combat veterans and criminals; an historical look at psychiatric treatment in the 1950s and the argument between two schools - surgical intervention vs. psychotropic drugs; secret operations programs to test different drugs on the mentally ill; racial inequities; the fear of reality; and, finally, when does personal pain become self-deception.<br />  With that many themes the book seemed cluttered without sufficient time to develop all of them satisfactorily for the reader.  Without the thematic developement on the part of the author, it left me wondering why it was included in the book.  Characterization was bland and robotic especially of the professional staff at the asylum.  The 50's setting could have been interesting if there had been more thematic development to tie it all together.  But it all felt unresolved.  Dialogue was sometimes vague and irrelevant, and again, why were some things introduced to the reader, e.g., Marshal Aule's difficulties because of a Japanese-American girlfriend - it served to explain why he had been newly partnered with Teddy Daniels, but it was almost unbelievable given that it was 1954 and I'm not sure our society was sensitive enough to reassign a U.S. Marshal based on a racial issue.<br />  All in all, a somewhat disappointing, unfinished attempt that failed to effectively connect all the themes that were introduced.  I truly love Dennis Lehane and have read all his books, but this one fell short for me.ehane and have read all his books, but this one fell short for me.

B00005JLWN|5.0|Hands down, an incredible film. Period. Not just an incredible genre picture, but an incredible picture. Especially in this day and age of studio homogenization of their films, this picture stayed true to its obvious roots.<br />An amalgamation of futuristic sci-fi/mind-bending action and moments of tear-jerking drama, this one is a very enjoyable 2 hour distraction. Hollywood failed this movie in not rightfully promoting it to the ticket-buying public but word of mouth will not be contained. It's already on my 'must buy' DVD list and I'm sure many MANY more people like me will be looking forward to picking this one up in May.<br />Disregard the nay-sayers who shove this off as a Matrix clone. I'm a huge Matrix fan and went into Equilibrium without any pre-conceived notions and after viewing it I realized I'd seen something so distinct and different emotionally than the Matrix that it was a crime to connect the two films.<br />See this film, then make your judgment. You won't be disappointed.

0783225970|2.0|I purchased the DVD for my 15 year-old son who likes Al Pacino.  When I originally saw this movie, years ago in the theater, I laughed my a** off. It was so full of stereotypes that it was more of a comedy than a serious film.  Al Pacino must have really been using coke when he made this movie.  It is not in the same league with the Godfather series.

B000003C2U|5.0|This album marks a significant change in Death, as their first three albums were rather un-technical and really basic death metal.  Some accused Chuck of selling out, but there is really NO evidence for that, because this is by far his most aggressive outing ever.  Sure, there are some great melodies, as well as a few mellow moments, but at the same time, who can say that Spiritual Healing is as aggressive as \\"Lack of Comprehension\\" or \\"Together As One?\\" Just listen to the pick shredding going on in either of those songs, and you will find absolutely NO grounds for feeling otherwise.  What's more is that Chuck recruited members of Cynic and the bass god Steve Digiorgio for work on here, showing off their talents in a frenzied way.  This is a masterpiece of death metal, and if you consider yourself a fan of the genre, you MUST own this album.  I repeat, you MUST own it!

B000089A07|4.0|In a story set before the events of &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; FBI investigator Will Graham (Edward Norton) returns from an early retirement to hunt for a serial killer called the Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes) with assistance from the imprisoned Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins, of course).  I was leery about this one, especially because the director, Brett Ratner, has not done very much good work in the past.  However, he really rose to the challenge here.  He understands the Lecter character and has put together a very suspenseful, scary movie.  The outstanding cast does a wonderful job.  Ted Tally, who wrote the screenplay for SOTL, also took on the writing chores here and acquitted himself well.

B00005JLEU|3.0|It's not a horrible movie, but certainly nothing extraordinary. I found the story to be minimal, with a lot of wasted time between the very beginning and the very end, which was entirely predictable.<br />Clearly, Hayao Miyazaki is one of those opium writers, like the Alice in Wonderland guy. The whole movie is basically a shroom trip, just like Princess Mononoke. Lots of cool visuals.<br />The best part is the beginning, where Dad is driving the family around in his Audi S4, aggressively tackling the dirt road and boasting of his Quattro IV all wheel drive system.  :-)

B00006LLNV|4.0|it's funny, i bought this cd because i was so i love with the movie that i wanted to hold on to it as long as possible.  i figured once that wore off, it would make great mood music to eat dinner or read to.  but i find myself playing it all the time no matter what i'm doing.  its beautiful, rich, sad and sexy... all the things the movie was and frida herself seemed to be.  an added bonus, the lyrics to most songs are given in spanish and english.  my favorite line is in la llorona (the weeping woman):  \\"Yo soy como el chile verde, llorona, picante pero sabroso\\" (i am like the green chile, llorona, spicy but delicious.\\"

B000002J6F|5.0|Time gives us perspective and over 30 years after I bought it on vinyl, the album Manassas holds up well, gaining poignancy in that Stills would probably never again reach similar heights as an artist. Here he is at the pinnacle of his powers, writing a ton of quality songs and managing a large, talented, TIGHT band (probably with the considerable help of ex-Byrd Chris Hillman--one of the things that attracted me to the album in the first place).<br />The results are impressive. This is a solid album that spans a number of musical genres, and hearing it re-mastered on CD is a treat. There are few weak songs and as a fan of bands with three guitars, Stills, Hillman, and Perkins (often, but not always, on Steel) mesh very well. Stills is firmly in the spotlight, but seems secure enough (in contrast to his musical endeavors with Neil Young) to let the band function as an integrated whole. I remember this album getting lukewarm reviews at the time, which seems ludicrous. If only more CDs contained over 20 solid tracks.<br />I saw this band twice, and the first time--a three hour show at Maples Pavillion at Stanford University--they blew me away, opening with &quot;So You Want to Be a Rock and Roll Star?&quot; and following with &quot;Rock and Roll Woman.&quot; They then went into the suite on Side One, and things got even better.<br />Stills appeared to be a little wobbly, a foreshadowing of the kinds of things would later work against him as an artist, but it never interfered with the quality musicianship of the evening. At one time during the night he said &quot;This is the best band I've ever played with,&quot; and truthfully it was. CSNY may have had the star power and the hits, but could never be mistaken as a full functioning band, especially in concert. Manassas impresses today because they are a BAND that brought the best out of Stephen Stills. The best evidence of this is &quot;The Treasure&quot;, a studio recording essentially played live in one take. It's awesome and shows the ability of the group to work with one mind toward a common goal. Wish it would have happened more often in Stills (and for that matter, Hillman's) career.
B00008J4P5|4.0|Don't let the hype fool you- this isn't the end-all be-all of the White Stripes.  Having to follow-up the masterful White Blood Cells is quite a task, but the White Stripes have achieved it.  Where WBC should be noted for it's melodic brilliance and the tight-nit force of Jack and Meg White, on Elephant, the listener gets a glimpse of the mental workings of Jack White through some powerful lyrics.  White Blood Cells showed the music world what a duo the group is; Elephant delves deeper into the Jack White mystique.  <br />Each song chronicles Jack's perspective and response to his overwhelming newfound fame and fortune.  The opener, &quot;Seven Nation Army,&quot; even defies the White Stripes guitar-and-drums sound, with Jack's guitar fed through an octave pedal to simulate a bassline.  <br />Elephant is melodically inferior to White Blood Cells, but all is forgiven with wonderfully written lyrics such as &quot;There's No Home For You Here&quot;'s 'waking up for breakfast/burning matches/talking quickly/breaking baubles/throwing garbage/drinking soda/looking happy/taking pictures/so completely stupid/just go away.'<br />Once again, the White Stripes are cause for intrigue with a beautifully crafted album unique to their canon.  With such brilliant talent, one can only expect continual greatness from this band.
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|My wife and I purchased the CD long before seeing the movie, and I have to say that the CD stands very well on its own.  And I am not much of a Bjork person.<br />One warning, though:  the movie is so horribly depressing that since seeing it we haven't been able to listen to the CD.
B00008H2LB|4.0|This is Linkin Park's third full length album, but it's only the second one that features new material. That is to say, Park fans have been waiting a long time for this CD. Does it live up to the hype? Let's look at the CD Track by track...<br />1. Foreward: It's about 10 seconds of nothing. A beat that gets progressively faster with a glass shattering sound. Whoopdeedo.<br />2. Don't Stay: A heavy guitar combined with excellent sratches makes a good, rage-filled opening.<br />3. Somewhere I Belong: This is the first radio single. It's a bit slower then most LP songs, but that doesn't take away from the music. Excellent rapping by Mike.<br />4. Lying From You: Probably the worst song on the CD. Brad's guitar doesn't go anywhere special; and the backround loop gets a little annoying. Fortunatly, the chorus doesn't include it.<br />5. Hit the Floor: A good old angry song. Mike raps espcially fast, and Chester screams espcially loud.<br />6. Easier to Run: The boys bring it down a bit. Chester does the singing. Really nice, harmonical sampling.<br />7. Faint: A strange loop comes in at the beginning, but Brad does some nice guitar work to match the loop exactly. Put together nicely, includes a screaming bridge.<br />8. Figure.09: This is one of those songs that only LP fans will like. Nothing special, but a good song none the less.<br />9. Breaking the Habit: The CD booklett says this song took 6 years to finally complete. It shadows the eariler 'Eaiser to Run', with Chester singing the majority of the song. Magestic.<br />10. From the Inside: Again, only a song LP fans will enjoy. Nothing really special, except it's in 6/8 time.<br />11. Nobody's Listening: A Japanese flute humms in the backround while Mike raps about the band. It's not bad, but most people will probably skip the track.<br />12. Session: Meteora's answer to Hybrid Theory's 'Cure for the Itch'. Except insead of Joe, Mike takes his turn in the studio. Apparently, says the Booklett, it sounded unfinisheduntil Pheonix, Joe, and Rob put some stuff in it. A nice turntable solo at the end, but it's not as good as 'Cure'.<br />13. Numb: Arguably the best song on the CD. Numb reminds one of 'Pushing me Away' from Hybrid Theory. A nice piano chimes in the back while Chester sings. Mike provides little backround rapping. It all comes together.<br />All in all, Meterora sounds like Linkin Park. They've defined their own sound. If you didn't like Hybrid Theory, then Meteora is not for you. If you like LP's distinct sound, then pick up Meteora it's incredible.

B000089RVX|4.0|Great album. At first I thought it might be &quot;Linkin Park Jr.&quot; with the slight twist of a female vocalist. Turned out to be the perfect complimentary style I've been fond of most recently (i.e. Kidney Thieves, Curve) - aggressive yet subtle, masculine tamed by feminine (or is it vice-versa on this record?), rock smartened by electronics (but not overdone). The vocal harmonies are beautiful and production is excellent. As far as the &quot;weighty&quot; lyrical content, it's a unique perspective and you're either into it or you're not. I read a rather misleading review earlier regarding this album and Christianity, and I felt (as a Christian) it needed to be said (in defense) that it's a relief to see other Christians exploring/struggling with more difficult subject matter in order to vocalize/contend with the darker side of life. After all, we're only human.
B000059XUP|3.0|Face the facts and realize what the whole crew went through the first Crow film. Brandon Lee was killed on set and on film! Supposedly because of a curse linked with his fathers' past and a myth of the curse of the crow the bird itself. Anyways I can't believe that this came out and I am very surprised. It's not very good but it's also not very bad. Deftones make a cameo in it... remember the deftones...they used to be good. Anyways if you liked the first crow and heard of it's terrible luck with it's history of the making of the film than check this one out. This is one of those movies that are made because The Crow story itself could have been a great franchise but with the main character literally dead and a few dead ringers who just present a thin whit line of what Brandon Lee use to present as the crow this movie is okay but could never have been better than it is!!!
0061020710|3.0|In many a movie series or book series, the first installment tends to be a classic. With the colour of magic, it seems to me that Pratchett was still refining his writing chops and that this installment is inferior to his later discworld efforts.<br />Sure, The Colour of Magic introduces you to the nuances of the discworld, but the first half of the book is incredibly dull and pointless. I'm told the second book in this series is much better, maybe I'll check that one out next. An okay read, but for completists only. As discworld is not a continuous series, you can skip this one and explore one of his later, better efforts instead.
B000002N2Z|5.0|The title says it all really. This CD is deftones best CD and is full of aggression. Deftones along with Korn are really the only new metal bands around (even though they aren't new anymore). If you don't own this CD then you are a fool. If you own this CD or you are about to buy it then you will see or you are about to see where it all started!<BR>In short to have a respectable CD collection you need this CD
B00005JLRT|4.0|I want to say something right off the get go, Nemesis was a great Star Trek story, one the Great Bird would have liked,  however, to people who arent fimilar to the Star Trek way of thinking, this movie would seem slow and drawn out.  Star Trek TNG has all along dealt with humanity and ethics, this is no exception.  Patrick Stewart(Picard) and Tom Hardy(Shinzon) do a great job of playing the good versus evil and it truly relates to the series. Nature vs Nurture, a true debate in todays time, a scared Picard clone growing up in the worst possible conditions versus the great Captian Picard. I didn't like the character death but they did leave an out if they should prefer to make another movie.  Something had to deal with some Empire other that Borg or Klingon. And I am glad that they brought the Romulans into the mix finally and they way they did was brillant.  Not a bad story for a mailed scrpit from an amatuer.  A true Trek movie start to finish.<BR>P.S. we have waited for 15 years for Troi and Riker to hook up, its about time!

Blink 182 made the pop-punk scene what it is today, but just watch one of blink's videos's or go to one of their shows and you'll see they are all about having fun. <BR>In my opinion (and remember this is just my opinion) i think that Blink 182 rule! I understand they aren't what people call proper punk like Rancid or Pennywise but they do rule and this album rules and you will rule for buying it<br />This is how i rate the tracks out of 10.<br />Dumpweed - 9 - Great opening riff. A good way to start off an album<br />Don't Leave Me - 9 - Good song<br />Aliens Exist - 10 - I think this song is amazing. Concentrating on Tom's fascination with aliens. This one rocks. <br />Going Away To College - 8 - Quite good<br />What's My Age Again - 8 - Great opening riff. Funny video<br />Dysentery Gary - 7 - I don't really like this song. I don't know you though.<br />Adam's Song - 10 - Best song on the album.<br />All The Small Things - 7 - This song made Blink 182 famous. With the micky-take video. I personally don't find it that good.<br />The Party Song - 10 - Good song. Fast vocals, fast guitars. <br />Mutt - 10 - The album gets better as it goes on and this song proves it<br />Wendy Clear - 10 - Another great song<br />Anthem - 10 -What a way to finish off a great pop-punk album.

B00003CXCW|5.0|The struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) owes money for his car and if he does not pay it the car will be repossessed.  Thus, Joe sets off to search for someone to get the money from and he is also looking for a new job.  In this search for money, he crosses path with the repossessing agents and in a car chase he evades the repossessing agents by turning into the driveway of 10086 Sunset Boulevard where a crumbling mansion from the golden days of silent films stands.  Joe assumes the mansion is abandoned, however, he quickly realizes differently.  The house is inhabited by Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who once was a huge silent film star, but now is delusional about her own current fame.  This provides an opportunity for Joe, who is broke, to regain his financial security and avoid the repossessing agents, since Ms. Desmond is looking for a screenwriter to help her with her feeble script.  However, there seems to be something else going on behind the curtain as Joe helps Ms. Desmond.  Sunset Boulevard is a brilliant film offering first class cinematography, an ingenious script, and good acting through the excellent cast.  The film entertains, but there are also many lessons to be taught through the experience of the story as it unfolds.  In the end, the film depicts an extraordinary cinematic event.
B00005JKG9|5.0|The frame of mind that occupies the salesmen of a Chicago office is to eat or be eaten.  This is the foundation in a male chauvinistic world where manhood is often projected as either a strength or weakness, i.e., one is not a man at all if he cannot close a deal.  One of these men is Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon) who is constantly on the phone due to his daughter's hospitalization.  The rest are  Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), the constant working salesman, Dave Moss (Ed Harris), the bitter salesman who is never happy, and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin), the nice salesman.  These four men work under John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) who is their somewhat green supervisor and who has invited Blake (Alec Baldwin), the downtown consult mogul who makes a seven figure salary.  Blake has been invited to remind the four salesmen that they have a month to get their sales up, and the man with the highest sales will receive a Cadillac.  The second highest will get a set of steak knives while the two others will be fired.  Glengarry Glen Ross is shrewdly written by David Mamet who tells a story that provides a genuine atmosphere where the characters work and interact.  The different cast members in the film provide superb characters with different mentalities, and yet with a balance, which enhances the nature of the working environment.  In the end, the film will provide an amazing cinematic experience that offers challenges on top of entertainment.
B00007L4OM|3.0|A tough Parisian cop, Hubert Fiorentini (Jean Reno), accidentally beats up the Police Chief's son and is asked to take some time off.  In the process, his long lost love of19 years back appears to have died and has given him everything in her will.  This means that he has to go to Japan and as he arrives he also finds out that he has a daughter that is now 19 years old who has developed a huge dislike for authority.  In addition, there is a bank account with 200 million dollars in it and someone is trying to threaten him and his daughter in order to get it.  A question remains as to where the money came from and who is after it.  Wasabi is an action comedy that plays with parody as Hubert drags along his huge .44mm Magnum Smith & Wesson, however, the story gets lost in the jokes.  This serves as the foundation for a cinematic experience that is neither remarkable or common.
B00006DEF9|4.0|Like most of us, I grew up with the title song since as long as I can remember. I've seen snippets here and there, but it wasn't until over the weekend that I saw the film in its entirety. I got this one because of the AFI 100. Shallow reasons aside, I'm glad I did. This has some great stuff in these two discs. Not only did you get a great movie, but you get a wonderful education on genre of film that is uniquely American.<br />First, the film. I loved it. The premise was interesting and solid. As I'm sure you know by now, it's about a famous silent film romantic duo whose careers become jepordized with the arrival of a little talking film called \\"The Jazz Singer.\\" The male half, played by Gene Kelley, has no problem because he comes from a vaudville background, singing and dancing with his partner, played by Donald O'conner. But the other half of the duo Lina Lamont played by Jean Hagen, has problems. Obviously hired for her looks and not screeching brooklyn whine, and thus the dilema. If you took the music out, you would still have a film. The acting and pace are strong enough to keep you interested. Jean Hagan is pricless as the self-absorbed air head. The phrase \\"I caaan't stend 'im!\\" will stick in your head well after the movie is over. \\"Singing\\" never tries to be more that it actually is. A great light hearted musical-comedy and that why it works.<BR>The dancing is nothing short of spectacular and while I did like the title song, my favorites were \\"Make 'em Laugh\\" and \\"Broadway Melodie\\". I liked Gene Kelly in \\"American in Paris\\" and the numbers in this film blows anything offered by that movie away. I also have a high respect for Kelly. The movie is co-directed by him and he easily could have made this movie showcasing only his talent. Instead he utilizes and celebrates the talents of others. Donald O'Connor as well as Cyd Charisse (man those legs!) are a perfect examples. The sets are stunning! <br />Now on to the DVD Features. More than you can shake a stickat! On disc one you have a great feature that shows signifigant movies that bridge silent film to talkies, including \\"The Jazz Singer.\\" When I saw this, I felt I struck gold. The digital restoration of \\"Singer\\" and the others are amazing. Nothing is done half-heartedly here. The two documentaries on disc 2 proves my point further. These are not 20 minute snippets. One feature, hosted by Debbie Reynolds is about the making \\"Singing in the Rain\\" is over 30 minutes and is great. You get Donald O'Connor's take on the amazing gymnastics of \\"Make 'em Laugh\\" as well as some great stories by Charrise and Reynolds. The other documentary \\"Musicals great Musicals\\" is a whopping hour and a half! This was by far the best gem on the disc. Going through the history of the movie musical and chronicles producer Arthur Freeds career. My wife and I soaked this one up like a sponge. This even has make-up test from the Wizard of Oz and recovered footage from \\"Annie Get Your Gun\\" with Judy Garland before she was fired.<br />Bottom line: Get this one. Fans of the genre will be drooling and those who want an introduction to the genre will be tapping their feet before the first number is finished.
0553208845|5.0|I have never seen a man look and smile, sit and talk like that, he thought. I, also, would like to look and smile, sit and walk like that, so free, so worthy, so restrained, so candid, so childlike and mysterious. A man only looks and walks like that when he has conquered his self. I also will conquer my Self.<br />A great journey, Siddhartha experiences all phases of life looking for peace of mind and satisfaction. No matter how difficult it seems, new starts all always available to conquer ourselves...<br />The first book I ever read for Hermann Hesse, and one of my most favorite by far...
B00006879E|5.0|I had never heard of Maroon 5 until a friend recommended it to me, and I am crazy about them. This is the best album I've bought in a really long time... it's fabulous. There's something for every mood. It's definitely a unique sound, so I wouldn't compare them to anyone exactly but I think this music is hard to dislike. I don't even have a favorite track anymore - the entire album is strong!
0783117523|3.0|A biopic of Gia--a famous fashion model whose rise to stardom ended abruptly due to her own carelessness. Angelina Jolie (and her piping hot body) stars as Gia. A sad story indeed.
0793518326|5.0|This book is the best 50 bucks ive ever spent, really good for guitar and messing around with piano. I own every cd by the beatles and love every song so this book is just great. Sure the print is small but its damn good. Ive only found like 2 mistakes.<br />Wonderfull, glad i bought it.
1558908358|2.0|Jeff Bridges is Kevin Flynn...a computer genius who had his computer game ideas ripped off by a man called \\"Dillinger\\" (David Warner) Now Flynn wants to prove the theft...so when he hacks into the computer and get gets zapped into the computer world by the MCP (Master Control Program) to play computer games. He meets TRON who helps him destroy the MCP & release the truth about the theft. Great SFX in the computer world, but a VERY SLOW & stilted script. There should have been more computer game sequences & other heart-stopping action to make it more exciting. But it's a real let down.
B00006CXXU|1.0|This CD has nothing to recommend. I'm a Professional Night Club DJ, and this is one the worst CD's I have ever reviewed. The music lack dance appeal.
B000002JSV|5.0|one of the least heard and most underrated AC/DC albums ever! trully bon's best effort. This could be considered the first real grunge album with the deep slow buzsaw sound from angus guitar long before nirvana. most notable on the tracks &quot;what's next to the moon&quot; and &quot;down payment blues&quot;. Almost every song here could have been a FM hard rock hit and alot of them were hits on our local rock station KISW. &quot;sin city&quot; &quot;whats next to the moon&quot; &quot;gone shooting&quot; &quot;down payment blues&quot; &quot;rock n roll damnation&quot; are the high points and there is no filler. bon never sounded better and the youngs never played cleaner. I would give this album top 10 ever if &quot;crabsody in blue&quot; would have been added here it would have fit perfectly. in my opinion the best AC/DC album ever with &quot;highway to hell&quot; second.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I'll make it brief-- Madonna fans will love this cd (if not at first, then definitely after a few listens!!!)... After listening to this for the last week, it has grown on me considerably; initially, I thought it sub-par but it has slowly revealed itself to be ON par with Madonna's recent work. It is certainly another fascinating piece of the musical puzzle that Madonna has been weaving since \\"Ray of Light,\\" her first radically open and honest work. Thogh not as cohesive as ROL, or even MUSIC, its still totally relevant and has Madonna pushing more boundaries-- but most important is the fact that she is pushing her own boundaries, not just ours...<br />Oh yeah,and she ROCKS!
B00008RH3L|5.0|Certainly my favorite Cohen brothers film (and I consider myself an aficionado of their work) and one of my favorite films of all-time, Miller's Crossing is a brushstroke of genius, in every way imaginable, a complete masterwork if I've ever seen one.<br />The plot has been summed up in previous reviews: a power-struggle between the Irish mob and the Italians in an unnamed city on the east coast (I'm assuming). It involves complex loyalties and trusts, forged and broken, keeping you guessing character motives and alliances until the very end.<br />Gabriel Byrne plays the wonderfully dark Tom Regan, right hand man to the always-brilliant Albert Finney's Liam 'Leo' O'Bannon. Everyone in the film shines. I was particularly taken with Jon Polito's Giovanni `Johnny Caspar' Casparo. On the surface, a hot-headed simpleton, but underneath, one of the more torn and complex mobsters since Pacino's Michael Corleone.<br />The theme of the film can be summed up by Johnny Caspar's frustrated expectations of his employees: \\"Friendship.....character....ethics.....\\" The movie exists as a complicated character study of these traits and how they affect the lives of the many characters involved. Some of the villains in the film seem to live by the `honor among the thieves' credo more so than the films 'heroes' if indeed there are any.<br />The film looks stunning, as can be expected from the Cohen's, and the aforementioned score is one of the most used in film trailers to this day. The scenes at Miller's Crossing with Tom chasing his hat and then being put to the test later in the film are simply stunning.<br />All the praise in the world from an amateur reviewer such as myself won't make you see the film, but trust me, if there was such a thing as a perfect movie, for me, this is it.<br />Now stop givin' me the High Hat and check out the film!
B00008S2VH|3.0|Ok, I like the songs \\"American Life\\",\\"Hollywood\\",and \\"Die Another Day\\"(a good dance tune). But The rest I couldnt care for. Save your money and buy something else. But....If you are a Madonna fan this is a must have.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is a from the gut, stream of consciousness review as I hear the album for the first time...<br />AMERICAN LIFE - we've all heard this one!  But a good way to start things off - it really sets the tone. <br />HOLLYWOOD - a groovy little ditty.  Based on the lyrics I likened the song to \\"Soak Up The Sun\\", and the sound is very similar to Sheryl Crow actually with a little more electro beats to it.  I was probably looking forward to this song the most and its not bad.  This is scheduled to be Madonna's second single. <br />IM SO STUPID - I'm not sure how I feel about this one yet.  I do like the music track on this.  But her vocals are kinda all over the place in the beginning.  It gets a lot better in the second verse.  OK - I think I can get into this.  She's got a Sheryl Crow sound on this one too. <br />LOVE PROFUSION - Mostly acoustic guitars and a deep bass which reminds me ALOT of \\"I Deserve It\\" (from the \\"Music\\" album), but faster.  Additional synth towards the end give it a little more umph to it.  I REALLY LIKE THIS ONE. <br />NOBODY KNOWS ME - Full on vocorded vocals and electro pops - this would be a GREAT dancefloor record with the right remix.  VERY GOOD.  I definitely could see this one as a single.  Along the genre of \\"dirty pop\\", this one is the most dancey so far. <br />NOTHING FAILS - This follows the sound of \\"Dont Tell Me\\" very closely with a slower bass and acoustic guitar riffs and sweet vocals and haunting strings - mark my words - THIS WILL BE THE POWER BALLAD OF THE ALBUM (usually reserved for the 3rd single - as in \\"Power of Goodbye\\" and \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\") And to top it off - a gospel choir!!  You go girl - this is one of her best songs ever. <br />INTERVENTION - Reminded me at first of the William Orbit produced tracks \\"Beautiful Stranger\\", \\"Amazing\\", and even \\"American Pie\\", but a little more simple and folky production with the acoustic guitars (a very recurring theme) <br />X-STATIC PROCESS - A guitar, a violin, and Madonna - very simple.  And it hits you.  I hate to liken the song to such a classic, but the first thing I thought of when I heard this was \\"Dust In The Wind\\" by Kansas. <br />MOTHER & FATHER - With a bass background sound that grooves like INXS' \\"Need You Tonight\\", this song by many reports has been called an 80's throwback - and I can see why - there are synths, and another rap by Madonna, but with all its similarities still sounds very fresh.  Felix da Housecat would have a field day remixing this. <br />DIE ANOTHER DAY - A lot of Madonna fans don't think this song should be on the album at all, because it interrupts the flow.  I disagree.  This one which we've all heard by now chugs along right in place after MOTHER & FATHER.  I think it works here, and because it sounds so \\"old\\" to us, we're ready to move on to the new stuff and have a tendency to just hit \\"skip\\".  Don't.  Enjoy it one more time. <br />EASY RIDE - Follows DIE ANOTHER DAY nicely, there are more strings and acoustic guitars and a very nice way to close out the set. <br />OVERALL: <br />This album is much better as a whole than \\"Music\\".  That album had two distincly different sounds and I'm still very frustrated when I listen to it, and usually either only listen to the beginning 3 songs, or just skip around to the songs I like.  The pieces of that album are good, but there's no flow.  THIS ALBUM FLOWS SO WELL.  2nd only to \\"Ray of Light\\" (still the best I think).  For 3 years I've been wishing she'd do an album with Sheryl Crow, an album with more guitar to it, I got what I wanted.  In the end, its not Sheryl Crow, and I'm glad.  She made it her own and I'm really happy.  If you like \\"Music\\" you're going to love \\"American Life\\" - if you were disappointed with \\"Music\\" - you'll love \\"American Life\\".  This is the album she should have made 3 years ago.
0385507755|5.0|A terrific story with a message that applies to everyone. James  was able to beat his addictions by accepting responsibility for what he did, not by blaming someone else.  The world would be a better place if more people took a page from James' book.
0066214122|4.0|In Michael Crichton's \\"Prey\\", we may have a new genre that could be called \\"Gothic Biotech.\\" Using his masterful skills, honed over thirty years of writing best selling suspense novels, Crichton presents us with a riveting tale of a bio-engineered organism that rises up with a will and a vengeance, aiming to control its creators.<br /><br /> From the labs of the Silicon Valley, scientists pressured by ever-increasing market competitions enter a dangerous realm. A secret facility \\"outside Reno\\", Crichton tells us, is the scene for the nonstop plot. (As a northern Nevadan, I must object that Crichton seems to have confused our climate with that of southern Nevada outside Vegas. Our \\"high-mountain\\" desert just isn't as fierce as the one he describes!)<br /><br /> Crichton does the domestic scenes well, as \\"house-husband\\" Jack Forman, between jobs as a hightech computer programmer, struggles with family routines and unruly children in his new role. He writes in the voice of one who has been there, and women will appreciate the authenticity.<br /><br /> The pace is trademark-fast, the suspense is intriguing, and there are surprises throughout. \\"Prey\\" is another good one from<br />Crichton's ever-fertile imagination. Recommended.
B00006JSS8|5.0|Stevie Wonder has run the gamut of music all other entertainers only dream of.  His music runs through every persons memory from the simple toe tappers who enjoy the rythm, to the maestroes who spend their lives with the orchestra.  Music doesn't get any better than this.

B00008DDXL|4.0|Summary:<BR>It's Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) second year at Hogwart's and, of course, there is something going on that only Harry and his friends can resolve.  When the original founders of Hogwart's created the school, one of the four, Slytherin, didn't think that mud-bloods (impure wizards) should be allowed entrance.  To purify the school, Slytherin created The Chamber of Secrets that would be opened by his true heir.  The true heir possesses Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright), Ron Weasley's (Rupert Grint) little sister and gets her to open the chamber.  It is now up to Harry to face down the horrible creature that is released and save Ginny's life.<br />My Comments:<BR>As is likely going to be the case with all of the Harry Potter movies, the book is better, much better.  Nevertheless, this movie wasn't too bad.  It made more of an attempt to tell a story instead of just jump from one memorable scene in the book to the next one and letting the people that have read the book (which is probably just about everyone by now) fill in the story.  The problem with actually trying to tell the story is that there are a lot of details that inevitably get left out, details that add depth and charm to the story.  So, if you really want to experience the second story in the Harry Potter series, you need to read the book.<br />As for the movie itself, the cinematography and special effects were, as to be expected, superb.  The budget for these films must be enormous.  And, most of the actors were pretty good, including Dobby who was computer generated.  However, and I hate to say this because I really liked Ron in the books, Rupert Grint (who plays Ron Weasley) drove me nuts.  I was never really convinced that he was Ron.  He continually came across as acting and trying to force lines and it never really worked.  Of course, Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) has always been like that, but I thought Rupert did a better job in the last film.  <br />Other than the distracting child actors, the movie was pretty good.  The story made a bit more sense this time (as in, the story that is actually told in the movie, not the story from the book), even though a lot of the fun details were left out.  Perhaps the actors will improve their skills as actors just as their characters are supposed to improve their wizardry skills.  As a fan of the books, I'll be looking forward to the next one, and hopefully they will just continue to improve.
B00008QSA5|5.0|This album represents the rock equivalent of a jazz &quot;blowing session&quot;.  Bloomfield and Kooper met while playing on Bob Dylan's &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; and had both left their current bands.  Bloomfield quit Electric Flag while Kooper exited Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears.  This jam session with some of their friends like Barry Goldberg, Harvey Brooks and Eddie Hoh contains some of the best playing of Bloomfield's career.  The opening cut &quot;Albert's Shuffle&quot; illustrates the influences of blues greats like Albert King, Freddie King, B.B. King and Albert Collins on Bloomfield's style.  His playing while not fast and flashy like Stevie Ray Vaughan or Johnny Winter relies on string bending, dynamics and emotion.  His instrumental cover of &quot;Stop&quot; is catchy and it may be more than coincidence that Jimi Hendrix and Joe Walsh with the James Gang both featured versions of song in their sets after &quot;Super Session&quot; was released.  &quot;His Holy Modal Majesty&quot; sort of picks up where the epic &quot;East-West&quot; left off during his tenure with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band.  It features Bloomfield's eastern influenced modal playing.  &quot;Really&quot; is another slow burner.  Much to the chagrin of Kooper, Bloomfield abruptly split the session after only half of the album was recorded due to his insomnia and heroin addiction.  Kooper quickly recruited Stephen Stills from Buffalo Springfield and later CSN&amp;Y to record the rest of the album.  Stills plays fairly well especially of the long jam of Donovan's &quot;Season of the Witch&quot;.  The cover of &quot;You Don't Love Me&quot; later covered by the Allman Brothers Band on &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; is given a treatment with some phasing and flanging effects.  Stills also covers Dylan's &quot;It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry&quot;.  The remastered set also features 4 bonus tracks and great sound.  The extra tracks include alternate versions of &quot;Albert'sShuffle&quot; and &quot;Season of the Witch&quot; sans the sometimes obtrusive horn overdubs.  Welcome additions are the unissued slow blues &quot;Blues For Nothing&quot; from these sessions featuring Bloomfield and an unissued live cut &quot;Fat Grey Cloud&quot; recorded live with Bloomfield and Kooper.  It would have been interesting to hear Bloomfield's takes on the songs Stills played in his portion of the set.  Ironically Bloomfield's take on &quot;Season of the Witch&quot; can be heard on the new vault release &quot;Fillmore East: The Lost Concert Tapes 12/13/1968&quot;. The sixties feeling of flying by the seat of your pants pervades the session but the playing by Stills and especially Bloomfield makes the album worthwhile. Another great example of Mike Bloomfield's fluid and clean guitar style can be found on &quot;My Labors&quot; by Nick Gravenites much of which is recorded live in concert.

B000002UB3|5.0|For a monumental band like the Beatles, it's fitting the last album they would record would also be monumental. ABBEY ROAD may be the best album the band ever produced (perhaps bettered only by REVOLVER), and the musical inventiveness found throughout shows that, had the Beatles not broken up, they may have been an even more influential band in the 70's than they were in the 60's. The only real downside is the absence of John Lennon on most of the backing vocals. A midsummer car crash, occasional heroin use and his preoccupation with Yoko meant he wasn't available for many of the sessions. But when he WAS there, he dominated. \\"Come Together\\", \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" and \\"Because\\" are among the album's best songs. The beautiful three-part harmony job on \\"Because\\" underscores John's often-overlooked tender side, while Lennon's larynx-shredding \\"yeahhhhhhhhh\\" toward the end of the vocal on \\"I Want You\\" is maybe the single finest moment on this collection. George Harrison, of course, wrote and sang Abbey Road's two best remembered pieces. \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" showed once and for all that Lennon and McCartney (and producer George Martin) made a serious mistake in relegating his songs to the back of the Beatle bus. His zippy guitar intro (and Lennon's backing) also helped make Ringo Starr's \\"Octopus's Garden\\" a really enjoyable track. Paul McCartney, on the other hand, provides my two least favourite songs on Side One: the downright silly \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and the 50's-style throw-back \\"Oh Darling\\" (I agree, John Lennon, you would have sung it better). But his medley on Side Two and his bass playing throughout -- especially on \\"Something\\" -- are fabulous. And his rousing finale, \\"The End\\" was the most fitting way possible to close out this album -- and the band's incredible career.  Each Beatle gets a solo in this song -- first Ringo's one and only drum solo as a Beatle, then a \\"battle of the guitars\\" -- with Paul, then George, then John adding their own characteristic stylings three times each. I don't think this album will ever age. A must for any CD collection.
B00005JLXC|5.0|This is a Terrific Film.<BR>What a great cast it has. I watched this film at Village cinemas southland with my mum and my little brother and i enjoyed it alot.<BR>The film is about young Matt Murdock has just learned a horrible truth. His father Jack is not the man he thought and the discovery wounds him deeply. It also spurs a terrible accident where the young man is doused with radioactive waste. <BR>The disaster leaves Matt blind, but his other senses develop a superhuman acuity; his newly acquired 'radar' allows him to 'see' in ways no other can. <BR>Don't read any reviews of this movie because they will trash it just give it this roller coaster ride of a film 10/10 stars.<BR>Great music score by Greame Revell.<br />Get Ready For This Year's Devil
B00008S2VG|5.0|Let me start of by saying this... if you accept the fact that Madonna's music has changed, then you will love this album.If your waiting to hear something pre-Ray of light, you won't find it here. I was torn as to how many stars i wanted to give this cd. No,it's not Madonna's best album but as a whole cd, it works and flows well. It's a very good album. Although I have to say that the acoustic guitar is a little over done on this collection. Although i've read some bad reviews on the American life single, i think that her voice sounds better than ever and it is a great song. it's all about evolving, which she's done. I think that Madonna is beleiving what she's singing for the first time, i.e \\"Nothing Fails\\"-gorgeous song.Even though this record is dripping in synths, Madonna's vocals warm up every cut on this album. \\"Easy Ride\\", a slower number is gorgeous vocally and lyrically. Definately a song about<BR>finding yourself, which obviously she has. Another personal song on this album i think is \\"Mother and Father\\".Yet again Madonna is singing about her youth and the loss of her mother, but this time its a dance number. Actually this is one of the best songs on the album. \\"nobody knows me\\", the best dance track on the cd sounds like \\"Music\\" and \\"Die Another Day\\" mixed together.HOT! There's really only one song on this album that i don't like. and that is \\"X-Static Process\\".. i dunno, maybe i just don't get it. \\"Hollywood\\"-very cool song that kind of reminds me of \\"Ray of Light\\".Bottom Line- great record from a singer that has only gotten better with time. Her always underrated vocals and lyrics shine on this album.
B00006CXSS|5.0|If you enjoyed Saving Private Ryan, you will surely enjoy Band of Brothers!  This miniseries is not at all a glorification of war, or a pro US series as some people may think. It's sole purpose is to tell the story or some of the members of 101st Airborne&#8217;s Easy Company and to show the sacrifices these men made to the war effort. As realistic as war movies/miniseries get.<BR>You won't be disappointed!
B00006X06U|3.0|After over 35 years of recorded music (the first being 1968's &quot;Song to a Seagull&quot;), this is apparently Joni's farewell. (Of course, another farewell of hers came about in 1972 with &quot;For the Roses,&quot; an album that was followed by some of her best work ever.) Something in me tells me that this time, I should believe Joni. Her lyrics have gone from young and optimistic to dark and bitter, the musings of a person looking back on their life to see if they have accomplished what they wanted to.  The fact that over the years, Joni's voice has gone from high and thin to a dark and husky sound that only just barely resembles her old was enough for me to agree that perhaps it was time for Joni to call it quits.  However, this would not have been the album that I would want a legend to go out on.<br />2 CD set is just a collection of previous Joni songs that have been orchestrated by a symphony with Joni singing along as best she can.  One of the main problems with the interpretations is that too often the compositions are overly done, the orchestra sounds almost like a &quot;rent a band&quot; feel that came up with some new intros and bridges in the songs in order to compensate for the lack of anything really new to do.  Another problem with this is that Joni's songs were never exactly begging to be recorded with a symphony.  Some of the crashing chords and weeping strings turn a once somber, gorgeous song into a laughable parody of itself. It's also rather disheartening to hear Joni wheezing her way through certain songs, clearly out of breath or no longer able to sustain the notes she once effortlessly sang.<br />Not every orchestration on this ablbum is a complete loss: the newly recorded versions of &quot;You Dream Flat Tires&quot; and &quot;Chinese Cafe/Unchained Melody&quot; do retain their kick.  Another great surprise for me was the inclusion of &quot;The Dawntreader&quot; in this final collection.  Joni has rarely ever acknowledged songs from her first album on any &quot;Best of&quot; CD's or compilations or live recordings, (the lone exception being &quot;Cactus Tree&quot; on 1974's &quot;Miles of Aisles&quot;) even 1996's &quot;Hits&quot; jumped over her first album entirely. Hearing the two different versions of &quot;The Dawntreader&quot; recorded 35 years apart is a sobering experience.  It's hearing the Joni that was, and the Joni that is.  Her optimism and high voice have been replaced by wisdom and experience as she looks to the sea. It's one of those emotional moments that only Joni has been able to conjure up in my mind.<br />Buy this CD, but please be aware that it can be a difficult listening experience on many levels.  Long may Joni live.irst album on any &quot;Best of&quot; CD's or compilations or live recordings, (the lone exception being &quot;Cactus Tree&quot; on 1974's &quot;Miles of Aisles&quot;) even 1996's &quot;Hits&quot; jumped over her first album entirely.

B00008H2LB|5.0|There first cd Hybrid Theory was excellent! Reanimation Sucked! I never thought they would come back to being good. I wanted the Cd because I'm such a big fan so I got it the exact day it came out. On March 25, 2003. I listened to it over and over and that cd is the best. Not many people I know of like Linkin Park but I have to disagree with all of them. With Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda and their disturbing yet realistic phsycotic lyrics makes it sound great. All six members have a special part in the band that make the cd even better. I love listening to that cd. The songs are very catchy and it is THE BEST! I sugest you all to get this cd especially is you're a Linkin Park fan!~*~*~
B00008H2LB|3.0|Anything you may have expected from pop-metal is all here on this cd, and the new generation of boys bands goes on, and on.<br />As for the tracks:<BR>1. Foreword - just skip it.<BR>2. Don't Stay - stay here until it ends: the first heavier tune on the cd, not bad.<BR>3. Somewhere I Belong - skip or stay, whatever you like, having listened enough to the first single played heavily by MTV and radiostations.<BR>4. Lying From You - another remarkable song, nice heavy riffs, and the proper vocals, reminds you of the style the boys pretend to belong to.<BR>5. Hit The Floor - one of the heaviest and most industrial-like tunes on the cd, impresses.<BR>6. Easier To Run - well, a nicely packed another ready-to-go single by the band, will definitely be in the charts. Female teens will go crazy.<BR>7. Faint - the most rock-like song off the cd, good catchy melody, and a little sort of screaming, which is so popular among pop-metal bands these days.<BR>8. Figure.09 - one more heavier and faster song, still adds to the &quot;metal&quot; part of the album, and works pretty well.<BR>9. Breaking The Habit - well, what is that?<BR>10. From The Inside - it's heavy and slow, and sounds not worse that Somewhere I Belong, there's something about this track. But what's the something?<BR>11. Nobody's Listening - just do the same.<BR>12. Session - repeat the previous action.<BR>13. Numb - the &quot;ballad&quot;, if you haven't cryed enough having listened to the first twelve tracks you've all the chances to do it now. Females are invited.<br />Not bad this time. Cause might have been worse. And much.
0385486804|4.0|After reading Into the Wild by John Krakauer, I have a new appreciation and respect for nature.  This wonderful book traces the real-life dramatic adventure that is the last year of Chris McCandless' life.  Chris was a boy with a dream to leave the binds of society, and free himself into the purest of nature, the heart of Alaska.  Krakauer, a journalist for Outdoor Magazine, was assigned to write a nine thousand-word article on the boy, took on the task of finding out what really happened to this young lost soul.  He just felt so strongly for the story he had to know as much as he could, not only for himself but also for the confused McCandless family he felt so sorry for.  <BR> Krakauer traveled the long road that McCandless took from his prominent existence in Atlanta, just after he graduated from Emory University with honors; all the way to the Alaskan frontier where Alex's (after Chris left Atlanta he changed his name to Alexander Supertramp) decomposed body was found two and a half weeks after his death.  Based on interviews with people who McCandless encountered on his odyssey, he was able to clearly piece together Alex's last year.<BR> Among the possessions found with Alex's body there were a few books which all seemed to share his outlook, that is: how materialistic the world had become and the only escape was pure nature.  Through the excerpts Krakauer selected to include in this book we see how common Alex's yearn to escape is, especially when he compares the letters of Everett Ruess and McCandless' correspondence to his friends (pgs. 87-97).  As a person who grew up in a very rural area I empathize with his desire to go explore the untainted wild, as I'm sure many people do.  The difference is that Alex actually went.  Whether you come away from the book thinking it was sheerly naveness or boldness that led him to his death, you will not put this book down.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|So it's too long, and it's not perfect, and we<BR>miss Christine McVie.  There's still a wealth of<BR>great music to be heard here, Stevie &amp; Lindsey<BR>sound great together and it's ten times more<BR>interesting and vital than most of the music<BR>released by artists in their age bracket.  Quit<BR>whining about what &quot;could have been&quot; and listen<BR>to what IS.  It's a very good CD.
B00005JLSE|1.0|The Motion Picture Academy must have been out of their minds to give this film a Best Picture Award.  The film is totally miscast (Zellwiger and especially Gere, whose performance is as wooden as Sherwood Forest), and the clumsily-unfolding, simplistic plot is made even worse by second-rate dance numbers which attempt to \\"jazz up\\" the story.  The only thing worth watching is the first-rate song and dance duet performed by Zellwiger and Zeta-Jones, but that occurs in the last ten minutes of an otherwise overrated movie.  I would have had a better time dozing off in an easy chair than watching this drivel.
0553296981|5.0|I first read Anne Frank in the 8th grade and it realy brought the holocaust home for me. It's diffrent reading about Anne vs. a textbook, she really puts a face on WW2. You can't escape the fact that she was a real girl.<br />Like a real girl Anne talks about her sexuality, family, boys, little vanities and insecurties. From her diary pages, you get this sense that she was a wise, intellegent, kind girl caught in a time period gone mad.
B00005JLKN|5.0|Anothny Hopkins reprises his Oscar winning role as the infamous Dr. hannibal Lecter in the thrilling prequel.  This movie is awesome.  The first time I saw it at the movies I loved it.  I wanted to buy it on DVD on the day it came out.  The plot is about FBI profiler Will Ghram who captures Dr. Lecter,  and turns to him for help to capture a more deadlier serial killer called the Red Dragon.  I thought this was a hell of a lot  better than &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs&quot;, and I think &quot;Hannibal&quot; and &quot;Red Dragon&quot; are a tie.  This means, I like them both the same.  I think this is the best one of the three.  The suspense is excellent.  If you're deciding which one to watch pick this one.
B00008S2VH|5.0|Madonna is back and better then ever! This cd is great, though only 11 tracks all are very good:) Favoite tracks are American Life, Hollywood, X-static process, die another day and the best song on the album...Mother and Father.  For any true Madonna fans I highly reccomend this cd, its a lil different then her past albums but its a sure keeper!<BR>Strike a pose!
B000089RVX|5.0|I got the cd because I had seen Bring me To Life on mtv, and it amazed me. It was a mix of hard rock, and a passionate woman's voice. I knew right away it's what I wanted, but still... I didn't expect it to be THIS good. This has to be the best music I have ever heard. It's like I've never listened to any good music ever in my life. I was blown away. My personal favorites are Going Under, Bring Me to Life, and Hello. Hello has to be the most beautiful and saddest song I have ever heard. If you read the lyrics, you'll understand that she's singing about a lost life that she cared about. Most of the songs are very sad, but I think it's because they want you to know that everybody has problems, and I think that's good. Sometimes, if you care that much, words written in the lyrics arn't anything like it sounds, and sometimes the guitar drowns out her voice, but those minor details barely make a difference. This is the best Cd I own. Buy it now!
B00008PW3O|5.0|This album is excellent - the genius of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks is at work.  Astonishing guitar arrangements and vocals make this album a must have...  The second enhanced cd is a must for any Fleetwood Mac fan!!
B000084T18|2.0|This album was hyped through the roof, but when you sit down and listen to it, really listen to it and forget the hype it become clear the album is a rushed lack luster album full of everything that is bad for hip hop. Yes 50, you were shot 9 times, but guess what not many people care and thos who did care have heard you say it 100 times already. The subject matter throughout the album is trite and sends a message that rap music is violent and 50 comes off incredibly shallow, its all guns and drugs. There is a song or 2 thats ok but basically I don't care if 50 got shot, gets high all the time, does'nt call the cops when he is shot or how much he hates lapd or nypd. Do us all a favor, make a reocrd of 2, get the money which is the only reason you are in the game and then get out- we are sick of you already. Your 15 min of fame is ticking away dude. Overall Dissapointing album.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|This album has really wowed me.  Contrary to what others think, I beleive Lindsey Buckingham's guitar arrangements and solos are not off the wall but are the work of a genius.  Songs like &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot; &quot;Come&quot; and Stevie Nick's &quot;Running Through the Garden&quot; and &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot; are proof of this.  Stevie's songs &quot;Say You Will&quot; and &quot;Smile At You&quot; are excellent as well.  Christine McVie's abscence may be seen as detrimental to some, but I feel the Mac is stronger for it.
0440213525|4.0|The Client is an interesting book that takes the readers through a story that involves children, lawyers, and even the mob. John Grisham, who is known for his books involving the law, again does a wonderful job with a story involving the law. The book is a hard one to put down because of its eventful nature.  I found in most chapters that something exciting happened.<BR>Mark Sway, who is eleven, and his younger brother Ricky, who is eight, start out the story going into the woods so Mark can teach Ricky to smoke.  What happens next turns their lives upside down.  They become witnesses to the suicide of Jerome Clifford.  Jerome, who is a lawyer, has troubled past that he's trying to escape by killing himself. As a lawyer of several shady characters, Clifford knew many secrets of criminals.  He knew one, though, that drove him paranoid and to death.  Barry \\"The Blade\\" Muldanno was one of those shady characters and his secret was that he had killed Senator Boyd Boyette.  Before killing himself, Jerome drags Mark into his car and proceeds to tell him the secret of where Boyd Boyette is buried.  This whole scene traumatizes Ricky to the point where he will not talk or move.  When Mark hangs around the scene, the police find out that Mark was at the scene when the suicide takes place. <BR>    The scenes now switch to the hospital where Ricky is being held and its surrounding areas.  The FBI gets involved at this point and wants to talk to Mark.  Mark has watched many movies and knows he needs a lawyer.  After visiting one lawyer who was too busy, Mark almost accidentally comes upon Reggie Love.  Reggie is a female lawyer, who has battled through a divorce and a substance abuse problem.  After getting through her problems, she became a lawyer specializing in child abuse cases.  Mark explains his whole story to her.  She goes with him to the see the FBI and exposes the use of illegal tactics to get what they want.  The cat and mouse game of trying to get Mark to talk eventually leads to Mark going to jail.  He finds a way to escape, though.  The rest of this intriguing story leads to a pretty lame ending, which I will not spoil by explaining.  I was expecting a pretty exciting ending, but I did not get what I expected.<BR>   The story, except for a part here or there, is very believable. The fact that Mark knew all that he did was very believable, because of the way he was explained.  Grisham told how he grew up learning things on his own and also watching movies.  The biggest part I had trouble believing was the fact that the mob was after this little kid.  I guess it could happen, but I had trouble believing that.<BR>    Another good quality of this book was the fact that it was easy to read.  The story flowed together well and at no point did I have to go back to read a part again.  Grisham would flip around to different characters in the story in different chapters, but he did a great job of reminding the reader where each character had left off before starting into something new.  Also, the words he used were not so easy that a child could read the book, but not so hard that the reader needs a dictionary beside them.<BR>    This book appeals to many different readers.  A person who enjoys a fast paced book about the law would really like The Client. Even though I'm not a fan of books about the law, I enjoyed the book a lot.  On a scale of 1-10, I would give the book an 8.  I would also recommend the book to anyone.  I feel that anyone that started reading the book would keep reading it.
B00006HBAJ|5.0|This is a great album. Beck really opens up and shows how mature he really is on this one. Indeed, it's a melancholy album, but it doesn't leave you feeling that way. If anything, it'll help you through feeling like [dirt]. You'll get the feeling Beck is pouring his heart out just for you to hear. Nobody else. This album is a narration for a relationship that went bad. The bonus track 'Ship In The Bottle' is really great. I'm very surprised it wasn't put on the American version because it is just so good. To put it frankly; Go buy this album immediately, even if you don't buy the import, buy 'Sea Change'.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I wasn't one for this type of music until I heard this cd. Don't know why is my favorite. This review coming from a pure rock n roll girl for the past 30 years....who'd of thunk!!!!
6305350205|1.0|So, my first viewing of Star Trek V was in the theaters when it came out.  At the time, the film felt rushed and incongruent.  It left a feeling of \\"lack of resolution\\" and \\"a waste of time.\\"<br />So, when it came out on DVD, I decided to give it another shot...maybe I missed something?<br />Well, needless to say, the second time, it was worse than I remembered.  The film's tone reflects Shatner's acting style.  I much prefer it in the actor, not the directorial persona.<br />There were a few saving graces for the film, specifically the camping scene, the McCory flashback and Kirk questioning G-d.  The peeks into the three main characters' history was a good effort.<br />But, beware, the opening scene is so unbelievable, it impacts a viewer's perception for the rest of the film.  Not that Star Trek itself is particularly believable at times, but it rarely appears \\"staged\\" in the films, at least.<br />The concept was nice, but the introduction of a Vulcan character (trying not to spoil it) that had never before been mentioned in the live shows (animated series doesn't count) seems to fray my Star Trek historical perspective.<br />I tend to write this film off as \\"not counting.\\"  Star Trek VI is their \\"do over\\" and they do it with great success.  <br />As is well known, the \\"evens\\" tend to be much better than the \\"odds.\\"  The best of the \\"odds\\" however, is Star Trek III.  Very well done film, but it's a much different tone than the others.<br />I would recommend the films in this order: II, IV, First Contact/VIII, VI, Nemesis/X, III, Insurrection/IX, Generations/VII, I, V
B000003TAW|5.0|I am so happy from the day my older brother told me about Weezer, it was when the green album came out, and ever since, they've been my favorite band. I Think the blue album is the perfect album, every song is great, and it hits you right in the heart, listening to there album is like the end of the world, and having such great influences such as the beach boys, the beatles, and the cars. It's so catchy and with such harmony, it uplifts your spirit so much, like your in a movie. The end of the album is like the End of a movie. You just can't go on without having the album and listening to it one more time.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna never stops amazing me with her ingenuity and talent. While &quot;American Life&quot; is probably her most &quot;rock&quot; album to date (with lots of guitars on the records), it still has a soft side that's very endearing even for longtime Madonna fans. The song &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; is probably my favorite in this collection.  Big fans of Madonna's dance tracks get their fill of fun tracks too, although the dance grooves are different from your run of the mill dance anthems you hear in clubs today. Buy this CD. You'll enjoy it!
B000001EG6|5.0|The self-titled 'Elton John' is a classic early album from Elton John and Bernie Taupin. The tunes on this collection are instantly assimilated and echo the later 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road' with its variety of song styles. Elton's vocal styling and piano playing is superb on this album, too. On the country influenced 'No Shoe Strings on Louise' he seems to emulate Mick Jagger. The piano rift and tune on 'The Cage' is reminiscent of Carole King. And, the piano and voice on 'Rock-n-Roll Madonna' is a blend of John Lennon and Jerry Lee Lewis.<br />Some songs such as 'Sixty Years On' do sound dated some 30+ years on, but others such as 'The Greatest Discovery' show no signs of aging and improve with each listening.<br />This is definitely classic Elton John. Amazon suggests the combo of this and Tumbleweed Connection. But a better combination is this with 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.' Combine 'Tumbleweed Connection' with 'Capt. Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy' as examples of early Elton John concept albums.
B00008MNYS|5.0|I like \\"Me and My Monkey\\": spanish flavor - mariachi... nice.  Aside from that track the rest of the album is a stellar Robbie pop-rock performance.  Reading the lyrics all I could say was: \\"Tell us how you really feel\\".  I love the message to the critic and the chicks who kiss and tell.  We love celebrities who have real thoughts and opinions rather than going around spouting how great the world is... real life can be [interesting].  Check out the web site for great extras.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This album is probably her best yet... and as soon as memories are associated with it I think it will blow away Like A Prayer and Ray Of Light! Madonna's 9th full studio album American Life is a confesional of sorts... she invites you in and it feels like she is singing to you! Heavy influences of guitar are throughout and stings and of course electronic effects as well. This album blew me away! The highlights are many, starting with Hollywood going to Love Profusion and Nobody Knows Me and Nothing Fails (which by the way may be her best song ever!)to Intervention and X-static Process and Mother & Father and Die Another Day and Easy Ride... if you count I don't really like only 2 tracks and by the way I love the title track but it's [bad] compaired to this album!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I'm a huge Godsmack fan and this album didn't disappoint. This is one of the most solid rock cds I've heard in a while, there's no filler. Godsmack starts the cd off with a bang with the single \\"Straight Out of Line\\", it's one of my favorites. Some of my other favorites are the title track (Faceless), Changes, Re-Align, Serenity, and I Stand Alone. I highly recommend this cd to any fan of hard rock, you won't be sorry.
038572179X|5.0|I probably read one piece of modern fiction a year that is really, really good -- if that.  This book was one of them.  It was amazing.  It begins with a terrible, but understandable, mistake, which the author calls a crime, committed by a naive, silly, self-important little girl, which ruins the lives of two people close to her.  It is real, she is real, they are real.  The war scenes that follow are as genuine and as intense as anything in &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; or &quot;Journey to the End of the Night&quot; - they convey the confusion, horror and futility of war, at least for the common soldier.  I can't believe this man has not been to war - which, given his nationality and his apparent age, must be the case.  The ending is startling, and, to me, terrible.  It was worth my time.  If you like the first chapter or two, it is well worth yours.
0062513346|4.0|This was the third book I read for Coelho, the first two being the Alchemist and on the River Piedra..., although this is a different one, I still enjoyed it. However, my personal view is that this book is not for anyone anytime, it is written more for persons who are indeed going through an intense self-searching phase. If you are coming out of a personal crisis or feel like you are entering such one in your life, this book can be a big help. Don't let all the talk of angels and mysticism put you off as this is Coelho's style and you can easily replace them as metaphors.
B00005YUTD|4.0|My son really enjoys watching this video, and I think it's far superior to almost all of what's available on the television.  I would suggest that if a parent wants the full developmental benefit, she has to sit with the child and participate in what's going on (as the makers of the video suggest).<br />The only real drawback is that I don't approve of the way the older child is flattered on this video.  She's encouraged to see herself as the \\"star\\" and gets big laughs for every comment she makes.  I would hope most parents know better than to treat their kids this way- it does not lead to high self-esteem, only to a swollen head!  But since she's only featured for about a minute of video time, it's not too big a deal.<br />I will be investing in the DVD as a birthday gift to my son, and sharing it with my future kids.  Worth the money!
B00008AY3L|1.0|i work in a music store and the little hip kids come in and play this album all the time.<br />ATTENTION! DO NOT BUY! THIS IS GARBAGE!
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna's \\"American Life\\" continues where \\"Music\\" left off, but gives you even more insight into her thoughts and dreams.  Every song on this album is a personal statement dealing with the pitfalls of fame, the emptiness of fortune and the delusion that what we all strive for...really doesn't equal to the power of loving and being loved.  That is why this album will be a hit.  You can picture Madonna singing these songs to her loved ones, but it's also the kind of music that you can make your own.<br />Songs that are the bomb in my opinion:  Hollywood, Love Profusion, Nothing Fails (the best!), X-Static Process, Mother and Father.  They have \\"hit\\" written all over them.  The remaining songs are very catchy and fun.  Overall, it makes a great Spring/Summer album that will put you in the best mood.  Cheers to Madonna for outdoing herself once again!
B000001FZK|5.0|How should I use my lunch money? <br />I think I shall go with Talk Talk.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This has to be one of her best records ever. American Life is truly a work of art. All the tracks are excellent! \\"American life\\" is a perfect track to open up the album and it's a short bio of the singer's life. The second track \\"Hollywood\\" is great and so is her singing on this track. \\"Love Profusion\\" is one of the best songs on this record. \\"Nobody knows me\\" is a very danceable track and i love her vocals in this track. \\"X-Static Process\\" is one of her best ballads! And \\"Mother and Father\\" has got to be the best track on this album. It sounds like something she would have produced in her earlier years (80's). Her vocals on this track are the best. All the other songs are excellent too its just that i dont have time to write about every single one. Overall this CD is great. Well worth your money and you wont regret buying this Cd! So go out now and get a copy of Madonna's AMERICAN LIFE!!!
0790731452|5.0|The first time I saw Mars Attacks, I loved it.Now with the DVD released, I love it even more.The picture and audio quality is in perfect condition (actually even better than the movie version), and thankfully the DVD supports widescreen and fullscreen.The extras thrown in are pretty nice, too.I found the production notes really interesting.Tim Burton's definitely made this a spoof of past 50's alien movies, but this one pulls it off by making it funny yet fun to watch at the same time.The cast is amazing, with support by Jack Nicholson, Anette Bening, Natalie Portman, Tom Jones, Danny Devito, and a lot of other worthwhile people.If you haven't seen it yet, you really need to buy this DVD.One of Burton's best.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Stand By Me is one of the best coming of age movies. It really touches your heart. The story of the four boys helps you understand different real life situations. In the scene where Chris (River Phoenix) cries, you know that he is a boy who has a bad reputation because of his brothers, but deep down he is a very sensitive and loving kid. It is also a movie with an adventure to it. Normally when you think about a movie about boys, it has an adventure involved. Stand By Me is great and once you see the movie, the book is also great to read. The book is titled &quot;The Body&quot;, by the excellent author, Stephen King and can be found in his book &quot;Different Seasons.&quot;
B00006RU5B|5.0|Great cd. One of my favorites of all time.They are better than Soundgarden,can't really compare them to Rage because there so different.

6304779356|5.0|The Lost Boys is a \\"Hip, comic twist on classic vampire stories\\" (as written by The New York Times). It is not only scary, but very chilling as well. The bone-grating soundtrack, adds to the suspense genre. The movie also has some humor as well as some great drama. A great cast of Jason Patric, Jami Gertz, Kiefer Sutherland, Corey Feldman, Corey Haim, Barnard Hughes and Edward Herrmann adds to the movie a spark of ghoulish entertainment.
B000002H4Q|5.0|\\"Kiss me kiss me kiss me\\" was the first Cure album that I bought and I can clearly say that it was good enough to make me take the step to becoming a cure fan.First of all Robert Smith is an excellent song writer and a very talented composer.He has the kind of talent that can rarely be seen.Again he sings in this album about love,misery,joy,passion,anger,hate...briefly about life,a very common subject but their expressions are so unique and touchy that if you have a heart and nerves you get hooked instantly and inevitably.<BR>About the album:The songs beside the well known singles\\"Catch\\",\\"Why can't I be you\\"(The acoustic version of this song on the greatest hits collection is also pretty cool and notable),\\"Just like Heaven\\"and\\"Hot Hot Hot\\",I also like \\"Torture\\",\\"How beautiful you are\\"(a pretty melodical love song),\\"Icing Sugar\\",\\"Shiver and Shake\\",\\"Snake Pit\\" and finally \\"The Kiss\\",the perfect opening song that always has the ability to touch my every little nerve cell.My personal opinion about the album is that it can stand alone as a brief-but not enough of course-summary to what The Cure is.It has the clues to both dark and bright,happy perhaps,sides of them so it can be a perfect start for the beginners.Also 17 is a very satisfiying number of songs for one CD and even if you don't like some of the songs you will still have nearly a whole album to enjoy but believe me you won't have to skip even one song.This is really a very good album.Probably no need to mention but these are also highly recommended:Disintegration,Head on the Door and Pornography.
B00005J6UP|5.0|The Goonies is a great movie for kids, as well as adults.<BR>It has humor in it and adventure. The movie has thieves, skeletons, booby traps, caves, underground tunnels, a winding water slide, a pirate ship and a monster with a face only a mother could love. The Goonies is a great coming of age movie and it is great to watch on a family night.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I've been a long time fan of Madonna and have to admit that I did not care for her last two singles, Die Another Day and American Life.  So, I was a bit worried when I picked up the album that it would be more of the same electronica mess.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised that there are a number of songs that actually showcase her voice without all those blips and whistles and there is a return to beautiful melodies.  I was blown away by the track \\"Nothing Fails\\" and think it is one of the prettiest songs she has ever produced.  She has never sounded better and when the choir kicks in - amazing!  \\"Hollywood\\" is a bit of fun and definately single-worthy.  Other highlights for me are the dance track \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" and the folk ballad \\"X-Static Process\\".  This album does not reach the heights that she set with Ray of Light or Like a Prayer but it is definately worth owning and gets better with each listen.
B00006AUIG|5.0|Session 9, was a very thrilling movie with twists and turns. I loved it because it was a mystery with a scary setting and creepy mood. I live right near the Danvers State Hospital, and that is another reason why I liked it. The director took a historical building, and put it to a great use. The movie is also well presented with awesome actors such as David Caruso and Josh Lucas. All the actors put on such a great performance and I highly recomend this movie for anyone who wants a great thrill. The movie might scare you or leave you with an odd feeling, but either way you should really enjoy it if you like mystery and suspense films.
0688163173|3.0|If only people realized that it is not enough for a book (or a film) to have a great ending to make it great. It needs more. It needs a solid beginning. It needs solid characters. And it needs adequate pacing and plotting to keep your interest through the whole thing. Dennis Lehane never had a problem with this before. As a matter of fact, his Mystic River was one of the best myseteries of the last decade (if not THE best). But with Shutter Island, he tried something different, moving out of the dark mystery field to create a hybrid story. Maybe he should have stuck with what he's best known for...<br />Here, we have a detective who goes to the state prison/asylum on Shutter Island to investigate the disappearence of a female patient. Only, he and his partner stumble on something greater, something darker, and something that very might spell their demise.<br />Saying too much about the plot would be to ruin a quick and slightly entertaining story, because everything seems to serve the ending. Yes, this is a book that reads well and fast. Yes, it does provide many very entertaining moments, and moments of intense suspense. But in the end, all of that just wasn't enough to save this book.<br />Lehane is trying to up his position on the crime fiction list with this one. But this book does very little to prove to readers that he's the best at what he does. And yes, the book does have a great twist ending that you might or might not see coming, but that either isn't enough to save the book.<br />In the end, Shutter Island is a slightly entertaining effort from an author capable of much better. I wanted more out of these characters and the situations they find themselves in. There is a lot of potential behind this story, but because the characters are so thin, it is never achieved. I wanted more out of the plot (the book is barely 300 pages long!). And I wanted more overall from Lehane.
B00006F83Y|2.0|Why so many rock critics and reviewers got so wound up over this album I don't know. I bought it based on those recommendations, and also because \\"No One Knows\\" is a pretty irresistible song.  But make no mistake, the rest of it typifies the usual tinny-sounding one-note-played-ad-nauseum alt-rock [stuff] that's been churned out for close to a decade now. It's not a BAD album, but to say it's head and shoulders above everything else out there is laying it on way too thick. Plus - why did Dave Grohl even want to get involved in this thing? His talents are thoroughly WASTED, as he's buried behind a sludgy wall of fuzzed out guitars and vocals sounding like they're coming through a cheap transistor radio, and there's nothing in the arrangements that allow him to really show himself off. <br />I've almost carted this thing back to the used CD store a couple times, but I've started to listen to it more, which means either I don't dislike it as much as I used to, or I'm at least tolerating it and trying to justify spending money on it. I doubt it will ever become one of my \\"must-listen-to\\" albums though.
B00005QXDD|4.0|This CD comes from a talanted duo that debatedly waste their talents making goofy songs.  With that out of the way, this CD is HILARIOUS!  While sometimes innapropriate, this CD fires on all cylinders by delivering funny lyrics and goofy music while being backed by one of the most talented drummers in the world, Dave Grohl.  If you like music sort of like the Bloodhound Gang only with a rock edge, pick this album up!
B00003CXXO|5.0|This wonderment of a film takes place in a future that presupposes the ice caps have melted from the greenhouse effect, and that man is mastering the art of making robots who look so real that you can only tell them apart from people because they look perfectly healthy and, well, man is not.  Robots to be soldiers, servants, even lovers.  In this environment a scientist takes the next step and creates a robot child, and finds a way to make him feel love for his human \\"mommy.\\"  What happens along the way is not formula and is not forced.  What happens is magic.<br />I can understand why there's such a wide variance of opinion on this film.  Amid the long stretches of beauty and heart-wrenching emotional themes, there are inserted jarring moments of seediness, violence, and echoes of many Spielberg & Kubrick films, including \\"2001,\\" \\"Close Encounters,\\" \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" and \\"E.T.,\\" with a little \\"Mad Max\\" thrown in for flavor.  It's a lot to take in, and its unevenness makes one uncertain if it's a kid's movie (it often seems like one) or not (no, I won't be explaining to my child what a gigolo is).<br />But this long-awaited film receives my highest praise for several other reasons.  First, life itself is a bit uneven, isn't it?  The film's jarring moments prevent it from being predictable in any way, and that's welcome in a world filled with movies written by pea-brains who seem to have Xeroxed somebody else's script and changed the names and locations.<br />Beyond that, the phenomenal talent of kid actor Haley Joel Osment, perhaps better known for \\"The Sixth Sense.\\"  This little guy is a better actor than most grownups; there's not a false note in his performance.  Also the magical sheen of music that hangs behind the visual like a luminescent backdrop, the special effects that rival anything seen in any \\"Matrix\\" film, the believable and understandable relationships of the characters, and above all, the story itself, which is a sure draw for anyone who, like me, is a sucker for unrequited love.
B000083LQB|5.0|This was an extremely good idea by Sonic Youth to rerelease all their songs plus the b-sides. This album is absolutely amazing how it is, but with the added stuff it only gets better! If you loved Dirty, You'll love this even more!
0156027321|5.0|I read this book in two nights!  I stayed up till 4-5am one night because I couldn't put it down, and I never stay up that late (I had to get to work that morning!).  However it was worth the sleepy day ahead because the book was absolutely riveting.  The story weaves in and out between reality and fantasy and I love that--it's a perfect allegory to the way humans perceive the world around them.  The ending left me breathless and pondering the psychology of humans.  You'll love it!
B00005JLRR|3.0|I am at a quandry in this review.  This film is certainly better than some of its predecessors, but weaker by far than the best.  Basically, it amounts to an average Trek movie, and hence, I would rate it at 2 and a half stars if halves were allowed.<br />The film had its moments in purpose and in action, but spent far too much time and effort dwelling upon setting up for the climax.  Much too \\"talky\\" as the movie continues to reiterate the same points over and over again.  For instance, there is a scene where the villanous Shinzon makes a surprise visit to the Enterprise with an offer/request to Picard.  While the visual of Shinzon walking through the captain's desk was striking, his speech and Picard's response was precisely the same as was presented mere minutes before.  No new ground was explored in either the relationship nor in the conflicting situation.  Shinzon's presence left the chambers with still no resolution nor any progress toward the plot, making this scene one of those questions about why it wasn't edited out of the final cut.  Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk ... with nowhere to go.<br />Is it worth seeing?  Yes.  Is it worth owning it on tape or dvd?  Ehhhh ... only if you are truly a fan.
B00008S2VH|4.0|Well, I wasn't thrilled at once. I had to listen a couple of times before this cd really hit me. And I must say, it's quite a different ride, compared with 'Music'. Now I  really love it. Madonna is in a reflective mood here, talks about life expectations, the price of succes, and inner feelings. &quot;I'm not religious...makes me wanna pray&quot;. That's the general atmosphere of these ballads, because ballads they  are. It's a sort of singer-songwriter album this time. The music is laid back. She has left the dancefloor and gives us an insight in her private life. 'Hollywood' is an exeption, it drives along as a trip through Beverly Hills introduced by real birds singing...beautiful. But the real gem is 'X Static Process', believe me or not...I had to cry! It's such a moving, 'spiritual' song. But above all, I never knew she could sing that well. <BR>So...hear for yourself, in the end it's worth it.
B00005JLWL|5.0|I'm not much of a writer, but what I do know is a good movie. I actually saw this movie by mistake, tickets were sold out to Lord of the Rings so we went to see this at the time, and I never regreted it. I saw this movie twice and I love it, even my wife love this movie. I wanted to see it again but it was already taken off the screen at my local theater, now its about to be released on DVD, what a bonus to have this movie so soon. The plot leaves much to be desired but the action sequence makes up for any shortfall. I think of it as a Matrix type movie at probably 1/3 the budget but on par with the action and imagination. Watch it and you too will know what 'Gunkata' means.
B00005JLK1|5.0|The critics did not like Ghost Ship. Thats not hard to believe, but they do not view films the way ordinary people do. Ghost Ship was extremely well-done by a future horror master, Steve Beck. His visual qualities are amazing. This film was great. I saw it in the movies after 8 Mile sold out. I was so surprised at how engrossing it was.<br />Though some sections were not the most thrilling sequences, I still believe this was a great popcorn flick. Julianna Margulies does an amazing job as the a salvager trying to haul in a ship, that was lost years ago, with her crew. The fortunate situation turns to unfortunate when they start to find out the ships history. With an opening sequence that was beyond original, this film keeps you guessing till the very end.<br />The DVD is superb. Picture and sound are both top-notch and without a flaw. The extras are great, they include: 3 HOW-THEY-DID-IT pieces, on location footage, never-before-seen footage, and much much more. This DVD is definately worth a rental, and certainly worth the buy.<BR>You Will BE Pleased.
B000003RCY|5.0|This cd is even better than Sehnsucht for the rock of it.  Just as the cover is fleshjy, so is the music full of energy
B000089A07|5.0|My favorite film character of all time, the notorious Hannibal Lecter, is gracing film for the last time. Red Dragon is acted with delight and directed with the best. Brett Ratner shocked critics and audiences when he made Red Dragon work.<br />Anthony Hopkins returns as the cannibalistic doctor who was caught by Will Graham(Edward Norton). Will Graham retires from the FBI, but returns when asked to help find THE TOOTH FAIRY(Ralph Fiennes). The cast is asembaled well. The suspense is good and the overall atmosphere is fantastic. <br />The DVD is the best. I had to search everywhere for the Director's Edition and when I found it I was pleased. The Directors Edition includes another disc of extras that aim to please. The picture is fantastic and the sound is crystal clear. The extras include: criminal profile of Hannibal, life history of Hannibal, Hannibal's FBI case file, commentary, deleted scenes, (disc 2) directors journey, directors student film, screen tests, makeup application, and much much more.<br />So if you like thrillers and a good cast, this is a definate buy. If not, be sure to rent it.

B00005JL7Q|5.0|I must admit when I first saw this movie in the theatre I didn't care for it much because I was not on the right wavelength. After a second (and third, and fourth) viewing however, I look back and don't understand why I couldn't recognize it as the truly great movie that it is. There is a ton of dry, high brow humor here. Hugh Grant remains the cinema king of light hearted humor... But let's hope he goes back to playing more likeable characters, which is what we know him best for.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Twenty years into the musical career of the true American idol, we are left with questioning our own existence in America and as a whole, the rest of the world.<BR>The first track is the ode to superficial comfort, \\"American Life\\", which could be summed up to displaying the current state of our fascination with image instead of quality.  How our culture is happy with not thinking of global issues and what the Beatles have done before her, that love is the answer.<BR>Mrs. Ritchie explores her pain as an actress with the superb, \\"Hollywood\\".  Take that movie critics, this actress isn't going anywhere, due to the fact that her music is the reason we are still enthralled with her, and for some reason, I think she knows that.<BR>She also makes fun of herself on the fillers, \\"I'm So Stupid\\" and \\"Die Another Day\\".  Two of her least successful songs on any of the her albums. <BR>\\"Love Profusion\\" is the one of her best vocal performances and the song is basically the cousin of \\"Dont' Tell Me\\".<BR>It's also not hard to believe that Madonna's conceptual reverence to Kraftwerk is evident on \\"Nobody Knows Me.\\"  It actually makes you want to breakdance.<BR>The next three songs are Madonna's strongest performances ever on record, \\"Nothing Fails\\", \\"Intervention\\" and the Nick Drake inspired \\"X-Static Process\\".  These three tracks will stand the test of time, according to Madonna fan websites.  The fans have spoken and this is the reason we are still fans of her music.<BR>Madonna's demons are still haunting her which is clear on \\"Mother and Father\\".  Actually, one can make a whole cd of Madonna's songs that deal with  her family.  \\"Promise to Try\\", \\"Oh Father\\", \\"Mer Girl\\" and \\"Inside of Me\\".  This track would fit comfortably with those classics.<BR>The last song and the most haunting is another poetic tribute to her current state of life, her family.<BR>In the twenty years of her music career she has helped up in the process of growing up, dealing with family, loss, religion, sex andmost important, love.  <BR>A beautiful album buy the world's true star.  Take a bow, Mrs. Ritchie.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna's latest CD release, \\"American Life\\" has to be her most personal and risky piece of work yet.  Never fear though, Madonna has turned a risky move into a beautiful album filled with electronica, acoustic sounds, with a little classical all wrapped up into one.  Highlights include \\"Nothing Fails\\", \\"X-Static Process\\", and \\"Hollywood\\".  If you enjoyed \\"Ray Of Light\\" and \\"Music\\", you will fall in love with \\"American Life\\".
B00003CXTG|2.0|Maybe - maybe - something can be said for the special effects in this film. The aerial sequences were exciting. The images of ships rolling over and bombs triggering - while flatly inaccurate - were nice eye candy.<br />But 'Pearl Harbor' as a whole is a disappointment. The plot is both long-winded and thin. It makes a friendly nod towards historical and technical accuracy, yet nonetheless falls short on a number of counts.<br />What's mystifying is that it didn't need to. For instance, the full drama of the Doolittle Raid was *not* presented faithfully by this film. Find any photo of Hornet launching the bombers and note the condition of the seas. The film shows Hornet launching in calm water and bright sunlight: in truth Hornet was ploughing through waves so high they broke over her forecastle, and the bombers' launch was timed so as not to send them straight into the sea. The film could have been more dramatic - and truer to history - by capturing such details ... but its makers choose not to.<br />Instead it focuses on an uninspiring love story and special effects.<br />The truly sad thing about the movie is the opportunities its makers passed up. The first year of the war in the Pacific has no shortage of dramatic and worthwhile stories: Pearl Harbor, the last 30 days of the carrier Yorktown, the Battle of Midway, the pivotal confrontation at Guadalcanal. None of these stories have a modern telling that takes full advantage of film-making technology: all of them deserve it. The film 'Pearl Harbor' falls short of its potential - and one might argue its responsibility - to tell the story of 7 December 1941 for its own sake, on its own terms.<br />Its makers apparently felt the need to pretty up and dilute the story for, one assumes, commercial gain. It's difficult to dispute the film's commercial success, but one wonders if a more truthful film could not have enjoyed similar success ... and contributed much more to its viewers' understanding of history.
B00005O5JV|4.0|When it first came out in theatres, I thought it was going to be pretty stupid.  But watching it on cable, I found it to be pretty funny.  Reese's character was out of tune with reality until she applied herself in law school and used her beauty smarts to prove her client to be innocent.  She was considered stupid and ignorant on the campus, but turned out to be one you can easily get along with.  This movie was funny and entertaining.
B00006JDVV|3.0|When I found out what \\"Reign of fire\\" was about, I thought: there's a great idea. After watching the movie, I thought: there's a great idea, misused.<br />Imagine a race of dragons that have been asleep for the past several millions of years, a race of dragons that is responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs, a race of dragons that is inadvertently awaken in 2010 by a tunnel excavation. Suddenly, Earth has millions of dragons flying over its surface, destroying everything (including human race) to eat the remaining ashes. That's the problem: it's too sudden.<br />\\"Reign of fire\\" goes from the discovery of the sleeping dragon under London immediately to ten years after, 2020, when the remaining of humans are living in very distant (from each other) castle-like strongholds, and all their efforts are sumarized in trying to live as long as they can. The destruction of Earth is kind of \\"thrown in\\" in the movie in the form of magazines covers and newspapers lines, using no more than 60 seconds. This is a let down, since in my opinion it should be in itself a great plot for a movie, but \\"Reign of fire\\" just jumps ahead ten years in the future.<br />Christian Bale is Quinn, the kid who discovered the first dragon, now living as a chief of one of the strongholds. Suddenly (everything is sudden in the movie), an outcast army of kentuckians lead by Van Zan (the bald Matthew MacConnaughey) arrives in England with new dragon-fisiological discoveries that may be able to help destroying the winged beasts (this is a very weak part of the script also - the discoveries about dragon reproduction).<br />This is the kind of movie that has a bad scrip based on a terrific idea (yes, a terrific idea, even if it's impossible: remember, movies are meant to be entertainment). Not even good actors such as Bale and MacConnaughey are able to save \\"Reign of fire\\" from failure (not a tremendous failure, but failure indeed if you think about what it could have been).<br />The best part of the movie is the computer-created dragons, very realistic and evil faced. Also, it was a very good idea to make the new Earth visually resemble the Middle Ages, as far as I know the cradle of dragon stories.<br />Grade 6.8/10the movie is the computer-created dragons, very realistic and evil faced.

B000002MG1|2.0|Automatic for the People recently popped up as a recommendation for me here on Amazon, which caused me to pause and try to remember the last time I had listened to it.  I heard a couple of songs, such as Man in the Moon and Nightswimming recently when going through some mixed tapes from the early nineties, but other than that have not listened to the albumn in seval years.  While some reviews claim that this is the best REM albumn ever, my copy and the extra one I inherited somewhere along the way from an ex-girlfriend, have been relegated to the bottom of my stack of CD's, whereas other REM cd's such as Murmur, Lifes Rich Pagent, and Reckoning still sound as fresh as the day I bought them.  I still listen to these, and there is nothing better than popping in Murmur after a long day in the office, putting the top down, and driving home to Radio Free Europe.  It's been twenty years since Murmur came out and its songs are still fresh.  It has only been eleven since Automatic came out, and the songs have no longevity.
B0000640VN|3.0|Meg Ryan is not the pretty young little blondie girl she used to be in movies like \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" and \\"French kiss\\" anymore. Not at all. Now past forty, it's a mistake to go after parts that used to be perfect for her up to five years ago. I mean, in \\"Kate &amp; Leopold\\", Meg's age shows in her face. I liked her a lot in previous light comedies as the ones above and other like \\"Joe versus the volcano\\" and, most of all, \\"When Harry met Sally\\", but this (\\"Kate &amp; Leopold\\") is too much. And that's just the first annoying thing on the movie.<br />I can put up with a script that deals with things like traveling in time (example: \\"Back to the future\\" is one of my favorite movies), and a XIXth century guy trying to live a week in 2001 New York: movie scripts are like that, they're meant to be entertaining; even if they are based upon the most preposterous assumptions, if the movie is good, funny, has good actors, whatever, if you really like the movie it usually doesn't matter that much if the script is a little absurd.<br />What I can't stand, and there is plenty of it in \\"Kate &amp; Leopold\\", is a script that treats the viewers as dumb people. Anachronisms are ok, even understandable when dealing with movies that deal with past times; script writers aren't supposed to know everything. But in this case, the writers didn't even make the shallowest research. If they wanted Leopold to say things about \\"La Boheme\\", \\"Tosca\\", if they wanted him to say things about Jack the Ripper, if they wanted to be smart and base parts of the plot on the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, why did they make Leopold come from 1876, before all those things happened?<br />\\"Kate &amp; Leopold\\" would be completely forgotten when you were past the theater's exit doors, except for the fact that Hugh Jackman saves the movie. A very talented actor, Jackman makes you believe he's really from XIXth century, and his old fashioned etiquette lessons provide the story with some very funny situations. Jackman's name should, in the least, appear before Meg Ryan's in the credits, since he's the one actor who carries the movie on his back. Live Shreiber doesn't show himself too much and Breckin Meyer does the only character he knows. So, that's it: \\"Kate &amp; Leopold\\" is one of those disposable, forgettable comedies that may lighten up a day if you don't pay attention to a bad-written script. I did, that's why only three stars. Anyway, a light entertainment for a normal day.<br />WARNING: don't watch it with your girlfriend; even if you're the best boyfriend in the world, she will compare your present-day manners to the \\"obviously\\" better male manners of XIXth century.<br />Grade 6.8/10tuations.

B00008977N|5.0|I got the VHS of this concert a couple of years ago.  The DVD is a vast improvement in almost every way.<br />For me, this tour was one of the best PG concerts I've ever seen.  The \\"Growing Up\\" tour was incredible, but I think this show had better showmanship and activity--and also a bit of a better selection of songs.<br />Really, who is a better showman out there than Peter Gabriel?  I don't think any other act--with the possible exception of Pink Floyd/Roger Waters or *possibly* Tool--approaches a concert as theater to the extent that PG does.  It isn't just the songs, it is an artistic push for mood, costume, lighting, and *story*.  On this tour, Peter and band use two stages (one male, one female) connected by a catwalk and moving sidewalks.<br />The extras are also great with a \\"making of\\" doc that has Peter deconstructing the show and the sets.  Rather than pure self-promotion, this segment really gives you a feel for all of the blood, sweat, and tears that went into creating this show.  There's also a really great remix of \\"Steam\\", a pretty neat timelapse of setting up and striking the show, as well as previewing \\"Growing Up\\".<br />My one complaint about this DVD is that it is pretty clear at least some of Peter's vocals were re-recorded in studio.  There's no breathing (PG spends about a third of the concert in motion), no mic fades, and the audio doesn't always match up with the video.  This is pretty typical of PG who apparently did the same for the VHS version, the Secret World CD and Peter Gabriel Plays Live CDs (he said as much in the \\"Plays Live\\" liner notes).  For me it is maddening.  I've seen PG live 6 times now (soon to be 7 or 8 as the Growing Up 2003 tour shapes up) and I have never heard a missed note or a crack.  Even if such a thing should show up, it's a LIVE performance, isn't it?  The perfectionist leanings that PG has are admirable, but I believe this goes to far and takes away from his live recordings.<br />Most people don't seem to mindthis, but I wanted to point it out.<br />To those of you complaining about the video compared to the VHS version, I have both and I've watched them closely:  The VHS is full-screen and cuts off the edges.  The DVD is not a cropping.  The picture in the DVD is a little darker, but a whole lot sharper.  I'm no expert but I believe that when the VHS edit was mastered, it was \\"sweetened\\" to make it look more like video: a little more colorful and brighter but a little more distorted.  This looks more like film.  <br />As for the audio, you can't compare the two: the VHS comes nowhere near the quality of the DVD.  I can't compare it to the LD version, but the DVD mix is much more discrete and allows for a better feel for the full range of percussion--though Tony Levin fans might want to turn the bass up a bit; I think the low range was de-emphasized a bit to keep it from taking over.<br />Overall, this is an excellent DVD and well worth buying even if you've already bought the VHS.  If only more acts put as much effort into their live performances as Peter does.<br />Enjoy!
B00005YUTD|4.0|Our 6 month old LOVED Baby Mozart since she was about 2 months old, and it's one of the few things that will calm her down when she's pitching a fit - which is why we also got BABY BACH. Well, at first she had NO interest in the little kids and laughing audience sounds, and she still doesn't seem to like the music as much!In fact, her favorite part is at the end: when they play snippets from Baby Mozart she immediately looks at the screen - has anyone else discovered this too? Also, there are too many static images of musical instruments - why don't they show someone playing them? She likes it more now than when we first got it, but unfortunately it's not the one of the best in the series.
B00005JLRT|1.0|IMHO, the Star Trek Franchise® ran out of steam sometime around 1996. Voyager was lame, the TNG movies--which had some promise with \\"First Contact\\"--fizzled out.<br />How could Science Fiction become so boring? This movie is like a checklist. Evil brother of an existing character that's never been seen before? Got it. A voice from the past threatens the future, done. Big space battle, check. Lots of special effects, got it. Evil looking BDSM-wearing bad guys who want to destroy Earth for some reason, check. <br />Watching this movie, you get the feeling that the actors feel the same way. As soon as one of them is about to do something different or intersting, the film cuts away. No wonder they all look bored.<br />With the focus on following the formula, you would think that they would at least try for some consistency. At the end of DS9, Worf became ambassador to Klingon but here he's back at his old post as security officer on board Enterprise. Wesley left starfleet to go with the Traveller, but here he is in Starfleet uniform. I guess we're supposed to pretend that the TV show never existed, which might be one way to make this movie watchable I suppose.<br />Watching this movie, you have to believe that Berman--or whoever's in charge--has no clue. Pick up any anthology of ten Sci-Fi stories and you'll find ten ideas more original than any of the ST:TNG pictures, doing a massive disservice to fans. (\\"First Contact\\", the only watchable picture in the TNG series, relies on that boring old chestnut \\"time travel\\").<br />It is time to either reinvent the franchise (and \\"Enterprise\\" ain't gonna do it) or put it to bed. The well has been dry for quite some time now.
B0000844I8|5.0|I'm not sure what makes the ultimate edition much different from the special edition, as both include the director's cut and theatrical version. The ultimate edition does include a 'making of' featurette, as well as a 'Is there a stargate' featurette that isn't included on the special edition. These are both interesting, but nothing to write home about. One big difference is the audio. The ult. ed. includes DTS 6.1 audio, as well as dolby digital 5.1.<br />Good: Being a fan of Stargate SG-1, I wanted to own the original movie as well, and when the ult. ed. was released, knew it was time to buy. I watched the director's cut, and was amazed. There were added scenes, as well as extended existing scenes. These changes really gave me a better understanding of how things in the tv show came to be the way they are, such as the relationship between Jack O'Neill and Daniel Jackson. In the director's cut, we see more interaction between them. We also get more into the head of Jack, and better understand just how messed up he really is after the loss of his son.<br />Bad: The only disappointment I have with the ult. ed. is that there were no 'gag reels' or bloopers, or other deleted scenes included. I enjoy watching these on other DVDs I have, and would have loved to have seen them for Stargate.<br />Overall, I'm glad I added this DVD to my collection. My only wish is that the Stargate SG-1 DVDs included behind the scenes or blooper reels as well.
B00008OLYN|4.0|Opeth's latest album \\"Damnation\\" takes a step away from the usual death growls and hard hitting riffs of Opeth's music for a much softer, acoustic laden approach. This is a big change for Opeth and they pull it off very well, but in the end I still felt something missing. <BR>Let me just say first that this record is a great pleasure to listen to, especially on those dreary rainy days. Some violin and keyboard work is introduced to Opeths music, and a great welcome it is, just adding to the already great diversity that makes this amazing band so original and probably the BEST black/prog metal band alive. The record opens up great with the first track \\"Window Pane.\\" Michael Akerfeldt's voice has never sounded more brilliant, and the violins really give it a step up. This great sound continues with tracks 2 and 3, \\"In my time of Need\\" and \\"Death whispered a lullaby.\\" After this, some of the record magic, even though still sounding great, diteriorates a bit. First off, track 4 \\"Closure\\" though being a pretty good song, feels too short, the same goes for track 5. Usually Opeth's softer melodies run a lot shorter then their hard hitters but the longest song on this record was track 1 clocking in at about 7 and 1/2 minutes. The rest fall into about the typical 4-6 minute range. This isn't typical Opeth, b/c these guys diversify each song so well, it's almost like they don't want it to end. Anyways, things pick up on track 6 \\"To Rid the Disease.\\" This song is nothing short of beautiful, definitely a tie with the first track as the best song on the record, and makes this warrented for purchase in itself. The next track \\"Ending Credits\\" is a pretty good instrumental but I've heard better instrumentals from Opeth. The record ends very strangely and bleakly with \\"Weakness.\\" This song doesnt even really feel like a song, but more of some kind of artistic ballad. Very mellow guitars and mild percussion play background to distorted vocals throughout. It ends pretty suddenly and leaves this record with a feeling of despair, which is what I think Opeth was going for so it works out very well for the feeling Opeth was looking for on the record as a whole. I wouldn't really care to hear the song over and over again though. <BR>Though this is a very beautiful record, I still feel Opeth could've played out a few of the tracks longer, most especially \\"Closure.\\" Some of it kind of feels too short, as a whole though, this is a great record NO Opeth fan should be without. Although if you just want to get into this band, I'd HIGHLY suggest starting out with Blackwater Park, followed by this record or \\"Still Life.\\" This way you can see the true diversity and brilliance of these incredible musicians.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I enjoyed this film as much as I enjoyed Sorcerer's Stone, only for different reasons. This film has the characters a year older, and a wee bit wiser. Of course, they're still getting into trouble, as most kids 12 years of age do.<br />This film is a bit darker than the first, which is what the author intended. This is a progression that builds through the four books currently on the market. This will build until the seventh book in which (I'm assuming) Harry will finally battle, and defeat Lord Voldemort. This is shown by J.K. Rowling's admission that one of the main characters will die in the fifth book. Something to notice when you watch the film is how little of it takes place during the day. Of the three hour film, only about fifteen minutes takes place outdoors during the day, ten minutes of that being a quidditch match. The rest of the film is at night, or inside a dark castle.<br />I have to say that I'm amazed at the quality of the acting the kids in the film possess. These kids weren't child stars in England when cast for the film. These were kids that were picked because of the way they looked. In fact, Daniel Radclife (Harry) won a contest for being the most 'Harry-like' kid. Some scenes in the film astound me, and make me wonder how many takes it took to get the good shot. One thing I miss is any bloopers that might be floating around somewhere. I'd love to see them!
B00004XONN|5.0|Voted in the top 40 albums ever at the beginning of 2003, Kid A is an amazing album. It is the greatest experimental album of all time surely.<br />The album contains sound effects, keyboards, lyrics that don't seem to make sense and very little in the way of drums and guitars, which is not what you would expect from a band who previous albums (of large success) had mostly the opposite (apart from lyrics).<br />No singles were released, no photos, no big tours, no big interviews, nothing. Yet this is one of the most respected albums known and still was voted top 40 ever.<br />The album is hard to like at first. Most people who never heard it say \\"what the hell is this\\" the first time they do. However, the best songs are always the ones that have to grow on you, and this does exactly that.<br />-\\"Everything In Its Right Place\\" is a very wierd, but fantastic and damn catchy opener.<BR>-\\"kid A\\" follows. This is another wierd and very skillful song where you can only make out of one or two of the lyrics. I found it hard to like this at first but it turned out to be a very nice song.<BR>-\\"National Anthem\\" is one of those which you can like early. It starts out with a grungy guitar tune and ends of with a rioting orchestra. Pretty fascinating.<BR>-\\"How to Disappear Completely\\" is a slow follower. Pretty morbid stuff which sounds like an average track at first, but gets quite addictive.<BR>-\\"Treefingers\\" If you like church organs you'll like this. I don't at all, but I still like it. That's all it is, three minutes of some wierd organs. Its a skip track at first, but fits nicely with this wierd little album.<BR>-\\"Optimistic\\" This is the only normal song in it. One of those that sounds like they were put in the wrong album. However, it reassures you that Radiohead haven't gone insane and can still play their guitars. Its catchy and easy to like.<BR>-\\"In Limbo\\" follows nicely to the previous track but I never got too much into it. After some listening, it sounds better but never great.<BR>-\\"Idioteque\\" is supposed to be one of the best songs they've done according to big Radiohead fans. I'm not one of them and I don't agree. It has a pop / hip hop beat and very powerful singing. It is a good song and, of course, supposedly one of their bests.<BR>-\\"Morning Bell\\" is one I like. It sounds like a little cheap fill in song at first but after listening it is damn good. I like the ending to it where the drumming goes all out of place, as well as the lyrics (whatever they mean).<BR>-\\"Motion Picture Sound Track\\"- Difficult to like but once again grows. I don't like it much still but it finishes the album nicely...actually it doesn't because after 3 mins of silence, there is a minute of a dodgy keyboard sound. A kinda bonus track I guess. Pretty [bad] but it reminds you of how wierd the album is.<br />A great album. Anyone giving it less than 4 stars either needs to listen to it more and loudly. Others may not appreciate it in the way that I do. I like the way they have tried something different unlike some bands that do the same thing over and over again. (Possibly the way Oasis started to drop off).
B00003CXHJ|4.0|This film follows a team of WW-II American submariners who are attempting to capture a German U-Boat and secure it's enigma machine.    As some reviewers have pointed out, this film has some inaccuracies. True, the first of several enigma machines to be captured during the war was capture by the british in 1941. It was also true that the depth charge scenes in the film weren't exactly accurate of a depth charge attack, but necessary to the film's gritty feel. These things make for a good Hollywood film, not really a documentary.    I enjoyed the film overall, but because of the inaccuracies, couldn't give it 5 stars.
B00005YXZH|2.0|Dear Jeff,Forget all the bells and whistles and please get back to what you do best. FLAT OUT ROCK. If I want stoner music I will listen to Pink Floyd or even BECKS new album, which is a far better listen then this snooze..
B00008S2VG|1.0|When 'Ray of Light' emerged - it was a new Madonna.  Then 'Music' came out - another new Madonna.  Now, 'American Life' is released - you might as well listen to Music and make up your own lyrics.  No new Madona here!! This album began to get on my nerves early on and after one full listen, I turned my back on the Material Girl.  What happened?  Were these extra tracks left over from the last CD?  Did the movie 'Swept Away' sweep your creative juices aside?  Has motherhood changed you that much? My advice - save your money.
B00008S2VH|5.0|I have enjoyed Madonna's latest projects very much. Ray of Ligh, Music, etc. But my favorite Madonna album has for many years remained Like a Prayer... until now, that is. With Ray of Light, Madonna seemed to take a new spiritual route, and now, in American Life, she is finally able to put her learning in music and in writing. Her honesty and comfort are at times arresting in this record. More than in Ray of light and Music, AL's acoustic spirit blends seamlessly with the digital and electronic sounds. My second favorite track is Nobody Knows Me, where we hear the Madonna we've all come to love (or hate). The Madonna who really doesn't give a .... about a thing, the Madonna who wants to come closer to her God by means of a spirited dance tune, and if you surrender, she'll take you along for the ride. And next up is my favorite track, Nothing Fails. Here is a love song to her husband, and the love she feels for him really elevates her and her music. Madonna feels moved by this love, and she wants to pray that it stays... and she brought the church choir with her. The sweet irony inherent in hearing a church choir sing that it is \\"not religious\\" is genius. And the last track, Easy Ride, is the perfect way to end the record. Musically it ventures into territory the other tracks don't, with a beautiful orchestral arrangement. But it's all classic Madonna. Madonna at her best. In a recent interview she confessed that she has a lot more to give and share with her public... indeed she does.
B00008S2VG|4.0|When Madonna embraced the minimalist techno stylings of French electronica artist Mirwais Ahmadzai for her 2000 album &quot;Music&quot;, the results were decidely mixed.  Some songs worked well (&quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;) and some became 3-and-a-half minute train wrecks (&quot;Impressive Instant&quot;).  I'm glad to say that with her new album, &quot;American Life&quot;, Madonna and Mirwais have reached a harmonious level of synergy that makes this album distinct and profound.<br />Starting with the opening track, the much-debated title track, Madonna launches her 10th studio album with a collection of highly personal and evocative songs framed around an intentionally thin electronica-and-acoustic guitar arrangement.  The analog blips and beeps are not as jarring as they were on her previous album, and the work well with the vocals, which do not have nearly as many effects on them this time around.  The album has a cohesive tone that rarely veers off too much, occasionally adding elements to distinguish themselves (gospel choirs, Debbie Harry-style raps, etc).<br />As for the songs themselves, many of them are lyrically similar to the soul-searching &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, often regarded to be Madonna's best album.  Madonna talks about the emptiness of fame and celebrity, the need for spiritual guidance, her own mistakes in her quest for materialism, and the power of love.  The melodies are very nice, especially on standouts like &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;, &quot;X-Static Process&quot;, and &quot;Hollywood.&quot;<br />This album is one of Madonna's finest, ranking up with &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; in terms of quality, emotion, and simple replay potential, unlike the half-hearted electronica of &quot;Music&quot; or the intersting-yet-flawed R&amp;B stylings of &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;.  This album will probably not sell massive quantities, but it has the distinction of being a genuine effort by a true artist.  A must for any Madonna fan, casual or otherwise.
B00003CXBK|5.0|If you are looking for Saturday morning cartoons, look somewhere else. If you want a babysitting-video for your 6-yr old or anything \\"childlike\\"- move on...But, if you want a full blown cinematic anime MASTERPIECE that will engage your mind, spirit and body in a potentially life changing experience, then \\"PRINCESS MONONOKE\\" IS FOR YOU!<BR>   Yes, it is a bit long, time-wise. Yes, it is gory and violent. Yes, it does require your full attention to follow and understand.  And yes, \\"P. M.\\" IS a true anime MASTERPIECE worthy of every sliver of effort needed to access its' many levels of entertaining meaning.<BR> Please note: Every second of the film is needed and in the end, you will not want it to end! The graphic violence is never gratuitous or Saturday-morning silly. And, the 'effort' needed to enjoy PRINCESS MONONOKE (Ma-no-NO'-key) is enjoyable effort, the kind of attention that a great book needs to fully appreciate! NOT the effort needed to read Shakespeare or understand FREUD.<BR> Give it chance and Enjoy!
B00008PW3Q|2.0|I COULDNT WAIT TIL IT HIT THE STORES, THEN WHEN I GOT IT AND STARTED LISTENING TO IT, I THOUGHT WHAT IS THIS? MAYBE I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING LIKE &quot;RUMORS&quot;,  OR  MAYBE IM JUST NOT THAT DEEP, BUT I COULDNT BELIEVE WHAT I WAS HEARING. EVERY SONG TO ME WAS BIZAARE. MAYBE CHRISTINE DOESNT APPEAR AS A MEMBER BECAUSE SHE WAS THINKING THE SAME THING. SHE IS LISTED AS A CONTRIBUTOR (SP). TO ME LINDSEY'S SONG WRITING HAS LEFT ME CONFUSED. I GAVE IT TWO STARS BUT WONDERING WHY I EVEN GAVE THEM THAT. MAYBE THE SONGS WILL GROW ON ME, BUT THE FIRST LISTEN WAS A SHOCKER.

B000002MM8|5.0|I was first introduced to Dead Can Dance with this album in a high-end audio store. The dark, etherial, eclectic, and unique style of music on this album is wonderful and well recorded. Being an audiophile truly unique and exciting music to playback on good audio equipment can be hard to find. This album (as well as many other of DCD's albums) delivers in large quantities. Musically I really appreciate Brendan Perry's song lyrics, especially in \\"The Ubiqutous Mr. Lovegrove\\", and the haunting way he executes them. Thus this album is probably my favorite by DCD along with \\"Within the Realm of a Dying Sun\\". I heartily recommend this as a good album to start with if you've never heard DCD before. The sonic magic will transport and amaze you...a fantasy for the ears. If you're an audiophile this should be on your \\"Records to Die for\\" list, great stuff!
B00003CXIP|5.0|Stand by Me is a movie based on Stephen King's short story the Body,but it is not a horror movie.Stand by Me is a drama about 4 friends,one of the boys overhears his brother talking about stealing a car,and a kid getting hit by a train because of it,so the 4 friends go on an adventure to find the body.AT first they want to find the body to get reconition for finding it,but on their adventure and the experiences they go through help them to grow up a bit and think about what's really important.This is a great movie adventure/drama about friendship and life.Stand by Me is a good movie for the whole family,just rated R for some course language.
B00008PW3Q|2.0|Good to have a legend rise back from the underworld. But I would be more careful not to have their voices sound like they sing from there!<br />I am only addressing here the flawed mixing of the performer's voices on this album: they sound really weird: mostly covered by the other instruments and sound effects; plainly put, the voices are hard to hear, they give the impression that something is missing, they are not fully audible in amplitude and depth; it is something very wrong with this recording or the way it comes out of the CD format.<BR> <BR>It is really a pitty not to be able to fully hear their harmonious vocals; they are weak, indistinct and somehow fading through a sort of special effect filter. It almost makes you believe something is wrong with your CD player. This annoying &amp; disturbing effect is less felt for the Steve Nicks' songs, they altered her voice much less.  If I would be Fleetwood Mac, and listen to this CD, I would decide to take it out of the markets, and try to salvage this album with a new mixing or new producer.

B00008PW3Q|5.0|It's been a long time coming. Fleetwood Mac fans have been eagerly anticipating the release of Say You Will, and it has finally arrived. Was it worth the wait?<br />You better believe it. Aside from a couple of new tracks included in 1997's reunion The Dance, Mac fans have been in limbo since 1987's Tango in the Night. It's great to hear these timeless rockers belting it out once again with the sound that made them famous so long ago. <br />Minus keyboardist Christine McVie, Fleetwood Mac has returned to the Buckingham/Nicks basics that brought the band to frenzied heights in the seventies. Stevie Nicks' unmistakable voice is just as haunting now on songs like &quot;Illume,&quot; a 9-11 tribute, and &quot;Thrown Down.&quot; She has replaced much of her mysticism with pure rock on this album, and the results are fabulous. &quot;Running Through the Garden&quot; and &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot; are tracks a Nicks fan won't want to miss.<br />Lindsey Buckingham proves again why he is the king of experimentation, as somewhat eccentric tracks like &quot;Murrow Turning Over in his Grave&quot; and &quot;Come&quot; demonstrate. Buckingham's style can take some getting used to, but his amazing guitar work is nothing to dismiss. Other tracks like &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot; and &quot;What's the World Coming To&quot; are quite radio friendly and quickly addicting.<br />And through it all, Mick Fleetwood and John McVie remain the solid, enthusiastic rhythm section that complements the in-your-face presence of both Buckingham and Nicks. <br />The absense of Christine McVie and her keyboards is apparent from the lack of signature pop love songs; however the title track &quot;Say You Will,&quot; penned by Nicks, has a catchy sound reminiscent of McVie at her best, perhaps in tribute to her.<br />A mistake would be comparing this album to Rumours; twenty-six years later would put these musicians in a different place entirely. It is quite possible Nicks is not singing about Buckingham and vice versa. Then again, it wouldn't hurt if the soap opera did rage on. I don't think the fans would mind a bit.

B00005JLKN|2.0|Rent &quot;Manhunter&quot; instead.  That film has more style and substance than &quot;Red Dragon,&quot; not to mention much better performances.  If you're like me, you'll rent this for curiosity's sake, but after viewing it, will realize that it was merely a vehicle for Anthony Hopkins to exploit his brilliant turn in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; much like he did in &quot;Hannibal.&quot;<br />With the exception of Ralph Fiennes and Harvey Keitel, all of the performances are extremely lazy.  Edward Norton, one of my favorite actors, disappoints when compared to William Peterson from the original film.  Peterson showed depth and true pain and anguish as a character who has to think like the killer in order to catch him; Norton merely puts his hand on his forehead and raises his eyebrows, attempting to display said anguish.  While Fiennes and Keitel are both very good, even they can't give this movie the energy it needs to surpass &quot;Manhunter.&quot;<br />And there are those who might say, &quot;Why does it have to be compared to 'Manhunter?&quot;  To that I can simply answer: if someone chooses to remake a movie, then, for all intents and purposes, they think they can make the film better than the original director.  Brett Ratner vs. Michael Mann?  Please.<br />Truth is, Ratner is to blame for all of the movie's faults.  The lazy performances, the ridiculous twist ending (which is in the book, but is extremely predictable when transferring the story to film), the assanine explanation of why the Tooth Fairy turned out like he is...ugghh.  Brett Ratner remaking a Michael Mann film is like Justin Timberlake covering a Led Zeppelin song -- just plain wrong.<br />I really wanted to like this movie, because the cast is phenomenal (but phenomenally wasted).  I found myself looking for reasons to appreciate and cherish it...but all for naught.  A bad movie is a bad movie, no matter what.  But hey, it did great box office, right?

0452282152|4.0|This book was a gentle, thoughtful look at life through a young girl's eyes. Greit had a special eye and talent. In another day and time, she might have been the master painter. But she was a servant and a girl--- a fate from which she had no escape. Her feelings are sometimes confused, sometimes overwhelming. There is an underlying tension that continues through the entire book. She is believeable as a young girl and the author's language brings old Delft to life. I really enjoyed this book.

B00008S2VG|5.0|I LOVE this CD. Once again Madonna has created a masterpiece of Tech-pop! This time round the sound is a little folky with a lot of guitar over pulsing electro beats and beautifully spare synths. <br />She is fearless with her voice, taking chances with unexpected melodies. This colelction of songs is sometimes retro, sometimes haunting but always wonderful. Stand outs are the beautiful &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;, &quot;Hollywood&quot; and my favorite &quot;Easy Ride&quot; but all the songs are great!<br />Listen for the killer synth lines and heartbreaking strings. This is an instant classic that is sure to be the soundtrack of 2003.
B00008977N|5.0|It was amazing to relive this incredible concert almost 10 years after seeing it live! Thank God it was recorded and released!   Gabriel, as always, brings music and theatrics together to keep the audience in awe!  All I can say is WOW!  My 8 and 11 year old children have become TRUE Gabriel fans after putting a visual to all his music I have subjected them to over the years!  There is no way to sit still while watching this show!  You will be up dancing and singing!  I can't believe anyone would say ANYTHING negative about this concert that so obviously had so much time, effort, and thought put into it!  Gabriel is my hero!
B000005J56|5.0|During a trip to Paris a few years ago, my aunt (knowing I had an affinity for Latin Jazz) took me to see a movie.  I was so perturbed all the way to the cinema, dreading the idea of spending an afternoon in a movie theater while being in arguably the most beautiful and culturally splendid cities in the entire world.  Two hours later my life had changed.  I had discovered something that has since become so integrated into my personal defintions of &quot;music,&quot; &quot;passion,&quot; and &quot;life&quot; that I still wonder how I could have once lived without knowing this music.  That movie was &quot;The Buena Vista Social Club.&quot;<br />The music is the quintessence of &quot;breathtaking.&quot;  The story-telling poetry and conflagrant rhythms will hold your attention from the opening strums of &quot;Chan Chan&quot; all the way through the fading seconds of &quot;La Bayamesa.&quot;  I could not possibly recommend any other album more highly than this one.  If you are a music lover in the purest sense, you have to own this CD.  I also highly suggest renting/buying the documentary to fully appreciate the stories behind the performers and songs.  Their personalities alone will endear you to some of the most talented and passionate yet almost tragically forgotten artists ever.<br />The Buena Vista Social Club literally changed my life...and I have my stubborn old aunt to thank for it.

006097625X|5.0|This book is both an instant classic and very enjoyable. I am was not a reader of comics until I read this book.  It convinced me of comics' status as art.  It is an insightful and intelligent investigation into the comic art form.  Read closely, it reveals itself to be a true work of intellectual rigor.  But you can also skim through it and smile page after page at its humor and visual work.  Like a good comic, it works on many levels.
078322804X|4.0|This movie brings back so many memories of my youth.  It is on my Top 5 all-time favorites.  But, I was a little distressed to see that the DVD does not offer the option of watching the original theatrical release.  Instead they have added the deleated scenes directly into the film, which is distracting for someone who knows this film as I do.  Mind you, I am not complaining about the extra footage, especially the extended jam by John Lee Hooker on Maxwell Street, but the added footage can detract from the overall enjoyment of this classic.  Thus, while the film rates a 5++++, the DVD gets a 4.
0380977788|5.0|I don't know what is, but every author these days seems to think the larger your book is the better it has to be. This trend has gotten especially out of hand in the fantasy department and now even books for younger audiences are starting to conform (Thank you *very* much, J. K. Rowling). What these people seem oblivious to is that no matter how long a novel is, a bore is a bore which is why I find myself increasingly eyeing the young adult shelves for a good, otherworldy read.<br />Thankfully, Neil Gaiman has written for every audience under the sun and knows how to spin a good tale of any length. In a relatively scant amount of pages he manages to conjure up a funny and frightening fairy story for the modern reader.<br />Coraline- most definitely *not* Caroline- is an unflappably English little girl who treats all her bizarre neighbors with a polite smile and a nod and behaves much the same way when she finds herself in a realm of button-eyed parents and crawling hands. But it's not all scares, there's the sarcastic and aloof Cat and a pack of terriers who love stage shows and chocolate in all its forms- except for toffee, which makes them dribble- to keep things from getting too dark. <br />All in all, a fun but all-to-brief story that's bound to amuse all ages.<br />But better too short than double the length and half the heart.
6304288433|4.0|Halloween II picks up where the original film leaves off.  Michael Myers, having just been shot six times and falling two stories out a window, gets up and walks away, much to the surprise of Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence).  Myers' intended victim is Laurie Strode, played by Jamie Lee Curtis.  As it turns out, Laurie is really Michael's sister.  Laurie is taken to the local hospital where she is heavily sedated.  Unfortunately for her and the hospital employees, Michael finds out that Laurie is there and he goes to find her.<br />Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis and the Haddonfield police are doing their best to track down Myers, but they are having no luck.  Finally, Dr. Loomis is told by the Governor to return to the mental hospital where he works, but he becomes aware of some information that has been kept from him about Michael, so he heads back to Haddonfield hospital to find Michael.  Will he make it back before Michael finds Laurie?<br />This is an excellent sequel to the first movie.  It almost looks like the first movie has never ended from the way Halloween II starts.  The acting performances by Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence are very good, and Michael is his old creepy self.  Good old-fashioned horror movie fans will enjoy this very scary sequel.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|A lot of folks may lament the loss of Christine McVie from Fleetwood Mac...Take solace in the fact that she guests on the Bleed to Love Her track and sit back and take in a great album. Stand out tunes like What's the World Coming To?, Illume, Thown Down, Say You Will, Peacekeeper, Steal Your Heart Away, Bleed to Love Her, and Say Goodbye easily make this CD worth buying. <BR>I didn't buy the 2 CD special edition, so I cannot say if that is worth it, but the \\"regular version\\" is more than worth your bucks. Congrats to FM for a great comeback!
0385507755|5.0|When I picked up James Frey's book, A Million Little Pieces - I had no idea I would be hit so hard and feel compelled to stay up all night and finish this amazing story of addiction, love and survival. The intense writing style and raw emotion that spills from the pages of this fantastic work have left me wanting more! James - when is your next novel coming out? I learned a lot from James and know that you will as well. Buy it! You will be spellbound.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I never thought I'd find myself liking t.A.T.u. In fact, you should have seen the look on my mother's face when I bought this CD. She was like \\"You like lesbians?\\" and I said \\"I like their MUSIC, Mum\\".<br />But ignoring the fact about the lesbians, this is actually really really wicked! I love this CD! It's brilliant! Some people may say they scream when they sing, but I think their voices are cool. The best tracks are:<br />3. Show Me Love<br />I love this song! It doesn't go on for ages, in fact there is only two chourses. They will stick in your head and remain there. I love the lyrics, especially the second verse. Great stuff. The phone conversation at the beginning is wicked too.<br />4. 30 Minutes<br />I love and adore this song. The piano at the beginning and in the middle is so amazing! This song is so simple. I love the girls' vocals. Brilliant song.<br />5. How Soon Is Now?<br />Right now, this is my favourite track (but it changes all the time). I just love the rocky music, and the way the vocals are sung. The lyrics are so funny! Even if this is a cover, it's still wicked!<br />6. Clowns (Can You See Me Now?)<br />Another cool song with awesome lyrics and vocals. The lyrics in this song are a bit strange, but ignore that and you have a great song.<br />7. Malchik Gay<br />Not as weird as it sounds, trust me. This song will get stuck permanently in your head, especially the part where they sing \\"Malchik Gay\\" over and over again. This is such a cute song!<br />8. Stars<br />I fell in love with this the first time I heard it. I just LOVE LOVE LOVE the Russian singing parts on this. I have no idea what they're singing but I still love it! I love the music too. Absolutely wicked.<br />9. Ya Shosla S Uma<br />The Russian version of \\"All The Things She Said\\", is in my opinion, better then the English. It's more fun to listen to, and try to sing along in English. The vocals sound funny, at least you have some idea what they're talking about.<br />11. Show Me Love (Extended version)<br />Like track 3, but with an extra minute of choruses and music added on the end. Makes the song even better!<br />On my CD, I have a WICKED remix of \\"30 Minutes\\", that shouldn't have been left off the international CD. I love this remix! The girls' vocals are all warped, and in the background. You have to listen really carefully. It's a whopping 6 minutes long, though.<br />Overall, a BRILLIANT CD that deserves recognition. If t.A.T.u aren't the next big thing, then I'll be completely surprised.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I've been reading some of the other reviews and it seems the majority feel the same. this is a great c.d. and it's really good to hear Lyndsey Buckingham go off into guitar heaven. No it's not rumours but nothing will touch that album. Yes it does sound like two solo albums blended into one. Who cares. The band is called FM. The drummer and bass player bring this band together as always and isn't it a sweet sound. I hope this does well in the charts because it really is classic material from a band that can pull it off.
B00008S2VG|5.0|For years Madonna's been threatening to talk, for real, about her inner feelings and emotions.  And she's scratched the surface, most notably on 1989's Like a Prayer and 1998's Ray of Light.  But it's American Life, produced by Mirwais Ahmadzï of Music, that sets a new autobiographical standard for her.  <br />As it turns out the old gal isn't so self-assured and cocky as she's spent the last twenty years trying to convince us she was.  On \\"X-Static Process,\\" which is very much not a dance track, she goes through numerous neurotic scenarios,  all of which lead her to one conclusion: \\"I'm not myself.\\"  The sentiment is striking in its austere candor: clearly all is not song and dance in the Ritchie home.  The instrumentation is pared down to guitars and harmonies only, and the result is something we've never heard from her before.  <br />This is all well and good, but psychological delving, however cathartic, is a double-edged sword for the mother of pop reinvention.  Unlike \\"Jenny from the Block,\\" Madonna makes no claims to keep it real with her peeps in Michigan.  Instead she implicates us all - Americans at least - with accusations of being vacuous, petty, and empty.  She owns up to it herself, but the fans (and the general public) may very well not want to go there.  Though I personally would call it her boldest artistic statement ever, that surely won't translate into sales.  \\"Everybody's looking for something,\\" she grumbles on the depressive-catchy \\"I'm So Stupid.\\"  It's an introspective record that works quite well as a whole, but not necessarily piecemeal.  In fact, this may well be Madonna's least successful album ever, based on its bleak critique of our times and lack of standout singles.  That's American Life, baby.<br />When Madonna questions \\"this modern life\\" on the title track, it's something she'll keep coming back to until the end.  It seems Madge is trying to figure out the price of twenty-first century Western luxury, and if she can stomach it inthe face of such global uncertainty.  Unlike \\"Substitute For Love\\" however, it's not fame that's getting her down - but the American Condition.<br />Thematically, singers have gone to these dark, self-critical places before, and will again.  Hole's \\"Celebrity Skin\\" is very similar to the supposed second single \\"Hollywood,\\" for instance, but the former packs a much more effective punch.  Madonna's lukewarm critique of Los Angeles unfortunately falls more into the line of Belinda Carlisle-style musings.<br />Mostly though, she avoids the pratfalls of cliché so treacherous in this genre.  Her lyrics seem simple enough, but take on added meaning with 80's style synth-accompaniment.  Think a whole album of Soft Cell's \\"Tainted Love\\" or Depeche Mode's \\"Personal Jesus.\\"  The musical landscapes highlight the isolation and despair of our times; a particular standout in this regard is the first song of an amazing troika, \\"Nobody Knows Me.\\"  On this excellent track, somewhat reminiscent of Janet Jackson circa \\"Control,\\" Madonna complains of a \\"social disease\\" we all suffer from, to a kicking beat that will drive your booty to the dance floor.<br />Following this track is \\"Nothing Fails,\\" a seeming continuation of country/electronica from Music.  The lyrics go deeper, however, and the song progresses into an anthem accompanied by the London Community Gospel Choir.  The result is powerful and resonant, much like Spiritualized and their trademark chorus-in-a-round.  Lyrically, it highlights the emptiness of living in a secular society in times of crisis.  It's also, quite likely, an ode to Mr. Ritchie and the ultimately redeeming power of love.<br />\\"Intervention\\" is a real country track, but old country in a spare, almost twangy way.  The electrical guitar is gorgeous and the message is inspirational.  \\"The road looks lonely, but that's just Satan's game.\\"  These are lyrics I never thought I'd hear Madonna sing, but she's also never sounded so sincere.  <br />And then there's the rap.  Madonna's famous for her spoken-word period (\\"Justify My Love,\\" \\"Erotica\\") but she's never attempted to rap before this album.  Though she certainly owes a great deal to Debbie Harry and Missy Elliot, it mostly works - believe it or not.  This is a concept album, after all, and rap is a dominant sound in contemporary American life.  More so than the first single, the stacatto stuttering on \\"Mother and Father\\" is incredible.  Her \\"I've got to give it up\\" takes us back to the delicious excess and desperation of Madonna Past, like Ray of Light's tragically underrated \\"Skin.\\"  It's lonely, it's self-absorbed, and it's a cry for help to a funky beat.  Juxtaposition, thy name is Madonna.<br />The weakest track on the album, one which feels not entirely fleshed out, is the closing \\"Easy Ride.\\"  It goes \\"round and round just like a circle\\" a little too much for my tastes, without an entirely redemptive climax.  Not the best ending to a pretty terrific album - but that's American Life too.  At times awkward, joyously garish, and still - after twenty years - fascinated by Madonna.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|This album is one of their best, by far. While prior albums (Memorial Beach) didn't exactly fare out so well, this one brings a whole new edge to A-ha's performance. &quot;Minor Earth Major Sky&quot; and &quot;I Wish I Cared&quot; are the hallmarks of the CD, with &quot;Velvet&quot;, &quot;Summer Moved On&quot;, and &quot;The Sun Never Shone That Day&quot; supporting the hallmarks well.<br />While I'm not surprised that A-ha still isn't that big in the US, they still make great music and have this great album (as well as the rest of their prior ones) to show for it. <br />A-ha.us

B000089RVX|5.0|My friend called me one night at 2 in the morning. She insisted that I download &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;, this song by presently unknown (to me) Evanescence. I downloaded, I listened - and I loved. I was hooked on that song, and it became my anthem for the next week or two. So, on my same friends' advice, I bought the CD. I personally am a fan of Linkin Park and many similar artists, and, from what I had heard, Amy Lee's band was one of those similar bands. I enjoyed songs like Haunted, Bring Me To Life, Whisper, and Tourniquet. But the most interesting twists on this CD are 'Hello' and my personal favorite 'My Immortal'. To me personally, the mark of a talented band is when a band can rock out so well in songs like Bring me To Life, but can go COMPLETELY acoustic, with just Amy and the piano. When you can vary your music like that - and make it sound just as good as the rest - you have made it in the music business. I don't foresee Evanescence going anywhere soon. I don't see them being the #1 band for the next ten years, but one of the top constant bands for the next several years.
0385504209|5.0|Attracted by the window display at Borders Michigan Avenue in Chicago ..., I ventured into the store not knowing that I was in for 4 nights of sleeplessness.  For an art aficionado like me (though not particularly crazy about the Mona Lisa or da Vinci), the plot was a sure hook.  The very first page gets you hooked as you embark on a journey much like peeling away layers upon layers of mysteries and clues.  The prose is taut, the dialogue crisp, and the narrative tight, encouraging you to turn page after page.  You've heard it said before, but the writing makes you feel as if you are part of the scene, witnessing, albeit silently and anonymously from some dusty, shadowy corner of the room the characters are in. Sensational stuff.  Though the ending leaves me wanting to write an additional chapter or two to satisfy the urge to see what the da Vinci Code fuss is all about, I am nevertheless looking forward to his next novel.  Bravo!

B00008OLYN|4.0|After six albums of establishing connections between the seemingly contradictory genres of extreme metal, folk, and progressive rock, Opeth have finally decided to devote an entire album to exploring their classic folk/prog influences with &quot;Damnation.&quot;  As such, this isn't a metal album, but Opeth's creativity and top-notch musicianship are still in evidence.  Anyone who's heard &quot;A Fair Judgement&quot; from the band's last album &quot;Deliverance&quot; knows just how good Opeth is at weaving together intricate fabrics of music and vocals to create something captivating.  Haunting atmospheres and painstaking arrangements pervade the eight tracks here, ensuring that any open-minded Opeth fan will be more than satisfied.  Even though they're largely acoustic, and the vocals are all sung cleanly, the songs on &quot;Damnation&quot; contain every bit as much power and emotion as those on any previous Opeth album.  While some songs build to massive crescendos (&quot;In My Time Of Need&quot; is a prominent example), mellowness is still the order of the day.  Mikael Akerfeldt's entrancing singing voice is ideal for inducing hypnotism, and his and Peter Lindgren's guitar interplay is stunning in its eloquence.  Anybody who doubts these guys' ability to pick with the best of them needs to hear this album.  Drummer Martin Lopez is, as always, a monster on the kit; it's the complexity of his work, more than anything else, that keeps &quot;Damnation&quot; from being just another light-rock album.  With most Opeth albums I make an effort to comment on specific songs, but on &quot;Damnation&quot; the beginnings and ends of the tracks seem rather arbitrary.  Each one bleeds into the other, creating an &quot;album&quot; in the truest sense of the word.  This samey feeling is both a blessing and a curse: those expecting the sudden, dramatic shifts of Opeth's previous work will be sorely disappointed, but if you want to settle into one listening mode and stay there &quot;Damnation&quot; is an excellent choice.  I happen to prefer the heavier approach of such albums as &quot;Still Life&quot; and &quot;Deliverance,&quot; but &quot;Damnation&quot; is still more than worth adding to your collection.;Damnation&quot; is an excellent choice.

0385504209|4.0|\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is far removed from the proverbial whodunit, although who dunnit is certainly a central theme in the ensuing confusion and turmoil following the death of the Louvre's world-renowned curator.  It is Robert Langdon who lives the conflict and deals with the confusion of imbedded art codes that are the crux of the plot's conundrum.<br />Robert Langdon, also a renowned expert, is a symbologist who is implicated in the murder as his name plainly appears in a message left by the murder victim for his niece Sophie Neveu, a cryptologist with the French police.  What follows is a whirlwind tour of some of England's and Scotland's famous churches, temples and chapels...all in the name of pursuing and deciphering the clever and encrypted messages left by the deceased.<br />As Robert, and his accomplice Sophie Neveu, both attempt to clear their names as apparent partners in crime, they simultaneously pursue the clues left by Sophie's grandfather, a dignitary in a historically mysterious group, Opus Dei.  To divulge too much is to spoil the whirlwind pursuit that sweeps the reader along.  What can be divulged, however, is that Opus Dei devotees are worshippers of a religion in which the ancient goddess is a central part, in direct conflict with Sons of Sion, also a secret society that is slavishly devoted to the basic tenets of the Catholic Church, with no improvisations.<br />Interesting and provocative art and church history unfold along with the parallel plot precipitated by  \\"The Teacher\\".  That's one of the closely-kept secrets!  Who is The Teacher?  Yes, it's a page turner.  Agreed, it's a cannotputterdowner!
B00003CXQX|3.0|It was an okay movie.  Some funny moments.  But with David Spade and John Goodman in it, I just thought it would have been better.  It is a good kids movie - I guess it was the adult in me that was disappointed.  Usually these movies appeal to both kids and adults.  This one didn't do that.  My kids don't ask to watch it too often either.  Maybe they didn't like it as much as I thought either!?  Rent it.<br /><br />1smileycat :-)
B00008S2VG|5.0|I cannot believe I am the first person to review this cd.  I have been a Madonna fan for around 18 years.  I figured the cd would be good, but not as good as the others.  Boy, was I wrong!<BR>This cd is almost perfect----completely interesting and different from anything else on the market today. What a wonderful blend of electronic effects/dance music and guitar rock. Madonna could've played it safe, released \\"Music 2,\\" and collected a couple number one hits.  But she didn't.  Here are my reviews. I have listened to all (except \\"I'm So Stupid\\") songs twice.<br />Five-Star Songs<br />1.  American Life... this sounds so familiar yet totally different. I'm sure you've heard it on the radio by now. My least favorite part is the rap, but it gives some of the ideas as Madonna songs from the past.  That's the nice thing about a Madonna record.  You get a unique point of view that's not just a jumble of the \\"faddy\\" songwriters.<br />2.Hollywood.  This is an absolutely natural, \\"rollicking\\" song.  Her voice sounds really great, and I hope it is a single because I can imagine a wonderful video. It'd be great if she was in a car in this video looking at signs of people/images/places from her past.  Warren Beatty, Sean Penn, etc.  That'd be killer.<br />3.  Die Another Day.  Even though this song got pretty high on the charts, I'd only heard this once before I bought the album.  Fast-paced, dance song with interesting lyrics.  Madonna always brings a unique wit to her songs.<br />4. Mother and Father.  Personal, yet irresistibly fun and explores notes that I haven't really heard from her before. Awesome music behind it. (blippy notes) This reminds me of Ray of Light a little, as well as the songs about her parents that she's done on previous records.  I like how she's like a writer who has similar themes from cd to cd.<BR>   Great hook on chorus---\\"I've gotta give it up...\\"  in addition to the other hook, \\"There was a time...\\"<br />5.  Easy Ride.  Soft guitar song that is pretty similar to Gone on \\"Music.\\"<br />6.\\"Nothing Fails.\\"  Great hook in the chorus, love song to Guy but not sappy.  Something you'll be singing five days after you hear it.  Should be a single.<br />7.  X-Static Process.  The best way I can describe this is interesting.  You keep trying to listen harder to hear more.<br />Now for the few songs that aren't perfect.<br />1.  The first time I heard \\"I'm So Stupid,\\" I didn't really like it.  However, it'll probably grow on me.<br />2.  Intervention. Doesn't start off great, gets better as you listen.  I can't really hear it in my mind right now.  But sometimes the songs I don't like at first turn out to be great, like Express Yourself, Candy Perfume Girl...<br />3. Nobody Knows Me.  This is musically interesting, but not as compelling as other cuts.<br />I found this review really hard because Madonna is so hard to explain.  Just listen to the songs for yourself!

B00000AOUD|5.0|Album to take to a desert island...forget the bonus stuff. The studio track has never been equaled by any band. This is pure inspiration. Though it's one long track on the CD, the piece is actually many different self-contained songs that segue, all excellent and catchy with astounding arrangements. It would have been nice to put some index marks in (maybe they have or will?)And - the production is first-rate, sparkling clear! Tull's earlier albums tended to sound muddy. It's too bad you can't get the original newspaper cover that used to come with it. It's full of irreverent in-jokes penned by the band. A splendid time is guaranteed for all with Thick As A Brick.
B00008S2VG|4.0|madonna's newest collection \\"american life\\" contains some of the most poignant and honest songs the woman has ever crafted. having said that, the title track is not one of them. that single and her new \\"patty hearst\\" look does not fit this album at all. it's too in-your-face and flashy for the mostly folk infused set.<br />fans of the madonna of old, with brassy anthems and bold statements will find little to admire here, what we have instead is an album of songs that speak very bluntly of love, affection, and ultimately personal discovery, most of which are nestled in beds of acoustic guitars and minimal beats.<br />the glorious \\"nothing fails\\" and the fragile \\"x-static process\\" are highlights to an album that comes so close to touching the madgesty of \\"like a prayer\\" and \\"ray of light\\" it falls just shy due to the bookending lemons \\"die another day\\" and the aforementioned \\"american life\\".<br />a must buy for true fans (obviously) and for those who were impressed by the best of her last 2 albums.<br />...very good. near excellent.
B000000HTL|2.0|Alright, something to do with helium. Maybe Peter Hammill was sniffing it when he sang this stuff. I find he's way over the top, chewing the scenery on every song. He ranks with Richard Harris for over-acting. The songs themselves are pretty boring, not much going on. Would be a total waste if not for Fripp's short guitar solo on one song. I listened to this a few times and sold it on eBay. This is not the great missing piece of the progressive rock puzzle. Too melodramatic. There's not much instrumentally, just hammond organ everywhere, like wallpaper, and some adequate woodwinds. Not much in the way of arrangements either. The songs are too long considering their simplicity. Put in some electric guitar - it's all Hammill's acoustic other than Fripp - and maybe this would do more than make you want to shut your eyes - impossible to sleep though due to Hamill's constant emoting. However, if you are depressed or enjoy being depressed, this may be the album for you.
0441003257|5.0|I was reccomended this by a friend a million years ago and thought it was so very funny then. I re read it this week and I gotta tell you it's still really very fresh. The charachters Aziraphale and Crowley are probably as good as anything in Discworld (which I have a thing for as well)and some of the scenes with them just stick in your head long after you read it. How all tapes left in a car for two week turn into \\"THe Best Of Queen\\" and as the Angel and the Demon who have started to really like the human race decide to prevent Armageddon and betray their respective sides as Crowleys tape player blares out \\"Beelzebub has a devil set aside for me\\". Very funny and well worth the read, I lhope you enjoy it.
B0000027RL|4.0|Pearl Jam definitely peaked early with this, their debut album and a huge Seattle-era recording, alongside classics like Nirvana's Nevermind and Soundgarden's Badmotorfinger. This is easily the finest Pearl Jam effort, with almost none of the political baggage or inconsistencies that marred later albums.<br />Here the band just wanted to rock, in the same fashion as their influences The Who, the Doors, and Led Zeppelin. Mission accomplished. In my opinion Ten hangs together better as an effort than Nevermind, with no appreciable dive in songwriting quality across the album. Vedder shows why he is one of the 90's most distinctive (and yet most imitated) vocalists with THAT growling and majestic vocal, and the Gossard/McCready guitarwork is as tight as a fist.<br />There are many great songs throughout. Once hits the ground running, Alive is an anthem for the ages (with suprisingly dark lyrical content), Black is a beautifully executed and haunting slow burn, and Porch is a great straight-ahead rocker. There are two underappreciated songs here that really seal the deal for me--the midtempo Garden (why wasn't this one a single?) and the closer Release (written with input from every member of the band).<br />However, there is a reason why this one doesn't get the five star score. The album has too much commercial gloss on it. Compared to its peers, Ten sounds a bit processed in its production. With the possible exception of Vs. Pearl Jam has not met the quality of this release since. Recommended, along with the other gems of '91.
B00005JLK1|4.0|This movie starts almost like an episode of Love Boat.  The music is light and nearly romantic as you zoom into the Antonia Graza cruising the high seas with well-dressed crew and passengers.  However, no sooner do you zoom onto the ship with dancing passengers than a really bad thing happens, and there is blood and horrible death.<br />We fast forward 40 years and meet a salvage ship crewed by a variety of nearly stereotypical characters.  After a brief introduction showing how dedicated the crew members are, the salvage ship heads out to sea.  During a storm the salvage ship runs into, literally, the Antonia Graza.  Naturally the crew members see a huge salvage opportunity and the money to be made from that opportunity.  Thus the plot of the movie is reasonably simple:  return the Graza to running condition and take her to port to be able to make a fortune.  Of course, a variety of eerie events occur that let you know that the Graza is not just a derelict ship waiting to be salvaged.<br />As the movie progresses, the wonderfully spooky atmosphere enhances what would otherwise be a run-of-the-mill ghost story.  There are portions of the movie that are terribly predictable, always an annoyance in any movie, but fortunately there are nearly as many unpredictable scenes that overcome the predictable ones.  Perhaps the most interesting part of the movie is the last 15 or 20 minutes, when the fate of the ship and crew 40 years earlier is revealed in great and gory detail.  Furthermore, I was not expecting what happened at the very end of the movie.<br />This movie is not likely to win any awards.  However, the sets, the cinematography and portions of the plot made this movie worthy of a bowl of popcorn and a future re-watch.  There are probably no points in the movie where I jumped or my heart leapt, but I was intrigued by the periodic hints of what happened to the ship 40 years earlier, and during the time from 40 years ago to today.  I recommend this movie for a dark and stormy night with the wind howling and rain pouring.dark and stormy night with the wind howling and rain pouring.

B00008S2VH|4.0|Madonna's newest foray into the pulse-pounding electronica world is a bit of a surprise with the number of ballads present here.  She really delves deeply into what makes Madonna, Madonna, complete with confessions, regrets, hopes, fears and, oh yes, religious ambiguity.  The title track aside, there isn't really a commercial radio-worthy track present, but that doesn't make this set any less appealing.  This is a very different Madonna, and it's quite a breath of fresh air...however one does long for the fun, hook-laden, danceability of &quot;Music.&quot;

Some of the highlights are: &quot;What Up Gangsta&quot;, &quot;In Da Club&quot;, Many Men&quot;, &quot;Patiently Waiting&quot; and &quot;High All The Time&quot;.  Every song is really good, there are no fillers here.  Eminem and Dre found some great talent here.  I HIGHLY recommend that you purchase this cd.  You won't regret it!
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna's 16th album-(10th of ALL new material, excluding soundtracks and compilations), is an acoustic techno set, brilliantly mastered though.<br />We have all heard American Life and Die Another Day many times, I love both tracks, but both tracks have received mixed reviews from the public.<br />American Life picks up where Music left off, she is working with Mirwais again on this album, plus two of her musicians from the Drowned World Tour:  Guitarist Monte Pittman and Musical Director Stuart Price.<br />The result is a great album blended with a bit of the classic Madonna which comes out in Nothing Fails-featuring a choir, reminds you of Like a Prayer for a moment.  It's also displayed in Mother and Father.<br />We still have our tracks to dance to such as Die Another Day, Hollywood, American Life, and the 60's sounding Love Profusion.<br />A great album from M.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna's American Life will not be appreciated now. Judging from a slew of negative reviews in major publications(which have focused more on her age and her gender than the music) we are seeing Madonna backlash #2 (her first being the time surrounding Erotica- a backlash against her \\"unfeminine\\" aggressive sexuality) It seems critics prefer their Madonna happy, voguing, flirty and shiny, not biting, in-your-face and opinionated. Too bad. American culture made Madonna. Now she can talk about it all she wants.<br />American Life is a surprisingly modern folk album. It's about rebirth. Discover it.<br />American Life will grow on you. It's first-listen simplicity is a mask for a jillion layers of meaning waiting to be understood.
B00007L4OM|5.0|My family recommended this movie to me because of my love for foreign films, Japanese culture, and action movies in general. I'm very glad that they did! It has since become one of my all-time favourites.<br /><br />Wasabi tells the story of Hubert, a French government agent-turned-police officer who is still longing for his lost love, a fellow spy named Miko whom he met in Japan many years prior. He suddenly finds himself suspended from work after assaulting several innocent bystanders during an arrest, and it's not long after that when he learns his beloved Miko has died. He flies to Japan to hear out her last will and it's here he discovers he not only has a teenage daughter named Yumi that he never knew about, but in several day's time she's to inherit a hefty sum of money which her mother stole from the Yakuza. Yumi has no idea that Hubert is her father, that her parents were spies, or that the Yakuza are after her, so it's up to Hubert to keep her safe -- all while trying to keep her oblivious to all of it. What could possibly go wrong?
B0000542D2|5.0|I have been warned several times about getting a Hard Days night becuase of the \\"piss poor\\" music and such.  But face it folks...those who are conspiring to buy this are not buying it *just* to hear the music.  The point is to see the fab four in action, to hear their witty humor.  Sure, the special features aren't really worth the dirt on your boot, but the movie itself is wonderful beyond beleif.  For anyone who loves the beatles, I highly reccomend this.  However, if you're getting it for the music....buy the album.
B00004THAY|5.0|This cd is just plain great. There is not just one good song on it, every song is great and addictive. This cd is a must buy!
B00008H2LB|5.0|this cd is incredible. i had never listened to linkin park before, and bought the disc on a whim after i heard and loved the &quot;somewhere i belong&quot; track on the radio. i am into more punk, like sum41, and also a little dave matthews, but this cd quickly rose to my favorite in my whole collection. it's the only thing i play in my car. that one where chester or whoever sings is the best ever. you just kid of fall into the music. and all the lyrics rock!
B000002513|5.0|Just before Born To Run he put this one out. An amazing record all in all, and my favorite of his. I actually prefer it to Born to Run for some reason. Maybe the stories are better worked out and more specific than his next album. They're both great, but this one is the best.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Basicly I wanted to write this review to say a few things about this movie.<br />One: The ending was perfect.  Other submissives would understand the significance of what she did to prove her love to her Dom that could not accept that some one would love him so much.  She did exactly as he told her to, despite others that pleaded with her to stop.  It was beautiful to watch.<br />Also, she was only in the mental ward cause she had an accident.  As a masochist and an old cutter, it was nice to watch the parallel of the two in this movie.  The expression on her face when she was spanked for the first time was priceless.<br />I recomand this movie to any one that is interested in BDSM, or is already in the lifestyle.  It shows the human side of things, not just the kink. ^_^
B00008S2VG|5.0|I have to write to let everyone know how good this new cd from Madonna is.  i have been listening to it for 5 days now and love every single song on it.  Opening up with American Life - its a tounge in cheek rant on the trappings of fame.  This is a new Madonna yet again.  She's not preaching she reflecting on 20 years of being in the spotlight.  And who better to let us know.  Every song has something to offer.  Love profusion and X-stactic Process are love songs to Guy and Intervention is about the bond she has with Rocco.  Nothing Fails is probably the best song you will hear this year - very moving.  She ends the album with Easy Ride and we know she has'nt had one of those.  It's like the closing credits on a brilliant film that you have to stay till the end.  Unlike any other record you will hear this year this could be the album of the summer.  Amazing she's done it again

0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones<br />Alice Sebold<br />A little girl name Susie Salmon (yes like the fish) was a fourteen-year-old girl murdered one night coming home from school in December.  The book is written in an intense fashion from the beginning then it goes in to slow motion.  We are reading about her life as she is looking down from heaven in what would have been her life.  Susie is telling us about what her family is going through as she sees it from her heaven.  The man she was murdered by had killed other girls and she met them is heaven as well.  According to Susie there are many heavens hers happens to be her Jr. High school years.  Being a woman I enjoyed this book but to some it might seem a little boring and out of reach.  I believe Alice Sebold has a great imagination and to be able to write a novel that is sad from the beginning and gets happy is just amazing to me.
038572179X|5.0|This book was a great reading experience. I was amazed,after finishing it, that it was a relatively short book because it seemed to be a work of both depth and width. I loved it and commend the author and thank him. It is a rare reading experience (I am tempted to say &quot;these days&quot;) to have such rich interior and exterior 'worlds' created in a novel.<br />Having just finished the book, I am wondering if Briony is a &quot;bad seed&quot; sort of girl/woman. Well, I will be thinking about this book for a while, but it will be a pleasure.
B00008S2VG|1.0|the Good News is that Madonna has made it 20 Years&is closing in on the Rock&Roll Hall of Fame in a few Short years.hard to Believe Madonna&the Hall together in the same sentence?? who would have thought Madonna would be still going on back then? this is a Big Year for Her on many levels.but in the Modern Era of Music Making like with Her Film Career She is tanking something awful.this Album is another safe by the numbers standard that Madonna has been dropping for the past few years.She has lost Her Street Roots&Needs to find them again.Her Rapping is corny&alot of Her vocals just have no feeling nor does most of the music here.if She keeps on Making Corny Albums like this then She will be done.She got Comfortable&got Soft.bad enough Her Films Stink but when her Music starts to fall off like this Album does then She might wanna go away for a minute&re-group?
B000009QPO|5.0|After hearing &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; on a local college radio station way back in 1993, I determined that I wanted to buy this album.  And if it had been a record or a tape, and not a CD that I got, I would have worn them out from overuse.  This is one of my favorite albums of all time.  While I enjoy all the Jayhawks' albums, &quot;Hollywood Town Hall&quot; is probably their best overall album.  It has an edginess that the other albums lack, which sound a little more grown up and mature, more adult contemporary than rock.  (But I enjoy the other albums as well.)  And I can't stand Neil Young, so don't let the comparisons with him dissuade you.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|As a casual Mac fan, I bought this CD with mixed expectations.  I attended THE DANCE tour which impressed me greatly, and to this day I fondly remember watching Mac videos on MTV in the '80s.   First, I was worried about the group dynamic since longtime member Christine McVie decided to make her retirement from the music business permanent.  Secondly, could the once all-mighty duo of Buckingham-Nicks live up to the overwhelming expectations to create a good album a full 16 years after collaborating on the last Fleetwood Mac album?  Well, my expectations were exceeded upon REPEATED listenings to this disc.  For all of those who have left negative reviews...did you listen to this album at least five times?       First of all, the overwhelming positives:  Lindsey Buckingham has not lost his touch.  The production on this album is second to none, and blows away a lot of what is out there today.  Furthermore, Buckingham and Nicks sound great vocally, and Buckingham's guitar is mesmerizing.  As expected Mick Fleetwood and John McVie are as solid as ever, further solidifying their status as one of the all-time great rhythm sections in music.      The best songs on the album are:    What's the World Coming To: great Buckingham/Nicks harmonies here with that all familiar Fleetwood Mac sound.    Murrow: the best of Buckingham's experimental songs on this CD..yes, experimental, but so what!--give him credit for daring to try at this stage of the game.    Illume (9-11): Edgy and different---didn't care for this at first, but further inspection of the lyrics show they are deep and effective--makes you think you are in the middle of New York City on the night of 9/11, sitting in a dark room wandering what had just happened.    Thrown Down: WOW!  Buckingham's guitar providing that classic Mac 'yearning'/'lonely' sound, the harmonies here are great, and what a melody!  This is classic Mac...reminiscent of \\"Gypsy.\\"  Nicks sounds great here.     Miranda: the second best of Buckingham's experimental songs.  Didn't like at first, but quickly grew on me.  More Buckingham/Nicks harmonies...    Red Rover: quirky, mysterious and dark...Buckingham traits...but a gem    Say You Will: again, classic Mac sound, if a little generic...supposedly written for Christine McVie.    Peacekeeper: awesome harmonies and a strong vocal delivery by Buckingham!  Great lyrics...classic Mac sound.  First single off the album and a good choice.      Smile At You: Intricate arrangement that required a couple listenings, but definitely a keeper...all four members shine...listen for Buckingham and Nicks go back and forth on the chorus...    Steal Your Heart Away: another Buckingham song with classic Mac sound (and featuring Christine McVie on harmonies and piano)    Bleed to Love Her: from THE DANCE, same arrangement but still delivers (featuring Christine McVie on electric piano and harmonies)    Everybody Finds Out:  WOW!  Excellent, rocking delivery by Nicks with Buckingham following her every step of the way...real retro sound to it with excellent production.  Should be a single...    Destiny Rules: another excellent Nicks offering...catchy and solid    Say Goodbye: emotional delivery by Buckingham    Goodbye Baby: emotional delivery by Nicks...    Come, Running Through the Garden, and Silver Girl are the only songs on this record I have not warmed to, and this is after many repeated listens over the course of 2 weeks.  If I were the band, I would have used these songs as B-sides, for when you program the disc to the 13 songs I reviewed, you have a Fleetwood Mac album that is not only a great listen, but that could easily stand up to their previous best works.  Usually bands that reunite after many years off and record a new album fall flat, but that Fleetwood Mac in 2003 can come up with such a fresh sounding production is amazing.  Looking forward to their next offering-hopefully with a little more discretion on the running time and amount of tracks.   Fleetwood Mac---nice work.
B00004LN16|3.0|IF we have a rating system that ranges from five stars (the best) to 1 star (the worst), one AC/DC fan simply cannot rate Stiff Upper Lip five stars, because that would mean that this album is so good as BACK IN BLACK, FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK, POWERAGE, LET THERE BE ROCK, the live IF YOU WANT BLOOD YOU'VE GOT IT.... and this is simply not true!!<br />The album is not a disgrace at all, but is plain for all to hear that Johnson's voice is gone for sure. Even Phil Rudd's drumming is lacking in energy, his best trademark. The filler material is in enormous amount, since there are 12 songs, too much for their actual creativity. Angus solos are just run of the mill.<br />Of course, in this age of manufactured &quot;artists&quot; like Backstreet Boys and Britney Whatever, it's always a comfort to know that a sheer rock and roll band like AC/DC still are capable of releasing solid hard rock albums.<br />But STIFF UPPER LIP is not a 5 stars album at all!
0440213525|4.0|I am no stranger to the writings of John Grisham.  After reading A Time to Kill I really took a liking to his style of writing, but after reading The Client he has become one of my favorite authors.  As a possible future criminal justice student, this book is was right up my alley due to it's setting in a law atmosphere, yet, held the suspense needed to keep my attention throughout the book.  <BR>         At the beginning of the book Romey, a lawyer defending an accused murderer,  is sitting in the woods and commits suicide by shooting himself in the mouth.  As Romey committed suicide he is watched by two young boys Mark Sway and Mark's little brother, Ricky.  Before Romey commits suicide he talks to Mark about how his one client, \\"the Blade\\" was guilty of murdering Senator Boyette.  Romey, also went on to say that the body of the senator was buried under Romey's boat in his garage.  After Romey committed his act, Mark went straight to the police with his information.  All the while, the mafia is aware that Mark knows the story behind the murder and threatens the young boy and his family. Mark gets scared about talking to the FBI and refuses to speak a word.  He is thrown in jail but soon hires a lawyer, Reggie Love.  Mark only trusts Reggie and tries very hard not to tell the feds anything about what he heard in the woods from Romey.  Reggie, although a young lawyer, does a very good job at keeping Mark from having to tell the FBI much about what he heard as well.  Mark decides to go see if the body is really where Romey said.  Mark convinces Reggie to go with him.  They find the body under the boat, however, \\"the Blade\\" and his buddies are there as well.  To find out if Reggie and Mark escape without harm from the Mafia or get killed you will have to read the book. <BR>          The character development in this book was flawless.  One was let into Mark's world and saw why he was such a strong character.   He was not willing to back down to the police.  He was sostrong from his background having an abusive father and motherless home.  One was even told a lot about insignificant characters.  I did not feel that this story was very believable.  I do not think that an eleven year old trailer living boy would be as smart as he was portrayed in this book.  He acted as if he new the law like the back of his hand.  Very unlikely even for a boy of my age to know the law like this young chap did.  However, believable or not the story was still good.  <BR>          The ending was so predictable is was embarrassing to Grisham.  It was no surprise at all what was going to happen to the boy.  From the get go Reggie, although a young lawyer, should have thought of the ending before.  It was pretty elementary.  If the boy was as smart as he was, he should have known what he could do as well.  <BR>          Overall, I thought the book was really good.  It was boring at times and the ending brought the book down some.  However most of the time the pages went by quickly.  I found myself not wanting to put the book down.  I understood the words used in the book about law, however, I do not think that many teenagers would know all the words unless they have had a law class.  Due to this I do not recommend The Client to teenagers.  Rather, this book would appeal to people in there twenties to forties due to its judicial aspects.  I give this book a rating of a 4.0 due to my interest in the law yet not a 5.0 due to the ending and unbelievable aspects.  Yet again Grisham prevails as a great author.
0060005424|5.0|Oh where to start!<BR>I couldn't possibly explain the plot of this marvelous trilogy, for it is amazingly complex. I will say however, that you should definetley start from the beginnning with Sabriel. As a teenage girl myself, I enjoy any books with a strong female protagonist. However, when that girl is just like me, but faces the dead, and kicks some serious butt- I love it that much more!<BR>The trilogy takes place in a world a little like ours, but with a large wall drawn down the center. On the other is a dark place where people can cross into the dead. The Abhorsens are in charge of protecting the people.<BR>For those that have read Sabriel, and our wondering about the sequal Lirael,you will NOT be disappointed. I like it more than the first, as the girl Lirael is a very complex and intelligant character. <BR>These are those rare books you stay up late into the night reading under the covers with a flashlight. Where doing school you find your mind drifting back to what type of Sitch Lirael will get out of next, or laughing at the Disreputable Dog's jokes.<BR>Oh shoot, I promised not to Gush too much.<BR>Well, need I say more?<BR>Buy the book!
B00005JLEU|5.0|This movie is EXCELLENT!  It has great animation and wonderful story line.  The characters and the whole movie just take you to a magical place deep in your heart.  I recommend this movie for everyone.  You will LOVE this movie!  I guarantee it!
0393317552|5.0|After 530 reviews, what else to say except that this book will change forever the way you think about human history. It richly deserves the Pulitzer Prize it received and is, as my review title states, a truly great synthesis of knowledge that is indeed profound in its implications for how we view each other and how we view the process of history itself. Diamond is a masterful writer so you will be entertained as well.
078324228X|5.0|This is a great DVD. It's about love, hope, faith and the things in life that some people call coincidence that are really the things God uses to keep us from seeing the way he uses the suffering of one to eventually reach many. I guess the big man just doesn't want us to see his miracles too easily. <br />Once you see how many lives end up being touched by a book written by a condemned man, you will understand what I mean. Keep in mind that the book would never have happened were it not for the man's misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  <br />As for the acting, the scene in solitary lockup when Hurricane fights with the personification of good and evil and hope and hopelessness in himself is one of the most gripping I have seen in any movie. Very powerful, as is the overall story. There are many other such scenes in this movie.  <br />It's too bad that so many reviewers here do not understand how a documentary styled movie moves along. It requires that you have a bit of an attention-span and willingness to be patient and flow with the story, even if you know the outcome. If you want an action-adventure movie then you should leave this one on the shelf. If you like movies that are truly collectible, and, infinitely watchable, get this one.
0679411585|2.0|It pains me tremendously to have to offer up a negative review \\"We Were Soldiers Once...and Young\\".  Lt. General (then Lt. Colonel) Hal Moore's account of the vicious battle of Ia Drang in 1965 should be a very compelling read, giving great insight to the battle that changed to scope of the Vietnam War.  Unfortunately, Moore's narrative is nothing more than series of repetitive statements and descriptions of the action that took place.  In a few of the negative (or less than enthusiastic) reviews written about this book, it has been cited that this reads more like a battle 'after-action' report than a literary presentation of the events of that day.  I have to agree.  Writing accounts of actual battles is a tricky proposition.  A good writer or editor can make it happen, though.  Neither seemed to have helped with this book.  After approximately 50 pages of relatively interesting background material to set the stage for the battle to follow, \\"We Were Soldiers\\" just dissolves into 300 pages of non-stop battle sequences.  If a proper context is given to the events that are occurring, it can allow the lay person to properly understand and picture what is taking place.  Unfortunately, it seems that Moore is intent on telling the stories of every single soldier who fought in that battle, describing their wounds and their determination to fight on.  There are far too many names to keep track of and their situations are far too similar to give the reader and distinct sense of who these men were.  There is also a very frustrating tendency to jump to different soldiers' points of views without ever giving a proper transition.  One minute, the reader may think they are reading the comments of a private who was shot and survived the battle, but the next minute it will be the company captain who is speaking, and there will have been nothing to indicate the switch in speakers.  <BR><BR>Although Hal Moore's name is listed as the primary author for this book, he really isn't the primary person at fault for the failure of \\"We Were Soldiers Once... and Young\\".  Moore is a military man, not a writer.  His skills lay in his ability to prepare men for battle and then lead them into battle, have them do their job, and get as many out safely as possible.  From all accounts, Moore was superb with this task.  The fault lies more with his editors at the publishing house and his co-author, journalist Joseph Galloway.  By trade, Galloway is a writer and he should be equipped with strong narrative and story-telling skills.  He could have and should have taken the tremendous insights that Moore provided and molded them into a fascinating tale of the men who fought on that day.  There are many non-fiction war books that have managed to accomplish this.  The editors of this book should also have seen that there was no narrative flow to the story and found ways to improve it before they published it.  Alas, they didn't and, as a result, \\"We Were Soldiers...\\" is a chore to read.  <BR><BR>It is clear that I am in the minority in my opinion here.  That is part of why I feel it pains me to give this book a negative review.  However, my final decision came down to a set of deciding factors:  As a person who reads a lot of military history, but has never been in an actual battle or studied military strategy in-depth, could I still follow what has happening in this story with any degree of clarity.  Unfortunately, the answer is 'No'.  Therefore the negative review must stand.
B00006X06U|5.0|Many of Joni's albums have left me wondering if I'd ever heard anthing quite like them (Hissing...,Don Juan, Mingus, even For the Roses at the time)I had the same reaction to Travelogue.  I think it's easy for many listeners to pass this effort off as boring, but if you really relax and get into each piece of music this is really an extraodinary experience.  Some of the songs like &quot;troubled child&quot; have been transformed.  I wish she would do another double album like this.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Don't buy this album expecting to hear dance/pop songs. In fact, \\"American Life\\" and \\"Die Another Day\\" are the most mainstream dance songs here. Most songs are about Madonna's disillusionment with life and fame, while others deal with her family. After the lead single, I was expecting more songs to be in this vein- abrasive lyrics set to aggressive dance music. Instead, after this confrontational opening, Madonna mellows out.<br />The majority of songs are mostly acoustic guitar/rock based-\\"Nothing Fails\\", \\"Intervention\\", \\"Easy Ride\\" \\"Love Profusion\\" and \\"X-Static Process\\"- very personal and introspective songs. Those few that do have some form of dance beat are also quite heavy on the subject matter- \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" and \\"Mother and Father\\".<br />If anything, Madonna and Ahmadzai expand more on songs like \\"Gone\\" , \\"Paradise (Not For Me)\\" and \\"I Deserve It\\" from the album \\"Music\\" than the pure pop dance music songs it contained. In fact, \\"Die Another Day\\", seems somewhat thematically out of place on this CD.<br />If you regard Madonna as a dance artist, then this album may disappoint you. I personally would've like to have seen more new dance sounds explored here, though the slower songs did grow on me. Just not immediately.<br />Madonna looks to have a lot to get off her mind, and does so in a stream-of-consciousness way with songs like \\"I'm So Stupid...\\" and \\"Hollywood\\", mixing elements of dance music and rock and roll together while exploring the shallowness of fame and \\"modern life\\". These songs are somewhat erratic and less structured. This doesn't give the clean, well-crafted form that was prevalent on \\"Ray of Light\\" or even \\"Music\\". <br />Madonna is determined to show that she is not a material(istic) girl, with shallow goals. There are many songs strictly to Madonna's personal point of view, and since these are her views, they are more specific to her life, which may alienate listeners. It's a very personal album, which has become a staple of Madonna's since \\"Ray of Light\\". Though I don't think she has ever tried to be this personal.<br />Madonna sounds uncertain and conflicted throughout most of the album, both musically and lyrically, so it will be interesting to see where she goes from here.
B00007AJGH|3.0|One of the film's most adult moments with Jessica Rabbit has been cut up and out by Eisner's Disney in the battle to make empty uncontroversial familial fluff. It was a shocking scene and made you take the film more seriously... not anymore. I could see them taking it out of the kid's version if they mentioned it, but the Enthusiast's disc being edited? Thanks a lot Disney. Learn not to play with scissors... or history.<br /> I appreciate getting FULL and WIDE screen in one package. They should have given all of the deleted scenes in this, and brought back the original frames and full scenes, like customers expect. It's been like this since the VHS release... <br />Extras should not have been crammed onto one disc. <br />Anyway, beyond that, this is a Great DVD with fine extras. You may want to wait for a better edition with all deleted scenes...
B00001MXXH|5.0|Ferris Bueller's Day Off should be manditory viewing for any high schooler. It is the authoritive refrence that, even here in 2003, perfectly captures the essence of high school life. I've talked to people who condemn this movie for promoting dishonesty, ditching, laziness, etc... etc... I wholeheartedly disagree. This movie helps drive home the need to appreciate the good things in life. Best friends, family, a beautiful day, the community where you live... These things are all precious and never should they be taken for granted.<BR>Buy this movie, and watch it whenever you find yourself taking your life to seriously. Admit it, from time to time we all identify with Cameron. Take a stand! Buy this movie!<BR><BR> \\"The last thing I need is 1,500 Ferris Bueller disciples running around these halls.\\"- Ed Rooney
6304873441|2.0|Most people think of Anastasia as the princess in the Twentieth Century Fox movie, Anastasia, but this movie is very misleading. The dates are all wrong, the bloody revolution is \\"glossed over\\" and Rasputin is \\"evil incarnate.\\" If children want to learn more about Anastasia then it would be better to give them Hugh Brewster's book Anastasia's Album, and let them read about her. Only a few references are made to real life facts such as Anastasia was born at Peterhof, and the drawing \\"little Anastasia\\" makes for Marie, her grandmother, is identical to the one \\"the real Anastasia\\" drew for her father in 1914. I do admit that the music was nice. And the film was a wonderful fairy tale.
B000002J09|4.0|IV is certainly not the best Zep album in my opinion, although it is certainly conisidered that by many people. In any case, this is Led Zeppelin, and whats more to say? I am sure you have at least heard of the song &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, which is one of their catchiest and best songs ever in my opinion. I did not find the rest of the album as enjoyable as their previous work, but there is still no denying the great feeling I still get when I listen to Zep. Listening to them just makes you ask the question: &quot;what the hell has happened to rock these days?&quot; If you have somehow not heard Led Zeppelin before, well now is a good time to start. An obvious big thumbs up.<br />Best tracks: &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, &quot;Black Dog&quot;, and &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;.
B00008S2VG|3.0|Apart from the corny rapping in the two singles and the gospel outburst in another song...this is actually not a bad album. It was released yesterday (21st of April) in Australia so i've been listening to it for 2 days now.<BR> It's not her best and nowhere near as good as 'music' but if you like Madonna, generally you will like this album. It's one of those records where you first play it and think twice why you bought it...but slowly it does grow on you. <BR>BEST SONGS ARE: Hollywood, X-satic process and Love Profusion. WORST SONGS ARE: American life (basically that song is just [**] compared to the other ones)
B00005QGAV|5.0|Firstly I'd like to thank the media for creating such unnecessary fuss about Michael Jackson's personal life over the past few months. If they hadn't, I'd never have got into Michael Jackson's music as much as I have done recently; I basically had no interest in him for years. A few months back I happened to pick up a copy \\"Dangerous\\" which I borrowed from my dad. Well, if I wasn't just blown away by the excellence of this record! The album \\"Dangerous\\" was the follow up to the immensely successful \\"Bad\\" from 1987. Dangerous was released in November 1991 and sold 27 million copies worldwide - 10 million copies of which were sold in its first four weeks of worldwide release. Nine songs were released as singles in the UK from this album, leaving a minority of five songs left unreleased.<br /><br />Dangerous opens with the rather disappointing \\"Jam.\\" The fifth song to be released as a single from the album, it peaked at No.13 in the UK in September 1992. The song is good, but fails to live up to the rest of this amazing album. \\"Why You Wanna Trip On Me\\" has an amazing guitar intro, followed by a different guitar beat that's very similar to that of Justin Timberlake's \\"Like I Love You.\\" Coincidence? Hardly. The chorus with the exact words as in the title of the song is amazing. \\"In The Closet\\" has to be one of the absolute best songs on the entire album. Michael has never been this [] explicit before, but it works rather well with the female vocals of the 'Mystery Girl'. The video was banned in some countries, and features Naomi Campbell while the song peaked at No.8 in the UK upon its May 1992 release. The song runs for more than six minutes, but this is only a good thing because of the amazing beat that we are treated to. While not the most upbeat and lively song on the album, it definitely is a highlight because of its pure funk nature. \\"She Drives Me Wild\\" is a fairly good song, with a great funky beat and a cool rap. A great song, but the car horn beeping away at the beginning is dreadful!<br /><br />\\"Remember The Time\\" is just an all-time classic. By far the best released song from this album, it charted at No.3 in the UK in February 1992. The lyrics are brilliant, the beat is so funkadelic and the video was truly eye-popping. Michael's world-famous \\"Woo!\\" also crops up a few times towards the end of the song. Just brilliant. Things can't possibly get better after that, and they don't. \\"Can't Let Her Get Away\\" shows strong promise, but falls flat on its face with far too many beats all clustered together, and the extreme repetition of the lyrics \\"I can't let, I can't let her get away.\\" Take a look at the lyrics on the inlay and you'll know what I mean - the same line fills half the page. Luckily, things pick up with the amazing \\"Heal The World.\\" Released as the sixth single from the album, this touching and heart-felt ballad peaked at No.2 in the UK in December 1992. In my opinion, Michael has never been very successful in promoting all this world peace stuff. In this case, however, Michael is very convincing because the message is not one that involves a mass audience, but the song speaks to you as an individual - each and every listener. \\"Black And White\\" was the biggest and most successful single from this album, peaking at No.1 in both the UK and US upon its November 1991 release. The lyrics are great and the rap is excellent, while the video is particularly memorable because of its comedy.<br /><br />\\"Who Is It\\" and \\"Give Into Me\\" are another two brilliant songs, perfectly executed with killer beats and funky basslines. The former is about Michael's lover who has run off with another, while his voice is filled with the raw emotion necessary to make this song excellent. The latter has the same emotion in Michael's vocals, and a superb rocky chorus. \\"Will You Be There\\" runs for almost eight minutes, which is a bit too long for this exceptional ballad. The first two minutes are taken up by pointless, but effective, choir vocals that really do sound epic and heavenly. The song featured in 1993's smash-hit blockbuster 'Free Willy' and was brilliant even before the film claimed it. \\"Keep The Faith\\" is another excellent song about self-power and really does make an impact on the overall face-value of the album. \\"Gone Too Soon\\" is perhaps one of the worst songs on the album. The term 'worst' when reviewing this album can only be used lightly, as no song is [bad] - all are consistently good, but there is obviously a line which separates the great ones from the stunning ones. The album finishes with the title-track, \\"Dangerous.\\" At almost seven minutes long, the song is the perfect finish to a near-flawless record with incredibly descriptive lyrics which are displayed on the inlay and shaped like the hourglass figure of this 'dangerous' lady.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />Dangerous is by far one of the most essential albums of the 1990's. The entire album is almost 80 minutes long, so you definitely get your money's worth, with each song usually running into the six/seven minute time bracket. I'd definitely put this stunning piece of work in my top 10 albums of all time, because every song is great and there's nothing like Michael Jackson's music to get you moving and grooving on the dancefloor. Also, the record still sounds brand new despite being released more than ten years ago. Buy this now - you'll feel like a fool if you decide not to and pick it up years later...und epic and heavenly.

B00000DCHD|4.0|Not much to say but this is one of the better efforts from a MUSICAL GENIUS. One has only to look at the playlist on this CD to understand the impact this CD played on music during the last two decades.
B00000INEX|5.0|My six month old just adores this tape and sometimes I even catch my 3 year old watching it too. The music is very relaxing so we also enjoy the CD that came with it. Baby Bach would calm any crying infant. My daughter just loves it so much. I would recommend this to any parent for a break. I listen to it over and over and never get sick of it myself.

You would have to have a warped sense of humor to<BR>find these books the least bit entertaining.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Woah...I just got the cd and listened to it twice in a row.  If your an opeth fan this abulm is a total mindtrip.  No heavy growls or crunchy gutairs that you would expect from a death/black metal band can be found. Now I was unsure at first if I was going to like an Opeth album that was totally &quot;soft&quot; but it blew me away.  Opeth fan knows that some of their best songs are fairly &quot;soft&quot; but this abulm totally indulges itself with acustic dark melodies and modern &quot;trippy&quot; stylings.  The vocals despite the lack of growling are some of the best Opeth vocals to date. The vocals are chilling yet soothing at the same time.  I bought this abulm not knowing what to expect and found myself completly blinded by it's brilliance!  Opeth actually changed their typical sound and didn't sell out.  A must for anybody not just opeth fans.  This could be the best ablum of 2003 in any genre.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This album has something for everyone. A lot of emotion and creative energy. BUY THIS ALBUM!
0140433627|4.0|Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus is actually great novel with intense themes that apply to the 1800s as well as today! A 4/5 rating is a little low, and I wish that I could give it a 4.5/5 because it is so good. But, it has a few weaknesses so I couldn't give it five stars. The novel is a whole lot more emotional and meaningful than the 1931 movie. They are so different in their story's events and in their message that it is surprising that they even share the same name!<br />Although I don't agree with everything Mary Shelley is implying in her writing, such as the idea of a planned destiny, some of the novel's main messages are actually quite true and apparent to the modern world. The novel shows how taking someting, such as science or the desire to become famous, taken to the extreme actually destroys rather than builds. This applies to the confict between science and ethics in the case of genetic engineering and cloning of modern day. Also, the novel shows how others' heartless and presumptuous actions can totally ruin a person and can bring out the evil from within that person. Even though the book isn't very long, with all these powerful themes, it is not exactly an easy read.<br />The story is great, and Mary Shelley related events very well. I have to admit, some parts were predictable, but other parts of the book were suspensful and exciting to read. The story starts with an arctic explorer who finds and saves a man he found almost frozen to death. This man, in order try to teach the explorer a lesson about the the downsides of fame, tells his story about his scientific discovery dealing with life and death and his terrible destruction. This story is not action-packed, terrifying, nor that believable (it really doesn't need to be) but it is emotional, tragic, dark, and moving, and Mary Shelley's writing style creates this mood well.<br />The language that Mary Shelley uses is exquisite, but sometimes challenging because it is old-fashioned. I would recommed that you get an edition, such as the Penguin Classics, that has end-notes so you can have a greater understanding of Mary Shelley's writing. Also, there are certain parts of the book that move at a slow pace. Getting through the slow parts is well worth it, however, because it is such a powerful and fascinating book.recommed that you get an edition, such as the Penguin Classics, that has end-notes so you can have a greater understanding of Mary Shelley's writing.

0140143505|5.0|I waited too long to finally read 84, Charing Cross Road by Helene Hanff and I have no reasonable excuse for it.  Someone had lent me a copy and it was the only book in my backpack on the commute to work one morning as I had forgotten to bring the book I was reading, so I started it and had one of the best journeys of my life.  I immediately ran out and bought my own copy as I knew that I would read this book over and over again.  It is very funny and, in the end, quite touching in ways that all readers will understand and appreciate.  The best endorsement of this book is that it will get one to investigate all sorts of old classics and look at reading and writing in new and different ways.  I personally will be letting used books fall open just to see what interested a reader from the past and what he or she is trying to tell me.  I little trick gratefully picked up from the delightful Helene Hanff.
B000002JKA|5.0|After digesting all of Dream Theater's full-length releases, I have found that Awake is the album that ends up in my stereo more often than any of the others, even despite the fact that I consciously consider their newest album to be their best, I end up listening to this one more.  <br />This is the heaviest Dream Theater album, overall.  It doesn't have all the mood-swings that FII has, but it is quite brooding in places.  The musical focus displayed on this album wouldn't be repeated until their 1999 offering, SFAM.  There are four &quot;sections&quot; to this album: the first 3 tracks, then the tracks 4-6 which are &quot;A Mind Beside Itself,&quot; then 7 and 8, and then the final three tracks.  You will notice similar lyrical moods and musical ideas unifying each of the four sections.  Mike Portnoy stated in an interview during the 1994 European tour that Awake is a &quot;concept album of sorts.&quot; <br />They are distancing themselves from their 80s'-reminiscent style with Awake.  Seven-string guitars are first used here (The Mirror and Lie) to great effect.  Kevin Moore shines on this album; his last with the band.  The only weakness this album has is the wildly overused movie samples which appear in many of the songs and often multiple times in one song.  The production is top notch; though you will have to concentrate to hear the bass in some places.  This is, all in all, probably the quintessential Dream Theater release - own this one if nothing else.

B00008OLYN|5.0|As I write this, I am listening to \\"Windowpane,\\" the dream-like opener to this work of art.  It's Opeth man, what else can I say?  If you're reading this review it means you're a fan and should've already bought the album.  This is by far Opeth's most experimental album to date, gone are the demonic drumming and crushing guitars and growling death metal vox, instead all of the focus is put on the melody and mellow parts of the music.  Remember songs like \\"Benighted\\" and \\"To Bid you Farewell?\\"  This whole album contains songs within that style, and an instrumental track that's great too.  (\\"Ending Credits.\\")  Steven Wilson continues to produce Opeth, giving the music a super-glossy production - it sounds like they recorded it in Carnegie Hall.  Definately shows you how far they've gone since the raw sounds of Orchid and Morningrise.  <br />Since there isn't insane amounts of heavy metal distortion going on anymore, the emphasis is put on Mikael's godly singing and Mendez's thick bass.  This entire album is a soundscape, something that sounds like it couldn't be done within our reality.  It creates its own world, just like all the other brilliant albums done by this band.  It doesn't hit you as hard as its predecessor, rather, it slowly grows on your soul like Morningrise did.  The first listen, you'll enjoy it and appreciate the fantastic melodies.  The second time you'll find your favorite songs.  The third time you'll be hooked.<br />People who like Opeth mostly for the death-metal style onslaughts will be dissappointed, but surely will find something to like here.  The guitar work is still amazing, though there's much less solos on here than any other album.  Keep your mind open, for Opeth isn't all about being insanely brutal.  (Though heavyness is a great thing!)  Basically if you've enjoyed the acoustic ballads on any of their previous albums, you'll love this.  Also, the songs are all around four minutes long, minus the opening song.  In fact the album's totalclocking time is 44 minutes.  Definately a trimmed down time for Opeth, usually barely squeezing the last drop of their music on the CD. <br />So basically, this is another masterpiece from the metal gods, and will stretch all of our expectations on how amazing metal can be.   Buy it.  Now.
B00004W52U|5.0|To illustrate how much I love this cd, I decided to write a little cheesy poem. Here it is:<br />\\"this 27 song album really grabbed me,<BR>the album and band is called Operation Ivy.<BR>They really weren't much, just 4 guys who skipped college,<BR>and of this album my favs. are 'sound system' and 'knowlege'.<BR>There still are some other great ones also,<BR>like Jaded, Take Warning, and room w/o a window.<BR>This album maybe hard to find,<BR>but when you get it is really one of it's kind!<BR>So buy this album, just to chance it,<BR>because this band also features Matt and Tim from Rancid!\\"<br />Hope that helps. If not, take others' advice and buy this. You won't regret it.

B00008S2VG|2.0|Two words sum this CD up...NOTHING SPECIAL.  Obviously she will never top &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; or even &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; for that matter.  MUSIC was fun...this is just boring now...can you say &quot;been there, done that&quot; Madge.  There will be no grammy nominations for this one, that's a given!
B00008H2LE|5.0|I like Hybrid Theory, and I liked Reanimation, though Hybrid Theory's repetitiveness got annoying after a few months.<br />When I heard Somewhere I Belong, I was hooked instantly. I knew this album would at least be solid.<br />When I got it, I at first hated the damn thing. I thought each song was repetitive and boring. I almost took it back. But upon closer examination(as well as listening to the whole album several times), I realized I had no idea what I was talking about.<br />Don't Stay starts the album off nicely, with a nice BPM and Chester's musical range shines.<br />Somewhere I Belong highlights every strength of the band; Shinoda's vocal tone, the drummer's practice habits, everything comes into place. The track truly is the album's anthem.<br />The rest of the track mirrors Hybrid Theory in its theme progression. that is, the idea behind the lyrics tends to mirror how Hybrid Theory's developed. The last song is very cinematic, Linkin Park style. All the songs are quite good, though track 6 wasn't the most creative ever.<br />The tempo in Breaking The habit hooked me; its faster pace sets it apart from traditional Linkin Park, and is welcome<br />Nobody's Listening is one of my favorites; the flute really adds to the ambience of the song, creating an eerie premise for Shinoda's rhymed...Linkin Park's dreaier look at life is taken from a young perspective, and to a band with great strengths.<br />I sometimes questioned whether or not Linkin Park had the creative power to produce a new album. Happily, they do, and do it well.<br />The DVD is a great view. If Linkin Park wants a quick single release to buy time, The Wizard Song is a great choice, long as Chester finishes it.<br />If your a fan, buy it. If your not, I question how much the album may sway you.
B000001FYL|4.0|Note there is an actual Young Guns II soundtrack album that isn't Blaze of Glory.  Only two Jon Bon Jovi songs from this ablum actually appear in the movie, Billy Get Your Guns (in the closing credits) and Blaze of Glory.  If the great orchestral music score songs from the film are what you're really after then get Young Guns II original soundtrack by Alan Silvestri found [[ASIN:B005PXHWZ8 here]] on Amazon.  For a decent price though, it's pretty hard to find, Silvestri also wrote the music score main theme for Back to the Future, Forrest Gump and many other successful films so you may have to settle for a compilation album.<br /><br />This album is Jon Bon Jovi's first attempt at a solo album away from the greatest band in the word Bon Jovi.  There are some brilliant songs on this album none bigger than Blaze of Glory which nicely ends the film and takes the viewer into the credits of the Young Guns II movie.<br /><br />Miracle is another great song along with Guano City, Never Say Die and Dyin' Ain't Much of a Livin'.  Billy Get Your Guns is a bit tacky but a very simple repetitious song.  You don't need to press skip it is all right.<br /><br />Obviously most songs on here are inspired by the Movie Young Guns II and a lot are about Billy the Kid or Pat Garret so if this is not your preferred genre then this might not be for you.<br /><br />You also get to hear sound bytes from the movie by Keifer Sutherland and Emilio Estevez at the start of Billy Get Your Guns and Blaze of Glory which is pretty cool.
B000002UB3|1.0|I heard the Beatles album &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, the one with their one hit &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;.  That song was good and the other filler songs were...eh...(flipping my hand around like to say &quot;ehhhh&quot;, you know?)...I always saw these guys as a one hit wonder.  But someone said, &quot;You gotta hear 'Abbey Road' by them.&quot;  And, I was like.  Okay. Apparently this band was an influence for great bands like Herman's Hermits and New Order and stuff, so, I thought, okay...if I can find it, i'&quot;ll chekc it out.  I found it.  Checked it out.  Uh...Ever heard of a word called &quot;Porduction&quot;, lads?  They...I don't know when one song ends and the other stops.  They have different lead singers for every song.  The songs have no thru line or melody to speak of.  I see here that some people gave this thing 5 stars.  Hello!  What?  There's a reason you never hear of these guys any more.  They're probably all living in a shack trying to live on their little checks for &quot;Norwegian&quot; Wood.
B000066NW0|5.0|Hi, I just thought I would put in a good word for Avril since she is one of the best singers I know.  I have listened to this CD for the past year and still haven't gotten sick of it.  All the songs are good, each one a little different than the last.  I of course have my favorites, although there are none that I dislike.  I just went to her concert last night and she was great live as well.  She played the guitar in many of her songs, interacted with the crowd, and just put on a great concert.  She is a great artist and I highly recommend that you support her music by buying this CD since its just awesome!
B00006JJ1O|2.0|Come on, lesbians in a video. Really. Little kids too. They were 12 when they shot it. It's one thing to use sexuality in your music to express yourself. But having them making out in the rain is utterly disgusting.<br />But, on the MUSIC. They need to learn English. Again. They should come back when they've matured their creativity, image, and style. They sound pretty good in their russian tracks, but man, do they have to be the ultimate high-production-no substance-group to sell? Yes and No<br />Yes, cause they haven't developed as musicians, and need to find a better company to deal with.<br />No, cause they have potential, but must find it themselves. They shouldn't have to make out in a rain-storm to get publicity. The album leaves a bad taste in the listeners mouth, and they need to wipe it away. After they become true musicians, that is.<br />I don't blame the duo. They aren't true musicians, and shouldn't be judged as musicians.<br />But for Heaven's sake, what a [strange] producer!
B00000I07P|5.0|This is one of the classic Bon Jovi albums with every song at least good if not brilliant.<br />You may recognise the first song form the start of the movie Spaceballs that is blaring out of the stereo in the spaceship.  Let it Rock is it's name.  Of course the next two songs need no introduction due to their legendary status being two of the biggest songs ever You Give Love A bad Name and of course Livin' On a Prayer about Tommy working down on the docks who is down on his luck.  Social Disease is about how love is a social disease.  You will have heard the guitar intro to Wanted Dead or Alive by anyone who has ever picked up a guitar.  Raise Your Hands is an excellent rock song obviously designed to be played live. Without Love is another rock song.  I'd Die For You would be the slowest song on the album but still rocks. I'd die for you is fairly self explanatory.  Never Say Goodbye is about two people in love and Wild in The Street is just an awesome street party song.<br />Like New Jersey every one of these songs is a rock song with fast paced rock that easily transfers to a live concert performance.
B00005J9LY|4.0|I picked up Pet Shop Boys 'Please' with a simple great listen 'West End girls' and lo, I ended up with more fav choice like Subarbia, Tonight is forever, Luv comes quickly and more! Luv comes quickly gives a feeling of the ahs in background brimming emotions. Uptown Girl is a great number I like but Please is just a pleasing experience and great work of the Pet shop boys duo. If you luv the piano and drum beats, opportunities is a cool break into smooth flow of your heart:-) I wanna lover rides you to dream world - good pick 'Please' and West End Girls - Wow, a great evergreen number - Great to Listen @ all times!
B000089RVX|1.0|As a long time fan of Lacuna Coil I heard that these guys have alot in common. Listened to the CD and realized this...the only thing they have in common is a lead singer with a  great voice....that's it. And at that Cristina of Lacuna Coil's voice is much more dynamic anyway. I went into this album thinking if it sounded a 10th as good as the Coil it would be a great album....it just couldnt even achieve that, it doesnt help that I really dislike Linkin Park and the guitars might as well be being played by them cuz I don't hear a difference.<br />Overall, bad, boring, disappointing...if you want a good band that does the same thing, but has a little thing called talent outside of the singer...Lacuna Coil is the band you must check out. MTV shouldn't tell you what's good and what's not.
B00005JLH3|5.0|A great dvd with some great extras.The 5.1 soundtrack gives you that enveloping mood as if you were part of the show.The widescreen presentation gives you just the best picture you can get and is especialy helpful in this movie to show you the bands in all their colorfull glory. But the real deal is the movie itself.Drumline is a fantastic movie especialy for music lovers.The music bands are just amazing with perfect rythms , great costumes and some sexy cheerleaders.And,there are some great actors to complete this amazing show.<br />This film makes me want to buy some drums and join the band.
B00000I07R|5.0|Remember the days when Bon Jovi released good albums well this is one of them.<br /><br />Obviously the big songs Sleep When I'm Dead, Keep the Faith, In These Arms and Bed of Roses are on here but you have no doubt heard them so I won't talk about them.<br /><br />I Believe is all right. It's not a classic but listenable to. If I was Your Mother is about a guy wondering if he was this girl that he likes mother would he love her. Pretty weird idea for song but okay. Dry County is a sad but good song about a farmer struggling to survive drought and singing about his family and wine. Women in Love is a song saying there ain't nothing like a woman in love. Fear is about living, taking risks and not just surviving a really good song. I want You is pretty self explanatory. Blame it On the Love of Rock & Roll is a guy's story of why he is in a rock band and the people who tried to persuade him not to want to be a Rolling Stone. Little Bit of Soul isn't a great song. Save a Prayer likewise but the final song (not available on some album versions so check first) Starting All Over Again is pretty good and is about what it says starting life over again.<br /><br />This album isn't as good or in the same league as Bon Jovi's two previous albums New Jersey and Slippery When Wet but has enough good songs to make it a must buy.
B000002J03|5.0|This album is one of the better albums that i have had the pleasure of listening to in a long time. Now some people might discredit my opinion because of the fact that i am only 17 years of age but that doesn't bother me. The fact the some of the songs on this album might be &quot;stolen&quot; from artists before them doesn't bother me either. If the songs were &quot;stolen&quot; from someone i would like to see proper respect given to the original artist but that is the business of the members of Led Zeppelin and their management team. Overall a very good album. A definite buy for someone looking to have a complete collection of classic rock albums.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is a recent adition to my dvd collection and one that I am very pleased to have recieved. If the beautiful animation and amazing detail doesn't blow you away the story will.Miyazaki's careful attention to expressions, gestures and everyday activites evolves these characters from simple two dimensional drawings to real people. This movie made an impression on me where so many before it had failed. A must see for everyone, whether they be adult or child.
B00005J73X|4.0|This is the only official live album ever made by the best live album in the world although live songs have appeared on most singles. It is pretty good and pretty much contains the same songs as Crossroad their greatest hits album did.  The good thing about this album is they didn't feel a need to put any of the These Days or Crush songs here except the good ones they actually released as singles.<br />Unlike a lot of live albums Bon Jovi have given samples from different concerts all over the world.  My only criticism is that a lot of cities missed out when most which appear have a few songs to their name.  Surely we could have heard from other Australian crowds such as Sydney, Perth etc, Other European and North American cities as well as anywhere else they've played.  Surely they've played in Eastern Europe for example.<br />I also didn't like how they included the exact same version of I Don't Like Mondays which appears on the bonus disc with the These Days album release in 1995 which is the only reason I bought the These Days Album.  Surely they could have included something the true fans don't already have.<br />The live songs are pretty good although again I would say not the greatest live versions I've heard of the songs represented.  I own better live versions of the same songs which appear on singles and other bonus discs.  If they're going for something different from previous releases then again why is the same version of I Don't like Mondays on here.<br />I would also have liked to see One Wild Night Live rather than just a repeat of the single version.  It seems this album isn't really made for the fans who already have a lot of what appears.<br />Bon Jovi are by far the greatest live band in the world so they should have done a lot better job.  If you've never been to a Bon Jovi concert then this album is a must.

B00008RH3L|5.0|Aside from The Godfather and the Star Wars and Indiana Jones films, this, for me, was one of very few films I _had_ to own on DVD (I was thrilled when I received The Hustler and am still awaiting a single-sided, dual-layer version of Goodfellas). For me, this is a top-25 film of all time. An excellent movie on a variety of levels; the dialogue is sharp and powerful, at other times playful and humorous; the photography is at times grand and at others memorable; the plot will require you to think -- a mark of a good movie; the story is told so well, so carefully, and the characters are so vivid and well-crafted, that this will be a film you'll want to revisit, like a fine novel or a fine wine, over the years. It's a shame it's taken this long to arrive on DVD, but if you have already seen it you know it's worth the wait, and if you haven't yet seen it, then order it, experience it and you'll understand.
6300215717|5.0|You hear about Audry Hepburn and her classic charm, sophistication, and beauty but her true gift is in those captivating expressions she puts forth with her beautiful eyes. She and the handsome Gregory Peck have beautiful chemistry on-screen and this is a truly engaging, sweet, and endearing love story that anyone would enjoy. It's a well-written and superbly directed picture with two actors perfectly cast in thier roles. I highly recommend this film.
B000001EC1|5.0|Crossroad is a really good album and was made at the right time when Bon Jovi were music gods before Bon Jovi's albums became average ....<br />Most of their big song's from the first five albums are on this album with a tea cup on the sticker.  Their biggest song in Australia anyway Always a ballad about a guy's love for a girl who loves someone else makes it's debut here.  This album is worth buying for that song alone.  Someday I'll be Saturday Night is also fairly popular at concerts and likewise makes it debut here.  This album also had Jon Bon Jovi's biggest solo single Blaze of Glory but without the Keifer Sutherland and Emilio Estevez intro that appear on the Blaze of glory album.<br />A lot of big songs are here although some are missing such as I'll Sleep When I'm Dead, Wild in the Streets and Blood and Blood.  If you're not really a Bon Jovi fan then this is definitely the album to buy as it is full of great songs.<br />Depending on if you like Always and Someday I'll be Saturday Night would be your decision if you have or are considering buying New Jersey, Keep the Faith and Slippery When Wet all of which are sensational albums.  There's hardly any songs here from their first two albums self titled and 7800Fahrenheit.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I am gratified to see that Spirited Away is finally getting the attention in this country that it has long deserved.  Buried by Disney until the Academy Awards, the latest creation of Japan's animation guru is simply stunning -- the best animated feature since Snow White.<br />You've read the plot summaries and perhaps the idea of a Japanese film about a 10-year old girl who gets trapped in the spirit world sounds strange.  But this picture has universal appeal.  I'm an 30-year old white American male and I love this movie.  The (mostly) hand-drawn animation is lush, gorgeous and incredibly dynamic.  And how nice is it to see 3-dimensional characters in a complex touching story that goes in unexpected directions every chance it gets?  It leaves anything produced by Disney/Pixar in the dust.<br />Disney has done an excellent job of bringing this movie to America.  The copy is crisp and clear -- although obviously not as magnificent as on the big screen.  The voice-dubbing is very good, matching the character's mouths without losing content.  I had a slight problem with Princess Mononoke's dubbing because some of the celebrity voices (especially Thornton and Anderson) were distracting.  That's not the case here.  The english voices are perfectly cast (especially Suzanne Pleshette as Yubaba/Zeniba).<br />A few notes on the DVD.  The extras are OK with the exception of an outstanding Japanese TV special on the making of Spirited Away.  Rather than focus on the technical aspects, it focuses on Miyazaki himself and his uber-talented group of artists at Studio Ghibli.  It's definitely worth your time.<br />Also, some comments have unfavorably compared this version to the Japanese version.  For the record, Disney is contractually forbidden from changing a single frame of the movie -- not one frame.  Period.  There *are* some differences in dialogue but you can watch in Japanese with more literally translated subtitles (subtitle track 2) if you prefer.<br />Final comment:  this movie may not be suitable for very young children as it has some scary sequences and is over two hours long.  But for everyone else, this is an incredible movie.  And for animation fans, it's a must-have.
B00008S2VG|5.0|1. AMERICAN LIFE - funky. tough sound. a tongue-in-cheek rap at the end.<BR>2. HOLLYWOOD - this one's sick. reminds of her last cd and of sheryl crows sound.<BR>3. I'M SO STUPID  appealing sound. candid lyrics.<BR>4. LOVE PROFUSION - not as strong of a song as the rest. the energy is indecisive. would remix well though.<BR>5. NOBODY KNOWS ME - admirable techno song. tired lyrics. <BR>6. NOTHING FAILS - mellow. honest sound. solid lyrics.<BR>7. INTERVENTION - sweet lyrics. simple & pretty song.<BR>8. X-STATIC PROCESS - beautiful guitar. at her best vocally here. her voice lends well to the lyrics.<BR>9. MOTHER & FATHER - not a favorite at first, but the lyrics really got me the second time around.<BR>10. DIE ANOTHER DAY  strong energy. this one holds its own. similar energy & sound to AMERICAN LIFE.<BR>11. EASY RIDE - calm at the beginning, then works some awesome beats and turns out great.<BR>This is an eclectic, funky and honest blend of Madonna and Mirwais Ahmadzaïs talents. The scale from techno highs to acoustic lows is impressive; the range from uncompromising rapping to tender lyrics is vivid. To pick favorites, Id go with American Life, Hollywood, Nothing Fails, Intervention, X-Static Process and Easy Ride. After loving the two pounding singles off this album, I was surprised and pleased to find quality acoustic numbers to enjoy as well. Not as glitzy and persuasive as the last album, but more interesting and real. Perhaps a Music facade with a Ray of Light soul. Give it a listen.
B000002J09|5.0|Zeppelin IV is the first album of theirs that I ever owned.  I can honestly say that it changed my entire perspective on music.  I was instantly turned on to classic rock, and that is of course all that Led Zeppelin embodies, CLASSIC ROCK.  For anyone who thinks that Zeppelin is a so-called \\"pop\\" band, he or she is greatly mistaken.  They were the originators of hard rock/heavy metal!  Any person who would seriously try to find similarities between Led Zeppelin and ANY artist of today is a fool.  Every song on Zeppelin IV is pure genius.  \\"Black Dog\\" is explosive in all aspects.  Plant wails away as Page pounds out that unforgettable riff on his guitar.  \\"Rock and Roll\\" is a classic, and Bonzo's drumming is truly unique in this song.  \\"Battle of Evermore\\" is a fantastic epic with and eerie, chilling sound and allusions to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" perhaps the band's most well-known song, is incredibly intricate and really showcases Page's talents.  The lyrics are unforgettable, and Plant sings like no other lead singer I have ever heard.  \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" is a really great song with more tributes to the Lord of the Rings.  It is one of the few songs where Page provides backup vocals, and I think they sound really well complementing Plant's.  It is definitely worth listening to.  \\"Four Sticks\\" is another song that shows off Bonham's skills on the drums and also the bongos, which sound great combined with Page's guitar work.  \\"Going to California\\" is one of the greatest folk songs ever.  Page's guitar sounds so beautiful, and the lyrics are equally so.  \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" is the second longest song on the album behind \\"Stairway.\\"  Plant shows off his harmonica skills, and Bonham's drumming is very slow and melodic, but very powerful.  Again, Page plays a redundant but powerful guitar riff.  It really ends the cd well, but every song is just superb.  I do understand that some people don't like every song on the cd, and that's fine....  It is a work of pure musical genius.  Any REAL classic rock fan can see that Led Zeppelin is among the greatest bands of all time, and in my opinion they ARE the greatest band of all time.
B00000I07Q|5.0|This is the greatest album ever made by probably the greatest band in the world.  Only the last track lets this album down otherwise it cold be labelled perfection.<br />Bon Jovi still play the first eleven tracks at concerts which show just how good this album is.  I mean how many do you here from Crush or These Days?<br />Lay Your Hands on Me probably the biggest concert song ever starts of this album.  The beauty about the songs on this album is that they're written to be played live so even though their not you still get a similar sort of feeling to that which you do at a concert.<br />Some of the lesser played on the radio songs such as Blood on Blood, Wild Is The Wind and 99 In the Shade are my favourites.<br />I don't like the last track Love For Sale which if you haven't heard it is a song set in the recording studio with Richie Sambora (the guitarist) and Jon Bon Jovi constantly talking over it about a girl who wants Jon home instead of making the album.  I think it is a terrible song and they should have left it off to appear on their terrible filler album thirteen years later Crush or just threw it in the bin.<br />If you're a Bon Jovi fan this is their greatest album and you definitely purchase it. Eleven tracks of sheer brilliance are contained within.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Never mind that Russell Crowe did not receive the Oscar for his brillant performance -- still mad about that; and never mind that the script was so brillant -- still in awe about that; and never mind that I was so completely taken in by the story, the acting and directing -- the conclusion was the best ending to a wonderful story I have ever seen.  In fact, I have seen it close to 25 times and I'm still surprised, still entertained, and still in awe of all who had a part in it's production.  Never mind, my sense of respect and admiration for the man and woman this film tells us about.  Wonderful film.  Wonderful performances.  Wonderful story.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel was one of the best books I have ever read.  Garth Nix brings you into a world very much like our own.  By now you probably know all about the book, having read the other reviews.  It really is hard to put down.  Sabriel was fun to read.  At the end, it doesn't really seem complete.  It's almost like it just stops, and there is a reason.  There are two more books after Sabriel. They are Lirial and Abhorsen. They are also great books.  I'm suggesting you go ahead and buy all three, especially if you enjoy magic and unknown secrets.  I believe that there could be more to the series, for Abhorsen ends just like Sabriel, without letting you know exactly what happened or if it will continue.  Sabriel is a great read, and it great to share with friends.  I know I did!
B00008S2VG|1.0|This album is evidence that Madonna has lost touch since moving<BR>to England.  WHAT WAS SHE THINKING?!  Madonna uses controversy<BR>to entertain and I can dig that, but this album is not entertaining at all and is rather offensive.  If you buy it you<BR>are wasting your money.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is a sensational album and the best debut album I've ever heard.  Every song on here is great, there are no fillers which is pretty rare for any album let alone a first up one.<br />All of the songs are about relationships or her so if you want different subject matter you might not want this.  They are so well written though especially for someone so young.  I really don't know why the marketing department of this album went for the skater image as it has probably caused many would be fans to not be exposed to this great album.<br />This is the greatest album to come out of 2002 by a long way.  If you like well written songs and good music then you have to buy this album.  I'm betting Avril Lavigne will be the female version of Bon Jovi in the years to come.  Yes I'm aware Bon Jovi is a band but she obviously has the writing talent to become a legend on her own.<br />Even the other songs you get when you buy her singles are sensational.<br />Buy this album!
B00008PW3Q|5.0|How great it is to hear the two these wonderful and talented singers harmonize again.  The best songs on this album feature them singing together.  With 18 songs on this album, I give it five stars, even if I am not crazy about a few of the songs.  There are easily enough great songs to make up a normal 12 set album.<br />Thanks for the great music and welcome back FM!!!
B00008S2VG|5.0|Of course, there has been the hype with the &quot;American Life&quot; video, but that is to be expected.  No one can deny that Madonna is a shrewd business woman who knows how to stir up interest in her music.  I applaud her for that.  Aren't we all just self promoters at heart?  &quot;American Life&quot; is definitely some of Madonna's most personal music since &quot;Like A Prayer.&quot;  You should really take the time to listen to the lyrics on &quot;American Life&quot;, you might be surprised.  My only complaint is that the lyrics aren't included in the CD packaging, but you can get them from her website.  In the past few years Madonna has been moving towards a new musical path, more electronica than usual, and I must say it does fit her.  Her work with Mirwais on the tracks on &quot;American Life&quot; and her past few years of work have really been some of her best music.  &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot; is one of the great ones on &quot;American Life.&quot;  And check out that gospel choir on &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;, I was not expecting that.  However, once again with Madonna, the unexpected really works.  I would say my favorite track on &quot;American Life&quot; would have to be &quot;Mother and Father.&quot;  If that song doesn't bring some emotion out in you, you are not human.  So, should you buy &quot;American Life?&quot;  Most definitely.  Will you enjoy it and will it spend a lot of time in your changer?  Yes and yes.  Good work once again Maddy!
B000002KP3|5.0|Picture it: the year 2002 is winding down and a very bored 22 year old is still searching in vain for that one cd that will overwhelm her this year.  You know what I mean, at least once a year you find that cd that you just cannot live without, that one you listen to with such ferocity that even your friends know most of the songs 'cause every mixed tape you give them  includes this certain album's output.  In years past it's been The X Ray Spex, Marianne Faithful, Joy Division, The Buzzcocks, The Smiths, The Cure, Iggy and The Stooges, Billie Holiday, Bikini Kill, The Slits, The Raincoats, The Clash, The Specials, Madness, The Sex Pistols, Le Tigre and...well, you can see that I'm not at a loss for bands to become devoted to.  Which brings me back to the end of last year.  The Faint was good, Ladytron was good, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Strokes, The Hives and everyone else of their ilk were good but...what's missing?  I picked up the album Electric Warrior 'cause I had heard Bang A Gong a couple of days earlier on the radio and had always wanted to check out T Rex.  Before I even got to the second track I must have played Mambo Sun about 10 times.  Seriously, I had no expectations whatsoever of this album and I couldn't believe that the first song had grabbed me by the throat and threatend to throttle me within an inch of my life.  In the days and weeks that followed Electric Warrior became part of my daily routine. Each day would start and end with selections from Electric Warrior.  I have read some of the reviews that say this album sounds dated but I beg to differ.  The weird imagery and inventive riffs make the album sound like something that sprang from a lo-fi indie label in the late 80's. I think that this album takes the hearer completely by surprise if they don't know what to expect.  About a month after I started adoring Electric Warrior I went to visit my close friend who lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn which is a teaming with art students and young bohotypes.  While sitting in a fairly hip little coffee shop just down the street from her house one of the baristas took out whatever ambient music had gone largely ignored by my ears and put in what I recognized as the first strains of Mambo Sun.  I couldn't believe that my new favorite band was being played in a different state by someone close to my own age in a cool little coffee shop.  I resolved to strike up a conversation with barista boy with great taste in music as the last strains of Cosmic Dancer faded into oblivion.  Using a refill as an excuse I ambled up to the counter and thus discovered that the little beggar was also a recent T Rex convert who, through the same trick of fate as me only knew the band through Get It On and whos musical tastes had led him to his newest, greatest discovery which just happened to coincide with my own.  No guff, this really happend and though I'm in no way inplying that purchasing this album is going to lead you to finding romance with a spikey haired coffee boy in Brooklyn I am saying that some other life altering stuff will come your way 'cause there's no way that you could listen to an album this good and not have it effect your life for the better.  Ok, enough hearts and flowers go out and buy this and then buy The Slider.  What more can I say?  I love you Mark!-<br />Poly Styrene
B00008S2VG|4.0|Hello viewers. I must add that Madonnas new album titled *American Life* kicks some ... . The songs are all meaningful, and the beats, styles, etc are really outstanding. When I heard of Madonnas new album, I thought its not going to do well. In selling at least. When I heard the album, now I own the album. It completly changed my point of view. The songs. *Nobody Knows me* *Mother and Father* *Nothing Fails* WOW!! awsome. You wont believe the tricks Madonna has in store for you all, on this new album of hers. Do believe it. *American Life* is an album to own. Its twice as good as *Music* *American Life* blows *Music* way out of the watter. Buy it, at least listen to some clips, you'll see what i'm talking about. (Nothing fails) Its the truth. Madonna will live on.
B00005JLH3|4.0|My review of \\"Drumline\\" is based on what I saw at the theater, not on home video.  First of all, the plot is pure formula, inspired by \\"An Officer and A Gentleman\\".  Remove that complaint, and it's a great film. The movie is highly original in that it shows, (perhaps for the first time on the screen), what it's really like to be in a marching band in college. This film does an excellent job in showing a real-life school, with real people, in a way that should not offend that many people.  There's no real gratutious sex, violence, or bad language. What it has is in keeping with it's PG-13 rating.                                                       Nick Cannon graduates from a high school in a lower-income neighborhood in New York City.  He was raised by his mother, his father having little to do with either one of them.  He gets a musical diploma to a college in Atlanta.  He has an attitude; he's a great drummer and he knows it.  We later find out he cann't read sheet music, (he lied on his college application), but he has the ability to learn very fast by hearing alone. The fact that Nick was raised by a single parent also contributes to his bad attitude towards the world.  Nick does have some good morals, but, it takes some attitude adjustment to bring them out. Orlando Jones, the only big name in the cast, is very believable as the musical director who is stuck on out-of-date music, that while nice to listen to, is not winning the big competition with the other schools.  The college pricipal really wants a winning band, much like another pricipal would want a winning football team.                          The movie shows that being on a marching band means being on time, being part of a team, constant workouts, (just as hard as the football players), and when one person makes a mistake everyone suffers. Also there are four levels in the band from the most talented down to the rookiees.  A person on a lower lever can challenge a person on a higher level to a one-on-one musical competition for their seat. The nerve-racking fact that college students, many in their teens or early twenties, have to be near perfect in front of a stadium filled with thousands of people is also shown.I doubt if what it really means to be in a band in college has ever been shown in such detail in a movie before.  For the record, I was never in a band in school, but those who were, have said what is shown on the screen  is very accurate.                                        \\"Drumline\\" does have moments when what the viewer expected to happen does occur, but, it has enough surprises to keep the film-goer engaged.  The acting, camera work, music, and location filming are all first rate.  This is more than a \\"fish out of water\\" film, this is a movie about real people at a real college playing in a real marching band.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|This album showcases not only the unique musicianship of the Buckinham/Nicks pairing, but also Lindsay's brilliant songwriting and amazing production abilities.  Song's like &quot;Murrow&quot; and &quot;Come&quot; are some of the best ever from this band.  And Stevie's amazing musical diary of the 9/11 tradgedy, &quot;Illume&quot; is phenomenal.  Other standout tracks include, &quot;Peacekeeper,&quot; &quot;Running Through The Garden,&quot; and &quot;Goodbye, Baby.&quot;  This album shows not only musical growth, but the truly amazing talent of the four musicians involved.  One can hear Christine McVie's ghost floating over the album, as well as Sheryl Crow, whose subtle backgrounds add the perfect spice to make this one of the best albums of the band's extensive career.
B000089CKH|4.0|Most of the reviews for this album are richly worded and prodigiously positive so I really don't need to say much here except this ....<br />Its refreshing to hear a band come out with an unexpectedly beautiful album with refreshing lyrics and sweet, organic, melodies. 'Blond on Blond' slows things down while making it all seem possible, and stays with you long after the song's over. How Nada Surf evolved their sound and style from 'Popular' to the entire &quot;Let Go&quot; album is remarkable even though 'Popular' was an incredible tune and statement about high school. At the very least this is worth a kick back one evening with a 'for headphones only' listening experience. But you'll probably want more. Hope they tour ...
B000089A07|5.0|Red Dragon is, quite simply, an incredible film. Brett Ratner's direction shines through beautifully in this masterpiece. The best of the 3, without a doubt. Edward Norton and Ralph Fiennes demonstrate their great talent in a very powerful story. Don't turn this down. The portrayal of the story in this film is shocking. The twists and the way they bring out the twists is just truly worth buying it alone. The extra features are definitely worth the extra 5 bucks. My favorite movie- Seriously, folks. Bravo to the cast and crew... BRAVO!!!!
B000022TSV|5.0|If Friedrich Nietzsche watched Carmen twenty times, then why can't we?  But which version?  Perhaps this is one time that purists should deviate from their allegiance to staged productions and buy the on-location movie, directed by Francesco Rosi and starring Julia Migenes-Johnson as Carmen and Placido Domingo as Don Jose.<br />Granted, the Covent Garden production featuring Maria Ewing as Carmen has many stellar qualities as well.  But in it Nuria Espert, the renowned actress/director, chose to portray Carmen as such a cruel figure that her sexuality is confuted by her eagerness to harm others.  This is not the Carmen that Bizet had in mind nor the one portrayed in Rosi's film.<br />Rosi's Carmen, Migenes-Johnson, demonstrates an exquisite dramatic ability from beginning to end, with eyes, body, and voice able to project defiance, sexuality, disgust, and even resignation as the occasion demands.  She dances and strips steamily for Don Jose at Lilla Pastia's tavern and manages somehow a perfect foot flick of her skirt into the hands of that poor sap as he awaits the consummation of his fantasy, grown that much stronger from a month's incarceration on Carmen's account.  But Carmen can be fatalistic as well, as when she reads the cards forecasting her death at the beginning of Act III, or sad, so very sad, outside the bullring at the conclusion of the opera when she goes to meet her fate.  Everything in this production is sung well, including the part of Escamillo, played by the dashing Ruggero Raimondi, and the part of Michaela, played by the necessarily sweet Faith Esham.  Domingo, of course, is in his prime.<br />No other version of Carmen so vividly portrays the essential conflict of the opera: that of duty, honor and obedience on the one hand and freedom and sexuality on the other.  The soldier's life versus the gypsy's.  Rosi's decision to begin the movie with the bullfight scene and the actual killing of a bull (Note that there is no disclaimer about no animalsbeing killed in the making of the film) is brilliant.  We start with a bullfight and end with a bullfight.  Begin with the inevitable death of a toro and end with the inevitable death of Carmen. There is a perfect metaphorical parallelism here.  For what is Carmen's story but that of unbridled wildness necessarily killed off?<br />Rosi's location filming of Carmen succeeds in representing a time and place more engagingly and thoroughly than any stage production could.  The harsh light of southern Spain quickly draws the viewer into the ambience of Seville.  The tobacco factory is a marvelous exercise in controlled pandemonium mixed with pre-industrial production (notice the babies and toddlers in the factory and the gaiety of the women workers).  The gypsy encampment is so very picturesque in Act II.  And everywhere in this movie there is dust.  There must be dust.  This sense of verisimilitude and chronological and scenic appropriateness are enhanced by superb camera work, terrific interior lighting, and a genius's sense of film composition.  Many times while viewing this Carmen I hit \\"pause\\" on my DVD remote control so that I could admire the spatial construction and lighting of a particular shot.  \\"Like a painting,\\" I would say to myself, \\"Like a painting.\\"   <br />Nietzsche wrote about Carmen:  \\"How such a work makes one perfect.  One becomes a `masterpiece' oneself.\\"  This is a good version of Carmen on which to test Nietzsche's theory.

B00006IU73|5.0|Anyone who can contribute to the vastly different areas of death meatl (Opeth) and to the prog metal scene (Office of Stratefic Influence) and draws frequent comparisons to Pink Floyd, has a lot to offer musically.  The CD is a mix of almost any style you can think of, not belonging to any of them, but rather creating a whole new category.  There is so much creativity to listen for, that the CD will never get old.  And it can just rock at times.  An excellent addition to my collection.

These Market books are the most enjoyable, fact filled, common sense, intense realization anyone can come across. They provide such intuitive information that they are a MUST READ for anyone interested in trading. They were also so amazingly FUN and Interesting to read. I read both books in less than 2 weeks. At times I could hardly put them down. The question answer format makes it so smooth a read that you forget time and location and just want to get to the next question as each one delivers facts to incorporate if you so wish into your own trading regimen. These have to be the best trading books ever if you listen to what is said over and over.<BR>1) STOP loss orders.<BR>2) % of portfolio per investment to diversify.<BR>3) Indexes to look at <BR>4) taking notes why you bought, sold to remember for future what worked and what didn't.<BR>5) Riding winners.<BR>and many more. Some seem so basic but the continued reiteration by market wizards show us how uncommon it is for regular people to follow as many would have protected wealth created by the tech bubble but blew it as none of these ideas they focus on were adhered to and we were wiped out. I was fortunate to survive the tech bubble and an now reading to take advantage of the next economic upturn globally using and implementing these ideas and rules to live by only if implemented which is what human nature isn't instinctly done but must be to live to profit another day.
B000002UAO|5.0|So far, I have given 5 star to 6 CDs.  This is one of them.  From the start to finish, this CD has a rich sounds with satisfying songs such as Nowhere Man, In My Life, and Girl.  This CD feels much more personal than any other Beatles CD.  Also, the main guitar sound for this CD was acoustic guitar.  This was a true &quot;Album&quot; for all the songs seem to have togetherness except for &quot;Wait&quot; which sounds more like from Help! CD.  This is much more &quot;mellow&quot; CD than other Beatles CDs.<br />I remember reading that the songs from this CD were written and recorded within 6 week.  To me, this CD is more enjoyable and the quality of the songs better than Sgt. Pepper CD.  To create this masterful recording in 6 weeks is just remarkable.  The songs are not as experimental as &quot;Revolver&quot; or &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; but the songs are quite diverse and enjoyable.
B00008GKEG|5.0|OK,first of all, I'll admit up front I've only watched the first four episodes of this DVD so far, but I'm hooked.  I was fascinated by all of it, but was taking it pretty much in stride until the end of episode three (the first episode on the second DVD).  They were showing footage of The Beatles triumphant return to Liverpool in June of 1964.  As background, they used the full song &quot;Things We Said Today&quot; by Paul McCartney.  I was listening through headphones to the DTS track, even though I don't have a DTS system, and I literally came up out of my chair in amazement.  This song was recorded almost 40 years ago with primitive technology by today's standards, but the sound quality of this mix was as good as anything I've heard on a DVD to date.  How the hell did they do that?  Buy this DVD!
185984054X|1.0|What is so bad about Mother Theresa? She is a conservative Catholic who actually did what the left has failed at so patheticaly. Helped the poor physically, but much more restored their dignity. I remember when we were all swearing to each other in college that we were going to do the same thing. Well, we didn't always succeed and for someone like Hitchens the unkindest cut is seeing what we saw as the oppressor up on the pedistal we'd envisioned for ourselves.<br />I always considered myself a liberal especially in being an advocate for the poor. I've grown more and more shocked at the depths the left has fallen to. We had the best intentions, but many of our policies have failed. The public schools system is a mess (controlled exclusively by liberals for years), socialism (except in its european evolution which is indistinguishable from capitalism with a little keynes and some rhetoric) has been an indefensiable disaster which brought a mind numbing cost in life, happiness and freedom (despite what people say now we defended all of this from Vietnam to Cuba). We are bad at defense issues. Reagan was right about the USSR and the cold war, and today Russians and Eastern Europeans all but kiss the ground at the mention of his name (I lived there for several years, they are all would be republicans who would laugh in your face if you told them you were a 60s protester). <br />Here was one woman who saw something horribly wrong and damaging to human dignity, and she didn't write an article or bemoan some policy - she stepped up to the hot seat, and with all her flawed humanity at the table, did the right thing.<br />I think she is a miracle, and the left should look to her for an example. Our ideals were right, we were just not Mother Theresas. Maybe one day we can all become more like her and it will be us deserving the thanks, and not the scorn, of the poor.
B0000648WZ|3.0|The movie is fun.  It is filled with action and adventure and great special effects.  The story is interesting, all in all one of the best sci fi films in recent years, but...<br />It needs a different title.  Heinlein's novel points out the failings of the American justice and social systems and offers alternatives.  I have read the book many times and his suggestions are not satire.  Heinlein was often critical of modern society in his works (Farnham's Freehold, etc).<br />Not to mention the different identities of the characters in the books.  Women are not allowed in combat, Flores is a man who gets killed in the first chapter, Carl dies early on and is not in &quot;Games and Theory,&quot; etc.  Heinlein's story is a first person narrative of John (Juan) Rico's life in the MI as well as a book honoring the US Marines.<br />Do see the movie, it is a good time, but read the book as well!  The book will make you think, the movie will make you smile.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I was very excited for this album, and i think it is very strong.  The main reason why i give it 5 stars though is because of Stevie.  I think Lindsey just went a little to over board with some of his songs, like red rover, and come, but I think all of stevie's songs are great, i especially like Goodbye Baby, Everybody Finds Out and Smile at You.  Lindsey does have some good tunes too like Miranda, Steal your heart away, and of course bleed to love her which was on \\"the dance\\", which kind of make up for his weirdness in other songs.  I think Stevie shines the most, and of course we all miss christine.
B000089RVX|4.0|I've read the reviews and I've listened to the album (&quot;Fallen&quot;). Evanescence is in no way defining a new, &quot;ground-breaking&quot;, style of music as goth-rock/metal has been around for a while (Remember &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;?). Mix in the Electronica and &quot;operatic&quot; elements and Evanescence will still sound familiar to those fortunate enough to be exposed to varied musical sources.<br />For the rest of us limited to our daily dose of MTV and public radio stations' playlist, Evanescence's &quot;Fallen&quot; is a Godsend. There aren't a lot of &quot;unique&quot; artistes on the Charts today and Evanescence qualifies easily.<br />It is primarily Amy Lee's vocal prowess that elevate the music of Evanescence above the works of their contemporary's. Her voice and vocal delivery is something rare in the music industry nowadays. Coupled with clever arrangements and songwriting skills, Evanescene's &quot;Fallen&quot; is full of musical gems that clearly exhibit the band's love for their style of music.<br />One area that Evanescence seem to fail in is the originality of both their musicianship and playing style. Derivatives abound throughout the album but thankfully, due to clever mastering, is never overwhelming.<br />Eventhough &quot;Fallen&quot; may not be the musical tour-de-force as some of these reviews make it out to be, it is nonetheless a worthy addition to any &quot;Rocker's&quot; album list. The songs are never a chore to listen too. I myself have put the album on &quot;Repeat&quot; many times (Thank God for the Shuffle/Random button, though!).<br />Still, one can't help feel that &quot;Fallen&quot; is just a taste, a precursor of greater things to come from these talented individuals. Two years is not too long to wait and believe me, wait you must for Evanescence deserves your trust.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|The Mac are back with an incredible new disc.  18 songs that get better with every listen.  I believe that every member has tremendously improved...Lindsey's guitar work is genius(just listen to \\"Come\\" for an aggressive sound or \\"Say Goodbye\\" for a more acoustic Lindsey.) and maybe now he'll finally get the credit he deserves.  Stevie's lyrics are amazing and her voice is in top form(especially in \\"Illume,\\" \\"Goodbye Baby\\", and \\"Everybody Finds Out\\").  Mick and John, as always, keep everything going with their stellar drum and bass work.  <br />This album definitely ranks up there with Rumours and the underappreciated Tusk and is WELL worth a listen!  <br />5 Stars*****!!
0671250671|5.0|Let me get to the point.  This is the best book I have ever read.  Period.  I read the book with the premise that perhaps every thought was correct.  I was never so moved and I became a much wiser man.  I crossed over to the spiritual side for the first time as an adult.<BR>-dk
B00008S2VH|4.0|This album is very different from her other albums she made, american life is more rock and less techno sounds but it has new beats and lots of guitar playing, she did great making this album so i hope u'll like it 2<br />(fav tracks)<BR>love profusion<BR>hollywood<BR>im so stupid<BR>mother &amp; father<BR>nothing fails
0312305060|5.0|I felt a passionate love for humanity when I was done reading this book. One reader felt like everyone in this book was unhappy without reason, but I don't think they were truly unhappy. Even Richard was more sick than unhappy. They just lived and made choices and wondered if those were the right choices. Laura Brown chose to leave her husband and two children. To me this was not a particularly admirable choice, but the consequence to that choice was a different path for several lives. Cunningham emphasizes the unchangability of the past and embraces it. While his characters wonder if they made the right decisions, they still are able to create lives that influence the people around them. <br />I definitely think a reader would benefit from reading Mrs. Dalloway and at least some history of Virginia Woolf before reading this book, though it is not absolutely necessary for understanding.
B00005JLRT|4.0|i am not a hard core fan, but i do collect the dvds and watch all the series on tv. This in my perspective is better than Generations and Insurecction, I, II, IV, V, VI.  This is a loaded movie with lots of action it by far is top 3 in the star trek movie series. I rate it B+, 4 stars. Because of the action, storyline, (SPOILER>>>>>>) and the ... ending.
B00008DDXC|3.0|Like the first \\"Harry Potter\\" DVD, \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" stays true to Potter's legions of young fans, with games, happy-face interviews and trivia tests for tweens and their younger siblings. Film buffs seeking the lowdown on creations such as the fiery Phoenix, Dobby the downcast house-elf and the film's giant snakes and spiders will have to get their own DVD. Grown-up muggles need not apply for this semester at Hogwart's.<br />The 161-minute film looks great, as in theaters, with medieval ambers and black-magic blacks effectively conveying the second installment's darker tone. Skin tones are especially pleasing. Most of the murk that haunted the first \\"Potter\\" film's darker scenes has done a disappearing act.<br />The Dolby Digital 5.1 EX mix comes in English and Spanish, crisply delivering the high-volume jolts as Harry hurls spells and battles the beasts of the underworld. Directional effects are used with reserve, enhancing their impact when finally unleashed  (check out the surround at 1:48, when Harry hurls a hungry spider across your living room.)<br />Menu art alternates between gothic creepy and castle-fire warmth. Fortunately, navigation links don't call for as much needless casting about as last time out.<br />The DVD for \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer Stone\\" cruelly locked its deleted scenes behind a time-consuming game. \\"Phoenix\\" rises above that, providing direct access to 19 outtakes. Most are snippets, but director Chris Columbus unlocks a few telling scenes.<br />\\"Potter\\" author J.K. Rowling and American screenwriter Steve Kloves talk about the project in a fairly informative interview apparently taken from British television.<br />\\"I just steal her best stuff,\\" Kloves says. \\"And I don't sue,\\" Rowlings shoots right back.<br />The classy featurette \\"Setting the Scene\\" gives youngsters a proper lesson in the logistics of filmmaking (\\"It starts with a script ...\\") The docu covers cinematography, sets, costumes, visual effects and other detail rarely found in extras for young people. The featurette should be required viewing in middle schools across the Potter kingdom.<br />The DVD's so-so games include an \\"Evil Dead\\"-like visit to the Forbidden Forest and a maze that rewards victors with an interactive tour of the Chamber of Secrets.y found in extras for young people.

B00002MZ2C|5.0|This is one of Rage's Greatest albums. I liked all of the music on this cd and i didn't like Rage until they came out with this cd. This is a very good buy you are not wasting your money!
B00005JLSE|5.0|This musical is a real delight. The songs are very dynamic and pleasant. The choreography is extremely brilliant. The film uses all possibilities it can find and require to transform the screen into a total ballet, with several layers of dancing, especially a background that has its own autonomy and yet takes part in the whole thanks to editing special effects. The film constantly shifts from the real story into the musical construction and imaginary artistic dream. But what can the meaning of this film be ? Just a few questions. Why is the first ever hanged woman in Illinois a Hungarian who does not speak English ? What can we do with the vision of the defense lawyer as a director and choreographer of a superproduction for the best musical theaters ? What can we do with the acquittal of two criminals on the basis of lies and manipulations ? How can justice be that manipulatable ? Isn't it the very negation of justice itself ? And yet the film is highly entertaining and pleasant and tries to show in all possible ways that women are the victims of men and have to organize themselves to resist this male-dominated society, though the lawyer who saves them, if he wants, if he is paid enough, is a man, the very negation of the previous idea. So contradictions and contradictions, and contradictions. And yet these contradictions make the film even more attractive and entertaining by erasing the seriousness of the discourse that lies behind this shimmering, glittering and glimmering surface.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan
B00008S2VF|4.0|Very few artists excite me with the release of a new album, but Madonna is one of them.  With many thanks to MTV's The Leak, people were able to stream her entire album before today and listen with pleasure.<br />American Life is typical Madonna: her standard cutting-edge, storytelling lyrics and the ability to keep it fresh for the evolving music world.  She again leans towards her love for electronica (much like Music) and delivers a solid album.  Many think it would be an abomination to NOT give one of her recordings FIVE STARS, and despite the huge fan I am, this album really only earned FOUR STARS.  Although the material is good, there wasn't any one song that totally blew me away (ie: Like A Prayer, Erotica, Don't Tell Me, etc).  <br />In her attempt to truly &quot;Express Herself&quot; with this recording, she may lose a little mainstream support, but that's what being an artist is all about.  Madonna still has my heart regardless of what she delivers musically...
038572179X|2.0|If I feel like I gained something, anything, from a book after I finish it, I usually say I liked the book.  I gained NOTHING from reading this book.  No character development, poor historical context and descriptions, boring predictable story.  Sentences were structured well and the book had the potential for a decent story, that's why I gave it 2 instead of 1 star.  <br />Don't waste your time with this book.

0066214122|2.0|I was extemely impressed with Michael Chriton when I read this novel.  Not at the quality of the writing, the plot, or the science though; rather I was impressed that he could make nanobots act just like dinosaurs.<br />The writing is still just as gripping as in his other books, and the inconsistencies in the plot aren't too obvious, but none of the characters are really well developed, and they often act in ways that add drama to the story, rather than as a consiquece of their personalities or logic.<br />The science is perhaps the worst thing about the book.  In Jurassic Park the only strange thing seemed to be Chriton's belief that Zoos couldn't possbily work.  In Prey, though, we see numerous examples of confusion about the sizes of things, over and misuse of buzzwords, and downright magical evolution.  The creatures in Prey seem to evolve new abilities in just one or two generations, evolve without selective pressure, and evolve as a group rather than as individuals-all without exchanging genes.<br />If you want something fun to read, adn don't have too much background in science, this book could be quite fun.  Just don't believe the science.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen!! Usually I am very picky about movies, but this one is wonderful. If you haven't seen it you need too. Ewan Mcgreggor sings like an angel!<BR>This movie is different, but its still one of my favorites!
0780619587|5.0|Even now, after seeing &quot;The Pianist&quot; from Polansky, I think that SHINE is equally or even a more &quot;brilliant&quot; film, let's say... And in fact the main Shine Actor role demands such an interpretation that we don't see in &quot;The Pianist&quot;, which actor almost look the world on a passive way... Shine, on the other hand, is an amazing film, it's actor seems to really incorporate and love the character !! Shine exuberates in love for life in such a way that it literally extracts tears from our eyes.<br />Perhaps if the &quot;The pianist&quot; actor would be that one of Shine, the result could be better.<br />In a phrase: Shine is one of the best all time movies. Get it!<br />Dihelson Mendonca
B00005JLXE|5.0|Daredevil was the best of the superhero films...I guess because of the fact that the character is the most human of all.  Garner was great in the film, and I thought Affleck played his part very well.  I like the \\"darkness\\" that comes with it, and I thought Kingpin was casted well.  This movie could have been an even bigger hit if they would have marketed it a little better before its release.  I highly recommend it.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Save your money! All the innovation that was part of Madonna's early and mid career is completely gone on this CD. Is it dance? Is it rock? Is it pop? Who knows - it's all over the place!
B00008S2VG|5.0|I was pleasently surprised when listening to this album considering I wasnt a big fan of the title track. Beautiful music and her voice has never sounded better.
B000063V8U|4.0|This is ST:TNG at its best.  The uniforms are fitting and the plots involving.  Every character is examined and every un-tied conclusion re-visited.  If you loved the series this was the season for you [though perhaps hard to follow for those unfamiliar with it].  Whenever I need a break, I drop in a disc which reminds me why my childhood was so full of hopeful imagination.  I relish in that adolescent optimism which has brought me thus far and shall hopefully continue to inspire my own adventures into the uncharted lands of contemporary American society.
B00006RIO7|4.0|I went out on a limb buying this soundtrack as I hadnt yet seen the movie. And I was glad I did. Having read many articles beforehand on Catherine Zeta Jones, I knew about her work in musicals, so I wasnt very surprised at her brilliant voice. Renee Zellweger also does an admireable job, complementing Zeta Jones's voice perfectly. Another highlight is Queen Latifah's spine tingling rendition of When Your Good To Mama. And whoever knew John C Reilly could sing so well? <BR>The only reason this soundtrack doe not receive 5 stars is the 2 end tracks which are vaugely annoying and seem pointless.
0800141660|4.0|I just loved this movie!!!  It made me laugh and cry, Emma Thompson's character was great in how she made it through the ups and downs of her relationship with Hugh Grant's character, she was so strong.  I also LOVED Alan Rickman, it's finally nice to see him in a role that he was perfect for, if only all men were like him!  If you enjoy a little comedy and romance this movie is great.
B00008S2VG|5.0|After a first listen to AMERICAN LIFE, I realized that I will be satisfied for quite some time, much longer than with Madonna's previous two CDs. AMERICAN LIFE is Madonna's most ambitious and well-rounded material to date, and the overall CD is more cohesive and exuberant than both Ray of Light and Music. And even with the negative publicity she's been getting lately, the song AMERICAN LIFE is real Madonna, a mixed bag of thumping beats and lush balladry: it shows off both sides of Madonna well. <br />I think that Madonna should now begin focusing on the creativity of her overall CDs more than worrying about her singles success. Who cares anymore that she collects another top 10 hit? She is the QUEEN OF POP and she's proven it by far over any other silly, meaningless diva out there.
B00008S2VH|5.0|This album is wonderful! Madonna at her best, one of the top albums of her career. Worth picking up if you have not heard it! A+
6304698798|5.0|The Good the Bad and the Ugly can easily be called one of the greatest films of all time.  From Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach's superb acting to the brilliant directing of Sergio Leone, the film is a masterpiece.  The dvd allows the viewer to watch in awe of the amazing work done on this film.  The composition of every shot is breathtaking and the plot is gripping.  Plus, Clint Eastwood is the man!
B00000099Y|5.0|The whole album functions as a unique body of work. The sound is unique and powerful. Impossible to describe in words! Amazing musicianship here. Buy this one as soon as you can!
B00008S2VG|5.0|While I am a huge Madonna fan, I have to admit I was skeptical of this new album with all of the controversy surrounding the title song \\"American Life.\\" I was also skeptical of the sound of the album, because while Madonna is known for changing her image as well as her sound the theme for \\"Die Another Day\\" sounded just like it jumped right off of her \\"Music\\" album, which in my opinion was not her best work. Instead this album is comparable to \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Ray of Light\\" as to the unique sounds and the meanings behind the songs. While there is some \\"dance\\" music the majority is introspective and in my opinion this album shows Madonna as a force in the music world that will be around for a long time. Her work has finally become art, so while Elvis and Tina Turner are the King and Queen of Rock, Madonna has emerged with a great new offering that has reaffirmed her status as the Queen of Pop.
B00008AY3L|3.0|Well, I must confess: I'm a great fan of Ben, and to me everything he does is magic. This time it's different. It must be said that &quot;Diamonds On The Inside&quot; is a great album, for the complexity and the refinement of the sounds, but still it doesn't like me as well as &quot;Welcome To The Cruel World&quot; or &quot;Fight For Your Mind&quot; and i think it's just because of this &quot;mountain of sounds&quot; which are really well played, of course, but are too many. I used to love (and I do love now) the more simple side of Ben, songs palyed with few instruments and, above all, not electronic instruments (keyboards, synthesizers, etc.). In spite of all that, this album is very good and surely much more better than any other lp since the beginning of the year up to now. <BR>P.S. Go watching Ben Harper live if you can, he's amazing, one of the greatest musician of these times.
1592220045|5.0|What else would you expect from George R.R. Martin but the best? I read this when I was a sophomore in high school after reading A Game of Thrones, what a discovery. This book is filled with colorful characters that you will either love or hate, each with their own, sometimes hilarius personalities. This book is just awsome, if you are a fan of George Martin, or just a fan of engrossing science fiction this book is defintely for you.
0920668364|5.0|I think this book is absolutely the best book to give to your child. I had this book when I was little and I plan on giving it to my son on his first birthday. The bond between a mother and her son is quite breathtaking and it makes me cry everytime I read this book. There is no reason to run out and get this book. The lady who wrote that this is a creepy book obviously was not held enough as a child and needs to analyze herself, for this is a fun, and truly heartwarming book. To be honest, that lady is creepy for not loving this book. She must not have realized that this book is FICTION! I feel sorry for her child.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I bought this album a few weeks ago, and I think it is very good. Christina was not able to show me her style in this album. I mean, there are Alicia Keys (Impossible), Mariah Carey(Love me for me)(Beautiful), Rock Chics(Fighter),Latin (Infatuation),Some R&amp;B Diva, but where is Christina?<BR>This is why I am giving it a 4 star out of 5. Still, this is a very good album, and you should get it.
B00008OLYN|4.0|There have been a lot of mixed opinions regarding Opeth's new release. Already advertised as a lighter, non-metal outing, many questioned whether Opeth could maintain the listeners' interests without the heavy/light dichotomy that permeates Opeth's previous material. <br />Unfortunately, the answer is not very simple. Opeth has certainly expanded upon the lighter music of previous albums, adding many necessary elements to keep light music interesting without segues into brutal death growls and distorted guitar riffs. The use of keyboards and mellotrons provides necessary atmosphere, and the acoustic guitar riffs are no doubt well written and entertaining. <br />Despite this, however, I still find myself disappointed. Is this music well written, well executed and emotional? If you've listened to anything else from Opeth then you already know that the answer is \\"yes.\\" However, without the heavy aspects of the band, it still feels like something is missing. Many times during this listen, you will hear the standard Opeth build up, expecting the near-orgasmic sensation of Mikael's growl jutting in with a dischordant heavy metal riff, only to find the music cuts off immediately before climax. Pardon the fairly explicit description, but those familiar with Opeth's previous works will find this the musical equivalent of blue balls.<br />After all is said and done, I am still glad I have this album, and I do enjoy it a great deal. In the future, though, I do expect that Deliverance and Blackwater Park will get more listens than this and provide a more satisfying musical experience.
B00005JLSE|5.0|TO those who gave Chicago a bad (actually awful is a more appropriate word) review:<br />What are you thinking?!?!  Chicago was amazing and deserved every oscar it got (and then some!)  Sure the acting wasn't top notch but it was better than some movies I've seen this year! Ahem, I point to a recent movie that was just released that has to do with a white rapper wannabe!  Chicago had amazing music too!  How dare you diss Bob Fosse?  It's beyond my knowledge how anyone with half a brain could dislike Cell Block Tango...  And there was a plot line, I don't know why you people keep saying that!  C'mon is there anyone that supports me here or what?

James peoples it with several interesting characters. A fine effort.

B00006V9A0|2.0|Talk about anti-climactic, this CD was all pomp and little circumstance. As old school grunge rock fans waited with bated breath for the the release of Nirvana's last recorded track a new generation of industrial rock fans wondered what all the fuss was about. The result, an embarassing walk down memory lane with songs that teens have already heard over and over again. To say that this disc was done to death would be kind. Classic Nirvana repackaged in hype just doesn't cut it.

B00005A46T|2.0|If you thought the massive success of Slipknot's debut would dull their commitment to extremity, you were dead wrong! &quot;Iowa&quot;, The band's second album, is even more extreme than the first (I know Slipknot are extreme because I see 98-pound teenagers wearing their T-shirts at the mall all the time). I'm really glad that Slipknot are around to show us how metal should be done. There are no pop melodies to be found here, just nonstop, unrelenting heaviness. This album is more brutal than Morbid Angel's &quot;Covenant,&quot; faster than Slayer's &quot;Reign in Blood,&quot; more complex than Meshuggah's &quot;Destroy Erase Improve,&quot; more original than Opeth's &quot;Blackwater Park,&quot; and better played than Dream Theater's &quot;Scenes from a Memory.&quot; Slipknot are such a heavy band that they don't even need a bassist, because they have a turntablist instead. Now THAT'S extremity for you! Corey taylor has more throat control than any other vocalist I've ever heard, and his hardcore rapping gives this album a real &quot;street&quot; edge. It all adds up the most brilliant album in the history of heavy music, maybe music in general. After all, can millions of suburban teenagers and yuppies be wrong? So if you've been listening to poser metal bands like Nevermore, the Haunted, or Blind Guardian, put that drivel away and step up to something truly underground. Slipknot will surely never appeal to the shallow minds that comprise mainstream society, but be sure to pick up &quot;Iowa&quot; to keep metal alive! <br />&quot;The Prince Of Insufficient Light&quot; says it best, this is just more poser metal.
B00005JLEU|5.0|The other night, my girlfriend and I are heading to the theatre to see Spirited Away. Yes, it's still playing in some theatres. We saw the film when it first came out, and it was her first introduction to the worlds of Hayao Miyazaki. She had no idea what I was taking her to see at the time, she just had to trust me. In fact, I had no idea either; all I knew was that I saw there was a new Miyazaki film and it was playing in theatres. Of course she liked it. Is it possible to not like this film? But anyway, as we were going to see it again, I kept thinking to myself how you can never fully appreciate a Miyazaki film until you've seen it at least twice. Spirited Away was the only film of his I've seen once.<br />I own this film on DVD, but I've only seen the special features because we just went to see it on the big screen. Funny thing is, it cost more for us to go to the theatre the other night than it did to buy the DVD. How many films would you do that for? It's that good!<br />I'll spare you a synopsis as they are over abundant. Instead, let me just tell you this film is a bit bizaar. People compare this film to Alice in Wonderland because it has that same bizaar quality to the setting that could only seem to make sense in a dream. If you are unprepared, it can make the film harder to digest, but I assure you it doesn't take away from the story at all.<br />The first time I saw this film, I thought it was good, but not the best of Miyazaki's films. Seeing it again, makes me doubt that assessment. Miyazaki's films are so full of details and nuances that you easily miss many of them the first time around especially as you are distracted by his wild imagination on screen. I wish I could put into words how magnificent this film is. You simply must see it, and see it again!<br />Keep in mind the film's PG rating. It may not be suitable for young children. Disney may be the one distributing the film, but it is not a Disney film. In other words, don't just shop for this film for your kids. Get it for yourself.film for your kids. Get it for yourself.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This cd has got to be the best one in all of madonna's 20 year career (Do you believe that? one of the good songs on here besides \\"American Life\\" and \\"Die Another Day\\" is \\"Mother And Father\\" it's very personal and she raps on it like on \\"American Life\\" and it has a cool beat.Another cool song is \\"Hollywood\\"<BR>it also has a cool beat and the lyrics are great.The cd is enhanced with a behind the scenes look at the original \\"American Life\\" video it's pretty cool.
B00005JL96|4.0|The best thing I can say about this film, is that it is the closest Disney has ever come to capturing the same magic as a Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke) film.<br />In the U.S., cartoons are for kids. Everyone knows that. Even when they aren't for kids (ie South Park) people will ignorantly rise up and complain that the content isn't suitable for kids. Adults who watch cartoons (unless it's the Simpsons) are labeled freaks or dorks. Especially those who import cartoons from Japan; watch out! And because cartoons are soley for kids, we must dumb them down appropriately. Even though your kid likely is the one who set up your DVD player and fixed your email problem, they still aren't smart like adults right?<br />Even when I was a kid, I hated media directed at kids for the same reason adults don't want to watch it; because it's bad. Disney tries to incorporate adult themes into most of it's films these days in order to make them more appealing to adults. They are after all the ones who take the kids to the movies. But inevitably, every Disney movie has it's childish points. Lilo and Stitch is no different, but what makes it special is it's originality and coming of age themes. If you've ever been fortunate enough to see a Miyazaki film such as My Neighbor Tototo, Kiki's Delivery Service, or Spirited Away, you should have an idea of what I'm talking about. Most of the time, Disney sticks to the tried and true formula of adapting fairy tales, but these stories never deal with real issues. Wouldn't it be nice if you really could fix the world with true loves kiss?<br />On the outside, Lilo and Stitch doesn't seem that interesting (which is why I waited for video and even then it took a while). But I guess the old saying 'don't just a book by it's cover' should apply to movies too, or at least this one. This is really the most impressive Disney movie to come out since Lion King. If it weren't for the few dumbed down parts with childish antics, and maybe with a little refining of the storytelling, it would have been a five star movie. Still, it's one of the few Disney films I'd recommend to adults.with a little refining of the storytelling, it would have been a five star movie.

B000060K4O|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies you can buy. Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, with Harold Ramis are stellar. Here is something people in Hollywood should understand, special effects don't make movies, actors and writing do. In Ghostbusters we get what becomes the standard for comedy and science fiction. Some of your younger viewers will complain about the nature of the special effects, but remember, some of your younger viewers like Eminem, so how smart can they be?<br />Anyway, in the DVD you get some special features that should attract people who may already own the VHS version. One of them is a deleted scene with Aykroyd and Murray playing two homeless guys during the famous dog chase scene. Also, the running commentary feature is entertaining, and provides some insight into the production and evolution of this must see movie.
B00000JFV9|4.0|It's a testament to Curtis Mayfield's talent that an album about drug dealing and tragedy in the urban ghetto could appeal to a 11-year-old white kid in the Connecticut suburbs, but it did. And it is hard to believe that songs such as Freddy's Dead and Superfly once played all day on AM radio, but they did in the early 1970s, when the movie Superfly was released. The waa-waa guitars and Mayfield's falsetto voice and gritty subject matter portrayed in the lyrics are why this album stands the test of time. You DO NOT need to see the movie in order to enjoy the music - I listened to the music in the 70s but didn't see the movie - I guess I was too young then - until I rented the video about 10 years ago. The movie is disappointing. It's a cliche to say 'they don't make them like that anymore' but in the case of Curtis Mayfield's soundtrack to Superfly, and its appeal across racial and economic lines, that is certainly most true.  Curtis Mayfield was crippled in a freak accident during a concert in the 1990s, and now, he is gone.  One has to wonder why a man who gave so much in his music met such a tragic end.
6304140428|5.0|This incredible movie, with a cast of just four people (and a one-line performance from a barman) is breathtaking in terms of the acting and dialogue.<br />It starts out with ascerbic wit and dark humour and goes on to become filled with unexpected turns from the cast, and cruelty and violence of the mind.<br />George (Richard Burton) is a washed out history professor, with a sardonic but quiet manner, and his wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) is a slovenly, alcoholic with a permanently vicious tongue.<br />They invite Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis) to late night drinks at their home, where the older couple tear each other to pieces, drawing the innocent younger couple into their warped and vicious mind-games with large quantities of alcohol for all, to help the destructive process along.<br />The dialogue draws from hilarious humour, such as where George refers to Martha's University Dean father as having `beady red eyes', and where quiet and sweet Honey becomes drunk and for the first time, vocal , to scenes of horror , such as where George becomes more vicious than his wife.<br />While Martha certainly brought this on herself, it is with a sense of disgust that we see him turn unprovoked on Honey, who he tears to shreds- a classic case of the depraved savaging the innocent.<br />The story draws on to reveal through various twists and turns to reveal just how depraved the older couple are, while one wonders why the younger couple stay on at their house....
B000001FI7|5.0|This is, simply put, the best album in the world.  I am convinced, now, having searched diligently for many years for a better album.<br />It starts off sounding wierd.  Then it grows on you a bit -- maybe you find yourself humming along or hearing part of a song in your head.  Then, suddenly, you are addicted, and can't live without the CD.<br />What makes it so good is that every single song on the album is worth listening to.  No, is a MUST listen-to.  There aren't just a few songs that are good.<br />Then there is Beth Gibbons.  She is emotional, but so far from cheesy.  Despondant, but not the roll-your-eyes-ridiculous despondant.  She is REAL.  Her voice comes from her heart.<br />And then there is the rest of the music.  Brilliant is an understatement.  This is the stranded-on-a-desert-island CD.
B00005AQE8|4.0|2pac is a great yet highly overrated rapper. He came out with about 6 or 7 great songs, I cant deny that. But after putting out 7 cds is that really much of an acclomplishment. Every song he wrote was about the same, so if you like this style buy this album. If not, buy a rap cd with true variety, biggie smalls in ready to die. That said i still beleive that Pac was one of the greatest rappers and poets of all time, and he rapped with heart. So any rap fans should buy this cd.
B00008PW3O|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this cd.  I was disappointed to find out that Christine McVie was not involved much with the making of this cd (She has been given credit as an additional artist but the details were not revealed on the particulars.) This cd though recalls the time when Dreams and Gold Dust Woman were hits and also the guitar solos from songs like Sisters in the Moon and Oh Well.  If you enjoyed Stevie Nicks last solo album Trouble in Shangri La, you will like this cd.  Although Christine McVie helped to balance out Fleetwood Mac with their trade mark harmonies on songs such as Little Lies and Everywhere from Tango In The Night, the rest of the Mac have created a very fulfilling album with her noticeable absence.  Lindsey Buckingham is an amazing guitarist and his contribution to the cd is impressive.  At times his guitar solos were a bit heavy handed but in hindsite that is what the 70's were all about.  I recommend this CD to anyone who fondly recalls the more guitar driven Fleetwood Mac.
B00006879E|4.0|Mostly, I listen to music more in the range of Matchbox 20, John Mayer, Goo Goo Dolls, and Michelle Branch, and when I bought tickets to the upcoming local Matchbox 20 concert, I saw that Maroon5 was opening for them, and figured I'd check it out.  What a great decision!  I thought they'd be a more rock-alternative group from what I knew, but boy was I mistaken!  I purchased the CD, and when I listened to it, I was so surprised!  Instead of Matchbox 20 - John Mayer, I got a band closer to Train, the Calling and Paul McCartney.  Its more bluesy than I normally listen to, but its really great!  I especially like it from tracks 4 and on, but the first 3 are worthwhile as well.<br />If you're up for an adventure, definitely buy this CD!  It may not have been what I was expecting, but I absolutely LOVE it and can't wait until I see them in concert!
B000056K04|5.0|This is a great CD, although many Dave purists might disagree, I believe this is a wonderfully put together CD,  my favorite song, &quot;If I Had It All&quot; is a great example of the masterful lyric/song combo ability this band has shown throughout the years.  Buy this CD, you will not be disappointed.  Glen Ballard once again shows why he is one of the top record producers in the business.

B00003CX8I|5.0|We all must realize that had this movie flopped, it is possible that there would not have been a \\"Spiderman\\", \\"Daredevil\\", or the terrific-looking (at least from the previews) \\"X2\\".  While many comic fans are rejoicing that the future looks great for this type of picture, there had to be a tremendous amount of pressure to do it right.  After years of seeing substandard products, due to a combination of lack of special effects technology or Hollywood indifference, the folks at Marvel waited many years for the right time to put together exactly the right movie.  <br />After living with these characters for many years and having it firmly in my mind what they should look like, I can say that there could not have been a better job of casting.  Patrick Stewart was born to play Professor X.  Getting a actor of Ian McKellen's status for Magneto was a real coup.  Hugh Jackman gives the best performance in the highly desired role of Wolverine.  Who knew then that Halle Berry would become the second Oscar-winning actress in the cast (along with Anna Paquin)?  And who also knew then that Rebecca Romjin-Stammos would become arguably modeldom's hottest pin-up?<br />All these people were cast by others that knew the characters inside and out, and wanted the best product possible.  Like \\"Spiderman\\", there are very few changes to the \\"rules\\" of the characters, and anything done different (like ditching the familiar costumes) was done without harming a thing.  Watching it again is getting me really pumped up for the sequel.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Wow is all I have to say about the new Opeth. This album isn't like the others. Theres no heavy riffs, no death metal style screaming, no thirteen minute songs. Before you even begin to think to say sell out its not. This beautful masterpiece is just as amazing as their previous efforts, and like the editorial review said the emotion still comes out of this record without the screaming. I would talk about each song but i don't want to ruin the surprise. So all I will say is that this is already albume of the year so far.
B00008S2VH|4.0|Reading various reviews of Madonna's 10th album, &quot;American Life,&quot; I get the impression that her music is still the unspoken subject of purest debate.  We, the material obsessed public, have spent 20+ years discussing everything from Madonna's deceased mother to her bra size (after all, didnt she open the discussion?), while disregarding her truest of talents.  We have scrutinized her over-the-top behaviors, pulled the rug from underneath her after we invited her in, mocked misogynistic fun and basically discredited her every attempt at doing everything else besides what she obviously does best...making music!  These considerations explain the current &quot;is she really capable of making a decent record?&quot; critique.<br />Madonna has always been about making more than decent music.  This album is no different.  Yes, it isnt as dancy as many(including myself) wish.  Yes, it is glaringly reflective of where we stand in a politically charged, capitalist driven, war torn American culture, but most importantly, the album is about us...Americans!  Americans as confused, angered and sacrilegiously satisfied as Madonna herself.  <br />She, however, loses points for her hollow acoustical attempts, as well as her failure to get me into the groove.  The album is solemn, brokenly whole hearted and eagerly pessimistic.  Alternately, the euphoric melodies, telling vocals and synthesized serenity are nothing short of music from an album worthy of listening to again and again.<br />There is a certain self-fulfilling sadness though, yet she pulls it all together to give us what we want most- more!  The packaging should have been mirrored so that each customer, upon picking it up at Best Buy, could witness a reflection...a reflection of what it means to be Madonna, what it means to be!<br />&quot;American Life&quot; is truly an American experience!
0671027344|4.0|I usually pick up books that have to deal with a girl's teenage life.  I can always relate to these books and the events a girl goes through as a teenager.  My friend, whom I often exchange books with, told me to read The Perks of Being a Wallflower as soon as I can and that I would love it.  Well, the next day I picked up a copy and of course started reading it.  The one thing that made this book different from other books I have read is that it was from a teenage boy's perspective of high school.  This novel is written in letters to an anonymus person of an unknown age and gender.  Charlie, the writer of the short letters, is a freshman starting high school.  The letters share Charlie's deepest feelings about drugs, girls, mix tapes, and \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\".  Charlie makes his way into a group of friends, whom are all seniors.  They all agree that Charlie is a wallflower because he is shy, but has a very high intelligence level for his age.  I excitingly turned every page to find out what would happen next to Charlie and the people in his life.  I laughed and smiled with Charlie during times of his first kiss and first girlfriend.  I also cried with Charlie several times.  For example, when he took his sister to the hospital to get an abortion and he was the only one she had told. Charlie never really says why he started to write these letters, but it is clear to the reader that Charlie is a secretive person and it helps him to let out his feelings to someone that won't judge him.  Charlie's letters and new life experiences made this book one of the best and fastest I have ever read.  I was uanble to put the book down while reading it.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Kicking off with the title track, which did miserably, I'll do a short and accurate review of the album. The title track was critisized highly and was said to be her worst song. It is the worst song on the album, but the remix on the radio by Oakenfold is excellent. Next is the dancy Hollywood that reminds me off \\"Don't Tell Me.\\" Her girly voice goes great with the music. Next is I'm So Stupid which I'd say is pretty good. Love Profusion is beautiful with Mirwais doing the back vocals. Next comes along Nobody Knows Me with the tech-dance beat thumping. Excellent song. The touching Nothing Fails will move you and even bring you close to crying. Intervention is another good guitar song. X-Static Process is only Madonna and her guitar and is just a beautiful song. Mother and Father, one of my favorites(along with Nothing Fails and Nobody Knows Me), will make you dance.Die Another Day is a great song with it's hard techno beat. Finally, Easy Ride is a guitar-ish song and ends the album perfectly. My opinion, get the album! It's worth it.
B00000K19E|5.0|I never cease to be amazed at the idiots who think this is just another brainless romp through cyberspace.  It's pretty obvious that the story of \\"awakening\\" is symbolic of the awakenings found in other mythologies.  The scene with Neo waking up in the tank is such an archetypal \\"rebirth\\" experience that it's hard to imagine how so many people missed it.<br />There are a lot of philosophical elements tied into this film, as many other reviewers have noted.  But the most heartfelt parts of the film come not at the end, but at the beginning.  The feeling of alienation, that something is \\"not quite right\\" in the world, it all adds up to a commentary on the current twenty-something outlook on the world.<br />If you still haven't seen the Matrix, do so.
B000002OTL|4.0|What I really like about Pulp Fiction is the way the director used rock n' roll to set the tone and mood for each scene.  The thumping guitar licks really underscore the violence. What I don't like about the cd is that they left out Link Wray's 'Rumble' and 'Ace of Spades' - some of the best theme riffs of the movie.
B000002VJH|4.0|this is a pretty decent grateful dead album. it has a great beginning, starting off with help on the way/slipknot! a great jam song with a good rhythm. Next is Franklin's Tower, a song that feels the same as Sugar Magnolia from American Beauty but is better. the next three songs are alright, and are highlighted by The Music never Stopped. From here the album only goes downhill. The title song, \\"Blues for Allah\\" is really weird. Its just strange, and has no beat or instrumentals. All it does is have really bad and strange vocals. Blues for Allah doesnt deserve to be the title song, and the first two songs (maybe the first 6) are better. Overall this is still a pretty good Grateful Dead cd and worth buying.
B00005JLK1|3.0|For the past several years, the folks at Dark Castle productions have given us a horror film just in time for Halloween. First came House on Haunted Hill, then 13 Ghosts, and finally Ghost Ship. Rest assured that Ghost Ship is better than the absolutely wretched 13 Ghosts, but doesn't have the appeal of House on Haunted Hill.<br />Forty years ago, the Antonia Graza, a luxury liner, was lost at sea. We learn in the incredibly gory opening scene of Ghost Ship how the passengers and crew of the ship met their untimely deaths. Jump forward to the present day. A salvage team, led by Julianna Margulies (Tv's ER) and Gabriel Byrne (End of Days, Stigmata) stumble across the Antonia Graza while at sea. The crew boards the ship in hopes of striking it rich. The problem is, the ship is haunted by those that died forty years ago. In typical horror movie fashion, the crew is disposed of one by one in reverse order of celebrity status. <br />The acting isn't top notch, but it's not pure garbage either. It's refreshing to see Margulies in a role that doesn't involve taking blood and urine samples. Byrne, who is becoming a fixture in suspense, is good as usual. The rest of the cast is so-so, but it really doesn't matter, as they're just there to be bumped off in interesting ways.<br />The creepy visuals are truly the star of this picture. The opening scene will leave viewers wide-eyed. A steel cable flies across a dance floor, cutting everything (and everyone) in it's path in half. Later in the film, a grand ballroom, which is in shambles after forty years at sea, spontaneously reconstructs itself around a crew member. This is absolutely amazing to watch.<br />Overall, this is not a great movie in terms of dramatic content. It was panned by most critics, but in all actuality, there are worse ways to spend a dark and stormy night.<br />3.5 stars
B000002UAO|5.0|This album is ranked #6 as the All-Time Top Rock and Roll Album by VH1 behind \\"Revolver\\" (#1)...as well as 4 others. For me, the overall song quality on this album (UK version) is absolutely top notch and unsurpassed by any album. \\"Revolver\\" was more notable for its experimentation along with \\"Sergeant Pepper\\" while the White Album song virtuosity is remarkable...but this Album has no \\"bad\\" songs on it. It is for this reason I find it the BEATLES BEST ALBUM, like fine wine, this album just gets better with age because of the timeliness of the songs as a collective group. This is the last album John dominates (especially song quality) but Paul and to lesser extent George's contibutions are still noteworthy. Because most the album's songs I find of excellent or better quality, with a few just very good...here's my take on the songs.<br />1.) Drive My Car -- This is a collaboration song started by Paul with lots of input from John. It's a driving song that defines \\"Rock and Roll\\". The lyrics are fun with a tempo one can get into. John's contributions really helped make this song shine. \\"Excellent\\"<br />2.) Norwegian Wood -- Wow! This is one of my top 5 favorite Beatles songs. An acoustic song written by John...the melody is highly unique and powerful...an enduring song for that reason. I can never tire of this song for the images and feelings it invokes. The use of the Sitar by George and Paul's backing vocals are very nice touches. \\"Outstanding\\"<br />3.) You Won't See Me -- Nice song by Paul talking about the problems he was having with his then fiancee Jane Asher, it was later a hit by Ann Murray. Its enjoyable, but not as good as most others on this album. \\"Excellent\\"<br />4.) Nowhere Man -- Timeless Classic! Written by John...it has great vocal harmonies with a pulsating beat and tempo. The words are powerful and philisophical. John was in a self reflective mood writing this song, but the lyrics are one all of us can relate to. This song is one future generations will  be able to connect with. \\"Outstanding\\" <br />5.) Think For Yourself -- Written by George, he does a nice job with this song. The title says what it is about. The song is very good, but gets overshadowed by many others in this album. I find it a step toward his top songs he wrote in the future like \\"Taxman\\" on Revolver. \\"Very Good\\"<br />6.) The Word -- A exceptional song written primarily by John with help from Paul. It's a prelude to the \\"peace and love\\" movement that unfolds shortly after 1965. John's theme is LOVE which he writes lots of the next few years to great success on songs such as \\"All You Need Is Love\\". Great vocals with good piano and guitar work. \\"Excellent\\"<br />7.) Michelle -- A ballad that Paul wrote...and for which he is well known for. One of his better ballads, it has a fragile texture. An acoustic song with a touch of sadness with some French lyrics and style. My favortie Paul song on this album. \\"Excellent\\" <br />8.) What Goes On -- A song written by Ringo with lots of help from John and Paul and sung by Ringo. It's a country style song and is decent...not bad. \\"Very Good\\"<br />9.) Girl -- Another very powerful and unique song...written by John showing the creativity and strength of the Beatles voices as background as well as harmonies. John sings about his lament for a girl that projects images of desire and frustration. This treasure of a song is a rare blend of being original...with top quality structure and lyrics. \\"Excellent\\"<br />10.) I'm Looking Through You -- Paul song again talking in a very similar vein about Jane Asher. Nice arrangement, the vocals are too similar to his \\"You Won't See Me\\". Still a \\"Very Good\\" pop-style song...enhanced by tight musical instruments.<br />11.) In My Life -- ***TOP ROCK & ROLL SONG OF 20TH CENTURY*** As recently judged by legends of songwriters and musicians...I agree. Written again by John Lennon...the song is a picture of elegance and style. The lyrics say it all what life and our experiences areabout. Any human can relate to this song! The accompanied music, plus a nice piano interlude played by producer George Martin fit like a glove to the lyrics. I see this song just growing with time because of it's universal message. \\"Beyond Outstanding\\" <br />12.) Wait -- This song's major problem is it has to follow \\"In My Life\\". John is the primary composer here with some good touches from Paul. John excels again about pleading with his love to wait for him to return. The lyrics, to me, are his battle between the demands of his fame and his family. \\"Excellent\\"<br />13.) If I Needed Someone -- An exceptionally Good Song by George. The guitar work is nice...complementing each other. I view this as one of the stronger songs. \\"Excellent\\"<BR> <BR>14.) Run For Your Life -- John didn't like this song that much...maybe because it speaks of jealousy. I find the guitar riffs superb and despite the darker nature it is quite honest about a Man's thoughts when he a relationship and his securities are not right. \\"Excellent\\"<br />I feel fortunate to have grown up with the Beatles and the 60s...this album brings back the best of this time. I wouldn't be surprised if this album moves up on the list of top all-time Rock n' Roll Abums as the years go by.<br />Enjoy!
B000005RFQ|3.0|Listening to Sabbath for 26 years.  This marginal album was best enjoyed live, a super concert, one of the best heavy metal shows I saw.  BS has so much material, I recommend you take the group in phases and enjoy it all.  Ozzy material was the early days.  Dio brought a heavier, bluesy sound, Gillian a heavy version of Deep Purple. Party to all of them.  Heaven and Hell tour with Dio was a great concert.  I believe he did the Black and Blue tour with Blue Oyster Cult.  Branch out and check out Dio's work with Rainbow and solo, also Gillian with Deep Purple, especially later on the Perfect Strangers album.
B00005UKKF|1.0|Britney Spears' &quot;Live from Las Vegas&quot; is a true spectacle. Yes, Britney wows the audience with her dancing, special effects, and filmed sequences, but these are all things I've seen before in many, many shows. Britney does serve her purpose for going out there and putting on a big show, but hearing the backing tracks that play on her CDs in the background and her lipsynching is not very interesting. After a while you get tired of it. Then comes the ballad and Britney tries her hardest to make the audience believe that she is a real singer, but it comes off very forced and almost painful (I'm going by her facial expressions as she sings). I'm not trying to bash Britney Spears, but writhing around on the floor soaking wet is not my idea of a great show - we've seen all of this before from her and others, so it's nothing new and exciting. Like another reviewer stated, &quot;She has a lot to learn.&quot;
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is way better than Music. I thought Music had some nice tunes so thats why I bought it. But this new album is much more than that! very intimate lyrics, emotional songs but very rough at the same time. I have to add that I am not a pop/dance fan at all! I hardly listen to any pop charts song. I think they are all so banal. But Madonna somehow pulls it off! Yes its a pop/dance album but no its not banal. She manages to be way above her &quot;competitors&quot;. The songs all have nice tunes even if they have lots of fancy techno arrangements. I think its Madonna at her best. And pop/dance music finally at its best too.<br />P.s. the album could be previewed in its entirety on MTV web site before its release. I find this a great idea. I hope other artists will do the same.
B000002BSG|5.0|In my opinion, \\"Travelling Without Moving\\" is the best of jazz/funk/pop band, Jamiroquai's, work! Who can forget the infamous video for \\"Virtual Insanity\\" and the way you and your friends tried to figure out how they filmed it (even I was surprised by how simple the technique was)?!?<br />I was very impressed with Jamiroquai's music from the second I heard it. Having been a fan of similar music from the Brand New Heavies, Jamiroquai was a pleasant and welcomed surprise. It's unfortunate that it took three albums (along with a quirky video and lead singer) for the United States to take notice of this incredible band. Jay Kay's vocal abilities are wonderful. His voice can go from fun to loving to sensual very smoothly and effortlessly.<br />Needless to say, I quite enjoy this album!!!<br />Stand-out tracks:<br />Virtual Insanity<br />Cosmic Girl<br />Everyday<br />Alright<br />You Are My Love<br />If you want to hear some seriously good music and have a lot of fun while doing it, buy this CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is a film that people of all ages should be able to connect to. The story involves Chihiro, a young girl who ends up in the world of spirits. Spirits represent pretty much anything you can think of in life from plants like the Radish spirit to emotion such as the lonely No Face. Throughout the movie we see Chihiro grow from a self centered child to a more mature self. This movie shows this quite literally how if you don't know the means of basic survival, chances are the world is going to eat you up. It's the kind of messages kids need to get these days rather than thinking they're going to get a job from something like Spy Kids. Sure this film may be scary for some kids, but for the good majority it's a taste of reality with plenty of enjoyment to go with it.
B00005V1B2|5.0|This 1975 album is Camel's masterpiece, an instrumental concept album based on Paul Gallico's novella about two misfits who become friends during World War II while caring for an injured snow goose.  The band had hoped to have a spoken narrative over the music, but Gallico declined and the band was forced to add \\"Music Inspired by...\\" to the album title to avoid a copyright infringement suit.  <br />The music here was written by guitarist/flautist Andrew Latimer and keyboardist Pete Bardens.  A few songs have wordless vocals, but there are no lyrics.  Only about half of the album has a rock beat, but the album is excellent throughout.  \\"Rhayader\\", with a flute melody and synthesizer solo, \\"Rhayader Goes to Town\\", with a strong guitar solo and spooky keyboard interludes, \\"The Snow Goose\\" and \\"Flight of the Snow Goose\\" are all among Camel's best work ever.  An orchestra is used to good effect on a handful of tracks.  For example, \\"Friendship\\" is played by a windwood quartet, with a repeated bassoon triplet representing the goose's waddle.  The only weak moments are on \\"Preparation\\" and \\"Epitaph\\" (the intro and outro to \\"Dunkirk\\"), which repeat a 5/4 figure for a combined six minutes.  Other than that, the only thing I don't like on the album is the drum part on the title track (it accents a bass counterpoint instead of supporting the terrific main melody). <br />Several themes appear more than once during the CD.  \\"Fritha\\" is a happy, major key piece with an octave-sliding synthesizer melody; after Rhayader's death at Dunkirk, it is reprised in a minor key on grand piano as \\"Fritha Alone\\".  \\"The Snow Goose\\" and \\"Flight of the Snow Goose\\" are repeated with the orchestra as the grand finale \\"La Princesse Perdue\\".  \\"The Great Marsh\\" is a simple piece that slowly fades in to begin the album and fades out at the close.  In its use of instrumental music to tell a story, and its reprise of musical themes, \\"The Snow Goose\\" captures the feel of good classical music better thanalmost any rock album ever made.  <br />(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal)
B00006AG5N|4.0|I will start by saying that I was never a huge Elvis fan.  He some songs that I like very much.  Expecting some poor sounding, tinny tunes, I was greatly and pleasantly surprised at the sound quality.  The remastering has worked wonders on these old favorites.  I originally planned to listen to just my favorites (Are You Lonesome Tonight, Can't Help Falling In Love With You, It's Now Or Never) but I found myself listening to the whole disc and tapping my feet most all the time.  Though there are bigger fans of Elvis than myself, I'm thrilled to own this collection!
B000056H24|1.0|A classic example of overblown insensitive Hollywood biblical-epic filmaking. Unlike the sensitively told and awe-inspiring King Of Kings, TGSET is an overlong and unmoving experience for the viewer from start to finish, from it's corny cinematography (which makes the movie look like a Hallmark greeting card come to life) to it's unbelievably crass casting, including Pat Boone, Shelly Winters, and most notoriously John Wayne as a Roman soldier(&quot;this truly was the son of Gaawd!&quot;). Among all the hammy scenery-chewing acting, the only person to really shine is the wonderful Max Von Sydow who sensitively attempts to portray Jesus, though his Swedish accent kind of ruins everything. Film fans would be much better off buying King Of Kings or The Gospel According To Matthew.
B000068QVN|4.0|This captures Grand Funk at their primative beginnings...just before they began to noticibly polish their individual musical abilities.  The energy, honesty, and intensity of their performance cannot be denied...unless you are comatose and on a ventilator.  The performances on this CD are an interesting comparison to the BOSNIA CD which captures the energy of the live performance...with much more polish....30 years after The 1971 Tour.
B00005OAIE|1.0|&quot;I just can't wait for my ten year reunion, I'm gonna bust out on the double doors, and when I stand on these tables before you, you'll know what all this time was for.&quot; <br />John, get down off that table, get off that pedestal you put yourself on. This guy has been to waaaay too many Tony Robins seminars. Your body is a wonderland? I'm pretty sure he wrote that one for himself.
B00005ATQF|5.0|Most movies about Vietnam are sad stories that try to work as a metaphor for America's \\"loss of innocence.\\"  This is not one of these movies.  While the progression from raw recruits to hardened soldiers is certainly well-documented here, Kubrick really doesn't lay any judgment on the conflict or the combatants.  This is what makes this movie great.  There are no sobbing, overtly emotional scenes that many other movies have, just a progressive feeling of desensitization in the characters; first to their hard-driving drill sergeant, then to actual combat.  In the final scenes, when the true terror of Vietnam is revealed, the hardening the young men receives wins out.  This is the point that is made, but it is subtle and develops slowly, much to Kubrick's credit.<br />The other two movies that are the standard for Vietnam are Apocalypse now and Platoon.  The surreality of Apocalypse now and the emotion of Platoon are present in FMJ, just not to the degree seen in these films.  This movie stands as the middle ground between these two films, showing that Vietnam was a unique chapter in American conflict, but not pigeonholing it into a cliche.<br />Parts of this movie are out and out funny, especially the scenes with the Drill instructor.  Kubrick has a way of making you laugh at uncomfortable notions, as he did in Dr. Strangelove, and uses this sensibility to help the viewer understand that gallows humor is a part of what helps people get through stress in combat.<br />R. Lee Ermey (As Gunnery Sgt. Hartman) gives one of the greatest performances in a military role of any movie ever.  His brutal and profane, yet often hilarious, tirades make for a great first half of the movie, and really give life to the idea of \\"breaking down\\" recruits.  Matthew Modine is also very good, as one of the more idealistic young men who is shaped by Sgt. Hartman into a Marine who is \\"born to kill\\".  Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Pyle was chilling, as his descent into \\"A world of %&#$\\" portrayed the dark side of the breaking process.<br />This movie can be split into two distinct halves, which are seemingly unrelated except for the common characters.  The abrupt change isn't such a bad thing.  The move from boot camp to combat was abrupt, and this change gets that point across.<br />This is a fantastic film.  From the gung-ho soldier to the get-me-home soldier, this movie covers the range of the Vietnam conflict, and the young men who were sent to fight in it, without over-politicizing things.  Really a great movie to watch again and again.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna has once again made a remarkable album.  Similar in style to Ray Of Light with a mixture of Music - she elegantly and beautifully transcends through techno and rock with a jab of rap.  I wanted to play it over and over and over again.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Of all the things we associate with Madonna's career(fame, ambition, clothes, image make overs and controversy)the one thing thats consistent is her evolution and maturation as a musician. From 'MADONNA' to 'AMERICAN LIFE&quot; Madonna displays a knack for writing catchy danceable tunes to sweet tender ballads to songs which provoke and make listeners think. American Life is is no exception. One of Madonna's musical trademarks is sometimes her music is initially hard to get use to but after a few listens your hook. And with time her songs become classics which endure the test of time. Previewing this cd online is great(more artist should do this). All the songs are great even 'die another day'. I hear faint echos of LIKE A PRAYER and RAY OF LIGHT and MUSIC. Proof of Madonna's musical growth. Of the many tracks 'LOVE PROFUSION&quot;(a catchy hit single I hope) and 'X-STATIC PROCESS'(an instant classic) initially standout. I listen to all kinds of music, still Madonna the musician is always someone I enjoy listening to. BRAVO!<br />A long time fan
B000002U9E|5.0|Hounds of Love is one of my long-time favorites.  The CD contains a pleasurable mix of slow and energetic sounds.  I have had this CD for years and continue to listen to it.  I would highly recommend it.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I am a huge Madonna fan.  I ran out to get this as soon as I could.  Her music rocks! And this album is no exception!  A must for all Madonna fans!
B00008S2VG|5.0|I've been a fan since her first hit Holiday and bought every one of her cds - love all of them! This cd has great songs - I would recommend it especially to all those die-hard fans out there.  The songs would definitely grow on you.  Long live MADONNA!!!!!
B00005JLRT|4.0|This is quite possible the best Trek film since The Undiscovered Country.  If you enjoy the franchise then you will definately want to see this film.  I have been waiting for Star Trek to get back to dark and dramatic story telling and stop trying to be funny.  I'm glad they did it before they retired this crew.
B000005RNQ|5.0|As a 41 year old metal afficionado who 'grew up with hard rock/metal', I finally picked this one up on CD, after wearing out the LP and tape.  There are some truly great structured metal tunes on 'Denim and Leather', the title track being utterly classic and killer!  In fact, I would have bought the CD just on the strength of this one 'fist-pumping' song alone!  'Denim and Leather' has to be in everyone's Top 20 list of all time great classic metal!  It's that good.
B000089RVX|5.0|Make room in your music collection for this wonderful album. Evanescence not only rocks, but the vocals are so beautiful that they are almost haunting. You'll definately enjoy this album, no matter what type of music you like.
B000002HHB|4.0|In the mid 1990s when this came out, rock music was just beginning to go beyond gloomy grunge music, but pop music was suffering as much as ever (it still is).  While I enjoy rock of many eras, I find that it is difficult to find a good pop-based record the past 10 or 15 years.  This album was a shining light in the &quot;pop abyss&quot; when it came out.<br />Many will know the hits such as the mystical, spine-tingling smash &quot;Carnival&quot; and the pretty melodies of other hits &quot;Wonder&quot; and &quot;Jealousy&quot;.  However, I also recommend the sad beauty of &quot;Beloved Wife&quot;, the very slight twang of &quot;Cowboy Romance&quot;, or the expressive yet melancholy closing track &quot;Seven Years&quot;.  For sure, this is an album to chill out and relax to as opposed to rock or dance to.<br />I'll admit that for some rock fans this may be a bit of a drag, but for those like me who also long for quality, original pop (not an oxymoron, I hope), this still hits the spot after all these years.  An enjoyable, mellow, and musically talented offering.
0385504209|5.0|A gruesome murdur in the Louvre, hidden clues to an earth shattering secret, set the pace for a night long quest for Robert Langdon and Sophie, a symbologist and cryptographer respectively.  Langdon is being pursued as a suspect while Sophie is blamed as an accomplice in his escape.  And they must evade the police while desperately trying to solve a mystery of histrionic proportions.  Oh, I loved it.  A thorough mix of thrilling events, with calmer moments of historic and scientific explanations to some very esoteric subjects.<br />One naturally wanted to see everything wrapped up in a tight little package in the end, but the type of mind boggling material<br />presented was not a subject easily dispensed of. Far out fiction for sure, though Dan Brown made a real case for putting religious history into new perspective.  Well written, and easy to follow, (unlike some mystery/thrillers that can be confusing to the reader) this book deserves it's status on the best sellers lists.
B000002B30|4.0|If you want the best of Bruce, this is it. All of his big hits in one place, so no song-skipping here! As far as I know, the songs are the same versions as the originals. The song list includes harder to get Secret Garden and Philadelphia, too. The Rising was released after this CD, so those songs are not included.<br />The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me - there are 2-3 tracks that could have been dropped in favour for old-time favourites (like Growing Up or Rosalita) or perhaps a couple of live renditions.  But all-in-all this is a great greatest hits, whether you are buying for yourself or a friend.
B00008OLYN|4.0|We were told this album would be a change from the previous 6.  It does not have any death vocals or heavy guitar parts, but that is not to say this isn't great, and vintage Opeth.  Vintage because it is an album not unlike the \\"clean\\" songs on the other releases.  However, the writing is much stronger and the music flows seemlessly with an absolutely great production (courtesy of Steve Wilson).  Same somber, melancholic approach as before.  No true new elements to the music, except perhaps a mellatron, and keys in the background of a good number of the songs.  70's prog rock/pyschedelic reminscent of early Pink Floyd in my opinion.  No time for a truly in depth review here, but highly recommended to Opeth fans and those with an open mind.
B000000H57|5.0|As I wait for Type O's latest release this June (2003), I began to dig out the old stuff and set the mood.  If you're reading this review and this is your first foray into the world of Type O Negative, October Rust is like nothing you've heard before.  If you're progressing to October Rust from Bloody Kisses, this album is the perfection of the gloomier half of their previous works.<br />Classified by most as \\"goth\\", Type O truly sets their own agenda and doesn't fit into any particular category.  Self-described as The Drab Four, you'll find influences from The Beatles through Black Sabbath, and lyrics that focus on hate, hope, love, and loss.  The gloom is occasionally pierced by a wicked sense of humor and cover songs you would least expect, but their original lyrics remain true to reality and far from politically correct.<br />Of all the offerings presented by TON, October Rust is the sonic masterpiece.  Layer upon layer of highs and lows, between and within the songs, both musically and emotionally.  The opening anthem of self-doubt (Love You to Death) sets the mood for 80 minutes of orchestra-quality music.  Every song is a highlight unto itself, with twists and turns and a musical finesse that is unmatched in the metal or rock category.<br />This is not \\"get up and dance\\" rock, and certainly not moshing material. There is no thrash here.  No hint of Peter Steele's previous venture with Carnivore, or the early days of TON. While some critics hint that Type O lost their metal edge with Rust, they instead progressed into uncharted territory. There is imaginative, original music beautifully arranged and meant for your easy-chair.  <br />The follow-up to Rust, World Coming Down, is darker and gloomier and not nearly the musical accomplishment of this 1996 classic.  A fine listen on its own, it pales in comparison to the sonic benchmarks acheived on Rust.<br />Find the best headphones you own, and seclude yourself for a while with a candle, a bottle of blood-red wine, and October Rust.  And welcome to the world of TON.
B000089RVX|5.0|I bought this CD based on Bring Me to Life, and man was I impressed with the rest of the tracks.  I was expecting a female version of Linkin Park, but the only track that sounds like them is Bring Me to Life (the male vocal is done by Paul McCoy, who is not a member of Evanescence).  Most of the songs remind me of A Perfect Circle, with complex guitar and string arrangements and vocal layers (Amy Lee and Maynard James Keenan would actually make a fantastic vocal combination).  The themes are also similar: religion, temptation, loss, pain, death, damnation.<br />I almost didn't buy this CD because I heard it was Christian rock -- it is NOT!  I think the song that is giving people this impression is Tourniquet, but they are not listing to it clearly.  IMHO the song is actually about suicide and the possibility of salvation for somebody who commits such an action.  Near the end of the song Lee screams \\"I want to die!\\" in the background, and shortly after: \\"Christ, tourniquet, my suicide.\\"  Just because they use religious themes, that does not make them a \\"Christian rock\\" band.<br />Amy Lee's vocals are fantastic and she is incredibly HOT, as well.
B00005JLXE|2.0|3 things keep this from being a great movie.  1.  Daredevil DOES NOT KILL!  This is a violation of the very core of the character, who believes that the legal system must decide someone's fate.  2.  Matt fights Electra in a park in front of a crowd of people, openly displaying his \\"powers.\\"  3.  Speaking of powers, Daredevil only has heightened senses, not the ability to jump from a skyscraper and land feet-first without becoming the Human Accordion.  Whilie it's necessary to use a little tweaking of the story here and there when bringing a comic that's been running 20+ years to the big screen (see SpiderMan for an example of how to do it properly), the liberties taken with this character were too much.
B00008S2VH|4.0|I just got the new Madonna cd and I havent been able to stop listening to it. It is her second best, Ray of Light being her best and Music a close third best. This album, even more than Music, shows that she has become not only a great songwriter lyricist and amazing performer but a great musician and producer as well. Trust her to reinvent herself again and get it right on the money. Great choice with Mirwais as well. one of the best producers around, I suggest you pick up his solo album as well<BR>So ignore the critics who I think just like giving Maddie a hard time and never really critically look at any of her work, and pick up this album. you definitely will not be disappointed.
B000002A3T|5.0|AMAZING!!! <BR>That pretty much sums up the whole album. Gilmour out did himself on this one. The sonGs great and the lyrics are so amazing. Now this is pretty high praise from someone who is normally into Roger Waters. Dont get me wrong, I love both their styles. So good, I love this album. <br />P.S.<BR>   PLEASE GET BACK TOGETHER!!!
B00006JJ1O|1.0|Tatus first single which peaked into the Top 20 of the Hot 100 Billboard Singles Chart \\"All the Things She Said\\", was a nice piece of fluff pop, produced by the MTV Video Icon Trevor Horn.<br />However the album itself gets tiresome very quickly with high pitched vocals- which need the quick judging of Paula, Randy or Simon from American Idol, to tell them \\"They have some pitch problems\\", especially in the high drone of \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\", which I think unfortunately is their next single.<br />The album gets very tired with the same sound, same song scenario, everything starts to sound the same.  The only standout song in my opinion is \\"Clowns\\" with some good production, bridges and musical construction.<br />Otherwise TATU is a bust, gay or not...I think the gay issue is a ploy at publicity to sell a few albums, however MTV is not opening this with open arms, \\"All the Things She Said\\" though MTV tried to push it never did well at even breaking TRLs Top 10, ...<br />It just tells you people want good music, not girls making out in the rain with each other in a depressing video.<br />A definite miss,...TATU gets the Raspberry Award for worst Musical Group or Duo for 2003.
B00005JLO2|1.0|Oh dear! I bought this on the back of Kapur's fabulous \\"Elizabeth\\" which, although it also presented a revisionist view of history, was well-acted, well-scripted and fun to watch. This is a \\"politically-correct\\" version of the story:  the hero is not the white, Anglo-Saxon protestant Harry Faversham (as in the book) but the black Muslim who finds him in the desert (not in the book) who saves Harry on a monotonously regular basis.  The film fails on all levels: the accents are dodgy (Heath Ledger and Wes Bentley fail to convince), there is no real explanation of Harry's initial cowardice, and real men don't blub (at least, not in the Victorian era): Harry blubs a lot. Kate Hudson looks pretty but is not a well-rounded character: it is difficult to see why all the young men fall for her, still less explicable is her complete volte-face in her view of war and Harry's \\"cowardice\\". One moment she gives him a white feather, the next she is into bouts of \\"why didn't I stand by him\\" self-flagellation. Harry's father also  -  suddenly and inexplicably  -  switches from military martinet to cuddly daddy.  The film is bitty and unsatisfying: it is, however, beautifully shot. That alone, however, does not justify buying the DVD or even (to be brutally frank) two hours of your time - not even on a wet Sunday afternoon.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I have always enjoyed Madonna's music, however, this listening experience was different because it made me think.  Madonna's lyric writing is at it's best.  The album is similar to her previous album, &quot;Music&quot;, in the way it mixes electronic sounds and production with acoustic instruments such as guitars.  The album starts off with the first single &quot;American Life.&quot;  The song is great and introduces the theme of the album very well.  The rap towards the end came as a shock (not that that's bad).  I would have enjoyed seeing a video for the song, but I respect Madonna's decision to withold the video due to its content.  &quot;Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Love Profusion&quot; are my favorite songs on the album.  Overall the album is great, however, it is not as upbeat as some of her previous works.
B00008977N|3.0|I'm a big Peter Gabriel fan, and a fan of the Secret World CD - so I thought I would love this DVD.  I'm really quite disappointed, however.  I read the other reviews, and since I have an EXCELLENT sound system, the sound issues that are reported in some of the other reviews didn't discourage me.  It's not the quality of the sound that disappoints me most, it's the entire quality of the DVD (audio + video).<br />It's apparent to me that the concert video does not match the music very well.  It's almost like you're watching a video of the concert and listening to the Secret World music CD.  It's apparent that the 2 were not recorded in synch.  I'm not an over-critical person, but when I compare the quality of this DVD to The Eagles - Hell Freezes Over, or Elton John, Dave Mathews Band, etc. there is simply no comparison.  I'd love for Peter Gabriel to come out with a DVD that was recorded in concert - live (audio and video).  But for now, the reason I am giving this 3 stars is because I simply love the music.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Faceless is Godsmack's newest cd out. The songs are well done and show what a range Sully achieves with his voice. I love all the songs on the cd. They are all fresh songs with a tone all their own. I suggest you purchase the cd...you will not be sorry.
B000002UB3|5.0|What can I say about Abbey Road. Its my all time favourite Beatles album. The songs have never been better. They are much better doing what they are doing the songwriting is the best, the performance and the production is top notc and everything about Abbey Road is brilliant. Especially the cover. If any Beatle album should be named the best album ever then It should be Abbey Road. It is in my opinion one of the all time greatest albums and should be in every music fan collection.
B00005JLSE|2.0|All right I didn't get it.I mean it's about wemon who kill their husbands and or lovers.I did like some of the songs and some of the acting ,but over all I didn't like it.Though I like the sound track.I though the movie was way bad.
B00004X01U|2.0|Music is a fair album. It is not very good. The reason why is of course the production , the vocals and the lyrics. Madonna barely sings on this album and when she does she does not really puts anything in it. The lyrics are dumb and not very deep or anything special. Her voice is annoying and the album is a bit overproduced she mixes acoustic guitar with electronic music and is a good idea however poorly done. The album has few songs that are allright such as What It feels for a girl, Music, Dont Tell Me and Gone but the rest is just awful. I just heard her new single and I believe it is going to be a popular one however I think she should really be careful because indeed she may fall rock hard ( even though it hardly matters) because she has already reached the top but she is making terrible music and she is along with a lot of other musicians ruining the music business.
B00008S2VG|5.0|IM A HARDCORE MADONNA FAN, HAVE BEEN FROM THE START. THIS DISC IS A WORK OF ART. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST MUSIC SHE HAS PUT OUT IN YEARS. NOT SINCE HER EROTICA CD HAVE I BEEN SO CAPIVATED BY HER. DONT GET ME WRONG RAY OF LIGHT AND MUSIC WERE GOOD BUT THEY DONT COMPARE IN MY OPINION. THIS STORY OF AMERICAN LIFE IS HER LOOKING IN TH MIRROR AND SAYING \\"WHAT HAVE I DONE WITH MY LIFE AND DO I REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO SHOW FOR IT\\". STAND OUT TRACKS ARE HOLLYWOOD, IM SO STUPID, NOTHING FAILS, INTERVENTION AND MY FAVORITE MOTHER AND FATHER...THAT JOINT TAKES ME WAY BACK IN THE EIGHTIES. MUSICALLY I THINK THE CD IS MUCH MORE INVOLVED AND MUSICAL THAN \\"MUSIC\\" THERE IS MORE OF A STRUCTURE TO THE WRITING. I LUV IT..LUV IT LUV IT.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Many people are familiar with Die Another Day and American Life--recent radio hits.  The album gets A LOT better.  Hollywood gives you a smile with its Sheryl Crow summer fun feel.  I'm so stupid will get you dancing immediately.  Love Profusion, Intervention, and X-static Process are all beautifully written and Madonna gives an awesome performance (as expected).  Nothing Fails will give you chills and make your eyes water, while Madonna sings with a glorious sounding choir. If Nobody Knows Me or Mother and Father don't keep you dancing, SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH YOU.  She saves the best for last, as the syncopated orchestra puts you into funky closing in Easy Ride, which leaves you in awe and respect for Madonna's art.  I know it may be hard to believe, but this is the best Madonna album to date.  I recommend buying a couple.  Give some to friends--they'll thank you!
B00005NTJK|5.0|My review is on the un-remastered version of Benefit which is the one that I own.  For some reason, Amazon includes the same reviews for this album under both the remastered and unremastered CDs even though there is definitely a difference between the two.  Looking at the extra tracks on the remastered CD, I see no reason to spend my money on another copy of Benefit since I already have the bonus tracks on either Living in the Past or the 20th Anniversary boxed set.  From reading the other reviews, the \\"UK version\\" of \\"Teacher\\" isn't anything special either. Also, why is \\"Sossity\\" and \\"You're a Woman\\" listed as two separate tracks? I'll stay with my CD copy of Benefit, thank you.<br />Now, as to the album itself, after putting my top JT albums list together for Amazon, I decided that Benefit is my favorite Tull record.  I enjoy this one (and even Stand Up) even more than Aqualung. For the most part, Benefit is brilliant from start to finish. The only weakness is \\"To Cry You A Song\\", which is overly repetitive at times and, unfortunately, is the longest track on the album at 6:09. I tolerate that track, though, because the rest of the album is so awesome. \\"With You There To Help Me\\" hooked me right away. It is an innovative number which brilliantly balances the edge between art and noise. \\"Son\\" is a sarcastic, humorous track about a young man's estrangement from a stereotypical strict father (using all those fatherly clichés). One gets the idea of what Ian Anderson's relationship with his pop was like when listening to the angry lyrics. Every time I hear \\"Don't talk like that I'm you're old man\\" I have to chuckle. \\"Sossity; You're A Woman\\" is a soothing ending to the album. \\"Teacher\\" is probably the most well-known song from Benefit, being included on the US release and on M.U. The Best of Jethro Tull. Although it is one of the first tracks I ever heard from Tull and I love it, it is really in the middle of the pack in terms of the top songs on Benefit. My favoriteis \\"For Michael Collins, Jeffrey, and Me.\\" Certain parts of this song are too wonderful for words. If your Jethro Tull collection starts with Aqualung, make sure you get their earlier albums Stand Up and this brilliant work.  And, since you will probably be hooked on Tull's music and will be buying up their back catalog anyway, don't worry about getting the remastered CD, as you'll get the \\"bonus tracks\\" elsewhere.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Ok, this album has been out for 6 years now, but i still can't get enough of it. Unquestionably, this is radiohead's best to date and, in my opinion, is second to &quot;revolver&quot; on the all time album list.  If you want a record that will change your life, this is it.  Ok computer eloquently sums up what it is to live in times when technology slowly dumbs down feeling and emotion, encroaching on what it means to be human.  <br />Musically, Radiohead push the boundaries of rock music: taking, destroying, and rearranging some of the strongest songs in history.  Experimenting with new, unusual instruments, they neve stop exploring. <br />Still not convinced? Radiohead are the greatest band in the world today.  Listen to the climax of &quot;let down,&quot; if it doesn't nearly move you to tears, i defy you to prove that you have a soul.  In years to come, this album will start to receive the historical significance to which it is due.  It is quite possibly the single most important artistic statement of the last two decades.  Anyone and everyone should own it.
B00003CXBH|5.0|Great movie with fantastic script, editing, camera work, and a dynamic soundtrack by Enno Mariconne (yep, the same guy who composed Once Upon a Time in the West, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, and all those other spaghetti westerns). Let's not forget about the acting -- Robert Di Niro, Jeremy Irons, and a very young Liam Neison...My only criticism is that this DVD version was way overdue...But at last it is out...Don't miss it..
B00008S2VG|4.0|After putting my Die Another Day mp3 on heavy rotation for a few weeks, that song pretty much got on my nerves. The album would've stronger without it. The title track is a little awkward - Madonna is clearly not meant to rap. The actual singing in that song was lovely but wasn't very catchy. My favorite song on this was \\"Mother and Father\\" where her voice first has a childish quality to it that reflects to the subject of the song. After hearing, \\"There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ/There was a time I had a mother, it was nice,\\" it really sticks with you. <br />There were some songs definitely worth hearing on this album. Would've be nice if she'd released the original music video, though.
038572179X|4.0|Briony Tallis is a highly imaginative 13-year-old in the summer of 1935. She puts her imagination to work writing stories and plays and seeking out exciting and interesting things from her life to use in her stories. In her desperate need for some story-worthy excitement on which to base a story, Briony turns on her sisters love interest, Robbie Turner. Turning him into a violent maniacal murderer in her mind, she doesn't hesitate to accuse him of the rape of her 15-year-old cousin, even though she didn't clearly see the attacker. In the aftermath of her accusation, too young to give voice to any to any doubts she might have and too nave to realize the consequences of her actions, she tells the police what she's convinced she saw, forever changing the lives of herself and her family. The book is divided into four parts. The first part is devoted to character development, the rape, the accusation. The second part is five years later, during the war. Robbie is fighting in France and Briony's sister, Cecilia, is a nurse in London. The third part focuses on Briony and her own nurses training, as well as her struggle to come to grips with her past actions. The final part is many decades later, when Briony is in her 70s, reflecting on the past. I thought this was a very well-written book. Something about the author's writing style really clicked with me. The story dragged at times, and I wasn't entirely satisfied with the ending, but it was definitely worth reading.
0066620996|5.0|The principle premise of the book, Good to Great by Jim Collins, is that there are many companies and organizations that are satisfied being \\"good\\" who could be but never aspire to being \\"great\\".  Collins analyzes companies that have transformed themselves from good to great and concisely delivers his assessment of the characteristics that have made these companies so successful.<br />Jim Collins, a former faculty member at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business and recipient of their Distinguished Teaching Award wrote the bestselling management study \\"Built to Last\\" in the 1990's outlining how long-term sustained performance could be engineered into the DNA of an organization.  In his new book \\"Good to Great\\", Jim and his team of colleagues reveal their research findings on how to transform a mediocre or average company into a firm with sustained long-term performance.  The concepts and findings in this study are surprising and may even shock some people because they run contrary to many of the practices, myths and rituals of modern business.<br />Collins and his team researched a total population of 11 companies that had made the leap from \\"good\\" to \\"great\\" and carefully compared them to 17 benchmark companies that did not make the transition.  A good to great (G2G) company is a company with a history of stock price performance that beats the market by 300% over a consecutive 15+ year period following a previously sustained 10+ year period of average or below average stock performance.  After five years of research, Collins and his team identified seven key characteristics that any company can embrace to make the leap from \\"good to great\\".<br />The pause in our domestic and world economy has executives scrambling for new answers and competitive strategies; however, as this study shows, now more than ever, companies need to preserve their core values, stick to their core competencies and put the right people on the bus.  With recent corporate downsizing there is more underemployed talent than we've seen in over a decade, perhaps even back to the great depression.  The great companies of tomorrow are quietly scooping up the best talent and investing in their Hedgehog Concept, with the simple, unwavering understanding that they will prevail.  These companies have a vision of the future and it has not been changed by the rise and fall of the dot-com era; they are still moving forward, capturing top talent in a weak job market.  They are getting the right people in the right seats and figuring out how to be the very best in the world at what they do.<br />ThoughtForce can help you steer your company from \\"good to great\\" to \\"built to last\\" as you develop Level 5 leaders, hire the \\"right people\\", replace the \\"wrong people\\" and vigorously pursue your Hedgehog Concept.  We'll help you identify the characteristics of top performers, hire people passionate about your Hedgehog Concept and build a culture that makes people want to return each and every day.<br />ThoughtForce helps companies achieve competitive advantage through culture-aligned employment practices.
B00006LLOB|5.0|This deluxe edition of the London Howlin Wof sessions is unbelievable. Eric Claptn and Howlin Wolf working on over 13 tracks, with both original outakes and remastered recordings, makes this cd one of my favorites.
B000002I25|1.0|In the entire history of rock, I cannot think of any group more overrated and undermanned than the Doors.  A drummer with no bass player doesn't exactly set up a great rhythm section, and Robbie Krieger can't exactly carry the lead, rhythm and bass lines by himself.  The keyboard sounds get old after a while.<br />The passage of time has built this up to be cultish and great, but it never was. Please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
B000002GY9|5.0|I started my Tom Waits collection late in life - I picked up &quot;Alice&quot; when it came out.  Until then, I was only vaguely familiar with his work.  Listening to &quot;Alice&quot; I became hooked and started picking up other CDs.<br />I bought &quot;Small Change&quot; for &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; - a song I'd always loved.  I can't take it off the CD player now.  The whole thing is perfect - and it's hard for me to call any collection of music perfect.  It's Tom from back in his 'romantic vaudeville' days, when his songs were all about love and loss and everyday junk.  Later, he turned to the more carnival macabre feel - which is every bit as fantastic, but if you want essential Waits, this is the CD to get.  Get this and the soundtrack to &quot;One From the Heart.&quot;<br />Beautiful, beautiful stuff.
B000006TRV|5.0|How can anyone consider this album to be dark and depressing and not that good? The Wall is a great album which I believe is not dark and depressing at all. It actually makes me happy every time I listen to it and just gets me in a good mood. Unfortunately, the only songs I've ever heard from it on the radio are Comfortably Numb I believe two times and Young Lust, Hey You and Another Brick in the Wall Part 2 one time each. In fact besides those songs the only Floyd songs I've ever heard on the radio are Time at least 6 or 7 times, Wish You Were Here twice, Us and Them twice, and Brain Damage and Eclipse once. That's it. I just don't understand why people keep on saying Floyd songs are being constantly played on the radio, because I for one have been hearing them a lot more often lately, but still do not hear them as often as people have said. I don't believe any Pink Floyd song has been played to death. Anyway, The Wall truly is one of the best albums ever made. But please take the time to only listen to it in its entirety. This is the definitive concept album and tells such a remarkable story that songs out of the concept just do not sound good without the other songs to back them up. Long live The Wall!!!
B00004U8H4|5.0|there are no words to describe how good this film is. this film depicts 80s excess and insanity like ive never seen it before!christian bale gives a amazing performance as patrick bateman. patrick has everything going for him, he's young, rich and ceo of company and has it all but you would never know how crazy he was and what was really going on inside his head. the film is set in 1987 and patrick depicts everything about the rich yupies of that era. but theres a deeper side to the film you have to really watch it to know what im talking about. at first you think the guy is just crazy but he is a serial killer but as you watch the film and as it gets towards the end you have to ask yourself was he really a serial killer or is it only in his head? id recomend this film to anyone who loves the 80s or a good suspense movie or black comedy. this is 5 stars!
B00008PW3Q|4.0|As soon as I saw the ad for the upcoming tour on a local billboard, I started keeping my eyes peeled for the new album. I listened to it on VH1's &quot;Hear Music First&quot; initially then got my CD today.<br />My initial impression was that it was a little bit heavy on the Lindsey Buckingham &quot;mode&quot;, but a second listen-through has satisfied my ear's quest for the &quot;Mac sound&quot;. I do miss Christine McVie, especially for the way her voice blended with Stevie and Lindsey's, but while she penned many of my favorite Fleetwood Mac songs, I find plenty to like and even love on &quot;Say You Will&quot;.<br />Of Lindsey's main contributions, I favor &quot;Red Rover&quot;, &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot; and &quot;What's the World Coming To&quot;. Of Nicks', &quot;Illume (9-11)&quot;, &quot;Say You Will&quot;, &quot;Everbody Finds Out&quot; and the lush &quot;Goodbye Baby&quot;.<br />The only really sour note I can find on the album is &quot;Come,&quot; which I just keep skipping over after about 2 minutes. The song seems somewhat unbalanced, unsure of its direction, hard or soft, pop or hard rock. While some of the guitar-work in there is brilliant, the song drags. I prefer &quot;Murrow Turns Over in His Grave&quot; for the big bombastic type piece and especially like the way the chorus of &quot;Murrow&quot; sort of tumbles over itself, like a wheel going around and around.<br />What makes this album a Fleetwood Mac album and not just a Buckingham-Nicks collaboration is the solid underpinning provided by Mick Fleetwood and John McVie. There's just something about the way they lay in the percussion and bass that speaks Fleetwood Mac to me, though it's perhaps more subtle than in previous offerings by the band. Still, it's there especially on a second or third spinning of the album.<br />Overall, &quot;Say You Will&quot; is a worthy addition to the Fleetwood Mac catalogue, building on the band's previous work and showing the polish of time and experience.
B000066NW0|4.0|Out of the bland monotony of today's music a new artist is born, filled with freely expressed anger, annoyance, and a this-is-how-it-is look at life blended with the pride and innocence of youth-Avril Lavigne. Unlike Brit's sugary pop and the hard lyrics of Pink, this is a look at the real world through the eyes of an eighteen year old who knows how to express herself in words that ring true somewhere in all of us. Though the lyrics of &quot;Let Go&quot; can be repetitive at times (&quot;Mobile&quot;) and nonsensical in others (&quot;Tomorrow&quot;), Avril's expressive voice and highly enjoyable music just manages to balance it out. &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot; shows a wish to be recognized as an individual laced through with the honesty of youth, &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; is a believable tale of loss and triumph, and &quot;Complicated&quot; manages to be frustrated yet not angry, leaving you feel less violated by the rage of the singer than sympathizing with their plight. Overall, the lyrics, music, and voice of Avril Lavigne show skill and, in the future, mastery, of her chosen career. Some aspects of &quot;Let Go&quot; call out to be worked on, but others stand alone and to be admired. Avril's talent is new and refreshing-a breath of air in the sea of frightened record companies afraid to welcome talent such as hers.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Ever wondered why some former great performers just surrender to the &quot;soft rock&quot; or &quot;easy listening&quot; category without much respect for their former achievements - simply they lose the edge and any trace of creativity (think Rod Stewart today). Lucky for us we can count on artists like Clapton, Steely Dan and others like Fleetwood Mac that continue to make real music and not just trying to replicate their former success. Critics are saying this album is no Rumors; well you'll be glad to know that is the case in fact. This one adds, not just emulates. Excellent work, worth the wait. Christine, please come back.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Like a fine wine, Madonna gets so much better with age. I wasn't really a Madonna fan, until he last three albums. With each album I liked certian songs and I wished that she would expand on that style. Like &quot;Frozen&quot; I really liked that style, and I was hoping that she went more towards that sound than the &quot;Ray of Light&quot; sound. Which she did one &quot;Music&quot;. I think &quot;American Life&quot; is by far Madonna's best album. The beats are nice, and her voice goes well with them. Go check it out, even if you aren't a Madonna fan. You have to give her props because being 40 something, she is better now than in the 80s.
B00008S2VH|3.0|Well, here it is after many attempts to downloading the album via the web. I went and bought the CD on it's release day. All I can really say is that is okay. There is really nothing groundbreaking here. And I must warn the fans...the limited edition cd does not have a thing to merit the extra cash. I felt pretty dumb. <br />The title song is catchy but a little bit much once she broke into her rap. What is up with that? Your're forty-something Mo,<BR>please act like it. The lyrics in all the songs are as paper thin as her British Accent.<br />I know you are probably thinking I'm just jaded. But I do have all the albums, and this one is just recycled from the previous &quot;Music&quot; album.
B00003CXRM|5.0|What a wonderful film!  There is so much to enjoy - the acting, the lovely washed out colors, the beautiful locations, and especially the music.  I dare you not to sing along during the group sing of &quot;You Are My Sunshine.&quot;<br />I smiled and laughed through this entire movie.
B00008S2VG|5.0|As someone who is not a Madonna fan, I approached this album with caution.  I had heard the single on the radio and thought it was great, so I said \\"what the hell..\\"  I am so glad I did that...This album is incredible, and in my opinion is the album of the year so far.  Madonna's vocals are better than ever, and her political viewpoints, although strong, are presented in an appropriate manner.  \\"American Life,\\" the title track is very hypnotic and flashes back to her \\"Ray of Light\\" CD.  She even attempts rap!  Is there anything she can't do?  \\"Love Profusion\\", the current single, will be the big hit, but there is even more to come.  Madonna takes a jab at celebrity life in the satyrical \\"Hollywood,\\" only to realize later that she is one of those people that she is attacking.  \\"Nobody Knows Me,\\" the biographical single of the album...every Madonna album has one, although this one shows growth!  Overall this album gets an A+, and fans of \\"Die Another Day\\" won't be dissapointed, as Madonna has added that to her track listing.  Just when you thought it couldn't get better this year.  Cheers to Madonna's 20th Anniversary!
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Fleetwod Mac fans have been waiting for this for a long time and they won't be disapointed! Lindsey Buckingham's production is right on and full of surprises, his guitar playing is amazing. All his previous experimental work with FM and his solo albums is now paying off and it's the glu that holds this album together, not that the songs are not strong, they are the best songs FM has put together since Rumours. Stevie Nicks' songs are solid and her delivery is heartfelt and soulful. We do miss Christine McVie's input, her optimistic songs and beautiful voice being such an integral part of the classic lineup. But everybody picks up on that fact and do their best playing in over 20 years. A solid album and a great buy, even if you are not a Fleetwood Mac fan.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna has come a long way in her exciting career. As usual, she has manage to have the entire planet curious about her latest project-AMERICAN LIFE. This time around Madonna delivers what we are hoping for her musical life- to move forward. &amp; she has once again pulled it off! With a sound I have decided to now call &quot;Acoustic Dance&quot;, most of American Life is just that. Fun &amp; Funky with catchy but meaningful lyrics...this one gives the old fans a taste of &quot;Burning Up &amp; Think Of Me&quot; while the new generation of M fans receive their 3rd chapter (RayOfLight/Music being 1 &amp; 2) into the spitual side of Madonna...the ICON. 5 Stars
B00004RITP|5.0|The number of awards this CD won is impressive: a Grammy Award, Gramophone's Orchestral Award and Best CD of the Year, among others. One listen to the music reveals why: it is a perfect blend of musicianship and engineering skill. This is a beautiful performance of Mahler's Tenth Symphony (in the Deryck Cooke edition), certainly not an easy work to bring off well. The playing by the Berlin Philharmonic is beautifully phrased and wonderfully clear. Simon Rattle conducts with a great sense of feeling for this symphony. The emotional outbursts that Mahler wrote could be easily over emphasized but he maintains an even and steady pace throughout the symphony. Without a doubt, this is the finest recording of the Mahler Tenth, even surpassing Simon Rattle's recording from 1980 with the Bournemouth Symphony.
B0000026VF|5.0|PRISONERS IN PARADISE is Europe's best album ever. My copy has two<BR>bonus cuts not on the original. This is what bands like Poison should have aspired to, with technically brilliant singing and guitar work, plus boogie grooves to die for. It's too bad they broke up after releasing this one.

014028009X|5.0|In my short lifetime I have noticed many things about girls.  The largest, however, are our numerous insecurities.  We want our bodies toner, our breasts bigger, our hair straighter, our bad habits gone, and our status with males to be quite good.  These desires tend to grow as we get older.  None the less is more true in Bridget's life, a women who is probably the inventor of self esteem issues.  Women feel as if they can relate to Bridget's imperfections through their own \\"problems\\".  The reader does not have to feel shame from these imperfections because of the book's constant comedy that causes one to roar.  That is just one of the many reasons why women everywhere should read Bridget Jones Diary.   This book will surely make women feel as if the book was written about themselves.<BR>     Bridget, a 33 year old British women working at a publishing house, is starting off her New Year with a resolution, well more like a hundred of them.  She wants to lose seven pounds; stop obsessing over her boss, Daniel Cleaver; spend more money then she earns; stop smoking; drink less alcohol; and to go to the gym a few times a week(the list continues...).  Throughout the book at the beginning of each entry you are given insight on her progress.  The story begins with Bridget's trip for dinner with her relatives and friends who are keen on getting Bridget married.  She is introduced to the newly divorced lawyer Mark Darcy.  They do not exactly hit it off.  He is absolutely uninterested in Bridget and her loud, smoke inhaling self.  Once, back at home and back to work, Bridget is still falling for her boss.  Daniel and her begin dating and taking \\"mini breaks\\" all over England.  In many of  Daniel and Bridget's outings they run into Mark.  Bridget senses that Daniel and Mark know each other and do not get along.  Daniel tells her that they were roommates at Cambridge and ends the conversation there.  Bridget comes home after she goes to a party with her parents to find Daniel there with another women.  Devastated by the whole mess, she quits her job and starts work at a television station.  On her first assignment she fails miserably, but is given another chance to redeem herself by interviewing a lady who was on trial.  Bridget once again messes up her assignment.  She is buying cigarettes and sweets in a next door shop as the women comes out of the courthouse.  Luckily, Mark Darcy enters.   He tells her that he was representing the women, and that no reporters got interviews with her.  Mark agrees to allow Bridget to interview the his client.  Bridget begins to have feelings for Mark, and is starting to get over Daniel.  However, you will have to read the book to see if Bridget and Mark hook up, or if she gets back together with Daniel Cleaver.  <BR>     Throughout the entire story, Bridget's parents are struggling in their own relationship.  Each parent is constantly calling Bridget to tell her their side of the story.  Bridget's mom has found a new man named Julio and she has a new career.  Bridget's father is miserable after Bridget's mom leaves him for Julio.  Near the end of the book you learn the truth between Julio and Mrs. Jones life together.   If you think you can find out the ending through the watching the movie, it does not even follow the second half of the book at all.<BR>     Bridget is struggling throughout the story with her calorie intake, smoking addiction, and developing inner poise.  Many know how women go to the bathroom in groups.  This book is a fine example of  how true that statement is and how much women depend on their friends.  Bridget constantly calls her friends to get help with her problems with men, work, and life.   The end of the book ends on New Years day, you will have to see how many of her resolutions were met.<BR>     The character development in the books is obviously fantastic for the main characters.  The book is a diary so you learn all about Bridget and her personality, her problems, and herpartners.  However, I was often lost when it came to her close friends and family.  There seemed to be so many friends that I was lost on who was who.  Characters that were mentioned at a dinner in the beginning of the book would be brought back into the plot at the end of the book.  I found that was some what confusing but not enough to affect how much I enjoyed the book.  In a whole the book was extremely realistic.  It is down right hilarious through it's realism, especially the parts with her mother and Bridget's cooking skills.  However, the end with Julio I found a bit far fetched.  You will have to read it to see what I mean.  I thought the issues that developed within the book were very serious, yet Helen Fielding was able to make them light and humorous.  Fielding hit upon Bridget's weight during the scene where Bridget finds out about Daniel cheating on her.  I found it amusing yet saddening in one.<BR>     The comedy made the book.  Bridget's character was hilarious and her family was so much like mine it was scary.  I found myself often laughing out loud, hysterically.  I liked the book so much that I shared some of the story with my mother, who enjoyed the book as well.  Overall, this book would be best for a woman to read.  However, men would get some insight into a woman's mind and how much we worry. Either way both males and females would get a great laugh from Bridget Jones Diary.  I highly recommend this book, with five stars.
B000002KEV|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums. Ever. It all started with my dad putting in Deep Purple on the way to tahoe; three hours worth of blackmore improv-ing away. So i guess i'm a biased critic; i've grown up on this stuff. But at 17, I came back to it and listened to the album for what it was; it is amazing. Above and beyond the usual Deep Purple that gets radio play (mixed in somewhere with zeppelin and metallica and something new and random like sum41), there is jazz. There is something crazy goin on with the guitars and vocals...highway star is the best california driving song, child in time is breathtaking, if you listen through all of that strange kind of woman song, you will be pleasantly surprised. My favorite by far is lazy because that's exactly what it is; the nonchalance of it and the joking way in which they play it; it's awesome. Notice a little folksy guitar towards the end; it's as if blackmore is talking to you, telling some ridiculous joke.  Perhaps the only thing my dad and i can agree on.  Give it a try. If you're really listening, you'll love it.
6305313687|5.0|This is necessary. Whatever your beliefs, whatever your background, you will be able to find something of what you know and something of what you detest in this film. That is what keeps you simultaneously revolted and glued to your screen. I found this movie to be a sad awakening to the truth of our society, if not a morbid depiction of the racist aspect as a whole, then at least the unfortunate isolated case.  It flows like something between a documentary and a horrible drama; historical fiction for the next generation. If you don't mind a little bit of frustration, it is a small price to pay for the magnitude, power, and beauty of this sad film. Besides, real life rarely has a hollywood ending and this movie is far from being about escapism.
B000059Z8J|5.0|The special effects of this movie look somewhat dated. But it does not matter. Everytime I watch this movie I appreciate it more, mainly because of the acting. Everyone is just fantastic, especially Reeve. His Clark Kent/Superman performance is one of the best performances I've ever seen. Hackman is also in prime form. <br />And after watching this movie over the years with its washed-out colors and grainy look, the dvd picture, by contrast, looks FANTASTIC.<br />The other features on the dvd are just ok, but they do provide some interesting inside information.
B00008S2VG|5.0|What a long, bumpy ride it's been for Madonna. In the early 80's, many journalists felt she would be a \\"flash in the pan\\" compared to her then-contemporary, Cyndi Lauper. Since then, she has been panned for everything from calculated reinvention, pushing the sexual envelope, and most recently, for her \\"make love, not war\\" mantra. Even now, 20 years into what has arguably been one of the most successful music careers ever (behind perhaps Elvis and The Beatles), critics tend to focus less on her music than the pomp and circumstance that often comes with it. <br />In recent years, however, the music has been too good to miss -- the Grammy-winning electronica of \\"Ray of Light\\" and the techno-rock of \\"Music\\" earned her some of the best reviews of her career.<br />The evolution continues (as should the critical acclaim) with \\"American Life,\\" which quite frankly, could be her best album ever, because it marries the best synth-pop of her early 80's work with the best electro-rock from her last two albums. <br />Much in the same way \\"Ray of Light\\" evolved into \\"Music,\\" \\"AL\\" begins where \\"Music\\" left off. Several tracks begin with superb guitar playing, and juxtapose it with catchy synthesized beats. I was reminded of Madonna's first underground club hit \\"Everybody\\" more than once. <br />The title track is probably one of the weakest songs on the album, and while it accurately recounts Madonna's current state of mind (and the CD's emotional point of view), it is no indication of the excellent production or catchy beats and melodies that follow.<br />Second single \\"Hollywood,\\" \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" and \\"Mother & Father\\" are slam-dunks that could rival \\"Borderline\\" or \\"Lucky Star\\" any day. \\"Nothing Fails\\" seems destined to topple \\"Take A Bow\\" as her longest-running #1 hit if, as Madonna hopes, it is released as the album's third single. \\"Love Profusion\\" and \\"Intervention\\" are pure breaths of fresh air, and \\"X-static Process\\" is the most breathtaking lullaby you'll ever hear. On allthese tracks, Madonna's voice sounds better than ever (unless, of course, it was tweaked by a vocorder to give it a breath of superficiality, which was the point), and you're left wondering why anyone ever though she couldn't sing. <br />\\"American Life\\" is an album where it's hard to absolutely hate any one song; the best you'll be able to do is try to pick the one you like the least.  For me, it's \\"American Life,\\" which is why I strongly recommend that no one bases their perception of the album on that horribly-chosen first single.<br />And to all of you out there who thought Madonna's career was over when you were initially turned off by the title track, get ready for some serious egg on your face, like all the haters before you. After reading some of the harsh reviews of \\"American Life,\\" it's hard not to recall the \\"Erotica\\" days, when almost every journalist who wrote about the album thought it was a disaster and would surely end her career.  That was 1992. Two world tours later, she's still on top, and has since sold about 20 million CDs in the U.S. alone.<br />Realizing she is clearly here to stay, a recent reviewer likened her to a vampire, saying you simply can't kill her. Not only can't you kill her, but she's as alive and well as ever.
0385507755|5.0|Pat Conroy said it best. This book takes the reader through an incredible journey. Never before have I read a 400 page book in under two days. James Frey shows strength, humility, integrity, and tenderness throughout his accounts of drug abuse and recovery. I will never be able to experience what he felt during that time in his life but his writing brought me closer than I ever could have imagined (terrifying)...and that is a true gift.
B00008S2VG|4.0|AMERICAN LIFE is, in many ways, a culmination of the last decade of music for Madonna.  Sonically, the production is a refinement of Mirwais' work on MUSIC; the soundscapes are crisp and calm.  The sloppiness of MUSIC is replaced by an ordered, sometimes hymn-like simplicity.  The introspective lyrics seem almost childish on first listen, but the cut-and-paste rhymes only enhance the album's overarching theme of searching for a simpler existence centered around what Madonna thinks really matters: family, love, peace.  The album feels most akin to the tentative, melancholy BEDTIME STORIES, a work made on the cusp of the first stage of Madonna's movement away from her earlier brash (but brilliant) pop.  While there are no dynamite singles here - the album could use a &quot;Music&quot; or a &quot;Take a Bow&quot; - there is a coherence here that is rare on Madonna's records.  All said, it is a moving, mature work.  Highlights are the bouncy, puckery &quot;Hollywood&quot; and the exultant &quot;Nothing Fails.&quot;
B00008S2VG|5.0|No other pop star is making music of this quality. Madonna has never constructed songs which so thoroughly showcase and utilize her vocal instrument. This album is gorgeous in a pop-folk/new-wave sort-of way. It seems heavily driven by lovely, lovely guitar chords, strings, and soaring vocals (she has never sounded as full-voiced or mature). After my first listen, I was so overwhelmed by the quality of the songs that I was afraid to listen to any of the tracks again. However, I could not stay away, and the quality did not diminish on second listen. Granted, Madonna's lyrics have been referred to as a junior-high journal quality, and this album doesn't stray from the formula. Yet it still works. The singles, 'Die Another Day' and 'American Life', are really no indication for the idea or creative direction of this album. I think 'Hollywood' and 'Love Profusion' really distill the sound of this album--they are such strong pop songs. I have no idea what the critics will say or how the public will embrace this record. Regardless, I send Madonna lots of Love for creating an album of such beauty and for demonstrating the notion that people can do things in their forties that they would never have been capable of in their early twenties. I think Madonna has found her voice.
B000068W42|5.0|Since this is my first Queens CD, I didn't know what to expect.  What a refreshing move away from the mainstream shlock.  Although you'd be more apt to find music like BT, old Oingo Boingo, Devo or (my current fave) middle east flavored music, these guys make 'raw' sound far better than anything you would have expected.  Wanna drive at night on the open road w/ the sunroof open and the sound cranked?  These are the boys and this is the CD.  I can't wait to hear their other CDs.<br />Like a diverse music portfolio?Then Queens of the Stone Age's Songs for the Deaf belongs on your shelf.
0345448898|5.0|The Golden Compass by Phillip Pullman is one of the most amazing books that I have read in a long time. I was absolutely shocked and absorbed into this book and could not put it down. This book has many characteristics that could pull any reader into it. It has the elements of mystery, fiction, suspense, magic, supernatural, realism, and so much more. This book is not for a specific gender or type of reader and would be great to use in an upper elementary or middle school level. Because of the twists and the story line I think that even high school students and adults would enjoy this selection immensely. <BR>The way that this book was weaved is astonishing. It reminds me of the way that Stephen King weaves his books, or even John Grisham, or Tom Clancy. At the beginning of the story very little is known but there hints given here and there that make the reader want to continue and figure out what is going on. As the book proceeds the reader is dying to know and understand what is going on. Pieces are slowly added up, but the puzzle cannot be figured out until the last piece at the end is finally put in. When I read the end everything was finally put together and I completely understood what was going on. I was saddened but relieved at the same time. Then to only enhance the readers' suspense the books ends with a new beginning for a sequel. I have decided that I have to find the sequel and read it now or I won't be able to go on!
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Well I am not sure how much my review will help anyone due to the fact that I am madly in love with Stevie Nicks and may offer up a very bias opinion. The proof to the would be the only reason I give the album 4 out of 5 stars is that fact that there wasnt more Stevie.  Now I am not out to strip Lindsay of all credit. He is a wonderful artist. Something of a guitar god. But lyrically I cant get into him. But as in the past there are the few penned by Lindsay that I cant avoid. Peacekeeper being the first. It is just a good song and aided by Stevie it is great. Also note worthy are Come and Say Goodbye. Come has great range but being the Stevie fan I am I would have loved to hear her belt out the chours. But moving on to Stevie.... I love all the songs. I feel Lindsay is move experimental with her songs then his own which can be hard but I love them regardless. One of my favorites is Running Though The Garden. I love the lyrics and setting of the song. It would be great to hear a dance version like Planets of the Universe. Illume is are great track and I would agree that its dark tone makes it the Golddust Woman of today. Destiny Rules has great lyric as all of Stevie's songs. \\"That the spirits are ruthless with the paths the chose\\" Great line.  Thrown Down and Smile At You hold true to there demos as being great songs. Everybody Finds Out is a song to turn up and sing to, telling a story like so many Stevie songs. The title track has everything a pop songs needs, with great lyrics for Christine McVie. Silver Girl is another great story song,(I am think this is about Sheryl)and the last song of the album Goodbye Baby has that sad sad tone of Has Anyone Every Written Anything For You that I love to her her sing. So buy the album it is worth for the new or old, casual or devoted Fleetwood fan.
0688145078|5.0|When I was pregnant with my second child, we went searching for the best book available to help our son get ready to be a big brother. It was quite an eye-opening afternoon in the bookstore stacks -- we couldn't believe how many of the books in this genre were almost wholly negative, portraying new siblinghood as something that the older child was really going to hate. That definitely was not what we were looking for.<br />At last we found this little book, though, and it's perfect -- it covers some of the negatives of having a new sibling in the family, but its overall tone is positive and joyful, and at the same time matter-of-fact and realistic about what life with a new baby is like. Our son loves this book (we still read it now, even though his baby sister is 8 months old!), and other friends' children whom we've given it to love it, too.
0688163173|3.0|_Mystic River_, Dennis Lehane's previous book, is a modern classic. It is his best book and it should have won him an Edgar award in the year it was published. His Kenzie-Gennaro series is also very strong, with a couple of titles real stand-outs (_A Drink Before the War_ and _Darkness, Take My Hand_). Unfortunately, his new book just isn't in the same league.<br />Now, this is probably going to earn me a lot of &quot;unhelpful&quot; votes, but _Shutter Island_ just isn't that great a book, especially when you compare it to the work Lehane has done previously. The book reads like a screenplay, which perhaps it might have been. It has twists and turns galore, including one giant concluding twist that may leave readers saying &quot;Huh?&quot; I enjoyed the book and its very sad conclusion, but I just can't go along with the others who've said that this is or might be Lehane's best book. Compared to his usual flawless command of the dark heart of humanity, _Shutter Island_ has to be seen as little more than a trifle. Sure, you'll enjoy it, but I don't think the book will stay with you the way the more mature _Mystic River_ does. By all means, you should read this novel, especially if you're a Dennis Lehane fan, but don't feel like you have to rush right out and get it now.
B00008RH3L|5.0|A rich, complex masterpiece of a movie.  Like a fine old tapestry, the overall effect is wonderful to behold; then you begin to examine it closely, and the artistry involved in each thread and every weave becomes dazzlingly apparent.  This is a movie that commands your complete attention as it unfolds; immediately begins to haunt you when it ends; and then continues to beckon to you for another viewing.<br />The script is labyrinthine, centering around Tom Regan (Gabriel Byrne) as he maneuvers among competing factions of the mob (Albert Finney, Jon Polito, and others) during the Prohibition era.  Mystery builds as one double cross piles on top of another while unexpected twists and turns complicate the puzzle.  The viewer is kept entertainingly off-balance throughout.  Nothing is predictable; surprises abound; and yet, by the time the closing credits roll, everything is resolved in a way that makes perfect sense, with each character having remained true to himself (or herself) all along.<br />Characters this complex demand the most of the actors playing them, and happily, the entire cast of \\"Miller's Crossing\\" is uniformly superb.  Gabriel Byrne underplays beautifully, imbuing Tom with a supernatural calm that always seems just-this-close to erupting into something frightening and violent.  Albert Finney gives one of his finest performances as the gangster kingpin who is slowly beginning to lose control of both the rackets and the local politicians; the scene in which he senses invaders in his home and slowly but surely plans his escape strategy is brilliantly played.  John Turturro scores heavily as a conniving second-rate hood who wants to move into the big-time; and Marcia Gay Harden (always an underrated actress despite her eventual supporting actress Oscar win for \\"Pollock\\") is nothing short of perfection as his toughly protective - and confidently sexy - sister who can more than hold her own among the male denizens of this seedy underworld.<br />Add to this marvelous mix of script and cast some razor-sharp editing, a lush musical score, exquisite cinematography, and intelligent direction, and what you end up with is a film that begs to designated a genuine classic of the American cinema. For once 20th Century-Fox Home Video has done justice to one of their DVD releases.  This edition offers a sharp video transfer and clear audio.  The DVD also includes the Theatrical Trailer for this film and two other Coen Brothers offerings, \\"Barton Fink\\" and \\"Raising Arizona\\"; very insightful interview clips with Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden, and John Turturro on the making of the film; an unfortunately limited (and mediocre) stills gallery; and an audio commentary.  This is one you'll want to own and watched repeatedly; each viewing promises to expose additional layers of nuance and intrigue.rvelous mix of script and cast some razor-sharp editing, a lush musical score, exquisite cinematography, and intelligent direction, and what you end up with is a film that begs to designated a genuine classic of the American cinema.

B00007H1Y2|4.0|I waited a long time to write this review because from the first listen to this album till now I am compelled to compare this music to one of my favorite guitar slingers and every time I listen I can see Mr Brown twanging away at these tunes.  I am Speaking of Junior Brown.  The guitar work in this album is innovative and highly inventive, if not darn right outlandisly clever.  Muted plucks to add to a percussive effect, ala Junior Brown and even strums on the strings above the fretboard, then bending their strange twinkle using a wammy bar.  Manuel and Ry share an understanding of just how to break free of the pink stuccoed walls of this genre of music and with a bit of inventiveness and perhaps painful twisting have launched a great big pink flamingo pheonix from the ashes of salsa/merengue.  This is one great piece of music, from a blues guitar appreciator's point of view, and one that will keep you guessing &quot;just how did they do that?&quot;  I hope Junior has given this one an ear.  Good Job Ry and Manuel!!
B00005JKDR|5.0|I am an adult and I love this movie.  If you haven't seen it, you must!  I promise you won't be disappointed.
B00000F5KH|3.0|Montenegro is great in this movie. That said the movie is too cliche with the boudn between an adult and a little kid. We've seen many of these movies (Cinema Paradiso for example) for better Brazilian movies try &quot;Pixote&quot; or &quot;O que e isso companheiro&quot; (For days in September). For lighter fare try &quot;A Partilha&quot;
B0000640SA|5.0|This is one of those rare movies that you will instantly want to watch again after you see it the first time. The Special Edition contains many interesting pieces of additional material including a chronological presentation of the film on the second disc. The style of the packaging and menus enhance the experience as well. Watch it with friends and be prepared for the discussion that will follow. No DVD collection should be without this intricate and intelligent film.

B00008S2VG|4.0|I'm not sure what is next to come for Madonna and after listening her much anticipated album AMERICAN LIFE my question remains the same... Which Madonna do I prefer???<br />I think the album is good in general, but, it lacks that Madonna essence to it. The beats are there and will get you moving and s some of the instrumental arrangements to some of the songs are just superv, but, lyrically speaking... It's one of the weakest ever.<br />It's obvious that her inspiration now in days comes from being a mother, a wife, a yogi and all of those things, but, the thing is... what about the inspiration she once had and made her what she is... where is it??? Has it been lost in the process of becoming more down to earth and human rather than an icon or diva?<br />There are some few highlights on this album and is not American Life for sure cause to my point of view that track is one of the worst she's ever had. <br />The tracks, I'M SO STUPID ( I could have swear Sheryl Crowe wrote this song), NOTHING FAILS ( That was probably LIKE A PRAYER PART 2)and NOBODY KNOWS ME ( The best track of the entire album and single to come, Let's hope) are the songs and direcion she should have followed and make this album a more energetic one.<br />I wanted to get into the groove and feel my ray of light while finding my isla bonita, but the reality is that those days are way gone.<br />My advice to her is... get your self another producer for your next album. I really thought you once said... &quot; I dont like to repeat my self&quot;, so can someone explain me what happend here???
B00000255X|5.0|Since Desire has already been reviewed extensively, by others with apparently more time than me, I'll keep this brief.  Desire is the quintessential Dylan story album.  If you like his poetry, you'll love Desire.  I latched onto Isis and One More Cup of Coffee on the first listen and still love them.  Hurricane and Joey still leave me a bit flat.  Though they're both wonderfully descriptive (Joey especially) they're also too long for my tastes, and somehow not quite as magical as Dylan's other story tracks, for me anyway.  Romance in Durango has become my surprise favorite.  The melody, harmonies and lyrics were always nice.  It's recently occured to me though that it's a sequel of sorts to the Western folk favorite -- El Paso.  You know the one.  The narrator falls in love with a girl named Galena in Old El Paso, gets jealous, shoots a rival courter, runs off and eventually gets shot by the posse that follows.  In Romance in Durango, the narrator and Galena are on the run, treking on horseback to Durango to dance and wed, with posse in pursuit, hopes and desperation high, and tragedy inevitable.<br />Just one more reason to buy this album (and the Bootleg collection).<br />Ta-ta,
B00008S2VG|4.0|It's been what seems like an eternity since Madonna released her last studio album MUSIC in the fall of 2000, but now she's back. In between MUSIC and AMERICAN LIFE we had her 2nd compilation GHV2 in 2001 and then her track from the latest James Bond of the same name, DIE ANOTHER DAY, which also makes an appearance on this album. So one would wonder, what direction her music would take, since it seems she is the ever changing chameleon of music.<br />So here it is AMERICAN LIFE. The first single was met with controversy surrounding the video, which was canned then later re-edited. I can honestly say I think the title track is one of the weaker of the albums, which isn't a bad thing necessarily. I don't enjoy the rap in the song. I also wish \\"Die Another Day\\" was not included, since it was already a big hit back in the last quarter of 2002 and any fan who owns the maxi single owns the song. Lyrically, the album takes a more symplistic and direct approach. But those are small complaints.<br />Now onto the good stuff. Once again she works with Mirwais, like it or hate it, personally I wish she hadn't but the material still works. There's some truly inspiring moments on AMERICAN LIFE. \\"Nothing Fails\\" is a beautiful song with acoustics, met by a gospel choir. \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" is a nice electronica piece, with textured beats and interesting vocals. \\"Mother and Father\\" is one of my favorites, her vocals are a bit high but the song itself works extremely well. \\"Love Profusion\\" starts out very acoustic then works into an electronica number. The closer, \\"Easy Ride\\", is a nice track to end the album with, it has a lot of orchestra surrounding it and it works very well as an album closer. Other favorites on the album include: \\"Intervention\\", \\"I'm So Stupid\\", and \\"X-Static Process\\".<br />Overall, I think this album is a grower. You might not like it at first, you might love it. Who knows. It has a unique vibe to it, and it's great to hear Madonna once again. It seems she is evaluating her life and what makes her tick on this album.luating her life and what makes her tick on this album.
B000001EYW|5.0|There are 2 songs on this album that I like. The title track \\"Alone\\" and \\"Closer than Close\\" which I always love Maurice when he sings lead or solo and showcase there wonderful harmonies together. I am reediting my original review.  I should of gave this one a little more time and thought before I gave my review. I also like \\"I surrender\\" and \\"still waters\\".  I am now buying this CD in the future I already have it on cassette tape.  It is different from there other albums.  There songs are a little bit more mellow.  At first I wasn't into this album but listening to it more than once you appreciate there artistic style and uniqueness.  I would recommend you buy this album you won't be dissappointed.  Happy listening.
B000066C1N|5.0|OK, I saw the movie a thousand times and now I got the cd. I kept telling myself, \\"you love the songs on the movie so much you have to get the cd\\" so I did! I LOVE it! The songs are wonderful for the movie or just the songs! I it so cool, I think that everyone should have this cd!
B00008S2VG|5.0|I bought the album Yesterday, April 22, and I must say<BR>I was very pleased with American Life.  There is a big<BR>difference between \\"Music\\" and \\"American Life\\", for starters....<BR>The Beat, the beat is fast paced and basically makes you want<BR>to shake your groove.  However, she covers her voice with electronics for some songs, which I personally love her voice without electronics. This doesn't make this album bad, she uses a good variety of guitar and makes each song unique and worthy to buy.  Good job once again Madonna. \\"Applause\\"!!!
B00008PW3Q|1.0|I know how hard it is for a band to release a record 20 years after their first big hit; they can never get out from under the shadow of their earier work.  But it was with high hopes that I picked up the new Fleetwood Mac CD, being a huge fan from the 70's.  I couldn't have been more dissapointed.  Most of these songs sound like bizare, drug-induced, self-indulgent nonsense, rather than the clever and unique earlier pieces.  The magic is gone and all that's left is a little mis-directed talent of a handful of musicians that have completly lost touch with their audience.  Like another reviewer, I'm going to throw this one away, pull out Rumours, and try to forget I ever hear this piece of garbage.<br />Stevie, Lindsey, next time listen to your earlier works before you head back into the recording studio.  Do your fans a big favor.
B00008973Q|3.0|Yes, the movie is a masterpiece, though it is only loosely based on King Lear.  There is no Edmund, no Edgar, no Gloucester, and the \\"king\\" Hidetora's tragedy stems in part from his past murders and cruelties, and not, like Lear's, from mere pride, stubborness and anger. The older Fox-Lorber DVD has somewhat washed-out color and framing problems. But at least on my equipment this Masterworks DVD has color that is too bright, with bleeding, sparkling, strobing, and a generally very \\"hot\\" image, not at all film-like. The disc does look great on my  laptop computer's LCD screen, but a small screen is not how one wants to watch an epic. Buy this DVD if you don't already have the Fox-Lorber version, but don't spend the money just to replace the Fox-Lorber; this isn't enough of an improvement.  Addendum Jan. 2006:  There is now a third version of Ran, this one put out by the Criterion Collection.  The image quality on the Criterion is better by far than on Masterworks or Fox-Lorber.
B000001F3C|3.0|Take a long, hard look at this album. It is called simply \\"War\\". Its cover is a black-and-white close-up of a young boy's face. His eyes are furious, his lips bruised, his arms twisted behind his head as though he is being arrested or lined up to be shot. His gaze confronts you dead-on: haunted, violated, yet utterly defiant. This could be an image torn from a headline about Palestine, Bosnia, Ulster. Its stark power reminds you of the cover of Rage Against the Machine's debut, or any of a hundred punk albums. Just imagine its impact in the days of 12\\" vinyl.<br />You put the CD on, expecting music just as ragged, explosive, and enraged. Or, at the very least, as tensile and crisp as U2's previous albums. And what do you hear?<br />Probably not what star producer Steve Lillywhite heard when U2 first played this material for him. I envy him the experience, just as I envy the Asiatics who first crossed the Prehistoric ice-bridge over the Bering Strait to the New World. Imagine the floral sweetness of its air, the purity of its rivers and springs, the untamed glory of its terrain. Buried in the stinking, toxic, prefab hellhole America is fast becoming you can still catch glimpses (between plumes of diesel smoke and video billboards) of the virile beauty of that vanished land.<br />Similarly, under Lillywhite's mincing female choirs and saccharine orchestral swill you can sense the crack songwriting and killer riffs of a great album. What happened? Did Steve have a little chat with the boys about unit shifting: \\"Here, lads, Celtic fervor is all well and good, but if we want to crack America we're going to have to go with the whole poncey, overcooked Britpop thing....\\" It's not just that he diluted their power to the consistency of Harp Export; he also amputated their originality in favor of trendy mush-rock. (Notice that the only track with any raw force to it, \\"The Refugee\\", was produced by Bill Whelan.) For every bracing gem like \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" there's a swamp-creature like \\"Surrender\\" or \\"Red Light\\" with backing tracks slathered on with a trowel and tarted up with a big, pink powder-puff. \\"Drowning Man\\" is right; that's what the whole album should've been called. And man oh man, does it ever sound dated now....<br />None of this would matter so much, but the album's pencil-necked production turns its theme (or, rather, Crusade) into a joke. How are we supposed to believe anything these bleating popmeisters have to say about the harshness of conflict? The irony is that the band *is* passionate, *is* sincere, and is completely right about warfare, nationalism, the nuclear arms race, all of it. It's just that with these lyrics and this sound, you don't want to give a toss.<br />Ads for this disk in 1983 exhorted us to \\"Join the war against boring music.\\" Many underground songs of the time were like turbid roller-coaster rides; \\"War\\" feels more like being smothered in damp, rose-scented hankies.

B00004X01U|4.0|This was definitely a good album, but I'll admit I was slightly disappointed.  After Ray of Light I expected to hear more personal and thought-provoking work and Music does not deliver that except for the song &quot;Gone.&quot;  However, I'll admit it was good to hear the old Madonna back again and see the old Madonna in the videos for this album.  &quot;Music&quot; is a great song for dancing and &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; has spectacular lyrics.   A good one for Madonna, but Ray of Light still tops it.
B000000H57|5.0|While this isn't as good as the god-like &quot;Bloody Kisses&quot; this definitely serves as a great follow up to that album. This album isn't quite as heavy as &quot;Bloody Kisses&quot; but it doesn't catch on as easily as Bloody Kisses does. The stand out tracks are &quot;My Girlfriend's Girlfriend&quot;, &quot;Wolf Moon&quot;, and &quot;Red Water (Christmas Mourn)&quot;. Every song on this album definitely lives up to the Type O Negative legacy, but it's safe to say that Peter Steele and the rest will never create an album as amazing as Bloody Kisses, although this comes close.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I wonder where Madonna will be in a few years when she is in her mid fifties? Hopefully she will be making great music like this. AMERICAN LIFE is the best of her techno inspired albums and her most personal to date. If you like great music and top production this is a great album. Especially if you have a 5.1 dolby stereo system. From the first song to the last this album is perfect and totally grooving!
B000000H6D|5.0|Very few albums come close to the masterpiece that is Type O Negative's \\"Bloody Kisses\\". Very few albums match the creativity, talent and depth the way this album does. This album kicks off with \\"Christian Woman\\" which is an amazing 8+ minute song that sets the stage for the rest of the album. \\"Black No. 1\\" is another excellent song, one of the best on the album, and it is a song that is hard to forget. The song \\"Kill all the White People\\" seems slightly out of place here, and is the worst song on the album. The next song is \\"Summer Breeze\\" which is followed up by \\"Set Me on Fire\\" and both songs are very good, moody songs. The song \\"We Hate Everyone\\" starts out similar to \\"Kill all the White People\\" but turns into one of the best songs on the album about two minutes in. The song \\"Bloody Kisses\\" is a 5 star song that is pure depressing, goth metal. The song \\"Too Late:Frozen\\" is another good song, that keeps the album moving. \\"Blood & Fire\\" is a very excellent song and \\"Can't Lose You\\" serves as a good ending to an excellent album. To sum up, this is simply one of the greatest works of music to ever be created and you are missing out if you have never heard it.
B00008S2VG|5.0|So, this is her 9th full studio release in twenty years.  Madonna has proven to be like a fine bottle of wine (improving with age).  Really she has!!  I can remember back in the eighties, seeing &quot;Luck Star&quot; for the first time.  I thought she was so cool.  You know what?  She still is cool.  I'm gonna catch flack(?) for saying this, but this is her best cd in years.  This is better than &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (yes, that's what I said Ray of Light).  RoL was a good cd ( a very good cd), there were just moments I couldn't get in tune with either musically or lyrically.  I would skip songs on it.  I am glad to say I don't do that with this new cd &quot;American Life&quot;.  Lyrically and musically it's amazing to hear this woman do what she does best...make music.  It's got a nice sound to it (acoustic guitar and minimal beats).  Lyrically she continues to bare her soul and her past.  The woman has got it going on!!  How many artists can still sell millions of copies and garner critical raves after two decades of being in the business?  Not that many.  &quot;American Life&quot; is brilliant from beginning to end.  Some highlights are Love Profusion, Nobody Knows Me, Nothing Fails, Intervention, Mother and Father, X-Static Process and Easy Ride.  There really are that many very good songs on it.  You can diss her but never dismiss her.  She has been around for a while and she won't be going away anytime soon.  I could go on and on, but I won't because I want you to buy the cd now.  What are you waiting for?  Trust me you'll like it.

Jack White is a gifted performer &amp; I highly recommend the band's live show, but on this record it seems that he's reached the end of his creativity, particularly in regard to production. The White Stripes need a real record producer in order to find a new direction.
B00008S2VG|4.0|This cd is not what everyone is going to be expecting.  Madonna drifts away from her usual (if anything she does can be usual)pattern of music-making on this album.  There are only a few songs with very stong beats that could pass for radio hits (American Life, Hollywood, I'm so stupid).  The rest of the songs, besides Die Another Day, lend themselves to the acoustic Madonna with some funky electronica beats that made Music such a smash.  Overall it's a nice listen, but not something to play at your next party to get things started.  I was a little disappointed initially, but I'm starting to come around to it the more I listen to it.  With all that said, this cd is a must have for Madonna fans. Happy listening...
B00008AOS5|4.0|Anticipation for Red Dragon was huge following the success of Silence Of The Lambs, although anticipation to slate it was also there with the mis-step that was Hannibal.  However, by assembling the kind of impressive cast that would seem to be more at home in a Tarantino or PT Anderson picture, people were prepared to give it a chance.  Based on Thomas Harris' book of the same name that wipes over previous adaptation Manhunter with a much more glossy reinterpretation of Lecter's capture and the man behind it, Will Graham.<br />That's it for story really, with the old 'cop coming out of retirement for one last job' trick being pulled again.  Edward Norton, actor of a generation to anyone who's seen his performances in American History X, Fight Club or Primal Fear, is handed a dull part in Will Graham.  Whereas the novel and first adaptation Manhunter focused much more on this character, describing how the job was slowly destroying him, Red Dragon's script barely allows for such character development.  Norton does the best with the slight material handed to him, as does Harvey Keitel, but unfortunately (and for the first time ever) both fail to make much of an impression.  Anthony Hopkins has appropriately toned down his over-the-top performance from Hannibal here, and thankfully directot Brett Ratner chooses not to overuse the character as was the case in the latter.  Still, though his performance is good, you can't help but look at his scenes with Norton alongside those he shared with Foster and the chemistry just isn't there.  Despite these set of almost disappointing appearances though Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson are wonderful.  Perhaps surprisingly given how well he's fared in epics such as The English Patient and Sunshine, in a supporting role Fiennes makes one of his most indelible impressions as The Tooth Fairy, the mass-murderer who uses Hannibal Lecter as his template.  Emily Watson also proves that she is amazingly versatile as the blind woman who Fiennes' character pursues in what turns out to be the best plotline the story has to offer.  Their nervous partnership is genuinely interesting and much better than the, albeit limited, blood and gore scenes.<br />The main problem that most critics seem to have had with Red Dragon is that it doesn't live up to Manhunter.  Whilst it's true that Manhunter is definitely the more intelligent effort, with Red Dragon reeking of a cash-in.  In addition, the almost grainy camera work is fooling no-one that this is a serious crime picture - it isn't.  Even so, it's all perfectly enjoyable whilst it's on screen, and whilst it might not be clever, insightful or as long-lasting as Silence Of The Lambs, it was definitely one of the more enjoyable blockbusters of last year and is by no means a shame to the Hannibal canon.
B00005JLEU|5.0|To begin with, it is a beautifully drawn movie, and beyond the visuals, the imagination in the design of the characters is dazzling. I strongly recommend the purchase of the DVD for the special features, and beyond that, so you have the option of watching it in subbed and dubbed. For children, the dubbing is better because they will be better able to appreciate it as well as the jokes that Disney has thrown in. But for any person who wants to enjoy the film as it was intended to be enjoyed (and keep in mind this was the BEST film in Japan ever, so Disney has no right changing it) It must be watched in subtitles. I understand Japanese so I was able to check if the subtitles were accurate, and they were indeed. But the dubbing is not accurate. Japanese and English are such different languages that to get the lips to sync you have to change the dialogue entirely. Also, Disney altered the dialogue in some cases that is acutally changes the development of the characters. For example, in one case she says &quot;what should I do&quot; but in the dub it says &quot;where are you haku.&quot; Also, beyond anything, the voice of that little girl in the dub is so irritating. The girl chosen for the original sounds much better, more mature. To conclude this ramble, This movie deserves twice what it costs, and beyond that, is a treasure that only comes around once every decade. This is truly what animation should be, much like many of the older disney films.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Well you can definetly count on this CD being just as good if not better than the movie. The songs are all sung by the original cast members and they even have songs on there that weren't in the movie or inspired by the movie. To anyone looking for a little bit of differentt music in their life this is definetly the CD you want. This CD may make you think oh this music's too old for my taste, however i have found that it is appealing and enjoyable to all ages. Overall i would recommend that if you havent bought this CD already go and get it!
B00008S2VG|5.0|There are not many things that are certain in life.  Luckily for me Madonna's music is one of them.  She never disappoints and this CD is no exception.  She continues to grow musically and those with sense are taken along for the ride.  Thank you Madonna for one more CD that I can't do without.

It brought out strong emotions, and i admit that i cried though alot of it.<BR>NOW<BR>I agree that the first half was VERY good. Sebold had the reader, and you really felt for Susie.<BR>I HATE that her mother left the family<BR>I don't understand why her brother cussed so much<BR>and WHY didn't Harvey ever get caought? I was sincerely disa[pointed that he met his end with an ICICLE!!!!!!!!!!! he should have died kicking!!!! the family should have gotten compensation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! After all her father went through, don't you think they should have caught the killer?!?!?!?!?!!?<BR>Oh, and i'd have liked to have known more about the other victems. What were they like? and HOW DID Holly die?<BR>Remember, this from someone who Loved the book<BR>(wouldn't read it again though, it hurt to much. then again, i'm definitaly a crier)
B0000009RX|5.0|BILLY MUNDI is the man's name.<br />His sound is perfect, his execution of what may be Zappa's written-out-for-all-I-know parts ideally drives these songs and those on the equally-impressive ABSOLUTELY FREE and KING KONG long version from UNCLE MEAT (a tour de force showcase of how a drummer can power/add to a song)....then came RHINOCEROS, also classic '60s desert isle fare!!<br />Some relevant Zappadjectives (circa WOIIFT$): funny, smart, experimental, unpredictable, audacious, genius!, fun, social-conscious, groundbreaking, virtuosic, the kind of record you can play nonstop for 2 weeks (I did when it came out)... <br />Enjoy-- it gets no better.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Wow! This was much different than I expected and I was pleasantly surprised. I must admit that I do miss Christine, but what a great album! &quot;Miranda&quot; stands out as my favorite song. I bought this a week ago and have listened to pretty much nothing else since. Love it!
0552546933|4.0|This was a really cute story. Basically, a bunch of rats, snacking on wizardly refuse, attain sentience. They also hook up with a sentient cat. They can all speak, learn, and chat with each other, and at the Cat's devious notion, dupe a \\"stupid looking kid\\" to play the role of a rat-piper, moving from city to city where the rats act up, the Piper comes in and clears the rats out, and they all get paid.<BR> <BR>This time, however, they've stumbled into a town where there's something really evil going on, and all the wisecracking cats, tapdancing rats, and stupid-looking kids in the world might just be in over their heads. <BR> <BR>Well written, with a bit of whimsy in nearly every chapter, this was my introduction to the Discworld series, and I dare say I'll be back. The wonderful observations from the rats point of view are fantastic (there's a great part where one of the rats is asked something along the lines of: \\"Do you know what animal swarms into a place, breeds terribly, spoils everything they can't use and wastes everything they can until there's nothing left?\\" and the rat says, \\"Sure. Humans.\\")<BR> <BR>The story gets a bit dark in places for a young reader, though a teen would probably get a laugh. And the mythology lover in me adores the play on the Pied Piper of Hamelin - like Orson Scott Card's \\"Enchantment\\" did for Sleeping Beauty, Pratchett did here for the Pied Piper of Hamelin.<BR> <BR>'Nathan

B00008H2LB|5.0|I got this album the day before it came out because I preordered it, and it rocked! Best buy of the summer, I gaurantee it! Hurry up and buy your copy of Meteora now! What are you waiting for??!! :)<br />ArtistSpongebob8 on LPST
B00008S2VG|4.0|AFTER PICKING UP AMERICAN LIFE I BEGAN TRACKING ALL 11 SONGS, SO FAR EACH SONG HAS STRONG LYRICAL CONTENT BUT THE SOUND IS KIND OF THIN.  I LIKE AMERICAN LIFE LYRICALLY AS WELL AS MOST OF THE MUSICAL MOMENTS THIS IS JUST A SIGN THAT MADONNA NEEDS 2 PLUG BACK IN THE ELECTRIC GUITAR LIKE SHE DID VIA RAY OF LIGHT.<BR>ALL IN ALL EACH SONG IS GOOD BUT I STILL CONSIDER RAY OF LIGHT HER MOST IMPRESSIVE ALBUM OF HER CAREER, EVEN THOU IT WAS BACK IN 98, U GOTTA CHECK OUT RAY OF LIGHT AND WATCH A POP ICON GROW UP AND PLUG IN THAT GREAT ELECTRIC SOUND.<br />  AMERICAN LIFE IS GOOD BUT NOT GREAT
B000002UUX|5.0|R.I.P has always been one of my fav. albums. It's a real masterpeice and a must-have for every metalhead. Dave Mustaine is God
6303471714|4.0|Great Video! This has really helped me shape up. In fact, I've had this video since the early 1990's and I bought a second copy here at Amazon because it was starting to wear out. The three work outs are great - especially during the winter when you can't bear to go outside to workout.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Slayer is one of speed gods of last 2 decades. They have many great releases but this one is extraordinary. This is the fastest and most aggressive stuff one can ever listen. This album is a mile stone in thrash metal history. All of you out there get this one a.s.a.p
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna's time spent living overseas seems to have given her a whole new perspective on life, love and America.   Every track on the album reflects Madonna's growing sense of purpose, as well as her constantly evolving pop/folk/synth sound.
0688163173|5.0|I first became a fan of Dennis Lehane with the Angela Gennaro/ Patrick Kenzie series.  With the publication of 'Mystic River' I was certain that I'd be disappointed but I was wrong. This week as I read 'Shutter Island' I doubted that Lehane could continue to impress me with his incredible writing skill.  I will never doubt again.<br />We are introduced to 'Shutter Island' by Dr. Lester Sheehan, a former psychiatrist at the facility, who in the twilight of his life is reminiscing about the four days in September of 1954 when U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels came to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando.  Rachel, an inmate of Ashcliffe Hospital for the criminally insane had escaped from the highly secure facility and was nowhere to be found on the island from which escape was thought to be impossible.  Teddy and his partner, Chuck Aule, are left with a cryptic message and many suspicions about what the doctors and staff at Ashcliffe might be hiding from the authorities.<br />In this well written and superbly crafted mystery the clues are there for us to solve, but I challenge anyone to solve this mystery before the final chapters. 'Shutter Island' is a must read for all mystery buffs.
0783228317|1.0|This movie was wierd but yet I couldn't stop watching it.  I don't know if I was waiting for it to get better, to see how much stranger it could be, or to see what the outcome was.  Was I drunk?  My daughter thought it was just great and was astonished when I told her I threw it away in the trash!  Johnny Depp and Antonio Del Toro were fairly okay in it. There was a lot of drug usage in the movie which I am unsure whether they were glorifying it or just showing how stupid people are on drugs.  But most people watching this movie who have had experiences with drugs probably can relate to their experiences and laugh. There are some funny moments but mostly it is just bizarre.  I sometimes wish I had not thrown it in the garbage.  I bought it at WalMart for [$$$] so it wasn't a great loss although I could have sold it here for something!  Watch it if you can find it really, really cheap.  Did Johnny Depp come up with the way he played his character?  He was like a penguin smoking a cigar.  Johnny Depp must regret having made this movie.  What was he thinking?  Who talked him into doing this movie? Was this a favor to a relative?  Gee.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Uhh, this is just so thight. No bad songz, HOT. Straight G-funk outta tha LBC. Best song: GIN AND JUICE....

B00008AY3L|3.0|Ben's talent isn't showcased as well as it could be on this CD. I got this one for an Easter present and i was a little dissapointed.  I prefer Ben's acoustic style more than his exploring &quot;funk&quot;.  The reggae inspired songs are alright.  I can also sense a bit of country.  Thats ok, if his fans expect an ever-changing Ben.  I think some fans like me would rather hear Ben's singing talent which he lacks on a few track.  I enjoy the music he makes wth just him and his acostic Weissenborn.  He's claimed before that he would stay close to the root of his music by staying with his guitar. But, on this record he adds many other instruments like keyboards and horns. My goal is to go one of his concerts because everyone tells me he is amazing in concert. i can only imagine. I still love him as much as I did before I bought this CD, but next time, he should stay truer to his fans and what we expect of him. If you really want a good CD and if you like liveones (Ben is supposedly incredible live), buy &quot;Live from Mars.&quot; It's a good Cd if you're just getting into the music. Enjoy.
B00008S2VG|5.0|many in the press have decided to slam this record because they want to destroy madonna. If you listen to what the critics have to say then you'll miss out on one of the most thrilling pieces of work created by an exceptional artist this year. This album combines the spirituality of \\"ray of light\\" and the groove of \\"music\\" into a mix bag of musical delicacy. Stand out tracks are basically every single song on this record. There is not one single song that you will skip. I bought this cd today and i still can't stop playing it. It's absolutely brilliant!!
B00008S2VG|4.0|At first listen, all of the songs on this track are instantly likable, which is a good sign.  It's the kind of album you can listen to over and over again.  There are some really intense love songs here and it's just Madonna and the guitar on songs like &quot;X-Static Process&quot;.  It's an extension of the sound she hinted at in songs like &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;, but now that style has fused into over 10 beautiful songs to produce a very cohesive, thematic album.<BR>If you haven't been a Madonna fan in the past, the songs on this collection aim at a Adult Contemporary audience (note: even my Mother noted how much prettier she sounded in some of the songs), and there are still those fun Madonna songs we will learn to love and sing along too (&quot;Mother and Father&quot;, &quot;Hollywood&quot;).  <BR>Anyone who purchases this album will enjoy it; it's a solid piece of work!
B00008S2VG|4.0|TRACKS:<BR>1. AMERICAN LIFE:  3 STARS:  NOTHING REALLY CATCHY HERE AND CERTAINLY NOT EASILY REMIXED.  BUT WHY MUST EVERY MADONNA SONG BE CLUB FRIENDLY?  MUSICALLY NOT ONE OF THE STRONGER TRACKS ON THE CD.<br />2. HOLLYWOOD:  4 STARS:  2ND SINGLE.  FUN SONG TO LISTEN TO ON A WARM DAY WITH THE WINDOWS DOWN.  SUMMER SINGLE OF 2003, CAN'T WAIT FOR THE REMIXES....WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THEY USE HER YELLING AT THE END \\"PUSH THE BUTTON, CHANGE THE CHANNEL!\\".<br />3. IM SO STUPID:  3 STARS: SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE A PUNK SONG. SELF DEPRECATING LYRICS MATCHED WITH A TYPICAL MIRWAIS' SYNTH LADEN TRACK WITH A NICE RHYTHM GUITAR DRIVING IT.<br />4. LOVE PROFUSION: 3 STARS:  SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING FROM \\"MUSIC\\".  COULD BE A SINGLE AS IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE ON RADIO.<br />5. NOBODY KNOWS ME: 4 STARS: WHAT A GREAT DANCE SONG! EVEN THE VOCODER EFFECTS SOUND COOL. BEST TRACK ON THE CD.<br />6. NOTHING FAILS: 4 STARS:  OH GUY MADONNA LOVES YOU SO.  GUITAR BALLAD AND A VERY MATURE, FULL SOUNDING VOCAL.  COULD BE A BIG BALLAD HIT FOR MAD.<br />7. INTERVENTIOIN: 3 STARS: ANOTHER BALLAD? HMMM..SOUNDS SIMILAR TO \\"NOTHING\\" BUT OK..SHE'S GOING FOR THE MELLOW HERE. <br />8. X-STATIC PROCESS: 3 STARS:  HI, MY NAME IS MADONNA \\"CAT\\" STEVENS.  MADONNA DOES FOLK HERE FOLKS..MIGHT BE A BIT TOO MUCH TO TAKE AFTER THE LAST 2 BALLADS.<br />9. MOTHER AND FATHER: 4 STARS:  4 STARS FOR THE LYRICS...SONICALLY SILLY SOUNDING AND ANOTHER RAP..WHAT'S UP WITH THE RAPPING MAD?<br />10. DIE ANOTHER DAY: 4 STARS:  HATED THIS SONG BEFORE..BUT FITS NICELY HERE, ESPECIALLY AS A RELIEF TO THE BALLAD OVERLOAD.  LONGER VERSION THAN ON THE RADIO AND THAT SERVES THE SONG BETTER.<br />11. EASY RIDE: NO RATING YET: I NEVER MAKE IT THIS FAR AS I IMMEDIATELY COULD TELL IT'S ANOTHER BALLAD...SUPPOSEDLY A GOOD SONG..WILL HAVE TO LISTEN TO IT SOON.
B00008S2VH|4.0|Okay, so I live in Hollywood... and the buzz goin around on this album was that it wasn't very good, that it was gonna be a flop... blah blah blah...   added with the whole pulling of the video for reshoots and re-edits, it seemed like this might be the first mis-step for madonna in over a decade.  ......<br />I just listened to the cd for the first time.  It's really good.  It's along the same lines as 'Music':  Acoustic guitar meets tweaky techno with lots of Mirwais' signature stuttering edits.  The lyrics however, feel a little more personal and specific, especially on 'mother and father' and 'nothing fails' and 'Ecstatic Process' - all excellent songs.  The cd has a very melancholy feel to it times too... some parts are really chilled-out, sad, and feels very personal.  Some of the songs remind me a lot of 'I deserve it' and 'Nobody's Perfect' from 'Music.'  Then there are some good upbeat (somewhat) tracks: 'American Life' 'Die Another Day' and 'Hollywood.'   All strong tracks with cool beats.  Overall its a good/great cd... nothing amazingly groundbreaking, but it won't disappoint.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Mac's back indeed...well almost!  Christine is missing and it does give the CD a more aggressive yet less soft feel to it.  Her songs on previous FM albums always balanced Stevie's growling and mysticism and Lindsey's \\"out there\\" experimentation.  Track #7 (should be track #2)\\"Say You Will\\" is sung by Stevie but sounds like it should be a Christine track. <br />I don't like the track sequencing. \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave\\" as the 2nd song?  Too much Lindsey craziness too early.  By the time you get to one of the more adventurous Stevie offerings \\"Everybody Finds Out\\" (great guitars plucking and production by Lindsey and a GREAT Stevie vocal), 15 tracks in, you are overwhelmed from the previous smorgasboard of songs. \\"Illume\\" sounds better suited for the 2nd 1/2 of the CD yet is song #3. <br />Lindsey is up to his usual gimmickry on his vocals and insrumentation (the weird sound in \\"Peacekeeper\\" chorus makes it almost embarrassing to play too loud!).  One of rocks more underrated guitarists, he absolutely RIPS on the last couple minutes of \\"Come\\"...sounds amazing when blasted REAL loud! I have never been a fan of Lindsey's over produced songs, but \\"Come\\" with it's awesome solo and the softer \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" both make up for that.<br />Stevie's voice goes from all out wail (\\"Running Through The Garden\\", \\"Everybody...\\") to whispery soft (\\"Goodbye Baby\\" in which her vocals are noticeably mic'd high and edited together).  She sounds 100% better here than in 87's \\"Tango In The Night\\" but not as good as on \\"The Dance\\". Lyrically she still is very adventurous, but not as personal as on her CD \\"Trouble In Shangrila\\".<br />Mick's drumming has NEVER sounded more alive and enthusiastic and John's bass moves all the songs along smoothly.<br />All in all this CD offers something for nearly everyone. If you like classic mid-tempo Stevie ballads try \\"Throwdown\\", if you like heavy duty classic rock try \\"Come\\", if you like psychedelia experimentation try \\"Murrow\\". If you want to get teary eyed try \\"Goodbye Baby\\".<br />Standout tracks after listening several times are the previously mentioned \\"Everybody Finds Out\\", \\"Throwdown\\"( very catchy chorus), \\"Come\\", \\"Say You Will\\", \\"Goodbye Baby\\", \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\".  CD would benefit from the ommission of \\"Silver Girl\\" and \\"Red Rover\\".<br />This CD has earned permanant space on my CD changer at least through the end of the summer. Glad Mac is back even if it is without the GREAT Christine McVie.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack's new album faceless is kind of a raprock mix with a hint of jazz and blues I particularly like that the track disgustipated in the house of worms made me cry and I told my friend I like this cd because it is neat and I like it and it makes me happy and I like it because it is cool and my friend laughed and bought me a beer.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|FM offers something for everyone here.  Christine is not on this one and it's a shame as Lindsey and Stevie tend to get overwhelming after a few songs without Christine's balance.<br />Tracks:<br />1. What's The World Coming To\\":  4 1/2 stars: Lindsey sounds relaxed and natural here. A safe start ease fans back into a classic FM sound.<br />2. Murrow Turning Over In His Grave\\": 3 stars:  Why is this song #2?  Can't really understand what Lindsey is talking about in this and the guitars are amazing but a bit overwhelming so soon.<br />3. Illume: 3 1/2 stars:  About 9/11.  An acoustic, percussion driven song by Stevie.  It's ok, but definately not one of the CD's standouts by her.  Should be near end of CD.<br />4. Throwdown: 5 stars:  Classic stevie and Lindsey arrangement.  VERY memorable chrorus and great vocals from Stevie.  Should be a single. <br />5. Miranda: no rating:  I always skip this for some reason as I am not the biggest Lindsey Fan.  <br />6. Red Rover: 3 stars:  What is going on here?  Interesting production, but kind of a crazy song. Lindsey is starting to irritate me here! Christine...stop the madness!<br />7. Say You Will: 4 1/2 stars:  Sounds like it would belong on an early FM Cd. Stevie sounds ok in this but kind of whiny. Christine would send this one out of the ballpark.<br />8. Peacekeeper: 4 stars:  Memorable chorus, great lyrics, but for some reason kind of boring sounding (can't pinpoint it),  Stevie and Lindsey sound good harmonizing however. <br />9. Come: 5 stars: Typical Lindsey \\"start slow\\" track which builds up on the chorus and just let's loose near the end.  AMAZING guitar work..might just bring back \\"Air Guitar\\"!<br />10. Smile At You: 4 stars:  Haunting insrumentation and a GREAT almost sexy stevie vocal. Song has a very meloncholy feel to it.<br />11. Running Through The Garden:  4 stars:  This song has been listed as many reviewers fav song by Stevie on here.  Hyper track with another great guitar solo by Lindsey. VERY good lyrics here by Stevie.<br />12. Silver Girl:  2 1/2 stars:  Love ya Stevie but this one is a BORE.<br />13. Steal Your Heart Away: 4 1/2 stars: FINALLY Lindsey sounds HUMAN!  Classic Mac instrumentation and background vocals.<br />14. Bleed To Love Her: 5 stars: LOVE this song...better on \\"The Dance\\" but a great Lindsey track...probably his best on the CD.<br />15. Everybody Finds Out: 5 stars:  WHAT is this doing BURIED here?  This song features an AWESOME stevie vocal and some interesting production and guitar from Lindsey. SHOULD be in the first 1/3 of the CD, not relegated to the end.<br />16. Destiny Rules: 4 stars: Ehh..Stevie sounds a bit flat on this until the drums kick in.  Nothing special but enjoyable nonetheless.<br />17. Say Goodbye:  4 1/2 stars:  Lindsey is so dam hyper in his vocals!  Not a relaxed ballad but very frenetic.  Great guitar-work.<br />18. Goodbye Baby: 4 1/2 stars:  Stevie in her \\"baby\\" voice. Sounds scary at first but grows on you.  Would get 5 stars if her vocals weren't mixed to badly on this (listen to it loud and you will see..sounds like they used an old vocal that wasn't recorded loud enough). What a sweet song though!
B0000028RR|5.0|Back in 1993, this album sounded like nothing else, 10 years later it is still like a burning rod of radioactive material: stuff that refuses to grow cold... RATM's sound remains as distinctive as ever, the guitar of Tom Morello, the rapping and shouts of Zac de la Rocha, this &quot;fusion&quot; of rap and punk and metal guitars has spawned many imitators but none have got the right mix, I am not convinced RATM themselves were able to surpass the brilliance of their first album. There's only one Killing In The Name Of...
B00008S2VG|4.0|Madonna is so serious on this CD, but you wouldn't know it just lisenting to the music.  She surrounds serious subjects (to her anyway) with Mirwais' frantic techno, european beats, much like she did on \\"Ray Of Light\\" (her best CD by far) and \\"Music\\".  Good case in point is \\"Mother and Father\\"...lyrics describe her lack of a Mother, etc but the music is a dance beat.  She does the same on \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" which, sonically, is the best track on the CD. <br />The 2nd single \\"Hollywood\\" has a catchy, radio-friendly chorus, much better than \\"American Life\\" which is one of the weaker tracks here.  I like the last few lines about \\"Push the button, change the channel...\\".  It saves it from becoming standard pop fair. This will be the summer song of 2003.<br />Madonna's new found \\"rapping\\" (if you want to call it that) is repeated a couple times on various songs..wonder why? Maybe she wants to keep the theme consistent as well as the sounds.  There are a couple of stripped down ballad guitar tracks that sound similar (\\"Nothing Fails\\" and the 3rd single and \\"X-Static Process\\"). <br />All in all an enjoyable CD...very similar to \\"Music\\".  No, she hasn't lost her touch...if she did would any of her fans really notice anyway?  At this point Madonna can do no wrong in her fans ears.  <br />I would like to see her venture into more real instruments in the future..maybe an actual band backing her.

B00008S2VG|5.0|In April of 2003, Madonna released her fourteenth album entitled, AMERICAN LIFE. This album shows Madonna still taking up a techno-futuristic sound, but again, she gave that techno-futuristic sound an upgrade: Futuristic-techno sound with an Army influenced ROCK twist, where Madonna had transformed herself from a MATERIAL GIRL to a MILITARY GIRL. This album features the futuristic-techno sound with an Army influenced ROCK sound, for Madonna says that she was very agitated with what was going on in her life at this time, with the war starting in Iraq, and all this hatred just going on around the world. So, the result of this album features some personal feelings and aggravation. But this album is very amazing in every way.    AMERICAN LIFE    The first single from the album. This song talks about how Madonna has everything in the \\"American Life\\", but she asks if we all think that she is satisfied with what she has right now. This is a great song, no argument. The video for the song was pulled by Madonna herself, for she felt that it was not the right time to show the video, since a lot of war images and mockery are shown in the video, and Madonna wanted to save herself from the hassle, since the start of the war was already in session. I did see the original video and I think it's a great video.    HOLLYWOOD    The second single from the album. A great song about how a lot of people travel to Hollywood just to make it in the world of popularity. A great song.    I'M SO STUPID    Great song. Madonna, you are not stupid. You are an extremely talented and beautiful woman, who does not let anybody walk all over you. Keep doing what you are doing.    LOVE PROFUSION    The fourth & final single from the album. This is a great song. The music video is something Madonna has never done before. The video starts in a nighttime city, with Madonna, wearing a pink dress, strutting down the middle of the city road, with that of animated birds flying around her. As the chorus starts, the image flips to another location, with Madonna in the same dress, walking the same strutt, but in the location of a meadow, with more animated birds and fish around her. Great video.    NOBODY KNOWS ME    Great song.    NOTHING FAILS    The third single from the album. Most fans chose this song as their favorite from this album, because of it's similarity to \\"Like A Prayer\\". Both songs have uplifting vocals, uplifting lyrics, and uplifting music. This is a great song, but it did not chart too well, and did not have the support of a music video.    INTERVENTION    Great song.    X-STATIC PROCESS    Madonna has said that this is one of her favorites from this album because it is just her on her acoustic guitar and her soothing vocals. This is a great song to relax to.    MOTHER AND FATHER    This song talks about how Madonna's father became after Madonna's mother passed away. Great song.    DIE ANOTHER DAY    From the original motion picture & motion picture soundtrack DIE ANOTHER DAY (2002). First off, this is not the first single from the album, for this song was released as a single from the soundtrack of the same name. \\"American Life\\" is the first single from this album. This song, which would be the theme to the fourth Pierce Brosnan \\"007\\" film of the same name, is just simply incredible. Only eight performers were able to record and release a 007 main theme song that was to my satisfaction and they are: \\"Live And Let Die\\" (performed by Paul McCartney) (for LIVE AND LET DIE 007), \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" (performed by Sheena Easton) (for FOR YOUR EYES ONLY 007), \\"A View To A Kill\\" (performed by Duran Duran) (for A VIEW TO A KILL 007), \\"The Living Daylights\\" (performed by A-ha) (for THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS 007), \\"GoldenEye\\" (performed by Tina Turner) (for GOLDENEYE 007), \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" (performed by Sheryl Crow) (for TOMORROW NEVER DIES 007), \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" (performed by Garbage) (for THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH 007), and \\"Die Another Day\\" (performed by Madonna) (for DIE ANOTHER DAY 007). Madonna even has a cameo in this film as James Bond's fencing instructor named VERITY.    EASY RIDE    Another great song that talks about how Madonna wants everything in life that is amazingly good, but she does not want handed to her, for she wants to earn it, know that she worked her butt off for it. Great song.        This album is another masterpiece by Madonna. Madonna has the master mind at everything she does. She is one of the few artists in this world that is creative enough to stay control of her recording career. Great album.
B000067CPX|5.0|I have to admit I was never a huge fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers earlier stuff. I was one of those people who found the Chili Peppers when they released &quot;Californication&quot; but as good as that album was &quot;By the Way' is so much better. This was the only cd I can remember buying where I listened to it non-stop for a month and am still not sick of it. It is a great mix of mellow songs and upbeat ones. Definately worth your money. The Red Hot Chili Peppers keep getting better and better.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Miyazaki rules. I saw this film in a theatre and wanted right away to see it again. Rarely has a film grabbed me like this one. I saw it once more and then pre-ordered the DVD where it is now almost a permanent addition to my DVD player. Truly this film ranks as one the best films of all time. Others have given longer and more eloquent reviews so I won't copy them. If you want great characters, good writing and eye-popping animation, forget Disney, this is the film. Just get it and enjoy the journey.
B00008S2VG|2.0|I was hoping to love this CD,  Instead I got a Cd of Bleeps and<BR>slow musings ala Jewel,  On most Madonna Cd's you get a couple<BR>of great pop or dance tunes,  here nothing pops out,  this<BR>is truly a weak collection, If it was any other artist I would<BR>give it a pass, But not Madonna,  Madonna where are you?
B00008S2VH|5.0|Wow! This is the best album yet! There's not even one single song in the entire CD that is boring. I love it! This album \\"IS\\" the real Madonna. She ain't the material girl anymore. Go and buy it! I recommend it
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is in all aspects one of the best popular CDs in years, and I don't hesitate to give it the highest rank among all Madonna's albums. The title song, American Life, combines the hip, modern beats with Madonna's unparalleled views of society, religion, materalism, and love relationship. The \\"explicit\\" lyrics in the song beautifully displays the uninhibited and daring spirit of Madonna, not a bit less intense than before. <BR>The rest of the album are equally stunning. Track 5, Nobody Knows Me, uses some of the most trendy dance techniques, mixed with a mysterious trance-like touch. In track 6, 7 and 8, Madonna creatively tells her life story: her view on religion, love for her son, her mother and a bitter-sweet emotion toward her dad. The guitar music, dance beat, electric sounds and mixing of these tracks are impeccable and will definitely stir up a new revolution in the pop music world. And don't forget, track 10 is the motion picture soundtrack Die Another Day.  Madonna is more than just a musician. She's a revolutionary and this album is but another blow against traditional society and conservative thinking. Madonna's bound to spearhead the next wave of rebels.  Strongly Recommend!
B000069AUI|5.0|the first time i heard the samples of it, i thought, it's hard to listen to a whole Coldplay's album song after song, they're just sound the same. But i still gave it a try. And i began to love it. Now Coldplay is one of my favorite bands. Their songs are emotionful and some could make me cry. Their videos are awesome, too. I love \\"the scientist\\",\\"clocks\\",\\"in my place\\",\\"warning sign\\", and especially, \\"a rush of blood to the dead\\".I'm gonna buy \\"parachutes\\" right now cuz i love \\"trouble\\", \\"don't panic\\" as well. The great way to enjoy their music is listening in a silent place, so you can feel its emoion deeply
B00000163G|5.0|Tupac predicted this album will sell millions before he even made it. He said he would put Death Row on the map with this one. Well he did it, so buy it.
B00005JKCH|5.0|They did a great job.  A film you can watch again and again...
B00005JLK1|2.0|This could have been sooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better!  The entire movie was predictable and I was very dissapointed.  I am a huge fan of Juliana's so I was doubly disappointed.  There was a movie a few years back almost identical to this and it too was not good.<br />I give it two stars because the little girl was awesome.<br />The opportunity to make a really creepy horror film set at sea will present itself again and I only hope the director of THAT film will do better.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I love Madonna.  That is my disclaimer.  I feel she is talented, has something to say and has a pretty decent voice that gets better with each album.  This album grows on you. I have listened to it four times and each time I see its positives and negatives more clearly.  Madonna should NEVER rap-it sounds silly and forced.  The album lacks real dance tracks too, which is a shame since that is Madonna's strength.  I love the ecstacy of such classics as &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;into the Groove.&quot;  On this album, the two most embarrassing tracks are the title song and &quot;Mother and Father&quot; which has a ROCKING beat but inane, drivelish lyrics that I felt emarrassed for her.  BUT I love many of the songs on the album, specifically &quot;X-Static Process&quot;, which is breathtakingly beautiful and moving on the level of a song like &quot;Live to Tell&quot; from yesteryear.  Also good are &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; and &quot;Intervention.&quot;  I am surprised by how SAD Madonna sounds. I hope her next album is back to thoughtful And fun.
B00005JLEU|5.0|To say that &quot;Spirited Away&quot; is a Japanese anime that reminds you of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is very true but extremely simplistic.  The literary reference is intended to emphasize the overwhelming creativity of creator Hayao Miyazaki (&quot;Princess Mononoke,&quot; &quot;Kiki's Delivery Service,&quot; &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;) and is not to suggest that this film is some sort of Japanese allegory of Lewis Carroll's surreal children's classic (not to say that you cannot find some intriguing parralels between the two).  What I am and everybody else who makes this comparison is trying to convey to you is that the world to which 10-year-old Chirho (voiced by Rumi Hiiragi &amp; Daveigh Chase) is as much a wonderland as what confronted Alice down the rabbit hole, even if it is just a bathhouse in this case.<br />The story begins with a sullen Chirho moping about in the back of the family car as her parents take her to their new home in a new city.  Then her father takes a fateful wrong turn and they discover what appears to be an abandoned theme park.  But then her parents discover mountains of food, which they start greedily consuming.  As Chirho explores the park things start to change and the spirits start to come out.  Before she knows what has happened, her parents have been changed into pigs and Chirho finds herself in the land of the spirits.  Her quest to rescue her parents and find her way home has begun.<br />&quot;Spirited Away&quot; is not as rich of a visual feast as some classic examples of anime such as &quot;Akira&quot; and &quot;Metropolis,&quot; in part because Miyazaki disdains computer animation in favor of traditional animated cels.  Even if there is not the overwhelming visual display of these other films there is still the attention to detail.  But ultimately the reason why this is the biggest money making film in the history of Japan is because of the story, which has almost as much emotional impact on the audience as &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; (that is a mondo compliment from my perspective because &quot;Grave&quot; is the one anime that I decided to own and not just rent).  Consequently, it is not surprising that this film took over the top spot in Japanese history from &quot;Titanic,&quot; because they both combine emotional stories with compelling visuals.  I have been waiting a long time for this movie to come out on DVD (What?  This film come to the Zenith City?  Are you joking?), and it was every bit as good as I could have ever hoped.<br />The Japanese title &quot;Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi&quot; literally translates as &quot;The Spiriting Away of Sen and Chihiro,&quot; which will make only partial sense to you after you see the film.  I was not surprised that this film was nominated for an Oscar as the Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, but I was surprised, and gratified, that it won.  I have been wondering what the current state of animated art would be in the world today if they had started giving this particular Oscar out a decade earlier and anime like &quot;Akira,&quot; &quot;Metropolis,&quot; and &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; were receiving wider attention if not flat out winning the award.  &quot;Spirited Away&quot; is just the latest opportunity to open the door to the wonders of anime for an even wider audience.;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; (that is a mondo compliment from my perspective because &quot;Grave&quot; is the one anime that I decided to own and not just rent).

B00008WG2M|5.0|I've been hooked on Godsmack ever since I heard their first album. Each one has a slightly different sound to it but all of them sustain quality all the way through - no \\"album fillers.\\" This long awaited album is no exception, full of great guitar riffs, sexy unique vocals and skilled drum work. I was worried that 'Smack may have lost their edge since the loss of their drummer Tommy but Shannon has possibly even improved their sound. Awesome. A must have for any Godsmack, or infact decent music, fan.
B000089CJI|5.0|like you may have read somewhere amidst online ramblings, BEN GIBBARD for president. this man turns everything he touches into genius - similar to midas and his golden touch. it's very different  from death cab for cutie, and that's why it's such a feat for mr. gibbard. if you don't like this cd, you are certifiably insane.
1559409010|5.0|Criterion in their inimitable style have lovingly restored this comedy classic to its orignal Widescreen format from the original negatives.

0780625412|3.0|I am not a fan of the 'Late' Curt Henning but his plan unfolded beautifully. At War Games '97 Henning had earlier agreed to take Double A's spot as the Enforcer of the Four Horsemen. He then turned his back on the Horsemen, he handcuffed Benoit and Mongo to the ring while Henning and the nWo took out Ric Flair. Curt Henning did the imposible he took out the 4 Hoursemen in one night. Ric Flair shortly thereafter disbanded the team and went after Curt and the nWo himself. Of course he failed.

Just to hear the Python boys themselves chortling through their own commentaries and background information is worth it alone. Nice to see it restored in the original Widescreen format as well.
B00005RHGK|3.0|This movie was Ok, not the best horror film Ive ever seen, but at the same time definatley not the worst.<br />  The movie starts out when two teens r travelling home on a desolate country back road and before they realize it a big truck nearly runs them over and speeds ahead. Although lots of people said this was rlly chilling and scary beggining i didnt find anything to creepy about it. Anyways later they drive past an old churh and see the truck parked in the driveway and they see the driver shoving what appears to be a few bodies down a pipe. The driver sees them and atempts to run them over this time but they escape. Although any sane people after that would go run away and call the cops these two decide to go back and look in the pipe. Due to the extreme brilliance of the screenwriters one of them falls down the pipe(thought u never saw that coming eh?)and discovers a chamber ful of bodies and horryfying secrets!...after this the movie starts to flop.<br />  Pretty much after this the guy who fell gets out of the pipe and the two drive to a diner. Before being able to call the police they get a call from a mysterious psychic and slowly start to learn the savage, horror filled story behind this demon that does this to people and why, I for one would of been much happier if it wasent some magical demon with wings and all, but instead a terryfying serial killer, but oh well u cant win them all.<br />  The plot was pretty good and of coarse there where some holes in it and I think that they could of explained what this beast was some more and the makeup and and bodies were not that realsitic, but besides that it had pretty good acting and everything else.<br />  So if your looking for some pretty good scary thrills and some good suspense then I suggest that you watch this. If your one of those people who hates monster movies then I suggest watching this up until the middle of it then turning it off.<br />Im, looking forward to number 2!
B00008S2VG|5.0|After listening to the album entirely non-stop.....I have to admit that this album will be a classic....every song in this album is a gem and single worthy.....HOLLYWOOD is a sure hit and very radio friendly.....Love Profusion is just great with the summery feeling to it....Nothing Fails and Easy Ride are just majestic and a sure classic.....the only drawback in the album is the lead single \\"American Life\\" which i think is mediocre compare to the other songs on the album.....HOWEVER, don't buy the Limited Edition....For $ the content is pretty bad (only CD, Poster, and some stupid stamps...no DVD!!), therefore, not really worth it.....
B00008S2VG|5.0|Having been a recording artist for 20 years and staying on top of her game the entire time, it is no surprise that the newest Madonna album is pure artistry!  This album continues in the electronica vein.  However, it takes the box and blows it wide open by blending in folk, acoustic, rap, rock and has some of her most personal lyrics ever, next to RAY OF LIGHT....after the somewhat dissapointing MUSIC....this album proves that Madonna is still a major artistic force to be reckoned with!  I suggest this album to anyone!  AWESOME RECORDING!
B000002UJQ|5.0|This review will probably never get read, being one of over 1000. <br />The positive reviews of this album are just as dumb as the negative ones. Liking or disliking this cd says nothing about who you are. It's just music.<br />I happen to like it.
0802130208|5.0|I'm truly surprised that I've ran across a person or two who didn't like this novel.  It is easily my favorite book of all time.  It fulfills all the cliches.....original, likeable characters, intertwined stories....The first few pages will have you hooked.  If it doesn't...another genre is probably in order.....I'm going to go read it again now.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|johnny has made this song amazing, and i'm a nin fan.
B000089CJI|5.0|I read a review for this album as \\"...so good that, in a just world, it would stop the war on its own.\\"<br />Oh, how right that is.<br />A distinctly modern melange of n&uuml; wave, dance, alterna-pop, and synth, I'd best describe Postal Service as \\"Electro-indie\\".  If you're a child of the 80s like me who grew up with New Order, OMD, Depeche Mode and Pet Shop Boys, no need to read further--you'll immediately love \\"Give Up\\".<br />In the midst of NYC's current electroclash craze which is so overhyped at times (gosh, just lay down some minimal synths and have some bored models chant vocals), Postal Service is the outstanding contender as the smartest electro band of the year with an album that's so emotional (melody-wise and lyric-wise), so beautiful, and so well-produced that it puts bands like Fischerspooner to shame.  Jenny Lewis' angelic, trance-like girlish voice enhances Gibbard's boyish vocals. Catchy, simple-sounding but beautifully complex, every single track---and I mean every single one--is up to par.<br />notable faves are:<br />1- \\"District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" - Angelic and soft, gradual fades of breakbeats, staccatos and instrumentals with enchanting melody and lyrics that speed up and slow down. Gorgeous.<br />4- \\"Nothing Better\\" - Electro pop at its finest. This duet is so unbelievably catchy, melancholic yet bubbly, sweetened with a bouncy bass line and perfectly placed tweaks and twiddles.<br />9- \\"Brand New Colony\\" - An emotional track intertwined with the twinkly theme from Super Mario Brothers. Brimming with nostalgia, you can hear the gold coins spinning and ka-chingin' as you make Mario jump.<br />10- \\"Natural Anthem\\" - A fierce, drum 'n bass-influenced track in the style of Aphex and other IDM'ers. The junglist in me loves this. A great way to end this five-star album.<br />But you'll find your own favorites. Every track was just so satisfyingly good, I nearly cried at the end. You just don't hear people making music like this nowadays.
B0000035E7|5.0|Well it may not be your favorites if you liked the songs off of nevermind, but in my opinion it's one of the best Nirvana CDs money can buy. It features songs like \\"Floyd The Barber\\", \\"Negitive Creep\\", \\"Love Buzz\\", ect. If you liked Incesticide the you will like Bleach also. It was Nirvana's first album realesed in 1989 with a [small budget], but it won't dissapoint. Well worth it.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I've read so many articles about how washed up madonna's career supposedly is.  They say that every time she brings out an album, and each time she still sells millions and manages to suprise. Her last few albums: American Life, Music and Ray of Light, all seem to sit together comfortably as her best work. People often quote how many copies \\"True Blue\\" sold but honestly that album is astoundingly horrible.  It's hard to care what the so called critics and cd buying public think, especially when they lap up rubbish like Avril Lavigne and even brand it gritty or edgy. Please! All that said, this album is interesting with regards to it's production and also Madonna's vocals. Her vocal on the track X-Static Process is amazingly raw and I think it's nice to hear her without all the effects. Overall the message of this album is an interesting observation of America, and as I'm not from there I think it;s interesting to see one of America's biggest celebs slam the sheer suerficiality of her own culture. She is however famous all over the world so maybe we're all superficial afterall. regardless, I assume nobody knows more about the facade of celebrity than Madonna so she's entitled to burn it all down for us.  Well done it's about time.
0385484518|5.0|I would highly recomend this touching, not sappy book.  While Mitch changes a great deal it isn't an imediate change like many books portray.  The change in him happens over many monthes, i found this made the story very relatable to real life.  While it is only 192 pages it is written extemely well.  It doesn't take up extra space by trying to drag out the story longer than it needs to be.  The flash backs were a wonderful way to explain pertinant information and engage the reader without going into to much unneeded detail.  The format really expresses the book well by putting you there every tuesday in chronological order.  It also helps you follow along and keep track of Mitch's change and Morrie's declineing health.
B000001ESP|5.0|First off for some one to call this overrated is completely silly. This is simply in a word...Masterpiece. I have a hard time deciding if this or 2112 is my favorite Rush album. I'd say 2112 takes it by a nose, but you can't overlook this album. Probably Rush's most solid album from beginning to end. Tom Sawyer, by far Rush's most popular song, is even with lots of radio play, a shining star of a song. YYZ with no lyrics, oddly does more for me than any other song by the trio off any album. Once it's about roughly 2:50 into it, the part where they switch directions and seem to bring a fantastic sound to me is the most &quot;Moving&quot; part of the whole album. I suggest this album to anyone who loves music, not just the Rush fans or the Progressive fans (if you claim to be either of the two, you should already have this). 10 stars.

B000050GBF|4.0|As most of the world knows by now, X-Men is the live-action version of the of the Marvel comic strip, directed by Bryan Singer (of the Usual Suspects fame). Set in the not too distant future the X-Men are humans who thanks to genetic mutation have inherited special powers. On the surface, having special powers sounds great (you might think) but in X-Men the mutant race is an oppressed and persecuted minority, due to the bigotry, ignorance and fear of much of the non-mutant population. Furthermore an ambitious and influential Senator (Bruce Davison) wants to introduce a registration policy for mutants in an attempt to further restrict their civil rights. In response to this the mutant community is split into two camps led by Professor X, aka Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto, aka Erik Mangus Lensherr (Sir Ian McKellen). Magneto believes in the supremacy of the mutant population, which he is willing to use force to prove, whilst Professor X merely wants, equality, integration and peace. With fundamentally opposing views the two camps are set on a collision course with the future of the human race at stake.<br />X-Men is an entertaining action movie and it has some great fight scenes but it is pitched at its intended mass audience and carefully falls short explicit violence making it pretty much suitable for all but young children. However, although the X Men movie comes from a comic book background and is definitely aimed at a mass audience it also has a message and is a lot more highbrow than most super hero adaptations. X-Men for example opens with a scene in a Nazi concentration camp with a young Magneto witnessing his mother being shepherded off to the gas chamber and from this it is pretty clear that Director Bryan Singer is deliberately making a point and drawing a comparison. It is also worth noting that at the time of the X Men's creation, back in 1963, among the major political figures in pre civil rights America were Martin Luther King and Malcolm X and it is easy to draw comparisons with Professor X and Magneto. Comparisons can also be drawn between X-Men character Senator Robert Kelly and a certain Senator McCarthy. What is more, X-Men is particularly pertinent at a time when there is so much tabloid speculation and scare mongering with regard to genetic engineering.<br />With X-Men, Director Bryan Singer, a self-confessed fan, has stayed remarkably loyal to the comic books and has served up a commercial but extremely enjoyable film with impressive special effects, which has inevitably spawned a sequel and (in all likelihood) a franchise, which makes me for one very happy. Full of great characters and great performances from the likes of Hugh Jackman (as Wolverine), Anna Pacquin (as Rogue) and Famke Janssen (as Dr Jean Grey) and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (as Mystique). However, it is the excellent pairing of the Royal Shakespeare company's McKellen and Stewart opposite each other that really adds gravitas to the proceedings and my only real dissapointments were seeing the excellent and beautiful Halle Berry (as Storm) being under-used and the relatively short running length of 97 minutes.<br />X-Men 2 hits our screens later this year and I for one am really looking forward to it!

B000089RVX|5.0|When I heard the excellent single &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; for the first time, I was enthralled.  Just the depth in one song was enough to get me to buy the CD.  And I was glad.  With  11 songs (just enough to give you a good taste and leave you wanting more), you will find yourself singing along in no time.  It starts with the opening song &quot;Going Under,&quot; a more hard-rock tune that gets you in the feel of the album.  Then comes the single everyone's talking about, &quot;Bring Me to Life,&quot; which blends rock, pop and everything in-between in just four minutes.  Each song following gets better and better (the exception Tourniquet, which is a love it or hate it song, and for me, it depends on the day).  My favorites on the CD are My Immortal, Haunted, Hello, and Whisper.  I love the choirs featured in the background.  Pick up this CD.  It's well worth the money.  You'll be listening to it for years to come.  Trust me.
B00008S2VG|3.0|I identified Madonna's  metamorphosis from \\"Material Girl\\" to \\"Minimalist Girl\\".(This review appears at Amazon.com under her album \\"Music\\".)Now,  \\"American Life\\" relies on the folktronica she explored on \\"Music\\" and the track \\"Don't Tell Me\\".<br />Of this album she said it best herself: that she has been living in a dream and now has definitively woken up.  The \\"Music\\" album was very upbeat from a standpoint of delivering universal anthems of redemption, celebration and idealism   - think \\"Paradise Not For Me\\", \\"Nobody's Perfect\\", \\"Music\\" and \\"Don't Tell Me\\" - and the Mirwais production complimented the lyricism appropriately. In a sense, it was the perfect amalgam of  accessible pop hooks and Mirwais' more earthy production which made pleasing in that it was a work that blended more her evolved artistic ability with what she is identifiable with: great pop.<br />Now, she sees things for what they really are. By the way, at the age of 44 on \\"American Life\\", Madonna is finding new things to explore and pushing buttons in a new way just by way of a pretty innocuous admission: that the pursuit of fame and material possessions is meaningless. On the surface, it comes off as either insincere or flat-out absurdly naive from one of the world's richest, pampered and influential rock stars. In the title cut Madonna takes issue with the crass consumer/entertainment culture and the American fascination with the desire for instant fame and the lengths people will go to become known - namely by way of  the medium of Reality Television.  We see in the \\"American Life\\" video how round-the-clock war coverage sadly becomes some form of entertainment or reality television.<br />\\"What you ask is so controversial about this which we already know?\\" To answer that, The United States made Madonna a star and Madonna was/is perceived by her detractors - and even by some of her fans - as having been synonymous with the decade in which she rose to fame as the \\"Material Girl\\". She played rightinto what she was dubbed and thus the '80s icon was born and now she has come to a realization that material pursuits are meaningless - and she wants us to listen in a time where the culture is dominated by people hungry for fame and fortune on \\"American Idol\\".<br />Some will say \\"How dare She?\\" or \\"Who does she think she is - some kind of hypocrite?\\" That is what makes the premise of the project so intriguing and tantalzing. You should listen - even if you don't want to. This is her most controversial project in years even if she does not mean it to be because due in large part to the social climate in which it was released with the war in Iraq juxtaposed with our unrelenting and insatiable need for violence and frivolous things here in the U.S. She is making a statement about the American people at large and that is why some do not want to hear it. No one wants to hear anything negative about themselves - let alone from a woman or a woman of Madonna's power significance or wealth, but the message translates well into the song.<br />The jerking between two seemingly opposed styles or disparate  mediums of folk and rap/hip-hop merge very effectively and reflect on Madonna and Mirwais' progressive intentions as artists in the title cut. It underscores the fragmented nature of American culture and jerking pace of our lives - for better or worse. The song recalls Jane Child's \\"Welcome To The Real World\\" which is as a definite antecedent to \\"American Life\\". Also, the song evokes Tara Kemp's \\"Come Correct\\" of '94 sonically. These two are worth investigation, but I digress.<br />\\"American Life\\" is filled with avant-garde material such as \\"Easy Ride\\" and \\"Die Another Day\\" which blend strings and orchestra with thumping and trendy beats. One wonders what the results would be of an entire album in that vein. \\"Easy Ride\\" blends three disparate styles: Classical, Folk and Rap/Hip-Hop.<br />\\"Nothing Fails\\" is classic Madonna and is a surefire hit as a single. It is electric androusing- think \\"Power of Goodbye\\" but not drab and is arguably the best song on the set considering Madonna's strengths for memorable pop. \\"Love Profusion\\" an '80s retro vibe with cool thumping beats.<br />The lilting \\"X-Static Process\\" which evokes Jim Croce and the opening of Stevie Wonder's \\"Overjoyed\\" in its intimacy is a meditation on not losing one's self in a relationship or feeling inferior to your partner. Within its bare acoustic framework, its message is delivered with such an earnest intent.<br /> The other acoustic-oriented cut \\"Intervention\\" is a soggier piece of filler that relies too much on platitudes about \\"Love Keeping Us Together\\". The pared-down approach cannot save a song with trite lyrics or a limp melody which are supposed to carry a song. <br />In assessing Madonna's approach, one has to wonder why she mixed  \\"Intervention\\" and \\"X-Static Process\\" with more of her traditional fare given her history as a more of a dance oriented act, although perhaps she feared that should mainstream Top 40 radio not to take to her given the recent casualties fellow more seasoned contenders such as Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston that she should offer a range of possible radio contenders that could potentially appeal to Adult Contemporary or HOT AC radio or even Alternative Radio. <br />In \\"Hollywood\\" Madonna even evokes Sheryl Crow and '80s inflections of punk thus the problem with the set: there are instances here where her legion of fans may not readily accept this material despite the strengths. As progressive as  \\"Hollywood\\" and \\"I'm So Stupid are, they are not instantly accessible and compared to previous outings that is the biggest drawback to the set. Personally, Madonna is preferable on glistening pop gems such as \\"Music\\" and \\"Ray of Light\\" however there are a few gems and the rockier experimental numbers on this set are curious  and mostly strong enough to warrant recommending it.
6304416415|5.0|At theatres In the summer of '89, \\"Honey I Shrunk the kids\\" more than held it's own against box office heavyweights such as \\"Do the Right thing\\", \\"Batman\\", and \\"Indiana Jones and the last crusade\\". Quite the feat, considering it's relatively obscure cast (well, compared to the afforementioned films.) <br />The movie starts out with a nice animation sequence that looks as good now as it did 13 years ago. The live action starts as a typical Saturday morning in suburbia at the Szalinski's house, except that Wayne (Rick Moranis) is a bumbling inventor who built a shrinking ray in his attic that he can't get to work, his son (Robert Oliveri) is a mirror-image. And the daughter (Amy O'Neill) is pretty much your typical Blond teenager [a good looking one at that ;)] who hopes she gets asked to the dance. The mother, Diane Szalinski, played by Marcia Strassman (of Welcome Back, Kotter fame) does a good job as well. Cork, the family dog also deserves mentioning. <br />Next door are the All-American Thompsons, who have big plans for a weekend fishing trip. Their oldest son Russ Jr. (Thomas Wilson Brown) is less than enthusiastic about those plans. He's a bit scrawny for his age and Big Russ has expectations to see him excel at High School football, which isn't Little Russ's Niche. Meanwhile younger son Ron Thompson (Jared Rushton) is the apple of Big Russ's eye, and can be quite mischievous at times, setting up a booby trap that his dad walks into. <br />The underrated Matt Frewer steals the show as Big Russ Thompson, Brash and Sarcastic (in a good way of course). And providing the perfect compliment is his wife, the calmer Mae Thompson (played by Kristine Sutherland). <br />The backstory is this:Ron Thompson hits a baseball into the Szalinskis attic, in turn setting off the shrinking machine (which hadn't worked until that point) and in their effort to retrieve the ball, Ron and Nick get zapped and are 1/4 inch tall, Amy and Russ Jr., who walk up to the attic wondering whathappened to them, meet a similar fate. Wayne returns home from a dismal day at work, having been made a laughing stock because of his lack of proof for the shrinking machine. He takes his frustration out on the machine itself, severely damaging it in the process, he sweeps the broken parts (and the four kids) off the floor and into the trash bag. He then takes it out across the yard, and the kids are, as Nick eloquently says \\"We're now a quarter of an inch tall, and sixty four feet from the house. That's an equivalent of three-point-two miles. That's a long way. Even for a man of science.\\" Even more of a trek considering the extra thick grass they must walk through. <br />En route the gang faces Swarms of bees and scorpions [among other obstacles that I won't give away;)]. There's decent use of special effects and, even if they may look a bit fake, it's still entertaining nonetheless. I'll end my description here, as anything more would spoil the film. <br />If this review doesn't entice you to check out \\"Honey, I shrunk the kids\\", I don't know what will. It's a classic in my opinion.
0553296981|5.0|I studied this book in high school (10th grade), and it has really taught me a lot about life during the Holocaust and this family in hiding.<br />  Anne had written expressively in her diary, about life as a teenager and her innermost feelings about her friends, Peter, her parents, Margot, and Dr. Dussell. She was only 15 and already have the credibility as a writer in her own writing style, which is what amazes me. It also made me feel sorry for the families who died at the camps (except her father, who survived). It is one of the best books I have in my book collection.<br />  This book is entertaining for all kids and adults! An excellent choice in any library.
B00008S2VH|5.0|When I first heard the single \\"American Life\\" and read reviews for the album, I thought this album was going to be \\"Music: a few years later\\" with a splash of \\"Ray of Light\\". What I found was an album that exibited tremendous musical and spiritual growth from Madonna. She tries on new styles and plays with them in intriguing ways. She sings and speaks from the heart and let's you into her psyche in a very \\"sit down and speak with a close friend\\" manner. It makes her very human and relatable. You get the person behind all of the celebrity hype.<br />My favorite song was X-static Process. That song killed me! And I'm not a very emotional person! But it's songs like that one that make me question if Madonna was writing this album about me! Just kidding.<br />This album should do really well. So run out, buy it. It's amazing. You will not be disappointed.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This CD proves that the White Stripes are one of the best bands around! it also proves their brilliance. the songs are wonderfully written and performed.

0553103547|5.0|In the Song of Ice and Fire books George R. R. Martin puts more character detail, personality and development than any other fantasy/sci-fi books I have ever read (been reading fantasy for over 20 years).  The plots are complex and intricate yet often neatly tied together and the 100s of background characters are as dynamic and real as the main story lines.  Unlike other series which seem to stretch out with little true action, these books are action packed despite the attention taken to detail and character development.  While not for the very young readers, as adult themes and language are present, this is the best fantasy series I have ever encountered.  I anxiously await the realease of the 4th book, and have actually re-read the series in anticipation of its release.  A MUST read for anyone even remotely interested in the fantasy genre!

B00005JLEU|5.0|I have never been a big fan of current anime (when i was a kid, i was big on transformers, gi joe and robotech) but when someone recommended this film, i had to see for myself. The file is incredible! I defintely recommend it to anyone who wants to see a great, engaging film!
B00008S2VG|5.0|I love this CD! Once again Madonna creates a brilliant techno-pop production. <br />This time she has a folky edge. Acoustic guitars strumming over pulsing electro beats, amazing strings sections and beautifully spare synth lines. It is haunting and emotional, uplifting and rewarding. She is fearless with her vocals and the songs are risky. But that it why it works. No one else even tries to do the things that Madonna does.<br />Standouts are &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;, &quot;Hollywood&quot; and my favorite track &quot;Easy Ride&quot; <BR>This is sure to be a classic and will be the soundtrack of 2003!
B00008DDXB|5.0|Any fan of J.K. Rowling's books will love this movie, I am betting.  The film version sticks fairly close to the original story, the special effects are a treat, and it is just great family fun...I would say the best family oriented movie of the year.  <BR>I love the performances given by Alan Rickman (Professor Snape) and of course Richard Harris (Dumbledore) and, in fact, all the other supporting--i.e. adult!!--actors.  It's true that the children seem to be getting a bit old for their roles:  noticeably Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron).  I'm sure this will be more of a concern for the next movie in the series....I thought Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) still pulled off an admirable performance, however, and would hope to see him back for year three at Hogwart's.<BR>The story is exciting, clear, and moves along at an excellent pace.  The setting of Hogwart's is spectacularly done, and for once, as good as I'd imagined it when reading the books.<BR>I suppose if you hadn't read the books (and apparently there are still three or four of you!!), some of the charm of Hogwart's and the excellent portrayal of the staff there could be lost on you.  GO READ THE BOOKS before you see the next movie, I'd say...<BR>And, if you haven't already, buy this movie and watch it with your kids, your grandchildren, your neighbour'[s kids, etc. for years to come.
0812548094|4.0|I read Wizards First Rule in one extended sitting during a 30 hour trip from Sydney to Frankfurt. I wanted a book that would take my mind off of being cooped up in airplanes. It worked really well for that.<br />I read Stone of Tears because WFR got me hooked on the characters, particularly Richard, the hero, and I wanted more. For me, Stone of Tears was an even better story. Do you know that feeling when you identify with a character so much that you start writing your own dialog for him? I hope that's not just me who does that...<br />I agree with a lot of reviewers who talk about wooden dialog and some unbelievable situations. Most of the men and some of the women in the story seem to have physical abilities and endurance that would sweep the olympic games if they ever tore the veil between that world and ours. But, listen: that's not important. To me, emotions are important, and intelligent characters. I don't want to be yelling at dumb characters, in my head.<br />I identify with Richard. He's an angry young man with a strong personal code. He's no wuss. He's smart. I once was a young man like that, too, so it felt good to slip into his skin.<br />Ultimately, my test for a good book is whether it changes how I experience the world. This series is doing that. I'm thinking about my own experience as a Seeker, and my own personal Sword of Truth. Sound silly? In 1999, I quit a safe job and became a consultant. I had no savings, nor equipment, nor preparation. This was a Sword of Truth moment, I now realize. It's a moment that comes rarely in life-- when you see what you must do and you do it despite the pain it will cause you. We're caught up in so many complicated threads in our modern lives, Terry Goodkind is the kind of writer who helps me reflect on how I can maintain my moral compass.
B00005JKMQ|3.0|As expected from Michael Mann, the Director who brought us \\"Last of the Mohicans\\", \\"Ali\\" is a well-crafted movie.  Akin to a Swiss watch, the movie was chronicled with precision from Ali's rose to fame by beating Sonny Liston, his convergence into Islam, his estrangement from his father in particular for dumping the so-called slave name, Cassius Clay, his womanising attribute, his fall with Malcolm X, Ali's refusal to be drafted into the US Army, his close relationships with Cosell (Jon Voight), Howard Bingham (the person who took intimate photographs of him).  I would have liked to watch how he got into boxing at the first place due to his stolen bike & subsequently discovered by his trainer, his legendary fights with Joe Frasier, his fight with his Parkinson disease.  Maybe it's due to time constraint or maybe, the Director felt that it's best to depict Ali for overcoming his fear of losing by beating George Foreman in  Zaire.  Standing ovation to Will Smith for his individual performance.  If we were to watch the documentary of Muhammed Ali, you would have noticed that Will Smith WAS Ali.  The voice, the way he moved were commendable.  Having said that, the rest of the crew were in their best form yet.  As the movie critic summarised succinctly, a movie that worked if it's watched as it is, but faltered should it tried to explain Ali, the man that he is.
B00005O5JV|4.0|This is a movie that does not take itself too seriously, yet does not degenerate into silliness.  Life does not really go the way this story does.  Shallow, skin-deep personas do not suddenly become intelligent enough to pass the LSAT, and then breeze their way into Harvard Law School.  Rich pretty girls who eventually get dumped in favor of \\"marriage material\\" do not in the course of a few months become intelligent and thoughtful, while maintaining their Cover Girl persona.  On the other hand, people do change, the Ivy League has plenty of nontypical students, and people with good hearts often do overcome those without.  Thus, the exaggerations prove hilarious, rather than foolish.  We want to believe this story!<br />Reese Witherspoon is the star, and does a splendid job of transforming her character, Elle Woods, from a caricature to a real person (a bit like Pinnocio).  The movie could have been renamed Valley Girl Goes to Harvard, or The Straw Girl Finds a Brain, except that the exaggerated story and characters are based in real life scenarios.  This girl that, in real life, many would love to hate, is so sweet, and stumbles through life with such cheerfulness and heart, that, as she quips at one point, \\"But everyone loves me.\\"  <br />Bottom line:  Relax and laugh--this is a fun movie with some neat moral insights, and lots of pretty people who end up being pretty nice too.
B00005JLRT|4.0|The previous offerings of \\"New Generations\\" were tame.  It made not much difference watching it on the big screen or on TV as the movies were rather even-paced.  However, Nemesis was built upon an excellent foundation: a tight script, a great cast that was comfortable in their roles, stunning fighting sequence (not in Star Wars league but still, commendable for the Star Trek franchise).  Not a bad effort at all for the first time Director, Stuard Baird.  A movie that asked the question, what if the worst enemy is none other than yourself.  Would you simply give in & tell yourself that there is nothing that you do would make any difference or you push yourself to be a better person?  That's the question Jean-Luc Picard sought & the answer he found.  Bravery, loyalty, paternity, sacrifice for the common good, family are brought into light.  A definite vintage Star Trek.  The best movie, yet!  Can't help but notice that the uniform for the commanding officers are all into black & purple, not different from the uniform that TV series Enterprise is wearing.  Highly recommended even for a non-Trekkie
B0000696I1|2.0|This time April buys some ancient Japanese antique which turns out to be a time septer and she switches places with a Japanese king's son.So the turtles have to go and get her and return within'a 48 hour period.Not all that interesting,event tamer than part 2.The best thing about this is Casey Jones,and the 4 Japanese guys, who switch places with the turtles,watching hockey and playing video games at the bar.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is an intelligent, abrasive and complex story of a young man who's driven mad by the hollowness of his materialistic existence.<br />This movie is constantly entertaining to me:  the humor is sly, non-stop, ironic and paradoxical (see Brad Pitt's tirade about unfulfilled dreams and you'll understand).  The technical achievements are first-rate (imaginative use of cgi to illustrate the contents of a trash can seemed highly appropriate for the themes explored in this story!)  The action sequences are exciting and cringe-inducing at the same time.  The actors are entirely believable in their circumstances.<br />The best thing about this movie (more so than the book its based on) was that it led me to re-assess some of my beliefs about success and achievements in life.  Isn't that what great artworks are suppose to do?
B0000696I0|5.0|Turtles II is a good sequel to the original film.This time the Turtles discover,from the news that the company responsible for creating the Ooze that made them,may not have disposed of all of the ooze.They basically try to get a hold of it before it falls into the hands of the Foot Clan.Shredder returns,after what I thought to be his death,to led the Foot,and to get the ooze to try and make a couple mutants of his own to help him destroy the turtles.Some good action and good humor.The violence is toned down and there is no bad language.The only thing here that's bad is an appearance by Vanilla Ice.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I'm the kind of Fleetwood Mac fan who likes Buckingham's Out of the Cradle and owns (and loves) every Nicks solo album. Now that you know where I stand...After hearing the finely crafted pop singles, PEACEKEEPER and SAY YOU WILL, I was unprepared for the impact of this bizarre, beautiful, strange, exotic, startling album. The entire band put heart and soul into this work of art--it is in no way tired or repetitive. It is not Rumours II; it is not Tusk II. I cannot compare Say You Will to any other FM work. Don't even think about calling it Buckingham Nicks II--these two artists have evolved in their lyrical poetry and are now using their voices more flexibly as instruments, adapting their vocals to suit each song. The entrancing vocal blend is still there, but it is pleasantly different. So far, I have not been able to play this album as background noise while doing other things. It's too complex, lyrically and musically. I have to lie on the floor with headphones on and listen all the way through, experiencing every nuance.<br />It's too bad that radio is stuck in a rut and can't handle some riskier single releases, such as RUNNING THROUGH THE GARDEN or (let's go out on a creative limb here) MIRANDA! They might have attracted a new, younger following than the safe pop singles that will mostly alert long-time fans to the new release. These quirkier songs would not be played on any of the radio stations I can pick up in my corner of Texas, but then, I won't be hearing PEACEKEEPER and SAY YOU WILL on the radio either...a sad state of affairs indeed.<br />The one song that I hear criticized the most by FM fans is SILVER GIRL. I love this song. Given a choice, I would have preferred it on Nicks' solo work, Trouble In Shangri-La, in place of the S. Crow-penned IT'S ONLY LOVE. Even so, it holds its own as an FM song, and I like it more with every play within the context of this album. The other Nicks eccentricity that is criticized is the repetition of a verse from ILLUMEin DESTINY RULES. Let the songwriter explain it: (from a Mirage era Fleetwood Mac interview) \\"When I write songs, I go back and I take in other things. You know, I'll say something that's right out of another song. And people say to me,\\"You shouldn't do that...You're ripping off yourself...\\" But that's not how I look at it, because I figure that everything I write is just an ongoing chronology of my life and my Fleetwood Mac and my songs and my friends. So, it's like, to be continued. Everything I write is to be continued...\\"<br />Casual FM fans might or might not find something to like about SAY YOU WILL, but for those who like to see the FM members grow their own way, be who they are, and do what they do best, this is ESSENTIAL to your collection.

B00008S2VH|5.0|I just got the cd and I've been playing it \\"over and over\\". Is more mature than her last cd \\"Music\\". The writing is deeper and the music is excellent!!! I dont say that because Ive been a fan for 20 years but also because as a fan I feel that we are part of her journey. Is amazing to think that she's been around for 20 years and she still knows how to make her fans happy! :) Get the cd if you don't have it!!!
B00005RY7X|5.0|this album has such brillant sugar coated songs that id like to thanx the man who made it and so will u after u buy it.also if u have a friends who are metal heads who hates every punk album u buy they will love this.
B00008S2VH|1.0|This CD is very disappointing.  There will be many used copies of this CD for sale on this website very soon.  This music is unlike any of her other cd's; it stinks. I bet the people that Madonna complained about in the news last week that downloaded this cd have already copied over it.
B000065VB9|5.0|There are no bad or even mediocre songs on this album. This is Gabriel's first solo album where he seems fully in control. The mood is consistent and intense. The drums bang big and well-used dissonance lurks behind every harmony. It's very difficult to find something bad to say about it.<br />Gabriel explores many themes on this album, from people who enjoy breaking into homes (\\"Intruder\\") to people who need attention and go to extremes to get it (\\"Family Snapshot\\") to the relationship between sex and war (\\"Games Without Frontiers\\") to alienation (\\"Not One of Us\\") to the final political protest song against apartheid (\\"Biko\\"). Pop albums (if you can call this a pop album) rarely if ever explore such territory with such depth. The music backs up the lyrics to a degree that's almost mesmerizing.<br />Gabriel had come a long way from Genesis by the time this album was released. Just listen to \\"Trespass\\" (from 10 years before this album) or \\"Selling England By the Pound\\" (from half a decade or so before this album) to see how Gabriel expanded his depth for music and lyrics. It's hard to believe that the same guy singing \\"No Self-Control\\" once roamed around on stage dressed as a bat or a giant flower. In retrospect Gabriel's departure from Genesis may have been the best move of his career. It's hard to imagine Genesis going in the direction Gabriel went in, considering where they ended up (somewhere on the opposite side of the spectrum).<br />A host of great performers contributed instruments or vocals, which can be heard on every note. Robert Fripp returns as a guitarist (he would never again produce Gabriel), Kate Bush sings backup, David Gregory (formerly of XTC) contributes guitar, and even Phil Collins plays drums. The names go on and on (including Tony Levin and David Rhodes, who became staples). It's tempting to give Gabriel all the credit for this one, but his band had a lot to do with the solidity of this effort.<br />If you know nothing about Gabriel and are curious, this is a good one to start with. The songs are \\"the usual\\" length (unlike the followup \\"Security\\") and, as has been said, they're all great. If you don't like this album, you probably don't like Gabriel. This is the album on which he found his voice.urious, this is a good one to start with.

B00008S2VG|1.0|I wasn't a big fan of her last CD, &quot;Music&quot;. I LOVED &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and was hoping to get something even close to that. However, this CD is horrendous in every way. This is coming from a person who was thinking that she would go back to the &quot;Ray of Light&quot; format. However, I was not only sadly mistaken, but terribly dissapointed by this effort. Not only is the music horribly &quot;off&quot;, but the lyrics are ridiculous as well. I had no idea of what Madonna was talking about throughout this CD. Actually I did, but not too much of it made sense. Who is she to criticize the &quot;matrix&quot;? She's benefited from this &quot;programmed&quot; world as so she refers to it throught the CD. I would be wrong if I called her confused, but one thing is for sure I'm not confused about this thrown together CD. It is downright horrible! If not for the controversy over her video for &quot;American Life&quot;, I'd find it hard to even think about this ridiculous effort. She desperately needs to find a new producer because this one is just horrible. I was hoping that William Orbit did something on this CD, but all for not. Maybe it's time for her to retire.
0790731940|5.0|Maverick is a hilarious, enjoyable and fun film to watch and bears well over several viewings.  Of course, how could this film have missed given its cast; Mel Gibson, James Garner, Jodie Foster, James Coburn and a whole slew of other stars to include an outrageously funny cameo by Danny Glover.  The more interesting thing here is that James Garner played Brett Maverick when it was a television series many moons ago and he had turned down many film scripts for this one where he didn't even play the lead.  Maverick is a big hit and all involved in making this fine western/comedy deserve all of the accolades they received for it!<br />The premise:<br />Bert, oops I mean Brett Maverick (Mel Gibson) is a card playing and fast drawing hustler who is on his way to good old St. Louis for a huge poker tournament.  His main problem is that he's three thousand dollars short of the entry fee so he decides to stop in another town and play another round of poker in the hopes of picking up some of the three thousand he needs.  This is where he meets Annabelle Branford played by the ever beautiful Jodie Foster.  Mrs. Branford's beauty is matched only by her desire to pick up the money to enter the big poker game as well.  Not too long afterwards we meet Zane Cooper (James Garner) who is a lawman of some fame and he just happens to be going the same way as Maverick and Mrs. Branford.  What follows is most definitely one of the most hilarious westerns ever made.  I would highly recommend this film to any and all fans of the stars and this genre.<br />Special Features:<br />Production notes:  This particular DVD is \\"all\\" about the film itself as there is very little in the way of special features.  The production notes are of course in text and somewhat interesting.  {ssintrepid}
B000002UAX|4.0|I often think that if the Beatles had taken the best songs from both vinyl LP's of the \\"White Album\\"... and put it on ONE album... man - would this be a truly incredible release.... There are undoubtedly some classic Beatles hit songs here... \\"Dear Prudence\\", \\"Helter Skelter\\", \\"Blackbird\\", \\"Rocky Raccoon\\", \\"Revolution 1\\", Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\", \\"Birthday\\", \\"Glass Onion\\", \\"Back In The USSR\\", and Harrison's best song ever \\"While My Guitar Gently Sleeps\\". And on the flip side, there is plenty of nonsense and mindless tomfoolery going on... \\"Honey Pie\\", Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\", \\"Yer Blues\\", \\"Everbody's Got Something To Hide Except Me & My Monkey\\", \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" and more. The \\"White Album\\" arrived in 1968, right smack between the 2 best late-era Beatle albums... Magical Mystery Tour (1967) and Abbey Road (1969). If I rate \\"Abbey Road\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" with a brilliant 5 stars... there's no way I can give the \\"White Album\\" the same rating. Classic - yes - but not in the same league as the previously mention releases... there's too much filler and useless experimentation by John & Paul mixed in with the hits. The true test is time... after you've listened to this album 100 times (maybe 200 times), you can't say that this is their one best release with brilliant songs and absolutely no filler. I can't. The DOUBLE album was this releases bump in the road... like so many other classic rock bands have realized with their own double albums... i.e. Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\", ELO's \\"Out Of The Blue\\", The Clash's \\"London Calling\\", Led Zeppelin's \\"Physical Graffiti\\", Guns & Roses \\"Use Your Illusion I-II\\", etc.... just think if these bands had taken the best songs from each of these double LP's and made ONE album... how truly incredible the single album would have been. The \\"White Album\\" is a strong effort by the Beatles, just not their best.
6305313687|5.0|One of the most powerful films to come along in quite some time, American History X would not have achieved such greatness were it not for the performance of Edward Norton.  Norton is hypnotic and lights up the screen whenever he appears as the young and charismatic Derek Vinyard, a former white supremicist who has re-thought his ways during his time in prison, and now fights to save his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from a similar fate.  As the Amazon review above states, Norton is so convincing in his role that you can almost detect a shred of logic in Derek's views before his prison time, and he is so immersed in his role (from his bulked up body to his swastika tattooed across his heart) that you'll find his Oscar nomination for Best Actor quite well deserved (and some may even feel he was robbed), and Norton proves that he is one of the most daring and finest actors of today.  Furlong gives the best performance of his career, and he deserved much more acclaim for his performance than he received.  The cast also includes Beverly D'Angelo as Derek and Danny's mother, Stacy Keach as Derek's former neo-nazi mentor, and Avery Brooks as Derek's former teacher; all of whom give knockout performances.  All in all, American History X is one of the most powerful films to come along in quite some time, and it is carried on the shoulders of Norton's brilliant performance.  The ending of the film is both tragic and ironic, and will haunt you for days after viewing.
0066620996|3.0|The information in GOOD TO GREAT came about from an extensive study of Fortune 500 companies by Jim Collins and his graduate student researchers resulting in an interesting collection of a few coherent but largely predictable conclusions.  One of the few surprises is the relatively dowdy-seeming companies who actually performed well where many of the household \\"go-go\\" companies didn't make the cut.  <br />Reported are 11 firms that had outperformed the market by at least a factor of 3 consistently for at least 15 years; excluded from consideration were companies whose entire industry group was skyrocketing.  These were each compared to a companion company from the same industry that did not do nearly as well.  There were also 6 companies that were unsustained comparisons. From this the researchers uncovered a core set of success factors largely present in the Greats and missing from the not Greats:<br />Outstanding leadership on a continuing basis following the same vision &amp; mission (not necessarily the same person, but staying largely on the same direction).  Start and maintain the necessary changes.<br />First Who than What - the right people on the bus in the right seats<br />Have honest facts to evaluate, but keep faith in success from competency (not wishful thinking) - encourage and use healthy debate. <br />The Hedgehog Concept - Simplicity Within the Three Circles (the intersection of What you're deeply passionate about, What drives your economic engine and What you can be the best in the world in).  Tied into this is insight into your economic engine \\"what is your denominator\\" more appropriately what do you measure and what do you measure it against; the key metric is not always obvious.  This might be sales per employee (Abbott), sales per local population (Kroger), profit per customer visit (Walgreens), or profit per mortgage risk level (Fannie Mae)<br />The culture of discipline having honest and disciplined people eliminates the need for hierarchy or oppressive rules.<br />Use technology appropriately to advance your mission, not as your core competence.<br />The Flywheel and Doom Loop - Overcome inertia and maintain the effort - recognize that it takes time and effort applied in a consistent direction to get things going faster and faster; if the effort wanes or the direction changes, momentum is lost.
B00006G8HX|4.0|Taking place after the events of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock finds Admiral Kirk and co. stealing the Enterprise to go to the unstable planet of Genesis to rescue a reborn and rapidly growing Spock.  Leonard Nimoy directed this third feature film outing in the Star Trek series, and it shows that this is a series in transition, up to and including Kirk's willful destruction of the Enterprise, and an interesting look at Vulcan rituals.  The Search for Spock isn't the best film in the series, but it isn't the worst either (Star Trek V Anyone?), and it serves as a nice bridge between the best films in the series: Wrath of Khan and the hugely sucessful The Voyage Home.  The Special Edition DVD is worth noting as well, and is lightyears beyond Paramount's original DVD version of the film which had no extras at all.  The commentary from Nimoy and co. is intriguing, and the short on creating the Klingon language is a must watch for Trekkies.
B00008S2VG|5.0|After 20 years Madonna can still put out some awesome music, this CD is very acoustic and guitar sounding but it has some of Madonna's best songs.  Here is what I think of all the tracks except for the already released singles Die Another Day and American Life  <br />Hollywood - This song is so 80's sounding and the synthesizer is awesome, this is going to be a huge hit, very addicting and catchy, reminds me of Sheryl Crow at times.<br />I'm So Stupid - This is a awesome song, her vocals are so raw and out there, she sings the hell out of this song. It reminds me of Garbage and Alanis Morisette.<br />Intervention - This sounds so much like the Red Hot Chili Peppers in the beginning, very pretty song, lots of guitar.<br />Nobody Knows Me - This is very 80's sounding also, very dancy and will be a hit in the clubs for sure, lots of awesome bass in this one, this one needs some remixes.<br />Nothing Fails - All I can say is this is awesome, very beautiful and the choir is just amazing, this is the Like A Prayer of 2003.<br />Mother & Father - I love this one also, very addicting, sounds very childlike in the beginning and also has a great rap at the end.<br />Love Profusion - I really like this track, it should definitely be a single, very radio friendly.<br />X-Static Process - Very beautiful ballad with only a guitar and Madonna doing both backup and lead vocals.<br />Easy Ride - This is a great track to end the CD it is a gorgeous song with an orchestra.  Everyone needs to buy this CD, you will not be disappointed
B00008OLYN|5.0|Where do I begin my review of Opeth's latest masterpiece, Damnation? 'Awaiting word on what's to come' might well be the best way to summarize my thoughts about this album.  After releasing an album comprising mostly of heavy songs last November, Opeth graces us with a beautifuly crafted experimental album.<br />The heaviest, most uptempo, part of the album certainly is the ending of track 4, 'Closure', a swirling crescendo of indian-inspired percussions and guitar riffing which ends abruptly as the soothing 'Hope Leaves' begins.  This song is one of the high points of the album (there are 8 of them, meaning every single song), with melancholic vocals and beautifully crafted guitar riffs and bass lines as always.<br />I have played this album about 10 times since I got it yesterday, the day of its release, something I usually don't do since I own a considerable number of cds and I like to mix my daily listenings.  This may be a hint that Damnation is a diamond in the rough, begging to be discovered and appreciated.  Think I'll have to give a couple more spins in the days to come to realize it's full potential, because at first I was a little disapointed to see this effort falling short of the 'Still Day Beneath The Sun / Patterns In The Ivy II' mini cd, since 'Still Day Beneath The Sun' is in my opinion the most incredible song Opeth has penned.<br />There's Still Life in Opeth!

1558908323|4.0|This is a very well made horror movie!  It's not a classic, nor does it tread especially new ground, but it is moody, stylish, mostly well-acted, graphic, well designed and actually creepy.<br />It tells the story of a horrific monster that has bred in the subterranean areas of NYC's subway system.  I won't bore you with the details of how this monster came to be, but suffice it to say that these plot details are interesting and when we discover what the creature REALLY is, that's a nice surprise too.<br />Basically, the first half of the movie shows us the creature in action briefly, then all the \\"scientific\\" types urgently trying to figure out what they're dealing with, and then all the main characters converge to search the creature out within the subway labrynth.  And although it's been used before, the hidden chambers of the subway system (which are REALLY extensive in this film) make for great settings for running around and hiding from a murderous monster!  We watch as our band of heros are quickly reduced in size (a la ALIEN, PITCH BLACK and about 1 million other movies).<br />The opening few scenes of the movie, which show in quick brushstrokes how years before a terrible plague threatened the children of NY (and later, the cure for that plague would lead to the monster), are TRULY creepy. The editing and cinematography, along with some terrific art direction on a low budget, throw you emotionally into the movie right away!  After that, the movie is well-crafted but predictable.  Although predictable is probably what one wants when seeing this sort of movie.  It's like horror comfort food!<br />The movie features some unusual casting:  Jeremy Northam (the British actor most often seen in things like AN IDEAL HUSBAND, is quite convincing as a nervous, nerdy scientist...he's always good in whatever he does) and Charles Dutton are very good. Giancarlo Giannini (how did anyone think to put this great actor in this kind of movie) is actually quite moving as thefather of a little boy in the clutches of our villain.  Mira Sorvino is the star of the movie (which came fairly soon after her Oscar-winning role in MIGHTY APHRODITE).  In recent years, she has made a lot of bad choices for roles and has become something of [an object] of jokes.  However, in MIMIC she is competent (though not overwhelming) as a scientist, and certainly one would think she could have handled more dramatic roles well.  Finally, poor F. Murray Abraham plays her mentor in a thankfully tiny role...it's a horribly written part (the man rants and raves about tampering with nature) and he plays it as though he was told he had one minute flat to devour all the scenery.  He chews it like crazy, and we breathe a sigh of relief when he's no longer on screen.<br />I imagine the budget for the film was fairly low, but it's a great example of how effective lighting can be.  Genuine ATMOSPHERE is developed.  In one climatic scene set in an old subway car, all hell breaks lose, and we realize \\"hey, this has gotten pretty scary!\\"  What more can you ask of an old fashioned horror movie?<br />Is it brilliant?  No.  Is it entertaining in almost every way?  Yes.  I highly recommend it, though probably not for kids under 15 or so.  (AND STAY AWAY FROM THE \\"SEQUEL!\\"  YUCK!!)
B000084T18|4.0|This is an awesome CD.  Unlike most mainstream he actually has lyrics.  The beats are really catchy too.  The only reason I gave it a 4 was because he doesn't have much to say.
B00005JLD4|3.0|Poor character development ultimately makes this a mediocre film.<br />Nice story.  Will pull the heartstrings in places.  The cinematography is absolutely wonderful.<br />Unfortunately, this film is marred by almost cartoon character development.  The roles are so stereotypical that at times the movie seems a spoof.  All the white characters are made to be cold, heartless, arrogant; while all the aboriginal characters are wise and caring.  Shame, for this makes the movie come off so preachy and smarmy.<br />Add to that Branagh's almost lifeless performance.  Obviously he mailed this one in.<br />Worth renting, but not a compelling movie by any means.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This film simply pushes you off the edge and let's you dangle in terror as you try to wonder what the heck is going on? No one and I mean no one will find the true meaning of the film until they do some deep research! Outstanding Mr. Lynch!
B00008S2VG|3.0|Madonna's newest album has recieved the mixed reviews all of her albums get, most notably critics are comparing it with 1998's Ray of Light and 1989 Like A Prayer two works that seems to be the measuring rod that Madonna's work it measured against. <BR>So what is the \\"real deal\\" with American Life, is it Music part II, Madonna's acoustic record, or just a decent pop/dance collection. Well, its all of these and more...and less. Yes, it does very much take up where 2000's Music left off.  The Mirwais production and vocoder are definately here. Sometimes it works, sometimes it feels a little played out. There is certainly not the characteristic style change we have come to expect from Madonna (for ex: the difference between Like A Prayer and I'm Breathless or Bedtime Stories and Ray of Light) however, consistentcy in style is not always a bad thing. Madonna and Mirwais have crafted some fine dance/folk/pop here, not it is not completely different than Music, it instead builds on the vibe of \\"Gone\\", \\"I Deserve It\\", and \\"Paradise Not For Me\\". As a collection of songs I would say it passes the test and is definately worth the price of a cd. Madonna's sounds great and her guitar playing has definately grown since the Emmy days.<BR>On the down side, calling a cd \\"American Life\\" and pushing it as a look at American culture I would say it fails. There is some good social commentary here, \\"Amercian Life\\" and \\"Hollywood\\", but the rest of the songs seem more about \\"Madonna's Life\\". The exploration of social problems that we saw in Ray of Lights \\"Swim\\" or the feminist commentary of Music's \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" are not here.<BR>Madonna instead explore cultural values and expectations through the lens of her own life experiences (mainly love songs)- that is not to say the songs are bad, many of them are stand out tracks \\"Nothing Fails\\", \\"Love Profusion\\", and \\"X-Static Process\\" are all great tracks.<BR>One final note, the cd is also a little too short. With 10 new tracksand 2002's \\"Die Another Day\\" the album feels too small. There is definately room for expansion here. At least 2 or 3 more songs would give the album more depth (most Madonna cd's seems to average short.) With a large collection of unreleased material I am sure Madonna could have found a song or 2 to balance out this collection.<BR>All in all a good cd, that will grow on you!!!<BR>Good Job Madonna
B00008S2VG|4.0|Ok...here's the drift.  I bought the CD because I like Madonna and I think she rules as an artist and as an icon.  American Life consists of very danceable tunes and one or two slow songs.  It includes also the song \\"Die Another Day\\" from the soundtrack from the Motion Picture Die Another Day.  Musically, she has done a really good job, it features a fresh new sound (mostly dance with hints of rock, a lot of guitars), yet I don't know if it's me, but some songs ressemble the sounds from \\"Music\\", especially that guitar sound belonging to \\"Don't Tell Me\\".  Lyrically the album's not bad either but I was not completely satisfied, something missing.  Some highlights include American Life, where in my opinion she rocks when she attemps to flow at the end of the song, in Hollywood she sound like Shirley Manson's (Garbage) happier sister, Love Profusion has got me really hooked and is one of my favorites, Nobody Knows Me is really danceable, Nothing Fails is a nice song and I like the feeling the choir adds to the song, and obviously Die Another Day.  Why 4 stars? Because she's MADONNA, and for that only she deserves the 4! But listen to the Album, It's worth it ;)
B000089CJI|5.0|Child of the 80's? Enjoy music with layers?? Get this album!<br />WOW WOW WOW!! It is rare that I find a gem like this.  Postal Service has obvious allegiances to the 80's... Some Human League feel (especially track 4 \\"nothing better\\")...heavy electronica... the music has many layers and is quite complicated when you analyze it...but provides a seemless listening experience.<br />My favorite song on this album keeps changing... Currently it is track 9 \\"Brand New Colony\\" with AMAZING lyrics like: \\"I'll be the platform shoes and undo what heredity's done to you; you won't have to strain to look into my eyes... I'll be your winter coat buttoned and zipped straight to the throat with the collar up so you won't catch cold...\\"<br />Buy this one!!! Enjoy!!! Tell your friends!! They will thank you... mine all did!!

Ms Quinn continues to draw her reads into the wonderfully peopled stories she writes.  Giving us laughter and sadness and triumphs.
B00008OLYN|5.0|This album is amazing!  You know its going to be a masterpeice when Steve Wilson helps them produce it (as he did with Blackwater Park, and Deliverance).  Steve Wilson even wrote the lyrics to one song! Now you have a huge influence of Porcupine Tree in Opeth's music, whats next?<BR>  Martin Lopez's drum work is amazing, as is Martin Mendez's bass work.  I am glad that the band took a new route with their musicianship.  There are still amazing blues riffs and Akerfeldts voice never ceases to impress me, and the violin gives it an increasingly eerie tone.  If you dont own an Opeth album yet, buy this one!
B00004XPPB|5.0|Yeah, another mob movie but this time with Pacino and .... Depp. A good combination for a movie but a mob movie made alot of optimists pure pessimists but since this is based on a true story and the Special Edition shows an interview with the man the movie was based on this movie has alot more. Anne Heche is hot in this one and she plays Depp's wife (for sure she ain't a lesbian! Jus' look at how she grabs Depp, hahaha)Anyways I ain't gonna say anything about this movie cause if you like movies with a mob member in it or even the word 'mafia' in it than this movie is for your bad self!
B00008S2VG|4.0|It seems like there's a lot to follow up on especially when your last two albums sold a combined 30 million worldwide. But for Madonna, she has surpassed her own expectations to feel the pressure of creating another bestseller.<br /><br />I listened to American Life without my expectations. At first listen, this is definitely Madonna's least exuberant album to date, but correspondingly, it's also her most introspective since Ray Of Light. While Music revels in a boisterous and celebratory mood, American Life settles for sobriety and somberness.<br /><br />The tracks here are equally split among techno and acoustic-guitar tracks. The title track, which has received numerous panning in the last few weeks, is actually a funky number on Madonna's present state of mind and values, along the lines of Music. The deliberate mismatch of styles (big beats versus acoustic chorus) might not have rubbed well with listeners and critics but it is refreshing nonetheless. As for the rap, some think it's laughable (I think it's unnecessary) but it can be best described as a satire on the popular rap culture stateside. If the original version does nothing for you, watch out for the extensive remixes which feature several top-notch re-works!<br /><br />Several other techno tracks exist on the album. I'm Stupid begins with the fuzzy vocal of M, followed by a Don't Tell Me-like hook and eventually breaks out into a semi-rock song of sorts, the sort of thing that Garbage might be putting out. Nobody Knows Me is a little dance tune punctuated with all the electronic ducks and effects but the vocoder is slightly overused here. The most notable upbeat song here must be Madonna's tribute to her mum Mother and Father. Featuring a funky melody, the song begins with an auto-tuned child-like Madonna voice that sings out her childhood sentiments. This is followed by an infectious chorus and great beats lace the song. If to fault the song, there could only be the slight overuse of the vocoder and the irrelevant rap towards the end.<br /><br />I guess the greatest tracks here are really the ballads. There are several of them - Love Profusion, Intervention, Nobody Fails, X-Static Process and Easy Rider. Though some of the lyrics seem a little too cloying for your liking, one could only take it as Madonna's pledge of love to Guy Ritchie and hr kids. The trilogy of excellent songs is Nobody Fails, X-Static Process and Easy Rider.<br /><br />Nobody Fails is a haunting ballad written with Guy Sigsworth and could arguably be the best track on American Life. When Madonna sings about how nobody fails, and no fears exist anymore, you can hear the strength in her voice which ultimately soars to a height with the gospel choir, akin to the one in Like A Prayer, though not matching the epic yet. Still, it is a very moving and captivating song. X-Static Process features very minimal instrumentation from Mirwais, just Madonna's voice and the guitar. The stripped-down effect complements Madonna's slightly yearning voice to perfection. And in the closer, Easy Ride, Madonna reveals the full vulnerability of missing out on the simplest things in life and how much she really longs for them. Breathtaking. It seems like Madonna has perfected the art of writing good closing songs (think Mer Girl and Gone).<br /><br />In the end, the overall slowdown in pace on this album signals a change in Madonna's direction in life and emotions. Mirwais may have run his course on this album as he's just practicing old tricks here, but luckily Madonna has found some way out of this limitation. It takes a little getting used to here, but you'll be drawn in no less.<br />3.5/5relevant rap towards the end.<br /><BR>I guess the greatest tracks here are really the ballads.

0671578278|4.0|Miles Vorkosigan is at it again, merrily planning (and attempting to execute) a very exacting military campaign. The only trouble is, the military objective is inducing his new-found lady love Ekaterin to marry him. His plan includes notable pieces of strategy: not to be too obvious about it, as she is still in mourning for her late husband (see the earlier book Komarr for details); keep other suitors well away; make sure there are frequent opportunities for the two to be in each other's presence; ensure that she becomes aware of all the niceties that would entail from marrying into one of the noblest families on Barrayar.  Each piece of his plan, though, runs into one minefield after another, and as he puts emergency stop-losses in place, his situation continuously deteriorates, culminating in a dinner where absolutely everything goes wrong.<br />The dinner may be the high point of this book - the person who can read this section and not fall over laughing, cringing, and crying all at the same time isn't a real human being. For this book is not about military action, political plots, or single-handed world-saving, but is rather a very witty comedy. The picture of Miles making just about every mistake a lovelorn suitor can is both marvelously funny and very believable, and the picture of Barrayaran society is solidly fleshed out, making the whole a perfect environment in which to play out such a comedy of manners.  As usual, Bujold keeps several plot threads spinning at once, whose resolution, while (for once) not at all earth-shaking, makes for a nicely unified wholeness to the basic story.<br />In another departure for Bujold, this story is told from several viewpoints, not just Miles', which adds a lot to the reader's perspective of the society and situation, and also allows for much greater character development of Ivan Vorpatril, Mark (Miles' clone brother), and Ekaterin than has been the case with previous books in this series.<br />Perhaps my only real objection to this book was that some of the side plots from the main story just didn't seem to have enough importance and weren't detailed enough to make me really get involved with them, so that their major effect on the final outcome seemed to be larger than justified and a little bit of a surprise. This is a pretty minor quibble, though. Nominated for the 2000 Hugo award, this is a fine entertaining read, full of chuckles and belly-laughs, managing to make Miles into a normal human being without totally losing his aura of impossible competence, engaging and heart-warming. Possibly the best of all the Vorkosigan books.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)ection to this book was that some of the side plots from the main story just didn't seem to have enough importance and weren't detailed enough to make me really get involved with them, so that their major effect on the final outcome seemed to be larger than justified and a little bit of a surprise.

B00008S2VH|5.0|Well, first of all, I'd like to ask why in the world does this album have a PARENTAL ADVISORY label? There isnt any graphic content (If you dont count the F word in Amercan Life. Well, Bene one day since I got this album, so heres a quick rundown of the Tracks:<br />AMERICAN LIFE: Her 1st single. Getting a little tired of it, but a GREAT song afterwards. 5/5<br />Hollywood: Cool song. Kinda reminds me of DONT TELL ME, but a lil more \\"techno\\"-e 5/5<br />I'm SO Stupid: one of my favorites on this album. Cool track 4.3/5<br />Love Profusion: Same as previous Track 4/5 <br />Nobody Knows Me: THIS IS THE BEST TRACK (in my opinion) ON THE WHOLE ALBUM. Reminds me of IMPRESSIVE INSTANT off her previous. This is something that she could have performed on her Drowned tour. (Which is an AWESOME DVD I would recommend) 100/100<br />Nothing Fails: Really a cool, nice song. 5/5<br />Intervention: Same as above. 4.5/5<br />X-Static Process: One of my least favorites, but still, Madonna does it Great. 4/5<br />Mother and Father: At first, Just by the title, I thought it would be a \\"ballad\\" of some sort. Nope nope. Cool small lil techno-ish. Electric \\"piano\\", you can say. 4/5<br />Die Another Day: The so called \\"worst bond theme\\". I dont think it is! Heard it many times, but its good to hear once in a while 4.8/5<br />Easy Ride: PERFECT SONG to end this album with. It hasnt been an \\"Easy Ride\\" for her, and it never is for anyone. 6/5<br />OVERALL: Madonna keeps her head (and everything else) in this game! This album is worth the money. With THIS Limited Edition, you alse get a double-sided poster and a small sheet of stamps.

On \\"MTV Unplugged,\\" KISS not only tugs the heart strings, but proves they had the chops as a band all along. They have two of the expected songs here (\\"Beth\\" and \\"RnR All Night\\") but for the most part they re-tool some of the more obscure numbers. I have always considered \\"A World Without Heroes\\" to be Gene's best song, and on \\"Unplugged,\\" it's a stand out.<br />There's also genuine joy in the air. \\"Coming Home\\" opens things here, making this \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" track take on a whole new definition. Stanley is very at home in this setting, and his voice is a much better instrument than many people have given him credit for. Listen to his emoting on \\"I Still Want You,\\" which becomes a ballad with power instead of a mere power ballad!<br />Even by the end of the show, when they bring out the \\"members of the family,\\" the level of excitement is as high as a bunch of grown men revisiting their glory days can get. Ace is obviously thrilled to get another stab at \\"2000 Man,\\" and Peter just wails on \\"Nothing To Lose.\\" It's enough to make you forgive them the way too obvious closing of \\"Rock And Roll All Night.\\" But as far as KISS' live albums go, this is the one I'd choose to listen to after the first \\"Alive!\\" It's really that good.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|This is a really really fun movie and I have watched it for the sixth time already cause it's that good! First off remember that you will probably find this movie in the Horror sections and that is very true! This is a horror movie but I like the fact that the directors of the film realized that they had a really cool location to film a creepy style B-Movie and used all of the advantages that came to them after deciding to make this masterpiece. Anyways you should watch this movie cause it's a nice slice of Americana and how creativity can be limited and still have an astounding effect on the audience.
B00006LLNV|5.0|There are musical soundtracks that are lost in celluloid after the movie experience is over and than there are soundtracks like this. The music recreates the movie experience and has a life of it's own with this soundtrack. Beginning with the opening track by Lila Downs, her of the uncannny resemblance to Frida and three octave range, &quot;Benediction and Dream,&quot; the listener is transported on a magical musical journey to a far away land close to your heart and soul. The lovely Lila Downs performs several other tracks including &quot;Alcoba Azul &quot;( The Blue Room&quot;) from the memorable tango scene between Tina Mondotti and Frida, a brief incantation on &quot;Estrella Oscura&quot; ( &quot;Dark Star&quot;),  the haunting Mariachi version of &quot;La Llorona&quot;( &quot;The Weeping Woman&quot;) and the fiery melodic finale duet with Brazilian singer Caetano Veloso entitled &quot;Burn it Blue&quot; (&quot;Quememos La En Azul&quot;). Selma Hayek also lends her vocal talents to a rambuntious version of &quot;La Bruja&quot;( &quot;The Witch&quot;) that is great. There are so many good songs that all cannot be mentioned . It would be wrong to not mention the eerie version of &quot;La Llorona&quot; by the legendary Chavela Vargas as it is superb. There are excellent huapangos, trios  and just pure musical genius  composed by award winner Elliot Goldenthal that you will enjoy. You will love this festive, at times melancholic, at other times dreamy variety of Mexican folkloric music. Besides the fantasic music an additional bonus is the fact that this CD is enhanced for your viewing and listening pleasure on your computer. The enhaced features are very cool. The booklet is also very nice with pictures from the movie and complete bilingual lyrics to all the music. If you haven't seen the movie check it out; whether you have seen the movie or not this disc will create cinematic hues for your listening experience. A highly recommended disc for fans of  a variety of Mexican musical styles.Mexican musical styles.
B00008S2VH|5.0|This album is phenominal!!!<BR>It is kind of a mix of Ray of Light and Music, yet has it's own style as well.<br />The album is really deep. She talks about things that you have never heard her talk about.<br />I never thought I would ever hear out of Madonna's lips that she was stupid, or pulling a video to make sure her daughter and husband are not compromised in any way.<BR>She has truly grown up and her voice has grown with her wisdom.<br />A+
0316666343|5.0|This is one of the bost books I have ever read, and it has now been leant to many people.  It is emotionally very difficult to read, and I don't think I would have ever picked up this book if it had not been asigned in a psychology class.  I am one of thoes people who usually has to make themselves read, but this book was so good I couldn't put it down.  Thoes of you who have given less than a five to this product have not bothered to read it front to cover and if you have, you just don't know a good thing when it is put right infront of your face!  I would recomend this book to anyone mature enough to read explicit context.
B00008S2VH|5.0|Well, first of all, I'd like to ask why in the world does this album have a PARENTAL ADVISORY label? There isnt any graphic content (If you dont count the F word in Amercan Life. If thats the reason, why doesnt Aguilera have one for saying more than that on her album. Oh well....) Well, It's Been one day since I got this album, so heres a quick rundown of the Tracks:<br />AMERICAN LIFE: Her 1st single. Getting a little tired of it, but a GREAT song afterwards. 5/5<br />Hollywood: Cool song. Kinda reminds me of DONT TELL ME, but a lil more \\"techno\\"-e 5/5<br />I'm SO Stupid: one of my favorites on this album. Cool track 4.3/5<br />Love Profusion: Same as previous Track 4/5 <br />Nobody Knows Me: THIS IS THE BEST TRACK (in my opinion) ON THE WHOLE ALBUM. Reminds me of IMPRESSIVE INSTANT off her previous. This is something that she could have performed on her Drowned tour. (Which is an AWESOME DVD I would recommend) 100/100<br />Nothing Fails: Really a cool, nice song. 5/5<br />Intervention: Same as above. 4.5/5<br />X-Static Process: One of my least favorites, but still, Madonna does it Great. 4/5<br />Mother and Father: At first, Just by the title, I thought it would be a \\"ballad\\" of some sort. Nope nope. Cool small lil techno-ish. Electric \\"piano\\", you can say. 4/5<br />Die Another Day: The so called \\"worst bond theme\\". I dont think it is! Heard it many times, but its good to hear once in a while 4.8/5<br />Easy Ride: PERFECT SONG to end this album with. It hasnt been an \\"Easy Ride\\" for her, and it never is for anyone. 6/5<br />OVERALL: Madonna keeps her head (and everything else) in this game! This album is worth the money. With THIS Limited Edition, you alse get a double-sided poster and a small sheet of stamps.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|this is a great album,it has dance songs such as not gonna get us,all the things she said, and clowns plus malchick gay and has some great ballads like show me love, 30 minutes etc. these girls are talented they show they are fearless of their relationship.keep it up t.A.T.u.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000006TRV|4.0|This album is really not as good as you may hear, it certainly doesn't hold a candle to WISH YOU WERE HERE (which is my personal favorite) or ANIMALS. There are some very impressive tracks from THE WALL, but not enough to be called Pink Floyd's greatest album. There are too many sketchy points in this album, it's not as strong or as consistent as some of their earlier works. I find myself skipping through most of the songs because either they're too bland and insipid, or they're exactly like the song I just heard. Some of the highlights of THE WALL are &quot;In the Flesh&quot;, &quot;Hey You&quot;, and &quot;Goodbye Blue Sky&quot;. I'm not saying THE WALL is horrible or even bad, I'm just saying that this is not the first Pink Floyd album you should go for. I think that you should get familiar with Pink Floyd before you listen to THE WALL, only fans of Pink can truly appreciate it.
B000084T18|5.0|When I originally heard \\"How To Rob\\" from the \\"In Too Deep\\" soundtrack, I liked the song and the clever wordplay involved, but I wondered if 50 Cent had enough to carry a whole album.  Rappers like Jay Z, Ghostface Killah, Sticky Fingaz from Onyx and others weren't too pleased with what 50 had to say and they came out with their own things to say about the song.   Just as 50 was about to record his 1st single from \\"Power Of The Dollar\\", \\"Thug Love\\" w/Destiny's Child, 50 was shot multiple times.    After he recovered, 50 called his label and they acted as if 50 had never even existed.   To reestablish himelf, 50 hit the mixtape circuit and would appear on various mixtapes freestyling or with songs that were supposed to appear on \\"Power Of The Dollar\\".   In early 2002, Full Clip Records released \\"Guess Who's Back\\" which included underground songs and freestyles that included 50, G Unit, Nas, Nature, The Bravehearts and Bun B of UGK on different tracks.  Shortly after that, 50 Cent & G Unit released several mixed Cds and the buzz definitely had been recreated.  Eminem heard \\"Guess Who's Back\\" after he completed \\"The Eminem Show\\" and that was the beginning of 50 Cent being signed to Eminem's Shady Records.   50 Cent's popular mix tape track, \\"Wanksta\\" appeared on Eminem's \\"8 Mile\\" soundtrack, as well as,  \\"Places To Go\\" and \\"Love Me\\" which was  a collaboration with Eminem, 50 Cent and Obie Trice.   These songs and the mixed CDs were enough to keep 50 out in the streets until his highly anticipated CD, \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying\\", was released.   When \\"In Da Club\\" was released to radio and started appearing on MTV and BET, 50's CD was definitely going to be in demand.  Dr. Dre's club banger had everyone sayig \\"Go, go, go, go, go..\\".  The song would propel \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying\\" with over 800,000 units sold in the first four days of its release.  The CD gets off a nice start with \\"What's Up Gangsta\\".  Fans of 50's street releases will definitely like this track.  Next up is \\"Patiently Waiting\\" as Eminem and 50 collaborate on the Eminem produced track.   50 and Eminem rip the track to shreds.  On \\"Many Men (Wish Death)\\", 50 speaks about how after being shot multiple times, how he reflects on things and how your enemies and people that are jealous of you are always plotting behind your back.   This is one of \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying's\\" best tracks.   Dr. Dre shows up again to produce the passion filled \\"Heat\\".   50 is back in street mode once again and has an anthem for anyone that wants to come at him and his G Unit crew.  \\"If I Can't\\" is more of a radio friendly Dre song but you will forget the commercial appeal of the song once you hear 50 rhyming to the track.   \\"Back Down\\" has 50 speaking on his long term beef with Ja Rule.   This is the CD's best track, in my opinion, as 50 says, \\"You're a pop tart, sweetheart, you're soft in the middle...\\".   Since then there have been several back and forth disses with the latest being \\"Hail Mary 2003\\" with Eminem, 50 Cent & Busta Rhymes.  The 2nd single, \\"21 Questions\\" with Nate Dogg is an ode for the ladies that will definitely continue to keep \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying\\" on the charts for awhile.  \\"Don't Push Me\\" w/Lloyd Banks of G Unit and Eminem, has 50 Cent rapping a little too much like 2 Pac for some people.   I like the song as the rappers flow lovely to the Eminem's beat.  \\"Poor Lil Rich\\" is a Sha Money XL track that plans keep 50 in heavy club rotation along with the aforementioned \\"In Da Club\\" and \\"P.I.M.P\\".    The only song that you will have to fast forward, in my opinion, is \\"Blood Hound\\" with Young Buck as it sounds like DMX is barking throughout the whole song. \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying\\" also includes \\"Wanksta\\", \\"U Not Like Me\\", and \\"Life's On The Line\\" as bonus tracks, but loyal 50 fans have heard these tracks already.   50 recently released a DVD, \\"The New Breed\\" that included a bonus CD with 3 tracks:  \\"True Loyalty\\" with G Unit, \\"8 Mile Road\\" (G Unit Remix)with G Unit, and the Dr. Dre produced \\"In Da Hood\\" with Brooklyn.  To anyone who doesn't know G Unit is 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck, Bang 'Em Smurf and a cast of other characters.  G Unit recently signed with Interscope Records, so a G Unit CD and a Lloyd Banks solo CD should be out by the end of the year and expect a new 50 Cent CD by February 2004.   For 50 Cent the sky is the limit.   If you judge \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying\\" by just \\"In Da Club\\" and \\"21 Questions\\" then you will be saddenly mistakened.   This CD has more than club friendly songs on it.  Fans of 50's street anthems will enjoy this CD as well.  I wonder how Columbia feels now that 50 Cent has sold more than 4 million records in 10 weeks?   I would advise you to get \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying\\" and \\"Guess Who's Back\\" to start your 50 library.   FREE YAYO!!!!<br />James' Top 5<br />1) Back Down<BR>2) Many Men (Wish Death)<BR>3) P.I.M.P<BR>4) What Up Gangsta<BR>5) 21 Questions w/Nate Dogg
0316666343|4.0|I read this book in fairly short amount of time. I didn't want it to be over, I liked it that much. Some of the characters and ideas are a little predictable, but still a good book. Readers may like it who have just experienced a death in the family and are looking for some hope.
B00008S2VG|5.0|What to expect from the greatest pop idols the world has ever seen in her tenth studio album? <BR>well what we get is a beautifully crafted, solid, introspective tale of Madonna's current state of mind.  A mixture of styles runs through the album, working on various levels... The glorious 'Nothing Fails' being the absoulte highlight and her best work in over a decade; in fact the voice we hear on many of the tracks on the album sound that pop godess the world loved.  <BR>with 2000's music, it was dancy, but artifical and bland... <BR>American Life sees a return to form.  There is such a range of great tracks here.  Each a mixture of her new sounds and her old melodies.<BR>The LA pop trash of 'Hollywood', the folk electric marvels, 'love profusion' and 'intervention'.  the inventive ballad of 'x-static process' and the great gem of a track which is 'mother and father', with perhaps the best hook she has come up with in years.  <BR>the album could've have done without Die another Day though.<br />Hope she tours this one.<br />best trax - nothing fails; mother and father; & hollywood
B000059TPN|4.0|Since several other reviewers have already talked about the movie, I just wanted to mention the extras that you get with this DVD collection.<br />The Rock is a great movie by far, and if you own a surround sound system, this is definitely a great DVD to get.  The extras on the DVD, however, are disappointing.  Most of them look like they were filmed at the last minute and done by a second rate studio.  For example I really wanted to see the \\"Do's and Don't's of Hollywood Gun Play.\\"  It was very difficult to hear it however, since they filmed it at a gun range when people were firing.  The \\"Out Takes\\" were not at all funny; most of them were Ed Harris screwing up his lines and yelling at Director Michael Bay.<br />If you must have The Rock on DVD and can't find it anywhere else for a lower price, go ahead and get it.  But only get it for the movie, the extras aren't worth the price.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Ok, let's face it. This CD will get a LOT of bad reviews (namely from ignorant people who automatically assume that this album is anti-American and anti-Bush). But I will give this CD a fair, and good review, because it's well... a good CD! This album is somewhat dark and dreary when it comes to the meanings behind the songs... There's not one happy song on here, but they are ALL so good! I sense a mid-life crisis thing going on here, but that just gives Madge more inspiration...<br />1. American Life (10/10) - The first single. You either love it or you hate it. We've all heard it by now, of course. I personally think it's a genius song, and that Madonna made a right choice by making this the first single. She should NOT have pulled the video though! The original video is so great. (I PERSONALLY LOVE MADONNA'S RAP! =D)<br />2. Hollywood (8/10) - The second single. It's upbeat, acoustic, with hints of electronic usage. The lyrics are very depressing, reflecting upon the dark side of Hollywood people choose to ignore. Very summery, and a great choice for the second single. The only bad part of the song is near the end, Madonna repeats this one line, but each time she sounds more like a man...and it's kinda creepy.<br />3. I'm So Stupid (9/10) - This self-degrading song is pure genius. It's acoustic with a lot of techno influence, and it's got a dark feeling to it. The intro overshadows the rest of the song however, with it's soft singing and light guitar stringing. However, there's something in the beginning of the song that might hurt your ears... you'll see what I mean... and no, your CD player isn't broken.<br />4. Love Profusion (9/10) - Another folky guitar song. This one is really sweet though, and actually incredibly catchy. It's a little sadder than the previous tracks, and has somewhat of more prominant techno influence. The best part is near the middle where she sings \\"I've got you under my skin\\" over and over. Great meaning about loving everyone for who they are.<br />5. Nobody Knows Me (10/10) - Er... ok... This song is a very bizarre one, but it's actually one of the best on here. It's an upbeat, electronic, club song. I love dancing to this, and I've only had it for a day. It sounds a lot more like jumbled sound effects than an actual instrumentation. It comes out being genius though. I hope this is a single!<br />6. Nothing Fails (10/10) - WHOA! This song is AMAZING! It starts off a simple guitar love song... but wow... this is undescribable... it slowly escalates into a giant ballad with a choir and violens. This is amazing... it's slated to be the third single, and I sure hope it is! I love the line \\"I'm not religious, but I feel so good...\\" Spine chilling!<br />7. Intervention (10/10) - All of the best tracks were shoved near the end! Very unique tracklisting. This song is so simple, yet so incredibly sweet. It's probably one of the darkest on here (Tied with Mother And Father and Easy Ride). It's so beautiful... It's so true too. It's about how love can save you from anything, if you let it...<br />8. X-Static Process (8/10) - The most folky song on here... funny, because with this name it seems like it'd be a club song. I really don't like it that much, but the lryics are pretty. It's about religion, and struggling with it. The best lyric on here, period, is \\"I always wished I could find someone as beautiful as you, but in the process I forgot that I was special too...\\"<br />9. Mother And Father (10/10) - WOW! 80's influenced electro/funk! Even if it sounds A LOT like Kylie Minogue's \\"Fever\\" (The song, not the album), it's so GENIUS! It's really depressing if you listen to the lyrics and think about them... it's about losing your mother. Madonna raps here too, but it's somewhat more sparatic than on American Life.<br />10. Die Another Day (10/10) - I liked this song from the moment I heard it, and even now I still like! I'll agree, it wasn't meant to be a Bond song, but it's still a great dance song. We've all heard this, so no need to go into detail. This IS the full version however (You know, the one in the video).<br />11. Easy Ride (10/10) - MY FAVORITE TRACK PERIOD! The DARKEST and DEEPEST song on here! It is so depressing! I love it, it's so beautiful, and... wow I just can't describe how amazing this song is. It's orchestrated, and... WOW I JUST CAN'T DESCRIBE THIS! You SO need to hear this song! There's definately some Frozen influence going on here too. BEST TRACK.<br />In conclusion, I highly suggest you buy this. It IS NOT ANTI-AMERICAN! Don't believe all that in magazines, TV, radio, etc... it's all lies. It's really amazing, and incredibly soulful and deep. There's no enhanced section though =( that was a lie. lol.
B00005JLEU|5.0|. . . nor do I particularly like child-hero fantasy works, but this is so good it should be seen by everyone.  The animation is stunning, I guess that doesn't need to be said, and even if the overall story is a little cutesey for my tastes, the individual scenes present such novel visions to the senses that the film had me engaged throughout.<br />My favorite part was the brief presentation of the &quot;real world&quot;, roads and traffic and such.  My goodness, that was fine, I'd love to see Miyazaki do a film that wasn't set in a fantasy realm, just to see his renditions of cities and streets and real people doing normal things.  His attention to detail would really shine in a setting like that.<br />It's been stressed below, but it deserves to be said again:  Do NOT see the English language version, it will ruin it for you.  The Japanese language version with (excellent) English subtitles is the only way this should be seen.  That's true even though by all accounts this is one of the better adaptations into English.  But it's still horrible in comparision, don't do it to yourself!  You've been warned.
B000084T18|4.0|i get tired of hearing people say they dont like artists anymore, as soon as the artist gets popular. the way i rate an album is the playback value. this one is very high, i can listen to &quot;what up gangsta&quot; &quot;many men&quot; &quot;heat&quot; &quot;back down&quot; &quot;p.i.m.p&quot; &quot;wanksta&quot; over and over again, the rest of the album hits too. look owwt 4 Obie Trice in '03
B00006879E|5.0|When I first heard Maroon 5 I immediately wanted their CD \\"Songs About Jane\\". When I finally did get it, (had to order it online, since they were even less known than they are now at the time. What a shame, too!) I sampled all of the tracks, and found I loved them all! This was really odd for me, since it usually takes a few run-throughs for me to like the songs of a new artist or band, but not so with Maroon 5! They have such an original sound: who would have thought mixing R&B rhythms with alternative rock would produce something so good. If you get a chance to pick up this album, I HIGHLY, HIGHLY suggest you see them in concert! I saw them in a little teen center in Augusta, Maine (and I mean little. I could extend my arm and take the hat off of Mickey Madden's head) and it was one of the best concerts I've been to. These guys know what they're doing, they've been doing what they have for a long time. If you're looking for a varied sound, with crisp melodies and lyrics, Maroon 5 is the band for you. Take it from someone who knows what she's talking about! I also suggest you pick up their album \\"The Fourth World,\\" released under their old name \\"Kara's Flowers\\". Though it's out of print, due to label changes, you can still get it used.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I have concluded that the people who write reviews for newspapers must be in an orchestrated conspiracy to trash Madonna at every opportunity they can. Obviously, there is no newspaper reviewer who has actually listened to American Life more than once, if at all. Their transparent and intentionally vicious reviews show just how out of touch they are with the industry they review. To these individuals, Madonna cannot do anything right.<br />Anyway, I will admit, when I first heard the single American Life, I was a bit numb; I was not quite sure what to think of it. However, while it has in fact grown on me, it is not my favorite on the album. Now that I have had an entire day to listen to this CD, I have decided that it is one of my all time favorite Madonna compilations. For me, it ranks up there with Ray of Light. <br />Unlike Music, this CD is very listenable and full of potential singles. My favorite tracks are Easy Ride, Love Profusion and Mother  & Father. This CD harkens back to her first album, Madonna. There is a definite techno/disco thing going on here. Her very first single Everybody comes to mind on more than one track. <br />I have read comparisons made between American Life and Music; I completely disagree. While there is a plethora of guitar, the composure of the songs is more mature and complex. Particularly in the songs Nothing Fails and Easy Ride, the combination of a techno beat, guitar and string instruments is quite soothing. I absolutely love it; I just wish there were a couple of more songs.  <br />If you a die-hard Madonna fan, this is a must for your collection. If you are an occasional Madonna fan, I think you will like this album, especially if you liked Ray of Light. If you are not really a Madonna fan but get into the rhythms and beats of techno, you should find something you like on this CD.
0316666343|2.0|I started off reading this book with much enthusiasm and interest. The premise was captivating and Alice Sebold is a good writer. I could really sense the pain of the family and Sebold does a good job of providing hints of what it must feel like to be dead while watching the world go on below you. I even liked her basic concept of heaven (it jived with some basic concepts found in orthodox Christianity, meaning it had some elements of truth).<br />However, the book soon descended into a typical, baby-boomer lamentation about the plight of repressed suburbanite women (and their justifiable adultery), the superiority of smart and artistic people, and the absolute normality and goodness of sexual encounters, no matter what age or what circumstance.<br />Every author has an agenda, but not only did I disagree with Sebold's post-modern feminist outlook on life, I was annoyed by the ham-handed way in which she injected it into the narrative once she ran out of good story ideas.<br />Great premise, poor execution.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is great! Its nice when you buy a cd and enjoy listening to the whole thing. I bought this cd yesterday and have listened to it 5 times in that time.. Awesome music, what a voice you can feel the words.
B000089CJI|5.0|WOW WOW WOW!! It is rare that I find a gem like this.  Postal Service has obvious allegiances to the 80's... Some Human League feel (especially track 4 \\"nothing better\\")...heavy electronica... the music has many layers and is quite complicated when you analyze it...but provides a seemless listening experience.<br />My favorite song on this album keeps changing... Currently it is track 9 \\"Brand New Colony\\" with AMAZING lyrics like: \\"I'll be the platform shoes and undo what heredity's done to you; you won't have to strain to look into my eyes... I'll be your winter coat buttoned and zipped straight to the throat with the collar up so you won't catch cold...\\"<br />Buy this one!!! Enjoy!!! Tell your friends!! They will thank you... mine all did!!
B00008S2VG|5.0|Back in 1982 we all remember her first single Everybody. From there she led us through controversey, eye-catching videos, fun songs, sad songs, songs about sex, and took us through some spiritual times.<br />21 years later after her big break Madonna never seems to surprise us with her new album American Life. I Must say its one of her best albums to date. With 10 new tracks of spirituality and \\"Die Another Day\\" this album will make you dance, wonder and reflect on yourself. After listening to this album it is confirmed Madonna has finally grown up from her younger days. The track \\"American Life\\" is definatly the winner here. \\"Hollywood\\" is a Sheryl Crow type song and is so different yet so awesome for Madonna. \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" is an amazing dance track and also has a good message with it. \\"Mother and Father\\" is a song about her mother and how unfortunate it was to have lost her at such a young age. <br />I really recommend this album to everyone Madonna fan or Not! It really brings out the little Madonna we have in all of us!
B00005JLEU|5.0|I am a total animeeeee Freak!  This is such an awesome movie.  It is great for any one, any age.  <BR>The story is good but hard to explain in this review.  The animation is good, really good.  <BR>It is a really good movie.  Add it to your anime or dvd collection.
B00008S2VG|4.0|It's not as good as RAY OF LIGHT, but it's definitely slightly better than MUSIC.<br />AMERICAN LIFE-The track we all know. Anyone who could call this song anti-war, anti-bush isn't listening; they're just judging. She doesn't even HINT towards any war. She talks about how superficial us Americans are. I appreciate her message, she's so right. All you people with your lattes and cell phones set to vibrate and shoving your busyness in other peoples' faces need to get your attention directed to more important things. Hey, don't get mad at me. THAT'S WHAT THE SONG'S ABOUT. 9/10<br />HOLLYWOOD-Segued from American Life, Hollywood is a story about people trying to make it...guess where! I don't like how she sings the song (sounds like she's holding her nose), but the lyrics are great. She talks about how cruel Hollywood can be even though it seems like a place where dreams will come true. She talks about how radio stations always play the same song and the question: How can it hurt you when it looks so good? 9/10<br />I'M SO STUPID-The background sounds are really annoying and her voice is not it's best but you get used to it. The lyrics are really excellent, however. She really doesn't seem to like the Madonna of the past. Indeed, she believes she was &quot;stupider than stupid&quot; (and I know some people who agree with her). She deserves points for coming clean on that one for sure! 8/10<br />LOVE PROFUSION-An excellently restrained vocal performance and pretty good lyrics. Nice guitar-playing. The lyrics are a little hard to understand, however, though they flow well. Pretty good song. 7/10<br />NOBODY KNOWS ME-Another pretty good track. The music in the background is again annoying, but the lyrics are great and the vocal dubbing is done well. Indeed, &quot;it's no good when we're misunderstood&quot;, and nobody knows Madonna. They just don't, and that's all there is to it. 7/10<br />NOTHING FAILS-Another nice piece of guitar-playing. More great lyrics. &quot;It was not a chance meeting Feel my heart beating You're the one You could take all this Take it away I'd still have it all Cuz I've climbed the tree of life And that is why No longer scared if I fall If I get lost in space I can return to this place Cuz you're the one Nothing fails No more fears You washed away my tears&quot;. 8/10<br />INTERVENTION-Good lyrics and a very good vocal performance from the middle onward. Still, the song drags on a little bit. If it moved along a little faster and had been worked on a little more, it's point would have been made quite a bit more clearly. 8/10<br />X-STATIC PROCESS-Excellent excellent excellent! She reflects on her connection with Jesus. &quot;Don't really know if I should give a damn When you're around I don't know who I am I always wished that I could find someone as beautiful as you But in the process I forgot that I was special too&quot; Very moving, very saddening. Makes you think. 10/10<br />MOTHER AND FATHER-Extremely excellent again! She reflects on her relationships with her mother and father and her childhood. &quot;There was a time I was happy in my life, believed I'd live forever There was time I prayed to Jesus Christ There was a time I had a mother it was nice...Nobody else could ever take the place of you&quot;. She also apologizes to her father. He tried, really he did. She just didn't understand where he was coming from and that he didn't know to react. Just beautiful. She comes clean. This is Madonna uncensored. 10/10<br />DIE ANOTHER DAY-The Bond theme we all know and love. Just like her Top 40 hit SPOTLIGHT, I believe this song is as much a personal anthem for her as it is the movie's. If you didn't buy the Soundtrack to the album but bought the CD maxi only like myself, then you won't find anything new. It pretty much just drags on a little slower towards the end of the track. Still, a great addition to the disc thought it hardly fits with the other 10 cuts. Anyone notice how it seems to borrow some of the music from PAPA DON'T PREACH? 9/10<br />EASY RIDE-She talks about how she wants a good life but she doesn't want an easy ride. She wants to feel &quot;blood and sweat on her fingertips&quot;. She wants to find her place, breathe the air and feel the sun on her childrens' face. Nice guitar-playing, if a slightly less than inspired vocal performance. Good song all in all-it makes its point. 7/10<br />All in all, for a Madonna fan, this album is great. It holds to the formula she's been following the past five years while still, you feel she's clearly going into a new direction, and that new directions are to come in the future.<br />Madonna, you've done it again.e music from PAPA DON'T PREACH? 9/10<br />EASY RIDE-She talks about how she wants a good life but she doesn't want an easy ride.

B000089CJI|5.0|Child of the 80's? Enjoy music with layers?? Get this album!<br />WOW WOW WOW!! It is rare that I find a gem like this.  Postal Service has obvious allegiances to the 80's... Some Human League feel (especially track 4 \\"nothing better\\")...heavy electronica... the music has many layers and is quite complicated when you analyze it...but provides a seemless listening experience.<br />My favorite song on this album keeps changing... Currently it is track 9 \\"Brand New Colony\\" with AMAZING lyrics like: \\"I'll be the platform shoes and undo what heredity's done to you; you won't have to strain to look into my eyes... I'll be your winter coat buttoned and zipped straight to the throat with the collar up so you won't catch cold...\\"<br />Buy this one!!! Enjoy!!! Tell your friends!! They will thank you... mine all did!!
0312305060|2.0|I got this book just for the hype. Remind me not to do that again.<br />What were these characters? You don't even feel them and the book ends. Wow!! You need to be a real genius to fit the lives (and supposedly sorrows) of three women in a mere 240 pages. Unfortunately Michael Cunningham is not that genius.<br />Very disappointing. I like to feel the characters in a book, this one failed in that completely.
B00008S2VG|4.0|This CD is very good. It starts with the thumpin' American Life. Great single. Madonna's rap is near the end of this song (very funny/entertaining). Hollywood follows. Probably one of the best songs on the CD. Guitar strumming and techno beats make this an excellent tracks. I'm So Stupid is OK. Something about it annoys me (maybe it's the annoying 10+ seconds of her holding the word 'I'). Love Profusion and Nobody Knows Me are the next two tracks. Good songs. Nothing really special. They are songs that will grow on you though. Nothing Fails is next. Pretty song. The 'I'm not religious but it makes me want to pray' is the main idea of this track. Very pretty nonetheless. Intervention is a beautiful song. X-Static Process is probably another one of the best songs. Very catchy and beautiful. She seems to make several religious references on this CD with this being one of the most religious songs with her talking about Jesus Christ in the chorus. Mother and Father is a good electronic track. Catchy. She raps (or attempts to) in this song which is pretty cool. She halfway succeeds. Very good though. Die Another Day follows. Nothing to say about it--everyone's heard this one. Very good. Easy Ride ends the track list. I really like this song. Another acoustic track. This CD has many acoustic tracks but each of them is its own gem. Overall, great CD (better than Music, in my opinion, which I liked a lot also) which is full of VERY CATCHY songs. Madonna, great return. :D
B000089A07|5.0|It was absolutely increadible. The storyline was fantastic, it had intelegence, infact, brilliance, as well as that it was so fantastically fast paced. The makeup was so realistic, the backdrop, and environments were so real. The crime scenes were very believable, and, oh! the flaming wheelchair scene was increadible. It was stomache twisting and yet done in the best of taste. Anthony Hopkins does it again!! Edward Norton is brilliant!! Directed fantastically. The camera angles are just right, the script is to the point. Adreline surges as you whatch each scene unfold into the utmost darkly seductive plot. The end leaves a deep smile on your face. Increadible!!! Thrilling!!! and darkly seductive!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|&quot;Fallen,&quot; the debut album of the band Evanescence, is a brilliant debut album.  Every song is worth a listen.  Amy Lee, lead vocalist, has a beautiful, at times even haunting voice.  Her performance in &quot;My Immortal&quot; is absolutely stunning.  A haunting, arresting song and performance.  It is one of two tracks on the &quot;DareDevil&quot; movie soundtrack.  The other being &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;, another five star song.  This CD is well worth your hard earned bucks.  A truly great debut album by this band. It will be interesting to see if they follow up with future top notch performances, or if this is a one hit phenomenon.  Either way this is one fine album!
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is one of Madonna's best!<br />She takes the finer points of Ray of Light and Music and blends them into a new and exciting sound.<br />The highlight of this CD is the amazing NOTHING FAILS! This song alone is worth the purchase price. Her voice has never sounded better and the mix of the guitars and the choir is marvelous.<br />Other great tracks included are Love Profusion, Hollywood (a surefire #1), X-static Process (a departure from traditional Madonna songs), and Intervention.<br />Also to note is MOTHER AND FATHER...a great mix of techno and electronica!<br />Run, do not walk, to get this CD.<br />You will not be disappointed.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Don't be scared off by the critics. This is Madonna's best album. Ever. Even better than &quot;Ray of Light.&quot; It's one of her most cohesive albums to date. Where &quot;Music&quot; was a hodge podge of musical styles (albeit highly entertaining) there is a deeply personal throughline here that reveals Madonna in a way that none of her other works have done. <br />From the opening title track &quot;American Life&quot; with its rap bash on the shallowness of American celebrity to the absolutely gorgeous and spiritual love song &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; to the pseudo 80s &quot;therapeutic&quot; dance track &quot;Mother and Father&quot; Madonna takes the listener on a sonic journey of bitterness to joy to a quiet kind of contentment. Each track serves a purpose and the album flows together beautifully.<br />Some tracks make take repeated listening but it's time well spent. <br />Madonna's still the most innovative pop music artist on the scene, twenty years strong.
B000088E6D|5.0|While channel surfing I stumbled on Buble on E.T. or some such show. His look got my immediate attention, but it was his sound that hooked me but good. Yes, really hooked. I don't think I've ever been so high on a new vocalist, but who can resist. I read his story on how he finally got his break and it is much deserved. You will feel the control and power he has on every track - which is a feat considering the songs covered. My hope is to see him at a live venue, and soon at that! He is a cutie too and that sure doesn't hurt.
B00008977N|5.0|I bought the original performance in laserdisc, so I've been spoiled up to this point.  However, I am mystified as to the complaints about the DVD.  It is as good, and better in several ways, than the laser, and is 10-fold better that the VHS.  The performance is, of course, spectacular, one of the best concert performances by any artist.  The DVD is clear on a good HDTV-capable set, and I recommend the bigger the screen the better.  Very few artifacts from the digital transfer.  Focus on listening to the DTS mix rather than the Dolby 5.1.  For some reason, it has more punch and sounds much cleaner, with better multichannel separation.  Even if you're not a Peter Gabriel fan but are wondering what all the fuss is about, you won't be disappointed with this DVD.
B000067CPX|5.0|This is music at its greatest.  Enough said.  A truly perfect creation.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Wow!  What a great, insightful album.  Not all the electronica that rumours would have you believe.  The album starts out with the great American life and goes right into a fun, poppy &quot;Hollywood&quot;  A great listen that would be hard to get bored with.  The lyrics and the message are inspirational to putting life in perspective and exploring all the facets of life and what is important.  I don't mean to say this is some grand statement on life, but it is certainly interesting as well as entertaining.  Looking forward to spinning to it!
0316666343|3.0|I read this book in a couple of days.  I found it hard to put it down, however, having just finished it, I still can't decide if I like it!  It was very interesting.  It had so many underlying stories/themes going on-which were fascinating.  I'm not sure how much I like the story line.   I would probably recommend it to others because it was quite thought-provoking.
B00008J4P5|4.0|This album is a pretty good listen, nothing new, but still definatly worth listening too. If you like the bluesy/rock/alt stuff, check out the black keys new album, I like it a little better than this. To get 5 stars, it needs to be an old stones record.
B00008OLYN|4.0|Ever since their debut album came out in 1994, the Swedish death-metal band Opeth have always written acoustic passages to create a more dynamic mood in their songs, and usually to a great effect. Six albums and almost ten years later, they've finally released a softer album that even non-metalheads can crank up the headphones to. And when I mean softer, I mean no lightning-fast solos, no guttural screaming vocals, and no pounding double-bass drums. This is a heavy metal band, but this is far from a heavy metal album.<br />Unlike their previous six albums, the majority of the eight tracks are actually songs written with accessability in mind.  No twelve minute suites are found here, but the opening track \\"Windowpane\\" certainly leans in that direction.  Most songs are written in the standard verse-chorus-solo formula, and Opeth have proven they can do that as well with high marks all around. The themes discussed in lyrics are similar to previous albums: lament, regret, melancholy. There are only two reasons I don't give this album the fifth star. Although the songs are solidly written, most of them are a bit too similar for my tastes. Also, 45 minutes is not quite long enough to qualify as album length these days.<br />I got this album because I am a diehard fan of whatever the four members put out. However, I really think that this CD has the crossover potential to break into the popular American market.  I personally suggest checking out \\"To Rid The Disease\\" and \\"Closure\\" to find out if this album is for you.
B00008S2VG|3.0|Gone is the majestic production of previous Madonna albums replaced by the predictable production style of Mirwais.  What was an interesting change of pace on Music has now become somewhat boring and stale.  The disastrous Die Another Day single is included which is unfortunate as it has nothing to do with the overall album.  Many of the tracks are quite listenable until Mirwais steps to the forefront and Madonna gets lost.  I miss the smooth William Orbit and Guy Sigsworth sound of prior albums.  Perhaps in time I will come around to this one but after several times of listening the start and stop nature of the album just makes it a chore to get through.
B00008J4P5|2.0|Well I was a big fan of the WS before but now the've tried to become retro-cool.In other words they mixed the oldies with a pinch of the shopping mall background music type. Wow, another tomato gone rotten. At least Cobain doesent have to see fantastic and talented people be chained to big companies backyards. The WS were really good at making really good music then adding really edgy lyrics which made a really awesome song. But now they've tried to catch up but only scratched the heel of todays music- which ... beyond all comprehension anyway.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I guess the best thing about Madonna is she gets better and better as I get older and older.<br />Starting with the \\"Shock and Awe\\" of American Life (track 1), she offers us a glimpse of what we all think is so wonderful about superficial american lives.  She follows it up with \\"Hollywood\\" and \\"I'm So Stupid\\", two more tracks that reflect her disillusion with pretty, rich lives.  <br />As rich and powerful as she is, I believe her.  Call me a fan, call me a sucker, but I think she trusts in her lyrics, which are as revealing as ever.  She has come full circle. <br />Then we get in to the groove.  I haven't wanted to dance so bad in my compact car after listening to \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" and \\"Love Profusion\\"....this is pure ecstasy folks.  <br />There are sparsely guitar laden ballads too, with heart:  \\"Nothing Fails\\", \\"X-Static Process\\" and \\"Easy Ride\\" prove Madonna a worthy musician.<br />But by far, by all means, the best song is \\"Intervention\\".  She has never conquered melody better than this.  If you ever wanted a Madonna song to give you chills, this is the one.  She speaks of the power of love setting you free, making everything all right....as she has before, but his time, the orchestration and the lyrics bring it straight to the heart.  Who is she talking about?  Rocco?  Guy?  Who cares...I'm crying!  <br />All in all...she succeeds...as she always does.  And now, for the first time, I admire her for her musical skills as much as her markering and publicity talent.  Can she do no wrong...!?
B00000720W|1.0|IF YOU LIKE THIS MUSIC YOU NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR.
B000088E6D|5.0|Sinatra's second coming! Fabulous album with a broad range of music. I recommend highly. Michael has an incredible voice.
0783204914|5.0|I put on the TV on a school night and saw this film. The result was I was sooo tired the next morning I fell asleep in history class. But it was worth it. This is honestly one of the best movies I've ever seen. AL Pacino is brilliant. By the way, this movie reminds me of the song 'Chelsea Hotel No.2' by Leonard Cohen. Don't know why, but anyway: GREAT FILM: buy it, rent it, steal it, whatever: but WATCH IT!
B00004W221|3.0|This is a classic movie of an underdog going against all odds and proving many people wrong; that dreams can come true and the impossible is possible. There simply was no quit in Rudy.<br />If there's a difference from the original DVD of &quot;Rudy&quot; and this one, I do not know. It's a great movie to buy or rent. Either way, you get to see a kid become a man with his heart, his brains, his determination, and his ability to take pain.
0385493622|5.0|Here is a nice simple book for those of you who like to explore things avoiding technicalities.<br />If you are not a math or science major, you would ask me: why should I read this book? I would answer: because math appeals to a large number of people, and, you got to admit it, in this period of time people must know something about it. This theorem, in addition, had puzzled great mathematicians (even geniuses) for more than three and a half century.<br />The book starts with some exploration of Greek mathematics, being the base of modern mathematics. Here we must see something about the Pythagorean Theorem, because it inspired the Fermat's Last theorem.<br />He moves then to speak about Fermat, the French mathematician. He mentions that Fermat did not in fact write a proof for his theorem due to the limitation of the margins of his copy of Diaphintine's &quot;Arithmetica,&quot; and this caused the whole mathematical community to suffer 385 years to construct a plausible proof.<br />After that, we see how Euler proved the case when n = 3. Then Sophie Germain prove it, inspired by Euler, for the Germain prime numbers. This eliminated most of the cases, yet there still infinitely many cases to check. The book does not go into technicalities, but you can enjoy reading about the backgrounds of some of brightest mathematicians of the 19th century.<br />Then comes some account on cryptography, as being the direct application to Number Theory, followed by the story of how Andrew Wiles, the most famous mathematician of our time, came to prove this theorem.<br />It proved to be even a harder task. It involved some modern up-to-date mathematics, some fields of Number Theory called: &quot;Elleptic Curves&quot; and &quot;Modular Forms.&quot;<br />And to conclude I would like to say that I think any person with some understanding of the notion of mathematics may be very able to enjoy it as much as I did. If you want an introduction to this &quot;mysterious&quot; discipline, this book would provide you the best read.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I purchased this CD today so excited about getting a Madonna CD the day of its release...just want to say...THIS CD ROCKS!!!...standout tracks are ..American Life..Mother And Father...Nothing Fails...Hollywood...I'm So Stupid...And Easy Ride....but i believe all the songs represent a straight window showing exactly where Madonna is in her life...how she feels...and what she thinks...if this album is a product of Madonna getting older i can't wait to hear what she has to say when shes 80!!!...Love Maddy
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is by far my favorite Madonna album. <br />In 'American Life' you hear the story of a Superstar who has finally come to terms with her surroundings, but most importantly herself. Madonna takes you on a journey in which she admits her shortcomings and reveals her humanity; something she has tried to do in the past but never achieved until now.<br />If you are looking for a dance record 'American Life' is not for you. It contains some great dance tracks (Hollywood, Nobody Knows Me) but thrives with it's melancholy revelations (Nothing Fails, X-static Process, Easy Ride). <br />I am not a huge Madonna fan but have to admit... 'American Life', so far, is my favorite album of the year!
B000089RVX|5.0|if the powers of good and evil combined their musical talents and put them on a CD...they would be called Evanescence. There is something eerily creepy about the music and the ghost like vocals providing the base for each song and yet something beautiful and angelic about Amy Lee's lead vocals. Guitar riffs from hell and violins from heaven...whatever it is it's great. <br />I fell in love with \\"Bring Me To Life\\", not because of the artist cameo but because of the vocals and the lyrics. Lee's voice is one to be envious of. Her voice is gentle and very powerful and is what makes this band stand out. Their lyrics are good enough to read. Lately I've noticed that alot of musicians are writing songs that don't work when they're not sung basically because they're not good songs. Their cd insert reads like a book of poetry. I actually read some of their lyrics before I got the cd and it influenced me to buy it. <br />This is a debut album from an amazing band. You don't have to be a fan of rock to love this album, just a fan of music. So to music fans everywhere invest in Evanescence...it's a worthy buy.
6305878323|5.0|The movie is great, but not the DVD.<BR>Some times DVDs have this annoying &quot;Coming soon&quot; thing where you have to press the &quot;menu&quot; button to get to what you've paid for. Guess what, on this DVD... menu button is disabled, forcing you to &gt;&gt;  to the part that you care about.
B00008S2VG|3.0|First of all, I applaud Madonna on doing her thing, her way.  That said, this CD wasn't anything all that special to me.  I can only handle so many songs about self-introspection and the meaning of life today (or lack thereof).  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Not that some people don't need a little thought provoking, but I think to assume that the majority of us NEED to be provoked (which is the overall feeling I get with this) is sort of an insult and I don't need a battery of depressing music to make me &quot;think&quot;.  I do well enough on my own.  These songs are well written and full of meaning, but almost TOO full of meaning.  The 1st track is &quot;American Life&quot; which is a slower version with less of a beat than what I've been hearing on the radio.  That is irritating simply because it's not the version I've already grown to like.  The ENTIRE album is a mix of accoustic guitar and the trance-esque type sounds found on &quot;Music&quot;.  It's a little slower than I expected and left me slightly bored.  Can't knock the girl for her efforts or the content, but in these times I prefer an escape in my music, not an attempt at being taught a lesson.
B000002I6T|5.0|As said by many who know this work, listening to it is a natural-high in itself; no additives necessary. Not just a simple collaboration between David Crosby and a little help from his friends: Neil Young, Graham Nash, &amp; many of the late60s Haight-Asbury music explosion (Jerry Garcia &amp; Co, Joni Mitchell, Paul Kantner, Grace Slick, etc, etc, etc...), but an album very well done and put together. A masterpiece! A better album than any CSN or even CSNY album (yes, better than Deja Vu)! An album that captures the true spirit - still very alive &amp; fresh at the time - of a decade that just came to an end when it was recorded in late-1970/early-1971. A MUST-GET no matter what genre you are! Yes, and a road-trip across the United States of America cannot be complete without bringing this one along.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna has proven with her last two albums, 1998's \\"Ray of Light\\" and 2000's \\"Music\\" that she doesn't want to repeat herself. Everything is about forging ahead, exploring new sounds, writing challenging songs, and \\"American Life\\" continues in that vein. It is an exquisite piece of work, more consistant and better sequenced than \\"Music,\\" a brilliant album in its own right but \\"American Life\\" digs deeper, hits harder, and is generally a more rewarding album. From the electro-pop-rap of the title track to the haunting finale \\"Easy Ride,\\" Madonna's message is clear: she is taking a long, hard look at herself, flaws and all, and not about to give up. Aside from those two songs, other greats include \\"Nobody Knows Me,\\" a dance gem with some great hooks, \\"Nothing Fails,\\" a truly inspiring song and the James Bond theme \\"Die Another Day,\\" which works seamlessly into the album (it has a slightly better mix than what was released to radio). \\"Mother and Father\\" is intensely personal and musically challenging, as is \\"I'm So Stupid,\\" which has an exciting, devil-may-care psychadelic rock feel. Perhaps best of all is \\"Hollywood,\\" a smooth pop gem which is sure to be a smash. Madonna delivers a challenging piece of work at a time when many pop artists are just coasting, giving us more of the same. \\"American Life\\" is worthy of many listens, and has much to offer.
B000002J29|5.0|I agree with most reviewers here that Seconds Out is an amazing recording. I just wanted to clarify something that has always caused confusion. <BR>     The original LP states &quot;All Drums Chester except: Robbery, Assault and Battery - keyboard solo Phil, Firth of Fifth - Phil &amp; Chester, The Musical Box - Chester &amp; Phil, Supper's Ready - Apocalypse 9/8 Chester &amp; Phil, Cinema Show- Bill Bruford/Phil keyboard solo, Los Endos- Phil &amp; Chester&quot; <BR>    What that means is that Phil played drums DURING the keyboard solo in Robbery, Assault and Battery -- NOT that he played the actual keyboard solo. The same with Cinema Show.
B00005Y228|4.0|With as much MTV TRL disposable-hit backlash animosity that flies around these days, and as much smarmy pop-explosion forecasting muttered about, it'd seem neigh-impossible to expect artists to sustain a career from top-40 processed and packaged hits. <br />Then there's Kylie Minogue, world pop star and multi-million album mover for over a decade, cheerily delivering shiny disco fun mixed with video savvy. Fever, her breakout record for the States, features a dozen cuts of high polish glam dance, from hit single \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" (as infectious a hook and La La La chorus as you'll find) to dizzyingly delightful \\"Love at First Sight,\\" tweaking filtered strings and light guitar with - wait for it - an infectious hook sighing \\"everything went from wrong to right, the music you were playing really blew my mind.\\" <br />And so on. Two more notable cuts, breezy opener \\"More More More,\\" and the album's best trick \\"Come In To My World\\" stripped down to a minimal techno beat and layers of Kylie cooing on the romantic title line. It's a credit to her production team that they're mostly able to sustain four minute onslaughts of glittery beats, bleeps and catchy choruses over twelve tracks - that's a lot of candy in 45 minutes. If she errs, it's when \\"Give It To Me\\" goes for edgier lyrics that doesn't mesh with her sugary voice, and a helium-high pitched \\"Burning Up\\" pushes into a simple Kylie acoustical closing ballad.<br />Minor quibbles; Fever freely offers unapologetic simple charm for those that want it.
B00008S2VH|5.0|\\"American Life\\" is an interesting mix of electronica & folk.  It's very stripped down and simplistic, yet it's also layered and complex.  I would have to say the title song is probably the least likable track on the record.  Everyone seems to be panning this album at the moment but I think that's because the critics either hate Madonna or expect too much from her.  This is a different 'sound' we're used to hearing from her and critics (and some fans) just want the same old thing.  I think people are just too concerned with any messages Madonna is trying to convey. If you care about messages then, to me, this record pretty much points out our obsessions with celebrity, commercialism, and ourselves.  It's also pretty spiritual: material things don't matter--love does. I think the better songs on the album are \\"Love Profusion\\", \\"Nothing Fails\\", \\"X-Static Process\\", and \\"Easy Ride\\".  This album may suffer the same fate as her 1992 album Erotica, critically shunned and later held up and embraced as one of her 'better' albums.  Listen to it a few times and let it grow on you, you'll see it's hidden boldness, imaginative curves, and bitter honesty.  I think this is one of her best albums.  Refreshing after so many manufactured bands/acts, and teens who think they know all about life.  The Limited Edition is identical to the 'explicit' version with the exception of the packaging: a nice black, white, and red cardboard-like picture box, a different picture on the disc, a foldout poster, and a sheet of Madonna 'stamps' which are just stickers with the album cover on them.    UPDATE:  As 2006 approaches and after the recent release of \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\", I decide to revisit \\"American Life\\" 2 1/2 years later.  With all the reviews concerning \\"Confessions...\\" bashing this album, often referring to it as \\"much-maligned\\" and \\"overly-political\\", I thought I should call the reviewers out on their mistakes.  THERE IS NOT ONE POLITICAL MESSAGE ON THIS ALBUM, PERIOD.  Listenand see.  WHY IT FAILED: This album failed because of marketing, timing, a weak lead-single, Madonna's personal opinions, and critics who outright lied in their reviews.  Strike one: the US was about to go into Iraq when this album came out and Madonna was against the war (and vocal about it).  Strike two: the \\"American Life\\" video, NOT THE SONG, was the only political statement connected to this album (and the video was pulled before release, and later leaked).  Strike three: the song \\"American Life\\" is the weakest song on the album and it's release as the first single pretty-much sealed the fate of the album as a whole.  Other factors: the title of the album, I believe, was a bad move.  Since 9/11, anything with the word \\"American\\" on it was/is subjected to extreme criticism and scrutiny.  It's a no-no to use the A-word in your work unless you're a country-singer, a religious-singer, or both.  Another bad move was the Patty Hearst/Che Guevara album cover and artwork.  People see that cover and think it's aggressive and combative.  The critics claimed the album was rife with political messages, Kabbalistic preachings, and over-use of the vocoder.  Well, if they had actually heard the album, they would know that there's no political messages at all.  There may be some Kabbalah messages in it, but they sound so common-sense and Christian/Catholic/Buddhist--everything!, that it's not so clear.  It's really generically spiritual, not explicitly Kabbalah or any other religion.  As for the vocoder (sound a little robot-like) was only used on 2 or three songs.  What's funny is that Madonna uses it more often on \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" and the critics love it!  This is a fantastic Madonna album that will be appreciated over time.  It's also the closest thing to acoustic-Madonna we've ever seen.  It's great to hear some more guitars in her music and less synthesizers.  \\"American Life\\" is an album that should not be overlooked because of a bad cover and silly misconceptions.
B00008S2VH|5.0|This album is one of Madonna's most creative. It is very good.<br />What I want to focus on in this review is the Limited Edition itself, and not the music. <br />The American Life Limited Edition is presented in a 2-piece telescoping box that is covered in White &quot;leatherette&quot; fabric and silk-screened in Black and Red ink. The inside of the box top is lined in red paper and the bottom is covered in Black &quot;linen&quot; fabric.<br />Inside, you will find the Enhanced CD (which I am almost sure is identical to the standard explicit version), you will also find a 2-sided 23&quot;x35&quot; poster, as well as a postage-sized Madonna stap sheet.<br />This item is definately for collectors! One day it will become very rare! <br />On the other hand, if you are not a huge Madonna fan, then the extras are not worth it for your money. But be sure to buy the standard version. If not, you are missing out on a great album!
B00008S2VG|3.0|Madonna used to brilliant and I don't mean back in the 80's I mean up until her last album. While she has blasted into the techno-pop phase of her career. Songs of previous works such as &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; still gave you access to grooves and a sense of relation. We all want to find a voice and be able to groove in the key of love. But on American Life Madonna refuses to let us party. She turns this album into about her and that's it she raps about her materlism is utter sardonic bitterness and it comes off as cold and lifeless. Just as Michael Jackson forgot how to groove and let us party Madonna is forgetting her roots are in the dance and turning her career and albums into self loathing works of tripe. She redeems herself with the balzing song &quot;Hollywood&quot;, Mirwais bleeps and guitar are set on top of a thumping bass that boosts the listener up to dancefloor highlights as &quot;Express Yourself&quot; and &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;. The album misses that dance floor groove, I am all for music as a form of self exploration but where is the music? She managed it all so well on her last two techno driven discs. Only a few songs salvage this cd from average, but when the songs are there that grab you, you notice the Madonna of old. The one who wanted to see ya dance and get into the groove!
B00008A7HZ|5.0|This album is a must have! This album is not out in England until the 5th June but I've got it on import over one month earlier.<BR>As Delta Goodrem is new to England, she has only released one song, Born to Try, which did well in England; Number 3. <BR>So when I got this album, I wasn't sure what to expect.  But after listening to it, I loved it. My favourite song is the title track from th album, track 2 Innocent Eyes. It's the best song i've heard in ages. All the other songs are great as well. All the tracks sound different from one another but they all mainly include the piano. And there are a couple of more faster songs but a mainly slower ballads but not like really 'cheesy' pop ballads. <BR>I may be a bit biased however because I too play the piano so I like this type of music. But i would definately recommend this album to anyone; i'm going to get the music score for the piano too! A great album - about 12 out of 14 tracks are great. Definately worth being bought! I just hope she releases innoncent eyes as the next single - then everyone will definately buy the album! <BR>So go buy it!
B000089RVX|5.0|I personally never have really realated to any music before but since i have gotten fallen(evanescence) thats all i can listen too! amy lee has such a great voice and her voice with the metal music just makes it the best ever! i give this 10 stars!
B00008OSD3|3.0|The Star Trek franchise (at around 10 movies and 5 series) is like farmland. It once produced bountiful and rich scripts, but has been so over harvested that story lines are increasingly stunted. Indeed, Star Trek Nemesis seems more like a rehash of the Wrath of Khan film, with additional plot elements from the TV series mixed in.<br />Without revealing too much of the movie, this film has a Federation's archrival suffering a crisis stemming from a mining planet (sound familiar?). A duplicate of Data comes into being and is subsequently used against the crew. From that point on, there are secret crew clones, mind melds, ship versus ship battles, the clumsily staged \\"death\\" of a major character who sacrifices their life to save the Enterprise, and so forth. All of these plot elements have been taken from earlier films or TV shows, reworked and repackaged.<br />Nemesis is clearly an attempt to replicate the successful Wrath of Khan movie. Unfortunately, the franchise has so focused on science fiction rather than traditional story elements, that the character identification and sentimentality that made up the original series, is absent for casual viewers. When the original Enterprise was blow-up in an earlier film or Spock died, the sense of loss that the director was trying to project, seemed tangible. Now, with a shiny new ship for each film or a multitude of duplicate crewmembers, it all seems contrived. <br />From an action standpoint, Nemesis is better than previous two or three films and is entertaining to watch. Nevertheless, this movie is a shadow of what the franchise once was. Perhaps if the producers let this series lay fallow for several years, it may bear fruit again.
B00008S2VH|5.0|Madonna?s newest album, American Life, explores a great deal of emotional depth and is significant for her message, rather than just her music, this time around.  The title track throbs and bumps with a new-world sensibility crashing into the techno-pop of old (read: just about 5 years ago!) that produces a jarring, but interesting effect.  While some have complained that the song seems disjointed, the point here seems to have been lost on some:  the song is about being disjointed from one?s life.  What happens when you finally have what you thought you wanted?  Where do you go from here?  What new horizons are left?  Many have skewered Madonna on this song because she is wealthy and therefore is asking Argentina to indeed cry for her.  But, Madonna?s message seems more complex: how can one truly know about the dangers and pitfalls of materialism and beauty unless you have achieved those goals?  It isn?t surprising in this context that people would have trouble with the message, after all ? if they didn?t, there would be no point for the song or the aptly titled album.<br /> Hollywood, the next track, is the catchiest on the record.  This guaranteed radio-hit is sure to become a top 40 single.  The hook and melody suggest that one is actually driving in the famed city, counterpointing lyrics that belie the happiness that fame and excess bring.  It?s reminiscent of an earlier Madonna, an almost 80?s-like song brought into the new millennium.  Fans who desponded during her Drowned World tour for the lack of ?early? material from her career should be happy here.  This is what Madonna does best: a sugary-sweet pop hit that just begs to be remixed onto the dance floor for us to grind to.<br /> I?m So Stupid, is another crashing and grinding anthem against materialism.  Mirwais is in his element here, creating a sonic piledriver that rages to be set free against the restraints you can almost feel he has put on it.  It?s melancholy-yet-angry-and-defiant chorus leaves you with little doubt that Madonna can still create good pop art.<br /> The next song, Love Profusion, is where this new ?unmaterial? girl sounds very 60?s ? and almost as some have claimed ? like Joni Mitchell.  It?s a fascinating sound, and not one you would think Madonna would head into despite the folky music she demonstrated on Music.  The combination of guitar and new-age funk really do seem to go together.  And it?s suprisingly good.  It makes you wonder why no one has tried this sound before.  It?s works so well, that Madonna tries two more combinations in Intervention (dedicated to her son) and X-Static Process.  <br /> Nobody Knows Me is another solid pop effort that has another effective hook into the song.  Catchy but with attitude, one can almost picture Madonna flipping her finger at the critics and the paparazzi.  It?s simultaneously trendy yet classic ? again, pure Madonna.<br /> The gorgeous Nothing Fails is really the centerpiece of the album.  A lush ballad that begins almost shy and playful moves into surprisingly deep and revealing territory.  It is a testiment to love ? pure, unconditional, and beautiful.  It is the peak that Madonna seems to now be striving for.  Much has been made of the surprise gospel choir at the end of the song, and with good reason.  The parallels to Like a Prayer are inevitable, but really are incongruent here.  The choir is here for a deeper emotional effect, rather than one that panders to simple gospel-loving, hand-clapping faux-religion.  It leaves one breathless, and inspired.<br /> Mother and Father is perhaps the scene-stealer and show-stopper on the album.  Tooting wistfully in a little girl?s voice, Madonna releases her inner child for all to see.  (Ironically, the child must like techno?)  Contrasting an almost before-and-after picture of life the time her mother died, you would think the song would be dark and brooding.  An ?Oh, Father? of the new millennium, as it were.  But you almost get the sense that there iscatharsis here: a solitary last glance back at the pain and confusion that literally made Madonna, well?Madonna.  The song points fingers, but doesn?t in a mean way.  You can see the forgiveness coming out of the hurt ? perhaps time has finally began to heal this wound. <br /> <BR>     Die Another Day, the soundtrack song from the James Bond film of the same name, actually fits in here.  Rather than just an abrupt, rambling piece about defiance, the transition here actually makes sense.  It?s the grown up Madonna finding out there is more to life.  By the time the final track, Easy Ride comes along, the album appears to almost come seamlessly together.<br />     That?s what makes this one of the more fascinating albums of Madonna?s career ? this is the first album she has produced in years that seems to have a continuous theme to it that doesn?t seem forced or made for promotions? sake since Like A Prayer.  The maturity in her voice, along with the genuine risks she seems to be taking on the album, make this arguably one of the finest of her career.  Critics and naysayers may cringe that there are no Express Yourself-like smashes on the album to blow away the Aguileras and the Spears waiting to take over her throne.  However, the beauty here is that she does do exactly that ? and with subtlety and finesse, among lush guitars and smattering acoustics that seem timeless.  This ?kinder, gentler? Madonna may be more subtle, but it?s a transformation that is both welcome and endearing.  You can?t help but wonder what will come next.

B00008S2VH|5.0|Marketing guys at Madonna's team must be working very good in trying to sintonize the wonderful mature girl between the actual trends of electronic dance music and the top ten club hits such as Cher's. Anyway this is a great great album. A lot of rythmn and madonna taste. Just a little less Vocoder would have been better, but you know, time is an issue for everyone and technology can do miracles, sometimes. Wonderful record! DJ CATTANEO.

I really love this one, I cant think of any similar band. Children Of Bodom is one of a kind. This Cd is their best even if all the other are perfect to. Blackmetalfans... Enjoy.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I read all the negative reviews directed towards Room for Squares and thought to myself, &quot;these folks must be missing something!&quot;  John's writing and musical styles are not tailored for the 21st century norm of loud, complicated, and tacky songs overcrowded with attempts to sell sell sell.  What his music does provide is a step away from the noisy rush of our society to explore the winding emotional rollercoaster that engulfs our mid-20's.  Each song specifically targets a time in life where one steps back and evaluates &quot;where am i going?&quot;  If you are looking for the answer, then you will be disappointed.  But if you can appreciate the question, then you will love this album.
0679735909|1.0|*Possession* is a renowned work, earning awards and critical praise. However, as a graduate student in literature increasingly disinterested in academia, I found Byatt's work to be problematic. The book is clearly an exhibition--it features so many literary forms, that it almost becomes bothersome--but where it falls short is in its characterizations. The primary cast is upper-middle to upper-class scholars, academics, all white, and all &quot;possessed&quot; (or &quot;obsessed&quot;) in some way exclusively with a literary figure of the past. To cite Forster, I contend then that Byatt's characters are flatter than round, more aloof than accessible. That is, even as a graduate student, I had difficulty identifying with any of them. Their drives and motivations are also difficult to relate to, further distancing the characters from the reader. It is a complete love story, but I should imagine that the reader seeking romance could easily find a more accessible and enjoyable read elsewhere. Moreover, as anyone who has read novels and watched their movie adaptations will attest, the movies rarely live up to the expectations created through reading a novel. With that, I caution also those who see the movie and expect the book to be similar to rest in their casual enjoyment with a 2-hour sit in front of their TVs.

B00008DDXC|2.0|In a nutshell: Chris Colombus can't direct for toffee. This is a dreadful rendering of a damn good read.<br />Acting: By and large, dreadful - as you would expect from twelve year olds, but very disappointing from the support cast of adult, eminence grises of the British acting establishment.<br />Coherence: poor - no one can blame Colombus for being unimaginative in his transfer of the book to the screen (to do otherwise would be to be crucified by a lynch mob of 9 year olds), but the transfer at least needs to make sense. This does not. Much of the plot was explained retrospectively by helpful, heavy-handed soliloquy, and even then wasn't awfully clear. And that's to someone who's read the book.<br />Dramatic tension: non-existent - The final showdown, which should have been edge of seat-gripping stuff, was simply dull: We have no empathy for Harry, no sense of who the villain really is (can't Voldemort do better than manifest himself in a hologram of an effete 16 year old?), what is at stake, why Ron Weasly's sister is there, and what the point of the Phoenix is (other than as a pretty ... plot device to dig Harry out of a sticky situation. Rowling's books are real page-turning Ripping Yarns, which are why they've sold so well. Colombus failed totally to import this onto this second film (the first was much better).<br />Finally - and this is partly Rowling's fault, as she wrote the books this way - it's terribly formulaic, and in execution is derivative of a number of other classic B-grade movies (ET, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars amongst them).<br />Not destined for great things come Oscar time, methinks.

B00008OLYN|5.0|This isn't your typical Opeth. Instead of mixing death metal with acoustic guitars and clean vocals, this is all clean vocals and guitars. It works well considering how their last album Deliverance was probably their heaviest album to date. Originally the singer wanted to release both albums at once but the record company said no I guess. Anyways, this album is really a masterpiece. Any Opeth fan will appreciate this album, although I wouldn't use it to introduce a new comer. The lyrics on this album are very poetic, and work well with the music. The only complaint I really have with this album is that it is pretty short for an Opeth album. It is under 50 minutes I think, and for anyone who knows Opeth they know how long Opeth can get. But that one complaint isn't even close to enought to make this album any less than 5 stars.<BR>\\" Sleep my child...\\"
0064407667|5.0|I just finished this fun and fast moving book by Lemony. Very entertaining and educational! Great reading for children who have learned to read on their own. Readers will enjoy parts like pg.94 where Klaus \\"found himself reading the same sentenece over and over\\", as well as the explaintory phrases for introducing words like rickety (pg. 2) (Of course, be sure to look up nefarious and fiendish, since the author does not supply this with definitions. It would be fun to use it as a class activity though.) Although the author does delivery on his promise that this book has also a \\"unhappy ending\\", the readers are left with hope that the Baudelaire children will triumph in any bad circumstance, even if its only for a little while.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I first head their music during the summer of 2001, my friends from Moscow brought me a copy of their debut CD. The lyrics were offcourse Russian, their voices do not distinguish them from other Russian pop singers, or pop singers in general, although the duo nature does provide a benevolent effect.<br />As I was listening to the music in the car, I began to notice things...Not the feeble, sometimes randomized and primitively taylored lyrics, but interesting elements in the production. Their producer Ivan Something [the guy who writes/produces the music, the guy behind the drum machine and Roland] practically carries the group on his music.<br />The melodies are surprisingly enjoyable, at times more trancy than dancy and it seems as if the produced is just restrained by the pop nature of the group...Another aspect of the music I despise are the samples chosen. They are a breed of the archaic dance formula, bright synths, ambient strings, heavy kicks and 4x4 hats. Listen to mixes by Oakenfold and Max Graham to see the more professional side of dance/trance electronica.<br />In conclusion, there are about 4 or 5 good songs, but I admit that I cannot stand to listen to them anymore, beacause I've had too much. The formula works, every teenage Russian girl I know is crazy about them [here in the US atleast] and all teenage girls are pretty much the same so...

B000002LPH|5.0|I am very picky in my musical taste! Why is this CD out of print? I have listened to this recording, literaly near a thousand times. Mr Harrison's eclectic, spiritual sound that is prevelant on all his recordings (Including his last \\"Brainwashed\\") never sounded better than it does here. \\"Soft Hearted Hana\\" is amazing. \\"Not Guilty\\" which was originaly recorded for the \\"Let it be\\" sessions, finally finds it way to album form. How could the beatles not have used this? \\"Blow away\\" is george having fun, I wish he made more music like this. \\"Here comes the moon\\" his answer to the beatles \\"Here comes the sun\\" is a more than adequate follow up. \\"Your love is forever\\" is my personal favorite. This CD has it all! From start to finish! If you cant find the CD. Hunt it down in LP form. You will wonder what all the fuss with \\"All things must pass\\" was. This is his finest work. The only album that has the same \\"feel\\" is the afor mentioned \\"Brainwashed\\" which I find interesting, considering the more than twenty years span between. Maybe Mr Harrison in the waining years of his life also realized some of his finest work!

B000008J3I|3.0|Mike is not only famous for his long epic Tunes (\\"Tubular bells\\",\\"Incantations\\").In eighties he rebuilt his career by playing Short pop songs and from time to time more long tracks(\\"Taurus I\\" from \\"qe2\\" or \\"The wind chimes\\").this album mostly Spots MIke's LAter Career.<BR>There are all of his famous radio-friendly songs - \\"MOONLIGHT SHADOW\\"(absolute classic),\\"HEAVENS OPEN\\",\\"FOREIGN AFFAIR\\",\\"ISLANDS\\",\\"TO FRANCE\\",\\"FAMILY MAN\\",some non-album traditional irish melodies (Charming \\"PORTSMOUTH\\" and \\"IN DULCI JUBILO\\".Both appeared on \\"The complete\\" and his other compilations) and my two al time favourites : Genious \\"FIVE MILES OUT\\" and a 5 minutes long version of a powerfull rock \\"SHADOW ON THE WALL\\". Well, i prefer Oldfield's both faces - the pop composer and great instrumetal aranger, so i enjoy it all.But here is why i gave it 3 stars.<BR>His long instrumental pieces can be only listened as they are.:TUBULAR BELLS OPENING TUNE\\" is very poor - 4 minutes out of 25 of part one can not represent this album, such rich and wonderfull.The same with \\"OMMADAWN\\" and \\"AMAROK\\".If somebody in virgin records would be much wiser he could create a double album.One cd with pop and other with his instrumentals.It happened in 2002 (\\"collection\\").<BR>It was my first Mike Oldfield record i bought.Now i am his big fan, and i must say many of his great songs vanished from here (Where is his famous \\"SHEBA\\" or \\"IN HIGH PLACES\\"???) but i can recomend this to you...maybe you will be as amazed as i was when i first heard the hard tribal drums of \\"AMAROK excerpt\\"....
B000084T18|5.0|This is quite possibly best cd i have ever copped, 50's lyrics punch out the truth about the streets and the beats just keep poppin'.  Big up's to 50 and G-unit.  You did your thing. If anyone dislikes this cd, there something wrong wit 'em. 50's here and he's for real.
1577311523|3.0|I was not excited by this book because I learned about witnessing emotions and thoughts (instead of letting them controlled me)30 years ago.  Tolle recommends being present which is also nothing new.  If you are really interested in experiencing your best self and making the most of your life, read Optimal Thinking, and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. They give you down-to-earth tools and take you above touchy feeling mumbo jumbo.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I love t.A.T.u. I'm a lesbian myself and to hear about two girls that are in love singing I hoped it would be good and it was. I give this album five stars because it has great music and the lyrics are awesome.
0893860220|5.0|I am That and for that matter anything that is a work of Nisargadatta Maharaj is always a work of true spiritual realization in action. I am That is one of the most profound books of its kind. I Am That is a crown jewel among books and Nisargadatta Maharaj has proven to be one of the most humble, caring and devoted sages ever known.  What makes this book oustanding is that it keeps bringing you back to the same core teaching...your true nature is beyond mind and body--explore that!   I must admit that it could be a bit confusing at first and sound like someone talking in riddles, however once the message begins to dawn on you, it it's message is ever so profound.  What's that? What your true nature is and how to find lasting peace.   On one hand it might be a bit confusing at first but at the same time, it is because what he says is so ridiculously simple it goes over your head. The basic premise is concept-free spirituality based on seeking your true nature in deep awareness. I consider this a must for a seeker, especially one that prefers very direct type teachings about realizing the Self without alot of extra innesentials.
B000002NJS|4.0|Let's make this 4.32 stars...to be as fair and accurate as possible;)<BR>This was actually the first Madonna album i bought, and though i was expecting it to be interesting, i was very surprised by the emotional depth and musical exploration it showcased for the masses. First off, i think that many people should be grateful to Madonna for showing this more esoteric music for the commerical market, getting more people to be interested in \\"the underground\\". But let's get to the album itself, which i think is a great triumph for Madonna on many levels, as well as a musical treat.<BR>1/ Drowned World/Substitute For Love: from the moment you hear this song, you know the album is going to carry some sort of heavy weight. Perhaps, like most of the album, there is something Slightly pretentious, let captivating. It's a good song and was a single with a frightening video.<BR>2/ Swim: perhaps one of the most cliche-sounding songs on the album, with slihgtly clunky yet sincere lyrics...and it spite of this, it isn't a bad song. it has William Orbit's trademark \\"wah-wah\\" drifting, guitar, which does very much evoke images of liquids.<BR>3/ Ray Of Light: undoubtedly the biggest hit from the album, with its frantic video to match its equally frantic beats. It is very listenable and well remixed.<BR>4/ Candy Perfume Girl: A cool and edgy song with bizarre lyrics and loud guitar, this song is one of the highlights of the album.<BR>5/ Skin: a fragmented, trippy, and engagingly disturbing Eastern-tinged techno song...its lyrics are desperate and dificult to ignore. the length of this song is part of its appeal to the listener.<BR>6/ Nothing Really Matters: One of the catchiest songs on the album; uptempo, yet relaxing. Melancholy, yet uplifting. And yes, there is something somewhat pretentious about these lyrics as well, but we can forgive her, cuz it's such a memorable song. The video for it is one of her best.<BR>7/ Sky Fits Heaven: A fragmented tale of her personal \\"revelation\\", the lyrics are once again questionable, but the production is sweeping and superb.<BR>8/ Shanti/Ashtangi: Arguabley pretentious, but it is my personal favourite on the album. It is an Indian-dance chillout song, sung entirely in Sanskrit from ancient texts, and set to music by none other than Madonna and William Orbit.<BR>9/ Frozen: This song and its striking video, were the first single off the album, and it's difficult to forget the longing lyrics seamlessly blended with the eastern and the techno, and the visuals, if you saw the video when it came out, as i did.<BR>10/ The Power Of Goodbye: Perhaps the most openly mournful song on the album, it's simple yet compelling and catchy. Also a single, with a lonely-looking video.<BR>11/ To Have and Not To Hold: This song is beautiful and heart-wrenching, with a drifty-sound.<BR>12/ Little Star: This is Madonna's sweet tribute to her then-recently-born daughter. It's a new side of Madonna, coupled with a gorgeous arrangement and tune. It's one of her most memorable songs.<BR>13/ Mer Girl: This song, which somehow manages to be frightening, pretentious, regretful, angry, contemplative, and yet sincere all at once, ends the album on a sobering, if not chilling note. It deals with her feelings of her mothers death at cryptically epic proportions.<br />Although we may miss the more rebelloious madona, it's nice that she's happy and willing to show us a side of her previously unrevealed. this album is refreshing and reccomended for every music lover's collection.
1577311523|5.0|I don't know where to begin with this book. I will start by saying that one of the many things that makes the Power of Now a gem of a book is how Tolle has taken the core of ancient wisdom and churned out a real masterpiece without very mystical or religious concepts.<BR>This is definately a book for someone who is into self realization..IT IS NOT A POP PSYCHOLOGY BOOK OR A NEW AGE BOOK as some in the negative reviews have claimed. That is the problem with being on a best seller list like Tolle now is, the book is being read by people who normally wouldn't read something like this and \\"give it a shot cause it's kind of popular now\\" and are faced with talk on \\"Ego, trancending mind chatter, enlightenment, how the past/future are only mental creations etc.\\" This is a book for people who are willing to take a moment to understand the premise...your true nature is beyond body, mind identification/constructs. Not in a very mystical way-in very natural way, one can even say a scientific way, the science of all religions before they became organized religions--the message of true self realization. <BR>Of course the book takes a certain EXPERIENTIAL KNOWLEDGE. We hear over and over that we are all ONE and that our true nature is beyond the body but how many of us truly get that in an experiental no nonsense way? Very few. The Power of Now's core teachings are a deep inner path not a quick-pop book.<BR>In conclusion, Tolle has a great ability to communicate with very deep perception and the book is nothing short of brilliant.<BR>The premise is--Suffering is due to the mind made self, the Present helps one transend the false self. Once transended...the discovery of Timeless NOW free of mental anguish...Sorry to sound weird. <BR>Please read this book with patience and keep a Zen like mindset to get into the tone.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is just a great, unique, soothing, beautiful CD to listen to.  I find it relaxing -- I can just feel my tensions melting away when I put it on.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I have been a casual fan of Beck since the Mellow Gold days, but I never actually bought one of his albums.  However after all of the praise for &quot;Sea Change&quot; I felt somehow compelled to pick it up.  Definately a good choice on my behalf.  Very mellow album with a very musical appeal.  Mr. Hanson's sense of harmony and intrinsically palatable melodies is commendable.  This is an album that will spark thoughts about topics largely unrelated to whatever topic the song is referencing.  Beck's lyrics are almost unneccessary...the music uses the vocals as fodder for a highly cultivated end product.<br />Additionally, the sonics on this album are absolutely fantasic.  Beck is an audiophile himself, and he shows it by offering this album in three distinct versions.  The standard CD also features the HDCD fomat, which is a slightly improved 20 bit (compared to 16) recording where the upper frequencies definately have more life to them.<br />The other CD features the third version, SACD (Super Audio CD), a very high resolution digital format invented by Sony and Phillips.  Unfortunately,  since I haven't bought my SACD player yet, I was unable to demo this option.  But I do have an HDCD Receiver, so I was able to hear that version.<br />The Bottom line is that Beck has once again managed to both evolve as a musician and entertain (albeit slowly and gently)us at the same time.  Highly Recomended (Go buy some nice speakers!)
B00008J4P5|1.0|Most overrated CD since Ryan Adam's &quot;Gold&quot;. Most if these songs sound like outtakes. &quot;I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself,&quot; looms over the entire collection and it's a cover. It shows that with good material the duo can be entertaining. But the bulk of these songs seem like fragments either musically, lyrically or both. &quot;The Hardest Button to Button&quot; and &quot;At least it's True We Love One Another&quot; are the most wayward of the collection. It seems two weeks (the time in which this CD was recorded) wasn't long enough for the gestation of this elephant. Jack and Meg rather have given us a mouse.
B00008S2VG|5.0|unbelieveable-<BR>not as startleingly freshly revived as ray of light,<BR>not as eclectic as Music and nothing like anything earlier...<BR>American Life is powerfull in its production, its simplicity and its honesty.<BR>American Life is brilliant in its past meets future quiality and in the poetry of Her lyrics; raw, bloody truth in her words; inspiring, Affirming, confirming, beautifull, provocative... the future.<BR>American Life has a seventies/eighties motion, yet very now, new, transendant. you can relax or you can dance, either way you feel the vibes fully!

B00008H2LB|4.0|although so many found hybrid theory to be the best cd that ever was recorded i thought, .... Yes, there were a few catchy songs such as crawling, and they did improve hybrid theory by making the remix cd. But up until Meteora i thought they were just another mainstream band that the previous ... had graduated to. Meteora is quite a step forward from Hybrid Theory. The beats are nasty and the lyrics no longer sound like that of a middle school talent show band. So, Linkin Park, you guys did a great job, seemingly going from a radio band to one that shows actual musical talent and uniqueness.
B000063DHK|5.0|After \\"Powerslave\\" (1984) was released, the band followed that up with a live show in Long Beach, California with the lineup (Dickinson/Harris/Murray/Smith/McBrain) that is now considered a classic one at that.  I actually bought \\"Rock in Rio\\" before this (seeing as how I got into Maiden somewhat recently), and after buying this, I now agree with many fans out there that THIS is the best live effort from this great metal band.<br />[While some might say that this is the best Maiden album to date, I might contest that; some of the studio ones are great and I also dislike comparing live and studio recordings.  With that said, this review continues.]<br />\\"Live After Death\\" starts off with Winston Churchill's famous speech, which kicks into \\"Aces High.\\"  I'm more fond of the studio one myself, but this is a great performance nonetheless.  \\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\" follows and is equally great.  \\"The Trooper\\" is where things start getting EXTREMELY good, as Bruce belts it out quite well.  \\"Revelations\\" is also good and Bruce does a hell of a job of singing this one.  I'm glad that it's here, because \\"Piece of Mind\\" is horribly overshadowed.  \\"Flight of Icarus\\" is marvelously performed and it even outstands the original studio recording.  The next song, however, would show Iron Maiden's dexterity... \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\\"  A 13-minute juggernaut that stays on par with the original (I'm saddened that it wasn't on Rock in Rio)!  \\"Powerslave,\\" \\"Number of the Beast,\\" \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name,\\" \\"Iron Maiden,\\" \\"Run to the Hills,\\" and \\"Running Free\\" all follow afterwards and are performed greatly as well.<br />On Disc 2, we get a handful of songs left.  \\"Wrathchild\\" comes next.  It's still a good performance, but I prefer the original studio recording.  \\"22 Acacia Avenue\\" follows and it is one of the best performances on the album, as its following song, \\"Children of the Damned.\\"  \\"Children...\\" is popular among fans, but I'm very glad to see \\"22 Acacia Avenue\\" because it's severly underrated.  \\"Die With Your Boots On\\" follows and is also a stellar performance and I'm also glad that this song is here because A LOT OF FANS TEND TO HATE THIS ONE.  The final track, \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" is quite possibly the best performance on the album.<br />If you're just starting to get into Maiden, I highly suggest buying this album.  You won't regret it; it's their best live effort to date.  The Paul Di'Anno-era songs are especially done well and I was very pleased that a handful of Piece of Mind songs actually made it.  This has a GREAT tracklist and while they had only a few albums before this one, every song choice is marvelous.  This milestone in rock history captures one of the greatest heavy metal bands in their prime... and therefore, a MUST HAVE for any metal collection.everly underrated.  \\"Die With Your Boots On\\" follows and is also a stellar performance and I'm also glad that this song is here because A LOT OF FANS TEND TO HATE THIS ONE.

0425105709|4.0|I had 2 read this book 4 a book report, and @ first i had no interest whatsoever in it at ALL! Once i started to get into it, I was automatically very confused! The plot was interesting, but the whole idea was just plain, well....confusing! I recommend this book to people who like somewhat twisted plots.
B00005YW4H|1.0|This is a very overrated cd.  All songs sound the same and it would make great elevator or dinner music where you just needed soft noise.  Great example of a record label and awards show working to promote one artist.  Maybe it was worthy of 2 grammy's but not 5 or 6.  Can't tell me there aren't other good artist's out there.

0140186409|5.0|A thousand years from now this book book will be in the Bible, like Job. ... If you're a high school student forced to read this for a class, forget it. It won't mean a thing to you. But if you have children and parents dependent on you, only a paycheck away from disaster month after month, this book will resonate with your rage.
B00005T33W|5.0|This movie is awesome! Thora Birch is great in it, her sarcasim and way of thinking in this movie is so great! She has her own opinions and lets people know them. I personally see myself in ENID and what she goes through after graduating high school. I love this movie and own it, I'd recomend it to anyone that can appreate a good laugh.
0553266306|4.0|There is little to be found wrong with this book. I mean, it sits towards the top of its genre so what can you really say bad about it?<br />The book doesn't get bogged down with extraneous detail like so many Clancy novels, yet it has enough to satisfy the type of reader who generally reads these novels (I'm not one of them). The characters were as real as characters in a fictional espionnage thriller can be, I suppose, and the plot was certainly interesting enough to capture anyone's attention.<br />My only qualm with this book is the ending. One, there is a final twist at the end that will leave you scratching your head and then saying, &quot;Well, wait a minute...&quot; It forces you to go back and reconsider almost everything the Jackal did.<br />My other problem with the ending, and this is nitpicking to be sure, is that the ending seemed too 'Hollywood', if you will. The main character working to solve the Jackal's case just happened to be in the right place at the right time. It seemed a little contrived.<br />All in all, a thrilling book and one with enough political relevancy to seem like you're learning something along the way, as well.
0198534469|5.0|I tried to learn complex analysis from Ahlfors, I wouldn't recommend you try it although it is a good book. The problem is there are certain subtleties in complex variables that are NOT obvious. There are few authors of math books that remember that we do not know these subtleties. I could go on a tirade about the general state of math literature for hours, but my only remark here is that in my view most authors seem to be trying to impress someone other than the students, maybe other professors ? Anyhow, this book is a definite departure from this nonsense. There are 12 chapters each with many exercises. The first couple of chapters have over forty and since I try to do them all, well ... If you read this book carefully and do the execises you WILL know this subject. You could teach it. You don't see Thm 1.2.3.5.8 followed by Proof. What you do see is a clear presentation of the ideas with PICTURES and EXPLANATIONS that you can understand, of course you really find out about that \\"understand\\" part when you get to the exercises. The biggest problem I had was getting out of the old way of thinking and into a more geometric way of thinking. Couldn't recommend it more highly. Another author who writes to teach is Victor Bryant. His book Yet Another Introduction to Analysis is great for a highschool senior or 1st year college. (He is with me on the state of math literature.) Also, Hans Schwerdtfeger's book Geometry of Complex Numbers goes well with Needham and is very cheap ! I'm surprised Needham didn't include it in the bibliography. It's a little gem and covers some of the same material.

B00006IUL7|4.0|Hollywood seems to have a love affair with remakes. A few years back it was hip to remake French films, then it was film versions of old TV shows, and every year there seems to be a \\"Sequelitis\\" epidemic in multiplexes worldwide. But INSOMNIA offers a Hollywood rarity: This is a remake of a NORWEGIAN movie.<BR>While my opening comments don't offer much hope for the film, INSOMNIA is actually a great movie once you get into it. Starring Oscar winners Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank, executive produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney and directed by Christopher Nolan director of the vastly overrated MEMENTO, INSOMNIA is a compelling mystery thriller.<BR>When cop Will Dormer (Pacino) witnesses the murder of his partner, the prime suspect is mystery writer Walter Finch (Williams). But while Finch appears accommodating to the police, chronic insomniac Dormer finds himself receiving taunting calls from Finch in the middle of the night. Dormer's investigation leads him to a remote Alaskan town which never sees nightfall during the spring/summer seasons where he is partnered with local cop Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank). But with the combination of the continued threats from his unseen nemesis and the stress of the investigation, Dormer's sleeping disorder is wearing him down and disorientating him, making him an easier target.<BR>Like MEMENTO, INSOMNIA is full of twists and is beautifully photographed. But thankfully unlike it, INSOMNIA has a plot that makes sense and keeps the viewer glued to the screen; but it is the strong characterisations by Pacino and Williams that make their cat-and-mouse game utterly compelling. I haven't seen the Norwegian version, but as far as remakes go its probably a pretty safe bet that INSOMNIA is in the upper ranks.
0393317552|4.0|I'm reading this book and while its not a &quot;can't put down and go to sleep,&quot; it is one of the most informative and interesting books I've read.  Diamond explores every aspect of human development.  He very clearly and patiently explains how we got to be &quot;the first world&quot; and others didn't and throws in a lot interesting facts and snippets of history.  How was the Cyrillic language created?  Where did SARS (others preceding it) come from?  Why does Europe eat so much bread and South America eat so much rice?<BR>Definitely a must read.

If your child likes \\"Goodnight Moon,\\" (s)he will probably get a kick out of this silly story.
B00005YXZH|4.0|It is by no means a bad album.  It is better than 90% of the dreck out there today. But the hype was huge.  All the publicity made it seem like a really daring trip in a dissonant direction.  But that trip ends promptly at the end of the first song.  The second track &quot;Kamera&quot; is completely radio-friendly.  Nothing wrong with being radio-friendly, but the album just can't seem to make up its mind whether to be Velvet Underground's &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; or to be Velvet Underground's &quot;Loaded.&quot;  Still amazing nonetheless.  &quot;Jesus, etc.&quot; is truly a gorgeous song worth the price of the whole album.  Enjoy thoroughly, but don't expect a consistently challenging album.
0385507755|2.0|That Gus Van Sant has already optioned the rights to James (Next time you get a tattoo be sure your mantra can fit on your arm) Frey  because I think it would be the perfect vehicle for the next Ed Burns movie.<br />By the way, what's the difference between mentioning that you read Foster Wallace when 1) it's as counterproductive as the person who did it in the first place [that's to the guy who thinks mentioning Infinite Jest is somehow snobby or elitist. If you think citing that book is indictative of someone's intelligence, may I suggest you put down your book before you hurt yourself] and b)in your mentioning that you've read A Million Little Pieces aren't you doing the exact same thing? Or is A Million Little Pieces somehow less 'smart' that IJ? I don't get it. You're trying to defend one book by pointing out its inferiorities to another book. Some fan you are. Or maybe you're in charge of Frey's Media Assualt on Those Who Think Being a Bouncer and Getting a Root Canal are Signs of Someone's Authenticity and Manhood. A P.O.W. ain't got nothing on F'in Jimmy Frey.<br />Anyway. I read the book and I have to say that Frey has as good a command of pacing as your average screenwriter, which, judging from his credits, he seems to have been in another life. I give him high marks for turning up the volume on the self-mythology, but that seems to be par for the course for an Autobiography, which is what this book is, not a Memoir. A memoir constitutes the recollections of a life lived. What Frey has written is a What I Did On My Summer Vacation with the boring [i.e., real] stuff left out and all the exciting [i.e., fiction] stuff left in. (Bonding w/ Gangsters? Prostitutes with Hearts of Gold? Frey's like a hypercaffeinated mix of a third-rate Scorcese [Rob Cohen, Sal Stabile] and Garry Marshall.) <br />What really gets me going is that people are still buying the whole Drug Addict/Countercultural Hero b-s. My mother is a drug addict. She lives an hour outside of Chicago in a town that doesn't have a shopping mall. Her hip has degenerated to the point that to get out of bed in the morning she has to take two types of painkiller, a steroid and a muscle relaxer to offset the steroid. She listens to Andrea Bottcelli and collects ceramic roosters. Take her drugs away and within two hours she'd be defecating on her lawn and threatening relatives with scalding cookware. Kicking drugs and then having the gall the write about your experience is like a carb addict going through bread withdrawl and then announcing to the world that they've been to hell and back. What I'd like to see Frey kick is his addiction to himself.<br />Drugs don't make you a jerk. You make yourself.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Had this album been released by anyone else, it would be praised as emotional, insightful, introspective and mature.  Being that is was released by Madonna, however, critics can't help but make jabs at their favorite pop punching-bag.<br />This album is quite strong, with trimmed-down arrangements and folk-driven sensibilities.  True, this album is not chalk-full of radio-friendly pop nuggets, but what it lacks in Top 40 appeal is balanced by interesting arrangements and, moreover, subtlety.  Madonna's vocals are the best I've heard in her career - smooth, mature, and utilized to the best of its abilities.  Her lyrics can strike one at first as naff (\\"Mother & Father\\") but, after a few lessons, one can begin to understand just how well thought-out they are (as she harkens back to her childhood confusion, she utilizes a more chidlike lyric).  <br />The songs complement each other well, and it's been quite some time since I've heard a Madonna album sound so cohesive.  Even \\"Die Another Day\\" is given depth and a new perspective by its addition to the album.<br />\\"American Life\\" is an achievement for Madonna, regardless of the critics' bashings.  It reflects the Madonna of today and doesn't try to opt for the path down which many other artists right now (white-washed R&B and same ol' same ol' producers) are treading.  It's a grower, mind you, but it sits in your skull and mulls about and that's exactly what I want from an album.  She's done it again, in my book.

B00004WGAI|5.0|There is no movie version of Jane Eyre comparable to this one. It is extremely close to the book which gives it an instant thumbs up. I don't think Dalton is to handsome to play Rochester. I sense in the book that Rochester's ugliness comes more from his unlovely temperament and past youth than from his actual looks. I think Dalton captures the broodiness and desperation of Rochester. Also, though everyone seems to think Zelah Clark(e?) is too subdued, I don't think so. I think Jane is more passionate under the surface, rather than in her normal speech and mannerism's, etc. Anyway, if you like the book and you like movies that follow the book, don't look any further than this version. It simply is the best.
B00008OLYN|4.0|This is not your typical opeth album.  Instead of the awesome black and prog mix we are used to we get treated to a very smooth and murose album.  All the songs on this album are soft and melodic but don't let that stop you from picking it up. I think it would have been interesting if they put one hard song in there (like they put one soft in deliverence) but still no complaints. 4.5 stars if you are an opeth fan it will not dissapoint.  favorite songs are track 1 and 2.
B00005JLK1|1.0|I just don't get it.  The production team behind DARK CASTLE films are reputable movie makers, however, so far all three of their flicks fail to do anything but produce lots of eye rolling.  As with HOUSE ON HAUNTD HILL and THIRTEEN GHOSTS, GHOST SHIP starts out great, then falters.  Great production values and decent premises are there, but all three films progress into either the absurd, or are just muttled by a confused plot or lack there of. Lowest common denominator movie watching especially for fans of the genere. Pretty much before GHOST SHIP left port, it sunk.
B0000584V3|5.0|What can i say that hasn't been said.  My favorite album of all time by far.  &quot;The leaper affinity&quot; and &quot;Drapery falls&quot; are absoulouty incredible.  I have got my 42 year old stepdad who listens to nothing but jazz raving about this album.  If you like metal at all or want something different than what you are used to or if you are breathing get this album.  10 stars
B00005JLRT|4.0|This is a much different kind of Trek movie than what we're all used to, everyone would agree.  I wouldn't say it was a particularly bad movie.<br />The shame here is that no one thought to make a DS9 movie, or one centered around another Trek race as the primary plot, perhap a good Ferengi adventure story?
B00005B36H|5.0|There are already alot of reviews for this so i would just like to applaud a band for giving some inspirational food for thought.  If you have seen the video for parabola and understand what it means then it can be motivating for a person to better themselves.  A great cd.
0553583182|5.0|For anyone who was raised to think that you have to work hard for everything and the only way to succeed is to work harder, get this book. Dr. Murphy presents ways to use the power of your mind that help you succeed in any endeavor. He writes clearly and meaningfully. Whatever you want or need in life--whether it is financial success, better health, or noble pursuits that have a lasting impact on others--this book helps you harness the power within you to achieve it. This book is about more than thinking positively. It is about how to become great ... as great as you can imagine. I was raised to believe that I could only expect to get something if I had labored for it at great pains; but, in fact, this is not true. Thinking is the key to achievement. Have you ever tackled a problem that you thought through until you came up with a great solution? This is like that, only much, much more. I happened to get the revised copy, which has an interruptive style imposed on the author's style, so I'd recommend getting the original if you can. Just get it, read it, and start applying its principals. Pay especial attention to the scriptural references as you may suddenly find in them wisdom you never noticed before.
B000050IE6|5.0|Opeth are my favorite band and i have all their cd's.  The general consensus seems to be that most people like this one best.  I love this cd but there are certain things that strike me funny.  For me the vocals in some of the songs are way to proggy for my taste (some of the chorasus like on \\"the moor\\" and \\"godhead's lament\\").  Still an awesome album my favorite song are \\"face of melinda\\" and Serenity painted death.
B0000028RR|5.0|...the best.<br />Don't get me wrong,  Rage's evolved sound in the next few albums was really good and the tracks equally listenable. <br />However, this s/t release is a full length good album.  You can listen to this whole album and enjoy each and every song.  The band in these years put together an amazing album that I thoroughly enjoy.<br />I'd recommend it to anyone with a harder side in their musical taste.  It's a must own for any rock fan.
B00006G8HX|5.0|After being mildly disapointed with ST:II Wrath of Khan's transfer, (the quality of the picture, in a nutshell, for those of you that don't know...) I was happy to see Star Trek Finally get a good DVD treatment. Sure, Wrath of Khan was a much better movie, but the picture quality lacked at times, and the additional scenes sometimes didn't quite match up. While ST:III has no extra scenes added, I quite enjoyed the overall viewing experiance of this one, and hope the Special Edition films that I hope will follow continue to improve the quality of the transfer. The extras on the second disc are mostly so-so, nothing that really impressed me too much, but are nice none the less.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This CD is by far one of the best Madonna CD's ever.  The songs are placed well as well as the direction of her music.  Although the music is not so disco ballish... it is more personal yet exciting in its own way... i recommend this CD to everybody... i waited a long time since MUSIC and i'm more stunned with the results that she has produced.
B000069HK2|5.0|Maybe Memories- 9/10<br />The Taste of Ink- 20/10<br />Bulimic- 9/10<br />Say Days Ago- 10/10<br />Poetic Tragedy- 12/10<br />Buried Myself Alive- 15/10<br />Box Full of Sharp Objects- 9.5/10<br />Blue and Yellow- 10/10<br />Greener With the Scenery- 9.5/10<br />Noise and Kisses- 10.5/10<br />On My Own- 10/10<br />Pieces Mended- 8.5/10<br />Choke Me- 9/10<br />The Taste of Ink is my fav song of all time.  First I disliked it but I kept listenin to it and it got better and better and finally topped &quot;Dammit&quot; by Blink-182
B000001DTM|5.0|Sure, &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; is a fantastic album, but who ever thought they'd make an album that would even bury that masterpiece?  I love how the intro to &quot;Zoo Station&quot; sounds so garbled that you wonder if your CD is messed up!!  There's nothing close to a bad song here, a claim I don't believe any other U2 CD can make.  Unlike other reviewers, &quot;Acrobat&quot; and &quot;Love is Blindness&quot; are two of my favorites on this album.  The brilliance of &quot;One&quot; goes without saying, but you can't deny that &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; is their &quot;OK Computer&quot; (shouldn't that be Radiohead's &quot;OK Computer&quot; is their &quot;Achtung Baby?&quot;)  Anywho, rare in popular music is the album that can weld sonic innovation without amazing, memorable tunes.
B000007T1M|5.0|<br /> Suite Pee- not a long song, but nothing Soad has ever written is long. Of course, it's still good. The little guitar thing in the beginning is cool. The tempo isn't extremely fast, but it's still really fast. Serj is as energetic as usual.                8/10 <BR> Know- You can't understand a word Serj is saying. It sounds like \\"ahhhhlafidabigyordanomafalao.\\" Anyway, John Dolmayan is great on drums, and Malakian is really great on the guitar. It's funny when Serj starts screaming \\"Don't ever try to fly\\" over and over. Tee Hee.   8/10<BR> Sugar- Serj is kind of rapping in this awesome song, and it's funny. It's is also funny when he talks about kicking his girlfriend. The lyrics are great. The music is great. Also, Malakian saying \\"Shuhgahh!\\" all the time is funny.   8.5/10<BR> Suggestions- One of the slower, heavier songs of the album. During the verses, the jumpy, anxious guitar is awesome.   7/10<BR> Spiders- The slowest of the songs. It's only hard on the chorus, but the riffs throughout the song are great. It's hypnotizing and relaxing and at a good place to kind of calm you down after Sugar and Suite-Pee.   8/10<BR> DDevil- God of songs. The jumpy guitar and angry vocals put together with hard pounded drums make this song a \\"listened-to-way-too-much\\" song. It includes some clever lines in the lyrics such as \\"Stupid people do stupid things, smart people out smart each other, then themselves!\\" I've listened to this song so much, I've mastered Serj's nerdy snort laugh in the middle. 9/10<BR> Soil- Awesomely nervous and angry vocals, energetic guitar. Great. 7/10<BR> War?- Ahhhhhhh... Great song. It's mixes Soad's anger against war and violence with hard edged guitar, bass, and drums. Fight the Heathens! 10/10<BR> Mind- Really slow, relaxing song. Not much guitar bashing or screaming, a lot of light drums and whispering... Then the song really gets going and makes your eardrums explode. Speed ending. Awesome. 10/10<BR> Peephole- Ooooo... Scary. Okay, this song starts out with a freaky little into, then goes into this cool carnival sounding thing. Awesome guitar bridge. Really alternative. 8/10<BR> CUBErt- Second best song on the album. It's got and awesome guitar riff and drum line. Awesome bass. Really fun song. 10/10<BR> Darts- Best song on the album. No question. Funny vocals and really fast guitar and drums. Speed metal at it's best. \\"Life threatening lifestiles. Niti Ishkur.\\" Whatever the heck that means. 46,789/10<BR> P.L.U.C.K.(Politically Lying, Unholy, Cowardly Killers)- Clever title. Anyway, It's an awesome song. It's a politically slamming piece of metal! BOOM  10/10
B00008S2VG|3.0|when i bought the album &quot;MUSIC&quot; i listened to it driving home from the store (a 15 minute drive).  I didn't get out of the car until the entire album was finished (30 minutes in my driveway with the neighbors giving me weird looks).  i turned &quot;AMERICAN LIFE&quot; off.  it perplexes me greatly to not have the same feeling i always get upon purchasing a new MADONNA album.  perhaps the greatest entertainer ever, she has never ceased to amaze me with her talent.  maybe i just need to let the songs grow on me, but i have never had to do that before.  definitely buy this album (it has a lot of good messages), but try to listen to it as someone other than a MADONNA fan.  if you have loved her as i have, you may be disappointed.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|These performances, like Home, Didn't We..., etc., are priceless.  This was, by far, my most prized DVD of 2001.  Whitney just isn't saangin' like this anymore.  I love it.
0688163173|5.0|Lehane's latest novel proves why he is a master storyteller. There are good authors and great authors but very few, like Lehane, are brilliant.  Lehane manages to creatively and brilliantly weave this story in such a way that the reader is blindsided and completely knocked off balance. He did a wonderful job of it in Mystic River and has done a masterful and utterly amazing job of it in Shutter Island. At the conclusion of this novel, the reader might start to question his/her own sanity.
B00005B36H|4.0|I know by giving this album 4 stars I'll just be considered a sheep or MTV fanboy or whatever but I dont care. I am tired of reading review for cds with people saying \\"Oh all the little nu-metal generation kids will love this but only them and only because they think it is cool.\\" I listen to music for my self and no one else and I dont need corporate rock radio and MTV to tell me what it cool and what it not.<BR>This CD is OK by Tool standards but certainly nothing incredible. Musically they are advancing but Maynards lyrics are kind of bland and cookie cutter. My favorite track is Ticks and Leeches. just because cannible corpse and nile and stuff can drum at hyper speed doesnt make them talented. The worst track is probably the last with a bunch of static and some guy talking about area 51. dont buy this just because you're linkin park buddie says its cool but if you are a tool fan or music lover pick it up.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Okay, RAY OF LIGHT is probably Madonna's ultimate masterpiece. This new disc, however, doesn't carry over any of the genius from that album. AMERICAN LIFE picks up where 2000's MUSIC left off. I admit, the computer altered vocals are a bit much at times. Overall, though, the cd is pretty good. My faves are 'Love Profusion' 'Easy Ride' and 'Nothing Fails.' I mean, is it really possible for Madonna to create a bad album? I don't think so! The lady has been a megastar for 20 years, and for good reason. The weakest track: 'I'm So Stupid.' The music itself isn't bad, but the lyrics are just plain silly. Personally, I would love to see her work with William Orbit again. Together, they made RAY OF LIGHT one of the best pieces of pop music ever created. Thankfully, the heavy electronica of this album is blended with acoustic guitars, strings, and live percussions. Long live Her Majesty, Madonna!
B000009EAD|5.0|great metal cd buy whether or not ur a fan of iced earth, personally one of my favorite albums
B0000024SI|5.0|With the opening chords of &quot;Like A Rolling Stone&quot;, Bob Dylan shook the rock music world, both lyrically and musically back to its roots and forward into a new universe.  This album is without a doubt one of the 10 most essential albums in the history of rock music, not to mention pop music in general.  From the simple monotonous organ line provided by Al Kooper and signature guitar riff from Robbie Robertson on &quot;Like A Rolling Stone&quot;, Dylan wraps his snarling, piercing vocals around some of the most recognized lyrics ever written.  &quot;From A Buick 6&quot; shows his synthesis of blues and rock with nods to Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley.  A folkie? Hah! This is a man reinventing rock'n'roll before our very ears.  <br />&quot;Tombstone Blues&quot;, &quot;Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues&quot; and the title track show that Dylan could recall the blues masters and beat that musical form into a new idiom that stood musical convention on its ear, while &quot;Queen Jane Approximately&quot; ushered in a new dynamic on the state of affairs of the heart.  Over 35 years later, this is an album that will astound, confound and flat out rock your socks off while showing the folk music world that their craft was becoming irrelevant.  Never has an artist made such a bold statement that would set the tone for not only his peers but for those to follow.  Years down the road, one can still delight in the sheer mastery of Dylan's talent and his not-too-subtle showing off of his influences.  It is one of the few albums that truly shows an artist at his creative best while paying all the right dues to what came before.<br />This is one of the most daring and innovative albums ever recorded.  Your music collection is empty if you do not own this album.
B00008OLYN|4.0|very puzzling. i read another person's review of deliverance yesterday and they said it was overdone. whatever your name was, i see where you were coming from. deliverance was lacking something. i dont know what. it was very good. but there was something missing. damnation. is good. but its nothing you didnt expect. i didnt know what to expect. when i heard it, it wasnt shocking the way radiohead's kid a was. but that doesnt mean its not a good album. its beautifully entertwined, with beat changes to keep yourattention. on the song closure, there is a very cool part where martin goes off on some handdrums. the lead layered over acoustic rythym is incredible. so subtle in a way. it is beautiful. and mikael's voice is somewhere between suicide and an angel. i cant say anything bad about the album. its not their best, but it is damn good. honestly, its solid. i stopped giving five stars to every solid album though. this is damn good, i would say buy it. even if youre new to opeth. but still life and morningrise are their best. benighted is their best acoustic song, track three from still life. if you like this album, then check out still life and damnation. and if youre new to opeth, check out morningrise. thats what i started with, and i would recommend the same to all of you. back to the topic of damnation. its beautiful. not a taste of metal. but definitely still our favorite heavy band. opeth is top notch. and this album doesnt takeaway from their resume. it only adds. i could keep going. there are lil twists. odd instruments.a mellowtron compliments of steve wilson, their saviour. i really should check out his music. an odd scale used on closure i think. and to rid of disease, and the last song, weakness, are very good. atmospheric. thats why it puzzles me. its not metal. its an atmosphere of longing. its sad, and leaves you empty, but not in a bad way. its a beautiful peaceful sadness, that you cant help but be puzzled by. and yet strangely, left in a slight awe.reminds me of sigur ros. as strange as that sounds. or robert rich. check them out too. damnation is beautiful. and its great. you cant really say anything bad about it. but its opeth, and thats par for the course.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|After reading some of the reviews on here, I had to post my own. This is a very solid CD from this band. Considering that all of the are in their 50's, it doesn't sound like they have lost anything. As a matter of fact, my first thought when listening to the CD was &quot;Yeah, sounds like classic Fleetwood Mac&quot;. Most of the songs on here are very good. And I am so glad to see Lindsey Buckingham taking some chances musically as well. Everything nowadays is so watered down and bland. This guy is a guitar genius, and songs like &quot;Murrow Turning Over In His Grave&quot; and &quot;Red Rover&quot; are killer! Stevie Nicks sounds good as well, and most of her tunes (like &quot;Say You Will&quot; and &quot;Smile At You&quot;) really add to the CD. Her voice always seemed to grate on my ears after a while, but as far as she goes, she's in top form. The last 2 songs (&quot;Say Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Baby&quot;), are the perfect way to end this solid CD! You shouldn't be disappointed!
6305508550|5.0|By far the best office movie that I've seen.  Wonderfully acted, and superbly written, this is a small budget movie everyone will like.<br />No one who sees this movie can forget the line, &quot;Why does it say paper jam, when there is no paper jam?&quot;<br />If you've been looking for a movie that you would love to watch over and over again, and still laugh at the same jokes, then this is it.  I never knew how truthful the movie was until starting my new job.  Now, I'm in a cubicle and can really &quot;feel their pain.&quot;<br />If you haven't seen this movie yet, then what are you waiting for?
0156027321|5.0|It is not so much that The Life of Pi, is particularly moving (although it is). It isn't even so much that it is written with language that is both delicate and sturdy all at once (which it is, as well). And it's certainly not that Yann Martel's vision filled passages are so precise that you begin to feel the salt water on your skin (even though they are). It is that, like Bohjalian and Byatt and all of the great Houdini's of the literary world, in the last few moments of your journey ' after you've felt the emotions, endured the moments of heartache, yearned for the resolution of the characters' struggle ' that you realize the book is not what you thought it was. The story transforms, instantly, and forever.<br />And in those last few chapters, you suddenly realize that the moral has changed as well.<br />You feel Martel's words lingering, suggesting, and you find yourself wondering whether you are his atheist who takes the deathbed leap of faith ' hoping for white light and love? Or the agnostic who , in trying to stay true to his reasonable self, explains the mysteries of life and death in only scientific terms, lacking imagination to the end, and, essentially, missing the better story?<br />There is no use in trying to provide a brief synopsis for this ravishing tale of a young boy from India left adrift in the Pacific in a lifeboat with a tiger who used to reside in his father's zoo in Pondicherry. There is no use because once you finish the book you might decide that this was not, indeed, what the book was about at all. There is no use because, depending on your philosophical bent, the book will mean something very different to your best friend than it will to you. There is no use because it is nearly impossible to describe what makes this book so grand.<br />Read this book. Not because it is an exceptional piece of literary talent. It is, of course. But there are many good authors and many good books. While uncommon, they are not endangered. Read this book because in recent memory - aside from Jose Saramago's arresting Blindness ' there have been no stories which make such grand statements with such few elements. As Pi says in his story 'Life on a lifeboat isn't much of a life. It is like an end game in chess, a game with few pieces. The elements couldn't be more simple, nor the stakes higher.' It is the same with Martel's undulating fable of a book about a boy in a boat with a tiger. A simple story with potentially life altering consequences for it's readers.<br /> As Martel writes, \\"The world isn't just the way it is. It is how we understand it, no? And in understanding something, we bring something to it, no?\\" Like Schroedinger's cat in the box, the way this book is understood, the way it is perceived, affects what it is. There has been some talk that this book will make it's readers believe in god. I think it's a question of perspective. To behold this gem of a novel as an adventure of man against the elements (the 'dry, yeastless factuality' of what actually happened) is certainly one way to go about it. But to understand this piece to be something indescribable, something godlike, is by far the greater leap of faith.<br />Oh, but worth the leap, if the reader is like that atheist ... willing to see the better story.
B00000JRTX|4.0|Although a comedy, there are some serious, sad moments in this film.  By far one of Hugh Grant's best films.<br />This movie will show the importance of love in life.  No matter how much one thinks they can do without love, they may never be truly happy.<br />Grant's character is quite the playboy.  He is completely in love with an American girl, while all of the other girls are either in love with him or hate his guts.<br />This movie will have you laughing outloud.  So, if you need a good laugh, but don't want a Dumb (or Dumber) movie, then this is the one for you.
B000035P7X|5.0|Dylan is chauffered back and forth, wades through rooms of strangers, waits around a lot. Hardly anything seems like much fun for him, but nearly all of it is interesting for the viewer. To relieve the boredom, Dylan lays into a herd of sacrificial lambs, slyly toying with some, nearly coming to blows with others. In most cases, he's doing these people a favor. (The film is bursting with confrontations. Just check Albert Grossman's crash course in \\"how to deal with hotel managers.\\") As the tour progresses, you can see him tiring, and by the time he delivers his unprovoked lecture to the 'Time' reporter, Dylan's all over the damn map. There's a glimmer of the self-righteousness that would sour his later years. <br />For the most part, however, Pennebaker's film catches Dylan at his most winning. His charisma is abundant; his intelligence and his fearlessness feed each other. Like Dylan's own music from this era, this portrait is quick, unsentimental, surprising.
0792844890|4.0|I must admit that I am a huge fan of the Star Wars films.  I have all five (and am waiting for episode III), have seen them many, many, many times, and am eager to watch them again.<br />Mel Brooks has long been one of my favorite comedians.  His humor has just the right mixture of satire, pun, self-deprecation, and down-right meanness.  Of all of the Mel Brooks movies, this is my favorite.<br />This is a great DVD.  Not much in the way of extras, but a good format, at a good price, for a great movie.  If you are in the need of a good bout of laughter, then this is for you.
B000000W6X|3.0|When you release one of the most influential and unique releases of the past 20 years, what do you do for an encore?  This is the no-win situation that Massive Attack had to face with their follow-up to 1991's seminal Blue Lines debut.  Whereas that album simultaneously combined smoky hip-hop, inspired soul, and laces of &quot;rasta&quot;, this album eschews many of those hip-hop and reggae elements in favour of soft jazz ('Weather Storm', 'Better Things', 'Heat Miser') and electronic-pop (such as the title track and 'Spying Glass').  Soundwise, it's a slightly uneasy mid-point between the raw urban flavour of Blue Lines and the unsettling bleakness of Mezzanine.  Overall, Protection is another high-quality release, but it falls well short of these two benchmark albums.  Musically and creatively, it is solid as expected (with the exception of their grating cover of 'Light My Fire' - but I didn't like the original either so there you go). However the combined danger and sensuality that marks Blue Lines and Mezzanine is conspicuously absent on Protection.  Even Nicolette's raspy voice on 'Three' and 'Sly' rings somehow hollow.  The album also fails to set a consistent groove: of the 10 songs, there are 2 jazzy instrumentals (both of them superb), 2 poppier tunes sung by Tracey Thorn, 2 eclectic cuts rapped by 3D and Tricky, 2 loungy rhythm-based grooves by Nicolette and 2 disappointingly un-reggae tracks by Horace Andy.  This grab bag of vocalists and styles overall simulates the disjointed feel of a compilation disc.  It not only lacks the cohesive flow of Blue Lines and Mezzanine, but is a bit bumpy in terms of quality as well.  The cuts by 3D/Tricky, Tracey Thorn and the instrumentals are absolutely ace, while Horace Andy's usually amazing voice grates on both 'Spying Glass' and 'Light My Fire'.  Nicolette's tracks are kind of in the middle, highly listenable but not the CD's bread and butter.  Overall this is not the Massive's strongest release, but mediocre Massive Attack is better than 90% of other bands at the top of their game.  It's a very good album that, however unfair it may be, is forced into comparison with their near-untouchable debut.  If taken on its own merits, Protection will not disappoint.
B00008DDXC|4.0|I'm a newcomer, in terms of being a Harry Potter fan.  Just before the first movie opened, I read all of the books (1-4).  Needless to say, I was very impressed with the first movie.<br />Now, I loved the second movie--I even bought it the day it came out.  But, I have to admit that the acting was not quite as good as the first.  Also, I expected better special effects--especially with the flying car.  I had hoped the car would look a little more realistic, and less like the falling Neville in the beginning of the first movie.<br />Never the less, I do recommend this movie to anyone who likes the books or the first movie.  But be prepared, as with most sequels, this is one is slightly disappointing.
B00000J7S8|3.0|Okay, so I bought this on SACD due to a recommendation(SACD is superb).  In her defense I am not usually into this type of music.  It seems to me that this CD is a little light on the jazz, and her singing is good but not what I would call powerful.  And why do I seem to think of Christmas when I hear these songs?  I must say that this CD makes me what to sleep, I guess its not for me.  To her credit she CAN sing and it seems like she has a classic style.  Too bad it bores me. If you're into SACD, I like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald.  Slow jazz similar to this, but VERY VERY good.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I waited a long time for this & it was worth it !!! Awake was good but Faceless is definitely a step further. More melodies without loosing any power, it's just incredible ! I love all the songs but Re-Align and Straight out of line are just great !!! BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!!
B00008H2LE|4.0|Okay, so Hybrid Theory was so great, its hard to come close. This CD is maybe the best we could hope for.  A little more hip-hop and a little less metal.  There are definately some innovations and new territory explored here. When I first listened to this CD, it seemed that some songs were modeled after their previous successes.  That may be true. But I do thouroughly enjoy this CD. I like &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; for its catchy rapid-fire beats. &quot;Don't Stay&quot; could actually be from their first album (its good). &quot;Hit the Floor&quot; has a crazy adrenaline pumping chorus. If you are a fan of LP, you wont be dissapointed. Just make sure you give this CD a few tries. I did NOT like it the first time I listened to it.  Now I love it. Also, check out &quot;Reanimation&quot; on DVD-audio- yes its much better than the CD.
B00005NC66|5.0|I first watched \\"Breathless\\" in a film class my Senior year in college and I was amazed by it. Although this film was made many years ago, I was blown away by the production techniques used. Some people in my film class thought the movie was stupid and made no sense, while others (including myself) found the beauty in it's ability not to stick to the norm and be compelling in a subtle way. In a time when continuity is extremely important in film, it was refreshing to see jump cuts that were made on purpose (or rather necessity since Godard had to cut the film down considerably from his original cut). Jean-Luc Godard is a true genius!<br />This film revolves around the character of Michel, a common hood, who gets mixed up in the murder of a police officer while trying to win over the heart of the woman he loves. The plot to the story is simple, but the outcome is exciting.<br />\\"Breathless\\" is definitely not for everyone. It makes you think about hidden messages, symbolism, etc. However, it is very enjoyable and entertaining. I would highly suggest this film. I think everyone should be exposed to a Jean-Luc Godard film at least once in his or her life! This is an excellent movie!
B00000IPAX|5.0|Okay, so you might think they sold out.  But I really believe that they have honed and refined their sound.  Notice how much the vocals have IMPROVED since previous CDs (where he sounds small and weak).  The songs are all great, I listen to this CD straight through.  The lyrics are catchy, relative, and SINGABLE.  Some people may not like this transition from previous CDs, but Blink was NEVER a true punk band, they weren't quite hard enough. I feel that this CD was produced and recorded better. Its just great. Nuff said. The peak of Blink 182 in my humble opinion. ;-)
B00005YW4H|4.0|I discovered this lovely young lady and her Blue Note debut, &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;, in February 2002, just the same week as &quot;Come Away&quot;'s release. A nice bluesy yet mellow voice capturing the best of Phoebe Snow and Rickie Lee Jones and a sound that was set to be mellow, jazzy, and sustained. After being well impressed on a jazz showcase that February, I purchased her album for under eight dollars and it was a pretty nice album, I must say. Not perfect in the least but for what it was, very impressive.<br />Although, the music seems to fall asleep at times and Norah's playing needs more energy, it's satin-y seduction music. Not torchy, just right and mellow. One or two detractors would complain back before &quot;Come Away&quot;'s sleeper mainstream success came underway but ever since the album hit #1, hit 10 million, won up a storm at the annual Grammys, and made Norah a pop starlet, haters are coming in right and left. That's terrible if you're just saying you don't like media because of it's success. It makes sense if the music isn't for you or if you dislike it, that's called human taste BUT just bad-mouthing it because you're upset with it's level of success is called jealousy. Don't get it confused. <br />&quot;Come Away&quot; doesn't promise to be a classic or Nina Simone(RIP)/ Ella level vocal music. Not at all. It's the first entry to a exquisitely talented young lady's career. Very flawed like most debuts are but in the age of Avril Lavigne and 50 Cent, the fact that mellow loungey pop/jazz-blues hits #1 is a revelation in the world of chart-pop. Stop hating on the child's success and congratulate. (3.7 stars)
B00004Z459|5.0|Okay, so MANY people have opinions. Mine is that this CD is great. They are pioneers in this field. I don't see how you can say that they re-hash or reinterepret anything. They are trend setters.  I can listen to this straight through and love every minute of it.  Buy this CD, you will like it.  Their new one isn't bad, but not this good. &quot;Points of Authority&quot; and &quot;Place for my Head&quot; are great.  If you like this CD too, check out &quot;Reanimation&quot;, especially on DVD-audio (although you most likely DON'T have a DVD-A player).
B00008S2VG|2.0|Madonna's always been a good manipulator. Toying with one artificially intriguing public image after the next, exposing her dirty laundry gleefully in public, and manipulating the public time and time again. Madonna's one of the top five businesswomen in the music industry. But while having a great stock in business is definitely admired, what about musically? Since this IS music, isn't it? Well, Madonna, a '80s megastar on par with Michael Jackson, Prince, and Bruce Springsteen has always been an afterthought musically. Celebrity boyfriends(and, eh, girlfriends), interesting music videos and well-done publicity stunts have always superceded her musical contributions. Yeah, \\"Like A Virgin\\", \\"Holiday\\" or the retrospectively tarty \\"Vogue\\" are memorable frothy dance-pop but timeless pieces of music, they aren't. While MJ, Prince, and Springsteen have at least three classic albums to their credits, Madonna doesn't. She just doesn't. So, this leads one to question if Madonna in a way is like a Zsa Zsa Gabor type. Famous for notoriety and what she WAS.<br />\\"American Life\\", her first new release since 2000's \\"Music\\", gives some leeway into the aforementioned idea. The album's theme is fame. Questioning fame, wondering if fame made you the same person. But since Madonna's a grade A manipulator, one wonders if this is truly from the gut or just an attempt from an egotistical superstar who looking for ways to stay relevant. The title track and leadoff single, just isn't too enjoyable. A stiff techno-lite opens with strumming guitars on the chorus. The lyrics are empty and Madonna's slightly altered vocals don't elevate anything. For a mainstream pop artist, the song isn't catchy or danceable so you wonder if it'll do well on the radio. A miss. \\"Hollywood\\" and many of the proceeding tracks are very similar. Too the point where they sound like one big, long song. The electronica sound and sticky guitar-based pop melodies mix like oil and milk this time around. None are memorable and sound very conceited. From the mind of an attention-craving person who thinks her problems merit more than others. Like her '80s counterpart, Michael Jackson, Madonna takes herself way too seriously. She thinks she's her own religion. Whether if this is due to the media's persistence of treating her like some musical revolution or her own super-high level of fame, it doesn't measure up. Whereas Michael can claim decades worth of imitators. Madonna can claim who? Britney Spears? Pink? She revolutionized female images of sex and gloss, not music and presentation like Mike did. Therefore his severely big ego is a bit more justified. <br />Anyway, back on the topic of \\"American Life\\", there are some good moments. \\"Nothing Fails\\" features a London choir and a Gospel feel for extra depth. Although the song isn't powerful, it's sense of wanting is very impressive. \\"Die Another Day\\", originally featured as the Bond theme in the movie of the same name late last year, isn't too memorable but a good listen in the Madonna tradition. <br />Ultimately, \\"American Life\\" is a mediocre release from a past megastar who's simply isn't as powerful or interesting as she once was. I, personally, recommend, downloading this release, or simply going for something a tad more substantial. No disrespect to her legions of dedicated fans but this album just is rather limp, boring, and self-absorbed. American life, it's not
B00007BK2N|3.0|The history of Factory Records and Hacienda in Manchester, UK, told through the life of TV Personality and music afficianado Tony Wilson from 1976-94. Very likable film, with due respect paid to the giants of the scene: Joy Division (especially Ian Cutis), New Order, and The Happy Mondays. The music running through the film is, of course, spectacular, and for those of us who missed the early days, the recreation of the club and concerts was spectacular.
B00005JLRT|3.0|The problem with a franchise like Star Trek is that it has a very committed and opinionated fan base, and so these fans will tend to be overly-critical and aggressive about their feelings regarding anything new in the franchise. Star Trek has the benefit of being based in a very broad and immersive universe that is made up of a dynamic and diverse cast of characters. This is both a blessing and a curse: a blessing because in each new motion picture installment there is a lot to build from; a curse because it can be difficult to stay true to the characters and the spirit behind the universe.<br />When making a film from the Next Generation television series, one would be confronted with two problems: the first being that the series was at times uneven and muddled; the second being that there is a different expectation in a film than in a television show. That being said, it is the characters that made the series great, and the thing that made First Contact (Trek film #8) such a resounding success is that even though it had action, it was primarily character-based and the plot had all the things that make Trek fans salivate: time travel, tough decisions and a great villain(s). I mean, really, does it get better than the Borg?<br />My girlfriend (who is a die-hard fan) and I went to see this with high hopes, and left with mixed feelings. Overall, it was a pretty decent film. It was well-paced and the action was decent. The starship battle at the end was as good as the one in Wrath of Kahn (the best of the Trek films), and the special effects were top notch. Plus, to her delight, we got to see Riker and Troi get married.<br />However, there were some acute problems, the most glaring being the overuse of Captain Picard. The director, Stuart Baird, does not treat this like the ensemble cast-driven film that it should be. Furthermore, the carefree and loose attitude that Picard seems to have developed (a dune-buggy?) is not consistent with the character that the fans grew to know and love over the television series' seven years on the air. This isn't helped by the fact that his storyline feels contrived. The motivation that the Romulans have for building a Picard-clone (his \\"nemesis\\" in the film) is flimsy and almost laughable (kind of like America's own Missile Defense Shield). Furthermore, I felt cheated by the back-story of the planet Remus (they must really dig on Roman mythology).<br />Data's storyline is old-hat, and is merely a satellite to Picard's - and everyone else is just a peripheral. I found myself wishing that Picard would just die, just so we could see some more of the other characters. The wedding scene was ok, but too short. The romantic relationship that Troi and Warf began to develop in the series goes unmentioned (again!), and a chance for some great dramatic tension between him and Riker was completely missed.<br />Nitpicking aside however, it was a decent film and clearly better than the pile of you-know-what that was Star Trek V (as one reviewer asserted) or than its muddled predecessor, Insurrection. It was entertaining, and the plot holes, even if annoying, were forgivable. The drama on Romulus was interesting, and Shinzon's ship (can't remember the name) was threatening and scary. Despite my complaints about Picard, Patrick Stewart is still a great actor and the tension that develops between him and Shinzon is engrossing (could you kill a clone of yourself?). There are some great philosophical quandaries that are raised, even if they aren't explored much, and it was suspenseful. It was Trek film that was made with its eye on the passing fan and the general public rather than the die-hard fan - which brings me back to the point that I raised earlier about the expectations for making a film being different than for a television series. In order for a studio to green-light a big-budget film like this one, it has to have broad appeal. If the film were to depend too much on obscure references and be ensemble-cast centered, it would not be nearly as appealing to Johnny Public - even if it would make a better film.<br />What I would ask for is a longer cut: I would watch 2 ½ hours of this film if it meant that I could see more of everyone else (not another dune-buggy chase). The rumored deleted scenes sound as if they would make a killer director's cut. In future Trek films I would ask for more Brent Spiner (he is a great actor, probably the best in the bunch), for Geordi to get his cool visor back, for Picard to be treated like the Captain of a crew rather than an action star, and lastly, for a plot that involves more of the rich Trek universe, thank you.ast centered, it would not be nearly as appealing to Johnny Public - even if it would make a better film.<br />What I would ask for is a longer cut: I would watch 2 ½ hours of this film if it meant that I could see more of everyone else (not another dune-buggy chase).

B00008BXJF|5.0|This is the best of 2003 so far (April). <br />It may be the best King Crimson since Red--the best of a very good bunch.<br />Many parts are as heavy as Red; the guitars sound as though they will melt steel--yet they are wonderfully melodic and eerie.<br />Other sections are sweetly acoustic.<br />The arrangements are super: varied and unexpected and full of surprises.<br />But the most amazing part to me is the newfound flexibility of Adrian Belew's voice.  At times he sounds like John Lennon.  At times like Don Henley.  At times even like Alan Price.  He also, at the first and last, sounds like himself, Robo Belew.<br />All in all a tour de force.<br />If you like any King Crimson, I think you will like this.
0786915749|5.0|I read this book when it first came out almost 20 years ago. When I saw that it had been rereleased, I immediately bought all three books in the series for my kids. <br />This series is heavily reminiscent of the Dungeons and Dragons fantasy role playing game, and brings to life an epic adventure that I enjoyed as much today as I did when I was a teenager. <br />A wonderful must read for anyone who loves fantasy...
B00008PW3Q|5.0|There are only two albums I've been looking forward to this year, Fleetwood Mac's  and later this year, Deep Purple's. The inside \\"industry\\" buzz on both of these records was...great stuff.<BR>Well, Fleetwood Mac's \\"Say You Will\\" is indeed a great album so this reassures me about Deep Purple in September. <BR>Now back to Mac's \\"Say You Will\\". I liked all the songs on first listen. <BR>I didn't mind the production at all. In fact I loved it! Thanks Lindsey.<BR>I loved all the songs by the second and third listens. <br />I also appreciate  that the CD is 76+ minutes.  <BR>I don't know about you, but I get stuck in a lot of traffic jams. Hey, if you don't like all the songs, just burn a disc of your favorites and play producer.<BR>One last note. To be honest I never have been a huge Stevie Nicks fan, but after hearing her songs, I was very impressed and even a bit...turned on, you might say. <BR>With so many \\"light weight\\" female vocalists out there, I guess I've forgotten what a \\"real\\" woman sounded like coming through my speakers. <BR>Favorite songs: What's The World Coming To, Illume, Thrown Down, Say You Will, Peacekeeper, Come, Running Through The Garden, Steal Your Heart Away and Goodbye Baby. <BR>That's one down and one to go!
0385507755|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  Frey's a man at home with brutality, which makes his compassion extraordinarily compelling.  The book is filled with characters whose circumstances (addiction) force them to come to terms with themselves and their lives.  What their recovery program, which binds them together, would have them come to terms with, however, is their ADDICTION.  To do this, they, Frey included, are offered 12 steps to which they're expected, even commanded, to adhere--lest they die (literally).  <br />Frey tells these character's stories with the same honesty, clarity, and immediacy that he tells his own.  Yet, he sets himself apart by steadfastly refusing to give himself over to the program, and, most pointedly, by declining to place responsibility for himself, his life and actions, over to a higher power.  <br />Frey chooses instead to take ultimate responsibility for himself and his relation to the world.  It's his choosing of this other course that makes Frey's story applicable to us all. His life story (up to age 23) is more dramatic than most, but the core issue he's chosen to address is universal:  How does one face oneself, others, and the world truthfully and without fear?       <br />A Million Little Pieces is a highly entertaining read, written in a style that marries the edge of Henry Miller with the poetry of Jack Kerouac, that serves as reflection, guide, and inspiration.  I hope it receives the status and readership it deserves.  Keep it up, Mr. Frey.  I can't wait for the next book.
B00008S2VH|4.0|Is American Life a breakthrough for madonna...or for music itself? -not really. it is rather an extension of her last album MUSIC, with more arpeggiated guitar, chirpy sometimes pastel mirwais beats & effects, and it seems with every album madonna gets more introspective & personal. The album is instantly recognizable as madonna music; the classic hooks in the songwriting are all there. Warm vocals & vocal layering dominate as in much of her more current albums. But almost gone is the sense of street life in her music...the grit of her teenage years, and the use of her upper register in her singing voice. Perhaps only in \\"I'm So Stupid\\" does she re-explore that territory. Beautiful harmonies and textures abound, but if you're looking for that 'shock & awe' dimension in other madonna material you won't find it here. Madonna has evolved-and she's honest about it. Luckily she still has that sense of adventure: madonna rap anyone? -Like it or not, madonna always gets her kudos as a risk-taker. American Life succeeds in capturing the present;The juxtaposition and melding of technology and human expression(example: signature & extreme use of vocorders). Long live madonna! Everyone will have favorites, but-Standout tracks:Hollywood,Stupid,Intervention,Nothing fails,Die Another Day(if none of us heard it before!), Mother&Father.
B000031WBV|5.0|I owned this recording of the Nocturnes on vinyl many years ago and have just got around to purchasing it on CD. I presently own many, many wonderful recordings of Chopin's Nocturnes. However, listening to the Rubinstein's recording again, after so many years, was like going home (in the best sense of the phrase). I love the Nocturnes; they are my favorite works of Chopin. All I can say is that Rubinstein's recordings are, indeed, the best! I love all my recordings of the Nocturnes; but the Artur Rubinstein's recording, of them, sooth my soul and emotionally move me down to the very marrow of my bones. The recording, honestly, moves me to tears. <BR>If you love Chopin and love his Nocturnes, as I do, buy this recording; there is none better!

B00008S2VF|5.0|No other pop star is as creative and musically gifted in expressing themselves as is Madonna, just listen to her last few albums. American Life runs the course from strummy folk to funky pop and allows the listener to delve into Madonna's fascinating psyche. This album is nothing short of a masterpiece.

B00008S2VG|5.0|There are some things in life one expects, to be young, grow up, age into adulthood and to buy a Madonna album, a good Madonna album and \\"American Life\\", is not good, IT IS AWESOME!  EVERY and I mean EVERY song on this album is good.  At this point Madonna can not disappoint and once again she doesn't.  From \\"American Life\\" to the last track \\"Easy Ride\\".  This album flows very well.  In the 11 tracks on the album all have an equal shot at being a single.  The title track which already is amazing, and \\"Die Another Day\\" which hit #8, have started this album off.  If Madonna was going to pick single #2, I would go with either,  \\"Intervention\\", \\"Nothing Fails\\" or \\"Easy Ride\\".  But that is just a suggestion any of the 11 could be next the album's that good.  Also the album and songs on it are very honest and rich.  \\"Mother And Father\\" is a time capsule that sums up Madonna's early life and her religion.  I listened to this all the way through, and I even bought two CD's because simply put, the CD will get played alot.  Madonna is always a breath of fresh air and I still get excited and still look forward to buying her albums, THE DAY it comes out, she is about  the only artist I do that with, because she can do no wrong, I mean what else musically does she have to prove.  By the way her first album \\"Madonna\\" turns 20 years old this year, incredible isn't it. \\"Love Profusion\\" and \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" are also standouts on this CD.  This album recieves an A++++.

B00008S2VG|2.0|I've been a fan since I was in the single digit age bracket.  I have ever album madonna ever made, plus most of the remixes, etc.  I've only been fortunate enough to see her live, once, on the last tour.  Every time a new album is released i go out and buy it that day.  I did the same yesterday, bought it, brought it home, sat down, and listened the the whole thing, beginning to end.<br />I was not impressed.  \\"Music\\" seemed very fresh and new, and daring even, when it was released.  This album seems like a collection of all the B sides to Music, with the same musical elements and structures, and same electronic techniques used on the last album.<br />I'm sorry Madonna, but it did NOT make me dance.  I'm going to go home today and listen to it again;  a couple of the tracks are salvageable, I think, but most of them i really didn't like.  The vocal-synth thing i find annoying, and i really wish she wouldn't use such over-simplified lyrics either - it's not poetic AT ALL, despite the obvious rhyme schemes.  The title track i think is just lame - i mean, who is she kidding?:<br />\\"Do I have to change my name<br />Will it get me far<br />Should I lose some weight<br />Am I gonna be a star\\"<br />what kind of lyrics are those to open up an album? i don't know if she's trying to show us how \\"real\\" she is by referring to her self-image problems or talking about grocery shopping or whatever, but the mundane details and the colloquial phrasing of everything just seemed really .... blah.<br />anyway, as a lifelong fan, this is NOT her best work AT ALL - Ray of Light and Music were both phenomenal, IMO, and this one just falls flat.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Following the poor follow up to 1998's opus \\"Ray of Light\\", Madonna's pop-dance-happy \\"Music\\" left us with nowhere to go, but now with Madonna's latest release \\"American Life\\", we understand an all new beauty and intimacy with Madonna. \\"American Life\\" is an album so emotionally driven and complex lyrically that it is, in my own humble opinion, the greatest disc the diva has ever recorded.<br />Lets start with a track-by-track, shall we?<br />1.) American Life - A techno song that blatantly spills Madonna's viewpoint on fame and fortune. The rap towards the end is something new and fun, something that reminds us of Blondie's comeback in 1999, \\"No Exit\\".<br />2.) Hollywood - \\"check it out, this bird has flown\\", Madonna's out of Hollywood's cliche and she's all the better for it.<br />3.) I'm So Stupid - Here a song about waking up. Reality.<br />4.) Love Profusion - A little love song, maybe written for Madonna's Guy?<br />5.) Nobody Knows Me - Here we return to the buzzy techno dance, and its welcomed and cherished at this point. \\"No one's telling you how to live your life, but its a setup, until your fed up.\\"<br />6.) Nothing Fails - This song brings tears to my eyes when I hear it. The most beautiful song on this album. A love song, a hopeful song. A song for happiness. \\"Nothing fails, no more tears, nothing fails, you washed away my tears...\\"<br />7.) Intervention - Another little love song, very pretty.<br />8.) X-Static Process - A great idea, Madonna! A gorgeous, breathtaking lullaby set to a guitar.<br />9.) Mother and Father - A song about Madonna's having to grow up without a mother when she was a child. Here we have techno again.<br />10.) Die Another Day - In my opinion, the greatest song to ever be written by Madonna and I can say that cause I've been a fan of her's for so long. The lyrics, something I attach to. The music, something that I love to listen to. Her voice, gorgeous. The power and drama behind this song is irresistable and the lyrics are innovative and powerhouse songwriting skills.<br />11.) Easy Ride - The most perfect way to end the album, a beautiful song continuing the use of a string arrangement from 'Die Another Day'. This is probably my second favorite song on the album. The lyrics are wonderful and the message, for sure, something new for Madonna: the \\"material girl\\" is no more.<br />Final Verdict: 5 Stars<br />Best Madonna album ever to grace the market.innovative and powerhouse songwriting skills. <br />11.)

B00008S2VG|1.0|What is Madonna thinking?  This has got to be the worst album of 2003.  \\"American Life\\" the first single is a weak weak song.  Very boring, no rhythm, and I really don't care what Madonna has to say about her 3 nannys, her driver, and her millions, and that she is living the american dream, blah, blah, blah....and RAPPING?,...what can I say, I saw the video on MTV and I was honestly embarrassed for Mrs. Guy Ritchie.<br />The video though she changed it at last minute, (wrong decision) has her singing in front of a bunch of flags in uniform.  Her new dark look doesn't look good on the mid 40s Madonna.  She looks better blonde.  She is aging as we all are, and honestly in the video she looked like a War Monger ....<br />The rest of the album is just a electronic mess.  She peaked at \\"Ray of Light\\", now her music career is going the direction of her movie career,...the sewer.<br />20 years a fan, and this is what I get.  Warning to all Madonna fans this is a loser.<br />I would give it NO STARS if I could, but it is saved by \\"Die Another Day\\" single from the James Bond movie from the same name.<br />Oh, Madonna - music was always your way out of having talent, now you showed it is time to hang up your Material Girl wardrobe, and focus on PTA meetings....and 3 nannys - maybe it is time to spend time with the children - a one on one type of thing, or the children will be calling the nannys Mama Ritchie.<br />Absolutely the worst album of 2003 or in the last 10 years.
B00005JLRT|5.0|It's hard to determine just which one was better, Nemesis or First Contact. This can easily been one of the two best Star Trek Films of all time. Keep them coming Paramount.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Over the past 20 years of Madonna`s career, she`s constantly evolved as an artist. This is her first album in 3 years and it`s suprisingly good. It sounds like she put a lot of effort into it and it sounds almost as good as Ray of Light. She tries a variety of new things on this album such as rap and more techno plus a more in depth look into Madonna the person. The lyrics are well written as well. There are so many good songs on this album that it`s hard to pick a favorite. The only thing I really didn`t like was all the techno beats because it gets annoying after a while.
0783226063|5.0|When I initially saw Lynch's version of Dune, I was very impressed. The story of Paul fulfilling his destiny inspired me. This also made great use of voiceovers, which correlate to the book very well. I didn't read the book till many years later, and while Lynch's version perhaps captures the spirit of Dune in many ways, it lacks in some key areas. Harrison's version also had its flaws, but I think it addressed these things better:<br />1. Stillsuits - When I saw Harrison's version, I was disappointed in their stillsuits, because in Lynch's version, the stillsuits look awesome. However, Harrison's stillsuits make much more sense. First of all, Lynch's stillsuits are dark black, which means they would absorb more heat, which means they would likely use up more of a person's water. Second, Fremen are an evasive, secretive people. It would be a lot easier to hide in Harrison's tan stillsuits than Lynch's black stillsuits. Third, Lynch's stillsuits look almost too professional, while Harrison's look more like they were simply made.<br />2. Weirding Way - The weirding way that was so central to Lynch's battles was not in the spirit of the book. Harrison's Dune portrayed the weirding way like it was, controlling one's body and judging an opponent.<br />3. Paul and the Fremen - Kyle MacLachlan had a stronger presence than Alec Newman, and yes, Newman's character whined a lot at the beginning. MacLachlan's Paul had no real coming of age though, and didn't seem to really wrestle with doubt. Newman's Paul didn't have all the answers and was unsure of himself. He had to grow into his role. He wasn't automatically seen as the savior of the Fremen. It is even alluded to that he is manipulating the Fremen. In these respects, Newman's Paul was truer to the book.<br />All in all, I think Lynch's Dune is a better overall motion picture, but compared to the book, the journey is too perfect. Harrison's Dune is darker and more complicated, and in that respect, it captures the book muchbetter.
B00008PW3Q|1.0|Although Stevie Nicks turns in a few good songs here -- &quot;Running Through The Garden&quot;, &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot;, &quot;Destiny Rules&quot; -- Lindsey Buckingham's songs are rather disappointing. Creative? Experimental? No way! Let's just acknowledge the obvious... Christine McVie held the real appeal for listening to Fleetwood Mac (the voices of McVie and Nicks together was always magical). Without Christine McVie, there is no Fleetwood Mac! I won't give &quot;Say You Will&quot; a second listen. If you want good Fleetwood Mac, listen to anything from &quot;Kiln House&quot; to &quot;The Dance&quot; .
B00004U8DV|1.0|This album is so bad, it's almost worth owning. Track after plodding track astonishes. When I listen to this album, I feel intensely sorry for the other members of The Doors. An obviously inebriated Jimbo sounds like he couldn't decide whether to throw up or to go to sleep, so instead he went to the studio and cut some tracks. His vocals are shockingly [bad] and painfully off-key. He actually SOUNDS fat! Seriously...check it out! To make matters worse, at least half of the tunes sound like Morrison made up the abysmal lyrics as he went along. There are a couple tunes where apparently the other Doors managed to get their fearless leader semi-sobered up or at least convinced him to come up with some [bad]lyrics in advance (Riders on the Storm being the best of these), but they are the exception. Mostly the tunes are lazy, generic blues variations that a below-average bar band would be ashamed to call their own. And Morrison turns in the least convincing \\"blues\\" vocals this side of Eric Clapton's From The Cradle (yikes!)! This is bad, bad stuff. That said, it's pretty [] funny if you have a perverse enough sense of humor, and it's a great party album if your friends have a similar sense of humor. I guess nothing's all bad.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I'm not sure I can string together mere words that will effectively communicate how much I love Fleetwood Mac's new CD Say You Will.  <br />I've been a fan from the very beginning...actually from the Buckingham Nicks time period.  I remember way back then trying to convince friends to buy the Buckingham Nicks album because I thought I had discovered something truly amazing.  And now nearly 30 years later, here I go again...telling everyone they have to run out to buy Say You Will.<br />While Christine McVie has retired to England, the essense of FM is so very much alive and kicking hard.  Say You Will is as good as Rumours, if not better because of its social commentary content.  To say this CD rocks would be an understatement.  While  Rumours was based on the open wounds of Fleetwood Mac's interpersonal relationships gone bad, Say You Will is just as raw and personal, though this time around FM is not the source of inspiration.  <br />Stevie is still the center of attention as far as I'm concerned.  I feel the true standout on this entire CD is EVERYBODY FINDS OUT.  This song rocks.  The emotion with which Stevie sings this songs conveys everything.  There is an urgency and some desperation to this song.  The use of horns and strings shows maturity and refinement that is something a bit different for FM.  <br />Another Stevie standout is GOODBYE BABY.  I've read a few music publication reviews of this song and I wonder why the \\"professionals\\" seem to miss the obvious.  As another review here mentioned, this song seems to be a lullaby song to an aborted baby...while most people see this as a song about a romantic breakup.  Stevie's voice has never ever been better.<br />WHAT'S THE WORLD COMING TO, ED MURROW TURNING OVER IN HIS GRAVE and PEACEKEEPER are awesome anthems for the times we live in. Gee, from the first drum beat of WHAT'S THE WORLD COMING TO,  I could tell the Mac was definitely back.  While some disagree with anti-war sentiment, PEACEKEEPER really touched my heart and is so thought provoking.  I realize few people know or remember Ed Murrow, but I have to agree with Lindsey...I'm sure he's turning over in his grave.  Ed Murrow was a true pioneering reporter.  News today is nothing more than a TV program used to attract viewers...Ed is turning over in his grave!<br />Stevie's first two songs...ILLUME and THROWN DOWN are shining examples of Stevie's song crafting abilities.  ILLUME tells Stevie's story about being stuck in NYC during the events of 9/11.  I know those events all too well since Stevie cancelled her concert in my hometown because she was stuck in NY.  While THROWN DOWN is yet another take on love.  I'm in awe of anyone who can write a song with the word \\"barricade\\" in it and have it come out as a hit!<br />MIRANDA and RED ROVER are typically experiement Lindsey.  RED ROVER seems to have political content with mentions of red, white and blue...<br />SAY YOU WILL is the most \\"Christine\\"-like song on this CD.  <br />The music of DESTINY RULES recalls WORLD TURNING.  <br />SMILE AT YOU is an awesome old song that fans have been dying for since hearing it in the bootlegs that are available.  <br />Something is evident.  Lindsey may very well be the perfect producer for Stevie.  I compare and contrast IT'S ONLY LOVE from Trouble in Shangri La to GOODBYE BABY...Sheryl Crow's production of IT'S ONLY LOVE results in a moody and drab sound, while Lindsey's production of GOODBYE BABY is so much better.  <br />Say You Will proves two things...Lindsey is brilliant beyond the recognition he has received and Stevie is still the reigning Queen of singer/songwriters.  <br />As awesome as Rumours is/was, Rumours has already lived through its first run and its second coming via The Dance.  Say You Will is fresh and modern.  It takes chances but doesn't alienate like Tusk did.  Lindsey uses a \\"voice in a tunnel affect\\" in several songs...EVERYBODY FINDS OUT starts off this way.  Whatever it is, I like it!  It's weird, it'sdifferent, but it's interesting in a way only Lindsey could offer.  <br />In summary...it's been one week since the release of Say You Will.  It's the only CD I have listened to since I purchased it one week ago.  I listen to it while driving to and from work...I put my headphones on each night and listen to it straigh through.  There is so much substance here...repeated listenings are necessary to take in all of awesome talent that is present.

B000001ESJ|5.0|A Farewell To The Kings(1977). Rush's 5th studio album. <br />Coming fresh off of the major underground success of the album 2112(1976), Rush follows up nicely with perhaps their greatest album of the 70s. The band were certainly rocking harder than ever, with Alex full-decked on the heavy electric guitars, along with Neil's dexteritous drum playing, and Geddy's thumping bass being stronger than ever before. Synthesizer pedals were brought forth into the music for the first time, and adds a nice backdrop touch to perfect the impact of their songs. AFTTK has something for all fans of Rush: two commercially successful short songs, two long epics, and two short undiscovered gems. <br />As for the main theme to this album, half of the songs have to do with some kind of quest or search for a certain paradise or mystery of some kind. The other half are about the effects of human nature in a society. I know that many people can interpret what each song means far better than I can, but I will provide a brief explanation of the tracks, so please bear with me. Here's the breakdown track-by-track: <br />1) A Farewell To The Kings- Excellent rocker. This song is about the struggle between people of a society and it's powerful tyrannical minority. It starts out and ends with acoustic guitar parts, but in between them is a hard rocking section with excellent riffs and strong-delivering vocals. This song actually received a bit of radio play. 9/10 <br />2) Xanadu- A phenomenal 11-minute epic, which is about the quest to find Xanadu, the land of paradise and everlasting life. However, when paradise is obtained, the adventurer remains there for 1000 years and realizes that his paradise is really full of loneliness and despair. The synth at the beginning creates a nice ambience before Alex cuts in with the guitars. It alternates between several fast and slow parts. 10/10 <br />3) Closer To The Heart- The BIG RADIO HIT, and one of the greatest fan-favorite Rush songs to date. The songis about people expressing themselves in their own ways, in order to bring themselves \\"closer to the heart\\". Brief, yet still outstanding. 10/10 <br />4) Cinderella Man- A semi-acoustic guitar-driven rocker. This song is the story of a rich man who is just trying to be friendly, is ended up being branded \\"insane\\" by the poor majority. He tries to help them, but the more he does the worse it gets. Not very long, but a good song overall. 9/10 <br />5) Madrigal- An acoustic-ballad type song about love triumphing over all of the hardships and distractions of life. This song has a good melody to it, but it's WAY TOO SHORT. Not bad by any means, but its brevity makes it seem like a wasted opportunity. 7/10 <br />6) Cygnus X-1- The other sci-fi epic of the album, and part one of a two part mega-epic. It's about the journey of an astronaut through space into the black hole of the constellation Cygnus, in order to find out what lurks beyond. Starts off with a digitized speech and droning synth effects and then explodes into a versatile rocker. Arguably the strongest track on the whole album and maybe the best of the long epics, as each part flows together nicely. Not just the lyrics, but the instrumentation playing perfectly describes each part of the journey through space, making this one hell of a rollercoaster ride of guitar, bass, and drums. Geddy's vocals are also let loose with the intense passion. Kudos guys. Kudos. 10/10 <br />Overall, I consider this album to be Rush's zenith of the progressive 70s era. Even though the followup Hemispheres(1978) is their most progressive effort, Farewell contains a stronger set of tracks that can appeal to all sorts of Rush fans. Five stars for musicianship, production, and songwriting. If you're first getting into Rush, Moving Pictures(1981), or Permanent Waves(1980) may be the best place to start, but if looked at closely, AFTTK is definitely a rocking suitable alternate. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. PICK THIS UP NOW.
0972169504|5.0|I just finished my PhD after seven long years and let me tell you: this strip captures the very essence of that experience.  It kept me sane during the long trials and it kept me LAUGHING, which is always a key to keeping one foot going in front of the other.  I highly recommend it to ANYONE still in the midst of a PhD, or those who, like me, still have the memory fresh in our minds.  Highlights include Newton's three laws of graduate school (my favorite: Every action towards graduation has an equal and opposite distraction), and many other priceless moments.  BUY IT!
0451169514|5.0|I've already read several King's books, amongst them Christine, Nightmares and Dreamscapes and The Stand, but in my opinion It is far the best. It's a thrilling book from the begining to the end. The characters are so real that it's impossible not to find some resemblances between them and someone from our own childhood. Of course, for Christ sake, the similarities end at this point. This is a very enjoyable book and it has some really scary passages. Past and present are perfectly knitted togehter in a saga which started in Derry, Maine at former times and ends around 1985. To make it short, last weekend I was wandering downtown just few days after having finished the book when I absently look at a drain and amused myself thinking: Yes, it was just a story, but what if...<BR>Who knows what really runs in all those dark, dripping and moldering galleries of pipes under the city?
0553583182|5.0|I did not know before reading this book that all my problems I created myself.  I changing my way of thinking and started putting effort into myself rather than into a situations.  I am more confident more effective and am better at life. If you open yourself up to ideas and put this book into pratice the sky is the limit.  Believe in you.
B00000099Y|5.0|After reading some of these reviews i find some people don't like fillers.  Well if the fillers have no emotion-then yes they are pointless.  But the fillers in this album set the actual songs into stone, completing this album.  Plus This is my second favorite album ever next to lateralus so i figure id help out tool and see if we can get them up to a full 5 star average :D.
B00008S2VG|4.0|This album has left many to question. Perhaps one of Madonna's most revealing albums, American Life is a stop along Madonna's musical journey that is most humbling to listen to. The queen of pop takes time here to remind us that she is only human. Believe whichever review you wish, American Life belongs to Madonna both lyrically, and musically. It is richly layered with dynamic chords, keys, organic, and inorganic sounds. The beats off each song are completely unexpected, yet lyrically the most revealing. It's no Ray of Light by any means but further along in the direction Music was going. Alot more guitar and rich vocals. A great delivery from Madonna! <br />High points: American Life, I'm so stupid, Love Profusion, Nothing Fails,  X-static Process<br />Low point: Mother and Father
0140177396|5.0|This book takes place in Soledad,CA. It taking about two migrant workers Lennie and George. George is \\"small and quick and dark of face\\". \\"Lennie, a huge man has the mind of a young child\\". George like a father that taking care his trouble son Lennie. Lennie is a trouble maker, he made a lot of trouble.

B00008S2VG|1.0|I can't say I'm a \\"Madonna Fan\\", because to do so, would indicate being a 'fanatic'.  I have, however, always felt Ms. Ciccone to be a very accomplished artist, talented, daring, impervious to \\"more of the same\\" on each subsequent album.  I thought her \\"Sex\\" book was brilliant, and [hey, shoot me], I even enjoy her movies and appreciate her as an actress.  But another album with Mirwais behind the keyboards and ProTools console was a mistake.  His obnoxious bleeps, squiggles and other annoying synth sounds are just too repetitious, so soon after \\"Music\\".  None of the songs are even remotely interesting, musically.  Madonna's lyrics have become more confessional and she exposes a lot of what she feels, as she seems to review her twenty years in the biz.  But MUSICALLY, (forgive me, Maddie), this album reeks.  It's the first musical disappointment I've experienced with a Madonna album ever.  My feeling is you set William Orbit (an all-out GENIUS) out to pasture way too soon.  You reached a musical zenith with \\"Ray Of Light\\".  \\"Music\\" was mildly entertaining, as perhaps a side project.  But it's time to do a real Madonna album again, and \\"American Life\\" just isn't it.  I can only hope for genius in the form of various remixes.  I will keep this CD so my Madonna discography stays intact, but I sincerely doubt I will ever give this CD another spin...

0743216458|5.0|Excellent story about the brave men who fought for our freedoms. All Americans who appreciate freedom, need to read this book to understand the cost of freedom. <BR>The book is written in a style, which is easy to read. Ambrose goess into great depth to understand the nature of these men and their willingness to deny self for the war effort. I haven't seen the HBO miniseries, but this has inspired me to do such. I especiaaly liked the last chapter, when he gave updates on the men post-war
B00008S2VG|5.0|This album is Madonna come full circle. Throughout her career she has been able to evolve as a performer, an artist but most importantly as a human being. Always 10 steps ahead everyone else, her talent is exuberant and she has an unsatiable apetite to learn. She will always have something to say, and as long as she does I will listen. She is the ultimate rock star.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|music is awesome but they lost the old drummer and sully still does his own thing when he sings...but overall cd is good i recommend tracks 1,2,3,5,6 the others are not bad but these tracks are the ones which shine.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Well, here it is, the long-awaited 12th album by the almighty Linkin Park. As history has shown, a band that constantly evolves and mantains high-quality standards and integrity in their music does go far. That is why LP has received numerous tribute albums, as has musician extraordinnaire Eminem...I do not want to get any more nauseous, so I'll stop right here. This new album, their 2nd really, offers absolutely nothing new. When I heard the first single, it just hit me like a ton of bricks how lame and un-original it was. This is just a blatant rehash of their made-to-sell formula. And then I learn about these guys talking dirt about Deftones. How dare you? How dare you, a whiny TRL pop fixture, say things about the Deftones? The Deftones are an incredibly powerful and original band, who, as opposed to LP, does not repeat themselves. LP needs to thank their lucky stars that Evanescence came out and gave this genre a boost. They should worship at the altar of Evanescence, an enormously better band, because without them, this album would really hit the ground, and no one would even hear the thud. Get the bubblegum out of your ears, and you will see the light.
B00008PW3Q|1.0|This Fleetwood Mac album has absolutely no direction. These two have always had concepts and interesting melodies to provide some way of making the 2 chord music they write interesting and cohesive.  This album is neither.  I always knew Christine McVie was very important to this band, but it's obvious she was part of the magic that made them so interesting. Not that Christine wrote more than a few chords, but she knew how to balance the hyper and nasal sounds of LB and SN. She also knew how to compose around SN and LB making it a group effort, along with arranging great harmonies.  Her arrangements along w/ LB's producing were key. She brought harmony to this band and when she retired she took it with her. <br />There are a few good songs here, but that's not what a Fleetwood Mac album is to me.  Pull out Mirage, Rumours, Tango or the White album and listen to the flow of the 3 singers sequenced properly.  It's what made this band's albums so great. Even in the Bob Welch days.<br />Sure they can make a ton of money on the name, the album, the tour but can they still make good music?  Hats off to John McVie, his bass on this album was stellar.  <br />As for the singing, are they really singing or shouting?  What is that?  I'm really disappointed, I think I'll go pull out Wild Heart, Bella Donna, or Tango and remember the days of real albums whether it be solo or a group effort.
6303979882|5.0|The story it's mostly about the loyal friends and how hard is sometimes to go to the past and front old problems that you thought to left behind....but you didn't.<BR>The Movie starts with  message from Chrissy to Samantha saying that she's going to have a baby and reminding Sam that they promissed to be together no matter what.<BR>Sam goes to the Gaslight Addition, the town where she used to live.......with her friends<BR>She goes to Chrissy's house and she find there to Roberta(who's now a doctor and an outstanding basketball player), a few minutes later, Teeny arrives in her limo (because she's now an actress).<BR>After they talk a bit, Samantha starts to remember the summer of 1970, when they were all 12 years old, and all the things they did and sayed...she remembers things like Roberta'sjokes about the dead, about Chrissy's innocence fronting the sex, about Teeny's dreams about being a star(thing that she finally made real!)and her (Sam's) depression about her prarents divorce.<BR>It's a very cool movie for girls around 13 years old, and it made me cry!! :'( (of course, not in a bad sense, like why the hell i spend my money in this movie?)<br />I recommend this movie and the movie STRIKE! with Kirsten Dunst (Sapiderman, the Virgin Suicides), Gabby Hoffman (yes, she's also in this movie, but a little groun up) Monika Keena, Vincent Kartheiser (i love this boy, he also appears in Angel, as Angel's son Connor) and Danny Smith (he appeard in Big Wolf on Campus, as Merton)
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna's new album &quot;American Life&quot; showcases many different musical styles.  For the most part this album is not as &quot;pop&quot; oriented as her 80's work, however not as electronic as her previous album &quot;Music.&quot;  As a whole this album completely blows &quot;Music&quot; out of the water, and should be placed right up next to other great Madonna records such as &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light.&quot;  This album is extremely personal for Madonna and this is very obvious in the lyrics.  Although Madonna is speaking of very personal issues with this record, every track still remains very catchy and strong.  This record unlike other pop albums contains no &quot;filler&quot; songs.  Every track on this album is very consistent in it's quality.  Madonna's first single &quot;American Life&quot; is a very catchy song, yet one of the albums worst tracks.  The all out pop song &quot;Hollywood&quot; is very unique and combines lots of interesting sounds, along with great guitar sounds and an extremely catchy hook.  The third track &quot;I'm So Stupid&quot; is a very fresh sound for Madonna and the lyrics are great.  The stand-out track of the album is without a doubt &quot;Nothing Fails.&quot;  This is not only one of Madonna's greatest slow songs ever, but could also be hailed as one of her most amazing tracks ever.  The London Community Gospel Coir sings with Madonna at the end of this song, and it is so amazing you don't know how to react.  Other great tracks include the amazing acoustic song &quot;X-stactic Process,&quot; and the incredible closer &quot;Easy Ride.&quot;  &quot;Love Profusion&quot; is another song that will stick in your head for days at a time whether you like it or not.  All in all this album is right up there with other Madonna greats, and could one day be known as Madonna's best record.  BUY IT!
B000089RVX|5.0|I got chills when I first listened to this haunting CD!  Tracks 2, 4, and 9 especially!  This is the next big thing in music.  Enya meets Linkin park in a mind-blowing dark experience in sound.  I cannot get enough of this CD!  I hope they keep making music - I greedily anticipate their next album!
B00008PW3Q|5.0|On first listen I must admit I wasn't sure about some of the tracks on this CD, but after a few more listens I think it's an absolute masterpiece.<BR>Lindsey's more experimental songs (Murrow, Come) didn't throw me too much as I already own his \\"Out Of The Cradle\\" solo CD (another masterpiece...buy it now if you don't have it!!).<BR>It took me a couple of listens to get into some of Stevie's songs but they have grown on me...no one produces her like Lindsey and her songs are much better than on the solo \\"Trouble In Shrangli-la\\" CD which I found rather disappointing.<BR>I know I'll get shot down in flames for saying this by other fans, but I agree with other comments about Christine McVie not being missed...I also thought some of her songs were rather whimsical boring numbers.<BR>Buy this now if you like to hear an old band not just putting out radio friendly fodder like so much rubbish around now!!<BR>Lindsey, you are a guitar god!!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I feel this is Godsmack's greatest cd.  I couldn't imagine that the  band could improve from &quot;Awake&quot; but they have.  Sully has come in to his own vocally, and the guys have moved on with the departure of former drummer Tommy Stewart.
B000002LGQ|4.0|Released in 1989. Like A Prayer is not that much different from it´s predecessor True Blue ( which was a good album). She tries however to experiment with different musical styles such as R&B, Funk and Gospel however without using to much of it ( like her new albums). Her voice is good on this album and the tracks are well produced and written. She again works with Patric Leonard who in my opinion is Madonnas best songwriter. With Madonna they create 6 good songs and one bad  together. She also works with her friend Stephen Bray who also worked with her on True Blue. They wrote and produced together two songs on this album. She also sings duet with Prince, who is one of the greatest songwriter,performer in the world.<br />Like A Prayer the title track is a catcy song with a wonderful lyric. The melody is good and I love the arrangements. I also love the gospel choir on it as well as being well sung by Madonna. 9/10.<br />Express Yourself. A song about Woman´s inderpendent and her need to express and respect herself. The video with the song was avesome and the track co-written by Stepehn Bray is also great 9/10.<br />Love Song. A duet with Prince which he wrote and produced. One of the albums weaker tracks. A Bit slow but overall okay song. 6/10.<br />Till Death Do Us Part. Sort of 80´s pop track. To many the weakest song on the album however not that bad track. A song that could have been suited more for her previous release True Blue and does not exactly match the other tracks on the album however a good song. 7/10.<br />Promise To Try. The weakest song on the album. She should have skipped it. It was about a little girl who is dealing with her mother´s death and needs to chear up a little bit and be strong. A song that you have heard before with Madonna and is typical to hear again a bit whiny. 4/10.<br />Cherish. My favourite song on the album. This one most people have heard. A very uplifting song however not a lyrically great but musically good and the melody is also great. The song is catchy and I smile every time I hear it. 10/10.<br />Dear Jessie. A Kind of song that is suitable for babies not a <BR>good song but not great. I like the horn arrangements on it. 5/10.<br />Oh Father. I kind of dark song about Madonna relationship with her father and ex-husband Sean Penn. You can´t hurt me now I am not so sure is about her father because I don´t think he ever abused her physically. But the song is good. The beginning of the song is always in my mind afer I have heard it a great song 9/10.<br />Keep It Together. A great fun song. The single was very popular when it came out even though she never made a video with it. A good song about families. 8/10.<br />Pray For A Spanis Eyes. Some kind of latin wibe like La Isla Bonita on True Blue but more of a ballad. Musically great and lyrically good and the melody is also good however Madonnas voice was not very good and sounded like she had a soar throat. 8/10.<br />Act Of Contrition. I have no idea what this is doing on the album. A joke perhaps. 7/10.<br />overall a good album by Madonna and she should listen to it and should get  Patric Leonard work with her again because he is an avesome producer and a songwriter something that the people who work with Madonna now are not.
B00008BXJF|5.0|While just existing is already an astonishing feat in itself, the fact that King Crimson, the most interesting of all the original Prog. Rock innovators, is arguably at the top of their game in 2003 is mind blowing.  Few bands can reissue an expansive CD catalogue of 30th anniversary special editions and even fewer can then still claim to be writing original music, but the industrious King Crimson meets both these conditions, immediately certifying them as one of rock's most determined and persevering acts.  The group's new album, the anxiously anticipated \\"The Power to Believe,\\" acts as a companion CD to 2000's glorious landmark release, \\"The Construkction of Light.\\"  The Construkction of Light was a phenomenal display of Crimson's technological prowess, advanced instrumental abilities, and complete mastery of rock and free jazz alike, but while TCOL showed the more free jazz, unrestrained experimental side of the talented Crim, The Power to Believe is its much more straightforward rock counterpart.  Although a band as detail oriented and creative as King Crimson would never release a truly classifiable \\"rock record, \\"The Power to Believe is essentially a Crimson take on what the genre has to offer.  Packed with dense instrumentals and catchy vocal tracks alike, Crimson's new CD still keeps the group's spirit of experimentation alive, but the album's more rock driven agenda can still be easily identified.  Trading in Mastelloto's V-drums for an almost entirely acoustic set and opting for tight, spiraling riffs (Level 5, Dangerous Curves) instead of repeated, complex guitar runs (Frakctured), The Power to Believe strikes the listener in a very immediate way.  That is not to say that The Power to Believe is mundane hard rock however, far from it.  The band's superb instrumental talent as well as Belew's brilliant knack for lyrical wordplay keep the album as intelligently adventurous as it is powerful, even allowing for ambient transitions that provide a claming breakin the distorted onslaught.  Even more astonishing though, under the hard rock veneer lies the typical Crimson complexity; entirely intact and bubbling just below the surface to reward the focused listener.  In this way, the band remains as brilliantly original as ever through irregular solos and alternating guitar blasts, but the far more accessible rock packaging which contains the group's Avant Garde tendencies adds focus and drive to King Crimson's already formidable sound.  The Power to Believe is therefore at its heart another classic, otherworldly King Crimson album, as shocking and successful as releases from In The Court of the Crimson King up to The Construkction of Light, but in addition to flexing King Crimson's established fortes, The Power to Believe pushed their sound forward into the future, conquering the worlds of Prog., hard rock, alt., metal, jazz, and countless other styles in its wake.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Now I'm gonna do a track by track review this amazing album by Madonna.<br />1-American Life:This song is a great electronica song mixed with acoustic and hip-hop elements.She even raps in it.A great song. 5/5<BR>2-Holywood:This song is a very good one.It is more upbeat than American Life and it is a sweet guitar song. 5/5<BR>3-I'm so Stupid:This is a great rock-based song.It's again uptempo. 5/5<BR>4-Love Profusion:It starts as an acoustic song but after the beat kicks it gets better and better.This definately should be a single.It's one of the best song on the album. 5/5<BR>5-Nobody Knows Me:This song is CRAZY!!!It will keep the nightclubs alive.But it takes some listens to like this track.3/5 <BR>6-Nothing Fails:STOP IT RIGHT HERE!This song is one of the best songs in her career if not the best.5/5<BR>7-Intervention:Another great one.Almost as good as \\"Nothing Fails\\" 5/5<BR>8-X.Static Process:In this song you can only hear Madonna's vocals and a guitar.5/5<BR>9-Mother and Father:This is another  masterpiece from this album.5/5<BR>10-Die Another Day:It really fits the album but after these great songs it sounds a bit weak. 4/5<BR>11-Easy Ride:The strings are great and very dramatic.This song is better than Frozen.And a great way to end the album.This song is out-of-world. 5/5<br />STANDOUT TRACKS:<br />LOVE PROFUSION<BR>NOTHING FAILS<BR>INTERVENTION<BR>X-STATIC PROCESS<BR>MOTHER AND FATHER<BR>EASY RIDE<br />THIS ALBUM IS A MASTERPIECE AND MADONNA'S BEST ALBUM
B00008J2DQ|5.0|When I first bought Faceless, I was a bit wary. I was unsure of how well Godsmack could top their preceeding releases. I sat down in the quiet of my room to listen. I was blown away. The first swells of the music swept through me and carried me to places few musicians have been able to take me. Haunting lyrics, ripping guitar, thundering drums and Sully's amazingly penetrating voice all combine to make this something to be experienced, not just someting to listen to.
B00008S2VH|4.0|Unfortunately the critics are once again attacking Madonna's work.  And once again I disagree with them.  American Life is a great CD.  It proves once again was a talented entertainer Madonna is.  Instead of putting out tired manufactured pop songs written by others she has come out with an album of deeply personal material she wrote. This CD isn't quite to the level of Ray Of Light or Music but it is pretty close.
B00008S2VG|3.0|After listening to this CD multiple times, I still have not developed the addictive feeling that every other Madonna album has instilled in me. While I've had to buy repeat replacements for all her discs that I literally wore out, \\"American Life\\" sits alone and rejected.<br />Frankly, following her disastrous movie project \\"Swept Away\\", I had great hope that \\"American Life\\" would prove to be a remarkable recovery. Instead it has me worried about Madonna's future as a cultural icon.<br />First, there's the hideous cover art, with Mad looking like Patty Hearst in her Symbionese liberation outfit. Then there's the shelved, \\"what-was-she-thinking?\\" video for the title song, which it so direly needed to push it up the charts. But wait! There is the rest of the music itself. Oh, no, not AGAIN!<br />Mad has worked the edgy, once-exciting electronic, \\"I-am-now-a- guitar-player\\" genre to the bone...and beyond. No longer five steps ahead of everyone else in the music biz, her never-ending Mirwais obsession has become a droning bore. Every song sounds vaguely like the one before it, and the one before that, and the one before that...<br />The lyrics are standard grammar-school rhyming. Okay, maybe her lyrics were always simple, but here there's no help from the surrounding production, or her singing, which is now totally bereft of any phrasing. Her vocals are bogged down and interrupted with a trillion bleeps, cut-offs, re-verbs, overdubs, and alterations.<br />But what really gets me is the whole emotional timbre of this set of songs. It's downright morose. The poor girl doesn't seen happy or content with anything in her life. She should come to work with me for a couple of days, then she'd really have some down-beat ideas to peddle. Madonna, honey, we never listened to you because we wanted to feel depressed and conflicted.<br />I hope this current Madonna incarnation comes to a halt, pronto.  I loved all her other personas and music styles: fun-loving tramp, material girl, spiritual traveller, cowgirl. But this \\"queen-of-doom\\" personality ran out of steam before she could finish changing her hair color.<br />I would have given \\"A.L.\\" two stars, but there are some listenable tracks. Listenable, but not by any means the greatness we've come to expect. Sigh... What a letdown. I hope she gets some objective consultants to keep this from ever happening again. She can't afford another bomb like this., spiritual traveller, cowgirl. But this \\"queen-of-doom\\" personality ran out of steam before she could finish changing her hair color. <br />I would have given \\"A.L.\\" two stars, but there are some listenable tracks.

038572179X|5.0|The plots of some books are easily categorized.  Ones where the first paragraph lets you know what the arc of the book is going to be.  It sounds interesting.  You want to read it.  You were right in your prediction.  It gives you a comfortable feeling to have been right.  And you don't have to think.  This is not one of those books.  At least in its most fundamental sense it is not.<br />It seems to be at first.  In 1935, on a country estate, a young girl with a vivid imagination tries to explain something that she sees.  She does not understand what she has seen, but how many of us do at that age.  She thinks she has seen something she has not.  She is not puzzled, she is sure of what she has seen, and what it means, but she is wrong.  That evening other events lead to misleading, but convincing, statements to the police.  Then everyone must live with the consequences.  Five years later, that now young woman must come to grips with what she has set in motion, and its consequences.<br />Simple enough, and if that was all there was, it would be a good book.  That's not all there is.  The book goes further forward, to 1999.  Events have played out.  People have lived their lives.  We have to accept truth, and the truth is what makes what would be a good book a great book.<br />The difference, the ending, makes it a fantastic choice for those of us who hate to read a book only once!
0553381709|5.0|I can accept that some people will not like A Song Of Ice And Fire, after all this is a matter of personal taste, but what has confused me somewhat are reviews from those who profess to have loved the first two books in the series and yet find A Storm Of Swords a disapointment.  To my mind it faithfully follows the course set by Martin in A Game Of Thrones and I can detect no drop off in the quality of the series.  Some has critized the lack of resolution in the book to which I can only point to the fact that, while certain subplots are resolved, three more books have yet to come in which there will be plenty of space for resolution.  Others have marked the book down because of the affect certain scenes had on them, I would argue that it is a testament to the quality of the book that it can evoke such a powerful responce in the reader.<br />In the end I can only offer my opinion for what it's worth that this is one of the most remarkable series around at the moment.  If your tired of the usual conventions of the genre it's a breath of fresh air and I cannnot recomend it highly enough
B00003CXXM|2.0|I went to the movies think, &quot;wow, this'll be great!&quot;  I loved the book, and from it seemed from the comercial that it would be about the same.  Well it wasn't.  It was completely different. When I left the movie theater, I wanted to cry in a corner in fetal position with my copy of The Bourne Identity cradled in my arms.  If you want to see an accurate portrayl of the book, rent the mini-series.<br />But if you haven't read the book, I guess this movie's half-way decent.
B00008S2VG|1.0|First off, I just want to say that I have been an avid Madonna fan since her inception.  I have all of the albums as I was swept away approx. 22 years ago when I first heard \\"Lucky Star\\" & \\"Borderline\\".  That being said, this is by far the worst effort at an album that she has made.  Out of 11 track listings, there are only 4 songs that remotely stand out amongst the rest.  Out of these 4, there are only 2 that I would venture to call great.  \\"American Life\\" & \\"Intervention\\" are the 2 that are fairly good & \\"Die Another Day\\" & \\"Easy Ride\\" are the 2 great ones.  But if you are an avid Madonna fan as I am, you have probably already purchased the Maxi-single to \\"Die Another Day\\", which leaves \\"Easy Ride\\" as the only exceptional song on the album.  The rest of the songs are either extremely repetitive & monotonous lyrically or the music just isn't that great.  I love the electronica/techno vibe that she was going for, but it flowed much better on \\"Ray of Light\\", which is by far her best album to date.  If you take a listen to \\"Hollywood\\" & \\"I'm So Stupid\\" you will not have to wonder as to where the song titles came from because the words are repeated over & over again.  There are no lyrics printed in the album.  I understand why now.  It would only take up one page in the fold-out cover, one line of lyric x20...ok, next song.  Usually her lyrics at least sound poetic, if not thought provoking on previous albums.  She is not a virgin to repetitive lyric stylings as former recordings will prove, but earlier song releases that used repetition at least had good verses or a strong musical beat.  These songs have neither.  She might have had a point with the title \\"I'm so Stupid\\" at least as far as recording this album was concerned & as the multiple repeated line in \\"Mother and Father\\" suggests...\\"I need to give it up!\\"  Music is supposed to either maintain the ethic of previous albums or progress further, not regress 22 years as this album appears to do.
B000063USY|5.0|I enjoyed the fast pace of this movie. If you want action, it's here in this film. A must see for any Vin Diesel fan.

0812550757|5.0|When I first picked up &quot;Speaker For The Dead&quot; I was a little confused at the fact that it does not start off at all where &quot;Enders Game&quot; left off..  The first 3 chapters deal with a completely new set of charaters and at first I was kinda mad at this, but the characters quickly grew on me. Once I got to the 4th chapter I am introduced to Ender, but this time he is an old man.  I wont give anything away here and thats all I will tell you about the plot of the story.<br />  This book is far more complex then Enders Game was and there are all sorts of issues are mentioned... Without giving out the plot Speaker For The Dead is a book about morals vs. greed. There are a few scientists in this book which are main charaters..  This story goes far more in depth about the Buggers and the whole Ender univerese. Ender and a few other charaters are in this story, but they have aged and are not kids at all. This story has a more adult tone to it.<br />  I was suprised and amazed at the many twists Card through at the reader during the story and how they fit together.. Nothing seemed like it was just added to the book to fill space or because the author had this idea in his head.. It all fits and anything which seems unclear by the end (not much) is addressed in the next book.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack did it again. They already have two top selling albums, and they topped it off again with Faceless. If you like raw, in your face music, you will love Faceless. Every song is amazing. Sully Erna could not have used better lyrics to complete this album. If you have not heard Faceless yet, you must get it. You will not be disappointed in any way. It will leave you craving for more.
0812550706|5.0|What can be said that hasnt already?  amazing book.  My review is here just to show I have read the book and reccomend it, but I reallly am just gonna blabber here.. This is not a well written review, it's just talk.<br />  This book is not only my favorite book, but it actually got me reading!  I had not read any books on my own (not in school or because of school) since I was in 7th grade. I am a junior in high school now and I picked up this around novemeber 2002 and ever since I have been reading..  I cant believe I missed out for so long.<br />  I have read the next two books in the series (Speaker For The Dead, Xenocide) and I liked both...  However Enders Game is the first book and even though I tend to think of &quot;SPeaker For THe Dead&quot; as an equal it would not be a good book if you did not read &quot;Enders Game&quot;, even though it is a totally different story.  Xenocide was a good book, but nothing more.. I didnt like the ending and the whole book was tiresome to read...
B00008DDSA|2.0|Not much of a black comedy at all. With all the fuss &amp; press I expected more than a little spanking with clothes on &amp; simulated body cutting. James Spader was flat &amp; not really focused. The only thing that saves this movie was a wonderful performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal, given the fairly weak material.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack's newest album &quot;Straight out of line&quot;, continues the straight forward Rock attitude.  This being the third album released, it shows that the guys are not going away with what made them what they are today.  From the opening track, all the way through, they rock you on every song, you cannot help from liking it.
B000002KIE|4.0|Ok, Pistols are not The Clash. This disc is not very tidy... but that's punk. And God save the Queen is magic...

B00008S2VG|5.0|For 20 years, the sounds and images of modern pop's most resilient icon has kept audiences mesmerized.  Acclaimed and derided for her keen marketing sense, Madonna's music always seemed to take the backseat to her public image.  Whatever your thoughts may be on Ms. Ciccone, she is a part of popular history for a reason.  She's a damn exciting artist and performer.  With \\"American Life,\\" her new age of maturity and introspection reveals the true depths of her ability as a musician -- at long last.<br />While \\"Ray of Light\\" has been hailed as her artistic high point, \\"American Life\\" scales a taller peak.  Musically, this is not for the bump and grind of the dance floor, long her strongest suit.  This time, Madonna has offered personal attacks, views, revelations and other inner monologues -- all produced in a fractured soundscape that is a complex as the album's themes.  With the jarring debut single and her scathing attack on \\"Hollywood,\\" the Material Girl questions her own decisions for the first time.  The beauty of music like \\"Love Profusion\\" and \\"Easy Ride\\" are both revealing and shocking since it came from the same mind that was the source of songs like \\"Vogue\\" and \\"Lucky Star.\\"<br />Looking back at the two decades she has cornered the air waves, it is remarkable to chart her evolution.  Most of top 40's reigning and now deposed royalty of pop are nowhere to be seen.  Today's current idols don't even write their own music, much less strum a guitar.  Madonna has accomplished a rare feat, remaning a vibrant part of the art form by leading, not following its fickle trends.<br />Since cynicism seems to be a professional sport of late, it is not fair to count her out.  That is why art remains the ultimate in subjective thought.  Give it a chance. \\"American Life\\" is not going to set your toes tapping on the onset.  You may even find yourself grumbling about purchasing it in the first place. But this is some special music and it deserves repeated listenings.  I know I grew up with Madonna and it is thrilling to have her provide a different kind of soundtrack to this adult's life. A recommendation to all without reservations.I grew up with Madonna and it is thrilling to have her provide a different kind of soundtrack to this adult's life.

B000002H33|5.0|This is the best thrash album that I have ever heard. This is one of the best Metallica albums that they ever came out with.(between Master of Puppets or And Justice for all). This album came out mouths before Cliff's death(basses) so this was the last album that he did with the band. The tracks listings on the record are Battery,Master of Puppets(those two are my favorite songs from the album),Thing that should not be(an awsome heavy metal song),Welcome Home(very good ballad form the record),Disposable Heroes(great song to get your head going to the music),Lepper Messiah(another one of my favorites),Orion(the best instrumental that Metallica ever made)and Damage(not my favorite but a good song the least to say).That is it, if you want Metallica at its best go out and buy this album or go out and buy And Justice For All. This is a must have for any Metallica fan anywhere
B00005JM2I|4.0|\\"The Fountainhead\\" as a film is true entertainment bliss. Stilted, talky, cerebral, over-the-top dialogue, wonderful conceptual imagery in Rand's contempt for the masses, beautifully shot and directed and an utter joy to watch the actors ramble about. I just love it.
B00005JLEU|3.0|I was expecting more from this film considering it is the most successful film in Japan's history ever.  It is long and slow in parts (many parts).  The animation is great with many magical moments, but don't expect cool Matrixesque parts.  I was hoping that characters would have more special powers etc.  Overall the movie is great but don't believe the hype, watch for yourself.  As far as people claiming that Disney has changed the film, this is totally untrue.  Obliviously the translation from Japanese to English is not exact, but even with this great pains were taken to be as close as possible.  Scene to scene, everything is the same.  I definintely recommend watching this film possibly with some uhh emm mood enhancement.  You know what I mean.
B000059XVS|4.0|It is an epic, of course, but this pushes the limits, as the content within that four hours is sparse. The score is often intrusive. Alec Guiness's Prince Faisal is distracting, as he is obviously not an Arab. Not a word of Arabic is even spoken in the dialogue or subtitled. Peter O'Toole's over-the-top portrayal of Lawrence is a pleasure to watch, but Omar Sharif's charcter is far more affecting. And Anthony Quinn is fantastic.<br />Also, the ending shows the Arabs leaving Damascus after two days! This is a false account of history and in the film, even without an understanding of what really happened, the quick departure of the Arabs seems strange.<br />In any event, it's certainly a good film, but maybe a bit too impressed with itself.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I bought this CD just on the strength of &quot;Do You Realize&quot;, but it has so much more than that. The thing that impresses me the most is how the songs just flow together. The way &quot;In the Morning of the Magicians&quot; emerges from the chaos of &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Part 2&quot; is amazing. It's a gorgeous, lush disc, but it also has some very funny moments. You've got to love a band that has a lyric like &quot;she's gotta be strong to fight 'em, so she's takin lots of vitamins.&quot; That's from the title track, which has proved to be a big favorite with my kids (ages 4 and 7 -- they especially like Part 2 of the robot battle!). Put this one on, kick back, and let it play.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Speaking as a huge Madonna fan, I have followed her for my whole life as she's grown as an artist and this is her best work to date. She's very honest and has revealed her feelings more than she's ever before like in the songs &quot;Love Profusion&quot; and &quot;Mother and Father.&quot; The songs are an acoustic/techno mix that works well with her voice and nice to listen to when you want to mellow out. This is an album that's definitely worth purchasing.
6301773551|5.0|There's nothing for me here! I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi, like my father!\\" Perhaps the best line ever uttered in a sci-fi movie. What can I say? This is one of the top five best movies ever produced, and the second best in the sci-fi genre, nipping at the heels of its paterfamilias, \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", without which it would have probably looked quite different than it did.<br /><br />How Lucas came from \\"American Graffiti\\" to this monster is a mystery. Though his love for sci-fi was quite evident in his first movie, \\"THX-1138\\", where did he get 1) The filmmaking acumen, 2) the money, 3) the technically adept people to pull \\"New Hope\\" off? This alone had to be a feat unequalled since Kubrick got together with Arthur C. Clarke and Douglas Trumbull to make \\"2001\\".<br /><br />\\"New Hope\\" had that magic touch that had you rooting for the heroes at every turn, predisposing you to this by painting the Empire as the very embodiment of evil....destroying Luke's home and BURNING Beru and Owen, blowing up Leia's homeworld and killing Obi Wan. By doing this, you cannot HELP but cheer as Luke and his rebel friends destroy Death Star in the climactic scene. You also can't help but chuckle at characters like Princess Leia, Han Solo and R2D2. Personally, I could have lived without C3PO in ALL the SW movies!, but he's present here too as the prissy opposite number to the much more useful R2.<br /><br />Watch all three first trilogy movies...and you'll notice a DISTINCT change in the actors playing Luke and Leia. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher just BARELY resemble their \\"New Hope\\" selves in the succeeding movies! Mark Hamill's entire face seems to change from one with an aqualine nose and sun bleached blond hair to one with a pug nose, a much meaner mien to the entire face, and sandy BROWN hair. Carries Fisher's whole face goes from being round and pudgy to being elongated and gaunt, though she still pretty much resembles the \\"New Hope\\" Leia. Her voice, however, changes completely, going from tomboyish but still feminine in \\"New Hope\\", to being raspy and whiskey-soaked by \\"Jedi\\".<br /><br />All in all, this is the one that sets the pace for the others, and is STILL the best one as far as pathos and pure edge-of-your-seat drama: The destruction of Luke's farm and the murder of his guardian Aunt and Uncle; the destruction of Alderaan by Grand Muff Tarkin; the trash-compactor scene; the rebel pilots being picked off one by one by the Empire fighters during the Death Star run by Luke's friends. The last minute save by Han Solo...this film couldn't have been a more perfect matinee entertainment if it tried!<br /><br />Special mention has to be made of Sir Alec Guiness and Peter Cushing, especially Cushing, who gave perhaps his best film performance ever in this film as the supremely evil Tarkin. The sad thing connected with this film is the lackluster career Mark Hamill has had since \\"Jedi\\". Though he was, hands-down, the star of what was for quite some time the most popular film ever, he couldn't give himself away by the mid-eighties.<br /><br />The fickle fortunes of Hollywood, I ask you.....letely, going from tomboyish but still feminine in \\"New Hope\\", to being raspy and whiskey-soaked by \\"Jedi\\".

0679409920|4.0|Like John Fowles, Greene writes extremely readable and compelling yet deep novels.  I'm impressed by his ear for conversation in The Human Factor and his comic observation of the way the profound and the banal mix themselves up in our lives.   It's good that someone wrote great literature in a popular genre... these things shouldn't all be left to the Sidney Sheldons in our midst.
0805047905|5.0|If there is any childrens book I never get tired of, it's Brown Bear.  My almost 7 year old loved this as a toddler and now reads it to her two year old twin brother and sister - and THEY love it.  Its repetition is comforting and familiar, yet never boring.  The photos helped her to learn to 'read' it by doing a picture walk long before she could really read other books.  The words are so simple she memorized it.  And she was so proud of her reading that it inspired her to continue to 'read' this way with other familiar books.  VERY highly recommended....even I am not tired of this book.  One of the best, IMHO.
0385507755|5.0|It's unfortunate that James Frey's debut novel received so much press so long before his book actually hit the shelves. Many people seem to be judging his work-or more accurately, him-based on a few interviews they've read. Why not read the book and decide for yourself? I promise you, it will be well worth your time, which is more than I can say about some of the articles written about him.

B00002E23E|2.0|I must have seen this movie 20 times at the local theatre. Friday and Saturday nights at midnight they'd play Rock n Roll movies. I have never been able to stay awake through the whole movie. I thought at the time it was because we were staying up past midnight to watch it and we were just to tired to make it to the end. So when I picked up the DVD and brought it home after not seeing it for so many years I thought &quot;I'm finally gonna be able to see this movie from start to finish&quot;. I still fell asleep. This movie has not aged well. I LOVE ZEP. But this movie reminds me too much of Spinal Tap. The dream sequences.........Why are the there? The band looks very bored. They also seem to take this whole 'rock star' persona way to seriously. Spinal Tap was a spoof. This was not and looks like one. Long live Zep...........but you don't need this DVD in your collection.
B00008PW3O|4.0|I began listening to Fleetwood Mac in an order reversed compared to most.  I got hooked on Stevie Nicks back when she released 'Trouble in Shangri-La' in 2001.  Since then I've been a huge Nicks fan and in an effort to find more of her music I discovered Fleetwood Mac.  I've been a fan ever since I first heard 'The Dance'.  That being said, realize this reveiw is coming from the perspective of someone who is a Nicks fan first and a Fleetwood Mac fan second.<br />The first reason I love this album is because Nicks has some great songs on here.  Everybody Finds Out is a great rock song and gets me psyched up no matter how many times I've heard it before.  Say You Will is a nice pop song, but I actually think it would have been better sung by Christine McVie.  Nicks does a nice job filling in for her though.  Illume is a prime example of just how wonderfully cryptic and beautiful Nicks' poetic songs can be.  Finally, Running Through the Garden harkens back to some of Nicks' solo work from the 80's, especially from 'The Wild Heart'.  <br />Lindsey Buckingham has some good moments on this album as well, but some of his songs seem to be out of place here.  'Red Rover' and 'Murrow Turning Over In His Grave' are good examples of songs that would have been better on a Buckingham solo project.  However, since 'Say You Will' came out of such a project, that doesn't come as a surprise.  'Peacekeeper', however, is a great example that Fleetwood Mac hasn't lost its distinctive sound.<br />Probably the best part about this album though are the pair of songs at the end.  'Say Goodbye' (sung by Buckingham) and 'Goodbye Baby' (sung by Nicks) are essentially Nicks and Buckingham putting closure on their volatile relationship that spawned some of Fleetwood Mac's most famous songs.  Its a very nice way to end the album and it ends on a most satisfying note.<br />Only big Fleetwood Mac fans should by the 'Enhanced' album.  It contains some nice picture extras, and the extra songs are decent.  But casual fans may not appreciate these extras to justify the extra cost.  The serious fan will very much enjoy the Enhanced version though.
630463949X|4.0|I am a huge FM fan.  I was sceptical about buying this because the band hadn't been together for awhile, and well, they were older.  I wondered if the magic had been lost.  All I can say is that I was a fool to think that!  I could have been enjoying this concert DVD ages ago.  <br />I bought the DVD this week after reading such positive reviews on Amazon.  Stevie Nick's voice is still in top form, despite what others have said about her voice during this concert.  She also seemed to really enjoy being back on stage with the band.  It's common knowledge that Christine McVie didn't want to be part of this concert, and it shows. This is my only complaint with the concert - she rarely smiles and looks out of place - she has the look of \\"is it time to go yet?\\"  She puts only an average effort into the songs she sings at this concert.  Anyway, aside from that, you get FM showcasing some of their best stuff including brilliant renditions of \\"Tusk\\" and \\"Landslide\\".  <br />I can't recommend this music DVD enough, it's brilliant.  It might not have DTS, but that isn't a problem - the 5.1 is absolutely fine.  This is a music DVD that belongs in every FM fan's collection.  Buy it and treasure it.
0553213105|5.0|Being a 20 something male, I was not sure what to think when I picked up this novel.  I knew that girls had always loved this book, so I set myself up for a girlie novel.  Elizabeth, the protaganist, is anything but a simple girlie character though.  This book attacks the social structure of Austen's days.  The characters are deep and well written.  Some are characatures for comic relief, but you still come away with the feeling that you have known someone like that in the past.  This book is a classic for a reason.  I recommend this book to anyone, not just love sick teenage girls.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Let's face it , Madonna has made some excellent music in the past. I was a huge fan of both Ray Of Light and Music when they were  released. It was some of the best music that she had ever done . When \\"Die Another Day\\" was released last year , I damaged my subwoofer playing it loudly and often.<br /> I had a bad feeling about this album when Madonna pulled the \\"American Life\\" video for negative imagery involving President Bush and then blathered on about file sharing. I think she pulled the video because of the stupid rapping she does in the song. It's almost embarassing. Although the music is very good , Madonna's performance is not . The lyrics are moody and almost angery . It's not the fun and dance driven lyrics of the other albums. I'm thinking these songs are the dark products that the failure of her film \\"Swept Away\\" caused . Preview this album before you buy , I think most will hear the difference.
B00005JLSE|5.0|From beginning to end, I adored this movie. By the way, before I start my review, everyone who hasn't seen this movie, don't believe anyone who says that this movie stunk. It HAS a plot, and a very good one to add to that. Suprisingly, I liked the music so much I bought the soundtrack! When I heard this movie was nominated for so many Oscars, I went out to see it, and I found out why. It definitely deserves its Best Picture Oscar, and all the other ones it got! This DVD is gonna be great! Catherine Zeta-Jones did a magnificent job as Velma Kelly, as well as Renee Zellwegger as Roxie Hart. And Richard Gere did a great job as Billy Flynn. I haven't seen the play \\"Chicago\\", but I'm sure I will.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I have seen the entire series in DVD, but in Argentina (where I live) the series is 10 episodes in 5 discs, instead of 10 espisodes in 6 discs.<br />I tell you, this is the best film I have ever seen. <br />When Episode 1, &quot;Courahee&quot;, started, I could not believe what I was watching, but as the time went by, disc by disc, I became more familiar with the Band of Brothers universe.<BR>I may also tell you that the Spanish title is &quot;Hermandad en la trinchera&quot;.<br />Acting: 5 stars<BR>Music: 5 stars<br />Direction: 5 stars<BR>Overall: 5 stars<br />So, with the rank above, you see that there was no part I did not like.

B00008S2VG|2.0|Okay, So Madonna is a star. She's sick and tired of being a star. All you need is love. Playing guitars automatically makes what you're saying really really important. On her latest super-hyped project 'American Life', Madonna desperately tries to keep her position as controversial quick-change artist, with plenty left to say on sex, politics, family, and (oh god!)the price of fame. What results is the same sob-story she gave us on 2000's 'Music' and 1998's 'Ray Of Light', only this time the experimentation with electronica and intense introspection has become just more digital whining and kumbaya sing along babble. While 'Music' was half of what 'Ray' was, it still managed to be engaging enough to be left knowing Madonna was still at the top of her game. This, her tenth album, is her weakest because there are no new tricks and the subject matter has all been covered before. The family and religious themes of \\"Mother and Father\\" and \\"Nothing Fails\\" recall 'Like A Prayer', which remains her best album to date. The choir in \\"Nothing Fails\\" makes you really miss that period. That's the problem with 'Life'.There are fragments sprinkled throughout that remind you of her past catalog and then something obnoxious happens again-another tune where either Madonna's guitar gently weeps and she talks out of her spiritual behind or a pretty good dance tune (\\"Nobody Knows Me\\", \\"Hollywood\\")is partnered with lyrics my two year old niece could write (\\"Im stupider than stupid\\"). What is really wrong with the whole thing is the concept of soul searching-something we're already well aware and tired of. The title track, maybe the strongest now that we've heard the rest of the album, tries to deliver social commentary with that same ego-bad, Kabaalah-good sermon. We get treated to Madonna's horrible habit of simple pop rhymes-bar,star,far, dream,seem (later fly, sky, cry are used to death). This is forgivable for the first five or so songs of your career...but we know Madonna is capableof making stronger songs. \\"American Life\\" would be a better Madonna song without the cringe-inducing embarrassment of that rap, where she lists those shallow things she hates so much (but it would be more believable if her whole career had never been based on self-love, brattiness, carelessness, and the ability to morph into a new piece of eye candy during her latest project) What should sound like a mature woman making relevant, envelope-pushing music sounds like a woman that couldn't even reach the level of \\"Like A Virgin\\". Madonna has sucked the life out of her art, under the illusion that her enlightenment, her motherhood, and her love of cyber-chucky space beats is still enough to stay in the groove. I think many buyers of her latest scheme may disagree with her. All this time, we've followed her simply because of the excitement that has always surrounded a hot off the press Madonna album. But for the first time, Madonna has not evolved any more since the last time. Her shock-appeal is already showing age-would the same Madonna 13 years ago not release a video because it might offend someone? No. But that is where we are at right now. I won't go as far as to say Madonna has totally lost it, but she has definitely lost focus of what has worked for her for 20 years: never doing the same thing twice. My advice to Madonna: get new producers, ditch techno, and remember this: songs don't have to rhyme! In other words, get back into the groove or get out.<br />Standouts: American Life (minus the rap), \\"Hollywood\\", \\"Nobody Knows Me\\"(the beats), \\"Nothing Fails\\"(Minus some lyrics), Mother and Father\\" (Minus some dopey lyrics),\\"Die Another Day\\"-the only flawless song.

B000056N8X|5.0|This is in my opinion the first true highlander sequel out there.  We have a combination of the movie and the TV series and overall have a very entertaining movie.<br />The story is that Conner McCLoud (Lambert) decides to go into the immortal sanctuary after an immortal he once knew kills his adoptive daughter in a terrorist attack.  Along with many other immortals it guarentees that the prize will never be claimed.  However when an immortal goes Renegade and slays all of those in the sanctuary (except for Lambert) it is up to Conner and Duncan (Adrein Paul) to stop this mad man.<br />What makes this movie (as well as the TV series and other filsm) entertaining is that it not only packs sword and sorcery action, with a little bit of comedy (transfered from the series), add a little romaticism, with very good orchestrated music and you have one excelent movie.<br />The problem many will have is that it is a little cheesey.  Because this is an adaptation from the TV series it also takes on some of the elements from that.  However that is not a bad thing as this movie is very well made.  Overall if you are a highlander fan, get this, if not still check it out.  You never know you may enjoy it.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Two words:  Madonna does it again!!  Okay, so that's more than two words.  Well, how about:  ANOTHER MASTERPIECE!  This is an excellent album.  Better than Music.  I would almost say it's as good as Ray of Light.  Seriously.  Way to go, chica!
B00007L7FN|4.0|Tangerine Dream was going through a slow period of transition from 1970's &quot;Alpha Centauri&quot; to 1974's &quot;Phaedra&quot;. This album represents a step in that transition where the band finally begins to embrace electronic instruments as their primary tools, while still holding on to some of their &quot;Alpha Centauri&quot;-type experimental approach. This is the last TD album released before they went to England to record with Virgin, and also the last studio album to feature drums until 1979's &quot;Cyclone&quot;.<br />Personally, I find this album somewhere between the industrial freakouts of &quot;Electronic Meditation&quot; and the icy moonscapes of &quot;Zeit&quot;. There are some wild and crazy moments, but the disc is dominated by a sense of space, and empty quietness. Quite a lot of the album sounds like Zeit outtakes or backing tracks waiting for a solo, but they provide a nice contrast to the louder, more upfront moments.<br />This is the first TD album to feature the Mellotron, which would become a staple of the Tangerine Sound in the following decade. The album is drenched in Mellotron, but the instrument is most prominent in the first two tracks, the sidelong epic &quot;Atem&quot; and the shorter, mysterious &quot;Fauni-Gena&quot;. &quot;Fauni-Gena&quot; also contains some kind of backing track made up of jungle bird noises.<br />Overall, I would say that if you like &quot;Alpha Centauri&quot;s first side, you'll like this record. Bear in mind that the primitive recording environment is made evident in the amount of tape hiss throughout the album, but that's easy to ignore.
0385504209|3.0|I found \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" to be an entertaining thriller based on the theories presented in \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\" by Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln.<br />Brown's comments about the Louvre and Leonardo were the most interesting parts of the book for me. Having a man who studies symbols as his hero can lead to some intriguing puzzles to solve, as in \\"The DaVinci Code.\\"<br />Brown's treatment of the Catholic Church, however, is shallow and predictable. It is as if Catholics are the only Christians. (They are not even the most anti-female Christians). And although the secret society presented in the book is known to have been a hoax, as a previous reviewer stated, it makes for a nice plot device. But Brown claims that its existence is a fact.<br />There also are times when the characters do some remarkably stupid things, just to move the plot along. For that reason, I have given the book three stars.<br />If you enjoy art, ancient religions, and code breaking, this book is for you. Just don't expect great literature.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I had anticipated this CD for months...and good things definately come to those who wait. I love spending money on a CD, that I can stick in the deck, and walk away without skipping through the majority of them. This album is awesome in the sound of Lead Singer Sully Erna, the lyrics are very worthy of his awesome strong voice. I really do like every song on the album!! There are 12 songs and # 11 is instrumental. Buy this CD, and you will definately see why this band is soooo great!! While your at it pick up there 1st self titled album GODSMACK, and their 2nd AWAKE!! All 3 CD's will more than likely end up in your CD Player more times then NOT!!

Didn't cha?\\"<br />8.\\"X-Static Process\\"<BR>Almost like a wierd version of \\"Nobody Knows Me\\".<BR>She begs Jesus for help because she's not herself the majority of the time Excellent song.

0151008116|5.0|What can you say about a book that won what's probably the most prestigious literary prize in the world (England's Booker Prize)?  Well for starters, Life of Pi doesn't read like a prize-winning novel.  It's a funny, page-turning romp that moves from the former capital of French India to modern-day Canada by way of a 26-foot lifeboat.  Marooned on the lifeboat is Pi Patel, a precocious 16 year old.  The novel begins with the story of Pi's childhood, which has no shortage of wonder.  Pi's days are spent between school, life at his family's business (the only zoo in former French India) and religious devotion (to Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam).  But the novel really takes off when the ship ferrying Pi and his family to Canada goes down, and Pi is (literally) tossed into a lifeboat that's home to a wounded zebra, a hungry hyena, a prized orang-utan, and a 450-pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.  The boat's population undergoes a swift decline, and soon only Pi and Richard Parker remain, stranded, with no hope of rescue.  <br />For most writers, simply coming up with such a wild premise would drain their imagination dry.  But not Martell.  Every page of Life of Pi is crammed with charm, elegance, wit and wisdom.  He never lets his reader down, even when he twists the story around in the final five chapters.<br />The book is just magnificent.  Stylistically, Martell is a born storyteller.  He combines a never-failing array of similes with strong, clean sentences, and an easy charm.  Intellectually, he enlivens the narrative with ideas and themes that kept me up at night days after I put the book down.  <br />I can't sing the praises of this book high enough.  Just heavenly.
B000088E6D|5.0|Buble's record is an outstanding tribute to a style and time of music that Manlow and others have tried to duplicate.  He makes the grade!  It is wonderful to hear a young singer doing some old (really old) standards of my time.  We wanted to dance, immeidately!  I hope he works his way through the entire &quot;genre.&quot;  If you like &quot;Big Band&quot; and clean, solid, solo vocals you have to sample Buble!
B00005OAIE|4.0|By which I mean \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland.\\"<br />The more I listen to this CD, the more I think that that song was written to be \\"the single.\\"  It doesn't fit with the rest of the CD (except for possibly \\"City Love,\\" the only song I like less on this album).<br />The first song, \\"No Such Thing,\\" is a little clichéd--it's the \\"high school [is horrible] for deep people\\" song that works so well in alternative culture.  But it's still a really nice application of the theme, especially musically.  You can't help but rock out against the popular people.<br />\\"Why Georgia\\" is wonderful.  Again, the subject is a little bit old hat, but the application works really well.<br />\\"My Stupid Mouth\\" is quite possibly my favorite song on the album.  Ever said something you immediately realized you shouldn't have said?  \\"So call me Captain Backfire.\\"<br />\\"Your Body...\\" is really over the top.  Any song involving the phrase \\"bubble gum tongue\\" is over the top.<br />\\"Neon\\" is also great--again, a unique theme.<br />\\"City Love\\" is a little too schmaltzy for my taste.  If you really LOVE love songs, though, run with it.<br />\\"83\\" is about how great childhood is.  A great song.<br />\\"Great Indoors\\" is about experiencing the world through a medium other than television.  Guess why it wasn't the single with the video...?  Heh.  A great song.<br />\\"Love Song For No One\\" -- again, I suppose it's a tad overdone, but it has a really personal feel to it that lets you get past the cliché.<br />\\"Back To You\\" -- returning to a relationship is weird territory.  This marks it well.<br />\\"Not Myself\\" is nice, but a little low-energy.<br />\\"St. Patrick's Day\\" is about looking for security in relationships.  It's a great song to end the album with because you don't want it to end.<br />All in all, while this will never be my favorite album, it's a great CD with several super songs.  Take a listen.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I've readed the 4 books, and I have to say I'm delighted.<br />   My personal opinion is that Daniel (Harry), in the first movie, have trouble with the expression of his face; don't get me wrong, he is good, but he can do better; he in the first movie, blinks only one eye, all the time, wich is anoying; My personal favorite actor is Rupert (Ron). He is all that Daniel (Harry) isn't; he moves his mouth in one side and put his eyebrows up, and you know that he is upset, scared, etc.<br />    And Emma (Hermaione) learned to express her feelings just by her eyes, she was superb in her rol. Now then, regretting very much that Richard Harris (Dumbledore) has departed this world, he leave a very hard rol to fill, in wich he plays superbly. <br />     All and all, this movie is worth your money, although the casing shoud be much better than the flimsy carton in wich came packed. I highly recommed this movie.
B00000DGUG|1.0|I bought this CD back when &quot;thank u&quot; was released....thank u still is a great track...the rest of the album is horrible.

B00008S2VG|5.0|American Life<br />Yet another new direction for Madonna, not just MUSIC II even though Mirwais produces this one as well.  Real light airy, sometimes almost under-baked production, with the electronics taking a backseat to the acoustic guitar. Deeply mined lyrics makes the album stand out.  'Like a Prayer II' would better describe.  There is movement, a journey here. Girl's got alot on her mind. Give it a couple spins and let the words spill in.<br />(American Life) Great opening track -chunky, funky, and she's right--nothing is what it seems, [though admitly it's the best thing she's seen]. The remixes deal better with the drop-out chorus \\"American Life, I live the...\\".  Album mix is a little irritating in that the song loses it's momentum each time chorus rolls around.  But here I can at least understand the rap better (very funny when you get it). If you listen to it on stereo headphones, watch for the freaky outro vocals.  I thought she was telling me to kill my cat at first, but in reality it's a distorted vocal of (what else) \\"oh. American Life\\".  PS-love the Patty Hearst/Che Guevara thing.<br />(Hollywood) continues with the opening theme of having it all yet having nothing of true value, futility at the alter of false gods, etc...\\"push the button, change the channel\\" done with another vocal distortion, kinda like Bowies FAME in a weird way.<br />(I'm So Stupid) \\"Living in a fuzzy dream\\" is rather stupid, isn't it?  I feel stupid too, sometimes. Maybe I'll turn the TV off now. If this kind of modern life is not for free, then what AM I paying? Trippy opening vocal bit worth the price of admission.<br />(Love Profusion) There is one solution--\\"Open Your Heart\\"<br />(Nobody Knows Me) \\"No one tells you how to live your life but its just a setup until your fed up\\" The album progresses with this track, and seems to point to killing your television (media? entertainment?) to cut the ... social disease out of your life.  \\"People trap(ping) your mind\\". Rather subversive message. Viva la Revolucian!<br />(Nothing Fails) \\"I'm Not Religious\\".  Hmmmmm. I don't believe her. Maybe she means she isn't into belief systems.  Cause, I mean, she's just .... religious. Duh.<br />OK use of choir--much much subltler than \\"Like A Prayer\\".<br />(Intervention) Second love song in a row. Great realization of folk/electro sound. Pretty chorus. Should be a single. Maybe 'All You Need Is Love' is the answer to our American Lives?<br />(X-Stactic Process) Letter to Jesus on personal ... Roman-Catholic-Jesus-love stuff here. Campfire song about toxicity. Can't really relate, but from what I hear, a few of you perhaps will.  Sound is Veronica Electronica meets Joni Mitchell up in Laurel Canyon for tea. Beautiful.<br />(Mother and Father) \\"There was a time I prayed to Jesus Christ, There was a a time I had a mother it was nice\\"  We're deep in the doodoo of emotional pain as she turns her back on it. A gentle John Lennon's 'Mother' with a rap in place of the primal scream. 'Momma Don't Go, Daddy come home.'<br />(Die Another Day) Best thing she's done since Ray of Light. And as an added bonus, her most sly and subtle lyrics.  Every morning I wake up and die another day, and it makes me happy.<br />(Easy Ride) I guess no one would let Madonna get away with titling the song 'What I Want' but it is exactly that-a nice closeout song with wishes. I guess you still want even though you have everything?  Beautiful.bversive message. Viva la Revolucian!<br />(Nothing Fails) \\"I'm Not Religious\\".  Hmmmmm. I don't believe her.

PS-love the Patty Hearst/Che Guevara thing.<br />(Hollywood) continues with the opening theme of having it all yet having nothing of true value, futility at the alter of false gods, etc...\\"push the button, change the channel\\" done with another vocal distortion, kinda like Bowies FAME in a weird way. <br />(I'm So Stupid) \\"Living in a fuzzy dream\\" is rather stupid, isn't it?  I feel stupid too, sometimes. Maybe I'll turn the TV off now. If this kind of modern life is not for free, then what AM I paying? Trippy opening vocal bit worth the price of admission. <br />(Love Profusion) There is one solution--\\"Open Your Heart\\" <br />(Nobody Knows Me) \\"No one tells you how to live your life but its just a setup until your fed up\\" The album progresses with this track, and seems to point to killing your television (media? entertainment?) to cut the crap and social disease out of your life.  \\"People trap(ping) your mind\\". Rather subversive message. Viva la Revolucian!<br />(Nothing Fails) \\"I'm Not Religious\\".  Hmmmmm. I don't believe her. Maybe she means she isn't into belief systems.  Cause, I mean, she's just .... religious. Duh. <BR>OK use of choir--much much subltler than \\"Like A Prayer\\".<br />(Intervention) Second love song in a row. Great realization of folk/electro sound. Pretty chorus. Should be a single. Maybe 'All You Need Is Love' is the answer to our American Lives?<br />(X-Stactic Process) Letter to Jesus on personal messed up Roman-Catholic-Jesus-love stuff here. Campfire song about toxicity. Can't really relate, but from what I hear, a few of you perhaps will.  Sound is Veronica Electronica meets Joni Mitchell up in Laurel Canyon for tea. Beautiful.<br />(Mother and Father) \\"There was a time I prayed to Jesus Christ, There was a a time I had a mother it was nice\\"  We're deep in the doodoo of emotional pain as she turns her back on it. A gentle John Lennon's 'Mother' with a rap in place of the primal scream. 'Momma Don't Go, Daddy come home.' <br />(Die Another Day) Best thing she's done since Ray of Light. And as an added bonus, her most sly and subtle lyrics.  Every morning I wake up and die another day, and it makes me happy.<br />(Easy Ride) I guess no one would let Madonna get away with titling the song 'What I Want' but it is exactly that-a nice closeout song with wishes. I guess you still want things even though you have everything?  Beautiful.
B00008S2VG|5.0|What can i say.....Madonna has done it again....with one of the BEST albums of the year....she's managed to fuse the electro and acoustic sound into an album that's melodic,catchy, and VERY personal.....if anyone still questions Madonna's talent after hearing this album they are in dire need of some psychiatric HELP!
0761119752|5.0|This book is great. We have made it into a song and my whole family knows all the words. Its so much fun and I know we'll be singing it for years to come!!!
0385474547|1.0|I was forced to read this book for my high school lit. class and I am truly convinced that the teacher did it for cruel and unusual punishment. It is almost impossible to concieve how boring this novel was. The main character was very annoying. He was arrogant and never interesting. you never got to get personal with the character's. It was like reading a quick obituary. The plot never got good and there was no humor. only flat meaningless words.I'm not the only one who felt this way. No one in my class liked the book and we complained everyday. my best friend was incapable finishing the book. if you're a kid in school don't even try it.
B00005A46T|5.0|The new slipknot cd iowa is a great improvment from their 1st cd whcih was rely good also. It seems in this cd that they've incorporate highly complex lyrics and kick ... music. Drummer as improved his fsatness and quick abilities in all the songs. Let's face it, it's better than the 1st cd. This cd has much more power than the 1st. In all, they may no be the next \\"Slayer\\" but that's old, this is new, so stop ur bitchin about..oh they are not \\"slayer\\" material. We need somehting new and thes guys did it.KEEP ROCKIN
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I have heard every Godsmack song ever since they came out and loved all of em.  But once I heard this album on the radio I knew that i had to purchase it.  When I got the cd I was shocked at what I heard.  It was better than i expected.  I was amazed by how the riffs were easy, yet fun to play.  It was hard for me to put down my bass after hearing just the first three songs.  If you are a godsmack fan or are just getting into rock, i would have to say that this is the album to buy.  Godsmack's unique sound is partly what makes this and all of their albums good to listen to.  If you listen to the lyrics and everything that is going on in their songs you will find that it kind of creates a transe effect.  This album is the way to go!
0525946284|4.0|I love Ken Follett and keep waiting for something as good as The Pillars of the Earth, but that is not happenning.  This was a good story, good book.  I learned a little more about some of the behind the scenes situations during WWII.
B00006RIO7|3.0|I don't really believe the hype about Renee Zellweger's &quot;amazing&quot; singing talents.  She's got a strange way of pronouncing her &quot;r's&quot; that bugs me (I have voice training, by the way).  I think her job on the more melody-reliant song Roxie was fantastic, it really showcases her voice quality, instead of relying on lyrics that she can't pronounce correctly.<br />Catherine Zeta-Jones as Velma Kelly was an inspired choice - I love how her voice gets all whiny in All That Jazz (the opening number) and how she comes off as an uber-diva throughout the album and the movie.<br />*side note* I'm glad &quot;Class&quot; wasn't in the movie - it's redundant and unnecessary.  <br />Richard Gere as Billy Flynn?  I don't agree - his voice is annoying, not good in my opinion.  The only exception is his performance on &quot;We Both Reached for the Gun&quot; where his talents are perfectly suited to sing this song.  This was my second favorite piece on the album.<br />Which leads to #1 - the Cell-Block Tango.  Incredible!  My favorite on Broadway, my favorite on screen as well.  <br />This was a great album to listen to, even with the addition of the &quot;out-of-place&quot; number 17 and 18 tracks.  It's on my list of &quot;must-have albums!&quot;
0385508417|5.0|The story is about the not so classic idea of skipping the Christmas season chaos. How many of us have thought of doing something different in Christmas? Well, the character does it and encounters himself with a funny situation after another.<br />This book portrays the battle of doing what you want when you want and how far society will let you go to accomplish it.<br />It's a great and entertaining read that I recommend to all of you who want to have a good laugh and dare to do something different with your holidays. Enjoy!!
B00008S2VG|1.0|I wasn't a big fan of her last CD, &quot;Music&quot;. I LOVED &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and was hoping to get something even close to that. However, this CD is horrendous in every way. This is coming from a person who was thinking that she would go back to the &quot;Ray of Light&quot; format with William Orbit. However, she returned to the horrific compositions of French electronica artist Mirwais Ahmadzai. Not only his music horribly &quot;off&quot;, but the lyrics are ridiculous as well. I had no idea of what Madonna was talking about throughout this CD. Actually I did, but not too much of it made sense. Who is she to criticize the &quot;matrix&quot;? She's benefited from this &quot;programmed&quot; world as so she refers to it throught the CD. I would be wrong if I called her confused, but one thing is for sure I'm not confused about this thrown together CD. I definitely can say that I didn't like any of the songs. Some of them are listenable for one time, but there's definitely nothing to come back to. If not for the controversy over her video for &quot;American Life&quot;, I'd find it hard to even think about this ridiculous effort. It would be out of my mind in a heartbeat. She desperately needs to find a new producer because Mirwais just doesn't cut it. She could pay me to compose better sounding music than this atrocity. I was hoping that William Orbit did something on this CD, but all for not. If she can't get with the right producers, then maybe it's time for her to retire as everyone definitely knows she can't get by on her voice or &quot;insightful&quot; lyrics. Which are nothing special normally.

0790742314|5.0|Gremlins: Classic 80's cinema, and Joe Dante's best work.  If you haven't see this movie, shame on you!  Go and see it.<br />The movie open up when inventor Rand Peltzer(Hoyt Axton)is lead into a small curio shop in chinatown by the store owner's grandson.  Rand hears some strange noises coming from the back of the pet shop and heads back to see what it is.  The noises are eminating from a small furry creature called a 'Mogwai'.  Impressed with it, Mr. Peltzer offers $200 for it, but is told that it is not for sale.  \\"With Mogwai comes much resposibility,\\" says the shop owner. \\"I cannot sell him at any price.\\"  The Chinese man's grandson, however, tells him to meet him outside with the money.  Once outside, he is handed the Mogwai. The kid then tells Mr. peltzer three rules he must remember: #1:Keep him out of the light, especially sunlight. #2: Don't get him wet, and the most important rule: NEVER feed him after midnight.  <br />Rand comes back home and presents his son, Billy(Zach Galligan) the Mogwai, which he has christened 'Gizmo'.  Mom tries to take a picture of the Mogwai, thus breaking the first rule...and the other two will be broken in a matter of hours!  The next day, Billy's friend Pete spills water on the Mogwai, breaking the second rule.  When Mogwais are wet, they reproduce.  Soon, 5 new mogwais are born, one of which is named 'Stripe' due to a stipe of white hair running down his back.  That night, the Mogwais start making a ruckus for some food.  Billy checks his clock, which reads 11:00, so he gives the mogwais some left over chicken.  All of them eat it, except Gizmo.  The next morning, Billy wakes up to discover 5 sticky cocoons on the ground next to his bed.  His mother asks him if he fed the mogwai after midnight.  Billy checks his clock, which still reads 11:00.  The mogwais tricked him into feeding them after midnight by chewing through the power cord.  When the cocoon hatch, Gremlins come out of them, and run amok, in the most comical way possible, of course.  Can Billy stop the Gremlins and save his town?  Watch and find out!
B00008PW3Q|4.0|I'll make it short with this review, I bought this new collection and I've been playing it and its growing on me.<br />The guitar work is so quirky and insane at times and the songs<br />themselves are right up there with what I expected from these<br />middle age rock stars who helped define a whole generation<br />during the 70's and 80's.  Its great to have them back together<br />and making such interesting music. Christine McVie is missed<br />but this collection has a whole different feel without her<br />touches, its not such a bad thing.  We all age as part of life, I'm glad<br />they've decided they have something to say and instead of making solo ventures, doing the Fleetwood Mac thing makes more sense. Their music deserves to be heard on radio, many songs<br />have a little bit of their past sucesses as well as some<br />very interesting vocal treaments. One of the best of the year<br />so far and with 18 songs and close to 75 mins this is like<br />a double album of songs from their heyday! Check it out!
B00008PW3Q|5.0|There are several reasons I believe Say You Will is the best FM album ever.  First and foremost, the spirit of FM is Stevie and Lindsey.  Once Stevie did her solo albums, FM albums were a bit hard to take simply because there wasn't enough Stevie!  In past FM albums, we'd be lucky to get 3 or 4 Stevie songs and for us diehard Stevie fans that simply was not enough.  <br />Stevie was and is always the mystical lyricist, while Lindsey has always been the great studio experimenter.  Together, they are awesome.  Don't get me wrong, I like Christine.  But Christine had always been the &quot;run of the mill&quot; pop song singer.  Granted her songs could sometimes prove to be a nice counterpoint to Stevie's &quot;out there&quot; songs and Lindsey's hardcore weirdness, but overall, Christine was just &quot;there&quot;.  <br />So, why is this the best FM album?  There is enough great Stevie songs to satisfy the greatest of Stevie fans and there is enough of Lindsey's uniqueness to make this CD truly and unforgettably awesome.  <br />I read many of these reviews and have to laugh...the complaints about Christine not being on this CD come off sounding like people don't want to accept reality.  Christine doesn't want to do this anymore.  It was her decision.  FM has changed once again...get over it and move on.  And besides there is enough great material here...<br />I think the centerpiece of this CD is &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot;.  Stevie sounds angry and as we all know emotions lead to great material.  Rumours was all out emotions.  &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot; is a great rock song.  &quot;Destiny Rules&quot; and &quot;Thrown Down&quot; are more typical Stevie songs, while &quot;Goodbye Baby&quot; and &quot;Illume&quot; are wonderful songs with messages.  <br />Lindsey's songs all seem to have strong political messages, whether it's &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; or &quot;Murrow...&quot;  <br />In summary...there are 18 incredible songs by two of the most talented musicians...AWESOME
0553208845|5.0|Siddhartha is a powerful book. It is focused on one individual's spiritual journey through life. It is a book about illumination of self-discovery, learning the lessons and meaning of life through our individual experiences. It is a journey that teaches us the importance of finding, as contrary to simply seeking. After reading this book we can truly obtain wisdom and understanding of life.
B00005YW4H|4.0|From the opening of the CD I was SHOCKED to find explicit content throughout. Offensive to both homosexuals and Tibetan monks through several lyrics. The bulletproof monk was a GREAT film, filled full of humourous one-liners and a hat-full of SPECIAL EFFECTS. STAY CLEAR OR YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. This album is nothing more than a skidmark on the quality of a musical shelf...
0345448898|5.0|I read the entire trilogy and was entranced.  To all who share my enthusiasm for this series and it's philosophy, let me recommend to you another book you will find as rewarding, if not more so.  It is Glenn Kleier's THE LAST DAY, and it is a triumph of entertainment and insight into the same themes.  I'm not sure which author, Pullman or Kleier is more controversial.  Both are powerful voices unafraid to confront the hypocrisy and arrogance of those who consider themselves our spiritual superiors.  Enjoy!
B00008S2VG|5.0|There seemed to be a lot of negative press surrounding this cd so I was hesitant to buy it, despite my love for Madonna's music. I think it's fantastic, however -- the most mature album Madonna has released. The lyrics are introspective in a graceful yet compelling way (everyone who says otherwise is not getting it) and the melodies are sharp and inventive. There are moments of real beauty: \\"Nothing fails\\" with its echoes of \\"Like a Prayer\\" is a simply gorgeous song, alone worth the price of the cd. \\"Mother and Father\\" is devastating with its incredible beat and simple (not simplistic) lyrics about loss and frustration. \\"Intervention\\" has a beautiful and bouyant chorus that makes me feel exhilirated. I have been listening to this CD nonstop since I bought it and I continue discovering new lyrics and turns of musical phrase to appreciate.
B000001GPX|5.0|I was encouraged to buy this performance of the 5th by the overwhelming recommendation of reviewers at Amazon.com. And, they were right. This is a tremendous performance that far exceeds others that I own by Solti or Bohm (although I prefer Bohm on the 7th). Kleiber imparts majesty without bombast or pomposity. He actually renewed my interest in the 5th, which is so recognizable that it almost becomes cliche. He and the Vienna Philharmonic just nail this symphony, placing emphasis where it enlivens the whole performance.<br />DG did a great job recording and remastering these two performances. Although vintage 1975 and 76, these analog recordings are truly excellent in quality, comparable to digital. What a great compliment to such a stellar performance.<br />Not to detract from this CD, which I believe to be the best traditional performance of Beethoven's 5th, but let me also suggest the new interpretations of Beethoven's symphonies performed by David Zinman on Arte Nova. The performances are so different that they encourage one to appreciate each, but not to the exclusion of the other. Regardless, do not fail to obtain this performance.
B00008DDSC|5.0|This movie is definitely not for everyone, but I really appreciated the erotic elements it explored. The sexual tension between the characters is amazing -- every line seems charged. James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal are really terrific. This was a brave film, exploring a type of sexuality that is often taboo and doing it in a comedic way within the context of a real (if unusual) developing love story. Loved the strange imagery and the glimpses that we get into the characters' erotic practices.  I only regret that we couldn't see just a little bit more of what goes on between E. Edward Grey & his secretary....
B0000041DF|2.0|I purchased this CD based upon many favorable reviews on Amazon.com and by Argerichs success with the concertos of Prokofiev and Ravel.  The assumption was that if one can successfully master Prokofievs 3rd, one can play the Rach 3rd with equal aplomb.  Bad assumption.<br />Ms. Argerich plays with passion.  Unfortunately, this passion comes at the cost of articulation.  We can blame the recording engineers for some the sonic confusion (and they deserve it in these two live recordings), but the individual notes are not well defined and seemed slurred in these performances.  Its easier to forgive mistakes in playing these pieces than it is to excuse her lack of emphasis and articulation.  In her defense, she was more successful with Tchaikovsky than with Rachmaninoff. <br />On the sonic side, these recordings are an engineering nightmare.  The piano is close-miked in the Rachmaninoff concerto so at times it covers 100% of the stage.  Sometimes you can hear the treble keys coming out of the left speaker, only, while the bass is emanating from the right.  It is clear that the engineers emphasized the piano, which often overpowered the orchestra.  I should probably be flattered: this is the first time I have heard the Rach 3rd while perched on the lap of the pianist.<br />Although better in the Tchaikovsky performance, the sound engineering still hampered the performance in that piece, too.  The piano which usually appeared on the right, managed to move to middle stage more than once.  The dynamics in this recording were also mediocre at best, and not the least bit enveloping.<br />If we are supposed to excuse the limitations of live recordings, the faults should at least be unavoidable and not self-induced.  (I did not even mention the prevalent tape hiss in the quiet passages of the Rach concerto.)  In the end, the distractions from the sound engineers forces a thumbs-down on these recordings.  For the Rach concerto, consider Ashkenazy/Previn or Gutierrez/Maazel.  For Tchaikovsky, try Van Cliburn/Kondrashin, Giles/Mehta, or Watts/Levi.<br />If I did not already own prior performances by Ms. Argerich, I might have written her off forever after listening to this disaster.
B000070IXT|1.0|This movie SOOOOOOO sucks! I won't even waste my oxygen going into all the reasons why it does! <br />Just know this... I have a personal collection of currently 538 horror films.... And I've prolly seen close to a thousand! I own most the Resident Evil games, and love those, although the series is getting moldy. Obviously I pick up just about anything within the horror genre... I will never claim ownership to this dreadfull title! Also know that considering that it boasts itself as being the movie based a videogame series that features flesh eating zombies... There is not one on screen munching of any kind! Anyone who says otherwise is full of it!<br />If your that confused with all the horror afficandos and Resident Evil fanboy adolescents having such differing reviews. Spend the few paltry dollars and rent it first! Buying this one without seeing it, is definitely risking ownership of a very expensive coaster!
B00000427L|5.0|I love Rachmaninoff, especially these piano concertos, and Ashkenazy and Previn provide us with masterful performances. You really need to compare other performances of these concertos to know just how good these are.  The beauty of these performances is that everything comes together with such refinement.  Previn exhibits a great understanding of these pieces and the LSO responds well (as usual).  Ashkenazy is precise and yet expressive at the same time.  He articulates each note so clearly.  But more than this, Previn and Ashkenazy are magically attuned to each other.  The music flows with a perfect balance between piano and orchestra.<br />These analog recordings from Decca are excellently engineered.  The dynamic range is exceptional with a wide soundstage.  As with other London/Decca and DG recordings, the midrange brass has a slight edge to it.  Also, Ashkenazy is close miked, so his piano extends across 60% of the soundstage, which is not exactly realistic.  However, these are minor quibbles that do not detract from a masterful performance and an otherwise expansive, crisp recording.<br />There is no reason to restrict oneself to a single performance of these marvelous concertos.  But, if ever I had to restore my collection, I would purchase this set first.
B00008S2VG|5.0|To sit up here and try to convince people to buy this album would me completely Asinine! Considering Madonna has shown us since \\"Erotica\\" that she is a consistant reinvention. I mean this woman has changed her style on every lp and it has always worked and been cutting edge production. And this new guy Mirwais Ahmadzai\\" just proves that point even further. This is is a militant hardcore effort at best! The production is so advanced and furturistic it would put you in the mind of \\"Timbaland & Missy Elliot\\". Mirwais might as well be the European Timbaland. And it really sickens me as an Afro American to see Madonna's works not fully excepted by other Afro Americans. I mean her beats and Production is just as good as any Timbaland or Neptunes track. This is an Amazing work it will dance you til you drop ! It also has some interesting techniques in the mixes. Her voice sounds like their is static in it in some places. Also the music cuts out to make you feel there is something wrong with your box. Alot of sound effects but I am sure you are not surprised. The whole albums works this is MAdonna's hardcore effort at best! Would I say it is better than 2000's music ? I think yes because the beats I feel are alot harder than the previous effort. Mirwais was involved on \\"Music\\" but not totally. On this one it is just Mirwais & Madonna! I will give you a hint \\" American Life\\" is a mix of acoustics with hard electronic \\"Drum N Bass\\" influenced production with futuristic soundscapes! I wish Janet Jackson & Prince would take note of some of this!<br />Arish
B000001GQQ|5.0|I purchased this CD for the Ravel concerto.  I own other performances of Prokofiev, but another interpretation is always welcome.  It doesn't really matter, because the performances of both pieces are very good.  Ms. Argerich plays deftly and the demands of these pieces, particularly the Prokofiev, do not impede her well-chosen pace.  She really knows the Prokofiev and it shows.  Additionally, she and Abbado are in sync, and the sound of the piano and orchestra are well balanced.  Under Abbado's direction, the Ravel concerto is sprite and lively.<br />The sonics of these mostly-1967 recordings are excellent.  These recordings have depth and extension.  The clarity and detail really favor the Ravel concerto.<br />There are others (Ashkenazy/Previn, Graffman/Szell, Berroff/Masur) who perform the Prokofiev well, but this coupling of Argerich/Abbado is also good.  And, for me, it is the only one to include a nice Ravel bonus.  Definitely recommended.
B000059H98|5.0|If you're looking for the next amazing work of cinema... keep looking.. Tank GIrl is a FUN movie, that's it. I love the comics, and if you do too i'll warn you now... don't expect the movie to match the comics at all... but it is a fun movie, with lots of quotables and if you want a giggle, this will do it... people who pan it have a certain problem... no sense of humor :)
B00000IFP6|5.0|Compared to traditional interpretations, performances by Zinman strike me as being more intimate.  The Zurich ensemble sounds smaller, on a smaller stage, and gives the impression of playing to a few close friends and me.  Initially, I thought this smaller venue would benefit only the first four symphonies, but in truth all symphonies came across as fresh and lively, even the 9th.<br />We traditionally hear these symphonies with large, lush orchestras.  In contrast, these are leaner and slimmer.  Don't misunderstand, these are not lightweight, and it seems to make the orchestra more nimble.  The lessened reverberation from the concert hall is in keeping with this slimmer approach.<br />Digital recordings do not always equate to perfect sonics, but the engineers did a superb job of capturing these symphonies as clear and realistic.  You feel that you are there with the orchestra.  The tempo of most pieces is more brisk, but does not seem rushed (except the opening of the 5th which initially took me by surprise).  I envision listening to \\"traditional\\" performances sitting back in an comfortable leather chair with a glass of port.  Zinman's performances have me on the edge of my chair, anxious to catch the next nuance.  This sprite approach to well known Beethoven need not replace traditional performances, but for now, I will continue to enjoy these Zinman performances more frequently.  This cycle is easily 5 stars.
B00005A46T|5.0|First of all, I am not a 'poser', a term found in several reviews of this cd to label the people who actually appreciate this band. Slipknot was one of those bands I had heard a lot about, but never heard them play. I usually hang around with a crowd that listens to Iced Earth, Megadeth, Slayer, etc. (\\"old metal\\"). I make a regular habit of listening to these bands as well, and hold old metal in higher regards than \\"nu metal\\". So when Slipknot first came out, people said \\"They're no good, they're no good. Complete waste of time. No talent bla bla bla ...\\" And like a fool, I listened to them. I let '99 - '02 pass me by thinking this band was the definition of what a 'metal' band should not be. While all the time never hearing them, for keep in mind, Slipknot is not played on the radio. Finally in February '03 I saw a used copy of Iowa available for [cheap]. It kept catching my eye as I walked past it, with it's shiny cover with a goat on it. Finally, I figured \\"What the hell?\\" and snatched it for cheap. After the first listen to \\"People = S***\\", I knew that the whole time my \\"old metal\\" friends were actually the ones being posers. They couldn't name a single Slipknot song, or recognize any material if played for them. They, like me, had never heard Slipknot. So, here I am, a fan of \\"old metal\\" getting into a band four years later that is on the verge of breakup right now. <br />I will tell you the truth. Slipknot kicks royal [butt], and here are just a few things I love. You may be aware that Corey Taylor also sings for Stone Sour, a sing-songy melodic ... band. Well, there are no clean vocals on this album. None. Corey has even said that he has almost lost his voice just singing for the band. Corey Taylor has a unique way of fading in and out of this blood curdling vocal performance to a kind of talk-singing back into a scream again. There is also a fast delivery of words, some consider this rap, but there is just no way. The whole time Corey Taylor is delivering his voice, he is screaming. You must understand that this music is so fastpaced, that any slower of a delivery from Corey would seem out of step, making it sound awkward. I'm sorry, rappers do not rap while they are screaming their lungs out. POD raps, RATM raps, Linking Park raps, Slipknot does not. There is no normal monotonous voice talking with a rhythm to the music, ever. Fast demon-like screaming is all you are going to get. Corey's lyrics are very angry as well, which is the way it should be in metal, and I like it. You might also be aware that this band has a \\"dj\\" in it. I'm sorry about that too, for the only indication I get of a turntable in use is on \\"People = S***\\", and this scratch is not even a scratch, not to mention not even a funky-feeling hip hop vibe is detectable in the noise that the record makes, it's more of a haunting sound. Mind you, I only here a turntable used once distinctly on #2, the rest of its use and use of the samples are faint in the background in songs like \\"New Abortion\\". One thing I will admit about Slipknot is that the guitars make funny Korn-like noises sometimes, but not often enough to bother me. What we actually have here is a rather talented and decent band, the three beat keepers (two percussionists, and a drummer) work wonderfully together, and their best work can be found on \\"People = S***\\", \\"Disasterpiece\\", and \\"New Abortion\\", not only is the drummer good on double bass, but does great armwork as well, not to mention being assisted even moreso by two others playing percussion. The percussion work on Iowa is INTENSE to say the least, in fact I would say that work at percussion is the thing that Slipknot does best, not guitarwork like most metal bands like to boast. As for the guitarists themselves, they are nothing to really boast about, but they alright in keeping up with the speedy percussion work and making funny noises. (They play fast enough and talented enough to satisfy me.) Bottom line, there is pretty much nothing hip hop about Slipknot, this is dark, death screamy stuff. If you do not like death screamy stuff, then forget this, for there is no singing (except a little on \\"My Plague\\"). Slipknot is intense music that I can appreciate. And another thing, I'm 19 going on to 20, and I like this, so if this music is supposed to be meant for young kiddies around the ages of 13 and 14 (which, judging by the lyrics I would hope not), then I may possibly never grow up. This is good stuff period. Although I did find the song \\"Skin Ticket\\" a little annoying ....
B00000K3D4|5.0|The line Sarah always forgot, until the end. I have this movie on VHS and DVD, I wore my first copy out as a little girl. I loved it so much; and now my children love it. It was what inspired my imagination as a girl. If you loved the movie I suggest you also get The Goblin Companion by Brian Froud, Illustrator and creator of the Labyrinth's goblins, it is so wonderful and has the goblins listed there with their own descriptions. I loved David Bowie as the Goblin King, and I LOVE LUDO!!!! Wouldn't it be great to have a sequel where he comes back for revenge and steals Sarah's children because she took him down? Hmmm...all new adventures and characters join the old,Froud creations of course, along with the newest advances in technology. Sounds like a winner to me.
B00008J2DR|5.0|I'm a rabid Godsmack fan. I have every single Godsmack CD. i pre-ordered Godsmack's \\"Faceless\\" and recieved it a day before it's official release. I put it as soon as I got and I wasn't dissapointed one bit. The CD is awsome. It's their best yet, and I can honestly say that I can't help but to listen to it everyday. \\"Serenity\\" is a beautiful song. I like all the songs, but my favorites are the ones I can really relate to such as \\"Re-Align\\", I F*cking Hate You\\", \\"Serenity\\", and \\"Straight Out Of Line\\". I recommend buying it.
B000063UR2|5.0|I loved this movie. When I went to my great aunt's as a little girl we always rented three movies, back when there were Circle Ks that rented movies after the local rental place shut down (this was before Blockbuster folks), those three movies were Legend, Labyrinth, and The Last Unicorn. Now my kids have seen them too, except The Last Unicorn but I am working on that.I love the new Ultimate Edition of this movie. I didn't realize that it was a totally different movie that was released in the theatres than what was originally shot. The extras added and the original soundtrack added back in made for an even better movie. I didn't know you could improve on perfection, but this movie in it's pure original form included in this edition, was perfection improved. A young and beautiful Mia Farrow, a young and innocent Tom Cruise, and a \\"devilishly\\" wonderful Tim Curry. I really believed in unicorns after I saw this movie as a little girl. I loved all the \\"extras\\". Any lover of fantasy should pick this edition up, not the original release, this one.  It is an experience you shouldn't deny yourself or your children.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I pre-ordered this CD and recieved it the day before it's official release. I have every Godsmack CD and this one tops 'em all. I listened to it as soon as I got and haven't stopped listening since. I must be honeast and say that i listen to this CD everyday. I love the song serenity, it's beautiful and relaxing. I like all the songs. My favorite ones are the ones  can relate to and they are \\"Re-Align\\", \\"I F*cking Hate You\\", \\"Serenity\\", and \\"Straight Out Of Line\\". It's an awsome CD and I recommend buying it. I'm a rabid Godsmack fan and am not dissapointed in the least.
0316776963|5.0|I usually read about history or political science, but needing a break from it all I picked up Me Talk Pretty One Day.  Anyway, it's a sure thing.  Very witty and very funny.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence has yet to rule the billboard charts. I've never heard such energy in one album. The arrangement is absolutley out of this world. As for the vocal performance on this CD &quot;Captivating&quot;. The single &quot; Bring me to life&quot; sounds like a scene from the Matrix movie. Unforunate for it to be on the Daredevil soundtract. Even though, I still love there CD and can hope the next single is &quot;The Immortal&quot;. Believe me, thats something to look out for. &quot;Five stars Evanescence, for a job well done&quot;.
B000002UAU|5.0|Although some critics have complained that Sgt. Pepper is the<BR>Beatle album that has dated the most, I think it is their crowning achievement, their unsurpassable masterpiece.  The<BR>lyrics, meolodies and groundbreaking album cover are indelibly etched in my heart, mind and soul.  Some may disagree, but in my opinion, Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the most spectacular album of all time, both artistically and muscially.<BR>John Lennon was so incredibly right...&quot;A splendid time is guaranteed for all.&quot;
1572522232|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I am no prude. I like gore, macabre horror, and sinister plot lines. But, Suspiria was just too disturbing. It is for those who are unconcerned with plot and dialogue and just like graphic depictions of murder. I only got through the first 10-15 minutes then stopped the tape. I contemplated just throwing the tape out, but that would've been a grand waste. I will never watch the movie, and don't suggest anyone buying it unless on an impulse buy ... But, most people, I suspect, will be highly disappointed. Save your money for a better choice.
B000002UAX|5.0|That the immortal white album starts out great,(like all Beatle albums), and only gets better? While my guitar, ob-la di,ob la da, Blackbird, Birthday, Yer blues. Revolution, and Helter Skelter are even better then the opening track!!! The white album,the mother of all albums rules!!!
B00008PW3Q|4.0|This may not be their best album and some people will have a problem with the fact there's no songs by McVie on here but it's a good album all the same.
B00008S2VG|5.0|i simply wanted to be the first to comment... well, i'm really not good in commenting stuff (movies for exaple - i go to the movie, and afterwards, when asked how is it...), but if you are already a fan of madonna, you sure gonna like this album. i haven't heard the album music, but i dare to say, it's much like &quot;music&quot;... i respect music so that i won't categorize it in styles, but some songs in this album are sure elecropop... so it's madonna - very professional sound + a strong female voice. by the way, madonna has a rap verse in the name track. it's kinda... new to hear madonna rapping ,)
0689835604|4.0|My son (18 mos) really likes this book. It soon became one of his favorites. The pictures are bright and colorful, and the text simple. I was a little disappointed in the fact that it was so short. Also my little one can't lift the flaps by himself, there is no cut-outs or flanges that stick out enabling little fingers to grab easily. I'm sure in time though as this book gets \\"broken in\\" that it will be easier for him to do it by himself. Overall a cute book that little ones like.
0345413377|5.0|The Amber Spyglass is one of the best books i have ever read. the plot is so gripping and compelling its a struggle to put it down. pullman manages to pull you into the pages with his enchanting style of writing and complex and instantly lovabel charachters. the ending to the story is unique in the fact that i have never cryed so much over a book, and i forewarn anyone who has not yet read it to be equipped with a box of tissues. i still feel a pang every time i think of The Amber Spyglass. it is a true literary achievement, and i would reccomend it to anyone who dosnt mind having their heart broken in the end.
B00008S2VH|5.0|This was a surprise for me.  You'll find some new Madonna inventions here, no doubt, but you will also find some really raw acoustic numbers as well.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes pop music, but this is not just &quot;Britney pop,&quot; it's &quot;thinker's pop.&quot;  She did a great job in making a new sound all her own.  This is one SMART diva!
B00008NRLX|5.0|For anyone not knowing the Jayhawks, I predict those that like any folk-rock, any alt-country, or are just plain into solid melodies and songwriting; they will like/love this CD. This release is a sleeper classic replete with song after song of flawless vocals, harmony, and music hung on superbly crafted songs that would make bands like Fleetwood Mac, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, The Beatles, and Garth Brooks simultaneously proud. These instantly likable songs stick with you and are complex enough for repeated plays. And the melodies are the kind that stick like superglue. The recording and production are definitely up to snuff with modern technology. <br />Yes, if you don't know the Jayhawks, you should - and this CD is one excellent place to start your discovery.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Lord Of The Rings The Two Towwers is the most amazing movie of the decade.It's full of action,romace and never ending excitment.I would recomend anyone who enjoys watching any type of movies.I hope you enjoy the show!
B000000HSU|4.0|After &quot;ROIR Sessions&quot;, &quot;Rock For Light&quot; gets less energy, it seems HR is tired a bit, doesn't want to waste time with his vocals, and it's the same for the music, however it's still a great piece of hardcore punk!
B00006SFLV|5.0|I was 25 years old when My So-Called Life aired and I felt as if I was 15 again as I walked the halls of high school with Angela Chase.  There never was a show that exposed the shadowy and tortured feelings of teenage girls and boys as well as this one.  My So-Called Life also portrayed how difficult it is for parents let go of their child so that they can make their own choices, however misguided they may seem.  Now at 32, I can still watch the school rouge, Jordan Catalano, and feel that rush of inappropriate, inexplicable, high school crush-love for the wrong boy and it is so addictivly delicious.  This program has rich characters that you would have wanted to have been friends with, fallen in love with, picked on, defended and even ignored.  This is the completed high school experience.  Gritty - wonderful - euphoric - sometimes painful - but always real.
B000001ZS3|5.0|Jean Michel Jarre's Oxygene album played a defining role in evolving the course of synthesised music during the mid 1970's into the synthesiser driven 1980's. <br />Oxygene played a pivotal role in defining electronic music. Okay, so Kraftwerk had previously done it and Tangerine Dream, but where Jarre succeeded and they failed was in blending the music into a melody, rather than just a 'robotic' sound.<br />Oxygene is a wonderful chillout journey from start to finish - a timeless masterpiece.

B000089RVX|5.0|This Cd is just amazing and I dont even like rock music.<BR>Going Under 3/5- One of the weaker songs on the cd but still quite good.<br />Bring Me To Life- 4/5 The radio friendly song that is putting them on the chart, quite like a Linkin Park song.<br />Everybody's Fool- 2/5- the least favorite song on the cd.<br />My Immortal 5/5, a slow song, it's only piano and WOW what a song, the lyrics are amazing. Amy Lee did a great job on this track. If you have a love in your life this song may remind you of them.<br />Haunted- 5/5, Are you kidding me? This song is, it's hard and the lyrics are amazing also.<br />Tourniquet -5/5, Most likley one of the best songs on the cd, another hard hit song. You can tell what she is saying not one of those crazed rock stars.<br />Imaginary- 5/5Probally one of the written songs, this and MY Immortal are the songs that will move you the most.<br />Taking Over Me - 5/5&quot;I'll give up everything just to find you&quot; a lyric in the song. Another great drum and gutiar rips.<br />Hello- 3/5 Well this song is also another piano song just by Amy Lee. The piano part is nice the the lyrics are a bit odd.<br />My Last Breath- 4/5, Just good could of been better but good, you will get use to it.<br />Whisper- 5/5!, Now this song is the jam!. I mean everything about it is amazing. You have to hear it to know what I mean.<br />Evanescence is a amazing band. I also got their 1st cd &quot;Origin&quot; it was an indapendent album, it is just as good. Some songs on their 1st cd appears on this cd also. It's worth your money to buy this cd. It's not punk, its not rap-metal,its not metal. It's just amazing music that people will like even the 1's that do not like rock music .
B00008S2VH|5.0|This is a great album, in particular tracks 5 and 11.  Really stunning, I can't stop listening to it!  But I bought this special limited edition version with bonus materials.  The &quot;bonus materials&quot; is a link to a website which is supposed to play the American Life video.  But it doesn't even play the video, just a black box with the song playing.  Where's the Bonus?  <BR>This album is definitely a must buy, but know that you'll be disappointed in the bonus materials unless something gets added to this website in the future.
B00008S2VG|3.0|I know Madonna has the nanny, the lawyer, the body guards.. living the &quot;american dream&quot; so why can't she hire a professor in english.. my point? the lyrics are AWFUL and all her songs are about HER...<br />How many more albums is she going to say stuff like, &quot;gonna reach the stars&quot;  &quot;i'm a girl.. i'm a boy&quot; &quot; my father, my mother&quot; &quot;shine your light&quot; blah. blah. every album is the same freEkin words, different beats (to some extent). <br />The beats are good.. I like the variety of sounds, although the electric voice reminds me alot of Britany,unfortunately. This is definitely her worst album.. well, not worst..it is one step above &quot;bedtime stories&quot;.  <br />3 stars is for the fact that she has a very unique sound and she is able to pull off a zillion different genres in one single song. impressive. and she still has a strong voice when it isn't hidden behind some filtering.<br />I like the song &quot;Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Stupid&quot;.. and that is it. the rest is folkish garbage.  Sooo...go get the 2 songs &quot;elsewhere&quot; and leave the CD on the shelf at your local music store.
B00008S2VG|2.0|The 20 year Queen of pop is much deserved...However, this latest album I was able to get a day early left me feeling that either age, children, or marriage had taken first place over creativity on her part...not that that's a bad thing but, this is Madonna we are talking about!  Bring us a cheerful high energy club CD and show them all YOU still got it versus this slow and at times rather folky try to be hip hop try to be whatever CD.  Your fans still love you but, you left us empty with this one and craving something for our summer's out having fun....

B000022TSW|5.0|One of the first things I thought after viewing South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut was 'this is everything the television show wanted to be but couldn't'. I really wish South Park was on HBO or some other channel that didn't have to worry about language and content censorship.<br />I hate musicals but here is the exception. The songs are dead on to broadway and older hollywood films and undermine that format perfectly. If not for the constant swearing and taboo subjects this could be the soundtrack to any children's film.<br />Satan pining away over living up there, meaning here.<BR>The mole and his exceptionally intense views on god.<BR>Saddam Hussein as the devil's love interest<BR>Big Gay Al's musical number...anyone notice the name on the piano? If you don't know what it is look it up it's pretty wild.<br />Plot-wise Bigger, Longer & Uncut is very strong with plenty of barbs about popular culture, cultural icons, has been artists...none of which you need to know for the jokes to be funny. Demonstrating the V-Chip as a form of cussing control still is funny even though it now exists, and I'm sure kids everywhere cuss at it frequently depending on mom and dad. <br />Also, much of the humor is situational. Kenny in hell, Stan's quest for the clitoris. They're running gags but they hold up as plot points. And Cartman, the experiment of parental control by direct grafting of a V-Chip inside him that shocks him any time he swears. <br />The humor works as long as you don't get offended by it and there's enough offensive material to get under a lot of people's skin. But this is a great film to stop thinking and just laugh. As I said, I'm not one for musicals but the songs had me laughing along with some hackneyed direction that made them perfect.<br />Part of the whole South Park thing is having a laugh at your own weirdness and taking a break from being civil. Here the intensity is cranked up a few notches but in all South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut is very funny.<br />It would have been nice with more features or commentary tracks but hey, it's still a fun film that'll teach you and your kids new and better ways of verbally abusing one another. :)<br />Sweet!
B00005CDNI|5.0|I think ABBA has some of the greatest songs.  Voulez-Vous shows ABBA on their disco roots.  The whole album isn't disco but most of it is.  The only thing I wish they did on this new editon of Voulez-Vous album is make &quot;Summer Night City&quot; the long version. The long version is 10 times better.  It starts out soft and then goes right into disco.  Another thing is that they could have added another song to the album, &quot;Dream World&quot;. I think this song could have been a huge single but they didn't even think it was even album material because it didn't even make any light of day until 1994.  If I wanted to be even more critical they could have added the long version of &quot;Voulez-Vous&quot; which is about 6 and half minutes at the end of the album.  It's CD age, they do have the room to put all these songs on.
B00005Q3TZ|3.0|While far from historically accurate and not even much of a good love story you get a lot of mishmash in Pearl Harbor. While nowhere as annoyed as many reviewers and accepting that films take license with reality Pearl Harbor was an acceptable film.<br />The acting is neither terrible nor good, split right down the middle, probably more to do with directing than acting. The script can't decide if it's a love story or war film although by the trailers and teasers it appeared to be a war film, especially as the press junket tours indicated.<br />That is the biggest problem, deceptive marketing.<br />What Pearl Harbor reminds me of is 30s and 40s war films brought to technicolor and with lots of gloss in modern Hollywood style.<br />There is good news with the DVD sets however. The material including two History Channel documentaries, the cursory making of documentaries and much more are uniformly excellent and provide more insight and entertainment than the film.<br />To conclude. Based on your acceptance of how films are made you'll love or hate it, or if you can get out of technical mode and just watch Pearl Harbor for entertainment you'll probably feel you saw a decent film. If you're a history buff you will be offended and if you're a love story fan you will probably be annoyed to some degree with all this annoying and gory war stuff going on. It's easy to understand the outrage some history and war buffs have and they have every right to be angry at being marketed by a film that is half romantic fantasy - and not as horribly realized as some make it out to be - but edited or scripted poorly. I suspect editing but have to give all negativity to the direction of this film. It is the director's job to give a film it's tone, it's character and to do so by making decisions about what kind of story to tell. Unconventional writing isn't a bad thing, three act books, plays, films are often the stereotypical kind of things many people object to here.<br />Pearl Harbor wasmade to make money and anyone who thought otherwise is foolish. Films like \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" are the exception to the norm, they are great films - period. Pearl Harbor is war story lite. <br />Th main reason to buy Pearl Harbor, especially the 4 disc set is for the documentaries and shorts that do a vastly better job of telling the story of Pearl Harbor. They are less ponderous than Pearl Harbor, the film.<br />Film: 2 1/2<BR>Extras: 4<BR>Print to DVD: 4

The hard driving, hard hitting energy of the music on this        <BR>release is impetuously crafted.  This is pure rock.  Each song has a special &amp;        <BR>incomparable feel.  Shannon Larkin, the new drummer, brings tons of energy        <BR>&amp; superior drumming skills to this endeavor.  Godsmack went all out on this         <BR>one.  This album is to say the least brilliant!
0897500482|5.0|Bruce Lee is absolutely the best martial artist on the planet.  During his career of being a martial artist, nobody has ever knocked him down.  Usually after their challenges, they would become his students -- Chuck Norris is the most famous one.  Once when he was challenged by 15 Thai boxers, he knocked them all down.  How could that be?  This book is a nice guide to his philosophy.<br />The book itself is not perfect as he did not really finish it, but later it was compiled by his friend and his wife.  Just like many Chinese marital artists, his work is also kind of unfinished, but that's because Chinese martial artists usualy don't think the art is &quot;speakable.&quot;  However, in contrast to many other books, this one is still very worth reading and pondering, and kind of easy.<br />The drawings themselves have helped me very much when I was studying martial arts.  Why?  No redundancy!!<br />His art can be characterized by &quot;economical, really quick, and no chance to fight back.&quot;  Usually, his opponent would feel like he has three legs or several fists.  Chinese called him &quot;Three-leg Lee.&quot;  He told his student to feel and react but not to think about how to do it.  The methods are well-described in this book and some others.<br />His philosophy can be simplified by saying that he cut off all redundancy hidden in the sequences he learned in China and from his friends in the US.<br />Not only the art, but also the philosophy is also an important thing that we can learn from his work.<br />Anway, if you buy only one book about his art, this is the one.
B000002G7G|5.0|The garage band of nineteen sixty-six definately matured in a short three years both in musicianship and songwriting.  The banana album is certainly a fine recording, my favorite of all the velvet's and just about every other CD ever made, but this CD is VU at their best concerning studio production.  The humor in Lou's voice is still there but the sonic-terrorism is not there(only in THE MURDER MYSTERY it tries to appear but is very tolerable).  Plus we get a chance to hear the other musicians in this fine band sing a number or two (Mo on AFTER HOURS, everyone on THE MURDER MYSTERY, and Doug on the opening, eclectic track, CANDY SAYS).    This CD feels a bit more flow friendly, compliments of the wonderful production put on by the band instead of Warhol.  Also there are a few real treats on this one.  My favorites are the ballad tempoed PALE BLUE EYES, the rock adrenalined WHAT GOES ON, the twisted SOME KIND OF LOVE, the crazy story told in THE MURDER MYSERY, and the show-tune-like Tucker sung, AFTER HOURS. Plus you get the Beatlesesque JESUS.    This cd showcases Lou Reed at his prime in songwriting and his pretty hamonies with great guitar work.  This is perhaps VU's biggest accomplishment in the studio and is very worthy of being a member in everyone's stash of CDs.  The place to start off for you VU newbies is with their NICO CD though, it is their best by far.

B000059H9E|4.0|Odd little film (even for Almodovar) that deals with the consequences faced by a prostitute's son when he shoots and paralyzes a police officer during a fight with a drug dealer...who turns out to be the cop's wife! Only Pedro Almodovar could have directed this strange little tale, adapted from Ruth Rendell's equally strange novel. It starts slowly, taking an almost aloof approach to the characters and situations, but once the plot swings into action, emotions and personalities (an Almodovar specialty) take center stage, and the film's tone begins to veer wildly from comedy to drama to tragedy to irony. Such a hodgepodge of moods shouldn't mesh, and in the hands of most other directors, this would be an incoherent mess. But Almodovar makes it work with strong characters and a remarkable sense of timing, both comedic and dramatic (especially near the end). Great performances (especially by Liberto Rabal, Javier Bardem, and the stunning Francesca Neri) are also a plus, and Almodovar was wise to pepper his film with strong personalities who make the emotional content of the film more believable, and certainly more palatable, especially when the viewer is subjected to sometimes wild swings in the film's tone. On a par with Almodovar's best works, such as \\"Talk to Her\\" and \\"Woman on the Edge of a Nervous Breakdown.\\"
B00004I9VE|5.0|Michael Jackson is truly a great artist. Even though he is one of the wierdest Sob's I have ever seen, his album THRILLER continues to impress me. I bought the album in 2002 and I love it. It is the greatest dance CD ever in my opinion with its great beats and his voice fits the part extremely well. I know that the guy puts a lot of heart into his lyrics and that is what I think makes the album truly great. Im 14 and I wasnt around in 1984, but I feel like Michael Jackson's thriller continues to be a favorite. I dont recall what the 1980's were like but his music brings an 80's feeling to my house.I cant tell you how much I want to dance like Jackson and I feel that he is one of the greats.All in all, amazing cd, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes to dance. MJ can do whatever he wants in his life, but he will always be remembered for THRILLER!
0226264211|4.0|\\"Capitalism and Freedom\\", the 2002 version, contains a brief preface for the 2002 edition, as well as the preface to the 1982 edition.  On the subject of whether he would revise anything to his original work, Friedman said, with one exception, that he wouldn't.  There's good reason for that.<br />The book is written for a generalist audience (like me), and pulls back from the nuts and bolts of economic theory in order to provide a broad scope that makes sense in plain English.  With broad subject matter such as \\"The Control of Money\\", \\"Fiscal Policy\\", and \\"The Role of Government in Education\\", all of which average around 20 pages each in a 200 page book, the reader will not be in danger of getting bogged down in esoteric details.<br />Some of the subject matter that Friedman speaks of in the present tense is only relevant in historical terms (such as the segment on the gold standard for monetary policy).  Other chapters speak directly to current issues (such as his chapter on the virtues of school vouchers, or the chapter on social welfare measures).  <br />Because the book was written in the pre-Civil Rights Act era and makes no apologies for the least amount of government restraint on economic relationships, the book provides an insightful glimpse of what free-market conservatives believed before the political paradigm shift.  Friedman takes the proper care to say he does not favor racial discrimination, but he also makes it clear that government intervention into such economic relationships doesn't necessarily make things better.<br />Friedman contributes a lot on the subject of monopolies, whether they be technical monopolies, private monopolies, or government monopolies, and which of them would be the least damaging under the circumstances.  In the same vein as Adam Smith's talk of the danger of private collusion, the danger of a private monopoly holding together is much less probable than a government monopoly or a technical monopoly.<br />All in all, for someone looking for a primer on conservative economics, this relatively inexpensive book is a safe bet.
B000002L7R|4.0|The 80s wouldn't have been the 80s without Prince.  Around the World in a Day was his follow-up album to the immensely popular Purple Rain.  While this album is certainly not as momentous as its predecessor, it most certainly does have its good points.  First of all, and I think this was a wise decision on Prince's part, Around the World in a Day has a different feel and sound to it than Purple Rain, a new mood which the cover of the album ably reflects.  There are psychedelic touches to this music, as well as a plethora of Indian and perhaps oriental sounds, that give the album a somewhat upbeat, rather mystical atmosphere.  The opening track Around the World in a Day sets the record straight from the very beginning, giving ample warning that this album is not going to be a Purple Rain knockoff by an artist content to coast his way down from the top of the mountain of superstardom.  Raspberry Beret was naturally a huge hit, and it has something of a light, energetic quality to it that makes it fun to listen to even now.  Pop Life is another pop-oriented song that got ample play on the radio, and its airy yet serious style is quite in contrast to the song and released single America.  America has a dose of serious guitar of a slightly heavy variety, making me think of (yet not actually reminding me of) Jimi Hendrix, except Jimi never screamed the way Prince does on this track.  Paisley Park is a wonderful song, boasting some of Prince's best and most emotionally touching lyrics.  It is followed by the equally impressive yet very different song Condition of the Heart; this love song starts with some impressive tickling of the ivories before eventually leading into Prince's high-key and perfectly mournful lyrics.  The final two tracks offer another contrast in styles.  After The Ladder, a serious, even philosophical track with something of a gospel sound to it, Prince immediately shifts gears to the wild, uninhibited, scream-heavy Temptation.  I can't say what kind of reaction die-hard Prince fans had to this album when it was released, but I admit having initially found it a little disappointing compared to Purple Rain.  Now, it is easy to look back and see how well most of this music holds up.  Prince always did his own thing yet remained highly successful, and this album is a case in point.  I could do with a few less of those vintage Prince screams, but overall I have a lot of respect for the new direction Prince followed on the heels of Purple Rain.reaction die-hard Prince fans had to this album when it was released, but I admit having initially found it a little disappointing compared to Purple Rain.

B00008NRI8|1.0|An absolute dud!  This movie is poorly written, ineptly directed, and edited with no sense of comedy or continuity.  I am a big fan of both Grant and Bullock, but I have to say that this is one of the WORST movies that I have ever seen!
B000089RVX|4.0|Many people say they are like Likin Park and Tori Amos, but I think they are compeltely different and Awesome.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Having been a fan of Madonna since 1984, I've been loyal to her through the highs and lows (personal highs being &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; and low definitely being &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;.)    She's got a great voice, so what possesses her to rely on Auto Tune? (aka the &quot;Cher&quot; effect from &quot;Believe&quot;) It was fun to hear a little of the electronic vocal effects on the &quot;Music&quot; LP, but it's just a gadget that is going to make these records sound incredibly dated very quickly.    But as on &quot;Music&quot;, this album lazily re-treads on the chopped up acoustic guitars, piercing ultrasonic synth noises and over compressed electronic percussion.   These are all great things in the remix world, but for an album, it left me feeling empty after my initial listen.   Maybe I'm getting too old to be the target audience these days, but the artistry, wonderful vocals and harmonies and overall well crafted pop music that I've come to expect from Madonna are devoid on &quot;American Life&quot;.  Not to mention that horribly depressing cover artwork.      Don't get me wrong..  I love electronic music (I think &quot;Ray of Light&quot; was a totally brilliant album) but this album has crossed the line of pop music and has moved completely into the &quot;techno&quot; genre.   <br />  There is one shining star on the album though...  &quot;Love Profusion&quot; has a great melody line which could easily be in the middle of the &quot;Ray of Light&quot; album.<br />  That's my opinion for today.. but I'll probably feel totally different about it tomorrow.   That's why Madonna is so famous I think... she can turn you off instantly until you give her a little more time and then you're hooked again!
B000006045|5.0|... if you like this kind of thing. Spare and haunting vocals, lush beats, and even a sample of an early Cure song (that 10.30.-whatever numeric thing- saturdy night one) resounds through the mix at one point. Top-notch production- even if you don't care for their earlier material (I do) or most of what passes for the ineptly titled \\"trip-hop\\" genre (I don't), fans of dark, brooding atmospheric tunes will like this. <br />Mr Andy returns (for an update of an old reggae tune- I think. I'm probably off on that), and Liz from the Cocteau Twins provides the dreamy feminine counterbalance to the stark, surreal ramblings of the trio. 'Inertia Creeps,' does wonders with an arabian belly dancer's thickened beat. The best album of '98 I'd say, and one of the best sex albums of all time.
B00005JLRT|5.0|I don't know why you people complain about evry little thing.  This movie was a great movie I thought it was right up in the ranks of FIrst contact.  It is a movie worth watching.  You guys need to instead of complaing you need to congratulate the people who worked so hard on this movie to make us happy.  They can just take star trek away from us if we keep complaing about it so just shut you complaing and be happy with what you got.!!!!
0671015206|5.0|This book is exactly what my parents have been telling me for years!  For years I have earned good money in my banking job, and spent freely, living sometimes above my means.  This book rang a bell and woke me up to reality.  <br />My life has literally changed after reading this book.  I was living the high life - spending lots of money on fine dining, fine wine, travels around the world in luxury hotels, lots of boys' toys...basically the life of someone very wealthy.  Anyone who looked at me would assume that I was loaded.  But it didn't faze me since I have a great job that paid well, and I could afford it.  The truth is that while I had a good amount of savings even after my conspicuous consumption, my savings would only support my lifestyle for a maximum of 2 years or so if I no longer had an income.  This book made me realize &quot;financial freedom&quot; was not about being able to spend lots of the money that you earned, but about saving for the future so you don't have to worry about whether you can continue to earn a lot of money.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to maintain financial freedom and the ability to walk away from a job without worrying about where money was going to come from.
6304981635|5.0|Trust me, with movies like this one kept alive and well, Bruce lee will live on forever. The plot Bruce Lee playing a martial arts master (who is also named Lee)with a deadly mission to fulfill. He has been recruited to enter a martial arts tournament on the the island of Han (Shih Kien)who is suspected of being a drug runner. Lee must confirm if the nefarious rumors are true, and is quite willing to do so, being that he has a personal vendetta with Han's bodyguard O'harra (Robert Wall, credited as Bob Wall).This is absolutely the way to to go for Bruce: after this movie, he clearly wouldv'e conquered what was then the notoriously anti-asian hollywood. The flick has exceptionally cool action and the coreography of the fights (by Lee himself) is especially well done. This even has on of the most memorable showdown's in kung fu movie history, an almost surreal battle involving mirrors. Bruce Lee was the master, and while today's kung fu stars are outstandingly skilled in their own right (Jet Li, Jackie Chan, Van Damme, Don \\"The Dragon\\" Wilson, etc.) it is impossible to dislike Bruce's films. Watch this and you'll find out why. Tolerate no imitations.
0316666343|4.0|Compared to music categories, I would definitely place this book rather in the \\"commercial\\" genre. But - and that´s what I like about it - commercial, easy-to-read with quality. <br />The book deals with the rape and murder of 14-year-old Susie Salmon and the way her family copes with this loss after her death. On every move of her sister Lindsey, her little brother Buckley, her parents and her murderer, Susie is watching from heaven. <br />There are moments when you will feel tears getting in your eyes, small details that show how much Alice Sebold knows about the pain and fear she is writing about. If you are looking for a stirring, fine little novel you will not be able to put down easily, go for it. You will not be disappointed.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Here's a question for you:  Why can't artists make great 10 or 12 song albums any more?  Why do they have to include six or eight pieces of filler instead of just filling us with 40 minuts of WOW and being done with it?  Now on to this album, it sounds great, and there are some real gems here.  But I am not sure that anyone in Fleetwood Mac has learned a new chord progression in the last 15 years.  There is nothing break-through or new, which was a characteristic of the 70s and 80s Fleetwood Mac.  <br />Finally, Christine McVie was a great counter-point to Stevie and Lindsey.  Her voice is so sweet and clear, and she produced some the band's greatest songs.  Having three singers was a great advantage, and she could have added a lot.  I don't regret buying the album.  It's better than most of what's out there -- but it could be better, shorter, crisper, and more innovative.
B00005JKJA|1.0|how they could release a movie this long without chapter search/track selection totally baffles me.<BR>This is one of the best films of the new millenium, but i can't justify owning it without the ability to access it without 8x fastforwarding through the whole thing -- especially with a movie as complex and interesting as this one. Buy it, but wait til it comes out on a different edition
B000089RVX|5.0|A band called \\"Scheer\\". They also have a female as lead vocals, which i do't know the name. When I first heard Bring Me To Life, I wanted to buy the Daredevil soundtrack, but I decided to wait until March 4 to buy the album. I said that it reminded me of Scheer because, they have similar song structures, but I don't own any Scheer albums. I'm still on the lookout for that. But if you guys can have the opportunity to have a listen to Scheer, then do. They have two albums out already, and they're European. i don't know if they're still around as a band. <br />For the album, I like almost all of the songs. But one thing I noticed, the songs are kinda repetitive, in the sense of the structure. Well, I don't know about it very much.  Another cool one, they don't rely much on guitar solos (kinda the trend today) which is cool, they have great vocals, riffs, bass lines, and drums. Wait, they even have a choir, orchestra and a damn good piano. Somehow, with some guitar licks, it would be at a different level, a MUCH HIGHER one. (redundant) It's a good buy if you want to escape some of the music that is killing the music industry today like Linkin Park and Avril Lavigne. (I really hate these artists) Well, that's all. Have a nice day.
B00003CXXP|4.0|CAST: Haley Joel Osment, Frances O'Connor, Sam Robards, Jake Thomas, William Hurt, Jude Law, and Brendan Gleeson.<br />DIRECTED BY: Steven Spielberg<br />MPAA RATING: PG-13 for some sexual content and violent images.<br />The thought of computers and machines coming to life is fascinating, since they are getting smarter and smarter these days. Legendary director Stanley Kubrick actually bought the rights to this film, but sadly passed away in 1999, thus giving Steven Spielberg the honors. The film itself, while lengthy, still is a fascinating and intriguing film all the way through. A major highlight of the film is the awesome scenery used to portray the future. Turning an artificial life form is not a new idea in Hollywood, as films such as \\"Bicentennial Man\\" and \\"Pinocchio\\", which is what part of the story of this film is based on, have already been done. Haley Joel Osment, as in \\"The Sixth Sense\\", does another great job in his role as David, the android robot desperately seeking to become a real boy, with strong feelings for his mother played by Frances O'Connor. One negative thing about this film is the ending, which to me failed as a point to end the film. Had the film ended a little earlier, before the final scene, it would have been a much better ending. Robin Williams provides the voice for Dr. Know, the animated wizard, which aids David in his quest for becoming real. The animatronic teddy bear, appropriately named \\"Teddy\\" (how long did it take them to come up with that name) is also fun to watch. The closet scene in the beginning is a direct rip-off of E.T., as the animatronic teddy bear is a descendent from HAL from \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\". Jude Law does a nice job as his role as \\"Gigolo Joe\\", as well as William Hurt, who plays the professor that designed the robots. All in all though, a neat idea for a film. Had Kubrick done it, it probably would have been better.
6305161992|5.0|Tia Carrere [bare], A blonde stoner decapitated by a samurai sword, strippers covered in sushi. Sure sounds like a [skin] film, don't it? Well it's not. This is proof positive that the standard Lethal Weapon formula (To polar opposite cops trailing drug lords) can be made into more with the drug lords being Japanese, and more kug fu fighting is inserted. SHOWDOWN is very well made, very funny, and very action-packed (although it would only have helped if it were 10 or 15 minutes longer.)All the action scenes are well done, ranging from a brawl in a bathhouse, to a duel in a colorful street fair. At there's twice as much comedy here as antone could expect, mostly curtosy of Brandon Lee (\\"In between cooking cycles, your'e supposed to baste us.\\"), who if he had not become an action star, would easily have had a future in comedy. Dolph Lundgren is also alotta fun as a vengence-driven samurai detective, and at times, rather inadvertendly cotributes to the abundant humor (\\"Point this in the direction that things are, pull the trigger, and they'll fall down.\\") On the level of blending action, comedy, kung fu, and gratuitous nudity, SHOWDOWN works like a charm. And just for grins, one more hilarious quote from the legendary Brandon Lee (\\"Kenner, just in case we get get killed, I wanted to tell you, you have the biggest ---- I've ever seen on a man.\\")

B000000W5N|5.0|When STICKY FINGERS was released in the spring of 1971, I had just seen GIMME SHELTER and went from being a semi-Stones fan to being a raving, proselytizing FANatic. I could not believe the sheer sonic ecstasy and lurid appeal of this album. STICKY not only coincides with the peak of the Stones, but rock n roll as well. From 1968 to 1972, the Stones created 5 classic masterpieces, something no other pop/rock artist/band has rivaled; not the Beatles, Dylan, Hendrix, the Who, not anyone. STICKY sits in between LET IT BLEED and EXILE, and is as good as either of them. It is nasty, poetic, bluesy, dark and dangerous. Everything a great rock n roll album should be. The musicianship is so sublime, it sounds like it flowed out of the players, rather than strummed, picked or pounded. Keith's mastery of incredible riffs is in full glory on this album, from BROWN SUGAR's crunchy raunch to DEAD FLOWERS' toe-tapping country licks. If you've never heard STICKY, or have never really HEARD it, give it a spin. It rocks, it moans, it cries and it rails as the greatest band in rock history proves you can't always get what you want, but you can rock the house down and still have a damn good time. This album is as good as rock n roll gets, I don't care how many flannel-wearing crybabies try to kick the Stones.
B000068PQ0|3.0|This is an enjoyable cd, nice background music, pleasant vocals, and fine production.  Some of the lyrics are pretty amusing.<br />But experimental, daring, or even very interesting?  Not a chance.  For the most part, this sounds like Radiohead on a sunny morning.  Compared to, for example, the Legendary Pink Dots over twenty years ago, this is incredibly pedestrian stuff.  The lyrics, when they aren't amusing, as they are on the title track, are childish and sentimental (reaching a peak in the totally unlistenable, juvenile &quot;Do You Realize&quot;). <br />This is nice background music, to stick in the cd player cleaning the house.  There are certainly many worse cds out there, and popular music has been looking pretty lean lately - but that certainly doesn't make this an &quot;essential recording&quot; for anyone's collection.
B000002AZ8|4.0|After releasing two amazing albums in 1991 and 1993, the cracks started to show when Pearl Jam released their third record, Vitalogy, in late '94.<br />Cracks in their sanity, cracks in lead singer Ed Vedder's psyche, and cracks in the overall band dynamic.<br />The album opens with three furious, acerbic songs making up in fury what they lack in melody. It's not until the fifth song, the haunting ballad \\"Nothingman,\\" that a true Pearl Jam classic appears. And while there are some solid songs the rest of the way -- the angry \\"Whipping,\\" anti-fame diatribe \\"Corduroy,\\" radio smash (though true-life tale of abuse) \\"Better Man,\\" anti-groupie rant \\"Satan's Bed,\\" and the haunting rumination on death and fame \\"Immortality\\" -- there are unfortunate duds as well. An instrumental goes nowhere, a spoken-word reflection on privacy is a joke, and the completely unlistenable 10-minute album closer \\"Stupid Mop (Hey Foxymophandlemama That's Me\\" keep this album from acheiving classic status.<br />That, and the seeming disappearance of lead guitarist Mike McCready. After peppering virtually every song on the first two records with his blistering, melodic leads, he's hard to find on Vitalogy, and when he does bust a lead, it goes nowhere, and in an awful, thin, weak tone. Maybe that was intentional, as Vedder wanted to try to establish \\"punk rock credibility\\" in the face of accusations from the likes of Kurt Cobqain of \\"selling out,\\" or perhaps McCready's rumored drug and alcohol problems kept him down. But these songs ache for leads that simply aren't there, even when they are there.<br />For all its faults, however, Vitalogy is still quite solid, if not a masterpiece. The best songs are true classics, and even the mistakes are worth listening to, both musically and lyrically, as a look into the vortex of a troubled band at a troubled time. We can only be thankful they made it through this dark period, though they would never sound this urgent (if confused) again.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Hugh Grant is one of my favorite film performers.  Notice I don't say \\"actor.\\"  He doesn't really act, per se, since he's always riffing on basically the same character...usually with varying degrees of charming, slightly goofy befuddlement (NOTTING HILL, 9 MONTHS) or charm barely concealing nastiness (BRIDGET JONES).  In a film such as EXTREME MEASURES, where he played a doctor turned amateur sleuth, he just wasn't convincing.<br />So much of his success lies with his ability to pick roles tailor made for him, such as in 4 WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL.  He's an intelligent leading man with impeccable comedic delivery.  When the material written for him is good, he is GREAT.  When it's mediocre, he's only OK to watch.  <br />ABOUT A BOY is the best script he's had to date (well, maybe 4 WEDDINGS is...hard to say).  He plays a rich, single lout who lives only to indulge himself and score with women.  He truly only thinks of his own pleasures...most of which are remarkably humdrum.  He's not a creep or pervert or hedonist, really, he's just monumentally self-indulgent.  He didn't even earn his fortune, he inherited it.<br />One day, he gets the bright idea of meeting women by joining a single-parent's support group.  He'll just pretend to be a single father, and all the single women who will greatly outnumber him will fall all over themselves over him.  AND HE'S RIGHT!!!  <br />But this is just where the movie gets started. Through a series of events involving trying to keep his secret just that, he ends up being stuck with a teenaged boy who is awkward and fatherless and extremely nerdy who also takes a liking for Grant and starts showing up at his apartment door every afternoon to watch TV.  Grant can't get rid of him...it's a kind of mild blackmail situation.  But slowly, slowly, slowly, the two begin to bond.  Grant, through sheer annoyance, begins to bully the kid into being less of a schlep.  And this tiny kernel of interest in another human being slowly begins to gnaw away at Grant's insular world.  He's upset by the changes he sees in himself, but he also becomes enchanted with the unique feeling of actually making an impression on others.<br />The movie is very funny and has lots of near farcical situations.  The laughs are never cheap, though, and most of the humor is character driven.  It's not an action packed film, but I laughed outloud at LOTS of it...Grant's delivery has never been better.  But it was also moving, but in a very non-Hollywood, tear-jerking way.  The viewer is nearly as startled as Grant's character to see that we've grown to really care about the main characters.<br />This is a terrific, moving comedy.  Every character is fully realized, even if only on screen for a scene or two.  It's beautifully filmed in London and there's not one moment where you feel you're watching an American movie.  It feels British through and through  (how weird for a film directed and produced by the brothers who brought us AMERICAN PIE...another movie that had surprising touches of drama that actually worked).  It's a sophisticated movie, sure to be hated by most kids...not that kids ever go to Hugh Grant movies anyway.  But for intelligent adults looking for a great two hours, with a story unlike any seen before, CHECK IT OUT!!  Highly, highly recommended.
B00000J7JO|5.0|These review pages are full of people saying it's not at all like Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and I agree, it's not. But it's not meant to be. If you don't like the Chili's new, more soulful direction, then I say go listen to the White Stripes. Yes, I own Blood Sugar, and it's an excellent album, but a little soulless at times. However you could never accuse this album of being without soul. There are a few too many weak tracks, but when it's good, it's stunning: one of the best albums I've ever listened to.<br />Around the World: The best track. A catchy funk number combined with a wonderful chorus. When I first bought the album I listened to this track three times before moving on to track 2. 10/10<br />Parallel Universe: Another excellent number. A guitar-driven, exicted build-up to a scorching chorus.10/10<br />Scar Tissue: Couldn't be more different from the last track, but just as good. Quiet, soulfull, heartfelt - brilliant! 9/10<br />Otherside: One of my personal favourites. The guitar melody playing through the song is excellently catchy, and the song has an superb sense of build-up. 10/10<br />Get On Top: The most rock-styled number on the CD. Good, very good, but doesn't stand out from the other songs here. 8/10<br />Californication: There's no point reviewing this since you've almost certainly heard it before, but it's a great song, one of the best. 9/10<br />Easily: Another of my favourites. Strong, funky, and extremely powerful. 9/10<br />Porcelain: A bit of a love-it-or-hate-it song. I like it personally, but you might not. Try it. 7/10<br />Emit Remmus: This is where the album starts to stutter a little. An unspectacular slowish rock song. 6/10<br />I Like Dirt: No, I don't. 3/10<br />This Velvet Glove: A song that tries to sit between rock and soul, and is mostly successful. 8/10<br />Saviour: Doesn't quite succeed what it sets out to do but an OK song, powerful in places. 7/10<br />Purple Stain/Right On Time: Neither of these songs stood out for me. Notgreat. But just when I was about to drop this album to four-stars....6/10<br />Road Trippin': A sweeping, tangible, scorched, lonely masterpiece. The heat of the desert, the long dusty roads, will be right there in the room with you. They could have made this song 3 hours long without it losing its power. 10/10
0060278250|5.0|I read too much, and over all the books I've read in my life, this one was second only to Return of the King (LOTR). I was rereading it recently and I realized how amazing the storyline was and how well-developed the characters were. <BR>If you didn't like this book or any other books in this series, get a life. Abhorsen is a great, great read.
B00008S2VG|2.0|I was extremely disappointed with the lead single, &quot;American Life, and unfortunately, I'm equally as disappointed with the remainder of the album.  &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; is a highlight for me, but it's not enough to salvage the album.  <br />I'll keep my fingers crossed for some good club remixes.
B00008S2VG|4.0|\\"American Life\\" is the grown up sequel to \\"Like a Prayer,\\" full of introspective, guitar-laden ballads that are rare for this dance music artist.  And just as \\"Like a Prayer\\" featured a couple of splashy, upbeat hits to appease the masses, this album offers the title track and the Bond-babe hit \\"Die Another Day.\\"<br />Aside from the forgettable \\"I'm So Stupid,\\" the songs are well-crafted and feature vocal performances more solid and mature than on previous albums.  Most notable is \\"X-Static Process,\\" an unusual song for her.  The subtle, minor guitar chords ala \\"Dust in the Wind\\" blend with a Medieval round of simple but beautiful melody lines.  Like \\"Promise to Try,\\" this song will probably not see the light of day but instead be an inside handshake for fans.<br />\\"Nothing Fails\\" with its gospel choir climax and \\"Love Profusion,\\" essentially an electronic update of the bubblegum \\"Cherish,\\" will be chart toppers. <br />In the end, a much quieter album than the previous \\"Music,\\" but worth a listen.  Madonna is best appreciated by a listener open to experimentation.
B00008S2VG|5.0|she never repeats herself that's why she is &quot;Madonna&quot;.
B00008S2VH|2.0|i didnt like madonna's last cd and i really dont like this one <BR>:(
B00008J2DQ|5.0|This album shows how dedicated the band is to growing but not changing.  It is a heavy album but not too heavy.  Godsmack has done it again, they have proven their talent by far through each album including this one and they haven't &quot;sold out&quot;.  Keep up the great work guys.
B00005JKED|4.0|This is a movie that you can watch with friends over if they want to see it or if you feel like watching a real expensive fictoidic version of 'Crooked Cops'. Denzel Washington is one bad motha... and jus' look into those piercing eyes and you can tell that if 'you' stab him in the back you probably won't live when you try to take two steps. Ethan Hawke plays and excellent rookie cop learning the ropes and doing things that make you wanna say 'stooooooooooopid' but it's that type of curiosity he has that makes Denzel's character unravel his covering of his bad side. Anyways I think this movie is and excellent buy and I am probably gonna get burned owning this copy cause I smell a special edition or something coming on the horizon! Still worth the look though!
B00008H2LB|5.0|this is a really great cd it has good song good lyrics, good music, good computer specials, the works! it's really really great! if anyone likes thiskind of music its great
