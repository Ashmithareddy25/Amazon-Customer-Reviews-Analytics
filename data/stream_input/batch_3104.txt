B001MM28JG|5.0|Such a great parody on Star Trek and a perfect cast to pull it off. Funny and fun from the get-go, and great “one-liners” to remember, like “Oh, that’s not right!” A must see cult following flick. Thanks so much Amazon, for making it a Prime movie for me!

0439023513|4.0|This book deviates from the original two the series yet still manages to tie up a brilliant trilogy while keeping things fresh and interesting.  Suzanne Collins sets the final hunger games book outside of the arena for the first time in the series.  However, this in tun provides the reader with the realization the entire world of the Districts is essentially one major Hunger Games.  Our favorite characters from the prior books are back and we also encounter a few new faces as the Districts final go into an all-out war with the Capitol.<br /><br />Katness is just as lovable and as frustrating as we found her in the prior novels, as are the men she surrounds herself with.  Just as in the prior books there is plenty of blood and gore as well as a fair share of disturbingly creative violence.  However, Collins does tackle the emotional turmoil that the characters face with a wit and depth that keeps the story interesting and helps the reader invest.<br /><br />Overall a quick and fun series!
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|USEFUL FOR ME AND PRINCESS (MY SHELTER DOG).  SHE IS EPLIPTIC AND I USE THE APP TO CHART HER MEDS AS SHE FOCUSES ON FULL MOONS.
B00ELOOYZI|4.0|This is great, certainly gives you a fix if you are away from KSP and want to blast off on the go. I really like the look and it works well for mobile. The rockets can be kinda loose unless you build them a certain way, if you goto the community reddit page someone posted how the build so they are more solid, and there are limited building choices. These are the only reasons I did not give it a straight 5 stars. I wish there was a way to do half star cause I really would give it 4.5 stars. If the janky building gets fixed or even a little more content is added I will change it to 5 stars right away. Thanks for this great game. Keep up the awesome work.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is super fun! I'm addicted to this game. The only bad thing is that some of the levels are very hard to pass. There should be an option to move on after a certain amount of failures. Overall great app!! :)
B00FXEL00W|5.0|I never usually bother to rate books I read but this was such a great book I had to let people know about it. I nearly didn't look at it because of it was so cheap but this book is so well written I would have happily paid more for it. Its a lovely story that kept me captivated. I laughed, I felt sad, I wanted more.  I look forward to more publications from Kristen Zimmer.

B002NHGG92|5.0|Great story line. Its a vampire soap opera. Very addicting. Highly recommend. If you liked Twilight series you will love these hot vampires!
B00EOFIYZA|5.0|One thing you gotta say about ellie, she's got a darn good voice and she's beautifully, gorgeous. Also she's not afraid to sing with her accent, most Brit's today try to hide the accent through technology, but not Miss Goulding. It goes to show you that she takes pride in her accent and her heritage, whenever I'm anxious, I can always turn to Ellie's soothing, angellic voice to calm me down. She's soft, without being weak and really talented, not easy for artists to achieve these days. Great Going Ellie and keep up the great work and I'll keep getting your songs. I own both your albums, Lights, Great, Halycon, OVER THE TOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, what more can I say miss EG is great Keep it up Goulding!!!!!!!.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Great story teller. Grisham at his best. One of the best books by Grisham. The writing style keeps your interest.

B002PEP4SC|5.0|I love the suspense and the intertwining of so many different characters, but the character, Nikki Heat, is great--Richard Castle does a great job of creating suspense and keeping the reader in the dark until the very end.  Love all of the &#34;Heat&#34; books--can't wait for more to be written!

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Being the first Reacher novel, didn't know what to expect.  But it is like the others - a good read
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|As a pilot that hasn't flown in a long time, I was so angry at the character for being one of the very few people that had the opportunity to sit left seat in an airliner... but as the movie went on I understood that this was a very sick person and wondered why the airline didn't catch his addition and denial.  Given he was supposed to be a very competent flier, I suppose that you could roll an airliner inverted provided that the Never exceed velocity was too far over... it was done slowly... and all that accumulated force (from the dive) was expended in a gentle bank.  Needless to say the airplane was over stress and the re-inversion would have resulted back into the dive... Hey!!! It's just a movie!
6305922756|1.0|DVD was defective! I'm very irritated. I literally unwrapped it in front of my class, popped it into the player and it was freezing up and pixelated. I JUST went to return it- and they won't allow it because it was shipped in September. Ugh, I wrote to request a replacement- since it's useless to me
B0088EDMMS|5.0|This movie is So awesome!!! I was excited for it to come In the mail. I own the regular one on DVD so I was pretty excited it was on Blu-ray.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|As soon as I got this game I couldn't put it down on the second day I got this I already made it to the second location. The only thing I don't like is the energy.I highly recommend this game.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|This movie I feel in love with! It's so cute! But kinda sad! I can't wait to watch it! I barely rented it from red box and I knew I had to own it.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|To me this was a good movie. Definitely keeps you wondering and Brad fans should not be disappointed. I was happy with how the whole zombie epidemic was presented along with a possible cure and that there were what I considered several hero's in the movie.
B008JFUPPI|2.0|RIPD(released July 2013)stars,among others,Jeff Bridge,Ryan Reynolds,Kevin Bacon,Mary-Louise Parker and Stephanie Szostak.I had high expectations for this film.I generally love the work of its two main stars and the totally off the wall concept was intriguing.But the execution was far from what I was hoping for.This has the same look and feel of Men in Black,but with jokes that fall flatter than yesterdays pancakes,S/Fx,especially where the &#34;monsters&#34; are concerned,that look SO fake,and a very poor and predictable linear script.<br />The story takes place in Boston.Reynolds is a cop and his partner is Bacon.It seems the two had a bust where some gold almost fell into their laps,and at first Reynolds went along with his partner and kept some.They were about to retrieve more when Reynolds backs out.At a big bust with cops and bullets flying everywhere,Bacon wastes Reynolds.Reynolds,now dead,is taken skyward and lands in the office of Parker.She offers him two choices:he takes his chances with judgement or he joins the Rest In Peace Department.He takes the latter,and is immediately teamed up with Bridges.<br />Bridges is a crotchety guy from the western 1800s period.They do not hit it off at first,but you know by movies end they will be the best of buds.<br />During their first bust together,the suspect gets away.After a lengthy chase they get their man.They recover a piece of gold,which happens to be of the same type Reynolds and Bacon had been trying to obtain in real life.Bridges tracks down a lead at Fenway Park.They don't get much info,but Reynolds plays a hunch and leaves the gold with him.Sure enough,as the two sit outside,the suspect also comes out and gives the gold over to Bacon.Bacon goes to Reynolds home and recovers another piece of gold there.He then leaves and goes to the bus depot where Bacon hands over what gold he has to a &#34;deado&#34;(the dead who illegally walk the Earth).They grab the deado but he also gets away,and in fact is seen all over the city.<br />Back at RIPD headquarters,the two are suspended from the case.They find out the gold is in fact part of an old artifact,when put back together can create a vortex which essentially rains dead people down on Earth for eternity.Bridges and Reynolds most likely will be terminated in two days time,so the two do not sit around.They track down Bacon and as it turns out Bacon is also a deado in disguise.They bring him in,but while they book him,a silver sphere taken off of him joins together and its effect slows all but the criminal deados down.The deados all escape and head for the top of the Commonwealth building,where they assemble the artifact to create the vortex.As the vortex starts to open,Reynolds and Bridges start shooting their way through the deados to take the artifact apart.They make it and save the world.Back at HQ the two get pardoned and the film ends as the two drive away.<br />You gotta be kidding me? Oh,you aren't are you? Deado's!!?? How simple,familiar but juvenile a term is that? It sounds like Deadites from &#34;Evil Dead&#34;,doesn't it? Geesh,were Bruce Campbell in this movie to give it some umphhh! While I was happy to see Bridges,I was not impressed with the chemistry between he and Reynolds.Nothing seemed to click,as between Smith and Jones in Men in Black.Speaking of which,this movie has Men In Black all over it,but it just doesn't have a quarter of the imagination and fun that MIB did.In that film the two main stars,as you recall,were hunting illegal aliens.Here we have the stars hunting illegal deados.As a matter of fact,if you listen closely to Bridges affectation of an 1800s lawman,it sounds VERY much like Rip Torn,Smith and Jones's boss in MIB.The so called&#34;jokes&#34; are nothing but.I laughed not once,but NEVER.Bridges and Reynolds had avatars,which is what mortals on earth see when looking at them;Bridges a sexy lady and Reynolds an old Chinese man.At the end Bridges gets a new identity for Reynolds,a girl scout with braces,wearing an appliance.Hilarious......not! The S/FX,as I said,are old and stale.In fact it is one thing that deters from the movie,big time.The deados are absolutely fakey looking all the way through.All that big budget spent on CGI...a waste.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s w/r of 2:35 :1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include and featurette, deleted scenes and a gag reel.<br />All in all a BIG disappointment.The cast does the best with what tepid script they got,but it is to no avail.The jokes fall as flat as the S/Fx.It is a poor mans Men In Black.Sorry to say,give it a pass amigos!th braces,wearing an appliance.Hilarious......not!

B0083P1QUM|2.0|Somehow, I'd never read a Scarpetta novel before and wanted to see why Cornwell has been so popular.  I was very disappointed. The present-tense narrative is annoying, there are way too many unexplained details (why the antique buttons??) and the murderer appeared out of the blue. I won't be reading any more.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Alice Munro takes you into a person's life immediately and tells the whole story, in a short story; masterful of story teller.
0140074317|5.0|Growing up with the N.E.S. as one of my favorite movies I finally decided to read the actual book, especially after reading that the author wasn't pleased with the movie adaption.  Although I still love the classic film, I see why the author was upset.  The book is even more fantasic, if you believe that is possible.  The continued story beyond the first film, which was badly done in the &#34;sequel&#34; movie, is a really moving and imaginative telling of the difficult friendship between Bastien and Atreyu and of Bastiens continued adventures in &#34;Fantastica&#34; (in my brain I still have to translate to Fantasia; I'm too used to it).  I will be passing this book off to others and re-enjoying it in the future; &#34;but that's another story...&#34;
B000FC2PKG|5.0|Still reading & has grabbed my reading it.  She also write Touch & Go, which is the best so far.  Try it!
B003CN4R74|5.0|One of my favorite CD's.  This is the 3rd time I've bought it.  One for the car, one for the house, one as a back up for decades from now when I can no longer get it.  It's that good.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|As always, Dan Brown takes you to places that you never thought you would go.  He grabs you by the hand and leads you into the bowels of places you wouldn't go on your own, but after arriving, you are glad you went.
B005KR6OB2|5.0|Gave this as a gift.  Grandson loves it.  Who wouldn't?  It's the complete series to date.  No surprises, no disappointments.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|This is awesome! It's metal in true Stryper form. This was the album that should have been after THWTD. No disrespect to IGWT, it was great, but this is one of the best Stryper albums of all time.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is one of my favorites.  I have bought 3 copies of it now.  One for my car, one for the house & an extra unopened for when one of the first 2 gets unusable.  That's how much I love this CD.
B00F6Y3FKW|5.0|Hardcore Dylan oldies may not find this to be a great value because they already own most of this. But to the uncle who just played Blonde on Blonde for his nephew and saw the light go on in his eyes, this could be an ideal gift for the next generation fan. Dylan was as influential as any musical artist of his time. This is a superb collection. 41 albums and more. Great value.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Simply THE CD to buy in 2013! I'm floored at the workmanship on this CD. Lyrically and musically Stryper's best!
B00EVW013E|5.0|This was one of the best action movies I've seen in a looooong time. I liked the main characters, the non stop action, and the jokes. It's got a clever plot to add. Well directed, well acted, good graphics, good lines. LOVED IT!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really enjoy the time dated shows that PBS offers .. Well done .. Its sad to see in today's world how much manners are missing
B005H9B44A|5.0|This was the first time I had seen the movie and the fact that I like mythology was worth watching.  Plus the fact that the second movie is due out today, so I really wanted to watch the first one so that I could understand the second one.  The story line was really good in understanding where Thor came from and what he has to endure on his way to become king including the bitterness of his brother Loki, the rivalry between them over power .  I would recommend anyone to watch it if they are interested in these types of movies.  Oh!  Chris Hemsworth is extremely sexy and does a great job at playing the role of Thor.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Always a thought provoking perspective and an interesting read, Gladwell has done it again. It is worth the time investment and he holds a mirror up to a new batch of our bias.
B006PZBR8S|4.0|One of the better movies I've seen in quite a while! Although the characters are all new, I felt all the emotion they portrayed.<br /><br />The acting was outstanding, in my opinion. I really liked the story line and found myself wishing for a follow up.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|nothing very great...these have been amply written about in different ways...by different authors ...ok for beginners...who those who have none to turn to
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|The movie is over after 30-40 min. Great stuff until then....then it drags on for what seems like 5 hours.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app! You can choose from several versions to read a passage. I also like the choices of devotions.
0142405809|5.0|LOVE this book!  Great pictures, easy reading, not too long... keeps my 2 (almost 3) year olds attention.  In fact, he asks me to read it every night, it's become one of his favs :)
B001NLKT60|5.0|This book was just as addicting as the first! Could NOT put it down! Stieg pulls you in within the first few pages and you better hang on tight! It's a wild ride!
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|Love their music. This album has a bit more funk to it than previous albums. Can't stop listening to it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It is a Great book I couldn't put it down-just like his original &#34; The Shining&#34;.  All King fans must read it!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|great!!!!!!!!!!!this is all I have to say. I am trying to get back to what I am working on .

B0078X2LKY|5.0|I LOVE THIS STORY! I remember my mom reading it to me, and I love reading it to my daughter.
B00FOWX6NM|4.0|I had this case for a day, I do get scratches like other people did in their review. However, it turn out that this case need to have its front and back plastic protector removed (which means we were scratching on the plastic film). When you remove the plastic film, the case is great!<br />BUT!!! It is sooooo hard to remove the film. You have to use your nail lift the film up from the edge, and take it... It would smarter for the manufacturer to place tab on the plastic film and make it it easier to remove.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is such a simple matching game.  It has a timer that you can turn on or off. I like that it's so colorful and easy to play, kind of like the way I get sucked into Solitaire, but faster moving and more fun. I turn off the sound because it's kind of annoying after a while. There are a few optional ways to play but I like the matching game the best. It's one of those games that is kind of relaxing to play. The graphics are great, the way you can drag the cube structure using the touch screen to view it from any angle. I always strive to beat my fastest time. Two thumbs up for one of my favorite games!
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|Very good Deep Purple!!! I haven't bought any new Deep Purple in a long time, and this one didn't disappoint. I've been a fan since the 70's. And it reminded me a lot of Perfect Strangers. They still have the great mark II sound, even without Ritchie. Steve Morse does a great job. And Don Airey is right there with the Purple sound that Jon Lord gave us for all those years. Let Ritchie do his renaissance thing, as long as Deep Purple keeps doing their thing at GREAT hard rock. It doesn't matter how old we are, great music is timeless.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|Awesome. Love it. A great return to 80's sound. Every single track is good on this album. A must have for all Pet Shop Boys fans.
B0026SFEW8|5.0|I'm not a big fan of musicals, but this movie has a lot more plus great music too. Great movie!
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|PACIFIC RIM:  Aside from the movie being great and really entertaining, the packaging was awesome!!! Great addition to my movie collection...
B000I186FW|5.0|A classic dystopian film that combines visual artistry, and action. It could be considered a cautionary tale about where we are headed as a society.
B004LROMWU|4.0|The thing that caught my eye here was the fact that the series stars Noah Wyle. After spending 15 years on the series ER one had to figure the next major TV Series he chose to attach his name and reputation to would be good. I waited for the price to come down before buying. That this is a another post apocalyptic tale of alien invasion, think V, was not an immediate turn-on but the strength of this series is not in the battle sequences between man and alien but in the relationships between people.<br /><br />Wyle's Tom has three sons. The rather mature looking 16-year-old Hal played by stunningly handsome 25-year-old Drew Roy. His nine-year-old Matt whom Tom is attempting to allow to retain his childhood, people grow up too fast in refugee camps. And twelve or so Ben who is enslaved by alien technology. Tom we learn repeatedly was an American History Professor before his world fell apart and his wife was killed. He is second in command to a cell of 100 soldiers and 200 civilians commanded by the rather militaristic Will Paton who looks after his soldiers and considers the civilians a liability. Throw in a female doctor as Tom's potential love interest and a surgeon who abandoned Tom's wife to her death and you have the principal characters. I was surprised to see Wyle resort to fisticuffs, he looks more at home cuddling his young son and hugging the teen. The scene which shows Hal cradling his brother Matt in his sleep is poignant.<br /><br />The upright walking 8-legged aliens must have been a challenge to the robotics department. What do you do with eight legs? Their warrior robots clomp around on two hooves that leave tracks not unlike the T-Rex's in Jurassic Park. And then there are the flying ships that shoot off massive plasma bombs.<br /><br />If you don't mind the Sc-Fi aspects of the series this is an excellent show.
B001NHNG64|5.0|No one better than Teacher. I am going to read the whole series. Lee Child will never let you down.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|A good read in science fiction.  A series of interviews about the the worldwide breakdown and recovery.  A freamework for any worldwide epidemic or catastrophe.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I have two boys and there both crazy about Woody and Buzz, this movie did not disappoint. This is a great addition to our collection.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|When you want to keep the kiddos busy, this is the game to do it with. It's not the violent kind, but it is a little aggressive. Lots of levels to get through, time consuming....
B00867GHS8|5.0|My boys just love Nemo and Dori. I had been in search of this movie for some time but was not liking the price. I found that Amazon was the cheapest. This is a great movie :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So Great to be able to play on my Kindle with a bigger screen. Easier to see and make moves.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love this book.. She writes with honesty, truth, and simplicity that makes you stand up and take notice. She knows her material, and she conveys  to the reader that she is totally into helping people make their life easier,and recognize that we are more than we have been told we are.  I truly recommend this book if you can put all your former notions of anything aside and can stand free of mind, and free of all belief system information. Just be open minded  like a newborn baby and let your soul tell you how it makes you feel, not your previous knowledge..Then you can soar..<br />Judith.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Rarely has a book touched my soul like The Book Thief has.  Indeed, it has made me grateful for the stomach flu that precipitated its deliverance to me.  While my rib muscles are still sore from days of involuntary purging, I am convinced that the benefits of this treasure will last a lifetime, while my previous suffering is all but forgotten.  Bravo!
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|I think this game is messing up my kindle I can't get it to re download and it won't let me on any other game I think all the good reviews where from the manufacture
0861714911|5.0|Beautiful collection of sutras -- a valuable overview of Buddha's teachings from the Pail perspective.  Bhikkhu Bodhi's commentary is brilliant and crystal clear, bringing these teachings to life for right now.
0385751532|5.0|This was an incredible story, and very sad. But it opens your mind up and let's you understand what happened. I found myself shouting at Bruno, \\"Tell someone who your are\\" then I thought more, wait a minute what about all the other people why should Bruno be any different. The book made me think about life how great it can be and yet how cruel. I recommended this to everyone.<br />Very well written, easy to follow and hard to put down.
B005LAJ23A|4.0|Season 2 was definitely a bit a of a low point for me but it is still leaps and bounds over most of the garbage that passes for entertainment on TV these days.
B003297I1U|5.0|My boys absolutely LOVE this toy. It has so many working parts and it's so durable. Worth every single penny!!
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I was on the fence with whether or not I needed to buy one of these.  What an Awesome product!  This has made a huge difference in my color correction tasks with photo and video!  Highly recommended.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|Anything that can go wrong when planning a family Holiday get together, this is such a funny movie and we watch it every year along with all our other favorites.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Quite possibly one of the best movies of the year.  So many people have criticized the movie for not being like the books.  Get over it!  Film is an entirely different medium and art form.  This movie was exactly what it needed to be.  Thrilling, exciting, well written and well acted.  The special FX were fantastic!  This is a zombie horror film for the masses!
B00992CF6W|5.0|well I love the game and don't freat android users just takes amazon a cupple extra weeks to approve the update.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|I can not say enough about this show.  The quality of the writing and acting is just phenomenal.  It is like the biker version of the Sopranos!  Awesome bluray set.  Worth the price of admission!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|You can not stop playing it is very good best shooting game on tablet ok ok ok ok a apple
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to use and see the cards. It's just as if I'm holding the cards in my own hands. Recommend!
1250029465|3.0|This book was okay.  I guess you have to take into acccount how interesting can a broke guy that carries a cat around with him can be.  The talking about the cat over and over again got old, however tis' the title.
1451666179|5.0|I preordered this when I heard about the book back in May (2013). What struck me upon arrival was the sheer thickness. I was expecting something closer resembling a graphic novel not a Game of Thrones book! I opened the book and began reading the first passage which was a new one, I laughed until I just about cried. Then I jumped ahead to a familiar passage \\"This is why I'll never be an adult\\" and noticed that the \\"Clean ALL the THINGS\\" image was different, that's when it struck me. Not only are there entirely new passages but the old passages have entirely new art work.<br />If you've not read Hyperbole and a Half on Allie's blog, but this book, never regret it.<br />If you have read it, buy this book the new entries are worth it and it's fun to revisit the old stuff with new art. Either way solid buy.
0865478015|5.0|Audiobook review: Author Oliver Burkeman narrates the book in his own words. Many times, an author narrating his own words tends IMO to fall flat. But, this is not the case. In narrating his work he is able to put the inflections and emphasis on the words as he intends them to be heard. This lends to creating a very lively reading. The book and the content is very interesting and the overall message is that our judgments about a situation and not the situation is what causes us the most stress. This works in many situations of daily life, of course there are situations that would be bad regardless of how you changed your perspective. But he goes on to explain how the initial shock of the situation can be accepted and dealt with. This parallels Buddhist thought and the works of the stoics “a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BCE” as described on Wikipedia.<br />The latter part of the book speaks much about death and our attitudes about it. I found this to be a little long winded but overall it is a good message with examples of how other cultures deal with the subject.<br />I recommend this book to anyone. Even those belonging to the cult of positive thinking. Like much of life this book will perhaps give you some balance and contentment.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|liked it so much i got my son and nephew on and they also love them.  great for camping and hiking when you need a fire.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I'm beyond upset by the ending. Not how she should've ended such a great series. Good luck reading it without crying
B00200K2UG|5.0|Great bag. It holds my Nikon d600 with 35-70 2.8 lens mounted and battery grip and my d80 with grip and lens mounted. I also have room for my 70-200 2.8 lens and 2 Nikon flashes and my iPad. With lots of room left over.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is fun and passes the time away nicely.Glad it is on my Kindle instead of only being able to play it on my iPhone.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this thing. I now have 3 . I use it with my iPad and android to watch netflix and YouTube easily on my tv.
0345803493|5.0|I love these books. They are a great love story. It has been a very long time since I couldn't stop reading a book.
B000002JBG|5.0|We bought this when my son was one and eight years later he still loves the songs. Of course &#34;I believe I can fly&#34; is a song you can't help but join in and sing!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This is just ................... EPIC!!!! I cant explain to you how fun it is! The only way to know is to get it yourself!!!!!
B0030MTQNW|4.0|although this is not nearly as detailed and fascinating as the book, it put forth a bitter aspect of heroism misplaced under a ill-conceived high ranking directive, where special effects were not state of the art (by today'd standards) yet amounted to sufficient cinematographic showing; e.g. for a good piece of history to be intimated for all generations to witness and ponder on the &#34;what could have been&#34;
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game drew me in from the start, and was entertaining throughout.  I had no technical problem with the installation or with the game at all.  It was a pleasure to play and I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves puzzle adventures!
0345803485|1.0|Reading through all the wonderfully-written laugh out loud negative comments, I couldn't help notice that EL James' fan fiction has begot even more \\"fan fiction\\" in the form of great thoughtful Amazon reviews!<br /><br />Maybe James is as bad a writer as the book suggests and Random House's editors are really bad at editing  (I don't think so) but maybe Fifty Shades was poking fun at the original annoying innocent, repetitive Bella who is also attracted to a tortured soul who just wants to hurt her. Maybe the sequels to Fifty Shades (which I haven't read) where the two get married and ride off into the sunset is a spoof on the Twilight trilogy where they finally do the do, have kids, and live happily ever after. Readers seem to get that Fifty Shades is a fan fiction of Twilight but aren't considering it's a spoof of the original badly written Twilight. In place of the teenage virginal girl never getting to have sex with her rape fantasy love interest--EL James finally releases the characters from their chastity and has them go at it bondage style (which is probably how you'd go at it if you were a vampire).<br /><br />I understand Anne Rice's books are better written but if she's also writing about having sex with vampires, isn't Rice just perpetuating the rape fantasy worse than EL James--who  was writing a *spoof.<br /><br />That said, I'm afraid, very afraid, for the readers who just enjoyed the book despite its repetition and bad writing.
B00DMK6WN4|5.0|Great family movie with decent message about never giving up...regardless of size or situation.  Nothing was too scary for the kiddos and there were the stock moments that make the parents laugh and kept me engaged.<br /><br />The 3D version was really good with several effects coming out of our TV quite a ways.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good exercise for the brain and really fun.  I'm ready for more new rooms.  Hopefully it will be soon. I can't wait!
B008602KQI|5.0|The first time I saw it I really didn't think it was all that good, and for good reason since im a media student but I won't bore you with that, after watching it more than 5 times I think this film was executed just right, enough to make me get the second and third books.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|From the opening riff in the first song throughout the whole album, it will take your breath away.<br />STRYPER is back and is better than ever with, \\"No More Hell To Pay\\".<br />I purchased 7 copies of the album. One to keep and the others I have given away to share in the excellence that is this album.<br />But one for yourself and another for a friend that you want to share awesomeness with, they will thank you later!
B000B5OD4I|5.0|My SXK007 has been worn every day for the last ten years. No problems at all and still running fine. It has never been serviced. Seiko autos are known to run for decades without a service. The lack of manual winding and hacking is much ado about nothing. If you wear this watch every day it will be fully wound up and never stop. The movement does run fast however, specs are -15/+25 a day. This is an Asian model and will ship from Japan, Singapore, China etc. The SKX173 with a slightly different dial is the US market model. This watch is the best value in auto divers. Check out forums that cater to Asian watches and see why every one loves them.
1449320104|5.0|This is just perfect book equally for beginners and professionals alike. Beautiful  read. Kudos to Authors. Brilliant work by Albahari brothers.
B009LDD54K|5.0|After watching season 3 I think Boardwalk Empire has got to be one of the best crime dramas ever made,  as good as if not better than the classic Godfather trilogy.  Everything about this series is first class, the acting, costumes, characters & storylines. Very addictive viewing.  I`m looking forward to season 4.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|At first I didn't know that my kindle fire HD can have viruses untill something told me. I rate this five star because my device was 100% clean, 100% fast, 100% easy, and the best part....... 100% ad free. I also loved this because it was free. Try it and buy it it's worth it
1476727651|5.0|Will Patton is an excellent reader, and that can make all the difference. However, this story is wonderfully written (duh, it's SK) and I've listened to it several times and enjoy it each time. These characters will stay with me just as The Shining did.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book has a little of everything-passion, betrayal, friendship, infidelity, murder and love. The author does a great job of bringing you into the personal lives and thoughts of 3 different women in the same town and shows they have more in common than originally thought. Well written, insightful and has a few unexpected twists!
B00DSLZCR4|5.0|Funny, touching and too close for comfort. I've read Allie's blogs for a while love her take on lifesnd dealing with personal demons.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book is filled with action, adventure, suspense, and love. I love Egyptian Mythology and this book taught me a lot more about it.
B00AH3DCAA|3.0|I purchased this exact watch a few years back and while the product was good out of the box, having Invicta service the watch was a bad idea.  This watch operated great for the first year I owned it with +/- 2 seconds per week.  I did everything that Invicta said I should do.  I sent it to them to for service (cleaning) about a year after having it and sent it back for repairs when I had issues after the service.  However, now after a year of the watch being gone for repairs (sent back and forth twice) they said it could not be repaired and would only offer me a credit.<br /><br />Unfortunately, since I did my homework on price, I couldn't afford to purchase another Swiss automatic that they offered on Amazon.  Two of their customer service representatives quit during the process and the history of the transaction was gone.  Invicta did end up sending me another model, but a Japanese Automatic that I settled for and is not a Swiss Made movement I originally owned.<br /><br />Recommendation...If you want a Swiss Made watch, buy it from a company that understands what that means and will back up their product with a like in kind replacement if they can't figure it out.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was better than any vampire/twilight type book or movie!  The characters are very believable and even though some were ridiculous, all were necessary to the story.
0385040253|3.0|Let me explain the three star rating. I give this book five stars for the wealth of information contained within. However, I give it 2 stars if you plan on using it as a reference for how to actually tie certain knots.<br /><br />Almost every knot every conceived is within its pages (though some useful knots like the capsized alpine butterfly bend and rethreaded double bowlines are missing) and each entry has a blurb about its history and traditional usage. The drawings are beautiful but not very helpful (you can figure it out... but definitely not as clear as some of the modern books out there).<br /><br />So I'm torn. On the one hand, I insist you buy this book because it's really cool (this is more than a coffee table book) to browse. On the other hand, if you are a climber/alpinist, search and rescue member, etc. there are better options out there for quick knot reference.
B00EL6ACOI|5.0|Before visiting Sea World you must see Blackfish. This is a horrifying example of how corporation's greed knows no boundaries. It&#34;s hard to watch but I hope that this will raise awareness and in the future humans will look back and be ashamed that one day something called Sea World could even had existed! Don't miss this movie.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|This is a timely and thought provoking read.  Comparisons to George Orwell are obvious but there is a true sense of urgency with today's obession with social media, closed circuit TV survelliance, and our quickly developing personal use technology.  We are forewarned!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun addictive game!  Play it on my Kindle Fire and smart phone.  Too much fun and all in a small package.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love what swiftkey has done with keyboard for big screen  such as phablets and tablets. For small screen such as phones theres no better app than google keyboard plus its free. If you have phablets and tablets then investing in this app is no brainer. I just simply love it. Hats off to developers because there are developers out there who updates their apps on play store but not on amazon so store. This shows this developer means business. k
B006LR0XLM|1.0|Dropbox brings the \\"ease\\" of sharing your files in the cloud to Android. But with that ease comes some very significant privacy concerns. Dropbox is a frequent target of malware authors and, due to some of their own lapses in best practices with regard to security and privacy, the group behind Dropbox has at time left themselves (and your data) open to snooping. If you must use a cloud-based file sharing platform, I would recommend a more secure one such as box.com or, at the least, turn on two-factor authentication in Dropbox (it's just one extra step to make your login more secure). Encrypting your files before uploading them to the cloud is also recommended. A tool like CryptSync makes this pretty painless.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Hands down my favorite Western Movie of all time.  (I'm a huge John Wayne fan as well.)<br />It is as if Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones were born for these parts.  (All the casting is perfect - I wouldn't change one thing)<br /><br />This movie almost EXACTLY follows the book - and you gain very little extra by reading the book.  Few extra tidbits by reading the book: (SPOILERS)<br />1) Sheriff in Arkansas wife who runs off... was a whore. She only married Jeremiah Johnson after knowing him for two weeks to get away from some guys who were using her really rough.  You see her hatred for Jeremiah and her son in the movie, but the book describes this hatred in great detail and shows what a ROTTEN human being she is.  In the movie your slightly sad that she dies.  After reading the book - you are happy she died as the earth has one fewer scumbags.<br />2) Newt isn't hit over the head by Blue Duck when Lorena is kidnapped.  That should be obvious that it is a deviation from the book because Blue Duck is a cold blooded killer.  He would have gutted Newt like he does everyone.  In the book - Blue Duck causes a stampede and that gets Newt caught away from watching Lorena - and that is when Blue Duck steals her.<br />3) The horrible men that Jake Spoon falls in with - they kill just a few more people in the book.<br />4) Roscoe has a few more bumbling adventures including meeting a frisky widower farm girl... kinda creepy, and the scene with the bandits on the road and Janey throwing rocks is way different in the book with a different outcome.  Sheriff Johnson does come save the day - but he arrests the men and puts them in jail.<br /><br />That's the major stuff that I can think of.  Everything else is really close.  Excellent movie.  5 Stars.
B00A2H9PLG|1.0|About 20 minutes into White House Down, I found myself silently praying for our DVD player to explode into flames ala one of the many \\"wow look at that thing that got blowed up real good!\\" scenes in this movie. An off-duty Capitol policeman and a President who can fight, shoot, and kill like a trained Navy SEAL team up to save the country from terrorists. The \\"plot\\" is a convoluted mess that barely makes sense. The \\"movie\\" takes itself oh so seriously it is almost laughable...almost. And the \\"acting\\" - where to start? I didn't expect much from Channing Tatum, so I wasn't disappointed on that front. But both Maggie Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx are very disappointing. Do yourself a favor and just take a 131 minute nap instead of sitting through this tripe.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|Good movie with an edge of the chair excitement all through the movie. Good for the people with an imagination
B00C2C637I|3.0|There is no doubt that Ray Bradbury was an extrememly gifted author.  Several of his books (this one included) will always be classics - and will be required reading in many high schools for years to come.  My problem with this book is that it takes a long time to get into.  Very little happens for the whole first half of the book.  It's just slow.  The time spent is not entirely wasted though, because even when Bradbury says nothing, he does it in a beautiful way.  Much of this book reads almost like poetry.<br />The second half of the book is much better than the first, and although the eventual battle between good and evil is a bit cheesy, Bradbuy delivers it with such conviction and complexity that I can't deny his genius.<br />&#34;Something Wicked This Way Comes&#34; is the most beautifuly written, but average book I've ever read.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|This film is a great adventure movie with a family theme.  GREAT MOVIE I recommend all with immagination to see it
B006O5YI7G|4.0|I enjoy reading about the Hole in the wall gang.  And although Butch, was a robber and a thief, it was great to see an exciting and changed person ending to his life.
B00881VLCE|3.0|nice virtual way to put a jigsaw puzzle together but on my 7 inch screen, the size of the pieces is very small
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|Starts off with a nicely paced action-film-style set-up, but then deteriorates into a depressing, drawn-out story of alcohol addiction that seems all too familiar. Denzel does his usual, workman-like job trying to put some life into the second half of this story, but the plodding, obvious plot drags him down. If I had paid to see this in a theater, I would have been terribly disappointed. Seeing it with Prime (no extra fee), made it seem like only a waste of my time.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Keeps me hooked until I run out of lives. Then I quit because I won't. pay for anymore for a free app. Had to go on line at first to find out what jellies were. No directions.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Outstanding story plot! Special effects are awesome! This movie is for any trekker! I highly recommend this movie!! We have watched it several times since we bought it.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Action packed superhero saga. Good special effects. Good performance by R.D. in particular. Seems that they may have had some difficulty squeezing time in for all of the featured heros so that came across as a bit forced. Nevertheless, very entertertaining if you're into this genre.
0307888681|5.0|Outstanding movie!! What a twist! Action packed from the first 5 minutes!! Not your average Zombie movie and keeps you on the edge of your seat!
0307593312|4.0|This was hard to choose how many stars for.  Because &#34;It's okay&#34; fits, but so does &#34;I like it,&#34; and sometimes &#34;I love it.&#34;  If you like Murakami's other stuff, this is not quite the same.  But I really enjoyed it for what it was.  A lot.  Reminded me kinda of those pop &#34;urban-paranormal&#34; paperbacks about mercenaries and stuff, but in my humble opinion that isn't NECESSARILY a bad thing.  Try it and see.  Maybe try borrowing it from your library and then if you like it you buy a copy and support him.  That's all.
B004LWZW8I|5.0|Great movie. Special effects are great. Story is good. Action packed. We have watched it several times since we bought it.
B00ESNE696|5.0|Love this series and it was really heating up missed this episode on TV and was so glad I could catch on Amazon.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love finding hidden objects when I have a couple minutes to waste. This app works great for that purpose.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love these games just because they let time go past and each game is fun. Also, you get to master the games! Reccomended!
B00FSBW2L6|5.0|Well, he's done it again! Christoph Fisher has taken us into the inner recesses of his character's minds as they grapple with a culture turned inside out and emptied like a pants' pocket. There is intrigue, betrayal,love and hate...even a servant who poisons her employer. It seems that brutal times exact brutality from some people, but there is always the possibility of reconciliation and redemption. I thoroughly enjoyed this last book of the trilogy.
B00005O3VC|5.0|its a classic, what else can I say!!! it is still funny as heck as it was when I was a teenager
B003G4W49C|5.0|Intriguing  story. I enjoyed reading the book very much. I got the book after seeing the movie previews on TV. I usually prefer to read the book after the movie because  most movies are loosely based on the books.
0767903811|4.0|Funny!  Very well written.  My book group selection and everyone in the group loved it and thought it was well written and very insightful and well written.
0394826817|5.0|I had this book when I was growing up and loved it. My mother was a school teacher back then, so she thoughtlessly gave away all of my favorite books to the less fortunate kids in her classroom. She's lucky it's still in print, and so is my son. It is a great book 40 years later. Good manners and thoughtful behavior are modeled by Richard Scarry's silly animal characters in a genuinely funny way that will even have adults laughing. There are so many interesting details on every page that it keeps my son interested, too. I would've paid more than the $3.59 they're selling it for.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As always an excellent read by John Grisham.<br /> The connection to the past was well prepared and  as always a plot to the end.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Best red hot chili peppers album ever!  I for this album when it first came out and I used it and abused it. I still have a copy of it in my computer but I enjoy buying cds. anyway I really needed to replace My last copy so here I am.  But really one of the best albums I own
B005PK56TA|5.0|The first season was amazing. I watched all episodes in two days. All performances were incredible and the story was just so good I wanted more. Didn't know much about Connie Britton, but she is really a good actress. Jessica Lange is such a great actress and born to play these dark, evil roles with class, wit and subtlety. Highly recommend season one of AHS.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Good app.  Does what it says.  The installation process seems a little convoluted, but maybe it is that way for all apps.  I am generally not an app purchaser.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|extremely funny great family movie.Watch it.it is well worth the money you will spend on it.<br />Best holsome movie I have seen in years.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|my opinion is that I love it and very happy that I got it i'm on level 108 my cavities gsme
B004NBZG06|4.0|I think this is my favorite Heyer book so far. Of course the heroine is a pure young virgin, though she is fun and sympathetic. But it's the hero who's... oh, so likeable. Funny, and warm, and polite, and popular, and not in the least arrogant. In fact, he's commonly thought a bit stupid, and his father often mocks him -- affectionately, though.
B00E8S2JZ4|3.0|Overall I really enjoyed the movies, but I have two serious issues. First, the Goblins were not AT ALL what I pictured when reading the books, they also aren't even any sort of \\"throwback\\" to the Goblins in the classic old animated film \\"The Hobbit\\"...(Down Down to Goblin Town anyone??) I was really looking forward to this scene, as it is such a dark and unnerving turn in the book. I was so upset with the stupid humor and ridiculous portrayals of these guys. This film made it into a joke scene...literally! (\\"That'll do it...\\"???) I feel it really ruined what could have been an amazing part of the film, and it was an insult to the spirit of the Goblins in the book.<br /><br />Secondly...the Trolls. Here is another classic scene from Tolkien royally destroyed in this film. Once again, the overplay of \\"stupid\\" humor...the booger joke, for example...was absolutely insulting to the viewer. Perhaps lowbrow children will laugh during the scene, but for a true fan this was huge disappointment.<br /><br />I so wish these scenes could be chopped and thrown out. They need to be treated with respect and completely redone. Obviously that will never happen, and so for me this version of the film will NEVER be the definitive version. I will be patiently waiting for another director to redo these films in 50 years down the road, and treat them seriously and with respect. No more Jar Jars.
B00CHVJI08|5.0|Such a good family movie.  The stuffed toy that came with it is so cute. We really loved this movie.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I have a terrible habit of skimming through books, but did not do that with this one. Loved every page of it. Thought about it long after I finished. Have recommended to friends which I am usually avoid doing since my friends have such varied tastes. I know that they will all get something out of this book.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Loved the story, hated the profanity. I don't understand the need to use profanity at all.  Most of it was in the beginning.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Interesting story. It was good except the end, I dont think it really made sense but I liked the story
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Surprisingly good movie; I was expecting more of an action film vs. the drama that it was.  Music and details were excellent.  It lagged a little in the latter half, thus not a five.  I think you will like it if you know what you are getting.  As I said, I was pleasantly surprised.
B00CPTUNBK|4.0|It was enticing I liked it very much. (Spoiler) A few errors if you check out cinema Sins on youtube.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I read the books, and collected them...and now this movie completes my movie collection.  I enjoyed the direction, cinematography, and special effects.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|hardley any adds and so fun and addictive. I cant believe how fun it is. got it as faotd but its worth money
B0067AC5KA|4.0|A bit slow. But twisty enough to keep it interesting. Good character depth. Very convenient in the kindle ebook format.
B003JHKORK|5.0|My four kids, husband, & I, love the Percy Jackson series!  Great adventure and very captivating. Fun for the whole family'
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game.  Highly recommend.  I play it everyday.  I haven't spent any money on the game if your patient and learn the game you can enjoy it without having to spend money.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I have read other Reacher Novels and have enjoyed them but t his one was far more intriguing. It kept me guessing until the end.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|Do yourself a favor? If you haven't seen this movie, stream it on Netflix or buy it, rent it etc. It is playing right now on HBO too. You won't be sorry. One of the best movies I have ever seen!!! Based on a true story, it was nothing short of amazing and beautiful. I love everything about surfing and I was just amazed. Enjoy as I cannot say enough about Chasing Mavericks.
B00902AKK4|5.0|I enjoy playing this game and it makes you use your brain. This is worth the time it takes to play.
1400034205|5.0|This is the first book I've read of Maugham's and I'm glad I ventured into the 20th century when it comes to classical literature, but something drew me to this book.<br /><br />The first couple of chapters were hard to get through because there were very lengthy descriptions of the characters and each chapter seemed to reinforce what was already mentioned in the previous chapters, but it pays to be patient because the story that ensues is very compelling.<br /><br />It was told as if the author knew all of the characters personally and at first it seemed possible but at the end, highly unlikely.  Maugham, as himself, and due to the nature of his work, had a lot of time to relate to people on a personal level but his intimate relationships with a group of much younger people was what stood out for me.  He treated each character with respect and value for their own personal journey but his involvement as an older confidante was somewhat bizarre.  But that's what made the book so great.  He was able to retell a very interesting slice of history of the lives of a small group of people after having gotten everybody's story either by living it with them or hearing about it afterwards.  The author's involvement as a character showing up at the right times was unique and quite outrageous to the point of making a serious story slightly humorous.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed hearing about Larry's spiritual journey that he had the courage (and money) to make due to his perception of life as it should be, having been shattered during WWI.  And the love relationships when told through the eyes of a male author are always a little more interesting to say the least.  All in all, a fanatastic book!
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Very good book overall.  It starts off a bit slow but definitely picks up about half way through it.  It is written well and will make you think.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This is a quirky, fast moving mystery set in a small mountain village.  It is part science fiction  and<br />part fantasy.  But it is so exciting that often I was exhausted when I finished reading.<br />It is a fast read and really fun.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This was a very fun book to read.  This is the 1st time I've read this author and he does a great job of creating very detailied characters and uses lots of imagery in the story.  Great plot overall
B001BANK32|5.0|This is my first Stephen King book and I'm totally engrossed in every page. What a chilling and ingenious read this is!
B00DVKOYBM|2.0|To hard to play and not very entertaining.  Does not play like a game of true 8 ball.  Thanks anyway.
1585429155|5.0|It's a simple, yet powerful description of how to think about any challenge that life brings your way.  It's basically a great tool for structuring your thought process to resolve any problem or to raise your level of personal expectations.  Whether it's an issue of relationships, health, wealth, career or struggles with conflict in any field of endeavor, the author lays out a methodology for understanding and addressing these issues.  It recognizes the power of our minds to create chaos or harmony in everything that we do. When studied in connection with others who help clarify and explain human motivation and its end product, it provides a framework for understanding all the elements that govern our lives.  The authors life appears to have been spent in working with others to help them come to grips with simple things like being to work on time, having good experiences in your place of work, advancing your career with minimal conflict, determining what direction you want to go and how to get there, bringing the right people into your life when you want them and where you want them, minimizing and even eliminating problems of poor health, poverty, dissatisfaction, distrust, insecurity, fear, loneliness. It provides a prescription for progress that would likely elevate the performance of our leaders in politics, education, business, government and religion to a new level of cultural peace and prosperity.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|Disappointed. I've considered Dave Eggers a literary genius since &#34;a heartbreaking work of staggering genius&#34; but this felt like a different author. Great plot but flat footed writing. I found the lead character, Mae, unsympathetic. Come to think of it, I didn't care about anybody. There were no surprises as to who were the bad guys only a slow wait to find out how bad it would get. Still love ya, Dave. Waiting for the next one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|HONESTLY, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D LIKE A MOVIE WITH ZOMBIES, BUT IT'S HAD ME ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT  FROM THE FIRST 10 MINUTES.
B002TLSSXO|4.0|These are great, and the ability to stay off the counter is an added bonus.  However, while the grey portion is heat resistant, the colored portion will melt if set against a pan.  Trust me, we have little divets in all the spatulas.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it me and my four year old daughter love playing this game together we play it everyday and absolutely love it
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great mystery with its twists and turns.<br />  Highly reccommend this book.  Many topics to discuss in reading groups or among friends.
B0017APPSE|4.0|Despite the differences between this adaptation and the truth story, plus the film criticism it received, I think it is a good film! The acting, costumes and landscapes are great! As a big fan of period dramas I really enjoy this one!!! :) Love all the extras!! :)
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It had everything that a good love story needs.I do wish she would have gone further into their new married life together.
B000I3UMKM|5.0|Although it wasn't quite what I expected as a 50 yo man, but my ten year old daughter loved it so thus the super high rating. The complicated Holly Golightly reminded me of a few women I know.
B009IF6U98|4.0|Streaking. Worth watching the entire thing just for that scene. And, Will Farrells awful singing &#34;Dust in the WInd&#34;. If you like Animal House-this is your kind of movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son love it. This enhanced your imagination in creating your own world. This is a good practice if you want to be an Engineer.
B002ZHKZCY|4.0|An incredible story beautifully told.  Acting is excellent.  Couldn't find a fault.  All of the players are terrific.  Joan Allen is a treasure.
0385537131|4.0|It can not be denied that this is an enjoyable book.  I enjoyed the characters a great deal and the story was interesting.  The only two problems I had with it were that it dragged a bit in the middle and the ending was a bit pat.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I prefer amazon mp3 purchases over iTunes any day.  The MP3's I buy always transfer from one phone or multiple devises without any problems.  I like playing my music on the player while on walks etc.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This book had just the kind of satisfying ending that I love.  Many of us don't need total reality when we simply want to be entertained.  The characters were well-developed, and the dialog was natural.  So much fun.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|I simply could not put this book down.  It has such an interesting approach to such a heartbreaking affliction.  I LOVED it.
B00G722X9Q|5.0|Love LOve LOVe LOVE it! Can't stop listening to the whole album since I got it! Definitely a must have and NOT a disapointment! Such a great album from these boys.
B009GJ870Q|5.0|Couldn't stop reading till the last page. Brilliant! I recommend it to everyone who like to read about honour, devotion, respect and loyalty.
B000YJ6736|3.0|I gave this 3 stars only because Mcewan always leaves his readers with a haunting story of &#34;what might have been&#34;--I expect to be a bit depressed and he rarely disappoints.  Guess the rating should be higher because he accomplishes his story well, but I always wish I hadn't read him.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|One of the Greatest Stories ever told..... I started watching the Godfather movies when I was a young teen, I must have watched it 20 times before I read the book, once I read that book the movie became even better, because the book gave insights into the characters that I never knew before.... Puzo at his best!!!
081099741X|5.0|Excellent book! If you love Wes, or you know someone who does, get this book. Do not be a fool  and get the Kindle edition. This book is worth getting in hardcover. It's huge! The pictures are huge! There's so much information! It's like a Wes Anderson film. It's enjoyable again and again. And every experience is a little different.
B002RZZIXU|3.0|The story isn't gripping at all and was somewhat disjointed. It's readable but not really one that I would recommend.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Awesome and inspiring book. Well written and definitely captures and holds your attention start to finish. A definite must read.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|This movie was not for me. I guess I'm too much of a fan of the original. The back drop of modern music against a classic movie annoyed me and the incessant usage of \\"old sport\\" got on my nerves. I purchased this through instant video HD for TV viewing and as soon as the movie started it declared that it was too much bandwith so it reloaded in SD. All around disappointed that I wasted my time and money renting this movie.
0321934318|5.0|The book gives clear, comprehensive step-by-step instructions with screen-shots on using the many features of Lightroom 5.  The author offers alternative ways to take advantage of many of the features and explains why he prefers one way over another.  The book is structured in sections according to the different areas of Lightroom use (e,g,, organizing photos, enhancing photos, etc.) so it's very easy to find a specific feature that you need to be explained, and each section concludes with a page of two of helpful and interesting &#34;Lightroom Killer Tips.&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great stress reliever. Easy to play even my 5 year old can do it.  All my friends are into it too.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|much better than Stelone's movie. Some attention given to plot in this one and very good special effects. Some decent acting too, what a surprise!
B00C6BB2JE|5.0|If you love classic monster movies, like/love Hugh Jackman, you will most likely like this movie that has Hugh, The Wolfman, Frankenstein, and Dracula in it. Me, I have seen this movie so many times that I had to get this copy of it because I wore the other one out.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Not that impressed! I do not think I really liked the way the book was written..that is it I guess!!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Just like other yummy things in my life (cheese popcorn, mini chocolate bars and good books) I can't stop with just a taste.  I save Good Wife watching to empty Saturdays.  It is impossible to watch just one.  The writers have created the most delightfully human characters-neither all good, nor all bad.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Though a gripping tale with overlapping and intertwining lives, some of the action in Brazil seemed to contain more minute details than necessary to tell the story. However, having thoroughly enjoyed my first Preston/Child novel, I am most anxious to move on to the next!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging but not so difficult that you want to quit. Fun game!!!<br />Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good fun challenge.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I loved the story, the author clearly stated he wanted to write a book around the battle room idea and that is where the book definitely focuses most of the energy. I would otherwise have provided a solid 5 stars.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE IT.<br /><br />I ENJOY PLAYING IT.  SEEING HOW MY FRIENDS ARE DOING.  HELPING THEM AND THEM HELPING ME TO CONTINUING PLAING THE GAME.
B00ESJICMC|5.0|This album is one of my favorites this year, It is very real and hits home. His voice is so calm and perfect, he can be relaxing and than he can also hit the high notes when he does. The instrumentals on the tracks are well made too, you hear his voice perfect and also the instrumental so one does not over power another. I recommend this CD.<br />P.S. The CD is mostly about love. (the good and bad)
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Fun, but overall it was lacking in plot. Even when compared to other action movies. I felt that some more info on the female lead would have made her actions more believable at times.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Linkin is a great this is the best think to get infromation about jobs .great place to find a job and if you are a employer you can find people you need to fit the in your company
B007IK44CK|5.0|Great adventure, keeps you on your seat, Tom Cruise is really a great actor in this movie, I would recommend seeing it again to catch missed parts in the movie.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|This book has been in circulation for many years in many languages. I've been a big fan of this book since I was a child. I as in the stage play. To read was this girl went through in hiding is just fascinating. Sad that they were caught. At least we get to see the writing skills of this young girl who's life was taken way too soon.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy set up. Pretty reliable. No lag on streaming. No problems with is at all. I recommend this for anyone. Price can't be beat!
B00F6Y3FKW|4.0|Yes, he did record a bunch of sub-par albums, but these more than 40 hours of songcraft also contain some of the greatest rock music ever recorded. I just docked this a notch for the \\"Side Tracks\\" collection, which could be more complete. Why no \\"Rita May\\" (arguably one of Bob's great Dylan non-LP songs)? Also missing are the band version of \\"George Jackson\\" and the killer live version of \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\" (all recorded for Columbia as single B-sides, so they should be easily available to the compilers). There is also a great version of Willie Nelson's \\"Angels Flying Too Close to the Ground\\" that must have been on a single somewhere.<br />Considering the massive greatness at hand, these are minor quibbles, but still...
B005KITK6C|5.0|Another well made item from a dependable company. Very real looking when item is completed. Colorful and fun  for all ages.
B00364K6YW|4.0|Love P&P, love Colin Firth, and love Jennifer Ehle. Terribly and pleasantly surprised to see Lucy Davis. Overall a wonderful rendition. I can absolutely see why it is considered the first truly successful screen adaptation of P&P. However, there are small issues that keep me from giving a perfect 5-star rating. For example, Jane Bennet is supposed to be clearly and obviously the most traditionally beautiful of the Bennet girls. However, Jennifer Ehle is equally if not more beautiful, confusing that issue. Furthermore, I was not happy with the sermonizing voiceover at the end of the series. It renders the successes of Elizabeth/Darcy and Jane/Bingley as one-dimensional examples of a moral on what proper marriage is. It would have been far better to let their happiness stand on their own instead of proselytizing on the evils that marriage is meant to prevent.
B006DPXFVM|3.0|The sound field would not decode correctly with PS3 running the Amazon app.  First time it has happened.  Had to use normal stereo output while watching the movie in HD.  Feeling a little taken since I paid for the more expensive one to get the HD AND 5.1 sound.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I've heard it said that it's just not possible to condense Pride and Prejudice into a 2 hour format. This absolutely proves that wrong. It takes the one thing that's essential to Pride and Prejudice, the story of Elizabeth and Darcy, and sticks to that. Certain creative liberties are taken, deviating from some of the expansive scenes in the novel, but in doing so the spirit of the novel is preserved. What takes chapters of text can be condensed into a few minutes of screen time. I wouldn't suggest watching this if you're trying to dodge reading the book for English class, but as a portrait of the spirit of the book it's a first-rate piece.
B00ENYCQX8|4.0|Works great I get all my epubs on there fine crashed on me once but I just downloaded 15 books so over all pretty good
B00164KYV4|2.0|I love romantic comedies, and this style in particular. But most of the relationships seemed either excessively superficial and more than a little whiny. But what devastates the rating was the Jennifer Aniston storyline. Spoiler alert, but it's important to understanding why this movie is not good. That relationship has been going on for years and is fine, except that she wants to get married at some point, and he doesn't see the point in marriage. This turns into a big conflict and they break up over it. Here's the part that gets me: Jennifer Aniston's character comes back telling herself that she's actually okay with staying with the guy and not getting married even though it's what she wants. She gives up the thing that she wants for this guy. Yes, it's true that afterward he proposes, but it doesn't change the how incredibly selfish he is. She cares about getting married and he doesn't care. If he doesn't care, why can he not just go through with it since it matters to her? A refusal to do something your partner cares about when you don't care is nothing but selfish. And this movie tries to romanticize that. Dreck and drivel.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is very addictive.  I'm a little amazed that I have spent so much time on this! And even more amazing is how much money I have spent! ! I never thought I would do this!
B001DUDKEY|5.0|This is a simple and beautiful adaptation of a lovely story.  The soundtrack is very pretty and Ciaran Hinds is well worth watching!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Fun game based off the video, if a bit morbid. My younger sister and I love playing it whenever we have free time
0920668372|5.0|A beautiful book that softens the heart. A magical story about life, death, and loving. My family treasures this book. We used it when grandparents passed away to celebrate the gift of life and its cycle of death and birth.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I got this since many of my teachers gave us online material and I would prefer not to waste paper by printing it all, so I would load it to my kindle. The reader is very easy to navigate and allows for note and highliting which helps for when I have to study the material later on.
B008Y768XO|5.0|So cute! My two girls 6 and 7 loved it and watched the entire movie. Great for the whole family!
B00499NHLC|5.0|In my opinion this show was an excellent adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's work. It stayed true to form, while updating and contextualizing the story for modern day. Appreciate the action and drama seasons, especially with the parts where the visual attempts to show how Sherlock's mind is working.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Awesome series can't wait for season 4 to come out. Hope they take out the governor in season 4 he is such a douche
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Collect sick beasts by chasing them in a neat jeep, take them back to rescue park, then release them after breeding them twice. Not just normal animals but dinosaurs also. The cross breeding is coo also. We like it.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Em is the best that's ever done it. This album murders. A throwback feel, with modern hip hop greatness. The Joe Walsh sampled track kicked my @$$. Lots of classic samples and a level of skill only Marshall can bring.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome it is so much better than temple run. I like how there is an update and we change to different places/events. My favorite would be the Halloween theme. PLAY SUBWAY SURFERS IT IS AWESOMR
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|While not extremely difficult, an entertaining experience that made me wish for more to do.  I do like the production values of this game and the &quot;soundtrack&quot; seemed apropos. Would recommend for sure though a bit pricey to me unless updates are included.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|If you love action you have to get this app, because it is full of action. You can jump off cliffs with ski' s. And its very cheap for a thrilling ride.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|So far I haven't been able to fully activate the device.<br />The problem is my Windows operating system,<br />which is the XPS era. I will have to find a way to<br />integrate the Chromecast HDMI set-up with the<br />XPS arrangement, which I hope will be possible.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I would have given this app a 5 star if it did not give me to many problems when there is an update. Also I cant just log in to my facebook account. I have to shut down the tablet and turn it back on, in order to be log into my facebook account. I dont know why it does that. Other than those problems I do love everything about this app.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is an Excellent show! Deftly done and performed by the cast with great storylines. The praises for this show are well founded.
B00G7QPTR0|5.0|I have seen the life but a dream documentary and I love it. She was so real and honest about who she is. And I loved how she showed you clips about her husband and blue ivy its so adorable . I'm excited to see the concert part even though I've been to the Mrs.Carter Show and it so awesome definitely worth your money so I know the concert on the DVD is awesome I can't wait until it arrives
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun, addicting, and challenging.  The developer encourages $.99 purchases for tools to help advance to the next level.  Be careful if your kids have access - you could run up some unexpected charges.
B003F3FJQO|3.0|It is not as good as the first book in the series but still just good enough to make me go on to the next one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is great but how do u use realms now that its available? if someone knows then plz tell me! in ur review :),
B003DDKAT2|5.0|Most elegant vampire movie ever seen. Melancholy, aloof and proud Lestat is perfectly presented by Tom. Must see it again.
B005GI26PS|2.0|Most of words are included, but the automated search function is not working at all (even if the word is there, but the ending is different - it won't find it).
B00BAXFECK|1.0|I cannot understand what anyone sees in this book. I read it halfway through and when I saw that even as an adult the \\"hero\\" was just as nasty as ever, reconnected with the Russian hooligan and even betrayed Hobie, the man who had taken him in and treated him so kindly, I started skimming. Never figured out the end. Is this supposed to show what American youth are like today? Heaven forbid! And I thought I was going to be reading an interesting art mystery featuring a painting I love.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Cute game, easy to play, and addictive once you get the hang of it. And for a free game, that's a big deal. Even toddlers like it, or at least, they like to watch.
B00FAJI116|5.0|Broadchurch is a slow-moving British episodic (8) crime thriller starring the great David Tennant in a very NOT Dr. Who role - which is how most Americans know him.  The mystery of who murdered a young child in a small English town moves, twists, and overlaps as secrets are revealed like peeling layers from an onion.  The murderer was actually a big surprise to me and the final scenes are heart-wrenching for a mother.  Go, watch, enjoy.
B001BANK32|5.0|King is a masterful storyteller. I couldn't put this down, again. It's thoughtful horror, smart horror, so horrific because it's almost believable. Movie first or book first- doesn't matter, they each stand on their own.
B007JRUCGO|5.0|I chose 5 stars because my little great nephew loves the first one and he liked this one just as much.  When he's watching it he's so engrossed we call it Happy Feet Haze!  Adorable movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I'm used to playing solitaire from my teen years. It's a great mind stimulator, and a good way to pass the time relaxing.
0061906220|5.0|My 4 year old son loves Pete. Me too :-) We have 3 other books written by Eric Litwin. They are all great!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|A conveniently quick and accurate way to perform mathimatical solutions when needed. I find it useful when ordering,  or checking answers.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This was supposed to be the exciting end to a great series, but the book was slow-paced, dull, and a complete downer from cover to cover. What a disappointment.
B00FX8EY60|1.0|Song cuts off prematurely. Not sure if this is AmozonMP3 or song issue.<br />Download of a different song went normally.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I pretty much hated this book. So much of it felt tacked on, like the author had to write SOMETHING to finish it up. But THIS is what she came up with? It bore little relationship to the first 2 books of the trilogy, which I really enjoyed. I was irritated from the beginning, but my irritation really began to blossom with the introduction of Amar. Never mentioned in the prior 2 book, it's just almost casually mentioned: \\"Oh, he's the one that gave Four his name.\\" WHAT? That's pretty significant, and it's clearly something she tacked on and never even thought of in the first 2 books. Veronica Roth, if you read this, I want to say: Go back and try it again. This was just terrible. And its terrible-ness has nothing to with the death of an important character.
1592332803|4.0|The Joy of Vegan Baking was my first experience with Vegan Baking ever! Back in 2009 I was looking to change my diet and lifestyle, at the time I wasn’t even vegetarian though I had experimented with vegetarianism over the years, I knew eventually I wanted to head back in that directions for good. I wasn’t very familiar with the term vegan then, didn’t know anything about vegan cooking, but I found this book in the vegetarian cooking section of my local library and decided to give it a shot. In those days I had no idea that you could bake - and bake successfully - without butter, milk, and eggs. I borrowed this book several times from the library, and after finally going Vegan for good in 2010 my husband bought me this book for Christmas. I loved it then, and though I do not use it as much these days I still love it. This book is nostalgic for me, ti was my first introduction into vegan baking and I’ll always be grateful for what I learned from it.<br /><br />Learning is the one thing that I think everyone can take away from any of Colleen’s books. She’s such a fantastic educator and it comes through in her work. This book is loaded with useful information on vegan baking, etymology, the history of baking and certain baked goods and just general tips on troubleshooting. I very much appreciate the time and care she took in crafting these recipes as well as the book as a whole, this book is truly invaluable to the novice vegan baker.<br /><br />Other things I love about this book is it’s layout. Very lovely, very clean and simple. The instructions are easy to follow, the font is easy to read, and there isn’t any clutter. I love the photography, the food looks gorgeous and really inspires one to bake! Not to mention the photos are plentiful which I love. I’ve made several recipes from this book - quite a few are go-to recipes for me - with great success. Each recipe I’ve tried has been great, except for the lemon bars but I’m inclined to think that this was my own fault, not Colleen’s as I was distracted while baking and have never been particularly good with treats that need to set.<br /><br />Some things you may wish to consider before purchasing this book is that there is no nutritional information given. This is a deal-breaker for a lot of people. This book also uses vegan margarine - or Earth Balance - sugar, white flour, and other ingredients that the health community demonizes. There are a lot of complaints about this I notice but one thing to keep in mind is that Colleen didn’t write this as a health book, it’s not labeled a healthy dessert book. The subtitle of the book is “The Compassionate Cooks Traditional Treats and Sinful Sweets” Sinful = decadent so right off you should know that these are going to be sometimes foods not every day foods. Not to mention the fact that you’re making dessert, now I don’t bake every day or even weekly but when I do I know that I’m baking with the intention of satisfying my palate and a particular craving. I don’t care about making healthy brownies, I just care about brownies. That’s not to say I don’t like a good healthful treat now and then too, but if sugar-free, whole grain flour desserts are what you’re looking for then this is not the book for you. This is also not the book for you if you’re looking for loads of creativity by which I mean if you’re looking for ‘hipster’ or ‘foodie’ deserts to impress your snobby friends this isn’t your book. These are simple desserts, veganized versions of the food we all grew up with. The kind of dessert you can bring to your family’s Christmas party or Thanksgiving dinner and not be gawked at. You can feed this pumpkin pie to your grandma and she’ll love it, and never know it’s vegan. That’s what this book is about.<br /><br />This is the perfect book for novice vegan bakers, and newbie vegans. It’s also great for long-time vegans and seasoned vegans who just want something simple and fast to satisfy their sweet tooth. As I’ve said I’ve made several of the recipes, and this is what I thought of them.<br /><br />Banana Chocolate Chip Muffins - Loved it!<br />Blueberry Lemon Muffins - Loved it!<br />Apple Pecan Muffins - Loved it!<br />Classic Currant Scones - Loved it!<br />Mediterranean Olive Bread - Pretty good!<br />Irish Soda Bread - Loved it! - My go-to for St. Patrick’s Day Celebrations<br />Fig Date Bread - Loved it<br />Pumpkin Spice Bread - Loved it<br />Pancakes - Loved it<br />Chocolate Cake - Loved it<br />German Apple Cake - Loved it, definitely a favorite and it’s not too sweet!<br />Blueberry Cake - Absolutely Loved it, a definite favorite<br />Blueberry Orange Bundt Cake - Pretty good<br />Cinnamon Coffee Cake - Loved it<br />Chocolate Peanut Butter Cupcakes - Loved it<br />Lemon Cheesecake - Pretty good<br />No Bake Strawberry Pie with Chocolate Chunks - Loved it<br />Apple Pie - Loved it, perfection<br />Peach Pie - Loved it, perfection<br />Pumpkin Pie - Loved it, one of my favorite and ‘go-to’ pumpkin pies<br />No Bake Chocolate Pudding Tart - Loved it<br />Chocolate Chip Cookies - Loved it - a ‘go to’ recipe when baking for Omni friends<br />Chocolate Chip Mint Cookies - Loved it<br />Peanut Butter Cookies - Loved it - a ‘go-to’ recipe when baking for omni friends<br />Sugar Cookies - Loved it<br />Oatmeal Raisin Cookies - Loved it - a ‘go-to’ recipe when baking for omni friends<br />Raspberry Oatmeal Bars - Pretty good<br />Lemon Bars - Disaster but probably my own fault<br />Apple Crumble - Loved it<br />Bananas in Sweet Coconut Milk - Loved it<br />Applesauce - Loved it<br />Chocolate Mousse - Loved it - a ‘go-to’ dessert when I have omni’s over<br />Graham Cracker Crust - Loved it<br />Pecan Crust - Loved it, a definite favorite<br />Flaky Pie Crust - Loved it - A definite ‘go-to’ pie crust for me.<br />No Bake Pecan Crust - Loved it<br />Brownie Crust - Loved it<br />Buttercream Frosting - Loved it<br />Chocolate Peanut Butter Frosting - Loved it<br />Raspberry Sauce - Loved it - a definite favorite<br />Cashew Cream - Loved it<br /><br />Unfortunately I have not been able to make all the recipes from this book that I would like, but I have made quite a few, and most of these desserts I’ve made for family gatherings or friends parties. In each case they were gobbled up by unsuspecting omnivores who raved continuously about my desserts while regular non-vegan desserts were left untouched. There is no better affirmation then that, and so I would really recommend this book to the novice baker, or any vegan who has picky family members that they need to please.
B00EKR61FM|5.0|Great product.  Haven't opened up because it's a Christmas gift.  Looking forward to having a Twilight marathan again and looking at the new stuff.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Addictive, yet works out your brain.  Develops logical thinking.  I downloaded this game so that I had something to do on the airplane  (other than sudoku) while on a work trip and it made time fly by fast.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book allows us a rare look at the scary and the sublime in the form of Steve Jobs. I read it twice and I'll never forget it.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|This is the Stryper we all loved from the 80's and 90's. This music is great. You have to hear &#34;Saved by Love.&#34; Michael's voice is as clean as ever, but on this track he intentionally roughens things up. I could almost hear the pieces of his throat flying out of the speakers. Wow! It reminded me of Lennon's Twist & Shout vocals. Just leaving it all out there. I can't imagine he recorded anything else for the next couple of days. Get this. I liked Reborn and Murder by Pride was good, but I've been playing this one almost non-stop.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I loved the first two books but I absolutely hated the third book such a disappointment at one point I just wanted to throw the book across the room. That is why I can not give this book 5 stars Mocking Jay was terrible. Why was Katness such a wimp in the final book I hate what the author did to the  character.
B00BGDQNLU|5.0|This movie is so great!  It's funny and clever.  I am so glad they put it out on blu-ray this year!  I tried to buy it last year and ended up with a crappy library copy.  SO happy to have this, it's for a gift for the person I bought the library copy.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Everything that needs to be said has already been said by many reviewers on here. Believe the hype: this is not simply one of Eminem's best work. It IS his best work. MMLP2 really took me off guard considering his hit and miss output over the last 10 years. There's not one stinker on the entire album. He has grown as an artist into a ferocious beast on the mic. Nobody does rhyming better among his contemporaries. He's right on when he calls himself a &#34;rap god&#34;, before stringing together a breathtaking lightning bolt of a song. Amazing stuff here. The highlight for me is &#34;Headlights&#34;, a tune in which he collaborates with Nate Ruess of fun. He makes peace with his momma, and it gives me goose bumps. I've grown up with Em, and hearing his heartfelt confession after the invective he's directed her way over the years makes it that much more powerful.<br /><br />This is a must have for any Eminem or hip-hop fan. Best album of the year by a longshot!
B000063V8R|4.0|Fascinating plots that explore important questions.<br />Awesome ensemble acting!<br />It's interesting to watch the actors and writers develop the characters.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Simply wonderful! I had the feeling that I was listening to a five year old, then a nine year old and then a young teenage boy. The author discribed the undiscribable in a way that made me empathise but avoided all pathos. I truly enjoyed this book!
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Zack Snyder brings the action. Some of the fight sequences are really intense. Snyder's camera work is kinetic and immersive. When Superman fights Faora and that big guy on main street the punches are seriously thrown. Not since James Cameron have i seen action done so well. The score by Hans Zimmer is heavy and ominous, one of his best.<br />Addressing the issue of so-called \\"fans\\" expressing \\"internet\\" anger over Superman allowing and causing so much collateral damage. Comic book fans are angry little idiots who like to whine about a character created, what? 80 years ago? And has gone through so many incarnations its hard to tell who Superman (the person) is at all. They wanted the 1933 Superman in red shorts,saving cats from trees or the 80's Superman getting married in Niagara falls. Im glad Zack ignored them and did his thing.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love it.<br />That's all! Just a very good game with different choices of foods that your customers can eat. I just thin  that this game us the best &quot;story&quot; games.
B009HSPODE|4.0|Interesting writing, though settings are always the same. I like the short<br />story format, and they are not too short
B000RZIGVS|1.0|Bad Disc's,<br /><br />Many of the dvd's are unplayable. Either scratched or pitted. What a waste of money!!! They also feeze playbackduring.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|Loved it! Watched with our 2 1/2 year old and truly enjoyed it!  Excellent to download and watch on the go
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Loved it! Kept me on the edge of my seat! Glad I finally found this movie on Amazon! Going to have to watch it again.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|Great product. The dinosaur display is really cool, and not a crappy plastic. Not cheesy either! the movies are great quality, the other comments were not accurate for my experience. Looks better than when we say the new remastered JP in theaters this year.<br />My fiancé absolutely loved it, he is a huge JP fan!
B00B9366VO|4.0|A very nostalgic trip back into the Glory-days a rock 'n roll. A recommended document for any true rock 'n roll fan!
B00DTGSE28|5.0|I'd highly recommend this soundtrack, both as a stand-alone record, and as a companion to the film.  Oscar Isaac is absolutely captivating as Llewyn Davis, and the choice of songs have a very personal meaning, when coupled with the film.  The other artists who appear on the record are equally solid, giving us a fictional glimpse at the folk scene. The only song I itch to pass over is Please Mr. Kennedy, but the urge makes a lot of sense given the context of the song in the film.<br />I will add that the vinyl indeed does not come with the digital download, but as has been commented, this isn't something that brings down the quality of the album.  The vinyl is also missing the song The Roving Gambler, no doubt cut for time, but is still excellent.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Good book. Kept my attention. One of those books that is hard to set aside. Will try another book by this author.
B008RNGCAO|5.0|I would love to recommend this book to batman fans through out the world .and in fan of marvel drop what you are reading and read the Adventures of the dark knight
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|I love this album. It can be played from beginning to end. Every single song is a prime example of what radio is missing. Its chill. Its beautiful. It speaks to and for the soul.
B008RF0M9O|5.0|These pads came quickly and in perfect condition.  They fit and updated my 10+ year old headphones into a new pair.  Sony headphones last forever.  Very happy!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this is a very addictive game. easy to play and easy to learn. however when you reach the latter games, it can be very hard to pay without in game purchase. the added in game purchase can be costly then.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|I picked up Paper Towns after reading two of John Green's other novels, The Fault in Our Stars and Looking for Alaska. I think that Green is a very clever writer, and Paper Towns did not disappoint.<br /><br />The book follows the story of Quentin Jacobsen, or Q, and his neighbor, Margo Roth Spiegelman. Q and Margo grew up next door to each other, but were never extremely close. Q, however, has had a huge crush on Margo for several years. Then suddenly, Margo shows up at Q's window one night asking for a ride. After one night during which Margo takes Quentin on a wild ride around town, taking revenge on classmates that had wronged her and Q. The next day, Margo disappears. She leaves behind some clues meant for Q, however, and thus begins the wild chase Q leads his friends on in search of Margo.<br /><br />There was a lot to like about Paper Towns. John Green is a very clever writer, and some of his lines actually made<br />me laugh out loud, which doesn't happen often. The beginning of the book was very strong and drew me in right away. I was curious to see what happened to Margo, if Q would find her, and honestly, if she was going to be ok or not. The book moved at a pretty good pace and it was a nice, quick read.<br /><br />One thing that I would say bothers me a little is just how self-aware, well-read and well-spoken all of Green's characters are. All of them, in every book I have read thus far. I guess it's not really a big flaw, it just makes them sounds like 25-year-old philosophy students, not your average teenager. They read Whitman, listen to Guthrie and Coltrane and have long monologues about the meaning of life and how we're all bound together.It's not necessarily bad, it just doesn't seem realistic to me, that's all.<br /><br />Also, it seems like their parents let them do literally whatever they want (especially near the end), no resistance whatsoever. That kinda bugged me. Also, the fact that super-popular Lacey was interested in Ben (definitely themost obnoxious and nerdy of the group) was a little hard to believe. There were a couple other things I raised my eyebrow at, but no major plot holes.  All in all, though, despite the lack of realism, I did like Paper Towns and I think that Green is a talented author. I'm sure that I'll read his next novel as well.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I personally didn't like it the higher your level, but it could be that I didn't understand how the game works.  I have alot friends who play it on their computers.  Mine was downloaded on my kindle.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This film is one I've watched over and over. Born and raised in the south as an African American female, I'm blessed my grandparents worked hard so my parents would not have to be subjected to this mentality. However, so many family friends, it was explained to me as a child during this era were \\"maids, housekeepers, live-ins\\", some who were teachers but doing the summers worked to feed their families as domestics. One of the major things I enjoyed about the film, it showed the love, the tenacity and the strong-will of women who took care of white women and their children especially, many times not able to care for their own families and what they had to endure. I hope it opened the hearts and minds of many who didn't have a clue or understanding of the role so many African American women still had to play to survive even after slavery.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am addicted to this game I have it on my phone, computer, and thanks very much,also on my kindle now. This is so much fun and I love competition with all my fb friends.
B0048GZWVY|5.0|This was a film I wanted in my library. After seeing the film as a mental health therapist, it allowed me to reflect upon many clients I've had who have had similar traumas in their life. There are so many hidden secrets behind closed doors but with the help of support systems outside those walls, people can and do thrive which is what the film represented. Despite all the odds against her she was ready to thrive.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If you love candy and gaming, this is for you. Thank goodness you only get 5 lives or you would be hard pressed to put the game down. It will be my favorite game for quite some time. The game has far more levels than most and each is filled with serious challenges.
B0083Z614S|3.0|Book may be OK, but I do not remember ordering or receiving it. Please check your records and let me know if this is not correct..
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I fell in love with this book from the first few pages. I love the story it tells. It will make you laugh, cry and you will remember their story. 💜
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|This is the Stryper that I remember from earlier days! Wow! These guys have the power behind them! M. Sweet's voice is angelic on supernatural spiritual steroids! Oz Fox is Rocking God's house on guitar....as is Michael Sweet!  Sweet brother Robert is the drum master supreme! Timothy Gaines brings it all together with his bass.  This is Stryper........LOOK OUT! THEY ARE BACK TO TAKE OVER THE GOD ROCK REVOLUTION!  NOT A SINGLE TRACK ON THIS ONE THAT'S LACKING!!!!!!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Flight is a great movie. It's a good story and realistic portrayal of an alcoholic. As always, Denzel is fantastic.
B008P1EWIM|2.0|NO Radar. You cannot be serious! You should display moving radar. I wasted $ 2.99! I believe you essentially committed fraud with this app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this app bout time they make it for kindke fire!!!!!!!!! I never got into candy crush cuz im always on my kindle but im totally hooked now
B005ZUR724|5.0|I use to play mabinogi &amp; wow<br />and this game reminds me of both games<br />the details of this game is nice right now I'm saving up for a pet and pet mount :)
B0053TMP24|5.0|Rick has inspired young readers like me about Greek and Roman mythology and inspired me too start reading about mythology
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I really Enjoyed playing this game, but I disliked the whole skull system. While playing I had an interesting idea; a A shooting range system. You could test out weapons before playing with them. That's all.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Once again Rick Riordan goes beyond with his books I ready his Percy Jackson serious at least five times it is so great
0871164566|5.0|I really like this book. Even if not all of the projects are exactly to my style, it gives good instructions to do your own work.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a great book I read this series at least 8 times and I can wait until the next book in the series comes on my kindle fire and can wait till I read the next book. I recommend anyone who likes a action book,suspense,and loves a great story of ancient times.
B009NXD6JM|5.0|A classic movie you just can't miss. They just don't make movies like this any more! Join Prime and watch it for free.... No I don't work for Amazon, just a happy customer.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Again,another example of his amazing story telling. His ability to take you to another world is the reason why I love to read!!
B004HZXORA|5.0|These films look amazing in their much-anticipated BD release.  People giving this box-set poor reviews and detailing every tiny little item they have a problem with miss the point of suspension of disbelief.  Some seem to forget that when someone makes a film, a work of art, a device, tool or basically anything at all, it's their creation and not the viewer's. I'm of the opinion that if you create something like a film, you have every right to make changes to YOUR creation as you see fit.  Whether its to correct an error, take advantage of updated technology to create special effects, change dialogue for clarity, advance the story or just change the tone of a scene then that is YOUR choice and no one else's.  If I made a film that happened to gain popularity, and later made changes that I wanted to make to MY original creation, who is Jon Doe to tell me I ruined it or to tell me that I'm suddenly a horrible film-maker even though 20 years ago I was their favorite film-maker?  I can understand the viewers who prefer the unedited film simply prefer to watch that version, and if they do, they should keep watching that version.  But to dedicate so much time detailing every criticism of the changes that I decided to make would just baffle me.  Okay, so the new versions aren't exactly the same and you dislike some or all of the changes.  Don't watch it or buy it.  It's that simple.  But as creator and owner of the film, I pretty much have free reign to do with it as I please.
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|I was enjoying game for about a week until I woke up this morning to see all the work I did yesterday was gone, so now I have deleted game for wasting my time!
B0063B2BNE|5.0|I love Booth and Brennan. I love Angela and her Angelatron. I miss Zach and wish he would come back/be released from the psych ward.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Best version of this game! I do wish their were more robots to choose from though, but other than that it's sweet.
B00746O3X8|5.0|I have used this a lot and it does what it supposed to do. It is firm and reliable. Cameras don't hit each other and this is just too affordable with the assistance that it gave me. [...]
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the most fantastic game ever since I bought it for my sister she said that I should buy it to as I kept on playing no-one could deny it(:.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It works great. Video quality is very good. Easy to use. I would have given it 5 stars except it doesn't let me stream video or pictures I have stored on my computer. Overall a good product.
0762445262|5.0|I didnt actually buy it on amazon, but in a store, so i knew exactly what i was getting, appearance wise anyway. They told me in the store it lit up but wouldnt project on the wall, and i still thought it was worth the price. I was pleasantly surprised to lean it does in fact project a decent logo from about 1.5 feet away. Considering I paid the same price pretty much as on here, I don't think you can go wrong. Im considering getting the light up jar of kryptonite they make as well.
B009W6OXB0|5.0|My daughter was so excited when she opened the box up and this record was in there. Her older sister got it for her for her birthday. She's a huge Bruno Mars fan and then to have his music on an album was even better. I don't think there is one song she doesn't like.
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|It's fun and entertaining. Can be addictive as you keep wanting to increase your score. Can be for one player or two for more of a challenge.
B00881VLCE|3.0|The puzzles are awesome, but the app tends to close on you regularly, with no notice.  You do lose puzzle packs with every update, but you can restore paid uploads. If only it weren't so slow to download them that it fails most of the time.  I only recommend downloading if your internet connection is very good.  This puzzle app is easier to use than the others, and you can change skins if you pay for the ad-free plan.  The skin the game comes with is really dark and hard to see the dark puzzle pieces.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So much fun! Keeps you on your toes. Challenging but not to hard. Looking forward to more levels! Hopefully. soon!
B0053O89KG|5.0|I love castle my favorite show like every have all the season and when I watch it I have to watch them all... Castle is so fine and she is hot they make a great crime fight team.... I love this show and cant wait for all the season to come out to add to my collection
B000W4E3OS|5.0|I paid this too expensive.  Now it is much cheaper.  Buy it, you won't regret your purchase, it is, as far as I know, the best Scriabin ever. Martin
B000H7J9QM|5.0|I keep buying this show and everyone keeps take it home with them. I bought it for our blu ray player and it plays great. I am also love the music the clut painted on you heart...
B0000012Y1|5.0|The best Lohengrin.  I love this version, the music, Wagner was a genious. The singers are great and the conductor is great.  A real fairly tale.<br /><br />Martin
0780622650|4.0|Good DVD and a good movie.  No problems with this DVD package.  I would advise a friend to purchase this DVD.
0312944926|3.0|The read was quick but that's because it was predictable. However, Dan Brown uses skillful penmanship to make wonderful and engaging descriptions of places/feelings/situation that you feel as if you are right there.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|Very powerful processor. Integrated GPU is really good for videos in HD. This is a good option for &#34;all around&#34; computers.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is a compelling and thought provoking book about a young boy that struggles with sibling rivalry, bullying, and making friends when the only kid who can come close to you in intelligence is just as small as you are.  All while unknowingly commanding a war against an alien race that is now just trying to protect itself.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book as a child and reading it as an adult makes me see where it influenced how I am.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|Had a bit of trouble getting into it but by the 3rd or 4th chapter I was hooked. I think the graphic language threw me off (though I didn't find it offensive). The swearing and graphic language just felt unnecessary and over-indulgent until I got into the book and cared about the characters enough to understand that it was more of a character choice rather than the author wanting to fling around graphic content a la George Martin. Loved the story.
034580404X|5.0|this collection was amazing and i cant wait to see the movie. explicit writting and amazing storyline. definatly a must read!
B008JFUNNM|4.0|It is difficult to get into a film when Wolf Blitzer gives away the ending. Had it not been for the world media, the Internet, and Blitzer this would have indeed been a film worth watching. Even if you have been living under a rock, Tom Hanks projects enough impending doom into the film, that I was wondering why they were missing the ominous horror music.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the acting was top notch and deserves recognition. However, I do not enjoy every well acted film. The film itself brings no new revelation to what happened in the incident. Indeed, if anything the film towed the administration's line and ignored controversial details that have since emerged, like &#34;what happened to the money?&#34; and the alleged multiple shots that were fired into each pirate, including those done after boarding the boat.<br /><br />This is a nice white bread action flick you can take your family to go see. 3 1/2 stars
B00F8LPH90|5.0|It really does make you feel like a gunner in the specter gunship!!  I would recommend this game to anyone.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|Through a series of misunderstandings two West Virginia Hillbillies are mistaken for slashers. This is to slasher films what \\"Zombieland\\" is to zombie films. What is good about the film is that the writers were able to keep up the mistakes and errors for the entire film at the same comedy intensity. Genius. This film is a keeper for those who love the horror/comedy genre.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex talk, very brief nudity (Chelan Simmons -even with zoom and slo-mo)
B00APKIN1I|4.0|I really like Dave Grohl. I think he is very talented. I really admire his work and this album is a fun compilation CD of him with various artists.
B0091W0JPE|4.0|This movie was contemporary when it was released in 1942.  As a child, I remember the raves but did not understand all that was going on in the movie.  I just knew we were the good guys and the Germans were the bad guys.  I didn't know Free French from Vichy French.  If you are not versed in WW II history, the movie would be confusing.  As an old guy, I like it.  For younger folks, maybe irrelevant and confusing.  Ingrid is beautiful, and Bogie is Bogie, but the acting isn't up to standards for today.  A good nostalgia piece.
1250037751|4.0|I'm not sure where to begin...it's been a long time since I've enjoyed a book as much as I enjoyed this one. It's been on my to-read list for almost a year (though admittedly, that's shorter than a lot of my books have been on the list), and I finally got it from the library. The total time taken to read it as maybe 3 or 4 hours, though I read it over a span of about 20 hours.<br /><br />It's a story about a secret society of bibliophiles started by Aldus Manutius, a Venetian printer and publisher living during the 15th and 16th centuries. Manutius left the key to immortality to be decoded by his followers through the careful study of codex vitae, and once the codex written by Manutius is solved (which they've been working on for the past 500 years), all past members of the secret society will be resurrected and all current and future members will have eternal life.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the narrator of the story thinks all this is BS, but goes along with it anyway out of curiosity and dedication to his employer, Mr. Penumbra. Clay Jannon is snarky and witty, two things I love in a protagonist. His inner monologue kept me thoroughly entertained and even made me giggle to myself once in awhile. The author, Robin Sloan, is able to make his narrator's voice light without diminishing the mystery of the secret society or the reader's curiosity about whether the key to immortality is really to be found in a 500-year-old book.<br /><br />The book has a curious mix of dusty old books and shiny new PCs, as the reader gets a history lesson in early printing techniques as well as a view into the inner workings of Google. I'm not-so-secretly envious of programmers, and so enjoyed the tango between the new and old that Sloan wove into his story. I'll definitely be reading more of his work in the future.<br /><br />Find more reviews at mybooklust.wordpress.com
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|This book is terrible and if it wasn't a book club book, I would not finish it; it is painful.  Bridget immature and fledgling in her early thirties was funny, in her early fifties, it is depressing.  I'm sorry, texting with people while she is in book meetings with a publisher, I'm sorry, I want her to get fired and am happy when it happens.  I didn't expect this to be a serious book, but I would have thought (hoped) that Bridget would have matured a little bit, but she has not.  At 50, it is pathetic.  I am hoping she redeems herself, I am about 60% finished, but do not have even a reasonable hope at this point.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I read this book fir the first time when I was a young girl and loved it then. It's an excellent story.
0375842209|5.0|This is my favorite book of the year.  I enjoyed the way the author used death to tell the story and developed the characters in the story.
B00GHIX46G|5.0|So far i am really enjoying this tv show. love the follow up of the Avengers, and I actually before I started watching this tv show I had actually just got done watching Iron Man 3. Can't wait to find out how the next episode is going to play out. This one really drew me in.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie a must have in your library  keeps you on your toes wanting to see more lived it I got me a copy
1250038820|5.0|Anyone who has wondered, &#34;How does [that photographer] get such amazing candid shots?&#34; would do well to obtain Brandon Stanton's book.  His photos are awesome because he engages is subjects.  Here you have, not just a book of photos, but mini-biographies!
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|This concert is perfection, with every word and note heartfelt.  Fantastic arrangements, back up singers, atmosphere, also. Buy it, with no doubts.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|At times during the season I really wondered, ant at times some things really didn't seem to be making any sense and they seemed to be just repeating some of the same old themes and stories. But the last episode pulled everything together in such a brilliant manner.  At the end of the session I had completely forgotten this was a whole new doctor until I read some of the other reviews.  Yes I did mourn the old doctor and it was sad to say Good Bye, but that is the way of the Doctor and it really wouldn't be Doctor Who if they kept the same one all the time.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Excellent book. And an even better series. I can't believe its over or that it ended in the way it did, but I'm so glad is read it. This book has helped me deal with grief in a whole new way
B001BANK32|4.0|Enjoyed the book, as ever.  Plan to get Dr. Sleep but time to take a break from King..<br />But I'll return...I always return.
B008RZF1UO|4.0|It's a Great recording. I love Tommy's vocals. Similar to khan which I love too but distinct in their styles. My favorites are veritas ashes to ashes and my confession
B001TH16DI|5.0|Great set of movies at a great price. Got this blu-ray set when it was on special. Can't beat it.
B00B7FXZQS|2.0|I Jumped a few times.  It's a Decent story line. But same as the others. Seen one you've seen them all
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|compelling drama!<br />enjoyed  the movie very much and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys exciting movies. It held my interest.
B005FFW46S|5.0|What to say? A discworld book by Terry Pratchett! In my opinion, Pratchett is the best fantasy author out there because of how good his writing is. It transcends genre - it's just damn good prose! His wordplay is delightful, and reminiscent of Douglas Adams', while being completely original. And he does it every single time (at least in the stuff he writes by himself)! If you love Discworld books, you'll definitely love this one.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|The real Slim Shady please stand up......This album shows why Em is the best to ever do it.....smart to get one of the pioneers to help on this one. Rick Rubin and Dre as exec producers? Classic....Rap God and Headlights are 2 of the many stand out tracks that make this album ahead of all of the garbage out. 41 years old? Proves you get better with age.
0804137501|1.0|I wish that this book had provided alot more of the promise \\"Remote working ... this book shows you how you do it\\"<br /><br />I was also blended by the masses of positive reviews in your description, what i absolutely think is pointless and unfair.<br />I bough that book in the german Amazon.de shop. There is just one 5 star review and then there are the tons of positive reviews in your description.<br />So i did not think twice before buying it.<br />If it had not have so many positive reviews in the description, i would have looked at the amazon.com reviews and i would have seen that this book is useless to me.<br />As many other reviewers who are working remotely already are saying something similar.<br /><br />I am very disappointed about the book as i am working remotely already, I was expecting this book to show me how to optimize my workflow.<br /><br />All it did was telling me WHY remote is good... that is what i already know and i often times thought: \\"Seriously you have to mention that??? who is this book written for?\\"<br /><br />I think the book might be useful for managers only, old managers, who probably do not care to change anything anymore anyways...<br /><br />I am totally missing the action plan, then it might be useful to hand out to new employees.<br /><br />Obviously (as of the reviews) there are some people out there which can take something positive from it, that is good news for the upcoming generations, but really, that is so much common sense packed into some sloppy writing.<br /><br />To me it is absolutely obvious that living in a polluted city, wasting hours in traffic, beeing distracted by unpolite co-workers is a recipe for mediocrity.<br /><br />If you want to change the world, why do you make the price so expensive in comparison to the effort you put into it? I bet this book was written in less than a month.<br /><br />This book is lacking some neutrality, you mention YOUR products, YOUR workers way too often. That makes it totallyobvious you did not put any research into it.<br /><br />I do not want to use basecamp, or chatfire, or basefire or chatcamp whatever it is named i already forgot it, because my mind replaced the words while reading them with \\"pivotal tracker\\", \\"trello\\", \\"skype\\", \\"hipchat\\", \\"irc\\", \\"dropbox\\", \\"mega\\", WHATEVER!
B005LAII3A|5.0|I loaned mine to a friend and she lost it. I was very happy to find it on amazon for half of what I paid for it in walmart.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|If you are looking for something to watch online like “YouTube,  Hulu,  NetFlix then this thing is for you.<br />Google doesn’t want people to watch their own music and movie with this thing, and you won’t be able to. Google did auto update the firmware to make that people can’t play their own stuff which the previous firmware did.<br />This thing doesn’t have a user interface, so you have to open a browser “Google chrome only” that very ODD.<br />My was freezing 2 to 10 second during making the image like ghost shadow.
B00355L2TU|2.0|definitely not for the unexerciser. A beginner this is not for. Her person even who modify was hard to follow. Sorry I bought this
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great product, great ease of use, just wish it supported more that Youtube and browser. Would be nice to stream your laptop, or videos from your nas, etc....
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|one of my kids accidently cracked our movie. I was bummed. then I went on amazon and found it for half the price of the store.  Needless to say we were all very happy
B0070Z97LG|3.0|It was alright. Was looking for a horror movie to stream and ended up with this one. Acting was alright, but a little slow
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|wanted the movie but walmart was way to expensive. a friend of mine mentioned amazon and boy was I ever so happy. It was cheap
B0085A9HXS|4.0|If you want a manly, action movie, this is one for you. Only hard part is it is foreign, so it is voiced over in english but the move itself is great.
0736092269|5.0|Direct and to the point reference material on full body mechanics, strength training. The graphical depictions are second to none and continue the high quality legacy of Delavier's work. I am a fan of all his books and they sit on my shelf as a continuous reference. This book is not a reference on all ways to use dumbbells, body weight movements, or free motion machines; it is meant to provide instruction on those muscle movements that will provide the greatest impact to reaching your goal of developing primary muscle groups in a reasonable time frame, but remember exercise alone will not get you the physique you are looking for so do not blame the book if you do not see results; you need to have proper nutrition as the foundation - macronutrients.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|You really cant go wrong with Dan Brown. This was another beautifully researched and written book from him. A must read.
0385349947|1.0|The contents of the book was great...meaning text and what not, but the quality of the book that was sent to me was junk. The pages were not in the book straight or even for that matter. This book I could have gotten just as cheap at a Barnes and Noble, and had a better quality book as well. I am not sure if the person I purchased my copy from bought a bunch of ruined ones and then turned around and sold them on Amazon, but I am not happy with that seller by any means.
B00164GDA0|5.0|Great story of how deep childhood friendships can be and how<br />those relationships can shape us.  This is one you shouldn't miss!
B004JN1CW4|4.0|I really want the suspense to continue..I'm not ready for it to be over. This was an amazing book. Make more
B00AEFY3DQ|4.0|Hilarious send-up of Star-Trek series that is a lot of fun.<br />You will laugh from beginning to end; beautiful Sigourney<br />Weaver is very un-Alienesque.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It was filled with great action scenes and the acting was very good considering that they used real SEALs to play the roles.
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|If Timothy Leary were to direct a movie, it would look like this...<br />it is a trip!  Those of us fortunate to have 7.1 sound get a<br />special treat.  Supposed to be a prequel to the original, but<br />it is definitely cut from different cloth.  Great movie!
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater and decided to but the DVD so I could see the movie again.  I really like the Underworld series.
B000H1RFKA|4.0|Off-beat, but almost tries too hard at being avant-garde.<br />Still, it's an enjoyable movie, if you don't take it too<br />seriously.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|This band never ceases to amaze me. I have followed them from the Majesty days and love how they keep evolving. This CD adds the songwriting and musicianship of Mike Mangini, not to mention a slight change to heavy guitar from John Petrucci.
B009R8DHAQ|5.0|i am 11 year old kid i find this book very cool i lt was better than ugly truth which is 5th book in this series
B00CXQL828|5.0|The music on this disc proves that three great musicians can get together, write some great songs and prove that rock music is still alive! And most surprising is the vocals of Richie Kotzen...great range with a hint of Chris Cornell.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|This is a large unit. After mounting, the side of the case could not be reinserted without cutting slots for the top of the cooler. Did not significantly reduce heat more than my smaller previous cooler. But does the job fine.<br /><br />*NOTE* I had to attach the mount to both sides of the motherboard. So be aware that you may need to remove it from the case to install the cooler.
1451695195|4.0|Liked the book very much.  Well written and very interesting.  Although it was written by a physician, the medical information neccessary to fully understand the journey was easy for a non-medical person to comprehend.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|The drugs , the drinking ! Way more than what Denzel should have done . I thought he was better than staring in this slop .
B006LSZECO|5.0|Full of twists and turns.  Once you start be prepared to be be caught up in the story. A really elegant mystery.  And the conclusion of it all was masterful.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|This is a very neat little game that appeals to my kids and me. It definitely has a great science feel to it!!!
B000RLFJQ2|5.0|Entertaining, much like every movie with DeNiro and Reno. And McElhone is sexy as the leader. Good special effects and chase scenes.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Light comical entertaining well written and i suspect factually accurate. I gives you an excellent insight into what life could be like for someone with Asperger's - and most of all it has a happy ending.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|By the end of this book (and I did finish it because, like Thor, I refuse to be defeated by that which I can't comprehend) I was laughing out loud at the sheer ridiculousness of the story line, total lack of depth of the characters and immaturity of the writing.  There's no nuance to any of it. I strongly recommend that you not spend the $0.00 and time to embark on this particular quest.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun and loved to play it but wished it was longer and had more rooms.I have replayed this numerous times
0060229357|5.0|Grandchildren loved this book.  It is a classic.  Will buy more like it.  The kids loved when it came in the mail.
1419705644|5.0|OOO!!!  The land of it!  The more you already know about OOO the moar you'll appreciate the book.  It's FILLED with tidbits of juicy info and insight that hardcore AT fans will love.  Even if you don't know that much about Adventure Time you'll still love it as you'll get to know everything inside the land of OOO.<br />Kids will enjoy reading about their favorite TV stars but most of the jokes will go above their heads.  To them this will be a fun and cool encyclopedia for their show and they'll probably wonder why their parents are laughing hysterically while reading the same page they just did.<br />Get it and you won't be disappointed!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|such a fun and well written show.  the story lines and banter between the characters are addicting and leaves you wanting more.
B0064W65UM|5.0|A great story, written by two geniuses, who both have an unmatched talent in making dark and scary characters, who you just can't figure out.
B005544V6A|5.0|girlfriend and i are not into legal dramas, but we are absolutely hooked!  each episode leaves you wanting more and you just can't wait to see how each character develops.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This is a very fun and challenging game of skill. I can't seem to put it down. The fun and the challenge increase with each new course and level.
B00DZAWPNM|5.0|As pretentious as Panic At The Disco is, their music is still great. I hate the moronic titles of their songs, but their music is still some of the best you'll find out their and you won't be disappointed with this album.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This is my favorite show. It keeps me on edge. Everytime I watch it leaves you wondering what will happen next.
B00EMGUT1I|3.0|What got me to give this album a try is Motorhead's production of Triple H's theme music. I loved that entrance song and their live performance of that song and I decided to buy this CD. I enjoyed the music, although there was no specific track that jumped out at me and captured my interest like Triple H's theme song. Still, the album is a pretty darn good.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|This show I consider a vice. It is very &#34;high school&#34;, but I can't help but watch it. I have a thing for vampires.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn was a master, allowing the pages to turn quite simply with this remarkable read...again. I hope whoever takes over this series writes half as well as Vince Flynn. Great man. Great author. Great American. God rest his soul.  Oh...and buy this book. You won't be disappointed at all.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I wish this had been around when I was in high school.  Maybe my grades in Espanol would have been better!  Great app!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Allie Brosh is a brilliantly honest, funny, self deprecating writer who is one of the few authors able to regularly make me laugh uncontrollably. This book collects some of her greatest posts from her blog interspersed with uniformly wonderful new material. If you like to laugh and are willing to occasionally go to some dark places along the way (along with bright, bizarre, dog-filled places), pick this up. You won't be disappointed.
B003INBNXO|1.0|I liked this movie at the start, with its bustling Chinese streets and diverse array of personalities that gave it a much more well rounded feel than a lot of other movies set in similar places. However, the more that I watched the wooden acting of Donnie Yen, listened to the insipidly written dialogue of his wife, and noticed little kids in occupied China practicing kung fu in cardigans that don't even look like they've had the Banana Republic tags removed, the less engaged I was. The martial arts scenes became increasingly stylized as the plot progressed; by the time Yen starts fighting the Japanese, he looks more like he's giving them some strange form of massage than actually fighting. The biggest shocker to me, however, was that the Chinese in fact won their long war against Japan on 15 Aug 1945, after being galvanized by Ip Man's nickle-plated fists to overthrow their oppressors. Kung fu, of course, is what did the trick.
B0048WQDIE|3.0|What did I just read?!?!<br />It was an interesting book but I'm not sure that I liked it.  The development of the characters was okay but I'm not sure what the point of the story really was. Read this because of the classical nature of the book but...hmmm
B00571F26Y|4.0|I'm guessing many people buying this book have problems with gluten.  While I've never considered myself to be gluten intolerant, I am trying to lead a healthier lifestyle.  Dr. Davis did an excellent job of educating what is behind the dramatic rise in weight, diabetes cases and other health problems brought on by wheat products.  I doubt I will ever go completely gluten-free, but I have dramatically cut back on bread and pasta.  After only a week I lost 4 or 5 pounds, felt better and had no acid reflux problems of any type and have slept great.  Seems simple, but eating less bread and pasta and incorporating more veggies into my diet made me feel better.  This book is a good read and very educational.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game but too limiting as to number of turns before it shuts you down.<br /><br />My Grandkids love it a lot.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I cannot describe this series in a way that could possibly express my feelings for it. After reading the entire series back to back in an obsession fueled marathon, I realized that George R.R. Martin had written (in my humble opinion) possibly the best story that I have ever been told. I cannot give enough praise to the quality and depth of the characters, or the ingenuity of the storytelling.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Though the writers have put together another great season, it feels like there is no light at the end of the tunnel. New guy shows up aaannnddd... Dead! Personal dramas with the characters trying to overcome the obvious doom is expected. But, like the name of the show emplies, it's a story about The Walking Dead and, there you go!<br /><br />I still watch it and am seeing our future played out in front of us, right? I mean, this is actually the sequel to where Breaking Bad left off, isn't it? Because that blue stuff could actually wipe out humanity as we know it.  Thanks Heisenberg!
B00CATSONE|2.0|This book was not what it seemed to be. It is not a biography of a interesting man of science. It seems like a setup for the authors next book on imagination. I was sincerely disappointed.
B0063FGFK0|4.0|Great movie, decent price. Sad that the bad of the case had multiple scratches and the items had wear and tear.
B003O86FMW|5.0|All I can say is it was amazing!!!!!!!<br />P.S I am so going to so read the next book so soon
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is a really fun and simple game to play but makes you use your mind to solve the puzzel
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The Book Thief is well written and engaging. An interesting German perspective of Germany during the 30s and 40s. The conclusion was rushed and incomplete.
8189988042|5.0|Written with clarity and simplicity,  it is powerful and life changing if we take the time to consider it and make it a part if our daily routine.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Funny and the kids love it, great message about not giving up, not being afraid of change and there is always a better way.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I like the visual aspect of the game but it is too easy to win. The shuffling at the end makes it impossible to loose.
B00F8GYC1Y|3.0|I'm kind of an Angry Bird Nerd, but this one just didn't grab me. Stick with the original AB Starwars, much better.
1416550550|4.0|It took me awhile to get used to how the author was writing.  I had to go back to connect the story.  I found that I didn't prefer her writing style
1590171993|3.0|This book gets raves from everyone but me -- I found it bleaker than it needed to be to be credible.  Also, beyond a certain point it was so consistent you could predict the next turn of events.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Best show on tv. Very character driven with tons of action to keep you entertained. Gonna miss it when it comes to an end.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved the book. Could not wait to keep reading. Have told friends and family how much I enjoyed this book.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This Movie is so funny! Fat Amy is my hero! This movie is to Bring it On as Cabin in the Woods is to Evil dead. A play on a cliche.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so fun and it has great graphics and fun characters. I would give it 5 stars but occasionally it runs slow and I need to restart it.
B002CORN4S|2.0|For me, VH started much heavier...the beginnings of the songs entranced and enthralled you to continue to listen, despite lyrics which were still great, that rivaled some great AC/DC intros (consider the beginning of Ain't talking about love)...now some of the songs would take a twist, and then it was if this was a different song altogether, and didn't match the intro...heavy guitar chords and riffs...If you listen to the early albums, pre 5150, or Roth Era, there are th origins of the influences of those Sierra Madre boys where there was Rollin' Rock n' Roll straight from the blues...I really enjoyed 5150 (the code in the law that allows the state to take temporary custody of one's body as a result of being a danger to self, danger to others, or grossly disorganized for up to 72 hours, upon which you have to have a judge determine a longer period of losing your age of majority...just in case you didn't know), But, as for many of us, our identities were shaken from the crisis of the \\"me generation\\" that plagued the 80s, the pill, etc...that occurred in the 90s,...It seemed to my dismay, that some of the Haggar influence might have been how shallow the content had become...take I can't drive 55...we all feel this, but to make a song about it...? It just seemed to me that the lyrics were sillier, not as genuine, more shallow, more cliche, I mean...what are they going to sing when they are 60...I celebrated a regular bowl movement?  Something deeper, like Ice Cream Man, with real musicality, not gimmicks, or abrupt changes...I do see and appreciate the later years, but the patience I have to listen to all songs, let alone commit them to memory and scream them out rocking out on a commute has diminished...greatly...perhaps I failed to evolve and they did? But I consider them two bands...
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Downloads YouTube videos perfectly and saves me time waiting for videos to load at the gym where I have no connection.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|I love One Republic and all their music. Good sound and beat. Nice guys as far as I know. From Denver.
B00571F26Y|2.0|Dr. Davis could have said what was relevant in a pamphlet. It's a page-flipper for a short plane flight on an RJ.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Tremendous book and written by first hand by one if the people presented.  You get a truer sense if what our soldiers endure and what they go through in training to meet their challenges.
B006VDNDQI|5.0|I am a fan of EGB and have been over 70 years, with John Carter at the head of the list!
B006AX6ONI|5.0|It doesn't matter if you like him or hate him just read this book. You may find you may have more in common with him than you think. I did.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|*I downloaded it and I fell in love with it the good thing is nothing for money it's a great game if you love to play the piano!!!!*
B002NQ3AAQ|5.0|This is a gift for someone  else.  I LOVE  this movie ! Will probably buy one for myself too. :)
B00846TRHY|5.0|great movie very inspirational. brought hope to me and my family. gods calling takes us to a whole other level.
B003G4W49C|4.0|It was a really good book, couldn't put it down.  Went right into reading the second book and I am sure I will read the rest of them.
1451695195|1.0|We thought this would be a Christian account of the experience,  but there is no mention of Jesus Christ, and the way he describes God as Om  or whatever is not Christian.  I'm not sure what it is that he experienced but it was not the Christian Heaven.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|If you liked his first two books, you will absolutely love this one.His beautiful poetic prose, his ingenious weaving together of the interrupted lives of this Afghan family, his tender yet realistic portrayal of his characters--everything works beautifully yet realistically together.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|I'm listening to this CD now and The Lord's Prayer is probably my favorite. The entire album is Susan providing a stunning Christmas collection. Several of my friends have their early Christmas gift to enjoy. The Little Drummer Boy is also a favorite. Susan is truly a gift to the music world and hopefully a US concert tour in 2014.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I like this game a lot. I don't mind if I shoot animals in the game. As long as I am having fun, that is what matters most to me. The graphics are good and clear too. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to have fun, likes animals, and does not find shooting games disturbing.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Lots of fun, wish you never ran out of battery, gameplay is great though, very good graph on kindle, been playing for a couple weeks now and still enjoy
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I had had storage issues with my kindle fire before and went through the reset process. In trying to avoid doing that again I downloaded Clean Master. Amazing total freed up space no reset!
B00D3V85FA|4.0|Good music--weird how Ozzy's singing voice is so much different than his talking voice.  It's great that after all these years that they can still do it.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Every game has app-purchasing.It's dumb.But the I still like it.You get to take care of pets.Over 150 Littlest pet shop.
0893860468|5.0|Full of wisdom and insight. A spiritual classic written by a master. I dog-eared about every other page and will read it again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is great. So much better than the Twilight saga. This book is showing how girls are just as strong as boys in many different ways.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Laughed all the way through. One of my favorites; I can watch it again and again. My family has lines memorized from this film!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Love it my kids also love this camera an all the themes. They have a great time taken pictures all the time!
1419707299|5.0|Rated a special and intentional thanks from a grandson who usually doesn't say too much.  So it is a hit!
1567184855|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time!!  A must read!!  This book confirmed a lot what I felt about life:)
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had no idea what an intense book I was getting into when a friend recommended it, but it was a wonderful surprise. The layout of the story kept wonderful suspense and turns in the plot. She had me fooled for a long time!
B000AGTPUK|5.0|This is such an adorable Christmas movie. Good for the kids and adults. Tom Hanks does an awesome job playing several roles
B004UFEJS0|5.0|This is such an adorable movie! This is great for kids and adults, cute cooking movie that gets you inspired to cook!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This just keeps getting better. I can't wait for the third season to be released on Amazon. The stories are great, the acting is wonderful and the scenes have all the grit and oppudence of the time.Given it's HBO, I'd say this can only get better with time.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Well written, highly informative and rich in detail and story telling. Doris Kearns Goodwin shows the world why she's America's foremost authority on American history. Well worth your time and money, this is keeper in your library.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Just another amgry bird game. Tbere are far better out there to spend your time on. Go!search! You'll be glas you did.
B008Y212PI|5.0|It is a very good game, easy to play in your free time.<br /><br />It's better to use in a  tablet instead  a 4 inches screen cellphone as mine  ( samsung duos) because of the  15 x 15 celll puzzles
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I never played the original game but decided to try this one.  Woo!  It's fast paced and exciting.<br />Once I started I had to run! Over and over and over! Keep your wits about you during this game<br />and have fun!  :o)
0060537639|5.0|Very informative of the Chinese culture and history. The author has gone to a great amount of detailed research in order to justify his position. Very believable. Good reading for any person interested in detailed history.
B009NY43NY|1.0|What a hurried and terrible ending of the series. .. the signs always showed the possibility of Sookie getting together with Sam which is no issue.  But that the characterof Eric changed so much was very  strange. The last 2 books have just shown a strange twist. The end does not feel like an end.. very dissdisappointing! !
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I went out and bought a little notebook and some fine point pens because of this book. I know it doesn't seem like a big deal but I once thought of stories and little ideas and this book made me feel better about those ideas. Go read it and re-read it.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Fun game to play. Had to start over when it froze.  Ok now but I miss my stash of pearls.
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|John loves Yoko and Jax loves Mako.  LOL<br /><br />I have no idea what Charlie Hunnam's character's name is in this movie although I was watching the movie closely,  There is some fun robot fighting early on but then it is just waiting around for the ending - not enough fighting, some strange neurotic dating/pursuing Japanese girl stuff - UNBELIEVABLE - but it will certainly boost Japanese interest in Sons of Anarchy.<br /><br />The visuals are really nice in this so easy on the eye and not as distressingly loud as other action films so definitely recommended for being somewhat not more of the same old same old Transformers (Japanese origin) Michael Bay stuff.  This is a little more special and I attribute that to Guillermo Del Toro.<br /><br />One nice thing about this is that the base is set in Hong Kong which has always been of strategic importance.<br /><br />It doesn't make any sense that these robots can't fly and have to be airlifted.  Some other stuff doesn't make any sense in the same vein so something for Cinema Sins.<br /><br />ETA:  I've never seen Patlabor or the original Japanese films from the 1960s but I do find it weird that the point of entry is underwater in what looks like an open fault line exposing the earth's core, the kaiju excrement contaminating Manila is remiscent of the spread of the leaked Fukushima radiation, the kaiju themselves retain characteristics of marine animals similar to the recent discovery of a new humpback dolphin species off Australia and a new type of hammerhead shark has been discovered off the coast of South Carolina.<br /><br />What if the Kaiju are actually mutations caused by Fukushima radiation?  What if the kaiju excrement is toxic because it is radioactive.  What if the underwater breach represents a fault line exacerbated by secret frakking which caused the 3-11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami?<br /><br />Mako Mori's name looks like Shark Dead and she's wearing a house sweater covered in Dead LEAVES.<br /><br/>Some of the kaiju do seem sharklike and another clue is that you can keep a kaiju skin parasite alive after the host dies by soaking it in ammonia - sharks pee through their skin - which is why only the fin is considered edible by the Chinese.<br /><br />There's a lot of Chinese writing on the Hong Kong base and during the audition duel between John and Yoko, I'm reminded of [[ASIN:068980444X Come a Stranger (The Tillerman Series #5)]] which mentions twice that a little girl dances so naturally and effortlessly that it brings a smile to the face which I was fortunate to experience for myself from a SLO MO video off the new Apple iphone of a little girl who dances on Broadway - in slow motion, you can see that no matter how the same moves maybe imitated, some people are naturally more graceful.<br /><br />The Newt(on) character looking a little Rivers Cuomo of [[ASIN:B000W21H9Y Undone -- The Sweater Song]] fame gets schooled by Hellboy himself that if you mind meld with a kaiju, the kaiju mind melds you right back.  Tsk, tsk.<br /><br />In this film, it's called DRIFTING - which is weird because of the meaning of drifting from car racing.<br /><br />\\"You felt it, right? We're drift compatible!\\"<br /><br />Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.  (My shark heart just peed.)<br /><br />DISGUSTING.  Hahaha.<br /><br />(I'd like to see it embroidered on a sweater.)
B004D9FLJE|5.0|They helped fixed a small problem and were always responsive. They even made sure I got it by checking in. Thank you so much.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Enjoyed this book, but was predictable John Grisham.  A good read though. WAS LIKE the old John Grisham. A broke law firm against big money.
B005JTAP4S|5.0|Peter: A Darkened Fairytale by William O'Brien<br /><br />This book is an interesting and unique read. Author William O'Brien takes you on a thrilling ride through extraordinary realms and introduces you to many fascinating characters. There are many twists and turns in this different take on a fairytale, and O'Brien pulls it off brilliantly.<br /><br />Peter, the protagonist of the story, is a wonderful character. He's smart, lovable and brave. On his tenth birthday, he visits an antique shop and finds a curious grandfather clock. He opens the door to the clock, enters it, and is immediately transported to another dimension where strange lands and creatures abound.<br /><br />Peter: A Darkened Fairytale will have you at the edge of your seat, turning pages as fast as you can to find out what happens next as Peter continues his dark journey. If you enjoyed the book Alice in Wonderland, you will enjoy this novel. The two books are similar in that they both feature a series of strange encounters, as in a dream. William O'Brien is masterful with his descriptions and storytelling. I recommend you check out this book.<br /><br />Vashti Quiroz-Vega
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is sooooooooo awesome!!!!! You can choose to do it the hard way on survival (still super fun) or have all the supplies and be in no danger on creative (even better!)  I just have one thing to say... BUY THIS GAME YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BFV1JVM|4.0|I've heard a lot about this series and finally took the plunge. I wasn't disappointed. I couldn't put it down.
B000BZISTE|5.0|If you liked the MASH TV series you ain't seen nothing yet. This movie that launched the careers of Donald Sutherland, Elliot Gould, Sally Kellerman,Robert Duvall as Major Frank Burns,Tom(Alien,Picket Fences)Skerritt,and Rene(Odo Star Trek DS9)Auberjonois just may be the funniest movie ever. Far funnier than the series. Directed by Robert Altman this is a comedy masterpiece.
B008JFUO72|5.0|It's true Robert Downey Jr. IS IRON MAN. I thought 3 would be a dud. But not as long as Stan Lee is alive. This episode is different because it focuses on Tony Stark the man not Ironman. It was a risk that paid off.
1432794426|5.0|Defending A King  His Life and Legacy.<br />Author Karen Moriarty<br />I just finished reading Defending A King for the 2nd time.  I plan on reading it again and again.<br />. I wasn't a lifelong fan of Michael Jackson and only knew what I heard on TV or read in various magazines, yes, tabloid.  After reading this book I realized just how little I knew of Michael Jackson.  My view and opinion of Michael Jackson completely changed after reading Defending A King. Defending A King, is filled with carefully researched facts collected over a 2 year period of time by Dr. Moriarty.  Defending A King puts to rest the many factious rumors surrounding the life of Michael Jackson.  This book is about the man and the entertainer.  If you thought you knew it all think again.  I highly recommend this book to every one of his fans as well as those who would like to know the life this man lead.  Each chapter is filled with examples clearly showing the trial and tribulations Michael Jackson endured during the last years of his life.  Chapter by chapter you are drawn into the life of a man known as \\"The King of Pop\\".  What he endured through endless tabloid journalism, court cases, friends and known business associates extorting not only his wealth but his name.  You'll hear accounts from close friends and associates in his inner circle on what Michael was thinking.  You'll read the heartwarming accounts of his relationship with his children from their body guards.  You'll hear accounts of how he handled the daily pressure he was under.  You'll begin to understand why Michael Jackson took certain actions and decisions for the sake of himself and his family.  You'll begin to understand the man, not the entertainer.  The life this man lead was simply remarkable in all aspects, the good, bad and ugly, it's all here.  Dr. Moriarty looked for facts, reliable sources and specifics on certain events until she uncovered the truth.  If you want the honest truth without the tabloid interjections, this book is the one you want.  Each of the 500+ pages is a wonderful representation of the true King of Pop, Michael Jackson.  Wonderful representation of the Live and Legacy of a man named Michael Jackson.<br />Zita C Ost
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was an amazing book.  It looked at an often-explored topic in a completely different light.  It was heartbreaking but also joyous.  There were characters that were very recognizable and if you're lucky enough to have known a  Hans Hubermann in your life, then you will feel every emotion strongly and if you're not, then I think the book will make you wish you had and still feel the emotions.  This is a young reader book and I am 45 and think that it is much more intelligent and aware than many books targeted to &#34;adults&#34;.  I also think that it is an excellent read for young people.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|It does not crash on me, and I would recommend it. You can set timers which is helpful, and it is overall better than the other camera apps on the Amazon Store.
B00BQ4NLC8|5.0|Really enjoyed the characters and the way they developed throughout the book.  Amazing parallels with the Berlin  Wall.  Makes you think about your own life.....
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is an exceptional one becuse it helps to understand spirituality in a very scientific way, not to mention, helping the readers to test the truths through self conducting experiments. It fills the reader with very positive thoughts and lays the foundation for leading a very successful life. Its a must read.  Thank you Pam.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Looking back at the seasons the cast, style ect. has evolved and progressed into better and smoother episodes.  I would not miss a season and look forward to Castle turning into one of the long running and successful shows.  It certainly has the potential.
B00D1X0576|1.0|First off how are you going to have an app where the about page is not in English,second this app does not explain much as far as results,and finally not everyone in this country wants to be able to speak Spanish I wouldn't recommend this app.
0393316041|5.0|WOW what a dynamic individual. This is absolutely a book to read.<br />Without knowing it I use a lot of Richard's philosophy: Do not trust research. Go back and verify. Empirical evidence trumps the &#34;accepted&#34; evidence. There is a story about Beta decay in here that everyone should read. If you understand its implications and you apply that one lesson to your career, you will be looked upon as a great person in you field of study.<br />I loved this book.
B00BH0VSM6|1.0|It was confusing and poorly written.  I have heard that this author is popular, but after reading this book, I struggle to understand why.
0307387178|5.0|WOW. A powerfully written story. For parents, there are some serious lessons here.<br />I thought the kid in the story was quite selfish. However I can understand why he did what he did.<br />In the end, it sounded like he realized his mistake, but it was too late.<br />What I took away from this story though is that this kid, right out of college made a serious impact on the lives of the people he touched. We, as parents, also need to &#34;listen&#34; and internalize what our kids are trying to verbally and non-verbally communicate to us.<br />I recommend the reader read this book, and THEN watch the movie. Don't watch the movie first, it won't make as much sense.<br />You can read it in one or two evenings.<br />Go online for some of the pictures that are floating around. They're also interesting.
B000MRNWII|5.0|This is a breathtaking DVD & CD. I saw it by accident a few years ago on PBS and couldn't wait to buy it. Since then, I've had the pleasure of seeing Mariza in concert 4 times as she's been on tour in America. It's difficult to describe the emotions her singing evoke. Needless to say, you don't need to understand Portuguese to be swept away by her passion and the unbelievable artistry of her musicians.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It's not often we get to see one of Stephen King's characters develop this completely. It is years later and the events from The Shining have left permanent scars on Danny. His aimless wanderings finally bring him to a small town in New Hampshire  where he finds some peace through AA and a job in a hospice where he finds his gifts can help people pass into a calm death.<br /><br />He establishes a psychic bond with a young girl named Abra, whose powers exceed even those of Danny. Things go on peacefully until Abra becomes noticed by the True Knot, a group of nearly immortal psychic vampires who survive by absorbing the essence of powerful psychics released when they experience torture and death. When they come after Abra, Danny must find a way to help her survive their evil intentions at any cost.<br /><br />Although this is a sequel, it is quite readable as a stand alone novel, supplying background when needed.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Anxious to read JK Rowling's first non-Harry book.  As a Brit familiar with small-town living, the themes were familiar and dealt with humorously and with pathos.  I read this as an e-book on holidays and have to admit to taking a trip into a bookshop to make sure my download hadn't been truncated, because I didn't think the book had an ending...  I still don't!
B00AO3K01C|5.0|I could not put this book down. I'm still not sure if it is fiction or true story and given the discussions about quantum physics, it is very likely both.<br />The book has everything: beautiful writing, characters you quickly care about, interesting science, complicated love, terrible history, philosophy from east and west, powerful natural settings. I'll recommend this book to everyone I know.
B0070Z4LLW|5.0|Excellent PREQUEL to the original &#34;Thing&#34; by John Carpenter.  Unfortunately many movie-goers didn't realize (ostensibly due to the same title being used) that this was a prequel and not just a remake.<br /><br />It offers a bit more insight into things dealing with the alien life-form and does a wonderful job of perfectly matching the scene found by the US scientists in the first movie upon their arrival at this Norwegian base.  This movie is basically what happened at the Norwegian base where they first discovered the creature.<br /><br />Very well done, full of scares and great special effects.  Highly recommended to fans of sci-fi horror and the first movie - in fact, if you liked the first movie, this is very nearly a must-watch film.
6305428042|5.0|My boyfriend and I live in the Caribbean and have not been home for Fall time/Halloween/Thanksgiving in 2 years.  I was feeling rather depressed at the fact, since it's my MOST FAVORITE season.  Last year, the school he attends played it for the students and I got to watch it and was thoroughly satisfied.  The movie people disbanded, so I did not expect to get to watch it this year.  AND we don't have cable here, so there was no watching it on Fox family.  I was extremely surprised on the day before Halloween when this movie arrived in the mail!  I have been watching it since it first came out, way back in 1993 or whatever and find that it is one of my favorite parts of Halloween.  It's a true classic and obviously, hasn't got old.  5 stars, of course!!!
B00FEN000S|5.0|Probably my most enjoyed movie of last year.  It may not be an &#34;Oscar winner&#34; or &#34;buzz-worthy&#34; but it was sheer fun, sheer excitement and a blast to watch.  Pacific Rim is why movies are made - to show us stuff that our imaginations want to see on the big screen!  Excellent movie.<br /><br />The HD version of this has some nice extra features but nothing terribly unusual or extraordinary.  Still, it's a good value all things considered.
B003OPUZYY|5.0|I have been looking to upgrade the sound quality of my Ten Years After collection.  I have the American CD pressings of the albums included here.  The sound of those CDs is reasonable; but lets be honest here, they were released in the late 80s and early 90s.  CD mastering techniques have improved since then.<br /><br />Think About The Times  represents current CD audio mastering, and is not part of the loudness war.  You will hear each instrument clearly  and in proper balance.  It's the quality of the audio on this release that adds to its value.  The other value is you get 5 complete albums and a few extra single edits and B sides on one package.<br /><br />The packaging is a little skimpy.  However, back in the day to have bought these titles on vinyl, you would have had an album in a sleeve with only a front and back cover anyway.  That type philosophy is apparent here.  The front and back  album covers are reproduced with credits for each.  Liner notes for Ssssh are printed as well.<br /><br />So for those looking for quality remasters of Ssssh, Cricklewood Green, Watt, A Space In Time and Rock & Roll Music To The World - look no further you have found them here.  The songs live and breathe with ambiance and presence.  The inner notes credit Peter Mew for the remastering on this set, simply put, he got it right.  I know you will enjoy his work here.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Very good gameplay additions and tweaks, fun merging of the two properties.  Rovio is right on track with this enjoyable little game.
B008JFUNJQ|4.0|Having heard so many mixed reviews, I took a gamble with this movie, expecting yet another massive disappointment. I had read Ender's Game many years ago, it actually being my gateway to science fiction, and was doubtful this was the type of book that would even translate well into a film version. Beneath the storyline is a deeper meaning that I was dubious as to whether anything Hollywood got their filthy paws on might survive.<br /><br />To an extent, there was a major element of summer blockbuster written all over this film, and the plot did suffer from oversimplification - or rather, Ender's motivations were, but no more so than what would occur in any book adapted for the screen. While we lose that process of introspection which is what ultimately made the book so thought provoking, an excellent job was done with keeping true to the book's overall theme, and I was actually astounded by the job Gavin Hood did with the screenplay. It was also apparent how much Orson Scott Card contributed to this effort, as a tremendous amount of the emotional content of the novel has translated so well here. There was a depth beyond the CGI that I was truly impressed to see, so any minor nuances of the story that were lost are easily forgiven by the entertainment value and considerable respect given to the source material.<br /><br />A word on Asa Butterfield, who was an actor I was not at all familiar with beforehand. His performance was sheer brilliance, and how he conveys the inner workings of the mind of a child with a supremely disciplined intelligence beyond his years, does speak volumes of his talent. As for Harrison Ford, I had all but given up on him ever appearing in anything worthwhile again, so was delighted to see a classic performance from him, and fully intend to view this movie a second time, just for the acting. It was astounding, from the visuals, to the casting, to the nuances of character that seemed to have been picked up on so well by both director and cast, and one of very few films actually worth the aggravation and expense of going to the movies., and one of very few films actually worth the aggravation and expense of going to the movies.
B008G3N71W|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It passed what I consider to be the two great tests of good erotica: arousal and amusement.<br /><br />For proof of the arousal factor, you only need to read the comment that I made having read the first few chapters.<br /><br />\\"As I read the first five chapters in my bed this morning, a monstrous new tower of British steel arose from my centre, which made The Shard look rather spindly. Such is the effect of Chloe Thurlow's writing upon her readers.\\"<br /><br />There were so many little snippets that made me laugh, buy each is set in its own context, so to quote them would have no appeal to the reader of this review. Such quotes would also rather spoil your own amusement as you read through the book for yourself.<br /><br />You can get a flavour of what the story is all about by reading the description. To go much further would be to start writing spoilers. However, I will say that, like all of Chloe's books that I have read, the storyline is so outrageously impossible that you start to get sucked into the fictional world that she creates around the Greta, and believe that all of this is actually happening to her, and that she is loving it.<br /><br />Allow me to add a two or three tasty morsels that I picked out to highlight for myself.<br /><br />\\"Tears filled her eyes. She was coming, coming, reaching down into the wells of her body. It was like a serpent sleeping inside her and when it was awoken it would spit out spurts of her precious juice. The creature had opened its eyes. Not yet. Not yet. She gasped breathlessly, her mouth gaping, the beat of her heart making her breasts swell and she squeezed her nipples until they stung. Sex and pain. Waves of pleasure surged through her, from her burning buttocks, up her backbone, down through the looping crevices of her sopping pussy.\\"<br /><br />The rest of that passage gets even hotter. Believe me!<br /><br />\\"Their lips met and Greta knew that she would always prefer kissing girls. Theirlips are softer, smoother, more inventive.\\"<br /><br />Fair point!<br /><br />\\"Clothes, after all, are merely an option. Girls are at their best naked: nature's best design shown to best affect [sic].\\"<br /><br />One has to agree with that sentiment.<br /><br />There are a few little slips, typos or misuse of words, but they don't distract too much from a story, dependent on gender, will play tents with your trousers or dampen your knickers. I guarantee those effects.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Love this app! Use beautiful clothes, jewelry &amp; makeup to create your very own princess. Take a pic and post it on Facebook or save it in your photos.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Great addition to our Christmas collection.  The DVD has a fireplace picture at the end that plays for a long time with music, nice for Christmas morning while opening packages!  Check out their other cd's as well
B00785P2QC|3.0|This game is something to pass the time with but can get boring fast. Also a lot of buildings require investment points which are annoying to earn.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Definitely worth the $ wish there were more like this quality wise. Gameplay is smooth and the replay value is there.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I will always buy Sir Paul McCartney albums no matter what because he is my idol. I adore him. This NEW album is very good, I like most of the songs. Paul is the greatest musician for me.
0345803493|5.0|Love theses books. They read so easy and the story line is amazing!!!!! Can't wait for the movie to come out.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I like Paul doing old standards. I knew he can do anything other than rock and roll. I always acquire Paul McCartney albums because he is my idol since I was 14 years old.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|good game, but gets very hard if you don't purchase stuff I have tried it dozens of times and even though it's really fun that just bugs me a lot
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It just works. Plug it in download the app to your device. Config was a breeze. And just start casting YouTube and other video services.
B00005B1W5|5.0|I love this DVD. It contains beautiful songs some of them carry an oriental tone. To me this is the best Yanni concert... by far...
B0079R8KXG|5.0|I Got it for my kindle fire and it works well. I really like the color and how it looks.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Simple to use. If you forget to set your regular clock you can program his to have a repeately set, and has a timer along with it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its on kindle and love it it does take a few minutes to load before you play each round but other than that LOVE IT
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I wish I could put no stars. So disappointed! Will never read again! I was so excited because I loved the first two books. Now I don't know if I will go see the movie just because I know how horrible it will all end...
B000U0F7RG|4.0|I love this show!  I joined it late in the series - I found it on ABC Family.  I find it a bit confusing as to why the set is in a doll case.  I don't recall dolls a big item on the show.  Is this an homage to Lorelai's dollhouse? (It's a stretch)  The pics look like test shots, not something that was done specifically for the series set.  The case is ok, but I struggle to see the connection with the series.  Deducting one star for confusing packaging design.<br /><br />I purchased this 2 years ago from Amazon for $100.  Amazon was running a sale on TV series DVD sets and Gilmore Girls happen to be included.  Scored a great deal!
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|The first minute had full nudity. Totally unnecessary and gratuitous.  Turned it off within first minute of the film. Cannot recommend this film to anyone.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is Donna Tartt at the top of her game.  If you thought \\"The Secret History\\" was good, you're in for yet another  display of her considerable talent.  The only problem with \\"The Goldfinch\\" is that whatever you pick up next will seem like very thin gruel.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series. The acting and story lines are top notch and keep you wanting more. Can't wait for season four!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy this game use on Kindle..now all I need is pet rescue saga...when will that be available? Please keep them coming
B002RV01QI|5.0|What can I say that has not already been implied.  After all, it's Enya!  My absolute favorite in her generation and style of vocal delivery, Enya creations travel with me in my mind daily.  Just what you would expect from Enya.  A collection of timeless pieces carefully crafted and reproduced on this CD.<br /><br />Danielle Marie
B0022Y570K|5.0|Another amazing album from Volbeat. If you haven't purchased this yet get it now. Also a must see live band!!!!!!!
B000002KDO|5.0|Although their first two albums are so great, this album might be where the Bible-thumpers deemed them Satan worshipers. Sweet Leaf is great. So is Children of the Grave. Get it!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Totally hooked. I was very happy to see ccs finally. come to kindle. Way to go. Now if we could get frogger
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Great car charger. Couldn't ask for anything better really. It has two ports and works very well.  Good job everyone!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its fun. the mini games keep you entertained. but I think it takes too long to get points.. Especially when you get to the games that require more points for purchase
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Great ending to a great series!  The book is very well written and the true personality of the characters come to life.  It is action-packed throughout the book and I loved the love story between Aiden and Alex!  It's a must read.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|As always, I cried with laughter. Everyday things taken to hysterical heights. I'm so glad I bought this! Will read over an  over.
1609611543|5.0|My husband and I chose to go wheat free, after reading Dr. Davis's book.  We didn't change any other eating habits and my husband lost 25 lbs. and I lost 15.  We both feel better going wheat free.  On occasion we do have wheat, and we pay for it with a stomach ache later.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|A real fun and very additive game. Fun for the whole family. Great way to relax and have some fun at the same time.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This was one of my favorite books of all time.  The story was very unique and her style was interesting and held my interest.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Better interpretation than the Stallone version. If you've read the comic books, you would appreciate it more. I love this film.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|IMHO This not one of his great books. Score 4/10 rather hard to follow story line mid book. Not recommended!!!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This app is fun and free and with the addition of new vehicle s and stages what more could you ask for!
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|special effects where amazing decent acting  defently a transformer kind of movie but still had its own fell to it
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I'm surprised by the 5 star reviews. This book was terrible. Not only was the writing style completely different, it was lazy. The characters didn't even seem like themselves half the time. This culmination sucked almost as much as the Dexter series finale.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|movie was alright special effects where good but just  didn't really care for the acting movie kind of fell flat for me
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I thought it was easy at  but it very challenging on the higher levels. Was very addictive. Fun foe all.
B00EVW04PE|5.0|great action movie  and the special effects where really good acting was good not one bad thing to say about this movie
B00F35BV64|4.0|Loved the re-casting of Khan and the backstory that drives his actions. Makes him more understandable but no less threatening. The young Kirk and fellow principal crew members are believable as less experienced versions of our favorite Star Trek characters. The neverending desire for more extreme technical effects can sometimes overwhelm the storyline.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love candy crush!! I can't get enough of it! I hope more levels will be coming :) It's the best game I have played in a long time!!
B00BXZ3D6Y|4.0|I recently used this app to record several meetings I attended. One meeting was almost 3 hours long. I just hit the record button and it worked without any further adjustment. It stored the recording automatically. You can rename the files if you like and the audio quality was fine. If you are looking for more bells and whistles, this app is not for you. But to quickly record a meeting or conversation, I definitely recommend this one.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Tom Cruise is no Jack Reacher. It was so unrealistic watching &#34;short&#34; Tom Cruise play this part that at times is was purely comical.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Its addictive! I can't stop playing. And its challenging. The graphics are so clear, beautiful color. Its easy to use.<br />fun-fun-fun!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was a good read.  It kept my attention and did not seem as outlandish as some of Stephen King's novels.
B000P0J024|5.0|good  cd, all the best singers of my generation. fun loving cd. I listen to it all the time at home.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|excellent quality.  The packaging would make it a wonderful gift for any Harry Potter fan. The price is very good and I would reccomend this set.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|There is something immensely moving about having death being a narrator. It takes away the security of fatalism.<br />That's the beauty of this book. That characters are all beautifully developed, especially the narrator.
B000I9X53W|5.0|Its a brilliant classic. Classic Dustin Hoffman. Classic Teri Garr. Classic Bill Murray. The issues are just as relevant as today.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Such a deep portrait of what life can be like for those unlucky women born in a country ruled by fanatics.  God Bless America.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy to see it come to kindle<br />Been waiting for it for a while happy happy happy  candy crush crazy
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! been playing it on facebook for quite awhile now and hope that the fame expands the levels past 440 because I am past it around 450 I believe. having to go back on levels and trying to get 3 star on other levels. blah blah blah
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun, i could never stop playing.. It`s so fun and it` something anyone from any age can enjoy. Like me :)
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|disappointed with how impossibly difficult it is to connect Netflix to TV  using Silverlight.....still not done....any other options...no problems with You Tube...computer is a Mac
B002NJUN44|1.0|This movie was awful. The acting was horrid and did not do the book justice. I can't think of a worse movie.
B00GB7GX20|5.0|Beautiful! This is what music is suppose to be, meaningful and soulful! Celine is back and better than ever! &#60;3
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a very helpful book for any couple married more than a couple of years. There are several simple procedures for discovering your spouse's preferred love language. It will make a big difference to your spouse, which will make a big difference to you.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty fun game. Sometimes it lags a little on the treating game but it's fine once you go back to the main menu...well 90% of the time.
B00000I0XW|5.0|If you like Andrew Lloyd Webber and Sarah Brightman, you will like this CD very much. The selections are great.
B004GHEBGW|5.0|Guaranteed BBC quality. I had seen this series when I was a child and I can remember it was exciting. Now watching it again it offerd totally different aspects to follow. Absolutely enjoyable.
1250038820|5.0|Brandon makes me proud to be a native New Yorker, as he beautifully documents the vibrant spirit of some of the city's remarkable denizens. I would not be surprised if, after reading this marvelous book, a lot more people claim New York to be their home (even if they hail from Kansas!).
B001OQCV2E|2.0|This movie wasn't all that entertaining, nor did I think the directing was very good.  I recommend you pass on this one.
B001974DG0|5.0|Was a favorite of mine hard copy and only made sense to buy electronic so I can reread when I have nothing new to read.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Simply stunning work of fiction, laced with profound comment on life, love, art, and purpose.  I was swept into the drama immediately, and could not wait to continue to read.  It will enter my all-time favorites list, and be re-read eventually.  I can hardly wait.
B00006674X|4.0|This was the last movie Elvis made (except for his in concert documentaries) and it's at the top of my favorites list. I love Mary Tyler Moore, I think her acting ability stepped up the quality of this movie. And of course I love Elvis, I thought the concept of the movie was great. Still love watching Elvis after all these years.
B008N9AAQ4|3.0|In 1993, filmmakers Ron Fricke and Mark Magidson presented a deeply moving portrait of features universal to all human societies, warned of ecological collapse, and depicted how technology was changing our lives in [[ASIN:B001CDLATE Baraka]]. Shot on 70mm film, this was one of the most visually impressive films ever made, and its lack of any dialogue or narration allowed viewers to engage in their own individual reflections about the panorama on the screen. Two decades later, the team returned with SAMSARA, a sequel that wasn't really necessary.<br /><br />One reason that SAMSARA is not very good is that it often seems a shot-for-shot repeat of BARAKA. The filmmakers revisit many of the same locations (such as Thai prostitutes, a chicken-processing plant, home appliance factories, landfill gleaners). Again Buddhism, the Ka'aba and high church Christianity are depicted, but because the film does not go on to any other religions than what was on BARAKA, these rituals feel this time like cheap exoticism instead of unquenchable anthropological curiosity. SAMSARA also lacks the dramatic arc of BARAKA, coming across as a random succession of images instead of the journey from sacredness to horror and back that we found in its predecessor.<br /><br />That is not to say that SAMSARA is completely without interest. There is an astonishing clip of performance artist Olivier de Sagaza, and the freakish Dubai landscape is depicting in a detail that few (even those who have been there) have seen. SAMSARA  is all in all a darker film, and while depictions of the wreckage of Katrina, a Wyoming family that are proud to own an arsenal of guns, and a wounded veteran may fail to really shock viewers in the West who have already been exposed to such images for years, scenes of garish funerals in Nigeria and Indonesian men making the rounds in a sulphur mine (even though they know it is killing them) are stirring and memorable. Of course the visuals are rich, and in Bluray format on my HD projector the film is just as stunningly detailed as its predecessor.<br /><br />However, SAMSARA lacks enough new things to say, it surprisingly doesn't offer continual rewards on rewatching, and just by the fact that it exists out there it potentially dilutes the impact of BARAKA, once a singular film. I was entertained enough to give this a 3-star rating, but I would still recommend BARAKA, and even for those who have seen and loved BARAKA, I would not recommend moving on to this film.HD projector the film is just as stunningly detailed as its predecessor.<br /><br />However, SAMSARA lacks enough new things to say, it surprisingly doesn't offer continual rewards on rewatching, and just by the fact that it exists out there it potentially dilutes the impact of BARAKA, once a singular film.

B00ESNDQWY|5.0|For me this is probably the best show on a major network. I keep thinking it's going to run out of story line, but so far season 5 may be the best season yet.
B0021L8V0W|3.0|Everyone should watch and own this movie. I never get tired of it. It is a classic don't trust  anyone!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This thing is an epic failure. I picked it up in the hopes of being able to stream web programing to my TV. I got it up an running but when it came to stream it was a no go since Google does not support MS Sliverlight and of course the web programing I wanted to stream is using MS SIlverlight. And since I already have a PS3 and the Roku there was no reason to keep this device, so I packed it up and returned it to Best Buy. This device is a great idea in theory but the execution of it is sad with its limited app support and no MS Silverlight support.
B0017CW5J4|4.0|I think it's great this product!<br />It works great! is very practical!<br />Excellent graphics! pictures are great! dances are excellent!<br />Love the music it's like you are in the middle of a concert !
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great read by John Grisham. Loved it!!  Liked seeing Jake, Rex, and Lucien back together again. Could not put it down as is usual with Grisham's books.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|New to the game. I am really enjoying it but I have 0 friends. Please add me my ID is FAUMWIN.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great book.  Classic Steven King that keeps your interest.  You won't want to put it down and may even re-read it.
B00BZODDYU|5.0|The little girls, esp Lilly were great.  The story was cool and the ending annihilated me.  Mama it's as scary as they come
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|Disc plays well.  No skips or flaws in the sound that I can hear.  Music is subjective, that said, in my opinion this is EJ's best studio effort in quite a few years....Especially like the solo piano spots.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I did not realize just how much crap I had &quot;clogging&quot; up my memory space on my Kindle.  Love that this app cleaned it all up for me.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|I'm not a comic book aficionado.  I grew up with cartoons in the 1960's and 1970's and leaned more to DC Comics than Marvel, but even I had to say that up to the BATMAN re-boot with the Nolan Trilogy, Marvel films were better action and better stories.  But MAN OF STEEL comes up to bat and while it might not be a grand slam, it is certainly a home run.<br /><br />Zach Snyder and Christopher Nolan have added a new layer of complexity to the Superman storyline, while still allowing for character development, action, and a storyline that stays true to the original mythology.  Henry Cavill (Superman/Clark Kent), Amy Adams (Lois Lane; she had an appearance as a villain in \\"SMALLVILLE\\"), Michael Shannon (Zod), and Diane Lane (Martha Kent) all give great appearances in their roles, big or small.  Russell Crowe is a fantastic and very believable Jor-El; let's hope they can re-utilize him in future DC Comics/SUPEMAN/Justice League sequels.<br /><br />MOS is a unique film compared to previous Superman storylines.  From the 1951 \\"ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN\\" through the cartoons of the 1960's and 1970's to the 1978 SUPERMAN film with Christopher Reeve to the recent SMALLVILLE TV series, every showing of Superman has shown Superman advancing in chronological order, usually from birth/his appearance on Earth.  But MOS took a different tack which makes the film very interesting, where series of flashbacks (like dream sequences) from Clark's time on Earth are interspersed with the main storyline.  So you see a very young Clark in school, an adolescent Clark saving a school bus, an early-20's Clark working at a bar, Clark on a fishing vessel, and the death of Jonathan Kent (great performance by Kevin Costner) at different times in the film, seemingly popping up at random.  It accentuates the importance of these events in the younger Clark's life and tells the story of his time on Earth in a different perspective.  The ordering of the appearances fills in the blanks and makes the story arc of the Last Son Of Krypton riveting and appealing to those who already know the Superman mythology (which is probably most of us).  Very well done !!<br /><br />As for the movie itself:  Jor-El and Zod's relationship is dramatic and a new twist on Zod's megalomania; it is too bad they couldn't explore this in further detail or go back in time when they were strong allies (perhaps in a sequel?).  I have always thought that a story arc focusing solely on what happened with Jor-El/Zod and the rest of Krypton before the planetary cataclysm would have made for a great storyline.  The darker tone of MOS would have lent itself more to such a story (more so than the Kryptonian Council scenes at the beginning of the 1978 SUPERMAN movie).  Pay attention to the difference in Clark's tone and attitude toward his parents when he is complaining to Jonathan Kent about following in his footsteps as a farmer, and later in the movie when he goes after Zod for 'threatening his mother.'<br /><br />Lois Lane's relationship to Superman is introduced in a different fashion than in previous incarnations of Superman.  Another positive; the writers and producers stayed true to the basic Superman story arc but knew they needed a few 'changeups' to make this different to captivate the audience, besides the darker tone.  Perry White's character is much less interesting (and funny) than Jackie Cooper's portrayal in the 1978 film.  But if Lawrence Fishburne is OK with it, who am I to complain ?<br /><br />The ending has plenty of action, and the complaints by some that there is too much rock-'em-sock-`em action is a bit off base.  This isn't the BATMAN trilogy where you are dealing with a brilliant martial arts detective, you are talking about super-powered beings whose dense molecular structures are magnified probably 1 trillion-fold by the power of Earth's Sun.  The complaint about SUPERMAN RETURNS was that the trailers had most of the action and the movie had very little follow-up.  That isn't the case in MOS.  Even little things are accentuated, as this film pays attention to detail: check out Clark's eyes when he helps heals Lois' injury.  Nice touch !<br /><br />Plenty of extras are to be included in the Blu-Ray version of the movie:  behind-the-scenes, deleted scenes, etc.  The move lasts 143 minutes, which is rather long, but it flows very evenly.  The movie is laid out in such a way with different `story blocs'  that it flows better than if they had followed the chronology of the 1978 movie from Clark's rocketship appearance on Earth to the present.<br /><br />\\"MAN OF STEEL\\" is a great film in its own right and a worthy successor to the 1978 movie which was one of the biggest box office hits of the 1970's.  Some have commented that the ticket sales for MOS were disappointing, but it is possible that the SMALLVILLE TV series (ended 2011) and SUPERMAN RETURNS (2006) both dampened any pent-up demand for a successful and new version of the story.  BATMAN BEGINS was 8 years after the final George Clooney semi-camp Batman movie but the Nolan Trilogy didn't kick into high gear until THE DARK KNIGHT hit in 2008.  MOS did better than BATMAN BEGINS by almost 50%.  When THE DARK KNIGHT followed up BATMAN BEGINS 3 years later it more than doubled the earlier film.  One wonders if there was a Superman-only follow-up (instead of the rumored Batman-Superman \\"Justice League\\" hookup) if it could springboard on the first film's success and reach the levels of the 2nd and 3rd films in the Nolan Trilogy.  Looks like we'll never know, so let's hope Ben Afleck and the scriptwriters don't screw up the successor to MAN OF STEEL.

The last 2 albums were not even worth buying, but this album is one of Korn's best albums ever!!...in my opinion. I think it may have to do with Head returning to the band. The original Korn classic sound is heard in every song on this album. I thought I outgrew Korn since high school and really didn't think I would like this album, but I was surprised how much I love their music still today! You can tell they worked hard on creating this album. They deserve a lot of praise!

B008JFUS0U|5.0|The first Thor was a problematic film for me. I loved the actors, I loved the Jack-Kirby-perfect Asgard, but the film itself felt flat. Perhaps it was the rather disorganized plot, perhaps it was the way it followed the same strategy as films like Time Guardian and Galaxia, beginning in lush sci-fi locales but migrating to a small town to save money later on. Avengers further attached me to Hemsworth's Thor, and so I was really looking forward to seeing him get a grander, more developed outing. Thor: the Dark World does not disappoint.<br /><br />Once again, the source of troubles is another race of ancient magic aliens, this time the Dark Elves led by their king Malekith (Christopher Eccleston, still failing to buck that Doctor Who typecasting). The Dark Elves (who are more or less the Eldar from Warhammer 40,000 for all intents and purposes) are the longtime enemies of the Asgardians, but after an apocolyptic battle only a handful of them remain. Awakened by the coming alignment of all the worlds connected by Yggdrasil (they hyperspace network that connects all the worlds Thor and his pals hang out on) Malekith and his creepily masked flunkies set out to recover the Ether, a spooky living weapon that will blot out all light in the universe.<br /><br />Predictably conflict ensues. Through a series of accidents the Ether winds up living inside Thor's human sweetheart, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) where it will grow until it devours her. Defying Odin, Thor hatches a surprisingly cunning plan to dupe Malekith into removing the Ether from Foster so he can destroy the Elven leader and his weapon in one go. Things don't go so swimmingly, and it all comes down to a ludicrously silly, magnificently well-done battle across dimensions for the fate of the universe (with a tube ride through London in the middle).<br /><br />If, like me, you loved everything about Thor but just wanted it to be better, then this is the film for you. Thor and Foster's romance, forced and simplistic in the first movie, is played out well here. Asgard, before just a shiny setpiece, is now a well-built series of believable locations with an aged, lived-in feel to them. The Dark Elves, unlike the thuggish Frost Giants, have a technology and martial prowess that seems genuinely threatening. Baddie Eccleston does a decent enough job, although he lacks some of his scenery chewing prowess that we've seen in films like G.I. Joe and 28 Days Later. Even Foster's intern Darcy (Kat Dennings) is a tolerable comic presence this time around. And of course we get more Stellan Skarsgård, who is always fabulous.<br /><br />Real credit is due, however, to Tom Hiddleston as Loki. I felt sure that after two films as the big bad I'd be sick of him, but his turn as Thor's crafty, somewhat unwilling accomplice is meaty and exciting. You genuinely can't tell how much of his behavior is sincere and how much of it is buildup to some treachery- without giving too much away, even though Loki is on Thor's side in this film, he is by far a more dangerous force than Malekith. Just wait for it.<br /><br />Of course there are also some little tidbits thrown in at the end of the film to foreshadow future installments, which are now all but guaranteed to echo the Infinity Gauntlet storyline (as if seeing Thanos in Avengers wasn't a big enough clue). What this means for the next Avengers and other Marvel properties is anyone's guess, but color me excited as all get out.<br /><br />I can think of very few bad things to say about this film to counterbalance the good. Sif and the Warriors Three are still rather underused (but then Thor already has another super team) and Idris Elba's Heimdall is still solidly a supporting character (although he does fight a spaceship using parkour and stabbing, so that's pretty cool). There are also some effects that seem a little odd- a thrown boulder near the middle looks a little wobbly-fake, and in the climax Malekith grows to enormous proportions which is not really made clear until he starts fighting Thor. By and large, though, this is a very very good film, and the acting, writing and visuals are nearly above reproach.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Exactly like the first Thor only better<br />-Boasts a big sense of scale and tension<br />-Skilled cast elevates it above just a comic book movie<br /><br />Cons:<br />-A few wonky effects here and there<br />-Lacks the memorable, bombastic theme music we've seen in other Marvel films

B001RTSPVY|5.0|Very well written series.  Even my wife who doesn't like this kind of drama has been drawn into it, such that she asks all the time to see it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|So I made sure to buy this book the day of it's release, to make sure that I would not be affected by other reviewers. The reviews were already flaming, which should have been a red flag.<br /><br />There are many, many reasons why this gets only one star. The first as to be the POV switching. I know many have already stated it, but often I had to check who the POV was to understand what was happenig. Tris and Four read as the EXACT SAME PERSON. Who let this happen? The editors, Roth , the publishing execs? Seriously it read like some self published junk not a professionally distributed novel.<br />  This leads into the second problem: The desolation of Four.<br />There have been times when a characters actions make me go &#34;why did they do that?&#34; this for the first time actually made me think we were being tricked and Four was under a simulation/drug hallucination. Until the bombing that injure Uriah occurs. Then I truly thought Four was going to have his memory wiped or be left by Tris. Because that amount of idiocy convinced me he had been brain damaged in fsome previous scene we didnt read. No again, no to everything, a guy who supposedly only has four fears and can lead/teach others now has crippling inadequacy issues, is shamefully cowardly in owning up to his mistakes, and is obsessed with his parents. Complete character meltdown.<br />Which tacks onto the character meltdown of Tris. Previously a slightly violent, but selfless girl who is pretty sharp is turned into a psychological genius able to discern other character's flaws and abilities almost omnipotently. Still action oriented,but now so much so that she almost reads like a brainwashed operative. Where did all the conscious and humanity of Tris go? Apparently the same place Four's bravery and intelligence went.<br />To be honest this book was very hard to finish because I flipped between irritation and downright boredom so much.<br />I am trying to write this sans spoilers which is hard because the plot holes and inconsistencies are a huge part of the one star rating. Also these are the problems NOT counting the ending. It gets a one star review because by the time I got to the ending I just didnt care about the characters anymore. In fact the ending to Tris' story was fine by me, the character was already gone by the 65% anyways.<br />Which leads me to the ending. The first time I read it I actually thought it was a joke. Really, I foolishly thought there was going to be a super epilogue and we would find out it was all part of Four's fearscape or something. Wrong,wrong, wrong Allegiant goes out with something an author, who is obviously still very immature, considers &#34;shocking&#34;. Think Shonda Rhimes shocking but with almost no emotion, and absolutely no purpose. Instead I daresay the &#34;shocking&#34; part makes another huge plothole, and makes the main character entirely useless to the plot of the story.<br />Finally what really bothers me about this last book is that any sort of value, or meaning that could be taught by reading this trilogy is completely thrown out the widow.  Clearly this was just a money making effort by Roth though how she thinks anyone will read another series by her is beyond me.<br />Save your money, and dont waste your time.

B00ADQPB50|5.0|After missing the series on FX last year and hearing how great it was, couldn't wait for the dvd release.  Close to a year later, all I can say is it was more than worth the wait.

I'm tired of this Silas storyline and I'm getting ready to jump ship, but I keep hoping for a GREAT story to begin and grab ahold of me!  Sometimes the writers really drag out these stories just way too long!!  Let's move on from dobblegangers...please!!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Very slow start. Almost abandoned the book 1/2 way through. Once it picked up, it gripped me and I couldn't put it down. The last 30% was especially interesting. Not something I'll go out recommending to everyone I know... but worth your while and a good price.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|From the very beginning the book lures you in as mysterious and  intuitive. There are many times the author pulls you in only to discover that there is only more mystery ahead.<br />Thoroughly enjoyed the story line right up to the ending. Leaves one thinking past the story line.

B001BANK32|4.0|Pretty good.  Young and hungry Steve.  I read this at 16 and was very impressed by his technical innovation.  It holds up pretty well the second time around, far better than the movie.  Jack Torrance went crazy in the book.  In the movie Nicholson was crazy from the first scene.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got it for my son but now I'm obsessed with it. Great graphics and very realistic. The tasks are not too impossible.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  It's never boring although some of the levels are truly challenging and the 5 free lives go by quickly.  I would like to see this game available without being restricted to just 5 lives every few hours.  I'm not a fan of purchasing more lives and am not a big facebook user.  I would be willing to pay for the game in order to not be limited.  But, I still truly enjoy playing it and am willing to deal with the &#34;down side&#34;.
B00F1W1SS0|5.0|I'll try to make this brief. A quick note on the show.......the boys are in their usual top notch form. But you probably suspected that to begin with and is why you are here.<br />Originally, I posted a 3 star review of this show. Like many, I found the mix substandard for a band of this caliber. John P was overpowering and Jordy and John M were sometimes almost inaudible with Mike's mix coming in on the weak side. My first impression was based on the fact that the night I first popped this into my Oppo BDP95 player, it was after 11:00 pm and wifey was in bed so I had to keep the volume on the down low. This evening I finally had a chance to watch this again, this time with the volume cranked considerably louder than before. All I can say is this concert disc rocks. The sound is soooooo much better turned up. So do as the title of this review suggests and TURN IT UP........that is, if your system can handle it!<br /><br />BTW; just a side note. I noticed that John Petrucci produced the audio portion of this bluray so I have to think he listened to and approved the final version.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am happy now they have candy crush! This game is so addicting! I would really like if u get this app! :) :) :)<br /><br />  :)
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|Absolutely stunning - from the visuals, the music, and yes, even the acting. I am a HUGE fan of the book and believe this re-imaging of the story was very well done, but I did not expect it to match the book word-for-word either. Really enjoyed it in the theaters, and bought it on Blu-Ray 3D soon after it's release and enjoyed it just as much at home. If you enjoy the over the top style of Baz Luhrmann you will not be disappointed in this movie!

B009UAO1ZG|3.0|I found Those Angry Days to be a interesting and thought provoking walk through a small window of time in U.S. History.  Having been born shortly after WWII I was educated in a world of patriotism and American pride.  One never questioned the virtue of our involvement to free the world of Facism and terminate the final solution.  However, as Ms. Olson describes, hindsight is best.  After being \\"tricked into WWI\\" and living through 10 years of FDR's depression, many Americans really did yearn for the \\"normalcy\\" sought by Calvin Coolidge. (Coolidge's administration was not corrupt as Olson claims).  Opposition to entering the war was not just from the uninformed masses living outside of the northeast bastion of brilliance the author routinely labeled as \\"right wing\\" by the author.  There were some virtuous intellectuals at prestigious colleges who opposed involvement but they were simply uninformed but well intentioned.<br /><br />For me, the highlight of the story is the election of Wendell Willkie.  Here was a man who was a Democrat until 1939.  His pro war opinions agreed with FDR's private and unspoken thoughts but were out of step with the feelings of those \\"right wing\\" Iowa farmers who comprised the Republican party in Olson's opinion.  Olson describes how a handful of influential journalists and Democrats managed to get Willkie nominated at the 1940 Republican convention.  This is a fascinating story I  had never heard.  As a campaigner, Willkie promoted FDR's real feelings, lost the election and continued being the darling of the Democrats.  It sort of reminded me of the popularity of John McCain with liberal writers prior to the 2008 campaign or even Chris Christie today.  The threats of extortion of Willkie's affair silenced him from criticizing FDR who just laid low and let Willkie and Democrat operatives clear the way for a third term.<br /><br />Finally, the image of FDR and his fire side chats always led me to ascribe a high quality of leadership to this man. Ms. Olson dispels that myth and paints this president as incapable of being decisive or taking responsibility for anything.  Reminds me or our current president.  The author states that Robert McCormick - owner of the Chicago Tribune... \\"had nothing but contempt for anybody or anything east of the Mississippi\\". (pg. 229) As an aside, Chicago IS east of the Mississippi river. I'm not sure if people living in Washington know thatman.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|Incredible. This is not at all just a book that provides encouragement for women to lean in the workforce but a book that encourages both women AND men to lean into what they have passion for, to recognize that there is still significant barriers, ginger bias, and poor policies that need to be changed. It inspires both women and men to be a part of changes that are significantly larger than individuals, but fair treatment women globally.  This is MUST read for both men and women - who work inside or outside the home.

B005K17RU0|3.0|Loads up slow and is constantly stopping to update or load advertisements. I use it to check multiple cities so not sure if this is why. Didn't have the problem with the old app.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I Don't have, would like it, but why do I not have it??  Advise please  lll lll lll lll lll lll lll
B00F91H15W|1.0|It is worth viewing if free and you have the flu and need to lay around. Its boring and brainless. Its ironic that these teens suffer the same malady as their director. They are searching for their version of stardom in a self-absorbed noncreative manner. The message is obvious and the director uses cheap tricks. It has gotten attention because of her famous father.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Where did this come from?  I don't recall having it on the Kindle except it might have come with it and I deleted it.  Tom is a favorite but I don't need to read it again
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I love a book that keeps me riveted to what's going to happen next, and that was partly due to the changing focus of the chapters between the 3 central characters.  I have already recommended this book to several people.  I will be looking for other books by Liane Moriarity.
B00CDY6HW6|2.0|Another not sure of how to play, maybe it is for kids and my older age can't enjoy it.  Be nice to take it off my Kindle
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|Well I thought that this app would let me take pictures from the back of the camera. That is all there is on the Fire HDX is a front camera where all you can do is take photos of yourself. Bad. I wanted to be able to aim the camera at something to take pictures. The help person had me download this app but them told me it would not work with the HDX. So I deleted the app.<br />What in the world where they thinking when they only put a camera on the front???
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|Bad acting. Unbelievable terrible movie with liberal agenda and i like the two leads. Waste of time and money.  Dont do it.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Kept thinking she was going to give up and she didn't which made me all the more drawn to what she had to face next........what a journey she had, physically, mentally and emotionally.........hooray for her reaching her goal.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I won't spoil the ending but things should not have ended the way it did. Once I got to a certain bad spot I couldn't even finish reading for awhile because I was so unhappy. The writing was great otherwise.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I enjoy this game because I can play without having to purchase anything to continue. You just have to wait a little while for your energy return.  You earn the things that you need to play. I must admit that the more you progress through the levels, the more challenging it becomes. No matter how many times you have explored a photo, you can still fail.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|This game is fun and really easy to play! The graphics are cute and I haven't had any problems with the game yet either. Sometimes I wish the crops would grow a little faster but otherwise I love this game! I like the fact that you don't have to connect to Facebook to get neighbors for your farm too. If anyone would like to add me as a neighbor my Farm ID is FAUOCIE!
B00G4PX1MO|4.0|An amazing and fun game well worth the 3 dollars. But a lot of stuff in the game wants you to pay more money. And a lot more I might add. But is a very fun and addictive game. Recommend 100%
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|Star Trek Into Darkness Blue-Ray 3D+Blueray+DVD  This is a very good movie and full of action.  I remember seeing it for the first time and being SO SHOCKED!!!!!WHAT NOOOOOOO NOT JAMES T KIRK Any how.  This is a good movie and you should see it. Spock and Ohoura have a big lovers tiff even with him being a Vulcan! No something for everyone even romance.  Good movie.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|What a great, simple device to use! Great for Play movies, YouTube and Play music. Will be even better once more apps can access its functionality.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|if your buying this you know what it is and why you should buy it, its almost 10 years old now still great. the original HD nature show with david attenbourough
B00B2G4O2G|2.0|I was happy to find this series because I really like Kevin Bacon and the genre was right up my alley. I enjoyed the first episode with only a few instances of lazy writing. Where you think, for a split second or longer, that it defies common sense for what just happened to have happened. As each episode progressed those glaring, shattering leaps from point A to point Z derailed the good acting and a passable concept. I am really getting tired of them making a serial killer into some super Machiavelli but I could have tolerated that. I finally gave up when they showed a woman scrambling to unlock a deadbolted door to escape her captor who was running down the hall towards her and she left it standing wide open so he could run through it without even slowing down.
B00902AKK4|5.0|This is a great game it's fun and challenges you. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. So get the game play and have.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I can no longer log in because it says I need to update but yet there is NO update available in the Appstore for the kindle fire hd... PLEASE fix this soon
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I like candy crush but after 5 minutes you die and have to wait 30 minutes for one life. Then when we sleep for hours the maximum lives we get is 5. I would totally give it a 5 stars if it wasn't for that.
1609611543|5.0|I didn't think I needed to read this book -- I've already been very happily wheat-free for over 2 years -- but I'm glad I did. \\"Wheat Belly\\" offers the most convincing arguments to date of why everyone (not just those diagnosed with celiac disease) should try going without grains. Perhaps, like me, you'll feel so much better that this way of eating will be a pleasure, not deprivation.
B00DJ80VMM|4.0|I've been listening to Dream Theater since 1992 and have seen them live at least twenty times.  I like this album much batter than the previous release with Mike Mangini.  The songs are better, almost echoing the early 90's.  However I am not thrilled with the production on this album.  Something doesn't sound right.  The drums don't sound good at all.  Since 1997, Dream Theater albums have been self-produced by Portnoy and Petrucci, but Portnoy's input is definitley missing.  Something is &#34;off.&#34;  Overall, though, this is probably their best release in a few years.
B006TVQTHW|5.0|This is an awesome computer case whether you are a gamer or simple building a home office computer. It has plenty of room to work inside, rolled edges on all metal parts, and is easy to open up using the thumbscrews. Several options for adding additional fans. Bottom mounted power supply with filter, space for numerous hard drives and DVD drives.
B00499QUK2|5.0|FANTASTIC UPDATE OF THE MUCH BELOVED DETECTIVE.  LOVE THE FACT THAT WATSON USES AN IPAD AND BLOGS.  BOTH SHERLOCK AND WATSON ARE BRILLIANT
0385350864|5.0|Couldn't keep silent seeing so many negative reviews on the book. So here is the thing:  Yes, it is shocking and it doesn't tell the story all women wanted to read. What we wanted was to see the story of a happy life Bridget and Mark had together, how their family grew through all the good and bad moments. We wanted to see Bridget happy and settled because that would give us a feeling that everything would be perfect with our relationship too in the end.  What we got - unhappy and broken Bridget 50+, two kids. Mark was killed and she's been struggling ever since. Yes, the story isn't about what we've expected but life doesn't usually go as planned, it can be s***ty sometimes - that's what's happened to Bridget. Stop throwing negative comments, girls, do care to read the book till the very end - Bridget is as strong as she's never been before and the book is great.  It is. Once you stop complaining about Mark Darcy and finally let him go. Bridget did. Why don't you, girls, do the same?
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Great album. This intro record is outstanding. Such soul for such a young artist. This will be a music career to watch.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The title says it all although I wish it is exactly how it is on Facebook with the extra moves and stuff like that but it's still good love it!
B0010YPTGU|5.0|I Love Bocelli and this concert is the best. His guest are great and the setting magnificent. I really enjoy this DVD
B008MM9630|4.0|The quality of this is amazing! The visual, the choice of characters, and the creativity is absolutely stunning. There are so much vivid colors that I actually enjoy playing! I love how the energy bar is sufficient enough for you to complete tasks without having to wait a long period of time for it to fill up because there are lots of games that also uses the energy, but it's very minimal and would result in finishing only one or two missions. The missions in this game is very simple, easy, quick, and self-explanatory. I would've played this game till the end of my time!<br />  However, there is a few things that scored me so much that I had to delete the game. There are times where it would close down. That didn't bother me much because there are lots of other games that have the same issue. The thing that ticks me off the most was the coordination. Whenever you place something it would jump to another spot other than the one you wanted. It happens for every single little tiny thing! And that frustrates me to death because trust me, you're going to be placing and planting a lot of things in a fan game. I don't know if it matters, but I have a Kindle Fire. That's my only big fit about this game so that's why it's a four stars. Truth to be told I would've put 3.5 if I could.
0743270754|3.0|Kearns Goodwin’s prose is execrable. Too many of her sentences are cobbled together with quotations, a technique that’s annoying and unnecessary. There’s only so much of that one can take!  (What’s wrong with paraphrasing with appropriate attributions in footnotes, Doris? ) It took me about 4 chapters to get past her overuse of this technique.  Another annoyance is the amount of time she spends on the rivals’ respective childhoods and family lives. Talk about chucking in the kitchen sink along with everything else. (Doris, just because you’ve read everything doesn’t mean you have to include it all because what you end up with is a whole lot of repetition and exasperated readers.  Choice, apt, relevant selectivity wins the day.)<br /><br />If you choose to read this tome, don’t expect much in the way of analysis. It’s a narrative history that marches  chronologically forward and remains relatively uncritical of its stars - Lincoln and Seward. Kearns Goodwin casts a critical eye over the professional performances of rivals Chase, Bates, and Stanton but for the most part leaves Seward’s perilous shortcomings as Secretary of State (particularly during the first couple of years) unexamined.<br /><br />I appreciated much of the information regarding life during this critical period in America’s history, particularly the life within the White House, the difficulties Lincoln experienced with his military commanders, and most of all the evolution of the attempts to resolve the issue of slavery.  It also achieved what it’s title promises - an account of Lincoln’s political genius.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm glad I downloaded this game. It's a lot of fun! It's not easy but it's not so hard that you can't figure it out. I wish more levels would be added!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Great product. I plan to continue using it. I like that I can set the volume. The blue color on the digital setting is nice too.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|I bought this movie based on the fact that I really like Liam Neeson as a actor.  He does a great job in any movie that he makes.  When I watched the movie the first time I wasn't sure just how much I liked it, but unless I really dislike a movie I always give it a fair chance.  The second time I watched it I was more impressed with the movie in it's entirety because of the theme of human survival against all odds. I have watched it several times since and I've decided, as I related to each character who told their own story, although not in depth. that it was a well acted movie.  All the actors in this movie did a great job!
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I closed this book about fifteen minutes ago, and I kid you not my eyes are STILL red and puffy. I'm so incredibly sad that this is the end, but I'm also so incredibly happy that it ended this way. If you follow my blog, you know that I don't read very many series endings. The reason being, the final book is just so hard to get right. You have to tie up every loose end and answer any and every question the reader may have. And then, with the last ending I read *ahem* Allegiant *ahem* I was seriously disappointed. I wanted to strangle everyone afterwards. So I waited a week before starting this ending. I needed some time.<br />&#34;Most of our problems stemmed from the gods' boredom.&#34;<br />pg. 43<br />But I don't even know why I was worried. JLA has done it again. This book is just as action packed as the rest of the series. The war is coming, and coming fast. Alex's army and the gods are getting desperate and come up with a spine tingling solution. Something I truly wasn't expecting. JLA has created another epic, nail biting, page turner.<br />&#34;Have you ever heard of a bra?&#34; I demanded. &#34;Because I see your... you know. Everything.'&#34;<br />pg. 49<br />As for the characters, Alex was definitely not as snarky as her &#34;normal&#34; self. Its quite obvious that she's grown so much throughout the series. And then there's Aiden. Oh gods, Aiden I love you! He is (and I'm sure always will be) my #1 Book Boyfriend. He was still so sweet, caring, loving, and strong. He did everything he could to make sure Alex was ok. She was always his main priority. And then, there's Seth. I applaud him. I doubted him for a LONG time, but in the end, he did what he had to do. Everything he did throughout the entire series was done for a reason.<br />&#34;'What is it with gods and leather?&#34; I muttered. [He] slid me a long look. &#34;We make it look good.&#34;.&#34;<br />pg. 166<br />Last but not least, that ending tore me apart. Guys, if you're anything like me, grab your tissues. As I discussed with Jen from Jenuine Cupcakes, I HATED the ending, but it completely makes sense. After the war that took place, its only right that things happened that way. But it still didn't stop me from being a blubbering mess. I wasn't happy about it ending that way, but only for my own personal selfish reasons. It actually made sense that it happened that way.<br />&#34;It was a beautiful day for a war.&#34;<br />pg. 247<br />In short, this was a great ending to one of my favorite series. I'm sad to see it end, but I'm also already looking forward to reading it again. I promise you, Alex's world will be a hard one to leave behind.your tissues.

B00FWLSLJ4|1.0|Do not watch this movie, it's not worth the $5 HD nor the $4 SD, it's not even worth $1.50 at redbox.  It's just a BAD movie.... bad, bad, bad... so bad.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book was surprisingly better than I anticipated.  I typically am not into the love sex novels.  But the story line and plot kept my attention.  Always anticipating what will happen next.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Each book in the Mortal Instruments series has been increasingly better than the last. City of Glass brings explanations and resolutions to some of the plot lines that were desperately needed. I enjoyed this book a lot, and while it was predictable at times, I never lost the desire to keep reading and find out where the story would take me.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast does everything I expected it to, and does it very well. My only complaint is that the number of apps that support streaming to Chromecast is a bit limited at the moment. It also doesn't support admittedly crap technologies such as Silverlight. Still, if you want a great yet simple and cheap streaming device, this is a great buy.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|My problem is with my computer. It is windows vista, so installing chromecast is not recommended. I am keeping the chromecast and getting a new computer asap. Looking forward to easy streaming from a new laptop.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|GREAT movie and I am not usually a zombie fan.  These zombies are very quick and the sound they make is terrifying.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Very good game I would recommend it to everyone that likes action games &amp; I would recommend it to all of my friends.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app worked ok beyond some glitches but forced me to update even though I tried before and it didn't work and more it won't even open. Uninstalling.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game Its like having a real horse but not really. It is really Great for horse lovers
B008D28HYS|5.0|Update: Still playing this game over a year later. Had to change devices and lost my progress, but it was fun going back and doing them again. I thought it would be easy re-doing puzzles I'd already solved, but it was just as challenging the second time. Still a five star game! This is one of the most fun puzzle games I've played in a while.  It can take me hours to figure out the picture, and I am always excited when I finally finish it.  It is challenging without being frustrating, which keeps me coming back for more.  Good job, Dynamix!
B000SEIDR0|5.0|Same thoughts and feelings for this book as with defense of food. More information about our society than I ever expected to learn. I recommend this to everyone…it is not political only realistically fact based.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Scariest movie I have seen in years. I love horror and become bored easily. Not with this movie!!! I loved it even after having dreams about it for days...
B000IFQLLY|5.0|Its Depeche Mode……either you love them or hate them or possibly don't know their music , if which is the case…get this album and learn their full range of music and take a wild ride in music appreciation.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Ordered 2 of these and they quickly despatched and arrived rather promptly. Items were well packaged and in good order as I have come to expect from Amazon. Extremely easy to setup, just plug into HDMI socket and use either USB slot or provided plug to power the device. Software setup is via website or through chromecast app and its all rather easy (took about 5mins). Its definitely a more enjoyable way to watch YouTube listen to music on TV. For $35  its a great little device but several months since announce Google has done little too expand its capabilities (or at least I haven't seen improvements).So much potential but something needs to be done by powers that be to realise it. I hope it doesn't end up like the revue or nexus q.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Great fun! Keeps me busy for hours, and the best part is I don't need space to put them together!
B00D5O7BPU|3.0|Good game if you like old guns scantily for wold war two gun teaches y p.o. u how t p.o. us all of then heart good go o d job at smacking the app just needs to be u updated more often
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|Cute story but predictable.  I can not believe how similar it was to several other movies about seniors in retirement homes.
B005FPT51K|5.0|This works great! Easy to install. Bought it for our new pup. She has some separation anxiety so we've been trying a few things to calm her when we leave. This lets me see her on my iPhone even when I'm not within range of our network. I love it. The clarity in low light is great. I haven't bought speakers, but that's my next step.
B007FH9GA6|3.0|I downloaded this for a flight to California from Florida. Maybe if I watch it again I will get more out of it.  I loved the book and was anxious to see the movie...as with most books made into films, the character development was nearly nil.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I honestly just think it could've or should've ended differently. Still a great book and series, but was expecting a different outcome.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love Candy Crush and cannot stop playing it.  I get stuck on levels for weeks and quit playing only to pick it back up and get addicted all over again.  Don't start playing it if you like having free time!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Easy read, not too deep or complicated.  Likable characters in an easy flowing plot.  Everything gets cleaned up neat and tidy in the end.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|This my favorite album every I love every song from it Paramore will always be one of my favorite bands in the whole wide world and even when I`m dead I love Hayley, Taylor, and Jeremy
B007EC27QM|5.0|I've been using this app for a over year and I love it. The free version is just as good. I actually only upgraded to this version when it was the free app of the day on Amazon :)
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|This was a great album loved the songs Paramore is one of favorite bands I love Hayley, Taylor, and Jeremy
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Once again I have stayed up way too late finishing a Grisham book. This one will keep you guessing until the very end. Highly recommended!
B000PTYPAC|3.0|It was sent to my house and there was a big crack in the back of it and I could~nt return it because I had already taken  the plastic wrap off before seeing it so now I can say &#34;I purchased an album from Amazon with a big crack in the back of it&#34;.
B0060FXBNM|3.0|The Last movie was a shame. For real should of kept Megan Fox at least she could act the chick that replaced her was not good at all or even Good looking.<br />If that would not of happen I would of liked the series more.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell scores again with The Bone Bed.  Kay Scarpetta at her finest.  The story ebbs and flows as smoothly as the tides.  You don't want to miss this exciting new chapter in the Scarpetta saga.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great characters, acted well and the continued storyline that holds together. When I watch it, I love getting lost in Downton.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Fantastic idea. It will only get better over time. I've noticed that sometimes it slows down playback. At first I thought it was because was using the USB port on my TV set to power it. But it still happens using a normal electric outlet. But even with that been said I still give this product a 5 star. Because I do believe this is software related and with the proper time it will be fixed.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|get all the linking games! this one is the best though!!!!!!!!!! it has the best makeup and dresses! get it now!
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|Great movie.  My 11 year old son watched it twice and  He said it was better than the first.  A must have for your Disney collection.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Lousy app that's a pain to run, clunky interface and keeps pushing out ads.  Its now deleted from my tablet
193700788X|1.0|If you like reading about making casseroles and checking the mail, this book is for you.  Most of the book is like Food Network meets Murder She Wrote with a dash of Scooby Doo.  Dead Ever After is a parade of old characters driven by nonsensical motivations to carry out cartoon-worthy murder and kidnapping plots. At one point, I thought Wile E. Coyote might have hatched the idea to grab Sookie and spirit her away in an ACME van.  Charlaine Harris then punishes readers with a final sex scene that sounds more like a hilarious and sweaty industrial film than the fulfillment of years of tension and unrequited love. It truly read like it might have been written by a 15 year old boy after reading his dad's Penthouse stash...or maybe a Mutual of Omaha documentary about rutting wildebeests narrated by a cast member from MTV's Jersey Shore.  Decidedly unsexy.  Just don't read it.  Your life is more interesting than this book.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Like others have said, this nails the look and feel of the show, so kudos for that. However, it quickly becomes apparent that it's going to take *forever* to earn ponies. It's far too difficult to get gems, hearts, and element shards (I eventually gave up largely because I was overrun with kindness parasprites and absolutely *never* found a single kindness shard) and the prices for most ponies are ridiculous, even when you don't have to pay real money to get them. So good for a little bit, until it gets to the point where it stops being fun (which for me was about when I had to get Rarity). Still, it might be good if you luck out and manage to avoid a parasprite problem and don't expect to make any real progress any time soon after a certain point.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Upbeat, energetic, soulful - I found a new genre I love! I hope she comes out with more albums soon.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|The characters were brought to life and their anguish was felt by the reader.  Unfortunately love does not conquer all and the idea of living a totally dependent life was out of the question for the long haul.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is educational, entertaining, and fun to read. I highly recommend it to all who are interested in metaphysics.
B00BKZUVGM|1.0|I really loved the book but I would recommend not reading the last book and only imagine what happens ( I promise you it will be a lot better than the book) No writer should ever kill the main character, it just seemed like she was in a rush to end the book , please Veronica Roth wright a new ending that doesn't make everyone sad and depressed :/ but don't get me wrong the book was amazing I just hatted the ending and I don't think it needed to be there.... It just such a sad ending to a wonderful set of books. I also really hope the director of the movie (when it comes out ) for this book will choose a different ending :( I cryed to much in this  and now I just won't a hot chocolate ...
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Good storyline but it could have been a little more detailed.  I liked the way it moved between different places and back quickly.  I did find it gave more room for imagination and enjoyed the odd characters.  It could have been longer.  Overall a good  light read.
B005LAII44|4.0|Not as good as the first one, but theres alot of action, cant wait for the third movie to come out
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It is an awesome game.It is also a great game if u like fighting.It is a very fun and challenging game.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Awesome, I loved it<br />It was awesome<br />Can't wait to see the movie<br />Awesome book. Thanks Suzan Collins can't wait to read the book.
B00EK0UBPU|1.0|I'm struggling to read it as it is pedantic and hard to follow. I'm very disappointed considering it won the Man Booker prize this year. The author's love of archaic language is a big problem. I consider that I have a good vocabulary but find I'm looking up far too many words for no good reason.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|It is really interesting.  It give practical ways to prove the points.  It is not just information on a page as so many of these types of books are.  They tell you stories of people who have had success but not how they did it in detail.
B00FF8OKJE|5.0|This is the greatest app in the history of apps, it finally is on Kindle, my castle is firestareternal, go check it out.
B000085RPU|1.0|My movie doesnt even play. Could u send me another one? I want my miney back. I want my money back
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|For the price I paid this does exactly what I need. I hooked up 3 USB 3 drives and was able to copy back and forth with no loss in speed even in the bus powered drive. I also did transfers among my USB 3 flash drives and they were able to transfer at top speeds. excellent price and fit and finish were nice also.<br /><br />great product!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I decided to read this before the movie came out, for the sake of the movie... But now I realize that the movie will not be anywhere as captivating as this book.<br /><br />I found that to be true of Mortal Instruments 1st movie... The movie was a horrific failure, as far as I am concerned. It was not even skimming the surface of the story... Too bad.<br /><br /> I do hold out some hope for this movie as I read the Twilight series 1st and I loved the movies that were all very good, they swept me into the story, made me fall in love with the lives of Bella, Edward n Jacob all over again.<br /><br />Gosh, I hope this will be the same... Only problem as far as I can see is the casting of famous actors that will interrupt the sense of it being a new story with no distractions, interruptions of my imaginations. I really hope I don't have to spend the whole movie forgetting Harrison Ford is Harrison Ford... You get the picture.<br /><br />I said all that to say this: this is a great story, incredibly written in a very interesting pace. It is an incredible plunge into Enders stolen childhood, incredible self awareness, genius, and heartbreaking fatalism. It left me with awe, outrage and heartbreak...
0345522303|5.0|I was so excited to see Flewelling bring this back again.  She really created something great with this world and the character.  The only thing I didn't really like was how she romanticizes prostitution, and I know a lot of writer do it but I felt that part of the book was just unnecessary.  But overall this was a great read and I can't wait to see what she does next.
B00EA8UEZ4|4.0|I agree with the comments of other readers: the book is easy to read and familiar if you have read some of Gary's other books. It helps one to better understand ACIM's message.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This story prompts an examination of the nature and purpose of our existence as a species.  I thought it might be gimmicky (dog narrating as a human)  but it is a creative, clever way to tell the story of a family's life challenges, including their beloved dog.  I have read it twice, and am sure it will be a yearly \\"go to\\" book for inspiration.  Very happy to welcome Mr Stein to the literary family.
0800141806|4.0|The direction and casting were outstanding, matching characters to the people who played them.  This movie began the enlightenment of our nation on gay issues and humanized the ravages of AIDS.  While this film may not have been a game changer by itself, it contributed significantly to increased tolerance.
B005V2S7FW|3.0|Love Lastpass for my computer.  Not the best for a tablet.  does not work like computer.  Maybe it will change in future updates.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|This app is a lot of fun for my 3 year old daughter, and I can see why. There are lots of fun options within this little hair styling salon. I also really enjoy the fact that we downloaded this app for free, and if they did offer an expansion of some sort for a fee, I would buy it for her.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Fun and easy to play.  Roommate enjoys Chess and loves this app.  App has several different levels to play.  App allows people to play against each other or the computer.
B007R41E8O|4.0|But tired of getting harassed to rate it before I'm actually done with the game and they need to make it easier to figure out what and where to go, if it wasn't for the hint button I would have no clue where to go
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|I hate pdf but sometimes it is necessary.  App words to read pdf documents.  Also not fond of Adobe after they allowed customers data to be stolen and waited 5 weeks before informing customers this happened.<br /><br />Update: 23.11.2013<br /><br />App updated and is not worth downloading.  Users have to enlarge each page to read full screen (portrait) when trying to view in landscape mode font is so large there are only a few words per screen.  No setting to change the way size is for all pages.  In the little settings offered, companies talks about other products offered.<br /><br />Back to looking for a different app to read pdf documents
B0050DZN4K|3.0|I use Feedly through my desktop browser + iPhone and absolutely love it. However on the kindle fire HDX, it keeps hanging and not responding to input which forces me to manually kill the app. I can't figure out what causes the hang but needless to say it's super annoying and needs to get fixed!
B00992CF6W|3.0|its a fun game but it wont let me join my brothers worlds maybe because he got the game before me
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I think this might be one of my favourites of Stephen king. Which is a big list. Great story. I definitely get creeped by Winnebagos now.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|This app is awful. Dont get it. I didnt even get to play. I got on the app, and it kicked me off! I reccomend you dont get this app if you want my expirnce.
1623360277|4.0|Good book, with lots of good information. It is very helpful after reading other books about the whole food, plant based diet.
B00BE97ONM|4.0|Son of a Serial Killer by Jams N. Roses is a smart, slick, sick serial killer thriller. Once the opening chapters are dispensed with the story races along at a frantic pace, never letting up. This is in some part due to short chapters of which there are many and the tight writing style. The author gets right into the heart of the story and creates a great character in Ben Green, a young man left mentally derelict by the accidental death of his father. His mother has a severe mental disorder that drove his father into a deep depression and now it's Ben's turn.<br />The Phantom has been killing for some time in London and the police have no idea how to proceed with so little to go. Detective Summers is brought in and she gets right down to the task of catching the monster stalking the streets.<br />I will leave readers to figure out who the killer is as I do not want to leave a trail of spoilers to their identity.<br />This book would easily be a 5 star if not for the editing typos so I am giving it FOUR STARS which to be honest will not dissuade anyone from a thrilling death ride as I have to recommend this to all fans of Dexter.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Didn't expect much, thought it would be just another typical &#34;scary&#34; movie. Decided to watch because it received good reviews, well I was not disappointed. It was great, well portrayed and actually scary!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works perfectly as expected. New apps are being added weekly and only increases its value. Purchased one for my home tv and one to use at work.
0143115723|4.0|Terrific story but I wanted more depth.  Rather than name everyone, I would like a bit more picture painting so that I could have emotionally engaged.  I felt that I only read about the surface of the experience.  Obviously, there was too much to go into details on all, but I wanted to feel.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Steven King once again rises to the top in his sequel to The Shining. I cant wait til he pens another one for us.
1400052181|5.0|Enthralling story that I am sharing with the rest of my family.  Well written and documented, I highly recommend it for both the story and to learn about the science behind the taking of the cells.  It provided the catalist for many discussions in our family.  Brava.
0439023521|5.0|I have never read another novel like this, and I doubt I ever will. I held onto The Hunger Games from start to finish, unable to eat or sleep until I knew how it would end, and then I went on to the second book. Katniss is living and breathing, full of righteous fury and vulnerability. There is a reward and a cost for being inside her head. Absolutely nothing appears the same afterwards.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Enjoyable read. All of the main characters are so realistic. Can't wait to read the rest of this series.  Pride here I come!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Fantastic YA book with witty characters who come to life on the pages. Not too long, the book jumps right in and keeps you interested all the way through. The books success is also a testament to the maturity level and intellect of YA readers. Smart, funny, and heart-warming it's just a good book.
B00E9O6C96|1.0|I have been unable to get this thing to read its additional memory, even after going through all the conniptions required to format it as FAT 32.  It just resolutely refuses to see it.  Also, it won't update its own software.  Not exactly encouraging.  I notice lots of people seem to have had this problem.<br />So as long as you are happy to live with its meager internal 8G of memory, it probably works OK.  But I can't recommend it.
B00F4PM6WG|4.0|Our 3 yr loves his legos anyway & really enjoys the train & loading the carts. He is able to work game himself.  But to me its the same over & over.
1937053571|5.0|Wow. What an ending. I devoured this book, and loved every second. Well, some of it was hard. Sad, tragic, funny, sexy, violent, an army of awesome (yes, they do call themselves that, and are indeed made of awesome), twists and turns, with unexpected characters, turns of events and an ending that blew me away.<br />  This was everything I wanted and more for a series ending. I have loved each of the books, swooning over Aiden, laughing with Alex, jaw dropped at the intense action and fighting. Smirking at the gods especially Apollo and Seth can be lumped into all of this too when they deserve it, rolling my eyes at other times, wanting to smack them, and not getting what was going on as well as in awe of the sacrifice and emotion going on with them. Aiden is as sweet, understanding, and supportive of Alex as well, and we get to see that streak of jealousy that makes me love him even more.<br />  Alex has really grown in some ways, learning that its okay to be afraid, that she needs to open up. In others she is still the same stubborn, fun loving, loyal girl she has been throughout the series. I think that we really get to see her strength in new ways and that she steps up in so many areas in this one. I was so proud of her.<br />  Seth really surprised me in this one, and what he ends up doing really had my jaw hitting the floor. He comes face to face with the bad decisions he's made and take a look at who he has become and what he needs to do to make up for it.  I would love it if we got to see more from him so that we know what becomes of his choices. Hint, Hint Jennifer if by some chance you're reading this.<br />  I know that all of my questions were answered and the threads that I can remember were wrapped up to my satisfaction.<br />  It is so hard to review without spoiling anything, but this did not let me down at all.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Swoony, action packed series finale with a mind blowing ending.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Works pretty much as advertised (with occasional software lockups),<br />but adds very little that's not available from my $100 streaming DVD<br />player. ChromeCasting of web pages through the Chrome browser<br />is &#34;cute&#34; but -- to my surprise -- turned out not to be terribly useful.<br /><br />Considering the price, it's hard to criticize the device. My expectations<br />were just higher than warranted.  Mostly my fault, not Google's.
B0058PJ6NE|4.0|The ads at the top of the screen get in the way of the videos! Plz o plz MicroMacro Mobile Inc find a way to make them less obtrusive.
B003GQM52Q|5.0|My dad watched this on my Kindle Fire HD while my Mom was having a Chemo treatment.  He said it was the best Wyatt Earp movie he had ever seen and he said he has seen at least12.
B0083EXW50|5.0|Had to buy it since they're one of my favorite bands and they did not disappoint. Setting them live soon, can't wait.
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|This record is a great blend of 80's rock with a modern twist. The song writing is very good. Highlights are the title track, The One is a radio friendly ballad, Sticks and Stones, Jesus is Just Alright, and the unique Marching Into Battle. Very good guitar work is had throughout. This is a buy!
B002KSPKRS|3.0|These headphones are great when they are being annoying as hell.  When they are working you can hear everything around you and can tell exactly where other people are.  I play Call of Duty on a regular basis and live in an apartment and the headphone work great so that I can mute the TV and just use them.<br /><br />Pros<br />1.  You can hear everything around you and can pinpoint the location of the sound with ease.<br />2.  Comfortable enough and has a few setting to tweak the sounds.<br /><br />Cons<br />1.  If your internet connection is bad these things will make a popping noise that will drive you through the roof.  The sound is extremely annoying.<br />2.  These headphones run on AAA batteries and unless you buy rechargeable batteries be expecting to be replacing them very often (obviously depending on how much you play).  When your batteries get low you will start to hear a popping noise (very aggravating).<br /><br />Overall not bad headphones by any means but if I had to do it again I would try to find a pair with a built in battery or one that can run off the controller.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|pleased. very good game. its no street fighter but its as close as a free game is going to get.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Personal opinion:<br />&#62;If you liked the energy (and general positivism) of Ironman, you will probably like this.<br />&#62;If you hit mute or fast-forward button whilst watching M. Bay's Transformers any time there is danger mind-crushing derp or Shia LaNoob saying anything/screaming in pants-wetting fear, you will likely enjoy this.<br />&#62;If you ever though that Independence Day would have been vastly more entertaining with frakking huge mecha, well, it has taken a few years, but Guillermo Del Toro (as usual) has come through for us all.<br /><br />This isnt a deeply philosophical movie, no great lessons about the human condition, nor is there much worry about much crossover between this films target audience and that of, say, Downton Abbey.  Giant monsters, giant mecha, lots of beautifully rendered carnage, and competent, capable actors who despite being in a &#34;summer blockbuster&#34;, take their roles seriously and none phone in their performances in this deeply and lovingly trope-laden movie.  Most notable is Idris Elba, who needs to be in more films because Science.  Speaking of which, GLaDOS is present, but alas there is no cake; a fundamental flaw.  Lastly, there is a surprising--and appreciated--dearth of superfluous profanity and pointless nudity.  (Technically, no nudity at all; minor detail.)  I was bedridden with a spinal injury when this movie was in theatres, but I would love to have been able to see it on the big screen, and probably spent the money to see it in 3d more than once.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Overwhelmingly good. I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. Every day I read it on my way to and from work. THANKFULLY THE BOOK CLUB RECOMMENDED IT
B00G2SIW7M|4.0|Liked it immediately. I enjoy listening to creative bands expand upon their core sound and evolve in new directions. Sometimes that strategy fails, but Reflektor is a double-length success. Arcade Fire slides across the dance floor, flirting with EDM and Caribbean rhythms without sounding contrived or out of their element. I hope they'll continue to seek different avenues of inspiration and further their evolution.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|It kept me so interested I was hooked from season one and couldn't wait to get to the next season. Sorry this is over
B00005NIE1|5.0|One of my favorite albums of all time and they did it justice. Not a scratch or anything. I would recommend this!!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Incredibly comfortable. I prefer 7.1 to stereo even though everyone else disagrees. Best headset out there for the money .
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite books. It was absolutely enchanting. I couldn't put it down and, when I finished it, I wanted to start at the beginning again.<br />And it's in pre-production for a movie!!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Limited, causes disruptions in Wifi, had to remove its power to get home network working…..I would not buy this again.
0679805273|5.0|Great message in this book. I've given several to high school and college graduates with a personal message inside. Have used it for the guest sign-in at my own children's high school graduations.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|So much better than the original on Facebook! Easy to play on my Kindle Fire HD! Keep up the great work!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Hi all,<br />I have used a G500 until the wire broke (it took a few years). In comparison to the G500 which I would rate 9/10, this mouse is not better. However, it is a really good mouse, 8/10. For the money, quality and all the different ways you can customize this mouse, this Anker is a definite buy if you're looking for a decent casual gaming mouse.<br />Best
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I like the game.<br />It's a really fun game, if you log on to Facebook you get 50 auras. You don't have to but I recommend it. This is a game for ALL ages
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Game is addicting and I am having fun, but having to pay to advance defeats the purpose. Have been stuck on the same spot forever and refuse to pay to advance
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great way to spend the time waiting for kids to get out of school or doctor appointments.  I just don't like turning it off until I've completed a level.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|At first I thought it was like a normal bejeweled game, but it's so much better! This wonderful game is very addicting too.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Hesitant to start the series of \\"Shades\\" but once I was hooked, I couldn't stop reading it.  Breezed right through in a matter of a few days.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|And done - bit of a surprise ending which kept me interested and intrigued all the way through.  Now, ready for the movie!!

B008XKSW7M|5.0|It was good! I thought it was good good it had cool intuiting jobs and when they had there where happy
B003ICWTR4|5.0|Incredible recording of a concert that goes from midday to dark without a break. One of the best guitar solo recorded by Lofgren on Youngstown. Bitton's work incredible giving a thread of continuity through the folk/hard rock/pop(?) presentation. How does this man  do it? Don't ask just enjoy the full force presentation of Springsteen and the E street band as they prove it all night! Live does not get ANY better on a recording.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app is Okay because it said it needed an upgrade and when it was done upgrading I went to open the app and it froze and locked me out of Facebook.
B00E9A656K|5.0|Just what I was looking for. Great way to pass the time. It doesn't take too long to refuel so you can keep playing! As always, more content would be great.
B00338QF0U|4.0|I love returning to a William Boyd book. . .and this one was no exception.  Here's the thing - no matter the setting, no matter the plot. . .you may say &#34;Oh I don't know if I want to read about THAT&#34;. . .but with Boyd writing --Believe me - YOU ALWAYS DO!  Here is an unusual twist on a multi-layered suspense novel, set in London. As he always does, Boyd describes his characters in such a way - without extra words - that I feel like I know them.  Reading this novel, I forgot I was in South Florida - for the time I was reading Ordinary Thunderstorms - I was in London, often cold,<br />perhaps wet. . .but intrigued as all get out!  Boyd is on my short short list of writers I can turn to when I am put off by post-modern fiction - and need a darn good read.  He's more than that -<br />he's an amazing author!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Niece loves this game. Great for all ages. Wish had more time to play. Definitely recommend. Wish there were easier ways to get gems<br /><br />U
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Awesome album! Joe Bonamassa at his best! This guy really knows how to play a guitar whether electric or acoustic.

B00E5N8DGG|5.0|If you are a fan of Def Leppard this blue ray is it! What a great concert!  Sounds great!  Loving it
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Tolerable movie for an action flic, very predictable.  Kinda seemed like it should have been a Japanese file like some kind of Godzilla extrapolation film.
B0049IHX2C|5.0|Everything to love about this sequel/continuing chapter.  Of course Tommy and Will are great, but it was Lara Flynn Boyle who was wickedly sexy, dangerous and funny.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this is the best app ever. I cant wait to go on long cartrips so I have time to play it.
B008JFUPPI|4.0|Jeff Bridges was excellent, and Mary Louise Parker was a hoot.  Kevin Bacon nailed his role (no spoilers)!  This was a fun film, but which could have been so much better if they would have gone a little further with the special effects and playing a bit more with the alter egos/real world appearances of the leads.  Also, had they dealt a little more than superficially with the metaphysical question of good vs evil (It would have been much better had there been more variation of the manifestations.)  Still, as a graphic novel film, it was more enjoyable than so many of the negative critics have written.  It does indeed pack some good laughs.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i've never ever played a game that was this addicting before. once i start i just cant stop playing it. best game in the world awesome game.
0316228583|3.0|The authoress tried herself in the social drama with a good sprinkling of politics. But how can you be better than Ruth Rendell in that line?<br /><br />The book is a very close and inside description of the people living in a small town called Pagford under the domination of a bigger city called Yardil. It is plainly ugly and there is not one character that can save the place. They are all mean, self-centered, selfish, erratic and unpredictable at least in any nice thing they could do for others.<br /><br />We have to wait for the very last pages for one character to save the day, a character who had been bullied because she was of Asian origin and who had attempted suicide many times and commits one of the cybercrimes we are going to speak of later. And yet she will end up as the only one who will be able to go beyond all limits and create some love in a trashcan of a village.<br /><br />But the main characteristic of the novel is that it has to be more psychological than centering on action because there is so little action, just individual acts that aim at making a profit or hurting someone. That gives to the novel a very slow rhythm and that’s a shame because it could have been more dynamic if slightly shorter. We finally have the proper rhythm in the last twenty pages, but we have been obliged to read 540 pages to reach that climactic climax of intense action.<br /><br />The best part is the use of a message board as a weapon bringing up the Ghost of a recently dead parish councilor. Social melodrama in the age of the Internet and social networks! Marvelous! We know everything about it and even on decent sites you can always find someone who calls you rubbish or worse, who spreads information about you with the intention of hurting you. I have even seen a chap publishing an old (about six months hence not up-to-date) CV of mine in a comment on a review I had posted on a serious site about a compilation of “jazzy” music from Munich. And he did that in order – and that was well expressed in full clear language – to denounce my vanity and hurt me of course, as if you could hurt someone who expresses what he thinks and refuses to caress any audience the way it pleases and excites them. This is the weapon of the cowards since you cannot know who is behind the persona who is attacking you.<br /><br />So you have to overlook such things. But in a small community, when the people attacked are the candidates in a by-election it becomes a rumor, gossip, political innuendo and so on, and you can be sure it will hurt. Unluckily I have not found a real identification of the author of the last post of this sort. And we know the Stuart who confesses his virtual cybercrime only wrote one of the first three messages. So the mystery of the fourth one is full and complete.<br /><br />The ugly social segregation against the poor, illiterate, unemployed and unemployable, junkies and claimants is not even exposed really because it is done in such a way that there is not one of the people from that abandoned social group that can really save the day. The only one who could have done it is systematically shown with very negative traits and intentions. And her mother is a pure monster and the two of them, two women as you may have understood – please do not say this is sexist, today’s drugged pig is tomorrow’s processed and over-fried bacon for the barking dogs of the establishment – will sacrifice a 3 year old boy on the altar of their derelict corrugated addiction, one, the mother, to heroin and the other, the daughter, to plot-encumbered escapism<br /><br />Too bad again this novel was not 350 pages.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUer – and that was well expressed in full clear language – to denounce my vanity and hurt me of course, as if you could hurt someone who expresses what he thinks and refuses to caress any audience the way it pleases and excites them.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game on my kindle. It's fun and addictive and it keeps my brain functioning ;)
B00GEJS6GG|5.0|I've been looking forward to the second installment in Thor's story ever since I saw the first back in 2011--but at the same time, I've had some concerns. What I loved most about the first movie--Thor's fish-out-of-water experiences during his exile on earth--would have to be absent this time around. After all, Thor's spent considerable time on earth by now (okay, so it was spent in battle with the other five Avengers in what has come to be known in the Marvel universe as The Battle of New York).<br /><br />As it turns out, however, the God of Thunder still has a lot to learn about this planet. Though Thor: The Dark World is decidedly darker than the first movie, it still manages to deliver enough in the humor department, mostly thanks to the big guy himself (Chris Hemsworth, who I suspect was created in a lab somewhere just for this role) and his wayward adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston, who's made being a bad guy a good thing).<br /><br />Most of the usual suspects are back: Natalie Portman as Jane Foster, who's been waiting not-so-patiently for two years for Thor to return; Stellan Skarsgard as Dr. Erik Selvig, damaged by Loki's possession in The Avengers, is behaving erratically (running around naked at Stonehenge in front of TV cameras is pretty erratic, don't you think?) and toting a huge bag full of prescription drugs...Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), who finds a little romance in the middle of chaos...Odin (Anthony Hopkins), who, let's face it, is never going to be named Father of the Year...Frigga (Rene Russo), the only person in the Nine Realms who Loki actually loves (who do you think taught Loki that bag of tricks?)...Heimdall (Idris Elba), Sif (Jaimie Alexander), and the Warriors Three (Ray Stevenson, Tadanobu Asano and Zachary Levi, replacing Joshua Dallas as Fandral)--all committing treason with Thor and Loki in order to save Asgard and avenge Frigga's death--the result of an invasion of Asgard by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and his Dark Elves, searching for the substance that can restore the universe to total darkness.<br /><br />Thor knows he can't trust Loki, but also knows this is a war he can't win without his brother. &#34;Trust my rage,&#34; Loki suggests.<br /><br />The best dialogue in the movie is, without a doubt, between Thor and Loki. The visuals are stunning--Asgard is even more beautiful than I remember it from the first Thor (Asgardian funerals are resplendent, and their prisons are downright classy), and the action is intense, as the battle rages on throughout the Nine Realms via portals similar to the one in which the Chitauri invaded New York in The Avengers.<br /><br />As with the first movie, my favorite moments involve humor--Thor hanging his mythical hammer, Mjolnir, on a coat rack; trying to take the subway to Greenwich; squeezing into Jane's small vehicle (I'm still trying to picture Chris Hemsworth in a Formula One racer in Rush!); Stan Lee's cameo in a mental hospital; and the end credits scene involving something from Jotunheim that came to Earth through an open portal and remains in London. I would love to see Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) and his Agents of SHIELD be summoned to deal with it!<br /><br />I'm going to have to disagree with the reviewers who refer to Thor as &#34;a meathead.&#34; An intelligent person is smart enough to know he doesn't have all the answers and seeks out those who do; a meathead is too dumb to know he's dumb. Thor is far from stupid.<br /><br />The movie's ending leaves a few important unanswered questions, and the first of the two end-credits scenes offers a foreshadowing of things to come.Thanos, anyone?<br /><br />My only disappointment: not enough romance. Thor's a pretty hot guy with two women, Jane and Sif, clearly in love with him...yet he doesn't seem to have done the horizontal samba with either of them. I realize this is Disney, where the only place you can find sex is in a dictionary, but come on! You don't have to be graphic--just fade toblack as movies used to do! A guy cannot possibly look like Thor and still be a virgin! He had one shirtless scene in the whole movie, and he was alone. Now that really stretches credibility to its limits.<br /><br />I'll bet Loki's been in more than a few ladies' chambers....black as movies used to do! A guy cannot possibly look like Thor and still be a virgin! He had one shirtless scene in the whole movie, and he was alone. Now that really stretches credibility to its limits.<br /><br />I'll bet Loki's been in more than a few ladies' chambers....

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Good graphics, challenging levels, fun for all ages . This game cam be played for hours and no one will get bored due to the fact that each level is more challenging than the one before.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|These books are fantastic!  Well written and with exceptional continuity.  Of late, many books lack the superb writing and editing these books have, so they distract from the reading experience.  Not only was I engrossed in the story (which the television series follows very closely), but I found that I was unable to put the book down until I could not keep my eyes open for lack of sleep.  Though I suffered daily from lack of sleep and a yearning to continue reading, I will continue to read the series.  Highly recommended, but maintain some discipline so you don't fall asleep driving or at work.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|wish there was more free powerups to help pass the levels.  other then that I enjoy the game very much.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|Although full of old cliché the story of how IT and the business need to engage for success is told in a entertaining way. Anyone with experience in IT will immediately identify people they know or have worked with in the characters portrayed.  You will learn a lot about the IT Value Stream concepts of Dev/Ops and what that means to IT in 2020.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play it for ever. I would like if it had more stuff but it good for the go.<br />I was on a 6 hour drive so I played minecraft.I LOVE MINECRAFT.
B00FPH3YQA|4.0|I liked the movie. There is a scene in the first 2 minutes that I laughed so hard I had to pause the movie to gather myself. If you've seen the first 2, you MUST watch this one.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't go to a theater to watch it but I highly recommend as a rental to watch at home.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Katy once again delivers an AMAZING album!  I wasn't sure how I would feel about this album after falling totally in love with her last one, but this is just as good, if not better.  There isn't a single song on this album that I skip.  Sure I have my favorites, but who doesn't?  Dark Horse, This Is How We Do and This Moment are my faves, but they are all amazingly wonderful songs.  If you are on the fence about this album, just buy it.  You won't regret it!!!  I am a HUGE country music fan, but listen to a little bit of everything, and this CD was in my CD player in the car for close to 2 weeks before I took it out.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|So much fun! I'm loving the Hallween themed rooms! Great to play! Can't wait to play more themes! Maybe some reindeer games?
030758836X|5.0|I listened to the audio book of Gone Girl. It was incredible I recommend the book highly. There were multiple times that I thought I knew which direction the story would take, but I was always surprised.
B00E6895M6|1.0|Radio friendly pop-garbage. The first song was enough to make me vomit. The label must be doing some tricks to get this album tied in with better music.

A prototypical high concept sci-fi adventure flick, the film is full of dazzling imagination and inventive special effects, creating an engaging adventure that still manages to hold up fairly well. Some elements are a bit dated, but the movie's sense of wonder is palpable, and its lasting influence is evident from the moment the main titles start, all the way until the screen fades to black, taking audiences on an astonishing expedition into the mysteries of the human body.<br /><br />After a defecting Cold War scientist is gravely injured during an assassination attempt, the government scrambles to find a way to save his life. With a dangerous blood clot in his brain, the only option becomes surgery, but traditional means simply won't work. Instead, an intrepid crew strapped inside a specially designed submarine are shrunken down to microscopic size and injected into the scientist's bloodstream. With only 60 minutes to spare before they return to full size, the group will have to locate the clot and remove it while constantly facing deadly threats from the dying man's own natural defences and a potential saboteur on board.<br /><br />The first 38 minutes of the film are dedicated to careful setup, economically, yet methodically laying the groundwork for the incredible adventure to follow. After a stylized, dialogue-free opening and an inventive main title sequence, the mission is established clearly, the objectives are conveyed, the dangers are discussed, the crew's roles are defined, and the rules of the process are all detailed, highlighting little bits of information that will become pertinent as the plot evolves. Throughout it all, director Richard Fleischer maintains a slow but intriguing style, building up anticipation for the characters' inevitable entry into inner space. Long, wide shots using up the entire frame of the CinemaScope image are common place, and in a potentially risky move, Fleischer forgoes the use of a musical score until we enter the patient's body, giving the audience a delayed visual and auditory jolt.<br /><br />Once the fantastic voyage itself really begins, the movie enters a wondrous world of effects heavy imagery and tense dangers. All the while, the story's 60 minute deadline ticks down perilously in the back of our minds, and Fleischer actually has the expedition play out more or less in real time. Each new location brings upon fresh challenges, and one after another the crew is forced to work their way through cleverly designed obstacles that play up the inherent hazards of the human body. Excursions into the bloodstream, the lungs, the inner ear, and even the brain are all given an ethereal, otherworldly beauty, and the pre-computer era sets, production designs, and elaborate special effects techniques reveal a remarkable level of painstaking craft and ingenuity.<br /><br />Of course, as impressive as a lot of the visuals remain, the effects work isn't without some notable age-related stumbles. Wires holding up the actors are clearly visible in several scenes, and compositing issues with the pre-computer blue screen shots cause a few odd anomalies, and at one point, a sliver of the Captain's head is erased. Still, these flaws are all understandable, and especially given the film's ambitious scope, the results are rather incredible... and appropriately trippy.<br /><br />A little less forgivable, however, are the actor's oddly wooden and flat performances. Coupled with frequent technobabble and thin philosophical musings, the cast's dry line readings lack personality, making it hard for any of the characters to really stand out. Sure, not every element of 'Fantastic Voyage' has aged as well as others. Yes, there are flaws in the special effects, the narrative is full of clich&eacute;s, the pace is a bit slow, the acting is mostly ineffectual, there are a few unintentionally funny moments, and the whole thing takes itself a little too seriously, but as a pioneering example of high concept science fiction adventure, the film is actually kind of perfect. Endlessly imitated and parodied, this is a creative, entertaining, visually mesmerizing, painstakingly crafted, and defining piece of genre film making and one that fully earns the &#34;fantastic&#34; in its title.<br /><br />Blu-ray Video Quality – The film is presented in a stunning 1080p Color by Deluxe transfer in and awesome 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Shot with 20th Century Fox's CinemaScope process, the film features impressive widescreen photography and very creative visual designs that still impress. The print is in fantastic shape with a light to moderate layer of natural grain and virtually no signs of age or damage. With that said the film's heavy reliance on compositing work and optical effects does lead to a comparatively rough and grainy look in many of the VFX heavy scenes which pre-dominates the films second and third acts. Thankfully, clarity remains strong, and though the movie has a fairly soft look, fine details and textures are apparent, revealing many of the little intricacies in the design work. On that same note, however, the high definition image also brings out a lot of the understandable deficiencies in the 1960s special effects, leading to many shots where wires and blue screen issues are clearly visible. Colours are nicely saturated, and once the charactersembark on their journey into inner space, we are treated to lots of ethereal hues that pop from the screen. White levels are well balanced, but blacks do look a tad milky in a few shots. Nearly pristine, 'Fantastic Voyage' makes its way to Blu-ray with a great, respectful transfer free from unnecessary manipulation. There are some inherent weaknesses to the original shooting methods, but fans should be very pleased with this authentic presentation.<br /><br />Blu-ray Audio Quality – The Blu-ray is provided with a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track and a 1.0 DTS-HD Master Audio mono track. I primarily listened to the surround sound remix, but also sampled the mono mix, and each track offers a strong experience. Dialogue is clean and relatively full for a film of this age. The 5.1 remix mostly respects the movie's mono roots, subtly adding a more expansive sense of space with some welcomed directional effects. The main title sequence is especially noteworthy, with creative design work that features a plethora of engaging &#34;sci-fi&#34; effects. The film's inventive musical score is also spread nicely with solid fidelity. Distinct surround use is minimal, however, and most sounds are relegated to the front speakers. With that said, minor ambiance and echoes of music cues do hits the rears, bolstering the soundstage. The original mono track is also very effective, and though it lacks the directionality and enhanced dynamic range of the surround mix, it provides an authentic experience. Both tracks are thankfully free from any major age-related hiccups like hissing, but I did detect some minor background static/crackling during isolated instances. Whether you go with the 5.1 or original mono track, 'Fantastic Voyage' sounds great, giving purists an untainted mix and those open to remixes a respectful upgrade that avoids unnatural gimmicks.<br /><br />Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:<br /><br />Audio Commentary: Commentary by Film and Music Historian Jeff Bond: Jeff Bond provides a steady stream of trivia about the film's production, offering details on the films award winning special effects, its sets, music, sound design, cast, script changes, and historical place within the evolving motion picture industry. Though a little dry, the commentary is packed with information and is worth a listen for fans.<br /><br />Special Feature: Lava Lamps and Celluloid: A Tribute to the Visual Effects of Fantastic Voyage [1996] [480i] [1.33:1] [17:40] Is a great look at the film's then ground-breaking special effects. The documentary focuses on the film's award winning visual effects. Interviews with Hollywood effects supervisors are included along with behind-the-scenes photos and sketches, highlighting all of the impressive and painstaking techniques that were used to bring the film's visuals to life without the use of computers.<br /><br />Special Feature: Whirlpool Scene: Storyboard to Scene [1996] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:22] This special feature actually offers three versions in the production process, which are available by using the red button on your remote control.<br /><br />Trailer and TV Spots [1996] [480i] [1.33:1] [13:07] There is a film trailer and three TV spots are viewable separately or together. If you want to see what real faded colour looks like, then have a look at these.<br /><br />Special Feature: Isolated Score Track with Commentary by Film and Music Historians Jeff Bond, Jon Burlingame and Nick Redman: Leonard Rosenman contributed a rather unusual score, and one which makes an entrance surprisingly late in the film, one which reminds me personally of the works of Milton Babbitt or Roger Sessions. The score doesn't enter the film until well past the half hour mark, which gives the three commentators a nice breathing room to discuss 20th Century Fox, the Nick Newmans and Leonard Rosenman. They wisely bow out right before the music starts.<br /><br />Finally, ‘FANTASTIC VOYAGE' is easily one of the most distinctive sciencefiction films of the sixties, and I personally would rate it, especially In terms of concept if nothing else, and second only to ‘2001: A Space Odyssey.' It's easy to look back on the practical and photochemical effects from the vantage point of shinier technology and find them somehow less than convincing, but that's like holding Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s to the same standard as James Cameron. While some of the performances and even the dialogue are a bit on the clunky side now and again, overall the film is a viscerally exciting piece of filmmaking, well-paced, and even if it takes a while for the miniaturisation and insertion into the body to happen, and ultimately, extremely tense and suspenseful. Older viewers and even those who first saw `Fantastic Voyage' on television as children are going to be delighted by this new Blu-ray, and younger viewers may well find themselves unexpectedly entranced by it as well. That is why this has been a firm favourite film of mine, as when it was first shown in the cinema, we all wanted to join the crew of the Proteus submarine and see if what the crew saw of the inside of the body, was actually true and ever since it has been a firm sci-fi favourite of mine with other films released in the 1960s, But now I can view this brilliant film whenever I want to indulge in some good sci-fi pleasure and I am so lucky to now add this brilliant film to my ever increasing Blu-ray Collection.

B009LQKHIO|5.0|A heartwarming story of strength and true love. Good conquers evil always. I will have to read the next pride book now...
B00957T6X6|3.0|Major characters you've invested time in are killed off.  One after another of dead ends.  So in one sense the book just kind of rambles, bouncing off one rock and then another on it's way to the &#34;winter&#34; which which we know is coming . OK I get it.<br />For this kind of story I think I'll just re- read &#34; The Fall of the Roman Empire&#34;
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|We ordered this from the US and its well worth the £32 we paid for it.<br />It's really nice to be able to pick a movie on Netflix on my ipad or android phone and just send it to the TV; it overcomes the clunky TV interface and makes it much more usable.<br />You can also use the mobile device as a remote.<br />Shame I can't mirror the Chrome browser from my ipad, although it seems to work from a google laptop, but that's a minor thing and is probably more of a problem caused by Apple than Google.
B000JBWWBK|5.0|We love this movie.  This is one of the few that we watch over and over.  The music is fun, and the ensemble delightful.  Freddie Highmore steals the show....  A light, fun, love story, with a familiar pattern.  The plot is pure formula, and predictable  but the pace, and light humor keep it moving along.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Still awsomly addictive. I like the new characters and the way it follows the story line. Die you evil pigs!
B008XBASVY|5.0|Loved it. That's all I have to say.It's a definite yo read but I have to say I wish it was a little longer
B003YL4LYI|4.0|So far, it is a good read, but a little pedantic, as I also found the previous books in this series to be.  Once one gets into the theme of this volume and known characters begin to reappear, it reads well, and one is reassured that it is related to the previous volumes.  Also, it is relatively easy to pick up where one left off without having to read previous pages to refresh one's memory - a good thing!
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|I play it constantly because I am a number 1 fan!  I have it on my I-pod for workouts and in my car for driving to & from work!
0060763280|5.0|One of my personal favorite books. I re-read it every October for seven years so far. And I enjoy passing it on to friends and hearing how much they got from the book. Read this one, you'll be glad you did.
B00992CF6W|2.0|It's getting boring considering that there aren't anything u can ride like a mine cart, or redstone plus rails, boats, hay, an actual working nether portal, more mobs, and expand the world generation to infinity
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great colors, short, fun, easy to use and a little addictive. Had me thinking 'Just one more puzzle...' The design is simple but good, the app is easy and pretty much self explanatory. Something I end up coming back to just to play. Enjoy!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book as a child, but understand and relate surprisingly more to the characters now that I'm an adult.  This is a must read for any science-fiction fan.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I was riveted from beginning to end. I couldn't put it down. I haven't seen the movie and probably will not. I enjoyed the words and my interpretation so much I don't want to see it altered on the screen. I surprised myself by crying at the end. I didn't want it to end. I can't discuss the content without giving anything away so I will leave it at - a must read. I have and will recommend this book. Would be fabulous for book clubs.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|You have to read Allegiant if you read the first two books but just be warned it's not good and you will be bored.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I cannot believe how disappointing this was compared to how good the first book was. I wish I had stopped after the first book. The love/hate between Tris and Tobias continued from book 2 all the way through book 3. Tris continues being a self indulgent irritating teenager. So Sorry I pre-ordered the third because I would have stopped with the second. The only saving grace was it ended in a way that she can't continue with pain of a fourth book. Stop after the first book!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|In the story we are introduced to a young girl. From the beginning of the story to the end takes us to places in her life. Also, the author includes details about a world and things that happen during the course of this time of history Germany before, during, and after World War 2. My mission was to read it before seeing the movie. The movie I hope will be as excellent and exciting as the book.
0307352153|5.0|A insightful and thought provoking glimpse at a very interesting subject matter.  Well written and researched book.  Definitely recommend this book to anyone wanting to explore how societal expectations dictate how parents raise children these days. Worth a read!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Beautiful detail, lovely soundtrack, and puzzles that are tricky but not too insanely difficult. I am excited to have chapter two come out, and its already November, isn't that late 2013 enough? ;)
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|The album is awesome! Out of the last 3 albums that Stryper has done since they have gotten back together, this one is the best. Great music, great lyrics! I have been a fan since 1988 when a friend handed me Soldiers Under Command and I was hooked. Hope to see them on tour!
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|I am a simple man with simple tastes.  This book delivers what you need to hear how you need to hear it to hit your goals.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A wonderfully fitting end to an epic saga. I'm on my third reading already! The final chapter &#34;The Last Battle&#34; is as good as anything I've ever read in the realm of fantasy novels.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Wheres the. Search mechanism? I sure looked all over for.it  do you have to flip pages. Did anyone tell them there is a better way. I tried two different times and could not locate how to look up a word.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Interesting premise and well written.  Felt it slowed down a little in the middle but enough of a plot line that I kept reading to see what happened.  This book will keep you guessing, and made me wonder what I would do in the characters' shoes.  Unfortunate title :(  at first I thought it would be a schmaltzy romance.  Not at all.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I love this app! I have used other organizers but I like this one the best. It's easy and fun to use.  My task list and Calender are both on the screen at the same time.There is no switching from one page to another. The important task are listed on the right side of the screen so you know what needs to get done. There are differant calendars you can download to your personal calendar. I downloaded the weather calendar for my city and state which is very helpful when planning outdoor activities. Get crazy. Make it your own with differant Colors and Icons. Great prodect Jorge. Thank you.
1563894696|5.0|One of the thing that make this one of the best Batman novel's ever is that it's a good history on it's own,  that just happens to have great graphics and Batman on it.  At moments,  you feel you're tryin' to solve the mistery with the bat.  The plot twist is mind-blowing.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It is very fun but the only problem is that you need energy to play but the game is very enjoyable
0785134352|2.0|I honestly don't know why,  but the movie adaptation is WAAAAAY better than the original source.  I felt the same with WANTED.  Again,  I really was expecting a lot more from Mr. Millar
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Not enough apps yet but it has a great quality. For 35 dollars it is a great deal ! !
B00EKHE1JA|1.0|First fall that my over-expensive Striker Eureka and joints in left arm and right foot got destroyed. It gave the chance to check all the other joints and to my dissapointment they are also in poorly state. I've been buying NECA figures for a long time, and I can say that this is probably one of THE WORST figures in terms of quality.
B008Y7CZUY|4.0|A lot of emotions. I loved the scenes and views. Made me hungry for Italian food and simplier life .
B0021L8V0W|5.0|Again, another great action movie of Angelina Jolie.  A sequel will be another adrenalin rush treat.  I hope she will consider to star in the rumored sequel.
B002QE3CTY|3.0|I found the story confusing. I'm not sure I'll continue with the series.  Maybe I'll come back to it later.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It kept me busy and interested at the same time. I look forward to more levels. Can hardly wait. Thanks so much.
0316055433|1.0|Although Donna Tartt really does write wonderfully hypnotically, and I love that, this book went nowhere and took forever to get there.  I had read about 300 pages when I started thinking, am I going to have to read every thought this kid has, for every minute of the rest of his life? And when, god, when, can we get OUT of Las Vegas, ugh, what a BORING setting, and to go on for hundreds of pages, it was just torture, so I started skimming and then realized that nothing ever does happen.  Theo grows up to be just like his father, whiny, self-obsessed, incapable, and corrupt.  By the time I was done with the book, I didn't want to hear one more word on the loss of his mother.  I just did not care anymore.  I am SO disappointed.  My advice is to read a couple hundred pages in the book store and then decide whether to buy it.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Unbelievable story of courage, heart, patriotism, and will to survive.  God bless our fighting forces who lay down their lives so we may live in freedom.
B00EVW0VTI|2.0|The movie would have been a lot better if they had made it shorter, and not tried to get partisan. Driving around the white house lawn, circling the water fountain multiple times in a limo with a couple of bad guys right behind them with mini guns and RPGs... really? But that was kind of funny. And yes, lots of explosions and action during this whole time. And that's where it should have ended. If it had, it would have been great.<br /><br />Instead, in their zeal to make John Boehner the bad guy, they make everyone sit through an hour of political commentary. In this twisted world, &#34;right wing extremists&#34; take over the white house because of lost military contracts since Obama wants to bring the troops home. Boehner is a traitor, has Biden killed and tries to kill Obama so he can take over the white house and put troops back in the middle east. Finally, Obama shoots some RPGs, grows a spine, and has Boehner exposed and arrested. Finally, he is informed that the world loves him, and the middle east, Russia and China have all agreed to his peace plan.

0451418433|4.0|I do like this book. Unfortunately, it is a 900 page book that, although I ordered it new in May, I did not get an opportunity to start reading until November.  There is a problem with the binding and pages 15-74 are simply missing.  Not torn out - just apparently not bound correctly with the book.  Because it has been 3 months since I received this book, the seller feels he has no responsibility for selling a defective book.  Do not know if any other copies have this issue, but  although I have been very satisfied with the many, many products I have purchased from Amazon over the years, there is NO WAY I would ever purchase another book from ALOTOFBOOKS01  After I read books, I donate them to our local, very rural library.  With 65 pages missing, it is a poor donation.  And I would like to find out what happened to the story during those 65 pages!!!
B00D7OMNXS|4.0|I did not think that this was the best Iron Man as far as the overall story. However Robert Downey is his typical self that endure audiences to this character.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I have enjoyed this book since I was a child. It is funny, and the illustrations are very well done.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|I bought this as a gift. I don't actually like Miley Cyrus at all, but I was very pleased to get this delivered in only 3 days!
B003QSPTAY|5.0|Just watched this with my 8 and 4 year old boys...<br />and while the 4 year old did waver a bit in the middle, the older boy was completely engaged from start to finish, occasionally pausing the film to ask questions and make sure that he understood which twin was which, and the intricacies of the plot. To say that my boys, who are avid Phinius and Phirb and Adventure Time fans enjoyed this film is saying more than a father could ...and what a lovely introduction to slower paced and well acted entertainment after what we see being churned out for children these days.<br />What I would like to add is, don't plop your children in front of this movie and then go do something more important, if there is a message in this movie, it says that your children are what is important ...so sit down with them and watch the movie with them, it will only make you closer and deepen a love that is already there.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Love the new cd it  hasn't came out of cd player yet except to switch trucks !  Just keeps getting better and better while  opening up more as I listen to this masterpiece .

B00123KER8|5.0|My favorite Deep Purple album! The addition of Coverdale and Hughes made the band more interesting.  They were able to go further musically but at the same time be appealing to the masses.  This line up was a little less heavier than the MkII.  &#34;Lay Down Stay Down&#34; is my favorite Purple tune along with all of the others on this album.  The remastered sound is fantastic and is the best sounding purple album to date. The extra tracks are a treasure!  Ritchie cooks in this! I wish they made more albums with this line up!
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Upgrade from what I had. Makes great addition to BOB. Will last a lifetime for me to my grandchildren and then soom.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Best game ever.I love it . They need more games like this.The only thing I don't like about this game  is that my brother has the iPad and he has more levels and more cars to get and I don't. You should get this game I play it all the time.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I love the setting and the sadness of the story.<br />Emily Bronte is able to hold my interest right to the end of the story.<br />I am able to remember the scenes  even after a long period.
0553814826|4.0|The book is great absolutely wonderful however it took two months for me to receive my order I'm happy I got it not so happy I had to wait so long. I would've given five stars if not for the wait but it was worth it.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Not that useful only works with youtube and chrome browser.  If they make this compatible with airport would it be a superior streaming device.
B008OOYALE|2.0|Well it's an ok game but there are some problems and I just don't think that you should get it.
B00FJMK9VE|4.0|Welcome back Stryper! It has been a while since hearing new music for y'all. I'm really digging the new songs &#34;No More Hell To Pay&#34; and &#34;Sympathy&#34;, too. Not to mention the other 'Rocking' songs as well. You all are right back when you all left off and I'm looking foreword to hearing more in the future.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting!I get so excited when they add new characters or powerups.My favorite part is trying to finish missions and increase my multiplier to beat my friends high score.If you haven't played this game yet, I highly recommend that you download it as soon as possible and experience the fun for yourself!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I really love it. It is easy to set up and works flawlessly. I recommend this product if you wasn't an easy way to get internet content and music into your living room.

B00BSBVJVE|5.0|Pusheen is a cat that likes food, blogging, and sleeping. Her BFF (and little sister) is Stormy who is super fluffy and likes to chase things.<br /><br />I had so much fun hanging with Pusheen and Stormy, that I went online to Pusheen.com and explored the blog where the original animated comics developed. I instantly fell in love; it's such a cute place filled with kitties, happiness, and animated food!<br /><br />If you have children, I'd definitely recommend this book to kids old enough to read (maybe 4+ yo) I shared the book with D, a five year old I babysat today, and he absolutely loved it! He was pretty much giggling the whole time. Cat lovers of all ages would be thrilled to find this book in their stocking on Christmas Day (hint, hint).<br /><br />Many thanks to NetGalley for the opportunity to read and review this book.
0763668966|1.0|Very beautiful book, with interesting pictorial maps.  But I cannot give anything more than one star to a book that purports to be educational and multicultural which entirely omits any serious reference at all to Israel.  This cannot be accidental.  Israel is shown exactly twice in the most insignificant of ways:  as a tiny nation with its name in tiny print on a map-overview of Asia; and on a page showing all the flags of the world.  It's immediate neighbors -- Egypt and Jordan -- each get nice 2-page spreads.  But even on those maps Israel is not shown as a neighboring country.<br />How often is Namibia in the news? or Finland? or Belgium, for that matter?  They all got nice, large maps.  Good for them. But Israel, as well as her neighbors, is basically in the news on a near-daily basis. It's a world hot-spot. If an atlas is to educate about geography it should educate about geopolitics and significant world affairs as well.  My intuition tells me that its omission was not an oversight but an intended slight.  If I'm wrong I'm wrong.  I just have to return this book despite the nice maps.  I should mention that I collect pictorial maps, and have paid many hundreds of dollars for some of them, and wish I could keep this book on aesthetic grounds; but I really cannot.  Sorry to be a jingoist here, but it's my prerogative.

B00007LTIL|5.0|First weekend of Spring, 1971, my freshman year in a small New England college.  Someone has set up his or her speakers in a dorm window overlooking the quad of our residential area.  Box of Rain is playing.  That was over 40 years ago, and yet when I hear that song, that moment comes back to me, not crisp and clear, but like a fleeting memory you can momentarily grasp.<br /><br />Box of Rain, Friend of the Devil and Sugar Magnolia just might be the best first 3 songs on an album ever--certainly in the top 5.  The rest of the album is pure joy.<br /><br />It's widely recognized that the Dead was a live performance band, with its best recorded work being live albums.  American Beauty (and its predecessor, Workingman's Dead) are the exceptions.  Play this album anywhere, anytime--it's a cure for all ills.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I love NCIS!  Every so often I will miss an episode.... So I can do all of my catching up by buying the movies.  I own 10 seasons so far.  When it is cold and rainy or snowy, what is better than hot chocolate, an electric throw, and NCIS from the beginning?
0316055433|5.0|Donna Tartt has written a masterful story.  An enormous amount of research must have gone into this book, as you will read about antique furniture restoration and drug addiction.  It is a long book (770 pages) but I had trouble putting it down.  Beautifully drawn characters.  And you can smell the streets of New Your and Amsterdam, and feel the searing heat of Vegas.  I am not going to describe the story.  I am going to tell you to read it.  It is one of the very best books you will read.
B00881VLCE|5.0|IF your like me and crave a good jigsaw, this puzzle is the best I have ever stumbled upon I like the way the pieces are kept in the side pocket and can be scrolled thru to you find the right piece. You don't have a mess on the puzzle field. And you can purchase more puzzle packs whenever you like.
B000RIHBIE|5.0|Still my favorite release from Sum 41.  Shows their range of lyrics, emotion and overall music ability. Rivals Green Day's American Idiot as one of the best punk albums of the last decade in my opinion.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are so talented and awesome.  My 2 year old grandson watches their You tube videos and dances with them.  The whole family loves them!!
B00BOTCJXC|2.0|Knowing little about the author, but based on the fact of HBO involvement, I could easily predict the movie's ending. Predictable, boring and superficial save for the actors who kept my interest to the last.
1401917232|5.0|Gary R. Renard writes about profound issues with a clarity that rarely found in writers about metaphysical topics.  Also, he and his teachers present the information with a combination of serious knowledge and sassy humor that makes the book a joy to read.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I give &#34;New&#34; 5-stars because all the songs on this set are very interesting, sometimes &#34;Beatlish&#34; (of the Beatles), melodic and upbeat.<br />He has some very cool riffs on &#34;On My Way to Work&#34; and &#34;Appreciate&#34;-- 2 of my favorites, though it's tough to choose.<br />Also I have been hearing a lot about &#34;Queenie Eye&#34;, but hadn't heard it until I got the CD from Amazon (which came about 3 or 4 days earlier than expected).<br /><br />&#34;Save Us&#34; is a great opener to the CD -- and another favorite, as are &#34;Alligator,&#34; &#34;New&#34;, &#34;Hosanna,&#34; and &#34;Early Days.&#34;<br />A must have for Beatle/Paul fans.
0399230033|5.0|At first I thought the book was kind of silly but it quickly became one of my 2 year old's favorite bedtime books.  So cute!
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|This game is great.  Super fun and addicting.  I questioned it at first with a few of the other ratings I read.  So glad I gave it a chance.  I really enjoyed every level until the end.  The hints option was certainly helpful a couple of times, but for the most part, I was able to try different things and figure out the puzzles on my own.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love it but I don't like waiting for my time outs. Very glad it's on kindle now. Very addictive.
B00FEHXISA|1.0|The movie was unwatchable as it would pause every 2 minutes or so to buffer.  We finally ditched it and used Charter's Movie On-Demand system and watched Iron Man 3 in HD without any issues.  Amazon doesn't provide a good way to notify them of streaming issues which are clearly due to their infrastructure or to request a refund on an unwatchable movie.
1439153663|5.0|A tragic tale of a young Irish girl who's childhood is forever changed by the death of her parents aboard a ship bound for America.  Upon her arrival a prominent tobacco plantation owner purchases her along with other slaves to help work his plantation. Her young life was a happy one growing up with love and nurturing by the slaves who took her in as one of their own, and eventually became her secure and only family.  Her budding years were spent with a prominent white family connected to the owners wife, where she received an education and elocution lessons.  When she is thrown into a tailspin of the need to marry she ends up marrying the owners son.  After their return to the plantation her whole existence is changed upon the owners death and the son's inheritance, she unfortunately learns very quickly, the difference between the father and the son. The father was a virtuous man who achieved success through respect and hard work, the son on the other hand looses everything due to his downright meanness, intoxication, greed and a never ending, right of entitlement.<br /><br />This book is beautifully written about a desperate time in history.  What I took away from this story was the sense of belonging through love and compassion and what a difference there is to thrive among honorable, principled  people and perish if surrounded by evil.<br /><br />Not a light read but a flowing feeling novel, with a skilled and effective narrative that absolutely helped me visualize the people, setting and scenes throughout.
0670026182|4.0|One of the most beautiful cookbooks I own. Haven't tried any of the recipes yet.... I had to buy this book twice, as someone stole the first copy from me at a car wash! Great book for display
B0050PYNP8|3.0|This was funny. Cheap, and sometimes cheesy but funny. The acting was more or less slapstick, except for Paul and some scenes needed better graphics, but it was a fun movie
B003H4I4JU|4.0|While I'm not sure I like Novhina at all, or her family, and feel that Ender deserved a much better family and should've been able to find a better family given all of his travels.....the book itself was good.  It was interesting, and strange, and the whole thing with Human and Rooter was quite alien, and I didn't like the majority of the people in it.....but it still drew me in.  That's difficult to do, when I dislike so many of the characters so much.<br /><br />No spoilers, but this was a somewhat sad tale of a family that was self-destructive, and then started to become more healed.  I'm just not sure it should've been Ender's family.  Bagh.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Bought this for myself and another for my best friend. We loved it from the opening scene to the end. Great work by Abrams and Spielberg
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was recommended by a co-worker.  It's an awesome book; I'm surprised that anyone was able to pick out a decent book for me.  I'm pretty picky about books, I have a lot of pet peeves....and this had none of those pet peeves, and was fast paced, exciting, and a great read.  Finished it in a single sitting.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|First of all this game has tons of action in it. And best of all its free ;what more could you ask . Definitely get this game
B008JFUNKU|5.0|This is an awesome movie! It's definitely the best of Tom Hanks work! Hanks brings the right amount of leadership and emotion to the part of Phillips and Abdi does a bang-up job as the main pirate! Full of emotion, action, and edge-of-your-seat drama and suspense, &#34;Captain Phillips&#34; brings an unbelievably incredible story to the screen in a believable and exciting way! In my opinion, it is a classic! Highly Recommended!
B002RI90WM|5.0|Excellent book Well written and insightful with interesting themes.  A thought provoking book I couldn't put down.  Well worth the read
B00CWVFPGO|2.0|This movie was bad, Arnold is done being governor so now back to acting. I was kind of hoping this was his last stand meaning this would be his last film but I see he and Stallone have teamed up for that prison break movie. They are both pushing 70 years old there time as leading guys in action films are over. I didn't mind watching Arnold in Commando, the terminator, kindergarten cop, Twins and any of his films from the 80's and 90's but watching him now is just plain sad he can barely move.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|But you have to buy better version<br />To edit pictures and get colors<br />So it kinda atinks but its great!!
B008220BLG|1.0|This movie is one of the worst films I Have ever seen. It takes a special film to make you stop the DVD about 20minutes into it  and want to break in it half,  then contemplate your life and lastly take your anger and frustration out on a punching bag or a person. I have only had this happen to me on 4 films, them being WARM BODIES, CLOSER with Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Natalie Portman and Jude law. SON OF THE MASK with Jamie kennedy,. lastly the Super Mario brothers movie. I Will be completely honest I only watched this because one of my Hollywood crushes was in it with Teresa palmer but she couldn't even save this movie. The lead played by Nicholas Hoult obviously went to the Jaden Smith school of acting which is to go through every scene of the film with a constipated dumb look on his face. I though Twilight was bad wait til you get a load of this . Anyone who follows the zombie genre will be devastated as this film pretty much sets its own rules as far as zombies go. really its the same thing that twilight did where everyone knows that vampires if they go in the sun will burn up but not in twilight they just glitter and stuff, same thing here most people who watch the walking dead or zombie movies know that once the virus hits you your dead that person you were is gone, but not in this film they act like your mind is still active  but your stuck in a  stage of purgatory like your body is doing things you don't have control over. the love story is really messed up the main character named R is a zombie he eats Teresa Palmers boyfriends brains  who is played by Dave Franco he sees his thoughts and of Teresa's character and his heart just starts pumping again  so lame. Most of the movie is about them spending time with each other and falling in love even tho she completely discounts that R eat her boyfriend, that's terrible.  This movie is  cinema defecation they completely crap on everything we have come to know and have seen in the zombie genre.

006202406X|1.0|I loved the first two books but all I can say about this one is that it's several hours of my life I'll never get back. Forget about the ending, which is awful by the way, the entire book is a long, monotonous tale of what used to be some great characters, now doing mostly a bunch of boring stuff ... going to their dormitory, lying on their cots, talking, etc. After the first 2 books, which I couldn't put down because they were so full of action, this one is a big disappointment. If you read and loved the first two, I know you'll want to read this one to finish out the story but don't expect too much.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I know that tons of people have been discussing this book lately and not really caring if they let spoilers out or not, but this will be a spoiler free review of Allegiant, because I truly believe this story shouldn’t be ruined and should be experienced first-hand. However, a lot of the events in Divergent and Insurgent shape what happens in Allegiant so there will be minor spoilers for the first two books in the series, but nothing that would completely ruin your enjoyment of reading those two.<br /><br />I’m just going to get right to what everyone is talking about… the ending. I won’t say much, because again spoilers, but it’s a shocker. It’s not your typical ending and yes it did make me ugly cry, but it’s also not a bad ending, which is contrary to what most people are saying. It’s different and shocking and brave. Honestly, I don’t understand all the backlash. People constantly complain about how YA books all follow the same path and nothing is new, but then when something comes along that is new, they rise up against it.<br /><br />Veronica Roth’s writing is still wonderful and she easily pulls the reader into this world. Any writer that can take your heart and practically fuse it to the characters and their well-being is truly something special and that is exactly what she did. The story was engaging and kept me on edge and I loved every single second of it, even the seconds that hurt.<br /><br />My absolute favorite part of the story was getting inside Four’s head. I really enjoyed reading from his perspective. I felt like it really added another layer to the story. We also see just how damaged he is. Four is not as strong as we were once led to believe and Marcus did more damage to him than we thought. Getting inside his head really enabled you to understand why he does the things he does and why he makes the decisions he makes. Plus, I just love him, so it was nice reading more about him.<br /><br />Tris will always be one of my favorite heroines. She is so strong and willing to do whatever is necessary. I love her strength and compassion. I love that she is real and breaks down. I love her ability to forgive anyone and how she loves completely. I also love that she and Four bring out the best in each other and make one another better.<br /><br />A lot of people have a lot of hate towards this book, but I don’t get it. Yes everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I really thought it was a good book. It may not have been exactly what I wanted but it was still good and was still enjoyable. The writing is fantastic and the world created is so amazing. This book changes everything you thought you knew about the series. It wraps everything up and that for me is the most important thing in a conclusion… no loose ends.<br /><br />All in all, Allegiant is a good read. This series will always be one of my very favorites. Even though this book was nothing I expected, it was still a wonderful read despite it making me ugly cry. Maybe I’m the dissenting opinion here, but I thought this was an enjoyable book and a strong and memorable end to the series.
B008745B32|5.0|Religious belief proves tough enough for human foibles and failures. Waugh does some theology by way of a passionate novel.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I enjoy Bubble. Witch game.  I play it on laptop and kindle,  it's. challenging enough yet not too difficult to not want to keep playing it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works as advertised and at an excellent price point.Streams nicely from my 1st generation Nexus 7 tablet. No problems with setup.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|Love the cast and it proves that life can indeed have an encore performance. A dream cast of British actors continue to prove that one never really needs to retire if you find the passion in your life.<br /><br />The ensemble cast of this story complement each other as only British actors can I think. What I love about British actors is their quiet professionalism. Each of them is instantly recognizable and have appeared together in other films. If there is one jarring moment, its hearing Maggie Smith deliver the \\"F bomb\\" which she does with great conviction and yet its so \\"in the moment\\" one hardly realizes that \\"Professor McGonagall just let fly in front of Headmaster Dumbledore\\".<br /><br />This is a well crafted story of a gracious retirement home for down on their luck theater folk set in a gorgeous British countryside.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is one of the best free games there is! Ever since the Magic update, I was astounded by the newer music,magic system,and then the Light Dragon. The designs of the dragons are awesome and creative. I mean,they are good. My favourite one is the Thunder Dragon. This is one of the few park sims that don't give you pop-ups saying to buy more gems,diamonds,etc. and I love it that the game doesn't bug us constantly.<br /><br />The best thing about this game is its fun and addicting. I swear,once you get going,you're not stopping. The music somehow draws me in and makes me stay and play on it. It's hypnotic,because it's so much more&hellip;real,and it seems like.a lot of effort was put into it.<br /><br />So, in general:<br /><br />Music:10<br /><br />Gameplay:8<br /><br />Annoyances:1<br /><br />Graphics:9<br /><br />This game has a place in my heart for being one of the BEST games I've ever played.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|Its Star Trek. If you like the series, how can you not like this? The actors in the new movie series capture the characters begun a generation ago extremely well. Gene Roddenberry would approve I think.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Very fun and keeps me entertained. Also a good game for the kids to play. Keeps them very occupied so I can get stuff done.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Wonderful, uplifting story of aging vocalists living in a senior home - Britain style, which actually seemed a bit more humane than places I've seen around here. The way the friends worked with Cissy who has memory issues, was very real life. Taking care of each other. The underlying love story was very nicely portrayed!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been playing this game on fb for a while and was so excited to see it finally out for the kindle fire.  I enjoy the fact they have come up with a way for you to progress to the next level without bothering your Facebook friends if you don't want to.  Pay, bug your friends or redo three randomly picked levels to move forward.  It may take you a bit longer to unlock the next level but that is not an issue for me.  Love the game.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Excellent movie. The tricks and slight of hand will keep you on the edge of your seat. A refreshing portrayal of magic; and mixture of the older one (M Freeman) and the upstarts.
1250038820|4.0|...but this book makes me want to believe in &#34;us&#34; again. Wonderful stories and a heartwarming book. Worth the purchase despite people complaining about lack of anecdotes. (See what I mean about losing faith in humanity?)<br />This is obviously a photography book so please appreciate the wonderful photos and be grateful for the loving, inspiring and uplifting captions when they appear because it's worth it. I bought a hard copy but now I also want a digital copy for travel. I would've given this 5 stars if they offered this book on kindle matchbook. Additionally, although most photos are on his blog, it's always nice to have it in a book form regardless. Love it and I strongly recommend that you purchase this book, you won't regret it.
B00336C3EY|4.0|Down to earth guy, who experiences life unraveling; also from a Jewish perspective. Wife has an affair; lots of denial; trying to see the rabbi, but can't get in; wife and boyfriend want him to move out; he does; boyfriend ends up dying; and now to reconcile the family.

B0046UGSNS|4.0|Interesting premise for the story. Julianne Moore does a great portrayal of a partner who has a pattern of not measuring up to expectations; and the resulting impact on the relationship is life like. The arrival of the sperm donor into the lives of this family, at the request of the teen age children, produces several turn of events, not the least of which is the ending and being shut out of the family that really isn't his to have.
0385536828|5.0|What a story. A love story, a mystery, the coming of age story in the times of the height of the cold war in England. Wonderfully written and surprising at every turn. Well done!
B004UID2LC|4.0|Great for videos and music and it is very easy to search for what you want and it will ask you for video or music download
0385340990|5.0|This book is all what one could want in a good reading time. It brings us back to the days of WWII, to the island of Guernsey, it tells of bravery and guts, of love of literature and the human condition. A book in letters, it is charming and poignant.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This app is still as fun and addictive as when it first came out i cant put it down !
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Wish the upgrade they did don't wipe out your scouring now have to start from the beginning again. But it's fun.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! I've been hooked since it first came out. I was so excited when it finally was available for the Kindle. Thank you.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|AMD, a company that once partnered with Intel. Anyways, I am a future technician and building a 2nd PC for myself to tinker with. My first build was Intel, Now lets see what AMD has to offer. This is one of the parts that came with my order, along with the case, PSU, and Asus motherboard. Shipping was great and on time as always. I overheard that people build PC's just for gaming. I think that's a load of bs. I'm not building this PC for gaming, I'm building this PC to compare to my Intel and to gain experience with AMD, after all, I'm a college student.  I'm typing this review on my 1st PC build with a Intel processor. 5/5 overall for shipping, and how AMD is keeping up and not giving up after the Intel/AMD relationship Split.
B008JFUS28|5.0|Saying Thor: The Dark World was good is an understatement. I won't bore you with a summary as I'm sure most of you as readers know what the movie is about. What I will say is that the plot was solid, the drive and motivation for the action that was taken was well executed, and this movie does Thor REAL Justice. I liked the first one for what it is, but this time around you got to see more of Asgard as a people and culture and there is more back story between it's relationship and the other 9 realms including Midgard (Earth). The relationship between Thor and his brother Loki was really developed and as viewers we get to see what tough choices has to be made for the greater good. Thor 2 was filled with ALOT of action. The characters and all the actors that played them were executed flawlessly and as far as where this is rated among other Marvel movies, I'd say it is the best solo movie since the first Iron Man. It was a wild ride that gave you very nice twists, action, humor, tragedy, and finishes with a very nice cliff hanger. I won't spoil you'll have to see for yourself ;).<br /><br />I give it a 9/10. Would have given it a 9.5 but the second post credit scene was lacking a lot! Served no real purpose but for romantic closure.
1452110581|5.0|I bought this book for a friend for Christmas. It just came, and I've read it already. Ordinarily I wouldn't do that with a gift book, but it's a small book. It is SO funny!  All of the poems in the book are so indicative of a cat's independent nature.  A very cleverly written amusing book.  I'm tempted to buy more for my other cat-loving friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very cool game and has expanded things and extremely difficult times but you'll eventually get it right. It just SO much of awesome bit into a little game.
0767919408|5.0|This Bill Bryson book, which I bought for my husband, has left him unable to put it down.  There were so many things that happened during the summer of 1927:  Lindbergh's flight, Babe Ruth breaking his own record, Al Capone in full force, and even more memorable events.  He is enjoying this book immensely.  If you've read Bill Bryson's work before, you'll understand how well written and interesting his books are.  A really enjoyable read!
B00G32QIEG|3.0|This was a good movie for what it is. Yes it has a lot of the same feel as Men in Black but it is a good movie with several funny parts in it that will have you rolling in the floor. I wouldn't necessarily recommend buying it but it is for sure a movie you should rent and at least watch once or twice.
0811879542|5.0|I got this book for my niece, and I haven't given it her yet. The only problem is I love it so much, I don't want to part from it. So fun!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is very easy to pick up and play but not so easy to master. It is a lot of fun to try though. It's a great way to fill any extra time you may find.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I think this was an extremely well written series. I am not a cryer in general but this is a definite tear jerker, nose stopper, cry so hard your head hurts kind of ending. You want to read the last few chapters privately. Trust me!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's so easy to setup and use. Playing YouTube on your TV can't be easier. We love it. Great value.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game has beautiful graphics and puzzles that are difficult enough to challenge without being so obscure that you need a walkthrough to complete them. I have needed the hints a few times but once they get you back on track you can continue exercising your mind! One major hint: when stuck be sure to try using the eyepiece and look at different things! Well worth the paltry $2!
0385537131|5.0|love john grisham all the legal thrillers he has ever done<br />don't care or haven't much for non legal thriller stuff
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is excellent. Life sometimes play cruel tricks on us thAt affect what we become in life. Life is a bitch and sometime it takes A lifetime to figure it out.  I hope that before the end of the series he can move pass the past and find happiness.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Finally a good weather app. I tried at least four others, but none were very good, including the weather channel app. The updated Accuweather app is awesome.  Easy to see hourly and extended daily forecasts for several locations. Also has weather related videos nicely integrated. The map feature is nice too. This has all the info you need wrapped in an easy to use interface.
1594203334|2.0|I really wanted to like this book- I had heard so many good things. But unfortunately I found it to be extremely repetitive and had to force myself to finish reading it. There are some great points- (introducing many foods to children, not just &#34;children's&#34; food- encouraging children to explore the world around them before being forced into &#34;learning&#34; about it, including children in adult activities and making them feel like people and treating them as such from infancy) but they could be summed up in an article; not a book that goes on, and on, and on... and on. I also found it to be a bit too idealistic about the French way of raising children- there is a clear slant; but &#34;Americans&#34; love to romanticize France anyway, right? Seemed like another &#34;jump on the French women are better&#34; bandwagon book to me... bleh. Maybe it was the author's tone of writing? Something about this book just took some great points and made it a drag to keep reading.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Plot, character set, venue - all aligned with &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;.  So not a lot of time getting used to the background. Takes place only three years after the Hailey trial - Jake and family are still reeling from the financial fall out.  Plot is roiling with old South racial hangover.  And Grisham finds another soft spot - another way dramatic way to portray the smoldering race hatred that existed in the mid 1980 (and probably still does to some degree today.  Grisham is a great story teller - I've read most of them and enjoy all of them.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very fun and addicting game ! A Great mindless way to pass time! Kiddies love to watch and try to help:)
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It's easy to use and like being able to keep in touch with family. Games are great too. Thanks for the wonderful app.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I loved to play this game on the computer I'm very happy I get to play it on my kindle since I use my kindle more than my computer<br />Tina
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|it is the best game I have. I play it every day. I love it. It is the best. I think everybody should have it.
B001I82RVS|4.0|the movie is like nothing else, it is gore taken to a ridicules extreme. It is something a person would either love or hate but if you have the since of humor for it, it rocks.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  We were introduced to new characters who were awesome.  At times I got a little bored but it ended really nicely. I usually almost always give five stars but I just got bored a lot. I only read it because I wanted to read this series in order. Anyways, good job.
B009JZVT70|5.0|love this show. the season brought a lot more characters in, all beloved characters from fairy tales past - some with a twist of course. they start to explore what truly makes someone evil and whether someone could be still have good pieces in their heart - and what makes someone good go bad.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|ok<br />I was drawn into the. atmosphere. And experienced the horrors sadness<br />and joy of  characters<br /><br />who became my reality. descriptive countries l would like to<br /><br /> I<br /><br />visit.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Once I started reading, I became fixated on the story as it unfolded.  Finished it in a day. Ms. Flynn is a talented writer and understands the nuances of interpersonal relationships, psychopathology and suspence.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I like this game a lot. Can't believe it is a free game. So worth the download. I think everyone should get this game. The best graphics in a app game i have seen. Great job everyone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this app! It's challenging completing quests and you'll have a lot of fun doing it! There are also hundreds of levels so you'll never run out of quests although you may lose five time and be out of lives for a while but you can more lives by asking your friends on Facebook. I highly recommend this app for anyone who's reading this but beware you might become addicted to this game like me!
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|The DVD got here in one piece.  It may be months before I have a chance to review it.  Since I love Shakespeare, I'm sure it'll be grand.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I have been looking forward to the release of this book since I stayed up all night reading Insurgent last spring.  Unfortunately I was left feeling disappointed and frustrated with the author.  The plot was much slower than the first two novels, although that oftens happens in trilogies.  This could have been forgiven with a satisfying ending, but unfortunately that was not too be either.  I was left feeling like the whole thing was a waste of time =(
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I love it but the only thing I don't like about It  is it will change once the  video is over
B00338QENI|5.0|This gripping story gets to the heart of ethical issues in medicine and the effects on people - in the past and today.
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|Fantastic movie. This is by far the best production of Much Ado About Nothing yet available.  All the actors are great, but Clark Gregg abd Reed Diamond really make this movie.
007174889X|5.0|Oh please. Nothing comes close. People will complain all day that its too boring or its too wordy or too detailed.... That is bullsh*t. This text teaches subjects in more detail than other books, yet its words are as simplified as possible to do that. It's like a computer wrote it. Deep blue. Except a computer with human emotion - better yet, passion. The brightest doctors with the most theoretical understanding read this book. You don't have to read it back to front, but so many topics are discussed by authors that are top of the field. Literally ground-breaking pioneers and trailblazers of medicine. This book is my go to reference. Anything more is a primary source.
B004TNGLW0|3.0|I mean its cool and all but not really 300 bucks cool and they never sent my humidor solution.  Love the movie though
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|Avril's Self Titled Studio Fifth Album. First Album For Epic and Reuniting Her With The Man Who Originally Discovered Avril Back When She Was 16 Who Also Executive Produced Her Debut Let Go..Mixes Let Go With Her Best Album The Best Damn Thing. AVRIL IS THE PUNK VERSION OF PETER PAN..REFUZING TO GROW UP..AND WANTING TO STAY FOREVER YOUNG..WHO CAN't resist That..This Album Is Explicit for Good Reasons..Besides who Really Buys Edited Music anyway. I have The Target Version With The Bonus Acoustic Track Of Rock N Roll.
B0071QIN00|5.0|A great game. You should definitely get this game. I downloaded it and I love to play it. And I'm a girl!
B00AKFG15S|4.0|Although I gave the previous two volumes in this series 5 stars, this book revolved a lot around British politics and elections.  As the author is a politician himself, it is not surprising.  However, that subject bores me and I found  myself skipping pages to get past that section.  The rest of the book, however, is as good as Volumes 1 and 2.  I thought this book was the third in a trilogy however, the author writes at the end that the series could go to as many as 7 volumes and the fourth will be out in 2014 - something to look forward to.  With the exception of the politics, this book is as good as the 2 previous books.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|This is what i expected to get with my selection of this product. Please continue to do the same moving forward.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Unique writing style. Couldn't put my Kindle down. Loved the use of the two 'voices.' Didn't have a clue as to how it would end.
B003INBNXO|5.0|This is what i expected to get with my selection of this product. Please continue to do the same moving forward.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Hamlet is played by Branagh. It is a great study of the great play.I prefer the version that Zeffirelli does with Mel Gibson as Hamlet. this one by Branagh is the entire play without any editing and is truly a grand production with a grand cast...
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|This is what i expected to get with my selection of this product. Please continue to do the same moving forward.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy hdmi and network installation, perfect and bright display of content, simple usage for Youtube, Netflix and audio only content.
0345026241|5.0|At first it was difficult to read because I spent too much time trying to decipher the Nadsat. Once you loosen up and just read through the strange words, you will begin to enter the wild reality that Burgess has created.
B001D7CHAA|5.0|Covers a broad spectrum of insight on a very relevant subject. I recommend this writer. I found most of the content helpful.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|This was a gift for my favorite Beatles fan. It is an excellent compilation that encompasses all the Beatles releases. Any rock music fan should have this volume
B004DSX5B6|4.0|Pretty sturdy and it is a bit heavier than I expected. but doesn't matter. I really liked the make and the way the rest of the tools are hidden inside.
031603438X|5.0|A fantastic look at the Rolling Stones guitarist. His recall of his life is tremendous, especially when you consider all he has been through. This is truly a great book.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|It's really above any racing game, only issue is lag but it's still really awsome I recommend this game to anyone
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I am 10 and I tryed this and it a really works I was shocked but I do think that there should be more sounds. but I honestly like it alot! :-) :-)<br />I like it alot ! ;-)
B008MEM24S|5.0|I liked it a lot because on the first level it was very easy, but on the last level it was very very hard.  I could barely do it.
B009Y6OIWC|4.0|Awesome, easy to use. Just wish I could figure out how to see the &#34;shared&#34; calendars of others on this app.
B004QYTRRS|5.0|Adventure, buttoned-down Brits, intrigue, Jolie, romance, Venice, action, Depp, classic boats, Timothy Dalton, and the nutcase Russian general bad guy from Octopussy...'nuff said!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Beautifully written. The author takes you on adventure that spans nearly a century. A tale of tragedy and loss, but also perseverance, strength and hope. Best of all, love and life triumph in the end. What a breath of fresh air!
B002361MLA|5.0|This is a great book that teaches how to live the moment. It stresses catching the wandering mind as it travels to the past or the future and bringing it back to the now which is all we have.<br />The whole book  is in a question and answer format. My advice is to read it slowly and try to make progress as you delve in the material.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love this app but I wish that you could make some more towers and that you can have more than 1 specialty building on at once
B009R54MGW|5.0|Philippa Gregory at her best - need I say more! Just love her books. I always wait impatiently for the next book by her.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book is just filled with words bunched together under o.e tittle and it didn't put anything in alphabetical order like a regular dictionary
B0031R5K68|5.0|I normally focus on historical fiction and contemporary romance, but I really enjoy a bit of Dan Brown at times. He is such a master of his genre, there just isn't anyone to touch him.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Accuweather app is a pretty good app.  Gives you all the pertinent information that you would want and need, all in one glance.  Decided not to upgrade to pro version because most of the reviews state that you lose some of the information that is contained in free version. So with that sais, I can live the advertising, it doesn't interfere with app information, so all in all, it's pretty good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|sup well some of these cheap minecrafts are lame but this is the real deal.this is probably the best game I played now its your choice to get it or leave it alone
1476727651|5.0|One of his best novels to date. I felt the chill of fear that only Mr. King can provide. A rich look into the life Of Danny Torrance. I have already read it twice. Awesome.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I read this on the recommendation of a co-worker and I was not disappointed. It was hard to put down at times and I loved the imagery.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because the writer overused the words \\"rapt\\" and \\"save\\"'.  Other than that, I really enjoyed it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is the best app ever you need to get this! if you want to be happy get this app now!:) ;) it is supper silly and creative you will get obsested with it that's a good thing. at least check it out you will be glad you took my word for it! BYE! :):) :) ;) not :(!
B00FLNRN06|4.0|It was a very funny movie, I fast forward at some parts but actually had to rewind to laugh at them.. thank you.
B000002TLX|1.0|Should Have Known better has some energy - the rest is sap.  I thought Marx had some more upbeat songs but I guess not.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|When you play this in your blu ray player you either win or you die.  Just kidding. You only win.  Great picture, great sound, great special features, and great show.  Just buy the dang thing already, TV slayer.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|This game is pretty good. I thought it would be one of those cheesy pool games that lack the dynamics of actual billiards, but this is impressive. It is fun to have actual live opponents to challenge. keep up the good work.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The link beyond me to the app store...then the open button won't open.... how to I undo the update??? A little frustrated at this point
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A story of honor, bravery, and amazing events.  Fascinating information about life in the German Luftwaffe.  Well written in an engaging manner.  Loved it.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|I wanted to read this after having so many friends saying it was great and love the series. It starts off great, Piper could be any girl next door. however, once she get to prison, the details get fewer and less believable. I found the story to progress without the dirty details. She describes prison as a horrible summer camp mostly and while I don't doubt it was awful,  her writing fails to communicate much about anything. Her relationship with Nora and subsequently her homecoming are after thoughts it seems and that is where the redemption story lies.I felt as if it was incomplete.
B003L77GRO|5.0|This is one of those TV series that grabs you from episode #1 and won't let go - I've pre-ordered the final season of Dexter to add to my collection
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a fun game for anyone. I am so happy that it is finally out for Kindle Fire!  I hope I wont have to connect to social media to get further in the game. That is why four stars.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|When i read the first sentence i knew this was going to be a good book. A riveting story of witches and vampires and daemons all in a hidden world, divided yet inextricably linked through their need for secrecy in the face of the humans. It all starts with a book....
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I don't have facebook nor do I want one so to play I have to pay. To many games available that don't drain your wallet.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I have probably read six or seven Harry Bosch novels, now.  Connelly's books are more than detective stories with the same formula every time.  They are also novels with masterful prose and great character development.  This book gave me a lot more insight into the character that is Harry Bosch, and an understanding of why he is the way he is.  Read this book and jump into the world of Harry Bosch.  It won't be the last.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very easy to use, amazing price, brings new features too old TV sets, changes the way of watch youtube and Netflix!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very well written first time reading from this author will enjoy reading more from this author. I enjoyed following the characters so much is true about Destiny
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Memorable. Unique. Uplifting. Motivating. Funny. Lighthearted. Poignant. Genuine. Tear-jerker. The common denominator. Endearing. Unifying. Painful life lessons. Suffering births kindness.
1594202273|5.0|This book by Mr. Schlosser offers a very compelling reason why we should never take any pronouncement from our government as necessarily true and factual particularly on the subject of military defense.  But what makes the story even more interesting are the errors committed by those whom we have expected to make them the least.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The google Chromecast is easy to use, great video reproduction and easy to install.<br />What is better than watching Breaking Bad streaming from NetFlix on the 60&#34; LCD?
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|I truly love this game! It is very challenging and fun to relieve stress on.  This game will make you do some quick strategy in your thinking.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love being able to play this game on my Kindle.  It's so addictive.  The game plays well and syncs pretty well with my progress on my phone.  Thank you for finally getting this..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A really simple game with a frustratingly addictive nature. I'm happy it finally appeared on Kindle.so much easier to play here than on my phone although I have a 5 inch screen. Thank you candy crush!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this because it is really fun creative and it is high decision you can run a lot an  have a lot of fun you fight with evil people and the velien are fun to beat
0517548232|3.0|Fairly good - - but a little too technical - - read but not nearly as 'easy to understand' as advertised.  Really didn't learn anything new about economics as anticipated.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I have read every book this man has written and have never been disappointed.  Once you start, you won't want to stop reading.  This story was so heartwarming, and as always, goes right up there with the best of the best \\"Feel-good\\" books!
B004TI5N38|4.0|love all his books.  this one did not disappoint.  looking forward to reading more john puller. And trying the Robie books as well.
0812993292|4.0|It went on a bit long , but I enjoyed the ride. I am glad that it was recommended .
B00632HWOG|5.0|I'm able to view my mails and quickly &#34;decide&#34; what to do with them. Makes checking email fast when I'm in a hurry...
B00881VLCE|5.0|Best app I have found. It's great to do puzzles on the go. Can't wait to download more beautiful pictures.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Works pretty good for keeping up with things, just wish I could access my Facebook apps from the actual app...
B00BSZZA3I|4.0|I bought 2 of these and mine has held up better than my girlfriends has.  Hers flipped open too wide a few times and bent out of shape.  It's a nice case but not 100% practical for daily use and ease.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Kids and I love this game!  MINIONS so demonstrative , but no matter the device the game continually freezes up...anyone else have this issue and the solution? I have un~installed and re-installed which seems to help a bit but not a long term solution.
0345528581|5.0|This is a lot harder than you think it should be. I'm no string bean but most of this stuff kicked my butt
B00755MHV8|5.0|Simple tips that everyone can use. Could do with more real-life examples, and a little less selling of LinkedIn. A good read for early-to-mid career professionals
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I purchased this for my daughter for her birthday. I think she liked it. We watched them all the first day.
B005K17RU0|5.0|You can have lots of places set up and it is very accurate. Definitely the best weather app out there.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Not a whole lot happens in this vol but its still full of wonderful descriptions . words , phrases, events and experiences.<br /> Danerys really is kind of stupid/ naive, Bram may really be a tree and You Know nothing ,Jon Snow.
B00E9A656K|3.0|This is a good game but I'm tired of the restriction of gas. I want to play by my own will, not have to wait to play again. There are already adds.
B00E9A656K|4.0|Played on a phone first  and even with the graphics enlarged they still look good. Don't like the concept of limited turns though
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game. Was so happy to be able to play it on my kindle! Thank you for making it available!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Seriously one of the most enjoyable reads I've ever had. It made me relive my youth in a lot of ways. I did not want the story to end.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This app is awful. It gave totally wrong info. It called for 80% chance of snow. And what do I get, no snow!! Needless to say this app SUCKS!!!!
