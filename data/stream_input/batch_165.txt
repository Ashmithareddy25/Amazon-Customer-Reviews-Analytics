B00000IGGA|5.0|Mule Variations is perhaps one of the best albums Tom Waits has ever made. It's an amalgam of the melancholy ballads of 'The Heart of Saturday Night' and 'Blue Valentine' that characterised his early career, and the unique groove and ambition of his later work (such as 'Rain Dogs') under the Island label. What's more is that it combines the best elements of both. Ultimately, Mule Variations is an example of how good Waits can be - he takes the listener on an emotional journey full of sadness, happiness and reflection.     <br />Waits has always been unique. Over time, there has been a plethora of musicians that imitate, to varying degrees of success, Waits' original and idiosyncratic style. Often he uses instruments like plane saws, xylophones and pump organs. This is especially so in Mule Variations, in which he uses a wide variety of instruments to full effect. Added to which, his cancerous drawl transcends each piece of music to a higher emotional plane, especially in such pieces as 'Lowside of the Road' and 'Eyeball Kid'. If its evocative music you're after, Mule Variations certainly delivers. Ballads such as 'Picture in a Frame' and 'Hold On' tickle the back of your throat, but if you don't cry after listening to 'Take it With Me' then something is definitely wrong with you. He balances the sadness and melancholy of the aforementioned songs with more forceful pieces such as the full on 'Big in Japan' and the heavy crashing of 'Filipino Box Spring Hog'. These last two are the sort of music that typified Waits' Island years (see 'Underground' and 'Down in the Hole'). Throughout the 70 minute CD (great value with 16 songs available), Waits also peppers the album with bizarre numbers such as the spoken 'What's he Building?' which chills the listener to the bone; the glockenspiel-inflected 'Black Market Baby' and the heart wrenching tale of 'Georgie Lee', the story of a murdered teenage girl. <br />Ultimately Mule Variations is 70 minutes of Waits at his best. It confirms that Waits is truly a musical statesman that stands alone from the rest of the pack. Musicians such as David Bowie and Elvis Costello have praised his musical talent for a long time, and Mule Variations is the perfect of example of why. It's an album like no other, totally varied in musical and emotional content. So whether or not you're looking for an introduction to Waits' music or if you are a true, die-hard fan, Mule Variations should be on your CD rack.
0062502182|5.0|Since humans first tried to make sense of their lives, the basic medium for this exercise has been the story.  All the great religions begin with a story.  It is the power of those stories that has touched the hearts of countless generations and allowed each genertion to discover meaning.<br />  You can preach for hours on God's love, a gracious universe, grace, the power of a kind act, courage in facing fears and the only way it will be remembered is if you place your message in the context of a story.  Such a story speaks not to the intellect of the audience but to their hearts.  Such is the importance of fables.<br /> The Alchemist is such a tale.  As described in every other review, it follows the wanderings of a young man named Santiago, as he journies across North Africa in seacrch of his dreams.  It is a journey of transformation and discovery.  The tale is exotic, mysterious, and often suspensful.  Like all such tales, it has a generous portion of wisdom to be passed on as the reader follows the experiences of young Santiago.     Very little of the wisdom contained in the story will be entirely new to anyone, but then, that is not the point of a fable.  The author reminds us of things that we already know, giving us a new story upon which to frame our heart's wisdom.  Coelho's wisdom is not theory but draws on experiences that have deeply touched his life. He has pursued his dream and wandered enough to know the associated frustrations and joys. It is evident in the book. I'm quite happy with the result.<br /> Coelho's fable joins a small number of similar tales that have been both financial and inspirational successes in recent decades.  The genre evokes strong reactions.  Fables like the Alchemist, The Prophet, or Jonathan Livingston Seagull are either fawned over or ridiculed as so much hot air.  To consider the genre to be so much hot air (as does the Kirkus reviewer) betrays an ignorance of the genre that should move the wise critic to refrain from offering his or her uninformed opinion. However, neither should the reader treat such tales as divine revelation.<br /> The course of wisdom is somewhere in between.  This genre speak to the heart and not necessarily the intellect.  The logic of these stories is that of dreams not the intellect.  Even then, not all fables are of equal value.  The message being shared is important.  Does the story ring true to life, offering practical wisdom?  Or, is it simply platitudes being offered in hushed tones and carefully marketed?     As I read through The Alchemist and other works by Paulo Coelho I was pleased to discover numerous insights hidden away in off handed comments.  Many of these insights are not new but were reached on my own over the years.  I take this as confirmation of the substance of Coelho's message and the fact that he has traveled the path himself.     The Alchemist is neither sacred scripture, a philosophical treatise, nor a post-modern deconstruction of contemporary social values.  Rather, it is an enjoyable tale that has much to say to the heart.
0446364495|1.0|I picked up Bridges because of all the hype surrounding it and ended up throwing it against a wall. The writing is sappy, cliched and straight out of Freshman English 101. It also defied logic. Bridges is a shinning example of the power of publicity. I was very, very disappointed.
6300214753|5.0|&quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&quot; is a classic movie about a popular troublemaker named Ferris (Matthew Broderick) and a day that he skipped high school. He gets his girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara), and one of his friends, Cameron (Alan Ruck), to spend the day with him. Ferris is taking the day off from high school because he wants to show Cameron what it's like to have some fun instead of being so uptight and worried about everything. Principal Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) is upset at Ferris and wants to catch him live in his act because this is the ninth school day that Ferris has missed this semester.<br />&quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&quot; is great because it has many classic parts such as when Ferris decides to take Cameron's father's car for a ride, Principal Rooney's expedition to Ferris's house, and all the pranks that Ferris pulls to keep from being caught such as the dummy that snores in the bed. Myself, I skipped a few days in high school just because I was sick of school and wanted to take a day off. If you ever made your parents think you were sick and then they went to work and you just did what you wanted to the rest of the day instead of going to school, you'll like this movie even better. <br />I recommend anybody who likes comedy movies or anyone who ever played hookie before in high school to get &quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off.&quot; Trust me, you won't be disappointed
B00005AUBA|4.0|Mogwai are one of those groups whose sound develops and progresses with each album release.This latest release sees them develop the slow,haunting crescendo driven sound of their last c.d.,but this time they've added new instruments and there is also far more vocal involvement.<br /> The c.d. is quite short-38 minutes,but this means the tracks no longer meander in a way that you get the feeling they're just killing some time.In fact there are no real weak moments on this c.d.Guitar instrumentals still dominate this atmosphere,but several of the tracks now feature the gentle almost whispered vocals that were only on one track of the previous c.d.Gruff Rhys of the Super Furry Animals makes an absolutely glorious vocal appearance on track 4.I think this song is sung in Welsh and when added to the strings of Dave Fridmann of Mercury Rev fame it's just a most beautiful track.In fact string backing and even brass or horn section appear on 3 other tracks.The first track also experiments with Radiohead type distorted machines going mad sound.Almost all the songs have a slow tempo and the guitar work is a mix of soft acoustic building up to ever louder electric.This is a group who excel in creating a eerie and melancholic atmosphere and this c.d. is best suited to one listen in it's entirety.<br /> This is Mogwai at their most rewarding and also their most accessible and this album should not just be stuck in the confines of the post-rock market.If you like music that's laidback and yet has tons of atmosphere,well then this c.d. is for you.
B0000524CY|5.0|Words can't explain how disturbing and shocking this movie is!! this movie will chill your bone and leave you breathless and shocking! Who really cares about all the features you can get becuase the movie is all you need and you will know what I mean when I say shocking, scary, and disturning! watch this movie and you will know what I mean! The Exorcist is one of the greatest movies ever....!! read the book as well!! it too will take you on a ride you will never forget!
B0000524CY|4.0|...One of the reasons I purchased this DVD was for the Spanish subtitles advertised on the back cover. When I tried to select this option on my player, I was very surprised to discover that it only gave me TWO options (English and French) instead of the FOUR languages advertised on the packaging (English, French, Spanish and Portuguese).... <br />Another thing I noticed was that the \\"restored\\" Dolby 5.1 soundtrack was sadly lacking. As a test, I decided to raise the volume on my TV quite a bit during the more terrifying moments of the soundtrack, and the sound that emanated from the TV sounded much more Mono than Stereo. I have to admit that my judgement regarding the sound may have been biased because of my discovery of the false advertising I just mentioned. But, overall, I regretted purchasing this DVD.<br />Another minor disappointment (although this may matter little to most) was that being able to more easily analyze the \\"spider walk\\" scene on the DVD, I realized how little the stunt person in that scene resembles Linda Blair. To me, this discovery softened the effect of this scene, in comparison to the very first time that I saw that scene in the theatre with that terrifying and unnerving accompanying soundtrack. Oh well, you can't win 'em all.
0553277472|2.0|I don't get it.  All of this praise for a book with a misogynistic, selfish a-hole for a main character?  A road trip with your child is something to be savored between the two; yet I remember reading only two or three conversations between them.  Granted, it's difficult to talk while riding a motorcycle, but you have to get off of it sometimes.  <br />And one of the few conversations is when Chris is told people are saying that he has mental/emotional problems.  When you think of everything the poor kid had to go through with that nutcase of a father, I don't think Chris is the one with the problems.<br />The book is not about philosophy; it's the rantings of a schizzo whose parenting skills make Joan Crawford look like June Cleaver.

B00005B4GU|4.0|the liquid of life into my brain, filling in the dead spots. Either that or I'm going mad. Sometimes I can't decide whether or not Radiohead is the perfect group of musicians, or if I'm so hooked on them by circumstance that they can release whatever garbage they want and I will call it genius. Such were my thoughts after buying Kid A, and so they are now after listening to Amnesiac. From the opening track to the end (I first listened to it without pause) I seriously wondered if the band was laughing its collective heads off when releasing this album, knowing how ignorant us fans are of their screwing around in a studio for a day and calling what became of it an album. So of course, the first time I listened to it I hated it. I was so dissapointed. How could a band that released the genius that was OK Computer put out such nonsense? The next day I woke up in a cold sweat, and immediately turned on my CD player to make sure I was right. A similar pattern has continued up untill now...and I can't stop. I still can't pick it apart like I should be able to in a meaningfull review. All I know about this album is that it strikes a chord in me that I now need chimed on a regular basis. If I don't listen to songs like &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; and &quot;I might be wrong&quot; at least twice a day, my movements become shaky and mechanical. Amnesiac has become the motor oil that keeps me working right. Seeing them live recently at the Gorge in George, WA has proven to me that this CD was no fluke, no mistake. They were able to not only reproduce many songs on this album live, but transform them into live, energetic masterpieces. Responding to other reviews here, I think that it's safe to say that it is almost impossible to like every Radiohead album. Personally, I am madly in love with OK Computer on, but have more respect than personal appreciation for Pablo Honey and The Bends. I know this won't help you in your decision to buy this album or not, this is more of an explanation of my personal relationship with Radiohead than anything else. But there's a lot to be said for a band that can put out an album that a simple fan like me can have a 'relationship' with. It's kind of wierd and sick to have a relationship with something as cold as a CD, but right now I feel like I can't live without it, and that's right up there in the list of qualifications for a relationship. Either these men are musical visionaries, or they have proven the effectiveness of subliminal messaging.
0380733358|5.0|when i'm looking for a change of pace from classic classics (like &quot;war and peace&quot;, &quot;the brothers karamazov&quot;, &quot;the tale of genji&quot;, &quot;don quijote&quot;, etc.) it's wonderful to sit back, relax, and read some classic suspense. and in this respect follett really is superb value. you get strong characters, strong plotting, and, for the picky literature buffs among us, you get strong writing -- not to be underestimated!! if you are reading this review i have little doubt you will love, &quot;eye of the needle.&quot; don't stop here, though! pick up some of follet's other books, too. then pick up wilbur smith, particularly, &quot;the eye of the tiger&quot;, &quot;the sunbird&quot;, &quot;wild justice&quot; and the family sagas. then pick up james herbert's &quot;rats&quot; trilogy -- &quot;rats&quot;, &quot;lair&quot;, and &quot;domain.&quot; and for relief from all this suspense, read &quot;don quijote&quot; for laughs. it's one of the great wonders of the world.
0792101448|5.0|By today's standard, Once Upon a Time in the West could have played like a video.  The close-up shots, mood and atmosphere makes for a stirring story.  Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson and Jason Robards truly stole the show.  I was truly mesmerized by Charles and moved by Jason.  Henry played the perfect villian, with Claudia being the damsel in distress.  Claudia certainly packed a truckload of sensuality in this movie.  More than just a &quot;spaghetti western&quot;, this movie packs style, daring-do (the scene with the family when Henry and his men shoot them all in cold blood) and lots and lots of revenge galore!!! I also like the cameo appearance with Woody Strode and Jack Elam waiting at the train station.  I think this move is and was ahead of it's time and worth the hours they put into it.  A must see
B00004YW6I|4.0|P.J. Harvey does a nice job at a variety of things. She rocks hardcore, but knows when to quiet down. I repect both her guitar work and her vocals. The songs are tight and well written, not to mention genuinly interesting, the rarest of all things in current radio. Her duet with Thom York from Radiohead, &quot;This Mess We're In,&quot; is a standout, as are &quot;Good Fortune,&quot; &quot;You Said Something,&quot; &quot;We Float,&quot; and &quot;Kamikaze.&quot; If you saw her perform &quot;You Said Something&quot; on Letterman and liked it a lot, expect more of the same, but don't be surprised by something different. Polly Jean is a rocker at heart, but she isn't one note by any stretch of the imagination.
0930289331|5.0|Prior to rating this title, I had yet to give any comic book 5 stars.  I am not at all hesitant about giving this book that rating.  I must say, as I've said before, that this rating does come with the understanding that this is a comic book and not a novel--the two media accomplish entirely different things.  That said, this was far from the average, run-of-the-mill Batman yarn (well, while it's very much about Batman, it's just as much if not moreso James Gordon's story).  But to me, that shows a kind of maturity.  And I believe this book requires some maturity from the reader, too--not because it's gritty so much (it's not objectionable, or hardly at all), but really because this book is not through-and-through a ripping action story.  It has such parts, but it's much more an introduction to the characters themselves, as individuals rather than as masked entities.  I'd recommend it to anyone who's old enough to care what might happen to the alter-egos and the &quot;normal&quot; people (i.e. Gordon himself) when the monthly plots aren't going full-swing...more &quot;mainstream,&quot; I'd say, for the non-fans in the world, than the typical superhero monthlies.
6302732875|5.0|Jack Lemmon has given many, many brilliant performance, but his subtle work in &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; is his best. He is sad, touching, loveable, frightened, desperate, and tragic. He is the centerpeice of a film that would have worked on the strength of the scriipt alone. Despite the fact that it consists only of real estate workers sitting and talking shop, the film is thrilling and easy enough to understand on an emotional level. It's my favorite movie from a Mammet script, partly because he leaves the gimicks alone and allows the actors to develop interesting and unique characters rather than to just say the words for the sake of the audience hearing them.  <br />It's a great film and worth getting just to see Jack Lemmon. That's all the motivation that anyone should need.
B0000508U6|4.0|Here's the track-by-track review:<br />1. \\"Don't Panic\\": Very cool instrument use. I think the lead singer, Chris', voice is very spooky.<br />2. \\"Shiver\\": An upbeat rock song in the beginning. It sounds like '90's rock, like at a college radio station.<br />3. \\"Spies\\": Kinda slow, with the kinda slow guitar. The whispery voice of Chris is back.<br />4. \\"Sparks\\": The guitar chords are nice. I like the violins in the background.<br />5. \\"Yellow\\": This is a very sweet and sad song. It's beautiful. I can't say too much else.<br />6. \\"Trouble\\": I like the piano part at the beginning. Then all the instruments come in and it just sounds really cool.<br />7. \\"Parachutes\\": For only 45 seconds, this 'song' is really quiet and cool.<br />8. \\"High Speed\\": The song title has nothing to do with the song. It's a moving kinda song.<br />9. \\"We Never Change\\": Nice little guitar intro. The whispery voice comes in again.<br />10. \\"Everything's Not Lost\\": I like the guitar playing. It sounds like the lead singer playing it.<br />Overall review: 4 stars: A good CD (considering this is not their first CD.) Brilliant songwriting and awesome instruments make up a huge part of this CD.
0451196716|3.0|The Long Walk is a good Stephen King novel.  It is not as polished refined or focused as other efforts, but as with almost all of his work it is spirited reading.  The work introduces us to the parallel King universe of Richard Bachman, where it is indicated that the view is more dark and cynical.<br /> As many of Stephen King's novels, the novel itself is an examination of the human experience as depicted and revealed through exceptional circumstances.  Although not as poetic, I liken the Long Walk to Cool Hand Luke.  Both the book and the movie concentrate on flawed savior figures, in which we can easily identify ourselves, placed in constrained circumstances.<br /> The Long Walk centers around Ray Garrity who has elected to participate in the Long Walk, which is an endurance walking contest for young men.  In this surreal parallel universe, the familiar geography of our United States is controlled by an unnamed marshal force.  The controlling government challenges the fortitude of its young men, suggesting participation in a suicide contest.  The rules are simple: the boys must continue walking at a pace of 4.0 mph or better.  If a contestant fails, after three (3) warnings, to maintain this speed; he is shot and killed on the spot.  There is only one winner, the last boy walking, and to him goes the satisfaction of any wish and whim he desires.  <br /> While the horror or imminent and random death is the backdrop for the story, the substance lies in the examination of the individual participants and their individual reasons for participating.  Garrity commiserates with those in his like lot. Engaging in discussions about the meanings of their lives, the boys examine their individual reasons for their participation, and form personal alliances for survival which seemingly go against the individual's chance for ultimate success.  The main character, Garrity, is forced to examine himself and the reason for his participation.  The circumstances are complicated whena stoic participant turns out to be the Major's (the symbol of Marshal law and host of the contest) son.  Garrity is required to contemplate whether the ultimate reward is worthy of his participation.<br />In many senses, the Long Walk is an extended and perhaps stretched allegory of life itself.  The vagaries of life and death and the people and acquaintances we meet along the way.  The Long Walk is definitely an enjoyable book that is filled with the texture that King lovers have come to appreciate.  However, it is not as broad, accomplished or refined as other works, such as It, The Shining, The Body or Shawshank Redemption; or as horrifically well executed as Pet Sematary or Salem's Lot.

B00005B4GU|5.0|I am a recent fan of Radiohead. If you consider Paranoid Android  recent. That was the first song to grab my attention and I have been impressed ever since. Kid A was the first cd I bought from them and I was so impressed that I bought Amnesiac nearly on reputation. All I can say is buy it! These albums are going to be classics! This cd is Dali put to music. Early Genesis, some recent King Crimson, and Laurie Anderson have laid the groundwork for what Radiohead is doing now. It is nice to see that surrealism is still alive and well in the 21st Century. If you are truely progressive and willing to listen several times in order to get the full meaning,  than Amnesiac is for you.
0380973839|5.0|I read Martian Chronicles not knowing what to expect. I had found it on a list of books i had to chose from, read, and write a report on. At first I found some of the stories (or chapters, or diary entries if you wish to call them that) quite odd. The one involving the man who met the martians that would manifest strange things like nude flame women that would crawl out of their mouths. Yet as odd as it was, I couldn't put it down. I just kept reading, and in the end, I enjoyed every moment of it.      It's one of those books that really gets you thinking. It helps you realize the brutality of the human way, and that is an important thing for all to be aware of. Because of that, I rate it as one of the best science fiction books of all time. One of sci-fi's most noted autors, Phil Dick, said that science fiction isn't science fiction becuase it has spaceships, takes place in the future, and has advanced technology. That is simply just a story that takes place in the future where technology became more abundant. He said that science fiction is much more deep and always has a metaphor of some sort, a relationship with life itself, that makes it much more deep in meaning. This story is a shinning example of that.      I recomend Martian Chronicles to anyone and everyone. Even if you don't know how to appreciate great science fiction, you may still learn from it for what it is. Ray Bradbury's writing style itself would also warrant you to getting this book. He's an excelent author that can not only weave an incredible tale, but he can do it in such a way that the words flow smooth like wine and never sound awkward, always welcoming you to continue on with the journey that he has set forth on paper. Now that I've told you how great it is, GO GET THIS BOOK!
0783211856|5.0|This movie is in my opinion, the most important movie of all time. This movie could be a social lesson about racism. I would hope that after viewing this movie, we could really all learn to get along. It is powerful, moving, and brillant. The realism of the Holocaust is shown with brutal honesty. From the scene where the children in the camps are removed by the terrified parents, to the women thinking they are in a gas chamber to realize they are actually in a shower room, Spielberg gives a glimpse of the horror of one of the most dark moments in humanity. The acting is all first rate. Liam Neeson gives a beautiful portrayal of a man who changes his view of &quot;his workers&quot;. From a entreprenuer who is seeking the bottom line to a man who is on a mission to save as many people as he can, Neeson captures the role. Ralph Fiennes gives a chilling performace. To play a man who does not care about the value of another human being that is not of his ilk...no words can describe it.<br />From a critical standpoint, any other movie Spielberg does may make more money or be more popular, but THIS movie will be his artistic impression that is left in the industry. From a personal view, one of the final scenes when Schindler is leaving the plant and realizes he could have done more always touches me. This movie is a must for movie lovers.
B000059ZLH|2.0|All right, all DT fans are talkin bout what a great show it was, and in this DVD there's no question -- DT's musical talents are unparalleled!  I've always admired Portnoy's drumming skills, not to mention his awesome drum kit setup.  However, the audio here really sux.  What a way to spoil what could potentially be the greatest DVD of all time!  As a serious hi-fi enthusiast, I have to admit that I may be more forgiving in minor flaws on the video side and hey, I was willing to whack down my acceptance standards on the audio side of this one(if only to have in my collection one of the best music concerts on earth)!  But I just can't live with the audio on this one -- it's so thin and for a while I thought audio signal was only coming out in PCM stereo!  But even some PCM stereo-encoded DVDs sound better than this.  It's so disappointing!!! I'm returning this DVD to amazon.  To the manufacturers: Please investigate and correct the very poor audio quality.  C'mon guys, DT as well as we, DT fans deserve better than this!
B000001E8P|5.0|I had never heard Pulp before and was introduced to them by the song \\"Disco 2000\\" at a britpop dance club. I bought the album and have listened to it hundreds of times and since bought most of their albums. I have found that Pulp reaches deep inside me and Different Class reaches the furthest. It is clever & witty, sarcastic and humorous. I know everyone says it, but Jarvis Cocker is amazing. His voice I never get tired of, it is extremely passionate and soulful. I listen to this album more than any other and I never get tired of it. I find Mr. Cocker's voice is so embedded in my head now, listening to him is comforting and cozy. All the songs are so different and clever, I keep discovering new things in the lyrics and it becomes more brilliant everytime I hear it. I also like the pop, sometimes campy-keyboard music that serves as the backdrop for the lyrics. I have heard some people rip on the music, but I find it deliberately simple and quirky, perfect to showoff the lyrics.<br />I hate to say, this album is not for everyone. I think truly great albums don't reach mainstream audiences and Different Class is a perfect example of this; many people won't understand this album. But personally, I think the album is brilliant, it is my absolute favorite album. This would be my first choice if stranded on a deserted island. I highly recommend it if you are considering it for your collection.
B00004XONN|5.0|Not an album of 10 seperate songs, but a 10 movement symphony. Amazing. Best to listen to it in a dark room headphones on where you wont be disturbed. One of the most inventive and musical albums ever.
B000001FTD|4.0|While most consider this to be Anthrax's best release, I personally prefer &quot;Persistence of Time,&quot; but this is still a very strong record, worthy of all the acclaim it has received over the years. Most of the strongs are good to great, though I am not a fan of the Judge Dredd tribute &quot;I Am the Law&quot; and &quot;A.D.I.&quot; does drag on a bit too long. Nonetheless, overall this is a very good thrash album to pick-up.
068485015X|5.0|This book is a classic work by a new age psychiatrist which integrates psychology, traditional values and spiritual growth in a practical and usable format.  The book explains the meaning of love (extending oneself for one's own or another's spiritual growth), proposes that discipline and responsibility are necessary in order to grow spiritually, and helps the post-60's agnostics make peace with Christianity in a way that is understandable and comforting.  Although new age in doctrine, the book does not trash orthodox Christianity, but lets it be known that Christian spirituality can have a liberal new age focus as well as a conservative Biblical one. In fact The Road Less Traveled blends new age concepts of love with traditional orthodox Christian concepts of discipline and responsibility.  This book is singularly responsible for leading me back to Christianity after many years of searching for the truth.
B000000H3W|5.0|This is one of those very rare metal albums that I can without hesitation say is essentially perfect - it stands side-by-side with &quot;Reign in Blood,&quot; &quot;Persecution Mania,&quot; and &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; as one of the greatest thrash records ever made; each and every track is incredible. The riffs are very catchy and powerful, and Igor's drumming has only grown more proficient since &quot;Beneath&quot; (which is saying a lot). Max's vocals are deeper and more commanding than before, as is the production; there's even a great cover of Orgasmatron. Buy this album - you won't regret it.
B000002HRE|5.0|Metallica was, and is still, the greatest heavey metal band out there.  I fail to see why slower songs makes a band sellouts.  Both this album, and its predecessor, Load, remind me of another blues style hard rock band.  Maybe you've heard of them, Led Zepplin.  Zep is the greatest hard rock band ever, but their songs weren't about one guitar riff over and over with a guy screaming into the microphone. <br />Metallica changed styles of metal music right in front of our eyes.  They went from total thrash metal to what I call, real-music metal.  Thats a really difficult thing to do, yet Metallica has done it.  And done it well.<br />ReLoad is one of my favorite albums. I rank it right up there with Master of Puppets and ...And Justice for All.  I flat out love this cd.  I love it.  What impresses me most about it is that I can play it no matter what mood I'm in.  If I'm totally ticked off, I can put it on and get a nice surge of adrenaline.  If I'm laxadasical I can put it on and be totally mellow.<br />Metallica hasn't sold out. And ReLoad is a masterful cd.
B00000IMTG|4.0|A good representation of Rainbow live, with great solos from Ritchie. The song selection could be a bit better, with a medley of &quot;Man on the Silver Mountain&quot; and several others seeming a bit out of place. The highlight is &quot;Still I'm Sad,&quot; which is always quite incredible live.
B000002A3T|5.0|The release of \\"The Division Bell\\" was one of the most significant event in PF's history. I've listened to many of their albums which I disliked at all while \\"DB\\" makes me feeling smth like being on the top of the world. The album combines musical pieces appropriate for almost the all feelings people have - from sadness (\\"Marooned\\", \\"Wearing the Inside Out\\") to melancholy (\\"A Great Day for Freedom\\") to full of desire of life (\\"Take It Back\\", \\"Coming Back to Life\\") and at last futuristic, enigmatic state of your soul (\\"Keep Talking\\", High Hopes\\"). David Gilmour has fabulous voice which suits this music just right. The blending of the songs is great, too; it's made not worse than Enigma does. And there's no better way to imagine yourself being somewhere in the foggy Albion accompanies you during the whole \\"ball of sounds\\"!<br />It's strange to me why this album is still, after 7 years, under severe debates, dividing those who listen to it either to haters or to firm admirers. Still, I agree that The Division Bell has its right to be named as one of the most mystical and at the same time the most enchanting album Pink Ployd has ever made!
B00000IMTE|4.0|Blackmore's first post-Purple effort is a winner, featuring great guitarwork from the master and an excellent performance by Dio on vocals (what else is new?). While not as strong as the incredible follow-up &quot;Rising,&quot; this release still has some very good songs, such as the instantly recognizable &quot;Man on the Silver Mountain&quot; and lesser known tracks such as &quot;Black Sheep of the Family&quot; and &quot;Still I'm Sad.&quot;
B000001GBJ|5.0|This is the best record Secret Garden produced. \\"The Dawn of a New Century\\" is great, too, but it's a bit far from the style SG started with their debut's \\"Songs from a Secret Garden\\". A combination of piano and violin is incredible! You don't feel an ennui or monotony, repetition while listening to this enchanting duo.<br />The majority of the songs set your feelings to a minor key; you feel from sadness to melancholy, nostalgia and tenderness to a man you love. While listening to \\"Pastorale\\", \\"Song from a Secret Garden\\", \\"Sigma\\" and \\"Atlantia\\" you go to the deepest corners of your soul, simultaneously imagining mystic places like Scottish lakes in fog or even Norwegian forests. \\"Heartstrings\\", \\"Papillon\\", \\"Ode to Simplicity\\", \\"Serenade to Spring\\" is ideal for sitting somewhere in a summer-house, watching the river calmly flowing just near you and tender, fluffy clouds sailing above you! <br />A very good work, considering how difficult is nowadays to find a new niche in the world of music. The album will take you to the places you've never been before!
B00000IMTF|5.0|Not a single weak track here, this is undoubtedly one of the greatest hard rock albums ever conceived; it has &quot;Stargazer,&quot; &quot;Tarot Woman,&quot; and &quot;A Light in the Black,&quot; some of the best rock songs ever written. Everyone is great, from Dio to Blackmore to Powell. Buy it.
B000002UCN|3.0|George Harrison was a couple of hits shy of a greatest hits package when (1976) THE BEST OF GEORGE HARRISON was released. Maybe that's why his greatest Beatles hits were added. Did George approve that? I would like to know. Years later another incomplete Harrison collection came out that has since gone out of print. That one covered the guitar man's career from the mid-70s through the late 80s. My dream is a George Harrison collection comprising: &quot;My Sweet Lord,&quot; &quot;What is Life,&quot; &quot;Give Me Love,&quot; &quot;Ding Dong, Ding Dong,&quot; &quot;Dark Horse,&quot; &quot;You,&quot; &quot;This Song,&quot; &quot;Crackerbox Palace,&quot; &quot;Blow Away,&quot; &quot;Love Comes To Everyone,&quot; &quot;Faster,&quot; &quot;All Those Years Ago,&quot; &quot;Teardrops,&quot; &quot;Wake Up My Love,&quot; &quot;I Really Love You,&quot; &quot;Dream Away,&quot; &quot;Cheer Down,&quot; &quot;Got My Mind Set On You,&quot; and &quot;When We Was Fab.&quot; To stretch it to two discs, add these Traveling Wilburys songs: &quot;Handle With Care,&quot; &quot;End Of The Line,&quot; &quot;She's My Baby,&quot; and &quot;Wilbury Twist;&quot; plus two great tracks from George Harrison's Japan concert album, &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps.&quot; For now, seek out these George Harrison albums, which I consider his best: THIRTY-THREE AND ONE-THIRD; CLOUD NINE; ALL THINGS MUST PASS; GEORGE HARRISON; and EXTRA TEXTURE.
0805062971|5.0|chuck palahniuk is and amazing thinker and his boook opened up new meaning in my life. i have read the book four times and seen the movie an uncountable amount of times and it still has the same shock of power from when i first read and saw it. i would reccomend this book to anyone with or without meaning in their life. chuck's dark sayings and harsh realitys will wake you up
B00005BL2A|3.0|I would not say that this is a bad album, but I find it to be rather a disappointment.  The dark quick electronic beats which I was used to hearing has been replaced by a lighter more upbeat acoustical sound.  I don't mean to say &quot;Don't buy this Album&quot; but I will say to listen to it before buying if you can, because it is NOT the same Depeche Mode that you have known in the past.
0374250332|4.0|One only has to read a statement (on p. 346 of the hardcover edition) describing New York as &quot;a foreign city full of a strange race of curiously tiny malformed gray people&quot;* to realize The Right Stuff is not exactly a pinnacle of Objective Journalism (whatever the heck that is). And that's fine - part of the accomplishment of Wolfe, Hunter S. Thompson, and inheritors like Lester Bangs and Nick Tosches was to give the lie to the notion of journalistic objectivity. Just know that you're looking for a straight-foward presentation of facts, figures, and information about Project Mercury and its astronauts, you're probably gonna want to start somewhere else.<br />The upside of Wolfe's New Journalistic approach is that book is a tremendous amount of fun, recounting the stories of the Mercury astronauts with a wry, ironic wit that's all his own. There are, however, a few stylistic problems here - Wolfe's tone doesn't always suit the material at hand, particularly in the first chapter, which deals with the tragic deaths of many of the early test pilots of experimental jet planes. Also, he has a fondness for exclamatory interjections (e.g., on the very first page we get , &quot;But the day was young! And what a setting she had for her imminent enlightenment! And what a picture she herself presented!&quot; - all in a row, just like that) that can grow tiresome after a while.<br />For the most part, though, the writing works - Wolfe pulls off the admirable feat of making fun of pulp writing styles and reveling in them, often simultaneously. Also, there are some long paragraphs in here (particularly the one towards the end of the book where he describes Chuck Yeager's final test flight) that are minor miracles of literary construction.<br />All in all, definitely worth reading if you're interested in the subject at hand, or in exploring a unique literary voice.<br />*Not to worry, New Yorkers - Wolfe makes fun of Texans, Russians, and just about everybody else here, too.
B000053VAF|4.0|This movie is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, it may be a little sac religious but oh well it is still funny. This one is worth buying.
0780623134|3.0|This is an feel-good movie with good acting and a good story. Many people think that this is enough and think the film is &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;the greatest film EVER!!!&quot; You who think this are wrong. This film is funny but unoriginal and play's into a crowd's need to reaffirm those values which it holds dear like hope or love. If you really want to feel good, experience a new way of seeing life by doing something you've never done or fall in love for the first time or again. This film smothers originality and art under a web of two-dimensionalism and complacenct inactivity. The protagonist escapes, justice prevails but nothing is said about a world where injustice is the norm and big business crushes the lives of the underpriveledged, forcing them into the occupations that &quot;necessitate&quot; penal provisions like those demonstrated in the film. Someone wrote in a review that this film &quot;sums up what life is about.&quot; If that is the case, life is a very empty, hollow sum.<br />The politics of Hollywood aside, if anyone who gave this film such supreme praise bothered to delve into the past, study the films that have already been created, she would realize that there have been films made of such overpowering beauty and such incredible emotional intensity that make this film look like the rock next to the crystal. That this movie should rest in people's minds as a piece of perfection while films like &quot;The Passenger&quot; by Antonioni linger in limbo, out-of-print, is a true crime. If you need to be supersaturated with hope and wonder, see &quot;Wild Strawberries,&quot; by Bergman or &quot;Ikiru&quot; by Kurosawa, both incredible and &quot;inspirational&quot; films that elevate life, but deftly and with a sense of beauty that towers over Shawshank through its sincerity. Please do not comment on my review until you have seen both films.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie held my attention from begining to end! The 2 and a half hours flew by. Cinematography is AWESOME!!  The story is riveting.
B00003CXE6|4.0|I have to confess when i saw the presentation in the TV about this movie i just tought it was another summer disaster..opss..sorry.. i mean summer movie. Well as soon the video edition came out in my video club i only rent it because of the oscars it had won and i was courious. The first 5 minutes was enough to change my mind. Almoust perefct in every way : the director (THE great Mr Scott)did a great job (the action scenes are great and also the flash backs); good plot; Russel is the perfect heroe : a man tormented by the death of his Joaquin family trying to avange  them, in the oposite corner is Phoenix the &quot;vilan&quot; who is fourious by the chose of his father to give the power of the empire to a a general; one of the best soundtrack i had ever heard; and excelent psecial efects: I really recomend it.
0689825498|5.0|This is the first book my 9 month old has shown interest in.  He likes to open the flaps all by himself and loves to play with it even when I'm not reading it to him.  A great first flip the flap book for babies.  A really cute story, too, especially for babies who are animal lovers.
B00004XOWM|4.0|This CD is awesome. I personally think that Getcha Groove On is the best song, but Urban Assault Rollin' is pretty good too. You should get this CD if you like Papa Roach, Linkin Park, etc, and if your parents are cool with cussing.
1573226521|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I have not seen the movie.  I enjoyed the character development and the slow unraveling of an artificial utopian society...(what other kind of utopia exists?)The book was thought provoking and well paced.  <br />The one question that I still puzzle over is the connection between the Vietnam War and the Twenty Something's generation.  Perhaps I've missed a major nuance of Twenty Something culture, since I'm way older, but I just couldn't understand why the narrator of this tale was so enamored with Vietnam War Era lingo.  I can understand that there might be a handful of Vietnam Vets seeking solace in &quot;Paradise&quot;, but I just can not understand why this young kid is so focused on the era. If the book drew a connection, I missed it.
B00001U0GQ|1.0|I like this movie, but not the directors cut.  That fool should have left it alone.  In this version they've deleted scenes, removed dialog, altered the soundtrack, and added some very unneccesary and tedious extra footage that really just doesn't mesh well with the rest of the movie (IMHO).  I was disgusted when I saw the changes.  This is a great movie, it should not have been tampered with.  The original version is available on VHS.<br />LONG STORY SHORT: Great movie, but the directors cut bites.
B000031XCR|5.0|This is one CD you HAVE to get. It has her greatest hits and seven new songs! I think this is a great album for new Celine Dion fans to get caught up. It has some of her earliest songs such as the &quot;Power of Love&quot; and has some new ones that are great too. The only problem is that nothing from &quot;Unison&quot; is on this CD. &quot;Where Does My Heart Beat Now&quot; was a great song. They should have put that on here.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor have made a cult classic.  I think this movie is fabulous.  I'm a big fan of love stories, comedies, and musicals.  This movie wrapped it all into one.  I am really surprised that Nicole Kidman's voice is so beautiful.  Of course, Ewan McGregor sounds amazing and looks absolutely gorgeous!!!  <br />Above all things, I believe in love (and Ewan McGregor's smile).<br />Great flick!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|MAn, is this Cd good. Right from the very first song it'll get you engrosed in it. The combination of Maynards vocals with the guitar is just amazing.  There are some pretty small songs. But, the whole album is just a piece of art!!!!!
B00005J6UP|5.0|Movies like this don't happen often, and when they do you revel in them, and watch them often because you never tire of greatness.  Buy 2 - Buy 3 copies.  It took so long for this movie to get released on DVD that one copy goes into my safety-deposit box at the bank.  <br />This is a family movie.  The kids in the movie  have complex characters, and work together to solve an age long mystery about the Pirate One-Eyed Willy and his ship of gold and jewels.  It's a quest movie, it's a chase sceen movie, and it has real heart.  Don't pass up this great opportunity to by a real classic that I hold up with the very best films of all time.
B000050XEI|3.0|I absolutely love this album, I think it's one of Enya's better projects actually. It is indeed an album for the summer season. I just want everyone to know, that I do indeed love this album, but if I were Nicky Ryan or Enya herself, I would change a few things:<br />The track listing should follow more like this: LAZY DAYS, ISOBELLA*, WILD CHILD, FALLEN EMBERS, ONE BY ONE, DEORA AR MO CHROI, FLORA'S SECRET, ONLY TIME, PILGRIM, TEMPUS VERNUM, MIDNIGHT BLUE*, A DAY WITHOUT RAIN, SILVER INCHES, SONG OF THE SANDMAN*, THE PROMISE*, and THE FIRST OF AUTUMN*.<br />Doesn't that look like a superior album? Why Enya kept all those with asterisks (*) as B-Sides, I guess we'll never know. The album how it stands lasts just about a half hour. Sad, huh? Especially when you get lost in the material and then it just ends. A DAY WITHOUT RAIN suffers greatly without ISOBELLA, the best piece Enya has ever written. While this track is available on the Japanese release, it seems so un-fair that the American's miss out on not only this masterpiece, but the energetic and atmospheric THE FIRST OF AUTUMN availble on EVERY OTHER release but the US. <br />What was Enya thinking? We don't know. But she has me on a short leash, for I have already purchased the (price) Japanese release with ISOBELLA (Her culminating achievement) and a European version with THE FIRST OF AUTUMN. I also own all of the B-Side single projects such as: THE PROMISE, SONG OF THE SANDMAN, and MIDNIGHT BLUE. <br />Let's hope Enya doesn't take so long with her next project, and let's hope she dishes out the beauty more equally.
B0000025HG|4.0|This album is notable for many things, the least interesting being her disco duet with Donna Summer. Unlike the purists, I don't mind the foray, or her takes on Splish Splash and I Aint Gonna Cry Tonight, since they are yet again proof of Barbra's eclectic choices. However for me, the pluses of this album are the beautiful Lee Holdridge orchestrated arrangments of the ballads, and the almost tragic idea that this was the voice that we could have had doing the film of Evita. When Robert Stigwood had director Ken Russell on board, he wanted Barbra, but she turned it down, primarily because she disliked Don't Cry for Me Argentina, but also because she was in pre-production on Yentl. One would hardly want to deny Barbra fulfilling her long cherished Yentl dream. And one could also dismiss the idea that at her age of 37 she was too old to play Eva Peron. But at 27 she was considered too young to play Dolly Levi in Hello, Dolly but she was cast because of her voice, and this !is the voice that Evita deserved. (Barbra's vocals for her next album, Guilty, were lesser, for her at least). Not to mention that the role of Evita suited Barbra's androgynous persona, and that the she resembles the real Eva Peron. The only redemptive element of being eventually saddled with Alan Parker directing Madonna, is Tim Rice returning to Andrew Lloyd Webber to write You Must Love Me, similar to how Jerry Herman wrote Love is Only Love for Barbra's Dolly. Oh well. Of this album, it can be noted that Barbra cowrote the title track, in one of her rare songwriting efforts, but my favourite here is On Rainy Afternoons, a never repeated exploration of Lalo Schifrin material. It is said at the time that Streisand was outbid by Richard Clayderman for the rights to an album of Schifrin love songs. This, and her pass on Evita, is perhaps too much to bear.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is NOT the type of movie I usually watch...I just gave it a try on my nephew's recommendation. WOW, was I surprised. Led by a witty script and several first class performances(Clooney did receive a Golden-Globe, I believe) this movie takes you on a trip you wish would never end. Add in the cutting-edge cinematography, the era-capturing soundtrack, and Coen Brother's keen directing, and it's worthy of watching time and time again...A rare quality in today's films. I own a lot of DVD's...this is my new favorite! Now, I'M A DAPPER-DAN MAN!
B00000K2W1|5.0|When I first listened to this cd, it was the first time i'd ever heard janis . . . and I hated it. But I kept on getting the songs stuck in my head so i kept listening to the cd. It really grew on me, I've listened to this cd millions of times since then and Janis Joplin is one of my all time favorite musicians. She sings with so much passion and love, shes was truly amazing. Before this cd I listened to Backstreet Boys, Nsync and all that other crap. It was this cd alone that made me appreciate REAL music! It made me go and buy more Janis cds, which lead to buying other 60s music; Beatles, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, and Jefferson Airplane, just to name a few. I now love the whole 60s hippy music movement! This cd is a wonderful start to all that type of music. Everyone has to own it. Its really a really worth the money. It truly changed me into a more musically open person.
0763611883|4.0|What a cute story!  Charlie is in charge of little sister Lola and decides to play a trick on her.  With Charlie giving silly names to foods that Lola claims she doesn't like, Lola plays along and tastes foods she has insisted she will never, ever eat.  My 6-1/2 year old loves this book; it's a bit too old for my almost 3-year old.  <br />What I like best about this book are the real photographs of the foods (peas, carrots, fish sticks, etc.) that are incorporated into the fun cartoon illustrations.  <br />This is a engaging, slightly offbeat story which makes it stand out from the zillions of other children's books out there.
B00004BZ16|5.0|Probably just a step below London Calling and has several tunes that were experimental, this is nonetheless a classic. They even expanded thier musical horizons and are all over the map with this one. The pop sound on &quot;Hitsville U.K.&quot;, Rap On &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; and Lighting Strikes&quot;, Thumping dance beats on &quot;The Call Up&quot; and &quot;Ivan meets G.I. Joe&quot;, Jazz on &quot;Look Here&quot;, Reggae on &quot;Junco Partner&quot; and &quot;Crooked Beat&quot;, Rock on &quot;Police on My Back&quot; and &quot;Up in Heaven&quot;. There is something here for everyone. What a brilliant work this is all done Clash style.

B00005ASOC|5.0|SEAN CONNERY (The Rock) plays William Forrester, a novelist who has been living in hiding for several years in an apartment, built in front of a basketball court.  After young writer Jamal Wallace sneaks into the house to see what it's like in there, he leaves his backpack behind, with his journal in it.  After retrieving his bag, Jamal discovers his journal has been edited and goes to Mr. Forrester for help with his writing, and an unbelievable friendship begins.<br />MY REVIEW:<br />&quot;THE MOVIE IS PERFECT IN EVERY ASPECT!  Sean Connery, Rob Brown, Anna Paquin and Matt Damon's performances are all outstanding!  The directing from Gus Van Sant (Good Will Hunting) and cinematography is excellent!  All fans of great, inspirational films will cheer for Finding Forrester!  THE FILM IS SIMPLY A TRIUMPH!&quot;- MJV &amp; the Movies.
B000002I2I|4.0|Following the recording of Soft Parade, Morrison was accused of public indecency and was subjected to a trial which dragged on for most of a year. Promoters across the country cancelled their bookings with the Doors and the band couldn't find any work. So they were allowed to focus 100% on their next cd, and it shows with the songs and energy contained on this, their 5th work. &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot; is the standard song from this cd that you hear on the radio and blues it is, but Doors blues with Kreiger doing Chuck Berry bends and flamenco pull-offs on his guitar during the solo. &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; is a good one, with its ponderous synth riff doubled with guitar and bass about the american dream. &quot;Peace Frog&quot; showcases Kreiger's slightly wah-wahed playing with Morrison's darkest lyrics yet singing about blood covering everything and also alluding to his encounter with the Native American who passed his soul onto him. &quot;Frog&quot; slips into &quot;Blue Sunday&quot; with a guitar-keyboard-drum crash which melts into a mellow honey vocal by Morrison about &quot;his own true love&quot;. &quot;The Spy&quot; is sultry delta blues with a sparse accompaniment to Jim's gently sung but menacing vision in which he knows &quot;your deepest secret fear&quot;.  &quot;Queen of the Highway&quot; is a flowing evocation of Jim and Pam's love and the isolation and freedom they feel as he satirizes the great american love story: &quot;American girl, American boy, most beautiful people, in the world.&quot; One of my favorite Doors songs, and probably one of their most overlooked, is &quot;Indian Summer&quot;. It starts off with a simple, rhythmic bass line and gradually comes in with clean guitar and hand beaten drum. The lyrics are simple and hypnotic, &quot;I love you the best, better than all the rest, that I meet in the summer, Indian Summer&quot;. This is what makes it good. Its very simplicity. On this cd, it seems like the Doors recognized the folly of what they were doing on Soft Parade with its flowery and overdone slop. They went back to writing within their strengths and turned out what I believe is their last good cd. Jim's voice was also at its height with this cd. Just one year later, his voice sounded as though he had been swallowing glass on the uneven and overrated L.A. Woman.
B000002KMY|5.0|The 10 best metal LPs of the 80s are: 1)&quot;Mob Rules&quot; by Sabbath, 2)&quot;Killers&quot; by Maiden, 3)&quot;Mindcrime&quot; by Queensreich, 4)&quot;Peace Sells&quot; by Megadeth, 5)&quot;Day of Reconing&quot; by Pentagram (analog mix), 6)&quot;Feel the Fire&quot; by Barnabas, 7)&quot;Fire In the Brain&quot; by Oz,  8)&quot;Extacy &amp; Danger&quot; by Ostrogoth, 9)&quot;Cloak &amp; Dagger&quot; by Witchfynde, and 10)&quot;Under Jolly Roger&quot; by Running Wild.
B000002I2G|1.0|I could sum up this cd in two words: Awful Parade. From listening to this cd, you can tell that the songwriting that was being done in the Doors had reached a point where it had become second rate. Krieger especially was writing awful songs, and this was further compounded by adding big bands and orchestras to some of the tracks. Morrison stays away from them in his songs and remains truer to the Doors music. &quot;Tell All the People&quot; is just downright goofy and you can just see Morrison rolling his eyes as he sings. &quot;Runnin Blue&quot; is the worst song they ever recorded, especially the chorus where Kreiger takes a hand at singing and sounds like a nasal Bob Dylan. &quot;Easy Ride&quot; is a nice experiment in Elvis-like rockabilly. &quot;Wild Child&quot; is another nice one similar to &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; by Led Zeppelin. The outstanding track on here is &quot;Wishful Sinful&quot; which is the only one where the orchestral sound merges with the dark rumblings of the band. To understand the lack of inspiration during this period one only needs to listen to the title track. Like its predecessors, &quot;The End&quot;, &quot;When the Music's Over&quot;, and the aborted &quot;Celebration of the Lizard&quot;, this one was to be the epic of the cd. It's just plain horrible except for the first section. Especially its incense and peppermint lyrics. Only something catastrophic could snap the Doors out of the pit of bad music they had fallen into. It was to come in the next year as Morrison was put on trial for public indecency. It was to produce their last great cd, Morrison Hotel.
0385484518|5.0|A fasinating true life story! A teacher and a student meet after classes and after he becomes a graduate. Fine storytelling at its very best! First rate! A true great book! I simply could not put it down!
6304981635|5.0|What makes this movie so great? Bruce Lee is not just an actor or a sportsman; he is a great master. You can see it. You can feel it. The plot is magnificent. The actions are incredible. The story is amazing. DVD quality is great. The fight in the room of mirrors is one of the best episodes ever. I have enjoyed every moment of it. If you have never watched it, I can't even explain how much you have missed. This is a &quot;must to see&quot; movie for everyone who enjoys martial arts and actions.

B000053VAF|3.0|First, let me say this: JAY is not funny!! Silent Bob: funny. Jay: not so funny. Jay is a loud, raucious kid who is not funny. That said, the movie is pretty good. Never seen a Kevin Smith film before (don't think I ever will either). I'm not Catholic like the movie (not ever movie can be perfect), but I enjoyed MOST of it nonetheless.<br />Did anyone else notice Jay and Silent Bob in SCREAM 3? Just thought I'd throw that in while I wait for the &quot;How can you not like Kevin Smith movies&quot; hate mail.
0062502182|1.0|If I were able to I'd award this minus 10. I bought this book to read on holiday, on the beach on southern Europe. I've not read such a book of this bad quality as this in years. For god's sake don't waste your money. Buy Hermen Hesse instead, or William Golding.<br />It's trite, silly, gormless, infantile, cliched. Buy it for someone you REALLY want to annoy or condescend to.
6304806442|5.0|how is it that people think that this movie is a glorification of drugs?  and why would they care?  trainspotting is not one of such simple worth, but rather one of perspective.  these bashers miserably fail to notice many instances of such sort: living in abandoned and dilapitated houses, the death of a baby, the contraction of aids, the characters' feeling of worthlessness portrayed through their ambience, words, narrations, and body language.  does fishing through &quot;the worst toilet in scotland&quot; for a &quot;last hit&quot; really make drugs that much more appealing?  people who bring up this inexistent controversy only shy away from that fact that this is a great movie.  the shot sequences are amazing, and the perspective of drugs is eye opening.  just ignore the self-righteous zealots out there and watch the movie.  you won't regret it.

B00000K0DT|1.0|This movie had a lot of hype (and still does) but doesn't live up to any of it.  I didn't know much about it when I first saw it (I certainly had never heard about the twist ending) but I figured it out halfway through -- Kevin Spacey's character gives it away with his inconsistent remarks about Keyser Soze (in one scene he has to have the other criminals tell him who Keyser Soze is, in another scene, which takes place only a few days later, he goes on and on about how children have nightmares about him as a child and about how awful this guy's history is, and how his legend is so spectacular and terrifying.  Please.  It's ridiculous to even remotely consider that somebody would develop that type of fear of someone they've never met and only heard about for two days.  You really have to be stupid to fall for this kind of movie manipulation and not put 2+2 together.)  The director should have been more careful, or maybe he was trying to give it away.  Still, its one thing to give hints, as in the Sixth Sense, and another to rely on all of us stupid American's not thinking the dialogue through.<br />The entire movie seemed pretty bland once you figured out what's going on.  Spacey is good in the movie, but Chazz Longname and the others are pretty awful to watch.  Maybe if you're really dumb and don't clue into the real story the movie's terrific.  If that's you, I pity you and hope you are able to enjoy a good Bryan Singer movie like LA Confidential.  If you like to think during a movie, you'll see right through this insipid waste of time and look down on those poor souls who think this movie touches upon greatness.
B00000BKE1|4.0|I totally disagree with some fans who say this album is bad. It may not be as good as 666 or seventh son.. but, any composition from Maiden is top-notch. The fugitive and weekend-warrior are ordinary by any standards, but , the others are very good songs, very satisfying. There are a total of 12 songs and 10/12 id not a bad ratio, is it ?! UpTheIrons !!!!!
B000025RAU|1.0|When I was reading one of the reviews for 'The Usual Suspects', there was a mention of 'Chinatown' and how it was such a great movie.  That made me rent this movie and honestly, there have been very few other movies that have been so disappointing!<br />It is laughable that this is being compared to 'The Usual Suspects' (which is at least million times better!).  This is a pathetic movie, the ending tries to surprise you and it does, because it is so stupid!<br />Jack Nicholson does a good job, but even his acting cannot hide the fact that this movie stinks.  Some comments say that this one is the best Film Noir till date, and I have one word for such reviews: Baloney!<br />Bottom line:  Don't see it, see 'The Usual Suspects' again (and again and again and again....).
0380973650|5.0|It's three AM and I step outside for a smoke (I'm still quitting, of course) before plowing into AMERICAN GODS's lengthy epilogue. Thus far the ride has been memorable. Gaiman has definately delivered, hitting heretofore unheard notes with his usual dark poetic skill. How will he conclude the symphony? It's a very good novel, but will it be great? Will this be a perfect Neil Gaiman yarn? Some time later, I close the book. It is great novel, rich in imagination and insight. It is a perfect Gaiman story, perhaps his best so far.  Buy it, rent it, borrow it but by all means, get reading. Strange and Charming Gods await you...
B00005BCPC|2.0|This movie SEEMS to be Mansfield Park.  The characters have all the right names, the action has a superficial resemblance to that of the novel, but there all similarities end!<br />This is a very modern Mansfield Park, regardless of the early 19th century setting.  Viewers are caught up in a tale of the evils of slavery and the value of women's scholarship.  Not exactly the focus of the novel!<br />There are some redeeming features.  The costuming is beautiful; Mr. Rushworth, Julia, and Maria are gratifyingly self-absorbed and absurd; the differences between the Price and Bertram households are well-drawn.  Austen fans will enjoy quotes from Fanny's writing:  they are taken from the early stories of Austen herself.<br />However, the makers of this movie have made Fanny Price a very different sort of creature from the novel.  Blooming and beautiful, sometimes sharp-tongued, she has little in common with the character in the novel.<br />The director has chosen to introduce elements not present in the novel.  Sir Thomas, for example, due to a family business in trading slaves (never mentioned in the original), has gone from a dignified, rather stuffy but honorable man in the novel, to a degraded and rather disturbing man in the film.  In the movie, he looks Fanny up and down as if she is a slave for sale, and arranges the famous ball of the novel as a way of &quot;selling&quot; her in marriage.  And having brought in the anti-slavery subplot, the director simply dismisses it at the end, saying &quot;Sir Thomas eventually gave up his interests in Antigua.&quot;<br />Sharply lacking is any of the satiric eye Austen cast on society.  We are given the melodrama, but little of Austen's sharp wit.  Very few of Aunt Norris' snobby ways have made it into the movie; the great scenes involving the &quot;improvements&quot; at Sotherton are missing.  Fanny's brother William is missing entirely.<br />Why bother to even mention this is based on an Austen novel?  There is little enough resemblance.tle enough resemblance.
B000002JNJ|4.0|With riffs faster than the work of a pit crew, Cowboys from Hell is sure to become a classic.  <br />From the opening flanger riff of 16th note low Es, then to main riff, then to an explosive band in, you hear the band´s unmatchable force.  <br />Phil Anselmo has a distinctive voice that growls with anger and shrieks like pain.  It´s so different from other vocalists, and he has been copied by following metal bands to this day.<br />Dimebag Darrell more tricks up his sleeve than Lance Burton, and his heavy, crunchy rhythms, as well as fast and developed blues oriented solos shine through, making him a sure fire contempory guitarist of his time.<br />Rex Brown has tremendous skill on the bass.  Having to double Dimebag´s lightning speed, he does it with what seems ease.  Listen closely for him backing Dimebag´s lead roll in the ´Cowboy from Hell´ outro.<br />And who could forget Vinnie Paul.  Obviously influenced by Metallica´s Lars Ulrich, he doesn´t disgrace the syle or not use it to his extent.  With double bass beats, complex beats are rampant, and he sets the band´s heavy feel.<br />Most if not all of the tracks are really good.  Pantera is extremely good at what they do, and it shows in prime slabs of Texas flavored metal such as the title track, ´Primal Concrete Sledge´, the semi ballad ´Cemetary Gates´, my favorite ´Domination´, ´Clash with Reality´, ´Heresy´, and ´The Sleep´.   Filled with chunky riffs, fast beats, and screaming vocals, Pantera makes a stand with their triumphant debut.  Unfortunately, it´s Pantera´s least lucrative album, and sales I hear haven{t even reached 1 million.  Go out and buy it!!  It is worth it!!
0425170349|5.0|WOW!!!!!! is the best description of this book. There is so much action on every single page. There is no book with more action than Rainbow Six. It is my favorite book of all time!
B000003C51|5.0|Upon it´s release in 1987, ´Surfing with the Alien´ became a breaktrhrough hit for the then relatively unknown guitarist.  I´m here to back up that statement.<br />THIS ALBUM IS INCREDIBLE!!!!  I´ve never seen an album with such interesting diversity.  EVERY song is incredible, and filled with Satriani trademarks: melodic, fast, unpredictable, moving, and entertaining.  The title track kicks off the masterpiece with soaring energy and a reoccuring melody.  What I love best about Satriani is his ability to make instrumentals sound like they have vocals.  The melodies are unparalleled!!  Then it starts the solo: high tapping piece that almost sounds like a machine.  Fuzzy distortion adds to the spacey atmosphere.  It´s inconcievably amazing.<br />Next is ´Ice 9´.  Another cruncher in sound, and a straight forward vocal like melody.  I love the trading off style of the solo, the revving sounds he makes with the whammy bar.  ´Crushing Day´ follows, with a heavy rhythm major change, and eerie type melody.  The solo intro is classic Satriani.  ´Always with me, Always with you´ stands as one of the top tracks, my favorite, probably because it´s the only song of his on this album that I can play.  I has great chorus and melody, and though it is the slowest and simplest song on the album, it doesn´t fail to impress you and still have the key Satriani elements.  <br />´Satch Boogie´ opens with a hi hat, and explodes with a fast and furious chorus.  The tapping interlude stands out.  ´The Hill of the Skull´ is probably the least enjoyable track, but the style of guitar fits the title, and I give it that credit.  ´Circles´ is another favorite.  Starting with calm, clean strumming, it suddenly launches into a full scale crucnhy solo, the album´s best in my opinion.  It has other neat sounds that don´t appear in any of the other songs, like a glass shattering kind of thing.<br />´Lords of Karma´ sounds like an oriental theme.  Backed by heavy rhythm and anequally impressive melody, the layering shows Satriani´s knack for over dubbing.  ´Midnight´ has a strange effect of down played guitar, and some very impressive tapping pieces.  Last is ´Echo´, a song that starts to grow on you.  A slower, simpler song in contrast to some of the albums other rockers, it still doesn´t cease to impress. <br />Every song on here shines through with uncomparable talent.  Satriani is a guitar hero that proves his point in his best work to date: ´Surfing with the Alien´.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Star Wars is back. There is a new hope for Star Wars. Lucas Film has finally decided to release this is DVD. Though a somewhat disapointing story Lucas go's back to what works, an epic story about how Anakin became Darth. One main problem with this is that rotten... idiot Sir Jar Jar Binks. I hope he dies. Well its less than a year now to Episode 2. If you are a Star Wars fan this is a must own.
630512065X|5.0|This video is great. It's a wonderful (if abriged) version of the staged show. The cast is great, the music is great, and most of the camera work is really good. I am a bit disappointed that Growltiger's Last Stand as well as a few other parts here and there were cut to make the video 2 hours, but since they put The Awful Battle of the Peke's and The Pollicles in it, I'm not going to complain. If you love Cats then get this video. If you've never seen Cats but would like too, then get this video (then try to see it live of course) All and all I'm very happy with this video &gt;gives it two thumbs up&lt;
B00003CXAA|5.0|Finally Godfather on DVD. WOW! I am stoked. Best movies of all time! Al Pacino delivers again!

0783222734|5.0|In my opinion, this is the coolest movie of all time. This was the first film ever to bring dinosaurs to life and thrill dino nuts all over the world. The character's are great, the soundtrack is huantingly beautiful, and the dinosaurs are amazing. This film has some stunning scenes that can only be appreciated in the full format (so get the wide screen edition) This is just an awsome movie. My only gripe is that I wish it was more like the book, but the movie was so well done that I don't really mind
B00004YKSD|5.0|This told the story about The Doors through their years up until Jim Morrison died sadly. It gave me a whole new look in the band. Val Kilmer delivers in the great role as one of the best rock and rollers of our time. The Doors have some of the best songs out there and it protrays on how some songswere written. Great DVD..Buy it! I did, It was worth the money! A++
B00004U8P4|3.0|This movie was a major disappointment for me and a lot of people. It can't be compared to the awsome &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; but it is a lot of fun to watch. If you want a movie with plot and suspense, get the first movie, if you just want to see a bunch of really cool dinosaurs cause trouble and eat people, then this is the movie for you. It's got a basic (rather lame) plot, uninspired characters, and a less than thrilling soundtrack (considering it was scored by the great John Williams, this is suprising) If wanting a copy of this video, I recommend getting the Collector's Edition. The new scenes add to the plot and develop Roland Tembo's (the hunter) character. Like I said, this movie won't go down in history or anything, but it is fun to watch
B000000HZT|5.0|I think that this album is very good.  I really like the soloist who sang on the album.  I think that the soloist is perfect considering the &quot;mood&quot; Banks is generating on the album.  The music has a great longing sense about it--it is the &quot;mood&quot; that is the star on this album--it is not meant to be flashy or showy, although when a person sways from the mood centered idea a person can hear what great work went into making that mood.  I really think that the album is perfect in that it succeeded in creating this great dissonent mood.  If the album would have had Phil Collins on it the mood would have been quite different and the whole project no doubt would have been different.  Beacon was a great choice for that mood with his eerie vocals that wrapped the whole dissonent idea together.  This album is a great favorite of mine--I gave it many plays--it is definitely not a one-timer---I have listened to it many many many times and really love it.  I think that Tony Banks is an exceptional keyboardist--and it really takes a very intelligent person to create --and that is the word create such combinations with many various keyboards, and he gets a big &quot;A&quot; for this one.  I really think that many people have missed the point of this album.  Ana
B000002OOY|5.0|There has never been and never will be a score that can compared to the masterpiece the great John Williams has created here. It it both powerful and hauntingly beautiful. Buy this CD. If you're disappointed with it, I'll eat my own leg
0790729369|4.0|This movie is so emotional and it proove if it was necessary that Clint Eastwood is a giant in the film industry the last one i mean! This DVD is perfect for discovering all the sensibility of this man who are not only &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;.
B000056NX4|3.0|When I first heard that there was a version of JCS set in modern times, I wasn't sure I liked the idea, but after seeing this video I am happy to say the idea was a good one. Unfortunately the casting wasn't the best. Carter's Jesus is boring, all he does is look annoyed or upset. I found the totally unemotional Ted Neeley from the movie version to be a better Jesus. Jerome Pradon, I have mixed feelings about him. His acting is the best in the film, but his voice is just not suited for the role of Judas. Rene Castle's Mary was pleasant. I had no problems with her. Pilate (actor's name escapes me) is one of the best, he's tough as nails and has a fantastic voice. Fred B. Owen as Ciaphas was rather disapointing. He has a wonderfully deep bass voice, but he doesn't seem able to maintain it. He doesn't look threatening either, rather like a big teddy bear. Michael Shaffer's Annas was brilliant. Michael has captured the character better than anyone else. Last and most certainly least, Rik Myal as Herod. He can't sing, is not funny, and is truely annoying. The music for this film is very good. It's very up to date. I recommend this video to people new to JCS (and any selfrespecting die hard JCS fan)
B000056K04|1.0|While I'm sure that there are more than enough one star &quot;I hate Glen Ballard&quot; reviews for this album, perhaps it's time to take a bit more of a fresh perspective.      There were a lot of things that led up to the release of &quot;Everyday&quot;.  The enormous amount of time the band spent making the now infamous (and superior) &quot;Lillywhite Sessions&quot;, the tragic deaths in Dave's family, RCA chomping at the bit for new product after waiting  months for an album that never came.  And let's not forget, all you fans, that Ballard was asked to come on board.  Dave is just as much at fault here as the other.      In the end, as a friend said to me, this was an album that needed to be made.  quick, poppy, and done with.  They just wanted the drama over with, and it is reflected on the album, which is devoid of all things that make the band what they are.  But now that it is out of their system, they won't be going back any time soon.  In my opinion.      Do yourself a favor, find a huge Dave fan, and convince them to give you a copy of the &quot;Lillywhite Sessions&quot;.  Far superior record, with a dark edge to it.  Every band has phases.  Soem are better than others.  But there's apparently always a desire to move on to the next thing, especially with matthews.
B00004XMTH|5.0|Not only do you get the very good Cats video in this set, you get a 30 minute bonus video stuffed with lots of cool stuff. From original London Cats footage to backstage footage (watch for the dressing room scene where Jo Gibb (Rumplteazer) flashes her bra at the camera. It is too funny) I recomend getting this set. The bonus video really makes it worth every penny
B00004YW6I|5.0|PJ Harvey seems to be sporting a new look with this album. Not in a physical sense, like a new hairstyle, but as in producing her most accessible album to date. Long a darling of alternative music, Harvey's latest release finds her generally more up-tempo, something new listeners will find attractive. Stories still retains all the power of Harvey's earlier albums like Dry, Rid Of Me, and Bring You My Love with gritty tales of New York City-where the album was recorded-displayed in true Harvey fashion with slashing guitars and plaintive wailing vocals. The main difference is song arrangements that are less stark, with a few less minor keys. It is similar in essence to Frank Black's Dog In The Sand. Black to was also an alternative darling during his days in the Pixies, but has unveiled a new look with his band the Catholics. Black retains his creative flair and easily mixes striped down styles of rock, punk and Americana with ease-something Harvey pulls off as well, perhaps with a little less on the acoustic side. She does have her moments however, such as the unique &quot;duet,&quot; if you can really call it that, with Thom Yorke of Radiohead that moves ahead passionately, yet reflects the differences of the two people involved as they sing separately side by side.
0743201140|1.0|This book is very expensive and the authors tell you that taking multiple surveys are helpful in the book.  They actually do not let you take the surveys multiple times and do not return your phonecalls when you leave a message on the 800 number that they list in the book.  Do not waste your money until they allow more tests - especially for the price that they charge!  You can buy 2 or 3 other good books for the price of this one.
B00005CCA9|5.0|This beautiful, romantic,finger-killer, arm-breaking of a concerto has had many recordings and several pianists adopted it as a very special calling card during periods of their career: Bolet, Ashkenazy, Horowitz, and most certainly Rachmaninoff himself (well served in his CD reissue). None generate the daredevil excitement, natural abandon, and instinctive musicality of Argerich in this recording (unedited, single-take, live performance). It is wonderful music and rapturous piano playing. The only drawback is that after listening to this, other well-loved performances may pale. This CD belongs in every classical collection...... even violinists'.<br />Having said all that, the original cd issue had a much more rewarding coupling: a masterful performance of Tchaikowsky's First, also from a live performance, conducted by the late Kiril Kondrashin..... an electric partnership, arguably more exciting than Argerich's &quot;studio&quot; recording, good as that one also is. Aren't we lucky to witness her career?

0792151712|3.0|I know it may be hard to believe, but I just watched Titanic for the first time.  After all of the hype, I'd expected to really enjoy this film, since I tend to enjoy &quot;sappy&quot; movies.  As an amateur history buff, I enjoyed seeing the recreation of the Titanic's sinking, as well as the boat itself. However, the story line was disappointing.  I get frustrated when directors try to encorporate modern characters into historical settings.  Rose's behavior in the movie was completely unrealistic when historical context is taken into consideration.  The chances of a turn-of-the-century socialite being willing to pose naked, much less do it with a guy in the back seat of a car after having known him for only a few days are not good.  Nor would she likely be delighted to go downstairs to the steerage section and dance the night away among the rats, no matter how good the company. Also, I was annoyed by the attempt to show that women were treated like slaves in this time period.  Seems to me like they were the ones who got off the boat first... However, when I just accepted the fact that this would be another Hollywood version of history, I enjoyed the rest of the film.
B00003CXRP|4.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The DVD brings out the excellence in this movie. There are so many features that I haven't even seen half of them. The title screens are pretty cool. There are a few problems which they could of fixed. First is that they could of fit full screen on the second disc, secondly they could of included a little bit more interactive features. The movie is also interesting. This movie has very little talking and the beginning is a little bit boring. This is probably due to the fact that the beginning is very slow. Also because half of the movie is little or no talking, it seems as if you were watching it forever. If you only like action, don't get this movie, even though it has very excellent reviews. Otherwise, this is a really great movie, it should have gotten most of the oscars it was nominated for. This is Robert Zemeckis's probably greatest movie he ever created.
0060977493|4.0|This was one of the very few English books I read. And it was an amazing experience. Such fluid poetic language and such rythm. The relationship between the twins is just beutifully portrayed. I cannot but stop thinking that this is some way related to things that happned really. But so what? How many of us can write about real things so wonderfully? What more, can I add, just read this book when you can, and be slightly patient, you will never regret.
B000021XS0|5.0|There is not much i can say about this albem that has not already been said. The songs take you from one page of the story to the next and the whole thing comes together beautifully! I hope they produce another cd after this one because i just can not get enough of this band!
B00000IQC8|5.0|CLERKS is the first movie to start us out in the 'New Jersey Chronicles.' The film revolves around a regular day in the life of a conveinence store clerk and his best friend. This is also the first time that we meet Jay and Silent Bob, two crazy potheads who have nothing better to do than hang around the convenience store and try to make some money by selling drugs.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Okay, it's kinda hard to rate this film.  If it were written and made 20 years ago, the screenplay would have been better(considering nowadays people don't make movies as well).  But now that it was made in our present day, the graphics are better.  Either way the plot was way too weak, it was boring, the cast was bad, the screenplay was bad, and it wasn't interesting.  For some REAL science-fiction movies, check out the Abyss, the ORIGINAL Star Wars movies, Aliens, or the Matrix.  If you ABSOLUTELYMUST see this movie, I suggest renting it first.
0780021967|5.0|This is one of my favorite early Hitchcock movies (the other early favorite being The Lady Vanishes).  Robert Donat seems to be a natural predecessor to Cary Grant in Hitchcock's movies.  He's handsome and charming as he stumbles into one difficulty after another and scrapes out of each one.  Hannay must elude the police on a train which happens to be stopped on a bridge, he escapes from the cluthes of a farmer who nearly turns him in to collect a reward, he runs off with his accuser (and love interest) handcuffed to his wrist, and he burst into a crowded meeting hall where he spontaneously delivers a speech of introduction for a political candidate whom he's never met.  I've seen this movie on VHS and on this Criterion Collection DVD.  There is no comparison.  As with most of the Criterion DVD's I've seen, it is worth the price to see such a clean restoration, not to mention the extras that Criterion packs into each disc.
B00004TRD8|5.0|This has been one of my all time favorite movies since it's 1991 release. When I recieved my copy of the Ultimate Edition, something was wrong. I have a rather slow DVD player so I had to watch something else first to warm it up. But it was worth the wait. I had no idea that they could fit so much extra stuff onto one DVD. <br />Three versions of the film, three documentaries, four trailers, audio commentary, spectacular picture and sound, kick [butt] animated menus, talent profiles, script and a full supplement that will take you until Judgment Day to finish reading. Awesome!<br />Onto Brandon's DVD scale:<br />Movie: 5/5. Arnold's greatest movie ever. Cameron's best too.<br />Picture and Sound: 5/5. As good as it's ever gonna get.<br />Extras: 5/5. They don't call it the Ultimate Edition for nothing.<br />Final verdict: 10. Probably the best DVD ever made. Well, I guess I'll have to wait for the Star Wars movies to be released on DVD before I jump to that conclusion.<br />If you love the movie, you'll love the DVD. Highly recommended. I'm serious, buy it now!
B00003CX8J|4.0|I was thoroughly looking forward to this movie when I heard it was coming out and thought that the Director and Actors definitely did the characters justice.<br />It has always been very hard to bring comic book characters to the big screen believably and not let them stay too 2 dimensional.  Except for some of the poor wirework with the flying characters the special effects were excellent and the sets were extremely well done.<br />This was definitely a star making vehicle for Hugh Jackman, but Halle Berry will always look good on the movie posters.  I sure hope they can flesh out her role in the next chapters of these characters.  The little snippet they had cut out of the movie (but shown in the DVD extras) as she teaches the class was not enough for you to get to know her character.  I am sure they will do better with the Cyclops and Jean Grey characters as well.  Mystique (Rebecca Romjin-Stamos) was definitely a great she is so bad, but looks so good character.  Hope to see her again too.<br />Everybody go get this movie.  You can watch it over and over again, its PS2 compatible and just plain fun.  (Buy it and let's make sure they make another one).
B000053VAF|5.0|DOGMA is the fourth entry in the 'New Jersey Chronicles'. The film is about a Catholic woman who is chosen to stop two renegade angels from getting back into Heaven --- and destroying all human existence in the process. Jay and Silent Bob appear as two unlikely prophets who end up joining the woman on her road trip to New Jersey where she must stop the renegade angels. The 2 Disc DVD Special Edition of this film is the only true way to see it!
B000003TA4|5.0|I have never written a review, but had to when I saw this album had a rating of 4.5 stars.  You have got to be kidding me!  I don't care if you conduct a symphony orchestra, veg out to trance, are strictly blues, or hang cool with the jazz men, this album is a MUST.  Like the Beatles' &quot;Revolver&quot;, the national anthem by Jimi Hendrix, Beethoven's 5th, &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; by Satchmo, &quot;Bobby Magee&quot; by Janice Joplin, &quot;Respect&quot; by Aretha, &quot;Ave Maria&quot; by Pavarotti, or &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; by Johnny Cash, no true music collection is complete without &quot;Nevermind&quot;.  By nearly all rock experts and historians, this album is considered one of the top ten OF ALL TIME!!  Actually, most have it in the top 5.  If you cannot sit down and listen to this album and understand its importance and its genius, then you don't know enough about Cobain, Seattle, grunge, the late 80s/early 90s, and music.  Go do some research.  Then sit down and listen again.  The brilliance is bittersweet, since we must now listen knowing that such a light is extinguished, and by his own hand.
0679428887|3.0|Pretty disappointing book to read after the phenomenal Fatherland. I was really expecting something to top the latter book on Nazi Germany, but instead, Archangel disappointed!!! It started off ok, in Robert Harris' usual style, and it actually carried me forth to the middle part where we get all excited about the discovery of this book which was supposed to be a diary of some sort related to Stalin. However, the last third of the book was such a farce!!! The whole drawn-out jungle like scene in the depths of Archangel was totally overworked and left me impatient and the ending, though not what I was expecting, and ingenious up to a certain point, did not manage to lift me from the exhaustion incurred from having read the previous section!!! This book had great promise but failed in the end. 4 for the beginning, 5 for the second part, 3/4 for the third and 2 for the end. I wish it had built up rather than the other way round. Still, Harris is a magnificent writer and I look forward to his other offerings.
B00005K3LW|5.0|The best movie of the series. Period. It has more action, more scenery, better characters, better acting. This is the ultimate edition. Samuel L. Jackson. Beautiful Performance as a somewhat racist store owner who becomes an unlikely partner after saving John McClane in the first ten minutes of the movie. From there it is non stop action. No meaningless stretches where they jsut talk and ramble about nothing.  Simon is the villain who has caught some feelings over his brother's death. ( Nakatomi) and does an excellent job as the villain. The only gripe is that simon went out like a punk.  I think they coudve ended it better but it still leaves you satisfied. YOU should definitely buy this. Also check out the first two because they are no slouch either.
B0000524CY|3.0|The movie is great, deservers 5 stars, this new version is cool, a bit longer but cool... The thing I hated a lot was you see in the back of the package: english, french, spanish and portuguese subtitles.... So i bought it to see the movie with my mon (she doesn't speak spanish) but when I went to my home I was surprised when I found only english and frech subtitles. I think this is terrible to announce something and don't include it in the DVD. They think that just saying: return the DVD and we'll return you the money everything will be alright.
0812548094|2.0|After a great book like Wizard's First Rule, Terry Goodkind disappoints with this 1000 page flop.  It seems that Goodkind stretched the novel to it's limits with about 700 pages.  He beat around the bush with lots of bull with them going here and there, and not actually doing what was important.  Kahlan was especially disappointing.  When in need of figuring how to fix the viel, saving 5000 men means nothing when the world is at stake.  I was sorrily upset with this 980 page book.  I expected something more than maybe 250 pages of useful writing.
B000002LCX|5.0|I have to say that this is my favorite compilation by the Smiths by far. It is definitely worth it to buy this one. This was my first exposure to the Smiths and I would definitely call myself a fan. There are so many great songs on this album.
6305280711|5.0|This is by far the best out of three.  I love all the Die Hard movies but this one brings action at its best.  From the Bizarre first challenge Simon presents to the train to the Aqueduct to the boat this title delivers.  One of m;y all time favorite movies.  Great Acting by Bruce Willis adn Samuel L. Jackson makes this timeless.  I will never get tired of this.  The movie was supposed to be over after the first 15 minutes but luckily John McClane was saved by Zeus from then on there are no boring scenes or any stretches of meaningless conversations just action how it is supposed to be raw.  By all means check out the first two they are no slouch either but this is the best one. Trust me. Would I steer you wrong? No cus i dont like wasting money either. Pick it up!

B00000JPH5|5.0|Don't tell me you haven't seen it! Everyone must see this movie at least once.<br />It's hard for me to be objective about this movie. I grew up with it and I've loved it since I was little. Now that I'm older I get more out of it and I have to say, it's one of my favorite movies of all time. It's charming in a fairy tale sort of way, but it also has a lot of good underlying themes like friendship, and infatuation. The main character, Sarah, starts out as a selfish young girl, but through the movie she matures. <br />The goblin king, Jareth, (David Bowie) is infatuated with Sarah the young girl. In a moment of frustration she wishes that he little brother would be take away forever and he disapears. then Jareth shows up and tries to woo her. Sarah asks for her brother back, and Jareth is infuriated. He tells her that if she wants to see her brother again, she has to find her way through the Labryrinth to his castle. Of course it's not as simple as all that, because he tries to trick her every step of the way, and he still hasn't given up his infatuation. Sarah has to outsmart him, and get to the castle before the time runs out, otherwise her baby brother will be turned into a goblin and she will lose him forever. <br />The music in this movie is great. As you might imagine, Bowie is the perfect fit for the goblin king and his voice is perfect for the eighties style songs on the soundtrack. I am so tempted to quote one of the songs... must fight the urge!
B00004SU5J|3.0|`Tourist' is a rather sultry affair of repetitive beats and adlibbed sounds, thus might qualify as a disappointment to some buyers. The feature song \\"Sure thing\\" may sound good for four seconds when played on TV as in the advert, over six minutes of it is rather irritating. `Tourist' is however a \\"bearable\\" album, but not what I expected. It was a choice which meant Janet stayed on the shelf, sadly much to my regret now. If playing Tourist on your computer, switch on the 3D sound effects (on volume icon). This lets the other instruments outweigh the very loud base. <br />Rose Rouge: Boring at the start, and over seven minutes long. Annoying voice-over but good sax and a good beat.           5/10<br />Montego Bay Spleen: Very groovy, nice feel to it. Grows on you. Relaxed sound. 6/10<br />So Flute: Flute is the component of this track (duh), all 8:29 mins of it. Again, annoying voice at start, but bearable. Heats up over period, and very catchy. Has Piano mixes but an unworked end.         8/10<br />Land of...: One of the best tracks on the CD. Very rhythmic and sounds like something you would hear in the lounge of a Westin Hotel at night. Builds up and down with Sax and Piano.  Has neat drum sounds, very Afrikan at the end.    9/10<br />Latin Note: Not the best song- rather jived and sounds like a children's' TV theme of some kind. Fast.         8/10<br />Sure thing: Nothing extra, rather long and repetitive, and that's a sure thing  (sorry)!  7/10<br />Pont des Arts: Nice top listen to, and nice keyboards. Fast and no voice. Something like you would hear on the Jazz channel on any airline, thus moving into the more mainstream of sounds.   8/10<br />La Goutte D'or: Very Urban, but nice to listen to. Not very exciting however.  7/10 <br />What you think about...:  Short and concise, if the album had been like this is would have been better in my view. Very streamlined and nice instrumental keyboard background. 8/10<br />St Germain's second album might appeal to a lotof people, but this is one you should sample before you buy.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|After the disappointing releases of \\"X Factor\\" (1995) and \\"Virtual XI\\" (1998), vocalist Blaze Bayley left to pursue his own solo career.  The spark of Maiden seems to have left the band, but a light at the end of the tunnel opens for this great heavy metal band.  Bruce Dickinson decides to return to the band that made him famous and convinces guitarist Adrian Smith to rejoin his former bandmates.  With that, they set out on another tour and recorded their latest studio album, \\"Brave New World\\" (2000).  With Janick Gers staying and allowing Maiden to be a triple-guitar-assault, here's the lowdown:<br />The Wicker Man - Great opening track.  The last part (\\"whooa\\") is a little weak, but no complaints.  Some fans remarked that this sounds too much like the Judas Priest classic Running Wild.  My response: shut up and enjoy.<br />Ghost of the Navigator - One of the epics.  This one is a GREAT track with Bruce in fine form.  Kinda reminds me of Rime of the Ancient Mariner.<br />Brave New World - the title track.  Really good, in my opinion.  I think the chorus is a little repetitive, but it's still a solid song in the Maiden tradition.  Dave's solo is terrific.<br />Blood Brothers - THE BEST TRACK ON THE ALBUM.  I love this song!  Steve really wrote a terrific song here and Bruce's vocals enhance it greatly.  Just a brilliantly written melodic rocker.  Everything about this is great.<br />The Mercenary - A meaty rocker with great guitars.  This song is a little weaker in comparison to the others, but it's good by all means.<br />Dream of Mirrors - I never really cared for this one at first.  I like it now, though.  Good melodic guitars and a midtempo beat make this song a Maiden staple.  Bruce's vocals are excellent as always.  I highly recommend listening to this, even though it isn't as good as the tracks before it.<br />Fallen Angel - Probably the weakest track on the album, but it's a solid rocker by all means.  Adrian's solo is excellent and the chorus is quite infectious.<br />The Nomad - Ah, another epic!  A great track and is brilliantly written.  It has a strong flavor akin to \\"Powerslave.\\"  Harks back to the old days of Maiden.<br />Out of the Silent Planet - GREAT track.  This one often goes overlooked for some reason, even though this and The Wicker Man were singles in Europe.  Bruce's vocals hit their peak in this song and the guitars weaving in and out enhance this one.  Why fans complain about the opening guitar lick by Janick Gers is beyond me.<br />The Thin Line Between Love and Hate - WHY FANS DISS ON THIS ONE JUST BAFFLES ME.  I've seen reviews where they say \\"this song is weak,\\" when it reality it's not.  This one's a midtempo rocker and the vocals are a bit weird at first, but I really like this song.  Bruce's vocals shine here as well.  Good way to end an album.<br />As for the fans that say \\"it's not as good as the 80s Maiden,\\" get off your high horse.  This one's great.  It may not quite measure up to \\"Somewhere in Time\\" or \\"Number of the Beast,\\" but this one's the best Maiden album IN A LONG TIME.  We haven't had a good album like this since \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\" back in 1988.  If anything, this proves that with Bruce and Adrian back in the fold, Maiden can still live on and bring forth good, arena-style heavy metal that we've all come to know and love.  With that said, don't wait... buy this album and give it a listen.  Fans, our time has come!tious.<br />The Nomad - Ah, another epic!  A great track and is brilliantly written.

0553278223|4.0|At the beginning, it was very confusing, because I had no idea what was going on.  The first time a &quot;main character&quot; was about to be killed(in the first story) I thought, he can't die now, it's only page 5(or something like that).  Then he died, and I was like, well, what is the rest of the book supposed to be like then?!  I soon found out that there were many different stories.  I don't particularly like sci-fi novels, but this one was pretty entertaining, I have to admit.  It was kinda neat how when the author wrote this book(around the 1950's, I think) he thought that by the year 2000, people would actually be visiting and living on Mars.  If you liked Fahrenheit 451, you'll like this book.
0451523938|4.0|I could not put this book down. I agree with everyone - I was reluctant to purchase this book because the story of Dr. J and Mr. H has been told so many times.<br />This is not the case - the writting is phenominal, and once you get used to the style of English, you just can't put it down.<br />The one dissapointment was that I thought it ended rather quickly and on a sharp note. I also feel the same way about &quot;The Bottled Imp&quot; by RL Stevenson as well. <br />Mind you, I also think that Asimov and Vinge's sci-fi novels end too quickly as well.<br />Have fun, and remember to book off a solid 2 - 3 hours to read the book in one shot.
0060955775|4.0|Talk about tow realities... Although I felt that Veronica's character &amp; story was the least interesting but her feelings, her thoughts  and her experience were the most touching. I really liked Mari &amp; Zedka's characters  a lot. Zedka had a lot to offer and Mari explained it all! Her thought's on life &amp; God's plan for us humans..made me smile I wanted to read that part to everybody I knew. But the best part is how the real world seemed fake to them all and their world seemed more real..you even think to yourself do I have to be in a mental institute to realize that. This book helps you to always remember the things that matter to you the most and how to always look, do and find the things that make you happy.  Paulo Coelho Fascinated me in the first book I read for him THE ALCHAMIST he truly know how to make you wonder and smile back..he simplifies things for the reader. He makes you hold on to your dream.<br />LooL
1558908358|4.0|This movie is special for me, because I found I loved computers after viewing it. The special effects are just great (for that time). You really feel like you're ON THE GAME! The story thought is very &quot;light&quot;, I think a deeper plot would've been more interesting. The beggining of the movie is too long too. But anyway, this movie is great. <br /> By the other hand, the spanish dub is from SPAIN, it's awful to hear a movie with that accent, they should've used the Latin American dub, because in Spain they use PAL, so, they'll never buy this DVD. It's a waste of dub, when are they going to understand we Latin Americans can't stand spanish dubs from SPAIN.... THe DVD lacks of Spanish subtitles too....
B0000029DD|5.0|I borrowed this album from a friend. I didn't give it back until 3 years later.  I never tire of it and I have new favourites when I play it.  Whether Grace appeals to the melancholic I don't know, but everyone who has listened to it asks the same question - 'can I have a copy?'  I guess that everyone has melacholy inside them.  I have the same regret as everyone else - that I never saw him live. This album deserves to be in everyone's collection. Fabulous music. A great loss.
0316776963|5.0|This book has made me laugh more than any book I have ever read.  I was constantly interrupting my husband's work to say, &quot;you have to read this.&quot;  I would read him bits and he would be cracking up.  <br />Every ounce of his commentary on the world around him is just histerical and so true.  He can turn even something as tragic as drug abuse into sidesplitting humor.  I couldn't pick a favorite chapter because each one is as funny as the last.  <br />I plan to pass this book along to all of my friends and family.  Anyone with a sense of humor, and even those without one, will fall over laughing.
0804106304|5.0|I thought this book was very well-written.  It shows the point of views of a proverbial family of women, and the trials that they all go through.  The mothers beared pain to make life better for the daughters, when the daughters grow up and end up feeling that same pain.  This book has a lot of heart, and it displays the emotions we all have at one time or another.  It is very true to life, and is overall a must-read for any woman.
B00000JCB2|2.0|i've heard far better. they're trying to be cool or something putting out mindless lyrics and some semi interesting guitar riffs. the only song i found worth listening to is no sex but the rest are repetitive and sound the same. a waste of money in my opinion
B00003CXP1|5.0|Just when you thought the Academy Awards had redeemed themselves by passing over fluff by awarding Hilary Swank last year, they go and succomb to the Julia Roberts machine. Anyone who's seen &quot;Requiem&quot; knows that Julia Roberts did NOT deserve that Oscar. It was Ellen Burstyn's erratic, heartbreaking, gut-wrenching turn as Sara Goldfarb that was truly the best given by an actress last year. Burstyn truly exemplifies &quot;acting&quot; as opposed to &quot;performing,&quot; which is exactly what Roberts does in &quot;Brockovich.&quot; Years from now, it will be Burstyn's performance that will be remembered and admired vs. Roberts'. Ms. Burstyn, if you happen to be reading this, just know that the millions of people that have seen your work in this film know that you are the better actress. And, guaranteed, Julia Roberts knows this, too.
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya does it again...her music is some of the best I have ever heard in the New Age realm.  <br />Wild Child and Only Time are my favorite tracks on this album...her vocals always shine and they really come through on this album. <br />Also be sure to recommend this album to others....if you aren't familiar with Enya's music....have a listen to this one....you are in a for an aural treat!! I've had a number of family and friends listen to this then go and get the CD...its THAT GOOD!
0517543052|5.0|a very cool book. i even bought copies for my relatives. skip to the brown pages. this book probably affected the course of my life. i got his latest book 'still here' and i was dissapointed. it almost seemed like he sold out. if you like this check out books and audio lectures by Alan Watts.
B000000P17|5.0|As sad as it is , this was the album that actually got me into punk rock. After hearing their covers of &quot;Aint It Fun&quot; (Dead Boys) &quot;I Don't Care About You&quot; (FEAR) , &quot;Raw Power&quot; (Iggy &amp; The Stooges) and &quot;New Rose&quot; (The Damned). From then on I went in search of the original artist which got me into the punk rock movement , so even though now I don't really care too much for GNR I still listen to this album for it helped get me into something I enjoy alot today.
B00003CXSM|2.0|Although it was obvious that they were trying to implement an original plot, this movie fell victim to the overworked cliches of a modern romantic comedy.Quite plainly, this movie was a cheap rip-off of the more successful (and more amusing) &quot;My Best Friend's Wedding&quot;.  The movie was bearable only because of its star-studded cast but even so the predictability of its weak plot dampened the capabilities of its actors. Romantic, maybe, but as comedy  it offered nothing fresh, particularly amusing or memorable. Skip it...
B00005LMBK|4.0|First off I have to say that I did not find this CD on my first endevor.  I looked in the rap section, and it was not there.  This is because of the great first single, &quot;Clint Eastwood,&quot; and I heard Dan the Automator's name attached to the project.  Who,  for those that are not familar to the hip hop scene, is the most creative producer out there.  Check out Deltron 3030 if you don't believe me.  However, back to the CD.  I finally found it in the pop section which started to turn me off.  However, I knew that Del the Funkey Homosapien would never do a lame project, so I bought it.  I loved it right away.  Not only is &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; a great song, but &quot;Sound Check&quot; also stands out.  It's a blend of a hip hop beat and great singing vocals.  &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot; is another great &quot;sad&quot; song.  Even though the vocals can get a little annoying, I really enjoy &quot;Man Research.&quot;  The only real miss on the CD is the &quot;Latin Simone.&quot;  It is not a bad song but it seems that the Gorillaz went a little far trying to make this a diverse a song.  However, it is very diverse and that is what is great about it.  Buy this album and enjoy it from beginning to end.
6301661737|4.0|Produced in 1980 with the finacial suport of George Lucas and Francis Ford Copolla, Akira Kurosawas Kagemusha is in all aspects an epic. It was a prelude to Kurosawas 1985 masterpiece Ran with his political and military struggles and existencial conflicts. The historical background is the feudal Japan during the &quot;Sengoku Jidai&quot; or &quot;Age of war&quot; that lasted to the begining of the XVII century. An insignificant thief is spared from death by Shingen, the warlord of the powerful Takeda clan. Because of the amazing resemblence with him, Shingen turns the thief into his &quot;kagemusha&quot; or &quot;shadow warrior&quot; training him to take his place in case of death for no less than three years. When Shingen is finally killed, the thief, under the vigilance of Nobukado, Shingens brother and the higher retainers of the clan is forced to fool not only the enemies of the Takeda but also the whole rest of the clan. As the story progresses we see the double grow and mature, gaining corage to accomplish his role as best he can. Theres also the relation between the double and Nobukado not just puppet and puppeteer but something more deep. The mask finally breaks and the death of Shingen is discovered by his enemies that soon take arms against the Takeda. From there on the fate of the clan will be decided in bloody final battle. The soundtrack spetacularly give the movie an epic,and heroic feel this being seen on the final scene. Kurosawa showed in this film, despite the slow ritm and the lack of great battles, all his talent as a master of his art.
B000002KD5|3.0|This is about as &quot;70s&quot; as music gets -- when I listen to it, I can almost feel the thick shag carpeting between my toes.  &quot;Monday Morning&quot; is neat, as is &quot;Landslide&quot;, but much of it is just drippy 70s SoCal voodoo nonsense (&quot;Crystal&quot;), or paperthin, &quot;I'm-OK-you're-OK&quot; pop ditties that are just this side of elevator musak (any song by Christine McVie).  The end result is equal parts pleasant and tacky -- just like the decade it was recorded in.
B000002NC4|4.0|These 8 songs push the limits of the possible in a pop/rock format.  Think of &quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun&quot; by the Beatles but 5 minutes longer.  Just like the aforementioned song, the cuts on this album leap from one musical thought to another.  What keeps these disparate elements together is frontman and guitar maestro Doug Martsch's sheer daring.  Take for example &quot;Kicked It in the Sun,&quot; just one of a handful of highlights from this album: it begins with a melodic but melancholy chord progression, then builds and builds until the final segment is miles away from the starting point.  But it works.  And it's cathartic, as well.  <br />What you get are these sweeping guitar epics--but guitar epics that are far removed from the likes of Yes and other wankers from the late seventies to the present.  These guitars sing, sputter, and roar as expressively and fluidly as a human voice.  Think of the guitars as a choral ensemble: the various parts compliment one another in the context of the whole--to carry the song until the end.<br />It's hard to call Built to Spill &quot;indie&quot; or &quot;alternative&quot; or &quot;lo-fi&quot; or whatever because Built to Spill (literally, they are built to spill all conventions of pop music) is founded on Martsch's peculiar and adventurous sense of melody and structure.  <br />The title &quot;Perfect from Now On&quot; can be read as a manifesto.  If this is the mark of the future of music, it's as close to perfection as we can imagine.
6305126976|5.0|On my previous review for this film, I said that Sydney Greenstreet played Sam the pianist. The actor who plays Sam is named Dooley Wilson. Greenstreet plays Senor Ferrari, a black market dealer.<br />As I stated before, this is a great movie that should be viewed by everyone who loves a great movie.
006016848X|2.0|I was very disappointed after reading the book I've heard so much hype about. I found it full of ridiculously broad generalities and stereotypes. Although there are a few nuggets of truth in the book, the majority of it is pop psychology at its worst.<br />I read this book over a year ago, and didn't care for it then. I like it even less since discovering that John Gray's &quot;PhD&quot; so proudly flaunted on the cover comes from Columbia Pacific University, a diploma-by-mail mill which was shut down by the California Department of Consumer Affairs. (Look it up for yourself on the web.)<br />All in all, I'm very disappointed with this book, its author, and the media attention it has received. There are far better books on relationships available, written by people who earned their credentials instead of buying them.  Don't bother with this one.
0783225849|5.0|I was six years old, already a rabid horror fan, and I was watching the late night movie at my cousin's house.  For the first forty-five minutes or so I watched as a woman embezzled $40,000 from her employer and went on the run.  I was intrigued, wondering how she was going to get away with it.  Then she checked into the Bates Motel, and took a shower.  The rest is history.  Boy did I scream!  As the frenzied silhouette of Norman Bates's mother tore into Janet Leigh with a butcher knife, I knew that I would never watch another movie the same way again.  From out of nowhere, the director killed off his star--less than halfway through the film.  From that point on a black-and-white rollercoaster masterpiece of terror took me for loop after loop.  Since that day, over a decade ago, this film has remained in my mind as a true example of what a director can do to his audience.  Horror movies from then on have been something I crave.  Not only did I discover cult classics and masterpieces, but I also learned of what horrible movies were also out there.  It goes to show that when it comes to true terror, only the classics can deliver: Jaws, Night of the Living Dead, Alien, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and my personal favorite--Halloween.  If you feel the need to be terrified, watch only the terrifying classics, including the film that created the modern horror film: Alfred Hitchcock's greatest masterpiece...PSYCHO!!! Steer clear of the crappy rip-offs and settle only for the best!!!  The movie: Psycho.  The experience: unforgettable. See it NOW!
B00003CX6P|1.0|Scroll down the list of other reviews, another guy understood this movie and actually liked it because it is homo-erotica.<br />The boat scene spelled it out so plainly- Ripley was on the bow, spread eagle, while Jude was delivering rhytmic thrusts from the motor, and the rhythm of the boat hitting the waves plainly spelled out THE NASTY. Anyone who doesn't get that scene doesn't understand movies, and should stick with watching Brady Bunch reruns.<br />The problem is that right at the point when it's clear that Ripley is gay, he kills the guy in self defense, maybe, since Ripley whacked the guy pretty good with an oar to start things. So the first boyfriend is dead, and rather than play dumb, Ripley assumes the boyfriend's identity, so as to be rich.<br />And then this awful claustrophobia descended upon me as this murderer went around evading capture. Then I &quot;got&quot; the movie- that the feeling of a homosexual who fears being &quot;outed&quot; is the same as a guy who could be captured and punished. How awful of a fear it must be to come close to being outed if you don't want to be outed. Fine, that's great, but then the movie continues on, and in his quest to not get caught, Ripley kills again, and again, and tries to kill Paltrow's character. Uh... this is not a goodguy anymore, you don't kill people so that your life can be more convenient, DUH!<br />The final scene, in which Ripley escapes Italy with his boyfriend, might be the last, but a gal sees Ripley, and oh-he &quot;HAS&quot; to lie to her. WTF?!? And as a result he &quot;HAS&quot; to kill his boyfriend. That transformed the movie from an artistic mainstream message of &quot;how horrible a fear, to be outed&quot; to downright &quot;people are tools, make them suffer&quot; erotica for a handful of people. Fine, but why spend all that money and talent making a movie that only appeals to a small segment of the population? Nobody from Idaho to Ohio will &quot;get&quot; the snuff-nature of this film. Ahandful of other people who like shiny things will claim to like the movie, which if they don't understand the strong homosexual foundation of the film, how can their opinion possibly be of merit?<br />The final insult to the intelligence is listening to the mindless director who claims that the movie could have been a musical with only a little bit of work (huh?) and his epipheny that he feels he did a successful job in keeping Ripley likeable, and the audience rooting for him, even after he has murdered. I guess this director doesn't appreciate the fact that murder is wrong, no people don't root for Ripley, and no the movie didn't come close to being a musical.<br />Remember Dirty Harry, and the psychotic badguy that Harry tried to catch? Talented Mr Ripley is like watching Dirty Harry throught the eyes of the badguy, like you're rooting for HIM.<br />Simply an awful movie, a total waste of time.
6305546789|5.0|It began innocently enough: My grandmother and I renting a movie when I spent the night at her house.  We watched in silence as creepy, staccato piano music filled the room, and a glowing jack-o-lantern appeared in the darkness.  From then on horror had a new face and a new name.<br />&quot;Halloween&quot; is truly the scariest movie of all time.  The premise is chillingly simple: Fifteen years after murdering his sister, a souless, masked maniac returns to his hometown on Halloween, relentlessly pursuing three teenage babysitters, while being trailed by his own obsessive psychiatrist.<br />That's it.  No complex plot twists. No excessive blood-letting.  No big-name stars.  Just a babysitter going up against evil incarnate.<br />Everything about this movie is excellent.  From the taut, concise screenplay by director John Carpenter and producer Debra Hill, to the fantastic performances of Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis and Jamie Lee Curtis (in her star-making role) as the virginal, babysitting heroine Laurie Strode.  From Carpenter's chillingly simple music score--reflecting the simplicity of the film itself--to the creepy atmosphere and excellent use of widescreen framing.<br />The last 92 minutes of this film are the most frightening of all time. (NO JOKE!!)<br />The film is less of a viewing experience, and more of a nightmare that you can't wake up from.  Echoes of Alfred Hitchcock's &quot;Psycho&quot; and Bob Clark's &quot;Black Christmas&quot; can be found--but &quot;Halloween&quot; stands on its own: terror as simple as its title.<br />If you have never seen this film, rush out and buy it (but make sure you see in in widescreen).  Then sit back, turn down the lights, and turn up the volume.  This film, although over 20 years old, still has the original, effective power to make you scream out loud.  So, skip all the lame rip-offs, and go only for the terrifying original.<br />From its opening murder scene to the final confrontation between babysitter Laurie Strode and unstoppable boogeyman Michael Myers, you will find that this film will never leave your memory.  You'll be sleeping with the lights on for weeks.  Nowhere can you find a film as simple or as frightening as &quot;Halloween&quot;.

B00000IQB7|2.0|Movie Summary:  Ike tells the army to get rid of the UFO they have found. But they don't do a very good job because twenty years later, Motor Head Mike finds part of it in the junkyard of the same army base when he is trying to find something to pass off as his high school science project. Together with his friends Ellie and Vince, Mike cleans up the machine he has found and feeds it some power. It opens up a space time warp and sucks in his science teacher and spits out all sorts of other things. Mike, Vince, and Sherman, steal the guns from some Vietcong soldiers that have popped out of the warp and shoot everything that moves. They rescue Ellie and save mankind.<br />My Opinion:  I think it's mostly nostalgia that makes people rate this movie high. There are a lot of other movies that do it better. It takes this movie so long to get to the good parts. A movie like this should be all good parts. Fisher Stevens and Dennis Hopper both give good performances, but it isn't enough to make this movie good. This is one of those movies that is a lot better when you are a kid.<br />DVD Quality:  Wide Screen 2.35:1 NON-Anamorphic on one side, 1.33:1 full screen on the other. DD2.0. The only other menu item besides &quot;Play Movie&quot; is &quot;Scene Selection&quot; this is as bare bones as it gets. The sound and non-anamorphic video make this a very poor DVD offering.<br />What You Should Do:  Steer clear unless this is your favorite movie in the world and you just have to have it on DVD. If you remember it fondly, keep it that way by not seeing it again.<br />Related Movies To Check Out:  Teen Wolf, Back to the Future, Weird Science, Sixteen Candles, Laserblast, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Explorers, Goonies, E.T., The Iron Giant
B000053VAF|5.0|&quot;Dogma&quot; began with some notes by Kevin Smith(Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy) before he even thought up &quot;Clerks&quot;. Back then it was originally called &quot;God&quot; and he only had a few scenes written on some notes. Since then, he has written and directed &quot;The Jersey Trilogy&quot;, which all surround semi-biographical stories of his life in New Jersey. This time around, New Jersey is the destination, not the primary setting. It is here where the story will begin and end.<br />New Jersey: 1999<br />Cardinal Glick(George Carlin) plans to celebrate his Catholic church Centenial by steering Catholicism from a bleak past to an upbeat future. Anyone who enters the church will be in a state of grace, and all of their past sins will be gone. This is the event that two fallen angels named Bartleby and Loki(Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) discover as their loophole back into heaven. If they walk through the doors, their sins will be gone. After that they would have to cut off their wings, and then get killed, therebye sending their souls into heaven. They have been banished to Wisconsin until the world ends, and when that happens, they will have to sit outside of Heaven's gate for the rest of eternity. So they decide to travel to New Jersey, in order to return home. The problem is that if they get back into heaven, it will negate God's decree and all existence will dissapear as we know it. <br />The over worked voice of god named Metatron(Alan Rickman) summons a Catholic who's lost her faith named Bethany(Linda Florentino). She is helped by two profits named Jay and silent Bob(Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith). The pair are going to New Jersey anyway, so she asks to go with them. On the way they meet Rufus(Chris Rock), a dead man who claims that he is the 13th Apostle and was only left out of the bible because he is black. They all travel on their way in the attempt to stop Bartleby and Loki from succeeding.<br />Kevin Smith(Writer/Director) creates a comedy that is purely fiction, but it often seems quite believable(concerning religion). It also mocks those people who would hate it without seeing it first(There were many). It opens with a disclaimer stating that it is purely a work of fantasy, and that it shouldn't really be taken seriously. It goes on to make a joke about the platypus and then apologizes to all of the platipi enthusiasts out there. As far as the cast goes, there can be absolutely no complaints. It is suprising that Smith got the type of cast that he did because they were paid almost close to nothing. But it all paid off because &quot;Dogma&quot; is a satisfying comedy that puts a new spin on common belief. The characters of Jay and silent Bob have made an impression into the minds of moviegoers. The amount of speaking that Jay does sort of evens out the duo. Lots of people will love &quot;Dogma&quot; and of course, lots of people will not. Lets just hope that the people that don't like it see it first.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|When the movie first started I was blown away by the cinematography.  It was brilliant!  The beginning of the movie is crazy though, the Bohemian characters, and the singing...but it was funny, and well-done.  =)  The love story between Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor is my favorite part, though.  They both do amazing work in this movie, and the little smile that Ewan gives Nicole when he is in love with her character, Satine, is enough to make my heart melt into a puddle.  ;-)  The movie is so well-done, that I don't have any complaints.  Well, except the ending was sad.  But, it was a tragedy, so what can you expect?  All in all, it came together very well, and I already want to see it again! P.S.  I am now a huge Ewan McGregor fan, too!  =)
B00003CXN4|1.0|Unfortunately I went to see this film in the theatre.  It had potential but halfway through the movie we are to believe that Zeta Jones turns from naive house wife into a street smart, tough negotiator with a drug cartel.  Come on!  The acting was good but it never kept my attention.  I guess it was suppose to show how drugs affect everyone in our society.  The message was delivered but boring none the less.
B00003CXN4|2.0|WTH?? What in the world is wrong with you people? What is there to like about this &quot;movie&quot;(this monstrosity doesn't even deserve that title) Traffic does nothing more than bore, depress, and thoroughly annoy. Michael Douglas is a great actor, did they build a freakin' robot that looks like him, who has no expression(besides coldness), goes from one official building to the next and mumbles and nods to some officials? That was his role thru this entire movie. No more. And his piece of trash daughter going from a typical, casual drug addict to a ... in a week and then pissing and moaning at an AA meeting a week later? Sure, sure. Are we supposed to feel sympathy for her now? I wished her dad would have just disowned her and let her descend into hell. And the La Jolla segement in San diego--I'm laughing. HA HA. So Don Cheadle's partner is iced, his key witness iced, and he WALKS into the San Diego drug lords home, past the guards,creates a scene, and manages to plant a bug under a table? THAT'S how they ended it? Christ, I'm all for viewers' interpretation and imagination, but a BUG? There's no way to even contemplate what the outcome of that segment would be. Maybe the bug picked up sounds of Catherine Zeta-Jones and her druggie husband getting it on in the bedroom. Maybe someone found it and ripped it out and smiled about how smart they were. Do we care? Catherine Zeta-Jones' character was loathsome and paper-thin. She's a rich yuppie who's made out to be a caring,naive, loving mother, who after her drug lord hubbie's arrest, becomes a conniving, ruthless, murderous, drug-dealing witch for no other reason than to keep her fat, rich lifestyle? Why would she even care about her husband? It just goes to show you how pathetic and cruel congenitally wealthy people are. The only redeeming part of the movie was the segment shot in Mexico, with a yellow, grainy look. That and the subtitles made those scenes feel really genuine. Benecio del Toro does a good job as the honest cop, who is the only hero in this movie and you feel his pain as he is caught between the U.S and Mexico drug cartels.Also, this is the only segement in the movie with a believable conclusion! But the ending of the film--did I miss something? No, no, no. Actually the ending was perfect. I needed to return the video in ten minutes or I would be charged another $4.00! So there was the cop, watching the baseball game, and the movie ended! Sweet! The hype is misplaced, the Oscars are unwarranted, the characters are loathsome,the three parts of the movie are hopelessly disconnected, and the basic message is,&quot;the drug war cannot be won, its hopeless, so lets just wait for superman to come flying along and make it all better&quot; (Two stars only for the nicely contrasting visuals and the different camera angles) **My personal opinion on drug addicts: I fully agree with General Salazar. If there is one thing this movie conveys right, its that there is no point in rehabilitating or redeeming addicts. They are scum who have messed up their lives all on their own. Nobody held a gun to their head and told them to get high. Let them go to hell. That's what I think anyway.
B00003CWTH|1.0|This movie added up to little more than a rather large waste of my time and money (even renting it was an unfortunate waste of 4 dollars).  That the script would actually earnestly borrow a line from Aimee Mann's lyrics at an attempt at a dramatic moment shows what kind of level this monstrous heap of drivel is operating at. The group sing along to one of her songs was just plain dumb.<br />Aimee Mann's songs excel apart from the movie, lyrically open-ended enough to let you attach meaningful bits of your life to their poignancy.  Showing up prominently throughout this movie, however, her songs only further confuse an already garish, vulgar, and embarrassingly silly mess.  My respect for her music has gone down a notch by association with this puerile attempt at a big idea film.<br />To be fair, this movie had potential.  The characters were all at least somewhat interesting... but there was no substantial, intelligent, perceptive thread weaving together the hodgepodge of vignettes.  If you want to see a movie where brutality and stupidity actually go towards something meaningful, and where a  sudden biblical ending is handled intelligently, try renting &quot;the Rapture.&quot;
0452282152|4.0|Wonderful book! I really enjoyed it, I just wish it hadn't been so short! But other than that, I think it had a great story behind one of Vermeer's most famous paintings. When I got to the book store I headed straight to the &quot;Best Sellers&quot; shelf and found this little book. I read the summary on it and it seemed very interesting..I'm glad I read it, it sure was worth it and it made me think and take a closer look at the painting, seeing thru the eyes of an artist and wondering what he might have been thinking while he painted this extraordinary work of art.
B000002JA8|3.0|I remember when I first heard this CD at a music store that allowed you to preview it.  I heard the first four tracks, and man, I was sold!!  This album rocked!!<br />Then I listened to the rest of it after I bought it and wished that I hadn't paid full price.  The first four tracks WERE IT as far as I was concerned and the rest of the album seemed far from imaginative compared to the beginning where it felt like they were breaking some new ground--especially the natural (not electronic) rhythm exhibited in the first 2 tracks!!<br />Not bad to listen to, but get a bargain price on it if you can.
B000002KKX|4.0|Christopher Cross self-titled album that came out in the late 1970's would earn him four Grammies including Best New Artist, and Best Album.  <br />Cross indeed deserved those awards.  The album is great to listen from beginning to end.  Even some of his cuts that didn't get airplay are great to listen to including &quot;I Really Don't Know Anymore&quot; which one of two cuts that feature Michael McDonald on backing vocals.  The other one that features McDonald was the upbeat &quot;Ride Like the Wind&quot; which was dedicated to Little Feat founder Lowell George who passed away in 1979.  Another great piece that was not heard on the radio was &quot;The Light Is On&quot; which sounds like something from Swiss harpist Andreas Vollenweider which makes you wonder if he heard his music, since Vollenweider first record was not released internationally. <br />His best song on the record with no doubt is &quot;Sailing&quot; which would win Cross two Grammies for Best Record and Best Song.<br />Sadly Cross would never enjoy the success that others in the Adult Pop fold would have including Elton John, Phil Collins, Gloria Etefan, and Celine Dion.  However Christopher Cross is still recording and performing to this day, and still makes good pop music, even if it's heard by a few.  If want to check up on him visit his website at christophercross.com  <br />Be sure to check his self-titled record.  It's all how his career in music got started.
B000002UD7|5.0|By far, their best album, this follow-up album proved that their first album was no fluke.<br />Here were musical programmers who could prove that you can program music to sound good and the lyrics to sound even better.<br />Some Americans may not know this, but the last song, King's Cross, touches on the events leading to a deadly fire at King's Cross subway station in London that killed more than thirty people before the album was released. I lived there between 1986-1993, and I remember that disaster quite well and its emotional slant catches in my throat. Ever since that time, you will never again find escalators on the Underground with wooden steps (the cause of the fire).<br />There are very few &quot;ok&quot; songs on this album; I'd say 90% of it is first-rate and all of it is quite good. Enjoy a taste of London--I know that I have.
B00003CXRP|5.0|A bit long, but the ending is the payoff and much worth the wait. Great digital sound and DVD extras.
B00004Z4WR|3.0|This is a moderately entertaining, fast paced action film. Nicholas Cage gives an engaging performance as a reformed master car thief, known as \\"Memphis\\" Raines. Giovanni Ribisi convincingly plays his stupid, younger brother, Kip Raines.<br /><br />\\"Memphis\\" comes home to help his younger brother, Kip, who has followed in his older brother's footsteps but is not as skilled at stealing cars. Having screwed up a major car boost, his employer, a sadistic, maniacal individual, will kill him, unless \\"Memphis\\" agrees to fulfil a contractual obligation of stealing fifty top of the line cars for which Kip's \\"boss\\" has made a commitment. The only glitch is that \\"Memphis\\" has a decidely short deadline in which to make his quota.<br /><br />For reasons that those who view the movie will immediately discern, \\"Memphis\\" agrees to this thankless task. He gets his old crew together and with his former nemesis, a hard nosed detective played by Delroy Lindo, in hot pursuit, the games begin.<br /><br />Look for lots of action, some great car chase sequences, and a bit of suspense. If you are looking for some mindless entertainment, then this film will fit the bill. Kick back your shoes and hang on for the ride!
B00003CXN4|5.0|This was one of the best movies of 2000. Benecio Del Toro's performance was mesmerizing. Extremely good storytelling through melding of performances and editing. Highly recommended.
0944379044|5.0|\\"Mein Kampf\\" is an important historical source and probably should be read as such. If you can get through Hitler's bombastic writing, the sheer volume of the book, and many of its obscure German historical references, it will definitely give you insight toward the internal momentum that lead Germany to wage the second World War.<br />Among other things, \\"Mein Kampf\\" is autobiographical.  Hitler describes his childhood, schooling, his war experience and his subsequent \\"struggle\\" in the political upheaval of post-war Germany. While it is interesting to get into the dictator's mind, one should remember that Hitler had an enormous ego and that he wrote this book for public consumption. Many of his self-praising statements are simply false. For example, Hitler claims that he was the top student in his childhood history class and that his application to study in art school was rejected because the faculty felt that his architectural drawing was superior to his painting. These statements and numerous others are false, which is well documented by Alan Bullock, Ian Kershaw, and other biographers of Hitler.<br />Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of \\"Mein Kampf\\" is its literal force. Although Hitler may have distorted some facts about his past, he was scrupulously honest about his future intentions, which included killing the Jews of Europe and colonizing Russia. <br />In fact, \\"Mein Kampf\\" is more a combination of Hitler's self-promotion and a blue print of his future plans that it is an ideological tome. The central aim articulated in \\"Mein Kampf\\" is purifying what Hitler perceived to be the master race and providing it with \\"living space\\". But Hitler never provides a truly revolutionary idea that is comparable to themes found in works such as \\"The Holy Bible\\" or \\"The Communist Manifesto\\". Like Fascism itself, \\"Mein Kampf \\" is more about mood and momentum than the articulation of a compelling new idea. <br />If you are unfamiliar with Hitler's role in modern German history, you may want to read one of his numerous excellent biographies before tackling his own words. For anyone interested in exploring the phenomenon of Nazi Germany and how a despot managed to package himself and his genocidal intentions, \\"Mein Kampf\\" is an indispensable read.
B00003CXRM|5.0|O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? is another Coen Brothers masterpiece. Upon seeing this film I thought I stepped into another era or time warp or something. What a curious film! George Clooney is very appealing and likeable in this little oddball film. It grows on you after you get used to its style and music.<br /><br />Joel Coen and Ethan Coen have really captured something here. I find their films fascinating. There is some amount of magic and unwritten sense of order in the world that Joel Coen and Ethan Coen have created in this film. I watch it often and am still mesmerized by their curious style.
B00003CXRM|5.0|\\"Oh Brother Where Art Thou\\" is a wonderful film, especially if you accept it on its own terms instead of judging it by any personal preconceptions such as what a depression-era story should say, or how faithful and accurate a modern interpretation of the Odyssey should be. The film has a light-hearted goofiness to be sure, but this is part of its charm and part of what makes it work.<br />Oh Brother is the story of three escaped convicts lead by the garrulous Ulysses Everett McGill. On their way to McGill's buried treasure, the convicts experience the Cohen brothers' twisted and hilarious versions of the blind soothsayer, the sirens, the Cyclops, and other Homeric characters. Both the Homeric characters and ensuing events hardly follow those of the Odyssey itself. In fact, they are more like road markers in the film than elements in the plot structure. In the end, Ulysses' wins his duel with his wife, Penelope's suitors not with physical prowess but with music. These characters are mixed with some Southern legends such as a \\"baby faced\\" serial bank robber who does it for the thrill and a talented black guitarist who claims to have traded his soul to the devil for his musical gift.<br />Music is in fact the universal current of this film, which begins with a chain gang singing as they break rocks on the side of the road. Music draws the convicts to baptismal ceremonies in the woods and to the treacherous arms of the sirens. It enables them to con money from a blind radio station owner and ultimately proves to be their salvation. Some reviewers have commented that music provides this film with most of its artistic and thematic depth, and I agree with them. Just as the Cohen brothers seem to take their light hearted, Southern stereotypes a little too far, the music reorients us to the fact that these are real people living in a time of intense misery and struggle.<br />Some people may not like this film because the convicts lack depth of character. But I think the convicts are not meant to appeal to us with realism as much as they are a throwback to 30's era films.  There is something fantastic and whimsical about this film but I think this will only bother people who expect the film to take itself seriously. \\"Oh Brother Where Art Thou\\" is an exploration of Homeric themes, Southern culture, the impact of music, and a bygone era of film making. The Cohen brothers chose to do this with ironic whimsy, which may understandably irritate some people, but which worked for me.
0399230033|5.0|What a charming book!  My 2 year old follows the mouse carrying the banana on each page.  The animals are adorable. The story is so cute and easily understood.  It provokes lots of laugher and smiles and can be a great addition to home library.
0446364495|4.0|I picked this novel up at a local dollar tree for ...!!!  U know I had to pick it up. Anyway, I read through this novel in no time, being that it is so easy to comprehend and read. The novel's entertainment level ws very low at the beginning, but as the story progressed, so did the entertainment level. The age of Francesca, and Robert turned me away from the novel, slightly, being that im only 18 but I had to make do. The novel, to me, seemed almost unreal. It is almost impossible to believe Francesca would have done what she did, being that she is a wife, mother, and country dweller ( the situation she was put in does not happen everyday.) Also, Francesca's attitude towards someone she barely knew was unbelievable. Lets just say, love at first sight was shown in The Bridges Of Madison county. You can either view this novel in one way, with it being cheasy novel about a one time fling, that was rediculous and out of line. Or, you can view this novel as unique, touching, and breathtaking. Take your pick.

0689835604|4.0|We couldn't wait to get this book. My 18 month old son has this fascination with his belly button! The book itself is sturdy with big flaps and bright colors that my son loved to lift. He knows where on the body the eyes, mouth, etc., are already. This book shows under and behind things and reinforces what he knows. When reading him this book he liked to point to the parts mentioned on himself and me. Although the book itself is sturdy, the flaps are not attached that way. My son pulled some of them off when I left him playing with it on his own. Little ones might pull them off if not watched when they play with the book.
B00000DR52|4.0|Producer Jeremy Thomas and composer Ryuichi Sakomoto had worked together previously on the stark and at times surreal 'Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence'.  The soundtrack for that movie was a critical (though largely electronic) success.  So it was almost inevitable that for Thomas's next oriental project, the sumptuous 'Last Emperor', he would again recruit Sakomoto for the soundtrack.<br />What I don't understand is why Thomas also commissioned David Byrne to contribute several compositions.  (Unfortunately the extensive CD sleevenotes tell us much about the making of the movie, but nothing about the construction of the soundtrack!)  Did Thomas simply want to instil a healthy sense of competition between two leading composers, or did Sakomoto run out of inspiration?  There's no sign of the latter here, because every one of the Sakomoto pieces is a gem.<br />David Byrne clearly did his homework for this movie, listening carefully to not just chinese music, but also to Sakomoto's previous work, presumably intending a smooth blend between the tunes written by the two composers.  But actually Sakomoto had moved on since 'Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence' -- he was now writing large-scale, mostly acoustic, orchestral pieces for 'The Last Emperor' -- so the transition from the Sakomoto section to the Byrne section isn't quite as seamless as Byrne might have planned.<br />In retrospect, perhaps the most influential of all the music here is track #4, the chinese chamber piece, 'Picking Up Brides'.  If nothing else, it provided the material for a seemingly endless sequence of Andreas Vollenweider albums!<br />This is one of those few soundtracks which stands on its own.  There is much to be enjoyed here even if you never see the movie.  But you'd be missing a visual treat.
B000001F6N|4.0|Saw the review below, &amp; I must say that Peter Green sounds absolutely NOTHING like Clapton. You can say he influenced him, but the way Green uses his tone &amp; dynamics... added with his singing.... you begin to wonder if Peter Green might not be the GREATEST blues guitarist from England. The old saying of &quot;more is less&quot; is the school he came from, &amp; he really makes every note count. I don't think Clapton has/had the restraint that Green had...<br />This album is somewhat inconsistent in its material, but the devastating track &quot;Supernatural&quot;, will make up for any inconsistencies. The use of feedback on this song is totally different from say.... Hendrix, &amp; it's really... &quot;worth the price of admission&quot; as they say. Clapton's Bluesbreaker album is probably more consistent, but the high points on Hard Road eclipses the highpoints on the &quot;beano&quot; album. If you ever wondered where Santana got his style from......<br />This album NEEDS to be re-mastered!!! Recommended.
B00005BJ2O|1.0|after seeing this movie and thinking that the music was the best part about it, i almost cried when seeing the track list on this CD.  What ever happened to this movie bringing back the movie musical when they don't even release the actual songs?  personally, the show must go on was my favorite number and i thought a pivotal point in the movie, and they didn't include it?  i am sorry the bottom line is they butchered the soundtrack.
B000002GJH|5.0|i bought this cd and it was a good buy, first off theirs say hello 2 heaven witch is worth buying the cd alone for, but the song hunger strike is the song that really gets ya, it starts off with chris cornell singing then out of no where here comes eddie vedder! then they sing togather. this 1 of the best songs ever written.
6303965415|5.0|When I first watched this film I was bored.  The filming was rather dark, and I couldn't follow the plot very well.  However, I was young and inexperienced in the ways of Austen, and anything that didn't have Gwenyth Paltrow or Emma Thompson wasn't too interesting to me.  However, I waited some time, and watched it later.  After reading the book, I became enchanted with the movie.  Amanda Root is the perfect person for the role, as well as Ciaran Hinds.  It is very faithful to the book, and captures all of the good that it has to offer.  This for me now is the perfect book for me to snuggle up with on a rainy night, and I would urge anyone who thinks it a bit boring, or a bit heavy to give it a chance and maybe you'll learn to love the characters as I have come to do.

B00000JG41|5.0|Mr Bungle. Yes those funny musicians from San Francisco have done it again. They spent more than a decade constantly shifting and surprising their listeners with an ever morphing style motif that has stayed in the same place about as long as a four year old on a Fun Dip Sugar high. The debut, produced by notable avant garde terrorist John Zorn, was a sexually lewd romp through metal, funk and carnival music. The delayed 1995 issuance of Disco Volante was a destructive noise and discordant collage of very difficult music that most likely alienated their original base of fans. Yet after all that, the band decide to release a sweet and candylike album (California, not to be confused with Red Hot Chilli Peppers &quot;Californication&quot;) that you start to wonder exactly why you are feeling so warped by the end of the album. <br />Sweet Charity is a light breezy tropical sound<br />None of them knew they were robots show how experimental Mr Bungle really are with that cheesy sound<br />Retrovertigo is an accoustic masterpiece that will stick in your head until you get sick of the album (I never said that you ever will)<br />The Air-conditioned nightmare is just pure Beach-Boysy Satanic fun<br />Ars Moriendi' sounds like the debut's 'Stubb (A Dub) mixed with Romanian gypsy music<br />Pink Cigerette is a sad catchy song that really shows how good Mike patton's voice is<br />Golem II is your typical slap in your face sound that Nintendo always gave you in the early ninetys and makes me wanna boogy<br />The Holy Filament is so beautiful it makes me want to cry<br />Goodbye Sober Day has a Balinese Kecak ritual vocal line morphed into mosh-metal<br />Ultimately, 'California', stands as a perfect album if you're in the mood of having sex. I mean, it's worked for me so far.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Brad Pitt and Edward Norton deliver thier best performances in this flawless epic. Wonderfully directed by David Fincher, Fight Club delivers delivers non-stop thrills and blows you away at it's shocking conclusion.
0800103661|5.0|Appropriately titled, this movie is dramatic, suspenseful, and intensely thought-provoking, for its originality.<br />Vincent (Ethan Hawke) trades identities with a crippled person (Jude Law) who wants to be &quot;perfect,&quot; in the far-off world, where people are genetically engineered to be perfect; no diseases, no ailments, just... just perfect, except for Law.<br />Vincent falls for a gorgeous woman (future wife Uma Thurman, very sexy as Poison Ivy in &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;) and somehow they both get mixed up in a murder investigation, leading to a very thought-provoking and sad ending. This is intelligent, gripping, dramatic... this is what all sci-fi movies should be like, and only a few succeeded, like &quot;Contact.&quot; What a pity.<br />Rated PG-13 for language, violence, sexuality, and some brief nudity.
B000050FEN|5.0|Brad Pitt collaborates with David Fincher once again in the gripping thriller, SE7EN. A wonderful script written by Andrew Kevin Walker, who collaborated with Jim Uhls on the writing of Fight Club, is brought to life by Director David Fincher. Perfect.
B00005KHEU|2.0|I already own this on vinyl and the original CD.  I bought it to get the remastering and the bonus tracks.  The remastering does seem to make it sound better, especially on the low end.  However, these &quot;bonus tracks&quot; don't seem like much of a bonus.  The first bonus track &quot;on the run&quot; seems like an early version of the real &quot;On The Run&quot; on track seven, and is 59 seconds long.  &quot;Second Time Around&quot; is 41 seconds long!  The third bonus track is a really fun tune, but it wasn't worth re-buying this CD for.<br />I recommend this CD if you are an ELO fan and you don't already own this recording in a different version.
B00003CXBK|5.0|As there are already a lot of excellent customer reviews, I'll only throw in my 2 cents.  <br />This is an excellent blend of action anime with a many-layered dramatic story.  While it is probably too &quot;adult&quot; for a pre-teen (graphic violence and the complexity of the characters), it is rare to see any film pack that much &quot;meaning&quot; and drama while still having enough visual conflicts to keep the action addicts happy.  There is no black and white in this movie.  There are no &quot;darkest villians&quot; or &quot;perfect heros&quot;.  Just many real people with real emotions, ideals, and prejudices.  <br />The violence may be graphic, but it is not pointless, though it might require a decent knowlege of the martial arts, asian or western, to fully appreciate.  Watch the reactions of the spectators and remember that most people in film have only seen swords and arrows as weapons.  To them, a musket that can fire half-inch diameter ball of iron the same distance as an arrow is a super-weapon.  Then consider a hand-cannon (tiny canon mounted on a stout staff for support and bracing - the first firearms) that fires 2-3 inch diameter solid iron balls, the power of the nature clans, and the power of a demon curse.  No, I'd say the graphic aspect is pretty tame.  I've fired a one inch hand cannon (historical re-creation society - and no, NOT at any person or animal - sickos), so I've seen first hand what they can do.  I'd say an excellent job was done conveying the horror of the conflicts without getting gratuitous or showing what would REALLY happen (Saving Private Ryan for example, which is still watered down).  There may be some scenes that seem like pointless violence (expecially with the English Dub), but you should discover the meanings after watching it several times.  I'm over half a dozen viewings, and I'm still finding subtle nuances I missed.<br />This is simply an excellent dramatic film with the freedom of visual expression Anime can provide,and boy, does this film provide!  For the greatest &quot;adult&quot; enjoyment, see the film in Japanese with the English subtitles (well, short of being fluent in Japanese with a good knowlege of Japanese culture and history, present and ancient - but that's a bit much to ask)<br />As for the Dubbing - well, considering the prejudices of the US film market and the realities the film buisiness, they pretty much have to &quot;dumb&quot; down the English versions to create a wide enough appeal to pay for the English release in the first place, expecially since this was first done in the US as a theatrical release with some expensive talent.  While the English dub definately loses a lot of the drama of the original Japanese, it certainly is not near as bad as 80% of the other dubs I've seen.  As it stands, it is an excellent translation for the general English speaking audience.  And if it gets more people to appreciate Anime and hopefully insipire them to watch it with literal English subtitles, well I consider it a good thing.  As it stands, unless there's a multi-billionare out there who wants to spend a LOT of money to get an accurate English dubbing and the extra treatment a lot of Anime deserves, we'll all just have to settle for a good subtitle job or learn fluent Japanese and sorrow for the countless others who miss the true nature of good Anime.<br />In short, this is one of the best FILMS I have ever seen.  It's a real shame that the distributors chickened out and haven't marketed it as it deserves.  But, what can you expect from Buena Vista (a.k.a. Disney) since it is so vastly different from their standard &quot;animation&quot;.  While I can decry about what should have been done, I also have to thank them for making it widely available.<br />Hmmm....seems I dropped a $20 bill with the two pennies.
B000053VAF|4.0|Biting satire, slapstick comedy and a very heavy message plus good acting (mostly) make this film a real winner. I recommend this one to anyone who is'nt a religious nut (You know who you are) and loves good movies.
B000056VIY|1.0|Lopez is a testament to the fact that good looks and talented producers are enough to make a recording artist succesful. Although i don't believe she qualifies as an artist. Before bad-mouthing people like madonna, pherhaps Lopez needed to ask herself wether she actually had talent of her own. The song Play proves she doesn't. Hearing her squeaky irritating voice whine over uninspired computer generated beats is about as much fun as listening to screeching tires all day. Avoid.
B00003Q43A|4.0|This movie is an excellent vehicle for special effects and Will Smith-style comedic heroism.  It is a good blend of action and science fiction with enough humor thrown in to keep it entertaining after many viewings.<br />The story is fairly simple; the outcome predictable.  Still, the action scenes help tie it all together in a neat, slick package.  This isn't &quot;film&quot;  but it is entertaining and destined to be a standard in the video collections of many a movie buff.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|People, this is one of the the best albums you can find on the market. Jimi Hendrix is the most original an the most exciting guitar player of all times. I listened to this album for more than three hundred times, i'm not making this up, FANTASTIC!
0446677450|3.0|I can't give credit to the author for being a talented writer (albeit it was his first book), but the information - as basic as it was - is absolutely worth the time to plow through the storyline.  I finished the book in 3 days because I couldn't put it down - and I am NOT a fast reader by any means. (granted, the line spacing helped)<br />Anyway - If you're considering this book, take the time to follow the story - don't just accept a summary given by someone else.
0618002251|5.0|Because of Tolkien's reputation as a master story-teller, I began reading this book with absurdly high expectations.  The slow beginning confirmed my suspicions that such high expectations could not possibly be realistic, and I prepared myself to be gloriously disappointed.  Quite honestly, by the end of the first chapter I shared the opinion of the protagonist, the hobbit: I was rather unenthusiastic, and doubtful that the \\"adventure\\" which lay ahead could truly be as exciting as it promised to be. <br />But Tolkien rarely disappoints.  Within pages, along with our hobbit hero, Bilbo Baggins, I found myself launched into the famous fantasy world that is the product of Tolkien's imagination, a world of never-ending adventure, mystery and magic.  As I joined the hobbit on his remarkable quest to defeat the dragon Smaug and reconquer the dwarves long-lost treasure, I met a wonderful array of friends and foes - wizards, dwarves, elves, trolls, goblins, and a myriad of other fantastic creatures - and my imagination and interest never waned.  <br />By the end of the hobbit's adventure, like Bilbo, I was thoroughly satisfied.  At the conclusion, the wizard Gandalf remarks to the hobbit: \\"My dear Bilbo!  Something is the matter with you!  You are not the hobbit that you were.\\"  Yet it was not only the hobbit that had changed as a result of this adventure.  As a reader, I had to confess that I too had changed.  My initial lack of enthusiasm had entirely vanished.  I had participated in the hobbit's adventures, and like him, returned the better for it.  Tolkien's imaginative world is a world so vivid, that you cannot fail to return to the real world a changed person.  His descriptive abilities cannot fail to imprint his imaginary world in your memory.  This story is not deep, but it is delightful and unforgettable.  And like the hobbit, you will return to life the better having read it.  <br />What's more, you can go \\"there and back again\\" again, and again, because the joy of this fantastic adventure won't quickly wear off.  For all ages, this book is eminently readable and re-readable, and belongs on every bookshelf.  Don't miss it, because you will miss one of the most enchanting escapes that literature has to offer.
B00004YKUY|5.0|This latest effort by one of my favorite bands is well worth the cash.  Like many others I wondered if they could go on without Steve Perry.  I saw the new line-up on a Direct TV special and my doubts were erased. The new work on Arrival cinches it for me. Steve Augeri, the new lead vocalist, is fabulous. He nails the classics and soars in the new material.  I do not miss Steve Perry.  Neal is amazing as always.  Deen Castronovo, the new drummer, is outstanding.  Jon and Ross are brilliant as always.  <br />There is something for everyone in Arrival.  There are ballads, there are blazing rock songs (World Gone Wild is my favorite).  Just give this CD a try.  You will not be sorry.  I am looking forward to seeing them on tour this summer.  They give you your money's worth.

630460291X|1.0|Although I happen to really enjoy this movie, ignoring historical inacuracies, etc. I really hate this as a DVD... Half the movie is on one side, and half on the other! I could understand this with a really long movie, but for a 143min movie, they must be joking! Mine is going back to the store as soon as I get a chance. I'll buy the real thing when they get their act together... literally.
B00003CXMG|2.0|This is one of those movies you've heard so much about and are thoroughly disappointed by. &quot;Almost Famous&quot; is almost Gidget in it's simple pansy story about Rolling Stone Magazine's cub reporter Cameron Crowe in the early '70s.  The music isn't even relevant of it's day but are even older radio hits. This kid really began to ware on me. I kept wating for something, anything to happen.
0385501560|4.0|palahniuk has an interesting, sad, and depressingly accurate vision of his surroundings... so accurate that it forces you to laugh.  it isn't really going to blow your mind with anything new, screw with your head the way fight club did when you first read/saw it, or make your top 5 favorite books list, but his skill is hard to ignore.  an enjoyable and fast read.
B00001OH7T|4.0|Sure, it's plastic Bowie, ersatz Soul, whatever you want to tag it. But weren't we all excited when we saw David in his gender/race/species/genre drag singing on Soul Train and all those world-weary black dancers were looking around like &quot;Yes, he is funky, but he IS putting us on.&quot;  And he was, as he has been since he started.<br />I still respect David greatly even though I don't listen to him much anymore.  His Eno collabs were groundbreaking, and Ziggy Stardust changed my life, as well as Aladdin Sane.  This bump in the road before Station to Station (his &quot;Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; period - long live Nicolas Roeg!) was fun, campy, white kids playing around with soul and artifice and style.<br />I can't bear to listen to &quot;Fame&quot; much anymore - wore it out - but decades later &quot;Right&quot; (what on earth do the lyrics mean?) and, especially &quot;(All You Got to Do Is) Win&quot; can bring nostalgia calling.  &quot;Across the Universe&quot; is the only misfire; I'm no fan of David when he gets into his crooning mode.  That is best left to Bryan Ferry.
B00004Z459|4.0|there is no band like this out there. they blend a perfect mix of rap and rock that i could listen to all day long. one step closer, papercut, a place for my head, and crawling are a couple of my favorites. also, this is the kind of cd you could listen to with your parents in the room, because, unlike limp bizkit or staind, they don't use one bad word on the whole cd. one question, who is the &quot;you&quot; they seem to be so mad at in most of their songs? oh, well, who cares? this cd is the best
B00005AAFS|1.0|Maybe interesting if u don't understand the lyrics -&gt; I do and thing about it...
B00004XOWM|2.0|this was a major dissappointment. their previous cd was much better. only my way, take a look around and rollin' make this cd worth listining to. it seems limp thinks if they use the &quot;f&quot; word more than 100 times on the cd then people will like it more. what the heck is up with hotdog? they were right when they called it a &quot;f-ed up rhyme&quot;.
0140072187|5.0|I stumbled across this book several years ago and couldn't put it down or stop thinking about it - so much that  I developed an obsession that prompted me to actually go to Vietnam, just to be where this courageous and charming man was. This book is a powerful, intense read and explains so much about a war that I cannot believe was never mentioned in all my years of schooling in the US (70's - 80's). I've since read several other books about Vietnam, but none better than Chickenhawk.
B00005B4GU|4.0|I wouldnt consider myself a fervent Radiohead fan like many wacky kids in here, but i really appreciate a lot of their innovation and efforts of nonconformity.  i like OK Computer lots, Kid A for some songs (namely &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot;), and bits of The Bends.  What I think I like about Amnesiac is that there seems to be a more purposeful use of electronica than in Kid A.  The opening song is great in its simplicity of bubbling (however brooding) electronic beeps and synthesizers, mixed in repetitive patterns with Yorke's muffled yet soulful begging...&quot;Im a reasonable man...get off my case.&quot;  I think its pretty easy to identify the beauty in the &quot;Pyramid Song,&quot; with its droning escalating and falling piano and strings accompanying some of the most amazing singing hes ever done.  I will say that the first have peaks my interest completely, and the second have starts to loose me.  &quot;You And Whose Army&quot; is a wonderfully strange pseudo-ballad, and does what a lot of great Radiohead songs do-it changes into something else entirely in its own midst.  Once soft and affecting, then loud and rapturous.  &quot;I Might Be Wrong,&quot; which is maybe a very simplistic tune to many fans, is another really great song, full of pseudo-vintage throwing muses guitar action, a funky electronic pacing, and his patented wailing voice echoing throughout.  Im not one to put a lot of faith into critics, but i will say that Im suprised so many have blasted the albums final song &quot;Life in a Glasshouse,&quot; which to me is a really inventive use of traditional cajun/jazz/rock fusion.  It has a lot of really fantastic improvised-sounding horns pumping around the tune, with Yorke singing &quot;of course I like the sunshine.&quot;  It may feel a little out of place in context, and i think that is what a lot of critics have done to Radiohead...expecting that every album is going to be a concept album from start to finish is absurd.  there are alot of great songs in here that rate among their best in my opinion.  i think that there is absolutely no need for them to relate to one-another...a song is a song is a song...it is what it is...not whats next to it.  A great moody album, despite how it looses me a little at the end.  more than enough beauty to make up for its few weak points.
B00005J6UP|5.0|WITHOUT DOUBT THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE GREATES MOVIES OF ALL TIME. IT HAS EVERYTHING THAT MAKES A GREAT MOVIE. WAS MADE IN THE EIGHTIES AND IS STILL WATCHED OVER AND OVER AGAIN BY PEOPLE OF ALL AGES. A MASTERPIECE MADE BY A GENIOUSE. I LOVE IT, I WANT IT, IF I COULD ID MARRY IT (HEY IM SURE ITS BEEN DONE). ITS A MOVIE THAT IM SURE EVEN JOHNATHON ROSE LIKES. I HOPE THIS HELPS YOU WITH YOUR CHOICE. GET IT, IF YOU DON'T GET IT THEN WHAT A SAD LIFE YOU LEAD.  HEY YOU GUYS!! ANDY YOU GOONEY!!

014028009X|4.0|Okay, Bridget Jones is not great literature. If you are looking for depth and life changing revelations, this book is not for you. Yes, the plot is from Jane Austen, which Helen Fielding makes perfectly obvious from the BBC series and Darcy references. That doesn't take away from the book's charm, and for me, actually increased the fun. (By the way, Pride and Prejudice is not exactly deep literature, either, but I love Austen.) Yes, Bridget is definately insecure and disfunctional. To argue her faults misses the point. How interesting are perfect characters? I don't think she was meant to represent &quot;every woman&quot; or act as a moral compass. She's a character, and a surprisingly three-dimensional one, given the format of the book. She is a mess and I liked her and I enjoyed reading about her. I've read both books and have seen the movie and thought they were all very fun. Wasn't that the point? The character really resonated for me, perhaps because I'm a 30-something singleton who is a few pounds heavier than the media ideal, not dating anyone, and definately indulging in some of Bridget's vices. Should women stop obsessing about their weight, their calorie, alcohol, and cigarette intake, and their dating status? Of course! But a lot of us do, and it doesn't matter if you belong to this category, because Bridget is a character, not a reflection of the reader's life. It's possible to have a good career, good family, and good friends and still have insecurities. If anything, Bridget is a wonderful balance of bad and good, functional and disfunctional, pessimism and optimism. She's fun and funny and a really good companion to have when you aren't participating in your own social life. And that, dear reviewers, is my definition of a good book. I liked both books, but preferred the second because it developed Mark Darcy and the relationship more. The movie was a good adaptation, and wisely did not try to mirror the book. The casting was perfect, and I did enjoy the Hugh Grant/Colin Firth references in the book. Why the four stars? Like Bridget, the book is not perfect. But who wants to read a perfect review?
B000002HAF|5.0|I have just recently gotten in to the Pixies.  This is a wonderful album, and a great one to start with (since it is their first). It's got the amazing song &quot;Where is my Mind&quot; from the end credits of Fight Club, and just about every other song is as incredible as this one.  They have really got a great indie sound and there is not much more that can be asked for. Buy their albums!
B00005B36H|5.0|Through the past we have seen Tool evolve from opiate to undertow, undertow to Aenima. But laterlus doesnt seem to really sound like Tools previous albums.  Though still a great album one can tell that Maynards side project APC seemed to have influenced this cd.  The Cd overall is great and diserves 5 stars but is still not as epic as undertow and Aenima.  It seems to be plagued with unneeded interludes that could have been replaced with songs. While compared to other tool albums this is the worst but it just might be the best album of the year and a few years to come.
B000056VIY|3.0|Fits into the format of what every one else is doing.  J-LO just adds a little something extra, J-LO.  3 songs are cool!
B00004Z311|5.0|Legend is an absolute beauty.  The musical scores, both of them, are absolutely entrancing.  Tim Curry is an incredible Devil, and the story is both beautiful and classic.  This is a movie you can watch over and over...and over.
B00005LMBK|4.0|This album is one that i have been able to get straight into from the start.  Gorillaz contains the top 5 UK hit single Clint Eastwood and other gems like 19-2000 (their current single in the UK), Tommorow Comes Today, Slow Country and Double Bass.  If you want something that is fresh, new and exciting then this album is the one for you as it contains loads of class A tracks that will more than please people.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This album is fantastic - highly recommend it.  I bought it after having heard Video one time on the Oprah show - went right down to the store and purchased it.  She is a gift to women (and men!).
B00003CXN3|2.0|Yes-the acting was superb.  Yes-it carried good messages-the war against drugs is hopeless, and if you get hooked on drugs your life is close to hopeless.  It was too much of a documentary, though.  There wasn't anyone likeable in this movie, either.  It came across to me as boring and depressing.  I wasn't riveted.  It had it's good points, but the hype surprises me.  I wonder if it's one of those movies everyone claims to like because everyone else claims to like it and if you say you don't like it, you are considered a fool.
B00005J73X|5.0|Although I have most of the tracks on my single CDs, I still think what left are worthwhile.   My most favourites out of this album are those '85 recorded tracks.   I've been a fan since KTF so I do not know what was like in the era of hair bands.    The live version of Runaway and In&amp; Out of Love really got me figure that.   I also like Something to believe in and Rocking In The Free World.    And I do prefer the new version of One Wild Night to the Crush version.    Well, this is what fans have been waiting for so get it!!
B00000F1D3|4.0|&quot;Believe&quot; is a wonderfull dance record,but it starts to get a little boring by time you get to the 5th track.Besides the mega hit,&quot;Believe,&quot; I really liked Taxi Taxi,&quot; Dov'e L'amore,but can't understand why they included &quot;We all sleep alone.&quot;Cher must have needed on more song for the short album.I wish &quot;One by One,&quot;from &quot;A Man's World,&quot; was the last cut.Its one of my all time favorite Cher songs.If you enjoyed the hit single,and love dance music,you have to get this record.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|This movie is funny, smart, and well acted.  Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actresses, she just has this likability that's hard to resist, lol.  Even though this movie has a lot of humor, it gives you a serious glance inside the life of an alcholic.  I loved the acting, the story, and the smart dialogue.  See this movie, it rocks!!
B000056N8X|5.0|Here's the warning - I may give away a few spoilers, but I'll try not to, so apologies in advance if I give too much away.<br />Whoa!  Now this was the sequel you want to watch.  True, if you're the sort that only likes either the original film, (Christophe Lambert) or the TV series (Adrian Paul) you may not enjoy this one as much.  I've only seen a few dozen ep's from the series, but that was enough to get a good idea of Paul's character and his connection with Connor.  Unlike the other two sequels, which should be re-titled 'Pile of Pants' and 'Let's keep changing the title.'  Endgame really made an effort to count the adventures that Duncan had through the series, and his past history with Connor, before they went their separate ways.  The DVD extras were a nice touch; the interactive game helped answer a few questions, even if some of the answers seemed a little hard to believe (Orange juice?), the earlier cut of the movie was an excellent idea for an extra, as it shows some of the detailed work that was put into the film, and ultimately changed for the final cut.  The deleted scenes, (only a few) well, I can see why they might have been cut; I don't see Duncan being that disrespectful of (a friend's) property. My only real gripe with this film, is in agreement with a previous review, Christophe Lambert looked seriously old in the present day, (don't tell me they couldn't have used make-up, he looked fine in the flashbacks.) at least a lot older than someone supposedly eternally eighteen, (1518-1536) but maybe it was that terrible haircut(?)
B00003CX5P|5.0|Well i've been waiting for this moment for 3 years. I can't see why everybody thought it was a bad film. You've got to view it as a completely different film. Don't compare it to the other 3 films. <br />When i saw this film in the Cinema i was in shock &quot;STAR WARS&quot;     <br />&quot;oops sorry i dribbled !!&quot;<br />I think that the film was excellent a well thought out plot that has started to reveal the truth.<br />Just get it even if you already got the video.<br />Come on George Release The rest !!!!
B00000JY1X|5.0|Steven Merritt's bloated but highly entertaining 3-disk set is full of tremendously addictive little songs that are almost impossible to get out of your head. It's hard to believe that with the shear mass of this album there is but a few throw a ways in it. This is on one the greatest albums ever made.
0345440757|5.0|I thought the book was wonderful and informative. The author teaches the reader some basic facts about infants that can be quite helpful for new parents. While every suggestion may not be suitable for every reader, I feel that you can get a lot out of the book.
0783211856|3.0|Although I thought it was a good movie, it doesn't belong on the AFI top 100 list. And if it does, certaintly not at #9!! Spielburg probably can't believe it either. The movie was about 1 hour too long and the end was destroyed by the 20 minute wishy-washy Schindler speech about himself. The AFI has to consider many things so I understand why they would include this in their list, it's the first big budget &quot;holocaust victim&quot; movie. But that doesn't mean we automatically should include it with the top 100. Right? No? So you think I'm a racist? If you think that then you probably liked this movie and like it even more now. Go ahead, stick it on top of Citizen Kane. <br />Anyway, this film is very emotional so it will appeal to the ladies but not so much to guys. Girls like emotional movies and guys like creative ones. And I don't give mercy points when it comes to lack of creativity so I think it is just an OK movie in the end. Try &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; instead of this. It's the same kind of movie as this but way better.
0767811070|4.0|Usually, I hate these kinds of films about ghettoes, gangsters, and guns because they tend to glorify the very things they are supposed to warn the kids against (Superfly, Belly, New Jack City, The Mack, Colors, ad nauseum). But this is different and a tad more realistic. No high rolling pimps or drug dealers with flashy cars and fine women here, just some confused, wrectheced, stupid kids who choose the wrong path (Ice Cube and co) compared to Cuba Gooding who is growing up with wise guidance. So there's no delusion of the youth here. Oh yeah, for those who are put off by Fishburne's conspiracy theories in the film, these were inspired largely by a series of lectures that Min. Louis Farrakhan was giving at the time that were widely circulated in tapes in the ghettoes in the early 90s. Writer/director John Singleton was at one such lecture when he met Ice Cube and talked about making this film.
B00003CXP1|5.0|So I went to see this movie not expecting much of anything at all.  And I left the theater in awe- on the verge of seriously damaged, introspective and with much to think about. Not only was this film asthetically breathtaking, it was one that made you question a lot.  It pains me to hear it passed off as &quot;just another one of those 'drug movies'&quot; because it  was so much more than that.  It was a commentary on The American Dream.  The dream that has been glamorized in this society, was bashed and proven self-destructive and unrealistic in under three hours.  Yes, addiction did play a major role in this film but so did the idea that life is giving rather than getting (to loosely borrow the phrase from Selby) And it was the characters obsession with recieval that led to their downfall.  Asthetically- the movie was mesmerizing, haunting, addictive... the colors, the angles, the music- every frame a beautiful picture (in the begining anyways).  Basically, it saturated me and invaded my thoughts (even still, months after the fact)  And thus my need to purge my feelings on this amazing film.
6303109950|5.0|This is a great story about Wyatt Earp (Russell) and his 2 brothers who settle in Tombstone to enjoy peace and quiet and on the search for gold. They are met by Wyatt's friend Doc Holiday (Kilmer) who helps them fight off the Cowboys (who are a group of no good badguys who call them self the law in Tombstone) in the famous gunfight at the OK Corral. Wyatt who has hung up his badge and gun of a famous lawman has to help his brothers and Doc by coming out of retirement. Very good, a movie that can be watched over and over.
B00005ATQC|2.0|Eyes Wide Shut (Stanley Kubrick, 2000)<br />The good news is: it's not as absolutely downright awful as everyone said it was.<br />The bad news is: large parts of it are.<br />This is one of those prime examples of a two and a half hour film that begged to be about an hour less. The first hour of the film, including the infamous &quot;orgy&quot; scene (which is, for the record, about as erotic as a week-old scrod), is all setup for Tom Cruise's bumbling attempt at mystery-solving in the second half. As such, the first hour is slow and could have been summarized in a sixth the time without us losing anything (Kubrick could have dropped the insanely out-of-date moralizing in the first hour, which would have freed us from the film's unbearable last scene as well). Then we could have gotten focused on the second hour, where Cruise becomes obsessed with figuring out exactly who it is, and why, that wants him to stop asking questions about what he discovered in part one. This is good film, here. Take a guy who's not used to figuring out mysteries and throw him in the middle of one to see what he does. It's a time-tested plot, and it usually comes off well. It does here, too, and in the second hour of this film Cruise turns in his best screen footage since The Firm (surprise, surprise). Then we come to the last scene... and the whole thing falls apart. One would expect Kidman and Cruise to have at least SOME chemistry, them having been married and all, but the whole last scene sounds more like a first-time staged reading than a final film.<br />Not bad, but requires liberal use of the fast-forward button. **
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Awesome sound and ferocious creative energy. The album veers recklessly from sentimental to aggressive to passionate to hilarious. Tracks 3 -5 are one of the happiest sequences on an album that I know of. Guaranteed to make you shout.
B000001FQQ|5.0|I have been a Kiss fan since I was age five and have never lost my love for what this band stands for and the professionalism to which they bring their trade.  I'm thirty now and sad to see them go.  Hot in the Shade is their lengthiest studio album.  While every song is not a classic, they all show solid musicianship and a great variety of rock styles.  I love King of Hearts which would probably rank in my top ten favorite Kiss tunes.  This is also the best album of my favorite line up of the band.  I for one love Boomerang mainly for it's intensity and the killer playing by Eric Carr.  The musicianship on this song is solid and I doubt anybody could have played it better.  Read My Body and Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell are not great songs, but good songs.  A lot of Kiss's good songs are better than other bands' supposedly great songs and they hardly \\"stink.\\" I like the seventies albums as well, but the improvements in musicianship in this era made Kiss the band that it always should have been.  Not knocking Ace and Peter whose talents I also enjoy.  By all means buy this album, but if you are closed minded and only like the original line-up then you will not appreciate this album for what it is: a great diverse body of music by a band that captures the essence of rock-n-roll regardless of who lend their talents to it.  To Kiss, your legacy is solid and this album is a great contribution to a great catalog of music which is diverse, fun, risk taking, and ultimately satisfying.
B000002BPS|5.0|a great album, better than americana by far.  keeps somewhat true to punk, while crossing somewhat into mainstream rock.  great tracks w/ some good lyrics.  a great band that writes catchy songs.
B000001Y42|5.0|last year, around this time, I got the significant other cd, I was impressed and I wanted to hear more, so i thought what the heck I will buy their old cd too, cuz I had heard faith and I liked that song, so I got it, and it is just as good as significant other if not better, it is a bit, different,..from their new cd, but it is still good and would probably attract the same audience, it has rap vocals with rock backgrounds, if you like limp and you like their new cd, GET THIS!
B00005B36H|5.0|i never listened to tool, but i saw the video for schism and decided i had to check these guys out.  im very glad i did, this is incredible.  i call them art metal, bc they fit into no genre.  they are a genre all their own.  they are the modern day velvet underground.  the album is continuous, you have to listen to it as a whole, no skipping tracks.  a piece of art.
B00000IMCW|4.0|I was just a twinkle in my father's eye when &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; was released in the USA, but I can still get the same horrific effect from this movie watching on DVD as people did in the late '70's watching it in on a projection screen. The transfer quality as amazing, especially if you've ever seen it on VHS. In the beginning, Romero has the ability to actually feel bad for the zombies, for instance, when the police raid the apartment building and find that the tennants are hiding their &quot;undead&quot; family members inside, I really felt bad for the woman who did didn't want the police to shoot her zombie husband. But then again, he did take I big chunk out of her neck, didn't he? And,seeing a young Ken Foree from TCM III was awesome. The ending didn't have the same creepy feel as &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; did, actually it had sort of an &quot;A-Team&quot; feel to it, but I did enjoy the movie as a whole and would definetley recommend it to any horror fan.
B000003CMC|3.0|here's the lowdown on our favorite barbituate cowboys: this is the first album where dickey betts came out of the allmans shadow (for better or worse), for its dickey betts who ends up looking and sounding the best. yes, this album is somewhat of a patchwork, what with duane allman dying and all, but its holds together very well. a few new studio tunes, some great live tracks, &quot;blue sky&quot;, possibly dickey betts' best song, and ending with a beautiful acoustic duet between duane and dickey betts. but why only 3 stars? let me answer that with another question? is there anything more boring than a free-form &quot;jam&quot;? a: no, there's not. there is no need in this galaxy for a 30 minute &quot;song&quot;, unless you're high and too stoned to put something else on. thus, we have &quot;mountain jam&quot;, which, despite some good guitar work by the aforementioned dickey betts, is a 35 minute waste of space. this is still a good purchase though, just be sure to program over &quot;4&quot; or else you'll be asleep before you get to the best stuff.

B000007S5B|2.0|there has never been a more overrated performer in the history of rock music than jimbo (more like jumbo towards the end) morrison. any rock musician who considers him or herself a poet is not only wrong but a buffoon (outside of dylan and cohen, but just barely) you can be shakespeare with a pen, but without TUNES you dont need to be recording. this is the worst thing the doors ever did and displays why they should be forgotten. putting aside jim's sophomore level lyrics (&quot;5 to 1, 1 to 5, no one here gets out alive&quot;-wow, someone call readers digest, we've got a winner!), densmore's drums are truly dullsville, which is more than you can say about manzarek's &quot;wizardry&quot; at the keyboard-look, he's playing the same thing OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN EVERY SONG!! he might as well be a sampler. i wont say much about kreiger, as he was somewhat decent, and if you cant say anything mean... the big hit &quot;hello i love you&quot; was done better by the kinks when it was called &quot;all day and all of the night&quot;, &quot;unknown soldier&quot; is ridiculous (can one be more heavy handed and obvious than this song? oh yeah, there's a video!), and the rest is more than forgetable. blech.
B00003CXRP|3.0|&quot;Cast Away&quot; left me feeling very shortchanged.  At first, I thought the movie was hilarious, but then it takes a very serious turn.  The dynamic that Hanks displays throughout the movie is incredible: the definite bright spot.  But, there is not a whole lot of progression, development, or action.  For those who are looking for an exciting survival story, this is NOT your movie.  I find it odd that Hanks knew how to do everything necessary for survival.  I did enjoy this movie, but overall, it is depressing, leaving a sour taste in my mouth at the wrong point in the movie: the end.
B000002J1L|5.0|...and to paraphrase a later song, more fool him. You see, he was used to the \\"Trick Of the Tail\\" and \\"Wind & Wuthering\\" Genesis. While musically excellent, those albums lacked the \\"thinking man's punk\\" iconoclasm Peter Gabriel had taken away with him when he'd left just before. It's still at full strength here though. With the original wave of prog, when the rock'n'roll purists weren't calling prog by the apparent oxymoron \\"art rock\\", they were saying that all that was wrong about prog could be summed up in one word--\\"genesis\\". Like calling Rush \\"the headbangers' Genesis\\" and Kansas \\"the cornfed Genesis\\". But it was this period of Genesis that gave the lie to claims of pseudo-profundity and artsy-fartsy elitism. All you had to do was pay attention to the music. Like the song \\"Return Of the Giant Hogweed\\", a \\"Day Of the Triffids\\"-style descendant of the Coasters' \\"Poison Ivy\\" done up smartass in the finest Gabriel tradition. The giant hogweed is a particularly nasty weed that got imported into the West in the same way kudzu got imported into the American Southeast--some inquisitive idiot found it interesting. .... One interesting note from the song \\"Hogweed\\": \\"Strike by night, they are defenseless--they all need the sun to photosensitize their venom\\"--that's true, sunlight does strengthen the corrosive power of the plant's secretions. And you'll wind up with permanent scarring. You gonna try to tell me it ain't cool to write a driving rock boogie that's a mixture of a botany lesson and a monster movie scenario?
0671015206|3.0|Not as entertaining as the TV show and sometimes outright boring...I'll summarize the book in a few words....The typical millionaire looks like and dresses like the average person, drives an older car, lives in a nondescript neighborhood, acts and lives like everyone else BUT SAVES LIKE HECK.  [does not have a BMW, Gucci, or Rolex...has a Chevy, rack clothes and a Timex!!!]
B00005BCPC|3.0|This is not really an adaptation of Jane Austen's novel, it's more along the lines of fan fiction; it has most of the original characters, but they've been down the rabbit hole, eaten a few mushrooms, and come out all bent out of their original shapes.  <br />Fanny Price has been changed the most, and some will say that's a good thing.  In the novel, she's withdrawn and self-effacing, as you would expect, given her situation.  Having been separated from her family as a child, taken in by rich relatives as a charity case, and reminded daily of her inferiority by her mean-spirited Aunt and snooty female cousins, would she really have grown up to be the self-confident, assertive young woman we see in this adaptation?  I don't think it's very likely, and neither did Jane Austen.  Nevertheless, the new, &quot;improved&quot; Fanny plays better to a modern audience, so that's who we've got as our heroine -- but it wreaks havoc with the plot, doesn't it?  Would this Fanny be truly happy with the introspective, serious Edmund?  She almost seems a better match for the fractious Henry Crawford.<br />Not only the characters have changed; there's an addition to the plot as well.  The moral issue of slavery, not even addressed in the novel, is tossed in, seemingly on a whim.  I could almost give credit to the director for trying something daring and thought-provoking, if only it had been handled with a little more finesse, but this wasn't.  What's worse, the entire issue was left unresolved.  It felt as if the director merely added the slavery sub-plot to bring some excitement to an otherwise sedate story, then abandoned it.  I thought it was tacky, and couldn't see any real added value (aside from those lovely sketches - blechh).<br />In the end, I sort of enjoyed this movie... but only AFTER I'd given up comparing it to the book.  Important events seemed rushed, which you'd expect with only 2 hours to get things wrapped up, but the main points were touched on, and it all worksout pretty much the same.  This is Mansfield Park as seen through Patricia Rozema's looking glass, and it's only a dim, wavy reflection of the real thing.
B00004TH83|5.0|What more can I say? She has a fantastic voice, definitely on a par with Celine's, and coupled with the fantastic songs on this album, well..... I'm addicted! My latest Lara purchase is 'Carpe Diem' and I am currently becoming addicted to that too! Can't wait for the next album, Lara - keep up the good work!
6302797535|5.0|One of the funniest films ever made, this is a non-stop barrage of political incorrectness from start to end - and it's great.  Peter Sellers, Alec Guinness, David Niven, Peter Falk, and the rest of the cast all give fine performances. <br />Sure, the plot has more holes in it than a piece of Swiss cheese, but why carp? Sit back and enjoy watching some of the finest comedic actors of the 20th century at the top of their game.  <br />It's truly a crime that this classic has not yet made it to DVD.  I can only hope that it's been held back because Columbia's got big plans for a blockbuster special edition DVD loaded with goodies.  I've got my fingers crossed!
B000002WYT|5.0|The Dave Matthews Band is a group who you love or you hate. There's hardly ever an in between. Many punk fans dislike Dave, and many fans of heavy guitar loaded three chorders dislike them. <br />Society isn't used to hearing anything outside of our 4/4 and 3/4 time that we hug and cling to. Dave Matthews challenges this same society with 12/8, 6/8, 5/4, etc. <br />We're used to hearing the driving pounding straight drum beats, and Carter Beauford comes in with syncopation and creativty, playing the drumset like the musical instrument that it is. A quality not often seen in the post-Buddy Rich era. <br />The live concerts and the jam sessions. A true art is brought back into music with the Dave Matthews Band. The chemistry, musicianship and improvisation that was seemingly lost in Kansas City with Count Basie and his orchestra. <br />What is the Dave Matthews Band? Well, their a little bit more musical than most bands out there today. Does that make them bad? No. Does that make everything not DMB bad? No. <br />Don't dismiss something because it is musical and don't be too quick to dismiss those three chord rock tune. We all have a lot to learn and the best way to learn is to listen.
0790725657|1.0|I had such high hopes for this film when I heard that it was being 'defended' against major changes (such as the introduction of a love interest). Alas, instead it merely underlined what \\"Little Women\\" had already shown me: be wary of movies based on books you love. -A few of the changes made- the transposition of the setting from England to America, the recasting of Becky the scullery maid as a Black slave girl- were merely interesting differences; but the damage done to character and story by other 'revisions' was enormous.    This movie took one of my very favorite characters and destroyed her. The whimsical, Hans Christian Anderson-type fairy tales which she tells in the book are changed, in the movie, to stories that are darker, brooding, and rather scary, styled after Hindu myths. All the imaginative ideas which, in the book, she comes up with herself, are spoon-fed to her by her father in the movie. Sara Crewe of the book is a heroine's heroine; the girl portrayed in the movie is obnoxious, bratty and rude; plus, they changed the entire story by changing the ending. Lastly (and, for me, worst) the movie completely redefines the whole meaning of being a princess: in the book it's what gives Sara the strength to continue being kind, courteous, loyal, caring, and generous to others, even when those others are nasty to her. In the movie, we are told, EVERY girl is a princess- no matter how much like a common street beggar she behaves.    --fyi a far better film adaptation was made by Wonderworks, starring Amelia Shankley; unfortunately it is out of print and extremely difficult to find.
B000001F7R|5.0|Hysteria was released while I was in high school, and I remember it and Pyromania being played by pretty much everyone. I still enjoy listening to them occasionally today. (Portions of High 'N' Dry and Retro Active also rate well with me.) Craving more of the same, I found On Through the Night in a bargain bin, which is usually a bad sign. Nevertheless, I gave it a try, found it to be quite a bit different, and went on to other things. Every once in a while, though, I would play it for a change, and by the time I graduated from college, On Through the Night had become my most-played Def Leppard album (although, I admit, my tastes had changed to the point where that was perhaps not the mark of distinction it might once have been). Everything on the album is good, earnest material. My personal favorites are When the Walls Came Tumbling Down and Overture. Overture, in particular, is the best song Def Leppard has ever recorded. Buy this album and play it for your friends who &quot;know&quot; what Def Leppard sounds like; the effort will be rewarded with a pleasant surprise.
6305907145|1.0|How absurd that modern filmmakers feel that the public could not possibly understand the classics without their help. Austen is the ONLY classic author whose entire collection is still in full circulation - an indication that generations later, the audience still &quot;gets it&quot;. Hollywood has endlessly held the notion that they have greater artistic and creative powers in their peabrains than the authors whose books have passed through millions of hands for decades.<br />This version of Mansfield Park is, for the time, the most bloodstirring adaptation in existence - due to the contraversial retelling. In my opinion, the only consistencies are the names and bits and pieces of the storylines. Frances O'Connor gives an amazing performance considering the fact that she has nothing to work with - she is the gem and only point that makes the film worth watching. However, Fanny is no longer Fanny at all - the director has completely reinvented her. The most appalling sequence was the one in which Fanny accepts Henry's proposal. The chances of this happening in the novel are so absolutely impossible that I thought that this was some sort of dream sequence. In the novel, Fanny (whom the director actually shows getting smashed at a party given to her by the Bertrams - imagine Lizzie Bennet, Emma, or any of her other noble creatures portrayed in this manner) knows intuitively from the beginning that Henry shows enormous lack of character and NEVER for a moment considers accepting any of his attentions. The fact that she does so in the film is an enormous flaw and shows the director's complete misunderstanding of Austen's heroine. <br />Also, the pivotal chapters in Mansfield surround the play and through it, our players true characters are revealed(Austen's own midsummer night if you will). Fanny is the innocent one - set apart during this whole section of the book by her wisdom and naivete. I was shocked when the film skimmed it for only a moment.<br />The &quot;sketchbook scene&quot; was, without a doubt, too great a liberty to take with the work of a classic author, as is the entire storyline that corresponded with it. I'm sure we all understand the vulgarity of slavery without needing to see it graphically displayed in a format that Austen herself would refuse to watch. Austen understood something the director of this film does not: subtlety.<br />Finally, the most distressing scene to me was the moment after Henry and Mariah are discovered together. Rather than seeing our leading man and lady in a state of anger over what they've discovered, we see Fanny and Edmund aroused by the moment, grasping for each other and then ashamed by their own reaction. HELLLO! What is that? <br />And for anyone that didn't catch the sexual innuendo in the scene where Mary is helping Fanny out of her wet clothes - I have to ask what planet they're from. There was no Edmund standing nearby to arouse in that scene. Oh, and I almost forgot, the director adds such a nice touch to the character of Fanny's father by making him a pervert as well - clutching at his daughters in a way that makes your stomach turn.<br />Without a doubt, this film lacks Jane Austen's wit and wisdom. It disgusts me that it is considered some sort of tribute to her. Mansfield Park is considered by many to be Austen's greatest work - grand and subtle. Fanny's complex character is lost here, as well as everything that Austen was trying to say through her. This film has reduced this masterpiece to nothing more than the poor story of an unfortunate girl surrounded by perverts. But are we really shocked? Hollywood's idea to make anything better is - just add sex. From now on, I think I'll stick with the BBC.
B0000541VQ|5.0|This is without a doubt, one, if not the most memorable films of all time.  You can watch it a dozen times, and still be able to discover anew an incredible amount of stunning, yet simple, pronouncements on some of life's most profound conditions.  I enjoy the tight, and sophisticated word play.  The musical score is perfectly balanced.  A sumptiously displayed and highly thought-provoking film, laying bare the very essence of the morals and values of Western Civilization.

B00003CXDZ|4.0|The opening sequence would be best described as an attack on the senses with your brain trying to place the tunes while trying to play 'catch-up'.<br />It is a fantastic movie that would appeal more to those who grew up listening to music from the late 70's to the early 90's - from Marc Boland &amp; T-Rex to The Police to Nirvana.  Oldies may have a problem picking the tunes, with the under-20's maybe not understanding the significance of others.<br />Definitely a 'must-see' for the 27-37 age group.  Very much recommended for everyone else.<br />Only problem I had with the entire movie is that while Ewen McGregor *may* have a semi-respectable voice, he always looks like he is over-singing - he is much better to listen to, than to watch.

0446677450|4.0|Mr. Kiyosaki is a great story teller.  The book kept me interested all the way.  If your looking for a book to tell you how to get rich though, then forget it.  That is NOT his intention.<br />No other person will ever have the same sircumstance that led to this man's success.  In stead of giving you a formula he clearly states an axiom that is the theme of the book.  People with money are looking for ways to make money.  More clearly, that they look for ways to let their money make them money.  <br />According to Mr. K. that is the secret to success.  That the tratitional mind set of &quot;Work hard, get a good job, and you'll be taken care of,&quot; is what sets us all up for finacial dependance is also a key theme. He describes this as the trap that prevents many people from being finacially independent.  He never once said that education is not important.  On the contrary he states it is &quot;The most important asset.&quot;  What he does say is that the best education is had by doing.<br />Get and read this book.

B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing.  If I have a friend over who hasn't seen a DVD, this is the one I show them.  This movie is the truest form of story in that there is no total antagonist.  Everyone is human whith their own personal goals.  Even if your not an anime fan you should buy this DVD, because its such an incredibly moving story you dont even realize its animation.
B00003CXFV|5.0|This is the best role Julia has ever protrayed. This movie is all about a woman who is not afraid to stand up for people in need and risk everything for it. Julia Roberts did a spectacualr job of making this woman look strong and determined. It is a story everyone should know and relate to. It builds your confidence and makes you want to stand up for something you believe; to go out and do something good!
B00005J79J|4.0|Hello Sarah Brightman fans.  Today I recieved my copy of 'the very best of 1990/2000 Sarah Brightman'. It really is nice, but definitely not the absolute best. There are a few songs that have got standing ovations when performed live, but did not make it to this collection. The track list is indeed beautiful, but I wish there were tracks like 'LA LUNA', 'WINTER IN JULY' and most inportantly, the Puccini aria 'NESSUN DORMA'.<br />The track list is as goes: 1) A QUESTION OF HONOR part 2 (radio edit)  2)HEAVEN IS HERE  3)WHO WANTS TO LIVE FOREVER  4)TIME TO SAY GOODBYE (with Andrea Bocelli)  5)TU QUIERES VOLVER  6)JUST SHOW ME HOW TO LOVE YOU (with Jose Cura)  7)EDEN  8)NELLA FANTASIA  9)DELIVER ME  10)ONLY AN OCEAN AWAY  11)SCARBOROUGH FAIR  12)A WHITER SHADE OF PALE  13)FIRST OF MAY (studio version)  14)CAPTAIN NEMO (live)  15)LA MER (live)  16)THE LAST WORDS YOU SAID (with Richard Marx)<br />Tracks 14 and 15 are taken from the &quot;One night in Eden&quot; concert. The full length album versions are both found on the 1993 'DIVE' Cd. Both songs would be better in studio version, but are still okay on this collection. TRACK 1, 'A QUESTION OF HONOR part 2' is the shortened version that is found as track #6 on the new remixes CD of 'AWSOP/AQOH. 'Heaven is here' is found on 1995/96's 'FLY' and is a great song that needs lots of airplay.<br />Inside, the booklet shows 2 nice full-page photos from 'Eden' and 'La LUNA' + a fab collage of many faces of Sarah from her different albums. There are a couple of shots of her from The Phantom Of the Opera, but there are no songs from that CD because the collection has been compiled only from 1990 on. Also found inside are the total time for each track and the official web-site for anyone whom still does not have it.<br />The cover is navy blue with shiny silver graphics and writing. The back side of the booklet is a photo of Sarah from the back cover from the 'LA LUNA' disc.<br />The CD is housed in a standard jewel-case with the 'W' insignia from Warner records on the front. This Cd is not an Angel Records release, but an eastwest records release. Maybe someday soon, Angel records will release a similar version with different songs. Until then, this CD makes a nice addition to anyone's Sarah Brightman collection.<br />I hope my review has helped SB customers.ase with the 'W' insignia from Warner records on the front. This Cd is not an Angel Records release, but an eastwest records release. Maybe someday soon, Angel records will release a similar version with different songs. Until then, this CD makes a nice addition to anyone's Sarah Brightman collection.<br />I hope my review has helped SB customers.
6305910324|5.0|it tells a touching story about the struggle for the heart and soul of a child - balancing what's in his best interest with just letting him enjoy being a child.<br />the performances in the film are uniformly wonderful.<br />the script is tight and very subtle in its insights into the dilemmas that most parents and teachers who aren't asleep at the wheel will inevitably face and wrestle with in regards to a gifted child (or any child for that matter).<br />- and i should also note that this is not a film like *ransom* or *the emerald forest* - there's no kidnapping story at the heart of this movie and there are no car chases in the film - just a lot of chess and great acting.  enjoy! :)
B00003CWHS|4.0|Army of Darkness is a bad movie. It's suppose to be. It's the greatest B-movie of all time. Everytime I watch this film I laugh so hard I usually fall over or something. I don't know which version to recomend. The Director's Cut has some extended scenes that are really funny, but the standard video has the alternate ending which is pretty funny too. Just get which ever you can afford, they're both good
B00000JGHM|5.0|this is an INCREDIBLE movie that only gets better with each re-watching.<br />there is so much to take in, so much to pick up on and get to know about so many of the characters, that this film, in my opinion, rewards several re-watchings.<br />Pacino's character is marvelously drawn.  in one of the first scenes in the movie, watching how his character relates with his step-daughter and his (emotionally high maintenance) wife is very well done - the triangling is very interesting.  the scene where he comes home late for dinner after the first crime scene is also fascinating.  and his character's way of sizing people up and getting what he wants out of them is fascinating and memorable (if not a little over the top) - &quot;give me whatcha got,&quot; &quot;you can get killed walking your doggie,&quot; &quot;because she's got a great ---, and you've got your head all the way up it; ferocious, aren't i?&quot;<br />De Niro's character is equally well-drawn.  Ditto Kilmer's, Sizemore's, Judd's, etc., etc.<br />and then there are the actions sequences.  INCREDIBLE!  i think that part of the initial action sequence plays out better on the non widescreen presentation - it allows you to get a closer view of the shocked/traumatized look on one of the guard's faces.<br />the third action sequence - the daylight robbery - to my mind is probably one of the top two or three action sequences EVER.  INTENSE would be an understatement.<br />and i could go on and on.<br />i had no problem with the length.  it served this movie beautifully.<br />and there were not too many subplots in my opinion.<br />the one real problem? - the dvd.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE this movie so deserves a special or collecter's edition (a two disc set? ~ *sigh* ~ dare to dream :) complete with a director's or stars' commentary, some of the deleted or cut down scenes, and a behind the scenes featurette -- hopefully about the daylight robbery shoot out sequence.
B000056WTG|4.0|This is an awsome movie. Most call it the best of the Mad Max movies (I say the 3rd one is) It's got a great plot, lots of super fast action, and memerable characters. There are some disturbing scenes in this film (fingers being severed for example) so be warned<br />The Trailers and the &quot;Making of&quot; footage included on this video are a nice bonus
B00005B36H|5.0|Not everybody is ready for this work of art.  The &quot;listeners&quot; who rate this CD as not very good are just not ready.  Give it a couple or three years and maybe you will get it.  Tool is beyond what you can understand.  You're not there yet but will be.<br />Tool is not for everyone right now.<br />These things take time.
6303471501|3.0|Unless you're a fan of the other Mad Max movies, you might not care for this one. It's pretty good, but it can be confusing at time. The accents can be hard to understand too. On the plus side, the action is intense so this movie's far from boring
B00003CXN3|3.0|This was a decent, well-acted film, yet I find it problematic. First, lets look at the realism of the film: I understand what the filmmakers are getting at, saying no family is immune to the &quot;drug problem&quot; with the Drug Czar's little girl free-basing, and, sure, it's possible, but probable? Not really. Instances such as this, as well as Catherine Zeta Jones taking over her husband's drug business, descend this film into moral allegory but the situations are too Hollywood-ized to take seriously. Sometimes, this is another lame SUBURBANITES, BEWARE! movie. Michael Douglas proves his lameness once again when he doesn't even have enough juevos to get a gun and get his daughter back from the drug dealer. I mean, come on, everything in the film is so fantastic anyways, the one instance where most men would have really gone berserk, he wimps out? Lame. Most men would have gone back with a shotgun and tried to get their daughter whether they were killed or not. Michael Douglas' character, on the other hand, lets this snot-nosed wimpy teenager lecture him on politically correct BS about the ghetto and drug trade while his daughter is hanging out up in the crack house? Whatever. If that was me, I would have beat that punk Seth's face into the ground. Just listening to his drivel made me want to throw up. The other problem I have with this film, a more serious flaw in my opinion, is that, ultimately, all it does is flush out the complexities of the &quot;drug problem&quot; in an overblown, pure Hollywood kind of way. The most telling line of the film is when Michael Douglas says &quot;If we wage a war on drugs, we're waging war on our own families. And I don't see how you can wage war on your own family.&quot;<br />Well, welcome to Adult Land, Michael, I hope you enjoy your stay!<br />Know what? Prosecuting bank robbers, murderers, traffic offenders, rapists and counterfiters also disrupts families!<br />This film doesn't provide any relevant new insight into the drug problem, in my opinion, all it does is snip at the heels of the &quot;establishments&quot; war on drugs and rally against a percieved-white, suburban mindset of naivety. <br />To me, this was like a seventeen year old, bitter white boy's treatise on drugs gone out of control. In the end, it was circular and old material. I don't understand all of the praise. Entertaining, but that's about it.
0316776963|1.0|Sedaris is going to crash and burn when he runs out of the same repetitive boring simpleton (enough adjectives?) stories about his inane family and romps in the world.  This book should be called Barrel Fever 2 or Naked 2 - the sequel.  I'm going to hurl if I read about Amy Sedaris' shenanegans and the simple humor that the world has embraced.  You're better off watching the Brady Bunch for the same kind of knee-slapping humor.  Yawn.
020530902X|5.0|I don't know why, but this is THE must have book for writing.  Any kind of writing.  I should be refering to it in order to write this recomendation.  Read it.  Learn it.  Love it.  Forget it and then run to it when you've forgotten whether you need to use a semi-colon.  Fight over it.  Step on it.  Use it to prop up your dinner table.  But if you don't have it don't bother writing.
0140187537|5.0|To any of you who are considering reading this book, the following points may be helpful:<br />* Of all the Steinbeck novels I've read, I consider this one to be his wittiest, funniest and most intelligent.  The dialogue is great and the main character (Ethan Allen Hawley) may be my favorite Steinbeck character of all-time.<br />* This book focuses on thought rather than plot.  We are taken on detailed journeys through Ethan Hawley's mind (in fact, some of the chapters of this book are written in the first-person rather than the third-person, such that Hawley speaks to us directly).  What we are shown are the motives and means through which a conscientious human being trades a life of good deeds for a life of deception and acquisitiveness, and the result is jarring.<br />* As indicated above, however, this book is NOT plot-driven.  Therefore, some readers may not like it as much as, say, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; or &quot;In Dubious Battle&quot;.  Do yourselves a favor and read the first page or two of the book before buying it.  If you are drawn into the dialogue on these pages, you'll probably love the book - it represents the general tone of the novel throughout, though toward the end the book gets much darker as Ethan's abandonment of his morals and the consequences thereof are driven home to the reader.<br />This truly great novel will stick with the reader long after the last page has been turned.  Read it - I don't think you'll be disappointed.
0802136834|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  It gives a very well rounded picture of the times, the politics, and most of all the people.  Whether you are a knowledgeable Tudor historian or a newcomer to the English court of the 16th century this is an informative, well written, interesting book.  What many other authors have turned into dry and drudging accounts, Alison Weir has made engaging and human.  Since I bought this book 5 or 6 years ago I have probably read it 6 times.   Definitely money well spent.  I just hope Ms. Weir will turn her talents to a book on Lady Jane Grey.
B000056PWV|5.0|It will make your palms sweat, guaranteed.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This album of well chosen and interestingly mixed 'old-timey' country music can make a believer of even the most persistant Classical music lover.  Don't like standard radio country but I sure enjoy its roots, as evidenced in the songs of this album.  Once you listen to it, I challenge you not to hum along, or try not to sing &quot;Let's Go Down to the River and Pray&quot; or &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; for days afterward.
B000001DQI|5.0|This album has incredible staying power after 28 years. First off, most of the songs here are some of John/Taupin's best--not just the hits, but less known stuff like &quot;I've Seen That Movie, Too,&quot; &quot;Roy Rogers,&quot; &quot;Harmony&quot; and &quot;Your Sister Can't Twist.&quot; Second, this is a great ALBUM---the sequencing works perfectly, particularly when the primo songs are placed in such a way as to buoy up some of the lesser material (EXAMPLE: The title track and &quot;Grey Seal&quot; bracket the mediocre &quot;This Song Has No Title&quot; and this helps give that song more bite than it probably would have in a different place in this collection). Finally, it serves to remind people what a great rock musician Elton John was. Hard to believe when you hear his current output, but this guy got down with the best of them, whether in rockers or on ballads (Elton's terrific band with Davey Johnstone on guitar, Nigel Olsson on drums and the late Dee Murray on bass sure helped him, too!). If you want to be reminded that the pre-punk Sevenites really did have their moments of pop music glory, this album will do it!
B000050IE6|5.0|Seems like I could copy and paste reviews for Opeth, because every album is so good. This album and their newest Blackwater Park are similar on many levels, which I am happy about, because both albums are comprised of some of the best music available on planet Earth.<br />Still Life sends you through periods of mid-paced death metal only to fall into beautiful acoustic pieces with clean vocals. It is these kinds of rises and falls that are Opeth's trademark - long, epic songs with lots of acoustics and unbelievable vocals and guitars. Mikael Akerfeldt has to be one of the most, if not the most gifted singer in metal today. He can go from inhuman growls to beautiful clean vocals in an instant. Akerfeldt and guitarist Peter Lindgren lay down some absolutely amazing guitars on this album. Just go buy this.
0451163532|5.0|This is a very well written book. It is an excellent writeup of Ross Perot's daring rescue of his employees from Iran when they were arrested by the Iranians during the revolution. There were some interesting characters in this book. One of the more noteable characters was Bull Simon. This book describes the rescue from start to finish. You will admire the cunning and bravado of the hostages as well as their rescuers. You will also come to admire the raw nerve of H. Ross Perot. You have to remember that this was Iran at it's most dangerous time. You will also become a fan of Ken Follett. Read this book. You will not be dissapointed.
B00003CX95|5.0|Without a doubt, the best movie I have ever seen.  After living in Scotland for a couple of years and visiting the Wallace monument, only a movie like this can depict how horrid the English treated Scotland.  You could say the best part about this movie was revenge.  I say it was the general truth.  FREEDOM!!!!!!!!
B00003CXSP|5.0|I AM SICK AND TIRED OF YOU PEOPLE WHO SAY IT WAS A DISSAPOINTMENT, \\"SILENCE WAS BETTER\\"! I MEAN YOU SOUND LIKE A BUNCH OF ...BABIES  HANNIBAL IS ITS OWN MOVIE, THATS WHY ITS CALLED HANNIBAL!!  ITS NOT SILENCE OF THE LAMBS 2!  AND, \\"OH HE ATE HIS BRAIN THAT WAS SO TRASHY AND WRONG!\\"  ...  IF YOU WANT TO BLAME SOMEONE, BLAME THOMAS HARRIS!  NOT RIDLEY SCOTT.  HE WAS JUST FOLLOWING THE BOOK ....  WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE RATHER HAD HANNIBAL EATING HIS FINGER,  IF HE WOULD HAVE DONE THAT, YOU PEOPLE STILL WOULD OF COMPLAINED, AND YOU WOULD HAVE SAID \\"THATS NOT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BOOK\\"!  AND LEAVE JULIANNE MOORE ALONE, JUST BECAUSE JODIE FOSTER IS TO \\"GOOD\\" FOR THE ROLE, WELL I SAY... HER!  FRANKLY I COULD NOT STAND JODIE, HER ACCENT GOT ON MY NERVES! AND YOU PEOPLE WHO SAY \\"CLARICE'S CHARACTER IS GONE\\" WELL DUH!  SHE HAS BEEN IN THE FBI FOR A DECADE, SHE IS WIPED OUT AND USED TO IT, THE REASON SHE WAS SO FRESH IN SILENCE WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS JUST STARTING OUT.  THATS WHAT TEN YEARS DOES TO A PERSON PEOPLE. LIKE MANY PEOPLE SAY, IT TOOK A LOT OF GUTS TO REPLACE JODIE FOSTER, JULIANNE KNEW THERE WAS GONNA BE PREJUDICES.  BUT SHE DID IT ANYWAY.  I RESPECT HER FOR THAT GREATLY!  JULIANNE IS A VERY TALENTED ACTRESS WHO CAN PULL OFF ANYTHING. AND HANNIBAL WAS STILL KEWL IN THIS ONE.  \\"HE'S NOT SCARY ANYMORE\\"  WELL THE ONLY REASON HE WAS LIKE THAT ON SILENCE WAS BECAUSE HE WAS TRAPPED, IT HAS BEEN A DECADE, HE USED TO BEING FREE! THERE IS NO GLASS ANYMORE! AND I THINK THEY PORTRAYED HANNIBAL'S ATTITUDE VERY WELL. IF YOU NOTICE ON SILENCE WHEN HE IS LISTENING TO THE MUSIC IN HIS BARRED CELL, HE IS LISTENING TO THE SAME MUSIC THAT IS PLAYED IN THE OPENING CREDITS OF HANNIBAL. VERY GOOD TOUCH RIDLEY AND HANS. HANNIBAL IS A VERY GOOD MOVIE.  AND ANOTHER COMPLAINT \\" IT HAS NOT STORY!\\"  YES IT DOES HAVE A STORY, ITS JUST DOESNT ADD ANYTHING NEW, THATS GOOD, ITS JUST A CONTINUATION OF WHAT HAPPEND NEXT,  WOULD YOU HAVE RATHER OF HAD IT LIKE SCREAM AND CLARICE FIND OUT THAT HANNIBAL IS HER LONG LOST BROTHER OR SOMETHING, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RIDICULOUS!  THE MOVIE IS JUST FINE, IT WAS MADE WELL, IT HAD GOOD DIRECTION, GOOD ACTING (ESPECIALLY MOORE AND HOPKINS) AND GOOD MUSIC!  ...
B000002J1I|5.0|My dad got me started on Yes through FRAGILE; from there I bought CLOSE TO THE EDGE...and I was completley hooked. Yes is the greatest band on the earth. TORMATO, while recieving bad hype from critics is one of my favorite albums (I couldn't tell you my favorite album, because I totally love every album I've heard by Yes). I love every song on this album, but I would've bought it just for Release, Release, and Madrigal. Chris Squire's bass work on Release, Release is amazing. I play guitar, bass, drums, keyboard, and I sing. So hearing this album and knowing how hard it would to play the stuff they're busting; its just amazing. If you don't own this, go buy it. Rock is the medium of our generation../
0375703764|5.0|Let me just say one thing to those poor 1-star rating people who got &quot;headaches&quot; trying to read this book. YOU ARE IDOTS! If you aren't intelligent enough to read a 700-page book then don't buy it. I am a 14 year old and I understood this book fine...didn't give me a headache trying to figure it out because I didn't need to. Don't strain your brain, so go check out The Cat In The Hat because it is closer to your reading level. Also, if you are reading this book, you read the WHOLE book. Don't complain because of all the footnotes, they are part of the story! The main story can't exist without the footnotes because it would be a little...dry. The footnotes cat exist without the story b/c it explains what the character of Johnny is feeling and why he feels that why (to a point). So to all of those who whined about the footnotes, YOU MISSED THE WHOLE FREAKING POINT OF THE BOOK!<br />Now with my ranting and raving about the cretins who can't understand this great book done I can get on with my review. I couldn't put down this book, and I still can't. I have re-read it so many times now! It is such a good book, even better the second time around! This is a must read for anyone who likes a twisting, turning, multi-layered plot. Be prepared to read all 700 pages and all the footnotes or you might as well not buy the book! So if you don't think you could last though 700 pages of text with long footnotes, don't bother reading this book and go read something else. For those of you who are still with me, read on. This is essentially a book of a book about a movie. You have the Navidons' story about the house, Zampano's analysis and thoughts of the movie, and Johnny's experiences after reading Zampano's manuscript. It is all multi-layered and maybe a bit too complex for some people but not for me. So if you think you can handle it, enjoy, but a warning to you...BE CAREFUL!

B00005IC2H|5.0|Being a prominent Radiohead fan, I've been hearing a lot of hooplah over this Icelandic sensation.<br />After much prodding, I finally purchased the album (took a bit of searching).  Thank goodness that all of the praise this album has received was justified:  Agaetis Byrjun is easily one of the best alternative/soundscape albums ever.<br />Many others have described the beauty of this album track-by-track, so I won't attempt to do the same.  If you have the cash, be sure to pick this up immediately.
0380002930|5.0|As I looked over our home library I asked my husband &quot;What shall I read now?&quot;  &quot;Try Watership Down&quot; he replied.  I picked it up and began to read.  &quot;Rabbits?&quot; I thought, &quot;I hope this doesn't turn into another Animal Farm&quot;.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  This book has been a wonderful adventure with inner twined legends and incredible character detail.  I haven't put it down for the past five nights.  I find my own heart pounding and my own breath shallow as I read from page to page and wonder how they will ever get out of this predicament.  I recommend this book for anyone who loves a story that will stick with them through out life.  I know it will with me.
B00003CXRP|5.0|This movie is awe inspiring, as well as beutifally put together in a heart-felt tone. This movie creats an emotional feeling throughout and holds it to the end. A great movie to see and to own.
1567184855|5.0|I never knew there was a book like this that laid bare so many fallacies and truths about life after death. It not only answered the questions I had, but explained things that have happened to me that I had no explanation for -- things that I could not discuss with anyone for fear of them thinking I'd lost my mind. This is truly a wonderful, enlightening book. Thank you, Michael Newton, for shedding light on the mysterious life on The Other Side.
B000002UB3|4.0|This was actually the Beatles' last album together, not Let It Be.  So, as splintered as their relationships were at the time, it's a pretty good album.  <br />Just about all the songs on here would rate a \\"B\\" or better.  The exceptions might come on the second side, and they include Polythene Pam, Sun King, and Mean Mr. Mustard, and maybe another.  But it depends your taste, I guess.  Sung King has sort of a laid back, smooth kind of sound, which isn't all that bad, but it can get boring.<br />I think Come Together is a stand out track, as is Because, She's So Heavy, and Oh! Darling.  Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight is a beautiful part of the suite.  The End is just all 4 of them jamming.  Oh Darling is a neat bluesy/rocking song from Paul.  Octopus' Garden by Ringo is a fun sounding song, and Something, by George, is very nice.  John's Because is the remnant of earlier psychedelia, and is an almost mystical sounding tune.<br />As you can tell, each individual's work shines through, but the album still has a coherent sound to it.  Too bad they couldn't just love each other and keep it up.
B00004Z459|5.0|Perfect. It's Limp Bizkit meets Staind a wonderful combo. The lyrics get in your head and won't let you go. The instruments play hard cords but it flows. They even have a piano. :). It's slightly rappie which helps with the rock. The vocalists help with the story of the song. If your contimplating this cd, don't. They bring everything out. Just go out and buy it.
1563890410|4.0|Gaiman takes a look at the nature of Hell in this thought provoking volume of The Sandman series. As Dream enters Hell to correct a heinous act he committed 10,000 years before, Lucifer confronts him. Dream prepared for battle finds instead Lucifer emptying Hell of its denizens and locking the gates. Finally he hands Dream the key to hell. Responsibility, a theme Gaiman often returns to throughout the run of the series, is at the center of this story. Dream is now in possession of what is referred by his sister as \\"the most desirable plot of psychic real estate in the whole order of created things,\\" and now Dream must decide what should be done with it, and there is no shortage of suitors. Throughout the story (particularly in the conversation between Lucifer and Dream) Gaiman makes some excellent points about the nature of Hell and the afterlife. While I truly enjoyed the storyline I had difficulty with the simplicity of the ending, which is literally deus ex machina and the focus on the Christian concept of Hell (Lucifer) that seems to lack the overall worldview that is usually found in Sandman.
B000002LAB|5.0|What more can I say. Miles has once again outdone himself. I just bought this cd and can't seem to stop playing the damn thing. Miles to me is the consumate artist and this collaboration with Mr Miller is nothing short of brilliant. To be honest I have become as big Marcus Miller fan as I am a Miles Davis fan. Marcus brings to this piece just that right texture of funk and soul in a fusion that will make this work a memorable one. Miles' trumpet renditions exonerates the wizardy and majestry that is Miles. George Duke's contribution must not be denied especially on Backyard Ritual. As an up and coming jazz enthusiast i believe this to be one to add to the young jazz listeners collection.
B000023X9W|4.0|Neil Young welcomes you to Silver &amp; Gold right away with \\"Good to See You\\" which sets the tone for the CD.  Beautiful acoustic melodies accompany Young's reflections on love in its various forms; from the beauty of a perfect love (\\"Silver and Gold\\") to the strength of a \\"Razor Love\\" that will cut through any problem. Throughout the CD, Young expresses faith in love's power. Even the songs that don't quite hold the same appeal for me (\\"The Great Divide\\" Horseshoe Man\\") have lines that are memorable. Love is often the focus of popular songs; rarely is it served so well.
B00003CXE7|1.0|Dont buy this garbage. The plot is wire thin, the acting is sub par at it's best moments, the directing is shoddy and the action scenes give the film gore, not merit. very very stupid. the fact that this was even nominated for academy awards makes me extremely angry, and the fact that this thing won awards, and Almost Famous, the true movie of 2001, which had acting and a plot, isn't even nominated INFURIATES me.
0930289234|5.0|There had been other comics that were designed for  mature readers, but Watchmen changed the face of comics forever. Alan Moore originally wanted to use the Charlton heroes (The Question, Blue Beetle Captain Atom) for this series, but when DC saw what was going to be done with the characters they told Moore to make up his own. This dark look at superheroes in a relatively realistic setting creates images and ideas that were new to the medium. It seemed that Moore had decided that comics should grow up, so he used shock therapy to make it happen. The story line of heroes being murdered, which eventually builds to an end of the world scenario, was not totally new but the execution of it was. With Dave Gibbon's clear, concise art and panel placement and Moore's imaginative plotting, the book worked its way to the only ending that was true to its theme, but that ending was gut wrenching nonetheless.
B000053VAF|1.0|This is one of the worst movies ever. I'll say it, flat out, right there. Poor acting, poor script, poor characters, Matt Damon. It had all the elements for a terrible film.<br />The worst part about it all is this is by Kevin Smith, the man who wrote, directed, and starred in 3 of my favorite movies ever, clerks, mallrats, and chasing amy.<br />for those of you who thought mallrats was dumb, you're about to see a new low. demons made of excrement, stripper angels, and hockey demons.<br />not to mention this has some of the poorest and dumbest acting (matt damon, i blame IT ALL on ben's dumb buddy) and worst cameos on film to date.<br />the only good acting is by jason lee who tries his very hardest to pull of a roll of a character similar to the devil, but it just doesn't work with the surroundings, he's too good and everyone else is too subpar.<br />all in all you have an overblown piece of hollywood crap. this was supposed to be a thought provoking movie that was blasphemous and sacriligious with a message, instead it was just alanis morrisette as god.<br />the dialogues are dumb (blame chris rock trying to do his own thing and matt damon for being matt damon). the characters are whiny and annoying. the movie is out of smith's style, and it's just more big budget hollywood stuff, the type of movie he was going to avoid.<br />do not buy the special edition dvd, do not buy the dvd, do not buy the VHS, do not even download the DIVX, i am serious, if you are a smith fan who has yet to see this you are in for the disappointment of your life. 3 years for a new movie and this is what we got, oh well, look for jay and silent bob strikes back this fall.<br />and for an alternative buy smith's previous 3 movies and the clerks cartoon, it's better than this overrated garbage

0345440757|5.0|Would highly recommend this book. Our daughter and son-in-law read the book when their triplets were about three months old. It was incredible, after about 3+ days we all noticed a positive, pretty dramatic change in all three of the babies as we used the various approaches recommended by Tracy Hogg.<br /> Each one of the babies has a different temperament and needs. After reading this book, mom and dad and all 'helpers' were much more effective in meeting the triplets round-the-clock individual needs and 'reading' their unique personalities -- as a result the babies are calm, cry rarely, experience no colic, rarely do they have a &quot;fussy time&quot;, are alert, smiling/sociable, and they are able to self-comfort and put themselves to sleep. By the way, all three babies sleep through the night from about 10:30 PM (a dream feed) until about 5:30 to 6 AM. <br />The babies were born 6 weeks early and now at almost five months weigh in at 19(boy), 17(girl), and 15(girl) pounds respectively. Starting at about 5 days old all babies were given a pacifier and rotated from breast to bottle. (One baby was able to nurse right after birth.) At each feeding our daughter breast feeds two of the babies and one baby is bottled. All babies rotate from breast to bottle throughout the 24-hour day --- so each baby nurses two out of three feedings. Each baby has absolutely no problems shifting from breast to bottle. So much for the dreaded &quot;nipple confusion&quot; concept. Each baby only nurses on one breast as recommended by the author. No problem producing milk --- when our daughter pumps she produces about 8-10 ounces per breast. <br />From now on my favorite baby shower gift will be Secrets of the Baby Whisperer! I thank God for Tracy Hogg and her gentle, common sense, and respectful approach to babies. I would love to meet her. From a happy, calm grandma (ex-Registered Nurse) in Nebraska.
0553277472|5.0|Robert Pirsig has written a book that is standing the test of time. It is both a dramatic and philosophical triumph.<br />Pirsig begins his journey with an observation: his traveling companions, John and Sylvia, are strangely alienated from the technological world from which they derive so much benefit. John will not even consider maintaining his own motorcycle. Many Americans are just like them. Why?<br />Pirsig traces the answer to the Greeks, specifically Plato and Aristotle who, he argues, conceived a system of thought in which beauty is severed from functionality (as if the engine of the motorcycle is somehow disconnected from the shiny chrome machine we see on the highway.) Functionality or \\"classic\\" thought became less attractive to us than \\"romantic\\" thought or beauty. Plato and Aristotle, Pirsig argues, committed a murder that their adherents have covered up ever since. The victim was quality.<br />That is the philosophical issue in a nutshell. The story's high drama revolves around Pirsig's rediscovery of \\"Phaedrus,\\" the person he had been before his manic exploration of quality literally drove him mad. One of the book's powerful ironies is that the deeper the protagonist digs into his forgotten past, the stronger his identification with the persona of Phaedrus and the more he isolates himself from Chris, who is frightened by his father's deep silences and the \\"return\\" of Phaedrus' ghost. In short, his very attempt to tear down the divide between quality and our lives diminished the quality of his relationship with his son, at least for a time. <br />The larger issue remains: to the extent that an appreciation for quality does not inform our lives, we are less understanding, less excellent, less civilized and more alienated from ourselves and our neighbors. Viewed this way, the absence of quality is the absence of God.<br />When Pirsig applies this critique to modern-day culture, he strikes familiar yet disturbing chords. Pirsig describes &quot;primary&quot; culture as the mass-produced television shows, pop music, consumer goods and products that in superficial ways bind us together. The more we embrace this &quot;primary&quot; culture, the less we are involved in the real communities around us and the lonelier we become. Pirsig contrasted the loneliness he experienced in urban, crowded environments with the peace he felt when riding his motorcycle through the open fields of the Midwest.<br />&quot;The explanation, I suppose, is that the physical distance between people has nothing to do with loneliness. It's psychic distance, and in Montana and Idaho the physical distances are big but the psychic distances between people are small.&quot;<br />   He continues: &quot;I think if we are going to reform the world, and make it a better place to live in, the way to do it is not with talk about relationships of a political nature, which are inevitably dualistic, full of subjects and objects and their relationship to one another; or with programs full of things for other people to do.... The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head and hands, and then work outward from there. Other people can talk about how to expand the destiny of mankind. I just want to talk about how to fix a motorcycle. I think what I have to say has more lasting value.&quot;<br />Today, we take discussion of quality for granted: Total Quality Management, the Pursuit of Excellence, Synchronicity -- an entire genre of business and spiritual literature revolves around the concept. Tom Peters, Steven Covey, Peter Senge and Max DePree are among the management gurus who circle the globe to engage in &quot;quality&quot; talk. If we have not fully digested Pirsig's critique, we have at least acknowledged the premise of his argument -- a culture that quits caring will not long endure, economically or spiritually.
B00005221L|3.0|Excuse my broken English ;-)--I was wondering to see this ultimate movie.So i spent my money for DVD which should be  best in picture and sound.So i put in and enjoying Arnie and his group in action.And now why i was dissapointed.First quality of picture(but i excused it-old movie),sound is not bad.Whole movie is shorted  :-( grr.Example :scene in village,Arnie stick man to the pale-missing.Waiting around the trap.Mac is shaving(missing).Action scenes shorted. Guerillas not fall from nests, flying in the air and not burning. There are no red analizers(predators voice)on the sides(which where in red color-VHS).I thought that DVD version will be longer than on VHS.I expected some more specials.If i would know that i would buy VHS.Im giving 3, :-(.If I am wrong let me know....
6304057709|5.0|I just finished watching this movie for the fourth time and I loved it just as much as always.  This is truly a brilliant film and adaptation of the novel. Emma Thompson did such a swell job as Miss Dashwood that I cry every time I watch! She is so talented and I can't say enough about this film. The story is of course so very romantic and even comical and the way the cast portrays each character is simply wonderful.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone as it would be a shame to miss out on such a fine performance.  I know I will watch this movie again in coming years.  It's a classic.
B000000W6F|4.0|While not as grand or sweeping as it's follow-up records,&quot;Gish&quot; is astoundingly concise and assured,especially for a debut.Producer Butch Vig(Nirvana) helms the boards for this one,resulting in the toughest,most traditonally &quot;Rock&quot; sounding album of SP's repatiore.The opener &quot;I Am One&quot; sets the tone for the rest of the album:drummer Jimmy Chamberlain's awesomely kinetic beat,the elegant grind of vocalist Billy Corgan and guitarist James Iha's melodies,and the forward surge of D'arcy's bass.Technically speaking,the Pumpkin's didn't really invent any sort of new sound on this album,they just hammered and chisled away at established forms of guitar-based,vaguely psychedelic rock music,melting it down into so much sonic raw material for them to reconstruct in thier own gnarled,yet always immaculately wrought vision.Add to that head Pumpkin Billy Corgan's undeniable knack for shatteringly intimate confessinal sonwriting that somehow resonates as anthems for the dispossesed,and you've got the blueprint for a new type of mega-band,one that repays obsessive fan devotion with a consistant quality and utterly unique sound and vision.On timeless &quot;Gish&quot; tracks like the beautifully yearning ballad &quot;Rhinosceros&quot;,the mind-melting neo-psychedelic jam &quot;Siva&quot;,and the dense but understated forboding of &quot;Suffer&quot;(later sampled by Tricky),they establish that modus oparandi in no uncertain terms.
0440180295|5.0|Listen:<BR> Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five is really something else. I have to admit this is one of the few books where I saw the movie first (years ago), and about 3 years ago, I decided to read the novel. Left a deep impact on me, although I had a hard time understanding it.<BR> So a couple of months ago I saw the movie again, loved it again (although I normally detest movies done after books), and then decided to read all of Vonnegut's novels and shortstories, and chronologically this time, starting out with the promising Player Piano.<BR> Now I reread Slaughterhouse Five, and so far it is Vonnegut's best book. It is clearly an attempt to describe his impressions in World War Two and especially Dresden, but instead of writing a realistic novel about war, Vonnegut 'invents' a totally non-linear genre of science fiction that is absolutely unique in its scope.<BR> There is no suspense at all, because the novel's main character (not to call him hero) Billy Pilgrim is unstuck in time, which means he travels back and forth in time. We meet a young Pilgrim traumatized by his gun-loving father, a Pilgrim lost in World War Two, a Pilgrim married to the obese daughter of a rich John Birch Society nutcase and above all a happy Pilgrim living on Tralfamadore, a planet in a faraway solar system. All this is narrated in no particular order, and maybe the book needs to be read twice to get its scope, but it is worth it.<BR> Vonnegut's style also reaches a level that I haven't seen of him in the past, very bitter-sarcastic-loving-sweet... all at once. Every death is followed by a shrugged &quot;So it goes.&quot;, and paragraphes are often introduced with &quot;Listen:&quot;. In a heartwarming sad tale, Vonnegut tells us not only of the senselessness of war (where there are no crooks, just victims), but also teaches the reader a valuable moral: focus on the positive moments of your life.<BR> Then there are some characters which avid Vonnegut fans will love to see back: wretched sci-fi writer Kilgore Trout, millionaire Eliot Rosewater and American nazi Howard Campbell jr. Plus two goofs: the border between Luxembourg and Germany is a valley, not a hill, and people with an IQ of 103 are of average intelligence, not morons.<BR> Read this book though.<BR> Poo-tee-weet?
B000002J2D|4.0|As befitting the dusky,neo-noir cover photo,this album represents a shift into an altogether different feel and mood for the band.Gone are the grand,Rennaissanse-faire set-pieces and absurdist British musings,in favor of more understated meloncholy and transportive stadium rockers.The songwriting influence of Phil Collins is writ large in the moody introspection of &quot;Many Too Many&quot; and &quot;Undertow&quot;,while &quot;Deep In The MOtherlode&quot;and &quot;Burning Rope&quot; showcase a new,more focesed and muscular ensamble sound.There is a quite evocative and atmospheric feel to this record,and to me it stands out in thier catalogue,it doesn't really feel like any of thier other records,and it shows that this group was far from running out of ideas or inspiration.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I have a couple words of advice: DO NOT WAIT FOR THE VIDEO!! This movie can only be fully appreciated and enjoyed on the big screen. It is sincere, spectacular.... and alltogether beautiful. Everything impressed me: the music, scenery, special effects, editing, music, and acting. When you finish seeing the movie, you will say, &quot;Huh? It's over already?!&quot; Go see it!
B000002J2F|4.0|This is Genesis fully immersed in the mainstream,it's biggest seller by far up to that point and also where Phil Collins became the primary songwriting force.Along with solid mid-tempo FM rockers (&quot;Turn it ON Again&quot;,&quot;Misunderstanding&quot;)there's also good examples of the moody meloncholia the band had become fairly good at by this time,&quot;Guide Vocal&quot;,and &quot;Heathaze&quot;.There's also the big instrumental closer the band continued to employ with &quot;Duke's Travels/Duke's End&quot;.This album may be a bit hard for Gabriel era Genesis fans to swallow,but the remaining members made it clear they had moved on for good,and longtime fans would be wise to give this later stuff a chance.
B00000G6FN|3.0|I wrote back in March that this set was very good (and it is to a point) but time limitations or no time limitations, any DEEP PURPLE compilation without &quot;SPACE TRUCKIN'&quot; is a JOKE.  The idea that someone could sit there and say &quot;Yeah, we'll include *TED THE MECHANIC*(from the &quot;Perpendicular&quot; lp) over SPACE TRUCKIN' to represent &quot;The *VERY BEST* of Deep Purple&quot; is ridiculous to me.  They should've just titled this collection:  &quot;An Overview.&quot;  Because without the classic (..really, a *perfect* song that defined 70's hard rock) &quot;SPACE TRUCKIN'&quot; this collection CAN NOT be truely be called *The very best of*
0790731479|5.0|Best not to analyize or explian this film.It's best to just sit back and let Tim Burton's wacked-out,visionary,hysterical gumbo wash over you,and just revel in the sheer,insane energy of it all.It's one of those rare films that has an anarchic,subversive mischief at it's core,yet is also very sweet,and well,just plain lovable.It's great for kids(despite one little wordy-dird),but isn't even remotely cloying or pandering.(Even the cartoon series based on it is not that bad).Coming on the heels of the equally brilliant &quot;Pee-Wee's Big Adventure&quot;,this film firmly established Mr.Burton as one of the best new film-makers around,and remains a great achievement.
0944379044|1.0|This is the book that was the most influential in causing the Holocaust. I hated the book so much and all the remembrance of the Holocaust came to me when I was reading it (Schlinder's Lists, etc.) that I was not up to finishing it. The book is terribly long and coping with such a dose of raw hate was too much for me. Its anti-Semitic arguments are still powerful, even though weaker than 80 years ago...I would recommend that only Jews or philo-Semites read this book, others may be swayed away, seduced by many classical anti-Semitic arguments (the alleged ethnicity of the first communists and the communist takeover in Russia, concerning financial and media power, etc.) And one Holocaust is enough.
B000002J2B|4.0|Preceeding yet another line-up change(Steve Hackett left after this record),and a noticable shift towards the mainstream,this overlooked album certainly contains some worthy &quot;Prog&quot; era Genesis material.The opener &quot;Eleventh Earl Of Mar&quot;,and &quot;One For The Vine&quot;,especially,are as over the top and adventurous as anything they'd ever done.&quot;Blood On The Rooftops&quot;,georgeous and sweeping,is also noticable for the fine classical-style guitar intro from Hackett.Some songs are outright clunkers however(I won't name names,you'll probably pick them out immediately)proving that they were probably right in deciding to move on to more accessible music.
B0000508U6|5.0|When I first heard the song Yellow on the radio, I was very taken by it.  I decided that the CD Parachutes was worth my time and money.  After purchusing it, I was shocked and delighted to find that many of the songs had a more dramatic sound to them than Yellow.  I found that, though they had a sound similar to Radiohead in some instances, they were a very unique band indeed.    Many of the songs take you on a journey far beyond where you are, as you listen to the CD.  I expecially enjoy Sparks hauntingly gorgeous melody, and the lovely lyrics.   Spies is another of my favorites.  As you listen to it, you can feel the emotion and feeling in the singer's voice.  I find it to be an extrodinarily resplendent song.    Never, in all my life, have I heard such mind-blowing, beautiful music.      I believe this CD is well worth your money.
0790730960|5.0|Let me explain.This is most likely pure,undiluted conjecture on my part,but I get the feeling that some of the dodgier elements of the first &quot;Batman&quot; film were due to studio interference:the tentative nature of the Joker,the weak leading lady(nothing against Kim Basinger at all,she just doesn't belong in a Burton film)and the contrived romance between Vicky Vale and Bruce Wayne.Bruce is a character who would be drawn to more than looks,and unfortunately that's all Vale's character offers.And let's just mention Robert Wuhl.All this seemed to be the studios way of taking Burton's original vision,which was probably much darker and more caustic,and making it more palatable to a summer audience.And if my estimation of Burton as an artist is accurate,he probably bristles fiercely at such interference.And so we have,&quot;Batman Returns&quot;,which retains the florid atmosphere of the first one,all grand,decaying Gothic austerity offset with fun-house thrills,and completely buries all sense of compromise(having a film become one of the biggest money-makers of all time gives you that privelege).Opening with a smashingly designed and executed sequence,we see the origins of the Penguin,(Danny DeVito)from his birth to wealthy parents,who leave him floating in the sewer because of his grotesque deformaties.The scene is as sad and haunting as any in Burton's work.Next we meet Max Shreck,played to absolute perfection by Christopher Walken,a shady business Tycoon,who has Gotham City wrapped around his evil little finger.His assistant,Selina Kyle,(Michelle Pfieffer)who when we first meet her is a mousy wallflower,is in on his shady dealings,involving a scheme to monopolize Gotham's power supply.He finds out she's on to him,and pushes her out a window,ostensibly killing her.But she survives,having been &quot;rescued&quot; by a horde of stray cats.But there's something decidedly different about her as she goes home and transforms her self into the Catwoman.Pfieffer is a righteous,fired-up marvel as the sexy,lethal Catwoman,and she seems to have a ball,finding the wounded pride and swaggering confidence of the character.It's a grand,unforgettable performance.Pfieffer certainly makes a much more convincing love interest for Bruce Wayne(Micheal Keaton,once again).She meets him as Salina,but he immedeately notices her dark side.Thier conversation at his manor is pure gold.When the talk turns to former girlfriends,he mentions Vicky Vale.Selina:&quot;Vicky? Ice-Skater or stewardess?&quot;Perfect.As far as the Penquin,well he's one of the most delightfully odeous creations in the history of cinema,with pale,clammy skin,rotten teeth,malformed body,and Danny DeVito ripping into the character with abrasive vigor.He adopts a plan to win over the Gotham citizens,to gain thier trust,so he can get revenge for what his parents did to him.I won't give it away,but's brilliantly dark and twisted.&quot;Batman Returns&quot; is an awesome accomplishment,and everything the first one could have been.I recommend the first one anyway,if only to let it's flaws make you appreciate much more the perfection of this one.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I wasn't gonna do it. I refused to write a review for this album. Why? There's already 335 of em. Do we really need another view on it? No. Do I really care? Of course not. I like Radiohead. I truly like Amnesiac. It's a fantastic album with no duds. I truly enjoy listening to it. And it's great music. Herein lies the question and point of my review: Is Radiohead a group of musicians making good music or are they brilliant people making amazing art that only a few cerebrally gifted truly understand. I believe the latter is agreed upon by the Spin devoted masses and the former is my belief and, I hope, the belief of others. People, will you please quit pouring over the lyrics and liner notes in an effort to understand this tangled mass? Sit back and feel the pulsating beat of Sardines and Spinning Plates, hear the John Lee Hooker slide play in I Might Be Wrong, and try to enjoy the moment of Pyramid Song. These guys just wanna have fun. Let em have fun and quit turning them into the Camus', Dostoevsky's, and Kafka's that they aren't. This album is great. Will it brighten an hour of your life? Yes. Will it brighten your night? Probably. Will it make your day? Maybe. Will it change your life? Probably not. Will it make you smile? A resounding yes is uttered from the small contingency in the cheap seats.
B000002J27|3.0|This is the first album after Peter Gabriel was replaced by Phil Collins,with predictably mixed results:on the one hand,the band musically is as sharp as ever,retaining thier knack for sweeping,baroque arrangements(&quot;Dance On A Volcano&quot;,&quot;Mad Man Moon&quot;),while acheiving an unprescedented fluidity and forward momentum on tracks like &quot;Entangled&quot; and the instrumental section of &quot;Ripples&quot;.On the other hand,the lyrics suffer greatly without Gabriel's trademark wit and theatrical flair,coming off as a bit second-hand and rote.Collins,for his part,holds his own in the vocal department,ably keeping up with the multi-octive demands of the material.His vocals are especially pretty on &quot;Ripples&quot; and &quot;Entangled&quot;.Neither the disaster longtime fans feared,nor the triumph they hoped for,&quot;A Trick Of The Tail&quot; is simply a faily solid transitional album.
B000059QY2|5.0|This is a magnificent opera-movie version of Verdi's Rigoletto filmed on location.  With Pavarotti as the lecherous Duke, Wixell as the hump-backed jester, and Gruberova as his pure and innocent daughter, this Rigoletto packs a punch.  The singing is a delight throughout, as are the costumes, sets, and playing of the Wiener Philharmonker.  If you're &quot;opera curious&quot; this would be an ideal place to start exploring this fascinating genre. While Pavarotti is known for his magnificent singing but stiff acting, in this production, he gives a terrific portrayal of the Duke. The ending with Rigoletto and his dying daughter is magnificent and beautifully and poignantly done.  No matter how familiar you may be with this opera, it will seize your heart strings. The DVD visual and sound quality are superb. I hope more operatic works such as this will again see the light of day on DVD--this is the perfect medium for opera, the next best thing to being at the opera!
B00000DGUG|5.0|I fist listened to this cd and totally hated it.  I wanted to throw it away.  That was 1998. Recently, I was in the middle of a break up with a long time lover and decided to take off to the cottage to recover from my overwhelming heartbreak.  This cd was in my bag for some reason and I listened to it. Over the next few days I started to appreciate the songs that played constantly.  The songs gave me confort in a time of sorrow and dispair.  In the song &quot;That I would be good&quot; She asked herself a poignant question, &quot;that I would be good either with or without you&quot;. I just wanted to sink in my sorrows and cry.  This album gave me insightful things to think about.  Another song that helped me was the enigmatic &quot;One&quot;.  The line, &quot;did you just call her amazing, surely we both can't be amazing!&quot; those words were compelling, it was exactly what I was feeling at the time. The next song was &quot;I was hoping&quot; her lyrics are so insightful and it helped me get my mind off my feelings of emptiness.  Then &quot;Joining you&quot; made me think of life and death, it's a song about her friend wanting to commit suicide.  Very intuitive. All in all this album will grow on you.  Just give it a chance like I did. The album will come through for you.
6300274195|5.0|This is one of Disney's true enduring classics.  The story is simple.  A baby elephant is delivered to the delighted Mrs. Jumbo, but he has big ears.  Dubbed Dumbo, he is soon separated from his mother and must find a way to deal with his ears on his own.  With only Timothy Mouse to help him, he soon learns that, thanks to his big ears, he can fly.<br />I have always loved this movie.  The story is simple, but moves quickly and from heart felt emotion to laughter easily.  The moral is simple, but isn't preachy.  Watching this movie again recently, I was surprised again at how much of the early story to told in song.  I usually forget &quot;Look out for Mr. Stork&quot; and the song they sing as they build the circus in the rain when thinking about the classic songs.  &quot;Baby Mine&quot; is one of my favorite Disney songs because of its heartfelt emotion and I love all the puns in &quot;When I See an Elephant Fly.&quot;<br />This is a truly remarkable movie.  Pop some corn, sit back, and joy this classic tale.
B00000IQW3|5.0|...I see that the price has been brought into line with similar offers.  Not sure if a new release or just new pricing, but I've placed my order!...<br />I really did enjoy this movie and would recommend it to anyone interested in sci-fi or action genres. Also the trailer park boy saves universe theme is well done with Alex's grand entrance back into the trailer park positively a blast!<br />BUT - I just wonder why this DVD is so costly? It is priced entirely out of line with others having similar features. This isn't a good trend and has so far stopped me from buying it.
B000002ADT|5.0|this is a ver great cd!! they all make it seem so easy, the way the play, almost as its not diffucult at all for them to play what they play. i have the transcriptions, for every instruments, in the album, from every song, and i sat home in my room, and just followed them, and some of the stuff, if so hard, but they make it look at seem so easy! greta musicians! if u love music not just jazz pick it up!
0679720200|5.0|A guy is determined to live an honest life and express his thoughts to the world.  Because he does not lie at a trial for a murder he committed in self defence he is sentenced to death.  Moral: if you choose not to engage in the elaborate game playing that is social life you will be .. punished.  This book is generally praised for its presentation of philosophical issues and I like this dimenson too, but for me, it is the beautiful, sensorous depiction of a man focussed on each moment of life as it unfolds.  Powerful and beautiful and written by a searing intellect.
0671027344|5.0|when i first read this book ( out of 5 times) i was in love with the character Charlie. He is exactly like me and i can relate to the whole book. That Book taught me and showed me a whole new world of sex drugs and rock and roll and what exactly it can do to a teenager. Everyone teenager needs someone to look up too, and someone to realte too when they think no one is out there. Great book.
0783235666|3.0|Any film by Hitchcock has wonderful moments, and some from this movie are unforgettable, like the huge flock of crows slowly gathering in the playground behind Tippi Hedren, as she unsuspectingly smokes a cigarette.  The ending reminded me of &quot;Notorious,&quot; when Ingrid Bergman escapes from her would-be killers, right in front of their eyes, down a seemingly endless staircase.  Here, Hitchcock manages to make the short walk from the house to the car seem ten miles long.  But then, the movie just ends, and my reaction was, &quot;That's IT? No resolution, no explanation at all?&quot;<br />I understand why Hitchcock did that, of course.  He wanted to suggest that when nature turns on humans, there is no neat explanation for it.  He hints that the birds are taking revenge for what humans have done to nature (you just can't miss that moment in the restaurant when the waitress shouts out an order for &quot;three southern-fried chickens.&quot;)  But why is Tippi Hedren's arrival the catalyst, and why does she seem to be the jinx that brings the plague?  Because she brought two caged love-birds as a gift?  But she doesn't mistreat them, and they seem perfectly happy.  I loved the way Hitchcock used the shots of those exquisite love-birds as &quot;beauty relief,&quot; so to speak, after the shots of the attacks by gulls and crows.<br />Still, the truth is that nature isn't that mysterious.  When animals attack people, there's usually a reason for it.  Birds will buzz you if you get too close to their nests, or seem to attack them.  Earthquakes and storms happen because of the laws of physics, not the wrath of the storm-gods.  And one of the incidents that inspired this movie happened, as it turned out, because a flock of gulls had been poisoned by contaminated fish.  The sick birds blundered around a town for a week or so, flying into things and throwing up on lawns.  Scary, horrifying and mysterious at the time, but there was a reason for it.  Maybe I'm too literal-minded, but I think Hitchcock's best films are the ones in which even the most macabre events make sense.
B00005B36H|5.0|When I first got this cd at warehouse music, and I listened to it all the way through I thought &quot;tool has done it again, they've proven they were god again&quot;...Lateralus is truly genius, it's not as good as Aenima and I don't think they tried to make it better than Aenima, they tried to make it different from the other albums and they succeeded big time, this album is great...even though the tracks that aren't anything but noise are kinda annoying, they add a atmospheric sound to the album and it goes well with it's following tracks like &quot;the patient&quot; and &quot;schism&quot;...&quot;parabol&quot; leads into &quot;parabola&quot; which makes them sound like one track all together. And &quot;ticks &amp; leeches&quot; is the perfect revenge song which goes &quot;is this what you wanted, is this what you had in mind, cause this is what you're getting, I hope you're choking, I hope you choke on this&quot;...buying tool's new album &quot;Lateralus&quot; is worth the money you pay for it, it's perfect.
B000002GQE|5.0|&quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; is considered a concept album, in that it eulogizes the various parts of the day from a timely musical standpoint. There is a bit of that Moody Blues rock sound displayed here, which is cleverly camouflaged against the orchestral stylings provided in grand fashion by &quot;The London Festival Orchestra&quot; - conducted by Peter Knight. &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; begins and ends with a nice, very British vocal passage, voiced by the Moodys' lead singer, Justin Hayward, whose vocalization serves as the perfect compliment to the orchestral passages displayed throughout this &quot;Digitally Remastered&quot; CD, which is truly a delight to the ears. The stuff displayed between the intro and outro vocal passages is prime stuff, which, as I said, captures the subleties of each part of the day with great musical precision. &quot;THE DAY BEGINS&quot; and &quot;DAWN: Dawn Is A Feeling&quot; blossom rather nicely, while &quot;THE MORNING: Another Morning&quot; moves through this day quite briskly. Before you know it, it's time for a lunch break, which begins in the calming, then breaks out with a vengeful fury in the peak hour, thus you have &quot;LUNCH BREAK: Peak Hour&quot;. &quot;THE AFTERNOON&quot; is now upon us, which prompts Justin Hayward to break out with a pleasant vocal set against a lush, orchestral waterfall, which is the setting for the subtitle a) Forever Afternoon. The orchestration sets the musical tone for the macabre b) subtitle &quot;(Evening) Time To Get Away&quot;. It is now later in the &quot;EVENING&quot;, and subtitle a) &quot;The Sunset&quot; is the perfect musical &quot;cool down&quot; right before the subtitle b) &quot;Twilight Time&quot;. Finally, the dark of &quot;THE NIGHT: Nights In White Satin&quot; has now reached its glorious end, as the now died down &quot;echo&quot; of the orchestration senses it is &quot;nighty-night&quot; time, complete with a Justin Hayward bedtime story, titled &quot;The Gathering Gloom&quot;. Ah, but as they say: &quot;All's Well That Ends Well&quot;, as we end one of the last chapters of the all orchestral, &quot;pre-prog&quot; Moody Blues era, as they would begin to hone their progressive musical skills as time passed with each album, although The Moodys did continue to infuse the orchestral sounds into their rock 'n roll landscape, particularly in later albums, such as &quot;Long Distance Voyager&quot;, among others. After listening to this CD, it is clearly evident where the musical influences of various progressive groups, such as Genesis (the Peter Gabriel years) and Emerson, Lake and Palmer, came from. In fact, Genesis' first album, &quot;From Genesis To Revelation&quot;, sounds a lot like &quot;DOFP&quot;, and is modeled after it. Although &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; is primarily suited for the classical music lover, those who are into the classic rock sound of the late '60's, a la &quot;The Bee Gees&quot;, et. al., will derive some pleasure from it, as well. But, be warned, &quot;DOFP&quot; isn't exactly for the &quot;pure&quot; rock 'n roll fan, nor is it for the &quot;pure&quot; classical music afficianado, but is for the true universal music lover. So, if you are only into the Moodys' later, more progressive-oriented efforts, you might find &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; a bit hard to swallow. But, if you are a die-hard fan of this supergroup, and you don't have this title in your CD collection, GET IT, PRONTO!!!ng Gloom&quot;.

But, be warned, &quot;DOFP&quot; isn't exactly for the &quot;pure&quot; rock 'n roll fan, nor is it for the &quot;pure&quot; classical music afficianado, but is for the true universal music lover. So, if you are only into the Moodys' later, more progressive-oriented efforts, you might find &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; a bit hard to swallow. But, if you are a die-hard fan of this supergroup, and you don't have this title in your CD collection, GET IT, PRONTO!!!
B00005J6UP|5.0|Like many before me, I grew up with The Goonies. I ran around my house as a young one, trying to act like Mouth, or doing the Truffle Shuffle to entertain friends (I lacked on the truffle, but I could do the shuffle). <br /> The Goonies holds something that every kid should find magical, even though the only magic in the movie is the magic of friendship. Steven Spielberg wrote the story about a group of friends who are about to lose their houses so a country club can be built where they leave. They come upon a treasure map that supposedly has a legend behind it, and leads to a great treasure. Mikey and his colorful bunch of friends set up to go in search of the treasure not knowing the villianist trio, the Fratellis, are also out for the treasure. Along the way, chaos ensues, friendships go stronger, and they meet a creature who has nothing but love to share and Baby Ruths to eat. <br /> The characters are all likable . . . are all lovable, and the actors who portray them made them all that they were. The Fratellis are even, in some ways, likable throughout the movie, but in the end, they get what they were asking for. The directing, of course, is awesome. None like it actually. And the sets are amazing. Especially the pirate ship set. That was too awesome, and enough to satisfy any adventure lover.<br /> The DVD should satisfy any Goonies fan with the word of all the extras to be on it. And I'm ready to see the infamous deleted octopus scene. I hope it's on there. I believe I read somewhere that some of the cast had gotten together to do a commentary. Now there's wishful hoping that that did happen! <br /> &quot;SLOTH LOVE CHUNK!&quot; And Josh loves this movie.
B000002GBK|5.0|Question: What do you get when you combine classical music with a Victorian edge and progressive rock? Why, you get one of the most brilliant pieces of musical geniusness ever put on record! The result is &quot;The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table&quot;, by one of (progressive) rock's most gifted keyboardists - Rick Wakeman. A rather quaint, well versed British-esque narrative sets the tone of &quot;Arthur&quot; in grand fashion. The rather brief &quot;Lady Of The Lake&quot;, the lengthy &quot;Merlin The Magician&quot; and the timely adequate &quot;Sir Galahad, all display the same introductory Victorian choir chant and piano stylings. &quot;Guinevere&quot;, &quot;Sir Lancelot And The Black Knight&quot; and &quot;The Last Battle&quot; each display a unique pattern of progressivism, which is a perfect compliment to the Victorian-styled classical music and Shakespearean themes etched throughout this CD. If you like these four titles by Genesis: &quot;Trespass&quot;, &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot;, &quot;Selling England By The Pound&quot; and &quot;A Trick Of The Tail&quot;, then you'll most likely enjoy &quot;Myths and Legends...&quot; Of the four above mentioned titles, &quot;Selling England&quot; would make the best companion CD to &quot;Myths&quot;, due to its' very British lyrical and musical nature. The shock value of &quot;Myths&quot; will be surprising to many Yes fans, because the progressive chords featured on it don't sound anything like the typically progressive instincts provided by Yes, of which Rick Wakeman was a member during the early and late '70's, and also during the early '90's on the group's '91 release &quot;Union&quot;. Also, another perfect companion CD to &quot;Myths&quot; would be the Yes solo compilation title &quot;Affirmative: The Yes Solo Family Album&quot;, which features two Wakeman tracks, the above mentioned &quot;Merlin The Magician&quot; and &quot;Catherine Howard&quot;, with the latter track also featured on another of Rick's solo efforts, titled &quot;The Six Wives Of Henry VIII&quot;. &quot;The musical theme of &quot;Catherine Howard&quot; would have fit in with the other songs on &quot;Myths and Legends..&quot; as well. Since it is very rare to hear such exceptional musical genius really shine through on &quot;Myths&quot;, by no means should any hardcore fan of progressive rock, or in some cases, classical music, be without this title in their must have CD collection(s). A rare find, to say the least.red on another of Rick's solo efforts, titled &quot;The Six Wives Of Henry VIII&quot;. &quot;The musical theme of &quot;Catherine Howard&quot; would have fit in with the other songs on &quot;Myths and Legends..&quot; as well.

0440219078|5.0|AT first I thought the book would be very boring, like most you have to read in school, but as I got father in the story I started to become interested in it.....it is so confuzing, but so powerful, I like the symblolism Like the main character being Johnas and how the old story of Johnas being trappend in the whale.....and Gabrial the baby and Gaberial the angel.....I would recommend this to anybody
B00004XONN|4.0|But then again, if you're looking for such a thing I'm not sure Radiohead really wants you to be listening any more.  I just saw Radiohead perform last week and it was interesting to see a sold-out audience react with such passion to music that on the surface appears to be so dispassionate.  Repeated listenings to this album, however, bring forth a lot of buried emotion and some standard verse-chorus-verse tracks presented in a new tableau (Optimistic).  If you want an album of guitar pop, stick to Guided By Voices.  Kid A begs for headphones, a dark room, and an immersion tank.  If you lack the tank, make do as you know best.
0792140346|4.0|Although Primal Fear can be slow moving at times, because of the many court scenes...it is an amazing movie.  Edward Norton is a wonderful actor, and fully represents this within the movie.  It is amazing how his character develops from the beginning of the movie to the end.  And what amazes me even more is how he plays a stuttering preacher boy, and later on plays a nazi full of hate a few years later in American History X.  Primal Fear is a must see movie!  Norton and Richard Gere develop true chemistry through out the entire movie. And although the movie is slow moving, the ending leaves you speechless and wanting more.
B000002UB6|5.0|The Beatles Rule, period. I was shocked to read some reviews in here, where people actually recommended the &quot;red&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; albums, over the original releases???????? Jeez, c'mon!!!!! That's kind of like telling someone to buy Miles Davis's Greatest Hits, over his original albums. In my opinion, anybody that would buy a &quot;hits&quot; album of a group or artist with such a deep and inspirational legacy of work, is missing out on a lot. Buy the album, rent the video, and LEARN.
B00003CXDZ|4.0|If you love musical, this is a must see movie.  A bit too fast and confusing at some point.  It's one of the best musical I've ever seen.  I don't really like Nicole Kidman's movie but I love this one.  Ewan McGregory sang so well.  It's very entertaining.
B000003TA4|5.0|Being a 40+ year old music fan, I was one of the few people I knew my age, who LOVED Nirvana. Being a BIG Beatles fan, I can honestly say, that NO band inspired or touched me like the Beatles, until Nirvana came along. Nirvana were the closest to being &quot;the next Beatles&quot; of any band I can think of in history. That alone, makes them command respect. And YES, I think that Kurt Cobain was the John Lennon of the 90's.
B00000K2W1|4.0|If you only own one Janis Joplin CD then this is the one to own.    This album was first released in 1973, three years after Joplin's death.  It may include her &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; but certainly not all of her best songs. If you are just discovering Janis Joplin, for the first time, this is the place to start.
B000003TAR|5.0|I loved Nirvana. They were great. The saddest thing besides Kurt Cobain killing himself, was seeing Dave Grohl pack up the drums, for his band Foo Fighters.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|After seeing the movie twice, I knew I had to own the soundtrack.  It would have been nice to have &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and the other songs that didn't make it onto the cd, but I got what I really wanted - Ewan McGregor singing.  I'm a long-time fan, so I knew he had talent, but I'm totally blown away.  If there's a recording contract in the near future, I wouldn't be surprised.
020530902X|5.0|Strunk &amp; White was a gift to me from my philosophy professor.  I read it immediately and the knowledge I had gained from the book is impressive-I only wish that I would have read it at the beginning of my college career, and not towards the latter end.  &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; has changed my writting and speaking mannerisms completely and I feel that my writting has become more fluent and professional.  I am a pre-med major, and Strunk &amp; White address issues that aid in scientific writting.  I would strongly suggest for any student-highschool, college, or graduate-to read this and &quot;keep it close at hand&quot;, just as my professor had said to me.  And remember, rule 18: Omit Unnecessary Words.
B00000DFSK|5.0|This is a really good compilation of U2 songs if you're new to the band. Die-hard U2 fans will want to find the special 2-CD version that contains the harder-to-find songs on the B-sides disc. I'll have to say even with the double-album, my complaint is that I would have maxed out the space on the CDs to put more songs, or even add another CD to the collection. Then again, I have all the U2 albums so the real treat is just getting the double-album for the B-sides. Despite a few flaws, I still rate it 5 stars because this CD is special to me. I bought the Best of U2 1980-1990 the day my close friend died from diabetes. As U2 fans, we used to talk about every U2 song all the time over the phone, especially comparing versions of the same songs, so this CD really cherishes the best memories of my friend.  Overall, I recommend this as an intro to new U2 fans, people who aren't familiar with early U2 music. It's one of the few CDs that I can listen to from start to finish!
B00000ICD9|1.0|The story is pathetic, underlying philosophy/theology puerile, contradictory, and inane, the acting syrupy, dialogue insufferably twee, and the &quot;amazing visual effects&quot; have all the integrity of a Thomas Kinecade piece. Heaven is an Escher painting, complete with people flying about. Hell consists of naked, writhing bodies incessantly moaning, and a lot of dust. <br />The film also keeps making unintentional comments - for example, we discover that the two white upper-middle kids voluntarily chose minority identities in the afterlife and that their father does not question this decision for a moment. It would have been amusing if they had swapped genders as well as racial identities.<br />The only half way decent moment is when he goes to hell and steps on lots of heads in his search for his wife. <br />But the best moment in the film is actually the alternate ending (the DVD has it). We laughed so hard, we hurt ourselves.
0440234743|4.0|I'm a big John Grisham fan, and while I thought The Testament was interesting and entertaining, it was by far not my favorite Grisham novel.<br />The story of an eccentric billionaire who demeans his family one final time in his will is built on a strong foundation.  Grisham does a good job with character development through most of the story, and just when we are to meet a climax at the conclusion of the novel, he drops us off a cliff.  Imaginitive and realistic at the same time, The Testament will reinforce in your will the evil that money can cultivate.<br />All in all, not my favorite Grisham, but still worth the read.
B000003BEV|5.0|I love the Beatles. They were the first band I loved. But they folded, leaving the highway free and clear for the Stones, the World's Greatest Rock n' Roll band. Notice that barely any review of this album fails to mention &quot;Sgt. Pepper's.&quot; Why? BECAUSE OF THE COVER! THE COMPARISONS STOP THERE!!! &quot;Pepper&quot; was a MUCH better cover! Who can debate that? But this masterpiece holds up far better over time, as its themes are more pertinent today (&quot;2000 Man&quot;, &quot;2000 Light Years From Home&quot;) than anything from Pepper.  I actually give this record TEN STARS OUT OF FIVE!!! IN FACT, this album makes Sgt. Pepper look like one of those old Disney 45's with a booklet, that you followed along and turned the page when Tinkerbell &quot;chimed!&quot; Why? Because &quot;Pepper&quot; was CARTOON MUSIC! &quot;MAJESTIES&quot; is very much REAL -- heavy-hitting and hard-cutting! &quot;CITADEL&quot; rocks harder than ANYTHING on &quot;Pepper!&quot; Not to mention &quot;SHE'S A RAINBOW&quot;! This album has TWO SONGS with &quot;2000&quot; in the title! And don't let anybody deceive you into believing that &quot;IN ANOTHER LAND&quot; by Bill Wyman isn't good -- it's a haunting revelation! Bill's VOCALS are eerie and engaging; you won't be able to sleep for weeks! It's time to wake up and realize how very crucial this record is to us today! Had this record borne a different COVER, had it not contained &quot;Sing this All Together (See What Happens),&quot; it would today be making people ask, &quot;Sergeant Who?&quot; Ever since I first heard this brilliant work, I've used my old &quot;Pepper&quot; album as a placemat during supper. Do yourself a favor and buy FIVE COPIES of this disc -- one for you, and four for each of your four best friends. They will thank you over and over again -- you'll be a hero for the ages! After hearing this album, I'd downright be ASHAMED to be the Beatles, knowing our butts were kicked so thoroughly! As eluded to in my review'stitle, this piece of brilliance is the SALT to the Fab Four's PEPPER -- when you pour SALT onto a SLUG, it shrivels up and dies.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is one of the most brilliant albums I own. Its hard to explain just how brilliant these guys are. This album combines their raw, rock talent with a hint of electronica and a barrel load of style.<br />After the success of 'The Bends', Radiohead invested wisely in production and have comprised an album that will be heralded for many many years to come. With its meaningful lyrics, amazing guitar riffs, bass line, drums, samples and sound manipulation, Radiohead have produced a complete package. No track is lacking; not even the bizarre &quot;Fitter Happier&quot;, which, when you actually listen to it, has some amazingly apt descriptions of society and its vices. Radiohead, and Thom, love to sing about their angsts and the general disfunction of modern life; they question it, deride it and the results are effective.<br />The standouts on this album for me are &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, which is a beautiful classic with many changes and climaxes; what sound!!, &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot;, which is a smooth song with awesome lyrics: &quot;...about all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits, draw it all to themselves and live for their secrets...&quot; powerful stuff. &quot;Exit Music (For A Film)&quot; is another golden nuggety journey that starts with slow tranquility and develops with simple beats into a distortion laid grasp of hope and passion. &quot;Karma Police&quot; is a triumphant and proud sounding anthem that is just awesome, and &quot;Lucky&quot; is another favourite.<br />The entire album is without flaw. Radiohead here make a lasting statement about their ability and undeniable talent. This is without a doubt a masterpiece and should be owned by everyone; inspirational!!
B00003CXP1|5.0|Great cast and great style of direction. Ellen Burstyn is awesome and after seeing this movie, I would see another one with her in it. Jared Leto was hot and so were the rest of the cast. Sad and degrading in what drugs can do to your life. Great movie.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Great opera style movie and great acting/set.
B00004XQP4|1.0|I'd like to start off by saying I'm a huge Green Day fan.  Dookie is my favorite CD of all I own, and Nimrod is great, but this CD is absolutely not good.  Don't waste your money on this unless you are into slow soft rock.  I listened to this CD two times and then gave it away.  It is obvious in every song that Green Day did this just for money and Blink 182 stole their status of the most popular pop-punk band.  While Enemma of the State might be a sellout CD also, it is so much better than this it's amazing.  Excluding two songs, every song on Warning sounds the same.  If you like Dookie this CD will disappoint you greatly.  Warning is proof of why you no longer see Green Day on tv or hear them on the radio, because they are no longer any good...
B00004U3UG|3.0|Army of Darkness is one of my favorite movies of all time!  The movie effectively does horror/comedy because Bruce Campbell has incredible talent for physical humor.  <br />Army of Darkness is a 5 star movie.<br />Fans of 'Army of Darkness' might want to check out 'Bride of Chucky.'  Like Army of Darkness, that sequel stands outside its predecessors and delivers a good mix of black comedy.<br />But this DVD sucks.<br />(1) The GREAT original ending &quot;Hail to the king baby!&quot; is replaced by a LAME sequil begging ending for what might have become &quot;Evil dead 4 -- Evil Dead in Space&quot;  This is NOT what we want to see.  Moreover, there is no option to see the movie with the theathrical ending, or even to view the ending in a 'deleted scenes.'<br />(2)  The DVD transfer is bad, and is noticably bad whenever scenes not from the theatrical version are included.<br />(3)  Some of the extras (storyboards) are really nice though.  <br />Buy the Regular edition and stay away from this one.
B000000WGL|5.0|When you get down to it, this is the greatest Rolling Stones album (though Mick, Charlie, Ronnie and Charlie were missing). It's funky (&quot;Big Enough&quot;), rocking (&quot;I Could Have Stood You Up&quot;, &quot;Take it so Hard&quot;), soulful (&quot;Make No Mistake&quot;, &quot;Locked Away&quot;), sinister (&quot;You Don't Move Me&quot;), desperately in love (&quot;How I Wish&quot;) and fun (&quot;Whip it Up&quot;). It shows who is the real brains behind the Stones. If you think &quot;Let it Bleed&quot;, &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; and &quot;Exile&quot; are good -- this one is even better. It's mature, cutting and FULL OF HOOKS! Goes to show that Keith is a lot better without the smack. Why is this album the greatest EVER? Well, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, by the Beatles, is deemed by most to be the greatest album ever. But try listening to it 5,000 times. It gets old after a few hundred listenings. This one, however, NEVER loses its ability to thrill.
0385501560|3.0|I was heartbroken when I got about fifty pages into Chuck Palahniuk's latest novel, Choke.  The entire novel seemed more an awkard and hastily pasted together collage of leftover ideas from his three more powerful, and more intriguing earlier novels than a novel itself.  Although, by the end, the reader has the sense of some point being reached - of something more than just under-processed ideas and philosophies - the book just doesn't hold together as a whole. Before even thinking of reading this novel, all Palahniuk fans should read Invisible Monsters, by far the best work of this writer.  I only hope that Choke isn't a sign of a writer out of ideas
B00003CXP1|5.0|This film was filmed with maximum 'point of view' style. You are dragged into the story, almost interactively. The sound design effectively punctuates the story; fresh, loud &amp; manipulative, yet judicious in frequency. Aronofsky pushes the limits of the experience well into the discomfort 'red' zone, yet there is still one foot firmly on the floor. Not only does the film have a great 'look', but also the DVD has great bonus materials besides commentaries and 'Making-Of' sections. The opening menu is the most creative I have seen to date! A lot of entertainment for the money.
B00004X01U|3.0|Now, Madonna is one of the most famous people on the planet, as well as one of the most talented. I bought the album after my friends gave it rave reviews. However, when I listened to it, I was thoroughly disappointed. In my eyes, the only truly worthy songs on the album are &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;. All the others are very poppy, very light and non-consequential. <br />Even so, Madonna's album is great for all of those disco fans! As my mom said, it was as if you stepped right back into a disco in the 60's and 70's, and she uses LOTS and LOTS of synthesizer. <br />True-blue Madonna and pop fans would love the album, and part of the reason I'm giving it a 3 is because, after all, she IS Madonna!
0790729628|2.0|This film didn't need to be re-cut, much less butchered into a &quot;Directors Cut&quot;. I'm reminded of the words of Don Corleone after Santino was killed, &quot;Look how they massacred my boy&quot;.
0684867621|3.0|After reading this, I felt that Mr. King woke up, ate breakfast, went to his computer and finished the novel before Tabitha called him for supper. Not great, but not bad -- if you're frightened of the woods, this makes a decent companion piece to &quot;PET SEMATARY.&quot; If you've ever been lost in the woods, it just might horrify you. Don't expect much and you might like it. A big plus is that it isn't too long, like many of Mr. King's past indulgences. Might be his shortest novel since &quot;CARRIE.&quot; It's just right.
B0000065O1|5.0|Well I'm back and writing another reveiew for Cindy's other workout tape.  I've been doing Cindy's &quot;A New Deminsion&quot; for the past four months after having a baby and decided it was time for a more challenging tape...&quot;The Next Challenge&quot;.  Back when this tape was first released, I had worked out with it and remembered it was a great tape.  From all the  moving around in my college years somehow my favorite tape got lost....  I decided I enjoyed her tape so much I wanted another one.  Yesterday was the first time I did the workout in years...and my body sure does hurt! This tape will not bore you, but challenge your body and mind.  Cindy is such a beautiful person and doesn't have an emaciated body as other models do.  I especially love the different sceneries and MTV syle of video; it keeps you interested. And if you like variety in a workout, this is for you.  I am looking foward to my next workout and seeing some tone in my body...I know I will from having been sore today and sweating as much as I did when I was working out!
B0000069NM|5.0|Read all the catagories, they don't describe this album. It is much more than the sum of its parts. EVERY person of EVERY generation I have ever turned onto this album loves it. Memorable, melodic hooks from JS fused with great jamming from MMW, all with great production quality.
B00005AXEL|5.0|This is an album that even loyal fans of Ms. Nicks will have to listen to more than once to appreciate.  Have to admit that I was disappointed during my first listen.  The only track that I liked during my first listen was &quot;Trouble In Shangri-la&quot; and &quot;Planets of the Universe&quot;.  I've quickly become fond of the rest of the tracks like &quot;Sorcerer&quot; which seems like Lindsey Buckingham should be singing along, the up-beat &quot;Love Changes&quot;, and &quot;That Made Me Stronger&quot;.  &quot;Miss You&quot; is a song that needs to be listened to closely with it's dreamy background vocals and with Lindsey Buckingham on guitar.  &quot;Bombay Sapphires&quot; is another dreamy but up-beat tune.  The closing track &quot;Love Is&quot; shows that Stevie still has an incredible unique voice that her fans truly appreciate!  Trouble In Shangri-la is another great album just like every one of her previous albums which were ALL great too.
0749396067|5.0|I picked this book up second hand with some notion of what it was about--I had seen the movie.  Whatever energy the movie had was nothing compared to the raw edge of Welsh's novel.  The dialect, which is at first hard to follow, becomes easy to understand and adds a huge measure of authenticity to the pages.  While I don't think that this book &quot;should sell more copies than the bible,&quot; it is successful on a number of points:  1)drug addicts aren't monsters 2)escape,escape,escape 3)drug addicts are monsters 4) no escape, no escape, no escape.  Forget the film, read this book and enjoy the ride.

B00005BF9Z|5.0|If for some reason you've never heard of Manu Chao it's not too late. This CD captures the esssence of his persona, be it the early years in the now defunct Mano Negra or his classic solo debut Clandestino. You can catch up with where the artist has been and hints as to where he's heading musically as he is broadening his world music base to include English speaking countries. There are more English language songs here than on his other endeavors. I eagerly anticipated his new release after catching him live in Tijuana(&quot;Welcome to Tijuana, sexo, marijuana.....&quot;) on the final legs of his world Clandestino tour, he was phenomenal and brought the auditorium down. This is one of those that you put on before you leave the parking lot. The first reaction I had was, &quot;this is it?&quot; I thought it was too short, translation, I wanted more. Coming in at an average 45 minutes it is a thick collage of sounds and language that takes the listener to the far corners of the world. There is nothing ground breaking here as he follows the formula of Clandestino and his roots from Mano Negra. Consisting of a seemingly high 17 songs the music flows from one to another flawlessly and hardly distinguisheable as to where one begins and one ends, this adds to swiftness of the CD. One never has time to ponder a song becuase it is like one continuous stream of consciouness. A trilingual treat at least(Spanish,French, English and some Caribbean language ?), it is the epitome of world music,  blurring international boundaries by the sounds of the King of Bongo. The use of various genres and styles including reggae, jazzy riffs, dub, salsa and other danceable beats including radio edits and other technical wizardry the music is a delight to the senses. Someone knows how to use a studio to weave  and bind the music with multi layers that defy categorization.  Taken as a CD without any preconceptions(how can one surpass Clandestino?) based on his earlier works this is an outstanding CD. Someone said in a review it is a continuation of Clandestino and I would have to agree, but it also is reflective of his days with Mano Negra, the art work in the accompanying booklet also reflects this. This is also one of those of those CD's that is hard to pick favorites. If I had to I'd say &quot;La Primavera&quot; &quot;Me Gustas Tu&quot;, &quot;Mr. Bobby&quot; and &quot;Homens&quot; which is a &quot;King of Bongo&quot; clone. It is easier to say which ones I don't like and that would be none. The skip button doesn't get used when PapaChango is on. Manu Chao has been touring the world with his band of musical gypsies and he invites the listener to  hear what ports his entourage has anchored in. This followup to Clandestino doesn't dissappoint, Manu Chao's ship is anchored securely, I can't wait for his next journey already. Get this CD to hear the continuation of Clandestino or to discover one of the most original artists around.ng CD.

0316776963|4.0|I bought this book at an airport assuming I was going to read it after I finished the one I had midway completed.  I had to change my plans, I was having so much fun with his stories that I could not put it down.  He surely made me laugh with his less than perfect life.  It is lovable to read someone who can laugh at his past and allow us do that at the same time.  I have a lot of compassion for the author father though.  I would not allow my teenage kid to read it, the reference to drug use is very graphic and I got the underlying message that you can come up right from drugs without any grueling effort.
1558908382|5.0|Especially if you grew up in the 80s. It helps to like John Cusak, but even if you don't it's a good movie. It's funny without being ridiculous. The only negative is I don't like Minnie Driver all that much, but she was OK here.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I love this cd.  It was my first Blink 182 cd to buy then I went back and bought all their cds.  This cd doesn't really have any real bad language like some other atrist like Kid Rock or ICP.  It does however use language for younger people to get upset with although there is an Edited Version of Enema of the State which I also have because I am a Blink 182 Freak.  I would encourage alot of people to buy this cd and other Blink 182 cds like Buddha,Cheshire Cat,Dude Ranch,The Mark Tom and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back),Take Off Your Pants and Jacket,and if you can find it Flyswatter which is not sold in any stores now.Also if you like Blink 182,then you should consider listening to other artist like Green Day,The Offspring,and Fenix TX.

B00004XONN|5.0|'KID A' was my first Radiohead album I purchased.  And for all of you who are thinking of getting this or &quot;Amnesiac&quot; as a starter, please wait and buy 'Ok Computer' and/or 'The Bends' first.  I bought KID A and listened to it that first time and only two songs really got me &quot;Optimistic&quot; and &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; (which is now my all time fave. Radiohead song).  I hated it so much that I decided to sell it to my local CD Warehouse store.  BIG MISTAKE...  I then was reading online and saw all the great reviews for &quot;Ok Computer&quot; and &quot;The Bends&quot; I purchased these albums and listened to the Bends first then Ok Computer (order they were released) and I then realized how good those albums were and how good KID A was.  Next thing I know I'm in the store and I buy KID A again, this time after a few listens I was and to this day am amazed at the songs on this album.  &quot;The National Anthem&quot; &quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot; all the songs are awesome.  This album goes along so well with &quot;AMNESIAC&quot;  It is truely a classic in my mind.  It just takes time.
0783229321|3.0|Let me say that &quot;Animal House&quot; is in my opinion one of the best comedies ever made.  Now for the downside to the collector's edition.  The video transfer is good but it's far from top-notch. With that said let me tackle the audio which is a bit of a dissapoinment.  I've never heard such an overabundance of tape hiss in my life (it's so thick that you can cut it with a knife).  Universal should have digitally cleaned up the audio portion of this otherwise good dvd presentation.  Shame!  Shame!  Universal should hang their collective heads.  On a final note the extra's are nice.
B00003CXE6|5.0|Even after seeing this movie at least five times, it still keeps my attention like I was watching for the first time.<br />I don't think I can tell you anything different than 1000 other reviewers have told you. Watch the movie, enjoy and don't take everything to heart.
630264366X|4.0|This movie was especially interesting to me because I was already acquainted with Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty through 'The Rome Escape Line' a book written by one of his associates describing their joint activities in hiding Jews, escaped POWs etc.  It must be said however that the real Monsignor O'Flaherty, though undoubtedly brave and ingenious, looked more like Karl Malden than Gregory Peck. Towards the end of the movie the Monsignor disguises himself as a Nazi officer. I was wondering why the sight of Gregory Peck in a Nazi uniform seemed so familiar then I remembered, of course, 'The Guns of Navaronne'!
B000058TDY|4.0|To hear some listeners tell it, you'd think Cat Stevens's last three commercial releases were pure dreck. This is just false; plenty of major stars have spent entire careers without releasing an album as fine as _Numbers_, _Izitso_, and _Back to Earth_. (And I can't make myself give any of his work fewer than four stars.)<br /><br />But none of them are of the stratospheric quality of his finest three albums. He had two absolutely great albums -- _Tea for the Tillerman_ and _Teaser and the Firecat_ -- and _Mona Bone Jakon_ was mighty close. If you have those three, you have most of the &quot;very best of&quot; Cat Stevens already, never mind those other &quot;best of&quot; collections. (The rest of the best is on _Buddha and the Chocolate Box_ -- &quot;Oh, Very Young&quot; and &quot;Sun/C79.&quot;)<br /><br />Nevertheless, _Back to Earth_ is a _good_ album -- both on its own terms and as Cat's farewell to the life of the &quot;pop star.&quot; Most of his familiar themes are here -- children, father-son relationships, the beginnings and endings of romance -- and the music has, at times, something of the gentle touch we knew from his earlier work.<br /><br />I don't personally think there are any real standout tunes here; I like &quot;Just Another Night,&quot; I enjoy the hit &quot;Bad Brakes&quot; about as much as I enjoy &quot;Can't Keep It In&quot; (from _Catch Bull at Four_), and so forth, but there's no single tune that really grabs me. And I do think there are a couple of false steps (I can safely predict that I'm probably never going to care much for &quot;New York Times&quot;). But the album is much better crafted than you might think from what people sometimes say about it.<br /><br />All in all, it's a fitting final collection from a fine singer/songwriter. Speaking of which, here's a little history for the uninitiated:<br /><br />&quot;Cat Stevens&quot; was the stage name of Steven Georgiou, who was born in the U.K. in 1949 of a Cypriot father and a Swedish mother. Something of a musical prodigy, he released his first two albums well before he was twenty years old and was on his way to becoming a &quot;pop star.&quot; He then fell victim to a terrible case of tuberculosis. When he returned to singing and songwriting, he had taken a decidedly more reflective turn and found himself delivering absolutely beautiful stuff with no apparent commercial potential. That was fine with him; he was no longer particularly interested in commercial success. But, perhaps ironically, his delicate confessional songs and his deliberate avoidance of &quot;commercial-ness&quot; turned him into a huge international star.<br /><br />Well, he eventually (1977) became a Muslim and adopted the name &quot;Yusuf Islam&quot; (after the biblical dream-interpreter Joseph). At about that time he also left the music industry. He has since recorded a couple of albums about Islam, but his last collection of commercial music was _Footsteps In The Dark_ (ostensibly a second volume of his &quot;greatest hits,&quot; but in fact a set of lesser-known favorites and a handful of tunes not available elsewhere).<br /><br />You can feel safe in ignoring the comments from people who think he has become &quot;rigid&quot; and/or &quot;intolerant.&quot; The simple fact is that nearly every Cat Stevens album (the exceptions being his first two) is filled with &quot;spiritual seeking,&quot; and he eventually found what he was looking for in Islam. His &quot;recent&quot; (actually, 1989-90) remarks on Salman Rushdie were not what you probably think they were (and in particular he didn't call for Rushdie's death). He's no more &quot;rigid&quot; or &quot;intolerant&quot; than the rest of us; he's simply a religiously observant Muslim, that's all. There's a problem here only for people who think seekers should never get around to finding, or that traditional religion is more &quot;dogmatic&quot; than irreligion.<br /><br />His songs don't need to &quot;transcend&quot; their creator in order to be great; there's no need to run down Yusuf in order to elevate Cat. And since they _were_ written during his &quot;seeker&quot; stage, they're suitable for everybody -- future Muslims or not.r creator in order to be great; there's no need to run down Yusuf in order to elevate Cat.

B00005B4GU|4.0|I have to say the first time I listened to Amnesiac I was a little disappointed, but as time passed and as I listened to it more I began to fall in love with this brilliantly done album.  It keeps you entertained and interested.  I gave this album only 4 stars because Kid A and Pablo Honey are their way better albums.  Amnesiac is great and I recommend that everyone should a copy of this album.
0446525537|5.0|First of all, A Walk to Remember isn't my usual type of read. I usually like to read classics. Plus, I'm a guy; so I like mysteries and adventures every so often. But, for some reason, the review of the book in Booklist magazine really interested me in the book, and I gave it a shot. I loved it. At first, I thought the writing seemed a bit juvenile to me, &quot;if you know what i mean.&quot; I also thought that the characters seemed a bit unrealistic. But after about seventy pages (which doesn't take long), I was genuinely interested in the characters and what happenned to them. Also, unlike Landon, I was already in love with Jamie. As the book progressed, I found myself liking it even more until the satisfying, though sad, ending. A Walk to Remember may not be &quot;great&quot; literature. It probably won't be around in fifty years. But, man, is it a good read. Any true romantic (which I guess I am too) would love it.
B00000J8EK|5.0|In an age of comercializing, conforming, and making all music sound like 'pop,' it's nice to know that while other artists are changing over to the pop sell-out side, the chemical brothers are still pumpin' fresh beats.  Although this album is a great deveation from their earlier works (DYOH, and Exit Planet Dust), I was delighted to see a brand new sound that didn't flow like a generic &quot;TRANCE-MANIA VOLUME 1 (through 10).&quot;  Surrender has by far the most diverse sound I have ever heard on a CD. It would be imposible to put into a certain genre of electronica, because it  explores all of them.  From the slightly retro Music:Response, to some killer trance in Out of Control, to down-tempo, progressive, and the amazing finale, this album rocks through all genres with equal force.  If you're a true block-rockin'-beats fan, you might not like this album because only tracks 4 and 5 mimic the Brother's truly original sound.  If you are trance-obsessed, you might be a little better off, but not by too much.  Yet, if you love a very diverse compilation of music on one disk, GET THIS NOW!!<br />P.S. When I saw the Chemical Brothers live, they started the show with Hey Boy, Hey Girl, mixed into Block Rockin' Beats; and then mixed the vocal chorus of Block Rockin' Beats and Music:Response TOGETHER to a background mix of the two songs' beats.  These guys are TRULY FANTASIC live.
B00004VW0V|4.0|I guess quite a few Cat Stevens fans got excited when this album was released, but I wasn't one of them. I can't give it fewer than four stars, just because it's Cat Stevens and for its time (and its place in his career) it's rather daringly experimental. But it's not one of my favorites.<br /><br />For one thing, \\"Foreigner Suite\\" itself seems to me to be much ado about nothing. My reaction, then and now, was about what it was to Jethro Tull's _Thick as a Brick_: hmm, this is interesting, I guess. (And _Thick as a Brick_ grew on me; this didn't.)<br /><br />For another, the four shorter songs are mostly unremarkable. Three of them just sit there. The best of the four, \\"The Hurt,\\" would have been better if it had been better produced, but it's always sounded to me as though the instruments are out of tune with one another.<br /><br />Paul Samwell-Smith would never have allowed that to happen. But Cat produced this one himself, and I think his production was far less successful than on the later _Numbers_.<br /><br />Cat completists (of whom I am one) will want this one, and it _is_ worth listening to. But to my own mind, it seems to be much overrated and too self-consciously \\"progressive.\\"<br /><br />Now here's a little history for the uninitiated:<br /><br />\\"Cat Stevens\\" was the stage name of Steven Georgiou, who was born in the U.K. in 1948 of a Cypriot father and a Swedish mother.

B000053VAF|4.0|I thought this dvd had some really interesting extras but i found one fatal glitch.  It may just be in my player but if you try to select a subtitle in the directors comentary with video hijinks it locks up my player completely cannot turn it off or stop it nothing!  Have to unplug the player to get it to reset.  Never scene anything like it before in my life.  You will spend hours watching all the extras in this special edition.
B00005K3O4|5.0|Don't be put off by the incorrect reviewer claiming this DVD will be pan-and-scan fullscreen.  It will not.  The product description confirms this.  If you actually read it, it does say &quot;Widescreen&quot;.<br />According to the press releases from MGM, the DVD will be a full Special Edition and presented in anamorphic widescreen (16:9 enhanced) in the 1.85:1 theatrical aspect ratio.<br />Additional features on the DVD: deleted scenes, a storyboard gallery, a photo gallery, the original theatrical trailer, a &quot;making-of&quot; documentary (supposedly with &quot;home-movie&quot; footage), director's commentary by the Chiodo Brothers, behind-the-scenes material on composing the film's score, a visual effects commentary, a &quot;director's reflection on the film&quot;, English/French/Spanish Mono Audio (it was mono in the theaters), and French/Spanish subtitles.<br />Maybe the VHS is 1.33:1 full frame.  I don't know because I don't buy VHS any more.  Regardless, the DVD should be quite nice for fans of the film.<br />The fullscreen version is probably just unmatted anyway (not really P&amp;S).  Wait for the disc to compare.
B00004T9VY|5.0|When the album was produced Cat was bantering with Hal Ashby about which numbers could be included in the movie &quot;Harold and Maude&quot;  (Bud Cort &amp; Ruth Gordan)...He eventually recorded the most memorable rendition of poetic lyrics to be backdropped into an obvious antisocial medium.  The movie and album became an anthem for many of us.  There was never a soundtrack for the film so those of us who enjoyed the visual rely upon this inspiring collection.
B0000029AP|5.0|This is not my favorite album from Aerosmith (Rocks is) but it is their best if for no other reason that it gave us the classic Walk This Way a song which made them Superstars (Twice no less!). WTW's guitar riff is as recognizable as that of Cat Scratch Fever and Smoke On The Water, it is clearly a signature tune. I caught Aerosmith on the Just Push Play Tour this summer and the band played 5 songs from Toy's (Walk This Way, Uncle Salty, 10 Inch Record, Sweet Emotion and Toy's In The Attic) a good indication that after almost 30 years the band is still rightfully proud of this record that pushed them over the top. This album contains the song You See Me Crying which was a prelude to the power ballads they perfected in the 80's and 90's. Not as hard as Rocks but a cranker for sure, there is nothing like blasting WTW while driving on a sunday afternoon in my vintage American muscle car (79 Trans Am SE). If the Dallas Cowboy can call themselves America's Team then Aerosmit!h should be called America's band (even if KISS fans can make a good argument out of it). Aerosmith is to rock and roll what Ferrari is to sports cars. This album contains no duds and should be in every fan's collection.
B0000029GA|5.0|I don't listen to rap anymore; I haven't listened to it in years --Puff Daddy saw to that.  The era of wannabe mafia members, champagne hallucinations and spoiled caviar nightmares was to shallow for my tastes so I abandoned it.  But one album that I still listen to is this remarkable one by Nas.<br />10 tracks; 10 jewels; 10 extraordinary 'poems' filled with reflection and deep thought continue to satisfy my intellectual and artistic needs.  No one--not even Nas himself-- has ever made an album that matches this one.  The listener is guided through stories of crime, struggle, life, and death with lucid prose and artistry.  A true masterpiece in every sense of the word.  Through mind-numbing word play, clever aphorisms, and incredible beats, Nas sends the listener into the very heart of Queensbridge, and into the minde of a real thinker &quot;caught by the devil's laso.&quot;  [Note:  the Source gave this album 5 stars: A HIP-HOP CLASSIC]
B0000033PB|1.0|I am a lifelong fan of ELP.  My favorites are WORKS and Trilogy and the Self-Titled CD but overall, I believe there is something awesome in every ELP album.  Except this one.  This was the only ELP CD that I did not yet own because I was scared to buy it.  Now that I have purchased it I am at a loss for words.      This is not the ELP that I remember. This is an attrocity.  So I did some reading up on the subject and I found out that this album was basically belched out in order to fulfill a contractual obligation.  Don't expect any of the same energy you're used to from ELP.  Clearly, their hearts are not in it with this one.  It has a rushed feel and there is nothing impressive here.    I am sorry. I really wanted to give a better review than that because they are my all time favorite band.  But I cannot.                   -(V)az
B00004XQ83|5.0|This is the sound I search for unsuccessfully on the country radio stations.  Its by far the best soundtrack I've had. Its what I'd call REAL country music.
B000003JBJ|2.0|I was very excited about getting this cd based on all the great reviews written here. I had never heard Incognito before but it sounded like they kicked ***! But I must say I was a bit disappointed with this. The name jazzfunk makes me think that its going to be some kind of booty-shakin band with jamming horns ala James Brown-style but instead this is what Kenny G would sound like if he was black. This is smooth jazz with a few funky bass lines. If you're looking for party music that you can't help but dance to, this AIN'T IT!!!!
B00004Z459|5.0|Not one bad song on that album.  They are fathers of a new genre.  The lyrics in there songs reflect everbody's darkside.
B00004T9UF|4.0|Eminem is aight. He got skills and his style is funny. Although this doesnt measure up to his Slim Shady lp it is a fine buy. I like his rhyme schemes too they keep you listening. The thing i dont like his voice, its wack.  Some songs on here were really tight(Stan, Real Slim Shady, The Way i am) until radio got a hold of it. They played his songs out quickly. For Example i cant even listne to Stan anymore. His voice is annoying too. Sometimes he tries to get too creative (Kim ,Amityville). But most of the songs work.  Kill You is by far the best song on the album It's just dope. A lot of boy band and pop bashing going on but it is funny Sticky Fingaz, D-12, Nate Dogg Snoop and Xzibit make appearances.  Overall this is a pretty good cd with some tight production. Pick it up.
0671449028|5.0|My daughter is 2-years old and has been enjoying this book since she was a year old. This is one of her all-time favorites. We read this book almost every night and it helps transition her to sleepy time.  My husband and I have frequently grabbed this book in our many middle of the night readings to help our daughter get back to sleep. It is not only one of her favorites, but also one of ours. I would highly recommend.  Our copy is read so often I am surprised is has not gotten worn out.
B0000029GA|5.0|It is too hard for me not to like this cd.  If anyone dislikes this cd they might as well sell all the rap/r&amp;b albums they own and move to a different genre of music.  This is the definition of Hip Hop at its best.  This is one of the top 5 best albums EVER. Dont beleive the hype? Check it out for ya self. Some folks say this isnt long enough spanning nine songs.  But it is 9 songs of sheer brilliance.  Well thought out verses by Nas on every song. Flow is perfected. Content is top notch.  No Filler not even for one line.  This is about as close to a perfect album as you can get. Beautiful Production. The Best songs are all of em. But my favorite is Life's A B...., A must if you consider ya self a hip hop fan. If you dont already have it  ya better rush the gates before it go out of print. Definite Satisfaction
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is a rare occurrence in today's music environment of simple lyrics and uncomplicated sounds.<br />Their music is extremely nuanced and intricate and is a pleasure to discover and listen to again and again.  The lyrics have a profundity that most musicians today only dream of attaining, and they address a wide variety of human thought, emotion, and experience.  This, along with Aenima, and most especially Salival will bring you hours of listening enjoyment.
B00000AFWW|5.0|Hole combines many attractive elements: a strong sense of melody, good use of &quot;pop&quot; hooks (in the positive sense of &quot;pop&quot;) delivered a la grunge, solid guitar work, meaningful lyrics, and confident vocals that pull the song along while evoking the right mood. This album is their best from what I have heard (although I confess to not knowing their complete catalog). Hole brings to contemporary music the understanding that you can rock hard and still be musical - that the heavy sound of grunge works best when melody and harmony are worked into it.<br />*Celebrity Skin* confidently accomplishes this. The cd is strongest in its first half - the first five songs in particular. The title track is straight ahead rock-and-roll that would stand out in any generation. Courtney Love sets a good tone for the entire album through her vocal work, and the entire band lays down a no-nonsense instrumental entry into the rest of the work. &quot;Awful&quot; is the perfect follow-up. Love's vocals portray the paradox of the sweet and the awful through descending phrases to great effect, and the band confidently drives the song home.  The third song,&quot;Hit So Hard,&quot; is a change-up that allows the band to shift the music into a slightly different direction, steering away from the faster 90s sound and back toward a more elemental pop/rock mood reminscent of the early 70s. On &quot;Malibu&quot; the band continues to move deeper into the rock past. Framed within a song structure akin to the Beach Boys and punctuated by backing vocals straight out of the Beatles, Hole quite capably demonstrates a new versatility that indicates considerable promise for the band's future. The fifth song, &quot;Reasons to Be Beautiful,&quot; is perhaps their finest lyrically, and maybe the best song on the album. Love sparks emotions that resonate for obvious reasons, and she helps bring the cd to its musical and affective peak.<br />The rest of the cd is solid, but it is in the first five cuts that we find reasons to rate this as a five star recording. No holes in this one, if you like good rock-and-roll, go out and by *Celebrity Skin*.

B00003BDXG|4.0|This, along with Q. Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction'once again lit the blue touch paper in the 'Violence in the Movies' debate. Is this film worth all the hype? - YES it is, but not for it's violence but for the sheer audacious movie making that Oliver Stone had once again shown. Out has gone a lot of Quentin's snappy and witty dialogue, although the QT trademark is there, but the showmanship of OS is at the forefront.      This is what Q. Tarantino would and could not have acheived - a mad, bad and altogether out of body movie which debates that society and the media should be more accountable for their actions in the depiction of violence that is all around us. This is a complete cop out and should be ignored at the outset. Take this movie with a large pinch of salt and sit back and marvel at the splicing of different filmstocks 35mm Super 8 and also the fusing of cartoons in some areas. Plot, there is no plot, Mickey &amp; Malory Knox ( Woody Harrelson / Juliette Lewis) kill and they enjoy it they have no morals, scruples and no compunction in doing what they do! Superb performances from all concerned above and also Robert Downey Jnr., Tommy Lee Jones and Tom Sizemore. This disc is nothing short of brilliant as it has superb missing/deleted scenes, alternative ending and one of the best audio commentaries fom Mr. Stone himself into the sights and insights of the film.  Good / Bad? You decide, although it's not easy watching... you have been warned.

B00003CXDZ|5.0|After I first saw it 3 weeks ago, Moulin Rouge continued to linger in my mind. How can you forget all of the incredible music, colour, story, dancing, fun, and love in this film? I got the soundtrack and listened to it over and over again until I simply could not stand it anymore: I had to see Moulin Rouge one more time in the theater. So yesterday I went to see it again- and I can honestly say it was even better the second time!!! I noticed things that I had not seen before, like the use of colour in the movie (blue, white, and red,) the constant references to the movie's themes: Truth, Freedom, Beauty, and Love, and so much more. Seeing it a second time allowed me to focus more on the acting and songs and overall visuals used in the movie instead of trying to keep up with the fast- paced story like you are forced to the first time around. It gave me a whole new appreciation for the movie. I probably won't see it again in the theater- mostly because it's a long drive from my house to the theater that it's playing at! By I certainly cannot wait until it comes out on DVD. Moulin Rouge is definitely the best movie of the summer so please, please don't miss it!
B00005BJPO|3.0|As one of the first anime movies I saw, I can say I was at first in awe, then dumbfounded by Akira. It's really one of those movies that teeters between brilliance and failure. Many who get confused will probably give them the benefit of the doubt and say it's brilliant. Or maybe I'm a little more cynical than most. <br />Anyhow, this movie is like 20 lbs of manga (comic books) condensed into two hours of film. Do you really think they will pull off a coherent story? To their credit, I don't think you could distill 20 lbs of manga into a better movie. Unless, of course, you broke it up and fleshed it out a bit like they should have done.<br />If you decide to delve into this movie, I highly recommend you pick up the manga and learn to love that first, then the movie second. It's all that's good about this movie, only made so you can understand it.
0553213105|3.0|Pride and Prejudice, what a long book!!!  Pride and Prejudice consists of 3 books. In those days, authors were forced to write extremely long novels, if not, chances are, the novel would have not been printed. With sitting by a fire, and reading the favorite means of entertainment, novels had to be long , to take up time. Basically, thats all Pride and Prejudice did for me, take up time. If the novel would have been condensed into one book, it would have been much better, and probably would have received 5 stars from me.  Elizabeth, the star character is very likeable and we all seem to look up to her. Her epiphany......&quot;how despicably have i acted......till this moment I never knew myself!&quot; Is worth reading the novel for.

0780631684|4.0|More intelligent than bloody, and fun without being stupid or goofy.  Lot's of suspense, and the ending leaves you laughing at Death, without being contrived, and without the use of vulger puns and sex.  It's easy to relate to the characters.  If you're looking for Truth, you won't find it here, but it's solid entertainment--even suitable for the kids!  Have fun!
B000000WFZ|5.0|Is a fact this themes are related with the movie, but in the other hand music by itself has the own light. the way that morricone take and mix south america indians prehispanic themes, gregorians chants and inovative and new music concepts, can give to the common people and very intimate feeling about the pain when two different cultures are mixed, in my personal opinion with this musical piece morricone does it a new proposition in this times about the importance to share the better of diferent cultures. no one culture is better, only different. The use of the strings and south american instruments is very impressive and the children voices maybe wold represent the future of this new culture. GOOD!
630542828X|5.0|Here is a film that slowly and solidly builds to a rather unsatisfying climax and essentially leaves its audience hanging out to dry. The film's denouement is ineptly filmed and edited and leaves the viewer empty with an unemotional response or better yet no response.  This is a perfect example of post-romantic Hollywood filmmaking where visuals are not on the screen but are left to the mind's eye.
B00004BZ0N|4.0|It's funny to hear people say how &quot;radical&quot;or &quot;revolutionary&quot;THE CLASH was !! AN example for punk !! H&aacute;!! THis album is very good, stunning, but is so soft and light that I can't figure out what people saw &quot;revolutionary&quot; in it !! My God, there are even horns in REVOLUTION ROCK ( which, by the way, it's a reggae !!! )
B000003C4K|4.0|THis release of 1985 is amazing metal, the best the genre could deliver in the 80's. It's a shame the line dividing success and oblivion i so thin. That is what happened with EXODUS. Their debut album is so good ( or much better ) than Mtallica's &quot;KILL EM ALL&quot;. THe tunes are heavy and hard, the lyrics are great, a real punch. And let's finish the doubts forever: Kirk Hammett didn't record any albuns for EXODUS !! He was recruited by Metallica in 1983, while BONDED BY BLOOD, Exodus' first album, was recorded in 1984 (and released in 1985)
B00000I07R|1.0|To describe Bon Jovi as &quot;bubblegum rock&quot; is about the same as saying that Will Smith is the president of America. Bon Jovi is THE BEST band that has EVER graced the charts, even though they have some tough competion. Bon Jovi is often grouped into the &quot;Aerosmith-rock&quot; category, and although they're similar, they aren't alike. &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; must have shocked everyone-it was the first proof that one of the '80s bands was good enough to make it. And, if you pay attention, Bon Jovi is still making it. This album has beautiful ballads filled with quiet energy, wonderful get-out-of-your-seat tunes and everything else. From handsome frontman Jon's awesome, heart-wrenching vocals to Sambora's superb guitar prowess, this album will rock you so completely that you find yourself living within the music. &quot;I Want You&quot; is the most beautiful ballad on the album, and the overlooked &quot;Blame It On the Love of Rock and Roll&quot; the best track. Whether you like Bon Jovi or not, this album is a wonderful tribute rock-and-roll itself-wild enough for yesterday, strong enough for today, and modern enough for tomorrow.
B00000K32K|5.0|If you have seen the Lord of the Dance, you'll love Feet of Flame, for it follows the same story only with much more dancing, music and singing.  Michael Flatley has surely out done himself, yet he maintains his humbleness. Oh, the costumes and cast is three times larger in Feet of Flames.
6305078181|5.0|I am always amazed at others' reactions to this film.  Some are upset that it doesn't follow the Lugosi version; some believe it follows it too closely.  Some are upset that it doesn't follow the novel; some believe it doesn't hold a candle to the Coppola travesty.  <br />I am a longtime scholar of the novel, the greatest of the post-gothic novels and probably the first modern horror novel, and am usually disgusted with the liberties taken in film versions.  The Lugosi/Dean version, stage and screen, bears little resemblance to the novel, and is a pretty lousy flick if you discount Lugosi's mystique; the Spanish version produced at the same time is much more interesting. The Coppola version, supposedly faithful to the novel (only to those who haven't read the novel), actually reverses all the elements to produce one of the most perverse versions ever: every good character is presented as sleazy, inane, or insane, and Dracula is held up as some sort of hero instead of a monster! Add the ludicrous performances of Wynona Rider and Keanu Reeves, the over-the-top hamming of Anthony Hopkins, the impenetrable pseudo-accent of Gary Oldman, and the huge lapses in continuity (why does Reeve's hair keep changing color?), and you have an infuriating experience for the true Dracula fan.<br />John Badham jettisons the novel entirely, and thus frees himself from comparisons.  The movie is visually stunning.  Kate Nelligan is gorgeous and acts the hell out of the part of Lucy, a \\"modern\\" woman at the beginning of female suffrage. Frank Langella is the most beautiful, sexiest Dracula conceivable - the merest gesture of a finger speaks volumes.  And for the first time ever, it is truly frightening to see Dracula crawling head-first down the wall!  Laurence Olivier is wonderful as Van Helsing, moving, intelligent, and wonderfully funny (my favorite lines are his: \\"There is work, wild work to be done!\\"). The humor is always intentional and very sly.  The characters are fully fleshed out and relate wonderfully to one another.  There are a few lapses - Dracula casts no reflection, but the dead Lucy appears reflected in a pool of water (perhaps because she hasn't been dead long enough yet?).  The death of Renfield is extremely close to the novel's scene, moving and gut-wrenching at the same time.  Every character part is filled beautifully, particularly Donald Pleasance (his nonstop eating is understated and used to illuminate, not merely as a schtick).  The music is big and romantic and always a propos.  Finally, the characters' relationships, while bigger than life as befits a gothic story, are based on true emotions, and this is what breathes life into the film.  These Edwardian ladies are very prim and proper, until Dracula's power takes them into a world of sensuality.  <br />As you can tell, I'm a big fan of this film.  I was thrilled from the opening howl of a wolf and the shot of that ship pounding through the storm toward the cliffs of Whitby as the desperate sailors tried to hurl Dracula's crate overboard.  After the wreck Mina finds Dracula unconscious in a cave on shore, and as she bends over him his fingers reach out slowly, spider-like, yet with perfect grace, to take hold of her own.  This is what the gothic novels were about: beauty and horror, fear and yearning.  Cheers to Badham!  Get the movie!
B00004Z311|1.0|i tried contacting Universal Pictures to see what is going on with this movie, and no luck. the e-mail form doesn't get sent when you press submit. this movie is excellent in every way. so why won't they re-release it or at least release it on video again.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|The movie is something of a mix between an acid trip and a musical - I don't think I was bored with a single minute of the picture. Anybody who appreciates music and movies will love the many subtle touches Luhrman gives to the film. At least see it to say you saw it - you might end up liking it.
B000002UAU|5.0|Hailed by many as the best album of alltime, this is probably the best  known album by world's best known group. This album has it all, from  the danceable title track to sentimental 'A day in life' - this is a  guided journey to rock n' roll genre. Again you should note that this is an  album where several style mixes up to create the ultimate effect. The  phychadelic sound of tracks like 'Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds' to the  raga tinged 'With or without you' (surely the influence of Indian sitar  master Ravi Shankar) and a little progressive touch in 'Good Morning,  Good Morning' and the wonderfully funny 'When I am 64' and superbly  written and presented 'She's leaving' and a dramatic song about Mr. Kyte. I  must say this is still a very even album after incorporating so many  styles (and that's why it's so popular). Nice and innovative  instrumentation all the way... like the use of 'tabla(basically an Indian  instrument which has been used by some groups)' in 'With or Without You'.<br />Although I consider 'Abbey Road' as their best album (surpassed SPLHCB  for that wonderful medley), this album is not much behind. If you don't  have any of the Beatles album (which is unbelievable), I will suggest  you to go in chronological order atleast from the very beautiful 'Rubber  Soul' (1965) to 'Let it Be' (1970). If you want their best two albums  go for this and my favourite 'Abbey Road'. The amazing thing is their  best albums don't have many No. 1 s. Abbey Road (2), SPLHCB (0), Rubber  Soul(0). So after buying these albums you can go for last year's release  '1' to get all the biggest HITS. I'll end praising 'A day In Life'- one  of the best songs ever to end an album. The rising sound of waves and  almost orchestral(?) arangements are simply classic. The album was  released in 1967 (34 years ago), may the biggest year in rock history with  debut releases by The Doors, Pink Floyd, Moody Blues, Velvet  Underground. I know this album will be enjoyed by people 34 years later also. I  know another thing - If I call this album a Masterpiece - I won't find  many objections, because this is not another overrated album.
B00000IPAX|5.0|If I had to pick one cd to allways listen to it would be this, this is their 4rth realese in the U.S.   And their best, It has sevral powerfull songs, hell!  what am I talking about all their songs are powerfull, but these are even more, I really like blink's stuff,  Alot of people say that blink 182 sounds diffrent when dude ranch or a diff older cd is compared to enema that they sound tottaly diffrent?  no, it is a bit diffrent, but it is still simular, not that it is repetitive,  anyways if you like duderanch, or take off you pants and jacket then this you would like more, with sevral good hits such as &quot;all the small things&quot;  and &quot;the party song&quot;  and &quot;aliens exist&quot;, also if your a guy or a ... you can enjoy the cover while you listen.<br />Also vist my review site at<....>Later and enjoy        James
B000002MP2|5.0|An explosive album from start to finish. I only don't like the start of  the track 'F.O.D.' Everything else is perfect. Track 5-10 are real  blasters. Best punk rock album ever. Utility listening specially when you  are down and sad. Listen this and things will be better. These guys are  great, they scream, they shout, they shake like madman, Tre drums like  hell- only for you ... to make you feel better with their pessimistic,  angry words and lightning fast delivery of words. &quot;Nimrod&quot; is almost equally good<br />Gave 5 stars because can't give less or more than that. I don't wanna say anything more. JUS' BUY THIS.
0441172717|1.0|Like many others, I picked up DUNE based on its broadly accepted status as a SF classic.  I don't read much SF, so I try to get to the Big Books (War of the Worlds, Ender's Game, Fahrenheit 451, &quot;The Year's Best&quot; anthologies, etc).  This was not a good book.  The dialogue is stilted, the characters are caricatures, and everyone's always &quot;hissing&quot;, &quot;glaring&quot;, or &quot;swallowing with a dry throat&quot;.  The plot is interesting enough, but not nearly as complex or Byzantine as I had expected: warring factions, religious fervor, double-crossing, nefarious rulers, ulterior motives - standard stuff, really.  If anything, the plot seems complicated because we're told so little about what the Guild, the Great Houses, and CHOAM really are.  Anyway, as a non-SF connoisseur I realize that I don't get to vote on which books are the classics.  But from where I stand, DUNE is a poorly-written, lackluster, repetitive tale.  It's not the best SF I've ever read; it's not even the best book I've read this month.
B000002C2E|5.0|Whether you think this is Bob's best CD or not is not really important.  The important thing is that this Album, song for song, is definately one of the top three of the 90's.  And with bands like The Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, Tom Waits, and Radiohead, Pumping out great albums during the 90's, that is saying a lot, a whole lot.   Bob's lyrics are always good, very good, but rarely are they this amazing.  The album is incredibly sad and uplifting at the same time.  If you are a Bob Dylan fan in any way shape or form, you NEED to purchase this album.     Many people compare this album to Blood on the Tracks.  It's not any better or any worse than Blood on the Tracks.  They are very different from eachother.  They are very different albums that were written in very different time periods.  It gets compared to Blood on the tracks so much just because both albums are so heartfelt and moving.  Basically what you have here are two great albums (possiblly his best two) battling it out for the number one spot.  But the problem is the albums are both too good and too different to pick one over the other.   The bottom line is that this is an amazing album, and possibly his best.  Therefore this is a must buy for any Dylan fan.  If this is what we can look for in Dylans next album, then I am all ears.  Although it has been 4 years since Time out of Mind.  So who knows what can be expected, or if he even will do another album.
B0000027F8|5.0|I have not listened to this album in a couple of years, but there is something about this album that is amazoing: It's George Michael and it is actually amazing.  I am not sure where GM pulled this out of, it really doesn't matter.  This is a fine album, I'm sorry, a great album.  The lyrics are some of the most heartfelt I have ever listened to.  The melodies are more than enjoyable and engaging.  I honestly never tire of listening to this album.  This is coming from a man whose cd collection does not consist of ones by this artist, let alone general pop fluff.  THis is GM's most engaging work and deserves to be apreciated and not overlooked simply becuase it is GM, the former front man of Wham.  Who wouddaa thought?
0060245867|5.0|Our son loves this book.  The Give a Pig a Pancake book is awesome too!  It teaches that actions cause reactions - helps kids think ahead.

6304711875|3.0|The crowned king of horror is back, and after a disappointing run with the Eddie Murphy vehicle \\"Vampire In Brooklyn\\", Craven has hit pay dirt with a movie that is ironically a satire of his own work in the horror genre.  Charmed by first-time screenwriter Kevin Williamson's whimsical draft, Craven partnered with the young go-getter and on a budget of $15 million made a film that grossed over $100 million in the United States alone.<br />Craven is not one to waste much time giving us the goods when it comes to his freaky flicks.  In the fashion of \\"When A Stranger Calls\\", a young pretty blonde named Casey Becker (Barrymore) answers her telephone in the early evening hours in Woodsborough, a small and virtually crime-free town.  Sudden danger is the furthest thing from her mind as she tends to her popcorn on the stove, prepared to watch one of her favorite scary movies.  She lifts the receiver and almost immediately is hounded by the menacing tone on the other end of the line, forced to participate in a maniacal game of horror movie trivia to save her own life.  Unfortunately, she gets a question wrong and she, along with her hapless boyfriend Steve, are the first in a long line of doomed souls.<br />Although the movie begins with Casey and Steve's brutal demise, the main focus of the film is on Sidney Prescott (Campbell), a precocious high school student whose mother was brutally raped and murdered barely a year before.  Once Sidney and other Woodsborough natives get wind of the gruesome homicides the town becomes a media circus.  The high school campus alone is swamped by local authorities and insatiable reporters, amongst them all a particularly rapacious tabloid journalist named Gale Weathers (Cox).  Gale is no stranger to the town's history - she cashed in on Sidney's misfortune by writing a tell-all chronicle of Maureen Prescott's murder and declaring that Cotton Weary (Schreiber), the man who was indicted, is innocent and that the real killer is still at large.  Since then, Gale has become Sidney's worst enemy and she makes it known with her angry fists.<br />Besides her battles with Gale, Sidney becomes the Woodsborough killer's focus and is relentlessly taunted by his menacing phone calls, not to mention his ghoulish get-up and gleaming butcher knife (which he adeptly wipes clean after each kill).  All the while, her boyfriend Billy Loomis (Ulrich) becomes the prime suspect and she begins to wonder just who to trust.  The body count continues to rise and before you know it, it seems that Sidney has no chance of survival.  But like all good horror movies should have, there's a juicy twist at the end and we discover the raison d'etre behind the killer's exclusive list of victims.<br />Upon a first viewing, avid horror fans or ing&eacute;nues to the genre will be on the edge of their seats all the way and jump at every surprise around the corner.  To a seasoned movie critic, a stark realization comes very quickly as to just how tongue-in-cheek this film is but Craven's directorial style still manages to grab you like the rest.  There's a lot of inside jokes sprinkled evenly throughout the film that horror movie aficionados will appreciate; Craven even dares to make himself the butt of a few jokes to show what a healthy sense of humor he has.  Williamson's screenplay has the characters assuming a rather blas&eacute; attitude in the beginning, even amidst all the subsequent chaos.  Not only do they have frank discussions about mutilated bodies but one of them even coaches the others on the key elements to surviving a horror scenario.  Laughing in the face of death is an approach Craven and Williamson gleefully experiment with the whole way through.<br />\\"Party Of Five\\" veteran Neve Campbell is the beleaguered Sidney Prescott, investing her character with as much personality as possible.  A lot of what she does here is get upset and - of course - scream her lungs out.  There are times when I think she's not putting enough into her role, but I have to realize she's playing a teenager and it's a much more realistic portrait than, for example, the ridiculous traits that the neophytes of Dawson's Creek are endowed with.  Skeet Ulrich fairs well as Billy Loomis, the boyfriend that is ever under suspicion.  He's a fairly handsome chap but someone PLEASE get his hair out of his eyes, for crying out loud!  Those scraggly bangs that never seem to stay tucked behind his ears were quite an annoyance for me, not to mention his constant upward glances when conducting his dialogue - he seldom looks a character full in the face.<br />Aside from Rose McGowan's continually tacky sense of fashion, she's the worst performance in the movie.  Her delivery is so snide and her character is such a twit that you wish Tatum were added to the body count earlier in the film. Matthew Lillard is overblown with his obnoxious surfer boy shtick (which can also be seen in \\"She's All That\\").  This is one of his worst performances, not to mention his most grating.  Like Tatum, I prayed for Ghostface to skewer Stu in the first half hour.  David Arquette is the strangest casting choice of all and he seems paranoid every minute he's on camera.  I kept thinking to myself, \\"What the hell is wrong with that guy?  Get him some Valium, for Pete's sake!\\"  Fortunately, Courtney Cox is the luminary of this mediocre troupe as the love-to-hate-her Gale Weathers, a part completely out of type from her sunshiney role as Monica on \\"Friends\\".  She gleefully takes advantage of the cutthroat nature of her character, playing her to the hilt with her mega-bitch aura ever intact.  Consistently clad in vivid-colored ensembles and fire-engine red lipstick, Gale is a force to be reckoned with and she lets no one forget it.<br />I have realized that after seeing this film for the third time, it's not the acting that's to be commended but the general idea.  The concept alone is the movie's greatest asset and without it or its innovative creators, \\"Scream\\" would've choked on its own breath.r role, but I have to realize she's playing a teenager and it's a much more realistic portrait than, for example, the ridiculous traits that the neophytes of Dawson's Creek are endowed with.

B00000DGUG|5.0|I must admit that when I first heard this album I was shocked. I really didn't like it and thought it was awful. But, I always like to give things a chance, so I listened more. And now I have to say that it is one of my favourite albums. I also think that the majority of poor ratings for this album are from people who have only listened to it one or two times. It really is an album that grows on you, and eventually you will realize that it is a work of genius. It has depth and character and many different layers. It is very different to her first album, but give it a chance and you could very well end up loving it too.
B000002LEE|5.0|Here you are, you've finally put your hands (well at least your eyes) on it! Yes, no doubt, you've find the CD you need. The one and only one &quot;Nothing Shocking&quot;. This is surely the best CD of Jane's (which already means a lot). From the first track to the last one, this album is GREAT! And even much more... The guitar is punky, the drums are hypnotic, the singer's (Mr Perry Farrel himself) voice is heart-whirling and the bass is hip-moving. In a whole, this album is unique and obsessing. Listen to it once and you'll be addict for the rest of your life. Sincerely, eyes closed in your best chair or jumping wild on the dance floor, you will be moved by Jane's. I've listened to a lot of music, different styles, different bands, but no one has ever given me the wish of jumping over the sun (cause the moon is clearly not high enough) but this very album from this very band. To summarize, c'est de la bombe baby!
B000056MOD|4.0|I saw this film in the theatre three times, then rented it.  What a surprise -- the video version has many more snippets of dialog and a different ending than the film version.  I liked the VHS version better than the theatrical version.  A must for any Adrian Paul or Highlander fan.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game was a wonderful, thrilling, and touching story.  The clear writing of Orson Scott Card made the book to the point and easier to understand than it could have been.  A real page turner.  Ender's Game will make you think about how the future will be.  Read the book and feel the thrill I did.
B000000W5N|5.0|Luckily, i had the good fortune of having parents with a good taste for music.  On road trips, camping, or any occasion it was rock or nothing.  And the Rolling Stones were always my favorite, because their great songs were immediately recognizable...and they were loud and raunchy and fun!!  But that was when I was a kid.  My appreciation for their music has only grown in the past few years since I started buying up their old music again, and finding out that there's really NOTHING old about it.  Sticky Fingers is definately my favorite Stones album, and probably one of my favorite albums I own (and maybe in the top 10 ever?!)  There is a whole lot of raw power and sentimental longing in the music, and certainly with Mick Jagger's vocal work.  &quot;Cant You Hear Me Knocking&quot; is fantastic...a truly great crotch rocker which morphs into this warped kind of drugged-out funky semi-Santana epic.  &quot;Sister Morphine&quot; is a really sad and melancholy tale of drug misadventures, which a haunting violent guitar strumming throughout.  &quot;I Got the Blues&quot; could be your everyday blues number, but they turn it into a truly soulful ballad, complete with a great (and totally surprising) horn section near the end.  But the real treat on Sticky Fingers is &quot;Moonlight Mile,&quot; which is probably the most beautiful song Ive ever heard.  The fact that they were the true bad boys of rock circa 1971, and could still write one of the most stunning ballads ever is a true testament to their talent and creativity.  The lyrics are so poignant, especially when he sings &quot;I am just livin' to be lyin' by your side...&quot;  Its just such a suprise every time I hear it, and it always gives me chills.  Everything on &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot; is so delicate-the soft strumming of guitars, quiet piano, and a strange yet gorgeous violin section playing with an almost Chinese accent.  Until the climax, which is filled with pure emotion and power.  Everything else on the disc is just as powerful, including the more popular ballad &quot;Wild Horses&quot; and the guitar classic &quot;Brown Sugar.&quot;  I cant see myself getting tired of this music in my lifetime, but I can see why music today is so mediocre...its hard to measure up to real musicians like the Stones (circa 1971 that is).
0790733226|4.0|This is a great movie with deeper meaning and signifigance than the run of the mill Sci-Fi.  If you are looking for a fast paced special effects film, this may not be the one for you, but the film has a great story line and good acting.  I enjoyed the twists in the story, and the significance to the story told.  If you watch this film and leave without thinking, then you missed the message.  I really enjoyed this film.
B00005BL2A|3.0|This is NOT the best Depeche Mode album made, if you want the best get the Violator album. The band tries to go in too many different directions on this album. While &quot;Dream On&quot; is a throw to classic Depeche Mode, most of the album is annoying at best. Luckily, I got this album as a gift and didn't spend my own cash on it. The album my grow on you after a few plays, but my initial left me with the idea that the DM boys are washed up and out of ideas. I definitely will NOT be attending their concert after hearing this album even though I am a huge fan. Sorry, guys but keep trying and wait until the WHOLE album is at the level of &quot;Dream On&quot;. So, in closing save your money and get the single of &quot;Dream On&quot; because you might be dreaming onto their next album in hopes that its better than this one like me.
6305047529|4.0|This movie along with Five Pennies are two great films from the classic Danny Kaye.  He does a wonderful job acting out this classic short story.  The usual slap-stick with the sincerity of the role of Walter Mitty makes Kaye the perfect actor.  I have seen other versions acted of this story, but none compare to that of Danny Kaye.  The story gives it a four star rating, it is not as deep a role as that in Five Pennies, but still good.  If you do not have Five Pennies, get it also.  I feel it is one of his best, but this is a good one also.
0425170349|3.0|Starting with Debt of Honor, Tom Clancy's books seem to have been getting weak.  Though the idea of a future war with Japan or a united Iraq-Iran is a bit hard to swallow, the premise of Rainbow Six is virtually implausible: radical environmentalists genetically engineer doomsday virus and engage in terrorist activity!  World is saved by elite international CT unit!  <br />Well, there may be some nature-loving psychos out there somewhere, but the environmentalists I know seem rather peaceful, not exactly frightening terrorist material--they don't make very menacing bad guys.  The book's extreme anti-environmentalist tone is so pervasive that it distracts one from the story--as with Executive Orders (and, I've heard, the Bear and the Dragon), I got the feeling that I was not only reading a military thriller (which Clancy writes well) but also a political thesis paper (which he does not).  <br />The Counter-Terrorism element of the book is much more interesting, but it's not up to the quality of his earlier works.  Its fun to see the Rainbow guys waste tangos in close-quarters battle, but doesn't quite reach the level of &quot;excitement.&quot;  We know Clark and Chavez are invincible, and most of the new characters come out unscathed as well.  It tends to rob the action scenes of suspense.  In fact, I might have given this a 2-star, rather than 3-star, rating if it were not for a scene in which there is a duel between a terrorist and a theme-park guard suited up as a Roman legionary, complete with sword; it's the only battle scene in the book with any sort of tension.  Clancy's much-lauded detail and accuracy are starting to slip as well, it seems; there are some minor errors (getting the name of the Rainbow submachine gun wrong, for instance) and one big one (in Australia, July is winter).<br />The biggest problem, of course, is: how does he top this?  He's moved from the defection of a lone submarine, cold war espionage, and the war on drugs to nuclear terrorism, major international wars, and now an attempt to destroy humanity itself.  What's next?  Alien invasion?  His plots have been moving farther and farther from reality anyway.  Hopefully he'll correct his current slump and start writing real military techno-thrillers again.  It's not looking good so far, though.
B000002OX3|5.0|The Who were known as a violent, instrument smashing gang of ruffians who wrecked hotel rooms and all the rest of it, yet you'd never know it from listening to this CD.  Their true sound and fury was later illustrated most convincingly on the Live at Leeds album, but at this point in their career, that was still a ways off.<br />&quot;Run, Run, Run,&quot; the CD's lead-off track written by Pete Townshend, is pretty heavy sounding and would tend to indicate that the rest of the CD might be going in that direction.  However, we have the quirky &quot;Boris the Spider,&quot; &quot;I Need You,&quot; and &quot;Whiskey Man&quot; that immediately follow (two written by John Entwistle and one by Keith Moon -- of course they're quirky).  At the time of this album's initial release, I'm sure that these compositional, shall we say, inconsistencies, caused a bit of head scratching, especially amongst those people who'd witnessed a live Who show of that time.<br />Regardless, I think the songs are great in and of themselves, including the ones I named above, plus Moon's wonderfully nutty instrumental &quot;Cobwebs and Strange,&quot; Townshend's melodic &quot;So Sad About Us,&quot; and even the weird Roger Daltrey composition &quot;See My Way&quot; (although the version on the BBC CD is better).<br />The title track, &quot;A Quick One While He's Away,&quot; technical warts and all, was really quite a writing feat, even as far as today's standards are concerned.  It's a ten-minute composition stitched together from several separate songs with a common theme.  Townshend displayed his knack for great (in this case extended) pop writing with a wonderful, off-beat, off-color sense of humor.  I mean, who else but Pete Townshend could've visualized a girl guide, the British equivalent of a girl scout, being seduced by an old engine driver?  Townshend has a reputation of taking himself much too seriously and being pretentious, and he probably does and is, but he can also be absolutely hilarious while exploring the crazy themes he dreams up.  Some of those themes, however, have been quite prophetic -- check out the story of Lifehouse and the subsequent Psychoderelict CD.<br />For the Who completist reading this, there are several great bonus tracks to enjoy.  I used to listen to the old MCA double LP My Generation/Magic Bus constantly as a kid, and it was great to hear &quot;Doctor, Doctor&quot; and &quot;Bucket 'T'&quot; all nice and digitally remastered.  Plus, tracks like &quot;In the City&quot; were ones that I'd heard about but never actually heard.  In my opinion, all of the bonus tracks included on the CD, even if only for historical reasons, are gems.<br />Hats off to Andy MacPherson and Jon Astley for doing a great job with some, technically speaking, difficult recordings.  Whether speaking in terms musical or historical, A Quick One (Happy Jack) is an excellent CD all around.ilarious while exploring the crazy themes he dreams up.

B00004SCX6|2.0|Britney Spears still can't sing and has no talent, but at least the songs are slightly better this time around.  Thank goodness for no more \\"Email My Heart\\" and \\"The Beat Goes On\\".  As a Britney Spears album, I didn't bother paying attention to the lyrics, since they're sappy and meant to be mentally blocked out if I actually want to enjoy the music.  But sadly, that's rather difficult with all the annoying \\"baby\\"s and \\"uh-uh\\"s echoing in your head.  Especially in \\"Sastifaction\\"; that's got to be most annoying songs on the album.  It's highly repetitive, and gets extremely irritating.  \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\\" has got to be one of the worst songs on the album.  It's terribly country-like, and Britney's voice couldn't possibly sound worse.  With a voice like that, I don't think Britney would've gotten anywhere without selling her looks and body.  <br />Speaking of which, the target audience of this CD is highly controversial.  They seem to be trying to aim at an older audience, but I'm afraid anybody that age is just too mature for Britney's little sappy songs.  That leaves it to the little kids that are hooked onto pop-it's really sad to see little 10-year-olds singing along with \\"I'm not that innocent\\".  What has the world come to?<br />Well, at least SOME songs are okay-written this time.  \\"What You See (Is What You Get)\\" and \\"Where Are You Now\\" would actually be pretty nice songs-IF sung by another singer.  The former is a spunky dance tune, and actually promotes self-esteem, a little similar to the common themes of Destiny's Child (though they do sing better than Britney).  \\"Where Are You Now\\" is another one of those typically love songs, but it's got a nice melody...but again, I'm sure it'd sound better with somebody else's voice.<br />The songwriters have worked hard this time, but sorry Britney, you're just not a singer.
B00004Z459|5.0|This group is a refreshing step in the right direction for the development of rock music.  Linkin Park has masterfully combined hard rock, rap, and a touch of techno in this incredible CD!  The band has also found the value in overlapping harmonized verse with piercing chorus.  The blend of instrument and vocals adds to the hypnotic effect of the songs on this CD. Well done Linkin Park, and PLEASE make another like this one.
0553275976|5.0|This book is a great achievement in portraying the life and prosperity of the 1980s. The story involves characters that are not bigger than life. Through reading the decline of Sherman McCoy, one comes along a strongly written novel. At times you come across some of the funniest writing in English. Tom Wolfe is a genius.
0446677450|4.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad raises several important points about how (and why) individuals need to step back and take a fresh look at their perceptions on money, security, taxes and risk.<br />HOWEVER, if you are looking for a quick fix, formula or easy answer to making money.  This is not the book (nor should it be - if someone finds this magic, mythic book, please send me a copy!)<br />Instead the book focuses on changing the traditional mindset when it comes to income (40+ hour work week for someone else no longer equates to financial security) and assets (is a pleasure boat, or a new car really an asset?)<br />The book is plainly written so as to appeal to virtually any reading level and serves as more of an inspiration to make money rather than an explanation of how to make money.
0671665707|4.0|My rating on this book is really a three and a half, if given the option to rate a half-star, that is.  <br />I enjoyed tremandously learning about the Teamsters, the politicians and of course the Mafia involvement in the Las Vegas casino operations.  The book exceled in the abundance of information.  <br />However, the writing itself was not so great therefore lowering the reading experience.  Just as in real life, when people tell you their side of the story, it hardly ever concurs with someone else's account.  Since the book was really a collage of vaious narrations, the author had a hard time weaving together different points of views and tones.  Sometimes readers are left wondering what really happened.  <br />I would recommend this book for people who are interested in information and stories regarding the Mafia.  The topic is very interesting, but for those who prefers a bit more drama and fluency of writing, then this may not be your top choice.
6304806434|4.0|You will HATE yourself for watching this movie after it is over.  And I mean hate.  This movie is big, dumb, loud, and trite.  But it's a true guilty pleasure that'll keep you entertained all the way through.<br />Nic Cage has proven to be a good actor in the past, but his Forest Gumpesque accent in this movie makes him sound like a retarded cowboy.  He looks tired in every single scene and tends to drag down whatever realism is left over.  However, the rest of the actors in the film are very good.  John Malcovick oozes evil and is a very good calm-bad guy.  John Cusack also resonates well, as does Ving Rhames and Steve Buscemi.  In fact, Buscemi eats the entire movie in every single scene he is in.  He's menacing in a very sweet way, if that's at all possible.<br />Plot also doesn't have much to do with the movie.  It's a reason to give a lot of gunshots, blood-squirts, and explosions.  I really have never seen some of the so called &quot;plot-twists&quot; that my fellow reviewers said this film contains, but once again, plot doesn't matter in a movie like this.  Simon West's direction is routine at best and never truly moves into anything original at all.  Go watch The General's Daughter if you want to see a better film by West.<br />Despite all of these horrible aspects of the film, Con Air is extremely entertaining in a juvenile way.  West and Co. blow up things real good and the supporting cast makes for some entertaining lines.  While I'm talking about lines, let me just say the whole &quot;Bunny&quot; subplot is perhaps the dumbest thing I have ever seen in a modern action movie.  Every time the bunny makes an appearance on screen, I cringe.<br />But like I said, the movie is just so damn entertaining that every bad thing in it is overshadowed.  The pacing is great, and that is truly what saves this movie from being just horrible.  This movie is bad... very bad, but you will surely be entertained, even though you'll want to hurt yourself for liking it so much.
014028009X|3.0|Good book or no? It's an OK contemporary comical abstract of a modern woman's conflicts and struggles. Alrighty, that about sums it up. The book is easy to read, not too serious, not too deep, good for a laugh. It's NOT Jane Austen, I guarantee you that.
B00007GZR5|5.0|A movie is rarely made with such intense creativity. The artistic quality is completely unique, stunning and makes this visually exciting.<br /><br />Two souls meet and are soul mates beyond reality. Sunlit beauty entices you into the story. Emotional elements take hold of your heart and capture your attention in a way only one other movie has. This is a modern version of Somewhere in Time, with a more inventive twist. Only that movie made me feel the same way. What Dreams May Come is far more creative and captures the emotions of life with such truth. Yet, seems to have a similar theme.<br /><br />When Chris Nielsen and Annie meet on a lake, they never imagine they will go to hell and back, in life and in death. This is an intellectual look at how heaven and hell might be and is worth watching for those aspects alone. This is a journey into Chris' mind in life and in death. Robin Williams (Chris) and Annabella Sciorra's (Annie) acting is so wonderful. I kept thinking it is a sign of a good actor when they can play so many parts in one movie. Annabella's character goes from goddess to suicidal mother and then tortured soul. Robin's character goes from calm to courageous.<br /><br />Chris and Annie go through more than the normal human will ever be required to endure. When Chris dies and finds out his wife has committed suicide, he vows to find her tortured soul and bring her back to the heaven he has created for himself in his mind. He says something so profound about life and explains how he misses, books, naps and kisses. It will make you value life more.<br /><br />This is a quest for everlasting love and happiness in the afterlife. While I don't believe in reincarnation, that aspect plays a role in the story which is amusing. The originality in this movie is beyond creative. Having Chris end up in a heaven made of paint when he loves paintings was so wonderful! The flying creatures were so incredible and the fact that you could be anyone you wanted to be, freeing.<br /><br />A movie that will deepen your belief in a heaven and may even cause you to seek God and discover your soul. The aspects of respect, loyalty, courage, family, trust, love, belief in someone and endless devotion play out beautifully in the characters lives.<br /><br />This is a movie I will watch again and again and am so pleased I purchased it. Life can take us in its teeth and shake us around. It is in the next life where we will gain our reward or punishment.<br /><br />\\"I didn't get to say goodbye.\\" was what Chris said in this movie and that hit me hard because I just lost my grandmother and didn't get to say goodbye to her. Realizing that she is perhaps in the heaven of her dreams, maybe cooking in a kitchen of her imagination with my grandfather, maybe riding around in my grandfather's boat in an ocean of his imagination made me feel more at peace with my loss.<br /><br />A deeply spiritual and intellectual story about issues we all care about!

B000002MY3|4.0|Alanis Morissette gives the women in this world something to celebrate in her album &quot;Jagged Little Pill.&quot; The songs bring a truly uplifting feeling of power to women. The lyrics add a sense of independence. The songs are fun to sing and the rhythm is involving. Some lyrics go overboard being about dying and doing other destructive things, but overall, it is a great CD.
B000007R1M|5.0|If some well-meaning sadist were to pin me in a corner and demand to know what my favorite Kraftwerk album of all time was, I would pause for about 5 seconds, and finally sigh, MAN-MACHINE. This would almost be as difficult as asking me what my favorite abum would be by the likes of Tangerine Dream...Vangelis...Jonn Serrie...Jean-Michel Jarre...Pink Floyd...YES...Genesis...PFM...Constance Demby...Michael Stearns...ELP...King Crimson...Jade Warrior...and on and on. But...I can recall when this album was released and immediately being hooked. Not by the dance beats, necessarily (although we were in the heyday of disco back then, and I was eating up the latest releases by Donna Summer [for Giorgio Moroder &amp; Harald Faltermeyer's electronics] and underground club bands like Voyage), but by the damn-near HUMAN-NESS of the tracks. It's like the boys were trying to meld 2 distinct universes together: the steely, cold, mechanical landscapes explored on TRANS-EUROPE EXPRESS, and the warm, engaging washes of electronic keyboards on the likes of tracks like &quot;Morgenspaziergang&quot; and &quot;Ananas Symphonie&quot;(&lt;--one of my all-time favorite tracks of theirs, from RALF &amp; FLORIAN). Let their be no doubt: For those who, like me, absolutely love the allure of electronic dance music on a dance floor crammed full of fun-loving warm bodies being bathed in shimmering strobes and pulsating colored spotlights, this is the album to play, start to finish. The first 3 tracks give strong hints of the techno/rave craze to come. The last 3, though (which made up side 2 of the LP) are the ones that really took me. &quot;The Model&quot; was probably their strongest bid for Top 40 fame, and if I recall correctly, in some locales, they succeeded. The song is very radio-friendly and infectious, in spite of their insipid lyrics (and let's call a spade a spade: Kraftwerk will never be remembered for their heavy, meaningful lyrics...but hey, who cares? This is not Joni Mitchell/Michael Franks/Duncan Sheik territory we're in here.). The next 2 tracks, &quot;Neon Lights&quot; and the title track are the ones I love most, and especially &quot;Neon Lights.&quot; Clocking in at 9 minutes, this is, hands-down, the most pleasant, enchanting, and ultimately WONDROUS dance song Kraftwerk has ever done, IMO. When I d.j. at dances from time to time, I love to drag this track out just to see how people react to it...invariably someone will come up to me and ask, &quot;Who IS this?&quot; in a nice way. I cannot give this song enough praise...when it breaks into the crystal-clear, glimmering synth break at the close of the vocal section, the jam session that follows is simply delightful. If Kraftwerk were ever to do another live album, my fantasy would be to hear them do an extended version of this, maybe the length of the original &quot;Autobahn,&quot; allowing for all possible electronic improvisation on it. Wouldn't that be great? And finally, the hypnotic groove of the title track with the finely-crafted vocoder singing is simply a masterpiece in itself. Should anyone wonder what a good album would be to start out with, were he/she curious about Kraftwerk, this album would get my recommendation in a heartbeat. Getting to see the boys in Lincoln, Nebraska back in 1975 when they were on tour with Pavlov's Dog was a treat for the eyes and ears I will never forget. I just hope they will remain with us as long as humanly possible and accept the gratitude and love of us, their legion of fans, for all these years of incredible music they've shared with us. A final request to all German electronic music fans: If anyone knows where a CD of Fuhrs &amp; Frohling's AMMERLAND is available, please Email me.
B00004SCX6|1.0|....The beat to the songs on \\"Oops! I Did It Again\\" are dreadfully identical to those on her first album &#8212; perhaps because she can only perform one dance and needs the same beat for her videos. There is so much technical audio, no one knows what Spears' voice truly sounds like. And what makes me the sickest is the \\"verbal\\" interruption she adds to her songs that are so fakely outrageous it is just disgusting!
B000056VJ7|5.0|Fabulous CD - took me awhile to get used to it. I wasn't a fan of theirs in their heyday but wanted 'Paradise by the Dashboard Light'. I've enjoyed this CD as well as the Hits CD a great deal - using it to get psyched up when feeling down or tired or jazzy.
B0000020C4|5.0|This is the Best! I listen to it all the time. Truely the greatest musical of all time. Michael Ball is wonderful! Isn't he always? You can even hear him laugh when Grantaire is teasing him. I love that part:-) You can't in the movie. I can't wait for the 20th anniversary concert. It will probably be my only, much desired trip to England.
B00005JCAA|5.0|This has become one of my favorite movies. It is a masterpiece in my eyes. Anthony Hopkins is the cornerstone of the movie. Brad Pitt plays off him like a master. Watching these two work is a treat and I think Brad Pitt will someday be considered one of the best actors of the 20-21st centuries, and anyone knows Anthony Hopkins already is.
1567302017|5.0|I saw Shoah on PBS around the mid-80's and have never forgotten the experience.  The documentary was shown in weekly installments.  At first, I was just curious, but then I was drawn by the powerful testimony I was witnessing.  I remember that while watching the last installments, I was weeping over the depravity and evil that was discussed by the aged survivors.  At that time I was a Staff Sergeant with 15 years military service.   We are tempted to turn away from the horrendous images and ignore the Holocaust as an anomaly or as something best left in the past.  We want to move on.  But listening to the stories and watching the faces of the survivors I knew that I must listen very carefully.  I must not miss one moment of their testimony.  Neither can you.  Listen, watch, and learn what evil men can do to fellow man.  It's a long, long film but it must be seen in its entirety.
B00003CX5P|1.0|It will be just as bad on DVD. You have one strike, Lucas.
B00000K19E|5.0|You may ask, \\"What's all the hype about?\\".  I would answer, \\"What rock have you been under?\\"  This film grabs you.. and drags you unapologetically through a futuristic world of an alternate reality, leaving you winded, bruised and thinking in the process.  It is a fast-paced, slick barrage of visuals that seemingly jumped from the pages of Heavy Metal and were put to a great soundtrack.  Stunning special effects that were developed for the film immediately started showing up in other films and television shows, including Superbowl coverage.  The Wachowski Brothers struck a perfect balance between thought- provoking \\"What If's\\" and heart-pounding action sequences.  Matrix has a tight script that requires 2 or 3 viewings to catch all the nuances.  It is among my very favorite movies, which I've seen many times and have yet to tire of.
6305171769|3.0|The twentieth-year anniversary of John Carpenter's seminal slasher opus, \\"Halloween,\\" finds original star Jamie Lee Curtis once again facing off against her arch-nemesis: Michael Myers. Set exactly twenty years following the events of \\"Halloween II,\\" \\"Halloween H20\\" ignores the three installments preceding it. That means no Jamie Lloyd, no wacky cult subplot and no mysterious man in black.<br /><br />In this reboot of sorts, Laurie Strode has faked her own death, fleeing to California where she works as a private school teacher. Wrestling with her demons, she struggles with blatant alcoholism while trying to raise her resentful teenage son, John (Josh Hartnett). Things eventually come to a head when Michael plans a family reunion of sorts and follows her cross-country, engaging her in one last (?) game of cat and mouse.<br /><br />While \\"Halloween H20\\" tries its hardest to restore order to a franchise that had gotten more and more convoluted with each subsequent installment, it can't help but succumb to some problems of its own. Capitalizing on the teen-slasher boom of the late 90's, the seventh film in the long-standing franchise opts to pay tribute to Wes Craven's \\"Scream\\" in more ways than one. From its cheeky self-referential script penned by \\"Scream\\" writer Kevin Williamson, to its recycled score by Marco Beltrami and its casting of hip and hot WB stars, this film reeks of late 90's teen slasher. While \\"Scream\\" itself paid homage to the original \\"Halloween\\" in clever ways, the reverse treatment given by \\"H20\\" is not only premature but serves to date the film horribly as well.<br /><br />It's not all bad news for the film, though. Jamie Lee Curtis is in top form here, portraying the on-the-edge version of Laurie Strode as naturally and believably as she did the sweet and innocent girl next door decades before. Her final showdown against Myers can only be summed up as epic and is the saving grace of the entire film. This final act is jam-packed with suspense and emotion, and it's all thanks to Curtis's fiery performance. Supporting roles from LL Cool J and Adam Arkin are adequate, while a young Josh Hartnett cuts his teeth on a potentially juicy but ultimately one-dimensional character.<br /><br />Director Steve Miner made his bones in the 80's directing two \\"Friday the 13th\\" sequels as well as the semi-cult classic, \\"House,\\" so it should come as no surprise that he does an adequate job with his take on the Myers saga. While he's no John Carpenter, Miner does his best to bring the expected suspense and drama to the table, and even when it's obvious that the studio undercut him in more than a few ways (what's up with that CGI mask?) he still manages to provide significant class and closure to a floundering franchise.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Halloween H20\\" is hardly a perfect film. It's arguably better than the two films before it, but hardly lives up the original film or even its sequel. Fans will rejoice in seeing Jamie Lee Curtis back to the genre and hellbent on revenge, especially in the film's final moments. Unfortunately, the rest is just so painfully average and sanitized that it renders itself ineffective as a companion-piece to John Carpenter's masterpiece and plays more as a sign of the times. What could have truly been a grand cinematic event for horror nuts is instead yet another teen slasher flick, albeit one that's a slight notch above the rest.emotion, and it's all thanks to Curtis's fiery performance.

0792101448|5.0|Once Upon a Time in the West is my alltime favorite western. The main reason I love it is because of the excellant casting. I can't believe how long it has been overlooked by critics.The individual theme score for each of the main characters is out of this world and is still awesome in it's own right after all these years. Please let's get this long overlooked classic on DVD!
0553269631|5.0|I don't see a need to summarize the novel as the previous 110 reveiwers have done so, but I will share my thoughts.  SOme readers complained that the characters are left in limbo at the end, that that is not a satisfactory conclusion.  But aren't we always in limbo?  Their relationship with John Singer was not real.  It was their imaginary vision of who they thought he was, except perhaps Dr. Copeland, who saw Singer as decent human being.  Each of the main characters, in the course of their friendship with Singer, was dealt a hard blow of reality, yet they grow from it.  They have their dreams, and they have other things too.  Their dreams are shattered but they go on from there.  John Singer has nothing, no dreams.  He has only one friend, one person who he cares for.  And when that person dies, he has nothing left to live for, and calmy smokes a cigarette, drinks a cup of sold coffee, rinses out the ashtray and the glass, and puts a bullet through his heart.  What the others, griefstrucken by their deaths, was that he was like them, and every other person, only more so.  They worshipped him, but in doing so, they denied him their friendship.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Wow!  This is definitely one of the nicest albums of the year.  As a hip-hop head, I appreciate the vocal prowess of Del, the scratching of Kid Koala, and the sweet beats of Automator.  I'm sure a lot of people will jump onto the bandwagon, but this record will still remain truly unique and hardcore.  It's just sad to see a lot of people accept this variation of hip hop, while rejecting the true underground stuff.  If you like Del's style, check his album, I Wish My Brother George Was Here!
B00004YM0D|5.0|Believe me, the movie &quot;Remember the Titans,&quot; is the best movie in the world. It gives you strength to stand up and believe in what goals you can achieve in your life. It is VERY inspirational and a good comedy too. The soundtrack is awesome and will remind you of good times you've had in your life and bring back lots of memories. YOU'LL LOVE THE MOVIE AND THE SOUNDTRACK. IT'S THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!

B000002HRE|5.0|Whats the deal with people that say Reload ...?  I dont get it are ya with me people?  Reload is among my top four favorite Metallica CDs (1: S&M 2: Reload 3: Ride The Lightning 4: Load).  My favorite song on this CD is Low Mans Lyric because its slow and well written and describes the way some I feel on bad days.  All these songs are great and anyone that says otherwise really doesnt know Metallica very well.  Dont think that I like only new Metallica because I have Master of Puppets ...And Justice for All Kill 'Em All and Ride The Lightning The Black Album Load Reload and S&M (I dont have Garage).  So I know what I'm talking about when I say that this album is a must buy.  If youre going to buy this one I also recomend Load and S&M.  All three albums are AWSOME the songs are well done and dont have ... sounding drums like Ride The Lighting and Kill 'Em All.  Reload is different than other Metallica albums because its got kind of a blues tone to it.  But thats one of the many cool things about it.  Kirk Hammet never played any clearer more powerful solos than the ones on this CD.  I mean WOW!!  There are too many good things about this CD I cant sum them all up.  Fixxxer is a real a** kicker that I love and can't stop listening to.  So if you plan on buying any Metallica CD(s) I recomend S&M Load and most of all RELOAD.
B00000163G|5.0|THIS CD IS ANOTHER CLASSIC RECORD BY THE INFAMOUS 2PAC/MAKAVELI. THIS 2CD SET FEATURES OVER 25 SONGS (27 TO BE EXACT) THAT NEED TO BE HEARD. IF YOU CAN'T FIND THIS CD ANYWHERE, YOU CAN GET THE &quot;DIGITALY REMASTERED&quot; VERSION, WITH THE &quot;2 OF AMERIKAZ MOST WANTED&quot; VIDEO. THIS CD SHOULD ALSO BE PICKED UP IF YOU SEE IT ANYWHERE. I HONESTLY ADVISE YOU TO LISTEN TO DISC 2 BEFORE DISC 1, BECAUSE DISC 2 EXPLAINS MORE ABOUT LIFE, DISC 1 EXPLAINS ABOUT DEATH ROW FEELINGS. BUT WHATEVER. BUY IT WHEN YOU CAN.
B0000020C4|5.0|As soon as my local public TV station broadcast this back in March of 1996, I was on the phone!  I own the video and of course the CD.  My only regret was not knowing that it was being performed in London,or I'd have been on the next plane.  If Cameron McIntosh really does a 20th anniversary show at Wembley save me 2 seats!    Talk about exquisite casting, and what a joy to see so many  familiar faces. I love this CD almost as much as the OBC.    I am particularly impresssed with  Philip Qwast and Lea Salonga whom I had the good fortune to see in &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;.  If I had ten pages, I couldt praise the incomparable Colm Wilkinson enough, and any one who knows me knows how I feel about Michael Maguire!  What a pleasure to hear Anthony Crivillo again as Grantaire!  As I said, when the 20th anniversary rolls around, I will be on the first plane to London...Along with all these wonderful people too!

B00005AQGH|5.0|THIS CD IS A CLASSIC AND ALWAYS WILL BE. EVEN THOUGH THE ORIGINAL WILL BE WORTH MORE, THE &quot;DIGITALY REMASTERED&quot; VERSION IS STILL WORTH HAVING.

I ALSO OWN THE ORIGINAL VERSION UNOPENED, ALONG WITH PLENTY OTHER &quot;MAKAVELI&quot; CD's NEVER RELEASED. IF YOU EVER SEE THIS CD, BUY IT IMMEDIATLY. NOW THAT IT'S OUT, AND WHEN IT GOES AWAY, IT WILL BE GONE FOREVER. STAY TUNED FOR MORE REVIEWS FROM ME.

0140544518|5.0|I loved this book! Not only is it an entertaining book for children but adults as well. It is a funny and slightly sarcastic look at mordern American culture where every Criminal gets a chance to explain away or excuse his or her crime.<br />You see the wolf realy didn't mean to blow down the little pig's houses it was all just an innocent accident. (Besides they should have built them better)<br />And the part about him being a big bad wolf? All a creation of the media to jazz up his criminal trial and sell more newspapers.<br />It's rare to find a childrens book these days that is fun and creative but this one is both and belongs in every house with children that have heard the pig's version of the this crime against fairy tale swine.
0316776963|5.0|If you don't like laughing out loud in public with tears rolling down your cheeks, don't read this book. I hate to read out loud, but I ran to my wife to read Sedaris' stories to her. I started reading this book on an airplane and found I couldn't wait to get home to share some of these precious, hilarious stories with her.
0792156684|1.0|This is not a love story: it is a 7,000 hour mawkish sentimentality-fest.  Crouching Tiger is a love story (and much more), this is just fetid lowest common denominator fare.  If you are not bored rigid by the end of this film, kindly raise your expectations.
0800128052|5.0|Sean Astin is a great actor, in this movie especially. His face is very expressive and, despite the constant setbacks his character faces, his portrayal of dogged determination keeps pulling you along. If you're prone to crying at movies, you'll cry at some of the tough parts and then cry at the happy ending (sorry to give it away, but, hey, it's a true story). Don't miss Jon Favreau in a really funny sidekick role. Not just for football fans -- it's for fans of anyone who wants to see the underdog come out victorious.
0452281881|4.0|I work in a company that lives and dies by the instant commication known as email and didn't think I would find this funny.  I was intrigued enough by the unique approach to give it a shot, and it seemed like a pretty easy read.<br />It does take some time for the plot to get going and character development can be difficult while attempting to sound like genuine email.  Mr. Beaumont manages to pull it off.  You will recognize all the types of people to be found at any large firm, doing all the things we know they're doing, but no one talks about.  When you realize that every company runs like this you think it's a wonder that anything at all ever gets done.<br />It's saucy, it's crude, and it's loads of fun.  Get this book in one hand, a beer in the other, light the cigarette, and sit back and enjoy.
B0000041ZT|5.0|I can hardly add anything to what the other reviewers have previously said but just a personal opinion: I am not an expert in Shostakovich and I used to stay away from his music (until now); the music recorded here is not a typical example of what he did afterwards (i.e. symphonies, string quartets...), but this CD is really magic. It is true that it looks like film music more than standard jazz, but Shostakovich's talent for melody and orchestration (look for example the Tahiti trot) is outstanding. And even here, in music which is not intended to be very deep, you can appreciate the infinite sadness that would characterize his future music, his undeniable russian style and sometimes the joy of life and youth. Besides, the performing and recording are very good, so you can't ask for anything more.
B00003CXAA|5.0|First of all, let me say that I have not actually viewed this DVD collection (it hasn't been released yet), but I am confident that Mr. Copolla will present us with a DVD version that is consistent with his usual excellent standards. I have been waiting for this DVD set for a long time, as I believe that the Godfather trilogy represents a landmark work of art which mirrors the rise and fall of the Great American Dream. <br />I would like to address those who believe that the Godfather Saga, i.e. the televised, (and later-released VHS tape set) chronologically edited version to be superior to the original films. While this version may be easier to follow (in terms of characters and story) than the original flashback version of Godfather II, I much prefer the original films, as they provide a counterpoint, contrasting view of Michael and the life of his father, Don Corleone. The first film told the story of Don Corleone's final years, with the subsequent handing over of power to the next generation, represented by Michael Corleone. Godfather II, a much more ambitious achievement, extended the theme of honor and &quot;family&quot; commitment served by violence. The interplay of Michael's machinations with his father's challenges as a budding man of power is a cinematic device designed to illuminate the differences of character between the two men. The times in which the two men live also determine their respective fates. Thus, Don Corleone, through his code of honor and relatively simple options, rises to power; Michael, on the other hand, faces much more complicated choices. The same ruthlessness which made the Brando character successful is ultimely the ruin (in moral terms) of Michael Corleone. It is this dichotomy which the Godfather II film brilliantly displays with its flashback device. <br />As for Godfather III, I believe that Mr. Copolla made an excellent film, keeping in mind that he would be hard pressed to live up to the reputation of the first two films. Except for Pacino and Keaton, the characters in this film are all new, so some &quot;purists&quot; may have found fault with the performances, etc. merely by comparison with GI and GII. However, it stands on its own as a tragedy of Shakespearian proportions. <br />By the way, I applaud Mr. Copolla et al for the inclusion of the various &quot;bonus&quot; DVD features (which they certainly didn't have to produce, in order to &quot;sell&quot; this product). October 9th, 2001 seems a long ways away....
B00004TLMC|5.0|Critics (and everyone is a critic) will always be split on Kubrick, but this last one takes the cake. Eyes Wide Shut is the apex of the latter half of Kubrick's career, following the Shining and Full Metal Jacket; each film becomes more and more divisive. Yet, there is something strangely compelling in each of these perplexing, often disturbing, films.<br />The actual plot of the movie, and the novel it was based on, is arguable so far as relevence: Freud's stranglehold on Psychology has long since diminished completely, and the Freudian aspects of Eyes Wide Shut seem worn out: it might have been better 60 years ago. Still, the pyschosexual exploration is a completely new, almost humanistic approach for Kubrick, and (dare I say it) I'm glad he chose this film. For the first time, I find myself searching for the mental motives behind the actions of the characters: hitherto, these qualities of characters in most of Kubrick's films, particularly the latter ones, were played down to display a darker, almost naturally carnal side. This time we see the character himself lost, alien to his own actions and emotions, yet searching for an outlet of his inexplicable desires just the same. The darker side is evident, though the characters seems as puzzled by it as the audience.<br />Like all of Kubrick's films, it is visually stunning. The color selection contrasts elegance with tawdriness, filth and decadence go hand-in-hand. The soundtrack is pulled from a variety of sources: it is less modern than the Pederecki/Bartok dissonance that worked so well for the Shining. This time it is more polarizing: things like Mozart's Requiem can be heard next to popular rock music, all drawn together with eerie and curiously repetitive piano themes. Its almost Eliotesque in its mixing of contemporaniety and antiquity. The film comes together much as a dreamscape: remarkably well-shot and edited.<br />The acting is questionable: Kidman and Cruise may have been regrettable choices, though I think it was necessary to pair an actual married couple for the part. Kubrick's directing missed marks, and the miscasting makes these mistakes seem even more naked. Kidman is at her absolute worst: almost unwatchable in some scenes -- a few which seem to take hours because of her slow and incoherently intoxicated babbling. Cruise was a little better, and this is probably one of his greater roles, though I don't know how much that speaks for the acting. <br />I think the film will grow with time. On first viewing, it leaves its audience very much confused: its long, extraordinarily normal and points and surreal at others, the plot seems to take incomplete directions, leaves many questions, and the resolution seems unsatisfying. Still, it comes together better each time it is seen. Regardless of its flaws, it is definitely a grandiose piece of film art, and a must-see.
0783225970|4.0|In 1983, Director Brian De Palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an American gangster, and that he did-- with the help of a terrific screenplay by Oliver Stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast.  The result was \\"Scarface,\\" starring Al Pacino in one of his most memorable roles.  The story begins in May of 1980, when Castro opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba, to allow Cuban nationals to join their families in the United States.  125,000 left Cuba at that time, for the greener pastures of freedom in America, and most were honest, hard-working people, thankful for the opportunity they had been granted.  But not all.  Among the \\"Marielitos\\" who streamed into Florida, approximately 25,000 had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of Cuba's jails-- criminals considered beyond redemption, who Castro had merely wanted to be rid of.  And they, too, saw America as a land of opportunity, even as Al Capone had considered Chicago some fifty years earlier.  And among the most ambitious was a man named Tony Montana (Pacino), known to his associates as \\"Caracortada.\\"  Scarface.<br />Now that he was free of the yoke of Communism under which he had grown up,  Montana wanted what he felt was coming to him, and he wanted it now; and from the moment he stepped off the boat in Florida, he was determined to have it all.  Wealth and power-- that was Montana's dream, and he would get it by doing what he did best, beginning with a favor for a man living in Miami by the name of Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia).  Lopez, it seems, had a brother in Cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of Castro's goons, a man who, having outlived his usefulness to Castro, had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in \\"Little Havana,\\" along with Montana and all of the Cubans just off the boats, where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives.  And in short order, Montana sees to it that Lopez's brother has been avenged, and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of America.<br />Lopez, a wealthy businessman with the right connections, in return for the favor gets Montana and his friend, Manny (Steven Bauer), released from the holding camp, and puts them to work.  In his day, Capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain, but Lopez has the modern day equivalent, and it's even more lucrative:  Cocaine.  Lopez takes Montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life, but once he has a taste of it, Montana isn't satisfied with whatever crumbs Lopez sees fit to throw his way, and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be:  At the \\"top.\\"  With a cold-blooded, iron will, Montana decides he'll do whatever it takes to get there, no matter what the cost.  but before it's over, he will realize the price for his dream, and he'll pay it; but for a brief moment, perhaps he will know what it's like to be The Man.  And he will also know whether or not it was worth it.<br />In step with De Palma's vision, Pacino plays Montana larger-than-life, and he does it beautifully.  From the accent he affects (which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right-- and he did), to the body language and the attitude, he's got it all, and it makes Montana convincing and very real.  What he brings to the role is nuance and style, in a way that few actors (De Niro would be one) can.  This is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way, nor is there anything about Montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level; but Pacino's screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character, even though it's hard to become emotionally involved with him.  It's quite simply a dynamic, memorable performance.<br />Michelle Pfeiffer gives a solid performance, as well, in the role that put her on the path to stardom.  As Elvira, the woman who becomes an integral part of Montana's dream, Pfeiffer is subtle and understated, giving that sense of something going on underneath, while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance.  She, like Pacino, definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic, enigmatic and sultry demeanor.<br />The supporting cast includes Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Gina), Miriam Colon (Mama Montana), F. Murray Abraham (Omar), Paul Shenar (Sosa) and Harris Yulin (Bernstein).  An excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed \\"Traffic,\\" and \\"Blow,\\" and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of Peckinpah's \\"The Wild Bunch,\\" De Palma's \\"Scarface,\\" originally panned by critics, has since been cited by many as being the definitive American gangster saga.  Much of the violence is implied rather than graphic, but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing.  But if you stay with it, there is a lesson to be learned in the end.  And like many lessons in life, the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time.  But the reward is always worth it, and that's the way it is with this film.
B000053VAF|4.0|Considering this movie got made for $10 million bucks, it's better than it should be.  That's meant to be a compliment, by the way.  The DVD is pretty good (considering censoring on the commentaries and the missing documentary from...um, well let's just call them Di$ney), and includes an hour and a half of deleted stuff (a lot of continuity issues are addressed here, and a few scenes would have been nice to see in the film's release), plus there are some insanely funny outtakes (Matt Damon's theories on &quot;Star Wars&quot; seal the deal for me).  Add to that some rather funny menus (feel guilty for buying this DVD with the opinions of a elderly &quot;church-goer&quot;) and some funny commentaries from the cast and crew, and you got a &quot;must-buy&quot; for fans of the film.
0783244320|1.0|I have always been a Sci-Fi fan.  Even the poorly written Sci-Fi flicks with their backyard quality special effects captured my heart as a child.  I remember when this movie was in the theaters, unfortunately, I saw a distributor preview and thought \\"Great, they have ruined another movie experience by showing too much...\\"  A friend said you have to see it!  I must say that my experience with the preview left such a bad impression with me that I just recently decided to view it, thinking it was going to be a visit to the dentist.  To my surprise and great pleasure it was and is very enjoyable.  If you are a Star Trek or Sci-Fi fan in general you will enjoy this movie.  Most films today are poorly written and use special effects as the only driving force behind the film (i.e., Star Wars, Episode I) and therefore have a once only viewable rating.  Galaxy Quest is not one of these movies.  I am sure you will enjoy viewing it over the years.  I added this excellent film to my large DVD collection last week.  Relative to all the DVDs I have viewed; this is, without question, the poorest quality mastering you most likely see in a DVD by a major distributor.  If you never play your DVDs on your computer or you don't have a large TV you will most likely never notice any problems.  However, if you play this DVD (DTS version) on your computer you will immediately notice on a high resolution monitor the inappropriate high level of compression used.  What is interesting is that if you view Gladiator, also from DreamWorks, you will not encounter the 'pixel blocks' or sound sync (sometimes) problems encountered on the Galaxy Quest DTS product.  After a careful study of the 'quality' issues and comparing to various sized TV formats, using different DVD players, and viewing another DTS version relative to the non-DTS product, it appears that it the problem is only on the DTS version of Galaxy Quest.  If you own a DSS and are satisfied with the frequency of 'macro block' pixels thenthe DTS product will not be a problem for you, otherwise, buyer beware.  ---  UPDATED November 2011  Review is based on \\"DVD: Galaxy Quest - DTS\\" version.  Transfer: 1/5 Stars. Skip DVD/DTS version; Buy Blu-ray version.  Movie: 5/5 Stars

0553573403|5.0|George RR Martin's book, A Game of Thrones, is one of the best. It is a wonderfully written story that grabs a hold of you and keeps you throughout all three books, and you can't wait for the fourth. His story is gripping and the characters, both good and bad guys, are great. You will not be disappointed, and like everyone else I know who has read the first, you will be hooked.
630512065X|5.0|i first knew CATS through the original London cast OST (i won't recommend this OST, though. buy it for the song MEMORY). then i bought the VCD and watched it, and i thought, wow, no wonder it's been the BEST-loved musical. CATS deserves the name.<br />i don't mind if it's dubbed or not. i know part of the video is but the show was simply too brilliant for me to think about it. the camera work was very good. the costume and make-up has improved a lot since its original version (surely^^) and i must agree that Michael Gruber is the best Munkustrap. John Partridge finally found his place as RTT (he played Munku before, but i thought...well cannot really imagine it^^). and i looove Jacob Brent's Misto, he's among the best performers for that character. Jacob's dancing was beautiful, smooth and really effortless, and it was the first time that i knew ballet could be performed in such a *sweet* way.<br />but above all i must say that this show is truthfully enjoyable. the performers were greatly enjoying themselves, as you will see it. they were not merely performing for the audience but performing for themselves as well. that makes CATS all in all lovable...if they were all dull-faced their excellent dances would be definitely ruined, but they all seemed so jubilant^^<br />CATS is definitely the best musical around.
0060392886|5.0|This is a must-read for any Motley Crue fan.  It scratches away the tough veneer of America's favorite rock-n-roll band and unearths suprising elements.  Tears, heartaches, rapes and terminal diseases--and this is only the beginning--the Crue continue to shock their fans in a way only they have been able to for nearly 20 years.  It's almost impossible to put down.  Dirty, provacative and scandalous, readers will have more insight than they ever wanted (or needed) to know about Motley Crue.
B000000OSW|5.0|This album is pure genius.  It captures a dark period of Peter's life on tape.  It's incredible attention to detail coupled with his characteristic creativity make this an album I haven't been able to wear out.  I would recommend this album to anyone who really enjoys diving into music on a higher level.
6305878323|3.0|Anyone who has a 16x9, widescreen television will be disappointed to discover that the technical information provided by Disney.  They released this disc saying that it was in a widscreen ANAMORPHIC format.  It is not.  It is widscreen (letterbox) but it is not anamorphic so it is distorted when displayed on a widscreen television.  It's disappointing because this film is one of Walt Disney's crowning achievements and it's too bad that they didn't put it out in the best possible format.
0380973650|4.0|Loved this book. Gaiman explores ground that will be familiar to people who have followed his work from Sandman through to the novels. If there could be said to be any sort of theme to Gaiman's work, it would be what lies just beyond our perceptions. Old gods grab the worship they can, taking crumbs where before they feasted, just happy to still be remembered by a few in American Gods. Love goddesses become strippers and street prostitutes, the All-father a small time grifter, and Egyptian gods of the dead are undertakers. All coexist in an uneasy jumble in a country where they do not belong, the dead gods of immigrants whose worship has not survived. While the themes are familiar, the story is new and different, and, as always, a complete joy to read. Gaiman astounds with his breadth of knowledge of world folklore and the American soul. If you've read Gaiman before, welcome home. If this is your first read, welcome to a strange new land. You'll never view existence in the same way again.
0399146253|1.0|I enjoyed the first books in her series and recommend them to others.  This last effort shows that Patricia Cornwell has simply run out of gas and stories.  I forced myself to complete the book.  The author has lost her way and is now writing for the advance money.  The plots are getting sillier and sillier.
0440178002|5.0|This is a book has come to be known as one of the greatest fictional adventure stories of all time. It tells of a foreigner to Japan, a man known as Blackthorn whose fleet is shipwrecked off the coast of Japan. Taken in by the natives, Blackthorn becomes assimilated in Japanese society, only to learn of the power and deceit of the country. It is a tale of backstabbing and power hungry lords that scavenge the land in search of anything they can get their hands on. Blackthorne witnesses firsthand, the beauty, terror, and power of the country called Japan in an era of war. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good adventure tale. This is a must have.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|This movie was just a waste of money.  Just plain nasty and not very funny either.  I'm extremely sorry that I had to sit through it.
0688170528|5.0|After I read the summary of &quot;The Pact&quot; and Amazon readers' reviews, I knew I wanted to read it. Managing to find a copy at the library, I sat down and turned to the first page, not realizing just how engrossing the novel would be. The subtitle &quot;A Love Story&quot; is actually quite misleading, as it never is a sappy romance novel.<br />The book centers around two families, the Hartes and the Golds, where Emily Gold and Chris Harte grow up together eventually becoming lovers in adolescence. Their love for each other is so strong that they become inseparable, the two of them literally melding into one individual soul. Thus each would do anything for the other, even if it involves the most extreme.<br />For parents this book will make you reconsider just how well you really know your own children, and for teenagers like me this book will truly make you aware of just how powerful love can be and what the potential consequences are. The story was so realistic at times I didn't even notice it wasn't taking place right in front of me. <br />I recommend Jodi Picoult's &quot;The Pact&quot; because it is an emotionally intense and moving novel, a serious book that gets right to the heart of the power of true love.

0446310786|5.0|I read this book during my freshman year of high school and really enjoyed it. It was the first book I bought in a long time because I liked it so much. <br />As the reader we are brought into Maycomb County, Alabama through the eyes of Scout Finch, a young girl who has yet to lose her innocence. Through the book she matures greatly as she learns, much from her father Atticus Finch, to see through others' perspectives, one of the biggest lessons I've ever learned in my sixteen years of existence.<br />&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is a classic story that should be read by all.
B000001IPP|5.0|Another great album by the best band in the world.  Has a bunch of great songs on here.
0385335482|5.0|I was prompted to buy this book by all of the good reviews that I read here, but I must admit that I didn't expect it to be quite as enjoyable as it was. While the familiar plot line is recognizable - single woman working in London, miserable in her job and love life, quirky and amusing, etc. - this book has a different approach - the heroine's life revolves around her attempts to fill the emptiness in her life with possessions and she winds up over her head in debt. She's bored with her life yet doesn't even know where to begin to change it, finally finding salvation in the most unlikely places.<BR>I don't want to belabor the plot or the quality of writing and character development (both well above average for the genre). The best aspect of this book for me was how entertaining and funny it was while containing much in it that is easy to relate to - sure, at times it stretched believability but not so far that the book itself became ridiculous. Shopaholic is a delightful distraction, well worth the investment and one of the better entries in the now-familier Bridget genre. I recommend it most highly - it's a wonderfully entertaining way to spend an afternoon.
B00005BJ2O|1.0|The movie was spectacular for its sound, among other things, so this supposed &quot;soundtrack&quot; CD is a tremendous disappointment.  The sound mixing is atrocious; the singing of Nicole Kidman and her leading man is overwhelmed by the orchestra.  Each track has different sound levels, requiring one to change the volume constantly.  The opening song in the movie, which is a stunning rendition of &quot;Nature Boy,&quot; is sung by a different singer on the CD, a major disappointment.  (How CAN this be called a soundtrack, then?)  And one can only wonder why some of the best music of the movie wasn't chosen to be included!  Save your money.  I wish I had!
B000058TDY|4.0|This album probably would've gotten a fairer hearing had it come out in 1972 or 1973 instead of 1978, when the musical landscape had changed so dramatically from a few years earlier. When it was released, the general sense from the music press was that Stevens' time had passed and that this was a limp, anachronistic set. That isn't fair, nor is it accurate. There are a lot of moodier, softer songs than on previous albums, but they still pack a lot of punch. &quot;Just Another Night&quot; is Cat's recounting of his time with that &quot;Hard Headed Woman&quot; he'd sung about on TEA FOR THE TILLERMAN, but he's sadder and wiser to her here. &quot;Randy&quot; is as lovely a love song as he'd ever done before and &quot;Bad Brakes&quot; was one of his few times he'd tried a rocker, and it works. The cut that stays with me, though, is the closer, &quot;Never,&quot; which is ALMOST bitter about losing a lover, but comes off ultimately as sadly resigned that the romance is over. Which is probably how he was feeling about his music career at the time, as this was the last Cat Stevens album. Exit Cat, enter Yusef Islam. This album was a good way to end an era and it still resonates today.
630349255X|5.0|This movie is a breathtaking film that shows many different far off lands which make the viewer desire to know more about the places being shown.  There are parts of this film which are extremely thought provoking.  &quot;Baraka&quot; captures on film some of the most pristine lands on this planet to the extremely hectic day to day life in Japan.  It shows beautiful parts of Humanity like the temples in Tibet, disturbing images of  Humanity like the cigarette makers to very mysterious parts of Humanity like the group meditation/hallucination. This film has no dialogue and there is only music and nature sounds which accompany.  It is a masterful work of art and is a film I will watch many times in my life.
1577311523|5.0|I have been reading many spiritual books. Most of the books talk about the importance of staying present with the moment, that is, NOW. I don't think I still understand why that seems to be the essence of the path to the truth but this book has given me the best possible explanation thus far. I would recommend this very highly to anyone on the path towards God/Truth/Enlightenment.
B00003CXN4|1.0|This movie was slow, and never got to the point
6304935811|5.0|One of the few great movie biographies.  As long as this film is, there is not a let down moment.  It's a marvellous character analysis of a man who lived for the war.  Many priceless scenes with GEORGES C.SCOTT giving the best performance of his career. Among the highlights:PATTON and MONTGOMERY battling for their personnal ego;the general giving a slap to a war wounded and paying the price for his misconduct;his incredible knowledge about the history of wars;his incapacity to deal with the authority of his superiors etc.A truely fascinating study of a remarkable man who had guts.
0553588486|5.0|Of all the fantasy novels I've read, this is one of the most complex, the most grim, the most realistic, but also one of the most rewarding. If a game of chess between Bobby Fischer and Gary Kasparov became a novel, if each bishop and knight and pawn on the board had a story to tell, their tale would read like the pages of this book. Below is a list of the main characters as each chapter is taken from the point of view of one of the following:<br /><br />EDDARD \\"NED\\" STARK: The King of Winterfell, far to the north. Honorable and likable, but not without his faults.<br /><br />CATELYN STARK: Queen of Winterfell. Protective of her children, as any mother should be.<br /><br />ARYA STARK: Their young, horse-faced daughter. More tomboy than she is girl. \\"Stick them with the pointy end!\\"<br /><br />SANSA STARK: Their older daughter who is the complete opposite of her sister. She is proper, courteous and thinks that everything should unfold like a perfect day at Disney World.<br /><br />BRAN STARK: Their young son who loves heights--climbing or flying.<br /><br />JON SNOW: The [...]. son of Eddard Stark. Since he knows he will never be a king he must make his own future or let others decide it for him.<br /><br />DAENERYS TARGARYEN: A princess who is blood of the dragon. But her line is almost at an end and what remains of her family is in unfriendly territory.<br /><br />TYRION LANNISTER: An \\"Imp\\", short and ugly. Son of Tywin Lannister, king of that House. Tyrion makes up for his condition with his intelligence, witty remarks and sense of humor. Not very fond of his family.<br /><br />Those are just the major characters--the bishops, knights, rooks, queen and king on the chessboard. There are lots of pawns in this book and it can admittedly be hard to remember who's-who--but at least there is an appendix in the back with the family trees of the Houses.<br /><br />As many have said, this is a very downbeat book. If you feel that the good guys should always win in the end, then this book is probably not for you. Some text from page 746 of the book itself says it best:<br /><br />\\"Life is not a song, sweetling.\\" And \\"In life, the monsters win.\\"k itself says it best:    \\"Life is not a song, sweetling.\\" And \\"In life, the monsters win.\\"
B0000062GE|5.0|this album is a total classic as far as my personal collection is concerned.dark, moody, reflective,great vibe, innovative sounding, and catchy, absolutely everything one could ask for in an album.the best stabbing westward album and thats saying a lot.musically it hits that hallowed industrial/rock middle ground that works so well. the songs are all well written and emotional as well as very well composed sound wise.&quot;drugstore&quot; is one of my all time favorite songs, and everything else here is great as well.ive listened to this cd many many times and it never gets old, its the kind of album that sucks you in until the very end.no one ever gives this band much credit past being a n nin ripoff, and thats a shame.no ripoff band could ever create something this good.
0375501851|3.0|I started out enjoying this novel very much.  The writing is vivid, the dialogue apt, and the North London community fascinating.  But at about the half way mark I began thinking of the Stephen Leacock character who jumped on his horse and rode off in all directions: I began to lost track of the many characters and the book seemed to lose focus for me.  There were too many characters for me to keep in mind, and worse, many were introduced, developed, and then dropped.  Likewise sub-plots were initiated and abandoned.  Others have commented on the weak ending, and noted that many plot threads peter out, and are left unresolved.  It seems to me there are at least two novels in this material, and probably more, alternatively a couple dozen short stories; as presently constituted the book is less than the sum of its parts.  Ms. Smith has enormous gifts, but she should seek out a vigorous editor to help her manage those gifts.
B00005JIZA|5.0|How do I entice you?  What words can I type to paint the right picture?  How do you describe a CD that keeps pulling at you, saying &quot;play me again&quot;?<br />You can read other reviews to learn a bit more about John Mayer - or go to his web site.  My job is to help you know why you want to listen to this CD.<br />1st - every track is interesting, both lyrically and musically.  I've been listening to this CD for a week, and each day a different track is my favorite.  During the first few runs I focused on the sound - beautiful guitar working, excellent voice (reminds one of Dave Matthews or Sting), good production.  Then you start to focus on the words.  This guy can write.<br />2nd - some of my favorite lyrics:   &quot;I'm never speaking up again. It only hurts me  I'd rather be a mystery, than she desert me&quot; - My Stupid Mouth<br />&quot;Something 'bout the way the hair falls in your face I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillowcase&quot; - Your Body is a Wonderland<br />&quot;whatever happened to my lunchbox?&quot; - 83<br />3rd - the music fits the lyrics<br />OK - I haven't convinced anyone.  How can you describe music?  How can you portray the addiction this CD creates?<br />Don't believe me - find a way to listen to this CD.  It may just get you also.<br />Avoid this CD if you don't like clever lyrics, melodies, solid arrangements.  It isn't loud, it isn't avant garde - it's just beautiful.<br />You might even thank me.
B000007489|5.0|this album is pure mayhem for the most part. suicides an alternative really blew me away with it's speed and aggression. i saw your mommy is twisted. don't let your little kid hear this. one of my favorites is i want more which starts off with a slow, mellow vocal line, but gets really fast. suicidal failure is anither good song. definitely worth the money.
B00003CXDZ|4.0|Moulin Rouge is not a perfect film but it is original and eye dazzling compared to other musical films such as Chicago. With newly dumped, Nicole Kidman as the doomed beauty, Satine, Ewan McGregor, the young idealistic writer, Christian, Jim Broadbent as Zigler, John Leguzzamo as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Richard Roxbury, the evil snidley duke, this is the cast of casts.  Special features on the the DVD allow one to use the slow motion features and different camera perspectives to see everything from several angles that were a wild blur in theater screenings, and there are several hidden easter egg features which supply additional historical context to the story or production worthy of attention.  This is a well researched film thanks to the dilligence of Catherine Martin who won two Oscars for her work on the film's costumes and production.    Director Baz Luhrmann is an artist of unusual visual aplomb, his previous theatrical training in opera is never more pronounced than in this production.  What is literally the operatic marriage of several familiar storylines from La Bohem and Camille to Top Hat-meets-the Marx Brothers is set within overwhelming staged productions featuring the loud entrance and exits of a circus of singers and dancers all engaged in over the top performances. Moulin Rouge as Luhrmann presents it is nothing less than stunning, original theatre as performance and at the very least, compulsive toe-tapping fare.    Like another cutting edge director of another generation, Franco Zefferelli, Luhrmann cast unusually attractive actors not readily known for their singing ability in the lead roles of Christian (Ewan McGregor) and Satine (Nicole Kidman).  Their physical beauty enhanced the pathos surrounding the film's predictable and obvious romantic storyline, a point that could have been developed better.  Utilizing recognizable songs from the recent top 40 charts and combined with Broadway standards among others, McGregor and Kidman seranade each other with believable natural vocal talent enhanced by superb orchestrations and music arrangement.    Many critics of the film commented that musical interaction and dialogue is unrealistic in Luhrmann's production, moreso a distraction in Moulin Rouge, but I disagree.  Moulin Rouge is a musical/drama, a genre where it is expected the actors speak and sing while acting.  No one in Moulin Rouge disgraces themselves with anything but superior and in some instances exceptional performances.  In supporting roles are a multi-talented cast that include John Leguizamo as Henri Toulouse-Lautrec who spurs Christian to write the bohemian rapsody \\"Spectacle Spectacle,\\" Jim Broadbent (Topsy Turvy) portrays Harold Zigler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge as a soft-hearted yet ambitious businessman, and Richard Roxburgh in the role of The Duke is a dopey dupe who steals every scene from McGregor and Kidman whenever they appear together.  But for most it is the sheer spectacle of Moulin Rouge that sweeps up viewers with swishpan flashes of dazzling costumes and fast edits all that combine to create divisive audience and critical reaction, a perspective that defines good art at its best.  Once the dust of public opinion settled, Moulin Rouge continues be an excellent DVD or video for every home collection.  It marks the status of the new musical post millenium, and harolds the return of the full ensemble musical. Thank you Bazmark, Nicole, and Ewan!!
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I found Moulin Rouge to be a very unique and fun cd. Lady Marmelade, Sparkling Diamonds, Elephant Love Medley, and Come What May are my favorite tracks. Nicole Kidman really sings well! She could be on Broadway, I have every faith! Anyhow, it's nothing less than fun. I liked it.
0684853523|4.0|While a nice biography of the life and times of Mr. King, if you're looking for the nuts and bolts of writing and publishing a best selling novel, there are better books available.  After saying that, I must admit his critiques of his manuscripts were instructive, and confess I have not taken his challenge of writing a story as outlined in the book.<br />I highly recommend this book to aspiring writers, if only to get a feel of what it's like to be a writer.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|The reason this album found its way into my collection was because of the ever-popular &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; hit. I absolutely could not get enough of the song, and had to purchase the CD to satisfy my need to hear the song several times a day. However, I soon discovered that I am in love with the voice of Ewan McGregor. He can SING! &quot;Your Song&quot; and &quot;Elephant Love Medly&quot; are two of my favorites, and really bring back the whole feeling of the film. &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; takes a while to grow on you, but it's actually a very good song. Interesting and quirky. Having Fatboy Slim on the Can-Can bit was really creative genius; the result is amazing. While Nicole Kidman isn't much of a vocalist, I give her credit for at least carrying her half of the duets. Solo, though, she doesn't amount to much. Ewan truly carries the album in that respect. All in all, a great listen!
B00003CWL6|4.0|I was totally mesmerised with this movie.  Everything about it was carefully filmed and placed in ever so strategic spots.  Any variation of frames would have thrown the movie into turmoil.   I am not one to watch movies over again... unless they have 'it', and this movie certainly does.  The cast was perfect, cinematography was fluid and clear, and I found that it was almost a 'feel good' movie, with the watcher rooting for Kevin Spacey's character.  The ending was absolutely NOT what I expected, but what an ending it was!  Kudos on a great piece of art.
0385040253|5.0|This book is the fruit of a live passion for knot tying; it contains approximately 3900 knots, sinnets and splices accompanied with individual explanations and 7000 drawings. <br />The involvement of Mr. Ashley with knots began as he relates, in his early childhood when his two uncles that were whaling captains taught him the first lessons in knot tying, after this he began the gathering and practical study of every kind of knot that crossed his path. The result is this imposing book that took him 11 years to finish.<br />The book presents in an organized way knots of general utility, and others that are used in more particular circumstances as fishing or camping. You can find and discover scores of very interesting uses for knots from simple ornamental to practical and useful purposes.  The sections that I enjoyed the most are the one about occupational knots and the section about tricks and puzzles, one can spend hours and hours navigating through the book that is so full of interesting details and curiosities.<br />If you are like me a beginner in knot tying, you could find some of the illustrations and directions a little difficult to follow at first, but I can assure you that if you keep trying, in a short time you will get the knack of it, and you will agree with the author when he says: &quot;To me the simple act of tying a knot is an adventure in unlimited space.&quot;
0451169514|5.0|This book of King has got to be, in my opinion, his greatest work!  The movie was good, but the book is so much better.   After I read it the first time, I would go back and read it again and appreciate King's writing.  The way he connects the past of the Losers and their present is absolute genius.  <br />His characterization of the characters, both good and bad, really got you involved with the lives of the Losers.  That is probably the best thing about reading the book even if you've seen the movie.  You knew everyone's back story and how they grew up to be who they were in the present.<br />King's use of Pennywise the Clown was right on target since many people are unsettled by clowns (John Wayne Gacy is one example).  The clown as the essence of evil was totally captured in the story. It also makes the book that much scarier because it is very close to the truth behind the &quot;bogeyman&quot;.<br />I read this book at nighttime the first time I read it and it still makes me think of what could be lurking below the surface of reality (the sewers under the street) and dark forests.<br />I would rate this book by Stephen King as one of my all-time favorite books.   <br />Read it, you'll love it
0425170349|5.0|This is a great book! It's very interesting, and keeps you reading. I like the way part of it is told from the terrorists' POV. It gives you a good insight into what they were thinking, and their motives. It also reminds people that they are human beings, and that they are actually quite smart, even though Rainbow was smarter. I'd recommend this book to anyone. Cheers, Mr Clancy!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|NICOLE KIDMAN AND EWAN MCGREGOR PLAY AN OUTSTANDING ROLE IN THIS HOT ,NEW MOVIE.IT'S A MUST SEE! I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. THE BEST MOVIE THIS YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!
0792837614|5.0|This classic tale of a boy and a girl seperated by racial prejudices will move hearts, especially those born romantics. With great correography, catchy music, and generally good acting, this movie is moving and heart-rending.  NOBODY should EVER EVER try to recreate this masterpiece for a commonplace highschool musical. Our school tried .. and though we had talented actors and musicians, we didn't do half as well as the movie, and ended up ruining the story for the entire cast. Directors really make a difference. Ours .. did. Now, noone can even hear the word &quot;Westside,&quot; without a grimace. We managed to pull it off, and even reduced many to tears, but even so. No, instead, watch the movie. Don't critique too much, or pick it apart to look for mistakes either. Instead, just watch and enjoy it for its content, and the message it delivers to all of us.
B00005LKIM|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!!!  Anthony Hopkins is a spectacular actor and this movie proved that this Academy-Award winning actor has not lost his touch.  I must inform everyone who has not seen it if you are looking for the same horror that we fell in love with in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; this is not the movie for you.  Julianne Moore did a great job considering that she had to pick up after Jodie Foster.  I loved that the way they depicted Italy and I was amazed at the adaption from the book despite the ending.  I recommend that anyone with a strong stomach see this and I plan to watch this for years to come.
B000003BEV|4.0|Mick Jagger and Keith Richards have spoken about what a terrible record this is. The album has been discredited by most rock critics as a wrong detour in the Stones career.   There are a few major problems with the album, which if they had been corrected before the release could have changed everything. If the Stones had eliminated &quot;Sing This All Together&quot; and its sequel &quot;Sing This All Together (See What Happens)&quot; and the unbearable &quot;On With the Show&quot;, and added their song &quot;We Love You&quot;, they would have had a great record. <br />&quot;On With the Show&quot; may be the worst Stone's song ever written, and stands alongside in infamy with the Beatles &quot;You Know My Name, Look Up the Number&quot; (where oddly enough Brian Jones played the saxophone).   In context, the &quot;Sing This All Together&quot; and its sequel are of its time (and has dated very badly). The Stones probably listened to Frank Zappa's first album &quot;Freak Out&quot; (which the Beatles thought was a great record) and heard the entire side that Zappa recorded of just him and his musicians and friends playing around in the recording studio. <br />Listen to the &quot;Freak Out&quot; album for &quot;Help I'm a Rock&quot;, and &quot;Return of the Son of the Monster Magnet&quot; and you get the idea of what the Stones were trying to emulate.<br />In fact, Zappa ... off his producer (Tom Wilson) who said &quot;What the hell are you going to do with all this equipment at one o'clock in the morning?&quot; I don't think Tom Wilson was even there when Zappa recorded his bizarre jam sessions.  <br />Another factor in the Stone's &quot;Together&quot; jams is Brian Jones. Brian Jones was into exotic instruments, and probably wanted to play around with them. I guess at the time Richards and Jagger said okay, and it ended up with them playing around in the studio (probably on acid) recording this crazy stuff. I guess they didn't realize that their playing around would turn off everybody who listened to the record (hearing it once is enough for anybody).<br />All things aside, there are great songs on this album. Jagger and Richards and the rest of the band were at the peak of their career, and they weren't lazy. There is some great guitar work, and lyrical work on this album that stands up well now (although &quot;In Another Land&quot; is dated, but oddly makes fun of itself at the same time).<br />The great songs are Citadel, 2000 Man, She's a Rainbow, Gomper, The Latern, and 2000 Light Years From Home.<br />For some odd reason, Jagger was looking ahead to the year 2000 in a lot of these songs. Why? Was he trying to write songs about what the year 2000 would be like, or was he trying to imagine where he would be in his personal life 33 years in the future? What would his children think of him, given his past? Would they understand him?<br />The masterpiece is &quot;The Citadel&quot; which reminds me of Bob Dylan's &quot;All Along the WatchTower&quot;. It seems to be about a ruler in some sort of castle, isolated from his subjects who are revolting against him. The song also has an element of prophesy about the future. There's a line in the song &quot;..Screaming people fly so fast in their shiny metal cars through the worlds of glass and steel..&quot;. Jagger probably felt we'd have flying cars by now (maybe he watched too many Jetsons episodes).   <br />The song is strangely relevant about the current time; the rich get richer and live in expensive apartments in all the world's cities (like Trump Tower in New York). They isolate themselves from the problems around them (unemployment, the homeless, people with no health insurance, etc.) and they don't get involved (although some do). In a sense we're in a new dark age (which Jagger saw) where multi-billionares control the world, push free trade that results in workers from their own country losing jobs, lay off workers even when business is good, and keep the serbs (meaning the middle class, and lower classes) happy by giving them enough to live a modest existence, and brainwash them with their control of the media.  Governments don't matter anymore; these billionaire rulers are pulling all the strings.   <br />This was always a magical record to me when I was a teenager. I'd sit and stare at the 3d photograph and be transported to another place and time. The songs still hold up well after all this time (I just bought a cd copy and probably haven't listened to the complete album in at least 30 years). The re-mastering is excellent, and let me hear sounds that I missed when I owned the LP version.<br />Listen to it and you'll be surprised; it's the Stones most unique, most experimental, and most visionary record.
B000008LUN|5.0|I was the first among my circle of friends to discover UFO.  Come to think of it I &quot;discovered everything back in those days and loved every minute of it. My biggest thrill though was watching my brother and our friends reactions as I turned them on to yet another great band. UFO is timeless, and this album is their best, it kicks off with Too Young To Know, has the classics Doctor Doctor and Rock Bottom and the overlooked Time on My Hands. Any fan of classc hard rock should have it.  For what it's worth some of my other discoveries around that time were Blue Oyster Cult, GOLDEN EARRING, and the Scorpions

The album is nicly closd with listen, dedicated to his late brother. go buy this now!!!!!!1
B000002L99|5.0|With 1984, the band scored mega success with &quot;Jump&quot;, they learned what the people wanted and musicly Eddie was ready to start moving more into keyboards.<br />1984 was a transitional album. 5150 is the band at it's peak. Sadly many fans get caught up here with the lead singer change. David Lee Roth actually began work on a few of these tracks, prior to leaving. Listening one can only wonder what might have come of that... I believe we would have gotten the most innovative VH album, even if Roth had not left. The band was at it's peak in regard to melody and composition. Sammy came in and filled Roth's shoes very well. Using his voice to go up in high places and compliment Eddies guitar work like never before, and his story-telling style of lryics were always a bit above the bar for &quot;hair bands&quot;. This was the rebirth for Van Halen, and this remains one of the shiniest jewles in the collection.
B000002U8G|4.0|I'm always hesitant to say I like Pink Floyd because the majority of people that know/like Pink Floyd for two of the most overrated works in Rock: &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Wall.&quot; &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; the only of the three deserving the praise it got. Don't get me wrong I like parts of &quot;Darkside of the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Wall&quot; but as wholes they are overdone and contrived. I guess you could call me an early Purist of Pink Floyd because I think their best work can be heard on &quot;Piper At The Gates Of Dawn,&quot; &quot;Meddle&quot;(this album), and &quot;Atom Heart Mother.&quot;<br />&quot;Meddle&quot; opens and closes with the familiar acid induced jams Pink Floyd are loved for but sandwiched between these jams are the most beautiful and playful of Pink Floyd's work. Starting with an acoustic ballad &quot;A Pillow of Winds&quot; which sounds at home with &quot;Wish You Were Here.&quot; &quot;Fearless&quot;(The Charlatans UK rip off a chord in this song!) a slow rocker with mellow landscapes and lyrics. &quot;San Tropez&quot; is the heart of &quot;Meddle,&quot; what is there not to like? It's just a fun happy song combining jazz and early British invasion influence (Hermits Hermits, no?) This song alone is worth the price of the album. &quot;Seamus,&quot; in the vein of Paul McCartney's &quot;Rocky Raccoon,&quot; is a traditional folk song featuring dog barking, yeah I know, but hey it works. <br />&quot;Meddle&quot; is essential in Pink Floyd's catalogue. Also check out &quot;Piper At The Gates Of Dawn,&quot; &quot;Atom Heart Mother,&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here.&quot; Stay away from &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; and &quot;The Wall.&quot;
B00004Y6O9|5.0|This CD is the remastered work of Van Halens first LP. Every song is classic and this remains my favorite of the Roth era albums. The highlight for me is still Eruption; Eddies signature guitar solo that made the world stop and take notice.
B000002UC5|4.0|After buying everything The Beatles recorded, I still could not get enough and soon ventured in The Fab Four's solo careers. At first, I thought John Lennon's work was the only true great work Post-Beatles. I was disappointed at Paul McCartney's work on first impression, I guess I was expecting an &quot;Imagine&quot; after hearing John Lennon's work. George Harrison is great but all his work hasn't been transferred to disc properly yet and it's hard to sum up his work. Ringo Starr, hahaha! is all I have to say to his solo work!<br />Back to the point, Recently I saw Paul McCartney being interviewed on Larry King Live and felt myself connected with him that I never felt before. I soon pulled out my then dusty copy of &quot;McCartney&quot; and gave it another spin. I must say I'm much more impressed this time. I can't believe I could've gone on this far without listening to &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot;(Which is equivalent to McCartney's best work in The Beatles like &quot;Let It Be&quot; and John Lennon's finest) at least once a week. The simple but nonetheless great &quot;That Would Be Something&quot; and the existential &quot;Every Night.&quot; This is not the same record I heard when I bought it. <br />I suppose what throws the listener off are the odd fillers (I hate to call them that but they are) like &quot;Kreen-Akrone&quot; and &quot;Hot As Glasses.&quot; Then again they show the jokester side of Sir McCartney when his not being serious about his music. So in a way it shows that side of McCartney but it fits oddly with such brilliant moments.<br />Bottom line is that if you want at least one McCartney album, this is the one to get. Everyone must hear &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; before they die.
0780626966|5.0|The Nightmare On Elm Street Collection is a terrific boxed set of wonderful classics.  New Line Cinema is da' bomb when it comes to releasing DVDs.  Instead of giving you description of the plots, I'm going to go into extreme detail to talk about this awesome collection, its technical features, special features, extras.  Here goes!<br />First off, each film is presented beautifully on these great disks.  Every movie is properly formatted to have a 1:85:1 widescreen anamorphic format.  Believe me, you're going to get blown away by how superior these disks are to the videos and other disks.  None (NONE!) of the films have any scratches or pops.  I sat watching the original, 17 year old film with my mouth hanging open at the gorgeous prints.  The colors are bright when they need to be, and flawless darkness when that's required. There is almost no grime whatsoever in the dark scenes (the chilling sequence in Part 3 with Freddy's mom talking of Freddy's conception looks wonderful!) and you might question how old these really are.<br />Extra features are great.   On Nightmare 1 you've got a fascinating commentary by the director of photography, actors Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon, as well as director Wes Craven.  This is the same commentary used on the Elite Laserdisk, but who cares?  If this wasn't there, everyone would start complaining (see how mad people are about the Halloween DVD).  Other features include cast and crew biographies.  You've also got this &quot;Jump To A Nightmare&quot; scene navigation.  What this does is jump right to a dream scene, and when it's over, it takes you back to the menu.  I've only used this once, but it's a cool addition to spice stuff up.  On Wes Craven's New Nightmare, you get a very well done commentary from director Wes Craven, who helps point out a ton of the details you may have missed in the movie.  For Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare, you get two (well, I only got one) pairs of 3-D glasses for the conclusion.  It doesn'tlook fantastic, but I enjoy watching the ending the way it was originally seen.  So, there aren't that many extra features on these movie disks, so where are all these awesome extra features?  Why, they're in the eight disk, The Nightmare Series Encyclopedia, of course.  This is the core, the heart of the whole set.  First off, you've got the documentary, &quot;Welcome To Primetime&quot;.  In it, you see interviews with Wes Craven, producer Robert Shaye, actors Heather Langenkamp and Robert Englund,  co-producer Sara Risher, assistant director Rachel Talalay (who would move into the directing chair for Part 6), as well as several other members of the cast and crew.  &quot;Welcome To Primetime&quot; is a highley informative documentary that goes from the conception of Nightmare On Elm Street on the page, to how it made it to film.  After this terrific documentary, you've got he &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, an extremely challenging game where you go around an abandoned school searching out clues, answering questions, and avoiding Freddy, so that you can find all sorts of cool things.  There's an alternate ending for Nightmare 1 (go to the fire door and type in 20) as well as music videos, Freddy's appearance on MTV, interviews with several Freddy fans, Wes Craven, Robert Englund.... oh, the list is endless.  You get a glimse behind the scenes and you can watch Robert rehearsing for certain scenes.  Terrific stuff!  Next, you've got the index, which has behind the scenes footage from all seven films, as well as interviews with such famous directors as Clive Barker and Sean S. Cunningham (Friday The 13th).  There are comparisions of Freddy and Pinhead... lots of cool things.  You've also got all seven theatrical trailers (Nightmares 3 and 5 are teasers) and another alternate ending for Nightmare 1.  The interviews are extremely interesting, and the people being interviwed are quite honest!  Rachel Talalay thinks Nightmares 4 and 5 were weak entries, and Robert Shaye admits that they were stretching the series to far. You also have the awesome Dokken music video &quot;Dream Warriors&quot;, which is just great.  You also have a &quot;Whodini&quot; music video and one from &quot;Fat Boys&quot;.  You'll learn how Wes Craven got the inspriration for Freddy and how part of these movies are true!  Truly, a set of the most informative behind the scenes footage ever gathered together!  <br />The sound on each film is simply stunning.  First, you've got the mono versions for the first three, and the stereo versions for the last four, but then, for all of them, you've got 5.1 surround!  The 5.1 surround adds so much to the expeirence and you'll feel just as thrilled as when you first saw the movies!  Some music you couldn't even hear on viseo, or in mono or stereo, you can finally hear!  A fantastic job has gone into the re-mixing of these films.  Breathtaking.  I totally admire the work done hear by New Line, kudos!  <br />Also included in the box is a commemoritive booklet about the Freddy phonomenon, and featuring and introduction by Robert Shaye, and one by Robert Englund.  They also feature pictures, and the good reviews each film has gotton.  You can also learn some interesting Freddy facts.  <br />So, all in all, even if the completely outstanding, breathaking, interesting, informative, eight disk weren't in here, I'd still give it five stars.  It's just the concept of having every Freddy classic on DVD in this fine picture and sound quality.  The only very small problem is the fact that Nightmare 5 is Rated R, while they could have easily used the Unrated version.  Although that version is pretty much the same, I just thought they'd use the defenitive version, but still, the overall set is so good that you won't beleive it!  Buy it.  Buy it now, because you know that you want it!  And you know what?  It's worth it!<br />If you found my review helpful, please vote for me.  Thanks a lot!
B00004TH6O|5.0|We should be so lucky if more rock and roll records sounded like this.  In a current musical climate of style over substance, Queens of the Stone Age dare to do something that we haven't seen in a long, long, long time.  They have put substance ahead of style with amazing results.  Rated R could be one of the most underrated rock records of the last 15 years.  Hmmm... A rock and roll band with no other agenda of being anything else than what you hear, a great rock and roll band.  It's so refreshing to actually be able to sit down and listen to a CD from start to finish and fall in love with every song.  You can give Rated R any label that you so desire, just buy it and listen to it.  You might find it very hard to extricate from the ears after a while.<br />Highlights:  &quot;Quick and to the Pointless&quot;, &quot;Monsters in the Parasol&quot;, &quot;In The Fade&quot; &amp; &quot;The Lost Art of Keeping A Secret&quot;.
B00005B36H|5.0|I have no idea what people are talking about 'you have to listen to it a few times' yeah right i have been a tool fan for a few years and i loved this right off. It also sadenes me to see that so many tool fans do not have the attention span to sit through the whole album. this deserves a track by track review. The Grude-Great opener sets the mood. the coda combines intelligent but hard giutars trade mark rolling toms and complex bass lines into a melee of wonderful noise. the patient- Starts with a catchy picked guitar riff and explodes into a wall of guitar and soothing vocals as the chorus begins.( eon blue apocalypse is more of an intro to the patient than a song) Mantra- an intro to schism. Schism- Beautifully layered complex giutar Very open snare drum sound adds texture. The coda is the best part of this album it is mind numbingly introcate powerfull and yet so attractive. Parabol- Quietest on the album, strangely eerie and trance enducing. Parabola- Second best on the album acrobatic giutar rolling fluent drums and mellow howls from Manyard create a soothing and rocking atmoshpere. Ticks and Leeches- Slowly builds from continuis fills on the drums. Wailing giutars join and soon find a voice and create a heavy backdrop for Manyard's voice. Lateralis ( or Laterlus depending on when you got it)-The best song strong touching lyrics accompanied by Kirk Hammet meets Rob Flyn guitars. Chorus is just drums and vocals before bass and guitars are added. Disposition- Worst here but still great. Acoustic guitars great a sensitive riff, hardly any vocals. Percussive beat creates perfect background.Reflection-Electronic tinged intro builds up to a classic complex riff. Triad-Pounding guitar, tribal drums quiet wierd sound effects which may or may not be Manyard wailing. Makes me feel like i'm at a tool concert in a jungle for some wierd reason. Faaip de Oiad-Creepy, lots of wierd sound effects and someone talking about area 51 and the apocalypse, not really a track. Go get this, it's the best tool album.
B000002897|5.0|Someday in the not so distant future rock historians will re-discover this CD and listen to the music recorded on the weird digital piece of plastic.  They will love what they hear and will refuse to believe that it was released in 1992.  They will use their time machine to go back in time and right this wrong and rock history will be rewritten.  Please someone from the future who owns a time machine read my plea and make it happen...  <br />Highlights: EVERY SINGLE SONG!
0060934913|1.0|I really disliked this book.  Redundant, distasteful and adolescent.  In one paragragh the author is talking about a class on beef he attended at the Culinary Institute of America and says '...we were the culinary version of the Manson family.  Fortunately, the mutilated reamins of our efforts were -as was all food at CIA - simply passed along to another class.<br />Crude and boring sexual comments abound. The author's narcissism is tiresome.
B000059XY5|5.0|I have been a Batman fan since childhood and at first could not imagine Michael Keaton as Batman. But his two movies were great. I loved Batman returns because of the duo of villains. Both Pfeiffer and De Vito, the only possible penguin, made the movie superb.
0064407667|2.0|This book begins a series with its own style, different from the typical childrens book.  However, this first one is not wonderful.  It was not very funny, the characters were flat, the story just fails to capture the way I expected.  It seems like Lemony Snicket used this book to develope this style of writing.  His next few books are better, though, and go on improving as you go.
6302814359|1.0|this movie had a great plot line. great action. great cast. great dialouge. great special effects. it was really funny. other than these minor points THE MOVIE [was bad].
0802130208|2.0|It won a Pulitzer?  My only explanation for it is that the committee must have figured if *they* couldn't understand it, then it must be good.  But I would disagree.  I swear I wrote an assignment in 9th grade English that was remarkably like this book in style, and it got a 'D.'  I'd have to say this book is different, sure, but ...  It did have a few very wry and funny passages, but overall I didn't like the story or the style.
B000002I2G|4.0|I 'discovered' the doors in the mid 70s of course I knew they existed but had not payed much attention. I rank this album (oops I mean CD) in their top 3 with LA Woman probably being my favorite. I listened to this album alot around 79-80 (yes I called it an album). I just bought it again. Its still 'fresh' sounding to me. Listen to 'Touch Me' for the radio airplay memories. Tracks 6-9 are the 'heart' of it. Most especially 'Wishful Sinful' and of course 'The Soft Parade'.<br />Peace
B000002J1B|4.0|It's a great album, lots of incredible work, namely from Steve Howe and Patrick Moraz; It's definetley, um, different? It's still great, but, in my opinion, doesn't have that &quot;pizzaz&quot; Close To The Edge or Fragile does. Look for &quot;The Yes Album&quot;, &quot;Fragile&quot;, or &quot;Close To The Edge&quot;, especially for new Yes fans. Wait for a while before you jump into &quot;90125&quot;. A quick comment. Nothing against the reviewer who said this is Yes's last truley great album... but GIVE ME A BREAK. Um let's see,(though it got bad hype) Tormato, Going For The One, keys To Asscension (1 and 2)Drama (interesting)....I think the word our friend was looking for was &quot;Yes's last epic, mind-blowing album&quot;...
B00003CXDZ|5.0|With the onset of cable, videos, and DVDs, it's been years since I've felt the need to see multiple viewings of a movie in a theater.  I've seen Moulin Rouge twice in a week, and plan to go at least one more time before it leaves the big screen.  It reminded me of why I love movies, and also how much I have missed splashy, vibrant musicals.  See this film in the theater while you can!  And may I say - can that Ewan MacGregor be ANY CUTER?  When he covered &quot;Your Song,&quot; I thought my heart would pop.
0553573403|5.0|This book, and the following series, are truly excellent.  For anyone who loves those big doorstop series, you cannot miss this one.  Every time I think I've figured Martin out, he tosses something new into the mix.  Everything is lavishly described, from the physical to the political to the legendary.  For anyone else getting slightly bored with The Wheel of Time, this is it.
B000002KMV|4.0|Although lacking the overall class of 1980's &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; there are two classic moments on this album that make it a worthwhile sequel.<br />1. The opening title track in which he talks of people's perception of him (The last album had generated many questions) remains one of my all time favourite Prince songs to this day, it is the blueprint of the &quot;Minneapolis Sound&quot; (Synths, dynamic bass, scratch guitar etc) and given the freedom to jam on the extended album version here it is all the more impressive.<br />2. Also here is the classic Prince ballad &quot;Do Me Baby&quot;, which was the beginning of the trademark Prince ballad and formed the basis of future tour de forces like &quot;Adore&quot;.<br />The rest of the material contains some nice moments like the disco funk work out of &quot;Lets Work&quot; and is pleasant enough. However aside from the two classic tracks aforementioned the album overall is more of a three star rating but the the title track and Do Me Baby's five star perfection result in a four.<br />This album performed as a nice stepping stone to the masterpiece that is &quot;1999&quot;.
B000006045|5.0|album in may of '98.  their show at First Ave that november.<br />menacingfluidicaudiotapestries.  mmmmm.<br />june of 2001.  mezzanine is aging very well.
6305426651|3.0|&quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; is one of the strangest movies ever made.  The first half of the film introduces us to Roberto Benigni's character, the Jewish Italian Guido.  Benigni's performance is immediately captivating and the story of his life in fascist Itlay before the war is lighthearted and quite enjoyable.  Then the Nazis take over his portion of Italy and Guido and his son end up in a concentration camp.  Despite this development, however, the movie's lighthearted tone doesn't change.  In fact, Guido shelters his son from the cold reality of what is going on around them.  This, of course, is utterly implausible and is the biggest flaw in the film.  Though the horrors of the Holocaust are by no means ignored, the unreality of the camp scenes make it difficult to figure out how one is supposed to react to the film.  Ultimately, the film is worthwhile to see Benigni's almost magical performance.  But in no way should the film be mentioned in the same sentence with &quot;Schindler's List&quot; or be at all taken seriously.
B00004YX39|3.0|I know when I talk to a lot of Steely Dan fans that this album is usually considered near the bottom of anyone's list. I suspect that much of that has to do with what was considered to be a letdown from Aja, their previous album that was great in nearly every way. It would have been hard to top that album with any release. As a result, Gaucho gets to take the hit. There is good stuff here with the best being &quot;Babylon Sisters&quot;, &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;, and &quot;My Rival&quot;. Enjoy, and don't amke a decision on this one until you've played it a few times.
0446608955|4.0|This book was so great! It was a bit slow at first and the storyline seemed a bit shallow, but as I learned later, it is far from. I loved how Sparks really brought Landon and Jamie to life through their deep emotions and great love for each other. Sparks'did a wonderful job of capturing the attitude changes of Landons friends and even of Landon. Jamie helped Landon to appreciate the importance of faith especially during a trying time.This book teaches an important lesson for everyone including its readers. This is definitely a must-read!
038533348X|5.0|when you read the book, you understand from which fountain daglas admas draw his ideas. the book is kind of science fiction book, but not quiet so. it uses science fiction plot, but is is more satire on humanity,kapitalisem, comunisem, religions, people and more. it also invented some terms like &quot;ice 9&quot; &quot;cat's cradle&quot;, and ofcouse the all bukonon religion. for conclusion, a very interesting and imaginative book to read.
B000002KLP|5.0|Seemingly tired of the implied naughty sexuality of the first two albums Prince went all out to shock on his third, giving listeners an insight into his &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;. Prince was clearly not going to be a MOR average artist.<br />From the suggestive album cover (Prince in bikini briefs against bed springs) he left the listener in no doubt to what the album theme would be...<br />And this proved the case. Aside from the political statement &quot;Party Up&quot; (Allegedly written by The Time frontman Morris Day), the anti-establishment &quot;Uptown&quot; and the tender ballad &quot;Gotta Broken Heart Again&quot;, it was all sex fuelled relations from there on in. The synth-pop title track opens the album with a clear indication of his future manifesto. Sex would play big a big part of Prince's music for years to come yet.<br />Songs like &quot;Head&quot; (A story of ....) and &quot;Sister&quot; (...) set out to shock from the start. But when the music's this fresh and challenging who was arguing! Well the &quot;Moral Majority&quot; were for one. ;)<br />It was the Beatle-esque pop perfection of &quot;When You Were Mine&quot; that is my undoubted highlight and arguably his best song to date. It was later covered by Cyndi Lauper.<br />By very nature of the topics covered Prince limited his potential fanbase here. So although not as big a seller as the former more commercial based album, Prince declared his will to experiment and push boundaries dramatically. <br />Rough and raw sounding as it is, this remains one of mine and many other Prince fans favourite albums.
6304414048|1.0|Once in awhile a film comes along that is well made, but vile in concept and execution.  &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; is such a movie.  While it is hard to argue that the performances of stars Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue are not first rate, unfortunately they serve a plot which is misogynistic, exceddingly unpleasent and utterly pointless.  Don't get me wrong, there have been some excellent movies that have portrayed destruction through drugs and alcohol.  &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; and &quot;The Boost&quot; are two examples that immediately come to mind.  But &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; not only glamorizes Cage's self-determined destruction through alcohol, but manages to thoroughly degrade Shue's character at the same time.  There is one scene for example , in which Shue is gang raped in a hotel room, that is completely gratutitous.  It doesn't advance the plot and seems to serve no purpose other than showing the filmaker's contempt for her character.  The relationship between the two of them has some tender moments, but ultimately come to no apparent point.<br />Going to the movies ought to be an enjoyable experience, or failing that, it at least ought to be enlightening.  &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; is neither.  It is a degrading peep show of a movie.
B000002L42|4.0|If I recall, many of the reviews in music magazines were less than enthusiastic when this one first came out. I was much more enthusiastic when I first heard it, which wasn't until &quot;Two Against Nature&quot; came out in February of 2000. The group may have rarely toured during their heyday, but that doesn't detract from a live album that came out fifteen years after their last studio album. I love the live versions of &quot;Green Earrings&quot;, &quot;Reelin' in the Years&quot;, &quot;Peg&quot;, &quot;Kid Charlemagne&quot;, &quot;Josie&quot;, and &quot;Aja&quot;. There may be a couple of weaker tracks, but overall this is good listening.
B000002GEY|5.0|Brilliant!!  If you remember buying this the first time round you know what I mean.  If you are buying this for the first time then you are in for a treat.  Each song on the surface appears different but they mix in well on the album.  I cannot pick a favourite but if I was pinned down and forced to it would probably have to be Gone Hollywood.  Superb!!  I promise you will never tire of listening to this one.  &quot;Goodbye Stanger its been nice.....&quot;
B000024D4R|3.0|Yea.. gotta go against the grain here a bit I suppose...   You see the difference between pink floyd and the pink floyd is a great one, Syd Barrett.  Yes I know you have heard it all before and you know what, too bad.  This album is bloated and boring, there was a reason punk bands were against floyd, they were dinosaurs.  I have most of the floyd albums up to dark side and hands down Piper at the gates is the best.  Syd is a better guitar player than Gilmour, not technically but in terms of having a style all his own.  Syd barrett could write excellent three minute pop songs something post syd floyd never could do.  Believe me its easier to draw out a guitar solo than cutting out the excess and distilling a song into a three minute gem.  As far as I am concerned floyd was running out of steam back in 73 and by this album they were a shell of what they were in 67.  It's really a shame about poor syd......what the pink floyd could have been...........
B000002KY8|5.0|With &quot;Sign O' The Times&quot; this is Prince's true masterpiece!<br />From the apocalyptic disco funk of the title track with its infectious synthline and distinctive three way split vocal you know your in for a special ride!<br />This segues into one of my favourites of all time &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot;. This is a supreme pop song, how infectious is that hook! How haunting are those opening synths! :)<br />Next up was the catchy Rockabilly of &quot;Delirious&quot; which goes into the X-Rated &quot;Lets Pretend We're Married&quot;.<br />Other highlights on this consistent album include the funk chant of &quot;DMSR&quot;, &quot;Free&quot; (The blueprint for &quot;Purple Rain&quot;), Funky guitar led &quot;Lady Cab Driver&quot; and the class ballad &quot;International Lover&quot; (Prince ballads have always been very consistent since &quot;Do Me Baby&quot;).<br />Throughout the album the use of the experimental Linn Drum machine gives it a very unique sound, coupled with his distinctive synthlines, Prince's &quot;Minneapolis Sound&quot; was truly in effect! Sales wise it fared well on the back of success of &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; (A big part in black artists getting on MTV). <br />This initial break through allowed the mega-stardom of &quot;Purple Rain&quot; to follow but artistically this album outdoes even that in my opinion.
B000002C1W|5.0|Floyd was learning to fly in the best possible way.  They rock so hard, and yet...some of this is so soothing and soft.  light as a feather, and heavier than thoreau.  kudos!
B000056K04|5.0|Not being a hard-core DMB fan maybe I'm able to enjoy this release a little more non-objectionably.  Hey folks, lighten up, this is GREAT MUSIC.  Look at the alternatives out there.  This cd has been a mainstay in my car for 2 weeks since I bought it.  Believe me, I'm having a very hard time finding new music that inspires me in any way.  The Space Between is worth the price of admission alone, if you ask me.  But this album has so much more to offer than that- there is just a great jive on this work that I really enjoy.  I think what it comes down to is this-If you are a hard-core DMB fan and have a pre-conceived notion of what you think DMB is supposed to sound like then maybe this is a disappointment to you because it doesn't fit his usual acoustic formula.  But if you are a music fan that's looking for some really good grooving, thoughtful, insightful tunes, with fantastic musicianship thrown in, this just might just be the thing to make you a DMB fan. I just think some of his fans are being a little closed-minded with their thoughts on this album.  Dave Matthews IS an artist, and TRUE artista aren't content to sit around and and re-hash their same work over and over, just to satisfy the status-quo.  Be glad that he pushes the boundaries,because there are very few artists out there right now doing it. I think it's an awesome album, and will hopefully attract a whole new legion of fans.
B00004XONN|2.0|Just when you thought that the music press had gotten over the &quot;if it's British and trendy, it must be fab&quot; disease, along comes the heralding of Radiohead's &quot;Kid A&quot; as a masterpiece. When Radiohead put their minds to it, they can product amazing, beautiful, sharp-edged Pop. This isn't it. THIS is a bad art-pop experiment, with only two actual songs, that is just overtly &quot;arty&quot; enough to dupe people into thinking it has a point. Surprise. It doesn't.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|I know there are a lot of people out there who will tell you things like &quot;this movie is hilarious&quot; or &quot;It's a masterpiece&quot; or &quot;I watched this movie one night and the next day the cyst was gone!&quot;  Don't listen to them.  This movie is the embodiment of what's wroong with the modern american comedy.  The jokes are WAY too obvious.  There is absolutely no subtlety whatsoever in this movie.  Instead of the subtle, intelligent kind of humor we see in movies like &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and &quot;Tootsie&quot;, we find a battering-ram-at-the-castle-gates kind of humor, wherein they beat you over the head with the comedy without generating even one honest, genuine chuckle.  Gone are the days of wittier spoofs like &quot;Airplane!&quot; and &quot;The Naked Gun.&quot;  Instead, we have this load of gross-outs and fart jokes that actually succeeds at being less funny than the Carrot Top movie.  And you know what the worst part is?  It's still a better movie than anything Adam Sandler ever made.  Groan.
B000002GZ1|5.0|It's only too easy to overrate the original Butterfield Blues Band, who kick-started the original mid-1960s blues revival and, as it happens, sent the folk \\"revival\\" of the earlier part of the decade all but packing as a mass phenomenon, both with their own electrifying workshop performances at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival and with a few of them (guitarist extraordinaire Mike Bloomfield, drummer Sam Lay, and bassist Jerry Arnold) limbering up behind Bob Dylan for the latter's long-legendary electric set. But there's no overrating the Butterfield gang's music or debut album - almost forty years after the sextet first laid it out, it's riveting, elemental, and demands to be heard all through each layer of the thrustingly sensitive sound. <br />They may have anchored themselves with Howlin' Wolf's rhythm section (Lay and Arnold), but Butterfield's heart seemed more to belong to Little Walter, both in the preponderance of Walter's material covered (and with reverence but not redundancy) here and in elements of his own harmonica style. (As it happened, Butterfield, Bloomfield, and second guitarist Elvin Bishop had each known, played with, and learned from the Chicago electric blues masters previously, and never lost the old masters' respect.) Bloomfield, of course, was already an outsized talent in his own right - he's not quite the sleek, polished old pro who would go from drop-dead to existentially expressive (by way of his luminous work with first the Electric Flag and, later, the Al Kooper \\"Super Session\\" projects), but he's exuberant, committed, and passionate, and he's already figuring out how to temper his chops and subordinate them to taste and to melodiousness in his solos by the time the set begins to wind down. Not that it's so bad when he just lets fly - in fact, he's the main instigator behind \\"Screamin',\\" possibly the wildest instrumental to spring up from any of the decade's blues revivalists, both as its co-composer and its prime cattle prod, dropping off a solo here and there to deliver little sharp stings to either Butterfield (with some choice harmonica sweeps and cries), Bishop (an occasional spiky lick here and there and effectively), and keyboard ace Mark Naftalin while letting the rhythm section whomp it up shamelessly.<br />Still, the band was wholly accessible, from the romping \\"Shake Your Moneymaker\\" to the strolling \\"Last Night\\"; from the rocking \\"Born in Chicago\\" to the galloping \\"Thank You, Mr. Poobah\\"; from the dripping \\"Our Love Is Drifting\\" to the bristling boogie joyousness of Sam Lay taking the vocal for \\"Got My Mojo Workin'.\\" Butterfield was a passable vocalist with perhaps more feeling than voice, but he proved himself a legitimate comer as a blues harp specialist and bandleader. That the elders from whom he and his merry men learnt their blues directly accepted them as one of their own testifies even more potently to how powerful this album was then...and now. But even without its time-and-place importance, it's just good music.

0395759242|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It is just about the best-written work of non-fiction that I have ever read. <br />Tired of reading about the atrocities of colonialism? Feel like you've read it all before? Brace yourself. You will be shocked by the holocaust that took place in the Congo. You will be shocked that such evil could have happened so recently - barely a century ago - and already have been largely forgotten.
B00004W19V|5.0|this movie brings back memorys. i have allways loved this movie. some of the jokes in it still make me laugh, &quot;cult 45, semi auto matic, play doh!&quot;. a great movie and an overal good dvd edition. could be a bit better with deleted scenes and trailers but a good dvd. at least see this movie on tape. this is a classic that should live on a long time!
B0000026WD|2.0|The problems that surfaced on Bad are exacerbated on Dangerous:  1) To continue to outdo himself in product sales and hype; 2) competition with sister Janet leads to a less organic and more percussive sound; 3) insistence on most songs to try to emulate the Jimmy Jam 80's production.  While it worked with the Time and was popular with Janet, it doesn't fit Michael Jackson's vocal talents; 4) probably as a result of 2 and 3 the songs are far less melodic, the production monotonous and uninteresting as Quincy Jones is sorely missed.  I would have given the album ONE star, but for the fabulous &quot;Remember the Time&quot; with tight vocal harmony overdubs by MJ.  If this is your first Michael Jackson do yourself a favor and get &quot;Off the Wall.&quot;

B00005BJC7|5.0|The amazing thing about Radiohead is how they reinvent themselves. Most people will call this album Kid B, and that isn't a bad thing. It feels like a spinoff rather than a sequel with more of a focus on rhythm and beat than lyrics.  Pakt Like Sardines In A Tin Box starts the CD off with a clean beat and the lyrics &quot;I'm a reasonable man get off my case&quot; in a quiet voice. Throughout the CD, the lyrics are softer and, in my opinion, compose better songs than that of Kid A. &quot;Morning Bell/Amnesiac&quot; also adds another spin to a track that was on Kid A. As I mentioned before, the songs seem reinvented in a new style that is more of a preference to me than Kid A was.  The finale of Amnesiac finished off with &quot;Life In A Glasshouse&quot; with a clever use of trumpets to make the off-beat and somewhat humorous lyrics keep you interested. And to answer the question: yes, the song is about people living in a glass house. Very clever. My one problem with the CD is that it is too short. However, I like to focus on different aspects of the songs which means it has an excellent replay value.  I suggest you buy the CD if you want variations of Kid A, but if OK Computer was more of your style, this album goes farther from the OK Computer path.
B00003CXRP|4.0|The only reason I gave this movie 4 starts instead of 5 is cause I didnt really like the ending.  The movie itself touched on so many levels and had so many lessons to be learned.  The film basically tought that material things like our technology and the possesions that we take for granted really arent important.   The film itself was very well done.  Robert Z.  is so talented and the camera work is amazing.  The settings are gorgeous, the plane crash is terrifying... makes you feel like your there. Tom Hanks.......is incredible.  You truly get to see his acting ability sense for most of the movie is only other supporting actor is a volleyball.  Tom brings the feelings and emotions of being a castaway to the audience through his acting. The DVD is self has many extra features and in all is one of the best i own. This is a must buy.
B000002B82|5.0|When u first pop this in ur CD player u will be blown away!!  Ozzy's still got it (whatever \\"it\\" is) I wouldn't say this is my favorite Ozzy album, because I love them all about equally because they all are as different as night and day from each other.  This is a solid metal album, some people say Ozzy is rock, not metal, but every Ozzy album is metal.  No More Tears has everything u need in a metal album, insanly heavy songs and soft songs.  I don't recomend new Ozzy fans to purchase this album first.  The first album that u purchase should be Blizzard of Ozz.  Zakk Wylde is an awesome guitarist and is up there with Randy Roads. R.I.P. Randy <br />The Ozz man is still above all competition, rock on Ozzy!!
B00003CXRP|5.0|I have been amazed (as us all) to see the absolute incredible evolution in the career of Tom Hanks.  No one would have guessed that this &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; actor would ever turn out to be the greatest actor of our times.  Sure, Tom drifted once-and-a-while to scripts that should be better left unmentioned.  But Tom has evolved.<br />His movies are successful because we are comfortable with Tom in front of our eyes.  He is one of those actors that does not become type-cast or predictable.  He IS the part he plays...and we believe him and want him to be that character.  When he played Jim Lovell in Apollo 13, he was Jim Lovell.  Get my point?  We welcome Tom into our homes and into our lives because he has gives us an enormous gift every time he does another movie.<br />And in Cast Away, he surpasses our already high expectations with an outstanding and demanding performance.  I have watched this movie numerous times, and each time gives me a warm and pleasant feeling.  Bravo, Tom, for making our lives richer through your superb acting and superb selection of the films you make.
0800103661|5.0|Great science fiction film!  I enjoyed the thoroughly creative storyline.  It's an intriguing and unique vision of the future.  I've seen the film several times and never been bored.  Jude Law gives a wonderfully convincing performance.
B00003CXP1|4.0|At once compelling and repellent at the same time, Darren Aronofsky's &quot;Requiem For A Dream&quot; has been billed as one of the best films of 2000. Fusing MTV-inspired editing, stylised cinematography, a hip-hop score given added grace thanks to some strings and stirringly effective performances from the cast, director Aronofsky has made an unforgettable piece of cinema that deserves to be seen at least once by everyone.<br />Playing like an extremely demented Aphex Twin video (without the absurdist hilarity), Aronofsky makes his actors honourably play perversion-parade for his opus as they misplace their hope of escaping from their mundane lives into chemical charms, from heroin, to coke, to dieting pills. Aronofsky does the right thing in not plumping for the audience's sympathy too much and even in the finale switches from sly comedy to full blown horror with panache. That said, Aronofsky delivers the harrowing moments impeccably also, with the help of some fine editing from Jay Rabinowitz, Matthew Libatique's haunting cinematography and Clint Mansell's brilliant score. Carrying the film though, the actors play their parts just as well, especially Jared Leto and Ellen Burstyn, the former making full use of his big blue eyes to suggest a sweet hope that is tragically tempered by his aimless actions. Burstyn however makes the film hers, especially in the final moments when the audience is shown what she has finally been reduced to; no wonder she announced upon winning Best Female Lead at the Independent Spirit Awards earlier this year that this was &quot;the role of my career&quot;.<br />Film has been attacked for its easy moralising (&quot;Drugs are bad, mmmkay?&quot;), but in his descent into the lowest depths of pop culture hell, Aronofsky gives us a visually resplendent reminder of what the medium of cinema can achieve, if not one of the best school education films about drugs ever made.
1565113306|4.0|I remember the first time I saw the movie &quot;Fight Club.&quot; It changed the way I not only viewed movies, but also the way I viewed the world. As soon as I was done watching it I watched it again, because of the surprise obviously, and because I thought it was one of the smartest and darkest movies I had ever seen. I needed to buy the book, because everytime I've ever read a book it was better than the movie. When I got the book I was very surprised to see Edward and Brad's pictures on the cover, yeah, the movie was based on the book, but in no way can you watch the movie and follow along in the book. I'm happy to say, the book was even darker than the movie, which surprised me because David Fincher makes some of the darkest movies around. The main character in the book is much more messed up in the head than Edward played him. The style of writting here is different than any I've ever seen. It took me three nights to read Fight Club, and as soon as I finished it I bought another one of Chuck's novels.<br />Great book!
0783223218|3.0|Bruce Willis gives a good performance as a cold blooded hired killer in this film.  I say &quot;good&quot; instead of &quot;fantastic&quot; because I still couldn't hate him.  Nor was he particularly frightening.  However, he was a clever criminal with smart gadgets and mildly impressive disguises.  The movie is not lacking of intelligent characters or good action sequences.  There are no dull moments and I loved the bit of a surprise at the end.  <br />However, there are two reasons I give the film three stars instead of five.  First of all, the storyline is rather weak.  The film centers around one major hit that Bruce Willis is supposed to make yet the greater portion of the movie deals with his simply preparing for the hit.  While action still abounds, it leaves the viewer to wonder if you will ever get to the actual job.  Why he needed such a special and expensive gun is never explained.  The viewer is also left to wonder what happened to the Russian criminal that hired Bruce Willis in the first place.  The final reason I gave this film only three stars is Richard Gere.  While I like Gere and his acting, I do have to wonder why anyone would have him play an Irishman.  His accent was pathetic at best.

B00005ASOC|4.0|I often wondered whether this movie would only be both fully forgiven for its flaws and appreciated for its strengths by frustrated novelists and authors like yours truly.  Lines like Jamal's to Sean Connery: \\"So women will sleep with you just if you write a book?,\\" answered with, \\"Women will sleep with you if you write a BAD book...\\" go straight to the heart, and made me laugh out loud (much to the chagrin of my girfriend).  Luckily, the star of this film is not Sean Connery or the new actor in the supporting/main role.  The star is not the setting in New York, nor is the film stolen by the master character actor F. Murray Abraham.  The film's star isn't the screenplay, despite some of its stellar moments.  And for ... sure it ain't the editing, which had me straining the forgiveability factor at times; it went a little past the attempt at purposely looking rough and raw to just being rough and raw as if we were looking at an unfinished film made by college students.<br />The start of this film is the relationship between the two characters, who thankfully transcend the easily formulaic aspects of their surface identities and pre-prescribed social roles to become true artists and powerful friends.  True, they had no choice but to go there:  a simple and simple-minded \\"experienced but fatally flawed reclusive White intellectual saves a ghetto Black youth with uncommon promise\\" would have had the effect of filming an upper middle class cocaine party in the suburbs for the benefit of undercover detectives.  A majority White audience would have gotten high off of both the liberal guilt transformed via it cathartically dancing with the hypo-cortical (smile) feelings of racial superiority that produced it, but they would have been too ashamed at getting busted after the fact by the Black intelligentsia for the movie--or today's culture--to escape unscathed or anyone to enjoy the memories. And reality is reality: THE KARATE KID and GOOD WILL HUNTING are both such wonderful variations on the unlikely mentor/student of life theme that you don't need to see anyone miss at another attempt at equalling them, let alone surpass them--and they would have to be equalled for the film to be entertaining.  (Particularly when, in this racial surface context, a director will be immediately accused of the sin of commission delineated a few sentences above, even if he simply committed the sin of ommitting the spark of new life that would prevent it from being valid.)<br />That is what makes this movie so special.  The courage it took to take all of that on, and focus on what makes all human relationships worth having in the context of what makes artists artists--not to mention what makes art (in this case, the written word) so important, is almost worth congratulating by itself.  But not resting on the laurels of such courage and creating a moving and instructive film that still profoundly entertains and illuminates at its best moments with true character development (though they could have been developed even more I think), is what makes this a film worthy of owning. They say a lot of wonderful things in this movie, in very entertaining and enjoyable, truly satisfying ways.<br />I liked it.erful variations on the unlikely mentor/student of life theme that you don't need to see anyone miss at another attempt at equalling them, let alone surpass them--and they would have to be equalled for the film to be entertaining.

084317420X|5.0|Back in college I got a job as a summer janitor at the local elementary school. One of the things I had to do was clean up in the library. I took this time as an opportunity to catch up on some reading... in the form of the Mr. Men series. Mr. Impossible is the story of a man who can do it all. Assuming you define all as things that you can't do. He will delight and entertain with his antics!
B00003CXRP|4.0|Tom Hanks looks back to one of the greaters characters of the 1990's, Forrest Gump, to play an affable, obsessive Fed Ex employee who becomes stranded on a desert island for four years.<br />Forrest Gump explored a complex world where he learned that making a few significant friendships and finding a true love overcome one's ostensible intelligence or the power of money or fame.<br />In this film Tom Hanks encounters an empty world (or island) where he learns that making a friendship with a volleyball and remember his true love can keep him alive when the loneliness is so great.<br />This is a fine film, with a breathtaking performance by Hanks. However, outside of Hanks rendition of his Forrest Gump character in a new world (or at least place), the film is quite empty. <br />Sentiments abound, and one does not feel Hanks' plight in the film.<br />The film excites but does not provoke. A good movie, but one that is not tolerable to view more than once or twice.   If you enjoy DVD's, then definitely get this.

B00003CXRP|3.0|I haven't read the reviews of this movie.  I just assumed since it made well over $100 million in the United States, and everyone loves Tom Hanks so much, that the majority of people rated it very highly.<br />I didn't have great expectations for this film.  When a movie is really good, it exceeds those expectations.  This one did not.<br />Basically, the movie is about one and a half hours too long.  The one and a half hours that are too long are those that take place on the island in the South Pacific.  I can't for the life of me see how a movie about a guy stranded on an island where there aren't any cannibals or wild animals craving human flesh can be exciting...and this isn't.<br />The movie is an absolute drag for Hanks' duration on the island.  I mean, is building a fire, taking ten minutes of film to figure out how to open a coconut, or finding a cave when there's a torrential downpour entertainment?  i didn't really think so...but I'm not a fan of the CBS show 'Surviving' either.<br />I knew I was in trouble when the FedEx plane crashes in the middle of the Pacific Ocean during a tropical storm...rough waters...and the entire fusolage remained intact.  I like a little realism with my films.<br />I enjoyed the movie when he wasn't in an airplane or on an island...which is probably about thirty to forty minutes...that's good and relatively interesting.<br />Good luck.
B00004XQ83|5.0|BEST CD I HAVE EVER HEARD.  WE NEED THE MEDIA TO PUT OUT MORE GOOD OLD TIME MUSIC LIKE THIS, THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LOVE THIS TYPE OF MUSIC. SINCE GOOD COUNTRY MUSIC SEEMS TO BE GONE, THIS SHOULD REPLACE IT
0446310786|5.0|As soon as I began To Kill a Mockingbird during the summer of eigth grade, I was skeptical. Being someone who had NEVER enjoyed any of the books we had to read in school, I was not looking forward to it. I began it after a sour experience of reading &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; and was expecting the worst. I could not have been more wrong.<br />The simple but meangingful experiences of Scout Finch et al touched me on a personal level. The deeper meaning of this book is something we can all learn from. In the first half of the book, no huge events really take place, but it's the smaller ones that set the tone of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. There are a few incedents where people try to get Scout to conform, like when her first grade teacher is upset that she can read already and thinks she shouldn't be able to. Throughout the story, the motif of thinking for oneself and separating from the crowd pop up in different scenarios. This book may seem to move more slowly than you might like. I think Harper Lee did this for a reason. Don't buy the cliffnotes, folks. See for yourself.
B000002OVJ|4.0|After throughly listning to Leeds, I have to say that this isnt one of the best live albums Ive listened to, but certainly one of the most exciting. the inexaustable Moon pounding away on his drums, arms flailing...Pete's exellent rythem guitar, arm windlmilling wildly...and last but certainly not least...John Entwhistle, standing silently in the corner, hands moving up and down the longest bass fret board in rock...is some of the most incredible musicianship Ive witnessed.

B00003OSTN|5.0|Mildred Pierce's second husband, Monte Beregon, is dead.  And so the story unravels as Mildred tells her &quot;story&quot; to the police. It's all a mysterious cover-up.  And is worth watching to the very end! I loved this movie!!! If you are a fan of the &quot;classics&quot;, this is one of the greatest I've seen.  Joan Crawford plays Mildred.  She has two daughters, Veda and Kay.  Her husband up and leaves them, and now Mildred must get a job.  Kay catches a bad case of pneumonia, and dies.  Veda, who is the older daughter, doesn't turn out to be such a nice girl.  She grows into a coniving young woman, who bribes someone for money so she can get away from her embarrassment of a mother. Veda is played by Ann Blyth...What an actress!!! Veda is evil to the core, and Blyth really pulls it off. I'd hate to give to much of this movie away!  It's a must see!! This movie is brilliantly photographed, and Joan Crawford is totally awesome as Mildred.  I haven't seen many of her films, but it's clear that Crawford is in her prime here.  She really plays this character to the extreme.  She certainly did deserve the Oscar! The screenplay of this movie is great for it's time, and has some hilarious lines that are delivered dead on by the actor's.  This is &quot;film noir&quot; at it's best.  Go rent it!!! You won't be disappointed.
B000050HTO|5.0|I am not Bob Dylan's biggest fan by any stretch, but this is a great collection. It contains a bit of everything you either love or hate about his style. <br />I never much cared for the early acoustic only material, but if you listen to his progressive stuff from 1965 on, you will find that this CD collection turns out to be a great one to listen to while driving. Besides Like a Rolling Stone, Lay Lady Lay, Positively 4th Street and all of his other biggest hits, the long tracks Hurricane, Tangled Up in Blue and Shelter from the Storm are well- paced and well-performed numbers for the guy or gal with a long journey ahead.<br />A perfect, eclectic blend of tunes for many music fans young and not-so-young, it is strongly recommended especially for lovers of stars such as Springsteen, Ryan Adams (not Bryan), Janis Joplin and Johnny Cash.
B000002UQJ|3.0|When I purchased this CD, I was hoping that Paul McCartney, after a highly acclaimed Flowers in the Dirt from 1989 and a well-executed world tour, would achieve the level of success that he had obtained some 11 years earlier with Tug of War. He did not. Commercially, Off the Ground did not take off. It peaked at only #17 in the Billboard 200 and no Top 40 hits were spawned (save Hope of Deliverance on the Adult Contemporary Chart at #9).<br />On a disappointing critical note, Q magazine gave it a mere 2 out of 5 stars. At the time, I agreed. After seeing Paul McCartney show ambition and drive on stage and knowing that he was taking his time on studio creativity, I was expecting an outcome that would relive moments of Band on the Run, Venus and Mars, and Ram. <br />Eight few years have passed, and this release has grown on me quite a bit. I always did like Hope of Deliverance and the added tracks cowritten by Elvis Costello, but I have also come to regard Winedark Open Sea and I Owe It All to You as two of McCartney's finest solo attempts to blend in pensive soft guitar rock with contemporary blues. <br />All in all, I think that Off the Ground will be regarded as a gem that reveals a few of the many diverse talents and musical forms that only Paul McCartney can take on. Perhaps those issues whose critics gave it lackluster reviews will one day have reviewers who will hold it in higher regard. I mean, look at how McCartney's first self-titled solo album, which was frequently panned 31 years ago, is now embraced.
B00003CXDZ|4.0|\\"Moulin Rouge\\" is not just the most visually stunning movie I've seen this year, but, it's one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen! To me, visually at least, it's ranks up there with Kubrick's two amazing masterpieces; \\"2001:A Space Odyssey\\", and \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", and to mention a more recent film, it's up there with last year's \\"Goya In Bordeaux\\". This movie to me also, is one the greatest love stories ever told! Comparable to \\"classics\\" like \\"An Affair To Remember\\" and recent movies like \\"Titanic\\". Infact, this movie to me, is a love story of \\"TITANIC\\" portions! I usually don't give such high credit to more recent films, I save all my appreciation for \\"classic\\" movies like \\"Gone With The Wind\\", \\"The Godfather\\", and \\"Casablanca\\" to name a few. But, I have to give credit where it's due. \\"Moulin Rouge\\" I feel is going to be a definate front runner for the Oscar's this year. The directing by Baz Luhrman is wonderful. It carries an almost demonic energy !with it. You can tell this is a movie made by a man of great skill. Everyone it seems has been talking about Luhrman lately. He is a director who is almost sorta starting a \\"new wave\\" of cinema. He doesn't make his movies they way most Hollywood filmmakers do. The acting between Nicole Kidman (Satine) and Ewan McGregor (Christian) is wonderful. They have certain moments were the both of them seem to play very well of each other. As I've been reading through some other reviews for this movie, it seems many feel McGregor was the highpoint. I have to agree. For as much as I wanted to like Kidman, they was something missing. Everyone has seen the ad's for the movie, well, there's a line in the movie that Kidman says, and it goes along the lines of, she can make herself into whatever men want her to be. That's sorta how I see her performance. You can quite make her out. Which is a shame, because her role could of been a real knockout! There's fine supporting performances by Jim Bro!adbent (Zidler) and Richard Roxburgh (Duke of Monroth) each of whom are very amusing in their roles. But besides the great acting in the movie the real reason to go see this movie is for the unbelieveable effects. The cinematography in this movie is true Oscar material. If it doesn't win an award I will be shocked. The special effects are truly special indeed. \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is quite no question one of the best films of 2001.

B000053VAF|1.0|I really did have high hopes going into the viewing of this movies.  Were those hopes met?  NO WAY.  I really can't imagine anyone enjoying this movie.  It's a &quot;dark comedy&quot; as the two creators would like to think.  But Dark Comedies usually are intelligent and thought provoking, if not always entertaining.  This movie is simplistic and wraught with poor performances.  From the creators of the MALLRATS and CLERKS, I expected better.  All they could get out of great talents such as Linda Fiorentino, Chris Rock, and to a lesser degree Ben Affleck and Matt Damon is a monotonal emotionless walk-through of the script.<br />This movie is the BOMB...er I mean A BOMB.
B00005BCPC|5.0|In many reviews I read about this film, the reviewers commented on or were irate over the extreme difference between it and Austen's original story. I have not read Jane's version, though, so I am describing my reaction to the film itself, entirely basing my love for it on the story as it is portrayed on the screen. And what a love it is that I have for that story. Besides its astonishing visual and auditory beauty, including the actors and actresses, the stunningly artistic cinamatography, the costumes, and the music there is an undercurrent of a senseless beauty throughout the tale. Fanny Price's character is amazing. She has this natural morality that is so refreshing. She is very real, she is both strong and vulnerable. She has the capacity to hurt and to be hurt, and both of these aspects are shared in the movie. Frances O'Connor's acting has a rare quality of honesty to it- a complete devotion to her character and her situation. I think that is what makes the piece what it is. It is not just candy for the senses. It is a feast of truth, which, though beautiful, is never sacrificed for beauty's sake.  This is a film that I cannot do justice to through explaining. All I can say is it should not be overlooked, even by diehard Jane Austen fans, for it is a masterpiece by itself. It is that strong. Just let it work its magic and a miracle will happen.
0060922583|5.0|This book did change my view of reality.  After a very minor but quite possibly 'paranormal' incident happened to me. I went on a search to find an explanation.  This is where I found it.  Granted, this book basically answers any question you could possibly have but it lead my to the works of David Bohm.  This book contains some of the most revolutionary ideas I've ever seen and comes off not sounding (for the most part) like it was written by a guy who's done way too many drugs.  Contained within its pages are the answers to problems of physics, philosophy, religion, and probaly who killed JFK if you look hard enough.  The only problem is much of what Talbot says can never be proven. Think of reality as being a wave and what we can see and understand is simply the crest.  If this image intrigues you at all buy this book.

However, the picture was disjointed, and I will have to admit that I never read Homer's Odyssey, so my review of the movie itself could be flawed, but that's how I saw it. <br />I don't ever feel that George Clooney is ever believeable in anything he has done, from ER to this. He appears to be acting the part instead of being &quot;in&quot; the part, and being believable in his role.

B000059XYA|3.0|This sequel to 1978's &quot;Superman&quot; was planned from the beginning, tying into the fate of the three Kryptonian criminals banished by Superman's father Jor-El in the original. Most people know how &quot;Superman II&quot; had a troubled production, with original director Richard Donner fired by the producers, Richard Lester brought in as his replacement, John Williams bowing out as composer, and Marlon Brando's scenes cut because of a contract dispute. Mario Puzo's story, which logically continues the plot that began in the first &quot;Superman&quot;, keeps the film together and makes it far superior to the subsequent sequels, but the viewer gets the feeling that the film could have been better.<br />The original &quot;Superman&quot; was over two and a half hours long as it recounted Superman's origin and introduced all the characters. By comparison, &quot;Superman II&quot; runs at a lean two hours and gets straight to the action. Superman (Christopher Reeve) saves reporter Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and Paris from nuclear terrorists. He tosses a detonating H-bomb into outer space, unwittingly freeing three renegade Kryptonians, the megalomaniac General Zod (Terence Stamp), the sadistic female Ursa (Sarah Douglas), and the brutish mute Non (Jack O'Hallorhan), from their imprisonment in the Phantom Zone. The evil Kryptonians, possessing all of Superman's powers under Earth's yellow sun, set out to conquer Earth and seek revenge on the son of their jailer, Jor-El.<br />Meanwhile, criminal genius Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) escapes from prison, determined to seek revenge against Superman. He tracks down Superman's Fortress of Solitude and learns of the Kryptonian outcasts. At the same time, Lois learns that Clark Kent is really Superman. The two profess their love for each other and Superman volunteers to give up his powers using a Kryptonian device so that he and Lois can be together. All of the various sub-plots combine in an entertaining climax that is the kind of over the top action taken straight out of a comic book. As for the denouement, it is surprisingly sad and moving.<br />It's nice to see a comic book movie that combines special effects, action sequences, AND a story about human relationships. The actors are well cast and play their parts well. The script can be funny, touching, and thrilling. Most &quot;Superman&quot; stories suffer from the realization that Superman is more powerful than any of his enemies. Here, the Man of Steel is pitted against three villains with all of his powers, and so he must use his wits and courage to defeat them.<br />However &quot;Superman II&quot; has many weaknesses that keep it from reaching its full potential. There are some moments of corny slapstick injected into the film that just don't work. Some scenes seem to have been cut out, leaving many plot holes. It is never fully explained how Superman gets his powers back. Valerie Perrine's Eve Tessmaucher and Ned Beatty's Otis are brought back only to disappear again. Superman and the evil Kryptonians display powers never shown in the comic book or previous film. And how did the Kryptonian villains learn to speak English? The jumpy plot raises several questions, which are never answered.<br />Little problems abound. John Williams's soaring music is muted by Ken Thorne's lacklustre work, the title sequence is simply a rehashing of clips from the first film, and Marlon Brando's Jor-El is absent, unfortunate considering the Kryptonian criminals are motivated by revenge against him.<br />All in all, &quot;Superman II&quot; is a fun film and better than most sequels (certainly better than &quot;Superman III&quot; and &quot;IV&quot;), but it could have, and should have, been better. The epic grandeur and awe from the first &quot;Superman&quot; is missing. Unfortunately, the ultimate legacy of the &quot;Superman&quot; series is the law of diminishing returns.
0671027573|5.0|What a wonderful sexy, titillating, suspenseful story.  Quite a departure from Linda Howard's former genre but she is a master at this type of writing just as she is a master of the more serious stories.<br />Jaine Bright and three of her friends make a list they require in a perfect mate.  Somehow this list is released to the news media and much publicity is derived from this.  In the interim Jaine meets her next door neighbor, Sam, who she believes is a drunk, junkie, whatever, although she later learns he is a police detective.  The sparks fly.  The scene wherein Jaine views a naked Sam through her kitchen window is one of the funniest, sexiest scenes I have read.  I laughed till the tears rolled.<br />Meanwhile, a very disgruntled sick person, takes the characteristics in the list personally and decides to systematically kill the four women.  The plot runs from very serious and scary to funny.  The ending will not surprise you. I suspected the murderer early in the book but it made the reading no less interesting.<br />Keep up the good work Linda Howard.  My favorites of her books are Sarah's Child and Shades of Twilight.  I have to add this one to the list.
0684857820|5.0|The author is not only clear about her experience, she maintains her perceptions of those around her as they struggle to reconcile their feelings of her experience.  Being the victim is hard enough to deal with.  Facing the inability of others to deal with and support her painful experience and emotional transition of healing, and having to be the strong one for others in her quest to move forward is a testimonial to her inner strength that this tragedy obviously brought to surface.  &quot;Lucky&quot; is a thought provoking and inspiration read.
B000051VWW|5.0|That soulful, moody sax is still there, but the synth pads of old have given way to piano-type keys and more rhythm guitar, One thing still defines a Sade arrangement, though--that funky, pulsating bass and drum sound--more of the libido than the visceral sound of rock and rap. And the songs themselves still speak of the heart as well as the body. It's been said that Madonna's act is centered on sex, but hers is the hot sex of backseat wrestling bouts--&quot;gittin' it on&quot;. A score to brag about to your buddies. Sade's sound is perhaps just as sexual, but it's warm sex--better known as &quot;lovemaking&quot;. Fulfillment more than conquest. Two sides of the same coin, perhaps--but the sweet, sultry Ms. Adu still comes up heads in my book.
0060392886|5.0|I was so excited when I finally got my hands on a copy of this book and I was not dissapointed when I started reading.<br />It's hilarious, sad and very insightful, I cant put it down.<br />It's the kind of book you could easily read in one sitting.<br />Well done to all the guys from Motley Crue for their humility in telling it the way it is and was.<br />This has become a major topic of conversation in my life and I recommend it to everyone I talk to.
B00003CX5P|4.0|While I am in general aggrement with most people that the SW Phantom Menace was trying a bit hard to be &quot;cutsie&quot; with younger audience members, and that it was not quite as character driven as the first Star Wars movie, it's main problem lay in editing. There were scenes and dialogue that were certainly unnesessary and caused more overal confusion than good. However, the story is actually very complicated, and the underlying premise is repeated throughout the film many times. There are many references in the movie that circumscribe the actual story. I had to actually watch it twice to understand the entire thing. Again, I believe this was due to poor editing. When I first saw this movie in the theater, many people still did not understand who the Phantom Menace was at the end of the film. I felt that the Director had made that painfully evident, even though IQ's do seem to have droped sharply since George Lucas has been away.  Regardless, I hope that the next installment will be more &quot;adult&quot; than the first atempt, and that editing will be more careful, and the script more straightforward. The special effects were all Star Wars, they were neither overbearing like those in Matrix and the recent Tomb Raider, nor were they subtle. Everything looks like it's taking place where it's taking place, and Mr. Lucus is the only director that can make space look so close, and so livable.
B000002TYK|5.0|Dave Grohl is one of the best musicians in the world, and this debut album is proof. I absolutely love the sound of this album with its distortion-heavy guitars and Dave Grohl's intense vocals. The Foo Fighters' other albums are also awesome and have the same sound, but the relatively lower production values on this album actually make it more compelling. When you add in the fact that Dave Grohl did everything on this album - wrote the songs,  provided the vocals,  played lead and bass guitars, and played drums - you begin to almost become jealous of his talent. Oh well, I guess I'll have to settle for just listening to his killer tunes, which are pretty much all of them. By the way, I heard recently that their fourth album is almost in the recording phase, and that it will be very loud, like this album and most of their second and third. Yes!! God bless Dave Grohl and his Foo Fighters! Kurt Cobain would be proud of his friend, I should think.
0790729725|1.0|Since I consider Martin Scorcese's &quot;Goodfellas&quot; the greatest gangster film ever made and one of the all time great motion pictures, it breaks my heart to give the DVD issue only one star (almost feel like Henry Hill ratting on his friends).<br />What could the &quot;geniuses&quot; at Warner Home Video been thinking?<br />The DVD is two sided, which means it has to be flipped in order to watch the 2nd half and there are NO special features to speak of except for a couple of trailers and a few production notes.<br />For a movie like &quot;Goodefellas&quot; (a film that boasts absoutely brilliant acting, writing, directing, cinematography, and soundtrack) to get such slipshod DVD treatment is inexcusable.<br />How about it Warners?<br />A &quot;Special Edition&quot; re-issue including commentary by Scorcese and/or Nick Pileggi; interviews with the stars, deleted scenes, and maybe the ENTIRE movie on ONE side.<br />If it's not in the stores by the end of the Summer, we may have to ask Tommy, Jimmy and Henry to pay you a visit!
B00001U0E1|5.0|I've seen this movie about seven or eight times already, and I'm looking forward to watching it again in the future. That's how much I love this movie! It's so intelligent and charming with its wonderful characters and witty dialogue that I honestly don't understand the view of the naysayers who don't like this film. Gwyneth Paltrow is so sweet and likable as Viola, Joseph Fiennes is great as Shakespeare, who seems to speak with a poetic twist on everything he says, and Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck, and others are all fantastic in their supporting roles. The inside jokes for those that know their Shakespeare are just icing on the cake. Saving Private Ryan was an excellent film, but ,personally, I was happy to see Shakespeare in Love take Best Picture. It's about time the Academy rewarded cleverness and originality instead of &quot;epics&quot; loaded with special effects and not much more. Shakespeare in Love deserves every ounce of praise it has recieved.
0345442989|5.0|The review titles says it all.  Finally, a prequel novel that isn't awful.  Cloak of Deception not only makes sense of the political maneuvering that pervaded &quot;Phantom Menace,&quot; but ties together Expanded Universe and prequel characters and plotlines.  This is also the first prequel book where I felt truly chilled on reading segments from Palpatine's point of view.<br />I'll say it again: Lucas should have made Cloak of Deception the plot for Episode I.  It's loaded with action, intrigue and suspense: you never know what it's all about until the end.  If anyone from Lucasbooks is reading this, the likes of Luceano and Greg Keyes should have the oppurtunity to write many more Star Wars novels, whatever the timeline.
B00005BJPO|4.0|As a kid I was brought up on Disney and WB fare, but a Japanese friend took me to see Akira at a cinema in Scotland in 1989.  Compared with Western products, the incredible depth and quality of Akira's animation left me open-mouthed.  Naturally Western animation has moved on since then, using computer generated characters and scenes, and has closed the &quot;agog&quot; factor somewhat.  That's the reason for 4 stars and not 5.  <br />Fortunately I understand this DVD has the Japanese soundtrack.  I've seen both the dubbed version and the original (I have the VHS version).  The original is far, far superior.  This is supposed to be a Japanese movie, with Japanese characters, and  Japanese culture, set in Tokyo.  Watch it in Japanese and use the English subtitles.  Even if you don't understand what they're saying, the tones and pitch of the voices, and the speed of speech, are all channels of communication from the director.<br />I agree with one of the previous reviewers that on your first viewing you will probably come away rather confused.  I admit my recommendation to watch it in Japanese with English subtitles will not aid comprehension.  But so what if you need 2 viewings.  Surely that's the whole point of buying a DVD: you can watch it again for free.  <br />In conclusion, if you only ever watch one Japanese anime, watch this one.  And you're better off buying than renting as you'll need, and want, more than one viewing.
B00004WMXZ|5.0|I can not imagine the pop music world without Madonna. Every one of her albums are charged with such innnovated energy. MUSIC is the culmination of many years of musical maturity. Song by song she can take us to an exciting electronic journey. Track 1: the irreverent MUSIC, tell us just to live for it, and as always madonna invite us to still &quot;keeping together&quot;. Track 2: IMPRESSIVE INSTANT, an impressive song, fast track, universal feeling, everybody can undertand this kind of moments. Track 3: RUNAWAY LOVER, a reflection of the superfitiality of modern relationships. Track 4: I DESERVE IT, this beautifull song is clearly dedicated to madonna's actual lucky love, and is so perfectly writed, that everyone can identificate with their lirycs. Track 5: AMAZING, like its title, amazing music, amazing lirycs, very sicodelic style. Track 6: NOBODY'S PERFECT, my favorite one, it describe perfectly the feeling of many people out there (me included) who tried so hard to be perfect, and at the end realize, that you can be good just tryin to. Track 7: DON'T TELL ME, a defenitive and sure statement of love. Track 8: WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL, like other madonna's songs in the past, this one can speak up for women around the world, just that. Track 9: PARADISE (NOT FORM ME), a sad song about confusing memories of someone you love and can not have. Track 10: GONE, a perfect song like this, only can came from a person like Madonna, strong and sure about what she believe and her concepts of life.
0553275976|4.0|Lot of useful reviews here. No one mentions Wolfe's 24-page introduction, 'Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast,' which is excellent in itself as an overview of the alleged death of the novel, The New Journalism, non-fiction v. fiction &amp; his own evolution as a writer. The introduction is worth a read on its own if you're a journalism student, a would-be or actual writer or just interested in the publishing world. As for the rest of the book, it's excellent. Wolfe is a master of the set piece, the extended vignette beautifully observing a situation or person. He is not so good at endings, which is why I picked four stars rather than five. I felt identically about his later &quot;A Man in Full,&quot; and it didn't stop me enjoying the heck out of the book. If you enjoy his fiction, his non-fiction is well worth checking out as great examples of very controlled, observant reporting &amp; writing. I particularly enjoyed &quot;From Bauhaus to Our House,&quot; an extended essay about modern architecture, and &quot;The Painted Word,&quot; ditto on modern art.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Fans of the original trilogy (The only &quot;real&quot; Star Wars) might be a little disappointed with this movie.  The plot was strong, but not as strong as the originals, the diversity of the charactors wasn't as multitudinous, and there weren't nearly as many surprises, as a fan of the first three movies, Episode 1 paled in comparison; the introduction of Jar Jar binks, I found, was both pointless and annoying, but might, and probably does, appeal to the newer fans of this epic saga, Many of my friends were repulsed by Jar Jar, but, I felt, he added some humor to this movie, but enough about Jar Jar and his debatable &quot;homicide&quot; of Star Wars for so many people. TPM's special-efects were fascinating, they were far better than Star Wars: A New Hope and possibly The Empire Strikes back (Don't hurt me, it's just my opinion) but it resembled  The Return of the Jedi, as far as effects go.  Definitely, if you've not seen this movie ... get it
B00005LB9O|4.0|&quot;The Invisible Band&quot; is a different album than &quot;The Man Who.&quot;  They didn't change their sound much but they made all the songs more upbeat and positive sounding.  I like to compare these two albums to different seasons.  &quot;The Man Who&quot; is like &quot;winter&quot; whereas &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; is like &quot;spring/summer.&quot;  If you're wondering why I'm making these comparisons just look at the album covers for these two albums.  One is basically winter and one basically looks like either summer or spring.  The same analogy holds true for the music itself.  &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; sounds more happy and positive like the summer time and &quot;The Man Who&quot; is more sombre and melancholic like the winter.  Anyway, I'm sure you get the point.  I like this album more than their last because it is more happy-sounding and just about all the songs are great.  I like this album also because it can bring out your feelings just by listening to it.  It's great to listen to if your feeling happy or sad because it has both feelings.  But, of course it's predominantly more happy.  I wish I could give it 4.5 stars but I can't.  I would reccommend this one to anyone because I think anyone would like it.
B000002LGQ|5.0|hola mi nombre es antonio, yo soy de peru. cuando escuche las canciones de este albun, quede impresionado por la interpretacion de madonna. la cancion keep it together, es magnifico, tambien dear jessie. es un cd que no puedes dejar de obtener como coleccionista.
6305077630|4.0|This is one of John Hughes' classic 80's comedies with the only member of the 80's rat pack involved being Michael Anthony Hall.  But most will immediately recognize Lebrock, the older, experienced beauty that comes to take control of two adolescent high school outcasts.  The two quickly become the coolest cats in town via the flattering comments by Lebrock about the two and her mere presence wherever they go.  And of course mom and dad just happen to be on vacation, it's the eighties remember? Chet, the older brother, has to be the funniest character.<br />Pure silliness and innocent, adolescent humor you don't see in movies any longer.  Get a copy of the DVD while you can.
0800177177|2.0|Poor Francis Ford Coppola. He must look back on this movie nowadays and tear his hair out. Well, maybe if Francis old' man had bothered to actually write a good script and maybe forget about the eye-candy and the casting ideas for just a second, this would've turned out OK. Actually, I don't know if it would. Even with the great costumes, stunning make-up and beautiful sets, the film has so many flaws it is hard to imagine it ever been great. The movie stays true to the original, which is good, and the romance has a lot of chemistry. However, this movie is so utterly confusing - What is Winona Ryder now? A heartfelt girl? A lesbian? Dracula's lover? A vampire? A witch? A werewolf? For crying out loud, you don't even know what is happening in this film. Who are the characters? You don't really figure it out until the end and it's no use then because you've ended up hating the movie. And Dracula just moves on and on without filling the plot holes of the stories it is telling. It looks lavish, but underneath the visually impressive surface of this film, there is the cheesy core which ranges from extremely laughable to just plain silly.
B00000294R|5.0|MANY RAPPERS/MC'S IN THE INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW CLAIM TO BE DA ILLEST OR DA REALEST, AND WITH GOOD REASON, UNTIL.... U LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM AND U'LL HEAR WHERE MANY OF TODAYS RAPPERS 'GOT THEIR WHOLE STYLE FROM'. L SOMEHOW MIXES HIS UNIQUE COMICAL PUNCHLINES INTO THE DARK GRIMY REALITY RAP HE SPITS THROUGHT THIS SOLID ALBUM. THE BEATS SERVE TO COMPLIMENT L'S VOCALS WHICH ARE OF A LOW BASS, CONTINUAL RYTHMIC STYLE. TRULY THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST RELEASES OF 95 BUT REMAINED UNDERGROUND UNTIL THE REST OF THE WORLD WAS READY FOR BIG L. GO GET THIS MASTERPIECE, BIG L'S TALENT IN ITS PURE FORM.
B00000JPH5|5.0|When I first saw it when I was 4 or 5 I had to watch it over and over. Of course then I didn't get the story plot, I just loved the guys that can throw there heads. When I was 7 I remember wanted to be just like Sarah. Now that im older and I know the plot I am truly in love with this movie. I love the muppets, the sets and the maze! I dunno why but I think it would be fun to be able to go through a maze like that. Everytime I watch it I feel like im in another world. I do not own this movie yet because it is imposible to find but I think I will ask my mom to get it for me off of here. I rent it a lot and my dad gets annoyed because its allways the same movie that I rent. GO WATCH IT NOW!!!!!!!
B00003CX5P|5.0|I know everyone was partially scarred by the lack of acting produced by several of the characters in George Lucas's latest production. However, I suggest instead of focusing on the small details and ravashing a legendary saga and one of the only movies parents and kids can watch together, we should highlight the favorite and memorable things which make Star Wars one of the greatest movie legends of all time.  We like to pick a rag on everything bad about the movie, yet we never stop to appreciate the work and visual mastery behind it.  I for one look foward a great deal to seeing Episode 1 on DVD. As for the critics' reviews, the number of great films they trash and the number of down right inapropriate trash that they praise has caused me to totally disregard what horrible things they can say about this fun (and completely appropriate) film.
B000002MNL|5.0|After some false starts and ill-advised intents to shock with his music, Morrissey at last found a good reason to have left his seminal rock band The Smiths with 1992's YOUR ARSENAL. In fact, the album was successful enough to win Moz an audience in America, who had only existed as a cult following to the Smiths. While YOUR ARSENAL was hailed as a masterpiece almost the minute it came out, the big question was what to do for an encore. The answer was simple: come up with an album that's just as good as ARSENAL but certainly not the equal of that musical miracle. Hence, 1994's VAUXHALL &amp; I. Ever since his days with the Smiths, Morrissey has never been afraid to acknowledge his inspiration in 1970s glam rock, and YOUR ARSENAL was like his version of ZIGGY STARDUST. But he probably realized he wasn't a kid anymore, for VAUXHALL &amp; I is from a man who's now in his mid-30s, and is possibly bidding farewell to the confrontational image that was in his Smiths days. Starting out immediately with the mellow &quot;Now My Heart Is Full&quot;, this song shows that Moz is beginning to grow up, but not by selling out. The sounds on VAUXHALL are mainstream, but the lyrics are anything but. &quot;Lifeguard Sleeping, Girl Drowning&quot;, &quot;The Lazy Sunbathers&quot; and the closing eyebrow-raiser &quot;Speedway&quot; (are the rumors about Moz being a racist true?!!) would certainly not have found its way on top 40 radio in America, but in England it might have, for their idea of pop music is something a bit more advanced than ours. Speaking of which, one song off VAUXHALL almost did capture the American public. &quot;The More You Ignore Me, The Closer I Get&quot; just barely missed the top 40 here, and was deservedly Morrissey's biggest hit in America with or without the Smiths. The lyrics are still distinctively Morrissey, but something about this song makes it easier for the uninitiated to accept. Other modern-day Moz classics include &quot;I Am Hated For Loving&quot;, &quot;Used To Be A Sweet Boy&quot;, &quot;Billy Budd&quot; (another baiter for those who question Moz's sexual preference) and &quot;Why Don't You Find Out For Yourself&quot;. At this point in Morrissey's career, he was quite prolific with the wonderful YOUR ARSENAL following the lame KILL UNCLE (1991) by only about 15 months. VAUXHALL &amp; I would be followed by the progressive-rock-influenced SOUTHPAW GRAMMAR (1995) by about the same time length. But after 1997's MALADJUSTED, Morrissey fell silent after his record company dropped him, and since then he has been without a home in the business. Last I heard, he was still shopping around for a label, so while it may be now 4 years since the last Morrissey record, we'll still have wonders like ARSENAL and VAUXHALL to keep us company until Moz's newest pop masterpiece is unveiled.quot;Used To Be A Sweet Boy&quot;, &quot;Billy Budd&quot; (another baiter for those who question Moz's sexual preference) and &quot;Why Don't You Find Out For Yourself&quot;.

B00005BJ2O|5.0|HELP! I can't stop listening to this soundtrack and there are no signs of me getting sick of it yet! This CD truly embodies the entire movie of Moulin Rouge. Fast, modern, visionary, entertaining, beautiful... words cannot describe it. Quite simply, if you loved the movie you will absolutely love the soundtrack. I saw the movie, then had to get the soundtrack immediately. I bought this CD about 2 weeks ago and listen to it for over an hour every day... it's driven me &quot;mad&quot;! I love it and cannot stop listening to it. I must warn you, however, that it will make you obsessed with Moulin Rouge. I just had to see the movie again after I had listened to the soundtrack so much, so I went back to see the movie again yesterday and I'm still not satisfied, because every time I listen to this soundtrack I want to re-live the movie again. (I'm really looking forward to the release of the DVD.) If there is just ONE movie you see all year, make it Moulin Rouge. If there is just ONE CD you buy this year, or for the next ten years for that matter, make it the Moulin Rouge soundtrack. But just so you can't say that you were never warned, I will once again remind you that one cannot simply listen to this CD once. Okay, now that I've convinced you, I'll throw in some details about the CD: it's a great collection of songs (and performers, for that matter). I was unsure at first about Ewan and Nicole singing, but they prove themselves worthy. Ewan has an especially strong, natural singing voice, and while Nicole isn't Celine Dion, she can get the right notes out and capture the emotions of each song quite well. &quot;Nature Boy&quot; embodies the haunting intro of the movie (&quot;There was a boy, a very strange, enchanted boy...&quot;) and of course everyone knows the chart- topping lyrics to &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, but the songs that you simply cannot miss are &quot;Sparkling Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot;, and &quot;Come What May.&quot; These songs arebelted out Broadway-style in some of the most memorable scenes of the movie. Every piece included on this soundtrack will remind you of the spectacle of &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;. It is a great collection and I honestly don't have any complaints about it, although I do wish they would have included a few more of the pieces used in the movie on the CD (including &quot;Spectacular! Spectacular&quot; &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and the song used during the ending credits). Still, this soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard from any movie or show, and it is absolutely necessary for everyone who loves Moulin Rouge to own a copy.
B00003CXB7|5.0|It be hard to say watch the film first and then the series because it seems most people did the reverse. You have to remember that the movie version seemed more realistic and less comical because the 1970 movie was thumbing their noses at the US government for the Vietnam war. Also the tv series was just picking on Frank Burns and then picking on Charles Emerson Winchester III. The film was great and dserved to be on the AFI 100 List for Comedy and General List. This movie needs to be preserved on DVD as soon as possible. Also if you only saw the PG version of the movie, you cheated yourself rent or buy the rated R version. It is 2 different worlds.
B000056NX4|5.0|I have been a huge JCS fan ever since I saw the original moveie production. It is my dream to one day perform this rock opera, hopefully as Mary Magdalene. My dad owns the soundtrack from the London production, so I knwo the whole show by heart. When we first saw an ad for the new movie, I was excited because, even in the few minutes, I could tell that exceptional talent had been put into this particular show. We bought it and were wowed at the precision with which each and every part was delivered - except for Herod's. Usually the funniest scene, I think they tried to hard on this one, and it came off as extremely cheesy. I always fast-forward that part. Other than that, the actors and singers were amazing. Even the minor parts were right on - Annas, Simon, Peter, and especially Pilate were done flawlessly. In the other productions, these parts are obviously not worked on as hard, but each and every performer (except for Herod) did an excellent job. I was very impressed, not only by the phenomenal singing, but by the acting and facial expression. Pilate and Judas both have amazing faces which add so much more depth to their character. This may sound presuming coming from a 14-year-old, but they did a suprisingly good job.
B00003CXC7|5.0|forget Vertigo, forget Psycho even. this is Hitchcock's real masterpiece. if there was a Hitchcock film i would most likely view frequently, this is it! stellar performances, excellent direction and superior setting and plot make this one an unforgettable experience in cinematic drama.<br />as for the DVD, awesome documentary, great trailer, informative interview with John Michael Hayes, a poster gallery and more interesting facts in the production notes. this DVD is a must for collectors.
B000000OTU|5.0|This is their third greatest hits album and probably their best yet.  This was one of my first aerosmith albums that i got and this album established how much i love this band.  Each and every song is great.  There is not one that is boring or terrible.  Each one rocks you hard till you're just tired and weary when it reaches the end.  <br />All the songs here are from most of their hit singles released from the albums, Permanent Vacation, Pump, and Get a Grip.  Besides that, Aerosmith include three new songs in here, 'Walk on Water', 'Deuces are Wild', and 'Blind Man'.  All three are great songs too.  All the songs are nicely laid out.  Some of the songs are just so good that you can't even wait till you reach the next song to listen to it.<br />Words just cannot describe how good all the songs are on this album of what the Modern Aersomith is like.  They're just simply great.  If you enjoy this album, i suggest purchasing Permanent Vacation, Pump, and Get a Grip.      If you wanna listen to Classic Aerosmith, try 'Greatist Hits' or 'Gems'.  Both have great songs.
0060278234|5.0|I thought this was a great book, although it wasn't nearly as good as &quot;Sabriel&quot; was. It was a great book for information and to sort of bring you back into that 'world'. I am glad that Nix is comin out with &quot;Abhorson&quot; becase that was a pretty ... way to end &quot;Lirael.&quot; All in all, i give this book a four and 1/2 star rating.
B000021XS0|1.0|I've often tried to like prog-rock of this sort. I'm a classicaly trained musician, so I'm supposed to like stuff like this but... Prog rock bands are really taking the wrong angle with this. Sure, we can all see they are all quite talented musicians, but the bottom line is they need to stay in the orchestra playing other people's music, because they shouldn't be allowed to write their own. I was forced to listen to Dream theater, and every time I try to like them, I end up with the same feeling, that the music is hollow and contrived. Listening to the Grateful Dead or Phish jam for an hour with tons more feeling is much more impressive than this, mistakes and all. If you want to listen to uber-musicians with giant egos ... on stage with their respective instrument for well over an agonizing hour, then by all means purchase this garbage. However, a better alternative would be to try Frank Zappa, a prog-rock god who DOES NOT TAKE HIMSELF SERIOUSLY, and whaddaya know, he's 100 times more listenable, AND you still get the technical prowess that all you proggie heads get ... dreams about.
0060916540|5.0|This is not primarily an adventure story about climbing.  It is an account of one man, not just facing the abyss but being in the abyss and having his very being stripped to a raw struggle, not to survive but to want to survive.<br />Simpson and a climbing partner in an excess of youthful bravado planned a new route up a monster Andean peak in Peru.  The area was remote and civilization was somewhere else.  After an arduous ascent, Simpson fell and broke his leg while descending.  The reader gradually realizes what a chilling horror has befallen the pair.  They have no possibility of rescue; the mountain was almost unclimbable for two superb athletes with two good legs.  How can they possibly get down when one of them is unable to walk?<br />Partner, Simon Yates, ropes Simpson to himself and tries to guide Simpson down who is forced to crawl, slide, and inch himself forward.  Then Simpson goes over the edge of a cornice and is dangling with only the rope holding him over the void. Yates heroically digs in, but gradually he himself is being inexorably drawn to the chasm.  He finally, with shuddering reluctance, cuts the rope, and Simpson falls many feet into a crevasse.<br />The rest of the book is Simpson's six-day excruciating journey down the mountain: his thoughts, hallucinations and agony.  Simpson is a powerful writer without a trace of self-pity.  He doesn't try to impress us with his stoicism - far from it, at times he is almost mad with fright.  There is nothing lurid here; the book is exhausting, but thought provoking. You won't forget it easily, and you cannot help but wonder what it is like beyond the edge and into the maelstrom.
B00003CXDZ|4.0|Wildly colorful, fast-cut, digitally enhanced-Moulin Rouge is 21st Century, but timeless.  There has been some criticism of a simplistic plot.   I am firmly in favor of simple plots for musicals; I don't expect music and dancing in O'Neill's \\"The Iceman Cometh,\\" and I don't expect great drama in \\"Guys and Dolls.\\"<br />The stage sets of the Montmarte and the Moulin Rouge were perfect; the first had a quaint grayish fairy tale quality and the second a wild kaleidoscopic fractured façade that provided just the right contrast.<br />Nicole Kidman is exquisitely beautiful as the doomed Satine.  She works hard in this movie.  She dances, sings (in a surprisingly pleasant voice), shows a comedic flair and has at least 40 costume changes.  Ewen McGregor is so handsome; he would be quite satisfactory just standing around looking gorgeous.  However, he really belts his songs and emotes wonderfully as a star struck lover.  The chemistry between the leads is electric.<br />The music is borrowed from everywhere, from Elton John to Gilbert and Sullivan.  I had no problem with music not being vintage 1899, when I see a musical, I am ready to suspend belief.  The production number \\"Roxanne\\" was a joy - almost Bob Fosse-like.  This is one soundtrack I cannot wait to purchase.  <br />My only reservation was the never-stop visual \\"busyness\\" of the film.  I felt the audience needed a breather now and then, an oasis of quiet to rest their eyes, if nothing else. Also I waited in vain for a full-scale production of the famous \\"Can-Can.\\" <br />\\"Moulin Rouge\\" is an evening well spent.  You will leave the theatre with a smile.
B0000256KE|5.0|Not many bands can create a debut album that's so good, it actually is credited with starting trends that would later become the stuff of parody. Roxy Music is certainly on that short list. Their self-titled 1972 debut merged the gentlemanly style of leader Bryan Ferry with some of the rockingest riffs ever composed. Yes, as refined as it sounded, Roxy Music's music flat-out rocked! By the time Roxy packed it in in the early '80s, synth pop had become the order of the day in pop music, many bands oweing a huge debt to Roxy's trailblazing. Surely, Duran Duran, ABC, and Ultravox could not have existed if not for Ferry bringing class to rock &amp; roll. But while the synth pop of the early '80s may have lost a bit of the rocking edge that Roxy had (even Roxy mellowed out on their later stuff, but that was due to age more than change in tastes), seminal albums like 1973's FOR YOUR PLEASURE are a good example of the music Duran Duran could have made had the synthesizer not been their main instrument. Indeed, PLEASURE may be Roxy's most rocking album of their whole career with guitarist Phil Manzanera getting his licks in many times over on the album. Roxy standards like &quot;Do The Strand&quot; (there should have been a dance craze started by this song!), &quot;Editions Of You&quot; and the false slow-opening of &quot;Grey Lagoons&quot; are all piledriving pieces of rock candy with more attitude than your average punk record (which was still only a few years away). Saxophonist Andy MacKay (who came the closest to making saxophone as much a lead instrument as guitar) literally blows the hell out of his sax to keep up with Manzanera's blazing riffs. The competition results in a draw, at best. While most of FOR YOUR PLEASURE may have even the most left-footed listeners out of their chairs and boogieing in no time, there's also some songs to woo your mate by. Mellower (although not by much) ditties like the title track and &quot;In Every Dream Home A Heartache&quot; (the most agonizing song ever written about a blow-up doll) will literally turn your lover to jelly with Bryan Ferry's sensual voice (which is much more effective than Viagra!). But of course, one should not forget the other Brian on the album: (Brian) Eno. Some have said that Roxy Music was just as much a vehicle for Eno as it was for Bryan Ferry, and FOR YOUR PLEASURE certainly makes a considerable case for that theory. His otherworldly synthesizers (from a time when they hadn't become cliched) and tape loops (most notably on the title track, &quot;Heartache&quot;, and the 9-minute epic &quot;The Bogus Man&quot;) give FOR YOUR PLEASURE just that added hint of artyness that could very well qualify this music as progressive rock. Unfortunately, after PLEASURE, Brian Eno left Roxy to go solo, and that would see him pioneer the genre known as &quot;ambient music&quot; which would then inspire new age. A lot of people said Roxy just wasn't the same band after Eno left. Yet Roxy survived thanks to the able guiding hand of Bryan Ferry, and while they might have not been as risk-taking as they were with FOR YOUR PLEASURE, they still continued to make some great music that was miles ahead of the pop music that also came out during its time. And yes, the title is certainly one of the aptest for any album ever released!st agonizing song ever written about a blow-up doll) will literally turn your lover to jelly with Bryan Ferry's sensual voice (which is much more effective than Viagra!).

0140120416|5.0|As far as learning a new language goes, I think that starting with being able to read it is equally important to being able to speak it. They go hand in hand with adult education. I was sick of discovering that most of the russian books out there are devoted almost entirely to teaching you catch phrases to &quot;get you going&quot;. This book starts with the alphabet. It is detailed and actually does &quot;get you going.&quot; Russian is a tough language to learn, but this book will help you through it without condescending you. I would highly recommend it for people who are serious about learning the russian language.

0393317552|5.0|good read.  Great that many theories are synthesized and logical connections made between them.[...] Diamond's book is a panecea to [the] egregious malady [of biases and the most fraudulent view of Western superiority].<br />... this is a great read.  though other reasons for the dominance of the west: 1) Emperor Constantine's adoption of xstianity and more importantly 2)the need for europeans to obtain the bountiful resources of india, china, etc.  remember, it all started with vasco da gama returning from South west India(**) with cargo worth 60 times the cost of the voyage.  this sparked the whole of europe with a mania more ebullient than tulipmania of the 1600s or the great internet boom of the late 90s, and lead to money being poured into sea -faring activities.  this huge economic incentive gave impetus to the founding of the americas by columbus, which pumped huge amounts of the wealth needed by europe to begin their military and financial dominance over the world.<br />**the state of Kerala more popularly known then as the Spice coast or Malabar coast.  almost every widely used spice and a mjority of citrus fruits originated here.  the area has been described as heaven on earth, therefore one can easily understand the foreign interest.  a german magazine stated that India was the richest nation on earth at the time of european colonization.  this makes sense when one realizes the abundance of precious stones along with the huge trade surplus involving spices,textiles etc.
B000002U82|5.0|This very well could be the greatest albumn ever made.  This concept albumn's groundbreaking use of stereo paved the way for techno and made Pink Floyd a household name.  This albumn is a journey, a journey to insanity, the darkside of the moon.  Songs like Time, Money, Brain Damage, and Eclipse are incredibly powerful and have made a mark in the music world still felt today.  If you don't alreay own this albumn, your are missing one of the great pieces of rock from the 20th century.
B00005B36H|3.0|Well I have listened to the new Tool cd lateralus quite a few times.  I am still waiting for it to hit me.  It seems a little slow in comparison to past.  Since I had to wait a little longer that expected to get my hands on the new album, I had some built up expectations.     The verdict:  It hasnt lived up to the hype.
B000002J09|5.0|One of the finest CD's to ever grace my ear drums. The title totally defines it. The catch is there is really no title. It's  been called the &quot;rune album&quot; because of the runic and/or celtic symbols on the cover, it's also been called &quot;Zoso&quot; (that's the only one of the four runes that can be be expressed in the roman alphabet by the record stores), but most commonly known as &quot;Led Zeppelin IV.&quot; But no matter what the name, the rose smells just as sweet. <br />English folklore and Celtic imagery are scattered throughout the whole album in both the instrumentals (I believe there's a mandolin in there somewhere) and the lyrics (&quot;angels of Avalon,&quot; etc.). Page's guitar is incendiery and Plant's vocals are pretty diverse, not just his trademark screeching. But what review of this album would be complete without a comment on the album's beautiful centerfold &quot;Stairway To Heaven.&quot; <br />&quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; is arguably one of the most popular songs ever written and has recieved critical praise to boot. It beautifully blends English folke and rock. The beginning is primarily fokey with the slow guitar rythm and flute acompanyment and gradually gets more &quot;rockin&quot; until it reaches the fabulous guitar solo and the rest is pure Zeppelin.<br />I would recommend this CD to anyone, guaranteed to take you on a strange trip at the very least.
B000000H4V|5.0|hey, whats up people?  This is sepultura's best cd.  I am a huge fan of roots, and dont get me wrong, that is a great cd, but this cd blows roots right out of the water with tracks like refuse resist, territory, slave new world, amen, prpaganda, and clenched fist, but the song that stands out the most on this cd, sepultura's greatest song in my eyes, manifest, it is such a good song and the lyrics are increadable, see ya.
B000005DQR|5.0|first of all, i want to say that dj shadow is one of the finest producers in the studios right now.  his sense of how sound samples fit together to form a cohesive whole (which basically is aural collage) is incredible.  he uses an incredibly diverse source base for his samples and, because of this, the album has a very eclectic sound to it.  however, the whole cd fits together very well.  each track leads into the next creating a solid album as well as having each track have individual character and message. i bought this disc while i was on a trip in scotland about 5 years ago because i had heard an npr interview with dj shadow and heard some samples of his stuff and was amazed.  when i saw the cd in a store there, i thought, &quot;why not?&quot;  i was amazed by it and have been so continually as each time i play the cd, new facets of the tracks some to light. it's a complex listen and each level is interesting and amazing.  you wont regret picking this one up.
B000059Z8J|5.0|There are a handful of movies for which I have been eagerly awaiting the DVD release; this was one. And the best news is it didn't disappoint and managed to actually improve on the original itself. <br />The two-sided DVD is chock full of extras worth on their own the cost of this disc. Included: Three very entertaining, informative and touching (they include modern-day interviews with Christopher Reeve) documentaries. <br />The movie itself - a nearly-unmatched fete of cinematic excellence - was astonishing when it was released. And it has weathered two decades very well. The effects are still awesome, while the plot itself manages to deftly swing from suspense, drama, comedy and action under the underrated direction of Richard Donner. John Williams' score is one of his best.<br />If you didn't see this in the theater, you may count your blessings the DVD actually improves upon that experience with deleted scenes and outtakes. <br />Buy it now along with Part 2 (forget the later followups) and enjoy a terrific homage to the Saturday serials of old.
0805062971|5.0|This is not a simple work of fiction. This is a self-help manual for our generation.
0393307050|3.0|This was my first Patrick O'Brian book, and I was quite sad to discover that  I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped too.  That said, I have to admit that I did have very high expectations, given the high praise that I've heard about the Aubrey-Maturin saga-- often given by folks whose tastes are similar to my own.  It's quite possible that my disappointment is simply a function of the fact that my expectations had been raised so high...<br />To be fair, there *are* many good things about this book, the first in the Aubrey-Maturin saga.  Foremost among those, of course, is the impressive historical knowledge/research that went into this.  This is true not only in terms of matters of nautical/naval/maratime history (which is, of course, the main focus of the novel), but also in terms of the broader political/social/international mileu.   I particularly appreciate the fact that this book makes an effort to represent the less flashy aspects of naval life during the Napoleonic Wars-- the economic details of provisioning and outfitting a ship, the bureaucratic details of how a ships log was kept and the language of official naval correspondance, and even the complex web of social/personal 'politicking' that went on behind the scenes, on shore, and even on board.  Compared to C.S. Forester's classic Hornblower series (which I do love), &quot;Master and Commander&quot; is much grittier and grubbier, with more emphasis on realism and less on individual heroics.  <br />So, what's wrong?  Why am I giving this only 3 stars?  Well, in spite of the books merits, the fact remains that-- and I know I'm going to ruffle a few feathers in saying this-- is that it's somewhat weak in terms of characters, plot, description, and general narrative structure.  Put otherwise, it's well-researched and quite realistic--  but it's not really what I would call a well-written work of literature.  While characters do have well-developed backgrounds/histories, they're interactions and development inthe course of the novel seems quite flat and static-- and whenever changes or tensions exist, they just seem (to me) unconvincing.  The very friendship between Aubrey and Maturin, for example, or the supposedly simmering tension between Aubrey and Dillon (for another example), just seemed ....  well, unconvincing.  Part of the problem here, I think, is that O'Brian too often commits the error of 'telling', rather than 'showing', when it comes to character feelings and interactions.<br />In terms of the story, well, there really isn't all that much of a plot to tell the truth.  Essentially, Aubrey, Maturin, and the crew of the &quot;Sophie&quot; just sail around, pull into port, and engage in a few conflicts, with no overarching plot, development, or theme.  Often times transitions were abrupt, sudden, and unexpected-- and I often found myself needing to re-read sentences, paragraphs, or even whole sections to try and figure out what had changed and what new thing was happening.  <br />When all's said and done, this was still a pleasant enough read..... and I'm still willing to give O'Brian another try.  But, I guess I'm just disappointed that this book falls a bit short in terms of its literariness, even if it excels in its historicity.
0792837614|1.0|I don't get this movie. It is sooooooooo boring and the songs are so bad. All the characters don't talk and I didn't know what they were trying to say(the beggining 20 minutes). Their dancing moves didn't match and they can't sing crap!
B000002JEV|5.0|Up to now, I have bought almost half of my albums for only one song. &quot;Travelling Riverside Blues&quot; was my reason to buy this double cd album. But &quot;The Girl I Love...&quot; was the second remarkable song for me. All the other sons also showed new tastes when compared to their recordings in original albums. But the performance is more &quot;live&quot; than &quot;perfect&quot;.<br />This set is also good for a starter to Led Zeppelin. It gives the songs that made L.Z.
B000002J0B|5.0|This is what I think to be their most creative album. Houses of the Holy is to Zeppelin, as Sgt. Pepper is to the Beatles. This being the first Zep album I bought, it immediately turned me on to Zep. The first track &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot; is an explosive song that shows Zeppelin at their best, with Jimmy's mad guitar riffs, Bonzo's great drumming, Jones's bass and Plant's unique high pitched vocals. That leads into the mellow &quot;Rain Song&quot;, which is one of the most beautiful Zeppelin songs out there. The half acoustic &quot;Over The Hills and Far Away&quot; is another great song, showing Jimmy's amazing talent. &quot;The Crunge&quot; is the only song where you'll hear Zeppelin play funk, with Bonzo's explosive groove starting it off. &quot;Dancing Days&quot; is another classic song of Zep at their best. &quot;D'yer Mak'er&quot; has Zeppelin trying a jamaican sort of song, with outstanding results. The haunting &quot;No Quarter&quot; shows John Paul Jones' remarkable keyboard talent. And the album ends off with &quot;The Ocean&quot;, one of the best songs on the album, with a very aggressive feel to it, again showing Bonham's explosive drumming. My only complaint is that it only has 8 tracks, but 8 great ones at that. A must buy for any Zep fan.

I found this film to be so boring and the music so annoying that I turned it off after 40 minutes. If you're a fan of Cabaret then you might like this (I really wouldn't know) but all in all this is a really tiresome film with only a few worthwhile moments
B000056K04|5.0|As a college student without a car (at the time), I ordered this CD so I would get it in my mailbox the day it came out.  I was a little nervous to actually listen to it based upon what I had heard about it, so I perused the reading material.  Then, when I finally popped it into my laptop, my dorm room became charged with energy.  &quot;I Did It&quot; echoed through my hall, and then &quot;When the World Ends&quot; enraptured my hallmates.  <br />I have it in my car and it is CONSTANTLY in the CD player.  It was easy to learn all the lyrics and I love singing along.  This CD gets my car pumping and raises my energy level.  A smile suddenly appears on my face.  <br />Take a listen to the song samples for yourself because everyone is different.  Some people that like Dave hate this CD, and others like me absolutely love it.  Check it out.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator, for those of us gifted movie goers with a large palet for action/drama, you will love this movie! Gladiator is the name of Maximus, a slave, who was once a general of the Roman Army uner a great (aged) king. (Brilliantly acted out by Russell Crowe)The king loves and honors maximus and giveds him the postion of his heir. I don't want to share much more, but this movie emphasizes the human spirit and the courage of a man, standing in the face of destiny and fighting.
6302293553|5.0|I saw this for the first time when I was a high-school freshman, and I was hysterical throughout the entire ravenous, mauling rabbit scene.  I was giddy and guffawing through the rest of the movie due to dismembered, blood-spurting knights, the idiocy of Arthur himself, and the surly, obnoxious Frenchman.<br />Only when I was older was I able to fully appreciate the peasants pointlessly toiling in mud and spouting Marxist ideology, (much to Arthur's unappreciative chagrin) and the unexpected &quot;ending.&quot;  When I first saw it, the ending actually made me angry and left me feeling cheated, but once I got used to it, I appreciated how inevitable it was considering the rest of the film....<br />This movie is completely hilarious, full of (violent) slapstick, satire, and loveable yet bumbling knights on a quest.  I heartily recommend it to anyone with decently developed sense of humor.
0345455681|5.0|In this dazzling epic, Edward Rutherfurd engages our attention through the fortunes of several families who cover the social spectrum, including tradespeople, outcasts, aristocracy, artists. We follow the triumphs and tragedies of the Duckets, Barnikels, Flemings, Doggets, Merediths, and Silversleeves through sixteen centuries.     Taking as his starting point the moment when the Thames estuary was carved out of a prehistoric land mass, Rutherfurd interweaves landmark historical events with his characters' lives. The colourful tapestry is enriched by the inclusion of real characters, including Henry II, Chaucer, Grinling Gibbons, Sir Christopher Wren, Tompion the watchmaker, etc.     The amount of information - historical, sociological, cultural, technological, architectural, financial - is staggering. Yet it never detracts from the story. There are marriages, affairs, deceptions, murders, tragedies, all working within the developing topography and life of London. From the first Thamesside settlements to the thriving metropolis of today, each universe is brilliantly evoked. Each moment, whether Roman, Tudor, Victorian, is filled with integrity and develops into a compelling and coherent narrative.     This book does for London what Jostein Gaarder's \\"Sophies's World\\" did for philosophy.
B000053VAF|4.0|(This review is also, for some weird reason, published for the regular edition.  THIS is the edition to buy.  Accept no substitutes.)<br />This is a very interactive, funny and elaborate 2-DVD set.  In my review of the regular (read: cheap-@$$) version, I looked forward to a DVD packed with the usual commentary, insider info, jokes and celebrity shmooozing that graces the other View Askew Spec. Editions.  I was not disappointed.<br />(When you listen to Affleck on the first commentary track, see if you don't think, as I do, that he's using the &quot;biz&quot; speak for the first time, talking as though the Entertainment Tonight cameras are on him instead of the home boys from VA.)  <br />On the Special Edition DVD, there is a scene where Bethany, who works in a Planned Parenthood clinic, discusses her past with a young woman who is prepared for her third abortion. This is a scene where the most skilled and political writer tempts violent retribution from the masses on either side of the abortion issue. Bethany, played by Linda Fiorentino, describes in visual imagery most suited for a novel, her own back story or reason for being in her particular line of work. In this 3 minute speech, you see the power of Kevin Smith as a writer. It may not be best suited for the big screen where we now expect million dollar variations of explosions and intercourse every Memorial Day weekend, but it is a bit of Hollywood driftwood preserved for us backwater types who don't get to screen View Askew movies at parties or film festivals before they are cut to commercial specs. <br />Had this scene taken the Dragnet &quot;I've been down that road and you just don't know&quot; approach it wouldn't have worked. Had it been forced and ditatched, it would have been artificial...but this one scene, a minor part of the 2-disk set, proves that Smith is destined for greatness, perhaps he is the one of our generation who can turn his skill to the printed page to create that mythological Great American Novel that has baffled and eluded the Gen X ilk of the early 90s. <br />As Smith and Co. restate in their introduction of each deleted scene, most of what was cut from the philosophical/religious treatise &quot;Dogma&quot; was because it added too much info to already established scenes. This is true and reminds me that Smith could be a great novelist should the urge strike. He has a gift for narrative and could write a vivid first-person novel without fear of being pretentious.<br />If you hated Dogma, or have a religious bias against it, these words won't mean anything anyway. But &quot;Dogma&quot; is more about faith and love of God than most so-called &quot;christian&quot; movies out there. Its about Ideas and faith and renewing our relationship with God than about obeying and swearing our oath to the ancient, faceless patriarch. This is the only DVD version of the film you should own and only because it does justice both to the film and to the reasons behinds its production.<br />Nice work, Kevin and Scott. Keep it coming. You're both ready for much more.

B00003CXDZ|5.0|....and the best musical ever made! I loved this film! I was taken in by every moment. It was just a magical experience. I've never had a better time at the movie theatre before, and I plan to see this one atleast four more times before it comes to DVD! When it is finally released, I will be the first in line to purchase a copy of it! The performances were great, the costumes and set design were breathtaking, and the special effects were superb. I have the soundtrack, and I love the songs. <br />All in all, this is definitly a must-see! Don't miss it at the theatres...experience it on the BIG SCREEN first!
B00000DQWT|5.0|This CD contains some incredible pieces of music. I agree with a previous reviewer who said you can just close your eyes and get lost in it. What a fantastic score that is far superior to the movie it was written for. Forget the film, this music stands on it's own. It's inspirational. Thank you Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays. This is one of those &quot;take me away to that state of bliss&quot; albums. I'll admit that the second portion of this disc is not in the same league as the first half, but it's so wonderful it's worth every penny and then some. Especially track number 3 &quot;Chris&quot;. Beautiful!!!
0393964582|5.0|I've never seen the movie nor have I heard descriptions of the movie.  I just assumed from the clips that I had seen that Dr. Frankenstein went to the cemetary, stole body parts, created a monster, the monster escapted and the story climaxed as a group of townsmen find the monster and lynch it.  How happily wrong I was and what a sad mockery the story has become.  Instead of finding a plodding flat-headed creature with an IQ of 3, the monster is actually something worse--he's still 9', but he's agile, possesses superhuman strength and agility and worse of all, he's much superior in intelligence to his creator.  He is witty, is accomlished in persuasive speaking, quotes poetry and is determined to spend his horrible existance (he has nothing better to do--none can bare to look upon him as he is so horribly disfigured) stalking Dr. Frankenstien and making him suffer if he does not create another companion.  This Monster is much scarier and worthy of a great story than Hollywood's plodding oaf.  Shelly does an excellent job of pulling this reader in and struggling along with Victor Frankenstein as he debates the options in this lose-lose situation (slow destruction of his family vs creating a potentially more evil companion for his evil creation).  I had no problem suspending my disbelief and greatly enjoyed the characters (I especially enjoyed slowly watching Victor Frankenstein grow sick and insane with worry) that Shelly creates.  Aside from the Bible, if I could recommend any book, right now it would be Frankenstein.
B000006JPJ|5.0|There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best Iron Maiden album.  There are no fillers on this album, and ALMOST all of the songs are great.  The opening track, Moonchild doesn't quite have the impact &quot;aces high&quot; or &quot;Caught Somewhere in Time had&quot;.  It's a good song, but there is too much focus on the keyboards which loses lots of potential.  The second track is Infinite Dreams, the most emotional song on the album which good because it strenghthens the mood of the album(this is a concept album after all).  The album is enhanced by the deep serious mood all the songs seem to have.... except the third track.  This is the worst song on the album because it completely kills the whole feel of the concept idea with its happy and up-beat style.  Good song, but it messed up the album.  The next Track is Evil That Men Do, which is one of the best songs and lyrics ever done by Maiden.... nuff said.  The title track of the album, S.S.O.T.S.S is pretty good but it seems just bit long.  The prophecy is good but it needs a hell of a lot energy and speed.  The Clairvoyant is ties with Evil That Men Do as the best song on the album.  I know I said that I disliked the keyboards in the first track but Clairvoyant uses them a hell of a lot better.  The Last song on the album is Only the Good Die Young, Which is a great song indeed(no particular reason why).  Overall, this is the best Iron Maiden album.  There is not one bad song, but only a few perfect songs.  If you wanted a balanced album, Get Somewhere in Time.
6301955595|5.0|Wow,this film blew me away the first time I saw it. It is 10 times easier to watch than El Topo and 1000 times easier to watch than Holy Mountain (by the same director). Although as disturbing as the aforementioned, it maintains a discernable plot along with the surreal imagery for which Alejandro Jodorowsky is best known. It is a strange story with bleeding elephant, circus performers (i hate clowns and the circus, but the presentation in this film made it easy to watch), a fully tatooed woman, cult religion which worships an armless saint, a crazed mother with a son who is obviously too attached to mama, and a visually disturbing rite of passage into manhood. All of the nightmarish scenery is somehow manipulated through the camera by mr. jodorowsky to bring us a beautifully disturbing film with a wonderful story and a great plot twist ending. Not for all people, but if you are sick of the loads of big-budget schlock that really has no redeeming value like I am then this will come as a nice and refreshing suprise to you. <br />I am also a big Evil Dead fan so I must be right about this one! (Evil Dead is in no way similar to this film with the exception of maybe the gore)
B00003CXRP|4.0|A simple premise unravels itself to an extraordinary understanding of the human things surrounding us. I believe that the secret to Tom Hank's character's survival should not have been given away in the ads by Fox. Movies I really want to see, I avoid all ads for and I did for this one too. I dont want to be told what I am going to get. I want to be tugged with emotion in all its intensity and fashion. such a beautiful film in its essence, the story of a Chuck Nolan who gets stranded on an island with the hope of seeing his fiance again. SPOILER WARNING: But Alas the anti climactic ending was a heartbreaking tearjerker. The very woman that kept Chuck alive should have in some way been worth it. She still loves him but it is too late. While the idea about changes and the motto ...to keep breathing shines but it doesn't make the viewer's heart feel any better because of what happened between Tom Hanks and Helen Hunts characters. A simple story very visually told and a performance worth the nomination it got, the movie winds slowly to  unravel its sincerity. It could be mistaken as slow but the slowness is vital to its very structure. When Hanks got his nomination, I thought again, another year, something is wrong with the academy. This guy gets chosen every year..but every year this man brings incredibly fantastic performances. A great movie with a great message of not taking things for granted, and knowing how time and love change the human heart.
6305841861|5.0|If I get bored and cannot choose a movie to watch...I will always find myself reaching for this one. It is watchable anytime of day, over and over...rotate between evil dead and this one and you can't go wrong. It starts out with Ash and his girlfriend traveling to the old house in the woods. The film doesn't hesitate to jump into the good stuff. I mean it almost starts out like the cheesiest camp-fest with the two lovey dovey people exchanging rotten lines, but Sam Raimi takes care of that garbage with a quickness. All hell breaks loose within 3 minutes of the film's beginning and then the laughs...Never have I seen comedy and horror mix so well as I have in this film. You have your serious horror directors like Lucio Fulci delivering scares in the brilliant &quot;The Beyond&quot; and Argento's &quot;Suspiria&quot;, but those films could never evoke a laugh or else it would ruin the movie. Raimi does this seemlessly without ruining a thing. Brilliant possessions, demons, chainsaws, hands, etc... I just can't say enough...go watch it if you haven't yet and if you are sifting through your dvd's or vhs's trying to find something good to watch...just go for what you know! It's a winner everytime!!!  Trust me or I'll swallow your soul!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00004YZFQ|5.0|The curse upon the Rolling Stones appears to be that the pinnacle of their musical creativity, from 1968-1974, is overshadowed by Altamont.<br />The irony, of course, is that while the Stones and some others are to blame for shoddy planning, based more on naivite' than anything else, it was the Hell's Angels who took it upon themselves to beat, intimidate and, finally, murder concert-goers.  As GIMME SHELTER documents, the Angels were asked to sit on the stage, to form a human wall between the crowd and the performers, in exchange for all the beer they could drink.  They took this to mean they were to keep the crowd at bay, using fists, hobnail boots, pool cues, and knives.<br />In the end it was the Hell's Angels, a group of thugs who had never bought into flower-power and the entire hippy trip, who brought the 60's tumbling to a frightening and embarassing finale'.  <br />Jagger, like the Dead and Jefferson Airplane before him, seems meak and confused at Altamont, while good ol' Keith Richards attempts to take control of the situation.<br />JAGGER:  &quot;People! People!  People, people, people, people, people.  People. People!  Awright.  Awright...people!&quot;<br />RICHARDS:  &quot;If those cats, right there, don't stop beating everybody, we're not playing anymore.  Those cats, right THERE.&quot;<br />Almost forgotten in all the pop-sociological writings about this film is the great, great music.  The Mick Taylor version of the Stones was as powerful as it gets, and they flex some muscle here.  <br />My only question is, why weren't Bill Wyman and Mick Taylor allowed to speak on camera?  Jagger and Watts speak frequently, Richards speaks occasionally (mostly on stage at Altamont), Taylor is shown only occasionally, and Wyman is seen on screen, I think, one time, in the background on stage.
B00005LQ04|5.0|I love this film...It is perfect from beginning to end. Here's the deal...It is filmed more beautifully than just about any I've ever seen. The film score is un-matched in my opinion. The Goblins have created one of the best ever horror soundtracks to grace a film. It is such a compliment to Dario Argento's effects and intentions. I think the fact that an american is thrown into an unfamiliar country, situation, etc...adds to the intended portrayal of fear throughout. You can just sense that evil is present throughout the film thanks mostly to The Goblins. It is similar to the way you know evil is present in the Evil Dead Films, but only in the evil dead films the camera work (with sound) are indicators...In Suspiria it is mostly due to the Goblin soundtrack. Great piece of work...a truly beautiful nightmare!    I recommend picking up the soundtrack to the film...very creepy!
0671024256|5.0|ON WRITING convinced me of three things: Stephen King writes creepy stuff because he is a bit creepy himself, Stephen King is a much better writer than a lot of us ever have been willing to admit, and Stephen King would make one hell of a fine teacher.<br />I learned more from this book than I can say.  It is entertaining and, for writers at least, inspiring.  Like all good teachers--and all good writers, for that matter--King knows how to strip away the adverbs and the clutter, leaving a clean story and a clear idea.
B00003CWPL|5.0|Eraserhead is tough to explain. I love it, but find it hard to watch at times. This film seems to invoke feelings of isolation, depression, and sheer wierdness within the viewer (at least me as a viewer). It is truly a nightmare (imagine, as you watch, that this was a dream you had last night and that you have just awakened from that dream). I think that David Lynch did a great job with the imagery, sounds, etc... If hell has a waiting room, the land of ERASERHEAD is it. It's where things just are the way they are and there really isn't any escape. The characters in the movie are set fixtures who will never be anything more than they are. It is a world darker than most people's reality. I hope that soon this film will make it to the DVD market because it is truly a great film, although, not for all (and I can understand that). A close match for this film in my opinion is Santa Sangre directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this film but was absolutely delighted!  The music was fabulous and we laughed out loud while watching it.  My husband especially enjoyed the Sirens.  What a delightful and joyous adventure.
0345442989|1.0|This has to be the worst star wars book I have read other than the young jedi knights.  This book is slow, boring, very little action, poor hero development, Oh yes did I mention BORING!  A real waste of $... dollars.  Even in paperback it would be to expensive.  Back to stackpole for a good read.
B00003CXRP|5.0|I went to see Cast Away at the cinema and I was not very impressed with it all. I have bought the dvd because it is a two disc edition and it cost me $16 (11 pounds) from Blockbuster in the USA. I watched the film when I got home and it completely blew me away. From the terrifying plane crash right to the end credits the film grabs you by the throat and just will not let go. Once Chuck is stranded on the island you don't feel like you are watching him, you begin to feel like you are there with him.    This film is the classic &quot;What if?&quot; scenario and all the way through the movie you are constantly thinking would you do what Chuck does to survive. Tom Hanks has proved himself as a great actor on many occasions from Forrest Gump to Saving Private Ryan but he has finally proved himself as the finest actor of his generation. He steals every single scene whether he is in it by himself or there is someone else with him. Robert Zemeckis has made some excellent films and this is definitely one of them. I do feel though that the budget was partly made up by money from Fedex though. The dvd itself is outstanding. The picture is crystal clear from start to finish and the sound is perfect. The extra features are plentiful and will make for interesting and repeated viewing. They give a total insight into how the film was made and show what Tom Hanks had to go through. Excellent DVD to accompany an excellent film
0743201140|4.0|This is not only a co-written book, it is backed up by the Gallup Organisation and a survey of over two million people over a thirty year period. Although it is written with career and team management in mind, it is worth reading simply for personal development. The first learning point of the book is an understanding of how everyone's brain is wired in a unique way to give each person a unique combination of talents. This is fascinating information. A hundred billion neurons in the brain each with fifteen thousand synapse connections by the age of three. But by the age of sixteen, half of those synapse connections have disappeared to create a unique pattern for each of us in what we find difficult and, crucially, what we can perform with consummate and consistent ease. The second learning point is to understand that success and excellence do not come from fixing our weaknesses, but from developing our strengths. For years, employers have made the mistake of directing staff training to the improvement of weak areas while taking strengths for granted. The misguided aim is to produce a well rounded performer. But, as the book shows, the real performers are those who concentrate almost exclusively on their natural talents. The unique strength of this book is that each copy comes with a unique reference number for the reader to get access to the StrengthsFinder Profile, a dedicated website questionnaire of 180 questions designed to identify your own top five talents, taken from a list of 34 \\"themes\\". It is the identification of those themes, and the kind of questions needed to elicit them, which has emerged from the exhaustive survey of over 2 million people. Your profile will not necessarily tell you that you are in the right or the wrong job. It may point you to a more effective role you could be taking within that job. Undoubtedly it will help you to identify how you can improve your performance and job satisfaction by playing to your strengths more of the time. Thebook is particularly good at explaining how a different balance of strengths can produce excellent job performance even in the same type of job, because there are any number of ways to do an excellent job in the same field of work. It also provides practical damage limitation strategies for managing your weaknesses. If you are a manager or work within a team, the remainder of the book will help you determine the strengths of your team and the best way to approach each type of person. Having taken the StrengthsFinder profile, you can repeat it at any time and there is ongoing support in the form of email advice on how to make the most of your own strengths. The information offered through this book and the StrengthsFinder profile will provide a great deal of insight into your present circumstances and challenges, and prove an invaluable resource for contemplating any future career development.
B00004YYDI|5.0|this movie is one of the best i've ever seen. jean reno is a faboulous actor and i'm a big fan of his. so buy it.<br />(i'm not so good in English because i'm dutch)
B00004U2G4|5.0|This is a must for fans of Jeff Beck. I consider it his best work since he left the Yardbirds. The combination of Jeff Beck with vocalist Rod Stewart makes for a unique sound.
B000002AP1|5.0|this is such a great album. all the songs are so furious, and so, 'raw,' and it's one of the loudest albums i own. my favorite songs are, 'search and destroy,' 'gimme danger,' 'your pretty face is going to hell,' and the title track, although pretty much all the songs are excellent.
0060987464|5.0|I love this book. Don't ever stop reading it, even when it gets slow. His childhood was shocking, a bit unbeliveable but whether its real or not, its very entertaining.It shows publicity photos and childhood photos. Old dreams that he had (starting the band) and funny columns about nothing at all. He has pics of friends, old band members, random thoughts and ideas. No one I know that has read this book has been disappointed.
B000002NE4|5.0|I could try to describe the power of this record, that would be in vain. Hadn't I listened to it endlessly I wouldn't have known of emotions tragic and dignified as those elicited by Mr. Cave. Tragedy, as of Greek lineage, of genius, of beauty, that is the stuff Mr. Cave has dwelled upon, successfully, fearlessly. The crossing of lines, the lack of fear, the total surrender - rare, my friends, rather rare and magnificent.  There stands this man, bearing his soul, licking his wounds, dignified, so human, describing what is known to all of us who lie quiet in dispair. Only to wake up in disbelief of the interminable genius of life, that which Mr. Cave has had plenty of.
B00001NFCY|1.0|I loved early 90s grunge rock. I listen to my cds on a regular basis, Alice In Chains, Nirvana, Soundgarden, even some of the more obscure bands like Mudhoney i've gotten into. This band just wants to be like Pearl Jam and all of the early 90s grunge bands only they dont have the talent to do it. The band is terribly subpar including Mark Tremonti who is the most overrated guitarist ever. Scott Stapp is the worst singer/songwriter i've ever heard and i have a voodoo doll that i use to put various curses on him so this band will never make another record.<br />Go buy some early 90s grunge, Alice In Chains-s/t says Jared, go get that. Creed ....
B00004SU5J|5.0|I heard about this music from a friend in Paris. He described it as music that fits with how you feel after staying up all night partying. It's a lot like that, but it really moves out, great driving music, surprisingly versatile, great background music for your own party, put it on when there are a lot of people around and it will seem like there are a lot more people around. So good that I decided to buy more from this group. Tres bien!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies I've seen in the last couple of years, bar none. The music was amazing, the acting superb, the scenery fantastic... above all, the story. It's one of those movies that just leaves you with a smile on your face; it's very entertaining, and it's easy to get into the story. The end is heart-wrenching. Golf clap for Nicole Kidman's performance as the dying Satine. I spent the whole time in the theatre with goosebumps and singing along. Go. See it. Now.
0783235666|5.0|Rod Talyor and Tippi Harden a wonder job. One of hitchcocks best but not as good a psycho
B000002U9E|5.0|You'll note that Amazon only has samples of the first five tracks on this CD. There's a reason for that--those are the only five tracks on the CD you will want to listen to. The remainder of the tracks are part of a silly, bloated, pretentious, pointless &quot;concept&quot; piece called &quot;The Ninth Wave.&quot; Yeah, it's a washout. But, don't let that slow you down. Each of the first five songs are worth a star each and you will not regret owning them. Just make sure you have a CD player than can easily program out the nonsense.
B0000029LG|3.0|First off, let me say the first disc would definately get five stars on it's own.  It's an amazing collection of his biggest hits, missing only Smooth Criminal and Dirty Diana.  It's probably worth paying the price for the whole album just for this one disc.  It's got Black Or White, Thriller, Beat It, Remember The Time, The Way You're Making Me Feel, Billie Jean, Don't Stop, Wanna Be Startin' Something and TONS more classic Michael anthems.  This clearly shows why he is the king of pop.  HOWEVER this CD only gets 4 stars because of the second disc (2 stars).  It's a sad dose of reality that shows that Michael lost his touch.  Scream is awesome, and They Don't Really Care About Us is amazing musically.  The lyrics, um, could be better (Everybody dog doo?) but the music and theme are great.  You Are Not Alone was the first song ever to debut as a #1 single.  But these songs are washed away by the disgusting waste of space about to follow.  Childhood is the horrendous theme to Free Willy 2 (WTF?), and Smile is the sappy tribute to Charlie Chaplin.  The audio clips in History would have ruined the song if the track wasn't already horrible because of weak verses and a terrible chorus.  The final drawback of the album is the grotesquely overdone booklet.  Basically, he got several celebrities to write pages about him that are so overly supportive it's hard to take them seriously.  Then they take up a lot of space to show all of Michael's awards and sales records for albums.  The booklet (52 pages in all) is a over-glorification of him.  If you want to get a lot of classic Michael hits without going out and buying three or four seperate albums, then definately get this.  If you already have all of the songs on disc one, don't bother.  It's not worth it.
B000002UA7|5.0|This singles collection captures the best of pre-This Woman's Work Kate Bush. It's a perfect introduction to one of the greatest female singler/songwriter/musician/producer in pop music history. She blazed the trail for many inferior artists (yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout Tori Amos), but while there were many subsequent female performers influenced by Kate Bush, none surpassed her vision. Many Kate Bush fans prefer the less poppy album cuts, but as a singles artist, Kate Bush is a rare treasure.
B000002UDG|5.0|Paul McCartney is a musical genius.  Not only was he in two immensely popular groups (The Beatles &amp; Wings), but he had a fantastic solo career as well.  This disc takes a look at some of the songs he did with Wings as well as a lot of his best solo recordings.  My favorites are numerous, but the two biggest are: Say Say Say, the duet with Michael Jackson.  This was a great song, and they sound great together.  I'm questioning why they didn't include their other duet, The Girl Is Mine, on this album too.  And of course Live And Let Die, the famous James Bond Theme, for the amazing tempo changes and the powerful vocals.  The duet with Stevie Wonder is also pretty good.  The only song that seems out of place is the B Side C-Moon, which is far below par with the other songs.  It also would have been interesting if he threw in a few Beatles classics as well for a full tour de force of his career.  But this is still an amazing album.  Pick this up for a piece of musical history by one of this century's greatest musical masters.
B000002UA0|5.0|It's an insult to the music buying public that the name Pink Floyd was not retired after songwriter/guitarist/lead singer/founder Syd Barrett was eliminated from his own group. Sure, you might like some of the stuff by the so-called Pink Floyd of the post-Barrett era (I do, too), but this is the only real and true Pink Floyd. Rather than the predictable bombastic stadium rock that followed, Barrett's intensely personal and unique version of Pink Floyd remains one of rock's most valued artifacts. Buy this record only if you're prepared to never look at the rest of your Pink Floyd records the same way again.
B00003CXE6|3.0|I was totally dissappointed in this epic movie.   Not in the actor and actress, they did an excellent job with what they had to work with.  I was looking for more historical facts and more action.   The whole thing left me wondering what exactly I had just watched.
0767903854|5.0|I found this book on the humorous side. Bryson was able to take the small unnoticable things and find some sort of humour in it.  Like the idea that Austraila is the home for most of the world most dangerous animals.<br />Bryson travels all over Austraila and has many personal encounters with the &quot;locals&quot;.  Some good, some bazaar
6300214400|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this 3rd movie.   It showed the comical side of Leonard Nimoy.   It also protrayed what friendships are truley about.   Dr. McCoy and all of his postulations for Spock, proved that friendships win out even under the most strident protest.
B00003CXV4|5.0|I think that this movie was wonderful. I thought that keanu and Charlize were great together like they were in THE DEVILS ADVOCATE it my not be an Academy Award but it is cute ant worth the money. I know I will be purchasing it!
B00005IC2H|5.0|I was recently in potsdam, ny to visit a college, Clarkson.  During my stay there, I stopped at a small coffee house/ music shop (great place if u ever visit- plus they make some great espresso).  I began talking to the salesperson there who happened to be a Radiohead head like me. After some time, he told me about some \\"swedish\\" band he had come across and wrote their name on the back of a receipt--- \\"Sigur Ros\\" - \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\" ---  He said that if I liked Radiohead, I would like them.  The very next day, when i was back home, i happened to stop in a record store and remembered the receipt that i had stuffed in my wallet. I immediately bought the CD.  It was beautiful- somewhat comperable to a combination of \\"Treefingers\\" and \\"How to Disappear Completely\\" on radiohead's album, Kid A.  It is great mood music- some of the most beautiful sounds i've heard. Buy it.
B0000028RR|5.0|This is by far the best Rage CD. Every song is dynamic, intelligent, and well performed. Morello is a great guitarist, and Zack flows the grassrot hip hop beats smoothly and provokatively. Their music is leftist political and secular, just to my liking. They speak about such issues as poverty, the war on drugs, Mumia Abu Jamal, hypocrisy, corporate greed, rampant capitalism, etc. Not only is this music energizing ideologically, but it's also just fun listening. On a side note, I was surpised when I discovered that Maynard James Keenan of Tool and A Perfect Circle does guest vocals on \\"Know Your Enemy\\". I can also really relate to Rage's lyrics. <br />This I can feel perfectly. Frequently in school we're taught misinformation and lies, and people need to know this. Have fun.
0064407667|4.0|Lemony Snicket has opened up eyes of all young readers by changing his story around. It is not a normal kind of story that you would see in every day life, but Unfortunate events that keep on happening to these 3 poor childeren throughout the series. He has a unique way of showing his talent in writing.Which is different and good.This story also has alot of humor. I recommend this book to all readers who liked to get sucked up in books like you are there, at the scene watching it happen. It is really a very good, well written story.
0446608955|5.0|I've either read or listened to all of Nicholas Sparks' books, and there isn't a bad thing I can say about any of them.  A Walk to Remember is well-written, well-rounded and a beautiful love story that isn't cheesy of cliche.  The characters are deep and unique and Sparks manages to portray them wonderfully without boring the reader with details.  This is one of the few books that had made me cry, but it was worth it.
B00003CXPD|5.0|My gosh,, Billy, Billy, Billy,,  I didn't think too much when I picked this one from BlockBuster, but not only I watched it 3 times in a row, also purchased it the day I rent it.   I frankly don't know where to start with,,  The story itself is pretty interesting;a british boy, who lives in this small coal mining town with intensified strikes going on, happens to find his hidden talent as a ballet dancer.   <br />It is a very powerful movie because it gives out this inspiration, motivation, little push to change your life if you are caught up with the situation/circumstances.   I'm not joking here, but I literally packed all of my video games and systems (which happen to be my precious collection over years) to sell them and move on to be a determined law school student,,(which ended up in unpacking everything i've packed..it was so close though,,).   I mean, I could never ever picture myself throwing away my precious game collections, but this movie actually persuaded me to throw them away to dance for my own dream, almost.   This movie shows a burning desire of a boy, (hold it right there!) you see, do you know what it feels like to have that burning desire? that you wanna do something so bad yet you are strained by your own family,,  This movie did an excellent job on building/developing the struggle by Billy with the family, outside, and himself.   man,, this boy surely knows how to dance,,let me tell you that-  (I'm seriously considering of registering a dance class, though i'm not much of a dancer)<br />I absolutely agree with the other reviewer who said that this movie was overlooked during Oscar ceremony.   I don't know about you, but i couldn't understand why the Billy Elliot wasn't picked as a best movie, well at least it's better than Gladiator.   This already maginificient movie with struggling, dancing, maturing boy, is again solidified with the father's decision to sacrifice himself utterly, i mean utterly and vague touch of Billy's gay friend, who adds more to the depth of the story with this faint scent of nostalgia.   <br />Aaahh(sigh),, I literally watched his dancing scenes more than,, i don't even remember,,  But this boy, who wants to be a ballet dancer, will either make you cry with tears of determination or give that warmth that you haven't felt for a long time.  <br />Hey people, dance like Billy, dance like Billy to go forth to reach for your dream regardless of the struggle, obstacle, and circumstances,, if Billy can do it, then you and I can do it  =)
0887308589|5.0|I confess--I, bcme123usa, have never been an office worker. Never have I been cubicled, managed, or downsized. But if I did, I'd have to take this with me. It seems to be a source of sanity in a seemingly mental and mad world. Forget the Dilbert Future; Adams is to good at writing and sattiring the present.
B000051VWW|5.0|Well, I think that all is already said before for all the fans of Sade.<br />Could be that someone will miss the sexy sound of the saxo, but I think that we have to left Sade to do whatever she (and them) wants, because they do it thinking of us, right?<br />So, I think that this evolution in the Sade sound is excellent, beautiful and wonderful. Only Sade can change their ways being true to themselves. <br />For me, the best song in the album is the one called &quot;Lovers Rock&quot;. I think that it defines the return of the best band ever, and also defines their new vibes. Absolutely fabulous.<br />Obviously, I found the rest of songs so much beautiful, but I don't know why, &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; have took my heart.<br />The queen is back and we have to enjoy her return... Last, I would like to thank you, Sade, for bring your talent to all of us...You're lovely Sade! Love and peace
B00005BF9Z|2.0|Ive been a Manu Chaos fan since his firsts steps with Mano Negra.  I believe that one of the best records in years is his sensible and amazing &quot;Clandestino&quot;. But why i didnt like this one?? First of all, &quot;Prxima Estacin...&quot; its too much similar to his first one record. Ok, I can say that every artist has always his own research and they play what they know.  But in Manu Chaos second record, I had this strong feeling that He took the &quot;B sides&quot; from their first work and created the second one.  So, at the first time, i felt that i already knew all the music that he proposed.  I never heard a new musical proposition this time in his album.  Second of all, and heres my nasty point of view, is that (I feel that) Manu Chao is NEVER involved as he did it in his first record.  Clandestino was far away a poetic album, with a lot of lyrics to think about how life is. I mean, He talked about misery, about deep feelings, about the situation of a lot of people around the world. But He didnt make it this time. Hes less sentitive and his lyrics are absolutely empty.  So, if you want to hear the music and you dont understand spanish or french lyrics, fine, theres a funny record, but, if you believe that life is closer than Manu Chao describes it in the first album, forget his last record and find something else. Im very Dissapointed, really.
0064407667|4.0|Lemony Snicket has opened up eyes of all young readers by changing his story around. It is not a normal kind of story that you would see in every day life, but Unfortunate events that keep on happening to these 3 poor childeren throughout the series. He has a unique way of showing his talent in writing.Which is different and good.This story also has alot of humor. I recommend this book to all readers who liked to get sucked up in books like you are there, at the scene watching it happen. It is really a very good, well written story.
B00000IP3S|5.0|Blind Guardian... when I hear the name I think of this CD or, Nightfall in Middle-Earth. They have to be my top 2 favorite CDs. Melodic lyrics, insane guitar, beautiful riffs and solos... Instrumentaly they just cannot be beaten! Their lyrics are great, great message with deep meaning (if you think about them a little). I *HIGHLY* recomend this CD to metal fans. Although they don't try to be hardcore as the current metal trends in the US run, this CD is absolutly beautiful.
B00000K2W1|4.0|what can i say? this is definatly janis at her best.the slection of tracks are great. and the remastering truly breaths new life into these classic tracks.the songs are culled from janis all to brief but brillant carrer.when you listen to me &amp;bobby mcgee youll understand why kris kristofferson would say.yeah i wrote that song. but it will always be janis.
0452282152|5.0|&quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; is a brilliant work of historical fiction.  Vermeer's works always seem to draw me to them, and this particular painting has been one of my favorites.  Unlike any of the others, except for approx. two others, it isn't painted in front of a window and other stills.  And even these two other paintings don't carry the mystery that this one carries.  Tracy Chevalier digs deep into the ambiguity surrounding this work of art to create an incredibly believable story about Griet, the girl with a pearl earring.  The supporting characters can be divided into two groups: likeable and detestable.  Frankly, I came close to developing an ulcer due to the behavior of one of the girls in the novel, which merely displays the good job Chevalier did with characterization.  To close, the historical authenticity is commendable, especially in the area of class structure and its rigidity, as well as Griet's descriptions of making the paint (the different types of materials used, grinding them, etc).  Chevalier leaves the reader with a vivid picture of 17th century life in Holland, which can make for a bit of a depressing book, what with how realistic it is, but really!  What book of lasting literary value isn't, in some ways, depressing?  So go ahead- read it!
0441172717|5.0|This book is certainly a classic. It ranks with Clarke,Heinlein, and Asimov.<br />&quot;Dune&quot; is set on the hellish world known as Arrakis. Despite the unbearable climate, it is a key planet in the scheme of things, for it is the source of the spice &quot;melange&quot;. This spice aids in space travel by augmenting the precognitive abilities of the Guidsman, those who navigate amongst the stars.Enter the family Atreides. The Atreides are the new owners of Arrakis, which was previously owned by the Atreides' enemy and rival family the sadistic, power-crazed Harkonnens. Add the fact that the Atreides ducal heir Paul may be the the Muad'dib, messiah of the Bene Gesserit, and you have an epic tale.<br />&quot;Dune&quot; is a novel filled with intrigue, betrayal, action, and other entertaining plot devices. It has very serious undertones of enviromentalism. Frank Herbert easily created one of the masterpeices of SF with this one. I heartily recommend this to any fan of the genre. You won't be dissappointed.
0062502182|5.0|This book tells a simple story, with extremely powerful messages. It is a book about finding your path in life and following your dreams. I could not put the book down. I have given it to friends and family as a gift because I find it so powerful and inspirational. It is a book that will remain on my book shelf and that I will read over and over again.
B00000JCOV|3.0|Slipknot is quite an intresting group, to say the least. Their music is good. Hard lyrics, fast beats, hard vocals. However, you just cannot beleive anything they say about themselves. Slipknot is a hard hitting CD, its deffinatly not for the nsync followers (although is would do them good to be forced to listen too it!). Surfacing's chorus, although repatative, is one of the most brutal sets of lyrics (not in a death metal song) that I have heard. Their 9 member band, however, should be better. I have heard better and faster drummers and their guitar use isn't very complex. With 9 guys in the band, you should expect more. I liked the CD, its pretty hardcore, but Slipknot could be better. However, I still highly recommend this CD, and eagerly await Iowa.
0451160916|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time.  Terrifying as hell, and I couldn't put it down.  The story itself is a masterpiece, and the King of Horror uses just the right words to describe every spooky detail.  I must warn you; don't expect to be able to fall asleep without the lights on while you're reading this, and for about a week after you've read the last sentence.  A true work of art.
0452282152|5.0|&quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; is a brilliant work of historical fiction.  Vermeer's works always seem to draw me, and this particular painting has been one of my favorites.  Unlike any of the others (except 2), it isn't painted in front of a window and other stills. Even the two others painted with simply a black background don't have the mystery that this one carries. Tracy Chevalier digs deep into the ambiguity surrounding this work of art to create, in my opinion, an incredibly believable story about Griet, the girl with a pearl earring.  The supporting characters can be divided into two groups: likeable and detestable.

B000005JAX|3.0|Hi.  I've been a fan of DM since '98 and have never been disappointed.  I listened to the clips of this album and thought &quot;I must have this&quot;, so I ordered it.  Martin Gore is unprecedented and brilliant, thought I'll admit - I much prefer the Basildon 3 as a group!  Keep it coming.
B000001GBJ|5.0|While there are some lyrics in a few of the Songs from a Secret Garden, for a vast majority of the album, the strength lies in the powerful violin and piano/keyboard melodies.  The title track, while hauntingly beautiful, sets a sort of &quot;going into the darkness&quot; type mood that almost the entire album follows, although there is one upbeat track(The Rap)on this album.<br />Some might consider this type of album to be background music, however I could not help but be drawn into the musically lead emotional journey that Songs from a Secret Garden takes the listener that is willing to go.<br />While I must admit that out of the three studio albums released by Secret Garden this one is probably my least favorite of them.  With that being said, I would still rather have this album as my lone choice on a desert island than 99.9% of what is contemporary music.  If you like instrumental music, or even if you want to try something different, give Secret Garden a try...probably White Stones...their other release is the best of their work, but after you sample what this incredible group has to offer, it won't be long before you want to add this album to your collection as well.
B00004Z311|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies since I was a little girl and I still love it. It is the ultimate fairy tale movie. The movie creates a changing mood of light and darkness that perfectly mirrors its classic central theme of good vs. evil. It is also the most visually beautiful movie I have ever seen. If you're thinking of watching this one just because Tom Cruise is in it you will probably be disappointed because this isn't one of his typical roles. If you are looking to see something original for a change then rent or buy this movie.
630280082X|5.0|I wasn't expecting very much from this movie.  In fact, I had only heard of it from my uncle because we were messing around one night with the 12 bar blues chord progression.<br />When the movie began, I was only slightly interested in the plight of a young Julliard student named Eugene and even less in the cranky nursing home victim, Willie Brown.  Eventually, however, the deep-rooted authentic ideas behind the movie presented themselves.  I was drawn into the quasi race for Eugene, wonderfully played by Ralph Macchio, to find out the 'missing' 30th track of blues virtuoso Robert Johnson before an elderly Willie Brown, played authentically by Joe Seneca, either died (to be sent to hell because of his deal with the devil), or lead them both to incarceration as `blues men' hoboes.  <br />The movie's climactic ending, with a slight twist in the plot, set up one of the most invigorating and suspenseful scenes that I have seen in a very long time (I'll spare you the details in hopes that you find out what they are...it's worth it).  <br />After watching this movie, I was left with the complete satisfaction that sometimes follows fantastic movies and is all too often missing from recent releases.  In addition I was motivated not only to buy the Fender Pig Amp featured in the movie, but also to learn the blues that was so masterfully portrayed in &quot;Crossroads&quot;.
B000002L9J|5.0|Without question, The Queen is Dead is the best album of all time.  Nearly every song is a classic.  I've had this album for 14 years and nothing before or since has come close to evoking the kind of emotions that this album did for me. In my high school class of 400, I felt like I was the only one who realized that all the hair metal bands with their sappy love ballads.  I must have played the Queen is Dead at least 100 times within the first couple months that I owned it. It was that good.  Morrissey is a genious when it comes to lyrics and I this he's one of the most under appreciated vocalists there ever has been. In addition, Johnny Marr's music is almost unbelievably good.  The Morrissey/Marr mix on this album is simply perfect. The other album that I bought around the same time that got almost as much play was \\"Lifes Rich Pageant\\" by REM which I still feel is their best album. <br />Imagine my surprise when I went to college and everyone around seemed to be listening to REM, the smiths, the cure, husker du, sonic youth...etc etc..  It was nice to see alternative music hit the mainstream and see all those hair bands fade into oblivion.
B000009RNM|5.0|This was the first David Bowie CD i purchased.  I first fell in love with his music and lyrics after watching the Labyrinth - I was unsure as to whether I would feel the same about this CD.  Upon first playing the CD I immediately recognised that it was different to my first impressions of Bowie.  Infact each and every song on this album is different.  But, I must say that this falls in favor of the album.  The constrasts and varying moods on this CD is exactly what makes it a local in my CD player.  As i mentioned, this was the first David Bowie CD I purchased and in light of that, it will most certainly not be the last.
B00005B6C9|5.0|Once again the brothers Gibb delivered.  Giving us a masterpiece of late '90's mondern R&amp;B, rock and pop combined with a little Lennon/McChartney and late 60's to early 70's tunes, this is truely something to listen to.  The title tels the story in itself, with both Robin and Barry taking lead vocals with very strong chorus.  &quot;She Keeps On Coming&quot; is a mixture between rock and R&amp;B, also with good chorus.  &quot;Sacred Trust&quot; protrais Barry's breathing vocals with Alan Kendall, again, doing his thing with the guitar solo.  &quot;Wedding Day&quot; is a usual Bee Gees ballad, again with both Barry and Robin taking lead.  The two rock numbers &quot;Man In The Middle&quot; and &quot;Déja Vu&quot; with Maurice and Robin leading respectively, are exceptionel good with a 70's blend to &quot;Déja Vu.&quot;  &quot;Man In The Middle,&quot; again with Maurice on lead vocals has the greatest harmonies on the chorus of all the songs on the album.  Again Barry soft voice comes through on &quot;Loose Talk Costs Lives&quot; which is a return to the 60's.  Barry is my favorite Bee Gee, but on this album a Robin lead is my favorite.  &quot;Embrace&quot; is all and all the best song of the album, and actually one of the best songs the Bee Gees have like in ever written - I wish it was a single.  &quot;The Extra Mile&quot; are again a true romantic Bee Gees ballad with again Barry and Robin taking lead vocals and &quot;Voice In The Wilderness&quot; being something different, closes the album very good.<br />&quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot;, well ...<br />BEE GEES RULES!!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|Although this cd really moved me, it is not for everyone, as i see. In my opinion, this is really a masterpiece. To me, it really doesn't matter that it is &quot;softer&quot; than previous albums. It shows serious progression and maturing of the band. However, some people may not see that, or they may just not like it. Either way, you should really think about buying this album before you buy it, because it's not like any other album that ive heard. Many &quot;true tool fans&quot; have changed their opinions of the band after hearing this cd, which is ok, but just be prepared for a new sound.
B000002KJL|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is overall the single greatest record ever recorded by Dire Straits.  Over time, to these ears no other release has managed to hold up so well over repeated listening.  From the opening racy track, 'Down to the Waterline', through the suffering, torn 'Six Blade Knife', the hopeful 'Water of Love', the Country-sounding 'Setting Me Up', the top-40 hit 'Sultans of Swing', the moody, dark 'Wild West End', and on through the incredible last cut, 'Lions', this is simply a smashing record from start to finish.  It's so listenable; in turns mellow and accessible, others melancholy and moody, this is truly a record of substance that mixes it up well.<br />I don't mean to diminish my respect and enjoyment of their subsequent work (and Mark Knoppler's solo efforts) by trying to explain why I enjoy this record over the others.  Take for example, 'Lions', which arguably may be the strongest cut.  The imagery is powerful but the music is understated-- much like the other songs on the record, the arrangement is simple but very effective.  Dire Straits would go on later to add horns and synths in 'Brothers in Arms', another great record, but even that effort cannot match the simple, enigmatic beauty and dignity of this touching effort.<br />Five stars all the way!
B000003GMI|5.0|. . . and this is no exception.<br />This is one of Porcupine Tree's several masterpieces! Fantastic, moving long songs, great eery, mystical lyrics and sound, just the most perfect harmonies -- you've got to have The Sky Moves Sideways.<br />Get this cd, and then pick up Stupid Dream, Lightbulb Sun, Signify, On The Sunday of Life, Recordings,and Up The Downstairs. You will be forever grateful since such purchases will pay you back 1000-fold in pure joy!<br />P.S.  I just saw Porcupine Tree in concert in NY, and that was undeniably the BEST musical event I've ever attended in my life.  This band is simply the best!
B00005IC2H|5.0|this is one of the most beautiful cds i have ever heard. the title of this album translates as &quot;a good start.&quot;  that being said, what's crazy about this band is that the members are only in their early to mid 20's, but have managed to make an album with a level of maturity that most musicians will never attain. at the end of the album, the lead singer states (in loose icelandic): &quot;when we went back and listened to this completed album, we found that there we things we did not like. we are sorry, and we promise to do better next time. this is a good start...&quot; how cool is that?
B00000ILBK|2.0|This film is a rehash of the seventh film, STAR TREK GENERATIONS. In both films, an old guy is about to die, but he discovers a fountain of youth that will make him immortal. Picard is tempted by it, but rejects it. Since the acquisition of this fountain of youth would result in the death of a small number of people, he must be stopped. He is stopped, and Picard and his crew share a contemplative moment, then face the future with renewed vigor. Generations had a better score, however. (McCarthy better than Goldsmith? Yep.) Better villain, too.<br />Every time a character said, &quot;Ruafo,&quot; the name of the lead bad guy, I remembered the Lost Boys chanting, &quot;RU-FI-O! RU-FI-O!&quot; in HOOK, the Peter Pan sequel.<br />Riker indicated in this film that the Son'a (stretchy-faced bad guys) produced Ketracel White for the Dominion. Now, if you were watching DS9 at the time, you'd know that the Dominion was taking over all the major Alpha Quadrant species (humans, loud forehead-aliens, and pointy-eared invisible skulking aliens) one-by-one in an all-out war. White was absolutely vital to their war effort. Thus, the Son'a were indicted by Riker as incredibly important collaborators with the mortal enemy of the Federation. Everyone kind of let that slide, like if I had told you, &quot;It was supposed to rain last night, but didn't.&quot;<br />Several months before the movie opened, I saw an alleged page of the script on the internet. I instantly knew it was a fake, because it had a stupid joke referring to the busts of the female leads. Turns out it wasn't a fake.
B000001FA4|5.0|Of all the impressive, oftentimes brilliant releases served up by U2 over the years, 'The Unforgettable Fire' still ranks as the most satisfying for me.  From the angry, raw-edged 'War', through what might be their most complete release, 'Achtung Baby', and up to their current release, 'All That You Can't Leave Behind', U2 has never failed to impress me with their musicality and depth, and it is really no surprise that they have been so successful for so long.  They simply make great music.<br />'The Unforgettable Fire' is not a flawless piece of work, however.  I think that the most popular single, 'Pride', is a little too repetitive, if classic U2 in sound.  An often overlooked gem is the short cut, 'Wire', which comes and goes with surprising brutality.  Very edgy, very, very good stuff!<br />My choice (and many others') for the single masterpiece on this album is clearly the cut, 'Bad'.  It has everything that you could ask for in a perfect U2 song-- musicianship, soaring Bono vocals sweetly done and profoundly moving, and the Edge's trademark guitar sound is always prominent, distinctive, and wonderfully varied.  <br />While 'Unforgettable Fire', 'MLK', and other tracks also hold up well over time, it is fair to say that this record is a little uneven overall.  I can't say that this is U2's absolutely strongest release from top-to-bottom (that honor surely must go to 'Achtung Baby' or 'War', and even 'Joshua Tree' and the latest release are worth that consideration), 'The Unforgettable Fire' offers us a glimpse of what U2 are capable of doing in their finest moments.  And surely, some of those finest moments ever are captured on 'Bad' and 'Wire'.
B00005B4GU|4.0|I loved, absolutely loved OK Computer, and have been waiting for their &quot;part II&quot; of that disc since.  This is quite close.<br />On another note, if you like Radiohead, THEN YOU MUST CHECK OUT . . . .&quot;PORCUPINE TREE.&quot; . . . . They are like Radiohead and Pink Floyd intertwined, but better than both in my opinion.
B000002L68|5.0|After the relative success of Prince's superb &quot;1999&quot; album, this soundtrack coupled with the blockbuster movie sent the name &quot;Prince&quot; into the stratosphere! Following Michael Jackson's &quot;Thriller&quot; which was still fresh from previous year's record sales, this was some achievement!<br />The immortal classic (and perhaps my favorite song of all time) &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; gave Prince his first #1. What is there to say about this song? It's simplicity is hard to explain... just go and re-listen to it now! And not Ginuwine's lacklustre cover either! :)<br />The rock influenced &quot;Lets Go Crazy&quot; was his second #1. Other highlights included the haunting sprawling title track with it's emotional guitar solo and lighter waving tempo, &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot; (Ignore Mariah Carey's dismal version), the thumping &quot;I Would Die 4 U&quot; and who could forget &quot;Darling Nikki&quot; and her magazine.<br />Although I don't rate this album as highly as &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;, &quot;1999&quot;, &quot;Sign O' The Times&quot; or &quot;Emancipation&quot;, it's consistently good and it's influence on both musical and cinematic Pop Culture could never be overstated.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|I am so embarrassed to say that I saw this movie. While I admit that there were some funny scenes, overall it was an overly disgusting gross-out. Worse than any other I've ever seen.  Actually, this movie turned me off of gross-out comedies forever. Maybe my IQ isn't low enough to find cruel jokes aimed at gays and the mentally disabled funny. As a 19 year old female I found it to be quite demeaning towards women, but what should I have really expected? As for the people who happily comsume this inane drivel, keep it. I used to love to read, maybe now's a good time to get back to that. Bottom line: avoid, avoid, AVOID!
B00004Z459|5.0|A great debut spinning up a whole new musical style by dragging korn to the edge of nirvana and shoving it in nine inch nails which is one of the many best combinations possible. I'm not saying everyone is like this cause everyone's a bit different and I myself am into really freaky psycho cool crazy music so I'm into nine inch nails and all that other stuff. And though I'm a true rocker, I'm only nine so linkin park is good because they take my favorite bands which all by the way are parental advisory and shoves them into a clean cd that truly rocks. So just relax and do the funnest thing in the world, jammin or moshin and just take it all of your mind and jam to something besidesw thirty second samples. Now how are you gonna do that without buying the cd?Figure that one out for me.
B000002HAJ|4.0|Hey they had a good run, 13 years so fans should be happy.  I am a big fan and have been one for many years.  Although this album is not as good as the three before it and some others it is excellent.  I just didn't get into wild mood swings the songs didn't &quot;stick&quot;.  Bloodflowers was boring and a retread so for fans this is a good pickup and the end of an era..
B000002LE6|4.0|After he shelved what he percieved as the darkness of &quot;The Black Album&quot; it was time to come with a positive message as one could die at any minute and be survived by their last statement, and do this he does.<br />From the opening declaration of &quot;The Reason my voice is so clear is because there's no smack in my brain!&quot; you are taken on a journey of enlightenment in what is still Prince's most spiritual album to this day.<br />Beginning with a defiant warning of The Devil in &quot;Eye No&quot; we then go into the only successful single from &quot;Lovesexy&quot; and  undoubted highlight of the album &quot;Alphabet St&quot;. With it's funky guitar, playful lyrics and imagery right through to Cat's rap it is a true Prince classic.<br />The next two tracks prove highlights also. The pop friendly sway of &quot;Glam Slam&quot; and the hauntingly, beautiful ballad &quot;Anna Stesia&quot;. Who could could forget the later's opening piano line!<br />The expected Prince love ballad is here in full force. &quot;When 2 R In Love&quot; which was the only track kept from the aborted &quot;Black Album&quot; (where it actually doesn't seem to fit) is a pretty, delicate ballad that falls a little short of &quot;Do Me Baby&quot; and &quot;Adore&quot; but is worthy nonetheless.<br />The album as a whole connected with some people more than others, due in no small part to the overt message of spirituality. The music however speaks for itself and there is something here for everyone. It is a worthy enough follow up to the essential masterwork &quot;Sign O' The Times&quot; from the previous year which is surely a great compliment! <br />Note: Even more impressive than the album are the awesome &quot;Lovesexy Live&quot; videos which show the very definition of a tight, entertaining concert, so search those out also.
B000001Y42|5.0|Limp bizkit is a one-of-a-kind artist who came on a mission to start a whole new kind of sound and start a chain of others who all have that same sound. A lot of artists out there try to start out like that on their debut, but fade out and end up with a fourth cd where what was fifty percent of the first album is a hundred percent of it. Now everyone wants to be Limp bizkit cause of the catchy tunes in faith,counterfiet,pollution,sour, and stuck. Let's just say this. Limp bizkit rocks!
B00000IMCW|5.0|This is without a doubt the greatest horror film of all time. Scary, horrifying, funny, intelligent, humorous and atmospheric, George A. Romero pulled out all the stops and created a sequel that well and truly rises above its predecessor &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;. I first saw this in 1988, and it was the first film I ever saw that not only made me want to see the sequels and prequels, but find out everything about the people who made it and how they went about it. In short, in started my love of film-making, as opposed to movies, but anyway back to the film...<br />A co-production with Dario Argento, &quot;Dawn&quot; picks up the story where &quot;NOTLD&quot; left off, depicting the collapse of society as imminent and establishing the four main characters (Two SWAT troopers, and two television employees) who decide to flee the city and wind up holing up in a large shopping mall beseiged with the living dead.<br />Watching the zombies staggering around the aisles and escalators is pretty obvious symbolism, but is still pretty potent viewing. Particularly when combined with Tom Savini's splatter FX and Goblin's superlative score (one of the best soundtrack's of all time in my opinion). The acting is realistic and the production values astounding for $1.5 million or so.<br />Unlike most reviews I have seen here, I totally disagree with the comments about this 127 minute version. This is the version that Romero wished to release, THIS IS THE DIRECTOR'S CUT, and he fought the MPAA tooth and nail to get it! The 140 MINUTE VERSION IS A ROUGH CUT and while it does have extra gore and extrapolation scenes in it, none of them add that much with the possible exception of one shot of Peter riding a trolley through the empty mall. In addition to which, that edition being an unfinished version misses out on much of the Goblin music that adds so greatly to the atmosphere of the film. It is certainly worth seeing and even owning, but I would not say it is any better thanthis version.<br />The extras are not fantastic I agree. The other Anchor Bay version (140 min) has two trailers on it, instead of just the one we get here. The bits from the Argento version are interesting, but nothing special (although it's interesting that Argento version has slightly less gore, a lot less humour and more talking!!), I liked the Monroeville Mall ad it was pretty kitch and funny. Extra scenes would have been great (but then Anchor Bay can't sell two versions), A featurette would have been cool (but you'll have to dig up &quot;Document of the Dead&quot; for that), a commentary would have been the best (but I guess Elite had the rights and George couldn't be bothered again), I think 5.1 would have really added to the film, but the Mono is clear and is all I've ever heard, so I'm not going to let it annoy me too much. I have seen this film in the cinema (both 127min and 140min) and both were matted at 1:66:1 like this, so that's cool with me as well. As far as I'm concerned this is the best film Mr Romero has ever done (surpassing NOTLD, Creephshow, Knightriders, Monkey Shines and Martin), and was and is and probably will always be THE BEST HORROR FILM EVER CREATED. Much respect to George A. Romero and thank you for the only film I have seen over 100 times and still find fresh.
B000002L7R|4.0|A lot of bandwagon &quot;fans&quot; of Prince's sixth album &quot;Purple Rain&quot; immediately jumped ship on hearing this. Maybe commercially speaking he should have waited longer for the Purple Rain hype to die down but this was a different set of sounds and messages to that monumental classic and was never equipped to come close to it's predecessor's mainstream appeal.<br />Prince I am sure realised this himself, but being the artist he is, rushed it's release through, as always thriving on experimentation and spontaneity. I feel he was right to stay real to himself as although not a record label's dream follow up it is still an artistically rewarding work for the listener. While looking back now however we should understand the reaction at the time would be relative to different set of issues, not least &quot;Purple Rain Mania&quot;. :)<br />This album was as mentioned above not very commercial in it's overall sound apart from two singles. &quot;Raspeberry Beret&quot; is a well known Prince standard and its summertime sway and wandering strings add to make a Beatle-esque Pop classic. &quot;Pop Life&quot; was a simple commentary on the music industry that Prince was now central to and he is harshly critical towards cocaine users within the lyrics. It is also a very accomplished song.<br />Other highlights include the Eastern influenced title track, another Beatles-psychadelic (The Beatles seem a big influence on this album right upto the cover art) type song speaking of a Utopia &quot;Paisley Park&quot; (The name of Prince's newly established label and recording studio at the time) and the tender ballad &quot;Condition Of The Heart&quot; which although beautiful never quite reaches it's awesome potential in my opinion. Also be sure to check out the album-worthy B-side &quot;Shes Always In My Hair&quot;.<br />Perhaps understandably, this album will be favoured by the more hardcore Prince fan due to the lack of his more trademark &quot;popular&quot; music. Howeveranyone with a love of good  experimental music should not be discouraged from exploring this deeply textured journey &quot;Around The World In A Day&quot;.
B00000292K|4.0|I think this is Miles' best studio LP between 1972-1975. I love the way it just cuts in at the start, obviously in the middle of a take. The 1st 4 minutes of side 1 are great, with amazing groove and synchopation that matches anything JB or Sly Stone could do. But you can't really listen to this all the way thru in one go, and side 2 is just plain dark and scary. And if there is any Wah-Wah trumpet on this LP, then it's a hell of a lot more listenable than on &quot;Get Up With It&quot;.
B000002L9B|5.0|This richly textured album consolidated the core fanbase after others had dropped off during &quot;Around The World In A Day&quot; and although &quot;Under The Cherry Moon&quot; the film was harshly criticized the soundtrack on the whole was received very well.<br />The obvious highlight is the pop-funk masterpiece &quot;Kiss&quot;. Once  mixed by David Z and Mazarati, this originally blues based song was given life. It's simple stripped down drums and funky wah-wah guitar lick couple with Prince's mischievious falsetto equal one of his trademark singles and most defining moments. NOTE: Tom Jones' version is to be avoided. Such a shame that some people associate the song with him before Prince.<br />The album as a whole contains a big French influence garnered in so small part from the movie, which was set on The Riviera. This is best displayed in the funky and fun &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot;.  There is also a lot of intrumental experiementation, plenty of hand cymbals and even a Big Band on the opening cut &quot;Christopher Tracy's Parade&quot;. Soul however is as always at the root, with the horn section helping Prince give an old school soul review vibe, particularly for the album's tour.<br />Another personal favourite of mine is &quot;Anotherloverholenyohead&quot;. With it's P-Funk style title and swaying Stevie Wonder-esque sound it's a really cool track. The following &quot;Somtimes It Snows In April&quot; is a beatiful, patient, ode to a departed friend and good closure to the album.<br />In short don't associate this soundtrack with the negative feelings some hold about the film it's taken from. This album again showed Prince's rich diversity and ranks amongst his most essential work.
B0000029LG|4.0|This double cd creation by Michael Jackson is wonderful, no doubt. However, following the events of the early nineties, Michael Jackson became jaded by the terrible events which slandered his name. This departure from innocence is painfully obvious on HIStory. It was slightly painful to listen to Michael's absence of joyfulness which used to pepper his albums. That's why this album gets only a 4 1/2.
B000002LHX|3.0|Although containing some memorable musical moments, the album is overshadowed by the massive blockbuster movie from which it came. The songs are more geared to appease the film's mainstream audience (many of which who wouldn't be Prince fans) than serious artistic statements from the man intended for his personal fanbase.<br />This said, the purple vibe remains and the usual memorable moments are present. From funky work like &quot;Electric Chair&quot; and &quot;Partyman&quot; to tender ballads &quot;Arms Of Orion&quot; and &quot;Scandalous&quot; good music remains intact.<br />The biggest hit &quot;Batdance&quot; is in the main a collection of dialogue from the &quot;Batman&quot; film set to a cool backing track, but is still fun and enjoyable in a quirky way.<br />This is also the case with the album as a whole and although worthwhile in the context of being a film soundtrack, in the scheme of Prince's career it lacks the depth of his other work and few of the tracks here will go down amongst his greatest.
B00003CXS4|5.0|I really don't care that Guy Ritchie is married to Madonna. It hasn't affected his moviemaking talent. I loved Lock, Stock; I loved Snatch. It's hilarious, scary, splendidly edited and, best of all, features Brad Pitt in, arguably, the best performance of his career. Every time I start to wonder about why (aside from his looks) he has a career at all, I'm reminded that, to me, he was the only redeeming feature in Thelma and Louise. In Snatch he is perfection: the incomprehensible dead-on Irish blather, the banty-rooster fighting fists, the mother-loving sentiment; the entire package is just fabulous. Don't miss this one, even if you have to rewind a lot to figure out what people are saying (sometimes they're not actually saying anything!) just go with it. It's a completely unpredictable, very very funny ride (with some genuinely frightening moments). Not to be missed.
B000002ADT|5.0|When I first got this CD, I didn't really get it; it was nice, groovy, with a real blues feeling, but it didn't blow me away.  I went on and bought some of Miles's later works, and then about two years later came back to this one.  It knocked me flat.  On his spare yet melodic solo on &quot;So What&quot;, Miles says more than most trumpeters say during their entire careers.  And Coltrane: I love all his stuff, from the first recordings with Miles all the way up to Interstellar Space, but his playing here may be the best of his career.  His dense solos push and pull at the rhythm section but never to the detriment of the music.  Cannonball's jubilant, swinging playing on the alto is an effective foil to the other two horn players.  Bill Evans's enigmatic, abstract piano playing is often overlooked but is absolutely essential to the album.  The tunes are just as great as the musicians -- &quot;So What&quot;, &quot;All Blues&quot; and &quot;Freddie Freeloader&quot; (where Wynton Kelly subs for Evans and shows what bluesy, funky playing is all about) merge improvisational perfection with effortless swinging.  The ballads are a little more obscure, but just as rewarding; even for Miles and Coltrane, two of the greatest ballad players in jazz, these are landmark performances.  &quot;Blue in Green&quot; is [forgive the cheesy simile] like a placid lake at sunset (Evans really shines here), while &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot; conjures up a mood of utter solemnity.  Even if this album doesn't hit you immediately, give it another shot.  There are always more wonderful nuances to be discovered.  Kind of Blue is the perfect gateway into jazz music.
B00005K3OT|4.0|I liked this film, although it got draggy in spots. And while I would watch anything with Johnny Depp, his Irish accent comes and goes (unlike, say, Brad Pitt's in Snatch which was brilliantly incomrehensible throughout) and is something of a distraction, although his presence onscreen never is. Most of the film is beautiful photographed, except for certain scenes where Binoche is not lit to advantage and therefore made to appear less beautiful than she actually is.<br />The saving grace of this film is the performances, notably by the children involved, by the magical Lena Olin (who's never turned in a less than fluid performance in her entire career), by Binoche who is growing nicely as an actor, and, always, by Judi Dench. Here is an actress who can take control of any scene without any effort but simply by dint of her formidable presence.<br />The story itself is somewhat cliched; the pacing could've been improved with some judicious editing. But the costumes and settings and, of course, the chocolate confections make this an entertaining film--definitely worth seeing, as long as you're not in a hurry.

0783225857|5.0|Certain films define not only their particular genre, but also their country. For me, as a Canadian, this film has always embodied the best and worst of what exemplifies southern American culture. It deals with children, with racial issues, with the persistent matter of &quot;differentness&quot; that lies at the heart of every person's most significant issues. To be &quot;different&quot; is to be isolated; it's an issue that embraces personality, ethnicity, skin color, economic level--everything, really. And this film deals with that matter on several levels. It is, to my mind Gregory Peck's more memorable performance, embodying as he does the ideals by which we can only try to live. And it was Robert Duvall's debut film performance as the spooky, seldom-seen, but everpresent Boo Radley. This is, in the truest sense, an American classic: affecting, powerful, and wonderfully faithful to the book.
B000002552|3.0|A few thoughts on the official Columbia Records Basement Tapes album:<br><br>The informal sessions recorded during the summer of 1967 mostly at Big Pink in West Saugerties, New York, are one of the essential bodies of work in the history of American music, as rich in their manner as the Louis Armstrong Hot Fives and Sevens, Robert Johnson's 1936 - 37 recordings, or Hank Williams' MGM recordings. Their beauty is such that even this dodgily compiled and inferior sounding official release from 1975 cannot diminish their importance and their influence on an entire generation of musicians. <br><br>As a few reviewers have noted on this page and elsewhere, the album as released is a bit of sleight-of-hand. The vast majority of tracks by The Band included here were not in fact recorded at the same time, or even in the same place (the legendary \\"Big Pink\\") as the Dylan tracks here. Partly, this is attributable to Robbie Robertson's disturbing tendency to obfuscate his own role i!n the formation of The Band's signature sound, and his de-emphasis of the collaborative nature of this wonderful group. In 1975, Robertson and Rob Fraboni compiled the official Basements album, and Robertson included a group of Band tracks on the official album, presumably to allege that he was writing songs along with Dylan at Big Pink. Unfortunately, there's little evidence to support this inference. The Band's earliest self-penned songs often came from Richard Manuel, who unfortunately is not alive to attest to his role in the Band's early years. Rick Danko is also no longer with us, while Garth Hudson and Levon Helm are generally disinclined to speak about the matter, leaving Robertson to parlay his falsehoods unchecked. In the wake of the Capitol reissues, most of The Band recordings supposedly from the Basement sessions have now been restored to their rightful chronology, and with mostly correct recording information, and much-improved sound quality. \\"Yazoo Street Scanda!l\\" (recorded January 10th, 1968), \\"Orange Juice Blues,\\" \\"Katie's Been Gone\\" (both likely recorded in September 1967), \\"Long Distance Operator\\" (written by Dylan, recorded in Los Angeles, February 21st, 1968), and \\"Bessie Smith\\" (recorded sometime between 1969 and 71) all postdate the actual Big Pink sessions. All of these tracks were subjected to manipulations in the studio, most likely in 1975, to make them more 'lo-fi' and to make them better fit in with the true Big Pink recordings of summer 1967. For the lowdown on this, see also Dave Hopkins' article \\"The Band Remasters,\\" on The Band's website, and Barney Hoskyns' rejected (by Robertson, for reasons that become clear once the two sets of liner notes are compared) liner notes to the first four Band reissues. <br><br>It seems that Robertson was introduced to the practice of taking credit for things he did not do quite early on: Several of the tracks recorded with Ronnie Hawkins in the early 1960's bore writing credits that !listed Robertson as writer or co-writer of songs he definitely did not write. Roulette Records label boss Morris Levy seems to have left an impression on Robertson in this respect, assigning writing credits to his girlfriend and Robertson, as well as Levon Helm, presumably for the purposes of personal gain. The disturbing aspect of this is that it underscores what has been, for Robertson, a career-long tendency to obscure the facts surrounding his recorded output. <br><br>Recently, bootleg albums of the proper Big Pink material have featured much better sound quality than even the legendary 5 CD bootleg The Genuine Basement Tapes. Whether these new, official release quality mixes of these recordings were prepared by bootleggers or by Columbia/Sony in preparation for a future and much needed official release of the complete Basement Tapes (possibly as further volumes of the Bootleg Series) is open to debate. What is important at this point in time is the knowledge that the ster!eo recordings made at Big Pink, given proper treatment, can be released in excellent stereo sound quality, almost on par with recordings made in a 'proper' recording studio. When will the world at large be able to easily obtain recordings of important Dylan works such as \\"The All American Boy,\\" \\"Sign on the Cross,\\" \\"I'm Not There,\\" the superior alternate take of \\"Too Much of Nothing,\\" the hilarious and entirely different alternate of \\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere,\\" plus fine alternates of \\"Nothing Was Delivered,\\" \\"Odds and Ends\\" and much more? What of the many, many wonderful cover songs recorded during the Big Pink Sessions: \\"Bonnie Ship the Diamond,\\" \\"The Banks of the Royal Canal,\\" \\"Four Strong Winds,\\" \\"(Now and Then) There's a Fool Such as I,\\" and many, many more? How about the wonderful-sounding undubbed stereo versions of \\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\\" \\"This Wheel's On Fire\\"? Columbia Records, when are these recordings going to available to those who don't care to wander through th!e numerous and varying bootlegs of this material? <br><br>An interesting if highly conjectural account of these recordings and their role in American Culture can be found in Greil Marcus' sometimes-brilliant, sometimes-aggravating book-length study, Invisible Republic. A more concise, fact oriented and sometimes-vitriolic account of the official album's deceptive nature can be found in Dylan scholar Clinton Heylin's book Bob Dylan: The Recording Sessions, pages 54 - 68. <br><br>I do recommend this album as an inexpensive and readily available introduction to the still mostly hidden glories of the Basements. Until Sony/Columbia or Dylan decides to grace this world with an official proper release of this material, The Basement Tapes double album will have to suffice. It's a great listen, really. Nothing at all like Blonde on Blonde, which preceded it, or John Wesley Harding, which followed it. The Basement music is timeless, deathless, often beautiful, sometimes humorously beaut!iful, sometimes poignant, and occasionally absolutely ravishing in its' exploration of what lies at the heart of what Greil Marcus termed the \\"weird, old America.\\" Robertson's terse, economical guitar solo at the end of \\"Goin' to Acapulco\\" is a gem all by itself. Don't miss it.
B000002UAX|1.0|This is, flat out, the most self-loving album ever made.  Actually, I used to listen to the Beatles, then of course I turned 12.  They made no significant impact on music;  if they weren't making disposable teen-pop melodies (i.e. \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\") they were making artsy-fartsy [stuff] like \\"Wild Honey Pie\\".  I would love to hear the pitch session for that song:  \\"hey Paul, let's say the same thing over and over for 30 seconds!  It'll be brilliant!\\"  I'll be that was John Lennon's idea, only his stupidity could come up with that.  And while we're on him, let's talk about \\"Revolution No. 9\\"  Okay, people think Axl Rose got self-indulgent on \\"November Rain\\", but at least that was a song!  Rev. 9 is purely the stupidest thing ever laid down in a recording studio.  Period.  And you wanna talk about uninspired lyrics, look at \\"Why Don't We Do it in the Road\\" or \\"Helter Skelter.\\"  That is some of the worst songwriting I have ever had the displeasure of hearing in my entire life.  Of course, since it was the Beatles, people pinned some kind of great artistic merit to it, without even considering the fact that it [may not be very good].  The only reason this has one star is because I can't give it 0.  If I could, believe me, I would.  In fact, I would probably give it less than zero if at all possible.  I know you Beatles fans are probably gonna think I'm just some jealous wacked-out crack addict.  But let me tell you this right now:  you only think they're the best because you've been pre-programmed to believe that.  You've had it shoved down your throats that they're the greatest ever, so you buy it.  But, if you tell a lie enough times, you start to believe it.
B00003CXPC|5.0|A fine story about perusing a dream. The ticket office clerk said `It's a beautiful movie', and yes, he was perfectly right. You can learn the plot in other places, I would like to concentrate on what to my mind is making this movie good. <br />First of all, a solid acting of the lead of Billy Elliot and some good moves from father Eliot. The kid was able to behave mature, well trained, naturally in the whole line of acting to create a coherent character of a struggling boy, obsessed by the idea, weakened by not knowing what would be right, and still strong to allow us to feel it. Guess for that we have to thank the director, who really could mould the script in a living action, driving the audience to empathy. The story line is interesting and not banal. Actions do not flow by a one- track algorithm, there are hints, but it feels like a life. We know Billy will have to stand up to his father, but he does it in a difficult, comical and not transparent way.<br />I can perceive symbols, like the rusty metal fence, opposite to the alluring endless sea or the bridge and more. They just are, noticeable or hidden. Some redundant to my mind details are the homosexual line, or revolving of 11-years-olds around sex issues, which is probably a tribute to common thinking, because they are not really needed to open the characters. In overall, the director's feel of reality and proportion is what that make the film so well-paced. Almost no exaggerations, precise timing. <br />There is no sweet American-style `work-and-be-great' fanfarous finale, which feels fine, although audience might have wanted to see Billy playing the prince, not a swan in the episode with the `Swan Lake',  but this is just a minor detail, maybe designed to underline the consistency of the likable good character.<br />D. Sun
B000002HAJ|4.0|This album does not approach the beauty of The Cure's masterpiece Disintegration. Make no mistake, though - it's good. It has absolutely all of their trademarks - strange, otherworldly guitars, memorable melodies, and as always, epics of depression punctuated by a few maniacally happy moments.<br />Musically, there's nothing on here that approaches, say, the bass line of &quot;Prayers for Rain&quot; or the bizarre strings of &quot;Lullaby&quot;. Furthermore, the production makes some songs sound almost the same, which is probably the reason why I'm docking the whole thing a star. Lyrically, Smith touches on old favorites - betrayal, weariness, emotional inertia. The defining moment is assuredly &quot;From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea&quot;, one of their best songs with some of their best guitarwork ever - if it's possible to make a guitar sound like an ocean, they do it right there. &quot;A Letter to Elise&quot; is one of Smith's best ballads; &quot;To Wish Impossible Things&quot;, with its violin, is beautiful. However, there are other things here, like &quot;Cut&quot; and &quot;End&quot; which really make no lasting impression (as opposed to, say, &quot;Disintegration&quot;). And lastly, there are the upbeat mega-happy songs, which one is never sure how to view. <br />Well, the mood may appear higher with the bright cover art and songs like &quot;Friday I'm In Love&quot;, but underneath that the album may be Smith's most tortured, and even the happy parts aren't really all that happy if you look at them closely. I found it to be less accessible than Disintegration, in fact, despite having become more popular - finding the true gems required several runs. It's not entirely consistent, but when it shines, it shines really brightly.<br />(Small note: of particular interest are some of the B-sides to this album. The B-side to &quot;A Letter to Elise,&quot; a song called &quot;The Big Hand,&quot; is one of The Cure's all-time best, and better than much of the material on Wish. Let's see a B-side collection now, guys, huh?)
B00005BJC7|5.0|I was somewhat let down with the Kid A Limited Edition when I got it last year... all it had were 8 pages of different artwork than the regular booklet (1 or 2 of them were actually just different angles of the same thing taken from the jewelcase version), and that was all. I was a bit hesitant to buy the limited edition of Amnesiac, but I just couldn't resist. Thankfully however, I am much less disappointed this time around.<br />Right as you open the book, on the left inside cover is a catalogue card (the kind you can find in the library) that has printed on it, &quot;RADIOHEAD, Amnesiac&quot;. The cool part about it is that there are fake due dates all over it, the words &quot;SPINE DAMAGED&quot; in sloppy handwriting, and the name of the college where the library this book supposedly comes from is, &quot;Catachresis College&quot; (I heard that catachresis is when you say one word in a sentence but you mean to use another?). And the neat thing is it looks really real. The due dates look like they were stamped onto the paper, the handwriting looks like someone actually wrote it... this catalogue card on the inside of the cover alone gets this limited edition five stars.<br />But there's more! After that are 32 pages of great Amnesiac artwork by none other than Stan &quot;The Man&quot; Donwood. Some of the lyrics from 'Like Spinning Plates' and 'Packt like Sardines' can be found in the artwork as well. I'm not sure if this artwork is the exact same as the jewelcase booklet artwork, but even if it is, this has got to be better, since they're bigger in size. Overall, definitely find this limited edition, even if you just started out liking Radiohead. If nothing else, you'll appreciate the faux catalogue card.<br />Once again, cheers to Radiohead, the best band of 2001 and to come!
B00003CXIY|5.0|First of all, I'm an film-lover. I like everything from the matrix to american pie and the old james bond movies. And this film I find incredible good. I've laughed so many times at the scenes in it with my firends. It's a comedy throughout the whole time, and the characters doesn't get all mossy and stuff like they do in other college comedies. And E.L. (played by the great Seann William Scott) is hilarious. His way of acting is incredible and I can't stop laughing at him. Of course not all scenes in this film is good, but I can't really find any terrible ones. Except one scene which makes you puke everytime you think of toast. Also hilarious in this film is Tom Green. His apperances with the mouse and the python that the pot-smoking wizkid Rubin owns is great. And no one can avoid getting a laugh when Rubin uses an handshake he've learned to get the guys into a all black studentorganisation. It's a great movie all together and I hope you'll see it. If any of my language is terribly wrong, or my spelling is then you'll have to excuse med very much.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is the definitive modern satire and deals with all of our society's 'pet themes' like racism, human idiosyncrasy, the horror of war, bureaucratic obtuseness and imprisoned lives. The distinguishing feature of this novel however is how much FUN it is to read: a pleasure from the first chapter to the last. Heller's caustic, poignant humor had me chuckling at least once per page throughout, something no other book has ever done for me. The acumen he displays in exposing our often circular reasoning was particularly memorable and is immortalized in the phrase Catch-22.<br />The book is far from a technical masterpiece - it is certainly not written in iambic pentameter - but the simple, lucid style and accessible register facilitates the progression of the story perfectly. As Albert Einstein said &quot;Things should be as simple as possible - but not any simpler&quot; and Heller honours this axiom very well. The only &quot;difficult&quot; element of style is the non-chronological plot structure, which can be confusing at times. Yet, even this serves a purpose, that is, to create an atmosphere of confusion that adds to the overall effect the novel has on the reader.<br />The delightful entertainment value of Catch-22 is an essential element of, and adds greatly to, its central virtue: the satiric exposure of human inadequacies. However much fun the novel is to read it remains a social commentary that - below the surface - is as frightening as any Stephen King novel. Heller strips reality bare, eliminating the hue of our opinions, the bells-and-whistles and comforting rationalizations; forcing the reader to look at the world - and himself - impartially. Pablo Picasso once said that &quot;Art is a lie that makes us see the truth&quot;, and Heller's artistic masterpiece shows us that reality is more frightening than fiction and after reading this novel I'm sure you'd agree.
0679879269|3.0|Philip Pullman's Dark Material's trilogy is a deeply layered artistic achievement.  The break neck pace of the first two books continues in the third.  The character development is some of the best I have ever read.   The creation of the fantasy worlds are complete and flawless.  However, Mr. Pullman destroyed the series for me with the final few pages of The Amber Spyglass. Though many would disagree, the ending was the easy way out, the cowards way out, and an artless act. There was so much talk about the human soul, and a series that began with soul ends by leaving this reader with an empty void.  The ending broke my heart.  However, the beauty of Mr Pullman's words has forever moved me. Despite being disappointed by the ending, the book should be read for its genius, beauty, and philosophic depth, but beware the ending.

B00004Y6TQ|5.0|Confessions I have to make before I write this review are multiple: 1) I was a Bjork fan long before &quot;Dancer In The Dark&quot; was released; 2) &quot;Dancer In The Dark&quot; is one of my favourite films ever; and 3) it is hard for me not to shine Bjork's tiny shoes whenever I proceed to talk about her. That said, &quot;SelmaSongs&quot; really is something else when it comes to movie soundtracks: it is here where Bjork really 'acts' as Selma from the film, composing songs that she is never accustomed to concocting on her albums, and delivering a valuable clutch of songs so beautiful and so un-Hollywood it is impossible not to be thrown by them. An Oscar for 'Best Original Score' wouldn't have gone amiss, now would it?<br />Album contains seven of the nine songs in the film, beginning with the atmospheric &quot;Overture&quot;, all big brass and powerful drums that confirms Bjork's ability to compose for a full-blown orchestra as well as a mixing machine. This is swiftly followed by &quot;Cvalda&quot;, Bjork's duet with Catherine Deneuve, beginning audaciously with rythymic 'whirrs' and 'clatters' until seguing into the silly, infectiously fun number. The Oscar-nominated &quot;I've Seen It All&quot; sees Bjork delve into a more ominous soundscape for a romantic duet with Radiohead's Thom Yorke. &quot;Scatterheart&quot; follows, full of menacing strings, jerky beats and Bjork's illuminating and versatile vocals. The favourite of the film squeaks around the corner straight after in &quot;In The Musicals&quot;, all squeaks, bounces and rousing strings providing a heady mix of overwhelming pleasure. &quot;107 Steps&quot; reunites Bjork with Siobhan Fallon, the only other cast member to make it to the album, to count the steps toward Selma's fate with a song by turns sad, uplifting and, Bjork being Bjork, audacious at the same time. The finale, &quot;New World&quot;, echoes the opening &quot;Overture&quot; and is purely too good for words ... okay, if this was up forthe Oscar, Bob Dylan or not, Bjork would have won it.<br />That said, &quot;SelmaSongs&quot; isn't a word-for-word rehash of the musical interludes of &quot;Dancer In The Dark&quot;. The first difference is Thom Yorke's increased presence on &quot;I've Seen It All&quot;, singing a few of Selma's lyrics as well as all of Peter Stormare's Jeff's. Another is &quot;Scatterheart&quot;, whose opening minute is the only part that bears resemblance to the film's version, &quot;Smith &amp; Wesson&quot;, both David Morse and Cara Seymour tellingly missing and the lyrics all totally changed. Fans of the film will be disappointed with &quot;In The Musicals&quot;, as it is Bjork's original concept as opposed to the musical conversation that takes place in the film between Selma and Oldrich Novy. And &quot;107 Steps&quot; carries on for another 31 steps (not a bad thing, but there you go). Reasons: Bjork has said she feels better working with musically-experienced pros as opposed to actors on her songs, and many of the songs were edited for the film, both &quot;Scatterheart&quot; and &quot;107 Steps'&quot; gorgeous codas ommitted in the final mix. Either way, what the CD has is beautiful in itself, and nothing is lost.<br />Another thing: both &quot;My Favourite Things&quot; and &quot;Next To Last Song&quot; aren't on this compilation, despite their dramatic presence in the film. I can think of reasons for both of their being missing: 1) &quot;My Favourite Things&quot; would have meant giving the guys behind &quot;The Sound Of Music&quot; a bit more money than most; 2) &quot;Next To Last Song&quot; was the song Selma didn't hold for herself, singing it for the whole world to hear; 3) if they gave you all of the music on the CD, you might not buy the film! In any case, buy both.
B000053VAF|5.0|Ok I wanted to remain silent on commenting on DOGMA until the special edition DVD came out. Well now it's here, FINALLY! And I am prepared to comment...<br />Now, in my humble opinion Kevin Smith is truly one of those filmmakers that really doesn't give himself the credit he richly deserves. I work in a video store, so, with the benefits I get to rent movies for free, and after a year or so I've seen great film (Smith's films included), but unfortunately, I also see films that are unoriginal, uninspired, and lacking substance (40% of those belonging to either Martin Lawrence or Adam Sandler). But Kevin Smith somehow manages to make something that tickles and stimulates your subconsious and makes you feel intellectually invigorated. Starting with &quot;CLERKS,&quot; the raw, gritty, and realistic look at the minimum wage hellholes that decorate our suburbs. Then the underappreciated &quot;MALLRATS&quot; a film that provoked watchers to stop a think about the things we typically never think about (i.e. the overpowering coital abilities of Superman). Third was the brutally honest and deeply emotional dramadey &quot;CHASING AMY&quot; a film that pointed out how important is is to focus on the now and also to trust your heart.<br />And then Smith's latest opus DOGMA.<br />Not since Albert Brooks' comedy &quot;MOTHER&quot; has there been a movie that gave me the desire to sit down and privately evaluate where I stand in my own life and the way I see the world, and more importantly next world. In total honestly, the people that shunned this movie needed to look past the ugly shell and see the deeper motivation of &quot;DOGMA.&quot; The implications laid forward by this film are really the most intelligent observations I've ever heard, and when I thought about them to myself I realized how much sense they've made to me. It now makes sense to me that God could be a woman, that Jesus was black and that these facts were omitted in order to hide the hardcore truth. Come to think of it those people have a mild similarity to Disney (who turned it's back on this film) obviously they don't want their audience to actually think! (Hence the succes of Pocahontas.) Fact is all of those films that dared to make the audience feel, have been given nothing but trouble (Just look at what happened to &quot;BRAZIL&quot;).<br />But Now I'll comment on the comedy and performances. I still state that Kevin Smith is still the only person who manages to make curse words sound natural and evenly balances with Smith's intelligent, and witty writing. His immortal characters Jay and Silent Bob, upon their hilariously heroic entrance seemed like an addition that would end up clashing with the idea of the film, but soon you begin to welcome their presence into the proceedings. The material as well is fresh, original, and risky. Not since &quot;Monty Python's Life of Brian&quot; was there a comedy that dared to use the gospels as a platform for off-the-wall hilarity. Only in this one, the humor is natural and is perfectly in character for this film, aided in no small part by brilliant acting. We truly see a versatility in Chris Rock we never thought was there. Damon and Affleck obviously have no trouble working off each other. Salma Hayek has successfully managed to say &quot;I'm sorry for my useless character in Wild, Wild, West,&quot; and played a role that always puts a smile on my face. Jason Lee is also a diabolical delight (as usual)as our villain Azrael. Alan Rickman is hilariously british, as Metatron, and our heroine Linda Fiorentino makes you genuinely feel for her as the film progresses. <br />But you get even more of these feelings as you watch the extras on this fully loaded Special Edition DVD. supplying us with with over 100 minutes of deleted footage. You must definitely watch the flick before you watch these scenes, so you can absorb the scenes. The scenes are more interesting to watch on their own. I agree with Kevin Smith that if the film had notbeen cut it would've been WAAAAAY too long, and fact is comedy was not made for 3 1/4 hours. But watching these scenes alone make some of the motivations of the film more clear to me. Plus, add Two great Commentaries from cast and crew and then you'll get a welcome addition to the View Askew DVD collection.<br />In conclusion, DOGMA has meant alot to me on a personal level. Because now, I've been provoked to give my faith a final evaluation and finally have thoughts of my own, and the fact that it's a comedy makes it moreso satisfying. You just don't get those feelings with a movie featuring a moron yelling nonsensical gibberish for an hour and a half.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|It roughly goes: if you like the film, you'll love the soundtrack. Many soundtracks sound great when mixed with the film but feel emotionally empty when simply played on a CD. Other soundtracks, great soundtracks, are able to stand alone from the film and help you to remember those moments from said flick that grabbed you. Listening to Clint Mansell's score for Darren Aronofsky's drug-addled nightmare &quot;Requiem For A Dream&quot;, I still get shivers in my remembering the tragic events of the film via Mansell and the Kronos Quartet's wonderful work.<br />Like the film, soundtrack is divided into three parts: Summer, Fall and Winter. Summer contains 15 songs, none of them over three minutes long (Track 10, &quot;High On Life&quot;, lasts a full eleven seconds) and all of them bearing ominous warnings for what's to come, key standouts being the tentative &quot;Ghosts Of Things To Come&quot; and the forboding &quot;Hope Overture&quot;, the latter being a mixture of strings and beats that wouldn't sound out of place on Bjork's &quot;Homogenic&quot; album. Fall has 9 songs, and it is here where Mansell lays heavier programming onto the Quartet's stuff, as heard on the first track &quot;Cleaning Apartment&quot;, and hints at the film's near-insanity at this point with the menacing mounting of &quot;Arnold&quot; and, particularly, &quot;Sara Goldfarb Has Left The Building&quot; (advice: listen to the latter extremely loudly). The Winter section starts with a jolt with the 19 seconds of &quot;Winter Overture&quot;, and never lets up. Amongst the insane screams of &quot;The Beginning Of The End&quot; and &quot;Meltdown&quot; (subtle titles if I do say so myself), however, some slower, sadder stuff seeps through, particularly on &quot;Ghosts Of A Future Lost&quot;, a theme built throughout the three sections that ends here on an emotional high, and &quot;Lux Aeterna&quot;.<br />Mansell and the Quartet are content with using many musical themes throughout the soundtrack, asthe distinct string arrangements that begin as early as &quot;Summer Overture&quot; continually reappear throughout the CD. This is also rather more obviously identified in the repetition in titles, examples being &quot;Dreams&quot;, &quot;Ghosts&quot; and &quot;Tense&quot;. But each track is given a tweak via Mansell's subtle mixing that contrasts with what is essentially the same song that has gone before. As for the congas: well, unless you've seen the film, you won't appreciate them as much as you would by simply listening to them cold (they sound like something Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer would do!) Fan of the film: buy the soundtrack. Fan of diverse new composers: buy the soundtrack.
B00003CX5P|4.0|The most anticipated Cinema event in years, The Phantom Menace is a movie which couldn't help but fall short.  Expectations were phenomenonally high and critics were not quiet about the fact that they weren't pleased.  However, the movie, when viewed without these distractions, is an achievement in it's own right.<br />First of all,the obvious:visual effects.  The wizards at Industrial Light and Magic outdid themselves.  Whether it was the CGI of the droid army or the wonders of Coruscant, from the light saber duel at the end of the movie to the pod race, the effects were mind blowing.  <br />A lot of criticism was aimed at the plot of the movie, which didn't move as fast as some would have liked.  We must remember that this is the first episode, akin to the opening chapter of a novel.  Lucas must spend time introducing us to the characters and setting the stage for what is to come.  We see Darth Sidious (aka the Emperor/ aka Senator Palpatine) manipulating events to suit some plot which we are not yet privy to.  We also learn how it is that the Jedi accepted the person who would ultimately lead to their fall from grace and near destruction: Anakin Skywalker.  <br />The best thing about this movie is the fact that it looked and felt just like a Star Wars movie.  After more than 15 years since the release of Episode VI it was great to hear the music and see the rolling introduction.

B00005LMBK|3.0|Somebody needs to say this and it might as well be me. Most of this album is all filler. I am the type of person who gets upset when somebody buys a cd and only listens to the single but that is what I find myself doing. Songs 1-4 are tolerable but not spectacular. 3 is slightly above average. The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 is because I liked tracks 3 and 5 and because I like the sound they tried to develop. I bought the CD after hearing Clint Eastwood because I liked the song so much. I figured since it was original and since it had so much talent involved, that the cd would be pretty good. After the first five songs the cd gets so bad that I completely forgot about the good songs that i heard before it. Everytime I would start to like a song something stupid would be thrown into it that was so out of place that it ruined it. Sometimes a group with talent tries to be so original that the album turns into original crap. If I was going to compare it to another album, I'd compare it to Beck's &quot;Midnight Vultures&quot; in that it throwws in catchy beats with strange, random sounding lyrics sung in an &quot;I'm tired and want to go to bed&quot; sort of way. If you like &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; you might want to listen to the other songs on the cd before buying it. Otherwise, you might be in for a huge dissapointment.
B000059HCI|5.0|This movie was thoroughly enjoyable, well-paced, and artistically sound, laced with subtle, sardonic humor and perceptive social commentary amid the tragedies of its characters.  Those few negative reviews which argue the movie is hollow at its core are inaccurate--the movie clearly shows the value of loving human relationships and how their loss causes and results from those things we use to numb ourselves--not only illegal drugs, but also tv, game shows, and food.<br />I recognized a number of people in this movie, some who have been mentally ill and others who have watched TV too much.  I can't help but think I'm implicated in the movie in several ways, or have been in various parts of my life...<br />This movie is an absolute masterpiece which, unlike shallow, fast-food quality movies like &quot;Traffic&quot; and &quot;Magnolia&quot;, actually powerfully shows meaningful, perceptive connections between drug culture and the larger culture with which it interacts and from which it springs.<br />True, the movie was at times shocking, but never gratuitously, in my opinion (unlike the vulgar, silly &quot;Magnolia&quot; or even the relentlessly hopeless, nasty and brutal &quot;Amores Perros.&quot;)  This movie, in little hints and clues, like the main character's desperate call to his girlfriend at the end, or the embrace between Ellen Burstyn and her friend, shows the value of love, something which our culture's materialism and intoxication often leaves behind...
B00000K0E5|5.0|As a self-proclaimed Bond aficionado, I have watched each Bond film countless times... And this is one of my favorites. Although it is Brosnan's freshman performance as the master spy, he tackles the feat with an amazing understanding of the character. And this is no &quot;Remington Steele&quot; repeat. The character is fresh, exciting and engrossing. To match Brosnan's acting, a brilliant script has been provided which contains nafarious evil-doers and &quot;larger than life&quot; action scenes. (For example, Bond chases the antagonist with a tank down the streets of Paris)<br />No matter how many Bond movies you've seen, this one will rekindle your love for agent 007 with a new and exciting storyline while keeping the classic plot features and non-stop action!
B00003CXHJ|5.0|U-571 is one of the best war films I have ever seen.  The DVD edition has awesome sound.  Especially in the depth charge seens.  Some things seem very planned such as an american knowing how to read german.  Otherwise, there aren't any other major faults.The battles with germans and the destroyer were great. This would be a DVD I recommend to buy.
B00000K19E|5.0|OK, if you don't own this movie, close your browser right now. This is, by far, the best combination of complex/fascinating plot, action, special effects and acting ever created. Keanu's role is kept carefully dry while the other characters reveal the dark, somber realities of The Matrix. Trust me, if you don't want to buy this movie, I'll send you the money for it, and you can pay me back when you feel like you've gotten your money's worth -you will watch it again, and again and again...
B00005A0RI|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful recordings I have ever heard. I have been playing it continuously for 3 weeks, but the music is so fresh I never get tired of hearing it. The songs are all ballads, but each song is so unique that the listening remains inspirational throughout. Gonzalo Rubalcaba displays his usual deft touch on the piano, and Pat Metheney's guitar work on Noche de Ronda is wonderful. The violinist is excellent, and Joe Lovano's saxophone work is superb. The unusual combination of piano trio, sax, and violin is different and fresh, and it really works. I can't recommend this recording highly enough; every cut on the CD is excellent. I would give it 6 stars if they let me!  &quot;Nocturne&quot; is a beautiful recording that will stand the test of time, and will find its way into your player over and over again.

THIS IS THE BEST THING I'VE HEARD FOR HIM IN A LONG TIME AND HE HAS A VERY &quot;IN SHAPE&quot; SOUNDING BAND THIS TIME AROUND. DOUBLE BASS DRUM, DOUBLE PICKING GUITAR, SCREACHING VOCALS, DEFINITELY CHECK THIS DOUBLE CD OUT AND YOU'LL GET A COLLECTION OF GREAT JUDAS PRIEST AND ALL ROBS SOLO STUFF.  WORTH THE BUY!!   ROCKSTEADY ALWAYS!!
B00004UEDQ|3.0|Don't get me wrong -- I really enjoyed this film.  There is the edginess of reality to the recovery angle.  I was able to go along with this humorous and emotional exploration of a very serious subject, but had some trouble with the hollywoodization of such (if there is such a word !!) It seemed to have the sense of coming from secondhand experience, not from someone who had &quot;been there..&quot;  I found the film life affirming and a gussied up version of what the struggles of addiction and recovery are about, and therefore worthwhile.  For a more in-depth view, visit a couple of Al-Anon meetings.
B000001ESJ|5.0|This truly is a musical masterpiece. With Geddy's singing and intricate lyrics from Neil Peart, and GREAT guitar playing from Alex Lifeson. Also, very good time changes. I love the songs that aren't played live, like &quot;Madrigal&quot; and &quot;Cinderella Man.&quot; Also, the great acoustic-intro on the 1st track is so inspirational. Rush's 2nd best album! Cygnus X-1 and Xanadu are the longest, well not so long after the intro. Great!
B00003CX5P|5.0|The minute I saw the first ever trailer for Star Wars, I was hooked!!  Even before the &quot;blockbuster&quot; lines around every known theater when the original came out.  I was first in line to see Phantom, and enjoyed it tremendously.  Almost a religious experience!  I am completely intrigued with how this is going to play out, the connection between Episodes 4-6 and 1-3.  So much food for thought and speculation is provided in this new film.  As a Star Wars fan, I thouroughly enjoyed this movie, but I believe it stands as well as a fine film in its own right.  The delicious sets, costumes, and the use of thought-provoking themes (the politics of doing the right thing, the apparently attractive face of evil, etc.) make this a worthwhile film.
B000053V9F|5.0|I loved this movie. The three hours went by very fast, and I was hooked from the very beginning till the end.
6302373921|5.0|This video is exactly what the producers of Mtv's idolized &quot;real life&quot; shows should have watched before taping. If you want to see a fantastic band go through a real tour, with all their demons and emotions, plus get the high from watching some real down to earth people who are fans like you and me, have an experience they will never forget! Personally, I'd like to see a 101 reunion, where are they now? Any Danny wherever you are, drunk by Alberquerque!!! I just can't get enough!!!
B00003CX5P|1.0|I can't believe that the most eagerly awaited movie of all time is such a waste of your time, everyone thought that it was going to be almost a religious experience, something close to what the first three movies (ROTJ weakest but it had it's high points). This is the movie that had the potential to beat Titanic from the #1 position, this was going to be something historical, something to be remembered, but nope, Lucas probably gave his old ideas from the 70s to someone to write the script for him, he filmed it and later sent it to his team at ILM, and guess what something mutated with muppets movies, star wars and Roger Rabbit came out, dissapointed millions of fans and made little kids crazy for stupid characters.
0316776963|3.0|David Sidaris' \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is the literary equivalent of Wonder Bread: fluffy, popular, palatable perhaps, but in the end unfulfilling.  Without question, Sedaris has a curious family and background;  his sense of humor (such as it is) is understandable both as to its origins and its indispensability.  What is surprising is that this persona , sounding so much like the voice of a bright freshman who's found his way into a narrative lit class, is actually coming from a middle-aged boomer.  A literary guise?  Some irony-building device?  Well, having seen the author on late night recently, I think not.  This is the man, a timid milquetoast befuddled by much of the adult world.  Paging Walter Mitty....<br />This book is a mildly amusing diversion of a man whose stunted vision shrinks before large ideas, diverse cultures, and experiences beyond his own deafening self-absorption.   I was expecting much more.
B000056K04|1.0|In March I gave this CD 3 stars, trying to be optimistic and loyal to a band I love.  I realize I haven't listened to this CD since April.  Why?  Because I just don't like it. It didn't grow on me. I never started humming the tunes idly at work, fuggedaboudit! I hope the new tunes will be good in concert this summer(looking forward to Hartford)From what I've seen of the set lists they're playing a lot of the Everyday tunes, which I can understand. If I could pick some Everday songs for the sets I see, it would probably be So Right and Everyday. Maybe after I see some Everyday songs live, I'll change my mind.
B000056QE5|5.0|I love all Disney films and I was considering buying the soundtracks of my favorite ones (Alice In Wonderland, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Mary Poppins). By carefully analysing the tracks of each CD, I saw that most of them had the song and the score weaved together all in one package. But I don't think I would like it or listen to it, I mean don't get me wrong, I enjoy instrumental music but it tends to get boring. So then I saw that the Mary Poppins album had only songs on it meaning that my problem was solved, I only bought the Mary Poppins soundtrack. Julie Andrews' voice is beatiful and not only did she win the Oscar for Best Actress, her interpretation of the son Chim Chim Cher-ee won one for the Sherman Brothers and when she sings Feed The Birds, it sends chills up my spine. Might I add that if you still want the other songs or simply more, buy one of the song compilation CDs like Classic Disney Volumes I, II, III, IV and V or (what I did) get the two Princess Collection albums, they are worth it.<br />And whatever you do also buy the movie, one of Disney's best live-action films and watch for Julie Andrews in Disney's latest motion picture : The Princess Diaries (in theaters August 3rd) which also has a great sountrack (if you like pop) but unfortunately, Julie doesn't sing.
B0000560XI|5.0|This is such a great title.  It is mixed in 2/2.1 but the audio is coded for 5.1 (3/2.1)  I don't know why people do that but I guess it made sense at the time.  Some music in the center channel always helps to localize the sound and this could have benefitted from the center channel.  <br />The recording is very well done and the musicians are great if you have a DVD-Audio player this should be in your collection.

B000000OAH|4.0|...But not much more. Jazz is quite disappointing, compared with the six wonderful albums Queen released before it - not a bad album, just not as good as the other ones, and not one you'd like to hear again and again. It's a shame, too, because it could have been much, much better. All songs Freddie Mercury wrote for Jazz are fantastic, some of them in the level of his earlier writing; by their next album, The Game, Freddy's writing began to deterriorate and Brian May and the others took over. On this album, however, songs by Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon are just not good enough and Freddie's great compositions are somehow lost. The album simply doesn't work as a whole.<br />Freddie's opening song for the album, Mustapha, is extremely enjoyable and shows great promise which, sadly, doesn't come true later in the album. The song doesn't make much sense, but Freddie's vocals and Brian's guitar are fantastic. It's really unique as well, showing Freddie's very original songwriting. 'Jealousy' is a beautiful song too, and 'Let Me Entertain You' and 'Don't Stop Me Now' are fantastic rockers. 'Bicycle Race' is probably the best song on the album, and ranks with Freddie's finest works.<br />Guitar master Brian May's music had always been more conservative rock compared to Freddy's experimental opera-rock, but always masterfuly written and performed. His songs on Jazz, although they're all quite good and well composed, are quite forgetable. 'Fat Bottomed Girls' is quite enjoyable, but is really nothing special and is not much more than a pale copy of great Brian May rockers like 'Son And Daughter' and 'Tie Your Mother Down'. The sharp wit of those two is replaced in 'Fat Bottomed Girls' with simple tasteless crudeness. 'Dead On Time', 'Dreamer's Ball' and 'Leaving Home Ain't Easy' are all good songs, but not one of them will leave much of an impression on you.<br />Bassist John Deacon's offerings on this album, 'If You Can't Beat Them' and 'In Only Seven Days', are particularily weak, copies of his wonderful previous works. Drummerman Roger Taylor does a pretty good job on 'More Of That Jazz'. It has a good beat, and powerful drum and guitar work, but is not much of a song itself, though it does provide a decent ending to this mediocre album (and a rather unsucessful attempt to make it appear as a conceptual album). His other song, 'Fun It', is better not mentioned.<br />Again, I'd like to make it clear that Jazz is not a bad album. It's quite enjoyable and 'Bicycle Race' and 'Mustapha' alone make the purchase worthwhile - but only after you own the other, much better albums. If you're trying to go for a complete Queen collection, don't pass Jazz by - it does have some good songs. If you're looking for just one album to try, get The Game for an energetic, hitful pop album, News Of The World for a rock album, or any of the first five for a real Queen album.

B00005BJXC|4.0|At 3 hours long, this documentary gives a good overview of the buildup to war, the attack, and the aftermath. The footage is &quot;average&quot; but does include a few minutes of original color from Hawaii before the attack and of the attack itself. The narration is competently done and takes the standard views of history. There isn't much new. I'd give it three stars for content, but I gave it its fourth star because of the price.

This musical takes you through the ups and bumps of a show business family (the Donahues).  From the challenges of mixing Vaudeville with child- raising to the complexities of rocky shoals adolescence common to every family, you'll be glad to share the Donahues' story. There's plenty of joy and outstanding hold-your-breath musical numbers, too (with music by Irving Berlin).  Plus, it's a rare treat to see American cinematic treasures Donald O'Connor and Marilyn Monroe share the screen.  Although the first half of the movie is a little slow, the second half  more than makes up for it.  The original trailer is the best extra feature of the DVD.  Otherwise, the video is just as good.
6305278016|5.0|Created in the late 80's, this movie is the classic EAST meets WEST.<br />Unbelivable performances by Michael Douglas, Andy Garcia and a JAPANESE STAR.<br />Michael Douglas plays the opitome of an anti-hero.  He's a dirty cop with more skeletons in the closet than the catacombes of Paris.  Yet, he's a loyal friend, an excellent detective, and is willing to improve his faults.  <br />The story...two NYC cops are forced to escort a YAKUZA (Japanese Mafioso) to Japan.  But to no fault of Andy Garcia and Michael Douglas' characters, the mafioso escapes.  Rumors in NYC and Japan run rampant that Michael Douglas took money for the freedom of the Japanese Mafioso.  The two NYC cops stay in Japan to try and help the Japanese police to locate this criminal.  The Japanese, in the classic we can do it better than anyone else mentality, really don't want their help.  They assign a highly respected Japanese Detective to escort the two NYC cops.<br />Michael Douglas is the Vaquero.  The American COWBOy.  Cocky, stubborn and eternally the tough guy.  The Japanese Detective is the stereotypical Stoic, BY-THE-RUles agent.  In a clash of cultures, the two derive a friendship that is pure.  <br />There is so many subplots and complexities that I've watched this movie 20 times.  I love this movie and rate it in my top 5 of all time.<br />It may have been created in the late 80's, but it stands up to the test of time.  Watch this movie over and over again.  If you don't want to dive into the cerebral...enjoy the fast paced action.

B00000K19E|5.0|If ever a movie was made for DVD, it's The Matrix.<br />It's not a coincidence that Professional Testers of DVD hardware use this movie as the Benchmark.  It's visually, aurally, and feature-wise the BEST DVD in the market.<br />I've watched this DVD over 30 times.  I don't mean I've watched certain scenes...I've watched the ENTIRE movie over 30 times.  If you throw in the number of times I've seen the &quot;FREE MORPHEUS&quot;, &quot;MORPHEUS vs. NEO&quot;, and &quot;MORPHEUS vs. THE AGENT&quot; scenes, and the features then I've probably logged the equivalent of a week watching this remarkable DVD.<br />I won't go into the plot...you all probably have all seen this before or heard about it.<br />I will go into the features though.  If you ever wanted to know how they froze Trinity in the air or how they did the bullet fire, you'll love it.  The featurettes are thoroughly educational.  Being a tech-junkie, I was enveloped by the teachings of the technical creators.<br />The play-along commentaries by the actor who played Trinity, special effects wizard, and producer are entertaining.  They were all in the same viewing room so the commentaries are conversational.  It really is like watching the movie with 3 of the key contributors of this GREAT movie in your living room.<br />If you are going to own only 1 DVD...THIS IS THE ONE.  If you just bought a DVD player...scroll up to the top of this page and ADD IT to YOUR CART!!!
B00004T37H|5.0|I loved this movie.  It is such a great story, and anyone who loves anime should buy it.  From the other replies here, you probably can tell how the movie is, but you should see it for yourself.  You should, because not only will you understand it better, but also the graphics are simply amazing.  The computer-generated parts blend right in, to create a scene like no other.  And this movie also gives you something to think about.  I suggest this movie to the mature audience, for the fact that is may frighten the younger viewers from the gore.  The reason I really suggested it for the mature audience is that it fits perfectly for people who are in the state of mind to take into consideration how much work and effort from the creators has been put into this movie.  It will give you a whole new idea on how to look at things.  Trust me, this is the best anime I have ever seen.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This is one of the best (if not THE best) movie I have ever seen...though it takes a certain artistic taste to really appreciate the beauty of the movie.  It not only has a wonderful soundtrack (done very well by Kidman and McGregor) but it is also funny, dramatic, and everything else that makes a movie a winner.  I would suggest that is you go to see this movie, you go in with an open mind, because it isn't your &quot;average&quot; movie..it has a lot of new and different ideas, but that is, I think, what makes this movie so wonderful. I highly recommend it.
0790729628|3.0|Let's face it.  This is film noir and without the voiceover it plays as a very thin story with a lot of beautiful visuals (unless you have some nerdy friend who can sit next to you while you're watching the movie and fill you in on all the background stuff).  As far as the ending of the movie, both versions end particularly well.  <br />A two disc set with both versions would be much appreciated, if highly unlikely...
B00003CXMG|4.0|What makes \\"Almost Famous\\" so much fun to watch is that it manages to capture a glimpse of the pop culture past without ever becoming heavy-handed, precious or sanctimonious in the process.  It clearly loves the rock music world it is exploring, yet the film is also clear-eyed enough to see that strange subculture in its totality - warts and all.  As he did in \\"Jerry Maguire,\\" writer/director Cameron Crowe shows himself to be a master at mixing disparate moods and exploring universal truths within the context of a light romantic comedy.<br />Based on Crowe's own experiences as a teenaged rock journalist, \\"Almost Famous\\" tells the unusual story of a 15-year old writer named William Miller who finds himself composing a behind-the-scenes article for \\"Rolling Stone\\" on an up-and-coming rock band called Stillwater.  As a part of the tour, William is privy to all the backstage shenanigans, interpersonal conflicts and free-living excesses that are an integral and inevitable part of any rock band's existence.  William sees firsthand the conflicts that arise when one band member seems to be rising in prominence and popularity often at the expense of his band mates who can but look on in jealousy and wonder.  William also observes how fame, fortune and recognition often require a compromising of both artistic integrity and the musical purity that made the members want to be rock stars in the first place.  Like all the members of the team, as well as the hangers-on, groupies and roadies, William is drawn to rock and roll because it speaks to some indefinable need in his soul - yet, he also learns, through observation, that much of the glamour is really a cover for the insecurities and emotional emptiness of the individuals who comprise this strange, life-in-the-fast-lane world.<br />Yet, all this makes \\"Almost Famous\\" sound dark and preachy - which it definitely is not.  On the contrary, Crowe keeps the proceedings light, airy and fast-paced thanks to the fact that William himself always remains such a clear-eyed, steady and likable young man.  William is the anchor that helps keep Crowe's movie real.  This wide-eyed fifteen year old seems far more mature and emotionally grounded than all the older people he is involved with.  These include the band's handsome lead guitarist, Russell Hammond, and a beautiful, sweet and radiant \\"band-aid\\" named \\"Penny Lane.\\"  As Penny, Kate Hudson literally lights up the screen with warmth, sincerity and vulnerability every time she appears in a scene.  She is truly a natural.  The same can be said for young Patrick Fugit who never hits a false note as William, making him a character the audience can identify with from first moment to last.  Billy Crudup conveys just the right combination of arrogance and good-natured insecurity to make Russell a complex and believable individual.  And the wonderful Frances McDormand steals every scene she is in as William's fretful, up-tight, but obviously loving mother, who can do little but stand back in open-mouthed astonishment, aghast at the \\"immoral\\" lifestyle of the people who have \\"kidnapped\\" her child.  Yet, at the same time, something about her child makes her trust that, when the temptations come fast and furious, his innate moral strength - the strength she has imparted to him - will triumph in the end.  Thus, she reluctantly and anxiously allows him to fulfill his dream.<br />Lovers of early `70's \\"classic\\" rock will adore the sound, the look and the general time capsule feel of the film.  Crowe has gotten all the \\"accoutrements\\" of the period absolutely right - from the shaggy hair, to the frenzied concerts, to the casual drug usage to the familiar tunes playing on the soundtrack.  \\"Almost Famous\\" is a movie to relax into, especially if you yourself came of age in that era.  It will gently carry you back to a past that seems both terribly recent and painfully long ago all at the same time.  Enjoy the journey.himself always remains such a clear-eyed, steady and likable young man.  William is the anchor that helps keep Crowe's movie real.

B00003CX5P|3.0|This movie would have been a decent movie had it not been set in the Star Wars Universe, but it was and compared to the other films it had a rather weak story line and horrible characters.

B000002KBU|5.0|When I was in college in the seventies, I don't think I knew a single woman who didn't own this album. Joni Mitchell put into gorgeous words exactly what it felt like to be a young wooman at that time. A couple of years ago, I dug out my old vinyl copy, remembering little more than a few lyrics like &quot;we don't need a piece of paper from the city hall,&quot; and expecting some really dated hippie stuff. Something embarassingly sweet from the old days. I was stunned at how well the songs hold up. There's not a bit of sixties' sappiness in it. The songs are simply timeless and wonderful. This is one of only a handful of vinyl albums that I've replaced with CDs because I want to be able to listen to it over and over again.
B00003CXRP|2.0|Try as it might to be otherwise, this is still a man-on-a-deserted-island story and there's a lot of campfires and spear fishing going on and a vague life lesson about deserted islands. The surf is much more inviting than the island which remains an unexplored vista. Tom Hanks watching the rolling whitecaps is a haunted, alien scene. Exactly what Hank's character is doing on that cargo plane is anyone's guess. And when will Helen Hunt stop agreeing to anything?

I love to watch a couple episodes after a bad day at work, it just makes me laugh and forget the idiots I was so upset about to begin with !! :) Miranda, Carrie, Samantha, and Charlotte are the best! I highly recommend this as a gift to yourself, just because, or a gift to a wonderful girlfriend!
B00005B4GU|5.0|Like atrixwolfe said, melody does not equal music. <br />This album isn't at all about listening to melodies.<br />It's all about the types of sounds Radiohead presents in their music. I've listened to Amnesiac on a pair of Sennheiser HD-580 headphones and I loved the album on first try - you need a very good system to fully appreciate this album because it will reveal all these wonderful sounds you've never heard on any music before. <br />My favorite songs would have to be You and Whose Army?, and the revision of Morning Bell.

B00005ATQI|3.0|Stanley Kubrick's &quot;The Shining&quot; is a rather disappointing movie.  He took a very good novel by Stephen King, used about ten percent of the actual story, and threw the rest away and made it into a Kubrick movie.  Sure, the novel was weird, but it wsa supernaturally weird, like any other Stephen King book.  But the movie was weird because it was a Kubrick film.  He made it very dark, and twisted, took out all of the greatness of the novel, and gave Nicholson an excuse to run around acting as crazy as he possibly could with an axe in his hands.  Sure, Nicholson was good in it, but I think he's really the only actor in the movie that deserves any credit.  Shelley Duvall just [made me mad].  Why was she in that movie again?  Oh yeah, that's right.  THERE'S NO EXCUSE.  I think she did a horrible job in this movie.  Wendy, Nicholson's wife in the movie, was an excellent character in the book, but in the film, she was just a whimpering, crying idiot.  And Danny Lloyd, what happened to him?  Where did he go? Currently residing in the &quot;Where are they now&quot; files or something? Wow.  Another thing that Kubrick didn't do a very good job on was the character development.  A movie needs good characters, especially a horror movie, and this didn't really get into the characters like the book did.  One thing it almost totally lacks is the relationship between Danny and his father Jack.  In the story, the two are very close, with an undying love for each other, but in the movie, they're just a guy and his son.  Also, the end of the movie and the end of the book are literally different.  The movie had a completely different ending.  In the book, the hotel explodes because Jack forgets to empty the boiler in the basement, another key element of the book that Kubrick for some reason left out.  In the movie, Jack chases his son around in the hedge maze (which isn't even mentioned in the book), lagging as far behind as you can get, which doesn't exactly make the chase atthe end exciting.  I wasn't &quot;on the edge of my seat&quot; the whole time.  Kubrick also left out the characters' feelings of total isolation in that icy hell of a hotel in the winter, which added some serious tension to the book, and maybe could've made the film a little better.  But hey, this is just my opinion.  The movie is okay, but I don't really recommend buying it that much.  The first time watching it is good, but for me, after that, it went downhill from there.
0780626966|5.0|Nightare On Elm Street films have always been my favourite horror films, so you guess how happy i was when this box set was released.  I like all of the films individually although my favourite one is number 3 Dream Warriors.  The creators of Nightmare On Elm Street managed to keep the series going by introducing new inventive ideas and deaths that made this amust watch film.  There are loads of extras that will make the dvd version more popular then the vhs one.  This is a must have
0790729652|5.0|Batman is the super hero movie all others look to for comparison.  With a tremendous cast lead by Keaton and Nicholson acting is something you'll never have a problem with when watching this movie.  It depicts Batman as the dark figure he should be.  The following sequels seemed to get worse every time(go figure).  They made him to comicy if thats a word.  Batman doesn't make the occasional wise crack or have a silver costume(stupid!) in this one.  Batman is kept dark and mysterious in this one which is a crucial part of the movie.  Nicholson's Joker was his best nemesis by far which is no surprise.  He was perfect for the part.<br />Instead of going to the sequels for more Batman entertainment I would recommend checking out the animated movie Batman: Mask of the Phantasm.  There are many who think that was the best Batman movie ever and seeing it myself it does come close.  Still this one is a must buy if your a fan or just want a great action movie.
B00000K19E|1.0|This film is so dull and boring and is a major dissapointment after the brilliant Dark City. It clunks along at a very slow pace every now and again throwing in a fight sequence to releive the boredom. It tries too hard to be too many things. It never reaches the mythological, adventurous or down rite fascinaiting levels of the four Star Wars movies. Neither does it bring home a &quot;man against machines&quot; message that the Terminator films do. The Matrix looks good just like Keanu Reeves. But like it's star it has nothing to back that up.
6305011575|4.0|First of all let me just say the movie was very entertaining.  I agree with many of the other reviewers when I say the first part was much better than the second.  My  main problem with this movie was going into it I was expecting to be freaked out.  While there were some scary parts it wasn't a terrifying movie.  I realize the psychological terror trying to be used here but It just didn't work for me.  The fact that the majority of the stuff going on is just in their heads just isn't scary.  Blood popping out of a ballon or a skeleton walking down stairs just isn't scary when you know it isn't real.  I'm not giving away stuff here but thats the whole basis for the movie.  It gave me the same feeling the Nightmare On Elm Street movies gave me.  I just say to myself, &quot;this stuff isn't even real why the hell are you getting scared?&quot;.  If you don't think that type of horror will scare you don't expect this movie to get your neck hairs standing.  I would have rated it a 5 stars had I not been expecting to be scared to death.  I think my problem is I need physical terror to really get me going like Halloween or Texas Chainsaw Massacre.<br />So if your looking for an entertaining movie ,especially for family viewing, with some scares this is a great choice.  If your all alone or with a group of friends at night I suggest you go with something else.  Go with something that will make you consider checking under your bed at night.
B000002JEV|5.0|The \\"BBC Sessions\\" is a blistering live set recorded between 1969 and 1971.  The first disc features songs two takes of \\"You Shook Me\\", \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\", and three takes of \\"Communication Breakdown\\".  Three new songs surface on this set, \\"The Girl I Love She Got The Long Black Wavy Hair\\", \\"Something Else\\", and Robert Johnson's \\"Travelling Riverside Blues\\".  There are also a few lines from Robert Johnson's \\"Kind Hearted Woman\\" in \\"...Riverside Blues\\".<br />The second disc is a full feature concert recorded in 1971.  Besure you have a fire exstinguisher close to your home entertainment system, you'll need it to put out the fire.

Don't get lulled to sleep because a feverous rendition of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" which feature three blues covers.  I read somewhere that Page had to edit out two other covers to get this track on the cd.<br />The second disc closes with a wonderful electric rendition of \\"Thank You\\".<br />This is an essential recording for your cd library without question.

I just could not believe anyone could want to torture themselves in this way.

B000002J03|5.0|Thirty some years after it's release many of the songs from &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; can still be heard on album oriented rock (AOR)radio. Zeppelin displays their swagger on &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, &quot;Ramble On&quot;, &quot;Bring It On Home&quot;. &quot;What Is And What Should Never Be&quot; starts off laid back, but don't be lulled to sleep because the boys &quot;kick it up a notch&quot; and Page makes things interesting by switching his guitar between the right and left channel.<br />Page also follows this similar production style on &quot;The Lemon Song&quot;. Chester Burnett (a.k.a Howlin' Wolf) is credited for writting &quot;The Lemon Song&quot;, it seems like a reprise of his song &quot;Killing Floor&quot;. An interesting note about this song, the line &quot;squeeze my lemon till the juice runs down my leg&quot; is a direct quotation from Robert Johnson's &quot;Travelling Riverside Blues but there's no credit given to him.  It would be interesting to know if there were ever any legal issues regarding &quot;borrowed line&quot;.  (See &quot;Robert Johnson: The Complete Recordings&quot;)  It's a great song never-the-less, it features Page's guitar pyrotechnics and Jone's steady bass groove.<br />Speaking of interesting production, notice on &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; near the end of the song when Plant sings, &quot;...Way down inside, Woman, you need love...&quot; that Plant's voice echo's first before the lyrics are said. It is my understanding that Page took the forward take of that lyric, recorded it backward, then played it again backward while recording it to the master tape so the echo would be first.<br />&quot;Thank You&quot; is a great acoustic ballad which features the lighter side of the band. Jones seems to float along in the background on the organ accompanying Page through out.<br />&quot;Moby Dick&quot; features &quot;Bonzo&quot;, I can set my watch to this track! This song starts off very similar to &quot;The Girl I Love She Got The Long Black Wavy Hair&quot;.

B000056QE5|5.0|If you were a child of the 1960s, it would have been hard to avoid this movie and its many classic songs.  Many of us are now passing our love for the film to our own children.<br />Dick Van Dyke screws up the cockney accent big-time -- comedians in the UK still make jokes about this.  Glynis Johns can't really sing.  Disney's attitude to women's emancipation seems, at best, ambivalent.  There is plenty here that wouldn't make it into a 21st century movie -- apart perhaps from Renee Zellweger's wandering accent in &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot;.  But it is these unpolished elements that make the soundtrack so lovable.<br />The Sherman Brothers rarely get a mention in histories of popular music.  Goodness knows why -- it is possible that more people know their songs than those of Burt Bacharach or Paul McCartney.  It's therefore excellent that this CD finishes with an interview with the two.<br />I normally review albums by the likes of Keith Jarrett, Deep Purple and Steely Dan for Amazon, and I had to think twice before admitting that 'Mary Poppins' is one of my favourite song collections!
078401213X|4.0|Pi is a different movie. It is fairly simple to follow if you get engrossed in it. I enjoyed just watching it. There are really no twists, not much mystery, but it has some holes. There is a lot of symbolism in this movie, that left me in the dark, but that didn't matter, b/c it didn't seem relevant to the story. A lot was left up to interpretation, but it didn't affect the understanding of the movie itself. I think a lot of the visuals were there just for the sake of being there, to maybe add some darkness to the movie, but not affect what the point is. It's really just the story of a man who challenges himself, but has come across something that is putting up a good fight. Max, the main character, is trying to find a pattern in the world, nature and everything. He uses math as his universal language , and Pi as his tool of comprehension. Eventually paranoia sets in from his level of frustration, and his fears become reality, in a way. See it, watch it, don't try to out wit it.
B000002UDB|5.0|This album would have to be one of my favourites based on the second 1/2 of the album alone.  The opening song &quot;MMT&quot; is a journeyman effort by McCartney - catchy but not spectacular.  Fool on the Hill is another McCartney composition - parts of the tune sound like he got a little stuck, but he recovers nicely.  It might have been elevated to a higher level of greatness if Lennon had contributed a bridge.  I find Blue Jay Way a bit tedious: the tune just isn't that interesting and some of the harmonies are a bit dischordant.  I think most of Baby You're a Rich Man is great - the instrumental intro and accompaniment wanders all over the place in a wavery but highly melodic way.  It is is really quite complex.  It is incredible to think that this song was put together in only a few hours.  An under-rated mini-masterpiece.  You're Mother Should Know is an excellent tune - if Paul had fleshed it out a bit with a better bridge it would be a classic a la &quot;When I'm 64&quot;.  Flying is another good tune and enjoyable.  Hello Goodbye is a terrible lyric, but the melody and counter-melody is excellent.  Penny Lane is one of McCartney's best - I never grow tire of this masterpiece.  Strawberry Fields is another Lennon masterpiece - The central tune is good but it is the instrumental accompaniment that really makes it.  Both songs should be attributed to Lennon-McCartney-Martin, because their producer lent so much to their creation.  The genesis of these two songs dates to late 1966 - what an incredible advance from their 1964 product!  Wow!  I Am the Walrus shows how an incredibly simple base tune in the hands of the Beatles can be enticingly interesting to hear over and over again.  The little bridges, composed by John and scored in a beautifully droning way by Martin, are very melodic.  A fantastic Lennon song.  A reviewer with a better grasp of the language might have more synonyms for &quot;great&quot; than I do, but it is hard to think of many songs that are greater than those singled out.  Lennon and McCartney were definitely in the zone in 1966-1967 when they wrote these tunes.  Rather than producing lethargy, those halucinogens combined with massive inspiration and a sterling work ethic seemed to aid rather than to hinder.  If you like this album, you should buy Rubber Soul forward, and listen as the Beatles evolve by quantum leaps every few months or so.
0767827716|5.0|This movie was released on DVD in Australia in about late 1999 which is when I bought my copy of Christine on DVD. The Australian release of this DVD has very good picture ( Letter Box format only ) and sound quality, but doesn't have the full screen picture option like the US version will have. If you are a fan of this film then I recommend getting a copy on DVD. I personly loved this film and I think this film is one of those classic cult films that you should at least watch once. Some people are so Impressed by this film that they even go and buy a 1958 Plymouth and paint it red and white like Christine and cruise around playing 50's music ( Some Australians have actually done this after watching the movie! ) and on the other hand some people I know didn't enjoy this film at all.      I read in some classic car magazine that they used something like 19 1958 Plymouth 2 door hard tops to make this film and that only 3 of those cars survived in running condition after the film was completed.
B00005BJ2O|2.0|So much of the music that made this movie GREAT is not even on the CD. Where's Like a Virgin? Spectacular Spectacular? What happened here? All these pop versions are fine as ADDITIONAL tracks but do not function as a substitute for the real thing, and that's exactly what's missing. I sincerely hope that a complete soundtrack is coming soon.
0894803123|3.0|There is really only one thing that I don't like about this book but it is a pretty big one for me. They don't have a sweet cream base that uses eggs that are cooked (you need to use one of the bases to make each recipie). I am not a huge fan of bases without eggs (like their #2 base which is cream, half and half and sugar) since they don't freeze well and really should be eaten right away. I would only recommend this book if you already have a base that you have had success with that has eggs that are cooked (which produces a much creamier ice cream than the non egg version).
B00000IQW0|4.0|But this one has nothing in the way of extra's. Still, If you love the show like I do, its a must have!
0446677450|5.0|If you look at some of the bad reviews, people are complaining there is a lack of &quot;how to&quot; in this book, and the author rambles the same stuff over and over again.<br />What you need to understand, is that this book is just an introduction on changing your frame of mind. It is not manual on how to get rich, but on what your thought patterns should be in order to get there. Since 80% of the population has the typical thought patterns ingrained since school - it's no wonder he keeps repeating and reinforcing the lessons. Thats how training your mind normally works doesn't it?<br />I too, was hoping for a &quot;how&quot;. But with the way the markets work, and life in general works, opporunities change, and the rich know where to look and how to take advantage of it. The rest shrug it off and continue their debt ridden lifestyles.<br />Robert uses some vague examples of his experiences, and doesn't venture too far into them. Why? Because his situtations, the times, the location are all different now. How could he possibly give examples that might be specific to a certain place during a certain time period? Everything would have changed by the time the book was printed and would have been worthless to everyone else.<br />Take the book for what it's objective clearly is - to encourage you to learn more, become financially literate, and to focus on limiting liabilities and instead search for ways to create assets. <br />He hit is right on the money, and his words will always be in the back of my head everyday as I head off to work - another day at the rat race, looking for a way out.
0748662529|4.0|A glimpse into modern Botswanian life seen through the eyes of a woman.  Humorous in places yet philosophical without being dogmatic. Told by a woman who has a good sense of self and wisdom.   No major murder story as most mysteries are nowadays but everyday adventures of a self styled local detective.  A quick read. Good for the beach or vacation chair.
6302424887|5.0|There are already 25 excellent and accurate reviews.  I agree with them all, but no one mentions the astounding fight scenes choreographed by the Royal Fight Master (whose name I don't recall).  If you want to see the best swordplay of ANY movie, get this movie for that BUT the unfortunate cropping to reduce to TV aspect ration cuts out most of the best parts!
B000059XXZ|5.0|So many reviews are on the spot about this movie - brilliantly filmed and acted, and the sets, wow!, what I can say but that they are perfect? This is Batman the way Batman should be - dark, brooding, moody, obsessed, driven.  It's also Gotham the way it should be - dirty, all architecture excessively huge and imposingly impersonal and filled with the hubris of a city gone mad, busy, and of course filled with crime and danger.  It is unfortunate that Keaton left the series to Val Kilmer - who is an absolutely rotten Batman - and George Clooney, who could be a good Batman if given a script that isn't garbage.<br />If you want to know who Batman is, and what he is like, this is the movie.  Keaton has perfect reserve and intensity in this role.  While we (the Serious Fans) were up in arms over the casting of Keaton as Batman, assuming he would bite, I was not just surprised when I saw the movie, but am convinced at the genius of Burton for seeing the rightness of his decision, and sticking with it even against the very concerted attacks from the fans to remove Keaton.<br />This is, thank God, not the stupid vacuous Batman of the TV series.  I have no idea why the makers of the following films - especially Clooney's - decided to make Batman into a cartoonish caricature of who he really is.  The brilliance of this film is even more evident when compared with the lack of honor that the later films have.<br />Jack Nicholson of course is a wonderful Joker.  One can see that Jack was absolutely enjoying his acting time, and really put himself into it.  Jack Palance as the whispering evil guy is also a perfect addition to the mood of the film.  Although Nicholson really takes the screen in any scene he is in, Keaton is the real standout in this movie - perfectly quirky as Bruce Wayne, the man who is rather shy and nervous around people, but perfectly determined and confident when being Batman.<br />This is the best superhero movie that has been made (in my opinion) in terms of being true to the hero, and in terms of artistic merit in cinematography, writing, set design, costume design, and acting.  Don't think of it as a superhero movie - this is first and foremost an artistic movie, and it just happens to be about a superhero.<br />(this is a review of the VHS version, not the DVD version)of being true to the hero, and in terms of artistic merit in cinematography, writing, set design, costume design, and acting.

B00003CXE7|5.0|&quot;Gladiator&quot;, with Russell Crowe in the lead role, and Ridley Scott at the helm, is a modern mega-budget epic that could rank as a contemporary answer to such Hollywood blockbusters as &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; and &quot;Ben Hur&quot;. The violence is orchestrated with much aplomb, and the plot abounds in elements of betrayal, lust, intrigue and danger. The toga'd characters, the gladiatorial combats and the devouring tigers in the arenas all create a sumptuous and magnificent feast for the imagination, an image of the splendour of Roman times. The dialogue is formal but contemporary, elevated without being forced, thus helping to underscore the &quot;Shakespearian&quot; effect.
B000002572|5.0|This album is old - old old old - and yet this baby still rocks, and is still just as relevant today as when it came out.  It is classic rock in a real sense - since it isn't filled with musical cliches, it doesn't sound dated (musicologically, anyway).  This is great song-writing - no poppish hooks, no computer generated drumming, nothing like the stupidity of pop music in it.  Just a bunch of guys getting together to jam, but to jam quite artistically.  I would not call the music art-rock (like Yes, early Genesis, King Crimson, etc.), but it does get kinda close.  And of course, lots of heavy guitar that will have you air guitaring again like you were a teenager. One just can't listen to this music and *not* want to air guitar. If you're driving on the highway, you need this.<br />This album deserves to be in every rock aficionado's collection.  A big, bold five stars absolutely.
B00003CWL6|5.0|&quot;American Beauty&quot; is a lyrical, though tragic, story of lost illusions and lost hopes, told with much satiric insight. It depicts upper-middle-class suburbia as a paradise lost. The almost Freudian perespective of the film delineates the welter of sexual and emotional drives, as well as the projections and repressions responsible for shaping and influencing supposedly &quot;normal&quot; behaviour. The chief characters (the disaffected husband) brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey, his faithless wife (Annette Benning) and their troubled daughter (Thora Birch) are depicted as affluent reapers of the benefits of the American Dream, though their lives are hollow, artificial and pathetic by contrast. This film is a damning overview of America today. The haunting music score, cinematography, scripting, acting and direction are of the highest standard. The film combines domestic tragedy with mystery, character study and some stylised and epiphanic symbolism as in the image of the piece of paper floating in the wind without cease, circling endlessly, circling in a void, roaming as if in desperation, floating with no place to go.
B00004XQ83|5.0|From beginning to end, the O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack plays right along with the movie, and each and every second sounds fantastic. Not only would this make a great item to purchase for someone who enjoys soundtrack listening, but also would make a great purchase for fans of the blues and country sounds of the 30s. Featured on the CD are 19 tracks that are the listening essence of Southern USA in the 30s. An absolute must buy!
6303965415|5.0|Persuasion has never been my favorite Austen novel. It's very short, rather sketchy, and involves a heroine, Anne, with whom I have very little in common. When I first saw this adaptation of the film, I'd just hopped across the lobby of my local theatreplex from a happy screening of the 1995 Sense and sensibility adaptation. The opening scenes of this film apalled me. The projectionist was probably to blame for much of this, but even if it were projected flawlessly, i don't think i could have forgiven the director for not being Ang Lee. ;o) The opening is dark...overcast...the camera angles are shaky. Amanda Root's Anne is small, mousy, and meek - the complete antithesis of my beautiful, spirited Marianne Dashwood and my energetic, naive Emma Woodhouse. Since that first viewing, my opinion of the adaptation has completely changed. This story is remarkably satisfying if you give it a chance...much like Anne, who is a little too easy to dismiss when you're enraptured by Marianne. It has a quiet strength and an understated elegance you'll come to love, as the scenes and those in them become brighter, steadier, and more wonderful to watch as the film progresses.
052594527X|4.0|On one level \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" is an underwritten novel set in a seventeenth century Dutch town where Griet, a teen-age maid, becomes star-struck when she is noticed by the famous painter, Vermeer. Tracy Chevalier builds her story slowly with interesting little details of life in Holland in the sixteen hundreds and before we quite realize it we are swept away. <br />So what is this book all about anyway? There is only one small sex scene, no great world-changing events, and little action as we have come to think of it in current fiction. Then why are readers buying it in droves, lining up on library waiting lists, and staying awake until the wee hours when they have it in hand? Because, perhaps, it speaks, on almost every page, to a longing which all of us feel but cannot quite articulate.<br />Let's call it a search for a kind of perfection and the impossibility of its achievement. In this sense, Tracy Chevalier's story is about lost possibilities. Who can resist them whether in the literature of love or war or art? I once knew, in college, a pert and lovely young woman who set out on a quest for the perfect happiness. She never achieved it and her uncompromising search deprived her of a certain measure of happiness. Now I feel compelled to try and capture her yearning by writing her story. In a way, that is also what this book is about, the seductive power of longing. <br />Vermeer achieves perfection, or something very near it, in his work. But it is at the high price of alienation from family and financial depravity. Griet, too, comes close in a different way, but is given only a fleeting glance of the perfection she desires. And Vermeer, motivated to perfect his work out of longing for Griet, or the idea of her, is likewise deprived. <br />So why, to paraphrase F. Scott Fitzgerald, do we beat on against the tide, seeking a kind of perfection we can never achieve? Because, perhaps, we hope for a miracle. Like the one which transformed Tracy Chavalier'sbanal little story into a few golden moments.
B000001Y42|4.0|This album is the perfect amalgamation of what i thing the new rap-rock sub-genre would/should/could sound like.  It is all too unfortunite that the LB changed their sound to be more pop-oriented.  Incredible riffage and mad-crazy percussion along with fast, yet smooth lyrics make this a great addition to any rap fan or any hard rocker's collection.
B00004XPP0|5.0|I, like every body else who has reviewed Star Wars believe that these movies are absolutely amazing and definitely THE greatest movies ever made! The trilogy blew me away and I find it hard for a week to pass and I haven't watched at least one of my Star Wars tapes. But wait a minute! VHS quality just isn't good enough! George we love you man, but you have to stop being greedy, give us raving Star Wars fans what we want and do it A.S.A.P.!....
B00001OH7X|4.0|This is usually considered the worst of the Berlin period Bowie/Eno albums, not least by the participants themselves, but it actually contains some the best SONGS of the three albums. How can any album which contains &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;, &quot;Yassassin&quot;, &quot;Red Sails&quot;, &quot;DJ&quot;, &quot;Look Back In Anger&quot;, &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; and &quot;Red Money&quot; be considered disappointing? Admittedly, &quot;African Night Flight&quot; suffers from a distinct lack of anything resembling a tune while &quot;Move On&quot; and &quot;Repetition&quot; are second string Bowie (tho the latter has very interesting and brave lyrics on domestic violence. Elsewhere, Bowie's magpie tendencies are on display, &quot;Red Sails&quot; is a pretty blatant steal of the Neu/Harmonia motorik style (in particular Harmonia's &quot;Monza&quot;) but redeemed by Bowie's inventive melody and singing. Likewise, &quot;Look Back In Anger&quot; suggests Bowie had been listening as closely to the Walker Brothers' &quot;Nite Flights&quot; album as Scott Walker had been listening to &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot;! Overall, the album has a surprisingly lean and sparse feel with Bowie's best ever rhythm section (Carlos Alomar/ Dennis Davis/ George Murray) as reliable as ever, Adrian Belew fills in as &quot;stunt guitarist&quot; in the absence of Robert Fripp, and almost out-Fripps the master on &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot;! Bowie and Eno contribute here and there too, in fact, there's more of Eno in a songwriting sense on this album than on either &quot;Low&quot; or &quot;Heroes&quot;, odd as it's usually considered the least Enoesque of the trilogy. The bonus track, (the oddly titled) &quot;I Pray Ole&quot; is good if not essential, sounds to me as if it re-uses chords from another song (a typically Enoesque ploy) but the 1988 version of &quot;Look Back In Anger&quot; merely demonstrates how much less interesting Bowie was in 1988 compared with 1979....
B00004WGAF|5.0|&quot;House of Cards&quot; is terrific. I won't spoil it for you, but just know that it's a totally refreshing twist on the usual British drama/dark-comedy. Ian Richardson is superb. He captures the essence of the main character and plays it to perfection. I had a new appreciation for his acting abilities after seeing him in this role. I can't give you too many specifics, but if you like the quality of most high-quality British fare, you won't be disappointed. And if you like this one, there are two other installments available. That should give you some idea of whether or not it was considered a success. Sit back and enjoy!
B00000DC10|5.0|... every song is awesome. when i heard new noise i felt suddenly in love to this song. thats deffinitive the best hardcore-cd i ever heard.<br />I can only recommend you to buy this great album
B000002LPD|4.0|This is a good album.The best tracks are judgement day and top of the world.Sammy's vocals really shrine through on this album.He's got the best male voice in rock, I just love his american vocals.He really puts feeling into the song.His yell on the ending of judgement day was great.That song and top of the world really rock and give you a high energy feeling.
B000002N25|5.0|Well, this CD is sooooooo good, I haven't stopped playing it since I got it. Mark just gets better and better. There is a touch of everything in this CD, a love song, a little rock, a bit of Irish, a bit of country (and I don't even like country, but sung by Mark it is so very good). The haunting track of &quot;A Night in  Summer Long Ago&quot; is my favorite, it totally melts me. I missed Dire Stratis, but Mark just has a voice to get to your very soul. If you are in a mellow mood this is the album for you. There is nothing not to like. Mark is better than ever before. Love this man!
B00004Z459|5.0|When I first heard One Step Closer, I was hooked, so I bought Hybrid Theory last summer. The CD has grown on me and has become my absolute favorite. Even after a year, I'm still rocking to this CD and it hasn't gotten old. If you are a fan to hypnotic rhythms and stunning vocals, I recommend this CD.
0380788624|3.0|This book is worth anyone's time, however, if I would do it again, I would not spend the time to read it.  I will give it 3 our of 5 stars.  Extremely interesting and educational, but too lengthy and boring at times.  Stephenson did not put enough effort into keeping me interesting throughout the book.  Cryptonomicon does not even come close to Snow Crash, which I read in less than a day.  Again, if you have the time, read it.
B0000028VT|5.0|Music has never ever been more blessed than the day Mariah released her first ever single to an unexpecting world of listeners. Music has never been the same. With over 150 million albums sold worldwide, Mariah is undoubtedly the &quot;QUEEN OF POP&quot;.With 16 # 1 hits and platinum and gold records from every part of the world, she is a force to reckon with in the music industry.<br />Her album entitled &quot;Music Box&quot; is a collector's item. It is the ultimate favorite of fans world over. With tracks such as the uplifting &quot;Dreamlover&quot; to the powerful ballads of &quot;Without You&quot; and the inspiring &quot;Hero&quot;, Mariah has touched the hearts of millions of fans. Also look out for a couple of fast paced tracks in &quot;Now That I Know&quot;, &quot;I've Thinking About You&quot; and a few slow numbers in &quot;Never Forget You&quot;, &quot;Just to Hold You Once Again&quot;. This album is a pop music lover's delight and is an absolute must have for anyone's collection.
B00005B4GU|5.0|As someone who hands out five star ratings too often (then again I usually only rate things I'm really excited about) I think giving this album five stars loses its weight.  But after having the album before release, hearing them on tour playing many of the songs live, and listening to it constantly afterwards, I feel that the band is only getting better.  Hearing them live and getting more and more familiar with the work has revealed the intricasies of the music more than I imagined.  What astounds me the most is that Radiohead find ways to stylistically represent what they are playing/singing about.  In &quot;Pulk/Pull&quot; Thom speaks of doors that you can't come back from and when he says &quot;trap doors&quot; it sounds like the floor gives way and you're falling into something, I don't know, something dark that you can't come back from.  &quot;You and Whose Army&quot; is sung with an ironic soft and vulnerable voice.  &quot;Swinging Plates&quot; (an intensely amazing track) sounds like things are spinning, forwards and backwards.  &quot;I Might be Wrong&quot; stops abruptly towards the end, as though Thom Yorke is really wondering if he's wrong, then picks up, and sort of says either &quot;no, I'm not wrong,&quot; or &quot;I'm still thinking.&quot;<br />Moreover, I like Amensiac's story/theme.  Like OK Computer, and Kid A, Amnesiac follows a storyline, and the three have similarities and differences.  Thom Yorke has said that &quot;Packt Like Sardines&quot; is about another car crash, which &quot;Airbag&quot; is about, and &quot;Everything in its right place,&quot; like the other first tracks is about being disoriented.  Track 2.  Where Radiohead likes to place their thesis, I believe.  Pablo Honey (Creep) The Bends (The Bends) OK Computer (Paranoid Android), Kid A (Kid A), and Amnesiac (Pyramid Song).  It always sings of the overriding feeling of the album, and/or tries to be the most epic.  Blah, blah, blah.  I could go on forever, but that would be counterproductive, even fewer people would read it then.  I'd like to say though that you should look for Yorke's obsession with death, (Morning (Mourning) Bell, Hunting Bears, You and Whose Army, Motion Picture Soundtrack, How to Disappear Completely, In Limbo, and his incredible use of irony and humor.  His songs about birth or beginnings tend to be in the beginning of the albums.  I'm a huge fan of this band.  And I apparently enjoy overanalyzing things, (which creates, as you can imagine, nothing but bowls of cheerios in my life)but that's because their is so much in this music, and I love to think about how ingenius their composition is.  I'm really glad they're around.
B000002IZ4|5.0|After hearing their first album &quot;Core&quot;, I came into &quot;Purple&quot; with heavy expectations.  I couldn't be more surprised when I started listening.  I often grade albums not on the first listen, but only after a few.  This is one of those albums that still hooks me EVERY SINGLE TIME.  From favorites such as &quot;Interstate Love Song&quot; (even if you didn't know STP, you probably heard this one somewhere), &quot;Vasoline&quot; (more &quot;Core&quot; like than any song on this album), &quot;Pretty Penny&quot; (a departure for STP at the time, but still riveting nonetheless), and &quot;Big Empty&quot; (great rock song, period), this is one of my personal favorite albums ever (being 16 when the album came out, it's a definite time turner for me).  It's a great album and definitely worth the five star rating!
B000056K04|2.0|That characteristic DMB sound which fans have come to love over the past years is basically lost in this album. The first mistake was the introduction of 'computer generated' sounds like basically every band. Is there a piano in the Dave Matthews Band? Then how come there's one in 'The Space Between?' (Which in fact is one of the better songs on this album). 'So Right' is 'so-so.' The intro to 'Everyday'- I can see where it came from, Dave being South African and all, but it really doesnt fit in well...<br />I Did It - Best song on the album. The only reason I considered buying it.<br />When The World Ends - It's a good song, but I really don't like it at all (except for the chorus, which is real good.)<br />The Space Between - Good, but below par with all their other songs on other albums. Dreams of our Fathers - No offense, but it was good until Dave started singing. But then it gets better.<br />So Right - I'm not a fan of this song. One bit. If I had it all - The intro is the 'Anti-DMB.' I've never heard anything like that before. The rest of the song is nothing special. If it were an instrumental, i probably wouldn't even know it was a DMB song.<br />What you are - NO!!! Computer generated sounds!!! Otherwise, not too bad. Nice violin on this one. <br />Angel - Pretty good song. But i swear there's some kind of keyboard in this song. No like.<br />Fool to think - Pretty good.<br />Sleep to dream her - Haven't we already had a song about  dreaming?<br />Mother Father - Haven't we already had a song about fathers?<br />Everyday - I'm not for this song either.<br />Overall, i guess i could learn to love this album. The first star is for 'I did it' and 'the space between.' The second star is for effort.
B000002TQV|5.0|I remember picking this album up in 1995 after hearing &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; (quite a stunner, especially after I associated them with &quot;Creep&quot; at the time) and &quot;Just&quot; (a nice, loud rock song), wondering what to expect.  I wasn't dissapointed in the least.  From passionate songs like &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; and &quot;Street Spirit&quot;, to songs with their own extreme mood swings (&quot;My Iron Lung&quot;), and to straight forward rock tunes (&quot;Bones&quot; is my personal favorite in the Radiohead catalogue), this is an album that's definitely a permanent staple in my (and should be in others) CD collection.  When a lot of the other reviewers for this album say it's one of the best albums of the last decade, be assured they aren't lying.
6300214710|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I fell inlove with all the great charcters. Andrew McCarthy, Molly Ringwald, Annie Potts &amp; &quot;Ducky&quot;. This is a story of a high school where money doesn't mix with anything else but more money. Molly Ringwald plays a teenager whose father hasn't been inspired to excel since her mother left them years ago. They live a simple lifestyle on the wrong side of the tracks. Andrew McCarthy is the boy who has everything, except true classy friends, although they have tons of money. When he falls for Ringwald he has to face those who begin to snob him. But he's not the only one getting heat......Ringwald's best friend, Ducky, happens to be very much in love with her and fights with all he has, which isn't much, to win her for his future bride. Ringwald works in a record store where she'll get the best advice Annie Potts has ever offered up. This movie is funny, sad and inspiriational. If you like romantic comedy, you'll love this one.
B0000026T4|5.0|Not many agree, but to me this is Alice's best.  &quot;Trash&quot; stood above a lot of albums in 1989 (quality wise), spent 36 weeks on Billboard's Top 100, and introduced Alice to a whole new generation.  The concept was best explained by Alice himself on &quot;Prime Cuts.&quot;  Alice had done so many horrific things, that &quot;Trash&quot; was his chance to get laid.  Each song was planned accordingly, and they work.  &quot;Poison&quot; kick starts the disc with ferocity, followed by a slew of heavy hitters including the MTV-banned &quot;Bed of Nails.&quot;  Two ballads soften the intensity of this concept album (of sorts) that centers on the love/hate relationships of men and women.<br />&quot;Trash&quot; doesn't let you forget that it's an Alice Cooper album.  It's dark at times, twisted most times, and while commercial, enjoyable at all times.  By far his best post-70s work.
B00003CXRM|5.0|If you are looking for subtle humor, classic parody, or just want to see George Clooney in a role quite unlike any other he has ever played, this movie is for you.  Losely based on Homer's &quot;Odyssey,&quot; the story line revolves around early 20th century back-woods prison escapees and their adventures while eluding recapture.  I found the film to be very funny visually as well as with the clever writing.  Clooney was terrific in his strange role.  I bought the DVD after having seen the movie in the theater.  Enjoyed it even more watching it at home.
6305078564|5.0|Believe it or not, prior to the accidental happening to see Pride and Prejudice on television, I had never read a Jane Austen novel.  One would wonder in what cave have I dwelt!  But because of my fortunate happenstance, I am now enamored with all of Jane Austen's novels and I have never seen so perfect an adaptation as presented by Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth!  I could almost read from the book itself, since the script was kept so very close to the original!  I have watched it four times at least since receiving it less than a fortnight ago.   My husband was attentive through it all (and he is NOT a reader of 'old novels')!  Yet, he exclaimed that he would be most happy to see it all again - in one sitting!   Please suffer me to overuse exclamation points as I bubble forth with praise from the finest of acting and casting regarding all the characters, from Elizabeth's forthrightness, Lydia's lack of remorse, Lady Catherine de Bourgh's indignation (from the start) and to even Mr. Collins' perpetual loquacity! One scene touched me particularly, the look on Darcy's face as he beheld Miss Bennet and his sister at the pianoforte.  His countenance was filled with such exquisite delight, yet obviously controlled in such a manner that one could feel his shear joy at finally being in the company of the two most beloved people on the planet! I say that I am most 'prejudiced' in casting my ballot for this version as the most beautiful and most satisfying rendition of Austen's classic that I have ever seen.  Actually, I know not any screenplay of any novel so well done as this one notwhithstanding Gone With the Wind. My 'bonnet' is off to Sue Birtwistle, Andrew Davies, Simon Langton, Carl Davis, et al., for their collaboration on a job very well done!
0671027344|5.0|This book was a wonderful read.  I loved it from cover to cover. If you aren't reminded of your teen years, regardless of how painful or painless, I would be very surprised.  Funny and often moving, a must.  Reminiscent of &quot;Catcher in the Rye.&quot;

His countenance was filled with such exquisite delight, yet obviously controlled in such a manner that one could feel his shear joy at finally being in the company of the two most beloved people on the planet! I say that I am most 'prejudiced' in casting my ballot for this version as the most beautiful and most satisfying rendition of Austen's classic that I have ever seen.  Actually, I know not any screenplay of any novel so well done as this one notwhithstanding Gone With the Wind. My 'bonnet' is off to Sue Birtwistle, Andrew Davies, Simon Langton, Carl Davis, et al., for their collaboration on a job very well done!
0316286850|5.0|This book is so wonderful, even for people who are NOT into makeup at all!  Even my boyfriend thinks it makes a great coffee table book for everyone to look at.  As a makeup artist, this book is like no other.  It balances the art of photography, makeup, fantasy and reality.  The one thing that I really love about this book the most is that it INSPIRES ME!!!!  As a current makeup artist, I agree that there are NO BOUNDARIES when it comes to makeup!  It is fun, intruiguing, transforming, and the best part is that it is temporary - you can play with a different look the next day.  Kevyn Aucoin is an amazing artist - and this book is a great way to not only learn about makeup, but it allows you to see every possibility available.
B00005B36H|5.0|If Bach or Beethoven were alive today they would probably be a member of Tool.  The rich, multi-layered texture of classical music has evolved into hard rock.  Tool first did this with &quot;Aenima&quot; and they have expanded it with &quot;Lateralus.&quot;  Tool is an experience in hard rock symphony.<br />Songs like &quot;Schism&quot; and &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot; grab you right away.  After listening to those songs you can move on to longer, fuller songs, like &quot;Parabol/Parabola&quot; and &quot;Lateralus.&quot;  These songs have what most music today is missing, ups and downs.  Much like classical music which uses quiet music with crescendos buliding up to great blasts of music, these songs slowly grab you and take you on a ride.  There are also short interludes like &quot;Mantra&quot; that contain soft durable rythms that act like buffers between these flowing passages.<br />The talent is obvious in this album.  Tool fans have waited long for a new album and it turns out the wait was worth it.  These are great musicians with a full understanding of what music can be.  From short catchy riffs to extended trips of hypnotic rythms &quot;Lateralus&quot; is an experience that lingers on the mind.
0345350499|5.0|i've just finished reading bradley's epic for the second time, and i've been reminded why this is my favorite book. <br />The Mists of Avalon is the story of arthurian camelot, told from the perspective of the women involved.  usually put on the back burner to the men, bradley makes commonly misunderstood figures such as morgan le fay seem real, with real conflicts and issues, and not the devil worshipping witch of classic arthurian tales.  The women of bradley's camelot are powerful, and strong willed, role models for other generations.   the beauty with which bradley writes, and the depth with which she explores her characters make this my favorite book of all time.
0884271536|4.0|As he did in The Goal with production operations, Goldratt approaches project management in Critical Chain from a novel, even radical, perspective and makes some impressive insights. Through his main character, a business professor, Goldratt maintains that something is fundamentally wrong with current methodologies, and proposes a simpler, crisper alternative.<br />Typical of Goldratt's style, the essence of Critical Chain could be condensed into less than 20 pages. The remainder of the book consists of a superfluous, poorly developed novel, including details of the professor's troubled marriage and the attempts of a university president to turn around a faltering business school. Goldratt is harshly critial of current business school cirriculums and characterizes an MBA as essentially useless.<br />Goldratt's unconventional grammar, especially with regard to punctuation, and his insistence in switching between first and third person narration is distracting, but manageable.<br />Overall, however, Critical Chain is an achievement and should be mandatory reading for anyone involved in project management.<br />tpm May 28, 2001
B00000IMYA|5.0|Well, this is Ellington's biggest seller, and there's a reason for it.  It's legendary.  It's even given jazz fans a sort of catchphrase - &quot;27 Choruses.&quot;  The CD is brilliant from so many standpoints - musical, entertainment, technical, etc.  I'm sure that most of you know the story behind the performance itself.  Not all of Duke's men show up for the first set, Duke comes back at midnight, blows the crowd away with &quot;Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue,&quot; and starts a riot - at a 1956 jazz festival!<br />That one song makes this a must own, but the CD is great from start to finish.  Perhaps it's the story behind the performance, but everything the band does just has a certain aura to it.  You get features from Harry Carney, Johnny Hodges, and Paul Gonsalves, three of the greatest big band saxophonists (Johnny Hodges' misplayed notes on &quot;I Got it Bad&quot; are hilarious).  I also really liked Willie Cook's &quot;Tea for Two&quot; and Sam Woodyard's &quot;Skin Deep.&quot;  And Ray Nance's vocal on &quot;Tulip or Turnip&quot; is outstanding.  And of course, &quot;Diminuendo&quot; - Gonsalves is phenomenal and Cat Anderson's display of his ear-splitting range never fails to give me goosebumps.  I mentioned a few songs, but every one is good - this is one of those rare albums where you never have to hit &quot;next track.&quot;<br />I only have a few problems with this CD.  The extra, studio versions of some of the songs are unnecessary.  Some might find the song introductions obnoxious, but I enjoyed them.  Jimmy Grissom's vocal on &quot;Day In, Day Out&quot; sounds quite dated (but I started to dig it after a couple of listens).  The other problem is that after this CD, any other Ellington just isn't the same.  But in no uncertain terms, I say BUY THIS ALBUM.
B000002KKK|5.0|ZZ Top is at their bluesy best with this fantastic DeGuello CD.  Although most of the music here is simple in approach, the tone from song to song does have some nice variations.  Probably the best track is the stunning slow blues A Fool For Your Stockings.  The guitar solos have such crisp embellishments that its a joy to the ears.  I'm Bad I'm Nationwide is a nice chugging tune with some sharp heavy solos.  Some people may not like Manic Mechanic but I like the vocal effect that is used here.  The use of saxaphones and keyboards on some of the other tracks just enriches the overall sound.  My recommendation to anyone interested in ZZ Top is to start with this record.  Its fanatstic!
0316776963|5.0|Just as entertaining as Naked - keeps you interested and laughing the entire book.  It was a great book to pass around with our teen agers on a road trip.  We all took turns reading.  The time flew by.  Some material risky for kids under 15 or 16, but anyone else will find his stories compelling and hilarious.
0671027573|4.0|I have read Linda Howard for a few years as she develops her &quot;romantic intrigue&quot; series, and find this entry to be her strongest to date.  Some of her earlier efforts (Dream Man, Now You See Her) were formulaic at best, displaying an awkward transition from intelligent romance writer to serious mystery writer.<br />Mr. Perfect is a huge step in the right direction.  LH presents a heroine, Jaine Bright, who is a smart successful career woman with three busted engagements under her garter.  Her neighbor Sam is a cop - despite Jaine's initial misgivings that he's a drunk - who helps Jaine when a deranged killer decides that Jaine is taking up too much space on this planet.<br />The plot of this story is definitely the most involved and mature of Ms. Howard's mystery/romance career, and I say bravo.  The personal development, though, is certainly a reminder of her romance writer roots.  Sam decides that Jaine is his soulmate/wife-to-be after one week of, well, &quot;dating&quot; to be generous.  And although LH is certainly trying to give her heroine modern sensibilities, and succeeding much more than earlier efforts,  the whiff of &quot;small, virginal heroine needs big alpha male to resuce her&quot; still abounds.  Not that this is a bad thing, or even untrue, just that it is much more obvious in an LH book than in other &quot;pure&quot; mystery writers.<br />Ms. Howard seems to be emulating Janet Evanovich, again not a bad thing, and is succeeding more and more.  This book has some good humorous moments, and some of the one-liners that Jaine comes up with are memorable. <br />Bottom line:  I'm glad I bought this book, but also glad that I waited for the paperback version.
0446677450|5.0|Thanks Robert Kiyosaki for &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot; - This is a great book. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I found the ideas made a very positive impact on me. He presents ideas about how to think in a different way which will help you become rich. People who already are rich may think his ideas are too simple or they have already heard it before. But while that may be true, I learned alot in reading this book.<br />This book has created more clarity for me around money and how to increase my financial well-being. It has also helped me to see some errors that I have been making in my thinking and in the way I have been investing. This book has helped to create more choices for me. This book is packed with simple ideas that are gems of wisdom...I highly recommend this book to people who are looking for a new way of thinking about money and wealth!<br />Another book I very highly recommend is &quot;Working On Yourself Doesn't Work&quot; by Ariel &amp; Shya Kane. They present ideas and principles about how to be happy and have well-being and effectiveness. Their styles seem similar to me - simple straightforward and full of wisdom. Anyway, these are two of my favorite books. They are both classics on how to enrich your life!
B000002U82|5.0|This album creates a music mood unlike anything of it's kind.  It ecompasses elements from classical music and intertwines them with guitar solos and drum beats.  Listening to this album will make you lost in your own world.  It will put you in a good mood and occaisonally slap you in the face with some exciting sound. Listening to Dark Side of the Moon is a total body experience that leaves you breathless and wondering how a group of people could put together something so incredible.
B000000ISA|5.0|Freddy Mercury was a man before his time, and Queen was a band before their time. This CD varies from the typical (If there is a typical) Queen but it's still the boys doing what they did best. Freddy opened a lot of doors and I hope I'll get to meet him someday and shake his hand. Maybe get a little hug.<br />Rock on Freddy! Where ever you may be I know you're entertaining them.<br />Thanks for reading this review, I hope it helps. Rochelle Mendez
B00004XOWM|2.0|Durst's whine kinda ruins the album.  It isnt horrible, but it sure aint the best!!
B000005HCQ|4.0|This is an amazing album with many highlights. Throughout half of the album, Blakey plays just like he looks on the cover. This characteristic of Blakey's style is especially captured on the title track, a Wayne Shorter tune that truely lives up to it's name. &quot;Free For All&quot; is one of the best tunes Shorter has ever written and he plays one of the best solos in his career while Art is throwing polyrhythms and soulful grunts underneath. Trumpeter Freddie Hubbard is also in top form for this date. The album showcases his elaborately technical style which he is so well-known for. Mr. Hubbard is also the composer of &quot;The Core&quot;, an absolutely slammin' track thanks to Blakey's shuffle pattern. This tune also features a technically dazzling, yet bluesy solo from trombonist Curtis Fuller, showing the &quot;buttonpushers&quot; that a trombone can be versatile too. If your body isn't moving along with this one, there's absolutely no hope for you! However, I am sad to say that there are a couple of sour aspects to this album, the biggest of which is sloppy engineering (or remastering?). On a couple of the tracks, the horn backgrounds (which should be BEHIND the soloist) are way too heavy in the mix and  tend to drown out the soloist making the listener cringe a bit. The soloists are also panned hard, meaning that you will only hear them in one speaker. This may particularly drive you nuts if you're listening through headphones where this defect is most obvious. The last negative comment that I also must make (and I really hate to do this) is that though Curtis Fuller is a great player, his solo on the title track is flat-out AWEFUL!! There, I said it! I mean you actually feel bad for the poor guy while he's annoyingly hanging on one note without a single good idea to play. You keep waiting for him to get off it and start ripping it up, but he just keeps sounding like it's his first solo ever. The only part where he seems comfortable is on the bridge. However, sizzling solos (other than the one just mentioned), great writing and phenomenal drumming are well worth enduring these minor side effects.

0399134204|5.0|This is the third of Amy Tan's four novels that I have read and reviewed here at amazon.com, all in a few weeks time. As a result of these reviews, amazon.com's &quot;New for you&quot; list divides my suggested reading material into two categories; books written by women and books written by me, which I think is pretty funny.<br />You don't need me to tell you what this book is about or that Amy Tan is an author of great magnitude. Let me tell you instead that I have been reading her books in reverse, beginning with &quot;The Bonesetter's Daughter&quot;, working through &quot;The Hundred Secret Senses&quot;, and finishing with &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot;. I've rated all three with five stars.<br />I'm glad I read these books in reverse as so much of the thinking that come to the surface in her later works can be found in &quot;Joy Luck&quot;, but might have gone unnoticed had I begun with this book. The roots of her interest in writing children's books are easy to find here, but Ms.Tan's later writings about reincarnation also surface here. She has been criticized for expressing these beliefs in her later works as if this idea was something new to her, but it is not. On page 213, for example, a grandmother teases her baby granddaughter for laughing and she says &quot;O! O! You say you are laughing because you have already lived forever, over and over again?&quot; Reincarnation. But also, on page 83, as the adult Ying Ying St. Claire contemplates how she had lost her way in life; she recalls what she had asked The Moon Lady for as a child. &quot;I wished to be found&quot;, she says. As a child she had been lost and &quot;wished to be found&quot; in a literal sense. But as an adult, whom did she wish would find her? What, exactly, was that wish? Who is she waiting for? How long has she been waiting? And then again, back to the literal, in speaking of her mother's twin daughters, she says that &quot;All these years, while they waited to be found,...&quot; This authoris waiting, but for what? For who? Till when? Will she know when she's been found?<br />On a lighter note, what is this reoccurring story about the marriage her female characters are involved in with a husband with whom they split all the bills? Is this some common thing that no one told me about? NOW you tell me? My wife should be going to work and earning the money to pay for half of my ice cream? NOW I find this out? Please tell me this is not common behavior. <br />How about the salt issue? What is with this &quot;too much salt&quot;, &quot;not enough salt&quot;? We hear about the wrong amount of salt from book to book. I could tell you a story from many years ago about my Italian mother and a pinch of salt, but I won't.<br />Of the three Amy Tan books I've read, this is the first one that gave me the sense that we were reading about Chinese people, specifically. The characters in the other books could have been anybody. China and the Chinese thing was trim. But even in this book the women could easily have been old-world Sicilian women and the mother/daughter relationships could easily have been mother/son. Trust me. I know this as well as anyone. There's more that is Old World here and more that results from generational and general culture clashes than is Chinese vs. all others.<br />I discovered Amy Tan while on a walk through my den. My wife was reading &quot;Bonesetter's Daughter&quot;. The book lay on a table, upside down, with Amy Tan's picture looking up at me. I saw the picture, asked who she was, and in spite of my wife's warning that I wouldn't like the book because this was an author who wrote &quot;for women&quot;, I waited for her to finish the book and immediately picked it up myself. Had you told me that in short order I'd have read three of her books, leaving only one unread to maintain a sense balance in my reading, and that this Chinese-American woman who hails from California and is barely younger than I am would soon vie for position as one of my all-time favorite authors, I'd have told you that you had the wrong guy for sure. <br />Guess what.<br />I've never had anything for or against the author Stephen King. I tried reading one of his books once and it just wasn't something that interested me at all. I don't relate to the way his mind works. I've certainly never had any reason to envy the guy. But when I heard that he was friendly with Amy Tan, I have to tell you that my immediate reaction was to envy his ability to pick up the phone, give her a call, and tell her he would be happy to buy the wine if she'd answer a few of the dangling questions and fill him in on some of the secrets that lead to the kind of thinking that we see in these books.<br />Oh well.
0517548232|5.0|If you're just starting to study economics and want an introduction to the subject that will not bore or scare you away, you can do no better than to begin with Hazlitt's ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON.<br />The book keeps to one general theme which is explained clearly at the outset (in chapter one) and thereafter touches briefly on topics ranging from minimum wage requirements to rent control laws. Each subject, however horrifying they may sound to a  first-time reader, is dealt with in such a way that it becomes wholly intelligable.<br />Take, for example, Hazlitt's introduction to the field of minimum wage laws:  &quot;We have already seen some of the harmful results of arbitrary governmental efforts to raise the price of  favored commodities.  The same sort of harmful results follow efforts to raise wages through minimum wage laws.  This ought not to be surprising, for a wage is, in fact, a price.&quot;<br />Here Hazlitt begins a topic by reference to one that has already been mastered. He shows not only the indirect relationship to what was earlier learned (both involve an arbitrary use of government power) but also the direct relationship (a wage is a different way of saying a price -- it is the price paid for labor). Later on, he will show that both of these relate back to the lesson learned in chapter one.<br />Because of this manner of treating economics, the book reads like a marvelous integration of economic thought (in fact, that's exactly what it is) and it's accessible to the average reader.<br />More than that, it's exciting. After reading it, I was left eagerly wanting to know more about economics -- not in the manner of a student who learns a subject for the mere fact of learning it, but because I saw the relevance that it had in the politics of today, in the food I ate this morning, the clothes I will wear tomorrow and in the quality of music or literature I can enjoy at some future date.<br />Now, assuming you value your life (along with all that makes it enjoyable) as I do, it is safe to say that you'll love this book.<br />You won't know everything about economics after reading it, but you'll have a solid foundation for learning more in the future. (And you'll want to know more because you'll see its relevance.) If such is the case -- as I am tempted to say will surely be -- I suggest progressing to any of the works of VON MISES or a work by Frederic Bastiat called ECONOMIC SOPHISMS. For grounding your economic thoughts in a sound philosophical base, I also recommend reading Rand's CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL.makes it enjoyable) as I do, it is safe to say that you'll love this book. <br />You won't know everything about economics after reading it, but you'll have a solid foundation for learning more in the future.

0767802659|3.0|This movie just spells World War II. This clearly is a movie based on the idea that the American patriotism is a pretty scary thing, which resembles the Nationalism in Germany during the 1930s en 40s. I think it is an attack at the Hollywood moviemachine especially which makes youngsters believe that the greatest thing you can do is die for your country waving your flag.

B00003CXRM|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this movie since I had not heard much about it - especially after the opening credits stated it was based on Homer's Odyssey.  What a treat!  Not only was the music splendid, but the film was richly plotted and visually stimulating.  We laughed out loud and actually cheered and applauded at certain points during the movie.  And, yes, the Cyclops, men turned to animals, and the Sirens (my husband's favorite part) were all along for this strange and wonderful odyssey.  A must see!

0679879269|2.0|Good Lord!  What happened!  I wanted a nice ending to a triology that included \\"The Golden Compass.\\"  Instead, I got a traffic jam of a story line that included over ten (10+) different perspectives.  For some reason, we just keep jumping from place to place.  The bad part is that nobody cares about 80% of these places.  But, I'm only beginning.  The absolute worst part, period, involves Mary Malone.  We left her at the end of \\"The Subtle Knife,\\" but did she find some crazy things.  She discovers a species of (probably purple or blue) elephants with wheels.  They even build houses. <br />   Mr. Pullman has five problems with this book.     1. \\"Wierd unecessary junk\\"   2. Too many loose ends to tie up   3. Despite number two, he brings in more characters who help drag out the story even farther.       4. The only way to \\"clean up\\" 1-3 is to kill off most of the characters.  (fewer characters means fewer perspectives)   5. A pathetic, miserable ending that is designed to be tragic, but fails to do so...  (6. A drug or alcohol addition?)
B00005ASHM|5.0|I can't really say that I'm a huge Beach Boys fan. I don't particularly care for surf music or a lot of the Beach Boys' music for that matter. Lately I've been on a music kick on checking out albums that was on VH1's 100 Greatest Rock and Roll Albums list. First the Beatles, then Madonna, now the Beach Boys.<br />I was stunned by the beauty of what I heard on &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. The Beach Boys goes beyond their traditional surf sound by exploring the sounds of pop and rock. &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is the band's &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as noted in the liner notes, maybe not in those exact words but that is what Brian Wilson was aiming for and he got the results what he wanted. The songs are simply amazing. Next to The Beatles' &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot;, I haven't heard music as pure as &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. All the songs took my breath away, especially &quot;God Only Knows&quot; and &quot;Sloop John B&quot;. &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; also makes for a wonder summertime album to listen to, so carefree and easy going to listen to. A real rock and roll masterpiece.
B000056K04|3.0|I bought this album mainly for the SPace between and the lyrics to the other songs. Dave still has some great lyrics on this album, but what is missing is the haunting music. I don't listen to this album with feeling. This album in no way compared to UTTAD and Crash. THis one sounds to manufactured. If you like great lyrics then its great, but The band always had great music as well, and i felt that the other memebers do not live musically as they have done on previous albums. If you need to listen to great music try Under The Table And Dreaming first... This album serves to dissapoint.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Well, I'd actually give this one more like 4.3-4.5 stars, but just 4 seemed too low.  I might scare and dishearten many listeners with this comment, but Amnesiac might represent the destination of Radiohead's musical odyssey.  It combines their killer guitar work and their increasing interest in computerized sounds.  And by and large, it is a beautiful synthesis.  Ok Computer was the first big change, and then Kid A was almost bereft of guitars, and Amnesiac is Radiohead being both weird and beautiful, showing off a complete mastery of both realms of sound.<br />Still...Amnesiac has its dry patches.  I skip past the Morning Bell/Amnesiac track every time.  Why put on a reprise song that sounds so similar and inferior to the original?  It would sound ok if it had been the original track, but the Kid A version is better, so this one just seems stale.  Also, Hunting Bears is just glorified filler.  It could have been a good song if they built a song structure around those guitar riffs, but as it is, it is just boring and unneccessary.  <br />The rest, though, is spellbinding.  The opening track sets the mood, with Yorke diving right into his tenor croon and the rest of the song pulsating...The Pyramid Song is one of Radiohead's finest moments ever, with a beautiful and off-kilter time signature, and an even more beautiful piano melody.  Just magical.  The next song, which has been slammed by others, pulsates with an infectious and overwhelming bass/drum rhythm, while a shimmering and somewhat distant sound captivates you.  I think it's stunning.  You and Whose Army falls just short of being one of my favorite songs only because it ends abruptly without taking the last step towards greatness, a good ending.  Track 5 (name is failing me) is a great song driven by a great, driving guitar line.  Knives Out is a fine addition to any of Radiohead's albums.  #8 is also brilliant...I'll stop because I'm sure anyone who's up at 2am reading these like me is bored with this by now.  <br />This has some of Radiohead's most transcendent moments, and a few of its least inspired.  But without question, the brilliance FAR outweighs the rest.
B00005AAFS|5.0|This is probably Rammstein's best CD. This CD has 11 songs. All which are great. But there is one thing that you should keep in mind before ordering this. At Best Buy.(Nation Wide) They sell this CD if I remember right for 14.99. And. It had 2 discs. Im not sure If this one does. But on the second disc of the one best buy sells it has their music video &quot;Sonne&quot; Which is in great quailty. And another song halleujah. So I would say get this CD, But by it at best buy.
079213690X|5.0|This film was so powerful and had moved me so much after watch it 4 times on TV, I went to buy the vedio. It was story about Sir William Wallace, and how the scottish people bravly won their freedom, great movie. You simply must watch it, especailly if you are a Mel Gibson fan.
B00005B534|5.0|I must admit - I was a bit skeptical upon my first listen to &quot;Sanctus Ignis&quot;, primarily due to the potential for major Symphony X plagarism. However, upon subsequent listens, this recording has grown on me in many ways. Adagio's writing technique is unique and powerful, not to mention each musician's virtuosity on his instrument. Foremost, Stephen Forte is simply a guitar prodigy, and his keyboard programming really shines as well. Richard Andersson (Majestic) has a clean, precise tone to his speedy runs and arpeggios. Dirk Bruinenberg (Elegy) is a powerful, fast and tasteful drummer, who compliments each arrangement while still adding force. David Readman (Pink Cream 69) is a wonderful singer, reminding me of Stephen Fredrick of Kenziner or even D.C. Cooper. And last but not least, Franck Hermanny on bass is just the low end that Adagio neeeded to complete a successful neoclassical progmetal epic such as this. All in all, &quot;Sanctus Ignis&quot; is a wondefull addition to any progmetal fan's collection, uniting strong classical elements with powerful and complex arrangements, all while keeping a strong sense of style and talent. The most memorable part for me would be on track 3, &quot;In Nomine...&quot; when the thunderous double bass groove kicks in right after a melodic classical interlude...genius!
B00000I41G|5.0|Kenny Burrell is magic. This CD will take you to another dimension with an intoxicating blend of blues based guitar rhythms, rapid conga and bass beats, and well balanced sax interludes. Forget about your troubles and add Midnight Blue to your collection. You'll look at life from a higher level. Enjoy!!
6305810109|4.0|The year &quot;The Straight Story&quot; came out, Kevin Spacey was chosen over Richard Farnsworth for the &quot;best actor&quot; Oscar. In my opinion, though, Richard Farnsworth's performance was much better in many ways. His character depth is sensitive and heartwarming. There are many moments of this movie in which Farnsworth's character, Alvin Straight, nearly moves me to tears. It is the touching story of a man brimming with experience, wisdom, love, and driving determination. It is inspiring and positive. It's a bit slow-paced, on the down-side. That's the only problem I have with it, though. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Buy it.
B00003CXCD|5.0|You can't go wrong with these leading stars-Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn.  They are both as gorgeous as ever, but even more importantly, as talented as ever.  Joe Bradley, is charming as a newspaper reporter, trying to get the scoop on Princess Ann in order to get back in the good graces of his boss.  Princess Ann is a stunning, polite young beauty who feels she is missing out on the fun of being a teenager and desires to live a normal life.  For one brief moment, she gets to experience her dream, with Joe Bradley as her tour guide.  The antics these two share on Princess Ann's Roman Holiday are a barrel of laughs.  The ending is a real tear jerker, but even that can't prevent this from being one of the best movies ever made.
0060934913|5.0|I loved this book!  As a NYC resident and frequent restaurant-goer, I especially appreciated Bourdain's entertaining tales of the New York restaurant scene.  But I'm embarrassed to admit that I can't identify Bigfoot?  Who is he?????
0446677450|5.0|This book has, in many ways, changed my life.  It has put direction in my ambition and provided a simple overriding framework within which to succeed.  Russ Whitney writes a quote in his book that \\" Genius is the ability to simplify those things that we perceive as complicated\\" - If that's true, then Robert Kyosaki invented the word. I have bought this book for many people and recommended it to many more. For some it has changed their lives and for others, reading the first chapter was beyond them - If you're ready for something better - buy this book.
0671027573|5.0|This book is good! I have read all of Linda Howards books and cannot remember any of them ever being this witty. Janie's sense of humor is a crack-up, and Sam is just as funny. They are such a cute couple.. The story itself was good, however I had the murderer figured out about one-third of the way through the book. That's okay, it did not take away from the fantastic way Linda Howard writes. I can't wait to read her new one coming in July called &quot;Open Season.&quot;
B0000039LE|5.0|Ohh man this movie is down right awesome.  An allstar cast of acters such as Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasent.<br />  Story Line 10/10  Micheal Myers at the age of six brutally murdered his oldest sister on halloween night.  Micheal was taken to a mental facilaty where he is watched by the awesome Dr. Samuel Lomis ( Donald Pleasent.  Fifteen years later Micheal escapes into his home town of haddonfeild, IL. On Halloween night he goes out stalks and butchers babysitters searching for Laurie Strode ( Jamie Lee Curtis) to murder.<br />If you are a horror flick fan I suggest buying this movie get a sound system and watch in the dark.  I have watched this movie over and over and it never ceases to amaze me.  Excellent!!!!!!
B00000ADG2|5.0|It's rare to buy a CD and like every song on it. Lauryn Hill's music is a perfect blend of hip-hop, true R&amp;B, funk, and soul. There's not one throwaway song on this CD. My favorite tracks are probably her two most personal songs, &quot;To Zion&quot; and &quot;Every Ghetto, Every City,&quot; which speak of her son and her own childhood, respectively. The cameos from Mary J. Blige and D'Angelo are naturals on this soulful collection. Can't wait until the next album.
6305537313|5.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's is one of my all time favorite movies.  Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly is charismatic, charming and complex.  I can watch this movie over and over again.  While straying from the book, Breakfast at Tiffany's is about two people, Holly Golightly and Paul Varjak, who meet one another when Paul (Fred, baby) moves into Holly's apartment building.  Both of their means of supporting themselves are questionable, but they have a lot in common.  As they grow closer, they end up being a great source of support and fun for each other. In a bizarre comedy, love story, with some twists and turns, this movie is classic Audrey.  She is as beautiful and talented as ever.

B00005LB9O|4.0|The first few times I listened to &quot;The Invisible Band,&quot; I couldn't really tell it apart from the band's hit album &quot;The Man Who.&quot; Musically, it is in the same vein of &quot;The Man Who&quot; and in that sense, Travis haven't really taken a risk but as I listened to the album in whole for about the third time, I paid close attention to the lyrics and realized why I love Travis. Travis, simply do great slow pop orientated tunes with feel--good-from-the-boy-next door lyrics. Even a cynic like me can enjoy these songs. Although I must give Travis more credit than that. The songs on this album see a band maturing facing the questions of life and taking in the experience of life. &quot;Side&quot; is a beautifully written and executed song reminding us to just live our lives even if we may not have everything or think we are wrong. &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot; even shows a less nice Christian boy image they may portray with lyrics like &quot;I'd pray to God if there were heaven...&quot; The album does posses happy songs like &quot;Flowers In The Window&quot; which displays the tweeness of Travis that they are loved for. &quot;Follow The Light&quot; reminds me of a Tom Petty song. &quot;Last Train,&quot; reminds me of Patrick Bateman attempting at song writting(ha ha.) &quot;The Humpty Dumpty Love Song&quot; is however a little too cute for me.<br />While &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; may not be far from &quot;The Man Who&quot; in style. &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; does show us a more mature band trying to establish it's sound. In the case of Travis, Sometimes seconds are a good thing.
B00004SU5J|5.0|I heard this for the first time a few days ago in St. Tropez.  I flipped.  Don't know how I missed it all this time but it's a great groove.  Though I collect primarily jazz, and I recognized this as house, there is plenty of room for Tourist on my rack.
0060934913|1.0|I was so looking forward to this book.  But what Bourdain serves is arrogance and self-aggrandizement.  I was particularly disgusted as he described in raunchy terms what he offered to do to a produce supplier with whom he was displeased.  Are we supposed to be impressed that he can intimidate those he considers beneath him? And sex in the bulk supplies closet?  I would have thought a world class chef would be too busy for shenaniganism at work.  Soul of a Chef is MUCH better.

B00003CXDZ|5.0|I have always loved musicals, and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; is my favorite, so when the first song in &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; was &quot;The Hills Are Alive With the Sound of Music,&quot; I knew I was going to love it. The music spoke to me about love and hope. Just listening to it makes me happy. I was amazed at the singing talents of both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, who until now I had only known as excellent actors. This movie brings to life the Moulin Rouge in all it's overdone magnificence, from the costumes to the brilliant musical numbers. I've seen this movie twice already, and I can't wait to see it again. If you like musicals, or just movies in general, I would recommend that you see &quot;Moulin Rouge.&quot;
6305728437|5.0|I will tell you one thing this is my favorite Disney movie of all time. It has a great storyline of honor, courage, and hope. It is a bout a young chinese girl named Mulan who takes her hurt father's place in the war against the Huns. She does this by going off at night with her fathers enlistment and uniform. Her family can't tell for it would bring shame to their family. This movie has a great Ending! (and middle and beggining) This movie also has great songs! One of my favorites being a song the warriors sing during training &quot;Be A Man&quot;. Also the great comedian Eddie Murphy stars as the voice of an outgoing dragon, Mushu. This movie is for all ages.  My father even thinks its one of Disne3y's best because of the great storyline of courage. I reccomend it to everyone!
B00000064G|4.0|Drake's third album is free of the orchestral texturing of 'Five Leaves Left', and the sacherine tunesmithery of 'Bryter Layter', both fine albums, but neither approaching the stark emotional honesty of the tale from a brocken soul that is 'Pink Moon'. It's beauty lies in it's directness and the way in which the combination of Drake's voice and guitar are able to sounds infinitely sad whilst remaining heart-breakingly poetic. A genuinely lovely record.
052594527X|5.0|Tracy Chevalier creates an opportunity for the reader to step back in time -- to see, smell, hear, and feel the nuances of life in this part of the world 340 years ago.  Its intimacy is the greatest pleasure.  This is the story of one woman's life. Griet, the girl with a pearl earring, has extraordinary viusal intelligence.  Her words exude unconscious, rich sensuality uniquely combined with a clear-sighted practicality.  The story is written as if we were invisible observers privileged to read her unguarded thoughts.  Her innocence is in conrast to her critical visual analysis of the world's beauties and uglinesses.  With words, she paints the same detailed pictures for our imagination's eyes as Vermeer painted for our physical eyes.   She sees more than most.  She says less than most.  The  words she does use are as carefully chosen as Vermeer's surprise contrasts.  Less is more.  She and Vermeer are kindred spirits. Haunting.

B00005LMBK|5.0|Hip-hop's getting boring. Rock's getting boring. Everything's getting boring a la 1989 with Milli Vanilli and C+C Dance Factory being replayed by Nsync and all that other crap out there. THIS ALBUM IS NOT BORING. It's the first new band I've tried that I sat and listened to the entire CD the night I put it in. I saw the video (Clint Eastwood) and being a Flash designer, graphic artist and Clint Eastwood fan, I dug the it! (Although, there is no cartoon Clint in the video). The animation rocks. But, being a musician, I also heard the groovy beat and reverbed harmonica and thought, wow, this is great. I picked up on the Blur connection when I heard the first song - good acoustic guitar. The second half of the album gets a little weak, but it ends strong. Think &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; (Buffalo girl won't you come out tonight) for the tune of track 17 - Left Hand Suzuki Method. I hope this doesn't get overplayed 'cause my friends think I've found the score of the summer. Shh - don't tell anyone! :)
B00003CX5P|5.0|20yrs had past... So its not going to be like the original... at least the first one isnt going to ... when you do prequels especially 20yrs after the originals you have to re-enter duce of the characters and build a story upon that.. The Phantom Menace maybe not be as good as the originals but they werent meant to this was a whole new outlook the 2nd 3rd movies i here the next one will be released next year. Those are the ones that are gonna be awesome cause now they have the characters enter-duced youll be able to follow along better. But if your any true Star Wars fan ull buy anything with the name star wars attached to it. So i definately recommend u getting The Phantom Menace
B000021XS0|5.0|About a year ago, my friend Justin and I were hanging out listening to music. I was going through his CD collection, and I saw the intreging cover to this CD. I asked him what it was. He told me and said it is a &quot;pretty good CD&quot;. He put it on, and as soon as it started, I was mesmerized. By the end of the CD, I was literally in tears. This is one of the most beautiful CDs EVER. I went on to become a huge Dream Theater fan, buying every album, while my friend Justin is a casual fan and only has this album. In the past, I had been a moderate fan of 70's progressive rock . I listened to lots of Yes, ELP, and Rush. As I grew older, I abandoned Prog for improv &quot;Jam-bands&quot; like Phish, DMB, and Rusted Root (which I still love and listen to regularly). Hearing this album sent me into a total relapse. I've started embracing the old Prog as well as discovering new Prog (other than DT, I love Spock's Beard and Fate's Warning's newer stuff). This album started it all, which is why I say it changed my life. It is their best album and has much more of a Liquid Tension Experiment vibe to it (who I also found out about shortly after and fell in love with) which is probably due to Jordan Rudess's keyboard work. Overall, I can't say enough good stuff about this CD, so I'll just stop now. I will say that this CD is one of the most important CDs to me right now and if you listen to it, I know it would be one of yours too.
0385484518|5.0|I must admit that when I first heard about this book I was a little skeptical. &quot;Mitch Albom, he's that sports writer, right. Could he really craft a heartfelt and heartwarming tale?&quot; I had my doubts. Then, I saw a comercial on TV for &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; with, my favorite, Jack Lemmon. I decided I might tune in just to check on ol'Jack. What I saw was one of the best performances ever given by Jack Lemmon. But there was more. <br />About a week or so later, I found my self in a bookstore and bought the book(still affected by Lemmon's performance).<br />Once the book was open this writer was forever changed. For the three of you who haven't read this book(or seen the movie), the story is about a young man(real life sports writer Mitch Albom) who has a very fast-paced life as a sports writer. One night he sees a report on TV about a man dying of ALS(Morrie). Then he realizes that the man was his favorite professor in college. He goes back to visit the dying man. After seeing his old teacher,the writer decides to return(and contiues to do so every Tuesday). During this time, the retired professor teaches his final class to his favorite pupil. <br />He teaches Mitch about life. He teaches the reader about life. The reader watches as ALS eats away at Morrie's body. But not his spirit and heart. <br />This little book will change you forever. Morrie will teach you lessons about life you won't find elsewhere. And Mr. Albom, thank you for being brave enough to leave the sports behind and cross the barrier to serious writing . This really is one of the best books to come out in  awhile. But who am I to tell you about brave, you had the king of brave as a teacher.  Thanks Mitch!<br />THANK YOU MORRIE!!!

B000059Z8J|5.0|Considering how hard it seems for directors, producers &amp; screenwriters to come up with a decent comic book screen adaptation, Richard Donner and company make it look so easy to do with Superman.  By far the best movie based on a comic book, Superman gives us a wonderful story that's both entertaining and heartwarming as it is loyal to the comic book purists who hate when Hollywood takes their favorite comic book heroes and turns them into something completely different.<br />Christopher Reeve was born to play this role, and to me (and millions of others out there) his Superman is the &quot;Definative Superman&quot; that all others will be judged by.  He's exactly how we perceive Superman to be: Logical, strong, sensitive, enduring, with a heart of gold and so on.  He is also the real reason to see the last two Superman movies.  You can say what you want about the movies themselves, but you can't say that he's not good in them, because he is.  I paticularly enjoyed the added scene in this film after he's saved Lois Lane from falling out of the helicopter (and other assorted tasks) and goes back to the fortress of solitude where he converses with his father (Marlon Brando) of how good it felt and that he couldn't help himself.  Jor-El (Brando) tells him not to be hard on himself, but to be mindful of his vanity, for it was vanity that destroyed the Kryptonians.  Finally, Jor-El tells his son how much he wishes he could hug him and Superman reaches his arms out to him as he disappears.  I really liked that.  He has never (and will never) be able to hug his Dad and there's a true feeling of saddness about this that rings true.  I can't believe scenes like this were cut from the original release, especially the &quot;Gauntlet&quot; sequence when Superman goes underground to hunt for Lex Luthor and gets hit by machine guns, masses amounts of fire, as well as cold freeze before finally reaching the entrance of the evil geniuses secret lair.  Never should've been cut!<br />I learned a lot from this DVD.  I was very shocked to learn that Alexander &amp; Ilya Salkind hired Richard Donner to direct Superman &amp; Superman II (as a two picture deal) and then fired him after the first film went on to become a huge success.  Apparantly it was due to creative differences, but I think they made a huge mistake when they fired him.  I'd go so far to say that Superman III &amp; IV would've been hits, had Donner went on to direct the enire series himself.  He would've looked at the script for part III and said, &quot;This is terrible!  Are you trying to destroy the franchise?!&quot;.  A special note to readers: Richard Donner did in fact direct scenes for Superman II, and had it not been for the fact that the original Superman had gone over budget causing part II to be delayed, he may have actually finished the whole thing himself.  What a pity that we'll never get to see what the Donner/Superman Saga would've been like.
0790742780|4.0|I live in Los Angeles, my car windows don't roll down, I don't have AC, and it's summertime.  So I sympathize completely with Michael Douglas at the beginning of the movie.  <br />I think the movie parallels the story of People v Goetz in New York, where the white guy opened fire on some black punks who were trying to rob him.  It became the flashpoint for a lot of racial tension: conservatives made him into a Charles Bronsonesque hero, while liberals were outraged at Goetz' point-blank execution of some of the teens.<br />The same is true with this movie.  This movie IS about the death of the &quot;American Dream,&quot; but liberals would argue that this dream is founded on genocide and racism anyways.  If you place any stock in this dream, the movie serves to deconstruct it-- people living in racial enclaves at war with one another, the transportation system collapsing, the loss of any common culture or language.  There is undoubtedly a conservative streak to the film, and all critics are liberals, who only see difference as a cause for celebration (while these same liberals clump together in Northwest LA in dire fear of the South and East).  This movie is just pointing out obvious realities of life in LA.  Liberals always whine about stereotypes, but I'd like to see Leonard Maltin walk across South Central in the middle of the night.
0679879269|5.0|Last night I lay in bed to read more of The Amber Spyglass. I was planning to read only the next chapter, which was &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot;. Up to that point, I was expecting the climax to consist of pretty much the usual sort of physical, violent combat between the opposing sides until the good guys or the bad guys win. What I read from then on kept me up until 1 AM to finish the book. For me, the end was heart-wrenching, and I still have a lump in my throat from its effect as I type this. I was taken through the entire gamut of raw emotions, and I was (and still am) left with the most powerful, enduring, and bittersweet of feelings when I was done. Since I'm a guy, at first I found my reaction to such a story disconcerting; I couldn't believe a book had affected me so much. In fact, part of my brain was telling me what a wuss I was and how I must really need a girlfriend if I was reacting this way. Yet I am glad I read it. I admire Pullman's integrity as an author, because if I had just written two books and most of a third book about characters like Will and Lyra, I wouldn't be able to end the story like that. But the fact is that there's no better ending. Everything is wrapped up beautifully.<br />Well, quite obviously the ending was the best part in my mind, but the book is excellent overall as well. You will always be eager to go on to the next chapter to extend the adventure. This whole trilogy is heartily recommended.
0802130208|5.0|Short and sweet, this book is one of my favorites . If the Pulitzer Prize never leads me to another book I love, I'm still in it's debt.Read it!
B000059XUI|4.0|Ever since viewing the original Superman DVD and learning that director Richard Donner was fired while he was still working on Superman II, and then replaced by inferior director Richard Lester, who was the one who gave us all the cheesy scenes of Part II (and all the cheesy scenes of part III), I felt that the world was robbed of a truly great Superman series.  Alexander &amp; Ilya Salkind should be ashamed of themselves.  They took a promising franchise and basically flushed it down the toilet just so they could have things done their own way.  Typical Bad Producers as usual!<br />The film itself is still strong, though it would've been stronger with Donner at the helm.  Can't help but cringe when Sarah Douglas grabs a NASA patch off of one astronaut on the moon, destroying his space suit, watching him crash to the ground as if the gravity was the same as Earths.  Pretty unrealistic.  <br />Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, &amp; Gene Hackman are fantastic.  My favorite scene by Chris is after he's lost his powers and is beaten up by a truck driver at a diner.  As he watches the Television and learns that General Zod has taken over the world you can see the horror flooding through him.  Even though it seems futile he persuades Lois to go back to Metropilis while he journeys on foot to the fortress of solitude to look for any way to get his powers back.  Chris is just so great in the role, you can't imagine anybody else.  By the way, I was disappointed that the scene of Superman destroying his fortress of solitude (since people are now aware of its location) was not included in this DVD version.  People still look at the first two Superman movies as being the superiors (though the original is Gold, thanks to Richard Donner).  Warner Brothers could've at least given us a Special Expanded Edition of Superman II like they gave its predecessor.  I mean all you get on all the Superman sequels is the theatrical trailer and cast &amp; crew information.  Maybe one day they'll get around to including the bonus features and added scenes we Superman fans would love to have.<br />Again, it's a shame that Richard Donner was not given the opportunity to finish directing Superman II (and perhaps even taking on Superman III &amp; IV, which he would've made so much more enjoyable).  The Salkinds didn't even give him a co-directing credit for Part II.  It makes me wonder how any good films are made when somebody's always throwing a wrench into the works?  Superman II is still a very good movie, but I'll always wonder how much better it could've been.
B00003CXFG|4.0|No, this isn't the greatest sci-fi movie you'll ever see... actually it's more of a horror story.., it doesn't raise any interesting moral issues, and it's not wildly innovative. It has a basic plot - a passenger ship crash lands on a desert-type planet, the survivors squabble, there's an eclipse, the survivors squabble, nasty thingies come out of the dark and try to eat `em, the survivors squabble... The big surprise here is that it works quite well. It's all very atmospheric, the special effects are good, the gruesomeness is more suggested than seen, which adds to the suspense, the characters are slightly different enough to avoid the stereotypes they at first appear to be, and there's even character development. I figure it works because it's exactly what it set out to be - scary and entertaining.
0375703861|5.0|zadie smith has written a truly wonderful book. it is very witty and original, burgeoning on true literary genius. this novel addresses many age-old issues surrounding our present-day society, as well as problems facing our society's future. it is a philosophically inclined novel with an irresisitibly humorous voice. it is a must-read for anyone interested in a great story, philosophically involved matters, and a mastered writing technique. do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this deeply satisfying book!
B000051VWW|4.0|After eight years, you may think sade lost her touch.  Her soothing voice, her laid back grooves, and the great band.  The truth is, not much has changed.  this album will do for you what every other sade album does for you, and you can put it on at just about anytime.  Yet there is something missing.  This album sounds like Sade alone, not sade the band.  I didnt find any saxaphone or horns in the album, which i can understand.  Saxaphone solo's are basically considered a thing of the past now.  But isnt that what made them so great?  The first single &quot;By your side&quot; was a great single to tell everyone who came back, and the new song &quot;King of Sorrow&quot;, the new single, is one of the weaker tracks on the album.  Its really weird that all my favorite songs on Sade albums have been track 2.  Your love is king from diamond life, Feel no Pain from love deluxe, and now track number 2 for lover's rock.  If you like any of sade's albums, or just need some music to lay back and chill out to, this one will do the job well.  Its still sade, and thats what we love about her.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Making a perfect record is an achievement. And fortunately for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, they have achieved this. 'Californication' is pure perfection tuned to its finest. It's actually near pure perfection, only because one track is incredibly dull, as to the rest of the more upbeat and well-written tracks. (By the way, the worst song is &quot;Porcelin.&quot;) But, besides that one mishap, this record climbs a mountain that the Peppers need to climb. Since their last effort 'One Hot Minute,' RHCP has disappeared from the music scene. Lucky for us, they've come back strong, and with a vengeance. This record has everything that the last few records by the Peppers hasn't. Even though 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik,' another excellent album, is a breakthrough all of its own, 'Californication' has funk beats that would kick the crap out of the Parliament. It has rap lyrics that would cap Jay-Z. It has extroardinary guitar licks that would knock Hendrix out of his grave. Everything seems to be pitch-perfect for the Chili Peppers. With outstanding ballads, like the title track, and all-around awesome funk-rock tunes like &quot;Around The World,&quot; this album is sure to please any music fans ear. All the songs have the urge to raise any emotion from anyone's mind. Songs can either excite (&quot;Get On Top&quot;), sadden (&quot;Road Trippin&quot;) or make one angry (&quot;Parallel Universe&quot;). Every track (except for that one I mentioned) feeds the musical appetite, and leaves you hungry for more. Songs like &quot;Easily,&quot; just make you crave for more of that RHCP genius. The Chili Peppers has a knack for writing great songs and luckily for us, they show us what their talents are on their best album yet. Some records are good, and then some others are the epitome of music. This one falls somewhere in there. 'Californication': an epic of rock music.
0789723107|5.0|This book clearly presents the most useful principles of web design. The uncluttered layout and precise wording gets the message across. It's equally valuable as a guide to starting a new web design or refining/reworking an existing one. Excellent examples of web sites are up-to-date and recognizable. With the focus on principles, rather than excessive examples, the book is also very applicable to the design of intranets.
B00003CX5P|3.0|This is my first review for ....  I felt it was time to \\"rage against the machine\\" as it were.  I was 12 when I first saw \\"Star Wars\\" and, like the rest of the world was an instant fanatic.  I remember my severe jelousy at my cousin's Star Wars action figure and toy collection.  Thus, I was incredibly excited to learn of the newest installment in this epic.  I drove 5 hours in order to view it on the largest indoor screen in the midwest, expecting George Lucas to dazzle me again.<br />What a shock to see the piece ... he offered up for our \\"pleasure\\"!  Jar Jar Binks was amusing for about 30 seconds, and I don't know where they got the kid to play the young Annikin, but he was horrid!  My dog can act better than him.  The Princess fall in love with him, I don't think so!  The mother character could have used about 15 minutes more dialogue, she at least had potential to be interesting.  And where was Owen?  Annikin's brother?  Did Lucas not think we wouldn't remember the previous movies which so consumed our young lives?  And why did he have to make \\"The Force\\" some alien presence?  He could of just left it as the binding power of creation and life.  Georgey Boy needed to give up some of his control on this and allow others to guide the story line a little, making sure the glaring flaws were kept out.  He also should have brought Lawrence Kasdan back to help craft a decent script, the dialogue was really weak.<br />The only redeming factor was Natalie Portman.  She, as always,...the movie.
0671027344|5.0|I am not one to read books, but I could not get my nose out of this one. It's simply &quot;infinate&quot;. Myself, being a teen, i found this book interesting and intense. Perfect for any teenage going through rough times. Stephen Chbosky writes beautifully and sends you into the confusing, mixed-up life of Charlie. Through his life of death, sex, drugs, and more, you feel for Charlie and wish to be there for him through all his times of trouble. The word capture you into Charlie's life as a high school boy:<br />&quot;There is a feeling that I had friday night after the homecoming game that I don't know if I will ever be able to describe except to say that it was warm. Sam and Oatrick drove me to the party that night and I sat in the middle of Sam's pickup truck. Sam loves her pickup truck. I think it reminds her of her dad. The feeling I had happened when Sam told Patrick to find a station on the radio. And he kept getting commercials. And commercials. And a really bad song about love that had the word &quot;baby&quot; in it. And then more commercials. And finally he found this really amazing song about this boy, and we all got quiet.      Sam tapped her hang on the steering wheel. Patrick held his hand outside the car and made air waves. And I just sat between them. After the song ended I said something.      &quot;I feel infinite.&quot;      And Sam and Patrick looked at me like I sad the greatest thing they ever heard. Because the song was that great and because we really paid attention to it. Five minutes of a lifetime were truly spent, and we felt young in a good way. I have since bought the record, and I would tell you what it was, but truthfully, it's not the same unless you're driving to your first real party, and you're sitting in the middle seat of a pickup truck with two nice people when it starts to rain.&quot;  <br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a book that can help anyone get through times of trouble. A truely amazing book with real life experiences. Stephen Chbosky definately deserves two thumbs up for this one.
0767840135|5.0|Having seen the show live twice I was thrilled to see the DVD version of quidam.  Like all of Cirque Du Soleil's videos the technical production is fabulous.  I was slightly bummed to see that the act involving the pair using the weighted red balls was not included but this in no way diminished the package.   Overall I found the DVD stunning and I'm impressed by how well it was adapted from the big top to the screen.
B00003CXN4|2.0|I was a little disapointed in the ending it just left the audience hanging. I thought the movie was somewhat boring, however it was very accurate in many ways and in many other areas it was very HOLLYWOOD.  I understand the effect the director was trying to create, but the harsh lighting and colors combined with the way the movie was filmed just made it all the more difficult to focus on the movie.  If you want to see a movie about the Mexican/American drug problem, you will be pleased to know this movie is more accurate than people think, but I'm glad I didn't pay to see it at the movie theater.  If you are curious about this movie, rent it so if you get too bored you can still turn it off and return it without wishing you hadn't bought it.

B000002WPI|5.0|36 Chambers is arguably the best hip-hop album ever. Released during the early 90's when Death Row was dominating hip-hop and rap music, Wu-Tang put the east coast back on top of the hip-hop world. Tracks such as Protect Ya Neck, C.R.E.A.M., and Method Man illustrate how incredible the album was. Wu-Tang as a group is probably the most prolific hip-hop group ever, yet each rapper holds his own as a soloist. While nearly ever Wu solo members own albums seemingly become a group effort, 36 Chambers is still the best and set a bar so high, that even Wu-Tang's follow up albums have never ever surpassed.<br />If you want a classic, you can't miss with this one.
B000002UAU|5.0|I am only 15 years old, and obviously I was not alive to witness the Beatles together as a group. But, now in 2001, more than 30 years after the breakup of the Beatles, I find myself sharing musical interests with my father and loving Beatles albums, this one especially. A great album like this one will beat a Backstreet Boys or Eminem album anyday, which most teenagers my age listen to.<br />This cd opens like a real &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; concert and gives the rest of the cd a sort of concert feeling, ending where it started on the reprise of Sgt. Pepper. In between these tracks are great, revolutionary songs, all very catchy but at the same time clever and introspective. My favorite songs are &quot;With a Little Help from my Friends (the song on this album I find myself humming the most often), &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds&quot;, a very psychadelic and mystical story (the songs title has nothing to do with LSD - it was inspired by a drawing by Julian Lennon), &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite&quot;, a great, clever song with strange, twisting sounds and  &quot;When I'm Sixty-Four&quot;, a very sweet love song sung by Paul Mccartney of growing old with his love. The only song I can complain about in between the two Sgt. Pepper tracks is &quot;Within You, Without You&quot;, a sitar song written by George Harrison, which although very experimental with a sitar, I find very boring and unappealing. This album ends on a great note with &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; a brilliant masterpiece with different parts written by Paul Mccartney and John Lennon, respectively. Overall, the best of all the Beatles' cds, which is not a feat to be laughed at. Worth every single penny.
0321012542|5.0|THE COMPLETE WORKS OF SHAKESPEARE.  Updated Fourth Edition.  Edited by David Bevington.  2000 pp.  New York : Longman, 1997. ISBN 0-321-01254-2 (hbk.)<br />As complete Shakespeares go, the Bevington would seem have everything. Its book-length Introduction covers Life in Shakespeare's England; The Drama Before Shakespeare; London Theaters and Dramatic Companies; Shakespeare's Life and Work; Shakespeare's Language : His Development  as Poet and Dramatist; Edition and Editors of Shakespeare; Shakespeare Criticism.<br />The texts follow in groups : Comedies; Histories; Tragedies; Romances (including 'The Two Noble Kinsmen'); Poems.  Each play is given a separate Introduction adequate to the needs of a beginner, and the excellent and helpful brief notes at the bottom of each page, besides explaining individual words and lines, provide stage directions to help readers visualize the plays.<br />One extremely useful feature of the layout is that instead of being given the usual style of line numbering - 10, 20, 30, etc. - numbers occur _only_ at the end of lines which have been given footnotes - e.g.,  9, 12, 16, 18, 32.  Why no-one seems to have thought of doing this before I don't know, but it's a wonderful innovation that does away entirely with the tedious and time-wasting hassle of line counting, and the equally time-wasting frustration of searching through footnotes only to find that no note exists.  If the line has a note you will know at once, and the notes are easy for the eye to locate as the keywords preceeding notes are in bold type.<br />The book - which is rounded out with three Appendices, a Royal  Genealogy of England, Maps, Bibliography, Suggestions for Reading and Research, Textual Notes, Glossary of common words, and Index - also includes a 16-page section of striking color photographs.<br />The book is excellently printed in a semi-bold font that is exceptionally sharp, clear, and easy to read despite the show-through of its thin paper.  It is a large heavy volume of full quarto size, stitched so that it opens flat, and bound, not with cloth, but with a soft decorative paper which wears out quickly at the edges and corners.<br />If it had been printed on a slightly better paper and bound in cloth, the Bevington would have been perfect.  As it is, it's a fine piece of book-making nevertheless, and has been edited in such a way as to make the reading of Shakespeare as hassle-free and enjoyable an experience as possible.  Strongly recommended for students and the general reader.avy volume of full quarto size, stitched so that it opens flat, and bound, not with cloth, but with a soft decorative paper which wears out quickly at the edges and corners.<br />If it had been printed on a slightly better paper and bound in cloth, the Bevington would have been perfect.

B000002J1O|5.0|Peter Gabriel's vocal performance on this album is outstanding, his emphasis on syllables, the british accent, and phrasing his lyrics, is in my opinion, genius.  I've never heard more personality and excitement in a voice like this since i bought my first David Bowie record.  The music is outstanding as well, brought out not so much by melody, but by Gabriel's unique characterization of lyrics.  If you are a person who likes language, and appreciates poetry/literature, this album masterfully displays intense creativity, fusing poetry, storytelling and music into one hell of an album!
B00000896M|5.0|I have listened to this album about seventeen times since I bought it a few days ago. It is the best album on epic power midevil metal I've heard. Rhapsody comes in second, but they aren't as serious as Blind Guardian. This album is a concept album, like Rhapsody's three. It's based on a Tolkin novel. It has all the elements of quality metal, good speed, as well as terrific vocals. Then it has great midevil sounding music, like player flutes and minstral guitars. Very different... if your into just speed metal then get Iced Earth or old Metallica, but if you like epic story telling and fantasy movie like soundtracks then these types of bands are for you. I can't say enough about this band. They are just quality midevil metal. If you like Dream Theater's music and classic Queensryche's story telling and Iron Maiden's metal, then you'll like these guys.
B000002NBY|5.0|This is a great album-it is fun.  The enhanced portion of the CD is also excellent-more than just a weblink and music video.
6303269842|3.0|Like so many other movies based on popular TV shows, this one seems to fall a little short, somehow. The cast is fine, although Mel Gibson is a little more intense as Bret Maverick than James Garner was. Garner had a laid-back quality that suited the role well. Putting Garner in this movie was a nice touch, by the way, and he and Jodie Foster are delightful. Gibson is fine, too, just .. different. Of course, the slightly different feel doesn't matter much unless you remember the show, which isn't the case for many contemporary viewers. More to the point, perhaps, the TV Maverick was a western spoof. It was done tongue-in-cheek and relied on humor. The movie attempts the same feel, but the gags are rather ordinary and the plot, while it has some interesting twists in it, is slow to develop. Taken as a whole, &quot;Maverick&quot; comes across as a fun movie, but there isn't much in it to lift above the ordinary. It's too bad they haven't tried making another, though. After all, the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; movie wasn't great, either. I rate &quot;Maverick&quot; 3+ stars. There are funnier western comedies out there and, unless you're a fan, you might want to see this before buying it.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I can't express the ultimate shock I felt when I heard Nichol Kidman and Ewan McGregor sing.  I'm more of an action movie type of girl and I was overwhelmed with emotion when I saw this movie.  It's a mixture of the Rocky Horror and Baz Luhrmanns Romeo &amp; Juliet.  The Soundtrack of this movie is outstanding!  It's just a really fun and different movie.  The use of lighting and the stage is bewildering.  It was like &quot;Let's make this atmosphere what they would have made it like if they had the technology&quot;.  You HAVE to see this movie!!!!
0395759242|5.0|I read this historical account after reading Barbara Kingsolver's POISONWOOD BIBLE. KING LEOPOLD'S GHOST is an incredibly interesting and readable history of the Congo region and about the European &quot;heroes&quot; that left their marks there. Hochschild reveals the truth about the development of the Congo and Belgium's King Leopold II. Once I started reading, I didn't want to put it down. Really well written.
B000007QQQ|5.0|John Martyn has produced an impressive amount of fine music over his long career -- this album, for me, is the high point (closely followed by SOLID AIR).  Don't misunderstand -- just about everything Martyn has released has been of the highest quality, if slightly varying in style -- this period just happens to be the one that appeals the most to me.<br />Everything comes together here in perfection -- Martyn's solid, gentle songwriting coupled with his unforgettable smokey voice and unique guitar style, accompanied by some of the finest players to EVER grace a recording studio (Richard Thompson on guitar and Danny Thompson on acoustic bass).  Placed in the hands of the able producer/engineer team of John Wood and Joe Boyd, the recording itself is crystal-clear and uncluttered, letting Martyn's songs shine through with their own light...<br />...and what a light they possess!  The album's opener, 'Go easy', sets the pace perfectly with Martyn pleading sofly, 'Life, go easy on me -- love, don't pass me by...'  With so many other vocalists, Martyn's breathy delivery might seem affected -- but John makes it seem effortlessly natural.  'Bless the weather' continues in this vein, 'Bless the weather that brought you to me -- curse the storm that takes you home...'  This album was recorded after John and his wife/singing partner Beverly Martyn split -- and longing, loneliness and pain naturally accompany such a rift, no matter the cause or the instigator.<br />There is hope in these tunes, too -- 'Walk on the water' is more upbeat and uplifting, and 'Just now' is one of the most endearing reflections on 'getting in touch' with onesself that I've ever heard.  'Head and heart' is probably the best known of all of Martyn's compositions, having also been covered by other artists.  His original version here pales them all with it's heartfelt simplicity.  'Let the good times come' is a natural partner to the album's two opening tracks -- 'Back down the river' yearns for a fresh start.<br />'Glistening Glyndebourne' is simply breathtaking music --- this long instrumental piece gives John's listeners the first taste of his ground-breaking work with the echoplex, to be followed up often on successive recordings, and destined to stun many a listener at his live shows.  I heard Martyn once here in America on a tour when he was the opening act for Yes.  Much of his equipment hadn't arrived by showtime, but Martyn went on anyway, knocking the crowd -- ready to be showered with the progressive rock of the main act -- back on their heels, bringing the buzzing, cavernous hall to attentive silence.  John, his acoustic guitar, the echoplex and his one-of-a-kind voice filled the arena as few complete bands can do, and demanded attention.  He only played 3 numbers, but he stole the show.<br />The album concludes with a classic, 'Singin' in the rain' -- I've never heard anyone give this song a reading like this, and I've never been so moved by it.  If hearing Alex sing the song in Stanley Kubrick's film ode to ultra-violence, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, while savagely beating and kicking a helpless, bound victim threw the song into a bad light, Martyn's gentle rendition of it here will definitely clear the air.<br />This is a disc that could appeal to so many listeners -- folk, jazz, blues, even pop.  All of these styles have a place in the unique character that is the music of John Martyn.  This is most assuredly an album for anyone's 'desert island collection'.<br />[Helpful hint: together, John Wood and Joe Boyd made up Witchseason Productions, which brought us wonderful music by Nick Drake and others.  Any recording with their name on it is going to be some of the best music from its era.]start.<br />'Glistening Glyndebourne' is simply breathtaking music --- this long instrumental piece gives John's listeners the first taste of his ground-breaking work with the echoplex, to be followed up often on successive recordings, and destined to stun many a listener at his live shows.

0446310786|5.0|Wonderful story!  Many topics to discuss such as: raising children without a mother; the black nanny as the caregiver; the different way that the nanny acts with the white community versus her community; the views of the school teachers towards children that are taught at home; the boogie man who lives next door.....
0440219078|4.0|At the end of this school year, our last novel we read was The Giver. We had to read it for our 'Futuristic' or 'Science Fiction' unit. As our teacher explained it, we all dreaded reading this. The first few chapters made us ALL more interested. Just reading about a 'Perfect' world made Jonas' lifestyle desirable by all of us. Yet, as the book progresses, we just slightly find out more about his life. Jonas lives a pretty normal life..in  his world until his 12th Year Ceremony. He gets selected...as the NEXT Giver! As of that moment he is in training...and his whole life will change. There is no violence, love, pain, and other things.  Not to give away too much, the book gives the definition of Perfection in Life. Something we will probably never accomplish. Read it, and journey through Jonas' life and community. Keep it in mind that it his world is PERFECT, and most of the time perfect isnt that good...
6305252521|5.0|I saw this film for the first time after being told not to go and see it by a friend. I was so glad I did becouse it really is one of the best films ever made. <br />Jim Carry's performance is just stunning, it was amazing to see just how good this actor can be when he wants to. The supporting role also were played really really well. <br />But the thing that stood out for me was the soundtrack, this has been done with such great timing and really fits well into the film. If you haven't seen this film you simple must.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|SCARY MOVIE is a halarious spoof on all the teenage slasher movies that have come out in the past years. The plot of this film is simple: a group of high school teenagers (who look like they are played by actors who are in there late 20's and early 30's) are being stalked and killed in stupid ways by a ghost-masked killer who likes to drink, smoke pot, and rap. This film makes fun of movies like &quot;Scream,&quot; &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer,&quot; &quot;Halloween,&quot; and various other films, as well as TV shows and commercials. There are plenty of sex jokes, fart jokes, and drug jokes. There is also a surprising amount of male nudity in this movie, but you can't take it seriously...I mean after all this is a spoof we're talking about here. This film was written by Shawn &amp; Marlon Wayans and directed by Kennen Ivory Wayans (The Wayans Brothers).
B000002JK4|3.0|First let me state something for the record: I'm a big Led Zeppelin fan. When I first started listening to Robert Plant's solo stuff back in the 80's I was more or less attracted to the catchy nature of some of his tunes (Ship of Fools, for example). But as time went on, I realized that most of Plant's solo work is pretty much devoid of character -- it lacks a certain emotional quality that much of his work with Zeppelin had in spades. I think the primary reason for this is the lyrics. So many of Zeppelin's lyrics are what made the songs great (in addition to Jimmy Page's ingenius guitar work).<br />Plant's solo work simply doesn't convey any emotion or meaning. The songs are all kind of just...there. You don't really feel a connection with the words or the message because frankly, it's hard to know what the message is. Robert has seemingly gotten a bit cryptic in his old age, though I certainly commend him for being as successful as he's been, for such a long time.<br />That said, it is a little unfair to hold Robert Plant to a different standard than other solo artists. Compared to a lot of the stuff on movie soundtracks or pop radio, Plant's music is indeed a breath of fresh air and frankly superior in many respects. If you happen to listen to the radio often, you've no doubt heard songs like &quot;In the Mood&quot; and &quot;Big Log&quot; several times. These are good songs and one's that have more than stood the test of time.<br />The bottom line is, if you like CD's like Pictures at 11 or Now and Zen, you'll probably like this one too. But it's not a classic by any means.....
B000053VAF|4.0|I'm not writing a review of the new special edition dvd which i purchased today, im writing a review for people who haven't seen this film. And i say that you should. If your christian or catholic, and your over 16, you should take a look at dogma. Actually it doesn't matter what faith you believe in, it's only the importance of faith that matters. It's good to think of something, but to have faith in it is much more. Dogma takes a new look into the world of god &amp; jesus &amp; the whole holy thing. Sure there are some dirty jokes in the film but besides that is what the film stands for. It's not intended for comedy but it's made from a comedic genius so what the hell are you gunna do? It's a smart great film that goes inside the world of faith &amp; pictures itself the way some people do. This film is not some joke, because it's a story of faith which takes to the next level in a some what funny way. So im not gunna give alot of clues that u might have heard already of this film, but angels &amp; the 13th apostle, the prohpets, the voice of god, god him/herself can only make you wonder. Or believe. Or to have faith in it.But hey, &quot;God must have a sense of humor, look at the platapus&quot;-Kevin Smith
B00005IBGQ|5.0|I can't believe how good this CD is!  I've just never in my life heard anything quite like this before.  From the first moment I heard the songs, I knew I was going to be a diehard fan :)  I highly recommend it!!

The book is a nice quick read but it is boring and my wife(who only listened to a few hints) and I figured out the killer easily and quickly. And the effete little Periot is almost a farcical figure with his cute little sayings etc.When Mrs. Doyle says, &quot;Why I haven't an enemy in the world,&quot; near the beginning , you know she is, how you say, the &quot;piece of toast&gt;&quot;Thats how cute little Hercules would have, how you say, said it.HE too often comes up  with some really droll wonderful expression like, &quot;Ah, life is so mysterious&quot; or some such.The first, and how you say, the last of her books, I shall open.
B00003CXRP|1.0|Tom Hanks is one of my all-time favorite actors, and when I heard how incredible he was in this incredible film, my boyfriend and I rented it on DVD.  We were both very disappointed.  I won't give away the ending to those who want to see it, but let me put it this way:  1.  The only thing good about the film is the great computer graphics.  2.  Helen Hunt appears, disappears for four years, then returns, and we have NO idea what happened to her in between.  3.  The acting is more humorous than serious or dramatic.  I laughed more than anything watching this.  4.  The ending is dumb.  But these are my opinions.  Hopefully others will think the movie is as great as it was blown up to be.
6302859204|5.0|&quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; is a very awesome movie!!!  Well done!!!  Aliens looked very real!!!  &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; will put you on the edge of your seats!!!  Although the experiance is much  different from what really happened to Travis Walton it was still an awesome movie!!  I recommend read the book also, &quot;Fire in the Sky:  The Walton Experiance&quot;...it is really scary in its own ways!!!  The search is really detailed more than the movie shows..and the accounts of being in the UFO is even more documented!!!  I thought that D.B. Sweeney, did a wonderful job in this movie!!  Along with &quot;liquid-man&quot; from Terminator 2...Robert Patrick(I believe-he also played a great part as Mike Rogers.  Movie was really great...I've seen it 15+ times already...and it never gets old!!!  Is one of my top favorite movies of all time!!!  Thank god I saw it at the movies when it came out!!!  That made it even more scary!!!

B000001EQT|5.0|The Slider was T. Rex's follow up to Electric Warrior.  While it was only a moderate success in America, the album hit number one in the UK and continued T. Rex's hit streak.  The album opens with maybe the band's best song, &quot;Metal Guru&quot;.  Clocking in at barely over two minutes long, the song packs a big punch.  It has an infectious chorus and a blazing horn section that amounts to an all time glam rock classic.  &quot;Telegram Sam&quot; is another great song while the title track boogies along.  The band showed they could play with an edge on the punkish &quot;Buick Mackane&quot; which Guns 'N' Roses would record on their covers album The Spaghetti Incident?
B00000099Y|5.0|When I first bought this album about 4 years ago I despised it.  I tried and tried to get into but couldn't.  Then recently Lateralus came out and it quickly became my favorite cd. So I came across this in my collection and gave it another chance.  <br />It only took one listen to get hooked this time.  The minute Eulogy was over I said &quot;Damn what the hell was I thinking not liking this album before?&quot;  First the bad, I really don't like the filler in this album (Useful Idiot, (-) Ions etc..) they seem to take away the feel of the album.  The only little skit that's listenable is Intermission, quirky and good that one is.<br />Now with the good, the songs are jaw dropping amazing.  All the actuall songs are great.  There isn't one that I want to skip.  I only wish they would've removed all the ... skits and put in a couple more songs.  If I had to choose a favorite song it would have to be H. The lyrics are some of the best I've ever heard.
B000002KP3|5.0|T. Rex and especially its elfin leader Marc Bolan were huge stars in England in the early 70's.  They were the prototypical glam rockers and they racked up number one hit after number one hit in their native country.  Despite the T. Rextasy that swept through England, the band never really caught on in America.  The lone exception was Electric Warrior.  The album spawned their only US top ten single, the pulsating &quot;Bang A Gong (Get It On)&quot;.  Those who only know the band from that song, should check out the rest of the album.  The opens with a strong quartet of songs.  &quot;Mambo Sun&quot; starts things off with a kick and then the album's best song &quot;Cosmic Dancer&quot; is next.  The song has a slow, percolating rhythm accented by a string section and the song simmers along.  The pace is quicken by the other big single the band had in the US, &quot;Jeepster&quot;, which has a popping guitar riff and &quot;Monolith&quot; is a sexy rocker.  Even though the band never hit it big in the US, their influence was felt in the 80's as T. Rex had a big impact on the British new wave invasion bands of that era.
0060930349|4.0|Lots of people here seem to be upset that this is &quot;biased&quot;.  So Johnson should subsume his viewpoint and write a book that takes the same old, tired approach as every other book out there?  Instead, we have a fresh take on the same facts that every other historian can work with, with the difference being that those historians tend to view the world from a left-liberal perspective.  Johnson doesn't.  If his critics can show that he's using information that is factually wrong to draw his conclusions on Roosevelt, Kennedy, Nixon and Reagan (the only ones that seem to be causing any uproar), then that would be one thing.  But interpreting the facts from a different perspective than the norm is not a failing.<br />With that said, I can only give it four stars, for a couple of reasons.  First, some of his facts, as has been pointed out by others here, are incorrect (not so bad as claiming that the US dropped the atomic bomb to end the Korean War, as one history book I've seen said), and should be corrected in any future editions.  Second, it is a bit of a tough read at times, but I think that tended to be when he talked about areas of history that simply don't interest me.  For others, those may have been the best parts of the book.<br />So give it a try, if you want history from a different perspective than you probably have heard if you attended the public schools.  It's worth the effort.
B000002JSN|4.0|This is a benchmark Led Zeppelin album. It is 2 CDs, which is enough reason to buy it, especially given that it is in itself a great album. It has staple Zep songs such as &quot;The Rover&quot;, &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot;, and &quot;Kashmir&quot;. All of the songs, but especially those on Disc Two, explode with the emotion of Page and Plant.
B000002LOE|5.0|After GREEN, the loud, brash, and inconsistent stadium-rocker that was REM's introduction to major-label success, they released OUT OF TIME in 1991. A relatively quiet, intimate album, OUT OF TIME is wonderfully consistent after the disappointing GREEN.<br />While &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; may have been the hit single, it is probably not the finest track on the album. &quot;Near Wild Heaven,&quot; &quot;Texarkana,&quot; and &quot;Country Feedback&quot; (which sounds a little like the later &quot;E-Bow the Letter) are all great tracks. I ever like &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; and disagree with people who say it's a sell-out commercial song. Like &quot;Stand&quot; on GREEN, it shows a band who's never too successful to have fun, here featuring the vocals of Kate Pierson from the B-52s.<br />Musically OUT OF TIME is one of REM's greatest albums, especially &quot;Near Wild Heaven&quot; where vocal harmony is used to great effect and Bill Berry's drumming is right on the mark. The backing vocals of Mike Mills, sadly absent in recent years, are gloriously present here.<br />While not REM's best album, an honor I will forever ascribe to the absolutely perfect AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE, this is a great effort.
B000000OAA|4.0|This album has some very great songs on it (i.e. Brighton Rock, Killer Queen, Flick of the Wrist, Now I'm Here, Stone ColdCrazy, and the barbershoppish Bring Back That Leroy Brown) but altogether not the strongest Queen album. I definitely recommend it, but not for new Queen fans. &quot;In The Lap of the Gods,&quot; also, is better done on track 13, &quot;In The Lap of the Gods...Revisited&quot; The album is more than worth it for the aformentioned songs.
B00000IQMT|5.0|What can be said about the music of John Williams?  Every time that a new score of his hits stores I rush out to buy it.  Along with his score for &quot;The Patriot&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: Episode I--The Phantom Menace&quot; may be his best work in years.<br />This score is a masterpiece.  John Williams takes the themes of the original trilogy and hints at them throughout his new score.  He brilliantly decided to create all-new themes to accompany this excellent, long-awaited movie.  He weaves these new themes, and integrates bits and pieces of old melodies.  The theme for Luke Skywalker and the Force is touched upon in key scenes, while the theme for Anakin masterfully contains the last few bars of the Imperial March, spookily hinting at the darkness to come.  And the bombastic &quot;Main Title&quot;, recognized around the world, makes its grand entrance in the beginning, and is also utilized in key moments.  Even the  motifs for the Emperor and Yoda are used for the evil Darth Sidious and the old Jedi Master, respectively.<br />But the best thing about John Williams' new &quot;Star Wars&quot; score are his brand-new themes, including the &quot;March of the Trade Federation&quot;, the &quot;Theme for Qui-Gon&quot;, &quot;Anakin's Theme&quot;, and the excellent &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot;, used during the climactic three-way lightsaber battle to the death between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and the malefic Sith Lord Darth Maul.  This lightning-paced, rhythmic explosion of scoring may be the most exciting piece that John Williams has ever written.<br />If you love &quot;Star Wars&quot; and/or the music of John Williams, then the score for &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; is a must-have.  If you enjoy it, you should also buy the &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot;, which includes the complete score.  What else can I say---EXCELLENT!!
B00000IAU3|3.0|After hearing rave reviews I eagerly bought this album. However I cannot say it lived up to my expectations in any way. Many songs are indistinguishable from one another and there are no real gems on the album. The best is really &quot;Here with me&quot; but even that can now be annoying due to being overplayed on the radio. I would much rather listen to Alanis Morrisette or Sarah Maclachlan anyday!
B00005A1PR|5.0|I - Intact<br />N - Notable<br />D - Dynamic<br />I - Intact<br />A - Alive<br />A - Amour propre<br />I - Intact<br />R - Relaxing<br />E - Energizing<br />What more can I say.
B000002BDB|3.0|Sorry to say I could not give it 5 stars as I did with the Miles Davis Quintet box set.  There is vast music here, and by far COMPLETE as the packaging states.  The music on the 6 discs are arranged mostly by album the first four discs and the last two discs are simply alternative takes, rehearsals, etc.  This where my rating comes in...most of the music hear are simply different versions or &quot;takes&quot; of the same song.  The album that dominates this set is &quot;Miles Ahead&quot;, a classic album of Miles Davis.  Throughout the listening I felt like Columbia (the producers of the set) should have made this &quot;Miles Davis - Miles Ahead Complete&quot;.  A great example would be &quot;I Don't Want To Be Kiss By Anyone But You&quot;...THERE ARE 10 VERSIONS of it!! That could be confusion to the listener to which is the correct version - then having to refer to the linear notes. Another explanation for my rating is the packaging.  Like I said on the &quot;Quintet&quot; box set.. the discs should have been layout out so that when you open the box you can see the six shiny discs in front of you...instead they are in tight little slip cases which the entire set feels like a book.  The print in the linear notes should have been a seperate book for a series like this.  The print in this set is set so close the spine, you feel like you are going to one day bust the spine to read the linear notes.  But the packaging here excels and sets the bar for other box sets, simply thourough and beautiful.  The sound as been remastered 20-bit digitally, however, as the linear notes will tell you - the tapes haven't been taken care of and &quot;are showing their age&quot;.  I belive some overprocessing went on in the remastering stage resulting in a bright sounding set lacking in the bass department.  When I compare the sound to be &quot;quintet&quot; set the &quot;quintet&quot; is far better with Ron Carter smacking you around with his bass.  You will that God for the programmablitity of CD Players because the frequent &quot;takes&quot; of the same song personally drives me crazy, even though I do like hearing the changes of the sound of the master take from the alternate (sometimes I prefer the alternate versions).  Overall this is a beautiful packaged discs and will offer of what Miles had to offer during this time period with Gil Evans - some of his best work ever.
B00003CXRM|4.0|In their latest film, O Brother Where Art Thou?, the Coen Brothers use their quirky mix of humour and high brow production to satirize Homer's The Odyssey.  Set in depression era south, the film is the comic saga of three convicts on the run done only as the Coen's can.  <br />Like all of their other films, this one contains an ensemble cast of characters unique and compelling.  First, we have Ulysses Everett Mcgill (played to the hilt by George Clooney), a smooth talking man with a streak of vanity a mile wide.  He has a tendency to repeat things (as most Coen characters do) and has a thing for his hair and hair pomade.  George's performance shows he is an actor capable of true greatness.  Why he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this performance is beyond me.  The good thing is it garnered a Golden Globe for him, and was well earned.  <br />John Turturro makes an appearance in this film as well (seems like he is in almost every Coen film).  Here he plays the serious side kick named Pete and delivers a great performance in this role.  The best part is his reaction to The Sirens.  Not quite as good as his performance in The Big Lebowski (that was the best!) but nonetheless, quite good.<br />All of this is set against a backdrop of beautiful scenery and wonderful cinematography thanks to longtime Coen Brother's collaborator Roger Deakins.  Once again the technical aspect of the film is right on the money, the film is stylish without being campy.  The musical score, supplied by T Bone Burnett, is a wonderful amalgamation of blues, bluegrass, gospel and more.  <br />I can highly recommend this film if you wish to add a bit of Coen brother quirkiness to your collection.  Rating: 4 1/2 Stars
B00003CXN4|2.0|Having heard that this should have been the Best Picture winner for 2000, I was extremely disappointed instead. The movie was long, dull and at times very predictable. However, the portions of the movie that featured Catherine Zeta Jones and Benicio Del Toro were decent. Benicio Del Toro's Oscar was well deserved. The Michael Douglas portion was right out of any bad 80's movie about the &quot;horrors of drug abuse&quot;. Forget about best picture honors, how the heck did it even get nominated? As far as DVD's go, this was pathetic. Rent it for curiosity, but don't waste the money buying it.
B00005B6C9|4.0|I have been a fan of the Bee Gees for about 30 years and never get tired of their music.  I always look forward to their latest releases.  This CD did not disappoint me.  I didn't give it a five because that is reserved for &quot;Main Course&quot;.  I would give it a 4 1/2 if it was available.

630382790X|4.0|Looking past the Big Names and high budget production, there was a lot of great acting done by the supporting characters.  I was impressed by the protrayals of the ground crew and how each actor made the crew real people.<br />Other than the sexual conitations in the opening scenes, this is a good, clean movie and would recomend it for anybody 14 and up.  Not younger because the climax is a little intense, even if you do know the outcome.
B00003CX5P|4.0|This movie was to heavily scrutinized! I saw this movie and was thankful that George Lucas came out with the first episode in the Star Wars Saga. I personally was excepting a little more action and more information about the Sith. Darth Maul was a very cool character and shouldn't have been killed off. I always root for the bad guys most of the time. The special effects where excellent and the story seemed to move along very nicely. Although, I would have liked a little more information on a few things. I am sure that in Episode II my questions will be answered. Liam Neeson did an excellent job as a Jedi Knight or master. I really like how the whole first three episodes surround Anikan Skywalker. The Lightsaber Duel had to have been the best in the whole series. We'll see who the big villain in Episode II will be. My wife went with me to this movie opening day and it was a lot of fun. She liked it just as much as I did. Although, she thought the Pod Race was the best part of the movie. This is what movie making is all about, fun. I think George Lucas is having a lot of fun with the new presqueals and so should everyone else!
B0000039LE|5.0|This movie's brillance has made it the slasher film most others look to for comparison.  We all know the simple storyline, babysitter stalked by menacing killer on Halloween night, but the sheer horror it brings out in some individuals is incredible.<br />I remember the first time I watched it years back.  A bud of mine and I were having a fight over which killer was better, Jason or Michael.  Never having seen a Halloween movie myself I couldn't understand why he was so adamant about it.  Lucky us Halloween was on TV that night so I flicked to it.  We watched the first couple minutes then the scene towards the beginning where Michael jumps on the car with the nurse in it comes up.  The famous theme song began playing and after a very short listen of it my friend told me to turn the channel.  Confused I aksed why and then he repeated \\"turn the channel\\" with some added swear words.  I didn't understand what the problem was.<br />This is the type of fear Halloween brings out in people.  When just music will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up then the movie is pretty good.  A couple years later still being a young teen I saw the movie was on again.  I watched it and needless to say it scared me.  I refused to watch the second which came on right after it.  Well now I know none of the sequels could ever achieve the pure horror of the first.<br />In my mind this is the best slasher movie ever.  My interest in this genre has been reignited as of late so maybe I'll find one better but I doubt it.  Even though I think this is the best slasher film ever I don't believe that the Halloween series is the best slasher series ever.  Friday the 13th...
B00005LB9O|3.0|I'm rooting for Travis.  I want nothing, but good things to happen to this band.  I first saw Travis open for Oasis.  I remember thinking that Fran Healy's voice is incredible.  I liked them better than Oasis, so I went out and bought &quot;The Man Who.&quot;  I was very pleasantly surprised.  It was solid from beginning to end and the somewhat popular single &quot;Why Does It Always Rain On Me&quot; became my least listened to song on the CD.  <br />My expectations for &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; were high.  The band received a lot more coverage in the US this time around and I was excited for them.  I heard the first single &quot;Sing&quot; and I was amped to buy the new album.  I already pictured &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; on my list of best albums of the year along with Radiohead's &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, Tool's &quot;Lateralus&quot;, and Outkast's &quot;Stankonia.&quot;  However, I was disappointed.  After a promising start with &quot;Sing&quot; the rest of the album just felt like average no-brainer acoustic pop.  It's a good album, but it just feels flat compared to &quot;The Man Who.&quot;  <br />My suggestion, if you don't have &quot;The Man Who&quot;, buy it first.  Although &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; will probably have more commercial success in the US compared to the prior, I assure you &quot;The Man Who&quot; is better.  Also check out &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, and if your taste in music isn't strictly limited to the melancholy British sound, than definitely check out Tool's &quot;Lateralus&quot; and Outkast's &quot;Stankonia.&quot;  &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; can wait.
B00001QGPS|5.0|I just want to keep this review short and sweet.  Blackout is a solid album in almost all of its aspects.  Lyrically, both rappers are great.  I think Redman's lyrics are more creative and ingenious than Method Man's (just listen to his similies and metaphores), but Method Man flows better and on a whole it makes a solid album.  The production is good except for &quot;Run 4 Cover&quot; in which RZA just does a terrible job.  Otherwise, the album is great.  &quot;How High&quot; remix is my favorite track. &quot;1,2,1,2&quot; is probably my favorite track lyrically for both rappers.  Also, the order of tracks on the buying info page is messed up.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is a really really good CD.  Tool are musicians who in my opinion, along with Radiohead, Primus, Outkast and Dr. Dre that can do no wrong.  Die hard Tool fans may talk up their earlier stuff to seperate themselves from the bandwagon, and make everyone else feel stupid for liking this album, but pay no attention.  I've liked this band since I first saw them live in '93, and I'll tell you straight up, they keep evolving and pushing musical boundaries.  &quot;Lateralus&quot; is a testament to that.  I couldn't imagine this band would have the longevity they've had if they had followed the exact same formula more than once.  So, pick up a copy of &quot;Lateralus&quot; and enjoy.
B000002V0Q|5.0|\\"Countdown to Extinction\\" is one of the best Megadeth albums ever, with Cryptic Writings in a close second. From the second this CD starts you are [taken] in by \\"Skin O' My Teeth\\" and \\"Symphony of Destruction\\". But in my opinion the best song is \\"This was my Life\\" with a mixture of great lyrics and burning guitar and bass riffs thanks to Dave Mustaine and Dave Ellefson. Also the little monologue in \\"Captive Honour\\" is awesome.This Cd blows any Metallica album away and is a must buy for any Megadeth fan. So my advice is BUY THIS CD! Peace Out.
6305451591|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie.  The message it sends is so uplifting.  The tragedy of the Holocaust is taken seriously, while it sends a message of hope!  You have got to see this!
B000000OSW|5.0|This album is the first album I ever bought and I admit I bought it based on the &quot;Steam&quot; music video that was shown on MTV.  Yet, when I bought and listened to this album, the music just spoke to me.  The more you listen to this album, the more it grows on you.  I love all the tracks on this album, especially &quot;Come talk to me&quot;, &quot;Blood of eden&quot;, and &quot;Secret World&quot;.  I bought this album twice because, the first cd got worned out and I still don't get tired of listening to the music.  So please buy this, you wouldn't regret it.
0671027344|5.0|From the first page you fall in love with the innocent character,  and you relate to all the times you had at the age and that time, and how niave you were. Seeing it all again for the first time with Charlie. I have recommanded this book to everyone and have lent it out many times, to recieve rave reviews. Also all the other 'Pocket books' like, Floating, Fake Lair Cheat, Peices, are all great books with stories youll never forget! so buy the little green book with the boys long legs on the front and read about Charlie, and yourslef.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Guy ritchie is a savage... snatch is a brilliant movie which i think every person owes it to themselves to go watch.  You may die laughing.. but there is not a dull moment throuhgout the entire movie.
0452282152|5.0|Chevalier brings 1600s Holland to life in this great novel. Her characters are for the most part vivid and true while her prose is honest and sometimes breathtaking. Although one suspects early in the novel that Vermeer would eventually paint his somewhat repressed maid, Griet, Chevalier brings the smallest of details of this event to life. The novel ends of course with Griet's triumph over her many obstacles, including Vermeer's wife. A original and well written novel.
6305073341|1.0|when i first saw this movie back in 1994, i did not seem to care about violent content in movies. But that was 6-7 years ago, and I haven't seen the movie since. i just rented the regular movie edition (R-rated not X-rated Director's Cut) on dvd, and I had seen the x-rated director's cut and thought it ruined such a great movie. But then I saw the R-rated version and saw still how much graphic and gruesome violence there was in this movie. I will never look at Robocop the same way. I will never buy this on DVD or VHS again. If u have a weak stomach that gets sick after watching body parts fly in the air and see a man get brutally murdered, then stay away from this gorefest. WORSE THAN THE SCREAM TRILOGY! If you want to see Robocop just rent the 3rd movie which is PG-13 and has less violence in it. Take my word for it.
0385335482|5.0|Ok, yes, I'm ready to admit it.  I, Torysmama, am addicted to British &quot;Singleton Ficton&quot;.  Now, I'm not talking &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; here.  This is BETTER than Bridget Jones.  I'm talking &quot;roll on the floor&quot; better than Bridget...a &quot;fashion tatse to die for&quot; better than Bridget.  I completed this fabulous work of fiction in one sitting and laughed through the entire novel and immediately jumped on Amazon to see if the author had more...give me more, I thought, but sadly, this is her first novel.  She must write another.  You will not regret reading this book, in fact, you will love it.  The protagonist of the story, Rebecca, is every credit card company's nightmare.  Let's just say that she's never met a sale that she didn't like and she's met lots of shoes that she does!  Her motto should be, &quot;If it's on sale, then I'm really saving money!&quot; In a time where we're all up to up eyeballs in debt, this is the book for us!
B00004XONN|5.0|This album is trance inducing.  I like it because I feel it marks a significant point in Radiohead's musical growth. &quot;OK Computer&quot; , an earlier attempt at hi-fi composition didn't amount to much, as far as I'm concerned, but &quot;Kid A&quot; shows they've finally put their new tech toys to good use. They know how to use them better now and are actually making enjoyable, expressive music, instead of simply putzing around.  The album successfully melds their older accoustic style with new tools, and the result is a mixture of spaceship noises, drum and bass, jazzy brass sections, and good ol' whiney vocals and guitar. Good for driving to, walking to, talking to, just about anything.
B000056PAO|5.0|The CD is great, the songs areall wonderful, but buy the regular TINLTL and the Generator UK import single. Its cheaper that way. The generator single has Fraternity on it plus bonus live tracks. You'll definitely enjoy the music if you are already a fan, and if not I most highly recommend this CD.
B00000373U|5.0|Smith's song writing is superb, and this album is for reflecting, relaxing to, and closing your eyes and shaking your head, because you can't help but relate to his pain and frustration.  He's not just sad though, and his whispery voice has a definite strong, edgy punch.  The songs evoke beautiful imagery and phrases that demand attention like &quot;people you've been before that you don't want around anymore, they'll push and shove and won't bend to your will, I'll keep them still...&quot; He's taken the hummy, mellow vocalist style from mid '60's folk rock/pop, but added his own, somewhat dark, sexy, genuine urgency. Guitar playing is similarly delicate with just enough harsh outbursts of angst.
0345350499|5.0|The Mists of Avalon is an epic novel that entraps the reader only to spit them out again as a different person. I started and finished this book mostly in fourteen wonderful afternoons. I can compare this book only to the old testament of the Bible because of its array of characters being born and dying as the book follows their descendants' destinies. As an avid reader of Anne Rice's Vampire chronicles, I came out of this book with a keen awareness of mortality in characters of books. Many people will say that some person dies in a book or a movie as if that character would not have died anyway, at some point in some later book or movie (assuming that there are infinate sequels). The Mists of Avalon has a powerful and gripping rhythym to it, almost a circular feeling. Anyone who loves a good book will love this book. I reccommend it to all people.
B00001NFCY|5.0|This album is one of the best I have ever bought! The lyrics are from Deep thought from the lead singer ( Scott Stapp) and Guitarist(Mark Tremonti). Everything is put together very well and the songs are very powerful, great Drum, guitars and lyrics. Spearheaded by &quot;HIGHER&quot; this album is sure to blow you away. &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; , a powerful ode to Scott Stapp's son, came from the heart and is definately a favorite! I most Definately recommend this album very much and will always buy Creed albums in the future!
B00000DI2T|5.0|Before the blinding glory of Mahler's auditory world illumined my life, I was unaware that music could touch the very soul.  To call these works symphonic is diminutive; they are symbiotic, becoming a part of the listener, growing with him, and changing his existence forever.  I purchased this set having heard only a few bars of the music--but I was pulled to it, unable and unwilling to resist.  I can say, without fear of coming across as too mystical, that my union with these monumental works was destined, and that they have infused me with a depth of passion hitherto unknown.  They are life-changing, and reading testimonials can only aggrandize your zeal for experiencing Mahler.  Rest assured, this set is simply magnificent, and is easily worth the price.  Buy these discs, and prepare to embark upon a new era in your life.
B00005AXEL|2.0|My best friend and I are debating which 4 tracks are the most listenable on this album. <br />I choose &quot;Too Far From Texas&quot;(which is too country for his taste),&quot; &quot;Candlebright,&quot; &quot;Bombay Sapphires,&quot; and &quot;Love Is.&quot;<br />Joe chose &quot;Candlebright,&quot; &quot;Bombay Sapphires,&quot; &quot;Love Is,&quot; and &quot;It's Only Love.&quot;<br />Actually, there isn't much to debate here.  I also enjoy &quot;It's Only Love.&quot;  Beyond these 5 songs, however, there is little substance to be found on this album.  Buried among the flash and glitter are glimmering sparkles of the magic that made Stevie Nicks the legend that she is today.<br />Joe and I both consider ourselves to be long time enthusiastic fans. We were each blown away by her earliest endeavours as a solo performer and as a member of Fleetwood Mac.  Either of us would place &quot;Bella Donna&quot; and &quot;Wild Heart&quot; on any all time favorite albums list.  Therefore, after a seven year wait,  we mutually anticipated a fabulous show of her gifts on &quot;Shangri-La.&quot;<br />Unfortunately, the title track set the tone for this calculated effort to reclaim her popularity with the masses.  Like too many other self congratulatory recent works by truly gifted performers (the latest efforts from Tracy Chapman or Sade as examples), here is the case of a legend repeating past history in order to regain the spotlight...The song, &quot;Trouble In Shangri-La,&quot; sounds like Stevie does Stevie! It's like listening to her imitate her own classic style and sound in a karaoke setting.  Neither the songwriting nor the musical composition sounds original or fresh.  This is a problem that pops up like a virus on many songs of this album.  There is no obvious hit of the compelling and hummable kind here such as &quot;Stand Back,&quot; or &quot;Edge Of Seventeen.&quot;  It sounds as if song structures and fragments, familiar notes and lyrical phrases are being recycled fromthe dustbin of earlier work.  This is not necessarily bad; &quot;Planets Of The Universe&quot; and &quot;Fall From Grace&quot; display an energy and content that resembles some of her more respectible efforts with Fleetwood Mac.  On the other hand, some of the lyrics are truly inane (&quot;Sorcerer,&quot; &quot;Love Changes,&quot; &quot;I Miss You,&quot; &quot;That Made Me Stronger.)&quot; The delivery of some songs on this album also sounds tired and uninspired (witness the lackluster banality of the first single &quot;Every Day,&quot; which nonetheless has a sensuous and mystical music video).  <br />Upon its release, the media were building this project up to be  Stevie's comeback album in the vein of Santana's recent blockbuster &quot;Supernatural.&quot;  A parallel between these works involves the presence of many talented performers.  Whereas the Santana's collaborations are successful, multilayered explorations into divergent musical styles, Stevie's work with outside influences tend to result in an uneven, inconsistent collection of sounds (she overpowers Macy Gray's voice on &quot;Bombay Sapphires,&quot; a song we consider one of the album's highlights; she fails to share the microphone with Sarah McLachlan on &quot;Love Is,&quot; a song that would captivate if only their two distinct vocal stylings were contrasted and intertwined for maximum effect as a good producer would ensure.  The only duet that works is her collaboration with Dixie Chick's Natalie Maines(&quot;Too Far From Texas&quot;), yet comparing this with previous duets with Don Henley(&quot;Leather And Lace&quot;) or Tom Petty(&quot;Stop Draggin' My Heart Around&quot;), the song falls short of classic status.<br />The production of &quot;Trouble In Shangri-La&quot; is slick, yet there is a lack of cohesion between the songs and the material begs for heart.  It sounds like outtakes from an album rather than a hit.  This review is not intended to discourage anyone from buying the album.  At anyrate, you will own at least 4 or 5 good songs that you can program to play repeatedly over and over again.
B00005B36H|5.0|I had never heard TOOL so far, mostly since I am a lot more into what is usually referred to as progressive rock. I was attracted to TOOL's Lateralus after reading briefly about it in the RS magazine; somehow I felt there was something very good to be found.<br />I was fully satisfied (or to make it clearer I felt it was EXCELLENT) right after the first listening. I consider it has the uniqueness of presenting a style which is like putting together Rage Against The Machine, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd. Usually I enjoy pretending I can play the guitars, which are fantastic on this record, but I feel that the drummer here had a specially super great time since this shows throughout the CD.<br />For certain passages I believe it would have been great for TOOL to have some keyboards adding to the music, but at the same time maybe that would have driven the music in some other direction and I think the album is great as it is. (Maybe TOOL can later build on the idea of recording a live concert with an added orchestra, &quot;a la Metallica&quot;.)<br />ROCK lovers, don't miss this one!<br />Fernando
B000001IPL|5.0|When I first heard The Offspring, it was the horrible pop abomination Americana.  However, at the time I liked it, and that led to me buying some of their other CD's, and I found out how much they really ROCK!  Ixnay on the Hombre is cool, and the new album is alright, but this is the album to buy.  The music is still somewhat unrefined (in a good way), and the band hasn't started to become poppy yet.  This isn't &quot;Pretty Fly&quot;, this is real punk-rock/alternative.  If you even remotely like the band, I will tell you now: YOU NEED THIS CD.  Buy it, now.  Don't finish reading this review, just buy it.  You have my stamp of approval.  Every song is cool, especially &quot;Gotta Get Away&quot;, &quot;Bad Habit&quot;, &quot;Self Esteem&quot;, and &quot;Smash&quot;.  But they all are really cool, so it doesn't matter which ones I like.  A must-have, plain and simple.
B000002J09|4.0|I love this album, it's amazing, it's filled with different styles of music with &quot;black Dog&quot; and &quot;rock and roll&quot; being the hard rock tunes, &quot;The Battles of Evermore&quot; being the acoustic haunter, &quot;stairway to heaven&quot; being the classic, teenbopperish song, &quot;Misty mountain hop&quot; going into hard rock, &quot;Going to California&quot; being a sweet, campy acoustic, and &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; showing that John Bonham was a very powerful drummer and loved to use effects.. &quot;Stairway&quot; is a good song but I don't know, when it comes to Zeppelin you can't really decide what is the best song..
B00000IAU3|3.0|I finally broke down and bought No Angel last week.  I was beaten into submission by the &quot;Thank You&quot; barrage on the radio for the past year or so.  What finally did it was watching a repeat of Dido's performance on The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn, who was gushing over Dido for week.<br />First, Dido's voice is amazing.  However, Dido'sdistinctive voice creates one of the problems on this CD forme. Dido's voice doesn't fit with her lyrics, in my opinion.  She hasthat wispy, British Isles sound, and it is matched with(sophisticated) Alanis Morissette men suck lyrics.<br />Now, before the Paula Cole crowd lynches me, I loved Jagged Little Pill.  But these lyrics don't match Dido's distinctive voice.<br />She hate man, man hate her, but voice sounds beautiful.  I don't know, it just doesn't work for me.<br />That being said, &quot;Hunter,&quot; the second track (performed on Kilborn) is unbelievable.  &quot;Thank You&quot; is a song you can repeat many times without tiring.<br />Overall, good, not great.  The whole package just didn't click for me.
B000002JSR|5.0|This album holds strong memories for me and possibly for Zeppelin fans, released in '82 it was the last of led Zeppelin, 8 songs only 33 minutes long and classic.  This proved many things about the band, Robert was a fantastic singer, Jimmy was a guitar god, JPJ was an amazing bass player and arranger, and John Bonham was an amazing drummer and you would be sadly missed.  The pictures inside go from the early years around '68 and '69 to the last years going into the 80s where Robert got a little bigger, Jimmy got smaller, JPJ looked better, and John Bonham's alcohol abuse got worse and he got very big and bear like compared to the rest of the members.  This album will always make me happy when I listen and the closing of &quot;bonzo's Montreux&quot; will always remind me the power of John &quot;bonzo&quot; bonham!
6302869390|5.0|I am really very interested in buying this video in VHS or  DVD format. This concert is a Classic and is incompressible that has not been reedited.  I invite to all those that  saw the picture on '72, enjoined this music and are still interested in acquiring this video to initiate a campaign  through these reviews or directly to The Record Company. If somebody knows the name or e-mail, please let us know to send mails asking  for the reedition of this concert.  The incoming year will be the 30th Anniversary. It will be  an excellent reason for a new edition.  Please show your interest.
B000002J1U|5.0|yep, this is a FANTASIC album, it took a lot of bad reviews at the time because everyone expected Zeppelin to write Radio singles and harder rockers than led Zeppelin 2.  The album starts off with pure hard rock with &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; but lets up and goes acoustic with &quot;friends&quot; then hippish in &quot;celebration day&quot; than to blues with &quot;since I've been loving you,&quot; which presents some of Robert's best howling and sad moanish crying I've ever heard than back to solid hard rock with &quot;out on the tiles&quot; than from &quot;Gallows Pole&quot; to &quot;Hats off(to roy harper)&quot; you have acoustic ranging from happy to sad &quot;I don't want to live anymore&quot; ballads. Even acoustic Zeppelin is great because I mean.. Jimmy Page learned acoustic before electric and it's obvious in a lot of his playing!
B00003CXDG|2.0|Am I the only one who thinks that John Woo is overrated?  I have enjoyed many of his films, but he has become a parody of himself.  In any given John Woo film, you are sure to see doves fluttering through the air, a stand-off between two protagonists simultaneously pointing guns at each other, a woman whose only real reason for being in the film is to form a triangle with said protagonists, far too much slow motion photography and a healthy dose of obvious religious imagery that has little, if anything, to do with the story.  This time around, I just couldn't work up any interest in what I was seeing.  It all felt so tired and old.  And that motorcycle duel belongs on a short list of the most ludicrous action sequences I have ever seen.  This film is only for those who believe that Woo can do no wrong.
B000002JSJ|4.0|yes.. I know what you are saying.. This album is bad, I don't want to listen to it, 7 songs and they are WAY too long.  Well very true but then again I can say that Zeppelin doesn't have a worst album, they always remained fresh with ideas and full of energy but on this some of it is gone but also note the condition of the band.. The year was '76, Physical Graffiti had sold a lot of copies, the tour was over, and Robert got himself in a car accident.. and to come up with an album like this in that condition is truly amazing, Page is a genious on guitar and this album proves it with &quot;achilles last stand.&quot;
B00003CXDZ|5.0|For my birthday, my best friend took me to see Moulin Rouge, which promised to be a confusing, fast-paced explosion of music, death, and sex.  Both my friend and I absolutely loved it, but we're also in our early twenties, already fans of Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet.  The real test for this movie would come a week later, when I brought my parents to see the film.  I was expecting them to think it was too fantastical, too over-the-top.  But they enjoyed the film because of its simple, operatic/Victorian love story and the comedy of an absurd group of characters.  The film, though many disagree, is a working combination of genres and time periods.  With songs from the seventies and the eighties serving as the major musical numbers, we can laugh at ourselves for having liked &quot;I Will Always Loved You,&quot; as Nicole Kidman falls for it hook, line, and sinker.  The music is familiar and fun.  A sing-a-long of sorts.  Though Kidman can't sing, Ewan McGregor belts out a series of beautiful, overly-earnest (but well within character) numbers.  The sets are beautiful, the stars are beautiful.  Everything else is funny.  Moulin Rouge is infinitely better than Romeo + Juliet; Luhrmann takes himself much less seriously in this outing, which saves us from having to laugh at him, not with him.  See this film for the pure visual excitement; see it again for the reworking of a traditional, but highly effective plot and the clever lines you missed the first time.
B000002J03|5.0|wow, this album is almost perfect when everyone thought Led Zeppelin was a fad they came out with this piece of hard rock history that made everyone buy.. It featured Led Zeppelin's top 10 hit &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; which is very impressive but to tell you the truth all the songs on this labum are worth the listen, the follow up to the self titles smash deserves a little recognition don't you think?
0688170528|2.0|I can see by the reviews on these pages that there are a lot of people who loved The Pact.  I am not one of them.  While the story may have had some potential, Picoult doesn't develop anything.  There is nothing special about this novel at all, it's just a run-of-the-mill story.  No humor, no character development, no believable characters, no thought-provoking observations, nothing to distinguish it as anything but a quick read.  She skims the surface, gives us predictable and somewhat boring and indistinguishable characters.  As a quick read, it's not awful, but that's about the best I can say.
B000002J0B|5.0|Yep, this album probably made A LOT of people made, but it surely is a classic, I can't write a full review because everything on it rules! just listen for yourself..
B000002J1S|5.0|A curious one, this. A mass of contradictions. A sprawling, pompous prog-rock concept album packed with taught, snappy tunes. A showcase for the virtuoso musicianship of this most British of progressive bands, but featuring some of the most awesomely tight ensemble playing you will hear this side of a Bartok string quartet. This was the sort of music that punk rock was invented as an antidote for, and yet its obession with the phenomenology of inner city street life was two decades ahead of its time (rap is still going down the same graffiti-strewn alley today).<BR><BR>The story behind the stylish, surrealistic lyrics is that of Rael, a young Puerto Rican graffiti artist on the streets of New York, who finds himself catapulted into a symbolic underworld (a sort of Jungian Hades) where the meaning or possibly the meaningless of his former street life is played out in a series of surreal cameos involving a cloning (The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging), religion (Carpet Crawlers), various sexual urges and anxieties (The Lamia, The Colony of Slippermen, The Doktor, etc.), disorientation (The Chamber of 32 Doors), and death (Anyway, The Supernatural Anaesthetist). The final message about saving one's own self through self-sacrifice is almost but not quite religious, and its curiously cautious optimism does not at all clash with the rest.<BR><BR>This was the last album Genesis made with Peter Gabriel as principal lyricist and vocalist, and the last but two featuring the astonishing Steve Hackett (now a successful solo artist in his own right) on lead guitar. Provided you can cope with the odd few minutes of self-indulgence it ranks as one the band's best albums. It certainly contains some of the best playing and one of the best studio productions of their career. In fact many would see it as the high point of Genesis' career as a real rock band (i.e. before it became a matching accessory for Phil Collins' solo career).<BR><BR>A particularly interesting feature of &quot;The Lamb&quot; is how modern it still sounds. Apart from a few cheesy moog noises that clearly date the work to the days when synths were an exciting novelty, it is all tasteful and clean. The rhythm section of Collins and Rutherford shows an almost uncanny rapport - they seem to work better together than on some much later cuts, while Gabriel's vocals and lyrics are a good advert for the stellar solo career that was about to be launched. <BR><BR>As usual it is Banks who provides the matrix that holds everything together - one of the enduring mysteries of rock is why his solo projects never quite gelled with the record-buying public. The classically trained keyboard virtuoso provided much of the unique quality that set Genesis apart from other progressive bands in the seventies, and that keeps their early material sounding fresh and challenging today, viz. a grasp of musical architecture. They knew how to use space, different instrumental textures and compositional structure in a way that no other rock band ever equalled let alone surpassed. <BR><BR>To me and to many others, the band's subsequent inch-by-inch descent into the swamps of adult-orientated radio rock is one of the great musical tragedies of the late 20th century. &quot;The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway&quot; is not perfect and is arguably not their best album. Nevertheless, in this mixture of good and average, punk and classicism, indulgence and discipline, experimentation and pop, &quot;The Lamb&quot; captures everything that almost made Genesis the greatest rock band ever. And as with all true classics, much of sounds even better now, nearly 30 years on, than it did on first release.
B000002JSP|4.0|Listening to this album makes me laugh, there is some funny stuff on this album and I think the point was to mock the whole disco movement.  While all the other album focused on everyone else in the group except for John Paul Jones this is HIS album. You have a lot of nice synth work and Robert's voice is in top condition like it had been before, it sounded soo much like it was going to be their last studio album recorded at the time and surely and sadly, it was.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I've been a Savage Garden fan for a long time and heard alot of their songs. This album is probably my favorite because the music is extremely inspirational, and so are the words. Affirmation is such a positive song which could help any bad turn around and be happy. The songs really take you on an emotional journey. Darren and Daniel made this album to tell about a human struggle and how we can all come through alive. This cd has helped me come through alot of problems in my life, and my freinds have been helped by it too. This album RULES!!!
B000002JSN|5.0|This album simply is great, I can't see anything wrong with it, the first 6 Led Zeppelin albums should just be on the 100 greatest albums list ever.. I mean disc 1 is the hardest stuff from Zeppelin you could ever hear than the second disc gives you a variety of sounds that range from the early grunge, into acoustic, and sad depressing ballads, truly a classic double album!
0399146393|1.0|I read the last 3 novels of P.C. in a heartbeat, but it took me more than 6 months to finish this one. The first 100 pages are so uninteresting that I had to force myself through them.<br />If we discount the unnecessary intense brutality, cruelty and incredible violence, there is very little plot or new information in The Last Precinct.<br />That said, one cannot discount Patricia Cornwell's mastering of the English language, but it is not enough to make an interesting novel. It really seems that she had to produce a new book to satisfy her Publisher, despite she was short of inspiration at the time.<br />The pace is very slow, and I was wondering, with only a few chapters till it's end, how there will be time enough to give the reader a satisfying \\"ending\\". To my opinion, it didn't, and I have found the development very hasty and the abundance of coincidences lacking credibility.
0425107469|5.0|This book is top rate from beginning to end. You will  not put down this book unless nature makes you. Fall in love with the sweet dog and everybody else.So visually descriptive feels like your seeing it in person. Will stay in your heart forever.Grab a tissue you will cry and laugh with this story!!!
B000002U8A|3.0|..They were light years beyond today's &quot;boy bands&quot;. I guess they had better producers and musicians backing them up back in the 80's.     There are two tracks on this CD that show a degree of maturity in this group and hint to their later work (not the Robert Palmer garbage, the stuff after that): &quot;Tiger Tiger&quot; and &quot;The 7th Stranger&quot;. As for the other stuff, the first billion times I heard it on the radio was plenty enough for me.
B00005LB9O|5.0|Of the hundred albums that I have purchased this year, Travis's &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; is by far the best.  There seems to be a greater level of comfort on this album among the band to just let it all out and spill their gutts to the world.  This album is for the real people out there.  It's about the music -- and nothing else.
B00004SCX6|4.0|**I would first like to begin by saying that over half the reviews posted here are written by extremely ignorant Christina Aguilera/NSYNC fans who dislike Britney for some reason... I think opinions are being stated rather than reviews(I would bet you 10 bucks that Christina /NSYNC fans have never even listened to the album**<br />Well anyway... I have indeed listened to the entire album of \\"Oops I Did It Again\\" and I must say that Britney Spears did a really nice job with the album! If you are a pop fan or have grandchildren or children who are then I would strongly recommend that you purchase it! The songs are pretty straight forward, they are easy to listen to and fun to sing along with! Some songs to check out are... Stronger, Oops I Did It Again, Lucky and much more! And personally, I think that Britney did a really nice job with the remake of Satisfaction! (**even Mick said he was very impressed with the remake)! I think Britney has got a very nice voice and expresses it well! **for all you who think that there is \\"studio magic\\" going on are completly off your rocker Havn't you ever seen \\"BEFORE THEY WERE STARS\\" on VH1? Britney sounds exactly like she did back then as she does now so quit living in your little fantacy... THE GIRL HAS TALENT!!... I'm sorry... back to the CD! Overall Bitney Spears' sophmore attempt was very successful.... (I mean come on... 1.4 million albums in 1 week... that should tell ya something)! So if you are looking for enjoyable pop music... \\"Oops!...I did it agin \\" has it!!... I hope I could help!
6304385668|5.0|&quot;Michael Collins&quot; is a fantastic movie, but it doeshave some things about it that [where not good]. Julia Roberts should never have been in this movie and the part about Harry dying in the sewers in inaccurate and it portrayed De Valera as an evil bad-guy, but other than that it is a fantastic movie. I recomend it to anyone interested in the history of Ireland.
B00005176F|5.0|Excellent collection of songs from the british alt/rock group. Yes,  sometimes they are compared with R.E.M. May be the group also spot the  similarities, in one of their albums('13') they have a song named  'BLUR.E.M.'. They are talented but not as good as R.E.M.(it's only because  R.E.M. is a huge huge huge band) but their songs are more catchy ... you  listen it once or may be twice and you will remember the tunes. The songs  are a bit pop sounding. I like the way Graham the guitarist makes  strange noices occasionally ... like in 'Coffee and TV&quot;. The tracks I like  are ... well almost each track. The last 2 songs &quot;Music is my radar&quot; is  funky with some offbit guitar-riffs, &quot;For tomorrow&quot; is great to shake  your body with. I just don't have the time to pass a comment for each of  the huge list of songs. Just like to say they are all great. Often it  happens for me that after buying a compilation album and liking the  band, I think that &quot;Oh! there are so good, I should have bought the  albums.&quot;. In three cases it didn't happen - 1) Tom Petty &amp; the heartbreaker's  Greatest Hits 2) Neil Young's Decade and 3) Blur's Best of. I am really  happy that I bought this (and not the albums). I Don't know why as I  generally prefer albums. <br />I searched for a weak track and was not quite successful. So, I have no  option but giving them 5 of the following character - *.
B00003CXA6|5.0|&quot;Gettysburg&quot; is based on Michael Shaara's novel &quot;The Killer Angels,&quot; and both works focus on this crucial battle on July 1-3, 1863 through from the perspective of five key figures: The first day of the battle is dominated by Union Calvary General John Buford (Sam Elliot), who slowed the Confederate advance to preserve the precious high ground for the Federal army.  The second day comes down to the efforts of Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) and the 20th Maine, who hold the extreme left end of the Army of the Potomac at a crucial moment in the battle.  The third day focuses on the clash of wills between General Robert E. Lee (Martin Sheen) and his veteran commander James &quot;Pete&quot; Longstreet (Tom Berenger), who have been arguing offense versus defense throughout the battle, climaxing in the fatal finality of Pickett's Charge.  The focal figure of the Charge is Confederate General Lowell Armistead (Richard Jordan), who must attack the position defended by his best friend Winfield Scott Hancock, made all the more poignant by the fact that this was Jordan's final role; he died from a brain tumor the same year this film was released.<br />However, it is the character of Chamberlain who emerges as the hero from this film.  Chamberlain was featured as well in the celebrated PBS documentary &quot;The Civil War,&quot; and the result is that he has become the idealized citizen-soldier or gallant knight of the Union army.  The result of his military and political career is almost as fascinating as his defense of Little Round Top, for which he received the Congressional Medal of Honor.  Jeff Daniel's performance is certainly the finest of his career to date, and he gets to give an eloquent speech on the Civil War as a fight to make other men free.  His interplays with veteran Sergeant &quot;Buster&quot; Kilrain (Kevin Conway) deal with the war on a philosophical level, which is not surprising because the man is a college professor.  But in the heat of battle he proves himself, and while we cannot imagine ourselves being Robert E. Lee, we can identify with Chamberlain.  The end result is that the best part of the film comes not at the end, but before the intermission.<br />This DVD has some excellent extra features.  Side A offers the 1950 documentary &quot;Battle of Gettysburg,&quot; narrated by Leslie Nielsen, which tells the story of the battle entirely in terms of shots of the hundreds of monuments and statues covering the National Battlefield in Pennsylvania.  &quot;The Making of 'Gettysburg,'&quot; the other main feature is on Side B, and does a nice job of capturing the sense of reverence the actors and reenactors had for making this movie on locations in and around the actual battlefield.  There is also an interview gallery, theatrical trailer and four televison spots, on location footage and battlefield maps.  The commentary track, which is only for selected scenes and not the entire film, focuses primarily on the actual Battle of Gettysburg.  Unlike most commentaries, what you will find here matches up with what is happening on screen and there are several sections keyed to specific shots or lines of dialogue, which is much appreciated.  In addition to applauding the historical accuracy of the film, McPherson and Symonds make a fascinating case for Lee's logic in ordering Pickett's Charge.  Shaara had based parts of his novel on Longstreet's memoirs, and since Lee died without ever writing his own, a case can be made that the historical record is somewhat skewed.  They also do a bit of debunking regarding Chamberlain's decision to do a bayonet charge.  Maxwell's most interesting section is when he talks about how they studied the films of Kurosawa and other masters to come up with the best way of shooting battles sequences, which resulted in setting up difficult dolly shots for the Battle on Little Round Top.  Civil War buffs will enjoy this commentary much more than film students, butthat is totally appropriate for this particular film.<br />Every year I watch &quot;Gettysburg&quot; on the four days covered in the film, June 30 and July 1-3 (then on the 4th of July I watch &quot;1776&quot;).  Only &quot;Glory&quot; is on this level in terms of depicting Civil War battles.  This film touches me with the opening credits, where the photographs of these real soldiers are replaced with those of the actors playing them.  This is quite evocative, especially when Randy Edleman's evocative score swells as we see the face and name of George Pickett.  Even if you have never seen this movie you have undoubtedly heard Edleman's score, which has been used to advertise several films and for the closing credits of the Olympics broadcast.  It should have been nominated for an Oscar.t that is totally appropriate for this particular film.  <br />Every year I watch &quot;Gettysburg&quot; on the four days covered in the film, June 30 and July 1-3 (then on the 4th of July I watch &quot;1776&quot;).

B00005LKHW|5.0|&quot;American Pie&quot; was a much-needed film in the stuffed-shirt late 90's. Teen comedies had been run into the ground in the 80's and Pie brought them back into the fold.<br />Shannon Elisabeth Rules, Tara Reid comes in a close second and Mena Survari rounds out the awesome threesome. Cannot wait to see the sequal.
0385495323|5.0|I cannot put it down as soon as I started to read this book. The historical development of cryptography was presented in a highly logical and easy to understand manner. At each stage in history the problem facing codebreakers and codemakers are presented in such a precise way such that when the solution was described, you feel like you would have solved them by yourself. As in most of the problems, when the solution are found it makes the problem looks so trival that you do not understand why you stuck with it at the first place. The technical detail are interwoven with fastinating historical stories. You can read it as a novel or a collection of mind-boggling puzzles. As a person who loves solving puzzles, this is my first book on crytograpghy and it certainly raised my interest to read more about the topic.
B000000643|5.0|Then make it this one! Their most amazing work. Here, they peaked, shortly before death and dissolution. Like Buffalo Springfield, just about too much talent for one band to hold, and this line-up lasted about three albums, more or less. Too many amazing songs amazingly done on one album. The wonders only cease when you get to the end of last track, a cover of Bobby D's &quot;Million Dollar Bash&quot;. Here, throughout, they brought out the best in themselves. Atlhough &quot;Liege and Lief&quot;, their swan song contains their most essential song (&quot;Tam Lin&quot;), and their most beautiful one (&quot;Crazy Man Michael&quot;), Unhalfbricking is a non-stop tour-de-force throughout. As I said before, doubles up nicely with the significant &quot;What We Did On Our Holidays&quot;. The key players would never work together again after the end of the sixties; I really wish the name had been retired after that; but of course, I never would have experienced a great concert with Sandy Denny at Philadelphia's Academy of Music in 1976, otherwise. The air of magic on Unhalf, however, is always on. If you pick up &quot;Heyday&quot;, and Richard and Linda Thompson's &quot;I Want To See The Bright Lights Tonight&quot;, then you would have all the essential albums by this group. Buy anything else by this group, and you may wonder what all the fuss was about. After &quot;Sloth&quot;, you've certainly gone past it, irregardless of what the other reviewers say; trust me, or waste you money. Oh, who's that older couple? Sandy's parents.
0783226063|5.0|The reviewer is right when he says it is a love-it or hate-it affair.  If you like dark sci-fi movies (a la Bladerunner) you will probably enjoy it.  Think of this as a vision movie.  A lot is said in pictures, tone, and body language; not dialogue (much as Conan was told in music).  Overall, it is better than the Sci Fi version, unless you are a FX junky, need dialogue driven storytelling, or were big on the book (as it does explain a lot more), in which case you will hate it.  There are some major concerns.  The effects are not great, but it was released in '84 with a budget nowhere near Return of the Jedi--come on.  Remastering would probably help (as it did with Star Wars).  Another concern of many is the constant whispering (to show the what the characters think).  I personally loved this idea.  But for those hard of hearing or easily annoyed, it can be aggravating.  The story is fractured and syncopated.  It was intended as such, to be told in dreams and windows to different characters.  The one critical flaw (IMHO) is the breakdown of the story 3/4 way through (5 minutes was devoted to 2 years of time).  I got the feeling that Lynch cut a bunch out right there.  Also, the lack of expanation gets old.  Whether or not these areas are the case with the 3+ hour TV version I can't recall as I have only seen it twice (the latest ~10 years ago).  My suggestion: rent it and watch it, don't listen to us.  You will like it or not, only you can decide.
B000002NJS|5.0|Despite having her new record out, \\"Music,\\" Madonna has an ever better record, \\"Ray of Light,\\" a sweet, cool, sentimental side that Madonna's exploring.<br />Though pretty long at 6 and some minutes, \\"Drowned World\\" is a strong starting song. \\"Swim\\" has a nice sort of religious ring in the lyrics, and the sound and depth of Madonna's voice make all the better. \\"Ray of Light,\\" is a fluffy, lightweight techno-pop song, but clarity and lyrics make it perfect. \\"Candy Perfume girl\\" is a sort of enigmatic, nonsensical song in the lyrics, but the beat and the revamped voice of Madonna, which have gradually became much better during the years, make it irresistable to listen to. \\"Skin\\" is a sort of mysterious message of mortality and death, but the mystique of the beat and the length add to the better of it. Rating: \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" draws heavily on Madonna's earlier life, how it's changed and she's changed, a nice sentimental song with a can't-miss beat and the lovely voice of Madonna herself make it a song worth listening to if you're down.\\"Sky Fits Heaven\\" is a nice, but not good enough to listen two times in a row (no offense to Madonna or her fellow fans). \\"Shanti/Astangi\\" is a mellow yoga song, perfect for doing yoga with. \\"Frozen\\" is a heartbreaking, deep song, for a nice romance/dram movie. \\"Power of Goodbye\\" is a fulfilling song about unfulfilled love. \\"To Have and To Have Not\\" is less enjoyable than the latter two, but it's also about lost love. \\"Little Star\\" is a touching ballad written for her daughter. \\"Mer Girl\\" is an enigmatic, but fulfilling ending song.<br />All in all, it's a enlightening, mellow record.

B00004TH83|4.0|Skipping over the fact that many critics claimed Lara Fabian of becoming a blooming Barbra Streisand, I decided to take my chances anyways and give it a try. Ah, what a glorious surprise! As I scanned her english debut with no expectations I was blown from my stance with overwhelming shock that left me speechless. The opening track Adagio (english version) trapped me in its web of desire, never once losing me in its grasp. The rest of the cd is splendid as well, the highlights being: I Am Who I Am (powerful song of self-dependence), You're Not From Here (which really hit home with me), Yeliel (My Angel), and the despairingly beautiful Broken Vow. Ms. Fabian can sing circles around any other so-called screeching diva (e.g. Mariah Carey, Christina Aguilera, Whitney Houston) without a try. Her blend of pop, soul, and dance will leave you spinning on your heels, or nailed to your seat in awe. And if you're wondering why I chose a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star rating is because I fear  sometimes she belts those high notes so high that it sets my cavities to ringing. (don't laugh!)<br />P.S. I don't understand why people compare the likes of Sarah Brightman with Lara Fabian. They're completely different in contrast.
B000002HNR|5.0|&quot;Absolutely Live&quot; is a cool CD precisely because it is The Doors outside of the studio and performing some great songs live, to the worshipping concert audience. There is always a special quality to hearing an artist live rather than studio recorded, as is the case with artists like Santana, Sting, Creed and Dave Matthews Band. The Doors sound just as great live as in the albums. And the songs are pure delights. Jim Morrison is fun and cool as he sings &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot; Which is a quazi-romantic song in exhilarating flavor. The best medley in this album is the &quot;Whiskey Bar/Backdoor Man&quot; performance which is alive and full of feeling (especially with that primal scream Morrison lets out before &quot;Backdoor Man&quot;). &quot;Break On Through #2&quot; is a fresh take on the original song while &quot;When The Music's Over&quot; is epic (and funny when Morrison tells the crowd to shut up). &quot;Not To Touch The Earth&quot; is wonderfully weird and full of strange, interesting images. It is also nice to hear Morrison resight some original, interesting poetry. The best poetic track is when he does a deep, captivating recital of &quot;Lions In The Street&quot; (which is still better than the William S. Burrough's version in &quot;Stoned Immaculate&quot;). All in all, this is a great record of a band performing some great rock music live.
0780622553|5.0|This movie is so visually stunning, words cannot describe!  Everyone should see this underappreciated masterpiece!<br />How anyone could call Dark City one-dimensional is beyond me.  I found it pleasantly subtle and thought-provoking.<br />Much like the Matrix, you walk out of the movie wondering if it could possibly be true on some level.  But that's the extent of the \\"thriller\\" aspect to the movie.<br />I think people expected to see the Crow with a bunch of creepy pale guys that jumped out of the shadows and scared everyone.  It's more film noir than anything.  For that reason, those with shallower tastes would find this movie boring.<br />If you have an appreciation for the \\"classic\\" style of movie-making, you'll love this movie.  And though Dark City is often referrenced to Metropolis, I see more similarity to old detective flics.<br />When watching, you'll be on the edge of your seat throughout.  You are never disinterrested.<br />Like many good movies, Dark City's plot walks a knife-edge.  It could go too far into the softer side and become cheesy and unrealistic, or it could stray further into the darkside and become unpleasant and pessimistic.<br />I deeply enjoyed this movie.  It is visually stunning, thrilling, and it is so pleasant to see a healthfully-budgeted movie turn into such an uplifting departure from the usual Hollywood ...<br />This film gives us hope that for all of the major studio's failures, we can still occasionally spend the seven bucks on something worthwhile!
B00003CXP1|5.0|This movie is deep, it touches you on the inside, after watching it you feel like you are nothing, your probelms are childish and you dont belong on this earth...not great feelings, but i have never been touched so deeply by any movie, it seems so real, but at the same time you dont want to believe that these things can actually happen to people...If you think that there is a chance you will like this movie, BUY IT, you will never regret it, the movie it great... THOUGH replay value is limiting cause its hard to put yourself through those emotions again, unless you're trying to introduce the movie to other people.

0440211727|5.0|I've read this book several times-one of my favorites.  I believe this is Grisham's best work.  The reader is drawn in from the first page to the last.  The scenes are graphic (at times) but that's what makes the book enjoyable.  Although the justice sought by Carl Lee is vigilante you know that it's the only way justice will be served in this small town. An excellent job is done in the decriptions of the people on both sides of this legal thriller.  When reading the court room scenes, you want to be in the court room because you want justice for the Hailey family..
B00004Z459|5.0|This is a great cd. Its has a good rythym and beat. The words are true and make sense. It is a good tune to listen while ur on the road or in ur house, thats if you like rock. The group is great, its like a mix of Staind and Nirvana. Only better. &quot;Cure for the Itch&quot; doesn't really have words but a mix of beats. Then Crawlin, Papercut, One Step Closer and Etc. are fabulous. This is a must have. Listen to the samples and know what i mean.
B00005ATQD|5.0|This movie has been widely hated, even in circles where Kubrick is usually revered. One Salon reviewer even argued that _Eyes Wide Shut_ was a preachy, dogmatic monogamist tract, on the shallow basis that something bad happens to every character that seeks extramarital sex.  I couldn't disagree more. The film's final lines suggest both that dreams can be equally as significant as reality, and that a single experience can never define an entire life. Kubrick seems to be saying that a single act of unfaithfulness, whether real or dreamt, does not have to undermine a relationship. Commitment, then, is not a set of arbitrary rules and agreements restricting your partner's sex life, as the Tom Cruise character at first seems to think. This unrealistic, fairy-tale view of his marriage is shattered, plunging him into a surreal, paranoid world of conspiracy and intrigue. By the end, however, he has realized (as his wife already has) that commitment is something renewed from day to day. The film thus points out the dynamic quality of something often considered to be static and constricting, i.e. a marriage, and celebrates commitment without demanding an unrealizable, perfect faithfulness.<br />Despite many critics' assertions to the contrary, _Eyes Wide Shut_ seems to me to be quintessentially Kubrick in its surrealism, its strong use of color (vibrant reds and purples predominate), and its sophisticated theme. An attentive viewer (unlike the majority of American critics) will see that there is much more to this film than a little supposedly explicit sex. Extra props for Kubrick's ability to create a mood that is magical, erotic, and deeply paranoid -- an achievement that rivals David Lynch's best work.
630382790X|5.0|There's nothing closer to a perfect movie than \\"Apollo 13\\".  It has every element one could ask for, plus it really happened!  The only thing I could do without is the smoking and too much cussing but I was able to look past all that after seeing it about 25 times (so far)...<br /><br />It's still beyond comprehension why Tom Hanks got snubbed for Best Actor and Ron Howard for Best Director and the movie itself for Best Picture when they all clearly were.  Maybe they're saving it for \\"Best Picture of All Time\\".  That statement doesn't come easy from someone who's as picky about good movies as I am.

B0000558LN|5.0|I think that this movie was one of the best ones I have watched in a long time.  The story about the girl from a small town trying to make it big is the story of many people in real life and can really touch their hearts because it is possible to make it big.  Adam Garcia and Piper Perabo play their parts extremely well.
0393037010|5.0|The Aubrey/Maturin series starting with the Master and Commander has caused me to read the series over and over again. On occasion I have had to travel and my first inspiration is to find a good book at the airport bookstore. Well, on a recent trip I decided why take a chance buying a book that might be a dud. So I told myself  I'll just read the first 4 or 5 books. Well I'm on The Hundred Days for the third time. I'm just as pleased now as I was the first time. Excellent series I just wish it could go on.
6304077939|5.0|This movie is deffinetely 'outside the box' and a far cry from Hollywood formulas. One of the few movies to really get under my skin. A lovely dark comedy about a young boy following the familial tendency towards delussion, fantasy and ultimately insanity, beginning with his unbending belief that his was an immaculate conception - the result of his mother being impregnated by a lot of tomatoes infected with the sperm of an Italian farmer. The addition of the prose of Rejean Ducharme makes this film truely eloquent and poignant.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I have an extremely hard time picking my &quot;favorite&quot; movie ever, because I keep changing my mind, but Memento has a very legitimate shot at getting the number one spot forever.<br />An un-original story told in an innovative and original way with extraordinary acting (Guy Pearce and Joey Pants both deserve Oscars), and the best ending since The Usual Suspects (okay, maybe The Sixth Sense too).  The end of the movie makes you really want to go back and see the whole thing over again.<br />Honestly, I don't know what to say because the movie was so good.  I went with high expectations of seeing something that wasn't retreaded Hollywood garbage, that was an exciting thriller with a real story, good action without overdone special effects and with real acting.  I was not disappointed.<br />I swear, if this movie doesn't win an Oscar in every eligible category, something is amiss.
0767802470|5.0|GOOD MOVIE! it makes your stereo flex its speakers and crunch its woofers
0451199871|3.0|I'll be honest here, this isn't her best. I enjoy Miss Marple mysteries, but this one didn't grasp me as other Agatha Christie books (I highly recomend &quot;And then there were none&quot;.) If you want a book to keep you reading until late at night, dont read this one. Halfway through the book, I tossed it and picked up, &quot;Sleeping Murder.&quot; Also by Agatha Christie. I did give it three stars though because it did provide some &quot;whodunnit&quot; atmosphere, but not enough to keep me reading. Hope I helped!
0792841344|5.0|This is a must for any Horror buff and/or collector.
B00005LB9O|4.0|I would not say that this the album of the summer by far, but it is a pleasant diverson from all of the stuff that you hear on the radio day in and day out.  Travis likes to create and play.  It likes to create melodies that you just cannot help but enjoy.  Although I do not think that this is as good as their previous effort, it is still worth owning.  Lyrically, ehhhh? But musically, it is a beautiful landscpe.  Great to drive to, clean the house or just simply lie down on the bed and drift off.
B00003CXRM|1.0|I have replaced my DVD of &quot;o Brother&quot; twice now- All three copies cause the DVD player to FREEZE at precisely the same frame at the tail end of chapter 20- this glitch can not be fast forwarded thru and it requires my player to be unplugged from the wall for 30 seconds in order to get the player working again.<br />A terrific movie- but the DVD itself is awful.,
B00003CXRP|4.0|This was truly one of the best movies I've ever seen. I'm a big Tom Hanks fan anyway, but don't know many other actors, if any, who could pull off what he did in this movie.  It was a great story, from start to finish.  I've seen it twice already, and highly recommend it.
B00005B36H|5.0|i wish i could give this cd 100 stars, it is so good. ive been a fan since the lollipalooza tour back in '93, and i still have yet to find a band as good as these guys. though it doesnt top out Aenima, it is just as good. the cd is dark and complex, and there is no way in hell that another band can beat these guys. tool will open your head, crawl inside, and do their work until they have you hooked. tool is a group of true musicians, and i know for a fact that they will never sell out. they are all about the music, and nothing else. relax, turn around and take my hand!
0345441184|4.0|I bought this particular book because of the preview for the miniseries.  I don't usually read these type of books, but I was able to enjoy this story.  At times I had to go on to other books because it seemed to drag on with the alternative religion, but from the women of Camelot's point of view, I think it was a pretty good book.
B000031XCR|5.0|This is an enchanting CD that captures the heart of everyone that hears it.  The depth of the words and magical music tunes on every song just grab everyone's attention as the name Celine echoes through thier mind.  This is the way I feel every time I listen to this CD.  Celine is one of the few great singers we have left,  which are slowly being replaced by singers like Britney Spears:(      I highly recommend this CD to everyone.  BUY IT NOW!!! :)
B000056H25|4.0|I think this movie is really good to a sense it was made like in the 60's, so i got to give them credit for making a great movie back then.In every jesus movie (except a few) jesus is always shown as carrying the full cross, and they force simon of cyrene to carry the cross for jesus.In  this movie simon see jesus staggering under the wight of the cross and volunteers to help jesus he holds the cross and carrys the cross ALONGSIDE jesus till the romans force him away,little bit of a twist. but didnt judas supposedly hang himself from a tree, in this movie he supposedly throws himself into the firery flames in the temple? But above all this movie is excellent despite some flaws. should be seen by everyone
B000003TB6|5.0|Hadn't it been for this album, there would be no Slum Village, no Ummah, and not a lot of live instrumentation that is utilized regularly (via 'live hip-hop bands' or in house production of albums) in hip-hop music today.  Do You Want More, an innocent offical debut (there were 2 Roots LPs before) paved the way for more than most people know of in hip-hop today.
B00003CXN3|2.0|Just another movie about drugs; selling them, doing them, etc. (Yawn.) What's with all the hype? Don't believe it's a &quot;must-see&quot; just because the ads and the critics say so. They are both bought very easily. The cast is good but how much entertainment value is there in watching a father lose his daughter to drugs and then to prositution? We can see that for free on Jerry Springer. And we are supposed to care about people who are so absolutely stupid? This film, just like real life gives you no reason to care about people who choose to be morons. This film makes you wonder if the producers and writers themselves were high. People on drugs should enjoy it though. It will support their dillusion that they are cool and a rebel. Unfortunately because of this film's success we can expect a dozen carbon-copies within the year. Remember when movies used to be a good experience?
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido has a wonderful voice that compliments her lyrics wonderfully leaving the listener going 'wow.'  The music, the lyrics, and her voice will leave you coming back to this CD time and time again.
6302787564|5.0|This film is absolutely mesmerizing. Michael Douglas snaps one day and goes wandering through Los Angeles. I think it's interesting when you read reviews on this movie from people in the midwest who don't get this movie. People in L.A. on the other hand certainly do get it. I can tell you from personal experience of living there and being held at gun point by scumbags that anyone could be pushed over the edge in LA. I found this movie to be laugh-out-loud funny especially when Michael Douglas orders a &quot;Whammy Burger&quot; and when he tries out his rocket launcher after an argument with a Cal-Trans employee. &quot;There's nothing wrong with the road, but I'll give you something to fix.&quot; I don't think people outside of LA can appreciate that scene as much. And watching Michael Douglas on that golf course had my side hurting for days from painful laughter. Yes, it's sick but the way he looks down at the old guy and says, &quot;And now you're going to die...with that silly hat on&quot;, was fantastic. And how about the scene with the white supremist? If you think this movie had too many stereotypes, then you've never been to LA. It's a sick place with sick people where sick things happen. Yes, it's awful that people get shot, but a lot of people in LA deserve what happens to them which this film boldy proves. Studies have shown that the combination of stress, traffic jams, and smog can make someone lose it. What's the point? The point is you should appreciate wherever you live as long as it's not there. Michael Douglas should have got an Oscar for his performance. This was the best movie of the year although it's obviously not for all tastes.
B000002UB3|5.0|Arguably the best Beatles album ever but if you are a Beatles fan you already know that and you are alrealdy set on buying it.  But if you are new to the Beatles (don't see how that is possible) this is a good place to start...the end, why not start here and work your way back.
020530902X|5.0|This book's small size is representative of its content: &quot;Short and sweet.&quot; (My kind of reference book) Strunk is a no-frills kind of guy, and this is demonstrated in this concise, but powerful treatment of writing style. I advise any writer, technical or not, to obtain a copy of this one. Because of it's valuable content and low price, it's one of the best bargains around.
0679879269|5.0|The Amber Spyglass is one of the most courageous books I have ever read.  For all of us who ever dared to venture out of the mold, out of the little boxes  we were put into  even before birth, this is a refreshing book. Question everything!  Investigate!  Do not accept what has been passed on as truth -- inquire! If the adults do not question their world, the kids must.  It is fascinating to read such important questions being posed and answered in such a fascinating, optimistic, down to earth manner.  Hooray for Pullman, may he write much more on this -- we all need it.

6305807086|5.0|This film could quite possibly be the most original thing to come down the pike in years,along with &quot;Pi&quot;,which is just as jaw-droppingly wierd.If you're reading this you probably know the plot already,so I'll just say that despite the plot,it's actually very entertaining.John Cusack is his normal piquant self,regarding the proceedings with a bumused,but slightly over-it smirk.He has the most affecting raised eye-brows I've ever seen.Cameron Diaz plays his wife.I read in all the press stories about the film how she's totally playing against type in this,and she plays down her beauty for the role.Uh,O.K.,yeah,I buy that.Sure,she's HIDEOUS.Anyway,her awe-inspiring beauty doesn't distract from her great performance.It's sad,shatteringly intimate,and poingnantly insightful,without a trace of cliche.Easily her best work.Katherine Keener is another story altogether.Her character Maxine could send the most confident,shallow,thick-skinned lady-killer on the planet into therapy for a year,clutching a teddy bear and sucking thier thumbs.She scared the [insert euphamism] out of me,but in a good way.Orson Bean is pants-wettingly hilarious,as is the priceless Mary Kay Place(&quot;I'm sorry but I can't understand a word you're saying&quot;).My only complaint is they could've gotten a more convincing actor to play John Malkovich.This DVD has some neat extras,especially the interview with director Spike Jonze.Without giving it away,let me just suggest not watching it too soon after dinner.Also check out the Page With Nothing On It.Genius.Highly recommended for anyone sick of the same movie over and over.
B00005KHEU|2.0|If you are just starting out on dicovering ELO, this is not the album to begin with. You probably know the album's best tune, &quot;Don't Bring Me Down,&quot; but if you don't know the rest of the album, don't expect the other tracks to live up to that one. While &quot;DBMD&quot; is good rocker with the kind of great melody that we had come to expect from Jeff Lynne by 1979, the rest of the album falls short. By this time, burn out was settling in and Jeff was losing his ability to come up with decent melodies. One listen to the chorus of &quot;Shine a Little Love&quot; or the verses of &quot;Last Train to London&quot; will clearly illustrate this. In addition, with this album, Jeff decided it was time to jump on the disco bandwagon - a fad which was already beginning to fade by the time of the album's release. In many cases on this album, the sound and production values became more important than the music and the songwriting suffered as a result. Fortunately, time has healed this wound and the new ELO CD &quot;Zoom&quot; is a welcome return to form for Jeff as a first rate songwriter. If you want to dig back into the 70's and hear some good examples Jeff's ability to write a great tune, then check out &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; or &quot;Eldorado&quot;. Jeff was at his peak as a pop songwriter on these records. If you want to hear what Jeff can do when he decides to tackle longer epic works, then check out the brilliant &quot;Electric Light Orchestra II&quot; (ELO's 2nd album from 1972 - not one of those bogus Electric Light Orchestra Part 2 albums from the 90's). Jeff took rock 'n' roll places it had never been before with ELO 2, only to quickly change direction on the next album. &quot;Discovery&quot; is unfortunately, quite a disapointment compared to any of the ELO albums the preceded it.
B000000WJZ|5.0|The second Pumpkins album represented everything 90's Rock was capable of,blessedly free of all the overkill and cliches the band's admirers feared.The opener &quot;Cherub Rock&quot; is a miracle of tightly compressed sweep and dynamics,as the guitars pummel and soar,and Jimmy Chamberlain nails the track to the floor with his drumkit.Billy Corgan's repeated angry plea to &quot;let me out of your scene&quot; summed up his unfasionable will-to-power,as he refued to wallow in slacker ennui,knowing full well what his talented, accomplished band of misfits were capable of.As this astounding album progresses,all doubts as to his sincerity are blown away.&quot;Quiet&quot; is a gnarled,billowing rocker;&quot;Today&quot;could justifiably be called a &quot;Power-Ballad&quot;,but it's exquisitely wrought textures and aching meloncholy put it light-years beyond 80's sap-metal.&quot;Soma&quot; is this record's jaw-dropping centerpiece,with it's hushed,down-tempo dirge-like opening and Big-Rock closeing section,it restores the good name,and more importantly,the creative spark to multi-tracked guitars and artful song-craft.By fusing genuine creative passion in an age when irony ruled,and idiosynchratic personalities to universal themes,the Pumpkins carved out an indelible niche for themselves in the Rock pantheon.
6305537798|5.0|It took me awhile to finally get around to seeing this movie, but once I did...it was all worth it!  I even watched it with my mother, and if I can watch it with my mother it has to be good.  Hot, rising young stars, consistant, good humor, and Heath Ledger.  What more could you really want out of a movie?
0843178132|4.0|I loved the Mr. Men and Little Miss books when I was younger, and I truly enjoyed this book when I read it a few days ago!  It's great for children, as it teaches them the meaning of the word curious as well as how someone's curiosity can affect others.  Being older, I enjoyed the artwork and the ability to reflect on the fact that I too was Little Miss Curious when I was a child and probably drove my mother crazy!  Definitely buy this!
0802713319|5.0|In solving the 350-year-old problem of Fermat's &quot;last theorem&quot;, Andrew Wiles faced the challenge of weaving together disparate fields of mathematics and inventing a few new ones - his success is documented here. But Simon Singh faced a parallel challenge in writing this book, and must be appreciated for his achievement.<br />Popularizers of mathematics face the inherent twofold challenge of (a) taking some portion of a subject that the huge majority of readers are frankly afraid of and making it interesting and (b) representing the vast power underlying mathematical ideas while remaining intelligible. In the former case they often frankly succeed by the self-selection of their readers. This now-narrowed readership is then typically more approachable with the mathematical challenges of the latter. Hence the success of Stewart, Paulos, Devlin and the like.<br />Singh's challenge was increased because of the addition of that third element. The range of mathematics which Wiles' proof and the history of the problem traversed is, simply put, incredible. On top of that, the mathematics behind Wiles' proof was acknowledged in the mathematical community to be at a level that even 95% of mathematicians could not comprehend. How to distill that in a meaningful way?<br />The one thing Singh had going for him was the pure magic of the story. A mathematical problem simple enough to be understood by a 10-year-old is launched, in fact, on the epic story of its pursuit by a real 10-year-old over 30-odd years! He uses this and his considerable skills as a writer to tell a story that is gripping throughout.<br />But Singh does not shy away on the mathematics. He does. For instance, a fine job of presenting the notion of rigorous mathematical proof. Having poked around this topic for a few years, I would also have to say that his is the best &quot;lay&quot; presentation of some of the most challenging elements of the mathematics of the proof, so called &quot;modular forms&quot; and &quot;elliptic curves&quot;, that I have read.<br />Along the way, this book does a wonderful job of representing the sometimes turbulent, but fascinating lives of working mathematicians - especially those at the peak of their craft. I suspect that this book, together with NOVA's &quot;The Proof&quot; (and perhaps with some credit to Wiles!) has led to the recent swell in fictionalized accounts of such lives (and such proofs). I, for one, was led to read the delightful &quot;Uncle Petros and the Goldbach Conjecture&quot; and &quot;The Wild Numbers&quot; (casting light on the grayer lives of less-talented mathematicians) and noticed the arrival of the new, hit Broadway play, &quot;The Proof&quot;. All three available here on Amazon!
B00005B4GU|2.0|Amnesiac is pretty much its own album:  it's a B-side collection from Kid A, and, even though there isn't as much as a developed concept in this album, and even though Radiohead hasn't made a quantum leap since their previous album, I already have an eyebrow raised at Amnesiac.  I think I wrote something about this, but I forgot about it.  (No pun intended.)  <br />1) Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box -- this is an okay track, but there's nothing special in it.  There are no lyrics wrote for this song.  It's just Thom saying &quot;I'm a reasonable man/Get off my case&quot; to the same layered note(s).  There's nothing in this song when it comes to OK Computer, because it has no difference in repeated notes and in any way does it contain songwriting. 2) Pyramid Song -- I enjoy the song.  What can I say?  A hard-to-find, ever-changing tempo piano? 3) Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors -- I can skip this track.  It sounds like it was made from a microwave oven, but it's downright awful.  This is Radiohead's next attempt to not use actual vocals.  Does Radiohead not want to make this a brilliant album? 4) You and Whose Army? -- Pretty good; doesn't match up to anything on OK Computer. 5) I Might be Wrong -- Okay, but I am ashamed of Jonny Greenwood. They could have gone so far with this, but dropped it to the same 3 boring chords, or maybe 4. 6) Knives Out -- This could be something that a traditional 5-dude band could write, but Thom's ever-going vocals that are also never-going, and it's trying to be about cannibalism, almost shame the song, along with the odder drums.  I'm thinking the band is getting lazy and trying their best not to be popular, with no-songwriting skills and annoying vocals. 7) Morning Bell/Amnesiac -- Remixes aren't usually supposed to be on a Radiohead concept album, when they are much, much worse. Hint, this song is about divorce. 8) Dollars &amp; Cents -- better than Knives Out...but the same deal. It, in the same way, is like the rest of the album: an unfinished project. 9) Hunting Bears -- Guitar ambience...GRITTY, MINIMALIST guitar ambience...I like this piece. 10) Like Spinning Plates -- Probably the best track on the album.  Here, it seems intended that Thom's voice was intentionally scrambled, because it is beneficial to the track behind it.  Other times, I think they're just playing with computers. 11) Life In A Glass House -- Sorry.  National Anthem could beat the crap out of this.<br />Radiohead, trying not to be popular.  Amnesiac, trying not to be brilliant.  Amnesiac is a half-decent album, maybe a little less, but it just doesn't compare to OK Computer or The Bends.  Even Kid A.
B000002MTR|4.0|With 1991's BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIK, funk-metal pioneers The Red Hot Chili Peppers had not only found commercial success (finally after 7 years of recording), but creative as well. BSSM still hadn't battled the Chili Peppers' legendary struggle with filler, but it was certainly their best album to date, and a follow-up were sure to be eagerly awaited. But during the 4 years after BSSM, guitarist John Frusciante was forced to leave the band due to personal conflicts and his burgeoning drug problem. Taking his place would be Dave Navarro, ex-guitarist for seminal alternative band Jane's Addiction. With Jane having helped introduce elements of '70s arena rock and metal into the previously anti-tradition alternative rock, one would have expected Navarro to steer the Chili Peppers in a similar direction. However, the resulting album ONE HOT MINUTE wasn't the sign of a new era more like the Chili Peppers creating funk-by-numbers. The album does start out strong though with the first single &quot;Warped&quot;. The dark funk of this song would have made Sly Stone proud, and would eventually give way to other darkly funky songs like the second single &quot;My Friends&quot;, &quot;Shallow Be Thy Game&quot;, &quot;Transcending&quot; and &quot;Walkabout&quot;. Sad to say, the last three songs were not released as singles, probably because they would have required some extensive bleeping out of profanity (especially on &quot;Transcending&quot;). ONE HOT MINUTE also has some brighter ditties in the album's other hit single &quot;Aeroplane&quot; (a smile-inducing tune that is catchy as hell), &quot;Coffee Shop&quot; and &quot;Falling Into Grace&quot;. Unfortunately, the remaining songs just don't seem to measure up to the Chili Peppers' best work (or even that of BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIK). &quot;Deep Kick&quot; is a bit overlong, as is &quot;One Big Mob&quot; and the title track. &quot;Tearjerker&quot; just doesn't seem to be memorable enough, while I could go on for hours about the bad points for &quot;Pea&quot;. While the song is only 2 minutes, bassist Flea shows why he doesn't even come close to the vocal prowess of Anthony Kiedis. And the lyrics are atrocious, to put it gently. Guitarist John Frusciante has proven to have a somewhat fruitful solo career, but if Flea would ever do that some time, &quot;Pea&quot; is an example of the music he should NOT make. After the epic masterpiece that was BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIK, any album after that was doomed to be a disappointment, and it was. While it could easily be laid at Dave Navarro's feet, he's only part of the problem. ONE HOT MINUTE just didn't have that many good songs as BSSM, and even four years after that classic, the Chili Peppers were probably still a bit exhausted from all the hullaballoo. With ONE HOT MINUTE, Dave Navarro's position as a new Peppers guitarist was jeopardized, which probably explains why he left after the tour for this album to rejoin a reunited Jane's Addiction. John Frusciante would get sober and be welcomed back into the Chili Peppers fold for their artistic and commercial rebound CALIFORNICATION.d points for &quot;Pea&quot;.

0375704027|5.0|I am not very good at reviewing fiction but Norwegian wood was a beatiful touching story focussing on the interplay between few complex characters. The story takes place in Tokyo in 68 and following. It starts with the interaction between Watanabe (the main character) and his relation with Nakao (the girlfriend of his best friend who commited suicide).<br />The translator note at the end of the book states that this work is more like a  traditional novel, as opposed to &quot;cool, fragmented, American-flavored narratives&quot; that characterise his previous work. Not having yet read any other work from Murakami, I could not comment on that.
