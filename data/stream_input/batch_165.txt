B006MJMQ6E|1|Did not fit the car it said it did was for an older model
B0049HCOT0|2|It seemed to me to be a piece of plastic, more like a tarp than a rug. I wanted something that looked and felt more like a woven rug. I ended up retuning it.
B000C7S41I|3|It is a smaller tank it should fit ok except the fact that the plastic shroud that comes with the OEM tank will not fit so I will have to stop for fuel more often and have to coat the outside of the tank to help protect it from the tough New England winters. I will live with it since it is going on a back up vehicle.
B00A70CLZ0|5|Caps are working great so far.  Thanks.
B00THGWLVO|5|Works perfect and was a quarter of the cost compared to any where I looked. This means alot to a guy like me who has several old Harleys in the garage. Thanks again Amazon.
B00KTIVQEW|5|It works fine, but we had to have it programmed professionally. It cost us around $21. The dealership would have charged us $110 for one....quite a savings for us.
B00JJAS7DY|1|terrible - didn't fit my 2006 toyota matrix. really plastic, not the right size - also can't return it since it was sent from China
B00T2XJ3D6|5|Excellent Battery Manager
B007VDX4VG|4|OK
B00495UQT2|4|good
B003G0KA56|2|Finally got them installed. None of their holes lined up on my 2015 Ram. Not enough length  in my opinion for a 4x4 truck. Think I will try another brand for the fronts.
B002YIAC6I|5|worked great on my lawn mower handle
B004X5RJPC|3|normal
B001RKH7FS|3|It's ok
B006FD37OW|5|Very worth the price saved over $100 buying it on Amazon!
B00K3GBRQ2|4|Love them! But 1 seems to always burn out :/
B00540KPS8|5|Works well, especially with the composite bed .
B00M394FRA|5|Exact replacement oem part
B0006MRRU8|5|Very nice for the price.
B00UO1PI16|5|gooddddd
B00755B5GQ|4|Love it! Even got another for my father in law :)
B001QXRPUI|5|I have an Eames Lounge chair in white. This cleans and softens the leather perfectly..I will purchase again!,
B000GU3GH8|1|Does not match description
B000CFO0GI|5|Easy installation and they work great.
B003P9R1QE|1|This item DOES NOT fit a 05 V50. The taper pin is too big to fit in the suspension knuckle.
B00I4SRJ8G|5|Looks good feels good
B00B27SZEI|5|I gave it to family MD as a gift for his new Harley Free Wheeler.  He is disabled and a real trooper.  Livin the dream/
B000E7SXZI|4|Really great cargo system.  Like the setup, the lights, the adjustability.  Needs to have handles on the outside for carrying.
B00CH2MI04|3|This product's not very detailed and it was dented when I got it. I only got it for the picture, so when people get in my car people get the point. Smells great.
B000FW4LLW|5|Very nice wallet holder. Slim yet durable.
B0014477MU|5|Installed it on my mower so I can keep track of oil changes etc.
B0041QOIIO|4|Only replacement I could get, as helmet has been discontinued...
B00ANVMOYQ|1|This does not seal the fluid tank. I would get break fluid all over my exhaust each time I pressed the rear brake.
B0024ECHII|2|caution can cause step damage
B00E1SNH48|5|Smooth, quiet, plenty of stopping power, and keeps brake dust minimal.
B001C6NJOA|4|great tool for holding wire for soldering.
B00OYUZD2W|5|Fit perfectly.
B00FL2D2G6|3|Everything was great about this until I went to put it on. It goes on great until it starts to widen up because they didn't cut or grind down the metal were they welded the two pieces together. Gave it three stars because I didn't have the tools to do the amount of grinding it required. Other than that it look great.
B00W2XFFJ4|2|One window fell off
B000BNX0B2|5|Worked perfectly for my F450 Super Duty.
B005BNZHTA|5|Works as described ,,wish it was 4 to 6' long so connection was on the ground
B000CKR24U|1|It wasn't a direct replacement! It's length was much shorter and modifications were need to be made to the frame of the vehicle for it to fit.
B0006GF5SK|5|we've been using these a couple weeks now; pleasant smell ; no bad odors
B000CEP1V2|5|Works well, with good price.  Yes, it does comes with one instead of two output nozzles, but you really only needed one.  I'm not exactly sure what the other one is for, but I took my old one apart and only one nozzle was used to spray out.  Maybe the other one is like a drain? In case the line is plugged?  Plus, unless I want to run down the dealership and fork over money so I can buy a OEM pump that's 3 times the price, this one works just fine for my 2001 Pathfinder.
B002XM3AVY|5|perfect replace latch
B00LB0OX1A|4|This is a very good option if you need a rack that can hold any type of bike and it can be used to open the hatch as well with some additional steps. I brought this for a Honda Odyssey 2012. It attaches and has plenty of height for ground clearance. It's fairly easy to load with a little practice.<br /><br />It did not allow me just just open the hatch on a 2012 Odyssey. The hatch hit my first bikes handle bar even when fully extended out. I can just grab the handle of the bike and push it out of the way so I can get in but I can't just hit button I have to manually open and work it past the first bike. I even tried to push the first rack back a bit and it still doesn't clear without assistance. That being said the fact that it does allow me to do it at all is a nice benefit I was looking for.<br /><br />It is pretty heavy but it does come in pieces so while you have to have some strength to put in the main bar it's probably not any worse than any other 4 bike rack.<br /><br />The main hitch attachment is not tool free as others have said. You need a ratchet or wrench to put it on. The plus side is you can leave it on in most cases as it does come with hitch locks for both pieces (main and extension) so you only really need to remove it when you put it in the garage most likely and even then you might be able to leave it folded in the upright position but I wouldn't want to leave that huge metal bar on the back end if I didn't need to.<br /><br />I didn't have any issues with the telescoping part using the wax. It is a good solution I think.<br /><br />It's not very compact for storage. Even though you can take the bars off it's kind of a beast to find a place for. It's not bad just could be better.<br /><br />The design is really well thought out. The way it extends and folds up is really nice. It's nearly a prefect design really.<br /><br />The one I got came with broken end caps on all the bars. I contacted the company and they did replace them. The company seemslike a good one and that went into my decision to go with them. They have a few videos on you tube.<br /><br />You can not use just half the rack for 2 bikes. The main extension is one piece. You can only use 2 side bars instead of 4 which I did once but that doesn't make it any shorter and doesn't really save much weight. You can use just the far side which makes raising and lower the hatch a non-issue when you pull out the extension.<br /><br />One tip I have is you could get some quicker connecting bungie cords and then just connect the bikes to each other on the wheels to keep them from moving. That makes the loading faster than using the cords that come with it. I had some bungie cords with an adjustable length.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with the purchase. It's solidly built with a good design. It could use a few more inches of extension (not sure if that is even an option as it sticks out pretty far now). It could also use a tool free main trailer hitch connection but I don't think that's a big issue.
B0010DZZPG|5|Good for the price
B00V3N99GO|5|Purchased for my laptop (with matching Zelda Triforce Laptop bag!). Quality is superb and even stuck to the &#34;rubbery&#34; outer case of my lenovo laptop. It definitely turns heads.
B0013EM41K|5|This part wor ked excellent. It only took a few minutes to install. I am very satisfied.
B009103W8C|5|Good quality, works great, shipped on time

B00OS3O916|1|I have a 1994 ford f250 these harnesses did not fit in the taillight lens
B00B32DGNW|5|Took the sag right out of my truck when I pull my trailer, and at a fraction of the price of new leaf springs.
B004J2KBQS|5|Great replacement part just take out and put in... Save a lot of time.
B003Y7TEFI|5|Exactly what I wanted.  Solidly built.  I'd recommend it to anyone...
B00455TH3W|5|I Bought this kit to rebuild a carb on an old chainsaw that had sat around and dried up fit great solved problem of Getting to much gas.
B003FKTX4G|5|After watching the video I realized how easy it is for a thief to steal my trailers.  The price on Amazon was almost 65% lower than the large hardware store in town, so I bought one for each trailer.  The coomon key between receiver and tounge is a great convenience.  Note that the ends are a bit bulky, so please be sure that you have the enough clearance on your receiver.  I am going to the dealership to have a little bit more of my bumper removed.
B00E0RFSYW|3|Excellent product and great fit!  Only complaint is they are completely useless for the rear windows.  By nature of design which is really Hyundai's fault partially, even letting the rear window cracked 1/2 inch allows water in as the window guard drips the water directly into the vehicle.  For rain coming down sideways it is even worse.  Other than that, they are great!
B00K8DAPSG|5|Exact match for 7648 socket.
B00JOY6U7U|5|Good quality, better and that junk for half the price! You get what you pay for. Would buy again.
B00M3ENQXE|5|Works as described. Nice people to deal with.

B008UR7J6I|1|I couldn't get this to connect through the standard droid interface.
B003951OFI|4|I love them. But.... there are already starting to yellow and lift around the edges. I live in Washington state and have had drier than normal weather.
B00HHGRXA0|5|Perfect fit for my 2004 GMC Envoy. No noise and the bearings last.
B00DYAF9FY|5|Worked very well and also took away  most of the road noise. Over all very pleased.
B000C2SJNQ|5|I have had it on for about a month now on my FJ Cruiser.  Seems to be a quality product.
B003SEBYF0|5|Very Loud !!!! Nice horn to my Harley Sporty
B00NRX5LLA|5|I have a friend whose daughter has just turned 15 and a half, and you'd think the world has ended every time she has to turn the car off. The problem is she's a lot better driver in her own mind than she is behind the wheel. It's not that she's horrible, she just hasn't developed the skills to be a good driver yet. And that's where this flexible &#34;student driver&#34; magnet comes in. It lets everyone know that her skills haven't yet developed to the point that they can ignore her when she's driving near them. It's good for her safety and for theirs as well. As soon as we put this on her car, we noticed other drivers giving her plenty of room.<br /><br />I received this magnet at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.
B00D3D8LSO|5|Very nice material
B00GBVHPNW|4|small but good
B004LF4TFM|5|Fit perfectly and seem to be holding up to the sun and weedwacking just fine.
B0046IC24O|5|Worked perfectly with my 2004 Expedition. Easy programing instructions.
B0072PP86W|5|Cuddnt find where to ask question but will work for 2000 jetta vr6
B00N43Z6JU|5|Works great
B00QUTBGCG|5|Fits perfectly
B0007XTGCI|5|These work great! They do what they're supposed to do. They seem extremely solid and I trust them to hold my vehicles up when I'm under them. Definitely worth buying these instead of risking your life to save a few bucks.
B00KRXE948|4|Color looks even better in person
B004A2IFII|5|Good price and quick delivery.  OEM so no problems
B001EOYIH2|5|Got this hitch in three days. Very fast.<br />Installed on crown vic. with no problems. Drilled the holes and it fit perfect.<br />Well made and looks good. Plan on getting one for my truck next.<br />Some reviews said they had to move the exhaust pipes but it fit my car with dual pipes perfect.
B001DRJNHA|3|This item didn't fit on my kia sportage R 2012 Diesel
B000NKCM2Q|5|great  product  and quick shipping !
B00GV8840I|4|Wish I bought this 1st before I replaced the gear head
B001GF5J2W|5|Fits perfect and shields from the heat sooo  well.  We had 100+ degree heat , kept the inside of my car from roasting.  Great product, worth the money!
B001C9MR8G|5|Want a solid ride, a bit hard, tires are connected to the road, KYB is your shock, want a softer, luxurious ride, get KONI, Bilstein, Monroe, Rancho or the stock shock. There is a lot of difference from KYB and the rest. I found out the harder way after buying Bilstein for my 09 Tacoma 4WD that KYB is my shock. I have a full set of lightly used Bilsteins for you, just drop a note. They are good, but they are not my shock.
B004L04TD4|5|Solid, secure, well made. Made in the USA, won't blow over (i.e. Chinese made). Good product, good storage case, good price. My wife and I travel alot and have a set in both SUV's here in Colorado. Got rid of the ones made in China that blew over on the highway just when we most needed them! Have also used them with our retro travel trailer. Going to get additional sets for our 3 adult children.
B00P82RIZU|5|Perfect parts and perfect service
B0009IR0PQ|4|Used on a couch that was labeled S for cleaning (only dry cleaner solvent).  Did a nice job.
B00RCA2C3Y|5|It fits just  perfect!
B00B2E8GEA|5|Oh my new apple of my car.. It fits perfect and I love the feel in my hands.. Total luxury it is!
B009F10S3Y|2|It held up for the first week the. Came rocketing off when I hit the highway after a rain storm. I'm willing to try it again but I was disappointed this time around.
B00WHVT3NU|5|looks good on truck; installed both sides in a hour. directions only show right side only but once you do right side first left side is easy
B002G244UM|1|No good used once and fell apart!
B000VLC7X6|5|Worth the bucks. Works great.
B008KZKJ9O|5|Perfect fit.
B010FTSEB2|5|Fits well and does the job it’s supposed to do. Seems like it’s of decent quality.
B00PGH5SLS|5|fit my key perfectly for my 2016 mazda cx-5, this does not have a outline for the panic buttom but is not big deal because i never use the key fog anyways
B003POLA84|5|Works very well, I use it to prepare my Yellow Corvette for the complete compound and finish it up with poly wax.<br />The results is exceptional, but it's not just the clay that does that, it's all of it, and I only use Griot's Garage products.<br />I recommend it.
B0023V9PIM|5|Good Communications.  Great Product.  Quick Service.  Rated AAA+++.  Thank You.  BEG
B0045K2Q9Y|5|Great price on a fantastic array of fuses!  Note - these are mini fuses, not the micro (which are smaller) nor the ATO (or larger spade type)  So make sure you know what you are getting.
B00PTLBP4K|5|Love my car even more now! I've had it for about 7 months now and it looks brand new still.
B00KGNX54O|3|they fit fine. but I thought I was going to get raised white letters saying RAV4. but when they arrived the white lettering wasn't there. the lettering is why I bought this item in the first place. VERY disappointed
B00IMPEWHM|4|easy part  of the replacement
B00750OFKO|5|used on power wheels work well
B005SEJTYG|4|my boyfriend does my oil changes... and always gets this. I gues its good if he says so !
B00VNBDOV2|5|FYI: amazon states this does not fit my Lexus... it certainly does. My high beams take a 9005 bulb, the correct one here... so, I have used these guys on another car and they are fantastic!!! jighly recommended if you have projector beam headlamps
B000EQCV8E|5|nice on a 2005 avalanche... like new again...
B001EEUVZA|5|Works fine.  The long end link bolts could be a little bit longer, other than that, it appears to be a high quality part and pretty easy to install.
B00G620ZVU|5|They sure are bright!
B00BVL7W1C|3|They get the job done but they do tend to slip off sometimes. I put a gauge in one of my wheels...
B00CQNY8PM|2|It was ok
B000BQSW4E|5|Works great on shower doors
B0016GRTVU|5|Great!
B00Q344V2U|1|I have a Honda Civic and this is waaaay too big for my steering wheel. I tried to give it to my mom for her car but it was too small for hers.<br />Also has a very strong odor like fresh tires and leaves your hands smelling funny
B00GWFCHLM|4|The base is great! Well Built.  I would've given it five stars but the strap basin with it is useless. Plan on buying a small ratchet strap at your local hardware store. I did find it amusing there was a sticker that said do not use near flammable liquid.
B00JRHI1LM|5|I love this mattress...great quality & extremely comfortable.
B001FAGLAM|5|Fit my 2003 Ford Ranger
B009S9RURU|5|Can't go wrong with this one. We are the envy of the newborn club.
B003NHH6LI|5|Great, installed, and gave  extra business cards to friends who have Dodges, and trucks)<br />also, thanks for correcting me on my order.
B006924HIE|5|Perfect
B0009JKI5Y|5|Works Wonders<br /><br />Pros:<br />-cheap<br />-easy install and great fit<br />-wipes the rain away<br /><br />Cons:<br />-only comes in black<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />-For less than $7 it was a great replacement for the stock Toyota wipers.  I own a Sienna Mini-Van so the rear wipers do not get a lot of use but it works well when needed.
B00KTHXYO8|5|Have needed a new remote shell for several years.  Originally could not find any after market shells back then so just made do.  This case works and looks the original.
B001TI5IIQ|3|Kind of a rip off if you ask me. I bought this product 8-years ago and loved it. I used it multiple times on different family vehicles over the years (including refinishing a plastic sunroof) and I loved the value I got from Turtle Wax Headlight Restorer. So recently I was dealing with a couple of fuzzy headlights in the family and thought I'd purchase another kit from Turtle Wax. Well, now you only get 2 sanding pads.Before I got 4-oad and both sides of each pad with ether more of the same grit or a different grit. But you do get a half-cent worth of plastic gloves. I'm am unimpressed. Yes, it works, but you will no longer be taking care of a couple of family vehicles. Instead you will do one vehicle or maybe two if your lucky and do them at the same time. I'll be trying another brand of headlight restorer next time. I prefer value with my automotive products.
B003VLBPJA|1|BEWARE - Item not as pictured.  The Net I received has small METAL hooks with plastic tips, NOT  &#34;Six 2-1/2&#34; ABS hooks, rust-proof, non-scratch; easy to remove & re-attach for best fit&#34; as described by Amazon.
B00LUU8A2Y|1|Product is bright enough.  too bright.  could use a dimming process.  It burns very hot for an LED light.  you will burn your hand if you touch the lens after leaving the light on for a few minutes.
B000CID052|5|Perfect fit on time great product
B007PJ774G|5|This is a great setup. I leave my clear off when using locally. Plug holes with 5/8 th furniture caps and use 1/2 inch O rings on the inside for even cooler look and keeps plugs from rattling. Cycleshields was excellent with a problem from shipping. Highly recomend!!! Thanks.
B00AOYX3S8|5|great price for an OEM pump.
B00PE5DXLY|5|Love it!!!
B00H1KTXH8|5|My husband did this for me and it looked like he had no troubles at all! Few tiny bubbles but nothing that I can't stand and I'm pretty picky. The tint was perfect for me.
B0010DXYJA|5|Well made and fit perfectly. I bought an off brand Chinese filter first and learned my lesson.
B00HTOB0NG|3|These seem to work only at night because during the day, my drl still flicker sometimes with these installed. Would definitely like to not have flickering hids during the day because sometimes I forget to turn the lights off while driving during the day and had people tell me my lights are flickering.
B000JSPC42|2|Wrong information about this product fitting my car was posted on website. It was meant for old model Honda and I have a Lexus SUV.<br />No problems with the exchange, received free postage to send it back and I was credited for the item, so that was good.<br />It was just a hassle. Put up the correct info already!
B00063XX5U|5|No instructions with this tool but after messing one band, the rest were perfect.
B007Q8LV98|5|Pretty cool jacket and unbeatable price I l love it ,thanks!!!
B00M8P2BFW|5|Outstanding !!!!!! I agree with one of the other reviews , buy some permatex.....This is a QUALITY head and cam folks !!!
B000NWJJLG|3|It does work great in heavy rain, but in light rain or mist it actually makes it very hard to see as it causes a pretty severe glare.
B00DO7N9Q8|5|These are awesome OEM floormats. The fact that they are solidly attached to the car means that they don't need to be removed for autocrosses or track days, which is an extra bonus.
B001UG4WIO|5|Good quality. Product came in excellent packaging and detailed instructions.
B00UF62U6Q|5|worked great, best price on the web.
B00WAVM3X4|5|Once my mom sent me a snap chat showing me it came in the mail I was super excited! I rushed home and saw it and it was even better in person! I absolutely love it and they did a good job!
B004G9VIXE|5|Part fit and worked great.
B00TQ07IOQ|4|very nice.  2 problems(small)  The spikes on the bottom are not that .... spikey? They dont grind into the floor very well.  Amazon says they fit my vehicle but alas they perfectly...
B00ALPW926|5|Fit perfect.  Sold the car not long afterwards and was glad to not have the mirror be a problem.
B000SZI24S|5|ok
B000MILXCY|5|They work well for my aplication.
B00G2TV7OG|5|Very bright
B009FPQIIY|2|not what I was looking for, but not bad enough to return it.
B001OCVAOS|5|Had to super glue the bolt incerts so they don't spin on my 2014 ram. The hex is off and is too small. You have tighten them so you crush the back part, kind of like a rivet. Directions don't tell you that. Confused on this one. Call the company, and there around $390. Tell them there $140 cheaper on Amazon, she said it is better to buy from Amazon??? Okayyyy......
B000FOY5E8|5|This kit was totally worth the money I spent on it.  They thought of EVERYTHING!  No trips to the hardware store, I had everything I needed to get the job done on a 20 year old trailer!
B00823FSRC|4|Works great
B00W10XV5I|5|Excellent product! Thick steel, painted well. I'm very pleased. The American flag looks so damn sexy!
B00XMT9534|5|Great seller and these lights are crazy bright for the money. I have four of them on my Jeep and they light it up.
B004EKM68G|5|The carpet truly met my expectations. It came on time and has improved the look of my car.
B00030DLEE|5|Exelente
B000772HVQ|5|My dad loved it!
B001F5I614|5|great mats very fast shipping!
B000IY3K46|5|as expected
B002MB594M|4|worth the money
B00NEESARY|5|Fit & finish just like the factory.
B00Q3MRHUU|5|I put a LOT of miles on my car each week for work. So I did the adult thing and bought a work car. My work car is a Chrysler and it’s a nice car in an “I’m a grown-up with a job” way. It gets great gas mileage, fast to heat up in the winter, fast to cool down in the summer, tons of comfortable amenities for passengers, it has real glass for the windows, etc… It’s grown-up, practical for me, and nice &#60;yawn&#62;. I also have sons in the late-teens early-twenties age range (stay with me) who have social lives, adventures to go on, college expenses, and no money. My sons took one look at my car when I brought it home, cringed, and continued to &#60;gasp&#62; work to make gas money so they could drive their own (cooler) cars. Then, one fateful day, one of them was desperate for something or other and actually got in my car and discovered that my mom-car has an epically upgraded sound system. In direct contradiction to the agreement attached to the bribe money I paid him, he told his brothers and an intense competition ensued on which of them could bring mom’s car home with the least amount of gas at the most inconvenient time the most often. I engaged in a counter attack and proceeded to deck my mom-car out with every pink princess-themed thing I could find. Princess stickers, princess window decals, tiaras lining the rear deck, etc.. Apparently princess d&eacute;cor trumps amazing speakers and my car was once again free of McDonalds bags and burrito wrappers. I was given the opportunity to receive an Oxford Zebra Tiger stripe license plate frame at a discounted cost for evaluation and review, thought “sweet!” and ordered it. Package came, put it on my car (easy!) and admired how great it looks, how well it is made, and how much it improves the appearance of my car: I love it! Except … yesterday my son (the bribed one!) was walking past my car, stopped and looked for a second, said “I like that”. I’m not sure I want my car to be cool again and this Oxford License Plate Frame has increased my mom-car’s coolness quotient.s Oxford License Plate Frame has increased my mom-car’s coolness quotient.
B00XHPJH86|5|Looks good. Good seller
B000BZZT9G|5|Fit perfect, looks like good quality.
B0093E8SRG|5|Had the dreaded shifter boot popping up problem on the '98 Wrangler (TJ), this cured it.
B003E01STU|4|I like the reinforced toe area, I imagine it's for shifting. Haven't had to use them yet, so can't give a 5 star not knowing how they'll do. Guess I'll find out next week!
B00418U0AM|5|Item arrived in great condition.<br />Happy to have Mickey peeking out from my car.
B000IY65CA|5|Fit perfect, looks like good quality.
B000EH4UXM|4|Works great on coolant bottles. The long plastic drain tube eliminates spills. Didn't fit my Toyota transmission fluid bottles though.
B005DZJA30|5|this worked well watched a u tube video to see how to attach without putting holes in the front of the challenger, thank you.
B00032KBFE|5|I love these locking screws. They're heavy duty and because they require a special hex key the likelihood of plates getting stolen are greatly reduced.
B000AMZK2G|3|I am not sure if these filters are made in the US anymore so I will probably buy WIX next time but for now, I believe this is the stock filter and direct replacement for my 2000 Chevy S10 4.3
B007M2Y1FE|2|Returned not worth the money
B00MQAFYVW|5|Perfect fit
B00BPZHFGQ|5|nice quality
B00032KBFE|5|As advertised.
B00CMMV49A|5|Very comfortable helmet!
B00T47K604|3|I honestly don't know what to rate this at.  We bought two of them and they don't work for our make and model of car.  2010 Nissan Armada.  I'm sure they work great for other cars just not ours.  And they came from China so there is no returning them.  We ended up buying two premium rigid 9.5 in rear seat belt extenders and they work great for our make and model of car.
B0023VH5NO|4|Product was exactly as described and a perfect fit.
B000GPT3O8|5|Good fit. Worked perfectly on my 1982 S-10.
B000LV7XR6|4|Easiest wipers I've ever installed.  Recommend.
B00AZ8HXS4|5|Great gloves awesome price
B000E7SY16|5|Bought this set because I need two of the red ones and it was cheaper to buy this set than any set Target or a hardware store sold. I recommend it , better to have a bunch of extras than over spend on two.
B007Y4YYJI|5|Great quality.
B00IF9JEBE|5|quick shipment, perfect item
B00EU26MV0|5|Perfect fit, works great.
B001F7729E|5|Fit perfectly into a 2004 Volvo v70 T5. Removing the old sensor was easy with the proper O2 sensor socket. The connection, on the other hand, was buried deep in this car. Denso provides ant-seize compound that I put on the threads. I also disconnected my battery for 15 minutes and then started it up, and the difference was soon noticeable; smoother running engine, no more gas smell from the exhaust, gas mileage went from 18.5 to 25.1 MPG! Engine is more responsive at all speeds. Volvo calls for O2 sensor replacement at 100k miles, but it will lose efficiency and gas mileage before then. My car had 170k miles on it at replacement. Denso had the best price and it works great. If Amazon had a Denso downstream O2 sensor, I would buy it. But since they didn't I went with a different brand.
B006RUG9XO|4|works great
B001B0VCBE|3|This isa well-made brush. It can be used for many purposes I find it most useful to clean the honeycomb grille on my 2015 Toyota Camry SE. However the brush is a little too big for detailing wheels. You cannot clean around the lug nuts with this brush.
B006Q3JI44|5|A+++++++
B00EN7JPIO|5|works as expected! was a little challenge to get it working, but thank god for Skype because I was hitting up China like there is no tomorrow! Although they walked me through and was very supportive to get the tool going!
B00ULR7E5G|5|Great part, moves license plate down so it looks much much better.
B000C1MW6M|5|35 years plus as a DIY'r doing my own brakes and have never had a better set of pads. These will go on every car we own. I was amazed at the pedal grab and distance to stop the first time I pressed them down.
B005EB6VC6|5|Great price!
B0039001TI|5|live out on a pond far from evry store. ordered this and received  this a day later. now, that's convenience! this is also a high end quality  product for my boat..
B007X65U9U|5|Worked great
B00A89IYHY|5|makes vehicle look even more classy--15 min to install
B0015D4ZH0|5|A+++++++++
B008S9LG3U|5|great quality, better than any competitive brand that I have tried.  solid build and perfect fittment to their other accessories.
B00DHVNXQM|5|Good quality great customer expeience. Highly recomend them
B002J7O7TC|5|These microfiber cloths are just the right size for cleaning laptop, tablet and smartphone screens.  They do a very effective job of cleaning fingerprints, etc. They are washable as well, and will last a long time.  Highly recommend.
B001OBCZRK|1|Came with a significant portion of the metal ground off. No quality control.
B00ERXG4TM|5|Work good on my daughter 250 ninja
B009DJQAEY|5|Great deal, thanks
B0015RQ77W|5|Works as described. No issues.
B000XBGTAQ|4|just ordered for back ups but these are quality spark plugs have used them for years
B000I1M7GG|4|Sweet
B008G2CR1Y|5|Great purchase!
B000CLSOY6|5|Works as it should.
B000C0YMUM|5|Great belt. Easy to install no slack or extra tension afterwards.
B004VR08IW|5|Looks great, fairly easy to install
B00D9C2CDO|4|Nice.
B00C5T1NIW|2|Ordered the correct model for truck and the product would not recognize my key.  On the positive side it was returned and I was refunded money without a problem.  I also ordered a lock for my trailer hitch at the same exact time and this has been working out fine.
B00MRHKG3A|5|Is this gonna fit a 09 Honda civic
B00XLKDRP6|5|Contacted Paul at Safaripal about the grille since I was unable to find installation instructions on the Amazon website at the time.  Paul sent me a link to a video showing the ease of putting the grille on our 2015 Jeep Wrangler.  Upon seeing the video the decision to purchase was a &#34;no brainer&#34;.  It took less than 15 minutes to put the unit on and it looks great.  It cost a few $$s more than comparably designed grills, but the ease of the installation and the results made it worth the little extra investment.
B00K1C1WC2|5|Perfect for my need to help stabilize our 5th wheel trailer
B000M8U6RM|5|works just as advertised
B00G4RVKL6|1|Advertised as the 2004/civic gray, however it isn't, it is too dark
B003EOVLGG|5|Just installed on my F150 (2010)- two bolts/washer/screw.  That's it.  Ten minutes to install.  Getting the tools out took the most time.  The light bar is very firm.  I weigh 400+ pounds and not even a flex, just a dip in the suspension.  Adjustment required simply installing to the lowest possible position in the existing holes in the bumper.  I will be installing 7 inch LEDs when they arrive.  To those bad comments listed- the customer must of received a bad product- I would hope they got it replaced.
B004A675IA|4|My 04 Dodge Ram 2500 definitely needed this.  Much tighter steering and installation was easy.  Like another reviewer stated, it would be better if the shaft was secured like the OEM, but it doesn't seem like it is totally necessary.  Time will tell.
B00407RRGY|5|It matched our 2003 Highlander Toyota wheels perfectly.<br /><br />Highly recommend!
B00IS93FK2|5|Great fit
B004ZF39T0|5|Didn't work on my car without a relay. caused a BUS code to show up. But after relay was installed they worked great
B001ABMU7E|5|Great. Product. Works as advertised
B00KTNBH7I|2|Product is nice. Well made, but the install instructions are horrible. To this day it is sitting in my garage, waiting for me to have some time...so i can interpret the horrible drawings and install this. Unless the instructions are improved, this is not a DIY product..you'll have to rely on a professional installer or the dealership to get it in.
B00VB2OE9O|4|I gave this a 4 because it's a good cover for the price but doesn't fit like a glove. But it covers my car good enough for me. I have a TC scion.
B000FKKOK6|5|Great for the price - changed the meep meep little OEM horn on my wife's mazda CX-5 into something that was at least respectable and to be heard.
B00WE68FM8|5|Just as described! I have music again
B00SZMFR5I|5|Great quality.  It went on clean and simple.  I wish it also said ...and whoever is playing the Patriots &#34;and Cowboys&#34;.  I might have to get that part to add it on.<br /><br />I have received several compliments on it.
B001AM5QBK|5|Same review for Gabriel 77403 Max Control Shocks.
B00PY0FIBW|5|Purchased these for my wrangler. Great quality and great comfort.
B00KCAI18G|5|I am using this on my Subaru (BOXER engine). Very sturdy. I would recommend black screw covers with this so it blends in better.
B003CJCHGQ|5|fast shipping...all good :)
B0052K5XE6|5|Very good product with functionality as described
B00002N57X|5|works well....easy instructions..time will tell as to quality
B0015S855I|5|Perfect fit for my motorhome
B00EP6R9E0|5|Looks good on my ram
B005KQHQ38|5|FAST SHIPPING. NICE BAR COVER,FIT LIKE A GLOVE.  THANK YOU
B00K72C1T4|5|This review is for the standard version, which I bought to charge and maintain the battery on my generator.<br /><br />It recharged the dead battery in under 12 hours and, so far, has maintained the charge. The option to 'permanently' attach the charger to the battery is a plus, since I don't have to worry about the clips being accidentally jarred out of place and finding a dead battery when I really need to start my generator. Worth noting is that the coupling is not exactly as pictured--it, in fact, include rubberized seals to keep water out when the cable is disconnected, which I imagine will be helpful if I have to move the generator outside during a storm.<br /><br />Overall, this is very easy to use. It took no time at all to connect it to the battery and once that was done it was 'set it and forget it.'
B00PFFG1EO|4|I only wish I did not have to turn it on at the button.
B000KYY43U|1|Can't get it to program and the screw doesn't fit to keep it together.
B00PIJ96US|5|got one for my daughters, they love it.
B0066QUA84|2|Stop working after two months had to then get dealer part
B00AC8AL5O|5|Worked great.
B002R0KY34|5|I was pleasantly surprised to find that this item came not only as described but better.  It had new bulbs as well as the complete wiring harness already installed.  Great buy!
B00V5JVN38|5|Very good for the price
B00XQQAODS|4|Just what I needed
B006CT2URE|5|Wired right up to factory harness.
B001QT9KO6|5|Packs a punch in such a small bottle. It really really does work! Sealed my rad and heater core at the same time!
B001FCR6VI|4|Other than the information on how to install them the worked out good if y'all can send me that It would be appreciated
B000E3BX3G|5|Gave my 99 f150 a smoother ride .
B001O31UJ2|1|didnt fit the tube nozzle
B007IVT7E4|5|Perfect fit and works great!
B00ECWF96M|4|Fit was not exact but with a little modification it worked out.
B00JF5T7C8|1|Cheap plastic that slips over a lighter.

B00HAIGJF0|5|ty
B004A2IFII|1|Good product.
B0016LG2G8|4|Environmentally friendly, that's what I care most about.
B008BLFHS0|5|It was cheap and it worked great!
B000DZTZRG|1|The  product was not the same product as seen in the PICTURE....!<br /> This representation  Is not the way it should have been...!
B00BD6OT0C|5|For my muslim friends
B00LVQ0RAA|1|No instructions
B0066SZ6H2|5|perfect replacement made of silicone hopefully last longer than oem
B00A2XD7RI|5|I had one of these for my wife's car and I had been looking everywhere for another one when I found this on Amazon (I should have known to look there first). It is a heavy weight product that looks like it will be durable (I use it inside my garage to stop my car). I'm very pleased with this item and with the price I paid for it.
B00B36CFLM|5|It was great I love the product
B000C36BJO|5|Great belt, fawesome price!
B00FO9WKGE|5|This seat belt extender has been a literal neck saver!  My truck's seat belt harness is NOTORIOUS for cutting into my neck, it's annoying, it's distracting, it's painful after awhile and it's nearly cost me a couple of accidents.  I thought seat belts are supposed to be HELPFUL, not potentially distract the driver to the point of an accident!  I've been battling this for too many years, finally a friend saw the problem and suggested this extender.<br /><br />It snaps right in and works EXACTLY as intended which is perfect for my needs.  My husband likes it because it's easier for him to find the seat belt clasp.  5 stars, highly recommend!
B004I12MXK|5|Fit perfectly, did have to use the spring clips from old taillight. Looks identical to factory piece but $90 cheaper.
B00RGO6QGK|1|These letters were not actually black. They are more of a charcoal grey/pewter color.
B00LCBJF0W|5|these are great.  I Installed on two of my dodges and the hood now seems to open its self.  no more propping the hood up with a stick
B007CISU6Y|5|Installed on stock 2011 Wrangler Unlimited with Goodyear duratrac 285/70 17's with Quadratec black Moab wheels. No rubs anywhere and good for moderate offroad as well as retaining excellent daily driver qualities. Perfect!
B00KT1F7SU|5|Very good
B00JA390RW|4|I really like these wiper blades.  They have a strong contact as the coating it leaves works very well (to the point that you could honestly drive in moderate rain without the wipers on).<br /><br />Pros:<br />Coating is great<br />Strong contact<br /><br />Cons:<br />Streak sometimes<br />Must be used on a very wet windshield or they leave behind a heavy streaking
B005RJ3GBE|3|I ran into two issues with this purchase. 1) the original key does not fit properly so the spring will not flip the key up. 2) there is no housing for the security chip to be placed in. Other than those two issues it was a great buy. Key ring hasn't broken off yet, great price and arrived on time
B003VAWMFC|3|The product was of good quality but did not fit very well with the hooks and cords. Modified using more bungee cords.  Seemed to be missing holes 8n bottom to tie it down. Fabric is very good.
B00IDHJZXU|5|Excellent product and seller
B00F5MU5YY|5|It was everything the description said. Easy installation,  looks good,  pause button is awesome, and certainly helped increase the water pressure for a great RV shower experience.
B00UCG6YJ8|5|My wife loves this for her new car said she is getting a lot of looks and laughs.
B003UT3S6Q|5|Product is amazing I have a bottle in each of my cars.
B00BCRMBGQ|1|I hate the smell
B00OZQ3S5Y|5|I liked very much the look it has given my vehicle. Vehicle looks  alitte more elegant
B008JORKP2|3|We purchased this fire pit in 2013.<br /><br />It is very small, sold it in garage sale for 40.00.z<br /><br />The home we live in has a nice paver circle in the yard.  This fire pit was to small for our needs.<br /><br />We decided to purchase a wood burning fire pit at Lowe's for $99.00.  We love the new one.
B002VVIQLQ|1|First off, the plugs were delivered on time. No issue with that. I bought this spark plug set for my 2004 Ford F-150.  It's a one piece plug that is supposed to resolve, or at least help the problem with removing broken plugs that result from being so deep and hard to get to On this motor. They were properly installed. The recommended anti seize was used . 1 month after having the plugs changed, one of them broke. Number 8 on my 5.4 motor, back of the motor. The plug could not removed without removing the motor. $1500 later and a set of OEM Motorcraft plugs, my truck is almost ready to go again. I do not recommend these plugs. Expensive lesson learned.
B00XNZJL2C|1|INSIDE THE BOX NO PRODUCTS PIERBURG
B00IOTWX54|5|I read reviews before purchasing so I was prepared to deal with a mounting hole being off a little.  A Dremmel and a file and a few minutes was all it took.  The hitch is otherwise wel made and has a good finish on it.  Plan on using a lift if you can.  Got it up on the lift, removed BOTH rear tires and access to the plastic retainers holding the plastic wheel wells was a snap.  Satisfied with this hitch and installation.
B005ZZH7U6|5|These liners are GREAT! they fit perfectly on my 2010 Tacoma and they look very sharp
B00WSO1XXO|5|Perfect
B007Y59CYY|3|Although the description said it was custom for my specific vehicle, it doesn't q<br />quite fit.
B00DW8A7YQ|5|Starter arrived on time and fits my motor.. so far so good
B003E2USLM|5|Worked as stated. Well built.
B000C9OWJ4|5|Pretty standard belt and exact replacement for a 5.4L 3v v8 on my 2007 Ford Expedition EL Limited.<br />Got rid of belt noise caused by stretched belt after 89,000 miles
B0066TIDZS|5|I'm very satisfied with this product it fit perfectly thanks
B009DJJAB4|3|Cons: Very fragile, clumsy fit, cheaply made.<br />Pros: Inexpensive, nice and bright, look good.
B001GJ3E2K|3|works well
B00LUS7L76|5|So far, so good...
B006UH65RE|2|Had a flaw, yet I had to pay for postage to and from. Tech made it sound complicated to hook up, yet four wires only. Come on, I'll get a different brand next order.
B00TYUCPXW|5|These remotes have to be programmed at the dealer for a cost of $70.00, but if you buy them from the dealer, expect to spend around $120.00 a piece, plus around $30.00 for the keys each.  Saved a lot of money and everything works perfect!
B000MD4YKM|2|Have not been able to get it to work properly.
B001QV6K6A|5|Looks great arrived quick, gotta love Prime!
B00HJDUNWQ|5|great
B0009IK5SK|5|What can I say? It's a wiper blade, the price is right, it got here quickly and it's doing a fine job of keeping my back window clear. It's a great option for me on this unusual size of wiper blade that is impossible to find at the store.
B000BGHYE8|5|Works as it should!
B00CXAC5MG|5|Real good deal
B00OZUTJ7G|1|These mats are decent quality, but one of the rear mats was a little too wide and did not fit right between the seat mounts and would not lay flat on the floor. I'm giving them a 1 star because of that, and the fact that Lloyd has ZERO customer service on an issue like this.  I tried contacting Lloyd 3 times (via email) to see if they would send me a replacement mat (not the whole set) and I NEVER heard anything back from them.  They DO NOT even have a phone number you can call to speak to anybody about a problem - and they don't seem to respond to emails.  Any response would have been better than none.  They have the worse customer service I've ever encountered!
B00Y45TN4G|4|Use this for the front park and DRL/turn signals bulb. Had to clip off one tang on plastic ring to make it fit a 98 Trans AM. I knew it wasn't correct but I am glad I could fit it anyway. Use LED bulbs
B005ETVN44|5|Looks like a well  made part with a metal impeller and gasket included
B005HYONBQ|5|Everything fit perfectly. And it was fast service. I love dealing with this company. Thank you very much for good service.
B00029WYEY|5|If you follow the instructions, it works as directed.  I used this on a K&N filter on another car and never had any issues.
B006H7NDV8|4|Fits ok.  However the motor was running backwards and had to rewire it so it would run the same as the other three windows.
B00T9U4UNK|5|Best helmet if bought price is great.
B00MAO6AB2|5|for the money the rack cant be beat!
B00IJDW3C8|5|Nice product - makes riding in it much more comfortable
B000CN95V0|5|Fits correctly.  No problems.
B000W3RU9Y|3|nicely made
B00ZDZIGNK|3|Lights do not fit the truck like factory units I have to use spacers and new screws to adjust right, once you get them in good they do work great and look good. I had a different set that the brake lights failed in that fit better so lets hope these outlast them.
B00KN0UOEE|5|Great product for vehicle vinals and tires.
B00L4GHCYG|1|Fell off in 2 days. 65 bucks down the drain
B00S06ACGI|5|excellent and timely...thanks!!!
B0048FB912|4|Great fit!
B00M8BKU5Y|5|Great product. but slightly on the expensive side.
B001Q4QO2C|5|Works wonderfully!
B005C0FC1K|5|Best clamps for whatever application you are using them on.  They don't strip out when you crank them down.<br />Like em. No leaks.
B001C5O9P4|4|Very nice. Couldn't give 5 stars because they do hide a touch of perifable sight. But they're quality and I have no problem with vision. Use my mirrors anyway and always give way when on my bike. Would buy again. Comfortable and fit over my round glasses. Doesn't fog.
B00GZKC36S|5|Great oil at a great price.
B00BVB7NCA|5|Good thank you
B00K1C1WC2|5|Light weight, no splinters, easy to see.
B0050VONTS|5|Exactly what I needed
B007PVIARW|5|This thing is great! I pop it out and rinse it off.
B00QC28LSI|4|Got the LEDs in today. Took about 25 mins to replace all ten lights on my Prius.<br />No problem at all. Just wish it comes with some kind of tool to pop the light covers off.
B001R5ORBK|5|First shipment came in damaged, second shipment came in perfect, still holding up.
B00K8VQE7Y|5|Awesome!
B00QMWQQBW|5|Fit my Caliber perfectly and gave it a bit of colour that it was lacking on the inside! Highly recommend this.
B00A14QNP6|5|No issues with this product. Fits perfect and took less than 2 minutes to change
B00L7NY6O0|5|good fit
B00OB8EEN6|1|arrived with the top clear layer full of wrinkles. did not go on well
B001NZ4P2U|3|Threaded portion too long. Once the joint is seated, the castle nut is tighten to spec. Unfortunately the castle nut slots are well below the cotter pin hole, and do not line up.  To use, I took the nut off and put a flat washer and then a lock washer on.  Then you can put the nut and cotter pin on.
B002IXFC9G|5|looking for something different and l found these they are great
B001462JHG|1|Advertised as am &#34;emblem&#34;, turned out to be stick on vinyl decal. Not what I wanted.
B001Y8XWAW|5|It's beatiful
B0042OYYZM|5|perfect fit
B00U136C5S|5|Fits well and does the job of protecting the key fob.
B00G4ATR54|5|Very sturdy. Easy to assemble and adjust. Hauled 4 beach cruiser bikes OH to Hilton Head Island and back. Performed flawless.
B0006IX7YC|5|The end piece is missing from the hose so how is this tool supposed to clean anything? UPDATE: Amazon took care of this problem very quickly by sending me a replacement which works like it's supposed to. For all of you who use chemicals to clean your probes and dissolve the waste don't waste your money and use this instead. It get rid of everything instantly leaving behind a very clean tank.
B00E9HCPM6|5|Well fit.
B0000AXRH5|4|A good funnel to have.
B009ZGAG18|5|great
B001BB1GQ4|5|Works as expected.  I've also used the NOS racing octane booster and this product gives the same results.
B00HE7SJ7S|5|Very Pleased with Aaron 6000K Pure White 60W's Changed to whole look of my truck Thank You
B00IAN4MW6|4|This was not a perfect fit but that may have been partially due to my Hyundai having some sort of coating on the frame.  It's like the spray on rubber coating that's only like 1/8th an inch thick but it makes it so the top holes do not line up perfect.  In fact the bolts would not go all the way thru.  But I'm a garage mechanic so it was nothing a rubber mallet couldn't fix.  I just pound the bolts thru and tightened then down...no worries.  I'll tell you this, that thing is not coming out of there.  I did have to adjust the spare but that was just loosening it and scooting it back like an inch.  But the rear bumper cover even went back on and cover the receiver!  Very sturdy.
B00515NHCM|5|Good!
B001QSZ820|4|looks great, a little hard to put on. that's why its not a 5 rate
B00DSD4H0A|5|Cute!
B000BZXSE4|5|Round and flat exactly where it needs to be
B000C2SJ0Y|4|Gates is a time honored name in the auto parts world & I was pleased to find this part for an older model Mini Cooper. The 12 month guarantee is great & only time will tell how well it performs.
B0030G7Y64|4|This saved my life (more specifically my Brest milk) while driving from California to Maryland. There were a few bags that melted, but overall it it awesome!
B00M39J8JU|4|Decent
B00IDHUQWY|5|Very happy i bought this, made a tricky job turn out to be worry-free, well worth it!!
B00II5YE56|5|GREAT.
B00BCRMBGQ|1|Extremely bad, matreial very bad and not at sturdy
B001MXL71A|3|Pumps tires relatively fast as expected, but the valve stem clamping device doesn't hold tightly.
B005NLQAHS|5|Great diagnostic tool to determine error codes and how well your car is running.  Works well in conjunction with a bluetooth application on your smart phone.  I found that an OBDII app like Torque (I have the paid version) is great for getting real time info.  You can also do 0 to 60 times with this device and Torque!  I know with the app I can also clear any error codes, which is nice prior to emissions testing.  Of course as long as you've figured what was wrong.<br /><br />What's invaluable with this reader is the ability to check for the emissions diagnostic readiness checks with an app.  Save yourself time from going to the emissions test only to find out that you can't test because one of the emissions systems is not ready.  Good product, it saved me from wasting a trip to the emissions test station when my car wasn't ready to be tested.
B000A0CAWQ|5|Fit well and good quality!
B00HS0H4O0|5|Good product
B004FOXJZU|5|3 years later, still works, not the best looking (I actually removed the plastic ring and just left it bare) but works just as well as more expensive options.
B00PHQDLA8|5|I've been collecting props and prop replicas from the Marvel Cinematic Universe to display in my basement with my DVD and figure collection.<br /><br />This license plate is an AWESOME addition to the collection.  It's a spot on replica of the plate on the Audi RS8 at the end of &#34;Age of Ultron.&#34;<br /><br />I'll be just hanging this on my wall, but it's built to be able to be put on the front of your car...it's really just a real license plate, with mounting holes and everything.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this Stark plate.  It's great.
B00H2Q93G2|5|They areally wonderful and true!!!!!
B0053OINA2|4|Great mirrors, they fit my mini bike nicely
B00FS9XEO2|5|all good
B002SB03IS|5|I have had this for one year and love it.
B00S77O7ZC|5|Looks good on the window. Go Bucks!
B00GHP4RDS|5|good solid cans with a reliable seal on the cap
B00TSN4P4C|5|Awesome, love it.
B00RJUZY9Q|5|good
B00W2N8MH6|5|This is just what I ordered. And it does the trick.
B00UO6BN7E|4|Great deal on a nice, well made jacket!
B004W5SGBO|1|Very disappointing product. The lid does not come close to fitting, and will not stay on. I have another noco box on my boat and bought this one for a spare battery. The other one is perfect, so I don't put the blame on noco but on Amazon instead. The one they shipped me appears to be a &#34;repack&#34; and probably has been returned to Amazon a few times. It didn't even include the spacer plates for different size batteries. Sad when a company like Amazon reships a faulty product, instead of returning it to the manufacture.
B009ATWLZO|5|Fit my truck like a glove, love it!
B00776LMI4|5|Works well.
B000NW4O7K|5|I have encounter issues with my radiator fan. they stopped working so i decided to replace both. this is the OEM part. I bought it to avoid any amps variation so i don't burn my car's electrical circuits. it worked perfectly.
B005ZIBWSG|5|I am not sure why this is is getting many bad reviews, but I thought I'd give my input. I purchased the 15&#34; for my 2007 Ford Focus SE last summer (August 2014). They installed without a problem, and fit quite snugly. I love the look of them, and have received many compliments.<br /><br />As far as product reliability goes, I am originally from New Hampshire, and I attend college in Alabama. I drove my Focus from NH to AL in August 2014, drove around while in school (going to places like Atlanta, GA or Mobile, AL or Mississippi), and I drove home from AL to NH. The hubcaps are tight as ever, and I don't worry about them falling off.<br /><br />In my opinion, these are worth your money.
B000BZI4ZW|5|OEM,and lots cheaper than the dealership
B00ANWBESC|3|Well, I can still clearly see the crack.  However, so far the crack has not spread which is good.  I think I needed to leave this up to the professionals.
B00TYZL8JO|5|Works as advertised ... does a good job of reflecting the sun (and heat) from inside the car.
B00VCRBB1M|4|Not as gel as I thought they would be
B00BI2APMW|5|basic tool . reads and clears codes. the price is right !
B001INACSS|5|ty
B001OBCZSO|1|Ordered it twice. First time, it was completely rusty. Second time, rust again!
B00ZQ30SO4|5|FIT MY CHRYSLER 200 Limited PERFECTLY, Have had on for over 2 weeks and they are still like brand new. Not even rusting yet.
B005CLL830|5|Arrived in a timely manner and fit perfectly
B00NWGZ3A6|5|This is a super light weight and has full function in a small package.  This will easily fit in a shirt pocket!  Works great!  I've used it already to test batteries as well as components on a circuit board.
B00E9HWP1M|3|Not the greatest mat, but it will do.
B00IKJD8H0|5|excellent
B000E2CVT2|5|Top quality K&N for regular price.
B008OYAOSW|5|These were a great deal! They take over half of the pressure off my lady's back and made riding in the sissy seat much more enjoyable she said. Getting ready to pair it with a sissy bar so she can really lean into the comfort.
B00533X5LU|5|Takes a little time and came out perfect. Great instruction as well. Recommended
B00X6HFCQG|5|Small, nice, and to the point!  The Flag Sticker says it all!
B000EDOSKQ|5|Good stuff.  Seals well and I have had no problems since I used it to install my fantastic vent.  It has been tested through some hard rains and so far, no leaks.
B009DJSOIY|4|excellent
B00A740VQM|5|Great for hobby and smaller projects
B008ADTRBM|4|Good looking caps goes well, fits well,
B003UN4FXW|5|Easy to install,  works as advertised
B00X5GEPGQ|5|These looks great on the AC vents. They are super shiny chrome and attach easily with the 3M tape. They are a perfect fit for my 2015 Subaru Forester 2.5i Premium.
B000EDUUIA|2|I am sure that this product will eventually work as it is meant to.  When I received this product it was in a plastic envelope and that is it.  There were no instructions, no manufacture information, nothing.  I assume that you go and clean the floor and then attach using the provided double sided  tape.  That is just my guess since as I said there was nothing to tell me otherwise.
B0036FKNVW|5|Love the key chains!  Thanks!
B000Q71N8K|5|Excellent
B00HT9XJLW|5|If you've never used Posi-Lock Connectors...you will kick yourself when you finally do. I can't imagine doing any electrical work on my motorcycles without these and now, an easy way to find them online.
B0009IQZPW|5|Made in the USA.  Very good pads, rinse out and reuse them and they will last a long time.
B00J0VDYYE|5|Easy to install and work great
B00XAX4B9A|5|Love this sunshade. So easy to use. Goes up fast and is easily closed.
B00AMZ0IQO|3|Fast shipping, color fads from the sun to fast
B001CO69AS|5|Wonderful Hydro shield for the Injen SP1993 System / Filter
B004O9WC18|5|The liner works great and is very sturdy. Very easy to clean when needed, I hose it down and let it dry.
B005V4B8J2|4|worked great the back seat was a little loose for me i ended up after a while throwing that part out cause i didn't like the way it was after a few years and keeping the head rest covers front seat covers searing wheel and seat belt cover and floor mats.  lasts a long time
B0000CBIK5|3|Had to grease it up once it got here for it to really work. Nothing great
B007PP26RI|5|Worked great when used on a smoker.
B0000BYEXO|5|Great battery. Be careful not to over tighten terminal nuts (like the nitwit that was helping me did) as bolts are a brass alloy and easily stripped. Fortunately each terminal had two mounting points.
B004RGOS24|3|Works fine
B00SHZHKWQ|5|I love how my truck looks and they fit pretty well.  Great finish.  Had to buy the putco mirror covers separate as I have the tow mirrors with signals in them.
B00V5QDJI8|5|Very nice! The soft rubbery silicone knobs fit my fat thumbs perfectly. Makes flying much more comfortable, and IMO more easily maneuverable.
B00274JM7E|4|Very happy that actual tempo was in the holder.
B0010Z4MDK|5|Received promptly......is exactly what we needed.
B000AUMYMM|5|Always perfect
B00FUT7IP6|5|work great
B005FI1MAO|5|The kia seat belts cover fit and looks great in my kia optima  I would recommend to all kia owners.
B00GSAUHB8|5|This works wonders, easy to set up in the window.
B00TQ9W7RU|5|Yes it met my expectations.
B0071HE2SQ|5|I buy this for a friend and his wife. They have been using it on regular bases for almost 8 months with not issues. They have it install on 2 Scorpion Helmets and ride on a Yamaha R6 2013. If you ride with a partner or even on different motorcycles I would recommend to buy this. Changes the way of enjoining the ride with someone
B004HCM9H4|5|Meguiar's is the best.
B00IY229C8|5|this tire hoist assembly I order fit perfectly just like the old one I taken off, I'm very please with this product.
B003ETZAMC|5|Works as advertised
B000GOG3MO|5|My ac works better then it did brand new :) plus it saved me hundreds of dollars from having to go to a mechanic. Thanks :)
B0009YI40U|5|We installed this before our 32 hour round trip to Wisconsin. It saved us a ton of gas! It works fantastic!! I would highly reccomend this!
B00UBIMB0I|5|Purchased at Wallymart. I've tried over a dozen or more different &#34;wet tire&#34; products, and Barrett seems to be the best one. I used this on tires, wheel well liners, and wiped with a rag onto bumper/window/mirror trim, plus wipers.<br /><br />The spray nozzle works well, no clogs or &#34;glops&#34;. The product smells &#34;peachy&#34;, and NOT like an axe-saturated zitfaced teen. It washed off my hand after the first try with a bar of soap. Super A+ for aqll of that.<br /><br />The product goes on thick and is drippy and opaque at first, but dries clear. I wiped it off the wheel chrome, so I can't comment on how it dries there.<br /><br />Although it kept the shiny look for about 36 hours, it's now not &#34;wet&#34; shiny ... but it's better than &#34;new tire&#34; black. And, unlike the other guys, it stays black for a long time. It is now two weeks after a single application... I've driven 300+ miles since, through rain and puddles, but not mud/offroad yet... and every treated surface looks like it did on day 2. At this point in time, I would call it &#34;satin+ black&#34;, not gleaming, but infinitely  better than other products at twice or more the cost.
B002L15W8G|3|Not to be use with cars with side airbags
B00M8F23A0|5|5 Stars
B000CN9376|5|Great product...run in all my cars
B00ODLTW4C|5|Looks good. Perfect fit.
B00IT87MXS|4|works well
B009R7W4G0|5|good deal,as described fit fine
B004HYNGDI|5|Fit perfect
B00VAH16T6|5|We loved the decal, was as advertized and shipped swiftly!
B0016I8HMS|5|It is a Hitch.  Once installed pulled with no problem.  Instructions were a 4 star.  It does not state to only use one of the guide wires at a time ( makes a Big difference ).  I used electrical tape to keep bolts from going back into frame when putting hitch in place.  You will need to cut your heat shields for bolts to pass through.  You will need two people to lift hitch in place.  Takes about an hour to install.
B00KEKX85A|1|It's ok
B00EHIPUHE|5|Easy to install, work great! Best relatively inexpensive upgrade you can make. Customer service is great of needed.
B00QM9QT80|5|They are gorgeous! I will be ordering more to give to friends. Hopefully, Jim Webb will be getting more positive attention as a presidential candidate in the coming weeks!
B00L2OVNCM|5|Matched the yellow OEM cap and comes with a O-ring. Marked 5W30.
B00DJQCY2O|1|Can arrived dented and the plastic tip where the hose screws on was also damaged, it leaked at least 1/4 of the can when i attempted to use it
B007Q1F4LQ|5|Works perfectly.  This is the revised 7mm thread version for Chevy trucks & SUVs prior to 2007.
B00ONDM07G|5|Rest assured, the base for the camera actually holds your camera level, not facing down towards the hood or up in the sky. Works great
B001P3035I|5|Works as promised to keep one cool.
B007EES55C|4|Very nice, but the &#34;Screaming Eagle&#34; was too small.
B000S2U6QI|5|Works perfectly.  This is the revised 7mm stud version for Chevy trucks & SUVs prior to 2007.
B006ZIE9LW|5|Excellent
B002UQ7HJY|5|Fits and works. Not much to be wrong with this.
B00KQXKG46|5|Excellent quality light bar!
B005C5BN9U|5|No problems at all
B00B8YJF1W|1|2 2012 body styles. I guess I got the wrong style. Front visor works but not seated along the whole base of the frame. The backs I couldn't attempt as they were not even close.
B007VHBGIU|5|perfect fit for my 2007 F150, glad i bought it through Amazon,thanks
B00O8ZPK1C|5|Nice fit nice 2
B009DK7E5M|5|Matched factory other side great!
B00SC0ZU00|5|Honda shop wanted almost $200 for one key fob and programming. Got two from AMAZON for about $35. Took 20 minutes to program. Work like the original.
B00792IU7W|5|Great product acutely a Volvo part way cheaper than from Volvo!
B0063MO5R8|4|Good material and manufacture, but are enough thicker than the OEM clips on my Subaru that they BARELY fit, and one actually had to be re-replaced with the OEM rusted clip because it would not fit at all. This was with NEW brake lines.
B004A6JA1K|5|It fits as it should.
B008VQQKZO|5|nice
B00OU67Z80|5|I received this light for Christmas this past year and could not be more pleased. I work in law enforcement and this light has been the envy of many of my fellow law enforcement friends. Extremely bright and has good battery life. Recharges very quickly. Very very happy with this light.
B00GKA0THS|5|Excellent!
B000GAXOHA|5|Love them
B00OO1KOWA|5|Perfect fit! Great price and timely! What more can I ask for?
B0043063JU|5|Perfect size, great product
B00CIZ728I|5|Love it!
B000GQ6LF6|5|The hitch fit my 2015 Chevy Equinox WITHOUT a problem. The install time was about 40 minutes. I would encourage you to get a second pair of hands as doing it solo might lead to minor injuries and alot of frustration.
B00EPDL4VW|5|Best one I have bought yet!
B008H4LSBG|5|These lights are very bright, and are extremely noticeable, even in the day light. Installed on a '12 HD Ultra
B004UBCKYY|5|sharp
B00BM87YFI|5|Great Product quick delivery.<br /><br />Thanks,
B0018EW0JQ|5|everything went great
B0016KH240|4|So far works as described. Seems a little difficult switch from forward to backwards cranking but nothing to bad. I had to adjust it because the handle is a longer than my original.
B00FS0WF82|2|They worked but in retrospect would have spent a few extra bucks to buy longer ones. I used these to reattach my car seat cover after fixing the heating element. Dealer wanted $500.00. I did it for less than $40 with this purchase and the element.
B0040M30U6|2|Too dark for GA= $193 ticket
B000COBK8A|5|I have a 2005 Acura TL and the horns fit like a charm. Very happy with our purchase.
B007CMPTWI|5|Good product at a good price.
B00J4ZB3NU|5|These were not quite the size I needed going from pictures but they worked after I enlarged the ramp plate holes and re-balanced it.
B007KBL466|5|Nice pin........
B00O83NSY0|5|Looks great on my truck. The cargo light is brighter than I expected.
B00YJIB7WE|5|there great would buy again thanks
B000CO84QQ|5|Just what I was looking for.
B0036OXY28|5|Although the engine is not completely assembled yet, the rods are high quality and of correct dimensions. The set is weight matched and very nice. The shipping was prompt!
B00IKPE8AU|5|works as expected, decent quality.
B007OW6MD6|5|Pros:<br />1. Fits around the bolt.<br />2. Pan doesn't leak<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. None<br /><br />Summary:<br />Worth spending the 90 cents per crush washer as added insurance to keep oil in the pan and from dripping out. Shipping was fast!
B00Q0UNW9A|3|I love this bag. I bought it for commuting to work and back on my CBR600RR. I have two issues. First one is for you sport bike riders out there, at over 70mph this bag is a bit sketchy the wind resistance is pretty strong and wants to pull you all over the place. Manageable but it's better for sensible commuting not going crazy. Second this is the GT bag and what is pictured is the GTS  which has the form fitted sleek top flap. I posted a pic so you can see what your actually getting. It comes with a cellphone pouch that can attach to the sholder strap and a waist strap. All the straps are pretty much infinantly adjustable. I am giving this 3 stars for those 2 reasons. Shipping was right on time. Worth the money and looks awesome.
B003CKVIG0|5|A set of shims isn't anything to get overly excited about, but having your own set beats the hell out of having to drive to your dealer, only to find they are missing the one size you need.  Good price, and as a bonus, I've pretty much guaranteed that my valves will never move again.
B000EVYGQY|4|I can read the ABS codes from my 2002 Isuzu Rodeo V6!.... It has a GM ABS control module!   The only problem is that I have to use &#34;GM&#34; instead of &#34;Isuzu&#34; to get the meaning of the code from the Innova website.
B003VO8NJW|4|Good quality, easy to install, very nice 'window dressing', but if you are looking for durability, yes, they will protect the door sill paint, but expect the these to get scratched and up pretty good.
B00DVJPAFM|2|Has no light. has no mounting points. Gage works well other that the two previously mentioned items.
B00BITHWYE|5|Perfect fit. Shipped fast.
B000L9AD2K|5|So far, I'm impressed with this compressor. It's quiet and works well. The case it comes with is handy and keeps everything contained which helps me keep the backseat of the truck looking tidy.
B001DUK6EQ|5|It was exactly what I was looking for. Thanks to Amazon
B00MNT8XEQ|5|It fit the truck great.and it looks awesome
B00EDWLJ3S|5|Worked great for my jeep
B004RH8J50|5|Fits perfect on mine 99 XJ inline 6.
B00V5PUCDE|5|They work great
B000HEBR3I|2|I went through 3 of these, they only last a few weeks and eventually die
B00852684M|5|what a kool product
B0002YQSQO|4|We had it in three days. It works great.
B001UHHMRG|1|Seemed to fill in a few light swirl marks however it isn't worth all the hype. There are much better products in this price range. Overall it did nothing but highlight any scratches left behind with the trademark white residue.
B0033B3QHW|4|The mirror was identical to the one that broke off of my 1992 F250.  Finish was perfect and looks great on my truck.  And it came with all the necessary parts<br /><br />Low cost was exactly up my alley, and it shipped to my door before it was expected to arrive by 3 days!<br /><br />Only problem is that the bolt doesn't seem long enough for my mirror brackets.  However, I made it work.
B0010G7XBC|5|worked
B00J622WP4|4|I am rating the helmet a 4 simply because the lid itself seems to be of good quality. Heavy duty. However the goggles seemed to be an afterthought. Goggles arrived broken, and very poorly made. Almost like the maker produced the helmet and then thought, what the Heck let's run to the dollar store and buy all the toy goggles they have. Keeping the helmet, the goggles to to my 4 year old.
B0085IJCIK|5|worked great !
B00FDW57VC|5|Awesome! very easy to replace! thankyou
B00HA8HCRY|5|Exactly what I wanted. All the bottles came in one piece with non of them spilling or the seal broken.
B00JBJ6KQY|2|cheaply made. saw better mats at costco for $17.95
B00513G82U|5|The trunk is very spacious and nice finish with a great chrome rack on top looks great on my Honda VTX Touring
B000COY9OM|5|Highly recommended!! +++++
B00SEU17GE|5|Thanks!
B004GC57OW|3|2 if the tabs broke off during installation but still fits fairly snug
B00DHQV5RQ|5|Excellent sunshade! Although somewhat pricey, the quality is there to justify the cost. This is a perfect fit for my 08 Corolla.
B00VNBDWPK|4|Seems like a quality product but does not fit 2014 Toyota 4Runner
B007GMDFBG|5|gets drivers attention
B000F3RYGA|5|Easy to put on, very sturdy and weatherproof so far.
B0044KHORY|5|Thanks
B0009IZ8DM|5|Greatest thing..thanks
B001CF1A6U|5|Heavy duty  strong  ease of operation
B000C5402W|5|moog products are all i will ever buy and very strong products definatly would buy again if needed
B006OQ35GU|5|Perfect! I can not see the when the black tank is finished without pulling the hose out of the sewer.
B00L0YAEA6|2|I AM VERY MECHANICALLY INCLINED FOR STARTERS, SECONDLY I THOUGHT I'D SAVE MY BUDDY SOME MONEY BUY PURCHASING THIS $15.00 CARB. ........................WE'LL IT WENT ON A POULAN WILD THING CHAIN SAW ,WHICH FOR ONE, HAD TO ALTER AIR FILTER BOX AND GRIND SOME OF THE CHOKE LEVER OFF, SECONDLY REROUTE A FUEL LINE, THIRD, IT STARTED QUICKLY!!!!!! BUTT WHAT A HEADACHE TO ADJUST AND IT IS NOT AS GOOD AS ORIGINAL, SLIGHT DEAD SPOT......FOR WHAT ITS WORTH I DID WORK ON TWO IDENTICAL SAWS,THE 2ND SAW I USED O.E. CARB//JUST CLEANED AND REPLACED FUEL LINES (BASIC SERVICE)<br />HAD IT ADJUSTED QUICKLY,IT SCREAMS!!!!!!!!!!  BUY ORIGINAL OR REBUILD YOUR OLD ONE AVOID THIS JUNK!!!!!!
B005NLQAHS|5|Works perfect in our Prius. I plug this in, pair it with my 9&#34; tablet. Run the Torque app, and can diagnose the reason our Prius has dropped from 45-47 mpg average down to only 35 mpg average. There are knock-off Bluetooth OBD2 units on the market for about 1/2 the price of this one from BAFX. I didn't want to take the chance of wasting my money so I bought this one and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The OBD2 scan tool has some lights but I didn't pay any attention to them. All I wanted was for this unit to interface with the ODB2 on our Prius and transmit that information to my 9&#34; tablet. The &#34;Torque&#34; app on my tablet does all of the real work by connecting up to this scan tool using Bluetooth.<br /><br />So far this tool has worked flawlessly. We leave it plugged in all of the time. Our ODB2 connector is under the dash and is located above the gas pedal. It is a bit long but it's not in the way and we don't notice it for bump into it.<br /><br />It was totally simple to use. I just plugged it in and it started working. It has stayed connected through Bluetooth without dropping the signal at all. All of the information that we set up on the Torque app is able to be delivered by this BAFX scan tool. I have no complaints.<br /><br />I highly recommend this BAFX tool.
B00PGHQ51K|5|Great helmet great service.
B00FTAYJ4Y|5|on time &  perfect fit
B006Q7C7L6|1|Arrived Broken.
B0002JMF9I|5|Great product came fast.
B002PQQAAG|5|These are the real deal, not like my last set of replacement lights which literally fell apart. Solid construction, excellent illumination, very pleased.
B000C9QEF4|5|Perfect fit for my Chevy 2500hd diesel truck. It is nice to be able to get these things delivered and know that if amazon tells you if it will fit your vehicle, then it will fit. Everything that said will fit my vehicle has been perfect so far.
B00CFM9QLA|3|The item is nice and big but is very flimsy and does not stand up well when empty.  I would prefer to have the outer wall be more firm.
B00EFFZ8GC|5|I love it .
B005E9NT46|1|I asked for a Captain America Shield, what I got was a red heart... Didn't bother complaining because it wasn't expensive and because I had it shipped through a US-based friend, so whatever.
B00STXAXJ8|5|Originally I did not receive the mats, they were lost in translation but the company did a great job of assisting me and getting another set sent out to me. Now they are in my jeep and look great. They fit well and are keeping my jeep nice and clean.
B009DB8PSG|3|Ear buds worked great.  Found the case ineffective in winding up.  Cord keeps getting caught when you try to wind up after use.  Had to keep lid open and manually wrap cord very carefully to get back into case.
B00ODGHVMW|3|Material was thin and didn't fit my seats. Company shipping and refund was excellent.
B0009H51X0|5|Thanks
B00514BFG8|5|Just what I needed to relocate my turn signals. A great looking bracket to give the lights a new home!
B00JIEX722|5|product is Ok
B00YI3IGA6|5|THESE ARE GREAT KEEPS THE SUN FROM SUN BURNING ANYONE IN MY BACK SEAT AND THEY FIT GREAT  . I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEM FALLING OFF  AND GETTING LOST . THESE HAVE TO BE TAKEN OFF BY SOMEONE . I PURCHASED THESE AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE AN EXCHANGE FOR A TRUTHFUL AND UNBIASED REVIEW .
B00URR4O5I|2|This is more of a public service announcement than a full review as i'm still testing this stuff. However I wanted to partially endorse what the other 2 star reviewer pointed out that this material is fairly thin and can be torn by hand even if you're not very strong. I ripped a sheet in half quite easily. You MUST wear gloves when using this material because even though the foil backing is far too thin to probably ever cut anyone the black &#34;substance&#34; does have similar properties to asphalt based products and will leave its black tar like residue all over your hands. It is only removable if you do not press very firmly when applying it with a roller. As long as you follow the manufacturer's instructions for installation it will not peel away if attempting  to remove it. Actually any attempt to remove it at that point will simply result in it tearing away in chunks with most of the tar like substrate left on the application surface.<br /><br />Far more importantly than that is that no one pointed out (or may be equipped to point out) that this HAS NO INSULATING PROPERTIES whatsoever. Not even the slightest bit of heat is reduced after applying this to any surface. The thermal conductivity of this material is actually very high and it's probably better at conducting heat than it is at resisting or blocking it. I tested it on a surface of temperature 131F (55C) and in just a few seconds the noico heated up to the same temperature as the surface even without peeling the backing off the adhesive surface. If you are expecting any level of thermal insulation whatsoever from this product you will be disappointed. I believe the illusion of thermal insulating ability is because testing was done with an infrared thermometer instead of a thermocouple. When using an infrared thermometer to test the surface temperature drop of the foil backing the infrared reading off the foil backing caused an error of about 68F (20C) lower than the actual surface temperature of the noico. retesting with a thermocouple showed no change between the untreated surface and the surface treated with the noico. If you are going to try to test for thermal efficiency do NOT use an infrared thermometer unless you are applying heat directly to the noico foil backing and measuring the temperature drop on the opposite side of the surface treated with the noico. I wanted to do a more real world analysis so I used the sun to heat up the outter surface and applied the noico to the inner surface and then tested to see if there was any temperature change. There was none.<br /><br />Yet to be determined is how long it will stick to my test surface at &#34;summer temperatures&#34; after being applied to the underside &#34;hanging upside down?&#34; of a sheet of metal left in the sun everyday all day long with surface/under-surface temperatures reaching as high as 158F (70C). It's hard to see it failing at being a sound deadening material because as long as it adhere's to the surface it will add enough mass to any metal surface to reduce the resonant frequency to far below what it would have been initially. Basically if you use this material ONLY on sheet metal and ONLY for the purpose of dampening or eliminating resonant vibrations of said sheet metal then I'm pretty sure (if it continues to adhere to the surface) you will get good results from it. If you require a material that can actually BLOCK sound from getting through the sheet metal or if you require any thermal barrier whatsoever you will need to use this in tandem with their noico liner product which I haven't yet tested (and probably won't).<br /><br />I'll update the review and rating based on how long the product adheres to the test surface(undersurface actually) and how the product itself performs the job of sheet metal resonance vibration damping. (which is all this thing should really be able to do well) If it passes these two tests then this will gain a 5 star rating upgrade from me because it does everything it is capable of doing within reasonable expectations and it does it for half the price of the competition.g within reasonable expectations and it does it for half the price of the competition.
B00IRBPCEI|5|I use this all the time!<br /><br />PROS:<br />Contains many tools in a very small package<br />Lightweight<br />Well made<br />Useful<br /><br />CONS:<br />Allen keys can bend when too much torque is applied.<br />Screwdrivers are awkward to use, since you have to rotate the entire tool.
B00BBMOGNS|1|The quality was really bad. The mounting bracket was not as universal as I was expecting. Many of the bolt holes needed to be re-drilled for my bike (1999 sportster) The mounting bracket also completely broke after 1000 miles of use. (I did a 800 mile road trip a couple weeks after installing.) It is currently unusable until I fabricate a new mounting bracket when I have a chance.
B000GVA7JM|5|Fantastic upgrade over the stock shocks on my '00 Softail Deuce.
B00RGZWIW0|5|nice, folds away when not using, good price
B004AIHCOU|4|ever thing worked fine
B00EI6CKVE|4|Small stick people - not clear.
B00BQAJUNG|5|Arrived exactly as advertised.
B00LY8WDPW|5|Perfect ATV lens.
B0055PD1H4|5|Quite simply put, this is the most amazing product for keeping a Jeeps vast amount of black plastic actually black. It took a little elbow grease and multiple coats, but it changed my nearly white fenders on my 07 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited back to showroom black. I was skeptical as I have tried multiple products with little to no success. I was a step away from just painting them when I saw the commercial for this stuff and decided to give it a try. It took a bit of time and a good amount of buffing but I am completely blown away. My Jeep looks new again! I cannot recommend this product enough, and I honestly think that at least for a Jeep, if someone says that it isn't working they aren't putting in the elbow grease in order to make it work.
B00141KZO0|5|Somehow it is very difficult to find wiper blades for my volkswagen and these are exactly what i need for my 2011 Jetta, I buy these whenever i need them
B002N5DE2G|5|What can I say a fuse is a fuse.
B00PJPHEBO|5|Worked great with my Nexus 10 tablet running the free &#34;Torque&#34; app
B001G7F5I8|5|received a genuine Mazda relay for half the price compared to what the dealer wanted.
B000J41YO8|5|it covers the entire windshield perfectly as if custom made.
B00G5DEMJQ|5|Good spec oil for a good price. Cheap enough to avoid messing with wal-mart. It says Dexos approved on the new bottles i received.
B000RXKR6M|5|Excellent, absorbs lots of soap suds, very nice to hold and wash the car, very gentle on car surface
B0023GM2KK|5|Just as advertised...4 weeks later and no leaks.
B000Z7D1FO|5|gave me about 1 more mpg on a 2008 gmc 5.3
B006JD481Y|5|Easy to program and works fine
B00OZWLXO6|5|Looks good and more air flow
B00APTSCC4|5|Fit like a charm! this fit my 2011 Hyundai Tucson perfectly. it was easy to get on and wipes clean and clear.
B001JT0CGI|4|A+
B001CA9CN8|4|Quick install and works nicely, but I think it's very over-priced for what it is.<br />1 box includes just 1 filter.
B00K35U9XK|5|Shipped on time. Compressor is working fine
B00PV6W2KO|5|Looks really great!!!!
B00D99S1FK|5|Love it
B0082365AQ|1|There is a lot of feedback about the smell of these tires. They leave a very strong smell of vulcanized rubber in an interior space (car or house). Worse, they do not last. After purchase, kart was used less than 5 times and in less than a year, the tire had a flat from a leak in the sidewall. Absolute horrible quality from the same company in China that makes virtually all of these. 3/4&#34; axle not a type that can be replaced from others at Menard's or Harbor Freight.
B004C6OBBC|5|working good
B000AMBNPY|5|Just used the screens on a long trip and they were great.  They more than covered the rear windows in my 2011 Accord.  A tricky to fold back up until you find the right wrist motion.
B001OMVCN2|5|love it . hope it last a long time
B00K1L27JK|1|Extremely annoying drone, varying volume with load, with engine speed centred at ~2000rpm. Very tiresome sinceengine spends much of its time at this speed. I will revert to the OEM part, which fortunately I kept, as soon as I can.
B00B7R8SR2|1|the bracket did not allow transfer case linkage to shift without modification
B003JLCK50|5|Awesome bag plenty of room
B001PNMBS0|5|Installed outdoors on dock.Still working great after a month with lots of rain
B00KTJ9I46|5|instructions were easy to follow
B007QBQJHY|5|1996 Impala direct fit
B00ETGZZ5G|5|I purchased this rack to use with my cross-bars on my Vw Jetta SportWagon.<br />It mounted to them like a dream and worked great, I fit all of our suitcases plus bags in the rack so we had room for days in the car.
B00AZ4SPJO|3|Don't fit as well as some others but work fine for what they are with a great price.
B00ANQ530S|1|They were just what I needed!  Nice, brand new lights. Went on very easily.
B00F7S70EY|1|Terrible job putting stickers on the plate. Do not buy from this guy. Stickers were put on wrong
B00VNJ4TRW|5|Works very well.
B000M5Y720|5|I can see again
B00JBIDER8|5|They are perfect thanks
B00EBQJA78|4|Gives the car a nice look, however the caps for the screws did not fit..
B000AL8VD2|5|Umm its grease:)
B00E5BWLU2|5|These are the greatest!<br />Don't know why the company stopped making them.<br />This is the 3rd set I have had in over 10 years!<br />Best for seats with built in side air bags!<br />Love them!
B00AZ4RSUG|5|Very satisfied
B000NW8D86|5|i have replaced my old blade &#34; 5 blades&#34; with this one that has 7 blades and it is a perfect fit for my Chevy Tahoe 2007. I got more air flow as a result better performance Air conditioning,
B00DSOUG5E|4|Good setup. Controls are easy to use if you read the instructions, microphone sound quality is good. If I would add anything I would make my Siri on my phone accessible by voice command as opposed to holding down the button. Sound quality for listening to music can sound a bit on the trebly side, but if you wear a musicians earplug it flattens the sound and improves quality. Unit holds a charge well and seems to do fine in rain. Good setup for the $$$
B000C122ZI|5|Easy to install and has worker perfectly!
B00VAVSWQC|5|They're not from the dealer but they're perfectly fine
B002PGRJN8|5|Very nice coil packs for the moneyand they fit perfect definitely recommend them if you need them
B00KYDA2GA|4|So far so good
B00B71RPSQ|5|One of the best tools in mt basket. Period.
B00IWO4K8O|5|Works perfectly to get the seatbelt off the neck and back on the  shoulder  where it belongs.
B00U8OTU3Q|5|Great tools for door panel removal
B000CNA0G4|5|Great leafs, way better than the aged & flat OEM leaf springs with RE add-a-leafs. Ride quality drastically improved, but that's a given comparing against old, worn out springs. Will update this later with actual lift amount once they settle.<br /><br />If anything, my only gripe would be that these look nothing like the picture.<br /> - 5 leaf pack w/4 clamps? Nope. 3 leaf pack (+ load leaf), 2 clamps<br /> - 2nd leaf wrap under spring eyes? Nope.<br /> - Poly bushings? Nope. Rubber bushings.<br /> - Came with degree shims installed, not pictured.<br /><br />None of these things deterred me from installing them, just wish the seller on Amazon would use an accurate picture. If anything, I'm glad they were rubber bushings, and was thankful for the degree shims. I would've liked to see the additional clamps and the second leaf wrap under the spring eyes, but I digress. I'm still happy with them.
B00L4IAXJK|5|Worked perfectly.  As good, if not better than the original that came with the car. Cost me $40 to have the key cut...and shop just gave me the screw for the back(not included).  Hell of a better deal than $300 from the dealer.
B000WEKQ3K|1|Received wrong weather tech mats.  They did not fit 2011 Ford Flex SEL.  Delivered return to UPS yesterday, 8/3/15.
B000C57Y98|1|Did not show up with rubber boot.
B00NQ8FD1Y|5|Did the job and looks good as well
B004969R6Y|4|These still work fine and are much cheaper than &#34;high tech&#34; blades.
B002JBDH26|5|nice!
B00L32LJLS|5|Excellent fit, good quality.  It is easy to remove in seconds to open the bed for odd shaped or oversized cargo.  When it is open and closes the bed I've had a 2 mpg increase.
B001GQ41NY|5|nice bright and clean. i sure hope they do not fade
B000K043EE|5|bon produit merci
B008CE0R40|3|Has strong chemical odor that will not seem to go away,  Have to wrap them in plastic for storage or leave them in the bed of the truck.
B000GZK7UM|5|The Slipstream worked perfect on my Honda Big Ruckus, it was easy to install and infinitely adjustable for the perfect heighth. It seems to have no effect on slowing the bike down but gives very good wind protection and bug protection. I think this is a very good product for the price.<br />Use blue loctite on all threaded areas to prevent losning.
B004I1F0QQ|5|Replacement light fit well, my wife is very pleased to get rid of the weathered lights.
B00ODSDRKU|5|It wasn't quite as bright as I'd hoped, but no problem.  Still bright enough.  I tested it out on a smaller garden tractor 12 volt battery I have to see how long it would take to drain it.  The battery isn't new and it takes only about 45 minutes of usage on my 2GPM pump sprayer to go dead.  This light lasted over 3 days (72+ hours) of always on usage before it began to dim even slightly.  It is easy to hook up and perfectly flush on the bottom.  Great product for the price.
B00HKMHU7C|5|Product as expected... Fast shipping
B00BEN38YC|5|good solid shackles lifted rear just abut 2&#34;
B00D8DR0AO|5|I am loving this stuff! I use this on both of my cars and two different  RV's  and it works great. Takes less time on the rv than traditional rinse method and I use about 5 gallons of water. Discovering this is the only good that came out of the drought.
B005584M38|1|Disappointed with this item. Did not fit the way it should, could not use the small face place. They do not fit.
B00QMQX8WI|5|As advertised. Also is just stretchy enough to not sag when across bed of my Tacoma.
B00AYKIS6Y|5|Almost perfect match... Best thing ever body shop was charging me $450.. Cheap and perfect.. 95%color matched..
B0091Q3NCG|5|Did what I wanted it for.
B00CHI89JW|5|Saved me nearly $100!
B00JINPJD8|5|Perfect device for keeping my car washing sponges clean of debris.  Would definitely purchase another.
B00NWF7EZE|5|PROGRAMMED WITHIN 30 SECONDS
B000VF7PNO|5|Easy plug and play install once you get the wires plugs in place and the led lights make the truck look more modern and it's very shiny
B0087GQVY8|4|My old exhaust broke due to broken motor mounts. Ordered this and a magnaflow hi flow cat and brought it to a muffler shop. 140 in labor and it was all on my car. Very quiet with silencer. Shop said the hangers are stretched to the limit. Will be back in 2 months and will change my review then. 98 civic dx hatch  If this review was helpful, please click the yes button below.
B00N509LP2|5|Great buy, lots of useful tools for the price
B00PFUWJMC|5|Good quality metal not plastic ....
B00CDAFT6K|3|Size is a bit odd and visability is not as good.
B000BNU29A|4|Easy to install, very sturdy, great looking bars.  The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because one of them had a small dent in it, really a dimple.  It was small enough that I didn't bother to return them though.  I'm really pleased with them.
B003TPW5YM|5|Works great with my new foam cannon. Also leaves the car amazingly clean.
B007FFNXPC|5|works good
B000C55MIS|5|Great product. Exactly what i needed. My 77' El Co is heavy and felt like it rode on a cloud before I installed these. Huge difference. Smooth ride, minimal drop in ride height when carrying anything. And helped with body roll.
B00UB66FMA|5|Great product and excellent customer service!  I love my dachshund decal, it looks so cool, get lots of compliments! Thank you!
B00NSEME2M|2|Cheap plastic and doesn't fit correctly on my JK unlimited sport.
B00MOR4D5U|2|I bought 2 sets of H13's and on both vehicles I installed them on the bulbs leaked. When washing the vehicles water was getting into the headlight housing. I have uninstalled and put stock bulbs back in. I am very disappointed with the bulbs not sealing in the headlight housing.
B000CRO4IK|4|once in a while the pennies/dimes don't slide out very easily, so you just gotta get your finger nails involved, but its nice
B00GOHST6U|5|Look great on the truck!
B00NV2FTPA|5|Quick shipping and excellent price makes this a hit. Install was easy and they look great. As an Oregon resident the waterproofing will be thoroughly tested this winter.
B0034NKDKC|4|Excellent for the money.
B0002JMEQW|5|Worked very well.
B000NW8ES0|5|Much better than oe part
B00B77MMXS|5|Great fit, great appearance, and very sturdy.
B00EVY3RQU|4|Great product for the money! Very soft leather and it is made of small piece's. One of the reason's I like it. The stitching seem's to be very close and durable. If you get a few year's out of this set, It was well worth it! No it's not solid leather or have the HD name. Neither does it have the HD price. But.... 90% is real leather! You can smell it before you take it out of the box. 4 out of 5 star's. Would have been 5. But nothing is perfect.
B006O85URK|5|As advertised
B00AU4F74K|1|It didn't work
B000EQR4IG|4|OEM what more can be said
B000KL0P3Q|5|Arrived on time, worked perfectly.
B00IYGUVYM|5|Very bright even at during the day
B00EELM7PM|1|It didnt fit my car
B005JPJMI2|4|Very watery but it does the job
B00ANAMBJU|5|Very good quality . Easy to install. Great u -tube video on the install process.
B001D4NF90|4|Made z ride better and handle better.  New shocks wouldnt hurt
B001GJ3FIS|5|Works great . So purchased another . Very  satisfied .
B0023VDJSE|5|Good Communications.  Great Product.  Quick Service.  Rated AAA+++.  Thank You.  BEG
B00A63FQS2|5|Great neckbrace for price.
B00DD09HW6|5|It fit just as good very pleased with quality.
B007KPWU8I|5|Easy install great fit and look
B00514A0T6|5|works as described
B004SCETXU|1|Screws were too short so had to go to hardware store to purchase new ones. Had assistance for a few minutes but couldn't get the job done due to the screws. Now I'll have to pay to have them mounted! Not a real good experience.
B00D9C2CDO|5|This product was perfect for our trip. It was a lot bigger than we thought as well. I would definitely recommend!
B008L3JB44|5|The item is great!  Great color. High quality.
B00S75E1BO|5|Best price I have found for this item.
B000BUOSGG|5|Perfect for my little studio kitchen! Might be too small for a household of more then one person though.
B001LHVOVK|5|this tool works very well.
B007552NHQ|4|Bought for my 2014 Focus ST. It fits well and does a good job of keeping the car much cooler. It is sturdy and built far better than any of the cheap universal-fit sun shades.<br /><br />My only complaints are that is requires you to lower the visors to keep it in place, it doesn't cover the whole windshield (there are gaps on the top and side) and you cannot get it into place or remove it, without messing up the rear-view mirror adjustment. It can also be a bear to fold.
B000IE0EZO|5|Cant go wrong with one of these in ur car u never know
B007P72AZE|5|Parts came on time and we're just what the Dr. ordered.
B00KBHE4WM|4|Fits Great.  Needs a couple more attachment tabs, but works just fine otherwise
B000CPI6VI|5|Perfect adapter.
B0055R5TRC|5|Beautiful decoration for my car window. Nice quality.
B00CHCPT32|5|These mirrors are light  yet sturdy
B003TQ74I8|5|It fits and looks real nice and the packaging and shipping was good too.  Overall excellent purchase, thank you Baron and thank you Amazon.
B00SZ71HDY|5|Love this item and glad I got. It on my truck
B00ECHY33C|3|Keeping it reading upright is a problem because it rotates in its holder on my Valkyrie handlebar from the slight vibration.
B00KTIUG5C|5|[[ASIN:B00KTIUG5C 2 KeylessOption Replacement Keyless Entry Remote Control Key Fob Clicker Transmitter 3 Button - Black]]<br /><br />I have a 2008 Ford Focus and received these 2 replacement keys after my vehicle did not come with a keyless entry upon purchase. Both keyless replacements were programmed within a minute, and the directions were fairly easy to follow. After 2 weeks of use, both keyless replacements still work flawlessly. The dimensions of each are 1.75 in X 1 and 3/8 inches.
B00JTOOLXA|4|Nice and shiny even though it gets scratches.
B00B9F8J9O|5|perfect.
B00UFERZKO|5|great product
B00K1IY0HK|5|Works great and easy install. Best advice, watch the videos on YouTube they have great walk through advice.<br /><br />Plus, watch your car model. I have a 2015 CrossTrek and my friends have a 2014 Forester both models have the necessary mount. We did not need the added mounting adapter.
B00DJ5KEEA|5|Excellant  1.25 amp battery tender.....
B0072W5P7M|5|Worked well so far
B00HVMGUAY|5|It was just what he said
B00DSD7IAG|3|Believe it or not, it should have come with instructions. It wasn't obvious whether the figure was a cut out and should separate from the rectangular plastic, or whether the entire rectangle was supposed to peel off the backing and adhere to the window. By the time I figured it out, I'd accidentally allowed one very thin, delicate piece of the figure to roll and stick to itself. It didn't totally ruin the sticker, but it got me flustered and I applied it crooked so it looks like crap. For what it is - a little piece of plastic - it's quite expensive. I don't think it would be unreasonable to expect something in the envelope other than just the decal. A little note - I'm sure you could photocopy six or eight on a single sheet of paper - explaining the best way to apply it would be helpful. And BTW, the one I bought is too small. It doesn't work on the window of a truck. I'll need to buy another that's at least 6&#34; - 9&#34; tall.
B0022ZJLDI|5|Very good product
B00WQA5OH6|5|Work great
B003ULWKSQ|5|Bought this to replace a bad sensor in my 2004 350z. It worked just fine, looks just like the OEM part. I don't know about how long it lasts but I am happy it works and was a lot cheaper than buying one from a dealership.
B009ASFMMO|5|Just what the doctor ordered.
B00AETUVM4|5|Nice quality for the price. very soft flexible rubber and the clamps are good quality
B00ZRLLY6Q|5|12 piece trim removal tool set! Made with nylon, which is gentle on the upholstery compared to metal. Ditch the flathead skrewdriver and don't risk breaking anything. I was using flat tip screwdrivers and was scratching the surface, but not any more. These tools are versitable to different vehicle panels, and makes the installs much easier, well worth the price.  It appears to be durable and did not bend or break with prying. This set can remove the panel from the exterior or interior.  Whether it is to remove the door panel or replacing speaker components, this set has all the tools needed to pry open safely.<br /><br />This set was supplied as a sample for my unbaised review.
B004J3AGVW|1|I'm not sure this helps the rear-end sway in my E-350 all that much.  The installation instructions were mediocre.  Put the money into a good set of shocks: your money will be better spent.
B00W2FJ73M|5|Awsome and arrived quickly with no problems.
B000CQTJPO|2|Bought these a while back and and have had nothing but noisy brakes since. Wagner has also refused to warranty them for noise. According to them, noise is not qualifying reason for warranty. I guess they think its OK to have an annoying and noisy vehicle.<br /><br />I would find a ceramic pad instead of these metallic pads... and maybe ones by a manufacturer that actual cares about their customers.<br /><br />Other than noise, I have not found any other issues. I have not really compared the wear on them, but stopping seems to be fine.
B00RLGL4L0|1|Was not the right part
B009ZNZ7VU|3|The plastic clip insulators are so slippery I can hardly open the clips without losing a grip, and some of the clips were badly misaligned or not functioning. I recommend buying higher quality.
B00AF4SYOU|3|This guard was supposed to be ready fit for our type van. It took 2 body shop men and welding to get this to fit without being permantly welded to the frame. It also leaves the rt and left bumper totally open to being hit. We will see. 2 hrs labor cost.
B0002SR4A4|2|Press worked well initially, does what it says.  Both the ram and the pump have had to get resealed numerous times.  Press is in a shop and gets used weekly, not daily.  Low end quality.
B000A8JNF0|5|It solved a big problem!
B00ARJOQCC|5|Great product my land cruiser runs like never before
B00NHBYOA6|5|This cooler has visited 48 states with me! My review...Extremely reliable! Big enough to hold farm stand veggies and baskets of fruit as well as water jug and lemonade. When on a road trip, eating out can get very expensive. Not with this cooler! Eating out is a luxury and not a nessesity! It even holds leftovers! When I stop to sight see, I come back after 3-4 hours and my food is still cold. Thank you Wagan! I love this cooler! I love the small 7 liter cooler too! I use that one for shorter trips.
B004AIG714|4|excellent
B003FXSJMU|5|it works as expected, i installed this on a 2008 avalanche and the takeoff is greatly improved.<br /><br />now keep in mind this is designed to work with a cold air intake and a programmer.<br />and here's why the stock tuning and intake are not designed to take advantage of or use such mods, and on a completely stock vehicle in most cases this will cause a decrease in gas mileage without the use of a tuner or cold air intake.<br /><br />this is also why most flowmaster users never see the advertised gains or benifits.<br /><br />the progammer should always be the first mod on you're list because without it the other mods are useless and will only show minimal gains if any at all.<br />the reason it worked on mine is because i have a cheap bullydog that i am using, so mine isn't entirely stock and is able to compensate for the mod, now as far as this not fitting the vehicle goes 1st check the part number 2 make sure u dont have the instructions upside down.<br /><br />and i hope this review helps some of the other reviewers. and just a hint edge and diablosport tend to be the best gas tuners on the market and will help to make the most of said mods
B000C83R6E|5|Works as specified, very pleased.
B000E300Q2|5|Did the job
B008HSI63A|5|WORKS GREAT
B001NZQID4|5|Worked for me
B000C1KILI|5|perfect deal
B00BFDI3UK|5|Patiently awaiting winter to see if the whining noise is gone and there is no longer any air getting into my power steering reservoir.
B004C6I8S4|4|Nice wallet. Good material, and construction.<br />While it is a little small for my needs as i tend to carry my life in my wallet from the usual credit cards, and my three different business cards to hand out, (from three different businesses), to assortment of paper's and business cards that i pick up during the course of a week/month. I also carry a clear photo wallet with pic's of every thing from my Daughter and family,  to my Scooter and Dog. Sadly there is not enough room for it all, so for now i just have to leave the photos at home and just have to brag without the visual aids. Over all with that exception i am very happy with the wallet. In fact if the seller / maker of the wallet gets in touch with me to make another one for me to fit my needs,  i will buy another one,  as wallets of this quality are hard to come by.
B00QAMKNYK|5|Works perfectly and have no fits in the tight places.
B005VU96ZE|4|Works just as good as I thought
B0007ZL174|4|Exactly what I wanted and it was very easy to install.
B00HAPKY5O|5|Great deal, saved me a bundle of money!
B009FU7KHM|5|Excellent Damper. Got rid of the &#34;wandering & wobble&#34; from the worn out OEM damper. Very smooth steering now on my 2000 F250.
B00537FBIG|5|Very well built, and made in the USA. installation was a breeze.
B00D99RMPK|3|Ni had to force-fit the two front ones. The rest were perfect!
B0027XYKZO|5|Fit like a glove and very durable.
B003KS59WI|5|Love it so much. Perfect match for my wrx.
B00RV83UUG|5|cool
B0030CBIPQ|5|This is the only one that I have tried that works well with a motorcycle.  The 90 degree feature is a must!
B001CF1A7O|5|It's a receiver hitch with a D ring, not much to add. It's a chunk of steel, but it seems very strong and has quality paint.
B0023V9C2Q|5|AAAAA+++++
B00D8WQT20|1|It's was broken upon arrival and the last one known to man so it could not be replaced  so I had to return it with my wife's matching helmet
B00068OQF6|5|nice
B00J3QM4SS|1|It's a faulty batch. Would give random activation of the alarm without cause.<br />Did a check on the website, found the batch number belongs to faulty group.
B00T7GYGRQ|5|[[VIDEOID:bb4b78184e00d40c00c0717bd5178975]] Light bars change the whole feeling of driving in the woods at night and make it safer, but are also a relatively cheap way to add dramatic landscape lighting or light up tight spaces like attics.  My interests are mainly the latter, and this light bar does an excellent job.  It is super bright and the angle lights up a wide area rather than the tight directional beam that some create.  The design and build quality are high, with metal fins to keep things cool and it feels surprisingly solid for the price.  I see that some people have issues with broken LEDs, but all mine are functional so far.  I will update my review if any stop working.<br /><br />Thank you to the company for a review unit.  It looks like this is the company to go with when I purchase more.
B00ZPBQEZE|5|4 piece auto trim removal set. Made of nylon. Strong and durable. Not flimsy and did not break or bend with use. Able to use on exterior and interior trim. The basic four pieces to remove moldings, body trim, upholstery and door panels. Appears to be strong and quality product.<br /><br />This set was sent as a sample for my unbiased review.
B004SI7JOU|5|This was a perfect replacement for my broken power mirror. It fit perfectly and hooked up just like the factory mirror
B0002NYBA0|5|Great tool and really good quality. Should last long time for average DIY.
B00QR5ZKE8|5|Good thank you
B000C19DNM|5|fit just perfect no problem at al very satisfied
B003L358WI|5|Top rated. Worth the extra couple bucks for a filter that will last a year with top quality oil.
B004I0J9VY|3|I bought this because the wires going into my existing light were sheared off during off roading.  Quality is good, problem is it doesn't come with the complete wiring harness (male and female), which made it worthless for my problem.  The sheared wires were on the male piece.
B0049CNWN2|5|everything went great
B001YIYG8Y|5|The Shiki CA3199 Triple Chrome Reservoir covers are manufactured with very nice quality, the fit is perfect. These covers are well crafted with excellent (mirror like) chrome finish and the supplied cap screws are the finishing touch. I have a hydraulic clutch reservoir as well as my rear brake reservoir so I purchased two of the he Shiki CA3199 Triple Chrome Reservoir covers. I highly recommend these for anyone who owns and rides a M109R and wants some extra bling....
B000BROATE|5|everything went great
B00YNLYMLA|4|Put in hubbies BMW and so far, all is good. No indentations on his seat and it does not move around! :)
B0067UDF5O|5|Fits great on 2003 Audi A4, had it on for about 3 weeks now and no issues.
B00CXADGQ0|5|Very bright LED units.  Do the job perfectly.
B000CITAM4|5|Very good quality.
B002K5WXXU|5|It's awesome
B000IZ1JHA|5|amazing deal
B000VB0ZYY|5|Got it fast and exactly what I needed and their support line was also great
B001NYLKCY|5|Perfect fit for my 2006 325i BMW
B009DJKSB0|5|I received the ignition coil set quickly, installed them, and they continue to work.
B00JWZJSQ6|5|Perfect
B000C9CC1E|5|Ordered this part to fix a problem i was having with the heat only coming out of the floor vents in my 95 GMC Sierra. The one i received looked slightly different, the circuit board is smaller than the original, but is an exact fit. This one looks like its constructed a little better with less brittle parts and more compact. This part is a great price compared to other retailers and such an easy fix, took me 5 mins, to get everything working properly again. Completely satisfied with this part and would recommend it to anyone trying to breathe life back into their Heating and A/C.
B00UA142LW|4|I liked everything about the product except for the black cases. It seemed like a cheap plastic and began to crack by the screws even with very little pressure to hold the case down. Other than that, it looks really nice and bright on my Ram Sport even in the daytime.
B009OBVS2K|4|I'm going to have to work at these water spots!  I've removed some but this is going to take some work!
B00843V6KI|5|My wife love it!
B003QVJ79K|5|Great price and replacement
B007PRPY70|2|It worked well when we first bought cause my son was smaller. As he grew it didn't work as well. We ended up modified it to use as a seat belt on the back seat and works much better now.
B00RGZWIW0|5|I show antique cars and this will be great for all the cleaning stuff I use. Great product. I like how it expands
B00496MD60|1|This part did not fit our 2009 Acadia contrary to the description
B00429NKWK|5|Best headlight kit on the market.  My headlights were like new.
B00IZX1VF2|4|Great seat covers! High quality material, well constructed design, good fit and finish. I have a set of these in my 2008 Nissan Titan and they really look sharp.  The only gripe I have is the passenger seat has a carve out for a captains chair swing up arm rest which my rig doesn't have. The lack of arm rest creates a blank area in the seat cover  on the passenger seat sidewall. I couldn't find a option for a cover that didn't have this carve out so I settled for it.  Not a big deal but at this price point you expect perfection.<br />Overall Coverking is the best. and I am very happy with these seat covers.
B00AN6CQ4Y|5|This is a great mat.  High quality and significantly cheaper than the other after market mats available
B00523AMBC|1|Please do yourself a favor and save the $40-$50 that this things costs.<br /><br />It's been about 2 months that I've owned this 'filter'.  Here are my primary complaints:<br /><br />1. The hose fittings are all plastic, cheap plastic.  This thing ALWAYS leaked.  Different hoses, nope. Teflon tape, Nope.  Just always leaked.<br />2. Unstable.  Be prepared to build some kind of contraption to hold this upright (or it leaks worse). It got annoying how hard it was to keep this upright.<br />3. The hose that comes with it is also junk.  It leaked right from the second I started using it.  I ended up replacing it a high quality hose with all SS fittings.<br /><br />Unfortunately once it's outside of the return window you're stuck with a door stop.
B000UODGIY|5|Perfect!!  Our friends had these while camping, and we had to have them too!!! Waiting to go camping again to use them.
B000IY66R4|5|Fit perfect, looks like good quality.
B00DVWK7YI|5|Cool Cat! Thanks! :-)
B00SP286RE|5|I had not yet put this on my car so I do not know how strong it is. But it looks great  and the textureseems to be a  good and strong  kind. Color looks great I would definitely recommend
B000EQQVP8|5|Seomthing was rattling, so I started to replace parts and did these as well, no more rattling and happy with the purchase.
B003S8TLUG|3|Beautiful covers, but if you have an armrest, it won't work for you.
B007Q92GT6|5|Holds a lot of CDs. Very sturdy.cd case
B00CMX20H4|4|Loud enough but not a whole lot louder than stock. I'd say it's more the pitch and harmonics of the horn that cause other drivers to notice. I'd say it is maybe 1-2 decibels louder than the stock, single-tone horn, but the harmonics of the dual tone make it far more piercing.
B0040D0Q52|5|good quality, works as expected.
B003CJG7EY|5|5star
B008Y2KVXW|4|SUPER quick and easy to install. Well made.
B000JHVRHO|1|Too small, this tool was built to clean toy hotwheel  cars. it is a total waste of money and time. the blow gun and tube are a total of 8 inches long and you will get very dirty from the blowby  or whatever you are trying to clean. my opinion - This is not for automotive use
B000IG1T06|1|Tore right out of the box
B00J5KRUHM|5|Nice size ,sturdy
B004RCPBUQ|5|works good .
B00SXIQP4G|5|I'm very happy with this gauge set.  It arrived on time as the seller stated.  It has a nice sturdy case to hold the gauge and hoses.  If I should need anything else I would definitely buy from this seller.  I highly recommend this seller.
B00Q563TYM|5|It's a little on the small side but I have tint on the rear window of my truck so it still shows up clearly. Also I can actually see through it fairly well when I look in my rear view mirror.
B003JIEWF4|5|Great product
B00SW76LJ2|5|Put on my lawn mower very bright just one is all I needed
B00CHCPT32|4|Installs in seconds. Super cheap price. Provides more of a view than my stock Suzuki DR 650 mirrors and they weigh less. Downside is that they stick out beyond the handlebars. If you ride narrow trails, this may be a problem.
B0002SRGXY|5|MADE IN THE USA!!!  Really nice quality ball joint press for the price.
B007OSL3DY|5|Tailgate theft on the rise in your city? Buy this little lock and decrease your chances of waking up to a truck without a tailgate. Simple remedy.
B00017YYI6|3|Everything works fine on the compressor but the controller part may need some teflon tape around the threads to keep from an air leak over all pretty good product I don't think I would buy it again I would get a Different controller system
B0031I1ZUW|4|Nice quality, fast shipping
B008CE0W5Y|4|looks good very bright the wiring harness had to be cut to fit my truck but not bad will buy for all trailers I get for sure
B00O5MVIXM|1|Honestly, garbage.  It is designed poorly, so the license plate hangs tilted all the time.<br /><br />Spend more money, get a better unit.
B00FMV0WFA|5|perfect for organizing you center console
B00OU5LOT2|4|i got this product and happy with the install on my 2010 ranger but when I ran an extension wire that wire was either broke or just did not work cause it got no power I switched it out for another one on the same plug in and it worked fine. Colors look good and I only needed 2 LED stripes cause my truck is so small
B003TTL0TE|5|feels good and great quality also really good for new cars,
B00LF0Z5NG|1|NOT IS NICE
B00AQFE3RA|5|Easily bolts to the roll bar of a jeep, and with a 10lb Co2 bottle, will fit under the top (at least on my 2014 Rubicon). It does secure the hold down straps for the bottle with rivets that should be covered or padded or they will scratch your bottle, You can also bolt it through a fender wall or wheel well or to other places in your vehicle. Once the hold down straps are adjusted, the bottle is rock solid and does not move, nice and secure!<br />Nicely made, light but sturdy, perfect.
B0007ZL174|5|Works perfectly.  Easy install.
B00DBEPK8E|5|Fast shipping great product
B00SKIA2NO|5|It came out together just as the picture shows. I actually wanted to do it myself and thought that's what was being sold. However, it came complete minus the battery compartment. I will install in a box and add the battery.  Great build!
B008JENY2K|2|Ive bought two of these scanner and both power switcdhs broke with the most delicate care. Most of the software is incomplete and you will be lucky to diagnois a minibike. It has no emission readiness status. Some features are complete where I give it a B plus rateing but overall don't<br />buy it it Extremly poor English translation and hacks which is laughable.amd every car you scan you will see a pop up Software may not be complete
B000UOC360|1|Worst belt ever. It squeals like there is a bad bearing. Thinking there was a bearing going bad I wasted money on a new idler pulley. When the squeal didn't go away I put the old worn belt back on and all was quiet again. I would have returned this belt had it not taken me so long to figure out it was the belt making all the noise. I guess I just keep it as a spare now.
B000BUQOG8|5|Allows me to charge my Nissan Leaf with a regular 120V RV plug.
B0002RNSKK|1|This was placed on a 2014 Audi SQ5 with a 7/6 Pin connector.<br /><br />The reverse side of this image will show the connection that attaches to the SUVs receptical.  Note that some of the pins are missing.  My SQ5's computer would not accept this connection.  Though it fit in the reciptical, and the trailer lights were working, the dashboard was full of alarms and warning sounds.  For example, the parking sensor kept warning me of an approximatey alarm, the braking  system was warning that the trailer btakes were malfunctioning, and the turn system indicator was reporting a malfunction.  I return it to Amazon for a full refund.  I replaced it with a product manufactured by Reese, and the Audi's computer accepted it without any issues.
B00DJE3RSG|3|Did not send the one that on the picture but did send a black one but I am glade they send the wrong one for I had to modify it to fit my 1980 xj 650 and I new this when a bought the wrong one did fit better then the one in the picture would of and I love it
B003VLBPJA|4|I use this on my commuter bicycle for strapping extra gear and clothing to my top pannier. It works well and holds great. The only complaint I have about this netting is I wish they would melt the end of the bungee cord. I have seen them fray over time if you don't have the nylon melted just a little bit.
B00MSAOUF6|1|We put it on our vehicle. It peeled off in two days because of the sun and heat. Waste.
B004IU240M|3|Purchased for our camping trips. Does not fold well enough to be a space saver, stiff seat. Bulky after closing. the caps were loose had to add some electrical tape to the metal to make the plastic caps stay on tighter. Not worth the money.
B0042Z0LEO|4|This drying towel is incredible.  I dried my jeep grand cherokee and M4 and the towel barely felt wet.  Even though I have no need for a second because it works so well I kind of want one!   updating this review: towel now leaving significant lint on cars. subtracted one star for this.
B00MIDY1VQ|5|Went on good and easy
B00KZJQ2L2|5|WONDERFUL!  I thought it was going to be too large but it fits my '11 Toyota Sienna Minivan perfectly!  Easy to close (tip: hold the side with the strap in your right hand as you twist it closed, then it's in the perfect place to strap it closed.  If you do it opposite, the strap will be on the inside and you can't strap it closed).  I HIGHLY recommend this shade. It keeps the car SO much cooler in the 100°+ Texas heat. It's also made of a very durable material and seems like it will last a really long time.  Road Charms even emailed me to see if I needed anything or had any questions. They gave me a personal email if I needed anything in the future. Very impressed.
B00A6AS6LY|5|Couldn't be any cleaner & easier to use.
B00QGPTAXQ|5|Nice quality but was unable to install due to the rubber gaskets were too big.
B000NTL3SQ|5|This worked great on my 2004 f150 lariat. Easy to install. Quick shipping
B000GU5IH4|4|GREAT QUALITY. A BIT SMALL FOR MY HONDA SHADOW AERO.
B00HG4CPN8|5|Exact fit! And shipping was really fast!
B00TA4MNYS|3|Have only used to charge phone and iPad. Charge Indicator lights seem to go down fairly fast. Not sure if it would actually jump start a vehicle
B00192JFI6|5|Great keeps the bees out
B003JLDQNK|4|Now that I have traveled over 3000 miles with this bag, I can say that it is OK.  I would  have liked a deeper pocket on the lid for my cell phone and reading glasses.  My extra face shield nestles nicely into the front curve of the bag, and it's big enough for all my other necessities.
B000S2UGWC|5|Worked great on 2008 Chevy Tahoe. Very easy to get out other one and replace
B00336TW6Q|5|I don't know a thing about cars, I am thankful this product was what I needed and I was able to install myself , saving lots of money .
B008CE0TN4|5|Works great for towing my 14 Jon boat around from lake to lake
B00G52H7YE|5|Gotta love 'em. Hopefully these will last as long as the originals on my truck! It will save me money in the long run over the after market versions. They're already assembled with the clips so installation is ridiculously simple.
B009AA2FAY|5|The part was perfect and I installed it  with no problems
B008427D88|5|Worked fine no issue on 2009 HOnda Civic EX
B007WIB4B2|5|looks great! can't believe how inexpensive it was
B004GI0EHG|3|I like it!  As advertised!
B00B78764M|5|This is a nice refreshing scent.  It does not affect my allergies.
B00XAX4B9A|5|It's a very good quality and easy to instal sun shade. We use it for our BMW 5 and it fits great. Now it's not so scary to open the car after the day on the beach. Thank you guys!
B00C6R1P6I|2|did not work as described
B0083Y0WL2|4|This light is bright! Worked perfect on a trailer I repainted. Now it's safer, legal, and looks good.
B00FSO9ZE0|5|Love it
B0023VGW1K|5|Awesome product.  No issues.
B00NCTS7P6|1|No, Zero. I've never dropped it and it broke by where you put the charger in. I tried to to contact them about any type of warranty because I've had it less than a month. No response. Don't use them
B00NJH5YXE|5|Perfect
B00943LUMG|5|easy to put on and works great!
B00D60YJP8|5|Works awesome
B001MYU9PE|4|No surprise works great right out of box
B004RNR9QY|4|Very high quality, affordably priced
B001BDSRTG|5|As described. Easy to install. Didn't notice much of a difference in power but throttle control seemed better
B00EE1JM82|5|Perfect compliment to the commissioner. If you want loud clarity, this is the one.
B007KOC1MO|1|We followed instructions on how to use product scratches are still there !  I am not satisfied with product
B006GLA8TA|4|Product is as described , but a little lower quality than I expected.
B00P3IAYSC|5|Great product makes holding boat onto trailer easier and faster.
B00CTR9WTC|5|Item as described, worked well, shipped quickly, A+ transaction
B00K63FST4|1|It didn't work because it would not fit my jaguar fob...
B00DQ9XDOM|5|Just what I wanted
B009B9QRQ2|5|I have one of these all my vehicles.
B00BU61GPG|5|Fits well. Not heavy. Very happy with purchase.
B00GKTZCPI|3|Colors fade fast.
B00080QHMM|5|works as it should
B006CR451A|5|Cheap price nice distributor
B00XYQWXBQ|5|Good quality. Works great!
B001FKPFR2|4|Fits perfecto on my Mini Cooper, clubman
B004PYI888|5|GREAT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE
B001O0BJUK|5|excelent
B004YR49R0|5|Worked like a charm. Followed detailed instructions included. Easy installation. Removed one screw & unsnapped old switch from door, snapped in the new one & re-installed the screw.  Easy, peasy. Daughter actually did the installation herself w/out help.
B0027A0V1E|5|This was my first big car repair that I finally decided to try myself, and save $450.<br /><br />I have a 2005 Ford Escape V6.<br /><br />This set has worked perfectly so far! Pretty straight forward install on the engine, I did have one extra of the screw gaskets (it comes with 22, I used 21). These slid right in, and fit perfectly to the shape of the valve covers.
B004HCOE8Q|3|OK
B00RVOJ20W|5|Very nice compact starter. Used it in Africa and amazed many people as to how it works.
B000VKRQDI|4|Nicely built filter fit fine and works very well.
B003V1AH4E|5|Came in in a reasonable amount of time looks good works good
B003VAV50U|5|Delivered promptly/  Exactly what I needed.
B000QJJ4IO|5|[[ASIN:B000QJJ4IO Flowmaster 942545 Super 44 Muffler - 2.50 Center IN / 2.50 Center OUT - Aggressive Sound]]<br /><br />This made my son's jeep much quieter when I want it quiet and cool sounding when he wants it that way!  Thank you sooo much!
B000SKV4U2|4|best oil
B00BZSE5CK|5|Excellent product, shipping was a little longer than expected, but it was a gift to a new Jeep owner who greatly appreciated the item.
B00FR222FC|5|Works great!
B000EEU0KM|2|Vibration on areas that could use it except for the middle of your back which only provides heat.  Uncomfortable to sit on when it's not on &#34;massage mode&#34; since it digs into your legs or your spine.  Good enough for the price.
B0002UNON8|4|ok
B00FUTAB00|1|It is  worts, just  work one week in my Car
B00CB8WM2S|5|I hope I never have to use the Car Hammer.  I recommend everyone buy one, it might save your life or someone else's life.
B00VNG4Q3M|5|Great item and good service by supplier...
B000PWV19C|5|My mechanic was impressed when I asked him to install it (haven't had my car that long, so I've never changed the air filter!). It has definitely improved my gas mileage!
B001810SHA|5|Charged up my 2007 Ford Expedition EL Limited (5.4L 3v v8) to &#34;arctic freeze&#34;!<br /><br />I was very low on R134a and eventually used 24oz to fill up the system on my truck. I now ride in comfort!<br />I use the dye pack bottle first, but didn't have any leaks, so I moved on to the second bottle.<br /><br />Some tips and notes<br />DO NOT OVERFILL, hurts AC performance and removing refrigerant requires professional equipment negating the cost savings of DIY.<br /><br />1. Take your time. I filled 3-5 pounds then took the car for a ride turning the A/C on and off few minutes at a time. This produced more accurate reading on the gauge. (my prior attempt to fill without doing this resulted in the gauge reading 45psi when I filled it up and reading 55psi the next day and I had to call my A/C guy to come pull some R134a from the system using his EPA approved recovery tank/hookup, thankfully he didn't charge me.<br />2. Don't overfill and vent it to atmosphere, keep the planet green
B004K9BIY4|5|This item is great  It is beautifully finished and certainly works.  I'm very happy with it.
B00KTIA9EK|1|I replace the battery twice and now it won't even program to my truck waste of money
B00H2YGMK4|5|This looks great on my car
B00766GS0C|5|Exactly what I expected. 👍
B005HJFKEA|5|Fits turbo pipe coming from intercooler but it is not long enough or flexible enough to fix between throttle body and intercooler pipe..It's made of a soft rubber without any fiber reinforcement. It can be stretched a bit if needed.
B000AL8VD2|5|excellent products
B00LACISZG|5|Came quickly, easy to install, works great.  I don't have a sunroof but I don't hear much wind noise below 60mph.  There is a whistle when you get faster but it is easily drowned out by the stereo.  I've had 2 kayaks on it numerous times and it seems to easily handle that weight.  Very sturdy.  The only negative I can come up with is that when it's wet and I have the window open water runs off the front mount and drips in the car.
B0002UQATS|4|good stuff
B00XK43P1E|5|Although I hope to never have to use it, this emergency light is the best I have seen.
B009B07YYK|1|Save your money don't buy!! Not even close to oem
B002FY28OU|5|Thank you
B000CSW3SM|4|Good
B002QH206W|5|good
B005LGTSMO|1|End connection was not right. It would not fit.
B00HWFOYQ2|5|Nice!
B00KY0ND7I|5|Took it to my mechanic and it was a perfect fit for my 2001 oldsmobile silhouette.  Started right up again. Half the price of the local retail auto parts stores! I am thrilled!
B00BLSYDX0|5|Worked perfectly
B0067UM852|3|A little stiff on the turn signal and will stop working from time to time.
B004F7SCIG|5|I added Mustang 50th Anniversary Logo added for additional cost but what Covercraft doesn't make very clear is the logo comes in BLACK as standard for all of the covers save for black colored fabric.  The logo then only comes in white in order to contrast the black colored cover.<br /><br />Other than that, the cover is a dream to put on and take off.  Material is superb
B002IWYFVS|5|Looks great, and is almost actual size of a real claymore
B00KLIWMCU|5|Works really well. Easy to store. Really happy with it!
B001LHVOVK|3|It's an odb2 tool.  Just get a Bluetooth reader and OBD APP
B005XOZ29C|4|excellent
B004NA63V8|5|fit and looks good
B000BZJ744|5|OEM Bosch quality.
B003C508XO|5|The long delay function is great and works as specified.  Note:  It will only connect/supply 12v - nothing greater or less than that and certainly not AC (though it would be great if it did).
B00SC85CGY|5|Bought as a gift and it was perfect!
B00S20958S|5|This was an anniversary gift, and it was perfect!!!
B000BVQ7YG|2|these covers don't fit my seats.... 2015 Chevy Trax
B00E9HWSV4|4|mat fits great in my 2014 jetta, required some trimming and works great. the only concern is it has an smell to it (would not want this as a car matt in the front of the car) works great in the trunk
B001FRPXS6|5|Fits perfectly
B00XQDEQSU|3|You get your money's worth - they were not expensive, they are thin and lightweight, but do the job.<br />I don't care for the waffle weave when wearing shorts - live and learn!!
B00ELHNM3K|5|I have a Generac natural gas generator that requires 5w30 full synthetic.  Although it only take 1.9 quarts, the price of this oil was so good I couldn't pass it up.  I now have enough for 4 years of generator maintenance and oil changes.  It is very easy to pour as well as the spout sticks out.
B008G2CSSG|5|ship fast and they fit perfectly.
B00030DLEE|5|Arrived on time and great quality
B001TM8WYO|5|perfect fit, color, and half the price or ordering through dealership.  and this replacement doesn't stick like my old one did.
B000KBZN38|3|One side of main compartment zipper can't close completely because part of the zipper is sewn down too far into a seam. A little more than an inch at the end of the zipper is affected. Also the magnets seem kind of wimpy. I have a Joe Rocket Manta tank bag that is half the volume, but the magnets are twice as big. For a very brief moment I thought about just swapping magnets between bags but the magnets are sewn in place on the RT bag, whereas on the Manta they are in Velcro closure pockets.
B003L763ZU|5|Works perfect!
B00COYNVPQ|5|made it fit on my Honda Accord '15, love it.
B001NZMBV2|5|Well made and fit perfect.
B00FNP3YBE|4|Good product
B0047MQ8ZS|5|My second pair.... I love em! I have the yellow lensed ones for day riding & clear lenses for night (or in poor viz situations). Great for the price & fit over my glasses perfectly. They even manage to look cool, especially for &#34;over the glasses&#34; goggles. I highly recommend these. Do they keep ALL of the wind out? No. But for the price you just can't beat em, & you won't look like a douche.
B00ONHDYUY|5|Perfect fit
B008K925II|5|Great!
B002JV0W74|1|Doesn't fit the ZL1 even though this product is the result of searching &#34;2013 Camaro ZL1 sunshade&#34;
B0083CJAOO|4|I wish that button were cigaret lighter is, will turn on and off, or some kind or flashing depending on what preset is or if is on or off, that reddish button don't turn on at all, I purchased 2 of this and they both don't come on, other than that is pretty cool
B006B23GSE|3|Will this fit a kawasaki eliminator 900 year 85 you description is a bit confusing
B007QV5U7Y|5|Exactly what I wanted
B004UVP90Q|1|I bought this to operate a 110V solenoid valve.  However, it did not work at all at 110V after cutting the wire as instructed.  I also tested it with a 40W light bulb as a load.  That did not work either.  I ordered the genuine ICM relay link: [[ASIN:B000LDGFL4 Relay, Time Delay]], made in USA.  That ICM relay worked exactly as I had intended.  So this particular Packard PTD102 relay that I received, made in China, was cleary defective.
B004AIHKT2|5|needed it
B000EQPC6M|5|I bought to sets of these style brake pads ... one set for my Honda Accord, and another for my Honda Odyssey. They have been on my vehicles for about 2 months, and they work well, and sound nice (very quiet).
B006WQ7WQ6|5|It worked beatifully!! Did not move on the roof and stayed very secure!!
B00C0SQEQY|5|I normally wear tinted prescription glasses in the sun.  They are polarized though and do strange things behind the Shoei clear wind screen.  I ordered the OZG one so I could keep my clear lenses on.  It is every bit as nice as the Shoei original and looks really cool.  It was easy to install and seals well.  Save yourself the money and buy this one.
B0002UQATS|5|Love it, goes on and comes off easy, better yet try it with an orbiter .
B00282YGA8|4|The product was good, the shipping was great, BUT: Be sure when you order this that you do NOT have<br />a 2008 GMC Acadia with a spoiler on the back top. The wiper blade will fit but it will not work. The spoiler<br />makes the height of the window shorter so the blade will hit the spoiler and lock up. Other than that the<br />buy was great.
B00480GY0S|5|The best
B00UQJJSFS|2|looks good but a bit small for my silverado, would prolly look better on a ranger or tacoma size truck
B001IH8Q0A|5|Easy to install.
B000772HVQ|5|Good looking heavy-duty chrome-plated license plate frame. I have had two on my truck for 18 years and they have held up extremely well. My only criticism is the blue and gold paint fades a bit with time. They use to sell these in the Navy Exchange, but no longer. I know where to get my next ones: Amazon.com. Highly recommended!
B000CON75Y|5|Awesome shocks great price

B00CS7T0IQ|5|Solid mirrors, they stay adjusted and don't move much during rough rides.
B005FKT6PA|5|Wasn't to sure what to expect when I first ordered,I read the reviews, figured I'd take a chance,when I got them I put them on my car,looked good,went out and broke them in like I was supposed to, felt a bit spongey on the slow stops not much grip, but on the harder stops they had very good grip,but now that I've had them on the car for about a month there not spongey any more on the slow stops guess they just had to break in some more,it takes me a little less then an hour to drive to work everyday and it's mostly driving between 50 to 75 mph with alot of stop lights along the way so there's alot of hard stops ,about the only thing I can say is this brake kit is the best I've ever had on any car I've owned ,stops my car quicker the any other brake rotor combo I've ever tried ,so sofar Im happy with them but like I said I've only had them on my car for about a month,but sofar better then I expected!!!
B0015D19SS|1|Piece of junk, especially for the cost. Stupid me threw the box away when I received the rack. It wasn't till I went to use it the next week that I realized what junk it really was. Would have returned it if I had kept the box.
B00NP60URE|5|Awesome!

B0084UJJ78|5|These mud flaps were a perfect fit for my 2013 Silverado. They were also very easily installed in about 30 minutes using a few tools that most folks have around the house. For the front set, you have to remove 2 hex head screws and 2 plastic clips along the fender, and install back using the same hardware with the exception of one bolt & nut supplied. The rear set are even easier to Install, they attach with twist locks attached to the flaps. There is no drilling required, and any hardware required is supplied. I am very particular about how my vehicle looks, and I am very pleased with how they offset the look of the truck. As far as function goes, they will be adequate for their intended purpose. Anyone looking for a good looking set of flaps that requires no drilling with easy installation, I highly recommend these.
B00K0VMXDQ|5|This is a very good product.  Works great very small so you can store it anywhere. The storage case is handy also.

B00HEB2XEO|5|Ordered 2 of these to repair my 2004 mountaineer, I was glad to see they were thick metal and not plastic. These are universal and work on either side. Didn't take me longer than 5 minutes to put on both sides.

B000C3F3HK|5|Everything for install was included. High quality aluminum. My pop up camper will love this, and so will my trans.
B00ANZHG7C|5|These are perfect for my floors, kitchen and bathroom, etc.  Not too thin or thick and wash up nicely on delicate/low heat in the washer and dryer.
B0007ZAJRM|4|I have a 94 town car that used to be my grandmothers.  It has the infamous &#34;rumble&#34; when the torque converter tries to lock in around 40-50mph.  I added this about 50 miles ago and I have noticed the rumbling has reduced and sometimes does not happen at all when it used to.  I think I need to give it some more time to fully condition the fluid as others have mentioned it takes a few miles of driving to get full benefit.
B00RGZWIW0|5|Most affordable and sturdy. Love the fact that it can fold up and be clipped closed when not in use.
B00230EAOW|5|Motion Pro lubricants are the way to go.
B00VIVGRS4|3|Review of this device vs. the LB1 High Performance 600Amp Portable Battery.  For more detail on LB1, see my review on that device.  This appealed because it had very high MAh.  When I received it, I noticed that the included instructions were nearly non-existent, but I suppose most things can be figured out intuitively.  The one thing I could not get working was the flashlight on blinking / SOS display.  I held down the button and the light turned on, and held down to turn off, but no other combination I tried made it blink. Hitting the button two times fast makes the red & blue LEDs alternate.  The LB1 has flashlight and blink/SOS mode and a red row of flashing LEDs that all work as expected.  This is a pretty nice battery, supposedly holds about 5% less power, but costs 25% less and it a bit smaller.  But what I really did not like about it was that it has a slider switch and then just one button.  The button is used to check how much power is left (which uses these blue LEDs that 'bleed' over badly), but hitting it again will change it from 12 to 16 to 19 volts.  Plus of course the light that it controls.  I help thinking that one could easily be charging a laptop and hit the button to check the battery status and inadvertently change the voltage.  The LB1 is far preferred for it's digital readout of battery remaining and voltage.  The compressor was good; its gauge reads up to 150 PSI and it had no problem doing my bicycle tire past 90.  Compare to the other one which was smaller, had a very short air cord, and only reads up to 80 psi; when got to 80 filling my bike tire, it shut off.  But attempting to use either on a car tire that already had 37 psi, it seemed to gain only VERY slowly if at all. On a tire that had only 20-25 lbs, they both filled to 40, but HyperPS took about 5 minutes and the LB1 took closer to 15 or more.  If you intend to use the compressor quite a lot, this model wins over LB1.  Although I did not care to kill my battery (using Toyota Tacoma), I disconnected it and tried to jump using each.  Both batteries performed the same, able to start the car more times than I cared to try (about a half dozen) without noticeable battery drain.  Starting was not what I would call &#34;peppy&#34;; the battery has much better cold cranking amps of course.  But they both worked fine.  Both include many adaptors, some differences:  HyperPS: A bag a phone adaptors, most of which look like they belong to long-obsolete phones. Old iPhone adaptor, but not new, Micro USB but not Mini.  Several round 12 volt / Laptop adaptors (but one appeared to be missing).  Lack of new iPhone or Mini USB likely not so important since you can plug in anything of your own to the USB out.  LB1: One USB-to-phone with new iPhone, old iPhone, Micro & Mini USB.  Several round 12 volt / Laptop adaptors.  Winner for me LB1, because I am not concerned about the slightly larger size or price, and I like the power readout as I will largely be using it to supplant power for my mobile bluetooth speaker.  I like the adaptors better, but the compressor, though smaller, is slower, at least on car tires.  LB1 also just seems a bit more thoughtfully constructed.
B00OC6Z3H8|5|Works great looks good and seams to be a good quality light not plastic junk
B0070W7M6G|5|Excellent steering box, this is an upgraded design from stock according to Cardone. They have a video on youtube showing the improvements. Search: cardone super duty steering.

B002NEV33O|1|This product does not fit the 2009 Nissan Altima S as stated by the Amazon.com website. Found out the hard way after opening the dash and seeing the mismatch in size (this product was shorter by 2 1/2&#34;). What a pain in the ...? Ordered the proper item and will do it all over again.
B002MQQLAI|5|This was a perfect fit for our Chevy Cobalt
B003UVCY00|5|Love the light, powerful beam and recharges quickly.
B0000AYFTV|4|easily rewired my 9ft utility trailer
B007CLAGQI|4|GOOD PRICE and Paint was shipped very fast.. I FORGOT to shake it before applying and color wasn't fully blended (my bad), small spots covered up fine... bigger spots were bit darker than original paint I would imagine to due fading over the years, after sanding it will probably look alright. I was happy to be able to cover up the missing paint spots on my car we'll see how good it looks after I am finished sanding and polishing
B00192QSVS|2|The holes do not line up.
B00LGX8RQ4|5|I received shipment timely.  Wheel arch molding was easy to install and looks great.  Hopefully these will help prevent door dings

B009IQAO9Y|5|recommended item and recommeded seller.
B005DJ3ZS2|5|Great item as advertised
B006QZJZRC|5|An excellent value kit for setting up your carburetors from street mild -to- track spec.<br />Just be careful to not follow all of the instructions to the letter without knowing what you are doing.  If you drill into the slide and cut the springs that go above the diaphragm, you will get excellent throttle response but will make the bike far less &#34;streetable&#34; if you use it for anything other than track work.<br />Same goes for the washers on top of the slide pins.<br />It is not a kit for beginners - but if you think about what you're doing and don't blindly rush into it, you'll be glad you got this kit.<br />I had an issue with an idler jet that wasn't drilled and the seller resolved the problem without complaint or hassle. Thank you.
B00BCU60LK|5|Love the helmet fits perfect and very low profile. Does lift up a lil bit at high speeds but I just tilt my head down a bit,
