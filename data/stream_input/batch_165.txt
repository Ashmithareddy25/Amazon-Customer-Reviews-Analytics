B002KCMSPQ|5|My husband and I are new parents, our little girl is only 5 weeks now, but we have been sold on these!!  My sister in law gave us a pack at our shower and we've been finding places to purchase them ever since she came into this world! They are only worth the money if you don't throw them out until they are actually wet or soiled, but they allow for very quick clean ups and are great for outside the house.
B008K3YVW2|1|The ottoman broke very soon. Wood splintered and fell apart exposing sharp nails (can't really see it in the picture because it's on the left side where the wood actually split, not just fell apart where it was glued.) The chair itself does not squeak but it creaks... meaning, it's not the hinges down below, but it's the wood itself that supports the back of the chair. Everything else about this chair we love, it looks great and is the perfect size for us. We recently contacted the amazon about the warranty... and we're waiting to see what will happen.
B00GU4APL4|5|It arrived in a timely manner; was super easy to apply and adhered to the wall immediately! It has been up for about a month and is still totally stuck to the surface.
B001OC5UMQ|4|Easy to put up and it works great for kids 2 and under. My 3 year old has figured out how to open it already. Also, it only opens one way. I have another one that swings open both ways.
B009X4C3QS|5|We love it
B00B8YZ57U|5|The product is excellent. Exactly as expected. Will purchase again.
B000IDSLOG|5|We love, love, love Sophie. My son is four months old and I wish I'd had this for my other children. She isn't hard plastic like other baby toys, or fabric. He never took to those. The minute I gave him his giraffe, she was in his mouth. She really is just perfect - soft, chewable rubber with a nice little squeek. This will be my baby shower gift of choice from now on.
B0009OLSZ8|5|We had a purchased a couple of other types of potty chairs for our toddler and were disappointed in the size or fit.  This one worked great - in fact we got three - one for each of the grandparents' homes as well as the toddler's home.  Easy to clean, good fit, the best we found.
B00AZNWK3M|3|And there were only 99 pages in the package! A little darker blue than I expected. 4 more words required.
B007VBYVVA|5|i bought these to use as burp clothes and they are wonderful. they wash up very well and are great for all types of messes. once my baby doesn't need these anymore, i will definetly be keeping them for other uses!
B000MEB3GE|1|Never could figure out how to use it and neither could anyone else. VERY complicated.
B00BQYVQWU|5|IT WORKS GREAT CLEAR VIDEO AND SOUND . I USE IT FOR MY GRAUGE IT HAS BEEN BROKE IN TO NOW I CAN SEE AND HERE EVERY THING GOING ON OUT THERE.
B003ZC8B1K|5|I have so many carriers (moby, bjorn, babyhawk) but none are as easy to use and as versatile as the Gemini. I bought it for one reason: the ability to carry the baby forward facing (like the bjorn) but with his weight more evenly distributed to my hips. It is perfect. My son is now ten months and has moved to the back-carry position. After the first few times putting him on I mastered putting him on my back without any help. It is still so much more comfortable than any other carrier and I can carry him for a long time without getting too uncomfortable. I recommend this carrier to everyone I know with/expecting a baby.
B0041RRZ1U|3|After MUCH reasearch, I had purchased this bag, exactly 1 year ago, and only about 2 months after I had it, the small zipper in the front broke, completely.  The sewing came undone, and the front pocket could not be salvaged.  It makes me want to buy a whole new diaperbag because of it, because it was the cell phone pocket, now my things just fall out.  The fabric also seems cheap, though I have not had any rips yet on the outside, but the stitching from the outside small pocket did come undone, and things are falling through the hole somewhere, and ending up in the internal fabric of the diaperbag, between the layers.  (I hope that explains it)
B00013HDJM|4|I bought this when I had my newest!  I go on walks & jogs with my 2.5 year old and my now 2 month old - it works great!!! I like the canopy  - it can go above to block the sun or lately since its been chilly, I have put it down in front to block the cold wind from going in their faces.  The price was reasonable - lots of double joggers are much more expensive!
B00020L78M|3|We got it around Christms. Used it for the Christmas tree (at the time, children ages 5, 3, and 10 month old twins). Since then, we leave it in the den (collapsed, according style) and move it to wherever is needed (like the huge opening between our den and kitchen that no other affordable child gate can cover).<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />-It feels like I'm forcing the joints to open/close to adjust.<br />-With little movement it held up fine, but it now has a crack in it near one of the hinges(probably due to opening and closing it too quickly once?).<br />-It's a little difficult to connect the ends together.<br />-Moves when pushed (even by a scrawny 10 month old) unless ends are anchored in corners of something.<br /><br />What I do like:<br />-Enough room:  My friends and I had four 12 month olds in it at the park the other day with toys and snacks.<br />-Good for outside. Good for large/oddly shaped openings.<br /><br />I recommend it for:<br />light use (not put up and taken down a lot) and outdoor places.<br /><br />Might recommend it for:<br />heavy use (up and down a lot - like we do). It's 'good enough', but expect some wear and 'tear' (and then watch little fingers if it does)!<br /><br />I would NOT recommend it for:<br />destructive children or strong children (or pets), this is NOT the gate for you! Too easy to move or crack.
B00HVB36NE|4|Takes a few minutes to figure out how the thing works and does seem a little dim but I'm sure that the amount of light it provides is sufficient for the task at hand. I love that it vibrates as a reminder to switch or wake up which seems like a great feature.
B00005LIOY|5|I pick this design because if my baby girl gets here and is a baby boy I don't have to change my crib set.  And I already have animals up on the wall from my daughter who is 7 now and more into Barbie and makeup.
B005PBOQEA|4|Just what I expected for that price. I suggest stuffing them with a few blankets to give them a diaper bag square shape since they are flat when delivered.
B0045Y142K|4|Very sturdy, we've had ours for two years now and have no issues with it.  We did not put the rocker pieces on so it just sits flat on the floor.  My only complaint is that because it's microfiber, it stains easily.  I wish they had a leather/fake leather option, we'd replace it.  But that's something you just have to deal with when you buy microfiber, so we knew it might be an issue
B0070ZY80Q|4|i purchased this for my 2nd Fitbit One. my first Fitbit One accidentally fell out of my pocket and was run over by a car. (it still worked but the display no longer lit up and the super awesome folks at Fitbit gave a new one for free with minimal hassle aka a copy of the receipt from Amazon, where i originally purchased it) but I digress! this is definitely a must have for anyone with Fitbit.<br /><br />the end with the metal clip will attach on your clothes really well since its a bit like a suspenders clip? is that what it's called?<br /><br />and only 2 things that made me give the product 4 stars instead of 5. The leash has this website. triple w, pedometers usa dot com, printed out in white letters on one side of the black leash. its printed out twice so you can imagine that the leash portion is quite long. its kindof obnoxious looking to me so i just used a black sharpie to color all the leashes i got. but yeah i think the leash is a bit too long and that website ad is annoying but other than that. its a great little device
B00078EL5K|2|It is flimsy plastic. wont trust my child with this railing. Will not recommend buying this product. x x x
B0000DH5TU|5|This is the 3rd monitor we purchased. The previous 2 were much more expensive.  But we've found that because a lot of the cordless phones are 900 MHz now, they interfere with the baby monitors that are 900 MHz.  Our reception is very clear.  We love that there are two receivers so we can keep one upstairs and one downstairs.  Also, the lights are a big bonus.  Sometimes when I'm not sure if I heard the monitor because I'm far away from it, I can still see the lights.  Not sure why some reviewers would complain about hearing traffic and such on the monitor.  If you have a monitor that is sensitive enough to hear your baby breathing, then of course you're also going to pick up any background noise.  I'm happy to have a monitor that is that sensitive.  I think that's a good thing.  Believe me, if the baby is screaming I don't need a monitor to hear her.
B003WIYNZA|4|My husband found this stroller at our local baby store and tried it out with our 2 year old son. They both loved it! At the time we had the standard stroller and infant car seat set and although that stroller is great, has all the features one hand open/close, lots of storage etc...it's bulky.  The City Mini is great for it's size. It is very compact when folded up and once you figure out the trick is pretty easy to open and collapse. Having the 3 wheels, being the jogger style, this stroller is sooo easy to push. It glides over any surface. Also the versatility of sitting positions is amazing, it can go from laying almost perfectly flat to sitting straight up. I also love the fact that the piece of material between the back side and the cover is awesome, it's netted so it lets in lots of fresh air, but also comes with a cover for winter.  The only negative I can say is that this stroller has NO storage. there is a little basket under the seat but you can't get to it. there is no drink tray for our son, and no cup holder or anything. Major bummer since this stroller is way more versatile than just going out for a run. There is an after market insert you can purchase and we have it on order. I highly recommend this stroller. It's small but not tiny and wimpy, our son loves being in it so it must be comfortable, and the custom seat positioning is great.   Would have given 5 stars if it had either storage or a cup/bottle holder.
B0013KS8FU|2|I bought this for my son because he LOVES Darth Vader.  He still loves the design, but he doesn't like sleeping with it because he says that it's too &#34;itchy&#34;.  I think that it's not as soft as some other sheets.  He still loves Darth Vader and wants one that is more comfortable.
B000O7ULM6|4|SOFT!
B001QPA5S0|5|This placemat is easy to clean, cute, indestructible, and does not mold.  Drawback is that it is slippery but still works well for my 3 & 5 year old.
B003UCFX66|5|This was delivered quickly. It does have a smell, like opening a new shower curtain but they cover the carriage and keep the kids dry.
B0064CTIC4|5|Excellent product! A must buy to make baby's bath just perfect!
B0055V6M8S|2|Didn't really care for this product
B009K8NFG4|5|Great seat. Comfortable and fits over an elongated bowl. Allows your child to sit in so they cannot wiggle off. I have a girl but have older boys and this would block you from getting streamed.
B00FFSR9F6|5|I love love love Thirsties. I use them for my kids until they get to large because the large Thirsties are huge IMO
B0045I6IAY|3|These pacifiers are great, however, I just ordered two packages of the blue color and one came with small pin sized holes in the tips.  I didn't figure this out until my baby rejected one of the pacifiers and I noticed it made a whooshing sound when it was sucked on.  I stuck it in my own mouth and figured out that the hole was there when I sucked on it.  This was only the case for one of the two blue packages I bought and the older green colored ones I have do not have the holes in the tips, so I'm pretty sure this was a manufacturing issue with one package.  If a baby was to be left with a defective one they'd probably get a lot of air in their stomachs and be pretty unhappy.  So I recommend checking to make sure there are no holes before using.
B003A73S4K|5|I used this hat a lot, mainly when we where inside the pool. Protects very well baby's neck and shoulder. Totally recomend it.
B002J4U8M0|5|I bought this for my 1 month old daughter after reading the reviews.  I have no problem getting this mirror to stand on its own.  The reflection is a little bit like a fun house mirror but I would rather the reflection be a little distorted then the mirror be made out of real glass that could potentially hurt my child.  I put her in the crib with the mirror when I need to shower or get ready and I always find her looking at her reflection when I go back in her room.  I'm pretty sure for her perspective the reflection is not distorted.  I have had it for about a month and love it.  As she gets older I'm sure it will be a wonderful way for her to practice tummy time and I think she will love the cute bugs.  The frame is nice and soft so she can't bump her head and the material will wipe up nice and easy if she spits up on it.
B00HAT0KQS|4|I make and freeze all of my daughter's food and I have two of these. I use them all the time. The food is easy to pop out. Carrots stain though, so be prepared for that.
B000YDDF6O|5|This toy has been a favorite for both my kids. Great to take in the car seat or in the stroller.
B002XNGTUM|5|I like the product but it would be better to have a full length zipper from the edge to edge so it would be easier to change the cover without having a potential of breaking the zipper.
B00C7JW3WK|5|Love these diapers. Quality is great. Super impressed and will be ordering more, even though I bought 18 already
B00RP0GHBO|5|Amazing product might be the best thing out of all the products we got for our newborn
B001CWVYMI|2|We used this to carry our car seat and backpack. The shoulder strap ripped right off in the middle of the airport on first use.
B00GEF7CD8|5|Does not fit very well in our 08 Tahoe, have to put big pool noodles under to level then the front passenger has to sit uncomfortably close to dash.<br /><br />Car seat itself fits my child wonderfully, easy to loosen and tighten straps to fit snug. Very easy to convert to different stages and fit comfortably.
B000LFQ3GY|5|The toys are safe for babies to teeth on and have a wonderful folksy, natural, down to earth feeling. My daughter had a few when she was a baby, so I bought this and the fruit basket for my 4 month old sons first Christmas. I highly recommend them. They make great unique gifts too.
B001AXAD3K|5|Cute design, works as described, great packaging.
B00FXR5S20|5|I would have never thought I'd need something like this, but it is so useful! Was just using a cup before which is fine, but it's nice to have a handle when pouring. Plus it looks really cute!
B0071D1AKI|4|This makes a world of difference for little ones washing their hands. It would be impossible for my little one to use the sink even with a stool in her main bathroom with out this. I looked at very tall stools, but they could result in a bad fall AND they would allow her to turn water on and off (no thanks!). It is such a simple little thing, but it's works great. My only issue is that it's starting to get stretched out, but my daughter does play with it causing this. I would recommend this for anyone having trouble reaching the faucet.
B001TDLFJM|1|I really liked these bibs when I first recieved them...but they cracked within the first month of use :( I was really dissapointed and upset that I spent the money for these bibs that I only got to use a few times.
B00FSK1GCI|4|So far so good.  Glides very well.  Easy to attach folds out of the way when not needed.
B00E88Y9NE|4|Great for little ones.  I agree with other reviews that they are a little hard to fill.  If you use a small, baby spoon it works fine.
B00C2I1QS8|5|Exactly what is pictured.  Super cute and adorable for any gender!  We love using our G-diapers on our first born son!
B00C0KJ7ZW|3|You get what you pay for. This is not a 100 sling. It doesn't work like a $100 sling but I didn't pay that.
B007CTPY1M|3|A great little stroller. We tried this out but ultimately selected the City Select (Double stroller).
B006BHSAB2|5|A great product. Cute and very functional. Little bear helps baby hold on to paci or it can lay next to baby in bed. They used these in the NICU when my preemie was born, and they're now a staple for all of my baby shower gifts!
B000CSBP3G|5|Love these! They catch everything! My baby doesn't like putting them on because they're kinda stiff and can push up on her neck, but she seems to forget about it after a minute.
B00EAD7LF0|5|Cute. Very satisfied.
B007D1NKK6|5|Works great on our double bunk bed. It's not super easy to remove and reattach but we have brought it with us on some weekend trips with great success.
B006PB2B6O|5|Perfect, easy to install.
B00028YSU8|4|I have both the Boppy and My Brest Friend.  If I had to buy only one, it would be the Boppy because my son can use it for playtime.  The Brest Friend is good for sitting in chairs but not good for sitting up in bed.  Although if in bed you could probably nurse lying down.  I don't know in I have an older verison, but the cover is really hard to take off and clean since the cover opens to a foam pad.    Nursing pillows need to be cleaned often and I was very disappointed.  That's why I can't give it 5 stars.
B00L49IWBA|4|Makes for a great multipurpose bra.  Works fine with hands-free pumping and much better than the snapping nursing bras because you can just pull it down and push it back up for easy access & easy coverage.  The only reason I didn't 5 star it is because it's not as comfy to wear all day as a regular bra--just the way it pulls my back, I feel relieved when I take it off in the afternoon.  It's not at all uncomfortable though.  I'd also like to have options for ones with thinner straps because this doesn't work well with tank tops/camis.
B00383Y54I|4|This system ranked with Consumer Reports as the \\"overall best buy\\". Had to use towels to get the base level in our Rav4. The carrier is easy to put in and take out of the car. Stroller is very maneuverable, but the button that folds it down or sets it up is a little difficult to coordinate the \\"slide and press\\" (slide the button first and then press in).
B001FT19IW|5|I love the entire set except for the valance curtain.  It makes the room a little too dark for my liking even though it is just a valance and not a full curtain, but comes with the bedding set, so no set-back as far as price.  This hamper is great though!  It comes with a white mesh laundry bag inside, and it is very strong.  The loops that hold this in the frame inside won't just break under the strain from a load of clothes going to the washer.  Love this set... would buy Lambs & Ivy again for sure... hopefully they are all as good quality.
B002715NUM|5|I bought this bottle to try with my 3 mo old daughter who was refusing all the other BPA-free bottles I tried.  She took this one easily and we have been using it ever since!  I really like that it is not as heavy as I expected (most other glass bottles I tried were too heavy and cumbersome to carry in my diaper bag), as well as the fact that it's basically shatter-proof due to the silicone casing.  I would highly recommend these bottles!
B000FTD1PM|4|I am so pleased that we bought this. This cradle has a classic, elegant look to it, which is a great alternative if you don't want a bassinet that looks like a doily factory exploded on it. So far, we have been using this for three months and our baby is secure and sleeps well. The pin keeps it stable, but my only beef is that over time, it becomes easier for the pin to wiggle out. We are conscientious about checking this before bed, so it hasn't been an issue, though. I have a slightly small other beef and that is that it is hard to find sheets that fit it, so we usually have to take a regular crib sheet and secure it with duct tape. If you're looking for a simple, classic cradle for your baby to sleep in under the $200 range, this is it, though.
B004J34TF6|5|I thinks Dr. Brown is the best brand for baby bottles. I've been using this for my baby's entire feeding period, and the nipple is so soft compared to other band's products. I love this brand.
B000B74DYQ|1|I purchase this monitor for travel purposes...small and easy to use with the rechargeable battery. I wish I had read these reviews prior to purchase. I still use it but with precautions. I have to say, I do use it around my house b/c our other monitor (with camera) makes a lot of static noises when it's out of range or there is wirless interference. The problem I have is that sometimes everything seems quite, but in reality it's not transmitting...even though both ends are plugged in - and the other monitor does transmit baby's crying. It also make the anoying sound that other reviewers have mentioned. My home is less than 2500 sq ft and it often loses signal. I would recommend checking out other makes/models before purchasing this unit.
B009QFGOGE|5|I purchased this bedding set after reading many reviews.  Although several were negative in that the purchaser was not pleased with the quality of the set, I thought so what, my lo will not use it very long and the smile this would bring to his face is worth it.<br />  I find the quality of 5 bedding very nice. The sheets are light and soft and the quilt is adorable with different yo gabba gabba visuals on either side. Also very soft, both washed well and I dried on low. The shape or feel was not lost as well.<br />  This was not eligible for prime but I ordered on Thursday night and it arrived on the following Monday.  Great service from an independent retailer. I would definitely order from them again.<br />  Great product, exactly what I wanted. My son loves it. Great service also.
B000TBFNZC|5|I was concerned twenty dollars was too much for a chew toy, but there was so much press around it, I had to get one for my daughter. It smelled better than most toys and tasted neutral to good (yes, I tried it.) and I think the way her legs can reach my baby's molars is great, most chew toys don't get quite back far enough.
B0000DH5TU|5|This monitor is great for our house and we live near large power lines.  No static at our house but when we went to visit relatives in NV, lots of static.... so, I recommend that you try it out first.  Have had it on 24hrs a day for 2 months and no problems at our house!
B00JPXPRNI|4|Got it for my mothers living room with a dark grey matte paint it looks perfect. I expected a way larger size but for the price i guess its ok. Eventually i would like to order a larger one but this one is at an average arms strech lenght and head to shoulder width.
B0024VON4C|4|Not as big as I expected but very cute and extremely soft and huggable. Excellent quality.
B0009JOSNM|5|Very comfortable! We should have gone this route the first time around!
B000BY5Z6O|5|As simple as these may be, my 9 mo old loves them.  Esp the one with the little pop up person.  We take them whenever we travel.  Easy entertainment.  Different textures and 'functions' on each ball.  One has spinny things, (that's a technical term :) ) one is weighted so it has a wobble-y roll, and the others are fun and easy to grab and manipulate. She loves: I love them.
B0012K93I2|5|My daughter was given this as a gift when she was about 9 months old. She loved it then...and still plays with it at age 4.5 years old! Her baby brother just discovered it (he's 3 months) and loves it. A great toy. Haba does it again! :)
B00005ULXK|5|This kel-Gar Stroll'r is really helpfull, it helps me with my handbag a lot and with my keys
B00DJPGL3S|5|We purchased this mobile for our little man as an easter present. Since he was only 3 months old, and didn't have one yet, we thought it would be perfect! It was pretty simple to put together and we attached it to his crib immediately. I laid him in his crib and turned it on and he just smiled, cooed and talked to it for about half an hour!<br /><br />This mobile has 3 different options for noise. You can choose a Beethoven theme, nature sounds or a heartbeat. There are also several options controlled by a switch on the side that allow you to just play the mobile without any noise, to play all options, or to turn it off completely. I love the projection this mobile does! As the music plays and the animals spin, it is projected onto the hood of the mobile. You also have the option of removing the hood as the baby gets older, and it will project unto the ceiling. There is also an included remote control! This allows you to replay it if it does stop, without the baby seeing you.<br /><br />We have owned this mobile for approximately 6 months now, and I still love it! So does my little man! He is still talking back to the animals, and has now learned to push the buttons himself. Many mornings when he wakes up he will roll over and push the button, and just lay there talking to his animal friends for awhile. On occasion when he has had difficulty falling asleep, I will lay him down and turn this on, and it has put him to sleep!<br /><br />The only flaw with this mobile is that the music is not loud at all. In fact it is barely audible. We use a fan in our baby's room as white noise, and when it is on and the mobile is going, you have to strain to actually hear the music. It is just too soft, even on the loudest setting. Luckily this is not the selling point of this mobile! I purchased this even after reading several reviews stating the same thing. I do not regret my purchase. This is by far one of the best mobiles I have seen!
B00PL1KV70|1|Our 12 month old also was able to pick it up from the sides, like other people are saying.  I also found it heavy/bulky so it isn't practical to bring places.  I found a thing silicone mat that &#34;sticks&#34; to table at Target for $3.99 that I am using now.  This was expensive and I wouldn't recommend it to parents who children haven't grasped the concept that food stays on the table.
B001E4MWY8|4|We just bought this mobile for our first baby due in January.  We are doing an \\"under the sea\\" theme and this fits in perfectly.<br /><br />Things I LOVE:<br />1.  The fish are very colorful and adorable.<br />2.  The light show above is spectacular.  You can really make out the fish - they look they are swimming in a circle.  It's bright, but not too bright to keep baby awake.<br />3.  Seems very durable.<br /><br />Not so great:<br />1.  Truly does not fit on convertable cribs.  We used two nylon cable ties from Home depot to attach it to the crib.  It's very sturdy - doesn't budge and the lines hold up to 175 lbs so it's not going anywhere.  Would be nice if it came with an adjustable base.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2.  A bit pricey, though I would pay more for it because I love it SO much!
B002GKC4AG|3|I love the concept of this pillow.  It is sturdy and has an easily cleaned cover...and then I tried it on.  It would not fit around my waist.  Even with the strap let all the way out it still would not buckle.  I'm upset that I spent money on the more expensive professional pillow and it wouldn't even fit.
B004EFC6MC|5|i can't say that it &#34;worked&#34; or didn't but i can say that my daughter never had a bad teething issue (other than drool) and she wore this every day from 1 month old until 2 years. it is so cute and we get many compliments on it. it has become one of my favorite keepsakes from my daughter (i'll get my second kid her/his own) and i was heartbroken when i thought i lost it.
B0039VCRPI|5|The velour-like fabric is so nice and soft.  We have 18 of these and have been using them for 5.5 months nonstop, and none have started to fray yet.  They are thick enough to handle poopsplosions with just one wipe.  Baby also enjoys playing with them dry.  We roll them up and fit 9 in the Lionheart warmer, but if you don't care about leaving room on the sides, you could fit 15.  Love the colors.  Only complaint is that I wish there were more of an even number of each color in the pack -- we have a lot of green and I would love more blue and orange.  Lovely wipes.
B007IVDP3I|5|This safety strap is handling our 2 year old wonderfully so far. It keeps our flat-screen right were we want it on the stand and they has been no tipping between a 2 year old and 2 cats so far. I would definitely recommend spending a little more for safety straps and getting these if you have a child in the house. Very pleased.
B0088EUA82|5|My daughter absolutely loves this toy! It's our go to toy for when we're out and she gets fussy!
B0034C1P32|4|This served its purpose. It is very simple, but my grandson loved getting stars and attaching them to the board.  It definitely got his attention and made some behavior changes, but he is only two and I would recommended it for a slightly older child.
B004OR1DTC|5|So much better than the smaller grass.  Holds a lot of stuff.
B0052QYLUM|5|My only complaint would be that we don't use it very much because our son's crib is still in our room for multiple reasons. If I could do it over again, I'd probably save the money. But, that is obviously no fault of the product or seller. This is a great monitor and the best price we could find for one like this. Maybe we will use it more in the future when we have more kiddos!
B00LK5J73U|4|great product!
B000056OWT|5|Muy bueno y util y funciona perfectamente con muy buen alcance y la se&ntilde;al no se pierde mientras te desplazas por la casa.
B0036Z3DDC|2|My twins have had these for two weeks... the chargers are cheaply designed and the prongs came out the second day. The lights fall out of the bottom if they drop it and now they wont turn on, even with the reset. I will be returning these for another night light. I really loved this concept but it's just cheap.
B004OSM0CU|4|I initially bought the Mobicam DXR camera and monitor for my two year old.  Now I monitor my newborn with the additional camera.  The monitor gives you the option of cycling through each of the two rooms/ cameras every few minutes.  However, when I do so,the sound invariably drops out so I can't seem to hear either of the babies when they cry or wake up. I have contacted the company and they seem to have had other customers complain about the same issue.  I believe they are trying to resolve the problem.  Other than this issue, I am very satisfied with the product. It is easy to install and the picture quality is great.
B007MPFT98|3|The expandable part of the product description said 5 were in a package, but I got only one...wasn't very surprised at that - I was wondering if it was a misprint. Anyway, it just take a lot of space for what it does, and you still have to cover with a wrap. The velcro catches on other things at wash time too. It is very soft, but I prefer our Thirsties wraps stuffed with the Alva bamboo inserts or the Thirsties hemp tri-folds.
B001ED8EEG|4|How adorable is this frame for a stocking stuffer to your parents with a pic of your kids on Santa's knee??
B001P4GIHY|1|This was a waste of money. The app on my phone is way better and very helpful.
B0018BF8RK|5|This potty is exacly as I expected.  It is the perfect size for my 4 month 20lb son.  I am starting him early on learning about the potty and moving into part time EC.  When he gets to big to use it as a house potty or is not needing it anymore I love that it is small enough to throw in the car for emergencies (bowl movements).  This potty is small so read the dimensions and go from there.
B000AV5LZ8|5|Easy enough to do that my 3-year old can figure it out and it's also a great step stool for them when they brush their teeth and hair at the sink.
B000O7YMCG|5|I love this baby sheet. It's very soft. My baby sleeps directly on it. With no pillows. I keep washing it and still looks new. Would order in different colors for sure!
B00AJHEC76|5|Our daughter needed to be swaddled, but constantly re-swaddling in the middle of the night grew exhausting. I remembered that I had a woombie that I received as a gift for my son and used it one night - it was magical. She went from waking up every 1.5-2 hours to sleeping 4-6 hour stretches. The cotton is soft, and I love the two way zipper for diaper changes.
B00GY8J3TG|5|Perfect.
B00IM8G03I|5|nice
B00CUWCPJK|5|Soooo cute!
B006GIRDU0|5|This is a very cute and soft bedding set.  It looks just like the picture.  Can't wait to use it.
B007UD088E|5|very cute and nice quality
B002G9UTMC|5|Amazing value for the price.  The hamper is perfect for the babies room and looks expensive.  Highly recommended.  The brown is a deep chocolate brown.
B00PWKC32G|5|Our daughter loves her &#34;big girl&#34; pillow.  Little One's even sent instructions on properly folding an adult sized pillowcase to accomodate the smaller size of the pillow.
B00MRZIGVG|5|These are the best 360 cups out there.
B00ABDDFT4|3|This bumper is made of the same fabric and has the same sweet details as the bassinet size, but it doesn't fit as well. The ends overlap quite a bit in the interior of the crib and don't have Velcro to hold it together outside of the crib like the bassinet size.  Considering the price, I wish I had ordered a custom bumper.
B00F0HWWOK|5|Absolutely love this diapers bag! I was looking for diaper bag forever until I found this one. I can hold 6 bottles,makeup bag,wallet, 10 formula packages,changing pad with 10 diapers and the travel container full of wet wipes and lots of other stuff, with plenty of room left over highly recommend.
B004XINU0W|5|I was told that this product is very handy and they love it.
B000YDDF6O|5|Great quality and the babies love it!
B000083GHY|5|I have had this product in my car for 1 ½ and it has kept my leather from getting dirty and dented.  We have a Britax car seat and it is quite heavy so in other peoples cars the car seat tends to leave pressure marks on the seat with this devise it looks as if nothing were ever there when the seat is removed.  We love it.  It catches spills and snacks and prevents stains on the seat.  I take is out every once in a while and hose it down good.  I leave it out in the sun to dry and it is as good as new.  Long as there is no sticky residue from juice or milk you could just simply vacuum it up.  It dose however show how nasty and dirty your children can be!
B0012LZD5I|5|The plastic backing on these bibs keep baby's clothes dryer than those without. Velcro keeps the bib on securely. These are good quality bibs.
B002SG7JSU|4|These corner guards were exactly what I wanted and needed.  Only problem was attaching the guards...my one year old grandson took them off on the first day.  I reapplied and now all is well.
B005PK1D7E|5|My girls were constantly fighting as only one of their seats had cup holders. Now problem solved for all us.
B003FGX8S2|5|Bough as a fundraiser and love them for big to little snacks and other items.
B0082232D0|4|When my child was born everyone and their mother bought me a baby blanket.  And I'm not complaining or anything, and I definitely appreciate all of the warm wishes accompanying those blankets, but really - how many blankets does a baby need?  I had my Oshis for warmth, softness, versatility and machine-washability.  Do I really need more blankets?  I was ready to return this Kivelli blanket that I got - not as a gesture of rudeness but to be able to utilize the $xxx spent on something more useful - like, I don't know - formula or diapers.<br /><br />Then I felt the Kivelli.  I was like a teenager with his first girlfriend getting to second base.  I couldn't stop feeling that blanket up.<br /><br />The Kivelli blanket, in addition to being beautiful, is super-ridiculously soft.  Like, amazingly soft.<br /><br />(Is it wrong to say I wanted to keep it for myself?)<br /><br />The blanket didn't go back to the store.  I'll find another way to pay for the formula while comfortably ensconced in my Kivelli-cocoon.
B0012HAWEO|5|I was very pleased with the price, quality, and expediency of this gift for my new grandson!
B00EOWLF8G|5|The best!!! Lot's of compartments, easy to pack and go!
B003E6KCHS|5|Absolutely love this. It's soft, easy to use, my favorite part is the zipper zips up from the feet. Makes night time chanes easy. I can just pull my daughters legs out without having to unswaddle
B00004D3ES|5|I've had this tub with my firstborn almost 9 years ago and then with my second child as well. It has always been the perfect tub,  baby does not slip with the backing, there is a place for your soap, shampoo, etc., when we were finished bathing our baby, we would turn it over to dry and then fold it up and store it under the sink! Unfortunately, we've had to replace this old bath tub with our third child, due to storage erosion (the box it came in got wet and therefore ruining the tub over time). But this tub sure is a good tub, that's why even after 9 years it is still on the market!
B000HKJ0QI|5|Easy to install at top of deck for stair protection
B001DIQR28|1|UPDATE::I originally gave this item 5 starts. I am now changing my review. After FOUR days of use, this stool totally COLLAPSED. The top step caved in under my little one's feet. Unsafe and shocking. My original review is below. I do NOT recommend this step stool and will be returning it ASAP.<br />---------------------<br /><br />Most of the baby stools out there are too short for little ones to easily reach the sink. We loved the Bjorn step, but it is tiny and posed a problem for our little one once he transitioned to washing his own hands.<br /><br />This is an affordable option-- it gets the job done, but I wish it were nicer.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Inexpensive<br />2) Simple design, clean white paint<br />3) Perfectly sized<br />4) Very durable and steady.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) HORRIBLE instructions<br />2) Assembly is a bit of a headache. Took me about twenty minutes-- the instructions are worthless and the pieces are not labeled<br /><br />All in all, it gets the job done.
B00081J3N6|5|Excelente
B0011URFRE|5|Great child seat as far as safety and comfort, needs another cup holder.
B001KZH6AG|5|Love this bra! I just ordered my second one. The first one stretched out a little after wearing it through my pregnancy and first few months of nursing. I wear one to bed and the other during the day. Pricey but well worth the money!
B0088UXLSW|1|The cot is not sturdy at all. They state that it is made with \\"steel\\" but that is misleading because the support pieces are plastic. We had the cot for less than a month before one of the corner pieces snapped. The cot also does not secure in a laying position, a two year old can easily fold it up on her own. This may be convenient, but not durable. The cot may do well for occasional overnight trips but should not be played on or left out during the day. Would not recommend for a permanent bed. There is a reason amazon stopped carrying the product in Sept 2013. It's junk.
B000I5UZ1Q|5|I wanted to get a swing that:    - Plugged in or used battery  - Had music (especially either classical or nature)  - Had a mobile  - Was upholstered for comfort  - Had good reviews    ... so I read everything I could find and decided on this one b/c the only two negatives I could find were that it wasn't blue it was purple. (It is actually mostly cream with accents in a shade between light blue and lavender) and that it was noisy to run. You can hear the engine when running it if you don't turn on the sound but it is not that bad and I am picky. I get annoyed listening to my dishwasher or washing machine. My six week old son likes it most of the time and it helps me to get a few things done around the house.     BTW VERY few swings can be plugged in or use a battery. I didn't want to be stuck at home with a swing that didn't work b/c I needed to ruplun to the store to get batteries.
B003ZWGPAE|5|This is a cute doll and very soft.  Perfect size for little hands, too.  Very, very pleased with the doll.
B000BXHPEU|4|This really deserves 5 stars but i'm upset it didn't come with a travel bag to conseal the contents.  Perfect for public restrooms.  So far it fits on any toilet we've come into contact with.  I'm a lttle annoyed about the space in the front.  I wonder why that opening is there?
B00ISS2QEO|5|Fantastic long lasting convertible car seat! Meeting with a child passenger safety technician really helps parents learn the ins and outs of this unique seat.
B001GQ2RWQ|5|This seat is great. Easy to adjust and clean.  Also very secure.
B002NGNFBK|5|I got this after my mother showed it to me on amazon. My five month old was a preemie and a little behind, he had just started to notice his hand's when i ordered this for him, the first time my husband and I put him in it he grabbed the bead bar, by the penguin. My in law's happened to be over, it made their day, and ours. It did take a little bit to put it together because the instructions are mostly pictures of what you need to do, but it wasn't too difficult. Oh, also when my husband pushes the penguin and the beads spin around it kind of startles our son.
B00G3H0G2G|5|This tray is perfect for my 3 year old. He loves to play with toys in the car and now with the travel tray he can do so more comfortably and I don't have to worry about him dropping his toys all the tome either! Also it is great for snacking or meals on the go!
B00SW0LGJE|4|This is the best bath toy storage we have ever used!!! It is very safe for your little ones. I put it low enough in the bathtub so my kids can get their toys out and put them away on their own. Great size for all their toys. I love that it is mildew resistant. And the suction cups stick to the side of the tub without losing their suction since the day I put them up. I would totally recommend this product 😄
B005WHQKG4|5|We own two britax car seats. I love everything about them, but both are so heavy i can't imagine taking them with me on a trip. We decided not to take a car seat for our youngest daughter. Unfortunately, i regret this decision and on the way back i purchased this car seat from a transportation company we used in Orlando (as you can see they provide the same Graco seat - https://www.orlandotransportation-shuttle.com/airport_transportation.html ). It is so light and our daughter liked it better then a $400 Britax car seat she had back home! We had no problem using it on an airplane! Now we take this car seat everywhere we go. Great for travel!
B007D9KTB6|5|I bought this product as a 2nd birthday gift for my nephew.  It is good quality material. The &#34;naked&#34; color means it works for boy or girl.
B00IKUJ2GU|5|Is it necessary? Of course not. But is it worth it? You bet!<br /><br />It's absorbent, good quality, and super cute.<br /><br />Only complaint would be that there are a TON of plastic strips holding it together - so be careful and make sure you get all of those cut and removed before trying to open it as that could cause some small tears.
B001TUZOBA|5|This is a great breast pump. I bought it mostly for the price and all of its great features. It really works well and is pretty comfortable. It is super easy to clean with a bottle brush, and lightweight for toting around to work or wherever. I like that you can plug it in or use it with batteries and that it can be used as a single pump as well. Someone mentioned the beeping noise which is slightly annoying but not a reason not to buy it. I bought a whole bunch of lansinoh brand bottles because they looked like they went with this pump, but unfortunately that was not the case. If you want bottles that will fit into the bottle holders then you need to buy Ameda bottles. Ameda makes the same pump under a different name. All in all, a great pump for the price. Buy it!!
B006ZMGOA2|3|Pros: This stroller has a good and has sturdy construction and I particularly like the feature where the seat can be reclined to a flat surface.<br />Cons: I constantly have trouble with the front wheels wiggling even when the stroller is being moved in a straight line (on a paved side walk). The only way to get the front wheels to stop wiggling is to lock them, which means the stroller can only go straight and cannot be turned. Sometimes the wiggle is so much that it impacts the speed at which the stroller is being pushed (and requires more force to be pushed).<br />Also there is no place for baby food tray or any place where some play items or food items can be placed for the baby.
B005IWM8KK|5|My 3 1/2 month old granddaughter loves this and her parents are glad for the free time it affords them.
B0000A1O7P|4|This is an incredible good deal. It's pretty safe.<br />The only reason I don't give it 5 starts it's because it is kind of a pain to take it of of the table and put it back in the carry bag, but other that that, it works great!!
B004Y319V8|4|The product was a requested gift.  The receiver liked it.  I was disappointed in the customer rep I spoke with at the company.
B00009IMCK|5|Just what you would expect.
B001NIZSGE|4|We have 3 month old twins and wanted a new double stroller.  We have the Graco Duo-Glider, but when we put our daughter in the back she pushes the front seat with her feet and jostles her brother around.  We decided to get a side-by-side double.  I did a lot of research online and decided that I wanted the Combi Twin.  We went to a Babies R Us to see it in person and then were going to order from Amazon.  I tried the babies in the Combi and they looked pretty comfortable.  I tried folding it up and it was nice and small and lightweight.  Then I tried to push it around to see what it would be like and I'm glad I did!  The Combi has 3 sets of wheels across the back and I am 5'10.  Every step I took I was stepping on the middle set of back wheels.  Not good!  My husband really liked this Baby Trend Expedition Double.  I thought it was too heavy.  He put the babies in it and they looked comfortable and I tried pushing them around.  One time down the aisle and I was sold.  It is such a dream to push!  Very easy to control, turns on a dime, GREAT parent tray with 2 cup holders and a large covered compartment, great sun shade that isn't attached to the top of the stroller so you can move it to any position to block the sun, 1 mesh pocket in each child seat, 1 pocket on each child seat back, a large under seat storage pocket....only problem is that it is divided so I have to really cram the diaper bag in or hang it across the stroller handle bar.  I also like that it has no center back wheel so there is plenty of room for walking behind the stroller.  The brakes are very easy to engage/disengage.  It folds up nicely and fits in the back of the T&C with room on the side for groceries.  I took it to the mall and it fits through the standard store doorway as long as you go slow and line it up just right.  Most stores have double doors though, so it's not a problem.  Our 5 year old even likes to sit on the front plastic footrest and go for a ride.      Also want to address the\\"issue\\" of the shakey front wheel.  Our front wheel was also very shakey and made a clicking noise with every revolution.  Super annoying.  It has a quick release lever like on your bicycle tires.  I took the wheel off and inspected it.  There is a nut on either side of the tire unit....finger tighten those and put the wheel back on...problem solved!  I also read reviews where people said the front wheel fell off.  There is no way for the front wheel to fall off unless you didn't put it on correctly.  The quick release wheel lever needs to be turned/screwed until there is resistance when you push/lock the lever down into place.     This is a great stroller for less than $200!!! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the under seat storage bin...should have been 1 open compartment.
B007A2ZOP2|5|These are the 2nd type of covers we bought. The great thing is that these are not translucent so the outlet does get hidden which is good for our babies. The potential problem is that these are curved outwards so the babies do notice that. So far no issues though.
B004QDKMNC|5|This travel bed is great for newborns and small infants.<br /><br />Once your child starts rolling over though, you'll need something else.<br />Our daughter will now roll right out of this travel bed, so setting it on the floor is imperative.<br /><br />It was great the first 4-5 months though. It folds up compactly, and is easy to put in the car when we visit grandparents or friends. Works great for nap time, or when we're staying out past her bedtime and she's ready to go down. The shoulder strap makes it easy to cary the car seat, diaper bag, and the travel bed all at once.<br /><br />I actually just ordered a PeaPod to replace this bed, so we can zip her in there and not worry about her rolling away.
B00029TCS0|1|Drawers are rickety when sliding in and out.<br />Comes in a million pieces.<br />Chipped and unfinished paint areas.<br />First one that shipped came damaged with cracks everywhere.<br />If you plan to use as a changing table, it's a tad smaller than a standard size pad.<br />I'm afraid to open and close the drawers bc I'm afraid of them breaking!<br />First dresser that came damaged was a flat white finish, while the second one was a bright white all gloss finish.<br /><br />Very disappointed! Spend the extra $100 or so to save yourself the frustration!
B003K0IH4I|4|I originally bought this for my baby's food jars and it worked great. I sometimes buy Gerber food, which has the square shaped packets instead of jars, they will not fit on this tray.<br />So because of the hassle of only certain brands fitting, I changed it to a spice rack! It is SOOO much better than any other spice rack I have ever had. It holds a lot and makes it easy to reach them all without having to search.<br /><br />Only con is that it is a little rickety and can't hold anything slightly heavy.
B004FN0ZBC|5|Fits perfectly with the Graco snugride 30 and would easily be interchangable with a snugride 35! Works great for a second car
B00457X7EA|3|I got this to give to a friend who had just had a baby. It's cute, and I thought it would make a nice baby gift. Here's what both the mother and I thought about it:<br /><br />First, it seems nicely made and is 'new baby cute'. It's not something that I think will be used very often at home. It's not all that large, and once a baby can crawl at all, it's going to be too small at about 30 x 30 inches.<br /><br />Where is is more likely to be useful as something to take with one as it's something to put on the floor that's a little nicer than just a baby blanket (for this purpose) if you want to put your baby down for a little bit. It looks nice and the little attached toys mean there's something for the baby to focus on, and when you fold it up the toys just come with it.<br /><br />I think whether or not you think it's worth it will be a function of how much you think you'll use it and for how long, given its size.
B005KBVF2Q|5|this pad is so soft and nice. It matches his room so I decided to buy 2. I love them
B009EDSWJA|4|standard sized, by cover fits it well, has the strip of fabric that you can attach it to a dresser with so it doesn't move around. it doesn't smell funny, it has decent cushion.  can wipe clean, but I use the lap pads with the cover so because I have a boy child that likes to pee everywhere, so that way I don't have to change the pad everytime I change him to get ready for my little girl...
B00IIFLCFQ|5|These are great! having a baby shower = put these IN the pampers use as a LINER so when baby has a &#34;mess&#34; you can save the diaper &<br />save $$ just toss these in hot soapy water & then the dryer you get half a dozen for 5$ + s.h. GREAT deal! also when baby is potty trained you have cleaning cloths for the house! these are a win, win!
B0054G553W|5|We bought this for our youngest and its great! It gives just a little light in her room for us when we check on her and give her something to look at as she falls asleep.
B00004D3EU|2|I recieved this 4-in-1 bath as a gift for my baby shower.  I thought it was a great product, I started using it, only in the tub.  It worked great only until she was able to sit up...when you turned it into the sitting part, it does not have a slip resitant, she slid all over the place, it made things so difficult!!!  And cleaning, you have to take a toothbrush to it in order to clean it out well.  It's hard to store away, and to dry!  I would NOT recommend this product!!!
B003IP2L38|2|My husband bought these for me because of the good reviews but I had some trouble using them. They did not last more than a day for me although they felt soothing when I put them on. Even after washing them, they did not want to stay on my nipple and after my milk came in, they just shriveled up inside my bra.
B004A9PWHS|5|A great cover up for our son. Fits well on the car seat.
B000GB0O0Y|5|i bought this as a gift because i felt that babies need a little relaxation aswell.
B00NCG6L7K|4|The pink decal looked like a paler shade online, but it's closer to hot pink. The application instructions were your choice of a YouTube video or pdf file, neither specific to the actual product/brand...however they do work. Each bubble you have to individually place. Suggestion: Hairdryer didn't work for me to make the decal adhere to the wall prior to removing paper backing. Use a washcloth with warm water instead.
B00CGRHP44|5|This console is perfect for on the go. The zipper pocket is great for storing small things that won't fall out when you fold and unfold the stroller. The cup holders and nice and deep. Overall very happy with this addition, I just wish it came with the stroller instead of sold separately!
B0011ECPA2|1|Didn't use I was in pain but if I have to wash off the residue it isn't worth it washing hurts just as much especially if you are trying to remove something on your nipples bc it could be harmful to baby.
B004AHMCKA|5|keeps little hands busy while in the high chair..love the bright colors, the suction cup holds it firmly in place
B005PK1E00|3|Maybe it's because my kids are in carseats and can't reach this yet when they are strapped in but we haven't gotten as much use out if this as I had hoped. One of the things I'm not crazy about is that you have to attach the bottom portion to the car's seat with a string and it just doesn't stay attached. I will say that it has kept the back of the seat protected from little kicking feet.
B00E3A31XQ|5|Must have
B0012S5HRU|4|Really soft sponge!
B00ITYXZ1U|4|I have been using them for almost a year, they are very absorbent and they do get softer with washing. Because these are 8ply in the center they take extra long to dry. If I had to do it again I would get a thinner prefold.
B00EVLIHWM|5|We bought this for our granddaughter to use in our carpeted flat. She started using it a couple of weeks ago at 8 1/2 months old, and she loves it! It keeps her attention for at least an hour's worth of interactive play and snack time with us. We are buying a 2nd one for her to have at home with Mommy and Daddy!
B0012E4FV8|5|I hated the price but worth every second. When traveling with a 1 or 2 year old, it is almost necessary. My kid instantly calmed down when he felt the reassuring straps. And these are great for smaller planes. Better to check the carseat and travel less bulkily.
B0012UZX4A|5|I think this is a great baby book.  I loved the ink pad that doesn't touch your baby's skin.  I like that you can add and remove pages as well.
B00RRP6AUA|3|We've ordered many Sonicares at the recommendation of our dentist.  They are great at keeping kids cavities at bay, however, don't expect them to last much longer than the warranty.  We've had to replace all of them every year or 2.  Usually the heads break where it connects to the base unit, resulting in a &#34;wobble&#34; that prevents any ability to clean.  Sonicare's work great, while they work.
B00578G0PE|3|We returned this item because it was not going to work for my 2 month old.  May be better for older babies.  We opted for a pack-n-play.
B000B4SVM4|4|I received this glidder as a baby shower gift and it was the best gift ever.  My baby loved being craddled in my arms and when ever I'd put her down she'd cry until she turned all shades of purple.  When ever my arms needed a rest I'd put her in her glidder and she would be happy.  It was the only other place besides my arms where she wouldn't cry.  She didn't like her swing, her bouncer, her crib or her bassinett.  She was very happy and content in her glidder and was the only place besides my arms where she'd fall asleep.  This glidder would soothe her to sleep even on those nights when she wasn't feeling very well and my arms were not good enough for her discomfort.  This is the only baby item that I can say got put to good use in my home, until the day that the engine burned out from glidding a very heavy baby daily.  I looked in all the stores to try and replace the glidder but I couldn't find one.  She didn't start using her bouncer until the glidder broke down and she wasn't very happy in the bouncer but I couldn't find another glidder at the time.  I wish that I would have checked on here for a replacement.  I say get this glidder and skip wasting your money on the swings and bouncers which your baby may not like.  Save money and save space.  You may not need those super expensive swings if your baby is happier in a glidder.<br /><br />The only reason that I don't give it 4 stars is because the engine burned out before we were ready to give up the glidder.
B00BY5KT4W|4|i have twins, they both slept in one basket for the first month and now are too big, and use their own. mattress pad is decent, good enough for naps, large size will be good for toy basket down the road. only complaint is handles are flimsy, would not feel comfortable carrying a baby in it by the handles.
B007P7KHEA|5|The stickers are super cute, and really looked great for pictures! They are a little pricey, but I am glad we will have this keepsake!
B001XXOQDK|2|Soft, pretty, warm, but very small. It fits in the palm of my hand, basically.
B00E3A32OO|5|so cute
B00I6IGF4I|3|I debated buying this for months. I have a Petunia Pickle Bottom Ergo and love it! I was so excited when a forward facing carrier came out that wasn't a &#34;crotch dangler&#34;. The Ergo 360 just doesn't live up to past ergos. The carrier is uncomfortable for me. My other one I can wear for hours at a time but I lasted less than 2 with the 360. My son didn't seem nearly as comfortable either. Typically he's happy just to watch the world go by and nap off and on but has agitated much of the time and wanted down. When he did fall asleep (facing me only)  his head bounced around and looked uncomfortable. I tried 3 out of the 4 carry positions and had same discomforts with all of them. It is also much more cumbersome to put on. The top latch is lower and hard to do myself and the velcro around the waist is obnoxious. The one that I did like better is that it was a bit cooler temperature wise. Hopefully ergo will try again but the 360 is just not cutting it.
B000N0SNHY|5|just awesome easy to use
B003CUXV0Q|4|My son sleeps much better in his pack n play when we're on trips with this mattress in it.
B009ICN71K|5|love it
B002JDSNFU|5|I was introduced to Cooshee Booster by my sister in law years ago.  I bought a new one, since I gave my old one away.  Recently, I had my sister and her daughter over.  When I pulled the Cooshee Booster out, my sister stated there was no way her daughter would use it.  My 2 year old niece would only stand and eat.  When I sat her down, she was fascinated.  She stated seated the entire meal!!
B009P8QYXK|5|My daughter cannot sleep without it.
B00171WXII|5|Much better than a bulb syringe, though i usually make more than one suck to get it all out. Definitely does not need 2 people to use it, as another reviewer said. Wish i had invented this.
B005H2LNP2|4|For children with disabilities the spoon part needs to be deeper. love the bendable handle.
B00014PLAO|5|We put the gummi rail covers on our crib when my son was about 8 months b/c he was chewing the rails constantly. The gummi covers were simple to attach and have stayed on through vigorous chewing and tugging. My son seems to enjoy teething on these rails because they are rubbery and must feel good on sore gums. He's got 3 teeth and doesn't seem to be in the mood to stop chomping the crib anytime soon. So very glad we got these as we tried the Prince Lionheart covers and they didn't fit at all...not sure what crib they would actually fit.
B004HWXCJS|5|Worth the money! Everything about this pump is great.
B003ULP592|5|This worked great on our convertible crib!
B0093Y0IJ2|1|Awful for a boy!! My son loves Elmo and this potty certainly helped his excitement to go on the potty BUT it was a big mess!! He just turned 3 and is big for his age, about 38 pounds and 40&#34; and no matter how he sat on this (facing forward or backwards) the pee always leaked through the guard onto the floor. He eventually used it standing as I don't think he was comfortable. I got so tired of cleaning the mess I finally just removed it and he transitioned over fine. I think if your child is smaller for their age, it might be ok but other reviews have stated boys are just unable to pee in this potty without it leaking.
B003BIFOJU|5|I didn't want to use pullups because they are too much like a diaper, so I thought these were great since they have padding in case my son didn't make it to the toilet quick enough but he can still feel he had an accident.  They are soft, easy for kids to pull on and off and my son loves them.  A potty training must!
B00TIPMD4Y|5|i recently purchased this limited edition Lizzy bag and I could not be happier!  I was already familiar with the Sarah Wells brand as I already own a &#34;Maddy&#34; bag, which is now discontinued and I knew I would be getting a top notch breast pump bag that can transition to a diaper bag or even a bag for a mom with a toddler.  The thermal lined pockets are great for keeping milk cold and snacks like yogurt and string cheese cold too!  It is such a spacious bag that I'll have no problem carrying my Mac book pro, my pump and parts, AND my lunch to work everyday. I have a two hour door to door work commute using mass transit so only having to carry one bag will be a huge win for me!  Also, these colors!  The blue quatrefoil and the green lining? This Sarah Wells bag is just AMAZING!  Buy it - you won't be disappointed!
B00GSNFG84|5|Purchased this for my Daughter and she loves it.  After raising 7 of my own, all I can say is I wish we had the Stroller and Car Seat in one design back then.
B005G3QSF2|2|Within 1 week the timer quit working.  the unit still works fine, i just have to set my own timer.
B0012QQQ7C|5|If you had all the time in the world you could make these yourself, but who does. The envelopes are paper with standard life saver mints inside. We put one on each place setting at our baby's homecoming/christening party and they really gave each place setting a nice extra touch that was very noticeable for the money. The phrases were very cute and they went well with our rubber ducky theme. I put some more in a little bin in the restroom. I wouldn't rely on these exclusively for a giveaway but they certainly have a great presence that made our guests feel like we really did think of everything!
B0028OT7G4|5|Great product!
B004ECJWK4|5|Awesome product! We have had it up for a little over the month and it has exceeded our expectations. My husband said to me the other day it is the best child safety product we have ever purchased.
B00AMCVQSQ|5|So happy I chose this mat over other  &#34;non-toxic&#34; offerings that are 3 times the price of this one.<br />It is generously-sized, better cushioned that I expected, with bright and interesting patterns, and most importantly - no chemical smell or any other kind of smell that has often been a complaint with those &#34;non-toxic&#34; alternatives. In addition, it is well made- no sloppy stitching, hanging threads, etc.
B009EVOVRO|5|love all the pockets! I use it as a school bag and it holds everything without feeling too big !
B00068O2A0|4|Bought this for my son but it doesn't fit in my car. I'm so disappointed.  My kid just plays with it..
B003YC0W8G|5|Great reception, I can hear my baby so clearly and not background noise, static. I love the fact that you can talk back to the main unit and speak to your baby from another room. Additionally, the ability to play lullabies to the baby is excellent. The night light is not very bright, but I didn't buy for that, so its not an issue for me. Bottom line, if you want an affordable baby monitor, that is simpel to use and works clearly, I highly recommend this one. So far, I am extremely happy.
B0009JOSNM|2|This is a good carrier for a small baby. Once my children reached around 12 pounds it was IMPOSSIBLE to carry them in this carrier for more than 10 mins. For the price of this product it should be more comfortable to wear. You carry all the weight of the baby on your shoulders and it is extremely uncomfortable.<br /><br />My advice would be to NOT buy this product new. You can find a lot of these for sale used for less than $15 (which imo is all it is worth) I bought mine used for 25 and I think i overpaid!
B002J4U8M0|4|Cute and serves its purpose all kids mirrors llok like fun house mirrors so based on that this is one of the better ones.
B000FCF0AS|5|Excellent!  I cut them in half and put in the re-usable doggie diaper.  Much cheaper
B00000IZPT|4|I love this toy! We received it as a Christmas present for my then 4 month old son.(He's now 9 mos) He sleeps our bedroom ina crib, and every night when he goes to bed, we turn it on the rain nature sound and he's out like a light!! I keep the remote control under my pillow, and if I hear him stur in the middle of the night, I just hit the remote and he's back out again. I also enjoy listening to it when I go to bed at night. It's very soothing after a busy day. I highly recommend this toy for anyone!
B0018Z8CN8|5|I have had this tub for 3 years and am using it with my second child.  I used it with my first child until he was about 10 months old.  Simple design and keeps the babe upright with a bolster and non stick back.
B000056J8F|5|This is a must have to aid in car safety.  The clip is sturdy and, if placed properly will aid in securing the car seat tight so that it will not slide.  I would not travel without this safety clip.
B0045VA3SO|5|Great Value for the very practical product.  I plan on ordering a second one to use in our ignite stroller.
B00VHP8V4O|4|Cute, turns on when lights go off (:
B00155WJ4O|5|This is a great idea to have on the stroller. Although I strap in my twins all the time, this is one more safety harness should they unbuckle themselves. The tray sits on this too. Although so far I'm not crazy about the tray. One thing though is that I find it easier to keep this part off when the kids get in their stroller and when I collapse it to put in the trunk. I have an SUV but even with the wide amount in the back, when this part and the trays are mounted on the stroller, they take a lot of space and are harder to collapse the stroller. Overall I'd recommend this part.
B0012LZD4Y|4|Love how absorbent this is. My daughter goes through at least 5 bibs a day. Love the pattern too!
B00ANJIE42|5|very good
0980027594|4|This was the only calendar for my baby's second year that I could find. I like that it has holiday and milestone stickers that come with it. I especially like how each month has a space for my own photos. Overall a great calendar but it would be nice to have other style options for backgrounds.
B000GG1MPA|5|Other blankets were too small for even my tiny newborn baby. I easily swaddled my baby with this large blanket. The flannel is super soft and keeps my baby warm.
B001H0GF24|1|I bought this gate for the top of my stairs and it works perfectly. I have a 16 month old and she does from time to time go and shake on it when she knows someone is downstairs, I stop her, but it is very sturdy. I put it up on my own and took a little while, but other than that I have no complaints because it was cheaper than most/all other gates. Oh yea, opening it usually takes both hands and I little strenght and if you have guests over...you are probably going to have to keep opening it for them. I have had dozens of guests and none can figure it out even after instruction.
B00BLVQIMG|3|I have two dogs and one is not housebroken at all. She uses about 5 wee wee pads a day (size is 17.5 x 24).<br />I used to use a regular trash can but would gag with the smell everytime I had to dump an used pad into the can. Hence why I decided to buy the genie. I was actually expecting the genie that twists each &#34;diaper&#34; but this system works well to seal off the smell. I also didn't realize that this was so big/tall. I empty the can every 4-5 days.<br />Pros: keeps the smell off. Hands-free<br />Cons: it's a bit cumbersome to empty the can. You need enough room around the Genie because you'll need to open it completely. then you need to hold the full bag and cut it. Then &#34;make&#34; a new bag by tying the ends of it. I wish they had a better design than this. (i might try the 16 gallon bag as someone suggested). and yes, i find that the refill is a bit pricey and not very practical.<br /><br />I would still recommend this product as I am now able to dump used wee pads without gagging.
B000JOT2RO|5|very nice
B003TUL8MC|5|My 1 year old LOVES this blanket.  It's so soft!  He carries it around with him and sleeps with it.  I'm on the search to find more like this, because we only have the 1 right now...
B000CRFOWK|5|We bought this for our child who had colic and it worked well - in the way that if you put the baby in the crib when she is asleep the soother kept her sleeping; however, if the baby is wide awake, crying and/or agited it will not put her to sleep. We kept vibrating unit under the matress and the unit on the crib rail and worked without any problem. It does have randon brakes and sometimes it takes a long, unexpected break and the baby may wake up a little but will fall back to sleep again. It works only for 10 minutes at a time so you need to watch out if need be for another run to start it again. We bought the \\"SleepTight\\" as well and found out that is much louder and is basically just an engine that runs continuosly but not very useful. Probably the intermittent run of the crib soother is more closer to the car drive mode. Definitely one of the most useful items we bought; we are using it even now when she doesn't have colic to put her to sleep. I would definitely recommend it.
B00A7A9ZAO|5|Love these for our twin girls they only will use these and no others.
B001NAAQRS|5|I absolutely love these inserts!! They are wonderful for day, but excellent for night. They hold a ton, and I have never had a leak while using one! They dry quickly as well, and are not super bulky.
B000056OUH|4|This micro. sterilizer eliminates the need to stand over a hot stove waiting for the pot to boil.  The pros of this sterilizer are the portability and ease with which I can use it.  The only con I can think of is that it only sterilizes 4 bottles at a time (hence the 4 stars rather than 5).  I can even sterilize my Medela breast pump items with it.  Buy this!!!  It's worth every penny...
B007X59W5Y|5|Overall great product. Very light weight and functional in almost any environment. I have used it on some rough terrain such as at the local garden nursery on rocks to the smooth, tight areas of the mall. I would not recommend it on too tough of terrain, which I have my BOB stroller for. It was what I was looking for in everyday stroller that I could keep in my vehicle at all times. My 16 month old seems to enjoy. There is plenty of room for growth. Also there is plenty of carry space in the bottom for everyday packages.
B004DFO57M|5|The best nail scissors for our little one so she can show off her cute little hands and not worry about scratching her face.
B002ZBDK54|4|i love the colors and it came with alot of stuff.... it was just what i wanted and looks great :)
B0036LBEZK|5|We bought one of these carriers originally only because our daughter was the model on the box.  So, without a need for a baby carrier we bought one only so that we would have the shipping box with our daughter's picture on it.  Now we give the carriers away (they are fantastic) as gifts to friends and family.  They are very well made, safe, secure, and comfortable for both mom and baby.
B001B8Y3X0|3|We have the Summer video monitor and are having a second child.  The summer one doesn't seem to be compatible with two in the same house so we tried this Graco video monitor.  The Graco is alright.  The sound and video have a distinct delay.  The video quality is grainy and when you use the zoom it only gets worse.  The concept of the vibration and zoom are great, but they are implemented poorly.  The video is the worst at night, but isn't as bad during the day.  The Graco does not get interference with other items like the Summer sometimes does, but I would still recommend the Summer.
B000056HND|4|Deep in the heart of Texas Mom! <br /> <br />I really needed a smaller crib to go in my bedroom downstairs for naps, and when my daughter would not sleep in her nursery.  I needed the crib to also be portable for when we traveled.  I did not like the pack and plays for several reasons they only accomodated babies up to 25 or 30 pounds and they did not fold up very small to go in the trunk of a car.  I originally wanted the Delta portable crib, but they were recalled.  I had never seen the Cosco portable crib until I went to a Babies R Us near my home.  It had all the features that I wanted, small portable and accomodated a baby up to the weight of 50 pounds.  I was sold!  It has worked out very well for me and my daughter.  I did think the assembly instructions could have been a little more complete, but other than that I am very satified with my purchase and Lauryn my daughter loves it more than her big crib.
B00C2KW3FG|4|Love that it is lite weight and compact! Down falls are its quite loud when on vibrate and could use a multi position seat
B00J2P9TE2|5|Love love love it! So adorable! Got it for his little naps at daycare... This weekend we used it when we are out of town! Awesome!!
B002RRLUSA|5|I got this chair for our nursery, but after receiving it I put it in my living room because it looks so nice! Not only do i use it more than my sofa so do my friends and family.I am going to buy a second for the nursery.
B004AI7LUU|5|Baby had bad diarrhea due to shots and I tried using the Desitin Max, however, this just made his bottom even MORE red and it didn't clear it.  As soon as I changed to Triple Paste within a few diaper changes his rash started to get better.  I also used it in addition to Aquaphor (put Triple Paste on first and then aquaphor) and it worked great :)
B002Q0YA30|5|This potty is great for travel! Easy to clean and does not take up lots of room.
B000IDSLOG|4|My nine month old is super picky about what he will teeth with, but even when he won't put it in his mouth, he still likes to play with it.
B000BGFI82|4|My baby has loved this swing from the very beginning.  The potability is great; she goes to every room as well as every friend's house with us! The seat is reclined enough that she could be in it without a head support even when she was so young that she could not support her own head yet.  The swing is flexible and sturdy as her 4-year-old and 2-year-old brothers can come hug her on it.  The only minor thing is that both times I bought this at the store, a fish and a seahorse on the sides of the seat would not float or swing as the produt claimed to.  It was one of a few things that became a selling point when I was shopping for a swing, so I was disappointed to find out this trivial defect.  I contacted the customer service and they said that the water (not a blue liquid)inside the mechanism was evapolated during the shipping.  Everything they suggested to fix it was for a rather big fee and was going to take some time.  (I was not willing to go without this swing for 3 weeks!)  I was a little disappointed because I've always had good experiences with other companies like Kolcraft and Little Tykes.  So, if you are like me, who wants everything that comes with what you pay for, check the product before taking it to a check-out counter at the store.
B007I8QU4C|5|This was a gift for our granddaughter and she plays and chews on it daily now that she's teething.  Love the fact it's in the shape of a little purse.
B002UD65XQ|5|protects the mattress, keeps it clean and dry. No issues with this cover at all. It is worth the price.
B000E26FP8|1|I do not usually write reviews, but I felt it was important to write this one.    Please do not waste your money on this pump!!!! If you pump occasionaly this pump might work for you, but if you have to go back to work and pump on a regular basis, this pump is a total waste of your money. It does not have a good suction and it is very poorly designed. I had to request a replacement of my pump first week I started using it daily. The new pump they sent still does not work well and the suction is very bad. Just like everyone else I read the reviews and I could  not afford a $300 Medela pump so I bought this one. After dealing with this terribile pump for 3 months, I now realize that it is so worth spending the money and purchasing either a Medela or Ameda pump that ALL lactation specialists recommend. Please do not make the same mistake! You will pay twice!!
B00HG4VJSK|3|It is pretty tiny, that's in the description but I didn't think it'd be THAT tiny. The head can fit in both your hands put together. I guess it's used for really small stuff like jewelry or hair accessories and stuff like that. It's nice and soft though but if you're looking for real storage this isn't your item. It's basically just to look cute.
B00863FJW2|4|My grandson loves to sit in his new booster seat.  Looking forward to using it in restaurants while on vacation.
B0028Q65LW|5|This little pillow was purchased for a teepee I made for my granddaughter.  It was the perfect compliment for sitting and reading.  Well made and fun!
B005UV0UEA|5|Just what we wanted , thanks for the fast shipping.
B0012E4FV8|5|Harness istalled easily and was comfortable for my 2 1/2 year old.  Travelling with a toddler already requires a lot of additional baggage, the harness fit in a pocket of my carry on.  It installed quickly and easily but recommend practicing at home to decrease your stress level and pre-adjust for your child's size.  Installed behind the tray table on the two types of aircraft I've taken it on.  Will lend to family for their travel.  Alreaddy worth the money.
B004OR1DNI|5|Our son absolutely loves these bugs. Perfect size for baby hands to grasp and not too small so we don't have to worry about chocking hazard. At 10 months he's too young for the net but just tossing the bugs around the tub is endless excitement for him. And they are solid plastic so they don't absorb water.
B001RCU76W|5|Our 6 month old loves this! She can reach the toys to bat at them and pull them, but they aren't so long that they hit her in the face when the car is moving. She loves all the little faces on the critters!
B001R5ZFWK|5|I wish I had ordered this when the pump was ordered! My husband was washing them out for me and ripped the piece that drips milk into the bottle. The pump won't work without it! So, I had to pump one side at a time until they came. Everyone who pumps should order this just to have!
B0013O9RX8|3|Great to throw in purse for sporting events, concerts, car really anywhere that a medium to large sized purse can go. BUT I have only been occasionally using it for 1.5 months and I have almost no suction. I replaced tubing, checked all parts, done all troubleshooting. No good!
B00GJBZQOO|5|Works great on wood floor and okay on carpet. My chubby legged boy fits in this no problem and has a great time cruising around.
B001F0RAB6|1|I ordered these instead of the drop in disposable in error. As soon as I got them I realized it but decided to try them. These are horrible. The leak and don't hold 4oz as advertised.
B00N1ORT1K|5|It's good but very tiny.
B00012CHFI|5|I have to agree with the reviewers that said this sleeper can only be used for a short period because it's so small, but for the time it can be used, it is a fabulous and useful product. I used this for my 6 lb DD. We stretched it's usefulness for 10 weeks before we transitioned to her crib. We put it away and brought it out for our new 7 lb DS. We successfully stretched its usefulness for 12 weeks. It is perfect for what it is. A sleeper that allows new moms and dads co-sleep with their precious new born. By the time both my babies were 2 months old, I was comfortable transitioning them to their crib. I don't think it is designed to be a long term co-sleeper. I bought one for my sister but her 9lb baby was too big for it so if you have a huge baby, this is not the item for you.
B0009N1K3Y|2|We purchased this set almost one year ago. While the rest of the set is fantastic the pillow is small and continues to tear on a regular basis with very light use.  The pillow rips on the fine white gauzy block which makes it hard to fix/sew.  I would recommend a solid coordinating pillow!     The white alphabet sheet that comes with the set is also small for our matress- which I think is standard size.  We were not able to purchase additional white sheets as they do not make them but, did get the blue plaid sheets and they are fine.  Overall it looks great and we have enjoyed the set over the course of this past year!
B00AO084BI|4|Love the swing. Our baby has not arrived yet so I can't say how it is for daily use, but it's sturdy and very nice. The only issue we had was that one pole got slightly bent in shipping but we were able to make it work and it wasn't noticeable.
B002ITOC7S|5|This monitor is every parents peace of mind. It works great!  We put it on our son's diaper every night and he is almost 4 months old. Only had a couple of false alarms when he wriggled so much that it came off his diaper but that's ok it let's me know it's working. I absolutely would recommend this to any parent. Small and easy to travel with as well. Love it!!
B000AV5LZ8|2|This seat is terribly unstable.  It is flimsy and cheaply made and moves around a lot when our 2 year old tries to climb up. The potty seat does not rest on the toilet securely and slides around so it gets no stability from it. Once my son was seated he was okay but climbing up and down were very scary for him.  I would not recommend this seat/step and would return it if I had kept the box.
B006P05S2Y|4|I would highly recommend this product.  We used it for our first flight with our 8 month old.  We liked that you can carry it as a backpack.  The downside is that it does not stand up, however I think if it did, the bag itself would be bulkier.  We taped the inside of the bag to be on the safe side, but it wasn't needed.  If you decide to stuff the bag with diapers and clothes, don't tell the attendant at the counter or they will charge you a luggage fee.
B003DI5IIK|5|Wonderful product! Keeps baby changing supplies well organized! I ended up buying a second one to keep in my bedroom!
B000R2F6CI|3|This item is not as good as I expected. The beads are really large and are hard. I also don't like the large 'connector' star piece or the other big star pieces. It hurts when she bites down on them. She likes to play with it for short periods of time though, until it makes her mad.
B00F667QNC|5|It's simple, easy to clean & the perfect size for my soon to be 2 year old who is starting to potty train! She tinkled in it the first night we got it!!
B00A4K8FX0|3|I've owned and used this for about 6 months.  I like that it is color in the daylight and has night vision.  I like that it gives you the ability to add cameras for other locations if needed, but I haven't had to do this yet.  I also like that it is a point, tilt and zoom camera.  These are the only things I like.  The price is high for what you get.  It often loses connection and the screen and camera need to be paired again.  My house is not huge and when I walk through the house with he screen it often tells me the camera is out of range.  Finally in the last 2 weeks I have encountered a problem that looks like a pretty common one.  The IR sensor goes bad and the camera flashes between day/night vision constantly so you get black out and night vision every other second.  The quick fix is to put a piece of tape over the light sensor but that means you lose the color option in the day and have to live with black and white all day and all night.  This isn't what I paid for.  I called customer service and after a few frustrating calls was directed to set up a warranty repair request.  Now I will have to be without the monitor for at least a week and wonder if the repair will work permanently.  It seems like baby monitor manufacturers have consumers right where they want them, paying high prices for old and spotty technology.
B000P0TBX2|3|I got the stroller and initially loved it. I am glad I didn't review the stroller when I first received it.     Initially, I noticed that the child's cup holder would not stay on. It was annoying to constantly have to pick up the piece and put it back. Well, it did eventually latch well, and when that happened, it snapped off while being transported in the trunk of my car.     When I bought the stroller, I thought that the 5 point harness would be best for my little escape artist, but my child is skinny and the straps don't latch high enough to keep her from sliding her arms out and standing up in the stroller if I take my eyes off her for even a moment.     On the upside: The stroller does look nice and is lightweight. It is able to make it through standard doors without issue and I had no problems maneuvering through a renaissance festival.    I am editing this to say that I did email the company about my problem with the cup holder snapping off the side. They were very quick to respond to the issue and did provide me with replacement parts.
B006ZISQGG|5|Love this chair! Great for all ages!  Bought a second one because it is so nice!
B000058DN9|3|I brought these cups since they were interchangable with the bottles we used, and the spout is soft.  Unfortunately they leak all the time.  For some reason they consistanly leak from between the collar and the bottle.  My daughter also found them hard to drink from being that you need to tilt your head all the way back once the cup is half empty.  The only pro is you can replace the spouts when they get chewed.  We were much happier when we switched to Playtex spill proof cups.  They don't leak.
B000UXOER2|5|Chose this rating cause this product helped in so many ways!  Helped with keeping my toddler safe and protected while I drive.
B001ECTSPG|5|My 1 1/2 year old loves his new bed.  He would never sleep in his crib and would always sleep with mom and dad.  He now sleeps the whole night on his own and it is easy for him to get in and out of it on his own.  It's the perfect size and will be able to use it a couple more year's, plus its really cute and sturdy.  My husband and I have both layed in it with our son and it's still holding up.  Its a great piece of furniture
B00AF4WPFY|5|great item, our baby loves these. very well made
B00318CLTG|5|I like this very, very appropriate is I want to ~ ~ next time and will buy, like this very
B0009UBSFC|1|I understood that this was to be the best product becuase it was digital and crystal clear.  When mine worked it was clear, but the problem I had was that the partent unit and the base unit would constantly loose connection with one another.  This would happen nearly everday.  I would reset the units just as the directions said, it would work for awhile and then loose connection again.  The combination to reset the units was also confusing.  Try reseting at 3am.  I went back to the cheaper monitors because I hear everything just as good and I don't have to worry about loosing connection at 3am and not hearing my baby.
B00A75CJAW|3|Works good  wasn't crazy about the attaching it but it worked for what we needed
B003DVUQR0|3|This does the trick. I like that it adds extra cushion and head support to the seat. We started using it when baby was 4 months old, and are still using it a month later.
B002V87MJQ|5|The best thing I had bought my grandson.  This is the most beautiful play pen I had ever seen.  The quality is superb and the many ways you can place it is just fantastic.
B000AQEBUY|5|Really good item. Baby is snug as a bug and material is really soft. I would definitely rate this item with top marks. It is not water proof -- probably shower proof at most. It does act as an effective wind proof shell.
B00JU949AE|5|It's great, I'm satisfied.
B0078LZHK2|5|Got this for less than 15, which was convenient and comparable to the big-store prices.<br /><br />Easy to clean and use. We needed to use a worn out old wood chair, because this booster has no padding so it will leave scratches unless you put a towel under it.
B001L64LH0|5|We had started with the Regalo gate and were not happy with it, so we bought this one and it is so much better. Easy to install, closes behind you, easy to open, very sturdy, and looks nice.
B008KW8IWW|5|excellent in every respect
B008ZGSF9Y|5|Exactly what I was looking for. Soft & light, but has a good texture to it & organic cotton was a MUST!!
B0053HSL9C|3|I like this book because it goes with theam and has lots on the babys first year, Im not good at writing alot after that and it does go up to 5yrs or so. But as the baby gets older you dont have as much to keep up.PERFECT for me!
B00IJJRVR4|5|Excellent pump so far! Trust me. I'v tried 4 different types of pumps and this is the right one. I get my milk in 20 minutes. I get more than with another pump. I'm so happy I had to share this.
B002G9UTMW|3|My husband and I purchased this for our 3rd anniversary, which is traditionally a leather gift.  The description said leather, and there is absolutely nothing leather about the hamper we received. Also, part of the description includes \\"allows safety straps to rest directly on child\\". That makes no sense, and I don't think it is meant to go with this product. I literally just opened the box, so I can't give any more info as far as how it holds up with laundry. The color is as described as is the size.  The description needs to be changed.
B002IVTPKU|5|The quality is excellent, shipping was accurate, what else can you ask for? This is really well made and fits Pillow, Air Mattress, pump, and sheets, blankets. Works great!
B009YSYD20|4|Not able to use for a few more moths but it looks simple enough to use 2 days a week. Hopefully it does what it says. Price was best I could find compared to stores and other websites, shipping was prompt.
B004TA93AU|4|I was so excited to get this crib. It was exactly what I needed. We were missing a piece when we got it. Which wasn't that big of a deal. Dealing with their customer service was horrible. They were rude and spoke broken English. Eventually they understood what part I wanted and we got it a week later. Its a pretty sturdy crib, very heavy yet easy to slide around if you need too. The mattress not being able to be adjusted didn't bother me either even though I'm only 5'3\\". The changing pad issue is rather annoying. My friend gave me a pad that I had to cut to fit. Then I used a blanket to cover it and tucked it around the sides. Worked great for me. My son is 11 months old now and the crib is still working great. My bottom two drawers I use for extra sheets and blankets and the other three drawers I use for bibs, receiving blankets and one for hats and socks. The side shelves hold lotions and powders and the other holds extra wipes and diaper pail liners. I did order a diaper organizer ([[ASIN:B003ULP59M Dexbaby Nursery Organizer, White]]) and attached to the crib next to the shelves. It holds diapers, diaper rash creams, nail clippers ,brush, boogie suckers, thermometer and things of that nature. I got [[ASIN:B00CJZ0HUW Sumersault 10 Piece Crib Bedding Set, Doodles Bright]] for the bed set and it looks so cute! I would have given 5 stars if the customer service didn't suck. I do like this crib and recommend it but do check your parts when you get it and make sure you have few people around when it arrives. The package says you need a forklift! It is very very heavy.
B000IDSLOG|3|But not sure why. The reviews are great, but there are other cheaper alternatives that work just as well. Kinda feel like this is another one of those items that I could have saved my money on. Live and learn...
B004O4DU2I|5|Product is as described.
B007TLPQRK|5|Awesome onsies can't wait till next year for our daughter to wear them
B00AQYZCXK|5|Great booster seat for small cars. Incredibly narrow and great for those with little space. Easy to travel with as well. My son used this seat for a couple years in our Honda Accord that had 2 other convertible car seats in the back as well. It was the only seat that allowed me to properly install my other 2 car seats.
B00H3X80UO|1|I can't say how this unit performs because I never got that far with it. When I opened the package I noticed that it had already been opened before, as if I was sent a unit that was already returned by someone else. All of the cable ties were cut, and the unit was just kind of shoved into the packaging loosely. The second thing that I noticed was how scratched up and dirty the front of the projector was. This bothered me because I imagine my daughter will find some way to put her mouth on the front of this, since I purchased it for her crib. Okay, so then I figured I would put batteries in the unit before I returned it to see if my daughter even liked this item. At least I would know if I wanted to request a replacement. When I opened the battery compartment I saw that it was covered with a battery leaking acid inside. I WILL be returning this item and I will never purchase another item from this seller.
B004VL2VRO|3|I bought this monitor because of the wonderful reviews.  The reviews are right.  This monitor is awesome.  The picture is clear, I love being able to scan the room, and the intercom feature has been very useful.  The biggest problem I had is thatafter two weeks of having this great monitor, our bird bit through the AC adaptor wire so I cannot charge the handheld device.  My husband called and asked for a replacement.  We didn't care about paying for it. Their policy is that they do not sell indivdual parts except for extra cameras.  The advice was to go on Amazon or eBay to get a replacement adaptor.  My husband pointed out that then it voids the warranty because it says to ONLY use their adaptor.  Basically she said yes.  So don't let anything happen to your $230 monitor unless you can pay to get it replaced.
B003104LP6|1|I bought this baby monitor for my son and daughter in law to be able to monitor what is going on with their new born child I expected a clear picture and good sound very disappointed in both cases.
B00CXGPNC4|5|this was a gift for great grandchild and they just loved it
B0000A1O7P|5|We were looking for something to help make the feeding experience while camping a little easier. This chair does the trick. Very easy to use and very sturdy. Fits very well to a picnic table and is compact so easy to travel with. This is probably one of the best baby products we have invested in.
B000CSEE3O|5|The boy loves it, but he wants to sit 3 inches from the fire.
B00005BXKM|4|I received this product at my baby shower.  I read all the reviews and decided it would be a good thing to have.  My daughter being a newborn only takes small amounts of formula and it can be difficult at times to figure out just how long to leave the bottle in the warner before giving it to her.  it can either be too hot or too cool even when following the directions that come with it.
B00IP8A1IK|5|Really cute
B004A9ZF3Y|5|I ADORE these! I wish they sold them in stores everywhere! We made all of our own baby food and these were easy to pour and store and they popped out with just a little pressure from my thumb. Easy to grab a few cubes on the go! Love, love, love these! Thanks!
B00AJSIZN2|4|when compared to other car seats this car seat is comfortable and my niece likes it.i would like to recommend to all.
B009IF62AU|5|Very chic and stylish, the price was great too. I have had several diaper bags over the years (i have 3 kids) and this is my second babycargo bag. And only because the first was in midnight color- this one fabulous red! Love it.
B000G3BC80|3|We picked these up when we couldn't find the brand we usually get.   First the pros: They are a good size, and the pocket is great - the pocket is designed so you flip it inside out, which makes it stand out a bit and thus its great at catching crumbs.   Now the cons: The only thing holding them on is a sticker at the back -- if you have a girl it is really hard not to get her hair caught in the sticker when you are putting it on, which means her hair is caught up and getting pulled when you take it off.  The cry factor for my daughter means that we will not be buying these again.  The stickers aren't great - so if the kid manages to get the bib off, the sticker won't hold if you put it back on.  My daughter figured this out and would take them off screaming as it pulled her hair.  There is another brand of disposable bibs (made by a company who makes diapers..) and they have a velcro closure.  We'll be going back to those- just wish Amazon carried them w/ the subscription service.
B000GCE5C6|5|It'is an excellent product, has been the best. if I'll buy any product like this repeat with you all the times as necessary. thanks a lot!
B002V92XAS|5|I received this diaper pail at my shower.  I had heard it was one of the better ones on the market and it is true!  It puts out a little bit of baking power every time you close the lid helping to keep the odor down.  It also twists the bag shut when the lid closes, again to help with odor control.  And when the bag is full, it snaps closed so there is no odor when you are taking the bag to the trash.  We leave this pail next to my daughters changing table and you would never know it was used.  There is never any odor emitting from it.
B008RR5YO0|5|I really love this stroller, it is the best purchase for our new baby and almost every single day we say &#34;It is a great stroller!&#34;, and we wonder why we did not think about getting a stroller with a bassinet for our first child. It made our life so much easier. We bought an optional bassinet that comes with City Versa and so far we have used it only with this bassinet since my baby is 2 months old. I will write an update once we use the included seat. Overall I really recommend this stroller!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- VERY easy to fold and relatively light<br />- fits in our trunk easily although we have a relatively small Nissan<br />- great color and style - it got many compliments already!<br />- very easy to maneuver<br />- great basket - it is big and nicely placed<br />- handle is easy to adjust and comfortable ( I am quite tall!)<br />- the hand break is much better than foot break I had in other strollers - so easy to use!<br />- most important: it is comfortable for a baby, my baby girl absolutely loves being in it, and she  sleeps in it most of the time during a day - it is much more cozy for a newborn than any bed<br /><br />Cons:<br />- included wheels are great (they ride smooth and are light) but they got bit worn down by little stones that pinched through them a little - it is only cosmetic detail. Probably more sturdy wheels would make the stroller much heavier.<br /><br />- I wish that belly bar was included with the purchase and at least a cup holder or some sort of organizer for a parent.
B00KPU2KQC|5|As a parent who is very pro &#34;puddle jumping&#34; I have gone through my fair share of raincoats for my 3 year old daughter. I am very happy with this raincoat because it has a nice soft WARM lining. One of my biggest pet peeves is a raincoat that consists of only the plastic material. Jumping around in the rain in the summer doesn't warrant a coat but in fall it is unavoidable. Not only does it keep her dry underneath but it also keeps her warm, which in turn allows for a lot more puddle stomping to happen without the bargaining to come back inside too soon. The outer layer is also very soft and moves well, as apposed to a &#34;plastic&#34; raincoat that squeaks and doesn't allow for the little bending elbows. I would recommend this brand to anyone. Very happy with the product! Let the playing in the rain commence!
B0013K1NXE|5|I love this blanket...good for parks, beach, your backyard...really anything! It's big enough for my baby, me and my husband!
B003HC8622|5|We bought this walker and we read about it being high for a 6 month old and we figured that we could somehow adjust it if needed ... Yes when it arrived, we found that it was high for our boy and our 6 month old boy is almost 27 inches ... The walker was great and comfortable for our little guy. the toys are entertaining and the cover tray is removable and adjusts out so you can feed the little one. I fixed the height setting by putting a piece of scrap wood into the adjustment slot so that it does not lower flat. you can adjust it to any height by doing that and then if you want to store it just pull the wood or object out ... The piece of wood I used is very safe and is stronger than the plastic it is made out of, but if someone wants, they can wire tie it in for added safety. :)
B0018JWAF0|5|I was aggravated when my husband bought these after a coworker of his recommended them.  I didn't want to deal with all the parts and keeping them clean.  But we had no less than 5 other brands of bottles when my son was born and these were the only ones that gave him a quick flow without choking him.  He is 4 months old now and we've purchased the level 2 nipples to go with the bottles.  We don't use anything else.  We even purchased extras to keep at his daycare so he gets the same bottle there.
B002F9MV9M|4|These bibs are nice and thick and large.  I like that they don't have velcro, so they don't get stuck to other items in the laundry.  The only quibble I have is that the neck is quite loose around my 8 month old, so food sometimes gets underneath and on her clothes.  I wish that there were an extra piece of fabric in the front to prevent that.  Otherwise, great bib!
B00M6V1VM2|4|I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest unbiased opinion. I find them super handy but I had 2 pouches that leak. Since I got the product at a discounted price, It wasn't a big deal for me, but I did want to mention it. I've only used them a few times but I find it convenient to fill, freeze and take on the go. It is plastic so if you put something in there and leave it and it gets hot, it will absorb the smell and get gross. I recommend you rinse it immediately after use to prevent that from happening, then wash it thoroughly when you get home. The other end of it is that since the price is pretty reasonable, you could always just toss out the questionable pouches and buy new ones if they work well for you. Otherwise, I think its an excellent concept, I really like the fact that there's no BPA/other chemicals involved making this a safe alternatives to bulky containers, but I think the quality could be better (leaky bags). I'm okay with replacing the products periodically if they get gross from use, but I'm not impressed with tossing them out if its a product defect.
B004G1H6DI|4|I bought this to put over my daughter car seat it works great no bugs can bite her we use it every day. The UV shade is great it keeps the sun off of her....the only thing is the elastic around it become a little loose when u use it a lot also the sun goes in through the sides so it bothers the baby if its real sunny so I put a light blanket over it and pick one piece up so she still gets air.....I would recommend this product it does its job
B001AG4D7O|5|This is perfect for keeping not on cups but toys from hitting the ground!  My girls love to throw things off their high chairs and out of the stroller and this keeps things secure1
B000Q8ZM0Y|5|Although this tastes terrible, it really works to increase milk production. I used a little cranberry juice, dropped the recommended amount into it and shot it.
B003VNKLIY|5|Great value for the money!  We also have the Regalo gate and it's wonderful for our puppy!
B006YW4UZE|5|I saw my sister in law used this product and I watched her baby how he sat comfortably and drank the whole bottle while his mom doing other stuff and since then I decided this product is necessary and I have to get it (at that time I wasnt even pregnant and no kids hahaha) and Finally I ended up ordereing 6 bottles for myself & family, the shipment arrived perfectly and the packaging was perfect with all these air bags that support the products. on the other hand, Personally I DIDNT use this product still since Im 8 months preggo but I've seen it work two times (with my sister in laws baby & my sisters baby) so I Think it is a great product for a mommy to have specially it is a time and life saver you dont have to sit there in a firm position feeding the baby he can do it on his own. if you are still hesitated to buy this product dont be because its worth every penny and im sure I will be happy with the result.
B0000DJ3F9|1|I just received this clock today and am so disappointed. It looks dirty, but aside from that, it looked as though a 1st grader did the paint job. The yellow paint didn't even go all the way to the bottom and was messed up in areas. You could also see streaks in the purple paint and little dabs of purple paint in the yellow. Very poor that trend lab would allow a product that looked like this to leave the factory. I am returning it today!!
B00JVM6STK|3|I like the ones with ruffles and I'm not fond of the blue ones. Not sure if there's a trick to keeping them up the legs?
B0007DHU6M|5|great for using for short stints while I'm making dinner or cleaning a mess.  Baby loves it.
B001MTELIU|1|Literally the bar across the top popped open and left a pile of crap on my back seat! And when the top bar manages to stay in place the bottom suction cup would inevitably pop off and the shade would flap about when the car is in motion. Not worth the hassle. Try another brand.
B000FULNA6|5|You really can't go wrong with this Svan chair and cushion.  If you want high- quality and getting the bang for your buck - this is your chair.  Our toddler daughters have been using the chair/cushion for the last 3 years.  We wash the cushion periodically - just throw it in the washing machine and it looks as good as new.
B0081JYVHU|5|Love this bottles!! There so cool, the only thing I don't like is that is hard to see how many oz are in there, unless you open the bottle and check
B005V09R26|5|My granddaughter loves it!
B000MGWEII|4|My 65 lb., 11 year old son has significant physical disabilities, so I need to be able to keep him from sliding out from under the seat belt.  This travel vest does a really good job of positioning the lap & shoulder belt on him properly.  He still leans a bit to the side, but the seat belt stays in the correct position at all times.  I used to have trouble with him lifting up his butt and sliding forward out of the booster seat; with the crotch strap in place on this vest he does not slide out of the travel vest and stays in place on the regular van seat.  He seems comfortable wearing it, too, no fussing or complaining.    I took off one star because it is kind of bulky and might be hot in the summer, so I'm not sure that I would use it on a child who isn't special needs.  I haven't tried it over a winter coat yet, I'm hoping it will still fit then because it has a snug fit to it.  Also, because my son has limited mobility, it took me a while to figure out how to get his 2nd arm into it (answer: elbow first) because the arm holes are restrictive in spite of appearing large enough.  I suppose a non-disabled child would have to put both of their arms straight down and back at the same time while standing up and the parent would have to put the child's hands through at waist level and raise the vest up into position, like with a floatation vest?      Anyway, I'm very pleased with this travel vest so far.  It solved the very difficult problem of transporting my disabled son in a safe way that is also comfortable for him.
B000V6YIBU|5|It is great.  Everything fits perfectly and it is easy to carry.  It does not look like it holds a breast pump.
B0016IMJV8|5|I have this mobile hanging over my baby's crib. She could stare at this for hours. It is perfectly balanced and is in constant motion. It is made of plastic, which allows the monkeys to \\"float\\" through the air.
B001KTWXLE|5|This allows you to prop up or sit in carseat and feed one of your twins while you manually feed the other. If you only have one baby, you probably wouldn't need this much.
B00FU2KL5W|2|Didn't work at all for soothing our baby.
B00P9WCOP8|5|I love the soothe shirt!  It's comfortable to wear and helps soothe my LO when she is fussy. I wear it when I go to events like birthday parties or baby showers where I know she will want to be held close. When I need to go run quick errands I can pop her right in and get the items I need from the store with no need to use a carrier, figure out a wrap, or bring a stroller. It convinient and worth every penny. True to size so order accordingly.
B004X0WBHS|5|This is SOOOO adorable well made! Very durable good quality plastic thick!! Will not break or fall apart! Would highly recommend<br />This anytime to anyone with a baby or shower gift !!  KC
B0042I2BWG|5|Good quality, quick delivery... no complaints! Will probably order these again.
B00P4S0SFK|5|What can I say, Gillette makes the best blades in the market. Great price & fast shipping
B002UD65XQ|5|Fits well. Did not rip like some other mattress pads I have purchased. It feels comfortable but it is also durable.  Good quality!
B00UTQEM7M|5|Love these wash clothes.  They are the perfect size, wash well, and are extremely soft.  Not abrasive or thin like other cheaper items on the market.  They stay soft and fluffy after washing. My kids and myself have used them several times.  We would recommend them to anyone.
B000056C86|5|As advertised
B001OC5UMQ|5|We LOVE this baby gate!  I have friends that struggle with opening and closing their gates and I am SO thankful I have this one.  It is super easy for adults to open, but just complicated enough that my toddler cannot figure out how to open it.  We also have a strange width at the bottom and top of our stairs (where we use this) and being able to adjust this is the only way a gate would work for us.  I highly recommend this one.  My only complaint is that the opening is a little small, so I wouldn't recommend it for heavier families. I am fairly lean and I have to turn to the side when i'm holding my daughter so I don't catch her feet or my thigh when going through. Still WAY better than all of my friends' gates.
B00005BXKM|5|I bought this for my daughter for her baby shower.  She LOVES this item.  For the money you can't beat it.  All bottles fit and jars of baby food, etc.  She sterilized binkies and everything in this bottle warmer.
B0067GKHVS|5|So easy to use. Love this
B003CL8ICQ|5|I bought this pump right before the birth of my first child, knowing that I would return to work and need to  pump in order to continue breast feeding my son. I have used the pump fairly regularly for the last three weeks as I have been building a milk supply for his daycare as well as the times when I felt engorged and needing relief. I have to say this pump has met all of my expectations. It works well, is easy to operate with one hand and easy to figure out how to use and assemble. The bag looks nice and has pockets for the smaller parts as well as anything else you might want to slip into the side pockets for traveling. I haven't used the car adapter yet but I think it's a nice inclusion. I also purchased the ameda bags with the adapter for the flanges so I can pump directly into bags that go into the freezer. That also works great and is very convenient. The biggest reason I purchased this pump over the Medela was that it is a closed tubing system, I liked the idea of no moisture being able to get into the tubing. I think this pump was a great purchase!
B00D2YSNE6|5|Exactly what I was looking for
B000XT30G4|5|We have two of these gates and they are awesome!
B00068O22S|5|great product! stoked!
B00D04R2IG|5|Love it!!
B001ACSXII|5|It was the best product I bought for potty training. It is large enough for a big toddler, my son is a big 2 year old and after reading some reviews I decided to buy that one. He liked it immediately and we started the potty training with that. It is simple, light easy to clean. Nice product.
B005UV0USQ|5|This was a gift for our grandson's first baby.  Everyone at the shower loved it.  We bought one  just like it for our granddaughter<br />for the first baby and he lived in it for the first three months.  Worth the money!
B006TQJXL6|5|I have twin boys and I can confidently say these bottles are amazing and worth the expense. I bought this set and used only these 10 bottles every single day straight from their birth till 18 months when we transitioned to the sippy cup.  I never had to replace any item because of damage and I can assure you they were washed (and occasionally sterilized) at least 2x a day for 500 straight days.  The measurements are still clearly written. There is no peeling of the laminate or weird smell or scratches. We had to supplement with formula from the very beginning and the great thing about these bottles is the wide mouth which allows you to use powdered formula scoop without getting sticky powder all over the counter.  Also the wide squat base is nice when you are measuring the water into the cup, with other bottles if you pour too fast the bottle tips over.  We used almost all the items in the set except for the bottle warmer and everything was high quality, no complaints at all.
B001V9KPBI|4|These bottles are great specially when you have twins, it is so much easier to feed both at the same time. It does leak but nothing you can't live with, I am trying to find a seal that would fit the top of the bottle where it leaks the most. I like these bottles a lot, and have recommended them to a lot of people
B006QH458Y|5|I bought this stroller for my twin girls, but it is ample enough for my four year old to sneak into for a ride when both babies are not riding. I love the fact that the tires never need to be inflated. Super easy to fold closed. However, since I am a bit short, I need to tip it toward me a bit, so that the handle does not smack the ground, when I tug on the straps on the seat to fold it up. Very easy to assemble. You can push it with just one hand, which is great for those of us with a third child in tow. Smooth ride. Babies sit upright enough not to fuss that they cannot see what is happening. The down-side for me is the hard to get to under stroller basket. Overall, love it.
B004IDG6XK|3|This had been on my wishlist for many months. When my husband and I saw it on the kid's night table in the futuristic Extant series on TV, hubby said, &#34;I want that!&#34; and I was able to say, &#34;Actually, you may have it!&#34; and I ordered it immediately. We didn't even know where we wanted to put it, but it's just so cool to have. We decided to put it on the hall table so we can pass by and see it often.<br /><br />One of the ball's LED light colors is slightly uncalibrated; say I have it set on white, this one light is ever so slightly pink, and so on, but perhaps not everyone would notice, it's that subtle. So that's the one I turned towards the wall and it's still good.<br /><br />I like that it glows in the dark, but I don't really need to remove any of the balls to find my way in the dark. My iPhone flashlight can do that. Besides, I can just see the balls wandering off an rarely returning.<br /><br />One complaint is the sliding switch. It's so far down the base, and so nearly flush with the lamp, that when I slide it, my thumb nail scrapes the table. I've started dreading using it as a result. Move it upwards and change it from a slider to a wheel, perhaps.
B0042D69YM|5|We are daytime caregivers for our grandson.  This is a great chair for him.  The tray is large, and both it and the seat cover are easy to clean.  The securing straps are adjustable.  The height of the chair is adjustable, and the back of the seat reclines.  It was an excellent purchase.
B000JOT2RO|5|I gave it 5 stars because the suction on the bottom works, they are stackable, and they have lids so you can save whatever for later!
B00B1M2QMQ|5|Havent used this yet, but it should be perfect for summer! It's light weight and has a super cute design!
B0054HSVGE|5|So apparently my last review didn't work...lol i was so excited it took less than a week after ordering it to receive it. Love the bed! You can tell which side is which. Fits perfectly and my son seems to enjoy it. =) Worth every penny in my book.
B00094JP2G|5|It's a very good product, and I am happy with the way it washes/is very light, good waterproofing, however, the size is really Large- my son is 30 lbs, but it was way too large in the waist and around the legs- I had to stitch the openings smaller... I did not know what the medium size would be like, but did not feel comfortable ordering it, because it says it is only up to 30 lbs...Also, I was hoping to use it for overnight- no way, somehow it does not hold overnight spills for my son, even with 2 diapers in..
B007RF98ZE|5|wish they came with a case, but they're good. My daughter loves them.
B00FBWNGZI|3|The quality of this &#34;gym&#34; is reasonable.  The hooks to hang the toys and the interconnecting ropes within each toy seem sturdy and should hold up to baby abuse.  The toys  keep a baby entertained. The mat is a nice feature and can easily be tossed in with the baby's laundry. The bee has a tinkly bell sound, there's a rattle, and the leaves make a crinkly sound.  Can still be used even without the batteries.  Setup and breakdown is very fast and I feel the toy is safe to play with.  I do think it is overpriced for what it is at MSRP.
B003U40HBU|5|Love these zipper sheets, best invention ever! The mink sheets are so soft, great for cooler weather. Washes well, lays flat right out of the dryer, zips on/off easily. The boys love the feel of these over the cotton zipper sheets we use in the summer.
B006PASIJ4|5|Great large towel and I believe we will be using it for the next couple of years (I feel it's a little big for my 2 month baby for now). The fabric is nice and soft and loved the cream colour.
B000CRNK44|5|This is adorable and well made. It is cute for boys and girls.
B004G8QSYO|5|The baby likes playing with these blocks. They are not too big or small - just the right size for little hands.
B00RE65YLS|5|Great organizer! Amazed at how it fit so nice and snug. Definitely got rid of the sag look and gave it a nice structure that these LV bags usually lack.
B00P84L68S|4|The one advertised as purple has pink dominance. The fabric is not reversible, so needs to be arranged carefully when worn as a scarf around the neck. Otherwise, nice weight fabric, soft, with a little stretch, and hems are finished. As for the concept, it takes a little practice to get baby in and settled while remaining covered, but it's comfortable once everything is in place.
B007NG5UF4|4|Works very well and provides a peace of mind knowing I can immediately hear if there is any sign of distress.
B0051SDWP6|5|We just put up this crib! We have it in white color. The crib is well made, sturdy and gorgeous with some detail. It will be very easy to keep clean since the surface is smooth. We got a mattress from IKEA that fits in here perfectly(standard size).The mattress can be adjusted to different heights  with the highest setting being right in the middle of the crib). Great crib, that comes with the railing for toddler bed. We love it!
B00YG4DWRO|5|We purchased this to replace our Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision. My husband hated the infant optics for 2 reasons #1 it interfered with our WiFi and #2 the screen was always on making our room bright. This monitor solved both of those issues and then some. This monitor works over WiFi and can be viewed via a smart phone as well. You also can turn off the screen and turn it back on again when you want to check in on your little one. I keep this by my bed and leave the sound on the lowest volume possible and I never miss out on his cries. The sound does always stay on and makes a very faint white noise but it has never been loud enough to bother me. It also lights up when you're baby is crying, it goes from green to red depending on how loud the baby is. There have been previous reviews that the view is not very good. I feel like it is good enough, I can tell if my son is awake or sleeping and I can see what hes doing. I almost always use this in night mode because he doesn't often take naps at home. The day mode isn't really bright but once again it does it's job.
B007NG5UGS|5|I bought this for our second baby, after spending $130 on a samsung wireless baby cam (it was awful-you can reed my review also) we decided to go back to basic and purchase a monitor that do not work on WiFi.<br />This monitir have pretty good features like in-display room temperature that comes in handy, the lulabys really soathe the baby (it would be better if the volume could be higher tough), the parent unit has a large color screen and the battery seems to last long enough.<br />The signal is pretty good between the two units even without deploying the antenas
B0009A3I5K|5|Love how you can reuse these! Contains the poop quite well and makes clean up super easy! Will buy more.
B004FK1FAU|5|These are the most absorbent of the nursing pads that I have tried. I washed them every day for three months and they held up great. Like any other nursing pad, they will show somewhat depending on the thickness of your bra and shirt, but the thinner pads just don't absorb enough in my experience. These were the only ones that did not leak through.
B007UK1CDM|3|I used to make fun of these things when I'd pass them in Babies R Us but after one of our baby boys spent a week in the NICU, where they made constant use of these, I figured it was worth the investment to have something he was familiar with at home. Yeah. He hates it. I'm super bummed too because I totally fell in love with this thing! The auxiliary hook up, white noise sounds, multiple motions, comfy padded fabric, and unique design had me enraptured. Unfortunately our little men moderately stand being placed in here. Baby 1 can't stand being in it for more then 5 minutes. Baby 2 enjoys it a great deal more then his brother but that's not a hard mark to hit. I think the babies might have enjoyed it more if we could adjust the direction the seat faces, not just the recline. Also, the toy bar is so beyond pointless. They might as well not even have it.
B00005JSAG|4|We had originally registered for a different travel system, but test drove a few models at the store.  This was the only stroller I (5'2&quot; and limited upper-body strength) could fold up with one hand.  I love the pattern, it's a refreshing break from the normal navy.  The carrier is a little heavy and awkward to carry, but I haven't found one that isn't.  My only problem with this system is that the stroller is not as durable as I'd like.  My family travels a lot and we have gate-check the stroller in the past.  We'll stop doing this because some of the bars are now bent slightly out of line.  Of course, I've seen the way luggage is treated, and can't blame all of this on the stroller.  That aside, a very good system.
B006P05S0Q|5|Easy to carry around and nice to have compartments for diaper, wipes and comes with a roll of trash bags that came in handy
B0051T8O76|5|I searched for a painfully long time and researched various manufacturers.  I ordered the Kushies off-white organic because I did not want any extra dyes, etc. and the neutral color will go with any decor.  These are very soft.  They are extra deep and fit the crib mattress better than any other crib sheet we have used.  We have a standard crib mattress in the day bed stage of one of those convertible crib/day bed/full size beds.  Our toddler loves this sheet.  It has held up well washing in a front loader HE machine.  I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting an organic crib sheet.
B00EDJ4P64|2|Initially, I liked this; however, my biggest problem with it became that it shrank very quickly in the dryer.  I guess I should have hung it to dry, all the time.  Since it shrank it is useless on my son.  Oh well.
B002UKKVIY|5|Bought the contours options 3 wheeler stroller.  This stroller is great.  easy wheeling everywhere and our 1 year old granddaughter fits it perfectly.  lots of room to store bags underneath   would highly recommend this stroller.
B00AV53YIE|5|I love the Pura Kiki line.  I have spent a small fortune trying to find bottles that are safe and spill/leak-resistant for my children.  We have plastic in our household, but we do not use plastic with food.  I appreciate that Pura Kiki is stainless steel and silicon: both unquestionably safe materials that are easy to clean and sterilize.  These bottles do not leak.  Of the five or so that we own, one bottle has chipping paint near the bottom.  As my kids don't gnaw on the bottom of the bottles, this doesn't bother me, and I have not contacted the manufacturer about it.  If this is a concern for you, try the regular stainless steel bottles.  This product line is definitely still worth it to me.
B00EEJOV3A|5|must have
B00KGIQYEW|4|I like the quality of the pillow case but my toddler always take it off  so i always ended up putting it on every morning. Would be nice if there is some closure on the case.
B00IR4F484|5|My daughter love it
B00NF2LT50|5|amazing....
B003HS5JPI|5|Very nice rattle; my daughter is 3 mos old and this rattle is perfect for her. It was the first toy she grasped a few weeks ago, and the panda face always keeps her attention. The back is a red pattern in a satiny material, which she also likes.
B0088UXLSW|5|These are the perfect sleeping place for the grandkids when they are over grandma's house! They fold up just like the lawn chairs that go in a drawstring bag, easy!
B0007WX0YY|1|My husband and I bought this play yard from Toys R Us. When we went to put it together, it only had three out of four legs. One side of the play yard was broken and would not lock, and the bag that it came with was completely SHREDDED. In speaking with the customer service rep, they wanted US to pay to have it shipped back and insured in order to get a new play yard. Forget that! It went back to Toys R Us!
B003BNY9V4|5|Perfect, like more of them. Soft cute and perfect for the cooler wether.<br />&#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3
B0037KCHGU|3|I was looking for one piece caps to screw on bottles for freezer storage. These caps are the nipple ring plus a disc that can fit over an upturned nipple so that you can take a bottle on the go with you, which doesn't seem necessary since there are nipple covers that come with the bottles. But the caps plus disc seem water tight without the nipple so they are still doing the trick. Only problem is that the disc has a little handle on it that protrudes so with these disc and caps on you can't stack the bottles.
B002QYW8LW|5|My baby actually enjoys brushing his teeth with this banana toothbrush!
B0069JBKHI|4|Been eyeing on this device for quite sometime...and didn't think I needed it until we moved to a big house. And with 3 under 5s and one on the way, well I think all that nagging to hubby was worth it. Took me less than 10 minutes to set up. I'm not a tech geek, and the manual was more or less straight forward except it didn't tell me how long the monitor can be used for without plugging in or how long u had to charge it for, until I read a review here.<br />I paired it up bluetooth and wireless, then the first thing I did was took a picture and text it to DH. Great quality. My two have been going in n out of their rooms when it's bed time. Not tonight they didn't! They loved the rainbow colours, the 7 lullabys (so far) and they get to hear my voice when they call me. The delay in sound is about 1/2secs but that's expected! I get the alert messages almost immediately too.<br />Only thing is the night vision seems a little on the white side so that needs improving. Also I wish it was a bit more cheaper so I can get a second one. Maybe they should do a deal for two purchase for the price of one?!<br />We had a baby monitor 5 years ago and hardly used it plus the fact there was the extra black n white monitor that needed batteries and had to be carried around. Now its just my iPhone and the sleek boxed camera in a handy bag! no fuss with endless wires, plugs, antenna,batteries and what have u to assemble!<br />Overall I can't wait for the next addition to arrive so I can test it on him! But with 3 already it's perfect especially now as I can really see the mischief they get up too! Lol...
B00005BMDX|5|Although discontinued by manufacturer, my son likes to drink from these bottles as the nipple is slender and the current bottles on market have large base nipple which he finds uncomfortable to drink from.
B003ZYE7F2|4|My son is very pro-active, and I love it.<br />It is not broken. Just I wonder its safety for kids.<br />Some plastic dishes has the Endocrine disruptor, its manual said it was passed the examination.<br />I realy want to believe that.
B0047GNVR2|5|I knew it would meet my expectations. My daughter just felt it wouldn't be worth keeping as she needs to buy a bigger car seat for my grandson as he is tall for his age & expected to outgrow his current car seat by end of summer.
B00769SENS|5|It was a gift for a baby shower, and what do I know about babies or showering them?  Nothing!  Thank goodness for gift registries...  All I know for sure is that the new mom loved it and almost broke my left ear drum while telling me.  A fun phone conversation!
B00FZGLMCY|1|Fell off the genie lid and into the dirty diapers, will not rebuy
B005HK4ICE|1|This product's purpose is not right.  Someone should hold the baby while he or she is being fed.  Don't buy this for yourself or anyone else.
B001LKQRI2|4|great product, I just wish it had a more 'wipeable' cover.  It's great for my home, but not the school setting it was intended for.
B000CF03LE|5|I love the animalamp and have replaced the kids night light. It is portable and great for traveling. i even use it myself for reading so I don't disturb my husband at night time. I love that the lighting is adjustable by just holding the button. You can make it as bright or dim as you want it. AnimaLamp is easy to use and anyone can do it. Great product!
B00H22Q8KK|5|Works fine, has grips on the bottom. Kind of small though.
B001R1I44U|1|I saw the picture, love it. So i order one from this website (i knew the color maybe vary), but the one i got is for boys!!!!!
B00NLZKL9G|1|I expected it to be heavier duty than the flimsy material it is!
B00JS7XYWW|5|This looks like a great product and great company.  I was happy to purchase it for my daughter and granddaughter.<br />Like the adage says, &#34;...a place for everything and everything in its place&#34;!
B001CWB3KG|3|ok
B009M64860|5|good!
B000GE1MEI|5|Works great. He actually likes to put it back in place when we forget to replace it. Meanwhile, a lot of our guests come wandering out of the bathroom looking sheepish because they can't figure out how to open the toilet lid.
B00EI74BVK|4|Honestly, this is a great highchair. I have had a few highchairs for my kids and this one doesn't have any cloth pieces on it, so it is so easy to clean! I also LOVE modern baby gear and this really looks nice in our house and it wasn't all that pricey for what you get. I gave it four stars, though, because the tray could be larger. It's definitely a lot smaller than the other highchairs I've had.<br /><br />I bought the pink seat pad and tray to go with it...it's nice because you can customize the color you want. Overall, I definitely recommend for someone who likes a modern look and an easy-to-clean highchair.
B004DC9TDA|5|We love this stroller! It is an upgrade from the stroller we originally bought. Light, smooth and easy to maneuver.  It packs up easy for road trips, vacations and trips to the park. I would buy this as my first stroller if I had to do it all over.
B006PB2B6O|4|I purchased this car seat to use for my 15 month old grandson.  It is lightweight and fits nicely in the backseat.  Good price for nice quality.
B00SEXBF5E|5|This was also a baby shower gift and she loved it too.  It was very soft and plush.  I recommend it.
B004UJ2CGM|5|Great and looks comfortable my kids still dose not speak so I can't tell you if it really is comfortable.
B003PCYMP4|5|Easy to keep clean.  Easier to keep track of than some other pacifiers that are always getting lost.  Became a &#34;cuddle&#34; toy as well as a pacifier.
B004CLBX2M|5|It's hard to find a wide gate that's also tall and looks good. This as close as I could find to the perfect gate to contain our golden retriever in the kitchen. As others have mentioned, it will not fit every opening as the extra pieces can only be adjusted a small amount with the side screws. Someone left a review with all of the measurements that will work, so check that out if you're unsure. I am concerned that the plastic latch may not hold up over time, but we try not to slam it and if I'm not in a hurry I carefully latch it to make sure it lasts. We used the pressure mount disks and have had no trouble with it moving at all. We had a party and it was nice to be able to take it down for that event. (The paint did come off the wall under one of the disks.)  Glad I found this gate!
B00HZO6WBK|5|My daughter loves this toy it is easy for her tiny hands to pick up and it is bigger than I had expected. With all of the colors it grabs her eye and keeps her attention. She giggles at the cute noises that it makes anytime she touches it or grabs it. At just 5 months old she cuddles it because of its size as well. Definitely a great buy!
B008BQUVU4|5|I love these blankets. They are soft, warm and fuzzy and really easy to use for swaddling. I especially love the designs and that they wash well.
B0026O5UF8|4|The lamp is cute, but the shade had several &#34;dings&#34; on it when it arrived.
B003YKGIUE|5|This is a good quality product, it was exactly what I needed and I am glad that I purchased. I would recommend this product.
B004044LD4|5|Perfect fit for the delta crib we bought! Outside is plastic to wipe clean and firm for baby!
B0000936LR|4|I work as a professional nanny.  My current employers have this gym, and it is a godsend!  The baby (10 weeks) loves the music, colors and flashing lights on the star which can be attached anywhere you want on the gym.  He adored it laying on his back, now I can move it onto a side support and he's happy watching it for some tummy time and I get a much needed break from carrying him around.  It is soft and well constructed, good size for a baby who isn't very mobile yet and hangs toys in good locations for him to bat at.  The only things that could improve are that it doesn't come with many toys (though we have other toys attached to it now) and that the star only has 2 or so songs which are short and repetitive.  It also doesn't have an on and stay on setting, it must be pressed or moved to make the music come back on and baby gets fussy if his star is quiet!  Overall I'd highly recommend this gym for babies that are not yet crawling.
B00701D7KC|4|The only reason I gave this 4 out 5 was because if you don't have your thumb in the exact right place the blades can hit your finger or finger nail. They are sharp enough to cut skin. But it slices perfectly and for how many bananas I slice a day I love it!
B004HFQLIO|3|It's a good value for the money you pay, work great, the steamer is the one who does not do a good job. i will recommend it.
B005BMA53Y|5|Very nice, but only good for small submissive dogs
B009LQFEZU|5|We have been using this diaper for about a month now on our 3.5 month old. It is one of my favorite clothies. The PUL fabric is nice and soft, as is the inside minky lining. The leg gussets are soft, but do a great job of keeping messy poops inside the diaper. The minky inside is surprisingly absorbent, we never have leaks with these (though there is plenty of space to add extra inserts if you wish). I love the aplix because it allows us to fit the diaper perfectly to our baby. And finally, it gives him a nice soft, cushy bum! Oh, and cute prints!<br /><br />The only thing that might be a downside for some folks is that the inner fabric is not natural. . . pretty sure it is made from polyester.
B001QT4AR8|4|I really like this product because we have stone floors and were really nervous for crawling/walking stage. This is a really nice mat with every bit of the intended extra cushion. However, I just don't know what makes it 2-3 times more then the thinner ones in terms of a little extra cushion and makes me raise my eyebrow. But, safety is always priceless I suppose.
B00CXH2M2W|3|These fit the genie fine, but are a little loose. Hey are also a thin plastic and done contain smell well. I also had two of the four rip. Just and fyi I used these in an in home childcare. We change the genie daily. We also had issues with the hoop bending.
B00FOVFB04|5|This powder has been an effective deodorant for me.  The blissful earth has a lavender scent, and the unscented is truly unscented.  I think the powder is soft and I use it daily everywhere on my body and I sprinkle the lavender scented powder on my bedding.  A little bit of powder goes a long way.  This would also make a lovely gift.
B002CGRTFY|5|We wanted something that doesn't distract from the look of our staircase but ultimately be safe for when our granddaughter visits.  This is strong and see through and withstands her weigh on  which is good.  The only issue we had was the gate doesn't hold firm against it.
B0002Q2OPG|4|Our son received this toy as a gift when he was born.  He was most interested in it when he was 5-9 months old.  He liked to play with it while sitting in his high chair while we ate dinner.  Each side of the triangle offers a different activity, so it held his attention for 10-15 minutes at a time.
B005JN6304|5|This is worked even better than planned. We wanted to confine our small dog in the playroom and let our cats roam in and out as they wished. We strongly considered getting the gate advertised here on Amazon with the cat door but realized that the dog could probably pass thru it's as well. We also had to cover a 47 inch span. You can configure this to open one direction or swing both ways. You can use the threaded bolts at either end to leave an opening just wide enough for a cat, but restrict the width of a dog from passing thru. It's easy to open by pressing down on the tab and slightly lifting up on the gate, which can be done with one hand. It will slam closed and latch. Very versatile. It's easy to remove completely as we'll if you avoid screwing in the hinge blocks. We love it and it works great!
B004GCJMLG|2|Installation is fairly easy.  And the locks work well enough for a short time.  But they're not nearly strong enough to be effective.  My son, who just turned 2, has broken lots of these locks over the last few months just by repeatedly pulling on the drawers.  They're too expensive to keep replacing them.
B00014PLAO|1|IT DIDN'T STICK
B00RYWGLAK|1|I haven't used it many times yet but so far it's ok. Not as good as I was hoping but It definitely makes bathing the baby easier on the back. This first disappointing part is the seat does not stay sunctioned to the tub.  So at times it moves when you don't want it to.  Second, I have to put a small towel on it for the baby to sit on because he slides all over.   **Edit to my review -  we used this tonight after not using it for a while to see if we had better results with the baby being bigger.  This product is awful! The baby turned himself and slipped through one of the leg holes and became stuck in a matter of seconds.  We had to break it to get him out of it.  Scared him and he now has scratches all over his back.  I guess there's a reason it's not sold in the US and I wish I had never trusted it to put my son in.
B0042I2BWG|5|Arrived on time and were exactly as described
B00BOS0PUM|4|Great seat!  Comfy, kiddo loves in.  The install can suck it.  Don't install when your kids are waiting to go somewhere.  Don't assemble in the car, take it into the house to put it together.  Putting the rebound bar in WILL drive you to drink.  It will fit, honest.  Look online for tips.  Do have bandaids for your scraped fingers when you're done.  And don't move it unless you have to.  :-p
B004OBZGKA|5|I like this bib a lot, mostly b/c of the velcro neck attachment (a different brand we tried had a string tie and it was more difficult to entice my son to sit still for the tying). The pocked is neither here nor there. Lots of food ends up all over the bib and to the side of it, as well.
B000I2Q0F4|4|I really like Freddie. I expected it to be bigger but the size is just right for baby. Haven't tried it out yet (2 more months til baby arrives) but know from my sister's experience that lamaze toys are wonderful. Be aware that the freddie you receive may be slightly different colors (similar though) than the pictured one.
B0079EQA18|5|The twig and the lawn are a great functional and decorative drying rack for our baby's bottles and parts. Recommended
B001H0GBV4|4|What I like about it: Material is very nice, thick, durable, yet light wt.  Looks very neat and clean, not too bulky.  Fits a lot of things inside it.  I have the black with blue lining - very nice colors.  Lots of pockets on the inside and out.  I like the zipper pockets on the inside. Good quality.    What could be better: Not a fan of the draw string - when open, it makes everything hard to organize/ find if i'm not paying attention to where I'm putting anything.  A little on the smaller side, but still manage to fit enough inside.     I would recommend this to a friend/ family who doesn't need to bring the kitchen sink with them every where they go!
B00C0TS7QS|4|This is the second one I buy because I needed another one on a different location. The first one broke the tiny lid mechanism when we pinched a wipe that was sticking out too much. I had to dissemble it to kind of fix it.<br /><br />It is very convenient and your baby will love it. With cold wipes my baby pissed me as soon as I touched her with the wipe. You seldom will have that with a warm wipe.
B00IRP67MK|4|I love these. I don't love the microfiber inserts (I don't really like any microfiber inserts), but I use them with the Alva bamboo inserts and only have leaks if she sleeps longer than normal (double stuffed). We haven't had any rashes either.<br /><br />I also do not run any covers or pockets through the dryer as a general rule, so hopefully that will help them keep longer.
B000P26UT8|4|I bought one in pink and one in blue as they were for two newborns.  One came her first the other was mailed directly. The blanket is soft and sweet.  It is a nice snuggly blanket.  It is like a sweater knit,
B000O7SR18|4|we bought the mini crip and these sheets are a great value.  it's not easy finding sheets for the smaller crib so we're happy.
B004HFQOLI|5|There are so many bottles.the rush is comfortable! I like the cup for power and I can take the power with me, when I go out.
B000056OV3|1|I hate this product, and I mean that!  I have gone through three of them in a two year period, my son is just about two.  I have called playtex about the problems that I have had, they did not seemed to concered about it, would not even send me replacements, well done, I told everyone how much I HATE my GENIE.  The smell, is unbearable, just as well use a regular garbage pail.  The liners always have tears in them, that is how the smell gets out.  My first one, the top broke off during our first month, took it back, got our second one, with that one, the turner that cuts the bags had broken off, Playtex sent me a whole nother genie, took about a month for it to come though, and my third one, the top broke off of it too.  That was it, I had it.  I do day care in my home so I change about thirty diapers a day, and the smell was just knocking me out, until I found the Diaper Champ, which knocked the diaper genie out of the water.  The product was just great.  No smell yet, and remember thirty diapers a day!  I urge you, I know that people are familar with the diaper genie, but the genie is a thing of the past, the DIAPER CHAMP is the parents champ.  Please check it out before buying the diaper genie and regretting it later.
B00EZR2V1K|1|Doesn't stick to the mac face very well and the cord from the USB port to the companion is no better than the previous cords
B002ITOC7S|4|I bought the Snuza about a month ago.  When I got it, it seemed as though the battery life was depleted, but I went with it anyhow, about 2 weeks ago the alarm started going off for no apparent reason, when the baby was awake.  I took the cover off the back of the Snuza and discovered that the battery was not snapped in the slot all the way, so that would explain the alarm going off so randomly.<br /><br />I have since bought a replacement battery and haven't had any issues since.  I like that it has a ticking sound option, I use the ticking at night and during naps just use the snuza with out the ticking.<br /><br />I would have given this product 5 stars had the battery not been depleted when I received it.  Plus if the diaper isnt' hooked tight enough or there are gaps the alarm will also sound.  Or if the diaper gets too full overnight, the snuza will come away from the belly and alarm goes off.  Have had this happen twice.<br /><br />Overall a great product and would recommend it to anyone.
B000LXQVA4|5|My daughter is 7 months old and she just loved jumping in the jumperoo. She finds all the toys very interesting especially the one with music and lights. Even the hanging toys are pretty attractive to her. Overall a very good product, no hassles in assembling. Good quality and very sturdy. Baby happy, parents happy !
B003TU83SE|1|Very greasy/oily feel.  The grease got tracked on the floors.  Very dangerous product.  I used it for about an hour & put it away.  I don't know what to do with it.  It's too dangerous to give away, but I don't know how to dispose of it safely.<br /><br />It might be ok for a garage, but definitely not for a playroom.
B007SIZS1S|5|I tried what seemed like all the bottles available on the market and this was the only one my baby would drink from. I exclusively breastfed until my son was 4 months old and realized quickly when I went back to work, he would need to take a bottle. I bought a plethora of bottles and this was the only one he would drink from. I'm very happy with the product and so is my little one. :)
B004I5BU7A|3|We had looked at the Clek Oobr Booster Car seat at a baby shop 90 miles from our home, and so we had what we thought was a pretty good idea of what we were getting.<br />So when this car seat arrived we were terribly disappointed in the fabric. IT was nothing like the colored fabrics!<br />As soon as we pulled it from the box our granddaughter, who was so excited that it was coming, reached out, touched it and immediately pronounced it \\"Prickly & Scratchy,\\" and \\"not at all like the green or blue one...\\"<br /><br />The seat installs beautifully, with the rigid latch system, but the fabric made it a no go.<br />Ella has very sensitive skin and just sitting in the seats while we made the car seat adjustments, caused her legs to rash...<br />So... back it went, sadly.
B0084BEYYA|1|I thought that this would be the solution to my baby monitor problem.  We have a large house and traditional baby monitors don't have the range to work for us.  We have a solid, commercial grade Wi-Fi network (Cisco Aeronet) in our house that gives us full coverage through every room.  When I received the product I attempted to perform the initial setup.  The included directions are pretty sparse and very dumbed down so the setup looked like it would be easy.  I downloaded the app from the Apple app store on both my iPhone and my iPad.  After following the directions to the T the app simply could not locate the baby monitor.  Thinking that I had a bad unit I tried the second unit that I had purchased.  I tried all of the troubleshooting tips on the Baby Ping website and none worked.  I sent an e-mail to the tech support dept at Baby Pink and they took a full 3 days to get back to me.  Their only advice was to un-install the app from my iPhone / iPad and then re-install it.  After doing this and still not having any success I replied to the e-mail from tech support and I still have not heard back (that was 2 days ago).  I have decided that this product is just too unreliable to chance having it not work and ending up with an angry baby crying all night.  I am retuning the product to Amazon and will be exploring some other options.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!
B0045I6IA4|5|My baby loves these! She will not tolerate the other types of pacifiers, she only likes these super suit is. I think it's because they more so mimic the shape of an actual nipple. They are great because they are actually cheaper than the other types of pacifiers as well. Use with a universal pacifier clip and you are good to go!
B009796ELE|5|it is a great cup for my son, though the little boy who is the same age (21months) has found it easy to open and will bump it all out if he is mad at my son.
B00GRS9YME|3|The squirt toy broke after one week. his arm fell off and no amount of super glue will keep it on
B008S00EOG|5|Very cute. Well made. Can't wait to see my great niece sitting in it, reading her books.
B00EFQXLW4|4|Works great in the car. Love the color and it's not too big. Baby seems very comfortable in it.
B001BPZHQ0|5|work well
B008KG5R6I|3|My kids love this thing, they won't go to sleep with out it. Sadly, it only works like it should for less than a year.<br /><br />The turn table stopped turning about about 8 months.<br />and the cord shorts out about the same time, I have to fiddle with the cord every night now to get it to turn on.
B0031U0UI8|5|I wasn't planning on buying the footmuff for our Quinny Buzz 3, but our winter has been really awful and both my son and I were sick of getting all bundled up to go walk the dog. I was tired of how long it was taking to get ready to go out, he was uncomfortable with all the layers and I think he was getting a little cold despite being bundled up. Installation of the footmuff into the Quinny was fairly straightforward. You thread the straps through it and that's all there is to it. It's basically like a mini sleeping bag for your stroller.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*Fits the Buzz 3 perfectly<br />*Will last for quite a while - my son is 11 months old now, but this is big enough that I think it will still work next winter<br />*Warm & snuggly<br />*Matches the stroller colors<br />*No need for bulky layers - put the baby in the footmuff, zip it up, and he's snug as a bug<br />*Great protection from cold wind<br />*Really cuts down on the time required to get ready to go out on a walk in the cold<br /><br />Cons:<br />*Expensive<br />*Need an extra blanket inside on especially cold days<br />*Would be nice to be able to take this off without undoing straps<br /><br />You'd be amazed by how many adults have said they wish they had something similar when they see my son in this while we're out on walks :)
B005178CU2|3|It is cute, but the music and rotation don't last long. If I had known, I wouldn't have purchased it.
B00Q3FGUY6|1|We have tried everything to get this thermometer to work. It reads a different temp (on the same person, same location) every time. Most of the time it reads very low (so low it is clearly not accurate). One time we used it in the ear and it read 102.8 let it reset and used it in the ear and it read 96.7. Tried everything.
B004AHKUHM|3|I'm only giving this 3 stars because I like the unit, but disappointed in the range. I live in a fairly small 1 story home (1,700 square feet). I previously bought a unit that advertised working up to 1,000 feet and putting the main unit in the baby's room and the other unit in our bonus room (other end of our small home) resulted in it beeping multiple times a day trying to connect with the main unit. This unit doesn't have that happen as often, but it still happens more than I think it should. I actually don't think it should happen at all since this unit advertises a range up to 2,000 feet. The clip on the parent unit, doesn't work super well (doesn't have that extra piece of plastic to hold onto your pocket or whatever). I also wish it had the feature of being able to mute the sound completely (while just displaying lights for the amount of noise). I like being able to put it on vibrate. And I LOVE that it has a rechargeable battery. So nice. So much better than having to replace batteries every week depending on usage.
B003UMNAPC|5|It's perfect - just what I was looking for!
B00IM8FX0E|2|the box is broken and all bags arround the box
B001IYJIDM|5|Exactly what I was expecting
B005K2IV1I|5|excellent product.  was a given as a gift for a Hello Kitty collector.  Thank you very much for all your assistance.
B00GUN3Z1W|2|It snapped the first time I tried to use it. I didn't attempt to return it. The shipping would not have been worth it. :(
B00TXQ8UCM|5|Fast delivery!!!! Exactly as described.
B00P8831WI|3|Cute, but can't plug in, turns itself off to save batteries,  and not very bright. My daughter loves it, but it's not a nightlight.
B0087SHDQ6|5|Beautiful and soft!
B009YSYCZS|4|A must-have for all breastfeeding moms... Especially stay at home moms! It's always necessary to express a little milk every now and then if your baby sleeps too long or if you're trying to increase your supply. So this is great because it is inexpensive, portable, and works really great!!! It's also a plus that it's compatible with all avent bottles. So I can literally pump it into a bottle and hand it directly to my husband to feed our daughter.<br /><br />My one complaint (and why it's not 5 stars) is that it's noisy. I've seen quite a few people mention this. It's squeaks with each pump... Which is super annoying if you're trying to pump in the same room as your sleeping infant. Wonder if there's a way to stop that...?
B004LKS944|4|We bought this highchair to use as an extra highchair for our home and as a travel highchair when we're visiting friends/family who dont have one that we can use. For the price this highchair cannot be beat. The #1 thing I needed was something that could fold up and fit btwn the walk and the fridge (since we dont use it everyday) and this fits the bill perfectly! Its easy to fold too which is a plus. A lot of people complained about how the seat was too reclined but I don't find this to be the case. My baby is 9 months old though and is very capable of sitting himself upstraight without assistance. He seems just as happy in this chair as he does in his spacesaver chair. For the price I paid (under $40) I have no complaints.
B00IPGFWC2|5|Perfect! Fits about 4 cloth diapers in the small pocket or maybe 8 in the large part. Exactly what I needed.
B008CDR7LW|2|Got this for my daughter and my son for when they take bath time, it floats and that is about it. The rings and the curve of the legs are too much for the kids to enjoy - both my wife and I tried numerous times to see if you could actually land a ring on the legs but it never caught once. My kids have more fun just chewing on the rings than playing with the toy.
B001PKYWYE|5|I love this system, part of me wishes it was smaller like the round cup from munchkin, but these easily hold more so as your baby grows and needs the 6-8 oz bottles plus rice, this works well. I went back and order the vegetable set for when we move into solids and I thinks that will be great. I also ordered extra lids from the Innobaby website.
B00ADEL5VG|4|This laundry hamper is in my daughter's nursery.  It is a high quality item and well constructed, and I like that it stands up well and that the interior is wipeable.  However, it is definitely expensive for a laundry hamper!  I have never spent more than $5 on one for myself.  But, her nursery has an animal theme, and the predominant color is turquoise, so I couldn't resist.  I do not regret the purchase, but I do think it was a little indulgent on my part.
B005MQRAAK|5|We bought this carseat to replace an Evenflo Triumph because we had a third child and I couldn't fit the Triumph, a booster, and an infant carseat base in the backseat of my 2005 Honda Accord.  This seat is narrow enough that I can fit all three children across but it's still comfortable for my two year old (26 lbs) and seems very safe. I plan to buy another of these when my infant reaches 20 lbs and is too big for his infant carrier.
B00CXH2M2W|5|Works for diaper genie and it's cheaper.
B002968T5G|5|Wore this every day to and from work. Was great for 20+ minute car trips, it's was great for multi tasking. Won't do it any other way. I recommend this to all my breast feeding friends.
B00SHQMEGC|5|Great for my baby nursery! I think its great that they did not make the words do no overlap on this one, so I can cut the letters to arrange them how I like. We love singing this song to our babies, so it is just a great addition!<br /><br />[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]
B000056C86|5|This playard is wonderful !!! i have a twist and tumbler 6 month old and trying to keep him from rolling over on his floor gym and banging his head every corner was more work than i could actually get done. The playard is sooo colorful, the bugs attached to the mesh wall are large and cute, reacheable for your kicker and very entertaining. My son loves to kick the bee and make it rattle and even more, i dont have to worry if hes rolling under the couch any more because he is safe and secure inside this really cute spacious playard. Also, the mat is heavy padded, very comfortable for your little one. This product is well-made, not cheap looking at all. Worth your money !! you wont regret it.
B003CUXV0Q|5|My old dog loves his new bed! Durable and comfy.
B004DC9TAI|2|Have loved our single BOB, couldn't wait for the new style double.  Went to REI and we were so dissapointed.  The shade cover has so much extra material especially the see through window....our 2 year old had his face covered in it when the shade is retracted back so he can see around.  We worked with the staff at trying to roll and tuck it and just couldn't feel good about it.  Even the sales people said it was bad.  The new single allows you to take the rear flap and wrap around it and velcro it.  However the double doesn't.  Wanted to purchase but are now searching for last years model.
B00M9ZQZ3A|5|My baby loves bath time and these toys have made it more fun! The whale sticks to the wall and stores all of his toys neatly; he likes to play with it during the bath and watch the water drain out.  I was pleasantly surprised to find different shapes on the bottom of each of the bath cups. The bath cups have been a good way for me teach him shapes. He likes to try and stack them inside each other try to spray me with water using the Squirter Toy.
B00BFI2GBM|5|Amazing seller , product has promised.  Mother to b got many of these .  Return was painless.  Thank you
B00BEVSSDA|4|Works great, but cheaper at Walmart.
B00L9NR672|5|Bought 2 of them---one for myself and one for a family member.  Love this product. Have had it for only 2 weeks and give this product high marks (5 stars).  Easy to operate and no assembly required---just fill it if water, any water soluble oils you prefer and water.  The lights are beautiful and serve as a night light during sleep time.  The unit turns itself off once all the water has evaporated.  There is no condensation on the table I have it on---the plume shoots up about 5 inches from the unit. Have recommended this product to others.  Extremely quiet unit.  One 100ml room-temperature water added to the unit lasts about 5 hours, as advertised. Great price as well.  Can't say enough good things about this unit---if you are in the market to buy an oil diffuser, this is the one to pick. Delivery was on time.
B00GKCAR00|5|Cheap, strong, small, very good lights (2 level of intensity). Perfect!
B000XT30G4|5|I bought this gate to keep our 7lb Chiweenie contained in our family room.  The entrance is quite a bit larger than a regular door opening. This fit perfectly and it is very sturdy. We bought another gate for a spare bedroom to keep the dog contained while we are at work, and I'm sad that I didn't get 2 of these gates.
B0019AJADI|1|Bought this laminated baby bag from seller. Bought product as new. The bag included a changing pad prepackaged and placed within baby bag. When we opened the changing pad there were blood and fecal stains! Yuck. This is a biohazard. Went to return bag for a replacement and seller/amazon will not allow replacement. That is okay, will return and get refund....not sure what else we would find if we got another bag from this seller.
B000GKU7C0|5|Loved this toothbrush! My daughter loved just having it in her mouth and I loved that she was &#34;brushing&#34; with it. It is super  strong but soft and she never managed to chew through it.
B000096QQ5|5|for a breastfeeding mom who only uses a bottle now and then for feeding and breast pumping, the medela steam bag is a very easy product to use for steam cleaning baby's bottles and other breast pump items..  highly recommended!!
B000XSJII4|2|It is way too short and even though it says it is expandable...the opening is not so it really is for a small doorway. I dont like the closure mechanism.  It is very stylish and looks nice, but I am buying a new one...
B000RFC3BM|1|I don't know why the pics online are so turgidly big.
B00099MA2I|5|I absolutely love these socks!  They're so soft after washing, and they fit well.  perfect!
B006WU9TQI|3|The velcro is so convenient and nice, until you wash it. It attracts fuzz, hair, and the velcro warps. The button top All in Ones by thirsties look like a bigger pain, but they arent. With the velcro, you have to worry about warping, ripping, and it eventually not sticking well enough. Velcro thristies only fit my son up to 16.5 pounds, but the button top size ones fit my son up to 18 pounds like it says, and he is a big boy. at 18lbs and 25 inches long, I was afraid I would have to buy size 2 by 15lbs, but not with the button tops.<br /><br />On another note, thirsties all in ones are super convenient and easy. Great product, few leaks. Change your baby ever 2-3 hours and leaks are almost never an issue. After a few months use, if you start to smell bad smells, or notice less absorbancy, just &#34;strip them.&#34; you can find how to very easily do this on google or youtube.<br /><br />I love my CDs. (except at night, then I use a disposable overnight, and a thirsties duo wrap to prevent blow outs).
B007OWHDS4|5|great
B00BV0ESHY|1|This was a waste of money for us.  My toddler easily popped it off the table, making it useless.
B005FSELAW|5|Wanted this for my preschooler then saw it on a Taylor swift video and had to get it. Its little, so daycare or preschool back pack is all its really good for. Can't fit a binder in it. The lunch box stays very cold and is equally as cute.
B000BNQC58|4|I purchased the turtle and the sea turtle for my boys and they love both! We had issues with our first turtle but the retur/exchange proces was painless. The positioning of the turtle makes the stars and moon reflect differently, so there can be a different experince every night! There is moderate lighting and a choice of colors (amber,green or blue) which my 3 yr old loves!
B00ASI6Z0S|3|It's okay and I do use it everyday. It serves the purpose, although I would have like to to be larger in size.
B002ASE88K|5|Cute little bank to give as a gift and very unique too. I'd get another to have for more gifts.
B00G3H0G2G|3|Not the sturdiest material and has a habit of tipping towards the children.
B0019LREU8|1|The only good thing about his chest is how nice it looks, but otherwise it's cheap quality material. Just assemble the whole thing and put it at one place, don't move it around, otherwise what we have found is that the sides are moving apart and therefore drawers are falling down. Very annoying. I tried tightening the screws, it was OK for a couple of weeks and then again the same problem. I have another 3-drawer shelf from IKEA, which I bought at about half the price. We have been using it for 4 years and it is still rock solid.
B00H8MRBIW|5|great product
B000O3JTDM|4|I love this bottle and my daughter do so! but after a year the cap broke.... I'm trying to find a replacement cap but I don't know if this is possible!.... so bad!!! if it's so supposed to be for kids they should have replacement parts...
B00CSE308K|5|I've waited two months to test these hooks out on my Britax stroller before reviewing them and these hooks are a MUST HAVE accessory for your stroller. The best part is being able to have your hands free when you have a bunch of stuff to carry.<br /><br />STRONG: I've carried everything imaginable with the these hooks from very heavy groceries, to my briefcase, to shopping bags at the mall. These hooks handled them without a problem. I have these hooks attached at an awkward 45 degree angle on the side of the stroller and I haven't noticed any bending or cracking. *The only caution is to remember not to weigh the stroller when the baby's not in there or else the it'll tip over!<br /><br />VERSATILE: The hooks can attach to various parts of stroller with strong velcro straps so you can attach them at the handle, or if you're like me, along the sides (behind the cup holder attachment). The hook base swivels at the point of attachment and the actual hook has 360 rotation. I can also rotate then entire hook at the velcro in case I need to adjust the hook for longer items that hang too low.<br /><br />*UPDATE (six months later - JUNE 8, 2014)*<br /><br />I really hate to update my review after a bunch of people found it helpful but I have to update folks on the strength of the hooks. I'm still keeping my 5-star review, but after really abusing these hooks they both broke.<br /><br />(1) The first one started to break after hanging way too many groceries on it (four cartons of juice in one bag, plus two other heavy bags) and the hook popped out of its socket. I was able to pop it back in but the socket was never the same after that and the hook would often pop out with lighter (but still heavy) loads. The hooks and socket are plastic so there is a reasonable limit to them. Don't go uber crazy with them and you will be fine.<br /><br />(2) The second hook broke after I folded my stroller and threw it in the trunk of my car. I heard a snap and found the hook broke clean right at the joint. I guess the hook was sticking out and the stroller landed right on it.<br /><br />I still stand by my versatility comments. My wife got metal hooks for our stroller now and they don't rotate etc. I prefer the multiple degrees of freedom these have.
B006SFUCT0|5|Love this bottle warmer, ive had a few others in the past...This one is easy to use and is accurate at heating.Thanks
B0060INZK8|5|Works great for my almost 3yr old! And we are able to take it anywhere we want with no hassle, it just folds down!
B00005BTNA|5|I have a 4 yr old and a 1 month old and I used Avent bottles with my 4 yr old. But they always leaked when he would suckle his formula he'd squirt formula by the corner of his mouth. But they were so popular that I stuck with them. Now with my newborn, I bought Avents and had the same problem and decided to try out the Playtex AirVents (wide ones) and they are heaven sent! No milk squirting from his mouth while he suckles and dont have to pause the bottle to let the air build up out. He just suckles and suckles non stop till he's done with his bottle. It's great! Oh! And with Avents, my newborn would also choke when he'd be drinking and with Playtex AirVents that problem ended! These are the bottles Im stinking to.
B00FLVPYH2|5|It looks amazing in the boys bedroom!!
B009Z4W140|3|Works great but the rubber lining has started to come off
B003MUA5U0|5|Loving this product. I was looking for a way to pre-measure and store my baby's formula and the cheaper options found in store weren't working as formula would leak between containers. This products solves that problem and its very nice and easy to use. I'm able to carry as many as I want, whether is 1 or all 4. Haven't used with liquids but for the purpose I needed is perfect.
B0000936LR|5|I love this gym--and so does my son! The arches are sturdy--I attached 4 more of my own toys with the extra links they supplied and it doesn't bend. I like how it is &amp;quot;educational&amp;quot; in nature--the book, picture frame and animals on the mat are great for teaching baby. The music mobile can be played when baby touches anything on the mat, or it can be played in timer mode. Another plus of this gym in the support pillow that comes with it--looks like half of a boppy pillow. It's great for tummy time.       I also have the Tiny Love Deluxe Gymini but prefer the Baby Einstein. The arches on the Einstein gym are higher so the dangling toys don't hit my son like they do on the Tiny Love gym. This is a great play gym!!!
B004VL2VRO|1|did not work correctly
B0061O38UI|4|Love that it has organic cotton for the parts that touch baby's most sensitive areas. I have yet to have a leak out of the sides in this diaper (always a positive thing ;)However, i do think that if you let enough liquid build up it would seep some through the outer layer (so just dont use it overnight)  Be aware that the snaps are the opposite of what you are used to doing with  a diaper... I think they work just fine and have no trouble with that design at all but I know some people (esp maybe dads who dont typically diaper...;) may have anissue.<br />Overall, very pleased withthis product.
B0007XHLP2|4|The diecast Jay Jay planes are much more durable and resistant to chipping unlike their wooden counterparts. However, I do not recommend them for young children. They make nice display pieces and even can be played with. Unfortunately, they only made Jay Jay, Herky, Snuffy, and Tracy in diecast. Therefore, I recommend the wooden toys for playing with since they have all 14 and the diecast for displaying. Watch out for the Herky though, the little loop on the top of the plane is VERY EASY to snap off.
B00HB0Y12K|5|This helmet is awesome! It fits my 1 year old perfectly in the smallest setting so I know we'll get some use out of it for the next couple of years. It's light so it doesn't bother her and it looks super cute. I was happy to find a helmet that didn't have silly graphics on it. I wish they made adult helmets-I'd order one for myself.
B007F30DKM|5|Got these one for my granddaughter to use when we go to Church. She has 4 in all. She loves them all!
B004G8QSYO|5|the seller is quite good,and i'm very satisfied with this toy
B002UD6612|5|Nice for pack and play changing table or for BF laying down :)
B000BUQNT6|3|Easy to carry around place and clean. I use it when we go shopping for groceries or even when dining at restaurants. Any statains, just throw it in the washer and good as new. I bought the blue zoo one even tho I have a little girl. Doesn't make a difference. The only thing I would have done different is that I would have chosen one that maybe has a little toy or something attached to use as a distraction. But hey for less than $20 I cant complain!!
B006ZSYGOW|5|These are so great. Lightweight and cute designs. Perfect for sleeping, or just to cover up. Great as a multipack
B0007OD8SU|4|Have realistic expectations when buying this video monitor and you'll be happy with your investment. The picture quality is good (especially in dimly lit rooms), the video camera head is very light weight and tilts in four directions (ours hangs on the wall just above the crib suspended on a thumb tack!), and the battery so far has been really good (I've forgotten to plug it in a few nights and it's still juiced up). So, realistic expectations...<br /><br />1) Don't expect to see the same vivid imagery of your baby that they promote in their packaging. Most likely you'll be setting up the monitor a safe distance from your baby's head/body so you'll get a more complete picture of your baby's body- not the close-up mug shots featured in the ads. The colors will not be as vibrant either, unless your little one has an affinity for sleeping in a very brightly lit room.<br /><br />2) Do expect some feedback on your receiver. There are six degrees of 'noise' (green to red) to alert you of sounds in the room. I've become accustomed to only paying attention when I see it register 4+ repeatedly and with some length (feedback registers short bursts of 4+ and is common for my house). The feedback is audible so unfortunately I have to turn the sound down very very low at night (just enough to hear a cry), or I am awakened by the hisses all night.<br /><br />3) You can't control how long the video display stays on when the received is not plugged into the wall, so if you're downstairs and want to see your baby constantly you will need it to be plugged in. Otherwise it will go to sound-only after about 3 minutes.<br /><br />I would prefer that it came with two video monitors, because sometimes baby falls asleep in another 'regular' nap spot that you'd like to watch. Also it would be great if it were possible to move the video head remotely (so that when baby squirms out of view you can find her) but I don't expect to see that on a household product such as this. Overall I've been really happy with this tool, aside from the feedback annoyances, which channel switching doesn't seem to fix. (We do have a wireless router and cordless phones throughout the house)de from the feedback annoyances, which channel switching doesn't seem to fix.

B00FFG46P4|5|This ornament is perfect for a keepsake. It is a hefty weight and hangs beautifully.  It looks so sophisticated and not so corny like most baby things.  It blends in with the tree perfectly and I LOVE the way it looks with the antiqued accent colors.  The charm that sayd &#34;my 1st&#34; is really cute. Not too over the top, just subtle and tasteful.  I absolutely love this ornament for my daughters annual collection. Great quality, great look.
B003IGTOMI|5|Aden and Anais is doing something right, because my baby absolutely loves this material. These are great lovies b/c they are easy to pack and lightweight, so I don't worry about leaving them in his crib. The stuffed animal ones seem too bulky to leave in the crib. They are really easy to clean and super soft
B000FCW15U|5|Saw this product at a friend's house, and our 2 (now 3) month old son loves it.  He used to cry almost every time we put him down to change, now he looks in the mirror and if we rattle the lions feet he smiles.  It also is able to hang flush with the wall and be pulled down for changing time.
B00IR7ST9M|5|I had a little bit of trouble deciding to buy these because of the mixed, often contradictory, reviews. However, I just received these, and I am pleasantly surprised! They are exactly what I was hoping for. The pearl and gems in the center are lovely, and the roses are full, soft, and seem to be sewn securely enough. Yes, they look like they're fraying, but that's the style these are going for. Yes, they're likely to get ratty eventually, but what hair accessory doesn't? They'll serve their purpose just fine. I was happy to find that these fit my five year old and my 2-month old, although they do have to stretch quite a bit to fit my five year old (despite having to stretch them, she says they're comfortable, thinks they're amazing, and can't wait to wear them). The sizes do vary a little bit. One of the larger ones I received (lying flat) is seven inches from end to end (14 inches round, total) and one of the smaller ones is 6.75 inches from end to end (13.5 inches round). The elastic is nice and stretchy but not too binding, and the area under where the flowers are sewn has felt so it's comfortable on heads. The colors are what is pictured, although the band on the peach headband is slightly more orange than the attached flowers. Overall, I'm very pleased.
B004BDNJJQ|4|Bulky but effective and the sizing options are some of the best I've seen.
B000BKX4NY|5|I love it and have received several comments from passers by.The baby sits in it great and it is easy and comfortable to push.
B00L8917AY|4|Very good material but is a bit snug after a cold wash and low dry on my mini crib
B003ULP592|5|Works great, now if I can just get my 3 year old to sleep in his bed!!!
B00318CMF4|5|The color is amazing!! My baby is comfortable in his chair!! I convert my single stroller to double stroller with this chair and looks great, easy to use....is de best stroller!!
B00PB5NDPI|4|These crib sheets have a nice soft quality and feel to them. They had a slight chemical smell when I removed from package which was surprising for organic bedding, which is why I didn't give it a 5 star. The odor disappeared after washing and drying.
B00FLXBHE4|5|Met expectations
B004J34TF6|5|Excellent
B0015B7WVS|5|Excellent!!!!!
B001FB5BFW|5|We purchased this seat when our son was 2 years old. We never used it as rear-facing so I can't comment on that but as forward-facing, he's been nothing but content. He falls asleep all the time riding in it, loves having his own cup holder and now that he's almost 3 1/2 and taller for his age (42.5 inches) the straps are still high enough for him. He can buckle himself which he enjoys (I always check). We've been nothing but happy with this product.
B005BSXFEY|4|Hiah quality materials with a cute look. The switch is perfect as you only have to push it rather than turn it. This is the perfect size for a child's night stand.
B005MQR9TM|5|Great purchase! My kids love it.
B009EM3THG|5|My 3 month old loves this toy, easy to grab and lightweight enough for her. Loves trying to grab it and shake it.
B001MS82HM|4|Great product worked as expected
B005UV0USQ|5|Excellent three in one pack and play. Travels easily and very convenient for changing the baby. We expect it to last for a long time.
B002QYW8LW|1|My 9 month old loooooves this thing!  It is the best teething toy he has and I think it's because the shape is similar to a finger whereas most teething toys are rings. He even likes this more than Sophie! I wish I had gotten it a long time ago.<br /><br />Update, my second kid stared using this and loved it, but I discovered some if the toothbrush &quot;bristles&quot; fell off! Luckily I caught one on his big before he swallowed it. This is extremely dangerous
B0011ECP9S|5|Bought this for adapter for my daughter to use while traveling.  She has been very pleased with the charger.  I would recommend.
B000058CC4|5|For the first week of his life, my son hated his crib. He could not sleep anywhere but in our arms. Then my mom thought to try this sleep positioner, which I had received as a shower gift. He will now sleep in his crib, allowing us to have some time to get things done (with two hands!) during the day. The positioner helps him to feel safe and cuddled while sleeping independently.
B000O7SR18|5|Sheet fit great
B006J9TVJM|5|This is by far the best and easiest to use baby carrier on the market. There are other baby carriers out there that hold the baby at the crotch, which can hinder their hip and leg development. This carrier hold all the way to the knees which is best for baby. The two clips that secure the harness are easy to snap, even if you are by yourself, you can get this contraption on. Everything is adjustable so that mommy and daddy can wear the baby. Daddy takes our daughter on hikes once a week wearing this. The zipper pockets hold cell phone keys and sunglasses. The best part is the shade over the top of the baby that snaps onto the straps. We live in AZ where sun protection is a must. I can also nurse my baby in public without anyone knowing. I just cover her head with the shade. Love this and use it on a daily basis.
B00AH8J448|5|excellent product, very good
B00TGLVNCS|4|As a single piece, this can be a little hard to tie on, but otherwise is soft, comfortable, and easy to clean. The height is good enough that the baby cant pull it down easily, and its stiff enough it wont fold up.
B003IT4YAM|5|Absolutely love the seat! Delivery was fast!
B00005JIVI|5|I got this for my second son when he was born.  I love it.  I placed it on my counter next to the sink when I wanted him to have a quick bath and now have placed it in the tub so that he can float in the water.  I love the fact that when your done you can just hang it up to dry.  What I really like is your not dealing with a hard plastic tub for a newborn which can be uncomfortable for the baby.  This is a must have for all parents.
B005MQRAAK|3|I am very impressed with the quality of the materials for this car seat. I feel my son is very safe in this seat, and like the fact that it can be used from infant to 120 lbs. However, this seat was somewhat difficult to assemble. The directions that came with the seat were confusing, particularly with the anchoring features and additional strap options. Also, this seat is very heavy!  The backpack strap and fold-up option made me hopeful that this seat would work well for traveling. However, its weight is very limiting
B003OH0W90|1|We bought this well before the arrival of our son and once he came, we were very disappointed that out Graco Sungride Click Connect 35 does not fit. It fits the Graco Snugride 35, but not the Click Connect model. It's past 30 days so we are stuck with a piece of metal that's useless.
B0068IERUC|3|Some of the finish chipped off to white underneath. Some of the drawer pulls are stiff. They shift back-and-forth just a little bit when you try to close them. Not good for kids opening and closing drawers.<br />I didn't have too much trouble assembling it by myself. Overall it looks pretty good.
B00K1AIIMG|5|Fit great!
B0080S0YSM|2|This decal is much smaller than what is shown in the picture next to the chair.  It also didn't stick to the wall...this is the 3rd decal from china that I've had to throw away.
B00HVSVFNA|3|I like everything about this teething necklace, except for the fact that it isn't red, as the name would suggest.  It's dark orange.
B003CN0V7Y|5|Works like a dream for nail trimming safely and efficiently on both my kids.  Highly recommend this product. Makes life easier
B005X3MNV8|5|I would highly recommend it.Love the colors on it<br />easy to use and looks great on any wall. I went with the jungle babies theme for my son and this went perfectly with it
B006IKTYL2|4|This product does not come with the Ottoman, the Ottoman is an additional $270.00  I think the picture with the chair and Otooman is misleading especially for the price of $700.
B001GQ2SA2|4|We got this for a shower gift and installed it right away.  We had intended on using it to lull our daughter to sleep at night, but she seemed more distracted by it than calmed, so we developed a different nighttime strategy.  Instead I incorporated it into our morning routine.  After feeding and changing her in the morning, I would start the mobile and put her under it to watch the animals and listen to the music.  Since the timer has a 20 minute duration, it gave me just enough time to take a shower and dry my hair in the morning.  Fantastic!  She is now seven and a half months old and it is still part of our morning routine.  I tried to get the remote to work, but was never successful, which is why I can't give the product five stars.      I recently discovered by accident that the remote for our JVC compact stereo *will* active the mobile using either the on/off switch or (weirdly) the tuner up/down toggle.
B000066665|5|My grandson outgrew his expensive &#34;mommy & me&#34; tub within 1-1/2 months (he's a big baby).  My daughter purchased this product & my grandson loves bath-time!  (Sometimes &#34;bath-time&#34; is more than once a day when's he's fussy.)  He loves this duck so much, I just had to get one for my home.  Great value, great price & baby love &#34;ducky&#34;!
B00ETE7MI6|5|They all worked great. I have a phone again! Now I have them stashed all over my house so I won't lose them.
B000221YPG|5|I was browsing when I came across this set for the nursery, the exact set we purchased for my daughter. We knew she was having a boy but she loved the sage and golden tones. We purchased the set and she did have problems with the sheets shrinking but she received so many plain sage and gold sheets that it didn't really matter. My wife is a crafter of all sorts of crafts and she made plaques, light switchplates and outlets, lamp and lamp shade, and even a area rug. My daughter purchased the mobile but didn't open it until she put the final touches on the nursery and noticed there was several pieces missing so she was never able to use it as a mobile but the wife hung them from the knobs on the dresser. The nursery is so cozy and warm and perfect for a boy or girl(she's having another one in 4 months!)Jonah won't even be 2 when he/she arrives and she's going to purchase a plain sage bedspread for his toddler bed which he will share the room with his new brother or sister.
B0012ZK17O|1|the adhesive for this corner guard is awful. it's almost impossible to separate the double sided tape and once you do it is very flimsy. i dont know if other ones are better, just that this one is awful.
B00PTL3SX6|5|I love everything about this chair. The adjustable back, the multiple trays, the various heights, the ease of adjusting, the ease of cleaning, the wheels, the sleep-inducing comfort it provides irritable Sandman fighters! Oh! It is the absolute best! Best of all, it matches her play yard and car seat! YAY!!
B004Y9AKLM|5|I bought this stroller for my grand daughter.  I am very happy with the quality and it arrived quickly after I purchased.  I definitely recommend this stroller.
B00JV8GUE2|5|100% recommend this pillow for toddlers! It's the perfect size & great quality. It's also extremely convenient that this pillow is now on amazon.com.
B004071ZO4|5|I purchased this as a baby gift to give.  It is soo adorable and my friend is looking forawrd to the baby growing into it.
B00GJ93HNS|5|Great piece of furniture. It will definitely serve as more than just a changing table once our baby is potty trained. :)
B000LPN9OS|5|I saw this had a bad review and just couldn't believe it!    We ordered this in 2007.  It came with one damaged side and had a paint drip mark.  We contacted LA Baby and they quickly sent us out a brand new side, no charge, and we didn't have to send he damaged side back!  Awesome!    Assembly wasn't too difficult for my husband - the door didn't have pre-drilled holes so he had to measure and do those himself, but other than that, I think he had this together in less than an hour.    One drawer sticks a bit/falls off the track a little on one side, but not even enough to bother a perfectionist like me!    The paint/glossy finish is beautiful.  It cleans very well.  We've had it for 3.5 years now and have zero paint chips/scuffs!  We recently switched out the boring drawer pulls for some cute ceramic ones that match my daughter's room and now I love the dresser even more.    Love the \\"bars\\" on each side - we hung a diaper stacker from one side and it was perfect for it!  On the other side, I had those toy links to hold a toy my daughter could play with (and couldn't throw off) during diaper changes.  It fits a changing pad and the Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot on top with room to spare.    This dresser is very large and VERY heavy.  Put it together near where you want it!  I put some sliders underneath it so I can scoot it out/over if I need to in order to retrieve a dropped item and it's a little easier, but still very heavy.    Love it though and highly recommend it.  This is a very beautiful piece, high quality, and at a great price when you compare it to high end furniture stores who sell similar for 3 times this price!
B00BYGR3OA|4|Wonderfull stroller, handles great and we love the rear-facing function. The hood is to short for my liking, it barely shields the baby from the sun, we had to buy an additional canopy.
B00EYDTTHE|5|Amazing quality, love the adjustable snaps and the box they came in is beautiful and will be a great storage box for years and years it's so high quality!!!
B0002IK9CY|1|Like many others, I knew what these were already, so I didn't look carefully or read reviews.  Expected four but only one turned up.  Disappointed.
B00CI4PKKG|5|My daughter loves this!! And it was so easy to put together 5 stars for me!
B0069MDTD8|5|I wished I would have bought this bag the first time. We bought this after our first diaper bag had seen better days. I like that each section is labeled and the pouch on the outside which is great for keys and cellphone storage!
B002H0JDPY|2|First, screws are poorest quality, which makes assembly a nightmare.  Heads immediately round no matter what type of screwdriver you use.  Save yourself a real pain and go to Home Depot or Lowe’s for equivalent size screws.  Second, if you make it past the screws then assembling the final tubes into the right-angle connectors forces you stretch the mesh to a point where it could rip because the mesh is extremely tight.  Third, if you make a mistake and have to disassemble, good luck.  The mesh is so tight you will rip it trying to separate the rods from the right angle connectors.<br /><br />Product arrived 1 day early.<br />If you can assemble, it’s a decent product.
B0011URFRE|5|I just love this car seat.  It is comfortable for my daughter, easy to install, and easy to strap her in.  No complaints here.
B000YP34LS|5|This style of nursing cover with the structured band so you can see the baby is wonderful, especially in the early days of nursing when your baby might need more help/maintenance during sessions. The one thing I would caution is that if you don't have nursing-specific tops, this cover doesn't cover your sides/back like an all-around cover, so you might want to wear a belly band or something so you are not exposed when you lift your shirt. That said, I love the pattern of this particular cover!
B00LYCR718|5|So soft, loved it!
B0077F9WAA|5|loved them very nice and cute
B001JHSTS8|2|I hated this product. I sent it back the next day. I don't really know what I expected, but it didn't fit properly, and it wound up making my problem worse... Lucky after a couple days everything went back to normal. But, i was definitely disappointed.
B000056W79|5|i have found that the suction bowls not only help you to teach your baby how to feed themselves, but it also helps you to keep your table area clean. The bowl cover offers a way to fix your childs meals in bulk and store them in a way that is safe and easy to put away. All you have to do later on is heat food to right temperature and stick it down. This bowl is also goos for mothers just learning how to juggle feeding a first child it's first few meals.
B0027IS3XY|5|I bought this because I wanted a sturdy bassinet that wasn't white and frilly.  My husband assembled it mostly by himself while I supervised 9 months pregnant from the recliner.  It seems really stable, the storage on the end and baskets are really handy and the \\"Moses basket\\" feature is an added benefit that we really enjoy.  Overall I would buy again!    I did purchase the pad cover and fitted sheets, the crib does come with a sheet so it wasn't absolutely necessary, but they are nice to have.
B005UBCJ9E|5|My daughter's first carseat was the britax chaperone in the same cowmooflauge print, but once she hit 15 months, it was time to look for a bigger carseat.<br /><br />Since I loved the print so much, and received a ton of compliments on it the first time around, I picked it again. While it's the same print, the material is softer and more plush than the chaperone. My daughter loves her big girl seat, although she'd prefer it if we put it forward facing, something that's not going to happen until her little legs literally can't fit anymore.<br /><br />The only downside is the installation. My husband hopped on youtube to figure it out, and got it straightened out, but it's definitely not as easy to move as the chaperone.
B000XPWXK2|5|These bibs are great for starting solids. They keep baby clean (generally speaking) and also rinse off easily and can be washed in the machine. Very happy with purchase!
B001KM9C74|5|Best for little hands. My daughter loves them more than any other ones that we tried. At first the smell it's a little strong but after a few days it gets better. I totally recommend them.
B001C6QM9Y|5|The first time i bought these bottles, feeding became a nightmare project. Like many reviewers here, i had to deal with leaky bottles that just wouldn't stop leaking no matter what i tried. i looked online for all kinds of tricks to fix the problem, and tried them all to no avail. But i just couldn't help but notice how reviews for this product were always excellent or horrible. I kept reading that some people never experienced leakage with this item. So i figured i'd give the bottles another chance by returning my leaky ones and exchanging it for new ones. And voila! no leaking at all! i've been using them for several months now and love them for all the reasons they've been cited as excellent.     i'd recommend these bottles only if you're willing to invest time in buying and returning till you end up with the right one. i'm guessing that some were manufactured without the defect. once you've got one that doesnt leak, you'll appreciate its high quality. i've tried many many other bottles, and this one trumps them all by far.
B002A9IZ0Q|5|This is a great crib...especially for the price. It is pretty easy to assemble. It is beautiful and well constructed!
B00389VFH2|4|So glad our daughter is no longer needing these.  It does hold a ton of diapers.  Never ripped or tore.  Holds a knot well.  Contains odors very well.  Only real con is the high price for some glorified garbage bags.  Also. If your kids outgrow the diaper genie and you have a cat, it is essentially a litter genie.
B0010TSK2K|5|I bought this bed for my 2 1/2 year old son once we were ready to transition him into a toddler bed. Like most moms, I was very worried about him falling out of a toddler bed. I picked this bed due to the high back rail feature, which I actually flipped around so that it would appear most like his crib. The shorter rail is pushed against wall and he has yet to fall out of bed or attempt to climb out of bed.
B000RI8Y30|3|We use this every day when we run the dishwasher but I wish it was bigger. Also noticed that if you fill the bottom of the basket completely like is shown in the picture that the nipples don't get washed properly. Great idea but would be better if you could actually use the whole thing when filled.....
B0006FHFYS|5|My baby girl loves this swing!  She loves the music and the mobile, when she is fussy she will quiet right down when we put her in it.  Also, she does not like sleeping flat on her back, so this is a lifesaver because it props her up just enough so she ( and we )can get some sleep!
B006BJB2PQ|4|I have 3 week old twins, they are long and skinny. I purchased an assortment of cloth diapers prior to their arrival in this world. Happy Heiney's, Thirsties, Cutie Bunz, Dropsy, Grovia, Econobum, and G Diapers. Perfect Bum, perhaps because they come in 3 sizes, fit perfectly! No leaks, no mess and so cute! I wish they came in more designs and colors.<br /><br />Update: It's a good thing that these come in 3 sizes so you have to keep buying them. If they were one size, they would fall apart. I still like them, and they are absolutely awesome for newborns. But the velcro on them got icky pretty fast. So I am taking away one star.<br />Aside from the velcro issue, these are still fabulous fitting diapers! My twins are 8 months old now so all cloth diapers out there fit fine, but I still highly recommend these in the first few months of life, when other one size fits all diapers will be HUGE on your little one.
B001F6L7ZA|5|This tile set is great for some extra padding on your floor or carpet. It's about 9 square feet and the numbers pop out which is great if your child likes to eat everything in sight. I would definitely purchase this again for the money.
B00U1QCMA4|4|very soft. Only drawback is when wet, they can become cold.
B003KEMMNG|5|Very pleased. Works as it should. No sliding, no toddler falling out! Looks way better than the bed rails. Can cover up when the bed is made.
B00BVGC8ES|5|I love this cereal on the go especially when traveling with a toddler.  Minus the fact that the middle rubber part gives some issue, it really is just for show.  I love this product.
B002J4U8M0|4|A very cute toy that my daughter loves and is engaging more and more with every day
B000N0SNHY|4|Liked these better than munchkins.
B00198PQHY|5|Works good, exactly the same as in the picture...<br /><br />There is nothing to write more its just nice thing kid likes it...
B00E8KJYNC|5|This machine is a life saver!  I love that I can select the Oz of formula to make and just press a button and BAM, perfect bottle.  My husband loves it too.<br /><br />Make sure to follow ALL instructions and make sure you are cleaning the parts that require cleaning DAILY (I do mine twice a day).  If you don't follow the cleaning guidelines your bottles won't be right.
B004GHY144|5|I just bought the Peg Perego Aria Twin 60/40 and I am very pleased about the purchase. I read all the reviews on Amazon, Babies R Us and many other web sites and I would like to respond to the commonalities between those reviews.<br /><br />EASE OF CLEANUP - This item is not on any review that I read (or at least remember) and it is very important to me. Of all the strollers we've owned (and believe me, it has been many), this one is definitely the easiest to remove the seats for washing which is A DEFINITE PLUS!<br />HARNESS - the 5 point harness is NOT meant to keep the child against the seat, it is there to keep the child from slipping a simple lap belt. Adjusted properly, the child will remain safely within the stroller.<br />SUN VISOR - The most voiced concern was the sun visor, it has obviously been redesigned. The sun visor comes within 2 inches of the trays, unless you want to cover their knees this is obviously adequate.<br />BOTTOM BASKET (storage) - it goes all the way across the stroller and is very roomy -- easily as roomy as any other stroller.<br />TIPPING - I put several different combinations of kids, from 6 months to 4 years old; went up hill and down hill on bumpy terrain (this is not an all terrain stroller) and had no problems with tipping.<br />CUP HOLDER - This will nicely hold a 20 ounce drink, a normal water bottle or a normal coffee travel mug. If you need more than that, I think you will need to get a specialty holder no matter what stroller you get.<br />MANUVERABILITY - This stroller turns with no effort at all, no problems.<br />WIDTH - at 31 inches wide, it easily fits through most commercial doors. If you need narrower, you may need to consider a tandem stroller.<br />EASE OF ASSEMBLY - the only items you have to \\"Assemble\\" is to put on the cup holder and the trays, then you are on your way.<br />SQUEAKY WHEELS - none here, I do have another PegPerego P3 that got squeaky wheels after about 3 years, but a little silicon and no more sqeak.<br />TRAYS - although narrow, they will hold a cracker or a teething cookie. Since I am not a fan of on the go snacks, this is not a problem for me. One down side, no specific place for a water bottle for the kids, but you can just put those beside them (which is where the kids put the water bottles anyway)<br /><br />All in all, I would definitely recommend this stroller (2012 and later)
B001LONH7C|5|The other positive reviews are absolutely right; this set is a steal, and even more adorable in person!  The stitched designs and embellishments are gorgeous, and all of the coordinating pieces create an instant nursery theme that looks magazine-perfect, even if you have no design skills!  We didn't much care that it wasn't 100% cotton; I think that it feels great to the touch, and am pretty sure our newborn won't object.  We have had a blast creating a frog-themed nursery around this bedding set; hope you do too!
B006AXSBQQ|5|Works perfectly with my pump.
B001D1E1DM|4|the color is a bit lighter than i'd like it to be :/
B0090IBQSI|5|These are great now that my little one is starting to teeth.  She doesn't like the original one we purchased for her as it must be too soft for her.  These are thicker and seem a little more firm than the green (0-3 month).  We put a little water in the nipple part and freeze then hold it for her so she can &#34;gum&#34; it while frozen to ease the discomfort of her teething.
B008KCR7VK|5|A good product it was easy to install in my car.
B008CGY7DA|1|This is a worthless product, don't waste your money. I think they are no longer making it anyway but can only imagine that all of their products are similar quailty. I will never by this line again. Monitor didn't last a year and that was with very rare use because our daughter was in our room in a bassinette for the first 6 months of her life. Initially it was just that it would loose signal and shut off without any warning leaving us without being able to hear our daughter (and that is from across the hallway, not a long distance). Now the screen is shot. It has never been dropped or even carried around the house. We only use it at night so it has been in the ideal situation and it still broke.
B004WQAI2I|5|I love this little blanket... I can't help but touch it every time I pass it... It's soft and comforting.
B007Q4FWRY|2|Not awesome, but they work. We have a standard crib mattress and they are realllllly tight on it. Very thin also.  To update this review: after a few washes, these sheets no longer fit the mattress. I have stretched one out completely and now it's no longer a fitted sheet. I wouldn't buy them again.
B005RVCGTA|5|Huge hit with our baby. Very easy for him to hold.
B007F9YPBO|5|This is the second chair we bought. The first chair we used for 5 years during which we had 3 babies. On baby number 4 we decided to buy the newer version as the old one got used up. We still love this chair, the design and everything about it.
B007CTPWYQ|5|We love this stroller! We lived in NYC where a lot of moms had the Uppa Baby or City Select or one of the other pricier versions of this stroller and we just couldn't justify spending that kind of money on a stroller when this one does the exact same things.<br /><br />We wanted a stroller that:<br />-had an adjustable handle bar as I am 6'5&#34; and my wife is 5'5&#34;. This does the job great. I don't kick the undercarriage while walking and I don't have to bend over while pushing it.<br />-converted into a double stroller<br />-had 4 wheels. My wife had used a phil & teds when taking some friends kids around that had the two wheels in the back and one wheel up front and she hated it. When going up curbs etc. it's hard to balance on one wheel and she found that really annoying. 4 wheels are just more stable.<br />-handles with ease. This thing turns and spins and maneuvers so nicely.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Folds up easy and fast (did take us a few tries to really get the hand of it, but that was no biggie) We've even mastered taking it and opening it out of the trunk with one hand, but you do need two hands to fold it back up and stow away.<br />-We also bought the carseat that matches this and just clips right in. BEST. PURCHASE. EVER.<br />-tons of undercarriage storage space<br />-goes over bumps smoothly. This is a great ride.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-would be nice if the sunshade came down lower. I often have to drape a blanket over the seat, hanging from the sunshade to block the sun out of my daughters face. I'm sure there are add ons you could buy to fix this, but I think it should be included in a nice stroller like this one.<br /><br />We've had this for six months so far and have had no issues with it. Great for travel too. We've flown multiple times with it. Really well made and we look forward to using it for many years to come!<br /><br />Tip- keep an eye on random sales/discounts. We bought ours when Amazon was doing a special deal on it and used ourregistry discount at the same time and paid $250 for it. Great deal if you ask me!
B002JH7NXO|1|This is just one piece of flimsy foam.  The center is supposed to form suction around your child's head, but I couldn't even get it to sit properly on my one year old's normal-sized noggin.  I will continue to give it a few tries but since he already hates getting his hair washed, it's a struggle to even attempt to put this on, let alone properly.
B00PK3ERYW|5|I wish every baby was sent home from the hospital with one of these.  I got this for my 2nd and,man, I wish I had it for my first.  I was able to put this together in about 10 minutes, including bluetooth app, and it was up and running.  It's really cute and futuristic looking.  My baby really loved this.  Loved it and kicked her feet and laughed.  So i was worried it would be an expensive toy.  However, after experimenting with different motions and sounds, I was able to find some motions that calmed her down and put her to sleep.<br />The different motions are car ride, kangaroo, swing, rock, and wave.  Wave seems to be best for my little one.  The rain sound was also very soothing, but we often use the bluetooth and play white noise from my phone.  I am sad that she is getting too big for this.  The weight limit is 25 lbs, but I wish they had one you could use through 18 months when it's really hard to get them to sleep!<br />The mobile seems a bit pointless to me,  the balls don't really stay in it, but that's a minor issue.  Love this chair!  Naps are longer and my arms are free!
B00B1M2NSI|5|Exactly the thing I needed for my toddler. If you think you might need this for a kid transitioning from a crib to a bed, you are right!<br /><br />I was worried about my kid tripping over it since it looks kinda baggy. She has literally not tripped once in 3 months. Either go her or go HALO, either way I'm happy.
B006WE40UE|5|These are actually really nice. They are very thin material but I still expect to be able to use them for quite a while. I'm a little amazed that some people said the bib pocket is sewn on the wrong side. You have to flip it over. There are instructions on the package. They're sewn that way on purpose because the seam will force the pocket to stay open and not sit flush. It's a pretty smart way to make sure food ends up where it belongs..... In the pocket.
B00CGF1WPO|4|Baby loves it, but I wish it were a bit bigger.
B00IX6A7JM|5|My Grandson loved it.
B007FP1E3A|5|Such a cool night light! Kids love it.  The change of colors is really nice. Kids can play with it changing colors when they want, and it's not too bright, so kids can fall asleep, but it's not too dull either.
B0001NE8OA|1|I registered for, and received the diaper genie at my baby shower.  The diaper genie works for the first month or two at keeping the room odorless.  Once my son was two months old, his room, where the genie was located, began to smell!!!!  I thought I was loading the liners wrong...I wasn't!  Bottom line is it doesn't work!  My sister-in-law got the diaper champ and has not had any problems.
B001AE0WU8|4|Purchased for my 12mo son - glad I got these instead of real wooden blocks at the time.  He loved playing with these, but would also throw them everywhere (including at other kids), so it worked out as these are sort of foam/soft blocks.  Only downside is that colorful pictures eventually start peeling off some of the pieces (the cars, people, etc), especially when my son started chewing on them at about 15mos.  Overall was a good purchase though; I don't regret buying these.
B00D3TPGB8|5|My nephew and his parents love this. It was the only one we found that did not scratch the baby's skin and that still held up really well. It catches tons of stuff. It's cute and sturdy and very useful and well made. Highly recommend.
B002YQNKAU|5|Once the little one started moving around (crawling, pulling up) we saw an increase in falls and bumps. This was the perfect purchase to put in his play area to make sure he didn't hurt himself! For him, the colors are great to look at and the material is soft to sit on....and chew! Perfect purchase for us!
B005C9ODUW|2|This was a return for me. I wanted to like it but it didn't work with my ErgoBaby. The material is cozy and the hood was nice. It  secured to the straps fine but the bottom was not working out. There is no way to secure the bottom to the carrier so it just hangs there and all the cold air is getting to the baby. It might work for an older child but was a miss for me and my infant.
B007QV5PIS|5|So soft and cuddly. Baby will love this...
B008PL34KY|1|As mentioned in the earlier review, this is not compatible with the Avent Natural bottles, despite what the description states. If you need sealing discs, look for the pink and white Avent packaging. I also had horrible customer service from Mom and Baby shop - 3 weeks after submitting a return request I have yet to get a straight answer from the company and have had to get Amazon involved.
B002J4U8M0|5|My son adores this mirror. We put it in his crib when he was not rolling over so he could see himself, and then once he has become mobile, he just adores it even more!! He can now stand in the crib (with a lowered mattress) and reach the mirror. He loves the little red flower with the spinning ball. He just spins and spins it and laughs away!! Great product of for the money!
B001OC62UK|4|The mirror itself works great, turns on with the remote from the front seat with no problems.  The only drawback is that there are two volume settings, \\"loud\\" and \\"ear splitting\\".  Can get a little irritating when you have a longer than 10 minute drive with the same 4 tunes playing at top volume.  But my son does love looking in the mirror and listening to the music, so I can't complain too much!  All in all a good product.
B00ACA1UR0|5|My son loves these, and they have a set to match! They are really cute.
B00C9E92KE|4|Really cute and soft ! Made very well
B00F2MQDU2|5|3 month old grandson enjoys kicking and hearing the music.  Also loves looking at himself in the mirror.  The hanging toys are perfect for him to reach and grab. Only issue: he kicks himself off the piano and we have to pull him back to it - but he loves it.
B001GQ2RWQ|4|Love it! My daughter is so tiny and this fits her perfectly. Easy to install, easy to use, perfect for our chair. Now she can eat with us at the dining table!
B000BONWXW|5|Love love love!
B002SZH45E|5|I bought two of these for twin baby boys I used to nanny for.  I chose this over the Nose Frida because I didn't like the idea of having to buy filters.  It worked great, and their mother loved these.  The trick to get out all the boogers is to spray inside the baby's nostrils with a saline solution first.  You can make this with some salt and distilled water and put it in a small spray bottle.  After you spray this, the boogers will come loose, and you'll be able to suck out just about everything that's inside the nose.  They may hate you at first, but they'll love being able to breathe afterward.<br /><br />This is now one of my go-to gifts for baby shower baskets.  Everyone loves these!
B00BNUVKSW|5|Fantastic chair!!
B001I463GM|5|well built and very, very roomy for our growing granddaughter.
B005Z0GJXM|5|The stroller is very light, handles well with one hand and is easy to collapse when storing.
B00GNK24GO|5|just as pictured. Daughter loves it in her bathroom.
B000MUR8SA|5|Perfect gate for a wide opening.  Mounts quickly on wall with included pieces and adjusts in seconds.  The gate is solid and stable and it opens easily.  It is also safe- it does not seem likely that my toddlers will figure out a way to catch their fingers in the gate mechanism.
B002KQRZ8W|4|I wanted another nursing cover - one in which you put your arm thru an arm hole, as it was recommended by my friend. But it wasnt available so i bought this one. This is a great nursing cover. It is good quality material, light, with an adjustable strap and a very pretty print and color (pink).  It's so handy to have this in my handbag.   I used this once when i was travelling (out of necessity) as a light blanket for my sleeping baby, as a clean cloth to lie the baby on, etc. very versatile usage and very good value for money . I got it for fifteen dollars on amazon with free shipping.
B00H8MRDXA|5|Good
B001TWI81G|4|I like these ice mats alot. Easy to freeze, very flexible, reusable and easy to clean. Make sure you get a few of these if you plan to keep things very cool as the 9 ice cube mats I got aren't that large in size.
B001D7JO1U|1|Rolls up around my 10lb newborns head and neck in front and back. Loud Velcro wakes baby at changing times. Very disappointed.
B0013K1NXE|2|I've had this product several times over the years. This last one was a huge dissapointment. The first one ripped after the first use and I exchanged it out. The second the snaps near the handle are rusted. I've been a nanny for many years and have always recommended the product and now use it with my own family. The quality seems to have gone down.
B000TVVEQE|5|This was a great one for my baby.  I got a larger size, so he had lots of space to move his feet.    Alex's mom
B000FL5090|5|As advertised.
B00P7BGN62|3|Good/Ok for the price. Cute, kind of stay on baby's feet. Warm, but the lining sheds a little.
B00G6EEC76|5|These bags are of great quality and my 9 year old daughter loves opening them up in the lunch room. Very cute and saves a lot in plastic bag waste.
B00BQYVQWU|4|Great system- works fine- I just wish the night time feature was a bit more clear- it isn't  as easy to see with the night vision as they make it seem. Other than that it works great!
B0009RG8R8|4|I like this but what a pain to put up.  It felt a bit like Rocket Science! Still worth it.  My dad and I used the templates to hang the wall hinges...about 6 times!!  It's almost better to eye ball it.  I bought it for an 85&#34; open area in an attempt to block off the kitchen for my 1 year old.  I actually only needed 2 panels.  3 panels was way to long.  Either we lost or never received one of the wall hinges.  However, we called customer service and they sent us out a replacement part at no cost and I didn't wait on hold for forever...oh and I got to speak to some one in America.  I was so thrilled.  We did have to set our slightly higher than floor level otherwise we would have to remove the wall trim so keep that in mind.
B009MWF0XE|5|These are diapers are very soft. They are absorbent, but you have to wash them a few times to break them in before they will be absorbent. I don't stuff them. I just place the insert between diaper and baby and they still work great and I only have to change the inserts. I have tried a few different brands and find these to be the best.
B007FP1E3A|2|I needed a nightlight that didn't rotate colors, or at least had an option for a single color at a time.  This seemed perfect and I was eager to try it out, but was defective right out of the box.  I tried it in a dark room and it was blinking green (as if the light sensor was getting a little light but it was pitch black).  When I hit the button it sometimes changed to blue, then flashed green, then got stuck at blue.  Red was a no-go.  I sent it back and will try ordering again.  I'll update if we get one that actually works.
B000JOT2RO|5|Awesome and they stay put!
B00CXTWJAA|4|The system is really cool. Unfortunately, my baby couldn't use these nipples, and the ones that he likes don't fit. The bags do fit on my Medela pump in style advanced with the included adapter.
B0000DF17V|5|I love these 3 blankets. they are definitely worth the money.   They wash and dry very well also with hot water...which is useful for newborns spitting etc.      only bad thing...i ordered 2 packages each contained not 3 different once as shown. each contained 3 blankets but 2 where always the same.
B0038JDAJ8|5|Good products worthy of trust
B002MXLS0O|2|This device is made up of two wrist bands (one large, one small) connected by retractable cord. As an \\"apparent\\" child restraint, the Kinderkord looks great but has a few glitches that need to be worked out, the most important that your child can easily take it off in seconds.     Pros:  * Lightweight and very small.   * Cool and modern looking.   * Fully adjustable parent wristband fits men or women.   * The tension cord retracts automatically when not in use.   * It's comfortable to use, even in hot weather.   * If you have several kids, you can attach more than one child KinderKord to the parent's KinderKord.     Cons:   * If your child can undo velcro, they can take off their wristband easily (less than 10 seconds on our first outing)   * The stainless steel blunt-ended hooks are hard for an adult to hook and unhook. My toddler showed me how to do it in 5 seconds flat (?!)   * The hooks do not retract fully into the unit.   * The very thin nylon cord (1/16 inch thick) has started fraying and showing signs of wear after just three outings. One can't help but wonder if it will stand up to a toddler pulling with all his weight - mine hasn't tried yet but only because I no longer use it, it's too unsafe.    * Last but not least - the fine print \\"use at your sole risk\\"     Parents, please be advised of extensive disclaimers on the manufacturer's website - the fine print is probably the longest I've seen on any child's product. In their terms and conditions KinderKord \\"makes no representations of any kind, express or implied, as to their information, content, materials, or products (on their site)... To the fullest extent permissible by applicable law, (the site) disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchant liability and fitness for a particular purpose.. KinderKord will not be liable for any damages of any kind arising from the use of (its) site or the information, content, materials, or products includedon this site, including, but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, and consequential damages...\\"     To see so many disclaimers on a new \\"as-seen-on-TV\\" product makes one uneasy. If you decide to get it, use with parental supervision at all times - you can't always tell if your child has taken it off because you won't feel a slack or a tug on it.     On my end, I'm sticking with the tried and true [[ASIN:B001OB9LBI Eddie Bauer Harness Buddy - Monkey]] which I found to be far more reliable and that my child can't undo. It's cute and my son gets nothing but compliments on it which makes him happy to wear it.
B00155UGTO|3|We love our Baby Jogger stroller and have had good customer support for a broken swivel on the front wheel. This however does not really function as well as I would like. I understand it is adjustable for all the different models of seats out there, but the fit when adjusted properly is not confidence inspiring, I have just gotten used to bending over every time we place the seat in this holder to make sure it's in straight (which it never is). Then I readjust. We are almost out of this phase of car seat so it won;t be an issue much longer. I just think there should be a better design. We used ours with a Graco seat.
B001T7TN2E|3|It is an awesome chew toy. Our daughter thinks it's awesome, and she chew and drools all over it several times a day. However, the squeaker is BAD. It is SOOOOOO loud. I've tried to \\"deactivate\\" it several times with scissors, but no luck. I may plop it in the dishwasher if I can't stop it. It would get 5 stars if it wasn't for the loud squeaking.
B00L4HJESC|3|First off I would say that even though the product is marketed as a crib mattress pad it is WAY too cushy for an infant. This product should be used for a toddler bed only!  That being said it makes a firm crib mattress into a soft, comfortable toddler mattress for my little guy.<br /><br />My only complaint is the elastic is quite weak and the sides too shallow for a standard crib/toddler mattress. The product is only being held in place by the fitted sheet I put over it.  It's annoying but for the price I decided to keep it because I like the level of comfort it adds to my toddler's bed.
B00124CE16|4|We are traveling to visit family, and it will cost us $25 each way to check in the portable crib through the airlines.  I decided to either buy a brand new one or ship to our family.  Buying a brand-new port-a-crib is less expensive than bringing our current one on the airplane!  It's a little wobbly, and my son likes to shake it back and forth, but it does the trick and is an over-all good product.  We have one at home, and we use it when we have overnight trips.
B002ZB82CU|4|Been using this monitor now for around 8months. I love it. It gives me piece of mind to know the little one is breathing and sleeping soundly. (then I can sleep too) I like that we are able to see the temperature of her room and that it alerts us if it's too warm/cold. Also the little swinging pendulum on the screen indicates movement so it's very nice to be able to see that everything is fine with her.<br />At first she was in a pack and play in our bedroom, we never had any false alarms(accept when I picked her up in the middle of the night and forgot to turn it off.:-)<br />Since she was seven months old we moved her to her own bedroom and a full sized crib. We have now had a few false alarms, it seems to happen when she moves to the very edges of the crib. We will move the pads around a bit more to try and cover more area and then see. Still very satisfied with it. Would buy it again.<br />Having a video monitor would probably be nice, but I just go in and peek to see her, so it doesn't bother me not to have video. (we are in a single storey home, think if I had to go up and down stairs to look in on her, then I would have preferred one with video.
B003VRUB6W|1|DO NOT BUY THIS SEAT!    My wife bought this for out 3 yr old son - who has CP - and yes - he has accidents every now and again. The last week of MAY 2011 - my wife bought this seat and we used it in her car foe 2 weeks - then moved it to mine for a vacation at Sarasota, FL on 12 JUNE 2011 - he had an accident in the seat and I started looking at how to disassemble it to clean the fabric seat covers. Well - the only one you can clean is the bottom one. You have to use the clips on the very bottom after removing the tray - you have to turn them and really pull them out - then you can remove the shoulder belts. Well - the only ones I saw were the two clips together and I pulled them through the top of the seat - which you ARE NOT to do. Anyway - I can't get the seat assembled correctly.     Now my wife bought this at Toys R US (Hassle Free returns????) - After calling Toys R US customer service - and talking with TJ - he said the store \\"might or might not\\" - accept the seat for A RETURN even though we are within our 90 Day return policy...and to top it off the the shoulder adjustment rail will not stay in place and falls back down after adjusting it up....it just falls down.     So - if you kid throws up or has an accident - make sure child understands that he/she has to do it in the bottom cushion - because the other cushions DO NOT come out - they are in there...this seat may have won some 2010 Award for safety -- it is NOT PRACTICAL for little kids and keeping the cushions clean...    I contacted the people who make RUMI Air Safety First in Columbus, IN (800-544-1108) - and they stated it takes 5-10 days for a replacement - but I'm returning this SEAT and getting a refund - then I'm contacting ADA and making sure they know that kids with special needs NOT TO BUY THIS SEAT.     So - it's 9:30 in Sarasota and I'm waiting for Toys R US to open and hopefully they will replace and I can get the seat (a clean one) back to Indiana to return to Columbus, Indiana!    We have had an issue before with Toys R US - and I refuse to buy anything from them - but my wife wanted to keep our son safe and even though I was skeptical about buying anything from TOYS R US - she did and now we are in a dilemma out of town on a vacation trip....with the possibility of going to  Wal-Mart and buying a seat - and packing this one back to Columbus, IN -just so I can get my child back safely home. We had bought a stroller from Toys R US and purchased some type of buyers protection from them....I had to track down a and argue with their service personnel to actually mail them a hard copy of they receipts in order to get a refund - because they said they were only getting half of my fax when I faxed the paperwork in...HASSLE FREE - whatever...    Again - if your kids is perfectly clean and never has any spills, accidents, gets car sick - then buy the seat - but if not -- forget about cleaning it...    I DO NOT recommend this seat at all....and as far as Rumi Air Safety First - we are the first family to call in about issues with this seat - since it just came out on the market recently....sure they will refund your money - but what about if something happens while on vacation or out of town---what are you going to do??? Put your child in a dirty - stained- smelly seat for the seat.    Joe White
B001OW6JYY|5|Purchased two for my twins . They are wonderful, and sturdy. They look nice . The price was cheap but the quality is not . I would recommend this bed to anyone . There was a lot of reviews saying how hard it is to put together, they really are not, just need to follow the directions and a second hand is helpful , took about a hour each , you need both types of screw drivers , a flat head or butter knife to hold the nut piece straight while using the Allen key to put the screw in .
B007ETJQCI|1|I got this for a birthday present for my daughter... she played with it for a few minutes... I went to check it out and it was broke. I tried new batteries and nothing. She didnt drop/throw or anything.<br />I am not happy
B00MN22H36|5|very usefull accesory for the stroller
B006PB2B6O|5|Perfect for my car.  Needed a car seat for my grandson so I didn't have to keep borrowing my daughter's when I take care of him.  Seems sturdy, and very secure when belted in. I do Recommend this.
B003XDB91U|5|Love these! They are perfect and we'll made and a good price compared to some others I looked at. I wish they were slicker material so liquids wouldn't go through but they are great for foods and do help keep liquids off too. I am actually not sure if the liquid doesn't drip down his chest.  it isn't really adjustable around the neck and he is only 8 months so there is a lot of space there for now.
B000O7SR8Q|5|This is a perfect portable crib sheet. Super soft and just the right size. I recently bought the Kolcraft portacrib mattress, this fit perfect and was exactly what I was looking for!
B00EV1FHYS|2|I bought this on april for my baby's room (born June 19) and the mobile has nearly 3 weeks that the music works for some moments.. I want my money back or to exchange it.. Did not see the option to contact seller or file a claim so I hope to hear from you soon...
B002TUTP1O|5|This Playard/Bassinet is Adorable! It is alittle smaller than most Graco Playards, but still gives plenty of room for Baby. Perfect for smaller spaces, or if you will be packing it along often!<br />The Ruffles make it so precious and more like a little bed, instead of a traditional playard/bassinet. The Canopy is cute and convenient to dim any light over Baby for better sleep. I used the Bassinet for several months next to my bed. I then began using the actual Playard. Both aspects of this product were put to great use, and held up nicely. I traveled a few times with it, and it always did the job, yet was less to lug around than the traditional size playards by Graco. Many people commented on how truly adorable the ruffles are, they do add that something extra!<br />All in all, it is smaller, but still a Great Product with the same type of construction as Traditional Graco Pack and Plays. And I will say Again, it is Adorable!<br />I own the entire Ally Collection, and I am very pleased with each and every piece. They are durable, easy to clean, and stay looking neat between washes. None of my items show signs of wear and tear, despite not the most gentle care.<br />I would recommend any and all of this perticular collection, as well as the brand.
B00HNRPRUG|3|These very rarely leak, the velcro is awesome, and I appreciate how easy they are to use (no matching up inserts, etc.). My only problem is how ridiculously bulky they are, even without the additional, optional insert. My son is long-waisted already, and with these on almost all of the inseams of his clothes are too short. As a result, he really only wears them at night, but they seem to work for that purpose.
B00OTXUNYW|5|Can I just say here how I really feel about Click Tight?<br /><br />LIFE CHANGING.<br /><br />No more wrestling, straining, sweat dripping off nose awfulness with the @#$%^& car seat.<br /><br />The steps to install are this (not meant to replace Owner's Manual, meant to describe how simple it is now):<br />Sit seat in position<br />Lift Click Tight panel<br />Pull seatbelt the whole way out, route across belt path<br />Pull snug (not tight, just pull out slack and be sure belt is flat)<br />Lower Click Tight panel and push down until it clicks.<br />Clip on and pull slack out of tether<br />Shake seat to test install<br />Done<br /><br />^^^ All of the above can, seriously, be done in 60 seconds.  And I took this seat around with me doing test drives while car shopping.  I can tell you for a certain fact it installs well in a 2015 RAV4, 2015 CRV, 2015 Forrester, and 2012 Fiat 500.  All of them simple and easy, tight install the first time, every time.<br /><br />My kid says the seat is comfortable, and she loves the cupholders.  She is 50&#34; tall, 54 lbs, and still fits in the 5 point.<br /><br />Side note: My daughter picked out the color on this seat after we had to replace our previous (older model, out of production) Britax seat because of an accident.  The accident totaled my full sized truck (the reason I was car shopping with this seat in tow), but my kid was ok.  Britax makes a quality product.
B00WXLDSYY|5|My kids play with Legos on a plush shag rug and now I don't have to crawl around picking out all the pieces.<br />Cinches up easily and the material is good and strong. I should've gotten one of these years ago!
B00B7ULJQQ|5|It does the job! You don't smell soiled diapers as long as it's closed. I love it
B002J4U8SO|3|I thought our daughter would love this but it doesnt seem to work very well on carpet. It has to be on hard floors to go.
B005JCPKVI|5|This system is incredible!  We didn't originally register for this system, but (luckily!) due to a private seller on amazon who turned out to be a scammer we had to order a different system last minute, and we decided within one hour of Internet research to spring for the more expensive Britax B Agile/B Safe system.  We had to pay extra for two-day shipping to make sure it would arrive before baby was born and thankfully it got here just in time!  The stroller was so easy to assemble that even though I was having pretty regular contractions I was still able to get it put together within 10 minutes.  My husband couldn't believe how simple it was to install the carseat base. The carseat snaps into the base and the stroller very easily and it's easy to tell if its correctly in place because you can hear two very distinct 'clicks.'  The carseat can also be taken off the base and the stroller with ease; when our baby is asleep we can get her into the base, off the base, onto the stroller or off the stroller without waking her.  The carseat is a bit heavy but it doesn't bother us.<br /><br />As we live in Montana and go hiking a lot, we kind of wish we had gone with the BOB stroller/Britax carseat, but considering that we needed a system ASAP and this one was cheaper we ended up with the B-Agile stroller.  We've gone on one hike on fairly uneven terrain and the stroller worked alright, not great. If you'll be hiking on even paths this stroller would be great.  The stroller does wonderfully on sidewalks and in stores, it literally feels like its gliding.  And I love that the system is all black, its very sleek and totally gender neutral for any future children we'll have.<br /><br />So in conclusion, I would say the key word with this system is 'easy.' Everything about how the system works and assembled is easy, and with a newborn, easy is necessary.  Definitely worth the money!  I'd you're hoping to go hiking, get the BOB stroller with the Britax carseat.
B0017GY3BS|3|These pads does it's purpose.  I also bought the Lansinoh brand which cost more but was thinner and did just as well but hides better in the bra because it's not bulky.
B007AALZB6|5|love the design, good quality, I've since decided to go with another theme but instead of returning or selling it I'm keeping it incase I want to change back to this theme as my daughter gets older
B001AXF5EC|5|good
B007NG5UEU|1|I purposely waited on reviewing this monitor until I had had it for while. I decided to purchase this set based on other reviewers who said they were able to get new sets once their monitors went bad. I figured I didn't have anything to lose and went for it. Just like other reviews say, one of our parent monitor's screen went bad at the 8 month mark. Instead of showing &#34;linked&#34; it only shows random dashes. I called customer service to see if I could get a new unit. Not only was the representative incredibly aggressive and rude, but their policy is such that the whole set would need to be returned, not just the defective unit. The kicker is that it would take 4-9 business days to receive the new set. I clearly said I was uncomfortable being without a monitor for that long because my daughter sleeps upstairs. I was willing to purchase a new set via Amazon Prime and wait to be reimbursed when they received the defective set - that idea was shot down. I then offered to send proof that the set was destroyed using a hammer - that idea was also shot down. I also asked to speak with someone else regarding this issue. All the representative kept saying is that it is their policy to receive the defective set before they can send a new one out. When I informed him that I would not be sending the set to them and that I would be writing this review, his response was &#34;ok&#34; and hung up on me.<br /><br />So, unless you are ok with only having this set for a short time, or being without a monitor for 4-9 business days, then stay away from this monitor set.
B004J34TDS|2|These Y cuts stretch out to become giant O cuts...
B00A4B34IA|5|Very good for babies, my daughter enjoys using the rocker, I highly recommend this rocket for babies
B005KL3LFU|5|We use this in the pack and play and by itself in the playroom. Very comfortable. We have already washed the cover in the washing machine without any issues. Perfect for colic or acid reflex infants.
B00440CZPU|2|In theory these are great baby food containers. They're compact, they stack nicely in the freezer and they're made of good quality, BPA free plastic. However, it's both incredibly difficult and often painful (from the pushing you end up doing) to get the lids off the little jars when they're full. The jars are too short and there's not a good way to grip them. Once the lids are off, the food does come out easily with the help of the push bottom. For easy use you'd need to not use the lids, which removes the compact stackability of the product.  I bought the [[ASIN:B002F9MUM0 green sprouts Silicone Freezer Tray, Green]] and had far greater success with it.  It was significantly easier to remove the baby food and a much easier product for the same purpose.
B00Q535BVO|5|Easy to assemble and nice quality! Larger than I thought.
B0045I6IAY|5|These are the best pacifiers.  We now have 6 of them, so I'm less stressed about when they fall on the floor, under the couch, etc... there's always a spare on hand.  Baby is so soothed by his soothies!
B0058K5IIQ|5|I bought this when my baby started to crowl. He is 2 now and still in a very good condition. It is colorful and love that they are two sided and we can rotate  them once in awhile.
B00005C6OI|5|My newborn had problems with throwing up and gas when we used the bottles with disposable liners.  I had bought one of these bottles to try and we noticed a big improvement. We are not having problems with throwing up and she has much less gas.  They do take a little more time to clean but it is worth it to have a happier baby.  We will stick with these!
B00946TOPI|5|You can't help but to love this diaper bag, at first I was like it kinda on the big side, but after I was done filling it up with my babies stuff, it was just the perfect size... I get lots of complements...& my little girl loves her hello kitty diaper bag !!!
B004GCJMKM|4|Relatively easy to install.  Magnet is strong and works easily through the thickness of the cabinet door.  When properly installed, keeps cabinet locked with no free play of the door which could allow little fingers to get pinched.  Installation notes did not make allowances for better cabinets and the thickness of the bumpers on the cabinet doors.  Took a little finessing to make adjustments, but once installed they work well.
B00PF2U5G2|5|Works well for the grand-kids. We can throw them on the window very easily.
B00O3GVSZI|5|Simply Love it
B00GHM87GY|4|It's a good car seat. It is especially good considering that I received it for free for a review and I was just in need of a convertible toddler car seat. But let's be frank here, I wouldn't have bought it myself, as it offers rather littler for its price.<br /><br />Plus, the seat's selling pitch here, on Amazon, is rather misleading.<br /><br />First, to make this seat rotating, you have to buy a separate swiveling base (another $200!). It works just fine without it however. In fact, installation part was very easy.<br /><br />Second, I can't really imagine anyone taking out this car seat on a regular basis and putting it into a stroller base. The seat is huge, made even bulkier by a box-like appendage in the back (to store a manual and a belt and nothing else).<br /><br />So, basically, what you get for $380.00 is a decent car seat with no frills - no cup holder even. It looks good, it must be safe, it is easily adjustable (I mean the straps, not the recline - that is stationary - another underwhelming surprise), it fit well into my Honda Civic. But is it worth it? A good Britax might be a better choice for most parents.
B00KKRE0Y0|5|What a great product for nursing moms! It can be used cold or warm to relieve nursing pain. Especially helped when I was in pain from engorgement and more convenient than taking a hot shower. I highly recommend it!
B0052QYLUM|1|I ended up getting rid of it because for one the sound wouldnt work #2 battery stopped charging after a week of use and again sound never worked and 3 and this one is my fault threw the box out so I couldnt return it. steer clear of this one its far and byond not worth it
B000A6OLM2|2|As soon as I received this blender, I knew this was too big for baby food. I am only blending a small amount of food at a time and this blender is for much larger portions. I will use my regular blender for larger portions. I needed a daily use baby blender for small amounts, so returned this and got the baby bullet. Amazon was excellent at returning this product.
B00HH0FVXC|5|I bought this for my 5 month old daughter. She absolutely loves this item. The different textures keep her occupied and when she gets bored with one area she just moves on to another.<br />It's able to be washed, which is wonderful. You only have to place it in a pillowcase and allow it to air dry.<br />I'm very pleased with this.
B00A65YN8E|4|This diaper sprayer does it's thing! I like the flow of water and the fact that it conveniently hangs on my toilet tank for easy access.
B00EVK5SBG|3|Good quality, easy to clean, but my baby turned out not to prefer them.
B003C1Q1ZW|5|my 12 year old daughter loves it. It is well constructed and larger than any other piggy bank she has had in the past.
B004TABP7E|5|Mostly used from month 2-4. Baby took off rolling after that. Now I use it vertical outside of a jumper as a &#34;friend&#34; and baby goes wild with joy at 7 months. I put it on the floor and she wiggles the face a bit, but doesn't play with it much. It was awesome for helping her get used to tummy time instead of crying on the floor
B00KX5VGDM|5|The Giraffe Design Premium Car Window Sun Shades by EZ-Bugz protects from harmful UV rays and sun glare while keeping the interior of the car cool and allowing for a more comfortable car ride. More importantly they are safe. Being so lightweight, I do not see them causing any harm if detached from the window during a crash.<br /><br />Besides the effectiveness and the safety, I love that when not in use the EZ-Bugz shades fold up and fit perfectly in the glove box or in the pouch behind the passenger seat. With its quick installation you can just press and go. While being the easy adjustability is great for the ever-changing sun, I found that the shades tend to slip down slightly after bumps. I think that if the suction cups clipped onto the shade instead of slid on that would alleviate this tiny drawback. Here is my solution: When installing, I place the suction cups as high as they can go on the shade, that way they have no room to slide.<br /><br />BTW- Their Customer service is AWESOME!
B004IZWQYQ|3|My son is almost 8 mths and doesn't really seem interested in dropping the balls down the twirly chute.  Having said that the balls themselves are very intriguing to him.  They are clear with little balls inside that rattle about.  He likes throwing them on the floor and crawling after them.  I think this toy may be more interesting to him when we is a little older.
B008Y2DG8O|1|Although the pillow is a good size and has air holes for coolness....unfortunately anyone who can look up what 'memory foam' is(it's polyurethane, or urethane), will read about all the damage that this material can do to a baby's nervous system, thyroid, brain, etc. I just received it and as soon as I took it out my throat was burning. We have two other foam pillows, which don't cause as much of a reaction in me, but after researching 'memory foam', I will toss them. You can also google 'memory foam+cancer'. The manufacturers should be ashamed of themselves.
B007D462KI|5|I am a new mom and new to breast feeding. I have had quite the struggles with getting started from cracked nipples to a yeast infection and leaking milk. After checking out the reviews on Bamboobies I decided to give them a try. They have been a huge help! The are soft and comfortable against my painful nipples. They are also extra absorbent. I feel comfortable wearing them around without fear of leaking through my shirt. I would recommend this product to others that plan on breast feeding.
B00C3M95T0|5|this bowl really does work. my grandson loves it
B000IDSLOG|5|6 month old grand daughter loves to chew on it.<br />Helps for teething.<br />It is cute and right size for baby. Soft and easy for baby to handle.
B004I110D8|5|This is probably the best purchase I've made! Helps me warmup the bottles anywhere anytime! It's so convenient!
B003G2YURS|5|I am not one to usually write reviews, but feel inclined to share since this has been such a great product for us.  With my husband and I both being over 6 foot, we expected a big baby and initially purchased this rocker because of the 40lb weight limit.  We have been more than pleased!  We have been using this for our little one since week one, and at 4 months she is still in it everyday.  She likes it better than any other place (chair, swing, exersaucer, basket) because she can rock herself and watch everything that going on around her.  We put her in here when we eat dinner, or when I'm trying to get things done.  It moves easily from room to room, the cover slips off for washing, and the toy bar is easily removed when she's not playing with it.  We recommend it to a lot of our friends over a bouncer that their child will quickly grow out of.
B0092NM7P2|5|perfect
B0017I79X0|3|My baby will take just about any pacifier, except for this.  It's probalbly a matter of preference though.
B007SIZS36|3|I bought these bottles because I received a couple free and had coupons to buy more.<br />These bottles are getting the job done. I haven't had problems with the bottles breaking or getting discolored, however I solely hand wash the bottles and do not use a bottle warmer unlike other reviewers. My daughter took to these bottles with ease, and I've always liked the shape of the bottles. I grew tired of washing the little stir stick thing the bottles come with, so I have stopped using those. And to me, there didn't seem to be much of a benefit to them anyway.<br /><br />My only complaint, is often when mixing the formula, the bottles will leak from the bottom of the screw top (not through the air vent). It doesn't happen always, but happens enough the bother me, but not enough to try new bottles.<br />I'm not terribly picky, but I am pretty sure there are better bottles out there.
B00LCYTGKS|3|Love that they are see through and don't have a handle my son wants to pull on but you can't really clip it to anything and the actual mouth piece is huge. My son was really thrown off by how much of the binki was touching his face
B0017T2RYU|5|Purchased this from EZ something or other.  The shipping was very fast.  Anyway, I can hear my baby's breathing with this monitor.  And the volume isn't turned way up.  The nursery is approx 10' x 10'.  The transmitter is in a corner of the room diagonally opposite the crib where baby's head is. We have had it for 10.5 mths.  Now he turns on his side and I can't hear the regular breathing but deep breaths do come across.  There is no static.    We have a 2 story house so this works great.  Have unplugged one monitor and forgotten to plug it back in for 24 hrs and the battery does not drain.  Outside of the house, the range seems to be ~ 40ft or so.  No interference with TV or cell or other devices.  I have taken a receiver into the basement frequently and it works well there (while taking a shower).  Transmitter is on the 2nd floor.  Shower is on opposite side of the house ~ 26 ft away.  There is a voice activated mode so that if you have a fan or humidifier in the room, it filters out the background sound.  I wanted to hear everything so haven't used that mode much.  The regular mode did pick up a drip problem with a humidifier that wasn't seated correctly.  I love this monitor and it's one of the top baby products I've purchased if not the best.
B001I7PY1E|1|Like many others, this bath tub mat smells so strongly of chemicals.  My husband washed the mat and aired it out but it still smelled-- he said it smelled POISONOUS!  I'm currently pregnant and he wouldn't let me near the mat.  We're returning this item!
B003ZUXNRE|5|These snuggly car seat strap covers are adorable. They deffeniatly make my daughter's car seat more appealing looks & cozier & snug with these covers attached to the straps. They are exactly what I was looking for!
B00OD44S5C|5|So cute! My only complaint is that the pillow case is too big for a toddler pillow (which is the size of a travel pillow). I was not expecting the pillow case to be full size, but that's not enough to take a star away as I can always cut it down and re-sew it to fit. Very cute sheet set and my 22 month old loves it!
B004MW8X9M|2|Actual measurments: 28x32  I have had many problems with Bambino Land. They told me they would fix the problems that I have, but I have yet to see this happen and it has been over 4 months since I ordered. They also will not respond to my emails(they responded quickly and nicely to emails asking questions about their products but now that I have problems with their products that I ordered they wont answer emails or phone calls). When they finally wrote back they basically said \\"screw you\\". I was treated so rudely that I do not wish to support them by buying their products. I really regret ordering from them, it's been a total nightmare!  The other products I've ordered from them are much smaller than stated size, and some of them smelled very toxic like chemicals had been used on them. I did not feel safe using them with my children.  I do like this towel as a towel and blanket, but wish it was bigger as it says it is, and I dont trust the company so not even sure whether to believe its organic or not.
B00A0ID6YO|3|Item was larger than expected.
B00L63QFMM|5|Received prior to the ship date. As described
B002T68M30|1|I bought one of these to try- it worked great for about a week.  but taking it on and off wore out the loop and it broke.  currently looking for an alternative.... I will not buy these sleeves again.
B004L2JJ6E|4|Great for travel. Our baby was really comfortable after we elevated the head.
B000IDSLOG|5|He loves it so much.  My only complain with it is I could hardly get it away from him.  Now that he's outgrown it, it serves as his squeky toy and a giraffe which his soldiers could hunt. lol
B00BHH76ZW|4|Tried it out on the kids a few days ago and it was pretty sweet. Smelled great and left their skin feeling softer than before the bath (which I didn't think was even possible!) Love the fact that it's organic too. Definitely worth trying out.
B0006HBS1M|4|This pump is easy to use and assemble. Also easy to clean. I do wish it came with ready to use nipples to feed direct from the bottle.
B00GSNFG84|5|This is a great travel system at a great price. We did a lot of research, price comparisons, and testing at stores and chose this system.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Light stroller. Wanted something my wife would be able to put into the trunk of the car. This was the lightest of the travel systems we were considering.<br />- Easy to close and open. We went to test strollers at the local BBB and found this stroller was by far the easiest to open and close from storage. Hit the lock button on the side and lift the handle the and stroller folds up easily.<br />- Car seat. The car seat snaps in and out of the stroller easily, yet is sturdy. If you line up the connector on the car seat to the stroller, it will click right in. Taking the car seat off the stroller is also easy by holding down both buttons  and lifting the car seat off the stroller.<br />- Car seat base. We installed the car seat base in a 2007 BMW 328i on the passenger side using the latch connecters. I saw a few youtube videos on how to do it before attempting it on my own, and it was rather easy. Just make sure to expand the straps to their longest and put some weight on the base as you push the latch connectors in. Once you're latched in, just tighten down on the straps. The car seat should have minimal side to side motion, but will be flop up and down without the car seat (and baby) in place.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The rubber foam handle bars get dirty really quickly. We store our stroller in the garage, folded, and in this state, the stroller is sitting on the handle bar. After a few weeks use, the foam padding has some pock marks and is dirty, even though we wipe it down with a wet cloth before use.<br /><br />We waited until this travel system went on sale and was also able to use our 15% (Amazon Prime) completion discount, bringing this down to well below the $200 range. Awesome travel system for a great price.
B004JRO2PO|5|Bought as a gift to add to a baby present. Really sweet. Smaller size and really, really sweet little face on this toy.
B003N49ML8|1|I am highly disappointed by this cup! The straw was great, my daughter was loving it, and so was I... UNTIL SHE DROPPED IT! Just sitting in a high chair height, she dropped it (not threw it) and it hit the hardwood floor. It shattered!! Juice everywhere, plastic pieces everywhere, and a crying 10 month old. If I could give it 0 stars I would.
B003U86YRM|5|These are so soft just what baby needs!
B0058TVTX0|4|Is nice and washed well it looked the way is pictured and it didnt shrink when washed like other one i had bought in the past and is not a rough material .
B00CUEBGU2|5|excellent product, good price, I recommend
B000FI0HUU|5|So helpful to clean my son's nose quickly and painless
B005UV0UU4|5|This pack n play Is by far the<br />Most convenient with the organization section, bagpiper and changing tsblr
B000MEB3GE|5|I found this product to be extremely helpful.  Especially the feeding timer and which side you last fed. I carry it around everywhere its just as important to me as my cell phone.
B00EILOYE0|4|Good stuff
B004G8QN9E|5|I could not live without the Halo sleepsacks.  Fleece and cotton!  If we forget to put them on my daughter, she wakes up with icy feet!  Thank you Halo!
B0042MSXOC|5|Perfect concept. Love them
B00CMCSAXI|5|Well made and my daughter loves it!  I liked this better than the children's recliners I had considered. It arrived on time and was well packaged.
B00E8NGRN4|5|I had my baby girl, and she was in a bassinet for the 1st month, but although she was sleeping ok, every time either my husband or I moved or rolled in bed she would wake up, so I thought that will be better of she slept in her crib.<br />So I did and in fact she slept better but I didn't I would go every hour check I was breathing...<br />I was unable to get any rest till I get this monitor that finally gave me some peace!
B00BSKNV9S|5|I love our unicorn muslin blankets. So does our new son!  Now if they would only make one with a wonderful Celtic dragon print!!!
B00834D7DC|4|Our 14 month finally grew out of his baby car seat and we needed another car seat to fit the bill.  Based on other reviews, we decided on the Britax Marathon.  It seemed to have the combination of size, comfort and ease of installation that we were looking for.  As a very brief overview, the carseat gave our infant more than enough space, seemed to have very safe side bolsters to limit whiplash in the event of an accident and was not overly heavy.  The only reason we did not give it a 5 star review is due to the semi difficult installation.  We were able to latch it with no problem at all, but the tethering system was not the easiest process and caused us to question how we had it mounted.  After having it checked out and OK'd, we were good to go.  We would definitely recommend this product to other families.
B00P4TO4F4|5|Beautiful quality necklace and fast shipping. So far my toddler seems to not drool as much or gnaw on his fingers!!
B003I867US|5|I was little hesitant to get this product vs the Bjorn, but was pleasantly surprised.  It is perfect for carrying my grand-babies around face out, which they love.!  The only thing that could change is making the straps a little more padded for comfort on long walks, but other than that very easy to use, adjust and you just can't beat the price.  I got several to keep at kids house and mine rather than carry with me.  Satisfied customer here!  :)
B004J1QNFW|5|Very nice and well made. Comes with certificate and screw clasp easy to take on and off. Looks really cute on the baby and helps too! She is always so happy when it's on!
B000G0L2TM|5|My husband and I watched The Happiest Baby on the Block DVD before our son was born and we started swaddling him on day 1.  Every time he made a peep, we re-swaddled him.  We had a couple of Kiddopotamus velcro swaddlers but we found that he was able to get his arms up.  When I heard about this swaddle blanket I knew that he would never be able to get his arms up so we bought it.  We only used this at night and we used it until he was about 5 months old.  One night, we stopped swaddling cold turkey.  It was easy for me and my son to give up the swaddling but not so easy for my husband - he was convinced that swaddling was the only reason our son was sleeping at night.    My opinion: this swaddle blanket really does what it's supposed to!  No baby could ever wiggle out of it.  The downside is that the parents may start to depend on it and be reluctant to give up the swaddling.    I bought one of these for a pregnant friend but she wasn't in to swaddling her baby and never used it.  For that reason, I don't think it's a very good baby gift.  Some parents and babies just never need to do the swaddling thing.
B002AS9QJG|5|I cannot be without this diaper bag. It is pure genius. No more digging around for my keys with a screaming child on my hip. No more spilled juice! I can easily find my sunglasses! It has taken a great deal of hassle out of my day. Thank you Mrs. Smith for designing a bag that WORKS for moms.
B004V3GHM2|4|Very happy with these, bought for my granddaughter
B003D3NV98|5|Very soft and of good quality. Fits the Serta crib mattress I also purchased beautifully, without looseness or wrinkles. Wash very well, which is important as I purchased these sheets and the crib mattress as an orthopedic dog bed for a large dog.
B004AR91D6|5|I bought these for my third child as my second is stealing her paci!  This prevents him from snagging it from her.  I was going to get the Haba version but decided on these instead and they are working perfectly for our needs.
B000WJLKQM|3|It works well but I didn't get a lot of use out of it because my son is very tall and in a standard doorway my son was down to his knees in it in no time. FYI I did have it adjusted as high up as it would go
B00208RWVK|5|Soooo soft!  I got both sets.  The long one for the front and the set of two short ones for the ends.  My baby is teething and unfortunaley has already started on her crib.  Just put these on today.  I'm so impressed I had to write a review!  I will add to this if it ends up not working out.  But I can't imagine that.  It's a must for every crib!  And I imagine it would fit ANY crib.  I looked at a few.  These are the best!
B00KGLJ1RG|5|Great mirror!  Bought a second one for our other car. Originally we bought one from Target and could never get it positioned right to be able to see the baby. This one is perfect - you can change the angle in all directions and it stays put. Also much easier to install than other brands
B00006C29H|5|Definitely a must have.  At first it looks very confusing but with all the bells and whistles that this step and play piano has, it keeps him entertained 100%.  Like the other parents, we couldn't wait until he was upright to get him into this toy.  He stomps on the piano.. then scoots back and forth... loves the mike so he can be little dj and many more... This keeps him entertained so much it allows me to get so much stuff done.  One of the best gifts we received.
B0107SHZ3Y|5|What I can say...Amazon is always top of its class. Good product listing, fastest delivery. This product was exactly same as shown and of good quality. The product is made of cotton and it is very absorbent. It is perfect for your drooling baby and keeps him/her safe, clean and dry.
B00GS1GRL6|5|Excellent
B002QYW8LW|3|I've seen friends' babies chew up on this thing like mad dogs, so I figured it might work with mine. But my baby took a bite at it, pulled it out, and tossed it out the window. ... that was the end of it.
B00KM6BEH0|5|I LOVE these cups! They're so easy to clean, go through the dishwasher great, don't leak, are double walled and have a nice soft straw.
B00J098RAC|5|My niece loved it .... because i saved so much on the purchase of the 13 piece crib set, I was able to also purchase the mobile....thank you Amazon....!!
B0031QPNHA|5|I'll admit that I picked this out mostly because I couldn't resist the yellow gingham print. But I couldn't be happier with it. Baby isn't here yet but I have sat in it quite a bit while hubby has been putting things together in the baby room. It is so comfortable and I never want to get up once I'm sitting in it!
B002SG7JSK|3|I think the performance of this would be good. I only gave it 3 stars because I can't get past the smell. It has a very strong chemical odor. I've had it out on the porch for 3 weeks now and I still can't have it in the house yet!
B000056J66|5|[[ASIN:B000056J66 Neat Solutions 20-count Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats]]product is great...stays in place & entertains my 10 month old grandson
B0052TT6GI|5|Had my mom order these for me since she is a Prime member.<br />Love the bowls.<br />Didnt come with the bonus guide that is mentioned. My son has been on solids for a few months now, so it isnt needed ... but thats not the point.
B00EHKCH78|5|Excelent purchase
B004HFQOM2|4|I am pleased with the product. I was already familiar with the Avent bottles nd find them really good. Was a little worried that the sterilizer would feel very cheap, but it's not the case - I do feel stightly weary about the durability of the locks but supose it will be ok as long as I hand them it with care.
B00CF1STJG|1|I received a bag completely different to that offered on the page, is another model, also is defective, foul smelling, descocido, dirty and stained, looks used., I am very sad and unhappy, I am a customer of amazon and I think a lack of respect I want to trade him laying in the photo, or my money back because it was expensive, I feel cheated, estafada.Yo live in Colombia and I received it the day yesterday. Solucionenme the problem. thanks<br /><br />Recibi un bolso totalmente distinto al ofrecido en la pagina, es otro modelo, ademas esta defectuoso, con mal olor, descocido, sucio y manchado, parece usado., estoy muy triste e inconforme, soy cliente de amazon y me parece una falta de respeto desearia que me lo cambiaran por el que se encuentra en la foto, o me devuelvan mi dinero porque fue costoso, me siento engañada, estafada.Yo vivo en Colombia y lo recibi el dia de ayer . Solucionenme el problema. Gracias
B00ALOT55Q|4|This is a little smaller than you would think from the photos, but does the job. Very sturdy.
B003UMNC78|5|This little Piglet is just the toy for my 18-month-old granddaughter. Piglet is very soft with floppy arms & legs. His (her?) fur including clothes (?) is curly which is quite attractive. He has no odor whatsoever so I sprayed one squirt of my signature fragrance on the back of his neck and waited one month so the aroma would dissipate somewhat before he was presented to my grandchild. Now my little girl can snuggle & play with her Piglet and remember her Pooh-loving grandmother.<br /><br />The only \\"problem\\" with this Piglet is that he is so adorable, I wanted to keep him for myself. Ha!
B000HDOM0O|1|The end of the file is too pointed and sharp. It's hard enough to file a squirmy baby's nails without having to worry about accidentally poking him with a sharp tip.
B002OOTYPC|5|These are awesome. We bought two sets, because we use them frequently while out to dinner, or when dining at friend's or family's house when they don't have small silverware for our toddler. The carry case is awesome. Our toddler is in a phase where she likes to have silverware, even if she isn't really using it to feed herself quite yet. Washes easily in dishwasher.
B002SZK7QM|1|This is a cheaply made, expensive to by stroller.  We have a newborn and a toddler, and hoped that this would help.  The carseat which is great in and of itself barely clips onto the clips in the stroller.  There are snaps with no female part on the fabric sides of the seat, so the infant seat is constantly pushing it it down so you have to move it in order to clip the seat in.  Half the time only one side clips down.  The canopy does not match p, so there is no convenient way to block light for our newborn.  The clips which fold it are cheap and fall off all the time.  There are no cup holders or small storage compartment.  The bin at the bottom has sch a nrrow entry you have to shove everything in.  SAVE YOUR  MONEY!!!
B001PBF93Q|5|I have this stroller carseat combo in another pattern.  I wanted this pattern so bad but couldn't find it anywhere!  My daughter is 8 months old and is getting a little too big for the carseat, but it has served us well.  The stroller is great for shopping.  You don't have to worry about trying to rest the carseat on a shopping cart because you have plenty of room in the basket underneath the stroller to shop.  We've dragged this stroller through a flea market, across a beach, and around the block.  Would recommend this brand to anyone!
B00KBIHHZC|3|Nice bibs, annoyed that the description lists as &#34;snap closure&#34; these are velcro.
B00M1Y03SW|5|This bag is big enough to fit my son's milk and fit an additional little diaper bag in it. When we go out I just carry this bag with everything in it and throw it in the stroller. So convenient.
B009UPUFCY|2|Not as flat as we imagined it would be. When we put it under the mattress, it inclined it to the point where we were uncomfortable using it.
B000OFNFDA|4|This really is the best cloth diaper for the money.  You'll find more expensive ones out there, but they're not necessarily better.    The only downside (which is why I give this diaper 4 stars), is that they really didn't fit our newborn.  We had to wait til he was about 7 weeks old to use them... (about 10 pounds).  Fortunately, we had landfill diapers that friends gave us at showers to fill in the gap - but we had to use landfill diapers - which defeats the main reason to use cloth...  (besides saving money!) 7 weeks of landfill diapers!  what a bummer...    24 diapers have been fine, with washing/drying, and wearing, but 36 would make the rotation quite comfortable.    I would suggest buying the disposable/biodegradable diaper liners from another brand for when your baby reaches the solid food eating phase.  :)    Also, another golden nugget, is to hang any \\"stained\\" diapers or liners in the sunshine to make them white again.  It really works.  :)
B0071H0M9E|5|College package arrived  on time . great purchase  for the pink princes .
B004IYNG8C|5|I have pictures to add to this posting. This bag perfectly fits the Baby Jogger City Select Double Stroller. First, all wheels need to come off, the handle bar to the stroller needs to be pushed into the lower position and the brackets that attach the second seat need to come off. the two seats will have the canopies taken off and the foot rest in the shortest position. Place the large wheels in the wheel bag. We placed the 2 seats in first, then the folded frame and wheel bag and placed the additional wheels in gap areas. There was plenty of room for our Skip Hop Diaper Clutch as well as our Britax cup/handle bar storage bag. The nice thing about this bag is the wheels so we will be able to roll it down the jet way. We also will place this entire bag into a red Gate Check Stroller Bag (the one that's made for a double stroller). I recommend that whatever gate bag you choose for your stroller that you ALWAYS put it into a Red Gate Check Bag as well. This will do two things: 1. Keep your expensive stroller bag clean with an additional layer and most importantly 2. will make sure that your stroller will not accidentally end up in baggage claim---sometimes black stroller bags are mistaken for regular gate-checked luggage. The red bag will make sure there is no mistake and you will have it at the jet way when you get off the plane.
B000COCTM6|4|Very pretty but the comb is not like the one pictured!!
B000L9JNK8|3|My son has the blue bunny and my daughter kept taking his bunny. So we got her this one which is girl version. Well you can't tell but the blanket part is two separate fabrics on the left and right side. My daughter doesn't like it. My son's blanket is one piece all the way around and has more of a blanky feel. I think they do sell one in pink like that, I just was the unlucky one to pick the wrong one.
B000A1CLVK|3|I purchased this seat for my son who just turned 2.  He is very big for his age (35 pounds), however, he is not mature enough for a booster seat.  I liked that this was safety rated for up to 65 pounds, as I know my son will need to be buckled in for a long time yet.  Anyhow, the seat is way heavy, which I liked.  It looked and felt very safe.  I installed it into my very small car and it fit okay.  I raised the head-rest as high as it would go (since at the highest setting a child should be able to use until the top of their ears are at the top of the head-rest) and at that setting the head rest was about 2 inches from my roof.  Not a huge problem since I am planning on buying a roomier car this fall.  The seat was very easy to install and adjust.  The crotch strap was too short and too close and my son was pretty much sitting on top of it.  I had a friend of mine try it with her son who is a year older than mine (my son cannot talk and has a high tolerance for pain) and he said that it hurts his wee wee to sit in it.  I sold it on ebay and bought the Marathon instead.  I really liked the side impact protection.  That was the reason I had purchased this instead of the Marathon to begin with.  The seat sits up high, so my son really liked that.  He did not have a problem with the wings blocking his view.  Anyhow, I believe this seat would be great for an infant, however, it is not very comfortable for toddlers.
B006UA1HE2|5|I use these in my sons rock and play and they are super handy when he inevitably leaks through his diaper! So much easier to wash these pads than disassembling the rock and play.
B000E3LDEU|5|I'm 5'2\\" and only 110 lbs..this stroller is lightweight (around 14 lbs) and so easy to fold. It has a very large sun canopy and also cool design.  Only 1 downside, they dont have cup holder and snack tray...overall it's awesome stroller and less money than P3.
B00FYJQ85S|5|it took forever for my diapers to finally arrive. once they did I was very pleased. they are extremely absorbent. the colors are gorgeous. I wish I had used these with my first child
B004TJJ95U|5|love it.
B001J8HEDS|4|Great bottle.  Easy to grip.  Love the glass option for baby bottles and these are wonderful.  The bad first:  the measurements aren't precise and specific like most other bottles.  There are markings for whole ounces, but with the way the rubber sits against the glass these are &#34;close enough&#34; bottles. If you are using a bottle to supplement or require a precise volume, I wouldn't recommend these.  Also, even the slowest flow nipple is still too fast the milk will pour down baby's throat.  No thanks!  Now the good: fun colors.  Easy grip of the bottle for both caregiver and baby.  Bottles fit most standard nipples.  I love the Medela Calma nipple and it attaches perfectly to the Lifefactory bottles.  As bottle feeding increases, I will definitely be getting more of these. My favorite bottle yet!
B006ZISTS6|5|SUPER cute and high quality - I've bought Cosco before as a lower priced alternative to other name brands and haven't been disappointed.  The Kontiki pattern is gender neutral but still vibrant and adorable.  Easy to set up and take down.
B007CTPWXW|4|Have the Baby Jogger City Mini GT and saw a review that said to get the Britax Organiser instead of the Baby Jogger one.  So far so good, fits the stroller and is just what you need.
B002GQFOZW|5|I needed one more valance for the nursery window in my daughters room so this was a perfect find. Now her room is perfect.
B001LARMEU|4|The flexible spout allowed my little one to catch onto cups and bottles have been officially retired.  The cup does spill if you don't lock the lid so be prepared for some spills.
B001PBFWMO|5|Very helpful thing! It's as importent thing in your house as a toothbrush. Clean a nose perfectly well.
B00FZGLI00|5|This has been very helpful when traveling with our baby. We've used it in hotel rooms, the park and other places. We place his toys in the pouch.
B002VPCQCW|5|My 5-year-old grandson loves it. His 6-year-old cousin clamored for it, so I got him one, too. Both have issues with the dark. Both love the different color lights.
B00016BPA2|3|The pump was fine.  Enclosed product coupons were expired and when we called the retailer they had crap customer service.  The manufacturer sent new coupons.  All in all the product is as expected, the retailer was poor and the manufacturer was accomodating.
B002MFMB80|3|First, my 6 month old daughter absolutely loves &#34;twitch&#34;.  Mom, however, has a few problems with it:<br /><br />1. The jittering only lasts for about 2 seconds per pull... so basically this never jitters because I am not willing to sit and pull his neck every 2 seconds... Maybe when Phoebe is older she will enjoy doing this herself.<br /><br />2. Phoebe likes to chew on his feet and ultimately sucks the entire foot into her mouth.  It hasn't happened yet, but the foot seems like the perfect size for swallowing.  Luckily it's very firmly attached to the leg, but I don't let her play with this toy alone for fear of her choking.
B001RTTN7E|3|Although I love that it is organic,  they were really rough to touch...especially the leaves printed one. However, after several washes the material soften up nicely. I did not use it to swaddle but as a blanket on the ground so the babies could lay on it . I really wish there were other designs and I did not care for these prints, but they did the job!
B00ISS2JPK|5|It looks great and will grow with my little one for quite a while. My favorite thing about it is how well it mounts, it's easy to install and when I have it cinched down and shake it hard my whole seat moves before this car seat does. I feel very confident and safe with this product and it is just a joy to see in my back seat.
B00Q8460P6|3|I find these bolsters very useful for my baby girl. They keep her from rolling over and they are really cute! They also provide cushion for her pretty much anywhere in the house because of their size.<br /><br />They are the perfect size for her, but I would have preferred them to be a little heavier so I can use them when she's older.
B003G2YUT6|3|basic video monitor....doesn't hold a charge for long and outside the house reception is spotty. We bought it for $60 new so a good price.
B00H8MRDXA|3|This Pack 'N Play took some time to assemble because of all the extra parts that came with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The changing table is nice and sturdy, the baby will not dip or roll to one side like other changing tables.<br />The diaper station comes with a handy built-in container for wipes, large and deep pockets for diapers clothes, etc.<br />Has entertainment console with lights, classical music, &#34;nature&#34; inspired music, vibration, and audio adjustment<br />Cons:<br />-Because the changing table cannot be flipped over to one side when not in use, it takes up half the space of the Pack N Play, which will be useless when the baby gets older and wants to use the bottom compartment<br />-The bassinet is small (because of the changing table) and baby grows out of it fast (I had to lay my 3 month old diagonally to fit)<br />-Mobile is flimsy and not entertaining, starts are detachable due to the velcro<br />-The light feature of the entertainment console is useless. When the bassinet is in place, It covers up the light. The light itself is very weak and turns on easily if the bassinet pushes against it.
B00BI2V8VY|5|love it
B002T68M30|5|I have yet to use these bottles or sleeves, but I did put the sleeve on a bottle. It fits nicely. I will probably buy more sleeves when I start using these bottles.
B001S3G16K|5|Perfect size & the logo is nice too.
B00473YTZS|5|Great product and a must for new Moms!
B00H3X7ZXM|1|This mirror is not safe and I would not recommend it. I couldn't get it to stick for very long so I just gave up. I didn't want it to fall and hit my son.<br /><br />Upon further research I learned that mirrors are not recommended anyway. As they can become projectiles in a car accident. So I won't be purchasing any sort of replacement either.
B000IDSLOG|5|Bought this for a girlfriend who is expecting a baby in July. These are really popular among my mommy friends. They have been used by multiple kids; they last a long time and work really well. The most frequent thing I've noticed is that the color eventually fades. But, for the purposes of teething (and cuteness!) it's a great product.
B00286DBRI|5|Bought this to go with the matching bedding for my daughter for Christmas and we love it. Curtains are very well made not cheep at all.
B000S8O9ME|5|This is a simple, very effective device. We travel a lot and take it with us just in case the place we are staying has a dangerous shower or tub, and it has worked every time, no matter what the surface. It is a very good buy and well worth the money. The strength is excellent. I weigh 230 pounds and it supports me very well.
B004FPYG7O|5|I have not used this lid yet, but my son loves this particular sippy cup.  He would drink formula and juice from the Nuk cup before he was 6 months old.  I don't like the latex lids so this is why I ordered this one.
B0085K6416|5|I really like these blankets. The colors are bright and they haven't faded or dyed any of my other clothes when I've washed them. The blankets fold up into a decently small square that fits in my purse easily. I have a large purse but not diaper bag sized. I like that they have a little bit of stretch, not because it is stretchy fabric but because of the loose weave. They are large so I can use them as a cover when breast feeding and I won't get ridiculously hot, and I can swaddle my baby who grew too long for the summer swaddle me in three weeks. After getting nine hundred receiving blankets for my first kid, I haven't used any of those and have survived just fine with these four plus one little blanket that was a gift. These blankets are used daily and probably will continue to be used as such until this baby doesn't like being swaddled.
B000O7SR18|5|fits perfect
B000CC3V1Q|5|I had to find a stroller on a short notice for a quick trip out of town with my one year old.  Found this one at toys r us.. My son LOVES IT and so do I.  Very easy to push, turn and the front wheels have locking capability to turn or roll straight.  great deal..
B000WJLGX4|3|This is a larger size pack n play.  I also had a smaller one which I preferred over this one even though this had the changer, I never used it.  I found the smaller one much nicer easier to transport, set up and break down.  I honestly would not purchase again... if only I had a time machine!
B00BWZ9ZS0|4|Great product and color. Very portable.  Wish I didn't purchase another one months ago that is bulkier than this one.
B003LQU0GO|1|My husband and I picked this product up from WalMart for what we thought was a decent price.  The first few times we put our son in it seemed too high for his little legs to reach the blue triangle.  At about 5 months old he could hardly reach the triangle but loved to play with the toys so we would let him play in it.  There is a panel with a (pointy) flower and a (flexible) vine that he seemed to really be attracted to.  Lucky for us we keep a really close eye on him because he managed to grab the vine which bends and shove a good portion of it in his mouth and choke himself.  We took it out of his mouth and though surely this was a fluke.  A couple of days later the same thing happened.  We have completely removed that toy panel from the tray to avoid this problem in the future however I would not recommend this jumper.
B00GU6K2Z6|4|Great product, no real complaints.  The only thing about this print (robot) is that the strip of fabric is too skinny for you to ever see a full robot.  So it looks a little weird, design-wise.  If I didn't know what it was supposed to be I'm not sure I could figure it out.  Product works as it should, though!
B001CBAJBQ|5|Great product, my babies really like to look at them! Fast shipping too.
B001L2SA3A|5|Excelente
B00DB5F114|5|Great
B00ESXRDAU|5|This xylophone is really cute! The xylophone is in the shape of an crocodile on wheels. The metal plates of the xylophone are painted in nice colors. While the sound made when striking metal plates might not always be perfect, it does work well. The mallet is attached by a string so it cannot get lost. The string on the one we have it pretty much just long enough to play all the notes but doesn't have any more slack (the photo shown seems to be longer). When the crocodile is pulled by the string, the mouth opens and closes (causing quite a delight to kids as you can imaging).<br /><br />The best part is your kids will be able to make their own music! I love to hear the sounds of my kids playing this instrument. It is much better for them to make their own song than push one button and have the toy play a song for them for a half minute. Modern technology cannot beat the classic concept of a xylophone. Both my 1.5 year old and my 3.5 year old both like playing with this toy.
B002VUCBBS|4|So far I did not find any problem. Good.price is reasonable. I do not give 5 Star because it deserves 4.
B00110RR6S|5|Papa and Grandma were very happy with the ordering and delivery of the tooth fairy pillow.  The pillow itself was well made<br />and decorated perfectly.  Our 5 yr. old granddaughter LOVED it.  I'd been checking out boxes and cases for the lost teeth but<br />this one is more practical and suitable and snuggly, if need be.  : )
B0069JBKHI|1|Crap support for Android devices.  The app is free but it isn't updated and is horrible.  See the app reviews on Google Play https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.withings.withbaby&hl=en .  Without a good working Android app the camera is useless! Apparently it works great on iOS but it is supposed to work also on Android devices.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE HOPING TO USE AN ANDROID DEVICE!  Or check the recent Google Play comments to see if they have updated the app to make it useable.
B004HWDMV6|1|We have had this monitor for over a year and I hate it.  I bought it for the new baby, but ended up having to use it for the older child because he doesn't nap anymore.  The biggest problem is the buttons on the front of the monitor.  If you wear it on your waistband, you will turn off the volume and not know.  I don't know how many times I bumped up on the washer or kitchen counter and turned the volume to zero.  There is no indicator to tell you what level the volume is, so it could be at zero and you won't know until the baby is hysterical. Also, to turn it off completely, you have to hold it down for a few seconds.  Those seconds feel like an eternity when you are standing outside the baby's door waiting to go in so you won't get feedback.  We have had 3 different monitor brands and while the quality is similar, the design on this one just doesn't work for the intended purpose.
B00STAO4PU|5|this is imaginative, good quality and returns children to a great time while playing
B001OC5UMQ|4|Love the door but a little hard to install.
B00OU1R51W|4|A good tether for my baby. Easy enough for him to hold onto and play with (gnaw and drool with).
B00PTL6VLC|5|These cups are wonderful! The best part, they DON'T LEAK! These are my 12 month olds favorite sippy cups. The Click Lock technology safe proofs any lid leaking, too! Best gift!
B004NSPFRI|3|This product is a fun way to hear the baby hicccup and kick. I haven't heard the heartbeat of the baby yet, but there's still plenty of time because I'm only 29 weeks. My advice is not to get your hopes up if you don't hear the baby's heartbeat. My friends have the same product and are about 24 weeks...they were able to hear their baby. I think the position of the baby is a very important factor and not necessarily the fault of the device.
B005A3LYQG|3|Fast shipping, but almost can't hear anything its very low
B00009IMCK|4|my baby dont like it.
B00BLBLR1I|1|This thing was awesome when it worked, it only lasted about 2 months. I went through 3 of these pumps already, all having issues. Not fun when you are dependent on your pump. AND when you contact Spectra Baby directly, good luck actually speaking to someone, terrible service. Took them 3 weekd to send replacement.
B007AR8JUE|4|This book is adorable! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is the picture sizes are a little weird, so it is hard to print them to fit.
B00BBSOZJM|5|Easy to wash, and the bottom pouch collects the spilled foods
B002LARFKU|4|This is our favorite baby towel, it is a good size and a nice thicker material.  It really gets little bit dry and keeps him warm before dressing.
B000XT30G4|5|Very attractive gate. We use it as a puppy gate on the wrought iron staircase in our Mediterranean style home and it doesn't detract from the décor. The gate is easy to open and close (for an adult) so it is convenient to use, much better than having to step over a gate, which on stairs can be dangerous.
B00CEDG2VC|5|Cute, practical and so soft. Little Giraffe is a quality product and appreciate the softest fabrics! I will stock up on these cute little socks. Fits for a long term use.
B000M41BRA|5|I bought this for my pregnant wife, and she LOVES it.  Can't sleep without it.  She's very excited about the fact that it doubles as a feeding pillow (like a Boppie) that will also support her back as it supports baby.  Outstanding price and quality, and the shipping was very fast.
B00B7M7BN4|5|Much better than the suction based ones. Also safer that the retractable ones and more stable than regular ones.<br />Quite good for money.
B00006966I|1|After an hour of being in the store staring at the aisle of bottles and reading the packages I thought these bottles would be the best for my first baby (what little did I know!).  After about a week and a half of frustrated feedings, I switched to Platex Nurser Drop Ins.  The VentAire nipples constantly collapsed.  The stage 1 nipples were way too slow and my daughter just sucked and got nothing.  The stage 2 nipples were way too fast and she choked all the time.  Once on the Platex Nurser for 2 feedings she was doing much better, less gassy and such a happy baby!
B004J35KEK|3|Since I just received this bag today this driver is not on the durability but of its color. I love the light faded gray in the picture!! Unfortunately the one I received today is much darker and with barely any fade and looks cheap:( If I would have known this I would have gotten the black one. With all that being said it still looks like it's going to be a good diaper bag.
B0052QYLUM|5|I love it! It has a good quality. I recommend it. Excellent purchase and I would buy it again. Thank you.
B000056JMU|5|The liners fit easily and transport easily. We have never had a problem with leakage. We liked, in particular, how the plastic caves in as baby sucks on the milk, thus reducing the risk that baby swallows air (causing gas and all kinds of not-fun experiences for babes!).<br />I also like them because they DON'T cause as much garbage as some other bottle/liner combinations. 5 stars.
B001NJRGIG|2|I installed a set of Tot Loks on several cabinet doors but discovered that they are impossible to install on our cabinet doors that have glass inserts and on our drawers. I bought this item based on the product photos alone, thinking that they appeared narrow enough to fit the door frames. I also chose this product due to the metal construction, and had planned to use them on several wall cabinets for earthquake safety.    I was able to install them on my cabinet doors that have glass panels. The frame portion of these doors are narrower than that of the standard wood-paneled doors, so I was able to mount the latch with some slight bending to fit. These cabinets hold infrequently-accessed display items. Although they are out of reach of children, I wanted something sturdy that would hold the door shut (and the heavy bowls and dishes inside) in case of an earthquake.    Next, I tried to install a latch on the utensil and cutlery drawer. It is the uppermost drawer in the base cabinet, and a standard-width countertop is installed above the cabinet. Unfortunately due to the overhang of the countertop, when opening the drawer there's only about a 3/4\\" gap for me to reach inside and unhook the latch. Both my wife and I have slender fingers and it's a really close and uncomfortable squeeze, not to mention inconvenient to use. Because I'm pressing near the bend in the latch, it is actually deforming the latch with every use. I found that after a few trials, the latch would no longer catch onto the screw and I had to rebend the latch to get it to work. If I bend it too much, the tip of the latch hits the face frame and prevents the drawer from closing, requiring you to press down on the latch. This is very unreliable and inconvenient. I removed the latch and will try to come up with another way to install the Tot Lok.    The other concern was that the catch is simply a screw that is driven into the side of the face frame. Although the frame on my cabinets are cherry hardwood, I am concerned that someone might not expect the latch in place or forget and pull hard enough to split the face frame or pull the latch out of the door. So the \\"ultra strong\\" latch might survive but the door or frame might be damaged beyond repair. I think a better design would be to make the latches longer and bend them so that they catch onto the back of the face frame. This would eliminate the need for a screw into the face frame, and also makes installation much easier.    I was hoping that the latch was stainless steel or a more-resilient spring steel, but it and the screws are simply chromed steel. On one door installation, the head of the catch screw twisted off even though I had predrilled holes. On closer examination, the screws seem to be of much poorer quality and finish than the latches.    I had planned to install several more latches on more-frequently-used wall cabinet doors for earthquake safety, but decided not to because they are too inconvenient to use, especially one-handed. Aside from bending or removing the latch or screw, there's no easy way to temporarily disable and re-enable the lock.
B00ALOT55Q|5|SERVES IT'S PURPOSE.<br />KEEPS MY CHILD SAFE WHILE I DO CHORES AROUND THE HOUSE.<br />IT HAS STOPPERS SO IT DOESN'T SLIDE EVERYWHERE<br /><br />I JUST WISH IT WEIGHED A LITTLE BIT MORE, AS I GAVE BIRTH TO A MINIATURE HULK AND BY NOW, IF HE GETS TIRED OF BEING IN IT, HE LIFTS IT UP NOW.
B00GM52N0M|4|I fill up the 'spoon' with hummus, apple sauce, avocado or whatever, hand it to my 9 month old son and he can direct it right into his mouth!  I'm going to try having him do the dipping soon...
B00028XJNA|5|My baby was in the NICU for 7 weeks. These bags were essential for storing/freezing my milk so I could build up my supply when my baby wasn't able to. I now have over 9 gallons of milk safely saved and frozen in these bags. It would have been extremely expensive to use plastic or glass containers, plus I wouldn't have had the freezer room. Now that she is home I still use the bags, but also use the plastic bottles while we continue to work on breastfeeding and me not needing to pump anymore. The fresh milk that doesn't get used then can easily go into the freezer. They are pricey, but I've never had any problems.
B0047PAHUW|5|Elephant wasn't favorite wubbanub!
B00BV0EUS6|4|I love this item, but it was only 3.99 when I got it in Dec. I want more, but now it's $10. What? One of the lids won't stay shut so not 100% impressed, but it works great otherwise.
B007VBXJB8|5|The bottles are cute and ergonomic.  Perfect size for newborn feedings for a breastfeeding mother .
B000ZKHVMU|5|This diaper sprayer has been a great addition to our diaper cleaning process. It's super easy to install and the all-metal valve allows you to adjust the flow of water to set the strength of the spray. No leaking, no mess. It's been great.<br /><br />The sprayer itself is only plastic, so it's important not to leave it turned on otherwise the parts inside could wear out prematurely. This is a tremendous help for those really dirty diapers.
B0064CTIC4|5|Got this for our infant, she used to hate bath time because we were overly cautious on the water temperature. Thanks to this slick little ducky, we now have the water nice and warm, and she is happy. Highly recommended.
B004MDLHZ8|5|This cover is big and fits around you.  Made of a cool cotton material , feels like a sheet.  Adjustable neck with boning in edge to keep shape so you can watch baby nurse. Love this thing. Used it in airports, airplanes, restaurants, museums....  Keeps nursing between you and baby private and comfortable!  Pocket is convenient for a burp cloth .... Washes well.  Looks new after washing and black one isn't a lint collector!  The patterns are beautiful too. I have 3 of these now.
B006PB2CR2|5|So far so good!  I needed a car seat to work with lap belts in a vintage car.  Unable to attach a tether, I was concerned about it being snug enough, and not wobbly.  So far, it is perfect.
B004BSFC6E|5|Very cute and high quality toy, my twin boys love it. Seems durable and well made, and there are lots of fun colors/textures/materials to interest little minds.
B00JDN9O6G|5|Have been very pleased so far! Holds very well and for the price you can't beat it!
B001QGIPS6|4|These trays work well, but they are hand wash only. I also do the trick of storing milk in a plastic bag after it is frozen since the trays don't provide freezer protection. You do have to be careful with the delicate dance to the freezer - they must be placed in a very level surface otherwise the milk will spill everywhere. I have a fridge with a pullout freezer at the bottom, which means that opening the freezer door sloshes the trays around, so be wary of this if you have the same type of fridge. I would probably have given this product 5 stars if it was dishwasher safe and a little less prone to spilling. I typically under-fill each ounce container to reduce the amount of spills from closing the freezer drawer.
B000IDSLOG|4|Cute giraffe, though my son rarely chewed on it.
B0006B2Q9G|5|I got this item as a baby shower gift.  I love this diaper bag.  The backpack allows me to have total hands-free without standing funny to keep the bag on my shoulder when dealing with my son.  It's worn well so far (he's 3 months old) and it's very comfortable with padding and not too heavy.  It has two large outside pockets, one that's lined with that shiny metal-like substance so i can have an icepack with frozen food.  Fully frozen milk with an icepack turned slushy after 7 hours.  There's 2 ways to access the primary inside compartment, which I use more often than I expected.  The bag is big enough that the secondary pocket to the main compartment is the perfect place to keep a one liter water bottle.  The other thing i like is that it's not too girly... my husband will carry it.  It also comes with a great plastic pad that I use a lot when change him.  There's enough pockets that you can stay organized.  It took me awhile to get a \\"system\\" when changing him away from home (first time mom) and having the stuff I needed in a predictable location helped.   <br />
B0018CNL82|5|My comments on \\"Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushion\\" at Amazon.    We have a raised hearth in our family room that's about 12\\" high. It has a slate top with a perfectly square edge. It's very hard and very sharp. My young grandkids like to run back and forth in that room and I was afraid one of them would fall face first onto that hard sharp edge. I installed the Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushion about 2 months ago.     Well today it happened. My 13 month old granddaughter who is just starting to walk fell face first onto the edge. It hit her right in the mouth, so hard that her head bounced back. She cried for about ten minutes but after mommy gave her a Popsicle she was fine and had no serious injury. Man, am I glad that edge protector was there. I shudder to think what would have happened without it. I'm guessing there would have been a couple of broken teeth at least, and maybe much worse.    It was pretty easy to install if you follow the directions exactly. And the black color matches the black slate. You hardly even notice it.     The instructions say \\"not for hearths\\", but I think that's because of flammability concerns. We never use the fireplace so I wasn't worried about that.    My only suggestion would be to make it thicker, but I gave it a 5 star because I think it saved my granddaughter from serious injury. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with small children.
B001RCLI2E|5|My 9 month old is not really into stuffed animals yet, but she likes this one because it plays music, and even better, it has the little wind up knob that she can play with as it turns.  This is one of our \\"quiet toys\\" that we play with when winding down before a nap.  From my perspective, it's a very cute toy.  The mix and match fabrics are charming and I think the soft colors are even prettier in person than in the pictures.  With all the  pink, maybe slightly more suited toward a girl, but it looks like there is a monkey version if you need a more traditionally boy toy.
B004GWPIDC|1|Waste of money and over priced. The seller end up being cool, although it didn't start that way. After I got it I immediately contact the seller and went on Amazon to request a refund for this tiny little overpriced product. Did it except my return but once they got it they started cleaning that I washed it or did something to it when I actually did absolutely nothing (I didn't even let my baby touch it or see it… The truth is I didn't want him to be disappointed in me once you saw this useless over priced item and seen his dad waste his money that's not a good way of leadership) and they were very tough on believing me that I never touched it. The truth is I believe someone bought it and also returned it. And then rest assure after a few back-and-forth emails They did refund my money. Thx.
B000CSBP3G|5|This is a great product and will eventually save us from having to wash the small cloth bibs as often.  However, these bibs are still a little too big for our little one (she's 12 pounds) so they don't fit comfortably yet.  No fault of the product, I just didn't realise that she was too small for the plastic bibs.
B007TA390W|5|Even better than in the picture
B0055HXIIE|5|Cheer what works excellent
B000BONX68|5|This harness if fantastic!!! I bought this to keep my one year old daughter from climbing out of the shopping cart. The straps in shopping carts do not hold her in, she works her way out of all of them. I wanted something that I could use along with my cart cover because my daughter puts her mouth on every part of the cart and this harness works great with my cart cover. I just put the cart cover on and put the harness strap over the back, under the cart seat, and up through the leg of the cart cover and snap the clasp closed.This thing deserves every bit of 5 stars and more. It is super easy to put on her and super easy to attach to the shopping cart. It's on and off in seconds.  The adjusters also move with ease, they are super easy to slide to tighten or loosen. This product is a dream for me, I love it! My daughter could not climb up or wriggle her way out and I am free to shop without  worrying that if I take my eye off her for a second, she will go head first out of the cart.
B00UV6F4TU|5|Perfect replacement for a diaper bag, especially for the 1+ age.
B004C43JJ4|5|We've been using this seat for nearly a year and my 18 month old son will fit in it for a long time to come. It's easy to wash, easy to move if we want to take it somewhere, and it's not hard to adjust it to most chairs.
B00IMN8SW4|1|I sent this set as a gift with gift wrapping. Instead the set was sent to me as a gift without wrapping.
B00CMRBIFK|1|Doesn't stick to wall very well. Poor quality and seemed to be out of order in numbering the pieces.
B00009IMCK|5|Awesome! Baby loves it!
B007A2XAMQ|5|Made of quality and our daughter loves it. Durable and withstands slobber and wear and tear nicely. Recommend buying two, to have a back up for when one gets lost or in the wash...
B004J4VXZY|5|works for the bottles I use! the Playtex nurser! Works just like the ones u buy to go with it
B00N5YCJ70|5|This pillow and cover is probably the best thing ever invented
B0042D69V0|5|The new grandbaby loves this!  Son and daughter-in-law asked us if we would mind getting him something early for Christmas, and this is what they asked for. They did all the research, we just made the Amazon purchase-- and so handy to have it sent right to their door!<br /><br />We visited this past weekend, and was so glad to see how well made and thoughtful the design was. The Jumperoo has so many fun things for baby to look at and play with, and has really cute sounds too!  His little feet don't quite touch the floor yet, so we put a pillow underneath and he can bounce to his heart's content.  He loves the flashing lights! Grandson gets bored easily (as most babies do!) and this has a lot of different things to amuse him.  If he gets tired of one thing, a quarter turn and there are all new toys to occupy his hands and mind. We were trying to get pictures of him smiling or laughing, and after exhausting ourselves trying by bouncing, singing, swaying, etc, we put him in this and then we had plenty of smiles to photograph.
B00V7DM4BW|5|He loves it and he can aim better.
B005O1RVJI|5|My daughter just turned three months old and we gave her this for Christmas. She has just started playing with toys, being able to hold them and put them in her mouth. She really seems to like staring at the soft ball! It's a hit at our place ;)
B00J7KU3LA|5|was never a fan of the bulb syringe, even though we made it through my firstborn's infancy using just that.  he tolerated it though, which made using the bulb possible... not so with my second son, heh.  the little guy absolutely hates the suction pressure it creates, and so when i saw this product on sale on amazon, i jumped on it, and thank goodness i did.  not only has it made cleaning out the junk in his nose effortless, but my son actually really enjoys when i use it on him (when was the last time your baby came running up to you, excited for you to clean his nose?)!  Cleanup is just as effortless: just remove the hose, unscrew the bottle from the nose piece, and rinse the three components under warm water for a few seconds.  i saw a couple posts on here claiming they were sucking boogies right up through the straw into their mouths, but i've used this many times now and have never once had this happen to me.  for those running into that issue, i can only suggest to wash the product after EVERY use.<br /><br />nobody likes to see their children suffering from a runny/stuffy nose... do them and yourselves a favor and pick this up!  Oh and for the sake of being honest, I purchased this with a 90% off coupon, but would still purchase this for $20 after knowing what i know now about this product.
B00APU45UQ|5|Great gate! I love how it opens both ways and closes by itself. Goes great with my d&eacute;cor too!
B007CKKPHO|5|I bought this as a shower gift for my niece. One has bumble bees and the other stripes - very cheery for the new addition to the family.
B004R0S8WG|5|We received one as a gift when our daughter was born, and have since ordered 3 more to alternate them out. They are soft and the perfect \\"lovie\\" size. They do wear out quicker when dried by machine, so maybe keep the setting on low or air dry. They make great gifts!
B00E0HHR8W|5|The “American Baby Company 100 Cotton Knit Blanket” is a cozy, very soft cotton knit blanket.  The blanket’s knit is a stockinette stitch.  The gray, white and pastel design is a more sophisticated look than many blankets that are made specifically for infants.  The weight is light enough for warmer climates, but is heavier than the readily available flannel receiving blankets.<br /><br />This item is packaged for gift giving.  However, you should take care when snipping the threads that anchor the layers of the blanket together.  A ribbon that surrounds the blanket near the top fold protects the blanket from accidental snipping.  However, the stitch at the bottom portion of the blanket is done directly on the blanket’s surface.  Even if you use extreme care, it is easy to snag or snip one of the yarns making up the blanket.<br /><br />When washed on gentle cycle in warm water and then dried on the delicate cycle, the “American Baby Company 100 Cotton Knit Blanket” shrunk to 29” wide; the length remained 30”.  After only one washing/drying, the blanket showed some piling.  The edges remained intact.<br /><br />If you travel, this blanket would also be a useful item in your carry-on.  It is compact, but large enough to cover your arms and shoulders.  The design is not juvenile and the blanket is easy to wash.  Because of its dual utility – for both baby and Grandma – the “American Baby Company 100 Cotton Knit Blanket” receives five stars.
B007NG5UF4|5|This monitor is SUPERIOR to the one I had previously.  And, now with the second grandchild due in June, I'm feeling more confident about that monitor that will be in her room.  When they visit, I want them to feel comfortable.  We can take it out to the pool and STILL hear her if she arouses!
B003KN27AK|3|We can usually fit three green Soothie pacifiers in one, or four NUK.With two little ones being about to grab the right pacifier quickly has been great.  One of them has had the velco  come off, so it won't stay closed, but we still use it.
B00B7M7BN4|3|My commute is about 60 minutes one way and the sun in the summer will melt the side of your face during that time. I got this for my 2012 Altima to stick on the driver's side window. It will get on there if you angle it just so. When I have it on the window I obviously cannot roll down the window so I have to stick it on and take it down pretty often. Here are my results.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Easy application<br />-Sticks pretty good<br />-Cheap<br /><br />Cons<br />-Doesn't block the sun as well as I'd like.<br />-After sticking it on and taking it down maybe 10 times, it loses any stickiness and will not stick to the window anymore. Trash.<br /><br />If you buy this to stick on a window and plan on just leaving it there, this isn't a bad choice. However, if you need to take it down a lot, you should look for something else.
B004HWHYG0|2|I have bought 4 of them because they last 8 months, the monitor just stops working, at first I thought that was me or my baby that brake it but the last one that I bought I took really good care of it and happened the same, and they do not have warranty for that.
B009YSYD20|5|We bought it but my wife never used, it looks nice though
B00CE422EM|1|I bought this manual pump to use as backup to my electric for use on the weekends when I didn't want to bring my electric pump home on the weekends. I thought I would try to save some money and purchase a brand I hadn't heard of, but looked solid. Wrong move! I really don't like it at all. There is not enough suction at all and when trying to pump I keep accidentally knocking the top cap off which makes you have to stop and put it back together again. Overall I found this pump to be completely inefficient and poorly designed.
B004OBZFYM|5|This is my go to snack bag.  We have several brands and  I prefer the Kushies mostly for the fabric.  Its soft and cleans well and the velcro has held up very well.  I have a Lunchskins bag too and I'm afraid the velcro is going to rip one of these days as the fabric is really stiff and some of the seams are unraveling already.  The Kushies seems like it will hold up better.  I ordered two more of these and the small snack size too.  Beware that the picture is misleading. The medium bag is a square sandwich size bag and the photo shows the small bag instead.
B000JWSO9I|5|My 4-month old son also loves this teether along with his Sophie giraffe and palumba wooden teether.  I alternate between the three to give him variety.  So far, he is happy to play with all three and I am happy because they are all natural and safe for him.  It keeps falling off though so I do use a pacifier string that clips on his shirt so he doesn't get frustrated...
B00318CLT6|1|This cup is too hard to suck on and my son hates to use it, after a few attempts he cries and asks for the old one. We had the avent magic cup and it worked great, but I bought the Thermos Foogo because it is bpa free.. I waste my money!It also has no cap and it would be a pretty dirty cup.  Plus it does not hold enough for liquid and it is made in china  Spend your money elsewhere.
B002UD65X6|5|I love how soft this is!  It's easy to wash, fits great, and looks nice on our espresso changing table and... what can I say... \\"brown\\" is the BEST color for a changing pad!  Hides little messes and accidents between washings pretty well.  :)
B000J6CDY6|5|This is great for travel or home.  It's the same as th big sheep sound wise, just in a smaller size.
B0038TVER8|5|my three year daughter has been carrying this thing around with her since, well since she has been old enough to carry things. twice i've had to pull over the car after it flew out the window. i have spent countless hours searching for it. she has recently taken to smuggling it into daycare in the sleeve of her coat as the daycare does not allow personal toys. not sure what it is about this thing but it is magical. buy at least two and secretly rotate them.
B00138YI7Y|4|When our children go to milk at 1 year we take them off the bottle. This is child number 5 and we have tried a number of sippy cups. Some she did not like to suck so hard, some the straws fall off. This is her favorite of all and it was the only cup she would drink her milk out of. It is so easy to hold and she liked the longer silicon at the top. Yes they dont last as long, but they are cheap and you can replace them. It is worth it to have a cup that your child really likes and make the transtion from bottle to sippy cup really easy.
B00AYZFM86|5|Very cute book.  It is mostly for the first year.  There are pages for later years but it's definitely focused on the early milestones which is what I wanted.  No issues with damage during shipping at all.
B008FOBB24|5|Cute heads of happy animals, the main colors are pink and green which fit great in my nursery of little bunny:)
B00J2P9YG0|5|nice love it
B001GQ2S02|2|We picked this specific monitor because of the brand and it was one of the more expensive ones at the store but still not breaking the bank (we've been burnt before by trying to save and pick the cheapest item...learning the hard way that you get what you pay for). Great looking product with awesome features, but within about 3-4 months the product started to deteriorate.  First the picture began flickering...next thing you know the picture began freezing.  With that came the audio not working periodically.  The monitor receiver would be on the night table next to my wife, and I would hear the baby cry through the hallway without the monitor picking it up!  It works periodically, but should be more dependable...for atleast the 1st year!  I thought that maybe it was just mine, but after researching other reviews, learned it is a problem with the product.      Unless you get it second hand, I do not recommend this product.
B005G60EDG|5|I can't believe how hard it is to find a decent jar/powder puff anymore.  Looked at drug stores and cosmetic stores.  This one is perfect! The small handle on the puff keeps your hands from getting into the power, and makes it easy to pat and apply.  The jar fits the puff really well, and always picks up just the right amount of powder without it blowing up in your face.  Thanks !
B0009JOSNM|4|Works well & easy to use. My 5 mnth old seems content in it.
B007CKKOG6|5|Cute, very soft. Easy to use.
B00008MIHO|5|It worked really well. and all you would have to do is take off the pad and clean it dry it and put it right back on.  Love this
B0032BEFPK|4|Loved this carseat. But be careful washing it. It fell apart when I put it in the washing machine.
B007Q4EF7M|5|Great choice of nipples and work great.<br />So far extremely happy.  I would highly recommend fhese bottles, baby loves them
B001538VVG|5|Wife loves the bag. Got it for her for Xmas. Bag is very versatile gym bag. Everything you need. Very well thought through. Material is superb. Amazon saved my behind. Great, fast shipping.
B005XTCMSQ|1|doesn't fit my dacor stove
B005RCL6CW|5|This chair is AHH-mazing!  Love, love, love it.  It is like sitting on a cloud.  The cushions are ultra soft and plush and the fabric is divine.  I love that I will be able to take the covers off and wash them since I bought the ivory colored chair.  It has a super smooth gliding and swivel motion which I love.  At 5'3, this chair is the perfect height for me and I can comfortably rest my head on the back cushion as well.  But my husband, who is 6'1, has no complaints about snuggling in it with our toddler either.  Our 18 month old also loves to just climb up in it and sit and rock in it by herself too!  It works perfectly in my daughter's nursery and goes well with her other white/cream colored furniture.  I bought this chair for my daughter's room to replace the standard wooden glider/rocker that I used to nurse her as I need the old glider to nurse my new baby, but now I really want to buy another chair just like this one for the new baby since it is so comfy!!<br /><br />We also bought the matching ottoman and it matches perfectly - no issues with color or fabric like some other users mentioned.  My ONLY complaint is that the chair either needs to be taller or the ottoman shorter because when you sit in the chair, you sink down a bit, but there is no give to the ottoman and it actually elevates your feet so they're slightly higher than your bottom!  As I'm still pregnant right now, that is a very uncomfortable position for me so I can't use the ottoman right now.  My husband says it's awkward for him too.  Also, the ottoman doesn't glide as smoothly as the chair.  So any issues I have are actually with the ottoman, and not the chair.<br /><br />Additionally, both the chair and ottoman came more quickly than expected which was great.  They were both completely wrapped in plastic and packaged in very sturdy boxes.  The shipping company was easy to work with on delivery as well.
B0006IHTQE|4|The car seat does not have enough cushion, dont know if it is same on all the car seats available in the market. Also the head support is poor. Stroller is light and very smooth to stroll. nice subtle color and spacious (with the underneath basket). In total a very good buy.
B004RVI2DU|4|it doesn´t actually stop your baby from getting hot but it helps a lot compared to the one my stroller came with... nice breathable materials, good size, no compplaints so far...
B001GQ2RW6|5|This potty is just great.  We bought it because our son was having a lot of trouble with pee going over the front of our other potty and the child's toilet seat.  The high splash guard is perfect and the shape means that everything runs back into the potty and not down the sides as I have heard is a problem with some other high splash guard potties.  I would certainly reccomend this product.
B001OC5UNK|2|This gate has been annoying from the beginning.  The gate is either a normal gate width or 52 inches wide.  I expected this to be adjustable.  It is also very rickety.  If your child can pull up on things than they will be strong enough to shake the gate and eventually loosen it.  The walk thru feature is great I just would expect better quality and strength for something for the age range the gate gives.
B00BR0OMG0|5|Seriously a fantastic car seat.  Roomy, comfy, durable, and a good price.
B0000AHOYF|5|I got the britax roundabout used from ebay in the light colonial blue color, but it is basically the same. <BR>Mine is also a little older, made in 2001, so the buckle is the puzzle peice kind (its funny to watch people who have never used it before figure out how it works:). I love this carseat because the fabric is so soft, it's well cushioned, the belly pad and the velcro are wonderful, and unlike my son's booster seat, the straps rarely get tangled. It also has a great system to keep the seatbelt nice and tight and in the right place. My daughter loves this carseat, and that alone is worth the money. In this case, you definatly get what you pay for!!! Totally worth it!! (I am planning on buying a britax husky for my son too)
B000W8RRPG|5|So soft. We love it. My daughter can keep her feet inside or out because she is not too tall for it yet.
B0000479VK|2|The lazy susan cabinet lock installs easily and provides an external lock to keep your rotary cabinet from turning.  Note that to be able to lock the cabinet the lazy susan door is held between a plastic \\"backstop\\" and a front lever.  The backstop allows the lazy susan to open in only one direction, and (depending upon how it is installed), the backstop can block about two inches all the way around the circumference on the outside edge of the shelf.  I had to remove anything along the outer edge of the top shelf for the door to be able to open.  I installed this product on a lazy susan that is opened 5-10 times daily, and it lasted three months of careful usage before the lever snapped.<br /><br />Despite the drawbacks, rotary cabinets are a quick way to break a finger, and  I was not able to find another product that fit the need.  The safety first lock does the job, and I am buying another replacement until my 1 year old loses his obsession with the cabinet.
B000JVVXMO|5|This sling is just what we've been looking for and I wish we'd had it during the first 5 months. Unlike the big bath sponge we used earlier, this one is lightweight mesh fabric that lets the water and air pass through easily so it dries completely once you're done with no mildew smell to contend with.     The incline is great because you can pour water on the baby's tummy and there's less chance of it pooling around her chin or getting in her mouth. It also allows baby to see what you're doing. We fill a big bowl with water at her feet and dip water out of that to soap up the washcloth and rinse as needed. Since the sling is inclined, she can watch us do each step.    Also, since the Bath Sling folds into such a compact size, once it's dry between baths you can store it in a drawer, under the sink, or even take it in your suitcase for trips. It'd be nice if it were a smidge longer: we didn't get it until our baby was 5 months old and as we head for month seven, she's getting a little long for it, but we use it anyway and just let her legs extend a little more past the end.    If you're debating bath products, skip the sponge (hard to squeeze water out, bulky to store, especially when wet) and get this sling. You can us it from birth to at least 6 months or longer and by then, some babies can sit in the tub without help, so you can get a lot of use out of it.
B000G0KQWQ|5|One of the few true swaddle blankets...kept my daughter from &#34;breaking out&#34; and waking herself up with her arms.  Forget the ones with Velcro... the don't work.
B000056JKS|4|...it can go on and off the stroller in case the baby or toddler who just keeps knocking it off.  It's perfect for on the go moms or dads who don't want to stop every five minutes to reach their child a cup or bottle because the child can get it themselves.
B004HD9V92|5|Perfect size to use as an accent pillow on our toddler's bed.  She's in love with Buzz Lightyear, and most of the Toy Story sheets have other characters on them, so this is a great way to focus on the Buzz character.  She even cuddles with the pillow.  The added bonus - this pillow is machine washable and you can tumble dry!
B004IZWQYQ|5|Both my kids ( 3,5 years old and 1 year old ) LOVE this game . They play together everywhere - in the room, inside the bath (in water) ... So this game is great. But the small toy balls are easy to loose ... ( So I think this company has to provide some box for the balls or smth like this
B0088PWAWK|5|I got this for my toddler, he is a little big for it, but we recently moved to a place that has no bath tub and he is still a bit young for a shower. He loves taking a bath in it now. I have had no problems with any seams or leaking. It also shipped very, very quickly!
B00FBEN4JE|4|Works great, I just wish it was louder
B0038JE3R6|2|too small
B003YL3ERI|4|This was for my almost 5 month old baby to travel with. I needed it to recline and have 5 point harness- which it does nicely for a little baby ( I recommend using a body insert/head rest when they are little) It has a leg rest you can leave up and the baby is nearly supine.  I needed it to be easy to take in the airport- which it was.  It is easy for my husband to push and he is 6' 1\\". Your feet don't hit the wheels while walking. It has a glitch in folding- the side of the stroller fabric gets caught and you must put it in the right spot for it to fold. Once you figure this out it is easy to fold. I wish it had a large sun canopy like my large stroller (but what it does have you can place a blanket over it), and I wish it was easier to put in the trunk of my car- it is long and a bit awkward for the trunk (but easy in the airport). I wish you could use the storage bin when the seat is reclined - can only access it when the seat is sitting up. However, since it is the umbrella type and the lightweight type, I suppose the options are just different! The price was good- did not want to spend the same amount as I did on our large stroller.
B00KU1127Y|5|Very simple but excellent! No fancy features. Just plain, clear, sound with excellent range and absolutely no interference. Nothing else. The one thing that needs to be improved is that the sound is relatively low even at its highest volume. I also wish the parent unit had a recharchable battery (though you can use it with plain batteries as well as plugged in). But we are very happy with having purchased this model.<br />For those planning to take this baby call abroad I was pleased to realize that both power cords allow for 110-220V input so that no heavy transformers are needed.
B004ZGJEBG|5|I order the entire rock angel crib set including the mobile for our baby girl that's due in October. It arrived in a few days and i was like a kid on Christmas morning opening it. i must say it is even more adorable in person, and is made very well! the material is super soft, and the colors are more vivid than they are online! i am so happy with my purchase and me and my husband can't wait to set up her room. we had searched everyone for a baby room set that was more rock and roll style to match our style and all the ones we found had skulls on them( which are very cute) but i didn't want her to wake up to skulls every morning. LOL so this is perfect, and her bedroom set is black and even thought this bedding has a chocolate trim around the pink, it's such a dark chocolate that it still matches with the black crib set. everyone should get this, you will be very happy with it :D
B00F2MQ0K0|3|Not a big fan of the clipping system it has. Never fits into the seat. Would have liked it better without that.
B006JV4HKS|4|Everywhere we take this people ask us what it is and want to know where they can get one. We are frequent travelers so keep this in our car at all times. It's perfect  for use at restaurants to avoid those disgusting and dirty high hairs. Plus it has more back support than they do as well. It's very easy to use, fold up conveniently and compactly and seems comfy for baby. The material is wipe able, but if your child is a really messy eater you may find it challenging to clean. It works on most tables. We particularly like to use it in booths and put baby inside the booth rather than on the outer side of the table. I don't like food being passed over my baby's head or people knocking into her as they pass by.
B00016BPA2|5|Used this machine with 3 babies & now being used by my cousin for her baby. Awesome machine. Would buy again if needed but I don't.
B00ED2TH00|5|The ties in back make this bulky and this bra is not appropriate to really wear on a day to day basis but if just used when pumping, it is great.  I set the ties, zip it up, and go.  Can't beat the price.
B000056JND|2|I have been bottle feeding my son since he was born using the Avent bottles.  After 6 weeks of constant leaks with these bottles, my husband and I had enough.  The formula would soak my son during feedings and when we made the bottles we would lose half of the formula in the sink. We tried everything...putting the bottles together when wet, resealing them, different heating methods, ect.  NOTHING worked.  The nipples also seemed too large for my sons mouth.  I would not recommend these bottles.  We switched to the Dr. Brown's bottles which were well worth the money.
B000AV5LZ8|5|Best to use with kids go to bathroom alone
B00913DY3W|2|I had high hopes for this, but have to agree with another poster– the size and shape of this teether is weird and the configuration of the little spokes makes it hard for our little one, now 10 months old, to get one in her mouth without jabbing herself in the cheek or sticking one up her nose. She gets equally frustrated and bored by it. Love Comotomo's bottles, but this is a fail for us.
B00P9WCOLW|5|I absolutely love this shirt.  It works great for nursing my child, as well as for carrying him while walking my dog.  I Highly recommend D this product to others!
B00L2FPBXS|5|Good quality and they really help my little teether.<br />will buy again!  A perfect baby shower gift.
B00A6GIHS0|5|I decided to go 100% cloth diapering after discovering the hidden chemicals found in all disposables, even in Seventh Generation.  I still use disposables on long road trips and for grandparents, but these wet bags are perfect for everyday use.  I got two big ones for daycare and a medium bag for short trips.  I just toss the diapers, flip the bag inside out and wash everything in one load.  Then I pop everything in the dryer.  Save Money, protect your baby's delicate skin and the Environment at the same time.
B00DFAJJNG|5|This bed was everything I respected it to be! Absolutely a gorgeous piece of furniture!
B001UZAFOK|5|This works as a good replacement for the adapter that comes with this, as the old adapter died. This one looks slightly different, but I would guess it is a more heavy duty replacement.
B003XMWFB4|1|This didn't even last one whole run when I put it on my daughter's jogging stroller.  It swivels and dumps my drink out, and after about 20 minutes I ended up just keeping my drink in the seat with my daughter and tossed this out.
B00CSAWINW|5|Good
B006G94D3O|5|I rarely write reviews, but this mattress is awesome. Soft yet still supportive and safe. My son is picky about his sleeping surface and will not sleep if he isn't comfortable. He sleeps great on the infant side now, and I'm sure he'll do well on the toddler side too. I would definitely purchase again!
B00BEVSSDU|5|ok
B007KZUMYC|1|Another dummy here, did not read the review and was perplexed to receive only one clip. It's a cute clip, but not worth the price. I would've bought a different product if I had known that there's only one clip.
B00GY8J8IC|5|We bought this stroller to use on a vacation and it was perfect. It reclines enough for baby to sleep, has a great canopy, folds/unfolds easily and is very light. I bought two other umbrella strollers on amazon and returned them before i got this one and could not be happier with how this one worked for us. It served us well in Napa Valley for a week and will be put to use again when we fly to New York this fall. Excellent stroller.
B00HZO5S4M|5|Made of flexible but sturdy soft plastic, super easy to clean, don't have to worry about rusting. Love the bold colors. Just started using them. Haven't used the white feature yet..washing in lukewarm water doesn't activate the white.
B004X8GJPA|5|Matches the kalencom potty and fits perfectly. I don't have to worry about leaking and sometimes there are some bags that does, i just double it but the pad in the middle helps stop the leaking too
B00AR2B5X2|5|Fast shipping and great product!!!
B000GK5XY2|5|These mesh teethers are absolutely perfection for small grabby hands. They were a hit with my son, and now my daughter loves them just as much!
B008B33Z0A|5|These are great. exceeded my expecation and looks really lovely on my daughter's crib.  They came much faster than it said it would.
B0099G0HH2|2|Not as large as expected  - can't really fit even juice boxes in the top section and the zipper is tough to move. Disapointing.
B005IV0CRM|5|Love it so much,I think little kid usually will fall in love with it
B004G8QSYO|5|Our 5 month old loves these and I can see how they'll be great as he gets bigger. 2 of the blocks are crinkly and 2 have rattles in them which he loves.  They also have various tags and textures that our baby loves pulling on and playing with.  I think for the price these are great and we'll get even more use from them as he sits up better.
B008J7DA26|5|love it like crazy!!  ordered it to bib for my daughter, but now her cousin can wear it first.  easy for her to dress self too!
B003I867US|4|Life and back saver.
B000GCE5C6|5|I have been using this for many months now and my 17 month old daughter still loves it.  We use a regular toothbrush for in the morning and then we use this finger one when its bath time.  She has always enjoyed brushing her teeth with the finger cleaner.  I think it feels really good on her gums and it gets her teeth clean too.  The toothpaste seems to taste good because she always looks forward to using it.  It has a really nice smell.  It is very convenient for bath time and I would recommend it to others.
B006PB2B6O|5|The seat works great and is easy to put our grandson into it.  Better still, is my grandson doesn't mind going into this car seat!
B004GEC8LU|5|We needed extra chairs for my husband's truck that he could easily take in and out. These are so light and durable and easy to clean. I have two boys and they're not easy on these things. they love the slide out cup holders and i love that it's so easy to clean. great seats.
B0053Y2B6E|5|My daughter registered for this diaper pail and it looks good and sturdy.  I'm sure she will find it very convenient to use.
B006YBHE6M|5|excellent
B000COY136|3|I bought those because my 2 month old spits up left and right. They are just fine and they do their job leaving my baby's clothes dry(as opposed to Ikea's bibs).<br /><br />That said you have to realize that they have plastic inside them. My husband put our baby to sleep wearing one of those. Good thing I was around because it clung into her mouth scaring both her and me.<br /><br />It is not the product's fault-just don't leave your baby unsupervised or put her to sleep wearing one of those.
B000UX6VQE|5|These are the most comfortable nursing pads I've tried!  I bought a box of them from Target when I was pregnant, after reading some reviews.  I didn't realize how great they were until I ran out and tried other brands because Target stopped carrying them.  Ameda were too small, Medela too scratchy, and the organic cotton washables soaked through.  These are great!!!  They are round and fit right into my bra, they don't scratch and they aren't bulky.  You can't see them through your shirt which is a bonus, and they are absorbent!  I highly recommend them!
B0007NC7K6|1|I wish I could say good things about this backpack. The child part is very nice, the baby rides very comfortably.  But the weight distribution for me to carry it is all wrong. If it was just me who had a problem with carrying it I'd say its because I'm short but my brother who is 6 foot also had a problem. With it 3 minutes of putting the pack on we both had shoulder pain. I readjusted the pack so the back support hit very low and the pain lessened but then if I didn't lean forward I felt like it was pulling me over backwards. 14 years ago I had a CHEAP one (about $25.00) and never had these problems. I even used it once with this baby but the fabric that supported the baby ripped.
B0026O7718|5|el producto llego rápido al destino, excelente servicio; agradecido buena puntuación,  sin mas que decir y una prointa nueva compra
B001PQUL5W|5|I purchased this when I purchased the Burlington Baby Moses Basket with Interchangeable Ribbons. It assembles very easily, and I was impressed with the quality considering it's price. With animals in the house, it's nice to have a secure place for the basket off the floor. The rockers are a nice addition. The hoop that the basket fits into is a little large for the basket I purchased, and there was no way to decrease the size, but it is designed to accommodate a variety of sizes.
B002UD65S6|2|Too small, it still fits but it shrinks the mat and causes the mat to fold down on itself. When forced into deposition in creates a bump on the center on the mat. I have a Graco play pen if that matters.
B001FCM24E|5|we got this carrier for our travel needs and it's perfect! It's very easy to operate, great for airports, in the city and even outdoors. We use it with our MaxiCosi carseat.
B00OLRJYJG|5|My 3 year old was so happy to graduate to the big girl seat.  This is very room and still very secure.  She can sit cross-legged without issues.  The built-in cup holders are awesome.  She loves it and we are very satisfied with the purchase.
B0052QYLUM|5|I have owned a set of Infant Optics DXR-5 for over a year now and have been happy with both the monitor and the camera.  The price was decent and it had good reviews.  The camera works really well, including when the room is dark.  We bought an extra add-on camera for another room.  They are easy to mount and/or move around where needed.  The monitor is convenient with a tab on the back that can be a clip or a stand.  Works just fine for shorter naps up to about an hour an a half, then you'll need to charge it up.  Haven't had any problems until recently when my antenna broke off, but the manufacturer's customer service has been helpful in assisting me with the issue.
B00SYGQERA|5|Wonderful! I feel like it's so much safer and stops our kids from slouching in it when they're sleeping. And from what I've read slouching will make the car seat not effective. Now they just rest their heads on the top parts that extend from the car seat by their head. I've also done a lot of research and this product seems very safe. The thing that hold the seatbelt in place in the middle is also great. Highly recommend!
B00HG696E2|2|Just as another reviewer mentioned, the sleeper I received had teeny arm holes! I had to pull out the seam ripper & repair them in order for my baby to wear it.
B001IACJQ4|5|I was researching for the perfect glider and ottoman that suits our budget and came across this one. We tried a lot of gliders at Babies 'R Us similar to this one and all of them are at least $300 and honestly, they're not as cushion-y and as comfortable as this one. The style and color are very nice and simple. Definitely will recommend this to anyone who wants to buy a simple, nice, and affordable glider and ottoman.
B0050GD29U|5|I'm a new mom and we love this car seat!!!!! Initially had an even flow travel system and my kid outgrew it quickly. This seems a lot more secure for my LO.
B00DJBU7FU|4|the colors are vibrant. the quantity is a great deal for the price.  The packaging was shrink wrapped together which bent one of the cardboard packages. a little uncomfortable giving it bent as a gift.
B002GOQX4U|5|came in handy when the washing machine broke down.  good quality and attractive you can just use a wipe on it, so convenient. mine was from target so it was inexpensive because it was on sale.  looks new after 6 months
B00AN8S07Y|2|The valve located in the bottom is broken and the water flows all the time while the bath
B007NG5UEU|5|Love these and they are well worth the money! We have used them for a year now and they have never failed! I can even walk into my back yard- about 100 yrds and still hear the device!
B00NSCGFU6|4|The fabric is scratchy but is softening up with washing.  The design of the pattern is a little odd since all the firetrucks are on the edges of the sheet so you can't really see them when the mattress is in the bed.
B00XAWQN9W|5|I used them as soon as they were delivered. Easy to install and work great to keep the sun from beaming on my little guy.
B002G9USHI|5|My son was given one of these at his arrival, and it has been a favorite ever since. I ordered 2 extra bunnies so we will have no tears if one is ever lost. I have washed the bunny blanket numerous times and it comes up white and fluffy each wash. It really is a comfort for our son when he goes to bed or travels. It's a great product and I have no hesitations in recommending it or the provider.
B00DJP12YQ|4|I purchased this after months of trying to figure out which one I preferred between this one and a graco with really good reviews.  I was able to personally feel of both in Baby's R us, and I must say that this chicco is MUCH softer than the others.  The little white/gray newborn insert that you take out when the baby is bigger is what is providing the extra cushion.  If you lift that up, it's just like the rest.  This one apparently has awesome crash ratings though, thank God I can't vouch for that.<br /><br />Pros: Softer than the rest<br />Pretty<br />Base allows for recline and upright positioning (no major recline, but still nice)<br />Fairly easy to operate once you figure out what all the buttons do<br />Cool compartment to keep user guide in the bottom of base<br />Nifty push button release buckles for the car's internal hooks (no more blindly trying to hook a loop you can't see, just push it in like a seat belt buckle and push a button to release)<br />Easy assembly<br />Stroller is fairly light weight and easily collapsable with gentle push of buttons<br />Stroller is more compact ( I hated dealing with a big bulky stroller)<br />Can't attest for baby likability yet (she's not born yet)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Once you take out the newborn insert, the car seat becomes just as hard as all the others.<br />Lots of buttons to figure out (reading the manual a few times helps)<br />It's so easy to collapse the stroller, with a gentle push of a button, I'm afraid I may tear it up eventually.  ALL of my other strollers I had to fight with the clasps and releases to get them to snap/release; hopefully it'll hold up.<br />Will update list after baby is born, if there are more cons.
B000TBK4RY|5|This things is the closest I have found to the original bath tub ring for bathing a baby. Not sure why they no longer sell them.  It was difficult to find this . You can be totally hands free so you can play.  We have a ball now. It was a little pricey but so worth it.  I would recommend highly
B000LXQVA4|5|[[VIDEOID:ada8f3224bd5fdc2596c73362ecc788d]]My 4-month-old has a blast in it!
B002SW3EZG|5|My daughter likes to help daddy in the workshop and it can get a little noisey at times. She got these for her birthday and now I can feel comfortable with her playing while I'm working on things.<br /><br />My daughter is 24 months old, they fit and should for some time to come.
B000RFBW00|2|I got this for my bottles when I stopped nursing during the day.  This looked nice, and easy to use.  But, once I put my bottles on it, all the hinges that held all the spikes up just crashed down, causing my glass bottles to go crashing to the ground.  I am sure it would work great for plastic bottles.  But, the glass ones are just way to heavy.
B00ASI748A|5|very nice and convinient
B000YDDF6O|4|The product it is ok.
B00767GHX4|3|Good bib.  I paid $11 for it, but wouldn't pay more.  Wipes easily and sometimes catches things.  There are better products out there for much less money.
B003LQORA4|5|great
B007CTPWXW|5|I love my britax stroller and this organizer completes it. It fits perfectly and holds a lot of stuff. Very satisfied with purchase.
B003TJ9P3W|5|Great for a pre-schooler. I thought I might could use this as a diaper bag but it's not big enough (strap wise) to work for that. But is is the perfect size for my toddler to wear. So yay!
B00KCNIIHM|5|This is my 7 week old baby's favorite pacifier.  He only likes these! Highly recommended.
B0033B9CZ2|5|These have worked great!!!! So nice too cuz they were affordable!
B002TOKHJE|5|My kids like playing with them in a tub. Though it's hard to get the water in, my toddler likes to squirt.
B000CNOIQ2|5|Love it!!
B00RDT3UYO|5|This is the best baby monitor. I tried quite a few and returned them all. I really wanted a video one, but could never hear or rely on them. This one has a long battery life, and amazing range. The best part is you can crank the sound up really high to hear every breath of your little one if you want to. I also use it when my parents watch her because they are hard of hearing and with the others, she would cry for a long time before they would notice. They would have to make an effort to go pick it up and listen, not safe at all. This one I don't even have to turn up all the way and it will wake them from a dead sleep. I just bought a second one to put by the pool their second house in Florida. So if there are any sounds by the pool, we can hear it inside as an extra safety precaution. I've never used the second receiver, but wish they sold one with two transmitters. I may just buy a second one to keep one by the pool and one in her room.
B0091E31KM|5|Works great, helps drown out the trains at night so my 3 year old can sleep.
B00O5F2G8K|5|Works well. Instructions. Are ok .
B004G81SUS|2|I bought this high chair b/c I was irritated that the one I have has a pop-off tray insert, but it doesn't cover the entire lower tray, so I often (at least once a day) end up washing both trays--yes in the sink getting water everywhere, because I only run my dishwasher once a day and feed my boy 3x in the high chair.  So I loved the concept but guess what?!  The \\"lip\\" that covers the bottom tray is too small--leaving the sides exposed.  Better than the other one, but especially on the baby-facing side you could still get gunk on the lower tray and have to wash both!  Aarrgghh!  Why didn't they just make the lip bigger??!!  Also, I was so excited for an EZ clean experience that I ignored prior reviews about baby size and listened to the reviews I wanted to hear.  It was clear that my boy was not comfortable as there is a very short space between the bar that comes between their legs and the back of the chair.  Again, why??  Granted my guy was 15 mo. ~24 lbs. when I tried this so maybe for a little baby would be fine--but you'd have to get another one later on.  If they fixed these problems it would be great...come on FP, I'm still looking!
B0014J0W8G|3|locks
B00168EB6Y|5|I bought these to spell our daughters name on her wall above a bunch of butterflies we also put on her wall, we like thmn and they work, I am happy with them. and we did stick them on fresh new paint, and they are still sticking to the wall and it has been about 2 months now.
B002PXSX0Y|5|Taking into account its low price, this works perfectly.  An ideal fit with My First Years Ignite stroller.  Great for the Pacific NW winters.
B001HKPHYQ|2|I bought this for my son for Christmas so I ordered it a few weeks prior to ensure timely delivery.  At the beginning of February, it died.  Just quit working.  My son wanted me to get a new one but since the window in which I could return this had lapsed, I would have to pay for the shipping (to and from the factory) to get it fixed.  Well, I paid $20 for the item.  It would cost $18 for shipping.  I dumped it in the trash and told him I would trade him 10 Matchbox cars for it.  I do not recommend buying this item mail order for obvious reasons.
B00CLAZLN8|5|I love that it has a waterproof lining on one side you so don't have to worry about laying it on wet grass or sand. The other side is really soft. It's pretty large too, giving us plenty of room.
B002OU6OV8|5|All of the pad covers are around 20 buck but this one.  It is soft and because of the green frogs and blue dragon flys it works great for a boy or girl.
B00CHZ7LI0|3|I bought this for a newborn, so I am reviewing based on that.  The shower concept was cool, but in theory only.  Filling the bucket up which is flimsy and smelly (strong plastic, shower handle does not fit in base and lid wont stay on bucket) was a pain in the arse.<br />Would have been better off buying a tub like this without the shower part.  We threw it in the trash.<br /><br />The rest is okay.  The cover is difficult to fit onto the slanted base.  But once on, is nice to use for bath time.<br /><br />The tub is not even needed either unless just for safety at this point.<br /><br />Please not that this does not fit in standard size kitchen sinks either.
B0043IS18I|1|Buyer BEWARE!!!!! Yes, the fan worked great. But, my 10-month-old baby pulled the foam blades off with very little effort :(
B0026R445M|1|I had to return this night light; it didn't give off any light and there were some spots without coloring. Not a good quality product!
B002SW3B40|5|There is no comparison: These are the best blankets out there.<br /><br />Definitely buy THESE specific blankets (boutique, size 47x47) - they are much better quality and are bigger than the ones you buy in box stores.<br /><br />We have 6 of these, use them EVERY day, and I wish I had more!
