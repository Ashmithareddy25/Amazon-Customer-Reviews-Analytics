B00005RFAI|5.0|i have heard almost every song by pink since her first album dropped. but i think this one is the bomb.<BR>pink sticks to whatever she says and does and people should listen to her music instead of picking parts out of her lyrics and critices them...but hey listen to the lyrics and the beats and open up your mind..<BR>(i am from germany, so please forgive any words spelled wrong ;-)
B00003CX5P|4.0|...For every Star Wars fan that enjoyed The Phantom Menace, there'll be at least another ten or twenty 'old school' Star Wars fans that will, quite venomously, tell you the film had nothing to do with the spirit of Star Wars...Anyone of said 'old school', will never admit to even liking it, even if they yelped with excitement as Kenobi and Maul blew away the originals in a lightsaber clash that has to be seen to be believed. Okay, about the only person that didn't know that topping the original trilogy was an impossible task was Lucas himself but even saying that, what were his remaining options? There was a story to be told here. No one is under any illusions that Episode One's archilles heel was the storyline. Cramming so much past historical history into one film must have seemed as daunting a task to Lucas as Skywalker attempting to lift the X wing from the Dagobah swamp. So what of the pacing? Unfortunately, both are one and the same. If a story is disjointed, then the pacing and structure must also suffer as a result. Performances? No actor is reluctant to stress that when starring in a Star Wars film, you learn a type of Jedi frown, and that's about it (though singular and pleasantly surprising praise must be handed to an electric Ewan McGregor who's devotion to lightsabering is an exercise in unrestraint). Last saving grace? Action, special effects and set pieces, and it's here The Phantom Menace truly delivers. The velocity of the Tatooine pod race has never been seen in the history of cinema, bar none. The opening sequence sets the tone (let no one tell you that when they saw those two twin saber beams appear in the mist on the Droid Control Ship, that wasn't the true spirit of Star Wars) and the climatic three way lightsaber battle wraps up the first prequel in spectacular fashion. All in all, a flawed but highly entertaining chapter that is no where near as good as it should have been and no where near as bad as people will lead you to believe. Go on, goback and replay chapter 41 to close and tell me that single shot of the containment beams opening, allowing Kenobi and Maul to swedge for each other for all they're worth isn't simply magical...
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool released their best album yet with 2001's Lateralus. They were already on the 'art rock' trail with AEnima, porbably the best metal album of the 1990s, and they totally dove headfirst into it on this album. The music is still heavy and unique, the lyrics still acerbic, but the vocals on this album have improved (partly due to Maynard in A Perfect Circle). Maynard's vocal harmonies have improved and his screams became more primal. His voice was always great but it took a turn for the better in the last few years. <BR><BR>My favorite song is &quot;The Patient.&quot; The 5/4 time signature with a guitar line that makes you suspicious and vocals that are haunting and beautiful. Other epics include the title song, the great yet overplayed &quot;Schism&quot; and &quot;Parabol/Parabola.&quot; I even like the guitar based &quot;Eon Blue Apocalypse,&quot; and the odd segue &quot;Mantra,&quot; which was reminiscent of one of the many segues on AEnima. <BR><BR>And Tool even wrote a TRILOGY for this album, something usually unheard of for a newer metal band. The 24-minute trilogy first starts with the mellow and very sad &quot;Disposition.&quot; A song with only three lines &quot;Mention this to me/ Mention something, mention anything.../Watch the weather change&quot;), and it needs no more. The percussion, the high octave bass line, Maynard's vocals and of course Adam Jones' resonant guitar tones make it an emotional high point and symbolically represents 'weather clearing' after the 9-minute rage induced title track that came before it. &quot;Reflection&quot; is 11 minutes of a juxtaposition of heavy and mellow. It may not be as loud as a lot of their songs, but it doesn't need volume to be effective at all. The two sides clash together, waiting to explode, and it does with &quot;Triad,&quot; the closing song, followed by &quot;Faaip De Oiad&quot; an unrelated track about something at Area 51 (the place where UFOs were spotted). So far, no metal release has topped this one when it comes to the 21st century. Let's hope Tool can keep on going and let's hope that they release great more records. This album can either be a spectacular finale to a great career, or a sign of new and better things to come. This one's gonna be hard to top though.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie has the ability to physically affect people, more than any other movie I've ever seen. Aronofsky uses many of the same cinematography tricks as he uses in his debut film Pi to make the movie excitingly explicit. When hearing other people's feelings about the movie they are at the two extremes, loved it or hated it. This is not a hollywood film. It is not designed with elements to appeal to everyone. This movie is quality direction with quality acting. Burstyn gives an unbelievable performance, but the rest of the cast is no sloutch either. Leto, Connelly, and Waynes (In an atypical role) give great performances as well. Aronofsky's great direction lets the movie move like a book, full of sybolism and imagery thats makes the story even more outstanding. Whether you like the movie or not you will be glad you saw it.
B00006AFUR|5.0|30STM is exactly what I was waiting for! They are brilliant as well as amazingly talented.  The album which I love and listen to every day, every chance I get seems to touch me more and more each time I listen to it. This CD contains 11 wonderful songs as well as concert footage and the Capricorn Video.  I have not listend to anything else since I bought it! JARED LETO has an amazing voice and songwriting ability he is a great performer and actor as seen in many of my favorite movies as in Requium for a Dream and many more.  Each time i listen to the CD it blows me away. This band has had a huge impact on me.  IF there is any album you should buy it is this one!  They are changing the music industry.
B000069HKH|5.0|For those of us who experienced that September day either first hand at ground zero or (as most of us did)in utter awe in the safety of our living rooms, words and phrases have been bandied about yet none seem to capture the essemce, the tragedy, of the moment. Only a handful of artists are capable of expressing these emotions in words and music without being trite or syrupy. Bruce, the poet and musician, has taken us into the minds and souls of those who lived it, survived it, and, yes, didn't survive it. <br />His words are carefully chosen capturing the remorse and emptiness felt by those whose loved ones perished. His melodies confirm this sense of remorse but also give way to hope and belief that good too will come. <br />This is truly a remarkable record from the opening notes to the final chorus. I find myself having an even greater respect for the man after listening to this volume. No one else could have reached down and pull a flower from the ash. More than anything, his message is one of comfort, faith, and hope. It is truly a message for our time.
B000003S2K|5.0|A friend of mine had this in 1987, and I *finally* got my own copy this year. <BR>Usually I associate a particular season with an album or music type (i.e. zydeco for summer's beginning, singer/songwriter with acoustic guitar for early autumn, R&amp;B for spring, techno for winter, etc.) but this album fits into any season. As long as it's twilight. <BR>It's frozen winter midnight, rainy autumn dawn, drowsy summer evening, wistful spring afternoon. It makes you feel less horrible when you're heartbroken. It smoothes down the hackles of your aggravation. Instead of harshly imposing its own mood (as a lot of music does) it draws out your own feelings of calm. I'm a therapist, and I play it in my office.<BR>I don't think electronic music has ever really been able to improve on Eno, as much as the technology has advanced.
B000000W5B|5.0|Goat's Head Soup was originally released Aug 31, 1973 and went to #1 in both the US and the UK.  I have found it quite rewarding that over the years this one has gained respect and continues to appear in many rankings of greatest rock albums.  Personally, I've always like this one a lot.  It's got the usual megahits; Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker), Angie, and Star#$!@% (a hit as a single in Europe and Japan), an incredible jam in Can You Hear The Music, great intro in 100 Years Ago, part 2 of the voodoo chronicles in Dancing With Mr. D., solid rocker Silver Train, and oh yeah, Winter and Hide Your Love too.  Most people know the music, so in my reviews I try to give you data on the sessions and interesting facts connected with the songs and the album.  Here we go:<br />There were 23 songs recorded during the Goat's Head Soup sessions between Nov 25-30 and Dec 6-21, 1972 at Dynamic Sound Studios in Kingston, Jamaica.  Only 8 of them made it onto Goat's Head Soup.  Keith had made strong connections with the Jamaican reggae musicians and had recently bought a house in Jamaica, so he was the driving force behind the sessions.  The band included Mick Taylor, Nicky Hopkins (piano), Billy Preston (organ), Bobby Keys (sax), Chuck Finley (trumpet), Jim Horn (horn), and of course Ian Stewart on piano.  Sonny Rollins played sax on Waiting On A Friend.  Final mixes were done at Island Recording in London May 28 - Jun 20, 1973.  Hide Your Love was recorded in separate sessions on May 23 & 26 at Olympic Studios in London.  Silver Train was recorded during the mixing at Island in London.<br />Interesting notes include:<BR>.....The UK version of the album had one verse censored and deleted from Star#$!@% (which appears as Star Star in text on the album) while the US version had the line \\"I bet you keep your pussy clean\\" deleted.  Both record distributors (US and UK) refused to allow the line \\"giving head to Steve McQueen\\" until the Stones got McQueen to sign a release (he saidhe appreciated the publicity).  (The entire song with all the censored lyrics are on this release, or at least they are on my copy.)<BR>.....Short And Curlies was not released until 1974 on the album It's Only Rock `n' Roll.<BR>.....Tops and Waiting On A Friend were not released until 1981 on the album Tattoo You, after which Waiting On A Friend was also released as a single.<BR>.....there are still 12 tracks from these sessions that have not been released (although some have been bootlegged)  They are Criss Cross (Save Me), Separately, You Should Have Seen Her Ass, Four And In, Give Us A Break, First Thing, Miami, Man-Eating Woman, Brown Leaves, After Muddy & Charlie, Jamaica I, and Zabadoo.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Going to try to keep it short. My sister recommmed this movie to me. I went in blind, not knowing anything, coming out totally loving it. The first 10 minutes got in hooked. It was so amazing, I had to see it again with comentary because I just had to see/hear what Richard Kelly was thinking when he shot certain scenes. I couldn't stop talking about at work. My bf loved it but couldn't tell his coworkers cause, well, to be honest, they'd think he was weird, or think of me weird for finding intrest in such a movie. I hope you love it. One more thing, the 6 foot bunny. If you ever saw that standing in your path, you would pee your pants...I know I would.
B000000W5A|3.0|Exile On Main Street was originally released May 12, 1972.  Numerous polls of greatest rock albums rank it in the top 15 of all time, but I've never been able to see what everybody is so excited about.

B00006FXB6|5.0|It all started with Kyuss, but the legend lives on through Queens of the Stone Age. This is by far one of the best albums of the year and it definitely an amazing follow-up to Rated R. Queens of the Stone Age have defined the term &quot;stoner rock&quot; and haven't strayed away from what they are good at. In a land of boy bands and so called punk rockers, Queens of the Stone Age stand high above the rest. So this is just a little thanks to QOTSA for not following down the path that some many others have already gone. If you don't own thier album then you don't know what it is to really love music.
0807208523|5.0|I have an old recording of EB White reading \\"Charlotte's Web\\".  I am very excited that they have reissued it as a CD, so now I can hear it again.  He has such a wonderful voice.  It really adds to the appreciation of one of the best children's books ever written.
B00005YW4H|3.0|I recently recieved this c.d. as a gift. It was just what I needed. I have been going thru a bit of a blue period and Norah's voice was very soothing.  It isn't over dramatic, in fact a lot of the music does sound similar. But there is a nice feeling to it. I really enjoy the title track, and after listening to this cd in my car all week I can honestly say everyone should own it. I felt so mellow that I couldn't help but be a kind driver. :) I found this cd to be comforting and just what I needed.
B0000033TE|5.0|The dynamically musical trio of Keith Emerson, Greg Lake & Carl Palmer have released some spectacularly crafted albums throughout their career (\\"Tarkus\\", \\"Trilogy\\", \\"Pictures At An Exhibition\\", etc.), but none can match the charismatic and artistic prowess of \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\". The album kicks off with the anthemic \\"Jerusalem\\", with a melody similarly akin to \\"God Save The Queen\\" (the British national anthem, for those who don't know). \\"Toccata\\" features a barrage of musical variances which range from racey orchestral showings to stomping percussive fireworks (courtesy of Emerson and Palmer), with plenty of artistic hooks to keep even the most casual ELP fan entertained for hours on end. \\"Still...You Turn Me On\\" is a lovely \\"ballad\\" written by Lake, which contains many wonderful indecisive qualities, as candidly expressed in the lyrics. \\"Benny The Bouncer\\" is extremely witty and comical in its own sordid, nonsensical way, and features lyrics by Pete Sinfield. This track is authenticated by Greg Lake's \\"half-drunken\\" vocal delivery, which gives it the perfect touch. It awkwardly leads its way into the masterful \\"Karn Evil #9 Suite\\", with the high water mark being the \\"1st Impression Part 2\\" section (also affectionately known as \\"Welcome Back, My Friends\\"). The other highlight of the \\"KE#9 Suite\\" is its \\"2nd Impression\\", and features yet another unique musical side of this awesome trio (and you thought ELP didn't do jazz, huh?). The entire \\"Karn Evil #9 Suite\\" is worth its weight in gold, and is THE main reason for the existence of \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\". The interview of the three band members (including Pete Sinfield, whose few lyrical contributions made great noticeable strides here) provides an insightful look into the \\"surgery\\" of this edible, tasty \\"salad\\", which was prepared with the kind of care that only Emerson, Lake & Palmer are capable of mastering. The plastic hologram cover of this special edition of \\"BSS\\" really makes H.R. Giger's cover artwork on the CD's front booklet come to life! So, by all means, come inside, come inside and see the show! ELP has a sight that'll make you drool!e CD's front booklet come to life! So, by all means, come inside, come inside and see the show!

6304913176|1.0|I normally expect differences between the book and the movie.  In this case I loved the book and hated the movie; I hope someone redoes the movie right some day.<br />The book was written with thought, and included the well thought-out technical idea of powered armor, as well as whole, realistic different social and political systems.  You watch Johnny Rico learning and growing, and read much thought-provoking commentary about the nature of social and political systems.  Training is made tough for a good reason, but is never brutal.  Questions (even stupid ones) are answered; at the worst the instructor looks disgusted, students are given an essay assignment to force them to think the problem through and find their own answer, or given pushups or a long run.  In action, troopers were given armor, smart (some nuclear) missiles, flamers, Bug-specific nerve gas and well-defined, sensible objectives when going up against the Bugs.  They were as well taken care of as possible.<br />In the movie, they lifted some names from the novel and tossed most everything else.  The powered armor is completely missing.  The social and political thought is completely missing.  The movie is full of gratuitous violence, nudity and stupidity of the high command.  A trooper asks a reasonable question during training, so an instructor throws a knife to pin his hand to the wall.  Does anyone think that'll encourage troopers to think and ask questions?  Does anyone think this was good training?  This was stupid, gratuitous brutality.  Troopers are sent up against Bugs while wearing fatigues (in other words, practically naked) with inadequate rifles; it took 10..30 seconds of full automatic fire to kill one Bug.  Again stupid and unnecessary; we have better weapons than that today.<br />Skip the movie, read the book.
0140149295|1.0|This book is a complete distortion of the truth behind the real story of Mr. Carter.<br />The story is told from the side of an angry convict who was constantly in trouble with the law because he was a sociopath who projects his responsibility for his failures on society and the law.<br />Many of his claims are bendings of the truth of what had actually happened to him.  For example, he was NOT 11 when he first went to juvenile school for stabbing a pedophile.  The real story was that he was 14 and mugged an old man for $55 and his gold watch.<br />I have an original copy of the boxing match between him and Joey Giardello.  Giardello was an excellent fighter who was in fact, unable to knock out Carter, but Carter wasn't even close to having the skills of Giardello.  The only rounds that Carter won were the first 5 out of all 15 rounds fought.<br />At the time of his first conviction, he was not the #1 contender.  He had in fact lost 7 of his last 15 fights which occurred after the loss to Giardello.<br />He was also not an activist; there isn't any evidence to support his claims on that.  Also, if he was an activist, why wasn't there any mention of it or any audio/video of it in The Hurricane starring Denzel Washington?...<br />Denzel Washington once said, \\"This man is love\\", in reference to Mr. Carter.  If Rubin Carter is \\"love\\", then why did he and the Canadians and Lazarus, who dedicated several years of their lives to freeing him, sit in separate rows and never spoke one word to each other at the premiere of The Hurricane?  Look at the website's truth before you make a judgement.<br />Peace
B0000399WI|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is an emotional bomb.  Filled with love, hate, sorrow, and happiness, all viewers will be emotionally drained.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman play a dynamic duo.  The friendship and love created by these characters will cause tears to come to your eyes.  The Shawshank Redemption takes place in federal prison.  Tim Robbins plays Andy, a banker, who tells his story about his time in prison and his escape.  Andy is a character who is loved by all.  His achievements in prison out weigh those of persons in the free world.  Andy hurdles many obstacles in prison but always seems to be heroic in actions.  He helps a mate get his GED, he helps the warden launder money, and most of all he helps other prisoners find what makes them special.  A heart warming film, The Shawshank Redemption receives two thumbs up.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Once again another repackaging of Elvis songs. But what a package it is! Once again Elvis manages to leave the competition in the dust! Even if these songs are as familiar as the nose on your face, or if you are hearing them for the first time. These remastered versions of these great recordings are spectacular! But I am hesitant to give too much credit to the technical wizards of the 21st century who are bragging about the incredible sound they have been able to achieve here. Let's give credit where credit is due. Remember some of these recordings are 25 to nearly 50 years old. Mono recordings such as HEARTBREAK HOTEL &amp; DON'T BE CRUEL, as well as early stereo recordings such as STUCK ON YOU &amp; ARE YOU LONESOME TONIGHT? sound as fresh and vibrant as if Elvis was sing them in your own living room. So let's not forget what those great engineers and musicians who recorded these timeless tracks achieved all those years ago. Lets face it. If the source was'nt what it was, we would'nt be here today discusing it. I have heard other so called &quot;remastered recordings&quot; from alot of other artists and they don't compare. So who's the genius here? Well that's simple. Elvis was. He did not have a record producer.(such as the briliant George Martin who guided the Beatles) Elvis was the driving force behind all the recording sessions pretty much right from the start. Even in listening to early alternate takes of these songs you can hear an incredible sence of direction which comes from the source, Elvis himself. Subsiquent takes just draw out the best from the great musicians around him and create a sound that is still as fresh, revolutionary, and unmatched in popular music history. All the worldwide #1 Elvis songs are here. 31 to be exact. Including the recent remix of A LITTLE LESS CONVERSATION which reached #1 around the world this year, and only goes to prove my point. Without the great source material there is nothing to remix! This is a great collection of songs which takes us on a musical journey through the most influential time in musical history, with the most influential artist in musical history. This can no longer be debated. John Lennon once said...&quot;Before Elvis there was nothing&quot;. So now 25 years after Elvis.....well, there is still Elvis. So grab your favorite beverage, sit down, turn it up, and enjoy 31 of the greatest songs ever recorded.

B000001FZK|5.0|i can never decide if i like this one better than 'spirit of eden.'  but, what a decision to make!  'laughing stock' gets better with each listen.  it is a band set free from conventional form; it has the essence of satie and the spirit of coltrane. (and james marsh's cover art--he did the art for all of the original releases--is just as good!)
B00006F7S4|5.0|Wow! This record was so surprising in its poetic sorrow and beauty that I'm still surprised every time I listen to it. Beck is brave in making a record like this, after his humour, funky rhythms and sexy movements, but I think people will love him for it. What an artist! Showing himself from his best sides almost every time, and man! how many good sides he's got! Lovely, lovable!
B00005ATQF|3.0|Like \\"The Shining,\\" this is, objectively, not a good movie. Unlike \\"The Shining\\" though, it doesn't stay entertaining all the way through. The first half is alternately harrowing and hilarious and should dissuade any intelligent, sane human being from joining the Marines. R. Lee Ermey screaming his head off for forty-some minutes makes for an intense forty-some minutes, but even in boot camp, the thinking viewer may realize that nothing is actually happening, except that Vincent D'Onofrio is turning into Jack Nicholson. So this is another flashy but empty Kubrick film. <BR>But the quotes from the first half are permanently engrained in my head. \\"How tall are you, private?\\"
0316666343|5.0|Everyone should read this book just for the insight of what life might be after we leave this world. I also enjoyed how things were looked at in so many differant angels. I had trouble putting it down.
B000069AUI|5.0|What begins as a simplistic, mediocre, and even boring pop album with nothing to distinguish it becomes, 'round about 1 A.M. on the fifth or sixth straight listen, a work of exquisite beauty, with tender highs and lows and a Godly symphonic quality that surpasses any other disc-enclosed experience one might have this year. Or something.
B000065V41|5.0|I own this movie on VHS and i love it. There are a few forgettable songs but most are delightful (\\"Wherever you find love, it feels like Christmas\\"), Micheal Caine is excellent. Bob Cratchit's (Kermit's) family are spunky and witty, with Miss Piggy playing Mrs. Cratchit. Gonzo trades his usual weirdness for a top hat and scarf. He serves as the narrator, along with Rizzo the rat. Henson splits the character Marley into two separate characters. They are played by everyone's favorite hecklers Statler and Waldorf. I don't need to tell you who plays Fozziwig. This movie is very entertaining and will put even the biggest Scrooge into the holiday spirit.

B00006J3WH|4.0|First of all, the casts' voices leave much to be desired and if you're not a fan, this will certainly not win you over.  But once you get past these shortcomings, what is left is a really good musical full of witty lines and catchy music. Many times the songs are so short they are over just as you are getting into them. I would have loved to have seen an extended episode to really develop the music further. It's still a lot of fun and a must for Broadway fans who like modern punchy musicals like Urinetown, Rent, and Hairspray (and definitely not for fans of Rogers and Hammerstein, and Andrew Lloyd Webber). Of particular note are the songs &quot;I'll Never Tell&quot; and &quot;Walk Through The Fire&quot;.
B000068FUS|5.0|Fantastic! As a former (lifelong) Southerner, I was delighted by \\"Southern Rock Opera\\". While the music, dense as a curtain of kudzu, is solid, straightforward rock, the lyrics are what make this a truly exemplary album. The issue of prejudice functions as a recurrent theme throughout the piece, and, in the words of \\"The Three Great Alabama Icons\\", 'it ain't just white and black'. The singer's razorwire/whiskeysoured voice slices through George Wallace's Machiavellian desire for power; the relationship between Skynyrd and Neil Young; and the many misconceptions held about the South by both Southerners and... well, the rest of you that ain't.<br />For years, I was ashamed to claim my Southern ancestry, fearing that people would think of me as some negative stereotype rather than a smart gal with a drawl. Now, even with all of \\"the dualities of the Southern thing\\", I hold my head high and sing the praises of the Drive-By Truckers, and of the land I once called home.
B00004T37H|5.0|There is no simple way to describe the different aspects of this beautifully animated movie. Princess Mononoke pulls together an amazing story of one man looking for a cure to his curse, and his interaction with various lively characters. The overall focus on the struggle between man and nature is explored from every angle in this well written feature. And the animation in this movie is stunning in every aspect. You don't get bogged down in typical strange story lines, and there is no gruesome, unnecessary violence. Princess Mononoke becomes less like a script, and more like a work of art. What you are presented with is one of the finest animated movies that has ever been released.
B00006F7S4|3.0|I was had much anticipation for this album it got really good reviews and i loved becks previous work. I bought this album expecting a great Beck album I was dooped this album is slow and depressing. Sea Change isnt bad yet it isnt good either It left me with a feeling of nothing which was probably Becks intent. Songs like \\"paper tiger\\" sound like the beatles \\"I am the walrus\\"...  Songs like \\"I guess im doin fine\\"...
B0000640VO|5.0|A wonderful movie I could watch over and over again, catching little details (the pig lamp that turns itself off..)I was prepared for a light-hearted movie, and it is that, but it's got more depth than the previews let on.  Definately a keeper.
B00002Z88D|2.0|I expected so much more, as everyone I talked to liked this CD. ... there are two songs that I like.  Devil's Dance for one, as it opens it sounds a bit fierce, nice to lose yourself into - heavy on drums and thumping guitar.  The backup of the orchestra is awesome, just turn it up.  Vocals are hot and seductive - James,I feel you too and I'm not afraid!  The next song I like is No Leaf Clover since I've never heard it before there wasn't a memory to compare it to therefore no way to corrupt it with the orchestra. ...
6304341849|5.0|Maurice is my all time favorite film. I own a copy on VHS and one on Laser Disc, and I'm eagerly awaiting its release on DVD. As (what some may consider) a senior gay person, this film speaks directly to me; it reflects wonderfully the frustrations that I felt growing up in the '50's. Although the movie is set in the Victorian era, the 1950's were really not that different in its attitude towards gay people. The film captures so very well the longings of Maurice (as a gay man) for love, affection and some meaning to his life--the things that he felt everyone else was having but were denied to him because of his inner hidden longings.<BR>The film is beautiful to view and the sound tract is gorgeous--typical Merchant and Ivory--but, most of all, each actor is completely believable in his role. A very young Hugh Grant (long before becoming famous)is very good as Maurice's first love interest wanting a pure platonic love with Maurice even though Maurice wanted the \\"real\\" thing. My true feeling about Grant's character is that he really did not have the guts to deal with the ramifications of his true feelings (watch how he plays with Maurice's emotions and affections--I would have punched him!). Jame Wilby, as Maurice, is outstanding; he expresses the hurt, torture and longings of \\"the love that dare not speak its name\\" very well. However, the true standout for me is Rupert Graves (one of my favorite actors) who plays Scudder--he certainly shows what ladders are made for!(you'll have to see the movie to know what I'm talking about) He plays a man that knows what he wants and goes after it no matter what the cost--he redirects his life and alters his life's dream for the possibility (not, at the time of his decision, guaranteed) of love. Maurce and Scudder's final scene together when they have decided that love, no matter what, can conquer all, is truly the thing that we all dream about. Their \\"togetherness\\" points out another strong theme in the movie--the British Class System--not only did they have the \\"gay thing\\" to deal with but also the \\"class thing\\" to overcome. (Due to the fact that Scudder is from what is deemed a lower class being the Gamekeeper, he is , at first, completely ignored by Maurice until Scudder climbs into Maurice's bed, by the means of a ladder, and shows him what it's all about!!)<BR>I read E.M. Forster's book when it was finally released in the 1970's and I feel the film is faithful to the book and that Forster would have been pleased with the film. I don't know how many times I have viewed this movie (many, many, times), it, nevertheless, is a movie that reaffirms, over and over again,, my very existence.<BR>I have found, through out the years that a lot of heterosexuals find the movie to be boring; however, I feel that if you are an average gay male, (especially of a certain age) you will find it reflective of your life (or, at least, a portion thereof)--I do!<BR>Believe me, my life would have been a great deal poorer if the film Maurice had not been a part of it.<BR>I know my review is from an older person's perspective; however, I do believe that a younger person would have an appreciation for the movie if nothing more than gaining some knowledge of what it was like, not so very long ago, to be gay. In fact, I think anyone, no matter what his age happens to be, could certainly enjoy this film.
B00005YUNY|4.0|This is the best ever DVD capturing the classic progressive rock band performing live on stage recreating their classic master pieces recorded in studio some 30 years ago.  By having this DVD, unless you are looking for a collection, you did not miss anything if you have not already purchased 'House of Yes' and 'Keys to Ascension'.  It provides the top picture and sound quality enabling you to enjoy the whole concert.<br />In terms of team effort, each member of Yes performed remarkably well in conjunction with the orchestra.  It is obvious that the songs played in this concert are carefully selected enabling the European Festival Orchestra can fully complement the symphonic treatment of some of the evergreen yes songs - 'Close To The Edge' and 'And You And I'.  Nevertheless, the above arrangement quietly highlighted the importance and influence of Rick Wakeman in 'Fragile' and 'Close To The Edge'.  The symphonic ensemble simply confimed one thing - you need an orchestra to replace Rick on stage if you seriously want to replicate the songs in these 2 albums.<br />In this DVD, it is obvious that Steve Howe has lost the steam, particularly in 'Roundabout'.  Explosive guitar solo in 'Starship Trooper' and dynamic layers of fill-ins and scales in 'Roundabout' and 'I've Seen All Good People' originally available in the album and previous concerts are not played.  Yet it is considered pre-matured to say Steve has passed his \\"use by date\\"at this stage; his vast experience and skills salvaged him from devastation when he had a bad start playing 'Mood For A Day' and enabled him to \\"simplify\\" those highly demanding guitar arrangements when he was playing these 2 songs during the concert without too much significance.<br />Overall, as stated on the DVD cover, this is no dry rock plays the classics affair.  Yes and European Festival Orchestra complement each other during the whole concert and one could not have played the songs the way it was played without the other.  If you are a Yes fan, you must have this DVD.  If you simply enjoy seeing DVD with top sound and picture quality, you should have this in your collection.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Grab a pint of icecream and the biggest spoon in the drawer, or sulk in the corner hugging your favorite teddy bear. Um, better yet, just pop in 'Sea Change,' Beck's downbeat meditation on disappointment and loss. Beck returns to the introspective days of 'Mutations,' but this time, he's not simply pensive, this guy is downright despondent. However, he never sounds whiny, and one never gets the impression that he's simply feigning some pretentious and trendy concept. What gives this album it's focus, depth, and undeniable power is Beck's ability to convey a true and inexorable sense of sincerity and self-therapy. He allows consistency to build a strong case. For example, Beck never strays from the quiet simmer that opens on 'The Golden Age' and drifts on to more obviously dreary songs like 'Lonesome Tears,' 'Lost Cause,' and 'Already Dead.' Melancholy orchestral moments fade in and out. Hushed and reverent guitars, wurlitzer, percussion, and synth follow Beck along through his desolate journey. At times, his tone and manner recalls the curiously attractive, self imposed loathsomeness of E and his band, 'Eels.' Beck sounds as though he is consenting to a life overrun with misery. In a time when we're all a little world weary, this is some self-therapy we could all afford to get in on. Initially, a listener may find this new set depressing, but assuredly, Beck's confident and effusive lyrics coupled with his genuine and affecting grace, style, and audacity lend themselves well to one of this year's best new albums. How timely and appropriate for an extraordinarily talented artist such as Beck to offer us 'Sea Change,' a quiet stunner and a new American classic.
B000055XMF|4.0|I am a huge fan of the who, but didn't get around to seeing this movie until late one night a couple of weeks ago. I just happened to catch it. What a fantastic film. <br />I do somewhat miss the schizophrenic plot which was really the entire point of the album, but outside of that no more complaints can really be voiced. I think the portrayal of the mod scene here is extremely interesting, even if it is built up into something it wasn't. Also I loved Phil Daniels and Leslie Ash in their respective roles. Brilliant acting as far as I can see. <br />My two favorite scenes are as follows:<br />1. Jimmy running to the TV set upon hearing the opening chords to Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere and watching in awe as a very young Pete Townshend plays away.<br />2. Jimmy and his friends breaking into a pharmacy to steal some \\"blues\\" (upper pills)<br />Fantastic.
0140177396|3.0|Of Mice And Men is based on two men that are laborers in a small town. They leave one town going to another looking for work, hoping to fulfill their dreams of having their own land with farm animals, a place they could call their own. The main characters are George, Lennie, Curley, and Curley's wife. George and Lennie are friends. George looks after Lennie because he is slow-witted. George is always getting Lennie out of trouble. Lennie is always wondering off looking for something to pet. Because he has the mind of a child but the strength of a giant, he often kills his pets before he knows it. Curley is the boss's son. Curley, George, and Lennie are workers at the ranch. Curley is mean and likes to pick on people and is always making trouble.  Curley's wife often looks around in the barn as if she's looking for her husband. She really wants attention because she is lonely and never has any one to talk too. George and Lennie made friends with another worker named Candy. In the story both George and Candy loose something very important to them.                                                         <BR>I can somehow feel what George is going through with Lennie. I have a mentally retarded cousin. I can remember when I was younger we could not always do what we wanted or things had to be done in a certain way. In my situation my cousin could not talk, so when he wanted something, he would pull us to what ever it was he wanted, and if he could not get it, he would hit us out of anger. I would get short of patience sometimes, but I would pray for strength and guidance. In the story, George takes care of Lennie everyday. I didn't have the problem everyday because my cousin stayed with my grandmother. My grandmother dealt with this every day and did fine with it. I never heard my grandmother complain.<BR>I did not like the book. The book was negative to me. Two of the characters are killed in the story and no one seems to be able to find their dreams. If I could changesomething, it would be Lennie's role in the story. I did not like how he was treated and how the story ended. <BR>I would recommend that others read the book because it might show readers how life can sometimes be very difficult.
B00005JL78|5.0|With an opening sequence of intense quick cuts and camera movements, it was obviously going to be an exciting show; and with the many twists and turns the movie takes, I was constantly on the edge of my seat, literally!  The cinematography was outstanding!  The plot was complex!  And the acting was amazing!<br />Minority Report, starring Tom Cruise, is based on the book by Philip K. Dick.  John Anderton (Cruise) is accused of a murder that he knows he isn't going to commit.  So for the next 2 1/2 hours you watch him as he runs away, trying to prove the \\"system\\" is wrong by finding the \\"minority report.\\"<br />I know I can't wait until this DVD is released in December.  It is on my list of upcoming movies I HAVE to buy.
B00006HBUA|1.0|This movie was absolutely painful!!  My only thought as i left the theater was \\"that's two hours of my life i'll never get back...\\"  Even my 12 year old, who loved \\"She's all that\\", found this movie horribly painful to watch.  A stupid plot, stupid jokes, and a stupid ending made a classic cartoon a laughing stock.  The Harry Potter preview was the highlight of the whole experience!!
0767811070|5.0|This isn't just a \\"ghetto movie\\" as some might claim. This is a true piece of movie history that everyone should be forced to see at least once. You are sucked into the movie by watching these kids growing up with each other, learning right from wrong, but before you know it they are adults and things get complicated. The Five Stairsteps soul classic \\"Ooh Child\\" compliments this movie perfectly for a realistic, gritty, and moving portrayal of life in the slums. A well deserved 10/10.
0694013889|1.0|Even though I bought this one used for [price]- I was very disappointed in the content.  The \\"potty\\" pictured in this book is actually an \\"urn\\" like bowl that does not look even vaguely like any of the potty chairs that children are using currently.  No matter how well it is written, my daughter (20 months old) will not relate this picture to her potty chair which makes this story worthless.<br />Sorry I wasted [money] plus shipping and handling!
B00005JKED|5.0|I grew up in Los Angeles, and my sons' father is from South Central.  I TRULY appreciated the fact that for the first time ever, the streets were portrayed to the TRUEST form.  People have stigma's about the \\"jungle\\" or any rough area of LA, but truth be told, ghetto's DO have morals and a high respect.  I LOVED the scene where Denzel was in the street at the end, and the people took the Ethans side.  Ethan had heart, and was a good and they supported and backed him for that.  THAT is a true portrayal of what it is really like.  Where Denzel set up his friend and shot him after years...THAT shows how shysty people can be, and that you cant trust people who have anything at all to gain from you.  It also shows people that the police in LA or places like NY are more corupt than any criminal.  Dont let anyone tell you different.  Of course there should be an exception to the rule.  As a blonde haired blue eyed caucasion, Id feel safer in the ghetto's in Los Angeles than in the hands of the police.
B00000BKE1|5.0|First of all, I would like to say that this album is much better than some people make it out to be. True, not every song is perfect, but most of them are. This is one of those albums you can put in your cd player and listen to it all the way through. I've always loved listening to this album, especially since this was the one that really got me into Maiden. There are soo many great songs on this album. Everyone who is into REAL metal should own this one.
B00006AG5N|5.0|THIS IS AN AWESOME ALBUM AND EVERYONE NEEDS TO OWN AT LEAST ONE COPY. BUT THIS IS ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG OF WHAT THE GREATEST SINGER (ENTERTAINER) IN HISTORY HAS TO OFFER. CHECK OUT SOME OF THE RARITIES AND YOU WILL BE BLOWN AWAY BY THE SHEER POWER OF HIS VOICE. I WILL BE 32 IN OCTOBER AND HE IS STILL MY MAIN MAN, ALWAYS.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|When I first got this album, I absolutely couldn't stop listening to it. It was really cool to know that Bruce had returned to this band, considering it wasn't even half as cool without him. It is also good to know that he can still sing, the way he sings is great. Everything about this album is great. Even though I think that &quot;Fear Of The Dark&quot; is a little better, I still think that any Iron Maiden fan should definately get this one, if they haven't already. Anyone who says that this album is not very good obviously has bad taste and should be ignored. Take my word (and everyone else's) on it, this album is worth buying.
B00006J3WH|5.0|This is one of my fav. episodes ever!
0060926317|1.0|It's extremely rare that Australian aborigines choose one person to speak for them collectively, this book made it happen. Robert Eggelston, director of an aboriginal cultural institute was empowered by a coalition of many tribes to condemn this book as a fabrication and a fraud. He travelled in the outback for 16 months trying to find any aborigines who had heard of Ms Morgan or the 'Real People' tribe she claims to have met. No one had. Is it plausible that a previously unknown American woman would discover a tribe that has evaded discovery by european settlers for 200 years and by other tribes for 50 000 years or more?<br />Morgan claims her story is true, and only sold as a novel to protect this special tribe. But almost every page of this book contains \\"facts\\" that are so wildly innaccurate that it is inconcieivable that she experienced anything of the desert, let alone ancient nomadic ways and lore. She describes cutting her feet horrendously while walking over spinifex grass, but spinifex grows in clumps and in the desert is widely spaced. Not even experienced bushman can walk around in the desert sun heat without a hat, the way Ms Morgan claims she has. People die doing that, including aborigines. Ms Morgan survives, however and even meets crocodiles out there. <br />The tribe she describes is nothing like any other aborigines in Australia, but surprisingly similar to American Indians. This tribe has a chief, like no other in Australia, and he wears a head dress of parrot feathers. Names and tribal structures are completely unlike anything in ANY Australian tribe, but, again, more like Native Americans, as are desriptions of rituals, and musical instruments. Her descriptions of nomad life often seem derived partly from books and partly from pure fantasy. Her 'tribe' pay no respect to territories of other tribes, enter sacred sites without ritual preparation, carry all sorts of stuff with them and use valuable water for cooking. They collect dingo droppings for fuel - although dead wood is far more plentiful. Her description of the way didgeridoos are made is completely wrong.They are cut from living trees, not dead ones; termites are found on the inside not on the outside (they die in heat and light); and they do not make \\"sawdust\\" - they digest wood. Anyone who has actually seen this could not make these kind of errors.<br />This book is neither fact nor fiction. It misrepresesents exploits indigenous Australians with its claims of authenticity, and exploits her readers' spiritual longing and desire to connect with and learn from the indigenous peoples of the earth. The fact that this book has achieved mainstream popularity indicates a genuine and widespread desire to learn about aboriginal spirituality. I find it a tragedy that this gap is being filled by such a culturally worthless piece of deception.
B0000696I1|5.0|Some seem to not like Ninja Turtles III for some odd reason, but its great and not so typical such as having Shredder in it (as always), travelling in Time, cool setting, intresting storyline with different twists, part 1 is my favorite, then 3 then 2<br />Ninja Turtles are back in action!
0446608955|1.0|I watched the movie first with that Mandy Moore girl and really liked the movie. It was cute and sweet. So I was excited to read the book. ... I've never came across a movie that was better then the book until now. This book was terrible. Badly written and (YAWN) boring! It went on and on and on. I finally had to put it down and read something else. SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!
0131103628|5.0|(spelling in title due to space limitations)  I have read other reviews saying this book is too tough for beginners and VB developers, blah blah blah.  Granted, if you have absolutely no experience programming then this book will be a challenge, but it is not impossible to get the concepts if you have a keen eye for detail.  Also, if you have worked in VB and have messed around with functions and created objects and some of its more advanced features, then you should have enough technical acumen to flow through this book and not feel like an idiot.  I've learned VB and had BROWSED and or lightly worked with the inner workings of Java, C++, VBScript, Javascript before reading this book (they aren't terribly difficult, I know).  Syntactically, there are a lot of similarities so I was able to focus on concepts when reading this book and later others (i,e, C#, Java)  making the book easier to flow through.  Basically, when I started this book I wasn't considered 'hard-core' programmer and I was able to do the excercises and undersanbd the concepts without it being this monumental tasks others wouls lead you to believe, but that may just be a testament to the book!
0316666343|3.0|I was extremely impressed with this book when I first started reading it, but then it seemed like she didn't know where to go with the story and I felt the ending was very weak. The unusual premise of the book made me read a little about the author and eventually led me to her first autobiographical book &quot;Lucky&quot;. I was surprised that she would end this book with a sort of happily-ever-after ending when one of the things that I took away from her first book is that survivors of violent crimes seem to carry it with them for the rest of their lives. Anyway, I would recommend this book but it does go a bit astray at the end. I'm also looking forward to reading more from Alice Sebold. If anyone does read &quot;Lucky&quot; it's very interesting to compare the author's real family to the family she's created in her fiction.

B00006BTCA|5.0|This album sounds like the 90's never happened.  It could have fit perfectly into the 80's alternative dance club.  It's part Joy Division, part-80's goth, part 4AD, and a touch of Smiths.  Despite all this I don't call them a retro band.  They don't sound as though they're paying homage to bands like Wolfgang Press, Bauhaus, or early Cult &amp; Gene Loves Jezebel or a host of others.  They sound like they came upon the sound naturally.  First time I heard the album it made me nostalgic for the 80's.  Most music from the era doesn't do that.  Best songs include Obstacle 1 &amp; 2, NYC, Stella..., &amp; New.  In many ways, this album explains 80's alternative music better than an actual album from the era.  <BR>They are more than an 80's band in the same way that the Strokes are more than a late 70's NYC band.
B000069AUI|3.0|It may be unfair to judge anything to its predecessor but this new Coldplay CD sounds too rushed, lacking refinement in the recording and editing department. Yes, it carries Martin's vocal signature but the emotions ( or lack of it)present in Parachutes is collectively shallow. Only \\"In My Place\\" and one other song will experience popular airplay.<br />Parachutes had melodic guitars but this CD somehow lacks this melodic spice...
B00000HZTB|5.0|The Blue Mask has stood the test of time very well in Lou Reed's oeuvre and is amongst my top 5 Reed albums. The varied material takes us from domestic bliss in My House (\\"I've really got a lucky life/My writing, my motorcycle and my wife\\") to extreme emotion and paranoia (\\"I cringe at my terror/I hate my own smell/I know where I must be/I must be in hell\\") which is a near perfect description of a panic attack. In a way, this album returns to many of the themes that had inspired Reed from the start of his career with the Velvets: His mentor, poet Delmore Schwarz is invoked in the opening track, reminding the listener of the Velvets's European Son (to Delmore), while Underneath The Bottle, an account of his struggle with alcohol, brings to mind an earlier song The Power Of Positive Drinking from the album [[ASIN:B00004TQSH Growing Up in Public]], and the beautiful Heavenly Arms with its gorgeous fading choruses is not too far removed from Satellite Of Love on [[ASIN:B00006LLOG Transformer]]. But the approach is different: gone is the decadent narrator of the demi-monde, and instead Reed turns into an essayist or reporter writing and singing with great maturity but still passionately about subjects as diverse as women, gun violence and the day John Kennedy died. The guitars of Reed and Quine, the bass and the drums work perfectly together, whether on the slow numbers or on the more intense rockers like Waves of Fear or the title track. Best of all, the melodies are strong and memorable and the arrangements are innovative. The Blue Mask is excellent in every way!
B00003CXXP|5.0|Absolutely brilliant!  An ultra-modern- but timeless - fairy tale.  I never cry at anything, but this choked me up repeatedly.
B000002LIX|5.0|This brilliant album provides a gripping blend of intoxicating rhythmic patterns, jagged guitar riffs and piercing, intense vocals, and is a work of depth that yields its treasures with repeated listening. My favorites include the hard rocking Stop and the catchy Been Caught Stealing, as well as the epic masterpieces Then She Did  and Three Days. But most of all the churning Of Course with its poignant lyrics and the closing ballad Classic Girl with its mesmerising melody remain in my mind. Jane's Addiction's sound impresses both with its intensity, helped of course by Farrell's edgy voice, and its ability to shift dynamically between different sonic textures. At first listen - from the opening announcement in Spanish to the last strains of Classic girl - I knew this was a masterpiece. Subsequent listens have only revealed more and more of its rewarding nuances and intricate delights. Ritual de lo Habitual is at times tender, visceral, rousing and quirky, but always intense, dramatic and cinematic, like the best rock music should be.
B00006F7S4|4.0|Having cut my teeth (whatever that means) on such mopesters as Leonard Cohen and Nick Drake, I can relate to the songs on Sea Change.  There's two parts to this album -- the drifting singer-songwriter stuff of the first eight songs which (especially Guess I'm Doing Fine and It's All In Your Mind) sound like Gordon Lightfoot, and the last four songs which sound more like the Beck we're all used to.  The standout tracks are Lonesome Tears (which should be a hit single) and Round the Bend.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Before Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone came out on video/DVD I could not stand the sight or sound of Harry Potter.  To be honest I could not stand the name.  So when it came out on video/DVD I rented it to see what the hype was all about.  Now four months later I own the movie (which I bought the same day I rented it). I have sence bought all four books and read each twice and am on the third time reading them.  I cant wait for book five to come out and for the next movie.  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an awesome movie.  It is just like the book it keeps you going till the very end.  The movie however, just brings it to life even more.  The entire cast is totally aweosme and the special affects are awesome to.  This is a MUST OWN MOVIE!!! I highly recomend it to anyone with an imagination.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I purchased this CD after listening to it at a friend's house, and it is quickly becoming my favorite. The songs are beautifuly written, soothing, and mellow. But don't worry, this is not a CD that it will put you to sleep. I've also shared this CD with friends and family, and so far I've yet to find anyone who doesn't like it. Even my boyfriend (who can't stand my Tori Amos CDs) likes this CD, it really is the sort of music anyone can appreciate, no matter what type of music you prefer. My only complaint is that I wish the CD were longer, because I'm always disappointed when it's over!
B00005OAIE|5.0|This was the greatest cd I have heard all year long. &quot;Comfortable&quot; is one of the greatest 'real life' songs I have ever listened to. No one writes about the stuff John Mayer does. No one writes about love being comfortable, but in essence that is what love is all about. No one stays in love because it is full of drama, you stay in love because you are comfortable with the person you are with. Also in the song &quot;83&quot; I love how he talks so personally about his brother. This isn't one of those cd's where you leave thinking &quot;who does that happen to?&quot;. Instead you are thinking, &quot;How did he know that about me?&quot;. Buy this cd! It is SO awesome!
0441009425|4.0|Great book, a great plot, exciting characters, kept me guessing till the end, book would have got 5 stars if it had stopped twelve pages earlier then it did, (except last 2 pages) the part about the neutron star was totally unbelievable and dumb....an apparant misguided effort to give the book a \\"happy\\" ending...maybe the editors required it!!
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Like the excellent &quot;Toy Story&quot; box set, this DVD is worth the price for the extras alone.  A fine film notwithstanding, the DVD extras alone kept me occupied for a couple hours.<br />The two additional short films and a series of &quot;outtakes&quot; are also very funny.
B000001C6N|5.0|For [bad] music that is. Slayer's 1983 debut release is one of the best thrash records of all time. All hail Slayer.

B00005JKDR|5.0|I have always loved Disney movies because it appeals to every age group. _Monsters, Inc._ was an amazing movie. This movie is about a small society made up of monsters, whose jobs are to scare human beings in order to keep the monster city's electricity running. As long as a human being is scared or screams, the city runs smoothly. Later in the movie, the main character Mike is torn between what is right for the city or right morally. He becomes attached to a little girl named Boo and has to decide whether or not he wants to scare human beings. This movie leaves a lesson for everyone, which is to do what is morally right, not necessarily right for everyone else. Don't follow the crowd. I took my 3 year old cousin and some of my friends to watch this movie and we both laughed histerically and enjoyed it! Even though me and my friends are in college, we sheded a few tears towards the end of the movie. This movie is such a classic and is so cute! I give it raving reviews!
B0000017CA|5.0|This CD is awesome, but I can't find it anywhere! I've tried downloading it, but can't find all the songs. PLEASE, if you own the CD, put it all onto Kazaa/Morpheus and help spread the word about this great band.

B0000070QS|4.0|There are pop singers that you recognize from the first note. Three come to mind. Tracy Thorn (EBTG),Morrisy, and Morten Harket.  This is more of what you're thirstin' for. On several cuts Morten harmonizes with his own lilting voice-what a vocal!  The CD has some cuts that are ...well almost soulful in delivery and content.  Los Angeles, Tell Me What You See, Stay, and Ready To Go Home are immediate standouts. Yes this does have some of the AHA sound, but isn't that what led you here anyway?  Buy it. Enjoy it. Ya got no where else to go.
B00000I9MK|5.0|And thank god I was let on to this group by a girl named Stacy in my college.  She recommended them to me when I told her I liked Blur.  I bought this, listened to it once, put it away for a year, and then decided to listen to it on a whim.  It has totally changed my life, and now that she has graduated, I can't thank her and tell her how much I adore this music (and that's partially why I am writing this review).  <br />It's a sort of pure pop breath of fresh air that hooks you from the first moment you hear Stuart's voice.  The music, what can I say about it?  Catchy, kinetic, comforting, good to make love to... or so I've heard, HA! Favorites are &quot;The State I Am In, She's Losing It, I Could Be Dreaming, Mary Jo, and Electronic Rennaisance&quot;.  The last one because it's so different from anything else on the album, and it makes me dance, dance, dance!  It is a CD I listen to at least 2 times a week start to finish every week.  <br />Thank you Stacy, I never would have found B 'n' S without you.  BTW, get &quot;I'm Waking Up To Us&quot; also, &quot;Marx And Engels&quot; is great.
0780624890|5.0|Smooth as a motha, Wesley Snipes plays the half-vampire, half-human. He is a 'daywalker' and he slays vampires (just because) at night. You scratch his sunglasses, it's your buttocks. Deacon Frost (pasty white boy) wants to become the ultimate vampire, so Blade must stop him. I don't know what the fat blob of a kid was all about, but it was disgusting. It looked like a huge pile of mashed potatoes with a face. Blade slices and dices many and people will get a kick out of the red shower at the beginning of the movie. &quot;There are worse things out there besides vampires, me,&quot; said Blade. Damn right. This is definitely  one of the coolest vampire movies ever.
B00003CXAE|3.0|&quot;Grease&quot; has finally been made available to own on DVD. Was it worth the wait? Yes and No.  The DVD version is really no different than the 20th Anniversary VHS released in 1998. The retrospective intreviews used in this release are the same exact ones used in that edition. The movie looks and sounds great. You do have the option of selection a Dolby Surrround or Dolby 5.1 Digital soundtrack. The original theatrical trailer is also included but as theatrical trailers go it's nothing to shout about.  DVD is such an interactive medium and &quot;Grease&quot; is such a movie classic I feel Paramount short-changed it's fans with such a sparse, uneventful DVD release. A songbook?!!? for crying out loud any true fan who doesn't know the lyrics to any of this movie's songs by heart wouldn't own the movie to begin with.  In 1998 Paramount released a 20th Anniversary Edition laserdisc of &quot;Grease&quot; which included a never-before-seen deleted scene. Why wasn't this scene included in this DVD release? Go figure. The only advantage this DVD has over it's many VHS incarnations aside from the great sound and video transfer is the easy access to it's musical numbers and scenes. Even &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; got better DVD treatment. Oh well, maybe for the film's 50th Anniversary, until then I guess this will do.
014028009X|5.0|Sure - this was a great book.  Sure - it became a great movie.  Buy you have to remember that it gioes beyond that - it's a classic.  If you're a lover of giggle-romance novels, this is the staple of the sub-category.  A must have for anyone whoe wants to laugh at that way so many of us are!
B00005RHGK|1.0|The first half of the movie is actually decent in the way it is shot and the mood that is suggested. The Creeper is actually scarier when you don't see him or know what he looks like. The opening truck sequence is effective (even though it borrows from Spielberg's DUEL). The movie gets insanely dumb and unbelievable at the halfway point. The ending is not very creative and just does not go indepth about who or what the Creeper is. The Creeper's design was also a little dissappointing It looked like a guy wearing a latex halloween mask. Also, the stupidity of the teenagers was pretty annoying. But the bottom line is that the ending left me so utterly disappointed and wanting more that I can't give this movie anything but a one star rating. Please do not buy this, rent it but it is not anything you would want to own.
B00006F7S4|4.0|...i have always been a huge beck lover and so i quickly bought this cd.  When i first began to listen to the songs i was really excited because beck has gone back to blues and melody, but, as the songs continued, I  began to loose interest in the slow beauty of the cd.  it seemed a bit long and repetitive.  not too original.  each of the songs (with the exception of maybe two) sound like that slow last song that we all love on many awesome rock albums.  but would they be so great if that is all the cd consisted of? - and the thing that i miss the most are his crazy lyrics.  some of the songs sound like they could actualy be written by a normal song writer.    <BR>but it still may grow on me more as i listen.  and i really am glad that he has left his [other style] on \\"midnight vultures\\" for a more blues style -he also left some of the funk though.  and replaced it with some trippy slowness that i don't dislike...<BR>so four stars to this sweet cd, and i am looking forward to continuing to listen and dig into the meloncholly of beck's new album.
B00005JKWJ|3.0|I was enjoying the movie but the scene, in which Blade does a WWF wrestling move, ruined it for me. I was left snickering with half of the audience. Also when his partner throws him the shades and he catches it perfectly. All of this is too campy for a movie that takes itself seriously. The effects are good ang the action sequences are enjoyable. But please next time leave the wrestling to cheesy guys in tights.
0375701427|1.0|Just finished this book.  First read of Philip Roth and I think he is a great writer, lots of brillant description, background and life.<br />However the 3 main protagonists, Swede, Dawn &amp; Merry are so flat that they are hardly 2 dimenisonal.  If they were ment to be ciphers for the American experiance of the 60's and 70's....it fails to engage or make me identify with it or them.<br />All 3 remained unreal, even Swede's rage near the end left me unmoved or concerned.<br />There are attempts at &quot;magic realism&quot; in this book, but, I couldn't engage in it.<br />As a descriptive writter he seems over welming in his ability and will go down as America's Dickens or Hardy.<br />A prize winner? no I think not.

0385720920|3.0|Reading Choke is kinda like finding out all Rage Against the Machine songs sound like that.
B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles, commonly known as the \\"White Album\\", was the Beatles first double LP released after Magical Mystery Tour in 1969. The sound is much more raw, and lacks the overdubs that were found everywhere in Sgt. Pepper and Magical Myster Tour. This is due to the fact that the album was written while the Beatles were in India, armed with nothing but their accoustic guitars. The result was a collection of thirty songs(not all made it to the album)that contain some of John and Paul's best work ever. John offers some of his lyrically best songs. \\"Happiness is a warm gun\\", \\"Sexie Sadie\\", and \\"Glass Onion\\" contain John's usual biting lyrics, while \\"Julia\\" is an emotional tribute to his mother. Paul's melodic songs have no equal. \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" are masterpieces. George also makes a strong showing on the album with classics such as \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\". This album also acts as the debut for Ringo's first song \\"Don't Pass Me By\\". Every song on this album is a masterpiece. The construction of each song is flawless will stay in your head for a long while. The album contains such a wide variety of styles from blues to rock. John's song \\"Goodnight\\", which was written to his son, is a pure lullaby. It is unfortunate that you can see the band drifting apart in this album. Regardless, the album is a must have for any music fan. The album shines in every aspect and is truly a masterpiece that is just as good now as it was 33 years ago.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This is just brilliant music from the greatest recording artist of all time. The improved sound quality on these songs is incredible, so even if you already have every ELV1S album every released this is still worth buying. If you have never bought an ELV1S album then this is where to start. This album will appeal to anybody who is open to listening to good music. You will never get better value than this.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Pixar and Disney have done it again w/ Monsters, Inc.  Storyline, voices, humor, and class make this computer animated film a winner.  Kids will enjoy it for the cute characters and obvious humor, while adults will marvel at the subtle humor and inuendo.  Be sure to buy the DVD for the outakes and bonus features.
B0000399WI|5.0|This is my number one favorite movie. It's got so much strength behind it. The story is amazing and the actors are just as great! You will cry tears of sadness, you will cry tears of joy.
0060934913|3.0|Having worked as a chef for last fifteen years. I truly enjoyed this book, Anthony's passion for food is definitely there and that connected with me. I liked the darkness of the delve into the core of the prep halls and kitchens. The stories made me laugh and I definitely related to everything that Anthony had said. My major problem with Kitchen Confedential was that I'd just finished reading The Slacker Confessions and well, that's a tough act to follow. Tommy Campbell's a stand-up comedian who wrote his book after cooking and doing other jobs for ten years. Well, you can tell it's written by a pro-storyteller who knows how to keep you turning the pages and laughing like a madman. Anthony is quite a good story teller, and Kitchen Confidential shows that with some good ones, and a few solid laughs. Yeah, I recommend it, but inside a kitchen and beyond, I found the real heart of the American job was made into comic genious by The Slacker Confessions. Check out Kitchen Confidential if you want something more mainstream and accepted, but if you want to go for the real deal then treat yourself to the honest laugh of a liftetime and check out The Slacker Confessions.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|Blade 2 may not win any Oscars but as far as action movies goes I dont think that a better one has ever been made. This movie is pure action from start to finish.
B000002GBB|3.0|This may sound cruel, but I think STYX were one of the bands<br />that inspired SPINAL TAP. JAMES YOUNG's hard rock songs, includ-<br />ing THE GREAT WHITE HOPE, are unintentionally silly and almost<br />embarassing in how NEAT they try to sound. I'm also not a fan of<br />his singing voice. I'm not a big fan of DENNIS DEYOUNG's voice<br />either, especially when he sings backing vocals.<br />  All this being said, I do like this band somewhat and of all<br />their albums, PIECES OF EIGHT is my favorite. I don't really like<br />the first half, especially the songs THE GREAT WHITE POPE and<br />SING FOR THE DAY. I particularly do not like the synthesizers on<br />SING. The second half, however, is very good and I think it con-<br />tains some of their best material ever. BLUE COLLAR MAN, in par-<br />ticular, is a great hard rock song, with a very strong lead vocal<br />from TOMMY SHAW and the organ playing during the main riff re-<br />minds me of CARRY ON WAYWARD SON. QUEEN OF SPADES is also quite<br />enjoyable. It almost borders on self-parody, with how evil it<br />tries to sound, but it's still a very good progreesive hard rock<br />song. PIECES OF EIGHT is another great song and I think it has<br />DEYOUNG'S best vocal ever. AKU-AKU is a very laid back and mellow<br />instrumental that ends the album on a nice relaxing note.<br />  ONWARD TO THE MORIBUND CASTLE, MAGRUFF!
B000068TPN|5.0|This movie was absolutely spectacular and kept me in my seat for the entire time, the first time I watched it and all the other times as well.  It also brought home the story of the wives who waited for their husbands to return or not to return from battle which I felt was an important potrayal.<br />I was hesitant to purchase the DVD as I didn't think that Mel Gibson was the proper pick for the lead but was I wrong. This was well beyond his Braveheart and Patriot roles.<br />Buy it !!
B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters Inc. is a entertaining and fun movie for people of all ages.  Like any typical college student I started watching this movie at 2 in the morning.  I managed to stay awake easily throughout the whole thing.  The movie had the best graphics I have seen yet in an animated movie.  Also the cast was second to none.  After the movie started it was easy to find yourself in the monsters world.  The humor and overall storyline was very good.  I will watch this movie many more times in the future.  Each time I watch it I notice something that I didn't see the previous time.  The detail and time spent on making this movie is simply amazing.
0792839129|1.0|Watching this incredibly corny movie, I really feel embarrased for the poor CAR !....It's this movie's only redeeming feature. In my opinion, a great movie to watch with the sound turned off. But still, it's harmless enough and I guess there have been worse movies made.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I THOUGHT THIS FILM WAS EXCELLENT, CONSIDERING IT WAS MADE BY THE BLOKEY WHO MADE MORTAL KOMBAT. IT WAS STRAIGHT FORWARD AND STARTED ALMOST STRAIGHT AWAY AND STAYED TRUE TO THE GAME IN MOST RESPECTS EXCEPT FOR THE CHARACTERS NAMES AND SOME OF THE PLOT. I LIKED THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO MUCKING ABOUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE CHARACTERS KILLING THE ENEMY, UNLIKE MANY FILMS WHERE THE CHARACTERS HESITATE TO KILL RESULTING IN THEIR OWN DEATHS; THE CHARACTERS IN THIS FILM DID WHAT YOU WOULD DO AND USE ANYTHING AT YOUR DISPOSAL TO ENSURE YOU DONT GET KILLED. ANYWAY, I THOUGHT THE EFFECTS WERE VERY GOOD TOO, THOUGH BEING AN CREATIVE PERSON WITH AN EYE FOR DETAIL I THOUGHT THE 'LICKER' (THAT HUGE, SALIVATING, SKINLESS THING WITH THE TONGUE) COULD HAVE BEEN ANIMATED A LITTLE SMOOTHER AND THE LIGHTING ON IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DARKER, BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT STOOD OUT A LITTLE TOO MUCH ON SCREEN, THOUGH THE DETAIL ON IT'S MUSCLES WERE SUPERB. THE SCORE DEFINATELY DESERVES A MENTION; THIS WAS ONE OF THE MAIN ASPECTS THAT MADE THE FILM FOR ME BECAUSE IT HAD, MARCO BELTRAMI (THE CROW:SALVATION AND BLADE 2 SCORE'S), PROVIDING THE ORCHESTRATIONS, MARILYN MANSON PROVIDING THE HARDCORE, ATMOSPHERIC, INDUSTRIAL ROCK AND JUNKIE XL PROVIDING THE DANCEY, TECHNO, SOUNDSCAPEING AND THEN THERE IS A NINE INCH NAILS TRACK IN THERE THAT SOUNDED LIKE IT INFLUENCED MARILYN MANSONS PART OF THE SCORE EVEN THOUGH THIS PIECE OF MUSIC IS TEN YEARS OLD... IVE BOUGHT THE SOUNDTRACK, WHICH IS ALSO VERY GOOD, BUT I WISH THEY WOULD BRING THE FULL LENGTH SCORE OUT, IT IS VERY ATMOSPHERIC, DRAMATIC, HEAVY AND DANCE LIKE AT THE SAME TIME, IF THEY DO PUBLISH THE SCORE IT WOULD BE A MUST HAVE FOR ANY SELF RESPECTING FAN OF ALTERNATIVE LISTENING.<BR>...THIS IS ONE OF THOSE FILMS, THERE'S NO HARD TO FOLLOW PLOT AND THE ACTION COMES THICK, FAST AND FAIRLY GOREY (THOUGH ITS NOT THE GORIEST FILM EVER). IF YOU LOVE THE GAME YOU SHOULD LIKE THIS...
0316666343|5.0|I got the book at the library, went home to a quiet house, and I read for five hours until I finished the book.  I could not put it down.  I read constantly (favorites have been 100 Years of Solitude, Charms For an Easy Life, The Red Tent, Fall on Your Knees), and I put this in my favorites list.  She writes with so much emotion that one can almost feel the torment that a family must go through in this kind of wrenching experience.  There are no easy endings, no pat solutions with the killer getting what he deserved, but that is the way life is. Even with the incredible sadness of the events and the effect on the family, I think it is a life affirming story.  I think this book is a beautifully written poignant story that looks at this experience through the eyes of the 14 year old girl.  It is a treasure that makes one be grateful to be living, and it is why I love to read.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I have watched this movie three times and I still can't figure the thing out.  I've tried, I've asked other people who have watched it with me and they can't figure it out either.<br />So I have now given up and Mulholland Drive is now a dust collector in my DVD storage case.<br />Go figure ?!!
B0000542D2|5.0|Had to go get this collector's edition of The Beatles in  &quot; A Hard Day's Night &quot; today on the first day of release and really think it's a wonderful package now that I've viewed it . The film images are incredibly sharp and all the musical sequences jump out at your ears with a fidelity and clarity previous VHS tape versions can't come close to equaling .( As for critiqueing the film itself well, what hasn't already been said except that you've got to be a pretty miserable sort not to enjoy it ) . <BR>  The extras in this 2 DVD set are truly great to have such as recollections from Director Richard Lester , Beatles producer George Martin , Beatles confidant Klaus Voorman, other actors and behind the scenes people and many others . Beatles fans, of course , haven't had a new album release ( let's not count their very successful &quot; 1 &quot; CD of a couple of years ago ) to savor in quite some time , but this DVD set fills the void pretty nicely .
0307655105|5.0|I was so happy to find this book on Amazon.com. I grew up with this book and my mom lent it to someone and their kid tore it up! I was so upset. Then I found it for sale on here! All of my childhood memories came back when I received the book in the mail. I absolutely loved this book growing up and cannot wait to share it with my children.<BR>Thank you!
0375703764|4.0|Timeless. I hate the indulgence of postmodernity. I say there is something more than meets your eye here. Look carfully; and no, I'm not a slacker. And I dislike cofeeshops. This is the nexus of our own twisted agenda. It is a mirror. Look at the love we give George Bush; war; lies and perception: our selfless cap.i.tal.is.tic charity. All this and more. Much, much more. A mirror; the eye

B00005JKWJ|5.0|Blade 2 by far better than the first of what I can hope to be a series of Blade movies.  The special effects and action were excellent and the new and improved vampires were a surprise to me..... a welcomed one.  The story line was clear and played well throughout the movie.<br />I'll be waiting for Blade 3....
B000069AUI|5.0|When I first heard this album, I must admit that I was a little unsure at first.  Then I remembered that I felt the exact same way when I listened to Parachutes...and that turned out to be a musical gem.  This is no different.  This band has a sound I have not heard before, and I think that is what makes listening to them such an event.  There is more emotion in these songs (mainly due to the vocals and lyrics, but the piano helps too) than in most albums today.  I feel these songs more than I hear them...not sure that makes sense, but that is how it seems when I put them in the stereo.  This is why music is so much fun and such an important part of my life.  This is definitely an album you can wrap yourself around.  I highly recommend it.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis, and his magical voice which is his instrument is just in a class all bye himself. When I listened to this CD in my car it just blew me away especially how clear and pure the vocal sound is.<BR> Elvis really is one of a kind   and I guess he really is eternal especially with his reinvention to the Younger generation  as a result of their response to a little less Conversation.I, REALLY believe that if you own one Elvis cd this is the one to have and you will end up wanting more especially with the great distinct ELVIS vocals combined with a fantastic remix sound. Thanks, <BR>       Rich
B00005KFZD|5.0|this is the best album that I heard for sure. everybody must check this baby out. great cd
B000002LCX|5.0|Before the Smiths split they delivered this fine piece of work.  I would hesitate to call this their best work, only because I can't decide between this, The Queen is Dead or Louder Than Bombs.  I would say however, that this is the deepest of their proper studio creations.  The band is at their musical peak, expanding the Smith sound through use of piano and Johnny Marr streching out his guitar parts, while Morrisey delivers his most convincing set of lyrics.  It is hard to beleive that this is the sound of a group about to implode.  Several songs are among the best that the group had released including A Rush and a Push, Death of a Disco Dancer, I Won't Share You and Paint a Vulgar Picture.  Better to go out on top I guess.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This a smart marketing decision for RCA/BMG. Since the 25th anniversary of Elvis' death, a CD ought to be released. Now that it is, that was fantastic. This is a good starter for those discovering Elvis' music. I know this just came out and I don't own it (because I own all of these songs on separate CDs), but I predict this is going to sell big time! Sure, you can say that they're trying to copy \\"The Beatles 1\\". I really don't think. I'm not a Beatles fan. That CD had 27 songs, \\"ELV1S 30 #1 Hits\\" has got 30 plus the new remix of \\"A Little Less Conversation\\" which was a worldwide #1 hit. Elvis rules, and this CD shows why.
0793927501|5.0|This is one of my favorite adventure-suspense films of all time. After a horrifying plane crash, Alec Baldwin, Anthony Hopkins, and ??? get stranded in the Alaskin wilderness. Then, just when things couldn't possibly get any worse, they must fight a blood thirsty grizzly bear to stay alive! Will they succeed? This movie is wonderful and exciting to say the least. The acting is great, the scenery is breathtaking, and the storyline & plot are convincing & very life-like. Enjoyable.
6305428557|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  Enjoy most of Hugh Grant's movies, but this one really suprised me.  I was determined not to finish watching it, but couldn't help myself!  This film has a lot of unspoken wit and charm...pleasant, simple storyline; interesting &quot;every day&quot; kinds of characters.  Thought the story line development was superb.  'Englishman' is really a &quot;needle in a haystack&quot; kind of film....not a lot of big names, but charming, warm, and most enjoyable.

B000002C25|3.0|After two albums of finely-crafted (so might say, too-finely) vintage pop & rock based on the Beatles' classic template, Oasis were on top of the world. Even with their highly-publicized infighting & antics, there was no denying the talent the band (in particular, the Gallagher brothers) had. But if they could be accused of having a giant-size ego, albums like their follow-up to 1995's multi-platinum [WHAT'S THE STORY] MORNING GLORY?, BE HERE NOW (1997) are ample proof of a band using their newfound success to do whatever they pleased & damned be the results.<br />Ironically, this was the album that turned me into an Oasis enthusiast, but it was on the strength of the first single, \\"D'Ya Know What I Mean\\". With the abundance of tape loops & backwards guitars, Oasis' legendary love of the Beatles was in full bloom on this song & despite its 7-minute plus length was an excellent choice for the introductory single. Of course, references to rock history were to be found (everything from BLOOD ON THE TRACKS to \\"Bring It On Home To Me\\"), but it shows that maybe Oasis' influences aren't all based in Liverpool.<br />The epic length of that song is exploited to the fullest on BE HERE NOW, with songs being taken to the breaking point with extended solos & fade-outs, especially on songs that needed some work in the first place. \\"My Big Mouth\\", \\"Magic Pie\\" (an inexcusable dig at Paul McCartney, who had released his new album FLAMING PIE at around the same time), \\"Girl In The Dirty Shirt\\" & the title track all suffer from either underdeveloped lyrics or ones that were probably just written to offend as many people as possible (the Gallaghers might consider that a compliment). \\"Stand By Me\\" works a little better, but the weak link in this song is that it sounds a little too angry to be the kind of \\"true friendship\\" song its title professes it to be.<br />But BE HERE NOW does have some raisons d'etres & they somehow make up for the rough spots those above-mentioned songs create. While not released as an official single (but a video was played on MTV in the U.S.), \\"Don't Go Away\\" actually sounds sincere & heartfelt, enough that my mom (not a very big fan of modern music) loved the song & was looking for a single for it, to no avail. Just maybe beneath those cold stares there's a heart of gold beating inside the Gallaghers. \\"I Hope, I Think, I Know\\" & \\"It's Gettin' Better [Man!!]\\" are upbeat rockers that hint at a little less of a Beatles influence & more towards the Stones (it may have been self-proclaimed, but their profession of being the greatest band in the world was closer to the truth than Oasis) sound they would explore a little bit in 2000's STANDING ON THE SHOULDER OF GIANTS. \\"Fade In-Out\\" takes a little while to register, but it's still a promising song that could have been made better with a more understandable lyric (the slide guitar by Johnny Depp is pretty cool though).<br />Finally, we get to the album's crown jewel (in my opinion, at least), \\"All Around The World\\". The 3rd single in the U.S., this 9-minute epic had the distinction of being one of the best songs Oasis has ever made on an album that was far from it. The string arrangements cry \\"A Day In The Life\\" & Liam Gallagher's vocal screams John Lennon (as it often would), but I'm sure the Beatles would have been proud to create something as great as \\"All Around The World\\", which also made for an inventive video (you gotta wonder what would have happened had the Beatles lasted long enough to make them for MTV). For once, the length of this song doesn't drag it down, as is the fate of most of BE HERE NOW.<br />I got BE HERE NOW for Christmas in 1997 & liked it on the first listen, but in retrospect I've come to see its faults. Not only does it have songs that needed some trimming & polishing, but the whole affair smacked of \\"we've just sold millions of albums, now let's do what the hell we want\\" attitude. There's such a thing as self-confidence, but when it turns into an egotrip, you're not gonna have many people travelling with you, as evidenced by the rather small sales of this album (still favorable, but not MORNING GLORY level).<br />When Oasis returned the following year with THE MASTERPLAN, a collection of their highly-vaunted B-sides, maybe they were discovering that good songs are more important than how ones dresses them up. Their subsequent albums have had them return to those smaller ambitions, but the chances of them returning to the rarefied greatness of MORNING GLORY seem nil with only personnel changes by the bowlful (only Noel & Liam Gallagher are left from the original line-up) & a legion of bad press to keep them in the headlines.trip, you're not gonna have many people travelling with you, as evidenced by the rather small sales of this album (still favorable, but not MORNING GLORY level).<br />When Oasis returned the following year with THE MASTERPLAN, a collection of their highly-vaunted B-sides, maybe they were discovering that good songs are more important than how ones dresses them up.

B00000JCOV|4.0|It took me a while to get used to this kind of heavy music (I used to listen to Country music a lot) but this is, by far, one of the best damn Heavy Metal albums I have ever heard. I've reviewed Slipknot's latest album,IOWA, and gave it 3 stars. I give this CD 4 stars because it's a lot better than IOWA. Songs like &quot;Spit It Out&quot; and &quot;Surfacing&quot; are just incredible! If you like Heavy Metal then get this album! YOU SHOULD LOVE IT A LOT!
B00006F7S4|5.0|This is melancholy music at its best.  The wonderful thing about Beck is that he can take any genre of music and inject it with a new attitude.  With Midnite Vultures he outfunked the funky.  In Odelay he was hipper than most hip-hoppers.  In Sea Change he is mopier than all moped-out sadness, and for that, I love it!  It's perfect mood music, but more than that, it's achingly beautiful music.  Even people who don't normally consider themselves Beck fans should be amazed by the graceful rhythm and lyrical beauty of these songs.
0679721037|3.0|I recently read the book Hiroshima, By John Hersey, for an L.A. book report and was in some ways very happy about the book and how it was written, and in other ways, not.  The story  is about the time when America dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima (hence the name of the book) Japan. The Book was very informative, giving you five points of veiw, all which are true, and combined them into one whole story. This, However, made the book hard to follow. It (the book) would go for example, by telling the story of Mr. Fujii (one of the people in the book, who was a physician) And in the next paragraph, would all of the sudden start talking about Father Kleinsorge (another person in the book) who, had little to nothing to do with Mr. Fujii. This made the story somewhat hard to follow because I would become interested in one persons story, and then it would change to another person, which was sometimes frusterating.  I would have personally much rather have had one ongoing story about one person (maybe two would be fine) That's just my preference. Some people may prefer many different stories. If you're reading this review and thinking, wow, sounds like he hated the book, well, i did!  I learned a lot about the war with Japan, and all of that. But if I wouldn't have had to read the book, I definitly would have stopped reading after the second chapter. But who knows, maybe you'll enjoy it. If you like stories about how people help other people to survive, and stories about history, then I think you probably will enjoy this book.  Thanks for taking the time to read my Review. <BR> <BR>                                                                     Mitch Smucker<BR>                                                                     September, 24, 2002
0151008116|4.0|I found this book heroic and rather transcendental at times. Beautiful in the writing and in the larger context of life.
0375701427|2.0|Let's see, John Updike's \\"Rabbit, Run\\" was brilliant, and so he is awarded a Pulitzer prize instead for \\"Rabbit is Rich\\", by far the worst book in his four-part Rabbit series, rambling, pointless, seemingly unedited. Then there is Kennedy's insipid \\"Ironweed\\" and Chabon's sprawling \\"The Amazing Adventures of Kavialer & Clay\\", but for me \\"American Pastoral\\" clinches it. I've read fifteen other Philip Roth books, several of them twice, and all are better than this -- with the possible exception of \\"The Facts\\", which doesn't really count since it's not a novel. (Let's list them: \\"Goodbye Columbus\\", \\"Letting Go\\", \\"When She Was Good\\", \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\", \\"The Breast\\", \\"The Great American Novel\\", \\"Our Gang\\", \\"My Life as a Man\\", \\"The Professor of Desire\\", \\"The Ghostwriter\\", \\"Zuckerman Unbound\\", \\"The Anatomy Lesson\\", \\"The Prague Orgy\\", \\"The Counterlife\\", and \\"The Facts\\".) So what does a Pulitzer prize mean? It means, apparently, that the novel is lousy but the author has talent.<br />In any case: 1) I LIVED through the sixties. This book does not come close to capturing them, and the events it drones on about are preposterous and cartoonish. 2) Its climax is forced, contrived, and unconvincing. <br />(It's a bit unsettling by the way to see so Nixon beat up on in the time of the much more blatantly unscrupulous, aggressively self-serving, cynical, and mean Bush II.)

B00006AG5N|5.0|RCA/BMG finally is &quot;taking care of business&quot; with the legacy of ELV1S. The new cd ELV1S 30 #1s has been remastered and the songs have never sounded better. From Heartbreak Hotel to the newest worldwide hit &quot; A Little Less Conversation&quot; this new ELV1S cd is a pure pleasure to listen to. This compilation of number ones shows why ELV1S is still the king and always will be. The cd has ELV1S singing everything from rock and roll to ballads to light opera (Its Now or Never). Nobody has such a range of talent like ELV1S. This cd deserves to be a number one worldwide hit!!

0743201140|1.0|Beware!  The Gallup Organization considers this book an *introduction* to Strengths Based Living.  It is a small part of a larger program that their consulting group administers for large organizations.  It appears that this book was developed as a primer to get managers interested in using the Gallup consulting program within their own organizations.  If you ask for more in-depth information or a full report on your assessment results on an individual level (which they provide for corporate clients) you will be told it is not available.<br />The book itself reads like an introduction to StrengthsFinder.  It offers interesting and insightful background information about managing strengths, but comes up short on follow through.  After you take the assessment test there is very little information on how to truly capitalize on the results.   Further, you may only take the assessment test once and then you are locked out.  So if you want to share the book with your family or friends be ready to shell out another $27 so they can take the test too.<br />Bottom line, this book is a thinly veiled money-making sham designed to maximize profit and open the door to corporate consulting contracts.  Spend your money on something else.
B00005QY5Y|3.0|This disc seems almost tailormade to alienate the alt.country faithful, and shed the baggage of his past.  There are still a few Dylanisms at the start, but most of this is sort of introspective, folk-ish pop songcrafting.  In vocal timbre he reminds me a lot of Loudon Wainwright III (or, by extension, Loudon's son, Rufus Wainwright...)  On occasion he overplays his knowledge of the pop past: &quot;Tina Toledo's Street Walkin' Blues,&quot; for example, is just way too &quot;Sticky Fingers,&quot; and the baldness of the swipe is distracting.  (Besides, hipsters writing about hookers -- yawn.)  Overall though, this is a good album, nicely sculpted and quite listenable, though only tangentially &quot;country&quot;. I suspect that although his alt.country fans were put off by this, that the record's cachet will grow as time goes by. I'm not wild about this, but it's certainly worth checking out.
0316666343|5.0|When I first saw Alice Sebold's name, I knew it rang a bell. ...Reading THE LOVELY BONES was NOT a too sweet experience for me- the possibility of death during my bad experience was obviously something Sebold has thought about extensively and the idea that THIS book came from working that possibilty through gives me great hope for the survival of the species. Bravo, Alice! I was moved, and unbelievably entertained,throughout the entire book.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. I know many people hated it, but I guess that's the sort of movie it is (most of Kubrick's films are purely love/hate achievements). The film seems to be most famous due to the collabaration of Kubrick and Spielberg, but I think the story is great. The futurist fable plotline seems timeless and profound. And whatever you think of Spielberg's somewhat overbearing sentimentality, the acting cannot be faulted - Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law are two of the best actors around (and Teddy is the best character!). The special effects and design team create a really tangible atmosphere of the future; it all seems completely real. Maybe other people's opinions are useless in the case of this movie deeing how varied people's reactions are. Just see it anyway. Definitely worth buying in my opinion.
0316666343|5.0|When I first saw Alice Sebold's name, I knew it rang a bell. Sure enough, she's the author of LUCKY, a memoir of being raped in Thornden Park in Syracuse,N.Y., and the aftermath of that experience. I just happened to pick up that book a week after I bought a house about 2 blocks away from that crime scene. As a survivor of rape at 17 myself, it was an important read, though I felt that she must still have unfinished business about the event..Reading THE LOVELY BONES was NOT a too sweet experience for me- the possibility of death during my bad experience was obviously something Sebold has thought about extensively and the idea that THIS book came from working that possibilty through gives me great hope for the survival of the species.

B000002J1S|5.0|Simply, you must have this!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|First of all, my admiration and respect go out to Artisan Entertainment for their decision to release this film unrated, following the MPAA's deplorable and hypocrtical decision to award it an NC-17 rating.  <br />In the recently released Not Another Teen Movie, a girl defecates loudly and disgustingly in a toilet, only to have it fall through the floor and cover the students below in an oh so palatable melange of bodily discharges.  Explain to me the logic behind awarding a movie like that an R-rating and giving a masterpiece such as Requiem an NC-17 for a few seconds of explicit but very relevant sexual acts which are not at all excessive.  But anyway, enough bashing of the closed minded conservative lackeys who destroy art...back to the movie.<br />I must admit, I'm a sucker for Aronofsky's style.  It is his relentless, innovative, and unsparing style that makes this movie a masterpiece not just narratively, but also stylistically.  Anyone who enjoys watching cutting edge uses of conventional directorial techniques (e.g.--split screens, fast cuts, disorienting camera angles) will revel in the novelty of Aronofsky's bag-o'-tricks.<BR>The frenetic fifteen minute climax is a testament to Aronofsky's keen grasp of effective narrative.  Bravo Darren!!  Keep up the good work!<br />I cannot mention this movie without pointing out the remarkable performance of Ellen Burstyn.  Showing that acting is not all glamour, she spent four hours a day applying prosthetics and makeup to give the illusion of an overweight, lonely mother in the waning years of her life.  I'll be lucky if I can turn in a performance as good as this at 67-years-old!  Burstyn fills her character with an incredibly subtle blend of empty hopefulness, woeful naivete, and when appropriate, uncontrollable psychosis.  Strong, solid performances also given by Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto, and Marlon Wayans.<br />A word of warning:  Despite the heinous acts the four central characters commit, you WILL grow tolove them and root for them...and your spirits WILL be crushed when they crash and burn, and an unflattering realism will sink upon you like a ton of bricks.  The most heartbreaking part of their downfall is not even the manner in which happens, but that it EASILY could have been avoided. <br />The soundtrack adds icing to the cake.  I loved the Pi soundtrack (another Aronofsky film), but was disappointed when only three songs were original Clint Mansell tracks.  The soundtrack for Requiem is ALL Mansell, and it is a force to be reckoned with!  When I heard that the Kronos String Quartet (one of my favorite performing groups) was a dominant feature, I was ambivalently excited and confused.  How would a composer who does mostly electronica manage to effectively blend a string quartet with his style?  Needless to say...somehow it worked. The result is a haunting, jarring, surreal score which adds to Aronofsky's idiosyncratic style and accentuates the pervasively foreboding nature of the narrative.  Without the grotesque dissonances of the score, the disturbing nature of the film would have been halved. <br />I must concede that this movie is not for everyone.  But for me personally, the unusual combination of a dynamite soundtrack, spectacular acting, innovative and delectable direction, and altogether unsparring storytelling make this movie a 4-star opus.<BR>It is easily one of my all-time favorites.
B0000028RR|5.0|Rage Against The Machine came upon the scene in 1992 with this loud, brash, melodic self-titled classic. Suggesting the funky apathetic punk sensitibilities of The Clash or MC5 along with the swinging, anti-establishment attitude of Public Enemy, Rage set out and innovated while spewing out a message. <br />In a time filled with record company attempts to find another Nirvana, Rage ripped through with a sound that blended many influences: punk, hardcore, heavy metal, funk, hip hop, protest.<BR>This album never goes limp. All fifty-two minutes of &quot;Rage&quot; pack so much wallop without sounding all alike.<br />The key moments on &quot;Rage&quot; occur on the opening bombast of &quot;Bombtrack&quot;, opening with Zac Del Rocha's trademark &quot;bratty&quot; voice rapping and Tom Morello's masterful guitar playing ( his playing on 1999's &quot;The Battle of Los Angeles&quot; was damn near jaw-dropping!) with it's drudging drums. All this aderline is anchored by a political furor. No mindless screeching over redundant drum patterns (as with latterday &quot;metal&quot; acts such as Slipknot and the like). &quot;Settle For Something&quot; opens with a hushed interlude until landing into a guitar-based groove armed with Del Rocha's rants. &quot;Know Your Energy&quot;, &quot;Killing In The Name&quot;, &quot;Bullet In The Head&quot;, and &quot;Fistful of Fire&quot; all keep the momentum going. All heavy tracks that are head-nodding, fist-pumping, yet still has an insistent groove laid underneath. <br />Rage leaves us with a classic that along with the late, lamented (and underrated!) Faith No More predated the entire rap/rock genre that so many record companies have spun lesser(WAAYYY lesser) talented brand names brands of. Even if you're not a rock person, &quot;Rage Against The Machine&quot; will surely blow your mind. And it hasn't aged a day! <br />P.S.: Tom Morello is one of the greatest guitarists of today and he deserves more credit!
B00006J3WH|5.0|&quot;Once More with Feeling&quot; is a definitive &quot;Buffy&quot; episode.  It displays the zany humor of the show, the dark brooding emotions, and the daring ability to take risks by the show's cast and creator.  The cast's voices are good - not all great - but good and the songs honestly reflect the lives of the characters at this point in the show's development.  Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy)'s voice is occasionally flat, but her stunning &quot;Something to Sing About&quot; is a heartbreakingingly honest performance.  Other cast members whose voices excel include Amber Benson (magical Tara), Anthony Head (bookish Giles), and James Marsters (cynical vampire Spike).  All efforts are put forth to create an incredible piece of pop culture that outshines many of its predecessors and, most likely, many that will follow.
B000067CPX|5.0|Of course, people will say that the Red Hot Chili Peppers have &quot;sold out&quot; or &quot;gone soft&quot; or whatever else music snobs who think they know something say.  However, if one listens to By the Way more closely, one will see that the Chili Peppers have not sold out AT ALL.  Rather, they have expanded their sound to include more than just the punk-funk that put them on the map so long ago.  The music is top-quality, with almost every song featuring the Chili Peppers harmonizing beautifully, including on the tracks &quot;Universally Speaking&quot; and &quot;Tear&quot;.  To be sure, overall the album is soemwhat gentler on the ear, &quot;softer&quot; than their works prior to Californication.  However, there a few songs that see the Chili Peppers holding on to their punk-funk roots, such as the first single and title track &quot;By the Way&quot;, &quot;Can't Stop&quot;, and the anthemic &quot;Throw Away Your Television.&quot;  Anthony Keides's vocals are as sincere and yearning as ever, even in his &quot;white-boy rapping.&quot;  Still the clincher for this album is the absolutely awesome, never-disappointing guitar work by John Frusciante and Flea's outstanding bass.  The best thing about the album is the immense variety within it.  Each song is distinct- a VERY RARE thing it seems for modern rock albums these days.  With By the Way, one actually feels like they paid for AN ALBUM (many songs), rather than one continuous song that takes up an hour of disc time.  This innovative album is all thriller and absolutely no filler.  And that is precisely what makes By the Way the best rock album of the year.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is the second best animated motion picture ever, second only the other Disney classic, Fantasia.  This is perfect for everyone who loves romance, adventure, excitement, drama comedy and just having a good time watching a movie.<br />The animation is beautiful, but then again, every Disney movie is.  The colors are vibrant and you just can't take your eyes off of the screen.<br />The voices are perfect.  Close your eyes and listen to Gaston and you can't help but imagine a big hairy hunter with a bad attitude and a chest the size of a football field.  Paige O'Hara is the only person I would ever want to hear as Belle.  She has a beautiful voice, so innocent yet so daring when she needs to be.  She has the most glorious singing voice.  Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury are cast so perfectly.  I mean, I can't think of any other word but perfect for the voice casting in this movie.  I would love to go into more detail, but I can't think of anything beside perfect.  Chip is called Chip and he has a chip taken out of his cup.  How much better can you get?<br />The music, oh, the music is glorious.  It begins with a song and you're hooked.  It is a sweeping chorus number, both great music and lyrics.  The movie is a book and each song highlights a chapter.  Robbie Benson, whew, what a voice.  \\"Be Our Guest\\" is a rousing crowd pleaser that'll have you tapping your toes and hitting the rewind button to listen to it again and again so you can learn the words for the next time you sing along.  Broadway staple Angela Lansbury shines when she sings \\"Beauty And The Beast,\\" far better than Celine Dion and that other guys version.<br />This movie teaches you how love conquers all and that if it's worth doing for love, then it's worth doing at all.  Don't give up on your dreams, but then the Beast lets Belle leave.  But he coes it because he loves her and he knows what she has to do.  Then she comes back because she loves him and they live happily ever after.<br />This is the best animated movie since Fantasia and every animated movie that follows is going to have a big shadow to crawl out of.  It was more than worthy of its Academy Award nomination and I'm not ashamed to say that it could have very well benn, and probably should have been, the upset winner of the year.  Alas, it wasn't.  But to no avail.  It's on Broadway and it has a glorious and long overdue deluxe edition coming out on DVD and you can take it to the bank, I'm buying this on the first day of release.<br />Buy this movie.  Let your kids watch it.  Watch it yourself.  Watch it with your kids.  This is a classic story and is told as beautifully as ever before.  It is plain and simple the one movie that you just can't go wrong with.  Buy this movie, I give it my highest recommendation.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Very glad to finally get my hands on this. I really enjoyed the episode from last season(I'm wondering now if there is anything Joss can't do well), and had some of the songs playing on my own interior soundtrack -- couldn't get some of them out of my head. Standouts here are &quot;Under Your Spell&quot; where Amber Benson gets to show off her amazing pipes, and &quot;Walk Through the Fire&quot;, a powerful tune. Anthony Stewart Head also betrays an incredible singing talent here, especially on &quot;Standing&quot;.<br />An extra treat is the inclusion here of some of the orchestral music from other Buffy episodes by Christophe Beck. I wish they would put out another cd compiling his work for the series; if Xena could get numerous soundtrack cds, we deserve at least one more for Buffy.<br />And to top it all off, the cd booklet has a cover and illustrations by comics art god Adam Hughes.<br />Do yourself a favor and get this today. Grr, Aargh.

B00005UEAR|2.0|This album sounds a lot like falling into infinity. Very weak compositions. It does not capture the magic of awake.
B00006F7S4|2.0|First off, I love just about everything Beck has done to date, even some of the more folky, country sounding stuff. This release goes even further down that trail. It definitly has a certain melancholy mood that flows thoughout the cd. What's got you so down Beck?<br />To be fair, I have only listened to it once so maybe it isn't fair to rate this yet; but I really haven't heard anything on this album that stands out. <br />Unless you really love the slower and more mellow aspects of Mutations, you will probably be disappointed. This is not the funky, sampled, radio friendly Beck here.
B00005JKED|4.0|I think this was a real enjoyable movie, and it was great to see Denzel in a role other than the stoic good guy role.  Ethan Hawke was also excellent in this, and he didn't seem like he was intimidated by performing with Denzel.  That being said, I really don't think Denzel deserved to win best actor for this movie, and it should have gone to Russel Crowe for his performance in &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;.  Denzel should have won the Oscar for &quot;X&quot;, which was actually a better performance by him.  This is still a very good movie though, one that you can easily watch again without getting bored.
B000000W5L|5.0|this album sounds like no other Stones' album. Recorded in the band's house  in a makeshift basement studio, it is the result of the purest form of the Stones' studio mentality. That mentality is, (quoting from Keith) \\"The Stones don't go into the studio to record an album, as such. They just go in to record.<br />Why in a house? The band was all staying there (they moved away from Britain to avoid  The Tax Man, British PM Mr. Heath) to regroup after the disastrous ending of the '69 tour, and they were broke because of the legal mess of leaving Allen Klein's management and ABCKO/London Records was still not over after three years.<br />Anyway-- What followed was chemistry at its best with an intimacy not found on any other album I've ever heard. Complaints of \\"non-studio\\" production are unwarranted. Sure, it's rough, but it adds greatly to this album's charm. <br />This is the Stones' masterpiece. Showing they could rock, get surreally hazy (with effectiveness-- much unlike Satanic Maj. Request) , and delve far into country and gospel flavors.<br />Side one (tracks1-5) are rockers-- each with a distinctive tempo. Rip This Joint is full blown bar boogie at its best. You can't beat Keith's yowling on Casino Boogie. It's the best Mick/Keith combo vocal. I can never decide which one to really listen to.  Keith never really sings lead, but its the perfect compliment.<br />Side 2 (6-9) gets country-druggie and beautiful. Around this time. the Stones bumped around with Gram Parsons of The Byrds and The Flying Burrito Brothers. This takes California country rock to the top. Sweet Black Angel is a great campfire song. It all climaxes with Loving Cup-- almost an Appalachain ballad. I could hear Rickie Lee Jones covering it.<br />Side 3: the drugs really kick in. Ventilator Blues slips into Just Wanna See His Face, which fades into Let It Loose. This album features a tremendous brass  section on on that tune, it really shines. <br />Let it Loose also perfectly sets up anothergreat rocker to open side 4, \\"All Down The Line.\\" It's as if the band woke up to finish the album. Great horns and back-up singers with tight hooks and urgent vocals. A cover of Robert Johnson's \\"Stop Breaking Down\\" showcases Mick Taylor's guitar along with some great harp work by the other Mick. (Incidentally, that's the 2nd R.J. cover the Stones have done-- the first being \\"Love In Vain\\") The album finishes with 2 songs-- \\"Shine A Light,\\" (perhaps their heaviest foray into gospel along with \\"Just Wanna See His Face\\" from side 3), and \\"Soul Survivor.\\" Soul Survivor finds Taylor and Keith trading licks and the Mick with the back up singers in full force.<br />My wife was fortunate enought to see them on this tour. I was too young for concerts in '72. But I always thought it would be great to see Mick at his most androgynous and Keith at his most heroin-addicted.
0784011214|3.0|With this sequel to the excellent first film, America has decided to get rid of its bad conscience. \\"First Blood\\" took place in America, dealing with the difficult and disturbing question of reinsertion of Nam veterans in the American society. This question's been erased for this sequel, located in the Viet-nam jungle. The movie has the same basis than the one in \\"Escape from New York\\" - a prisoner sent in hell for a rescue mission, with pardon and freedom offered in exchange -; here, the hell is Viet-nam, the police is replaced by the army and the gangs of New York, by bloody Russians and Vietnamese soldiers. James \\"Titanic\\" Cameron, who wrote the script with Stallone, started in movie business working on the Carpenter film; he took its basis element and used it for \\"Rambo 2\\". In \\"First Blood\\", the enemy was American, and Rambo killed only one person, and not on purpose, it was self-defense; in this movie the enemy's Russian and Vietnamese, so Rambo can do everything he wants, and this is the starting for a long and heavy butchery, especially when they kill his girlfriend. But the whole is watchable anyway.<br />The final message is very beautiful but also utopic. Who cares how brave the G.I. were in Viet-nam, no matter the guts they gave; they lost the war. And America hates losers, everybody knows that.

B00005Y228|5.0|Of course, I bought this CD because of one song.....Can't Get You Outta My Head..... But I love every song on the album! It's good dance music, even though I don't dance. But It's great to listen to. I love all the songs...ROCK ON KYLIE
B00006AG5N|5.0|This CD is unbelievable, a great collection of hits with greatly improved sound. It also includes his lastest smash &quot;A little less conversation&quot; which went no.1 in 18 countries. Folks Elvis's voice was great before but on this CD he sounds like he's singing in your living room, you will no be disappointed. When you hear Suspicious Minds it will send a chill down your back it's so great.

0393317552|2.0|Diamond's book suffers from a bad case of schizophrenia. He apparently couldn't decide what he was trying to write. It isn't really a book and it isn't really a scientific paper. <br />As a book, it suffers from an almost total lack of editing and organization. Diamond must have labored under the false impression that he was getting paid by the word. His writing is stilted, rambling, and simply atrocious. A ruthless editor could have pared this down to a readable, interesting book of about 100 pages.<br />As a scientific paper, it is laughable. Of course, by publishing his personal guesses and speculation intermixed with generally accepted science, he neatly avoided experiencing a humiliating peer review and rejection.<br />Diamond begins his investigation with a concious bias-- he clearely stated that his purpose was to parry the &quot;race- based&quot; view of civilized development. He then builds his case by accepting that which bolsters his arguments and discarding that which disagrees with his thesis. This approach &quot;ain't science.&quot; I can't argue with Diamond's conclusion but his case is weak.<br />Outside of his New Guinea experiences (which we hear about ad infinitum) and his area of expertise, he is simply speculating on the possible causes of a known result. Diamond is trying to build a whole dinosaur out of a tiny bone fragment. <br />The concluding remarks include the obligatory appeal for &quot;further funding&quot;-- the usual self-serving phrase heard so often these days. Diamond reveals his desire to elevate weak &quot;scientific&quot; disciplines to the level of hard science-- math, physics, chemistry, etc. and this harebrained idea simply diminishes his stature and-- indirectly-- his scientific credibility.<br />As for the glowing reviews from others-- P.T. Barnum was right!
B00003CXAY|2.0|Granted, Koyaanisqatsi had a certain freshness and art-house novelty when it was first released, and the cinematography (which was better realized in Baraka, and accompanied by better music) is worthwhile, but the unspeakably obvious latter-day Luddite point is hammered home in the first 20 minutes. Many of the images have poetry, yes, but you can't make an epic poem of a haiku. Powaqqatsi ranks several notches below its predecessor, and is scarcely worth even a first viewing. The remastered dolby digital sound is great--if only it revealed anything worth hearing after five minutes. I can't fathom why anyone would want to watch either film more than once. I know of no one who has seen either who didn't prefer Ron Fricke's (director of photography for both of these films) Baraka instead. No wonder he didn't return for Reggio's final installment of the trilogy, Naqoyqatsi. He prefers his sleep aids in the over-the-counter format.
B000002IOJ|5.0|What can I say for this album? Is it the best trash metal album ever? I do think so..not only because it gives you the will to buy every Testament cd, but also because it explains you what metal is all about: it's not only heavy sounds..it's an unforgivable voice letting you feel the power of your inner strength, and melodies that carry elements of destiny. What is Heavy Metal? It's life...What is his album in terms of music? It's a hopeful perception of life giving you every wonderful and sad elements of the human being.. How did they do that? They had two strange guitarists: a crazy dragonlord (Eric Peterson) and a wannabe jazzman (Alex Skolnick), and they had a singer that gives you all his life when he begins to feel the rythm..Chuck Billy is my heroe and I hope he is going to feel better after these terrible days of sickness..I'm not a fan! I just really appreciate their music and I receive everything I need from this album! \\"The time is coming...\\" Wow! You really should buy this cd!
B000051VWW|4.0|After hearing music from this album on the radio, I decided to buy the CD.  Glad I did.  I always remembered the old originals from Sade.  This album is truly on of the best.
B0000636UN|4.0|Sheryl is in her prime, and this album shows it.  Always coming up with a fun summer song, she delivers a few of them on this hit filled album.  Too many albums these days have one hit, or less and the record companies push them anyway.  Crow is a proven veteran who has bypassed her critics and had a successful career throughout the 90's.  This album is fun, upbeat, and a triumph for Sheryl Crow, I highly recommend it.
6303522440|5.0|I suspect this is one of those love or hate movies depending on whether or not it strikes an emotional cord within the viewer. To those used to such absolutes as plot and action it will be a bust. To those who love the David Lean directorial approach of each scene being a visual image that could stand alone, then this is a treat. I believe the title is Italian for I remember, and this is what the movie is. Fellini's reminscences of growing up in pre-war Italy. They are presented as a series of linked vignettes populated with an extravagant and eccentric collection of characters. Wonderfully evocative, lewd and bawdy, funny and sad, it's a languid walk through one man's memories. I don't collect movies but this is one I own and love to dip into once in a while. It's a treasure to be savoured when the world gets too heavy and we begin to take ourselves too seriously. I love it.
6305428298|5.0|I've been reading these wonderful reviews and noticing that many of them question why this movie wasn't recognized by the Academy Awards. Of course, it should have been. But I think it started when the film wasn't nominated for the Golden Globe. While it's true that three of the major cast members were nominated and Michael Caine deservedly won for Best Actor, the Hollywood Foreign Press neglected to nominate the film. Which is strange because it would've been under the category of \\"Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical\\"...and I can think of no other movie in recent memory that fits that category so perfectly, as it is both musical and funny. \\"Little Voice\\" was certainly more worthy than the critically-panned Robin Williams medical comedy, \\"Patch Adams\\", which was nominated! <BR>Anyway, that year \\"Shakespeare In Love\\" was taking all the awards. There's no way that Gweneth Paltrow gave a better performance in a comedy/musical than Jane Horrocks, but Paltrow and her movie had more power and influence that year. Both films were distributed by MIRAMAX who apparently decided they'd have a better shot at winning awards if they concentrated more effort promoting \\"Shakespeare In Love\\" rather than the smaller, lesser seen \\"Little Voice\\"...which led to so few nominations come Oscar-time. I found it ironic that Brenda Blethyn was the only acting nomination for the Academy Award since her performance was the weakest, in my opinion. But at least it was a nomination. There was no excuse for Mr. Caine to be ignored. I read somewhere that the academy would've had no problem nominating Caine for SUPPORTING actor rather than lead. But (a) his role is definately a LEAD role, and (b) this is the same Academy that nominated Hollywood-favorite Dustin Hoffman for lead actor in \\"Wag The Dog\\" in what was basically a supporting role. <BR>Either way, the movie got screwed. But at least some of us recognize this film's brilliance and originality. I like it when movies surprise me and show mesomething different. \\"Little Voice\\" does that and so much more.
B000066I6N|2.0|If you like (as I do) Plant's previous solo efforts, you won't necessarily go for this one. Plant's vocals are as good as ever, maybe even the best ever...but the songs don't rock. At all.<br />After a solo career that had seen Plant get better and better with each album, I was really looking forward to this, his first solo release since 1993's Fate of Nations. I was disappointed.
B00006AG5N|5.0|I've never heard Elvis sound so good! Crisp,clear,up-front Elvis vocals,not the muddy mixes heard before,just the right balance of everything.I heard little details in the songs, such as a guitar lick or a piano that are more prominent than before.Songs such as: &quot;Return to Sender&quot; - Elvis' emphasis on the words seem to be stronger because of the clarity of the song.<BR>&quot;Suspicios Minds&quot;...&quot;because I love you to much,baby&quot;,where Elvis' vocal is so clear it seems like Elvis just hangs onto the word &quot;baby&quot;. &quot;Burning Love&quot; - I noticed the guitar licks are heard more up front than before.All 30 songs,plus &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot;(JXL Remix),as a bonus song, sound as if recorded just yesterday.80 minutes of pure enjoyment for the true Elvis fan or a good introduction to the music of Elvis Presley. Elvis' voice is never more appreciated than on this remastered CD, where a person can grasp the true depth and beautiful,pure voice that Elvis Presley was blessed with.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Tell me a story.<br />In essence, that is all we as consumers of entertainment demand when we open a book or watch a movie.  Yes, we may have our reservations (e.g., &quot;I don't like the actor&quot;...&quot;This is not historically accurate&quot;...&quot;This plot has been presented thousands of times before&quot;...), but in the end, ultimately, the triumphant success--or lack thereof--of any work is wholly dependent on its ability to tell a gripping, compelling story.<br />Ridley Scott gives us a story in GLADIATOR.  From the opening scenes in barbaric Germania, to the bowels of dusty dungeons in distant lands, to the eye-opening magnificence of the Roman Coliseum, to the wondrous luxury of the palace of Emperor Commodus, GLADIATOR tells a moving, thrilling, harrowing story of heroism and revenge.  At the end of this film, when an avenged Maximus is finally able to join his murdered wife and son in the afterlife, I as a viewer experienced completion...the story had been told.<br />Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielson, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris and company give exceptional performances.  GLADIATOR is an epic.  An epic story.
0393317552|5.0|As an avid reader with absolutely no previous contact with the field of anthropology, I found this book to be mesmerizing.  Jared Diamond has achieved great success with \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" (national best-seller, Pulitzer Prize), but it has also made him the target of strident, often venomous criticism...<br /><br />Diamond's general thesis is that the West conquered the world rather than vice versa because of a fluke of nature.  In short, Eurasia was home to an important number of crops and animals that readily lent themselves to successful domestication.  This domestication resulted in mass food production, which the author claims is the \\"ultimate\\" cause of Western dominance.  Food production, in turn, led to a number of \\"proximate\\" causes related to the rise of the West: farms and animal herds led to stationary populations and excess food to support a specialized class of bureaucrats and soldiers; it also increased population density, which, along with close contact with animals, led to germs and the subsequent genetic resistance of Westerners to those diseases.  Finally, Diamond concludes, the unique East-West axis of Eurasia and the absence of any impenetrable geographic barriers fostered the spread of new crops, technologies, etc., which gave rise to many competing communities, whose competition further increased the western lead over the rest of the world.<br /><br />Diamond's arguments are persuasive on the surface, and even the biggest skeptic will have reason for pause after reading his book.  However, the final chapter reveals that he can't really resolve a fundamental question: why did Europe, rather than the Middle East, India or China come to conquer the world?  Almost the entire book is dedicated to explaining why the Eurasian landmass was blessed with the prerequisites for large civilizations rather than the Americas, Africa and Australia.  His terse explanation for why Europe in particular dominated leaves much to be desired and explained.<br /><br />In this reviewer's opinion, the recent book by classicist Victor Davis Hanson (\\"Carnage and Culture\\") provides a plausible epilogue for Diamond's piece.  Hanson completely and explicitly rejects Diamond's geographic determinism, but I don't think the two theses are incompatible or in any way mutually exclusive.  In fact, it seems to me that Diamond and Hanson support one another, as the latter's assertion that the war-making efficiency of liberal democracies beginning in the Hellenistic period explains Europe's ultimate triumph.<br /><br />In closing, as an introduction to anthropology and a cogent depiction of one school of thought on the rise of the West this book is marvelous.  Approach it with an open-mind, reflect on the thesis and the supporting evidence, and then draw your own conclusions.  Love it or hate it, you owe it to yourself to read this book.wer's opinion, the recent book by classicist Victor Davis Hanson (\\"Carnage and Culture\\") provides a plausible epilogue for Diamond's piece.

0312265859|5.0|\\"Hard Eight\\" by Janet Evanovich is the latest instalment in the fantastic Stephanie Plum series, and it is well worth the hardcover price!  Evanovich leads Stephanie, our favourite bumbling bounty hunter, on a dark and dangerous adventure that had me utterly captivated the whole way through.  \\"Hard Eight\\" is certainly one of the darkest books in this series, but not to worry, the laugh-out-loud humour that we have come to expect from a Stephanie Plum novel is there too!<br />In this eighth instalment of the series, Stephanie gets a request that is really not in her field of work.  It seems that Evelyn Soder and her young daughter Annie have gone on the run, leaving behind a hostile and very angry ex-husband who's about to invoke the child-custody bond on Annie and cause Evelyn's grandmother (Stephanie's parents' next-door-neighbour) Mabel Markowitz, to lose her home.  So as a favour to Mabel, Stephanie agrees to look into things and try to find Evelyn and Annie.<br />But it soon becomes evident that this is a really nasty situation, nastier than anything that Stephanie has been up against before.  Eddie Abruzzi, a very shady and scary local businessman and Evelyn's landlord, threatens Stephanie to give up her search for Evelyn immediately when she has a run-in with him while checking out Evelyn's home.  But why would Abruzzi care if Stephanie finds Evelyn?  Abruzzi's reaction has Stephanie very suspicious, and when she refuses to drop this case, Abruzzi declares war on her.  Hunh??<br />It seems to Stephanie that Abruzzi is more than a little nutty, but when someone leaves a bag of snakes on her doorknob, tarantulas in her car, and a dead body is left on her couch she realizes she is in serious trouble.  So, it is time to get some help, and the best person for the job is her mentor Ranger, who Stephanie already owes too many favours.  At the end of \\"Seven Up\\" readers were left wondering what would happen between Stephanie and Ranger, and in \\"Hard Eight\\" things between these two really heat up.  But Joe Morelli, Stephanie's ex-fiancé, isn't entirely out of the picture, and he ends up getting involved in this case too. <br />But Ranger and Morelli aren't the only ones trying to help Steph.  Evelyn's correspondence school lawyer, the annoying yet lovable Albert Kloughn, has latched himself onto Stephanie and just won't go away.  We get to know Stephanie's sister Valerie much better in this book, and Grandma Mazur is hilarious as usual with her utterly inappropriate comments and her unique attitude towards life in general.  Lula, the 200+lb ex-hooker is along for the ride too, and she always manages to make me laugh.  It is always a pleasure to read a Stephanie Plum novel, and spend time with Evanovich's hysterically funny, eccentric, and perhaps most important, likable characters.  No one wants to read about people they don't like, and Evanovich has created a wonderful cast of characters who readers can root for and relate to as they follow them through their adventures.<br />\\"Hard Eight\\" is a great read, and I loved every minute of it.  As Stephanie gets more and more caught up in the terrifying games Abruzzi is playing with her, while still following the trail that leads to Evelyn and Annie, the suspense builds very effectively.  The climax of this book had me quite literally on the edge of my seat, and I was so absorbed in it I wouldn't have put the book down for love nor money!  But Evanovich expertly balances the darkness in this book with plenty of light moments, and the result is one highly compelling and all-around fabulous read.  \\"Hard Eight\\" is a book that you really don't want to miss, and I highly recommend it!
B00006AG5N|5.0|Another Elvis Greatest Hits? Yes, but not just another. Credit must be given to the incredible job the production team have done as these well-known and well-loved tracks sound fresher than ever before. This is particularly true of Don't Be Cruel, Return To Sender and She's Not You. Elvis' voice has never sounded clearer on any disc and it's an absolute joy to hear his vocals in such clarity, even on songs which are so well known.<BR>Mention must also be made of two alternate takes (not listed as such on the CD case): A Fool Such As I features Hank Garland and not Scotty Moore on the instrumental break, while a slightly re-worded The Wonder Of You is included, from Las Vegas in February 1970, a different show than the &quot;original&quot; version.<BR>I own dozens of Elvis albums, many featuring these songs, and I did initially hesitate about buying this; having decided to add it to my collection, I'm glad I did, and so will you be.

Chicago sounds very well in this tracks, with all the power of the early years with the original members. The new version of Dialogue, however, has not news: is practically the same. If Chicago V is a extraordinary (jazz styled) album, this extension<BR>worths if you are intrested in know the extense posibilities of the band in these years.

038533558X|2.0|This is exactly the same premise and plot as &quot;Tell No One&quot;, complete with the ueber-psycho hit man, a girlfriend who works with the homeless (really!), and a totally benevolent, gotta-love-him main character.  Both of them were reasonably enjoyable page turners, but it was hard to enjoy what was essentially the same story.  My best advice would be to pick one or the other (and they're both equally implausible, so flip a coin) and then don't read the other one.

But, minus the thinking part, this incredible story did just that.  It took me forever to read (that's not a negative comment)  partly because I got so involved in it that I often backtracked to double check the nuances that I may have missed.  I don't think I could handle reading the \\"guide\\" to this novel without losing the lingering aftertaste of pleasure... keeping in mind that I read it nearly two years ago and haven't even seen a copy since.<br />A.S. Byatt's masterful pen draws you into two separate stories connected only by the latter's investigation into the first.  Sound complicated?  For anyone else it truly would be but Byatt never caught me in confusion about who we were talking about nor how it related to the other.  And in the end it is almost if the obsession has become your own as well.  I've rarely found that level of involvement with any other author.<br />This story is A MUST if your are any fan of plausible  historical fiction. And a DEFINITELY SHOULD if you are simply a fan of excellent stories.  Don't expect simple but neither should you be intimidated by the more scholarly reviews it seems to be receiving lately.  This a book for everyone.  You simply take it in to whatever level you pursue.<br />I'm eagerly awaiting the movie.
B00004Z1MN|5.0|I fell in love with \\"Frequency\\" by accident. The film's original promos played up the 'change your destiny' aspect of the plot more than the father-son bond, and I guess I thought there'd be some souped-up DeLorean auto waiting in the wings to whisk characters somewhere every 10 minutes. But this film is nothing like that. I lost my mother sixteen years ago and have only bonded stronger with my dad since then, and as such, really relate to the film's subtler message of re-affirming ties with those you love the most. It doesn't hit immediately. When detective Jim Caviezel first speaks to fireman Dennis Quaid, they are understandably confused and pseudo-annoyed with each other, because they do not yet understand what has happened between them. Later, of course, the 30-year paradox is revealed, and a new relationship emerges after Quaid survives a potentially life-ending fire. The duo-logue which follows between father and son over the ham radio is a breathtaking scene, and when it comes to an end (\\"I'm almost afraid to turn this off- like we won't get this back\\"), I'm a tearful mess, every single time. But I *am* smiling. It seems that many critics were less than impressed with the story's sentiment (not surprising), but it's a wonderful little story which celebrates the nobler side of the human spirit. Buy. See.

This album features songs written by Winter and producer Rick Derringer, as well as covers of songs by the Rolling Stones and the Hoodoo Rhythm Devils.

0385503954|4.0|You can almost see this on your local PBS station.  The opening story is set on an estate in England in the years between the wars.  Money is easy, people are happy, a little girl is growing up spoiled.  I found my stomach turning over as i so eaily identified with this child and yet didn't like her.  What a combination!  Even though the book is divided up into three stories, the first story with the little girl sets the others in motion. <br />Then you hit the war and the book changes.  It is a graphic, painful depiction of the war in France - most notably the waste of human lives and history.  Think the first twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan.<br />The third story goes back to London, into the hospital wards during the war.  Back tot he little girl, grown up and trying to become a better person than a little girl.  Trying to atone.<br />I thought the book was very good, very well written.  Parts of it will stay with me always.  This sounds like a school book report.  Sorry!
0345404475|4.0|This book has a huge cult following, as does Blade Runner (which was based on the book, in case for some reason you don't know this). But it didn't quite live up to what I expected it to be. Philip K. Dick is a great writer. And DADES is a great book, but I just didn't think that was all it was said to be. Perhaps his other books are the ones that hit you.

0140185232|4.0|The Razor's Edge came recommend to me from a source I trust. And while it hasn't made my list of greatest books written, it is a good book to read. It's tough to give a synopsis of the book, since like so many other British writers there isn't much of a plot, more of a portrait of a group within society. I guess you could say it is the story of Larry Darrell's search for God. But it only touches on spiritual matters. It doesn't go into the discussion we hope for. (If you're looking for a treatise on spirituality, read Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, Kerouac's The Dharma Bums, and Anne Rice's Tale of the Body Theif) Maugham himself is a character and narrator of the book. He sort of reminds me of Nick in The Great Gatsby, but only a little. Maugham is a part of the action, but still separate from it. What this book reminds me of is a work by Jane Austen, but written better (I'm known for my dislike of Austen's work). I don't really get into Brit lit from the 18th and 19th centuries, but this book reminds me of that period. But written in such a way I found I enjoyed it. There isn't much linear structure to the novel. A lot of the action takes place in flashback, or in stories told in flashbacks. But Maugham keeps the reader from being confused. The book reads like a book. You know how some stories draw you in, to the point where you are a part of the story? The Razor's Edge isn't like that. You always feel like you are reading a book written by the narrator or that the narrator is telling you the story. There is a distance between the reader and the narrator and the narrator and the story. I think that is what holds the book back.

6304698798|5.0|The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti western. This is the one everyone remembers. It's shot in Spain, where the terrain looks similar to the American west, but gives it its special feel. The cinematography is a beautiful job. Ennio Morricone's score takes on the aspects of another character in the film, and it has become synonymous with the american west. this is an all time classic. great film, i love the fact that there is no dialogue for the first 10 minutes of the film. really shows what movies are meant to be. the dvd also contains about 15 minutes of footage deleted from the u.s. version (it's in italian). <br />this is just one of those movies everyone loves and everyone should own.

B000002J1O|5.0|This album is one of the greatest pieces of recorded music ever released.  It is the album that broke Genesis in America.  One listen will show you why.  And why Steve Hackett is the best guitarist ever recorded.
0767817648|5.0|What can be said about Blue Thunder? It is an excellent action and political techno-thriller with a fine cast, solid plot, good special effects, excellent aerial stunt work, cinemaphotography, musical soundtrack, and the like. It is also a movie with a serious message. Much like the conspiracy thriller Seven Days In May, this film really captures the action and suspense, let alone the old saying of how one man can make a difference. If you enjoy the works of Roy Scheider, Malcolm McDowell, Daniel Stern, director John Badham, and the others who labored hard on the 1982-1983 production, be sure to check out Blue Thunder. Or if you enjoy avaition, check out the film. You won't be disappointed.<br />If you also get a chance, be sure to check out Andrew Gilchrist's website devoted to the film. There is even a cool sequel written to the 1983 film.
B000002J27|5.0|When Peter Gabriel announced during the summer of 1975 that he was leaving Genesis, everyone on FM radio lamented the loss of a truly great band before they truly got off the ground.  Every station I listened to said the same thing-&quot;it's too bad.&quot;  They could not have been more wrong.  &quot;Selling England By The Pound&quot; had showcased the collective talents of Genesis like no other album before it.  &quot;A Trick Of The Tail&quot; showed everyone it really wasn't Peter's band.  This album proved (perhaps legitimized) what early fans knew, that Genesis was a once-in-a-lifetime collection of incredibly gifted musicians and talented songwriters.  Their great chops jump off this record.  None more noticably than Steve Hackett's virtuoso guitar playing.  &quot;Dance On A Volcano&quot; gives one extreme, &quot;Entangled&quot; the other.  And his solo on &quot;Ripples&quot; is legendary.
B000068TPN|4.0|It's about time Hollywood started making pictures that show what war is really like.  War should not be glorified!  Only the ones that fight should be.  It is good to see that a military leader can do his job as a soldier and still be a moral and caring individual.  The mark of a true leader is to lead by example and gain respect of his troops.  This movie shows that a military commander can be a religious man and still be able to kill his enemy and, because of his beliefs, gain the respect and admiration of the men that served under him in battle.

6305358613|4.0|Elizabeth manages to re-create the beautiful world of the Renaissance. From the breathtaking settings to the costuming, it makes you feel in the era.<br />But what most makes this film work is the superb cast. Headed by Cate Blanchett deliciously playing the title role, everyone fills out their characterizations to become multi-faceted. And Blanchett commands this film from her thrown, fully deserving all the praise she has received.<br />Following the trail as Elizabeth goes from princess to her rocky start as queen, the film captures the spirit of the era with the music, bawdy humor and language. It's easy to slip into the time and forget the modern world around you.<br />Virtually perfectly paced, the film feels comprehensive in telling the tale of the queen's start, and makes you thirsty for knowledge on her reign. And that's how you tell if a historical film works: If it makes you want to learn more about its subject. Elizabeth does just that.<br />For lovers of film and historical fiction, Elizabeth delivers on all levels.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Having bought this film on recommendation from a friend, I was scared to see what I was spending my money on. Hedwig tells a rather unusual story about a gay guy losing his man-hood so he can be married and come to the US. Yeah, I don't have anything in common with that either. But what I do have in common with Hedwig is just about every other emotion. Hedwig finds love, loses love, and can't let go of the past sometimes. The movie is like an hour and 1/2 rock video that stirred my emotions and had me empathizing with Hedwig, since the story is one of seeking love, seeking acceptance, seeking success, and freedom, and not to mention it is also very humorous at some points as well. I think almost anyone can relate to this movie at least in part. It is a musical but the music doesn't come across in the same manner as Sound of Music. The music fits the story and is cleverly mixed in with dialogue, hand-drawn cartoons and performances. I've watched it 5 times. I've shown it to 4 of my friends and they loved it and were surprised by it too. DVD also has a great documentary that will teach you a ton about how Hedwig started as a punk-rock drag number that eventually went Off-Broadway and then to film. I recommend this one very highly!
B00000IYWH|5.0|...and one of the best CD re-issues, as well.  If the original LP pressing of this album had included \\"Are You Lonseome Tonight?\\", \\"A Mess of Blues\\", and \\"It's Now Or Never\\" at the time of its original release, this easily would have qualified as the best rock & roll album ever recorded.  In this re-issue format, the argument for it is incredibly strong.<br />><br />This is a remarkably well-rounded collection of material, with a stellar collection of pop tunes, romantic croonings, raving rockers (\\"Such A Night\\" got a bit of a shot-in-the-arm with \\"3000 Miles to Graceland\\", and as out-of-place as it may have sounded on that film's soundtrack CD, it absolutely grooves here), and some of the best blues tunes The King ever belted out this side of \\"Santa Claus is Back in Town\\".  \\"It Feels So Right\\" may be the tamest of the NAS-TEE blues on this album, and that says a lot.  \\"A Mess of Blues\\" is top-notch, but \\"Reconsider Baby\\" sets the standard even higher, and \\"Like a Baby\\" is just flat-out RAUNCHY.  I don't know if a singer has ever come across as being as inspired as Elvis was on this album (except perhaps for Elvis during the '68 Comeback Special, but it speaks volumes about The King when the only one with whom he can compare is himself).<br />><br />The main problem is that this CD is AWFULLY bloody difficult to find; its availability is sketchy at best and pricy at worst.  I was able to get ahold of an Argentinian copy (viva albiceleste!) via an online auction, and I don't notice any issues with its quality.  I will be happy to provide a contact source for anyone who isn't successful finding a domestic copy or a different imported version; I assure you that you will feel 10 times rewarded when you listen to it, regardless of its pressing origin.  TCB, baby!<br />>
0060977493|5.0|I am currently reading this book for the third time, and everytime it is as fresh as new. The book is a 321 page poetry, enchanting, captivating and mesmerizing, every page with a distinct kind of life dissolved into it. Rahel is definitely an image of the author herself, I started to believe. The story is about a small incident on a rainy night, but seen from past, present and future, spread over years. Like a spider spinning a web, the story too converges to the single incident and why the incident is so important. Roy has invented her own language, her own flow, with characters like Terror, Fear, Happiness etc., all blended into a sad stream of events with very little happiness, redefining love, whom to be loved and how much. I would recommend readers to read this book atleast twice to get the inner beauty of this Booker winning novel. Hats off to Arundhati Roy.
B000007U6V|5.0|OK, the other reviews say it very well. If I can add a few thoughts: This is the first piece I heard by KW, like many others. I heard both the short and long versions repeatedly on the radio and then bought the import version (blue/white cover). I put it on my dad's stereo (I was 14 and they were out) and turned the lights out and the volume up, and went on my first musical trip (no pot!). When I thought &quot;gee this must be over soon&quot; another incredible passage would come, the cars honking with the churning beat box rhythm, the noise bursts panning left-right in time with the rhythm, the lovely flute/synth layered with echo with the arpeggiated moog in the background, then the re-capitulation back to the original key. I was amazed. It was the longest track I'd ever heard (Didn't hear Genesis' &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; till a bit later). When I put on the other side, unfortunately the LP was rather scratched. I never really heard this side as I would always be put off by the scratches. I listened again recently and would say that side 2 is more minimalistic, and not representative of the best KW, but it's kind of where their past meets their future. While the title track is an electro-acoustic experiment combined with pop music and progressive ideas, side 2 is a little more electronic I think, with my side 2 fave I suppose being Mitternacht, where those noise-drops just hit you square in the chest each time, like footsteps in the night, or Chinese water torture. Psycho-acoustic trauma! Even though, this could be called an ambient piece. At least each tune on side 2 is based on a solid musical concept, and true of all KW, no FILLER! A note on the sound of this album, it is truly crystal clear with beautiful warm production, and great stereo effects. Of the previous KW I have only heard K2, which I really enjoyed, thought it is definetly more improvisational and electro-acoustic than straight electronic. Like all great artists, KW started with an idea then expanded and developed it. Never ones to follow commercial trends, they eventually created their own, and Autobahn had a lot to do with establishing that. <BR>So remember, this is not their best ALL-AROUND album but the tune Autobahn truly makes this one of the greatest and most important albums ever. If you are a KW fan and you don't have this, then get it!

B000002GYI|5.0|This album has all the KW trademarks, but there is a lot more singing on this album. The tunes are strong, and there is a lot of charm to this album. My fave is definetly Pocket Calculator, but other tunes are more serious, like Computer Love, foreshadowing 1-900 dating. In the top 3 with Man Machine and Autobahn. Electric Cafe is also sure to please. All the KW albums have different aesthetics, CW is warm and crisp, and very toe-tapping and catchy, and not as serious as Man machine. A delight.
B000059TPI|5.0|Each time I watch this wonderful movie about the shades of gray we use to cement together the brickwork of our lives, I think of James Stewart's comment in the trailer at the beginning of the movie as he describes doing the original play on the road, when invariably some kid in the audience would loudly ask, \\"Where's the rabbit\\"? Where is he indeed! I wanna see the damned rabbit, too!  Yet this thought-provoking parable about what is real and what isn't and the shades of each we use to try to live our lives as best we can, remains one of the all-time favorites of people who love to watch movies.<br />James Stewart portrays Elwin P. Dowd as a more than slightly-tipsy drinker who happens to enjoy the company of his constant company Harvey, a six-foot- something invisible (and imaginary?)  rabbit. Now all of the terrific character actors in the film are of one opinion or another about the rabbit, but all agree that Dowd is an altogether pleasant man who everyone enjoys having around. Yet his incessant and insistent ramblings about Harvey make him an embarrassment, and some of them are honestly concerned about him. So what to do about Elwin? And what do you think about the rabbit?<br />As for me, I prefer to think the rabbit is real, but chooses to be invisible. More interesting that way. And you have to admit the porch swing does rock without anyone else on it in the last scene, after all. I've tried the rabbit routine a few times when in a particularly whimsical mood, and it always brings smiles and conversation. So what's wrong with having a big albeit invisible rabbit as a drinking chum? A guy could do a lot worse. See the movie; it is a bona-fide classic. I have to give this one two thumbs WAY UP! Enjoy!
B000007R1M|5.0|After Trans Europe Express came MM. I suppose one could say this really defined their sound, image and approach. It is very slick compared to other albums up to Computer World (which was their next release) but has a warm sound not really found on any of their albums. The Robots is a perfect Kraftwerk track, with vocoder vocals and electronic themes everywhere. This song also (for me) had the most obvious reference to the Soviets, where a robotic Russian voice says \\"I am your worker, I am your slave\\". The first real KW pop tune \\"The Model\\" is here, with vocals sounding a little better than anything before. But pretty well all other vocals are synthesized, which I love. Great album, and this and Autobahn and Computer World are probably their most classic. Electric Cafe is fantastic as well, though it was released in 1986 so is a bit better production and the sounds are different. MM is a classic.
B00005UEAR|4.0|The good news is that Disc 2 of this set is as good as anything DT's ever done.  It continues in the same vein as Metropolis Part 2.  Back in the day I suppose this would have been called a &quot;rock opera.&quot;  It's great with a very symphonic feel and several overt references to DT's influences (Pink Floyd, Styx and Yes).<br />The bad news is Disc 1, which contains several tracks that are overly indulgent and far longer than they need to be.  This stuff has its audience, but it's not me.  Thank goodness Disc 2 is so good or I'd be a bit bothered paying for a 2-disc set.
B00000DQSZ|3.0|I suppose it has it's charm and certainly is unlike anything else from the time. This came out between Radio-Activity and Man Machine. On TEE we get only a few new synth sounds, used on every song, and these sounds are mostly recognized from MM, and a bit from RA. The whole performance seems very dry and static. It is also very minimalist with a little too much vocal for me. Nevertheless after a few listenings it gets better. I just think that it's not the most hummable...it's a little too serious in parts, gloomy (ie Hall Of Mirrors). The rhythms in the title track and towrds the latter half of the album are interesting, but there isn't a lot of variation. Understandably this was one of their most influential albums, but I would recommend most other albums before this one. There may be social commentary, but musically it just doesn't translate well, in English anyhow. If there had been more tunes, all shorter, this may have been better. I prefer the vocoded vocals of MM to this. No, I would say listen to all others before getting this.
B000002JPA|5.0|I&amp;W isn't DT's first album, but it might as well be.  The first album, When Dream and Day Unite, was put out a few years earlier with a different singer and before DT really had a grasp on fusing the craft of songwriting in the progressive metal genre.<br />The first track, &quot;Pull Me Under,&quot; was the big &quot;hit&quot; from this album and started getting DT noticed.  However, this tribute to Shakespeare's &quot;Hamlet&quot; is only the tip of the iceberg.  &quot;Another Day&quot; is a nice &quot;ballad,&quot; but then the album really takes off.  &quot;Take the Time&quot; is an amazing 8+ minute song highlighting each band member's talent while still maintaining the integrity of a tight song.  &quot;Surrounded&quot; is a great rock song with subtle time signature shifts in the style of Rush but without sounding like Rush.  The next song is the epic.  &quot;Metropolis Pt. 1:  The Miracle and the Sleeper&quot; might just be the best song ever written.  Rather than use a verse, chorus, verse, chorus pattern, this song combines several unique sections at the beginning all blending together perfectly.  The song then dives into one of the most amazing instrumental sections ever written.  The song ends with a final vocal section leaving the listener wondering when Metropolis Pt. 2 will be written (we had to wait seven years for that).  The next track, &quot;Under a Glass Moon&quot; is a good &quot;guitar song,&quot; but it's never been my favorite.  Next up is a short keyboard and vocal piece called &quot;Wait for Sleep,&quot; which serves as the intro to the final track, &quot;Learning to Live.&quot;  L2L is an 11 minute epic that is every bit as amazing as Metropolis.<br />DT may have &quot;progressed&quot; musically since the release of this album 10 years ago, but in my view the band has yet to match the this album for crafting great songs in the progressive metal vein.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|Those who do not like &quot;country music&quot; (myself usually included) will find the edges blurred on Ryan Adams' album &quot;Gold.&quot; The blurring effect is apparently the result of the multitude of varying influences upon Adams that have found form on the album.<br />As for the songs, the songs are remarkable for what they say. As an whole album, many would say that Adams would have benefitted from cutting 3 songs since the album was &quot;overlong.&quot; However, Adams reveals himself as vulnerbale by leaving those songs on.<br />In fact, vulnerability is but one of many emotional themes explored on this album. In fact, starting with &quot;La Cienerga Just Smiled&quot; and ending with &quot;SYLVIA PLATH&quot; one runs a wide gambit of emotions. Though one is let off of the rollercoaster ride after &quot;SYLVIA PLATH&quot; the repose is momentary. &quot;Touch, Feel, and Lose,&quot; &quot;It's Harder Now That It's Over&quot; and &quot;Goodnight Hollywood Blvd&quot; start the trip anew.<br />And while I think that generally, this is a listenable album, I believe the high water mark begins with &quot;La Cienerga Just Smiled&quot; and ends with &quot;SYLVIA PLATH.&quot;<br />More importantly, when one listens to the combination of &quot;Nobody Girl&quot; and &quot;SYLVIA PLATH&quot; together, one takes away the fact that Adams exhibits an acute degree of sensitivity.<br />When listening to &quot;SYLVIA PLATH&quot; one should ask the question, &quot;why would Ryan Adams want Sylvia Plath?&quot; After posing the question (and, perhaps, reading &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;), one should then listen for the answer in  the gentle, yet unsteady piano coupled with the wistful, sentimental lyrics.<br />In short, I would recommend this album wholeheartedly.
B000002GF8|5.0|If you enjoy Sting or the Police but don't have this album please do yourself a favor and buy it right now.  A great album from start to finish.  The primary difference between this album and every other Police album is Sting's unbelieveable song writing.  He has not produced anything as good before or since.  Other Police albums have maybe 6 or 7 great songs on them, this has 10 (Mother is the exception).  The Police's music blends many elements all in one including rock, jazz, reggae, etc.  On this album the band blends all of these perfectly.  Yes, the album was very commercially successful but that does not in any way diminish how amazing this record is.  It is a shame they broke up not long after this record but at least they finished at their best.
B000003B6J|5.0|This was the album.  The one that started the \\"gangsta rap\\" genre that, depending on how you looked at it, revolutionized hip hop or killed it.  That's why I love and loathe this release at the same time.  When this hit big time back in the late 80's, everybody jumped on the gangsta bandwagon trying to cash in on NWA's success by \\"keepin' it real\\".  Unfortunately, this meant old-school rappers who avoided the gangsta-gravy train(Eric B & Rakim, Big Daddy Kane, Boogie Down Productions, etc) all got eventually lost in the shuffle to the more flashy, media-hyped gangsta rappers.  Too bad, cause those other rappers were waaaay better than the flood of NWA copycats.  If you want the other release in the late 80's that changed the face of rap, go see the reviews for PE's It Takes A Nation of Millions...<br />Anyway, having said all that, I still enjoy this release.  From the hard-core funky beats, the political/message-driven lyrics, and the old-school \\"multiple alternating mc's\\"  rap style of delivery,  this is a great cd to have in your rap collection.  The new re-mastered version supposedly has 4 bonus tracks too so it's worth a purchase.  Favorite tracks:  Staight Outta Compton(the definitive song of its sub-genre), **** tha Police(absolutely brutal and angry),  and Compton's N tha House(inadvertently amusing because the \\"f\\" word is used so many times!).  Overall, a great rap album I've enjoyed listening to through the years, but hope others don't just make this their stopping point as the 80's had many other great rap artists that did so much for this maligned genre.
B00005R2IS|4.0|Mad Max is a very imaginative, wild, and satisfying film. It's sequel The Road Warrior is a bit more thrilling, but Mad Max delivers the goods. The film is set in the post apocolyptic Australia, where savage biker gangs and outlaw drivers rule the roads. The film begins with policeman Max Rockantsky(Mel Gibson) who engages in a thrilling highway chase between him and a crazy driver called Nightrider. When Nightrider is killed in a firey crash, his psychopathic friend, Toecutter, is enraged, and wants revenge in blood, Rockantsky blood. Toecutter and his vicious biker gang are known for terrorizing towns, tying people to speeding motorcycles, and much worse (as seen in the film). For a while in the film, they stalk Max, his wife Jessie, and his infant son in very weird, creepy scenes. Then when Toecutter and the gang run Jessie and her baby down on their motorbikes, Max is beyond enraged, thus becoming the title character, Mad Max. The end of the film is a sensationalized thrillfest as Max dawns his leather road outfit, two guns, and hunts down the gang in his new Police Interceptor, running some down, shooting one, and I won't mention what happens to Toecutter. Mad Max is very bizarre, very brutal, and very very entertaining. The stunts are quite impressive, the villains are very well cast (particularly Toecutter and Johnny)and Mel Gibson is the ultimate Mad Max. The only snag: the film goes at a snail's pace. Otherwise, go rent this movie, make some popcorn, and get ready to hit the road.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Most people enjoy surprises, and i think this is why Beck has such a large following (aside from his musical genius, of course). Beck seems to enjoy surprising us as much as we enjoy the new sounds, from the dusty \\"Stereopathic Soulmanure\\" to the sequined \\"Midnight Vultures.\\" With \\"Sea Change,\\" he hands over a startling yet simple shock: an open, honest and beautiful drone of fuzzy melencholia. No wild genre-jumping, no harshly sarcastic statements, just Beck stepping forward and introducing himself in a flowing and melodic album that almost appears as one fifty-minute song. The tracks roll along to acoustic strumming, swaying strings and Beck's gentle voice, returning us to his folk roots. Yes, this album is sad, but not suicidal; it's more a contemplation about what is and what should be. People have been waiting for the next \\"Mellow Gold\\" and \\"Odelay,\\" claiming that all of Beck's other albums were simply studies. Perhaps they were wrong...perhaps Beck was studying how to best portray himself...perhaps his more popular albums were simply studies for this.
B00004LN16|5.0|ACDC has done it again.  This classic band dating back to the seventies puts out another great one.  They always manage to give you kick *** songs that really pump you up.  I recomend this albumb for driving, working out, or preparing for a fight.  Back in Black is a classic that will never die.  It has a classic sing-along chorus that is matched perfeclty by their other vocals.  Highway to hell is another song that is to die for.  These are songs that will stick in you head and you won't even mind.  ACDC has a sound that has yet to be duplicated, and never will be.  This album is a must have this christmas season, or any season for that matter.  Martello and Martello enterprises gives it two thumbs up.
B000000OA6|5.0|This album is the last that Queen did while Freddie Mercury was alive, and it is one of their best. The album begins with the title track &quot;Innuendo&quot;, a six minute Bohemian Rhapsody like opus. With the exception of &quot;Delilah&quot;, a song about Mercury's pet cat, the song quality on Innuendo is incredible. Songs like &quot;Don't Try So Hard&quot;, &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, and &quot;These Are The Days Of Our Lives&quot; are very moving and obviously biographical to the band. Queen, although nearing their end, still managed to include the hard rock classics such as &quot;The Hitman&quot;, &quot;Headlong&quot;, and &quot;I Can't Live Without You&quot;. All in all, this is a great Queen album and a must for a fan of good old rock/pop music.
B000068TPN|2.0|This is SUCH  a disoppointment!! After two great movies like Braveheart and especially the Patriot, you would expect an even better one from Mel Gibson. But this one didn't even make me want to see the end. Though it's not THAT bad, it's a disoppointment.
078322608X|4.0|A bruce willis role that goes a beyond what you normally see bruce willis do. Madeleine Stowe is amazing and Brad pitt is beyond cool. great directing job by Terry Gilliam and defintely worth owning. Whenever you want to see something interesting and a little less run of the mill,...this is definitely for you
078322687X|5.0|This movie, while not John Hughes best in my opinion (see Sixteen Candles) Is his best directorial and writing. Molly Ringwald plays the princess, a role she absolutely knocks out of the park. There are a lot of cool moments. You'll laugh, you'll cry (well maybe not) but you will definitely enjoy the movie,..The image is clear and while I have seen better transfers this is definitely above par. <br />If you love teen flicks with something to say, this is definitely for you.
B000069HKH|5.0|After being a Bruce Fan since I was a teenager, and that was many moons ago, I was thrilled to see he hooked back up with the E Street Band and CRAFTED this fantastic, what I consider, a tribute to 9/11 CD.  When I listen to the songs, I can put myself in the tradegy, yet, become INSPIRED by the heart and soul of Bruce's words.  The last time I felt like this, was when Born In The USA was released.  I have heard much criticizm on this CD, and honestly, the people who are being critical of it, do not know WHO Bruce Springsteen is and What He's All About!  Although I now live in New Hampshire, I was born and raised in New Jersey!!  A TRUE SPRINGSTEEN FAN!!  KEEP US ROCKING, BRUCE!! THE BOSS IS BACK!!
B00006AG5N|5.0|Even though Elvis has been gone a long time, these 30 songs (plus one remix) are timeless.  No one sounds like Elvis and it's good to hear &quot;The King&quot; even after all these years.  The last song is interesting since &quot;A little less conversation&quot; now sounds like music for a TV commercial.
B0000542D2|2.0|The film is brilliant.  We all know that.  The big question was how would it fare in it's latest digital incarnation.  Not very well, I'm afraid.  For starters, pass on this version of AHDN until they fix the sound. It's mono, which is fine because the film was originally, but the music sounds horrible. The heavy compression makes it sound like they've put a huge amount of flanger on the whole audio track. I thought John only spent one scene in the bathtub.  It sounds like the entire music score was recorded in the bathtub, under water.<br />The extras are nice. Nice interviews with actors and actresses and technical people who worked on the film, but how often will you watch that.  All interviews are very informative, but not enough to make you forget what is missing.  How about the Phil Collins hosted &quot;You Can't Do That&quot;?  How about the You Can't Do That performance?  How about the extras that are on the MPI VHS version? It just makes me think about what could have been.<br />Now the picture?  It's LBX.  It wasn't originally.  It adds a little on the sides, but crops too much on the top and bottom. Full screen is fine.  Even a video file would rather have the full aspect ratio rather than loosing more than what is gained.<br />Stay away from this release and hold on to your VHS or LD versions until the audio is corrected.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Picked mine up yesterday. I am totally pleased with this effort. The remastering job turned out very well. I bet this one will be the greatest seller in Elvis' history.<BR>   For Rick let me say, no one ever said Elvis invented Rock and Roll. The definition for &quot;king&quot; is a man that dominates his area, or field. Now, in the history of recorded music, no one has ever has dominated like Elvis. Sadly the great artist you mentioned never dominated anything. And that is sad because they are all great artist.
B00006690F|5.0|I love Eminem and have all of his CDs.There all great but I think The Eminem Show is the best yet!He must of worked twice as hard on this CD because every song is gold!I also think alot of radio stations agree with me because I`ve heard 4 songs played on the radio from The Eminem Show.This is definetly a legendary record that should live on forever!
B00000IQW3|4.0|I rewatched this movie in a weekend of nostalgia... I must admit I started it with some trepidation, however, since I had also just re-watched one of my favorite movies as a kid -- \\"Invaders from Mars\\" (the original, not the remake).  It was unspeakably bad.  But this... this movie still is a breezy couple of hours.  Sure, the effects are dated now (but at the time they were revolutionary, using computer generated animation), but the story is a great fantasy (why hasn't it been remade?) and the acting and direction are first rate.  And LUCKILY the Earth-bound costumes don't scream 1980s too much.  I believe this was Robert Preston's last movie -- and he is sorely missed.  I only wish he was in more of the film...<br />[...]If you can get it at a good price or used, it would make a great addition to your collection.
B0000542D2|2.0|I am a first genoration Beatle fan and I am very disappointed about the way Disney released this DVD. <BR>  First, if you are planning to hear this DVD in 2 channel stereo sound, you are out of luck. The sound is in mono when hooked up to a stereo TV or a stereo system. There is no 2 channel stereo audio track on this DVD. I would rather have a 2 channel audio track than a 5.1 French audio track. If I wanted to hear the songs that are in the film in mono, I'd listen to the CD.  <BR>  Second, The DVD claims that everyone that was involved in the making of the film is interviewed for this DVD. Everyone involved is intervewed except... the Beatles. There are no interviews with the Beatles talking about the film, not even in various press confrence footage.<BR>  I also noticed that this two DVD set wasn't released in <BR>co-operation with Apple Corp. Ltd., the Beatles company that releases Beatles merchandise.<BR>  Ohter than these two very big problems, this two DVD set is great.<BR>  But if you are a hardcore Beatle fan like me and want to hear this movie in 2 channel stereo sound, avoid this DVD and look for a copy of this film on VHS tape from MPI Home Video. At least this copy is in stereo Sound.
B00000BKI4|4.0|Desserter's Songs is a strange, surreal, dreamy soundscape.  Dave Fridman works his magic yet again to pull together what must be considered one of the nineties' best produced albums.  INdeed, muted horns, strings, and even singing saw come together to create one intoxicating brew.  The music is only part of the equation, however, and the coup de grace of Mercury Rev's sound is the unique voice of Johnathan Donahue.  Donahue's voice can take some getting used ot, but it really is the perfect accopmaniment to the music.  Fittingly, the lyrics are surreal and beautiful, much like the music in which they are immersed.  When Donahue sings lines like &quot;well she tossed all nightlike a raging sea / Woke up andclimbed from the suicide machine&quot; it is oddly moving.  There really inn't a weak song on the album, but &quot;Holes&quot;, &quot;Tonight it Shows&quot;, &quot;Funny Bird&quot;, and the rollicking &quot;Delta Sun Bottleneck Stomp&quot; must be considered highlights.  This is an album tobe experienced rather than simply listened to:  dreamy, surreal, and cathartic.
B00006AG5N|5.0|If you are ever going to buy an ELV1S album this needs to be the one that you buy. The sound quality has never been better. I've heard Hound Dog a million times and when I heard it on this CD it literally blew me away!!! Other tracks that were like hearing them for the first time are In The Ghetto, Suspicious Minds, Burning Love, Jailhouse Rock, Heartbreak Hotel, Stuck On You, His Latest Flame, Return to Sender and Way Down.  The other tracks have also been remastered from the original and are very clear and also sound better than ever. I would also recommend this album because of it's history. Let's be honest..No one had a voice and could deliver a songe like ELV1S..Not Chuck Berry, Not Little Richard..Yes they were all pioneers in Rock-n-Roll but don't be misinformed by people when they tell you ELV1S isn't the true king. ELV1S is not only the King of Rock-n-Roll but the King of Music and a cultural icon that will never be forgotten.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|Ryan Adams' sophomore solo album is a perplexing one.  \\"Gold\\" is all over the map, both in terms of style and in terms of quality.  On one hand, he delivers a handful of absolutely great songs, such as \\"La Cinega Just Smiled\\", \\"New York, New York\\", \\"Harder Now That Its Over\\". \\"Rescue Blues\\", and \\"Goodnight L.A.\\", to name but a few.  However, on the other hand there are some middling numbers such as \\"Gonna Make You Love Me\\", \\"Enemy Fire\\", and the absolutely godawful \\"Tina Toledo's Streetwalking Blues\\".  The good definitely outweighs the bad, however, and even some of the numbers that don't seem too spectacular begin to grow on you after repeated listens.  For example, while initially put off by the 9-minute opus \\"Nobody Girl\\", I now appreciate it as a near-perfect kiss-off to a former flame.  Though this album gained much of its attention due to the breezy single \\"New York New York\\", Adams' strengths continue to lie in his almost preternatural ability to write gut-wrenching ballads (as he so aptly demonstrated on his classic album \\"Heartbreaker\\").   \\"Wildlfowers\\", \\"When the Stars Go Blue\\", and the aforementioned \\"Cinega\\", \\"L.A.\\", and \\"Harder Now That it's Over\\" must be counted with Adams best work.  His vocals continue to develop and show considerable range, from the country twang of \\"New York\\" to the Westerberg-style growl of \\"Enemy Fire\\" to the Neil Young-isms of \\"Wildlfowers\\".  This album could have easily been at par with Heartbreaker if it has cut down on several of the songs.  I'll give Adams credit...he is a virtual fountain of songwriting; he's just got to learn to filter some of it out.
B000069AT7|1.0|First, I want to make it clear that I'm reviewing the DVD here, not the original film.  I liked the original; it's a good movie.  Not as fantastic as it is hyped to be, but good enough to have on DVD for an occasional viewing.  I give the film 4 stars.<br />I have BIG problems with what's behind this DVD, and the \\"special edition\\" of ET that's on it.<br />The 2002 edition of ET is just absurd.  As others pointed out, CGI ET looks silly, and isn't consistent with the \\"old\\" scenes that include ET.  His stiffness was part of his physical character.  Making him more \\"jar-jar\\" just doesn't make sense.  It's an example of \\"lets do it because we can\\".  There are lots of thing we \\"can\\" do that we \\"should not\\" do, and this is one of them.<br />But much worse than this is the digital removal of the guns.  Not only was this poorly done (from a technical point of view), but it's an example of Political Correctness(tm) gone mad.  Guess what: government agents and cops carry guns, and they point them at people/things that they are trying to stop/apprehend.  Get over it.<br />I hate to see a work of art like ET defaced just to appease a loud, misguided minority of people who believe in political correctness.  Bowing to this minority was a cowardly act.<br />Finally, the packaging Universal has chosen is obnoxious.  The only way to get the original film is to buy a very expensive \\"gift boxed set\\", filled with things I do NOT want.  I'm willing to pay for a boxed set, but only if it contains the following items: Original movie with original 5.1 sound track, commentary track(s), deleted scenes, making of and/or retrospective featurettes. That's it.  This would probably fit on one disc, making a boxed set unnecessary. ...
B00000373U|5.0|With a few simple chords, some delicate finger plucking, and a flicker of his thin voice, Elliott Smith can bring down the house.  It's quite an accomplishment that he was able to craft one of the best albums of the 1990's with virtually no more than his voice and an acoustic guitar.  No worry:  Elliott's songwriting would make this an enthralling album were he to be reading it in a slow monotone.  The songs on Either/Or may sound delicate, but hidden within them is quite a bite.  Witness, for example, the character in \\"Ballad of Big Nothing\\" who watches \\"the parade with pinpoint eyes full of smoldering anger\\", or the line \\"both of you can just fade to black\\" from \\"2:45 am\\" which carries a surprising amount of venom for such a hushed line.  Elsewhere, the simultaneous self loathing/joyous rapture in a line like \\"you'll be forever with my poison arms around you / no one's gonna fool around with us\\" is astounding.  Either/Or tells stories of love, heartbreak, bitterness, and regret (and a hint of addiction thrown in for good measure) with surprising delicacy.  Each and every song is a jewel, a classic, from the opening of \\"Speed Trials\\" to the closing notes of \\"Say Yes\\", in which Elliott concedes that \\"situations get f***ked up and turned around sooner or later\\".  And really, this line about sums up the themes of this outstanding album.  Although each and every one of Elliott's albums are outstanding, \\"Either/Or\\", the last of his \\"lo-fi\\" albums, will forever remain my favorite.
B00006J3WH|5.0|A must for any real Buffy fan.  High quality sound that allows you to fully enjoy one of the best episodes of the critically acclaimed series.  You also get all the lyrics in the booklet.
B00006AG5N|5.0|If you've listened to previous original recordings of Elvis' early #1 hits, you've noticed that they sound scratchy at best.  This is a truly remarkable CD, one that every Elvis fan should own, and for that matter, any music lover should own.  Elvis has never seemed more alive on a CD.  I don't care if you already own 5 Elvis Greatest Hits CD's, throw em' all away and buy this one.  And with 31 songs on one CD, you'll never get a better value.<BR>As for how Elvis performed, well, its all original recordings, so theres no need to discuss how brilliant he is again.
B000069AUI|5.0|I bought this CD for my wife after she asked for it and I haven't stopped listening to it since. It is truly addicting and inspiring. I've found that the lyrics and music are mesmorizing. Definitely play this CD on &quot;loud&quot; in the car and you'll find that it is a refreshing change from almost everything else that is out there currently. A must buy. Just promise yourself to take it out of your CD player a few weeks later so you can listen to something else.. and then put it back in.
6304140711|4.0|This movie rocks!! It has a good plot, story, and interesting characters. If you liked Fatal Attraction, then you'll love this! It's got a lot of thrills, suspense, and some very harrowing moments, especially the showdown at the family nest! Sometimes the film gets a bit boring, but delivers one heck of a thriller! The rollercoaster scene is very steamy! The performances are very convincing. Fatal Attraction is still just a little bit better, but this movie still kicks butt!!
B00003CXAE|5.0|I just got my Grease DVD today and I love it!  I'm watching it for the second time today as I write this review.  The widescreen edition is wonderful.  Now you can see all of the dancing and scenery as you watch this classic.  And the picture is wonderful too.  The images are so crisp/sharp and and the colors are so vibrant, you'd swear this movie was just filmed yesterday instead of over 20 years ago.  I can't belive it's been that long!  The sound is amazing especially when hooked up to a great system and the extras are nice.  However, there weren't that many extras on this DVD as I thought there would be. I'd hoped for more such as a commentary, behind the scenes, bloopers, deleted scenes or even cast bios. But who knows, maybe in the future there will be a platinum release or something.  Oh!  And the songbook that comes with it is great.  Reading it as I sang along helped me realize that I didn't know the songs as well as I'd thought I did.  I recommend this DVD for any Grease buff.  You won't be disappointed.
0783117523|5.0|Ok if you dont mind a movie about a beautiful women, junkie, model, and a lesbian this one is great! Angelina is awesome! (but when is she not?) you really feel like you get to know Gia in a way. The ending is really sad a shocking so prepare yourself!
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis IS BACK! I have a hard time to describe this great new cd. Not that the songs are new, they have been released millions of times before, BUT NEVER SOUNDING THIS CLEAR & BOMBASTIC! Elvis sounds like he recorded these gems yesterday! What a great job Dave Bendeth & his team have done. Simply amazing. I have over 1,500 albums, so it's hard to impress me, but this cd is truly a work of art in sound. From Heartbreak Hotel all the way to Way Down, you get the impression that you are in the studio with Elvis. Never has Elvis voice sounded so clear, crisp & up front.<BR>What about the Muscicians??? They bounce out of the speakers and grab you by the throat! This new cd makes all the Greatest Hits fall by the wayside. It may not be the perfect overview of Elvis great career, they are so many other terrific songs that couldn't be included, but this certainly shows Elvis at his best, and may I say once again, sounding fresh, exciting, and vibrant!!!
B000002PCS|5.0|This is a great CD.  I don't usually like this kind of music, but this is very well done.  My Mom has the CD and now I am ordering one for my Aunt as well who has enjoyed my Mom's so much she keeps borrowing it.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This is it -- the absolute greatest collection of music from the most important, influential and talented artist of the 20th Century.  If you've been waiting for a truly complete Elvis &quot;starter kit&quot; at a very good price, your wait is over!  They're all here -- &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, &quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot;, &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; -- all the King's #1s.  Plus, they are newly remastered to make them sound just like Elvis is there in the room, singing just for you as only he could.  Elvis was the greatest artist of the 20th Century, and this new collection proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that the King will be in the building well into the 21st Century as well.  Long live the KING!
0930289528|5.0|There is something about Alan Moores writing; there will be a certain point in his story that makes me want to put the book down and tear up due to the gutwrenching emotion that has been stabbed into my minds comprehension.  I did the same thing with the Killing Joke (obviously the best Joker story ever to be told) and it happened again in V for Vendetta.  I became interested in this book because I as told (after reading the Killing Joke) that this run was his...Manifest Destiny as it was put.  I had to buy it.  I did.  Not only did the story enfold me with his characters' empathy (or in other cases, the lack thereof), plus these politics coinside with my own. I'm an anti-fascist and for the most part anti-establishment so I could relate to V rather easily.  But...What's soo sad about this story is...It could happen.  One of these days our own government will collapse on itself and all people will turn to is hate mongers and bigots because they are tired of all the fighting.  Fascisim must be eradicated...By whatever means necessary.  V for Vendetta takes it's blow on it.  I recommend this to any Frank Miller fan.  Or any fan of Batman, cause V is kinda like a mix between Batman and the Joker.  I imagine more would disagree but that's just the connection I made. Freedom belongs to the individual.  May our own will and imagination prevail, rather than the people on top.  Peace above all. V for Victory, V for Vengence and V for Vendetta.
0316666343|4.0|I gave this four stars only because I believe there's always room for betterment, but in this case I really believe the author outdid herself.  Based on the storyline alone, I'd never have read this book, as I hate to even imagine the death of my child...The first several pages kept me glued to the book as Susie tells of her murder and murderer.  As she views her family and friends, how they deal with their grief unfurls and becomes a rollercoaster of emotions.  It was easy to understand the depth of her father's grief and how he deals with it; her mother's desire to deal with her grief alone; her sister's grief mixed with guilt for the need to go on with her life; her younger brother too young to understand why his father no longer wants to play with him and how his mom breaks his heart.  Even her closest friends are more than touched by the loss of their friend.  Only her grandmother's roughish ways and glib tongue allows us to laugh through some of this family's vulnerabilities and dealings with their emotions.  I can only say that I highly recommend this sweetly told story from Susie's heavenly view and I applaud this author for writing about such a sensitive subject.  I only hope that this story was not written from a personal point of view.
B00005R87Q|4.0|The Fast and the Furious is probably the best movie of it's type to come out in many a year.  Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto is rock solid in his performance as a good bad guy.  Paul Walker does a good job as the undercover cop Brian O'Conner.  The story line is well used but does not drag on and on as some do.  Basic undercover cop meets decent ex-con and becomes friends. Of course it does not hurt that Brian falls for Dominic's sister Mia Toretto played by the beautiful Jordana Brewster of The Faculty.  Plenty of fast cars, beautiful women and a good story line make this a great movie.  Dominic's girlfriend Letty played by Michelle Rodriguez proves girls like fast cars as well.  If you like cars and girls and who doesn't, grab this movie.
0380778556|3.0|I think it`s a good book. Not the best I`ve ever read, but really good. I like the fact that in the middle of the booky you notice suddenly all is different from what you have thought. I was really surprised that Rebecca was such an unkind person! And that Maxim never loved her. I think the end of the book is also really good, because the whole book deals with events that have never happened when Manderley, Maxim`s house, isn`t so important for Maxim any more. And at the end, Manderley burns down.<br />But sometimes the book is a little boring. There are a lot of long dialogues that aren`t really exiting. They are much too long!<br />But I still liked reading that book.
0743216458|5.0|I am just an average guy who likes books about WWII. I found this book quite riveting, very deatailed and yet, easy to read. I read the whole thing in one weekend as I just could not put it down. Its absolutely one of the best books I have every read obout the war.
0380778556|3.0|Rebecca is a story about a young woman who gets involved in a difficult affair. In the first part of the story, Mrs de Winter, who has married a rich, much older man, Max de Winter, writes about her life in her new home, the great Manderley. She learns the entire story of Rebecca, Maxs first wife. Then, her husband admits, that all this has been a lie. From then on, everything goes fast. Max is accused because of a suspicion of murder. By sheer luck, they succeed in escaping from the prison.<br />In the whole book, there is not much tension. Neither at the beginning nor at the end. Certainly, there is some tension, but when the tension comes to a head, the book finishes very swiftly  without being finished.<br />Another reason why I dont like the book very much are the characters. The entire story is not contemporary at all. Its boring to watch the rich people count their money. They are so impersonal, I can just watch what they are doing, I can hardly sympathise with them.
B00006AG5N|5.0|With the release of JXL's remix of &quot;A little less conversation&quot;, the coolest Elvis single in 25 years, The King was (once again) introduced to a new audience, and in a very succesful way as this single reached the # 1 spot in 24 territories!<BR>An album like &quot;Elvis 30 # 1 Hits&quot; was therefore inevitable, but this is not just another greatest hits CD, it's THE definitive Elvis collection of the entire globe!<BR>First of all, what really blows you away is the SOUND, the sound quality of this album is absolutely breathtaking, Elvis is heard here as he's never been heard before, both old and new fans will fully agree to this!<BR>Second, and most importantly off course, is the music on the album. From his first # 1 Heartbreak Hotel to A Big Hunk o' Love, from his first post-army smash Stuck On You to Crying In The Chapel and from the moving In The Ghetto to his last hit Way Down, it's crystal clear in every note that Elvis Presley was, is and always will be the undisputed King of Rock 'n' Roll, whose music will be around for a very long time to come!<BR>Should anyone ever ask you who Elvis Presley was, this CD is the best possible answer to give...<BR>If you open the jewel-box and take out the CD (as you'll do very often!), you'll read the following, which says it all:<BR>BEFORE ANYONE DID ANYTHING, ELVIS ALREADY DID EVERYTHING...
B00006AG5N|5.0|This cd sounds like it was recorded yesterday! The version of a &quot;Fool Such As I&quot; is different but actually sounds better than the original. Listen to &quot; Jailhouse Rock&quot; &amp; see for yourself how crisp it comes across those speakers!
B0000027RL|5.0|Back in the early 90's, you and pretty much a lot of people can sum up the music scene in one word: grunge. Along with Nirvana, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden, Pearl Jam was part of the heavy hitters. Members were originally in Mother Love Bone until the singer's death(which sparked the Temple of the Dog album) and hired Eddie Vedder, one of the great singers in rock, even if he's one of the most copied but it's this album that put them on the map.<br />Once: opens with an eerie intro then the guitar comes in then the full band. Part I of the Mamason Trilogy. Has a quite catchy chorus. A great way to open the album. 8/10<br />Even Flow: An awesome guitar riff and is one of the 3 big hits of the album. It feels a little long though. Has an amazing chorus 9/10<br />Alive: The other big hit of the album and rightfully so. Some very personal lyrics but a very affirming chorus. Ends with a great solo from Mike. Part II of Mamason Trilogy. 9/10<br />Why Go: After the greatness of the first 3 and the next 2 songs, seems kinda average. It's got a great solo though just the song's nothing special. 7/10<br />Black: IMO, the best song on the album. Very personal lyrics and an even more powerful vocal delivery. My favorite part is near the end with the \\"I know someday you'll have a beautiful life\\" section. I felt sorry for him. 10/10<br />Jeremy: If you haven't heard this song or seen the video, you're either lying or very good at avoiding this song. Consider it their \\"signature song\\". I love the \\"ooh whoaaaa\\" part at the end. 10/10<br />Oceans: Nice sounding chords before a shift in tempo with some good vocalizing by Eddie. It's pretty short though. 8/10<br />Porch: Simple riff then the band comes in later on. Quite an uptempo track. Quite a long solo in the middle which to me felt a little out of place. I love the outro with the \\"Yeah, yeah, yeah\\" by Eddie and Mike's fast paced solo beneath. 8/10<br />Garden: Very cool guitar opening here with the second guitar during the verses adding little fills. Love the chorus. And yet another outro solo by Mike. It's a good song. 8/10<br />Deep: Probably my least favorite on the album. But it's got a cool riff for the chorus using a slide. This song is just ok. 7/10<br />Release: Not a lot of lyrics but makes up for it in Eddie's vocal delivery and the meaning of the lyrics itself. Written about his dad. Great way to end the album. But remember that opening thing to Once with the bass rhythm before the main song kicks in? It's back again but more fuller. Should've been left off but oh well. 9/10<br />This album, while not their best is certainly their most well-known and has many of their best songs. Even though Deep should've been left off and put on the Jeremy single and they included Yellow Ledbetter, it's a great album nonetheless
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis # 1's is the real thing folks. I could not believe how fresh these songs sounded. What a wonderful job they did in the sound studio, remastering the songs that we've all heard hundreds of times before. Instruments are heard that were never present before.  Especially the stereo hits after 1960. After listening to this cd, if you had any doubts who shaped the world of rock, think no further than Elvis.
0380778556|2.0|I found the story very slow and boring (at least at the beginning,fortunately the end is a slightly better, else it would be very boring) is , the characters sometimes seemed to do simply nothing. The actions of the people are often not or only heavily comprehensibly, for example Mrs. de Winter. Why does she stay with Maxim after she found out his dark secret? In the movie it is more understandable. But I think the movie is much better than the book.
B00004X01U|5.0|Another smash album by Madonna! Her talent for redefining music continues to intrigue me. Another great album of songs mixed with new sounds. This is a more evolved album than \\"Ray of Light\\" in that the electronica sound is more apparent and organic. <br />The CD opens up with \\"Music\\", a great start because of its infectious grooves. It will make you start dancing immediately! The bass, the synthesizers, all of it really gets under your skin and into your blood. Even the non-singles are great. \\"Amazing\\" is a fantastic song with a great beat. \\"Nobody's Perfect\\" is hauntingly gorgeous.<br />Buy this CD because it's great. Take it from me, a music elitist.
0316666343|5.0|I read this book as part of a book club I'm involved with at<BR>school. The book was a phenomenal book all the way through. I couldn't put the book down. There are parts in the book that will make you laugh out loud, while others will make you cry for hours. It is a book that will soon become a classic in <BR>everyone's home. I hope everyone reads the book and enjoys it<BR>as much as I did.
B000002NJS|5.0|The emergence of Madonna's new sound!  A great transition into the new millennium (even though it's a 1998 CD).  Only goes to show how much ahead of her time she is!  <br />Although many have emphasized its different sound from the rest of Madonna's catalogue, it's actually quite ecclectic, bringing back her former co-producer Pat Leonard (True Blue, Like a Prayer).  Great ballads and great dance tunes.  A wonderful mix that will satisfy any music lover.<br />Madonna won several Grammy's for this CD and deservedly so.  You can tell much work had been put into the production of this album.  And the lyrics are very personal and complex along with the gorgeous arrangements.
B0000399WI|5.0|One of the best films I've ever seen.  Unfortunately I did not get to see this film in the theaters. When this film was released in 1994 I had grown tired of the \\"prison\\" movie. I had already seen TANGO & CASH (T&C) and LOCK UP (LU) both of these films starred Sylvester Stallone. I had also seen Death Warrant (DW) with Jean Claude Van Damme and figured that this would just be another run of them mill movie about a guy wrongfully imprisoned. Eventually I rented this film and boy was I wrong! Unlike the earlier mentioned films this was not an action flick but an emotional story about the hardships of prison life and the struggle an inmate encounters trying to maintain hope of eventually leaving the prison. I so enjoyed this movie that I obtained the original novel and found that while there are some changes to the story they are relatively minor and do not detract from the theme of the story. In my review I will compare the book to the film.<br />1. In the book Andy Dufresne is in jail until 1975. In the movie he is only in jail until 1967.<br />2. In the book Andy's poster at the time of his departure is one of Linda Ronstadt. In the movie it is Raquel Welch.<br />3. In the book Andy served time under several wardens and head guards. In the movie Warden Norton was in office for Andy's entire prison stay as was the head guard Byron Hadley. Actually in the book Byron Hadley was the head guard when Andy arrived in Shawshank and had retired by the time Norton became warden.<br />4. In the book Red is describe as Irish and although no reference is made to his race I assumed he was white. In the movie Red is black being portrayed by Morgan Freeman, and the character Red indicates that he is Irish. While this does not contradict the book I think by making Red an African American it differed from most readers conception of Red. However, Morgan Freeman did such a fine job in the role of Red it is impossible for me to think of anyone else in that role.<br />5. In the book Andy, with help from a friend in the outside world, invests all his money prior to his arrest under a false identity so that when he leaves Shawshank he has money to start over with. In the movie Andy departs with Warden Norton's ill gotten gains to start his new life.<br />6. In the book no warden commits suicide and no prisoner is killed after the warden stages a fake escape attempt. Both these acts occur in the move.<br />There are other small differences between the movie and the book but none that alter the overall story. I would suggest to all that this story is worth reading and watching. There is a reason that it is ranked so high in IMDB's ranking chart.<br />Just a bit of trivia for Stephen King fans. The character of Andy Dufresne also has a key cameo role in Stephen King's book APT PUPIL. It is Andy Dufresne that unknowingly helps escaped Nazi henchman Kurt Dussander set up a life in America. This occurs while Andy is working at the Maine bank prior to going to Shawshank.dy, with help from a friend in the outside world, invests all his money prior to his arrest under a false identity so that when he leaves Shawshank he has money to start over with.

This occurs while Andy is working at the Maine bank prior to going to Shawshank.
B000060MY6|5.0|I had not seen any of Lynch's works previous to this movie, but from what I've heard this is his utter triumph.  I can't speak based out of comparison to his other films, but simply on its own, I find it to be the most incredible film I have had the pleasure of viewing.  After the first watching, I will admit that I was MASSIVELY confused and immediately sought out friends who had seen the movie to get an explanation.  This was a gigantic mistake.  My recommendation to anyone about to see this film for the first time is to watch it over at least twice or even three times before consulting outside sources.  The answers ARE there, it just takes time to figure out all the clues.  Based off of this film, I would say that Lynch is one of the best directors I know of today.  A friend of mine has said that she believes he is even more of a brilliant surrealist than Salvador Dali, and I can't help but agree with her.  Watch this masterpiece and savor it.
B00006JIA4|3.0|I remember growing up in the 70's when Queen was perhaps one of the first rock acts to make me sit up and listen.  When I got this Platinum Collection at a bargain price of ..., I assumed that the whole collection would stand on its own.  To me, it doesn't.  The songs from Greatest Hits I are indeed classics, as are some from Greatest Hits II.  But midway through II and into most of III, you get the feeling the \\"best\\" of Queen pretty much resides in the albums themselves as secret nuggets (hell, News of the World is better than II or III individually).  The \\"greatest hits\\" from II and III are really better known in the UK; a large chunk of these selections will likely be unfamiliar to most casual fans, but then again, maybe I lost touch with Queen after The Game in the early 80s.  I found a large majority of the songs on the second and third discs to be mediocre, dated, and very synth-oriented.  However, the clarity and remastering make up for the flaws, and disc one by itself (and the enclosed booklet) is worth the price of admission.  For a casual Queen fan, don't expect to know much beyond disc II.

B00005JKCH|1.0|In my opinion, I think this movie was completely, well...stupid. Spider-man was laughable and the Green Goblin reminded me of a Power Ranger. I have to admit Willem Dafoe is a good actor, but I don't know why he would agree to play the part of a scientist/businessman/robot who flies around on a magical surf board. <br />Most likely the younger audience will find it to be a \\"really awesome movie\\", but I think this whole film just went to hell with all the pointless humor, kiddish entertainment and flat-out boring hero vs. villian concept.<br />Instead of \\"Stupid-Man\\" I HIGHLY recommend \\"X-Men\\", a great movie as well as an excellent adaption from a comic series.
B00006AG5N|5.0|There are no words to describe it!  Who ever thought Elvis could actually sound better? Well he does and this CD makes you believe that he is in the room with you.  Some of these hits are nearly 50 years old yet they deliver such an energy that makes them explode out of your speakers. I dare you to listen to this without tapping your feet and dancing up a storm! And to all you so called \\"intellectuals\\" who have pronounced Elvis a \\"has been\\" at the time of his death, OBVIOUSLY never heard him rip through WAY DOWN! If you're an Elvis fan, ENJOY IT and if you're not, what the heck is stopping you?
B00005JKJA|1.0|Typical David Lynch...is he paying the critics to write positive reviews for his disjointed, badly played bits of weirdness?
0452282152|2.0|Unlike Vermeer who obviously had talent, I am hard pressed to believe that this author has produced a best seller.  I truly wanted to like this novel,(as it was a selection by my bookclub), alas I did not.  My reasons for disliking it are simple; it is terribly dull. I kept waiting for something to happen (it never does).  The characters are one dimentional at best, and our muse Griet would appear to be the most amazing and accomplished teenager to have ever lived.  At the tender age of 16 she knows everything about running a large household, raising children, manipulating the mature women of the house, fending off the advances of men, and in case that wasn't enough she's giving art tips to the master himself, um sure... that's plausible.  While the premise of this book was fascinating the execution certainly was not.  The best thing about this novel?... the cover art!!
B000059TPN|5.0|This is a great movie.  I'd recommend the movie to any lover of Sean Connery, Nick Cage, Ed Harris, or action movies.  Any type of movie for that matter. Sean Connery seems made for this role, a bitter British agent improsoned for life without trial.  His cynisism and great quips make this movie a joy to watch.  He constantly will snap back to Nick Cage with a wonderful little quote, my favorite being \\"Loser's whine about doing their best..... Nick Cage also gives a great performance, and he seems almost made for the role as a reluctant chemical engeneer thrust into an environment he doesn't understand with a man he doesn't trust or know.  The movie plays Cage off of Connery, and the result is great dialouge mixed with awesome action sequences.  Ed Harris plays the angered general who doesn't want his men, killed in top secret missions with him, to have their families go uncompinsated.  You get a great view at his inner torments of wanting his goals to be completed, however, he doesn't want to be responsible for the deaths of many people in San Fransisco.  The movie's action and acting is superb, and it is one of my favorite movies.  I'd definatly recommend it.
6303921248|5.0|Of all the dramatisations of classic novels of British literature that I have seen, none have so completely captured a novel's essence or been so perfectly cast as has this rendition of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  It is simply outstanding--a beautiful treatment of a splendidly witty, humorous and insightful novel.<br />For those unfamiliar with the novel, it is certainly not necessary to read it in order to fully appreciate the dramatisation (although it is a novel that I highly recommend).  Briefly, the story concerns Miss Elizabeth Bennet (Jennifer Ehle), a spirited, quick-witted and intelligent (not to mention beautiful) young woman from a family of modest means, and the wealthy Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth), a handsome but very reserved and indeed proud young man.  Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth albeit against his will (for he deems her to be socially inferior and cannot abide her silly mother and sisters).  Elizabeth (who displays a quickness to judge others based on appearances and \\"first impressions\\"), however, does not care for the arrogant, haughty Mr. Darcy, whose real fault lies in letting his pride show.  It is the tension between these two main characters that comprises the central story and gives it its spark.  I won't say any more, for I don't wish to give the story away for those unfamiliar with it.  Suffice it to say that although it takes place some 200 years ago, it is every bit as relevant today as it was then, for although customs have changed and technologies have advanced, human nature remains the same.<br />For those familiar with the novel, liberties have necessarily been taken in bringing the novel to screen in order to create an interesting and enjoyable visual experience, but they are not intrusive, obvious liberties (ie. one must root through the novel in order to find them), and the story remains admirably close to the original.  Most important of all, it is absolutely spot on in capturing the essence and themes of the novel (which, I might add is no mean feat!).    <br />As for the cast, they are all absolutely superb at capturing the essence of their respective characters--from Julia Sawalha's giddy and vivacious portrayal of the boy-crazy and impetuous Lydia Bennet (Elizabeth's younger sister) to David Bamber's hilarious portrayal of the grovelling, sycophantic toady Mr. Collins (Elizabeth's cousin upon whom the family's house is entailed) to Alison Steadman's humorously shrill and highly strung Mrs. Bennet (Elizabeth's eternally pessimistic mother).  Of course, one simply cannot forget the splendid portrayal by Jennifer Ehle, who captures Lizzy's spirit and wit to perfection.  Last but certainly not least is Colin Firth, who will forever be etched in many a mind (and heart) as the quintessential Mr. Darcy.<br />This set consists of six 50-minute episodes, and it is a story of timeless appeal which I highly, highly recommend.  Although it will certainly be of interest to fans of period drama (for it is without a doubt one of the best of all time), I believe its scope is broad enough to be enjoyed by anyone looking for a great story that's superbly acted.  This is truly a beautiful, classic story that the whole family can enjoy.  It really is a dramatisation that comes along once in a lifetime and one to be treasured.  It is a joy to curl up and watch it time and time again, and I simply cannot praise it highly enough.<br />For those who have enjoyed the dramatisation, I highly recommend the superb companion book entitled \\"The Making of Pride and Prejudice.\\"
B00006AG5N|5.0|After listening to this CD I am finally able to truly appreciate the songs that made Elvis The King of Rock'n'Roll. The sound is amazing. Others, who have not even attempted to listen to this CD, will attempt to rewrite history and minimize Elvis' cultural impact. Elvis always gave credit to his musical influences. The ignorant claim he somehow \\"stole\\" music while history shows he beautifully blended Country, R&B and Gospel in a way no other had before and recorded his knockout version of \\"That's All Right\\" about a year before anyone had heard of Chuck Berry. No one person can be credited with \\"inventing\\" Rock, but one artist earned a rightful place as \\"King\\" above all others with complete domination of music charts. As these 31 songs prove, Elvis was not confined to one style of music, he could \\"sing all kinds\\". No single compilation would ever be enough to capture the sheer volume of Elvis' greatest performances, but this collects 31 of his trans-Atlantic #1 hits, spanning 46 years, and is worthy of being the 1st or 101st Elvis album in a collection.
B00005YUNY|5.0|After 25 years, I have rediscovered Yes again. The sound quality and playing, both by Yes and the youthful orchestra is absolutely breathtaking and brings a crispness and vitality to the music missing from even the original recordings. High points on &quot;Close To The Edge&quot; and &quot;And You And I&quot; clearly show Yes' classical influence and their ability to arrange rock music on truly grand scale. But it is the epic &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot; that brings together every aspect of what Yes is capable of, and this 25 minute opus is both as subtle and as grand as anything Beethoven or Bach ever composed. From the triumphant march , to the frenzied battle and finally to the subdued final lament of &quot;...soon...&quot;, the musical journey this piece takes you on is amazing. The sound and picture quality of this disc make it a true classic.
B000000W5H|5.0|Sometimes considered \\"just another Stones album\\" It's Only Rock 'n' Roll was originally released Oct 18, 1974, it went to #1 in the US and #4 in the UK. Over the years Ronnie Wood's song It's Only Rock 'n' Roll has finally achieved the classic status it seemed destined for when it was written. More rewarding is that Keith's opus Time Waits For No One has also become recognized for the great work it is. And on top of all that, If You Can't Rock Me continues to get air and concert play at somewhat of a Stones standard. Not too shabby for just another Stones album. Most people know the music, so in my reviews I try to give you data on the sessions and interesting facts connected with the songs and the album. Here we go:<br />The sessions for It's Only Rock 'n' Roll ran over a long period of time, starting Nov 13-24, 1973 at Musicland Studios in Munich and running from Jan 14-28, 1974. It's Only Rock 'n' Roll (the song) was overdubbed and mixed and Fingerprint file and Luxury were cut at Mick's house (Stargroves) near Newbury from the Rolling Stones Mobile on April 10-15, 1974, and final mixing was done May 20-25 at Island Studios in London. Two songs were recorded that did not appear on the album, Through The Lonely Nights (which was released as the B side of the single It's Only Rock 'n' Roll) and Black Limousine (which was released on the album Tattoo You in 1981). The Stones also recorded two songs that have not been released, Drift Away and Living In The Heart Of Love. The album also included one song (Short And Curlies) from the Goat's Head Soup sessions in Nov and Dec of 1972 in Jamaica.<br />Interesting notes include:<BR>.....It's Only Rock 'n' Roll has a famous story behind it. Long before Ronnie Wood filled an open spot in the Stones lineup (finally becoming the only Stone not in the original band to be added to the percentage contracts), Mick and Keith were jamming at Ronnie's house (The Wick) in London. The way the story goes, when Mick realized the song wasforming from riffs Ronnie had started with Keith, he called George Chkiantz (who engineered the session) and remembering that he was a new father, offered to pay for a babysitter so George could record the jam. He arrived to record them and found David Bowie was part of the band too<BR>.....Mick Taylor's last song with the Stones was (get this) Till The Next Goodbye<BR>.....The cover painting was commissioned from Guy Peellaert[...]. This time he made them gods descending from a temple.<BR>.....The Glimmer Twins 1st appeared as producers on this album....the story goes that Mick and Keith were traveling incognito to South America via ship after the 1968 Rock And Roll Circus sessions. An older woman who spent most of the cruise in the bar with Mick and Keith kept trying to guess who they were and kept asking them to \\"give us a glimmer\\" of their identities.<br />This information comes from \\"It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones\\" by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own collection, with some of the notes from Davis' \\"Old Gods Almost Dead.\\"  Both books are available from amazon.com.
B000000WJZ|5.0|I will start by saying that Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness will always be my favourite pumpkins album. This album however is still a beautifully crafted masterpiece of brutal guitar riffs and mechanic drumming. Only recently have I began to listen to this album more after dismissing it as over complicated on the first few times. The Song that drew me back however was Mayonaise, a track that my brother loves and I was eventually persuaded to like. It beats all of James Iha's later work even on Mellon Collie and gives Siamese Dream alot more variety.<BR>The multi layered \\"Cherub Rock\\" is the best way to start of the album. It is a classic pumpkins tune that captivates even first time listeners. Blood thristy guitars reign supreme on Geek USA, Hummer, Quiet and Silverf*** whilst more melodic numbers like Sweet Sweet, Disarm and my personal favourite Spaceboy give this album the edge which holds the Smashing Pumpkins in their own league.<BR>This album is a great buy. For first time Pumpkins listeners or veterans although I'm sure most of those will have this album already. It is great to see how much the band had to offer before their Masterpiece Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness
B00000APLB|4.0|Love You Live was originally released  Sep 23, 1977.  It was recorded at Maple Leaf Gardens, Toronto (6-17-75), Earl's Court, London (5-21/26-76), Les Abattoirs, Paris (6-5/7-76), and the El Mocambo Club, Toronto (3-4/5-76).<br />Interesting notes include:<BR>.....The cover is by Andy Warhol.....photos of the Stones biting each other<BR>.....Margaret Trudeau, wife of Canadian Prime Minister Piere Trudeau, was present at the Toronto shows and made international headlines when she was accused of partying with the Stones, which was especially scandalous since Keith had been arrested for heroin trafficking on Feb 27th after he arrived in town for the El Mocambo Club shows.<br />This information comes from &quot;It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones&quot; by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own collection.
B00005YXZH|3.0|I do not pine for the days of the overrated Uncle T (this phrase alone will cause many to immediately click the \\"unhelpful\\" button) nor the days when Tweedy was at least interested in Being Tuneful. Everything I READ about Wilco tells me I should love them. Conceptually, I do love Wilco--that is, until I listen to their records. Some decent songs here, but some absolute clunkers too.<br />Self-conscious artfulness abounds here in its poetry and experimentalism, some of which is excellent and some, ah, not-so-good. Once again, a case of a band who is trying so damn hard to be \\"different and relevant\\" that they deliver gorgeous curiosities that fail to keep you coming back for more. Part of this is due to morbid pace and lack of tunes, and part due to the  air of \\"difference and relevance\\" aka self-importance. Sometimes a song needs to be left alone, and no ultra-hip analog synth patch can save it.<br />But they get credit for trying, and conceptually, this record is a piece of art. Its themes of distance and miscommunication are everywhere, and often the music reflects these themes. The craft involved in this record is an astonishing achievement. People will say \\"it's better than all the crap on the radio now.\\" But if that crap on the radio keeps you coming back to hear that one song you can't get out of your head, that's saying more than this album can do.
B00006F7S4|4.0|being an avid beck fan, i was first exposed to this newer material on past tours (the golden age dates back to mid 2000).  having had time to soak up where beck was headed, i was almost prepared for this album.  it still took me by surprise as i listened to the newer tracks.  this is beck at his clearest and most concentrated.  there is a very mellow and reflective tone to each song on this album (even the near funk of paper tiger.)  that said, for most beck fans coming off the energetic and funky midnite vultures, this record will feel like a complete whiplash.<BR>as i said, this is beck at his most clear and concentrated.  he conveys some powerful imagery and emotions all throughout.  absent are the drum samples, messy clumsy guitars and  the general quirkiness of the beck of the past.  however this new beck is not a beck without soul.  just a damaged one.
B00006F7S4|3.0|Its way too soon to review this. So, for the time being while listening to this dark and introspective thing, I find myself laughing while I pop this into my dvd player and see the track listing to the Red Hot Chili Peppers Mothers Milk album... Becks still got a sense of humor after all...

6304578458|5.0|This 1997 dark comedy is a great flick. John Cusack plays a former government agent turned independent hit man who has had enough, and is goaded, by his secretary (played by Cusack's sister Joan) to return to his 10th year High School reunion in Grosse Point, Michigan. This plan is seconded by his psychiatrist (Alan Arkin) who thinks it's a great idea for Martin Blank (John Cusack) to get away from \\"the business\\" for a while.<br />There, he's forced to confront the life he left behind. A life that has changed dramatically - his childhood home is now a mini-mart and the girl he abandoned on prom night (Minnie Driver) has become a local radio show host. In the midst of all this, a rival contract killer (Dan Aykroyd) is trying to either recruit him or kill him.<br />Directed by George Armitage and co-written by John Cusack, this is an engaging story that translates well on screen thanks to a great cast. A real find.
B00005K3NY|4.0|Scanners is a fantastic film, not surprisingly considering it was directed by David Cronenberg.<br />What an excellent idea. Drugs tested on pregnant women whose side effects give their children extreme mental powers. The plot is a little like \\"Highlander\\" but with brains replacing swords!<br />Definitely one to own....and the many sequels too.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for both kids and adults.  We don't have children, but the adults just found it hilarious.  Each time you watch it, you find some hidden item in the movie.<BR>I highly recommend it.
B000002JST|5.0|I know most people clammer over Back n Black as AC/DC's best, they're wrong! Let There Be Rock is simply one of the finest rock n roll albums ever released, it has an energy and intensity you just don't see very often. Sure Back n Black is a great album and has all the popular songs, but popular doen't always mean the best(think Brintney Spears), this is the defining AC/DC statement, blues based rock cranked, they are not a heavy metal band. Bon Scott brought a humor, energy and a psuedo punk feel to AC/DC that Brain Johnson lacks. Just listen to the Albums, especially those after Back n Black.<br />This album contains many of AC/DC's popular classics; Whole lotta Rosie, Let There Be Rock & Problem Child. But it also contains some overlooked gems in the AC/DC library; Go Down, Dog Eat Dog and especially OVERDOSE one of AC/DC's finest recordings ever. Hell Aint' A Bad Place to be and Bad Boy oBogie are great too. Back n Black is full of great songs, but it lacks the energetic imediacy of this album and introduces us to their doom and gloom period which isn't what they were about with Bon Scott. Musically(not a term often associated with them, which is unfortunate) basic and brilliant this is the AC/DC album to own, followed close behind by High Voltage, Powerage(An overlooked gem in itself), Highway to Hell and yes, Back n Black too. But Let there Be Rock is the highlight of the Bon Scott era, which was AC/DC at their peek.<br />If you just like good old fashioned Rock n Roll reminesant of Chuck Berry and other blues based originals, give this one a spin or any with Bon Scott, it is just simple straight ahead rock and roll, the likes of which has seldom been seen. It gives me a perma grin and shiver every time I listen to it.<br />The only thing that bothers me, is that the order of songs was changed from the original cassette tape I purchased and fell in love with.
B00006J3WH|5.0|There is no doubt in my mind that the sixth season episode &quot;Once More, With Feeling&quot; was written with Buffy fans in mind.  Definitely out of the ordinary for broadcast television (even UPN), it did something bold, daring, and inventive.  Singing on television?  Who would have imagined?<br />The performances are varied, from Amber (Tara) Benson's soft, sweet voice to the quirky Peter-Brady-esque novelty sound of Nicholas (Xander) Brendon.  Sarah Michelle Geller, despite her Slayer status, is probably the weakest performance, but she tries hard.  They all do.  And that's the point.  This group may not be ready for a concert at Carnegie Hall, but they perform well and add a new dimension to an already great series. Kudos to Joss Whedon for writing such a marvelous script!<br />The CD is high-quality.  For those who have watched the episode repeatedly, you may note some changes.  The sound effects and speaking parts have been edited out, which I have mixed feelings about.  One of my favorite moments in &quot;What You Feel&quot; is when the demon Sweet asks &quot;The Slayer?&quot; to which Dawn replies (in typical teenage fashion), &quot;Ya-huh.&quot;  Unfortunately, this little gem (and a few others) are not on the CD.<br />To make up for what is lost, there are some delightful additions.  &quot;The Parking Ticket&quot; is extended from what is heard in the show.  Likewise, &quot;Where Do We Go From Here?&quot; does not bleed into &quot;Coda,&quot; but stands on its own.  Perhaps the nicest treat, however, is the inclusion of three tracks from previous episodes including &quot;Restless,&quot; &quot;The Gift,&quot; and my personal favorite, &quot;Hush.&quot;<br />If you are a Buffy fan, this one is a must to add to your collection.  It's great music for reading, driving, or playing Buffy CCG.  Treat yourself to one before Halloween.
B000008COG|4.0|This is an underated album. In my opinion it is AC/DC's best album since Back n Black, with the exception of Who Made Who. It has the most different sound and direction of any AC/DC Album and I think that's why it suffers from low ratings and people saying its the worst, it is different. The production shows them trying to evolve and refine their sound quality, maybe a bit more popish then previous too. It was a great direction for them to go. It has a matured AC/DC sound that I find extremely appealing. I also think it is the only Brian Johnson cd, all the others are him trying to emulate Bon Scott, Blow up your Video was his. But anytime something is different then usual or what people expect, they complain. They want Back n Black regurgitated to them over and over again. So AC/DC has gone backwards instead of forwards since then, and have been paying for it, with the exception of a few songs on the Razor's Edge everything else has kinda [not good].<br />I'm listening to this album while writing this. This is a good Album, the weakest song is This Means War, and its not that bad,just a little annoying. The rest are all good songs, certainly better then most of the [stuff] passing for rock and roll in 2002. Its much better then; For those about to Rock, Flick of the Switch, Fly on the Wall or any of those after it.<br />AC/DC is my Favorite Band, this was the 1st AC/DC album I bought (in 1988) so maybe I'm biased, there is just something about their music that feels right to me. Even as I age and find new music they are still the one. Led Zepplin may be the best Band ever, Tool the best thing since the 90's, Sinead O'conner the best female vocalist, Pj Harvey the Coolist, Pink Floyd the most ambient, Janes Addiction the Heirs to Led Zepplins thrown, the Red Hot Chilli Peppers the funkiest and Johnny Cash and Henry Rollins are, well, just who they are, but AC/DC is my Band. This album represents what could have been.

B000003TSP|2.0|I gave this album two stars for a very simple reason.  I dont desire to play it often in my cd player.  I couldnt get Dummy out of my system for 6 months straight! Yet, this album was digested in less than a month.  I gave it an honest listen.  It is not without highlights, check out the big band sound of ALL MINE.  For the most part though, you may feel as though you are listening to the background sounds of a haunted house.  There is an artistic integrity to delving into the deep and dark places on an album, but this one sinks so far down that I dont bother to visit it often.
6304698623|5.0|&quot;I am a Princess. All girls are. Even if they live in tiny old attics. Even if they live in rags. Even if they aren't pretty, or young, or smart, they're still princesses. All of us! Didn't your father ever tell you that? Didn't he?&quot;<br />Well no. My Dad didn't call me a princess, and that's because I'm a guy. But after seeing this movie, I was really beginning to wish I was. &quot;A Little Princess&quot; is quite simply amazing. It is the most magical family movie there is. I just can't recommend it high enough. I saw this at the movie theater, 7 times and it is quite easily my favorite film of all time.<br />Set in 1914, &quot;A Little Princess&quot; tells the story of a girl called Sara who goes to a strict boarding school while her father from England goes to fight the War. The school is run by a mean spirited head teacher called Miss Minchin. From the start, Miss Minchin is jealous of Sara who considers herself to be a princess. After all, her Papa has told her that she will always be his little princess. Despite the harshness of Miss Minchin, Sara continues to fill those around her with magic as she tells stories to them of a beautiful princess and her prince.<br />The emotion begins early in this movie, firstly being when Sara and her Papa say goodbye as he goes into war. Midway through the movie Sara hears that her Papa has been killed in battle. I have to say, when I watched this I was gone. Ok I wasn't gone yet, but I was holding the tears in. Actress Liesel Matthews who plays Sara is so genuine, and director Alfonso Cuaron definitely brings out the best in her. It is at the end which is complimented by the music of Patrick Doyle, that I really did feel a few tears going by my face. It happened just after Sara realized she may truly have lost her father forever.<br />The DVD itself just has a trailer and it would be great if it had more extras, but the moie is just so wonderful that you have to buy this DVD. In addition, the subtle Dolby Digital 5.1 is just right for a movie such as this.<br />&quot;A Little Princess&quot; made my heart feel so much, and I really felt like a girl, getting upset over a family movie like this. I guess I was getting in touch with my inner princess. Maybe I am a princess after all.5.1 is just right for a movie such as this.  <br />&quot;A Little Princess&quot; made my heart feel so much, and I really felt like a girl, getting upset over a family movie like this.

0316666343|5.0|I rarely dabble in fiction, and if i DO,I stick to crime thrillers, Patterson, Cornwell, ect. This book, which I experienced in audio- unabridged, captivated me from start to mystical finish. The innocence of Susie persists despite her coming of age as she grows while observing from heaven. A concept of heaven and life beyond, reminescent of the film What Dreams May Come, frees the reader to take comfort in the knowledge that they too will someday create their own heaven.  The reader on the tape was seductive and kept my attention with appropriate emotion and meter.  The story takes you through a full spectrum of emotion but pleasantly and leaves you pondering your own reactions to the events as they unfold. Like any great audiobook, I found myself yelling at the dashboard, fighting back tears, and sitting in the garage well beyond getting home to finish a chapter. Enjoy.
B000069AUI|4.0|I have to admit, I was at first apprehensive to hear the second cd, because of the fate that takes on many acts that make it big with their first cd; they usually fall short of empty filler with a radio hit (if theyre lucky).  <BR>This collection of songs here are just as good as the first album, if not sweeter.   <br />The lead singer's voice still manages to soothe and carry me away, even if he does sound like a cross between Dave Matthews and Thom Yorke (radiohead).  <br />In My Place, in my humble opinion, is a better single than either trouble or yellow.  SCIENTIST is also a great peice, and happens to be the personal fav of the band.<br />Any way you look at it, if you pick up this album you will not be disappointed.  It works for listening to when your alone in your car, and its great for laying in bed with a special someone, as the backdrop of a special night.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This album essentially picks up where Mutations left off with more of Beck's &quot;space-age folk music&quot;.  Sea Change is definitely a darker album though. You'll find none of the upbeat funky stuff like on Odelay or Midnight Vultures but in my opinion this some of Beck's best work.  Acoustic and electric instruments along with strings and electronic effects are blended seemlessly to create a haunting atmosphere over which Beck sleepily delivers his downbeat lyrics.  Standout tracks include the opening 'Golden Age' along with 'Guess I'm Doing Fine' and 'Round the Bend'. This is an amazing, beautiful record. <BR>5-stars!
B00005221L|5.0|It takes a pretty mean monster to make Schwarzenegger shake in his boots.<br />An elite cadre of military rescue specialists find themselves stuck in a hostile jungle, pursued by an enemy they cannot see. One by one, they are picked off, until only the team leader (Schwarzenegger) is left to face the invisible foe. Nothing could prepare him for the truth--his opponent is a trophy hunter from another world. And it's armed to the teeth.<br />Because &quot;Predator&quot; is a somewhat hokey premise, it would have been an easy movie to screw up. Instead, it fires on all cylinders. The jungle combat is deftly staged, and the characters are memorable and entertaining. The cast oozes (I'm not done) testosterone, so check your politically-correct sensitivity at the door (and almost everyone is called by their last names). Nonetheless, you feel for these poor guys, once you get a hint of what's after them.<br />The big payoff comes when the creature is finally revealed. Stan Winston and company designed one of the perfect movie villains, human or otherwise. The late Kevin Peter Hall can never get enough credit for his performance; his body language and menacing stature perfectly enhance the Predator's frightening appearance.<br />As a DVD, &quot;Predator&quot; doesn't make much of an impression. I'm holding out hope for a more in-depth special edition, including some pictures or footage of the (hilarious) creature they ALMOST used. However, the sound and picture quality are decent, and make much more of an impact than my old VHS copy.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's cd is great, it has a different sound.  She has a great voice, and she is different.  ...  That is just smart.  Avril happens to have a good sound, ....  AVRIL IS COOL. MY OPINION.
044022165X|5.0|I have been a huge John Grisham fan since I first read The Street Lawyer.  After seeing the movie, I decided I had to read this book.  The book is always better than the movie and I found that thsi held true here too.  Grisham paints his characters so vividly that even if you haven't seen the movie, you can still picture them in your mind.  He spins a heart wrenching story along side of a few others, of a young boy dying of cancer.  Rudy, the young law student picks up the boys parents, dot and Buddy as \\"clients\\" because of a school assignment.  At first he doesn't realize what he is getting himself into.  At the end, he makes history.  I found this book impossible to put down.  The realness of the places and people he described are amazing.  I would honestly have to say it is the best Grisham book I have read yet.
B00006AG5N|5.0|I think the cd is great and the sound is the best it's been on these recordings.  For those who don't like Elvis, don't buy  his music and keep your rants  to yourself.  Let others enjoy his music.
B00005RZV4|5.0|NI?<br />Wednesday 25th September 12:47pm<br />Well.. on Monday I noticed that I had more money in my bank account than usual so I decided that I would travel into town and purchse some new music. I wasoriginally looking at some Sly Robbie a reggae/dub group, I headed over to the Metal section and thought I know I'll buy 'Bitter Suites To Succubi' by Cradle of Filth, once I saw the price of $... I thought ... that, it wasn't worth it for $... amd I've never heard any Cradle before so had no idea what it was like. I had asked my fiancee earlier which cd I should buy, she said Fear Factory, as I already had 'Demanufacture', 'Remanufacture' and 'Obsolete' I pulled out 'Digimortal' to browse the discography, then I saw the new NIN album, 'And All That Could Have Been' the word \\"LIVE\\" was calling my name as this was NIN's only official live album and I knew this would be the jewel in my collection of 'Pretty Hate machine', 'The Downward Spiral', 'The Fragile' and 'Things Falling Apart'. I took my selections up to the counter and the cashier brought down off the 'top shelf' the Deluxe edition with the 16 tracks from the Fragility 2.0 Tour and the \\"still\\" cd containing 9 tracks, he asked if he could interest me in buying it and that it was a real collectors item and the price of $... NZ dollars reflected that, (think that's $... USD) I listened to it and thought ... it I'll buy it, and was elated when I had purchased it, I had in my hands an apparently \\"rare collectors item\\" with me being cynical I would have believed that he pulled another copy out to replace the one I had bought. I got it home and my cd player in my computer which I run out to my sound system as my player ...WOULDN'T pick it up, I was so gutted!! evidently I purchased a 48x CD ROM drive of a friend for $..., that fixed it!. Now for 3 days I have been playing Trent's vocals and the sweet harmonys NIN produces over and over. <br />What I've been trying to find out is, just how rare is The Deluxe embossed boxed set of 'And All That Could Have Been', I believe if I read it correctly that it was selling for $... here in New Zealand when it first came out, and I bought it for $..., does that mean it's jumped in value or did I just get ripped of as far as the music shop was concerned?. Also just how far would a collector go to have a copy of this album if it was as scarce as the music stored try to have me believe, would he fork out big bucks for a mint condition copy?. Not that I'm selling it, EVER!!! I'll be listening to it when I'm 48, (my father's age).
B00006F7S4|5.0|As a follow up to Midnight Vultures in chronology, this<BR>disc is a real follow up to Mutations, arguably Beck's<BR>most musically creative effort.  A few seconds listening<BR>to &quot;Sea Change&quot; and you gain more insight into<BR>Beck's curious mind than listening to all of &quot;Odelay.&quot;<br />If you're looking for ultra-sampled pop, it's not here.<BR>This is dark, moody and beautifully depressing music.<BR>For Beck, his best thus far.  We're seeing the true<BR>artist inside him.  Highly recommend it.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Awesome compilation of Evlis' best!  The songs have never sounded better!  Ignore the first review by Rich from Boston.  He apparently likes to bash just about everything he buys.  Read some of his other reviews.  He gives out &quot;0 Stars&quot; more than any other reviewer I've ever seen on here.  Not to mention that he wrote his review before he even heard the CD.  Get a life Rich!  To the rest of you, buy this CD!
B00005R87Q|5.0|This movie kicks...!!!  Anyone who has ever been part of the street racing scene will appreciate it's accurate portrayl that the movie displays!  Girls, fast cars, and having fun...that's what it is all about!  Who cares if the plot is ...predictable!  Supras, RX-7's, Skylines, tricked-out Civics...what more do you need in a movie :)
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Saw this DVD recently - a few friends of mine had hated it, but the reviews here on Amazon encouraged me to give it a try, and i must say i'm not disappointed.<br />This is not a movie to be watched if you want an escape, laughs or tender moments. However, if you'd like to see a movie that demands your full attention to work out what might be going on, then this is a good choice.<br />I found the idea of coping with a condition where one has no short-term memory quite intriguing. I felt that Guy Pierce did a really good job of playing a complex role, and Carrie Ann Moss & Joe Pantiliano were pretty good too.<br />Christopher Nolan does a great job of intelligently directing what must have been quite a challeging movie to make. The editing, central to this movie, was quite smartly done.<br />I don't mind watching this movie once more, perhaps even backwards !!<br />That having been said, this is the kind of movie that you'd either like to watch again & again, or else regret having seen even once.

B000002UKS|5.0|With the success of their debut cd, the Foo Fighters have made a name for themselves as a decisive rock band. Now they take their next step with their sophomoric LP, The Colour and The Shape. While the debut cd was an introduction to the Fighters their follow-up lets you really get to know them. With powerful tunes like the driven \\"Monkey Wrench\\" the pulsing \\"My Hero\\" and the wrenching \\"Everlong\\" the Foo Fighters far surpass the standards of their debut. From beginning to end, it's a brilliant album. They start off with the minute and a half ballad, \\"Doll\\" then crash into \\"Monkey Wrench\\" pulling you out of your seat. The Foo Fighters also prove they can do more than just rock out. The load the cd with amazing power ballads like \\"February Stars\\" where you start off barely able to hear the soothing lyrics of Dave Grohl to banging your head to his screams. Since the death of Kurt Cobain and Grohl's end of his career as Nirvana's drummer he has made himself out to be quite the singer-songwriter. He also demonstrates his excellent music skills, playing guitar and drums on all but half of one track. The Foo Fighters have outshined the common sophomoric slump and came out with the best Foo Fighters album to date. 9.9/10 Highlights: \\"My Hero\\" \\"Everlong\\" \\"Monkey Wrench\\" \\"New Way Home\\"
B000000H3Z|5.0|I bought this cd a few years ago. This is the cd that made me fall in love with sepultura's music. I've bought every cd by them. And I have seen them preform live. This is my favorite band of all time.<br />Plus <BR>primitive future is my favorite song on here
B00006LHYC|5.0|She is really amazing, after 10 years with 20.000 sold cds around the world she decide start in USA & Canada with her first album in english called 'From the Inside'. The album is great. I have the oportunity of listen 4 songs from this album and it's really incredible. These album have 12 songs and 4 are It's not goodbye (original version of In Assenza di te), Every day is a Monday (original version of Il mio Sbaglio Pi Grande), Without You and Surrender. The first hit for US are Surrender write by John Shanks (The Corrs, Michelle Branch) and at moment it's a big hit in Canada.<BR>You need buy this amazing debut album. Pausini is really fantastic and she also sing in Portuguese, Spanish, Italian and English. Later she will French! Yeah! Go on Laura!<BR>Don't lose this oportunity for listen good music.<BR>Alexander - Belgium
B00006IU73|5.0|This is probably the strongest PTree effort yet.  New drummer Gavin Harrison is well-integrated into the sound, and the elasticity of the rhythm section is not hurt by his addition.  Steven Wilson continues to explore vocal harmonies, and &quot;In Absentia&quot; has perhaps the most of any PTree album.  However, there is a harder edge to this material than on either &quot;Stupid Dream&quot; or &quot;Lightbulb Sun&quot; and some of the more experimental sonic textures will delight longtime fans.  &quot;Trains&quot; may be the band's best &quot;pop&quot; song yet, and more expansive material like &quot;Blackest Eyes&quot; and the slyly titled &quot;The Creator Has a Mastertape&quot; score direct hits.  In &quot;Wedding Nails,&quot; the band has written their most energetic instrumental since &quot;Signify.&quot;  This is a worthwhile record for longtime fans, progressive rock fans, and modern hard rock fans - no small feat.
B00005YTFG|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie.  If you like romance, then this movie is for you.  Especially if you liked Romeo and Juliet, the old version.  I found these two movies similar.  The first time my brother rented this movie, I had no interest to watch it because it looked boring.  One day I just started watching it while home alone and it was a beautiful movie.  The songs were beautiful.  It never crossed my mind how much I would enjoy this movie but the fact is that I did and I would watch it again, not counting the two times that I already did.
6304479689|5.0|I bought this film about 3 months ago and I am in need of a new one... I was 6 when he died and I feel that I missed out on something great. This is a way to see Elvis out there knocking them dead and it gives those of us that were too young to see the magic of Elvis, as it was going on.<br />By the end of the film I was crying my eyes out... Elvis may have put on some pounds, but he still had the magic that captured many hearts...  When he wore that cape, I thought of him as the super hero of Rock...<br />As I watched it for the first time 3 months ago... I believe that Elvis spirit was there with me... I let the tears flow, but I had a warm feeling in my heart... He did touch me through this movie... MGM... Please put this on DVD, PLEASE????
B00005JKWJ|4.0|But then that's the point, isn't it?  Better than the first one, with some pretty gruesome and well-realized special effects, and an interesting plot (for an action-horror movie).  Recently saw it again, and it held up for a second viewing, which must mean it's pretty good. I won't give anything away, because it's absolutely worth watching.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is a moment of true Renaissance in the animated film genre. Yes we had Sleeping Beauty, Fantasia, Snow White,but they were all merely place markers along the highway leading to this Disney film. This film is a sensitive, humorous romance that anyone can watch, at any age, with anyone, without ever having to cringe from something occuring on screen that is childish or ridiculous. It is a lot like that with the film E.T. Many have refused to see it due to the hype, but found it overwhelmingly engaging once they had finaly viewed it. This film is so visually stunning and so heart touching in it's screenplay that you will pull it out at least once a year for the rest of your life to relive the moments of magic that define this true classic of American animation and film making.
B00006AFUR|5.0|First off, 30 Seconds To Mars have created their own sound which is inarguably unique only to themselves. It's kinda hard to describe the exact nature of their sound. Heavy guitars, synthesizers, atmospheric effects and hypnotic, mesmerizing vocals are the trademark of the 30 Seconds To Mars sound.<BR>The band creates images of some sort of a post-apocalyptic universe through the songs and the lyrics which are probably metaphorical in nature and are sometimes difficult to interpret which makes the album even more interesting!.<BR>The album starts off with &quot;Capricorn (A Brand New Name)&quot;, which is a perfect example of what the band is capable of offering on the rest of the CD. &quot;Echelon&quot; (my favorite song off the album) is probably the most atmospheric track. Other standout tracks include the apocalyptic &quot;The End Of The Beginning&quot;, &quot;Oblivion&quot; , the very enigmatic &quot;Buddha For Mary&quot; and &quot;Fallen&quot;, which features the heaviest chorus parts on the CD. The rest of the songs are pretty good too with each having an identity of it's own and there's never a dull moment or a track which you would skip while listening to the CD.<BR>Jared Leto's vocals are awesome! It's amazing how his voice can take on so many dimensions. The guitar work is amazing and goes perfectly with the theme of the songs. They have their heavy parts without being aggressive.<BR>The album also rates high on production values as it sounds very crisp, thus improving the overall appeal of the music.<BR>30 Seconds To Mars definately have one of the most highly anticipated rock releases of this year, and rightly so, their debut self-titled album has certainly created a mark on today's rock scene which has already been saturated with the unspiring nu-metal sound.<BR>In the end, this is an album which is highly recommended for any rock fan, since albums and bands like this come out once in a while! So grab a copy, hit the play button, sit back and enjoy theride!
B000067CPX|5.0|I'm not exactly a huge fan of RHCP but I do like some of their songs, mostly from their previous album \\"Californication\\". I wasn't even planning on buying \\"By the Way\\" but as I heard the title track more and more, I grew to love the song. I knew I had to get the album. I have heard quite a bit of RHCP's earlier music back in the early '90s, late '80s. I definitely like the band's recent material. I just can't get into their more raw, hip hop infused rock music. I like the more mature sound that the Chili Peppers have obviously developed in the past few years. I really loved how the Chili Peppers did a 180 and incorporated orchestral strings in \\"Midnight\\" and flamenco guitar in \\"Cabron\\". I especially dug \\"Cabron\\". Anthony's voice sounds so rich and warm. \\"Dosed\\", \\"Tear\\", and \\"The Zephyr Song\\" are two of the most gorgeous RHCP ballads I have ever heard, and to be honest I have never been wild about their ballads up until \\"Californication\\" and now \\"By the Way\\". Those three tracks are simply stunning to listen to. Despite my dislike for the band's earlier music, I always did think that Anthony Kiedis had a awesome voice. He sounds better than ever on \\"By the Way\\". I am all for growth in a band's sound, especially for a band that has been around for as long as the Red Hot Chili Peppers been. To expect the band to keep churning out \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\\" is awfully selfish for fans. \\"By the Way\\" is just a awesome rock record. Probably the best rock record in mainstream music right now.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Queen is one of those rare bands that will never be matched, it's been said before, but Freddie's voice really was the best. And Finally the Platinum collection is available in the USA, If your new to Queen I recommmend this set, If your an old time fan to, because you've probably only heard 1/3 of the set, that being the 70's hits.  It's almost the exact same thing as Greatest Hits I-II (with the exception of GH III), but the disks have their original covers, not the gold ones, and The booklet is a alot better. How could you pass this up? It's the same price as the other one. You've got their beginning work such as the ever-so-popular BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY, Deacon's ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST, The 2 \\"double sided\\" singles FAT BOTTOMED GIRLS/BICYCLE RACE and WE WILL ROCK YOU/WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS and all the stuff in between.  Then the later work such as the Bass/synth driven BREAKTHRU, classic 80's soft rock like A KIND OF MAGIC and UNDER PRESSURE, not to mention some of their heaviest, I WANT IT ALL, HEADLONG, ONE VISION, and HAMMER TO FALL.  But the Real bonus is the 3rd CD, capturing solo work, remixes, stuff from MADE IN HEAVEN, and songs that got lost in the shuffle. Don't waste your time with stuff that's being played today because it's popular, get the GOOD stuff!!!
0684869713|5.0|After all that I had heard about this novel I was disposed to dislike it, expecting it to be full of thinly disguised political viewpoints.  I am now so glad I had an open mind and was prepared to read it for myself before jumping to ill considered conclusions.  The political perspective is presented, but in no way intrudes on the plot if you do not wish to involve yourself in it.  The story is of the struggle of two young architects to achieve their differing ambitions, which does not sound on the face of it particularly gripping.  However Rand through her excellent characterization and her depiction of the violence of Roark's struggle against convention and the contrast of the almost prostitutional nature of Keating's rise held me spellbound.  Treachery, violence, rejection, manipulation and dominance are just some of the themes Rand explores though this fantastic novel.  The politics behind the story, well I guess it's interesting if not compelling, but not nearly as interesting as the story.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I never used to turn to music as an influence or a way to impact my life until I started listening to &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; by incubus. I've always loved music but just never paid much attention to the lyrics as an inspiration. &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; is a song that means a lot to me because it reminds me of one of my close friends that I care a lot about. This CD allows my mind to wander off and think about many different aspects of life. Now that I have recognized the influence music can have on my life I am able to relate so many memories to various songs. Listening to Incubus really puts me in a certain mood that no other CD can do and reminds me of a certain someone that I really appreciate.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Buffy the Vampire Slayer has been my favorite show since as long as I can remember... The episode titled, \\"Once More, With Feeling\\". The music from the episode is spectacular! ...Once I got my hands on the CD with all, yes that's right, ALL the songs from the episode I realized how good a CD could actually be! I have never listened to a soundtrack more than this one.  The songs are clear and consice, and when you listen to the same ones over and over again (not that I did that) you can finally understand all of the hidden messages between each line. All of the extra thoughts for each verse, each song, each and every line. The songs come out great, and the perfect, mistake free... this songs are all sung by the cast players themselves, and that's the best part!  you CAN sing along with the people singing...  Don't get me wrong, you're not going to get this CD and think, \\"this [stinks]\\". Oh no no no no no! it has some pretty good singers. Amber Benson (who plays Tara) and Anthony Stewart Head (He's Giles) could be professionals... You'll see when you hear their solo songs, and the duet they sing which is strung together perfectly. Plus, all the songs still comes out funny and hilarious, and sung as fine as any somewhat above average singer can do. It also comes out with a beautiful cover for it and a listing of each song. Don't miss it!! buy it as soon as you can! you'll see what I mean as soon as you get your own copy. They're great and squeaky clean and wonderfully  written pieces, that you'll actually be able to sing along to...
0316666343|3.0|When you first hear the premise of \\"The Lovely Bones\\", about murdered fourteen-year-old Susie Salmon looking down from heaven and narrating the aftermath of the crime on her family, friends, and even the killer himself, how could you not be intrigued? And reading the book is certainly not un-worthwhile.<br />For the first 4 or 5 chapters I was truly swept away, but then slowly, the brilliant concept that makes the story so original grows to become its downfall. In order for the book's countless characters to remain interesting while being observed from such a lofty point (heaven), each person would have to be twice as sharp and vividly drawn as any character in a more traditional narrative. They're not. I constantly found myself asking \\"Now who is this person again?\\". They're described with different names, and they look different from one another, and live in different places, but we never get a real, visceral feeling from each of them. Instead, we're left watching them all from a distance, as though trying to discern them through a blurry telescope.<br />Speaking objectively about TLB as literature and without sentimentality, the plot is very slender and stretched to its absolute limit across a meager 328 pages. I kept turning them, waiting for a climax, a moment of resolution and closure, but it never quite happens. \\"The Lovey Bones\\" evaporates into a mist.<br />To her credit, author Alice Sebold could have easily succumbed to making TLB so gruesome and sad as to be unreadable, but she always stays just this side of overstatement.<br />A good novel, but not a great one.
B0000584V3|5.0|While some may feel that the previous intensity present in albums like \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\" are not heard in \\"Blackwater Park\\", this album is a more mature effort by Mikael Akerfeldt & Co. A number of the songs on this album still rip and roar very much, but the emphasis on clean vocals and highly emotive, poetic lyrics is a bit more obvious here. Combined with the absolutely excellent production quality on this album, \\"Blackwater Park\\" makes for a superb addition to what has already become a legendary musical career in terms of technical superiority, masterful songwriting, and provocative lyrics. As many other reviewers have said regarding Opeth, this band is difficult to classify into any specific genre (aside from maybe 'rock' in general; but that's even pushing it). Their alternating patterns of beautiful, heartfelt lyrics and ominous, hell-inspired roars creates a soundscape that many bands only wish they could be part of. The acoustic parts of this album seem to fit the mood very well, while the death metal influence cannot be denied in the heavier portions of this disc. Opeth is truly a unique band deserving of the hype and highly respected status so many listeners attribute to these masters of the musical experience.
0783217048|5.0|I can only say 3 words about this movie(WE LOVED IT). My straight friends and I watch this movie at least once a week, this movie has Open the eyes to my friends about my lifestyle and the way I live everyday life, Because I live my life has a transsexaul and I live in a small Town where some people don't care for that way of life . I moved away and came back to a new place Because, I was determain to stay here, open my own business and live my life has a pre-op, Thanks to this movie I have done just that and I have the respect of the community. So, instead of going to the local post office, or the court house and hearing childess giggles, I hear Good-Day, Miss Robyn How are you? It maybe because the town has grown-up But, I like to think it,s Because I saw Too Wong Foo, and as they did in the movie I took my place, stood my ground, and never let no one run my life except for myself and the sprit of the wong foo! I now have the most profitable business in town, So, I do belive EVERYONE should not only watch this movie, But, buy it ! Oh, how it does lift the sprits!  Julie Newmar made the way for women like us! I am very greatful.  forever, Robyn from Lafayette.
B00005RG6B|5.0|I am admittedly an Operation Mindcrime freak - the album and it's incredible story and musicianship consumed me and a group of my friends many years ago in high school.  I got to see Queensryche perform on this tour and it is still one of my favorite concerts to this day.  This DVD captures the the excitement, intensity, and most of all the atmosphere of Mindcrime.  Add flawless performances by the band, an incredible mix and sound production (I listened with headphones in Dolby stereo, although Dolby 5.1 is an option in the menu if you're NOT watching at midnight with your wife sleeping in the next room!), and fantastic video production and you've got a video version that not only does justice to the original album, but surpasses it in the 'chills up my back' factor.  If you ever debated whether Mary was murdered or killed herself, then you need to buy this DVD now, because you're a freak too, and you will LOVE this concert. If you're not a freak, buy it anyway and you will be!!! Special features could have been better, but the interview with Geoff Tate is awesome (but too short), and occasionally whoever edited the concert video clips together goofed up on synching the video to the audio - a minor gripe that probably wouldn't bother anyone else at all.
0316666343|5.0|I found this book to be enchanting and mesmerizing.  I<BR>wanted to stay in the dead girl's Heaven with her and learn more about what she saw and her observations about her sad family, friends and killer.<br />This is a very  naturalistic style of writing.  It's so good you almost don't &quot;notice&quot; the style...it's...organic, I guess you could call it.<br />Unlike other reviewers, I loved the ending, and found tears rolling down my face as the final words were uttered. I hadn't realized how touched I was until the dead girl let us go with a sweet, simple and kindly farewell. This book is a  joy and will probably become a classic.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|Directed by Irvin Kershner (THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK), the aptly-titled NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN saw Sean Connery return to the big screen as James Bond, and while he's good, the film itself is far from spectacular. Starting off with a distinctly &quot;un-official&quot; title track, the action feels somewhat laboured and un-involving. The plot, which is basically a remake of THUNDERBALL plays the same, but lacks interest this time round. Instead of Q we get the sinus-problematic Algernon, some so-so villians and Rowan Atkinson looks rather out of place. However, Max von Sydow is good as Blofeld and the buxom Kim Basinger as Domino does the obligatory &quot;Bond chick&quot;. Both NSNA and OCTOPUSSY were released at the same time. In comparison, the latter is more exciting. There are several impressive action sequences, but nobody does it better than MGM. The rating's actually closer to 2 1/2, but Connery's performance bumps it up. Not to say that it dosn't have it's merits, but this one is strictly for 007 fans only.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This album contains 31 of ELV1S' number 1's from US and UK (they wouldn't ALL fit). All of these songs are classics. While it would not be possible to get a complete picture of the enormous genius of the world's greatest recording artist on a single cd, this does manage to give a glimpse of some of his qualities. Most people will find many of their favourites on this cd.<br />The sound quality on this cd is much enhanced from previous albums. All the songs have been remastered from the origonal tapes and the ELV1S voice is really clear on every track. Buy it. You will not be dissapointed
B0000520Q2|4.0|Road Trip is another great classic college movie. Four very different guys from Ithaca University go on a journey across the country to prevent a long distance girlfriend from viewing an accedently sent sex tape.  Driving through back country roads, sleeping at cheap motels, stopping at a sperm bank for cash, and even stealing a bus from a blind school, these guys go on the most life-changing adventure of their lives. In this movie, each guy learns an important lesson or experiences some type of self-discovery that many of its viewers can relate to.  Besides being a plot that most college students or teens can associate with, Road Trip is also a hilarious, perverted comedic experience.  I have heard many relate this film to such classics as Animal House or the more recent American Pie.  This film can be seen over and over, and it is funnier every time I watch it.  I believe Road Trip is an awesome movie to own!
0380778556|3.0|The book Febecca is the story about a young woman that falls in love with a rich man called Maxim de Winter, who owns Manderley, a great, luxurious house in Cornwall. They live together in Manderley, but Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, cast her shadow on that house. Rebecca died some time ago, and nobody knows exactly why. The drama increases with a lot of problematic monents and talks until the moment when Maxim tells his wife his horrible secret. The book is worth reading but I think there are better books and stories, and anyway it isn't the kind of book I like reading.
B000002HPV|5.0|Bjork continues to innovate and inspire,Homogenic  can simply be described as a fusion of musical poetry sometimes delving into  obscurity but that is what makes every listen diferent. Every track holds it's own but also compliments each other to create a piece of musical mastery hence becoming an epic of the human condition and  emotion.Joga the first single is overflowing with emotion that bursts into tears amongst the backdrops of lucious strings in contrast Pluto screams and instills the darker sides of the huamn mind and desperation.All is full  of love ends this lush album with a sense of bliss appropriate to its long sometimes tiring but never boring musical journey.
0971855110|5.0|If you're reading this review, you're probably born disorganized and been losing ground ever since;) Or perhaps you should be folding laundry, making the kids lunch or figuring out what's going to be on the dinner table tonight, especially since you took that mystery meat out of the freezer.<br />Well, this is the book for you. Marla Cilley's mantra is &quot;you can do anything for 15 minutes&quot; and doggone it, she's right. This isn't one of those quicky fixes that is so often put out by folks whose ideas of straightening up the living room is fanning the magazines out in a nice display on the coffee table. This is for folks that are ear deep in junk (or deeper)  and need to get out from under the load of it.<br />Her plan is simple and is based loosely on &quot;The Sidetracked Sisters&quot; works. You take 15 minutes to straighten out an area. I know, I know, you're saying &quot;15 minutes! that doesn't even hit on it!&quot; but it's just a beginning. You learn that you don't have to do everything perfect and you don't have to wait until the kids move out or you get that burst of energy you've been hoping for - you just get up and do it.<br />Sounds simple, right? So why do you need _this_ book? Because if it were that simple, you would have done it already. Because you need somebody who has been there to help walk you out of there.<br />Because getting rid of the clutter has a ripple effect in your life. Because if you read this far, you know you're searching for the answer for your problem. This isn't an easy fix, but your home didn't get to be a mess in one day and it will take more than one day to declutter...unless you_really_ want to maintain the life you're living.<br />And you know you don't - so buy it and work the system. You'll probably miss not having mystery meat for dinner, but it's such a small price to pay;)
B00006AG5N|5.0|I've been listening to some of these songs for over 40 years and they never sounded better--very clear and crisp.  Such remixing as has been done did not, to my ears, change the originals into noticeably different songs (except the JXL remix, of course).  The CD runs almost 80 minutes.  To get everything on one CD the producers include only one side of some double sided #1's in the UK, so that, for example, &quot;One Night&quot; is included, but &quot;I Got Stung&quot; is not .  Also, Billboard has apparently recomputed their charts, and &quot;I Want You, I Need You, I Love You&quot; is no longer counted as a #1 hit, but &quot;Burning Love&quot; , previously listed as a #2 hit, is now considered as a #1.  A great buy.
0316776963|4.0|this is a great book to read while working out. It will keep you laughing and unaware of the pain you may be in. I can't wait for David's next book!
0385503954|4.0|Like others, I was prepared to be disappointed by a book that had been so touted as a masterpiece. Not having read any of McEwan's other works, I find it impossible to judge whether Atonement is a personal best; but while it does fall short of masterpiece status (another user compared it to Lolita!?), it is extremely accomplished and literate. The book is divided into three parts: parts two and three are told from 2 separate characters' points of view, and frankly, they disappointed me. The bar was set very high by part one, which encompasses the minds of several of the characters, narrating their everyday observations and epiphanies in the Woolfian tradition. In fact, the section could almost be a parody of, say, To the Lighthouse--that novel's author is actually rather preciously referenced in part three--were it not for the fact that it is exquisitely well-written. The plot is tight and urgent (definitely a departure from Woolf); and the prose is gorgeous, luminous. While I wish that McEwan had continued in this vein for the rest of the book, rather than abandoning the stylized approach for a more conventional one, the progression of the plot and characters justifies a less crystalline prose. Too bad, though, that the author couldn't find a more arresting voice for his heroine's adulthood. Nonetheless, Atonement in its entirety is certainly better than other books being hailed as masterpieces these days (The Lovely Bones, The Corrections); and part one alone is more than worth the price of admission.
B00006690G|5.0|but the man has real talent, and I love it.  He's got a way with words and an even greater way with rhythm.  It's not for children, but it's a great CD for young adults and up.  He's got a lot to say about some really interesting things.  If parents are upset, they should listen to it WITH their kids and use it to open discussion about what the kids think and feel.
B000002U83|5.0|There are certain cornerstones to the development of Rock music that simply cannot be ignored.  This is the most important cornerstone of them all. It is not just Pink Floyd's milestone album, it is argueably progressive rock's most important album in that it gave the gift of musical experimentation to the masses.  All that can be further said is buy the album, the reasons why it was so widely accepted and appreciated are self-evident.
B00006DEF9|1.0|Really, what's the point?  Who on earth would buy this?  I guess if folks don't mind losing up to 50% of the original movie, then they should go ahead and get this edition.  Me, I'll wait to see the WHOLE movie when they release it widescreen.
B0000542D2|1.0|I just purchased the DVD of A Hard Days Night by The Beatles. I've have been waiting with anticipation for this DVD for quite some time. I was appauled when I put the disc in and found that the top and bottom off of the film to make it appear as though it's in a widescreen format. I've been viewing this film for years and to see the tops of the Beatles heads cut off throughout the movie is frustrating, disappointing and quite unforgivable. The distributors could have simply offered the viewer a choice by placing both of the versions (the shameless chopped version and the original full screen version) on the disc as is available with so many DVD's. Instead they've opted to change history and not for the better in my opinion. What were theye thinking. Did the Beatles approve this and feel it was a good idea to make a wonderful movie unwatchable?<br />I can't believe that I've read all of the other reviews on this site and no one has noticed this. I viewed my original video and compared it to the new improved DVD and there seems to be alot of the tops of the Beatles heads missing on the DVD. Appaulling!!... My only hope is that they release a full screen version of the DVD at a later date. Otherwise about 25% of history has just been rewritten. I guess George Orwell was right, history is remanufatured everyday and no one even notices. Ah, the days of Oceana.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Simply the best album to come out so far this year!! Who would have thought! On top of being a great actor Jared (30stm) is also a great musician. Each and everyone of the songs rocks. Very rarely do I like an entire album, this one is one of those exceptions. So go ahead and buy it now, I assure you, you wont be disappointed.
B00004U28G|5.0|I first saw this movie 17 years ago, when I broke my leg and someone was kind enough to tape some movies off HBO for me to enjoy.  Since then, I have seen this film countless times.  So, when I realized that the VHS copy just wasn't going to last much longer, I knew it was time to grab it on DVD. <br />There's lots of little things to watch for in this movie.  When J.J. asks the Missouri police officer if they take the law seriously in this town, and the officer points to the banner that says &quot;Re-elect Sean 'Kill-A-Commie' O'Scanlon&quot;, be sure to pause it and read the rest of the banner.  Priceless.<br />Another DVD feature I found entertaining was listening to the commentary soundtrack.  Usually, I find little interest in this feature.  But here, you get a great behind-the-scenes look at how much fun they had making this movie.<br />For this price, you won't be disappointed...
B000002GZ1|5.0|the real blues<br />republican stylee<br />like right wing idydidnck<br />not really, its lefties haha not sure<br />ANYMORE
B000002W9P|3.0|I really don't know how to describe this album, and Helloween's style overall. These songs are far too melodic and catchy to be called &quot;speed metal,&quot; but too heavy and fast to be called &quot;pop metal.&quot; Helloween are a very interesting band in that respect. The closest comparison I can draw to a more well-know metal album is Judas Priest's &quot;Turbo&quot; with a slightly more thrashy feel, but considering how many people hate &quot;Turbo,&quot; that's probably not fair.<br />The songs I like on this album - &quot;A Little Time,&quot; &quot;Future World,&quot; &quot;Twilight of the Gods,&quot; and &quot;I'm Alive&quot; - are very good songs, and I can certainly see how Helloween laid the foundation of European power metal with this album. If this were an EP consisting of just those 4 songs, I'd give it 5 stars. Unfortunately, the album opener and closer are non-songs that clock in at around one minute each, wasting 2 perfectly good tracks. The song &quot;Halloween&quot; would be a pretty good epic except for one thing: the reference to Charlie Brown comics completely ruins the entire song for me. If you can get past that, then this album is definitely worth a listen. But to put it in perspective, this is an album with 7 tracks, 5 of which are songs, 4 of which are good. Make of that what you will, and also check out Kai Hansen's other band, Gamma Ray.
B000000Y59|5.0|This is the swingest album from Bill Evans, and the texture Bill Play here are very clasical,,I rated this album more 10 stars actually.
0380778556|3.0|The first part was terrible, a love story without love. It was boring. The shadow of Rebecca was spoiling the love stroy.<br />I only give a star for the first part, but four of five stars for the second part. It's that way, which is boring, but why is it that way, that was interesting. Rebecca's death, the inquiry and Mr Favell's bad character were like a crime novel. The end was crazy. Manderly burns down, the great love of Maxim de Winter was always Manderly and now he has only Mrs de Winter (without a first name) and their relation of mistrust.
B00006AG5N|5.0|A fantastic Cd, with great sound. The first Album in many years for Elv1s that will top the charts all around the world. Keep up the good work BMG.
0553381709|5.0|who saw me reading a fantasy book in a restaurant.  That's how excited people are about George R.R. Martin, and now I know what they're all talking about.  I haven't felt this enthusiastic about an author since I discovered Tim Powers.  As good as the first two books were, Martin really hits his stride with Storm of Swords; the depth of plotting, the small details of life in that era, and the richness of the characters, all combine to draw you in, and you'll be amazed at how quickly 800 pages fly past.  My favorite character twist so far has to be Jaime Lannister, who turns out to be much more nuanced than the first two books would indicate; I can't wait to see what Martin has in store for him.  I cannot recommend this series strongly enough.
079074404X|5.0|Without giving away any details of the plot - for its best to watch for yourself - just know that this is a superb entry into the realm of Sci-fi flicks! FORBIDDEN PLANET offers the viewer an exceptionally intelligent script, fine direction and excellent acting by the entire cast who are threatened by a strange being on an exotic planet. In the year 22OO A.D., commander Leslie Nielson lands his United Planets Cruiser C-57D on Altair-4 where the sky is green the sand is pink, and two moons circle above...For its day, the technical achievements for the film were astounding. It was the first science fiction film produced by a major studio (M-G-M) for a million dollars. The eerie musical score, the atmosphere, even the odd Eastmancolor all add to the film's immense enjoyment. The film is essentially (and rather ingeniously) a futuristic variation/fantasia on Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST: an undeniably brilliant excursion into outer space and the inner mind.
0380778556|3.0|At the beginning of the book, after I had read a few pages, I was not very convinced about the novel! I found it very boring and also not very well written. Also the cover and the title were not very exciting either. When I continued to read I must say the story took another direction than I had expected and I was interested in how it would go on. A detail which I very much like in the story is that the narrator never tells her own name.<br />Now as I have finished reading the novel I can say that I have also read better novels, but also some which were not so good. It's a very special book and a really curious story. But I think the readers have a good chance to feel as if they were in the roles of the characters. Sometimes I didn't agree with them but I could also follow their actions. I was surprised about the end, because I had never thought that it would end like that.<br />I would recommend the novel to other people, but on the whole it's not a book for anyone who just wants to read a novel for pleasure because he has to think about what he's reading to see the strange motivation of the characters to sympathise with them and to understand the signs which the writer gives you! Then it's a good choice and it's worth taking the time to read! It's a really curious, exciting, poetic and sometimes a little bit cruel story!
B00005B36H|5.0|Best album of the year hands down!!!<br />Smart production and exceptional workmanship
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis created a music style that's equally country and rhythm and blues, and this cd clearly demonstrates his talent and his original style. No Elvis CD has probably ever sounded better - the music is remixed and it was done properly - crystal clear!<br />Forget the negative reviews of jealous critics who don't know music - those who pretend to know music but who probably listen to Garth Brooks and Britney Spears. Elvis wasn't called the King for nothing, and his post life career speaks for itself<br />In short - this is good stuff here - American music at it's best. This cd is sure to please old fans and new fans alike.
B00003CXAE|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS MOVIE. IT REALLY GETS YOUR BLOOD PUMPING. I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOVIE TO COME OUT ON DVD FOR YEARS...
055350259X|5.0|As a homesick Aussie living Canada, this was a temporary band-aid.  This was a really funny book, I laughed out loud constantly.  I learned a lot from it also, it made me want to seek out more information on the topics he touched on.  I learned great conversation pieces, and I always wanted to read bits out to people around me.  It has only made me love my country even more and I think it is an excellent introduction for any prospective visitor.
B0000542D2|4.0|I have looked forward to the remastered d.v.d. and as far as the actual film restoration goes for disc 1, it is brilliant.<BR>The audio has also improved. What i am most disappointed with is disc 2, in as far as bonus footage is concerned. Where are the original 1964 trailers for the film? One has the beatles sitting in baby carriages telling us to see hard days night in our local theatre, plus there was another one made specifcally for the united states for the film release. Also, there were on set interviews made with beatles during a break in filming and an original 1964 documentary that was not included on the d.v.d.<BR>Also, it would have been nice to compile all the behind scenes footage into one section instead of running spordically throughout all the new interviews with the cast and crew. I understand the beatles do not own this film, that is why there were no new beatle interviews with paul and ringo. Other than those moot points, it's a d.v.d. worth getting.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Regardless of whether you want to give Elvis the title \\"King of Rock\\" or not you HAVE to RESPECT the fact that he is was amazing performer and singer. Not everyone will have 30 hits like this. Sure Elvis didnt write most of his music but he still was a great musician. I first loved Elvis's music back when i was 10 years old. I heard the song \\"All Shook Up\\" and instantly became a fan. Elvis did alot for music. He basically changed the world with it. He inspired legends like Bob Dylan, John Lennon, Paul Mcartney, Pete Townshend, etc. All these songs are amazing. \\"Suspicious Minds\\" has to be the perfect ballad ever sung. Elvis has a great voice. Probably the most unique in Rock's history. Sure Elvis didnt invent Rock N Roll, but he sure gave it a kick in the [rump] in the 50's. He along with Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Jackie Wilson made history.
0060922583|4.0|I read Talbot's book for a different reason than most reviewers here. I heard that it was a good layman's elaboration of quantum physicist David Bohm's theory of the Implicate Order.  This turned out to correct.<br />Bohm's theory is without doubt the most plausible of all the so-called &quot;hidden variable&quot; interpretations of quantum mechanics (with the possible exception of John Cramer's Transactional Interpretation).  But I find it is often misrepresented in layman's introductory quantum physics books because almost every author ends up stating that hidden variable theories, including Bohm's, require faster-than-light signalling between quanta.  Bohm's Implicate Order expressly does NOT rely on ANY signalling between quanta.  The mistake authors make is to associate Bohm's Implicate Order with a reinterpretation of quantum-level reality when in fact, the Implicate Order is a SUB-quantum level of reality (where Einsteinian spacetime does not exist; therefore no separation of quanta exists--right in line with Bell's Theorem I might point out).  Talbot manages to nail this on the head with his illustration of the fish in the aquarium (and doesn't even have to resort to words like &quot;subquantum&quot;).<br />I applaud that Talbot gets Bohm right.  And of course integrating it with Pribram's neurophysical theories drives the argument home very well.  I must also applaud that the paranormal evidence cited in support of the theory is confined to research by actual scientists rather than mere tabloid fare.
B00006J3WH|4.0|Perhaps its because my MP3 of the songs in the musical have the background sounds and conversations in it that I find the pure musicality of this CD to be a little empty.<br />For example, in Sweet's song, Sweet says, after Dawn announces her sister is the Slayer, for his minions  to &quot;find her. Tell her...tell her everything. Just get her here.&quot; In my MP3 version I have that conversation but the soundtrack leaves it out.<br />Also, because conversations and background noise drowned out some of the music in the episode I find myself constantly being surprised with an extra few notes in the beginning or end of a song.<br />It was nice to hear the entire Parking Ticket song and I am very happy they didn't combine Dawn's ballet with What you Feel like it was in the show.<br />Its a great soundtrack and I really only have one gripe with it. If Joss included a suite from Resltess why couldn't he have included the song Giles sang in the nightmare with the First Slayer. &quot;I've got to warn Buffy, there's every chance she could be next...&quot; I personally love that song and wish it had been included.
B00005IC2H|5.0|That is one definition that comes to mind whenever I am listening to this remarkable cd. I have been a fan of a movement in music called shoegazer that was popular in the early 80's/90's that introduced some amazing bands with heavenly, ethereal music (think Cocteau Twins, Pale Saints, Lush, etc). While Sigur Ros' music could be described as fitting into that category, they are in turns doing something completely original in the same instance. This band breathes life into ambient, heavenly music...it is comforting, uplifting, dense, atmospheric, and mysterious, all in the same instance. I will agree with much of the praise here in the other reviews; it is music that will move and inspire you like few others can. I am so happy to have discovered this fabulous band, and more anxious still with the arrival of their new album (October 2002). I can't recommend this cd enough; it stays with you long after each listen, and you will want to play it again and again. This is proof that there are still those few rare artists out there who know how to mix true beauty with originality. I, for one, hope they will be around for a looong time!! :-)
B00005OAIE|5.0|I have been a John Mayer fan for quite some time, and now that he has released &quot;Room for Squares&quot;, I have enjoyed seeing his increasing popularity flourish.  With this album, John Mayer releases an incredible blend of talent and emotion into his acoustic playlist.  Along with the familiar radio hit song &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, Mayer releases even more elaborate tunes such as &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Why Georgia&quot;, &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; and &quot;Back to You&quot;.  Mayer's lyrics allow listeners to relate his songs to their own personal experiences and to really think about the meaning behind his songs.  His raw talent is obvious when you listen to this upbeat album.  &quot;Room For Squares&quot; will hold a permanent spot in your music collection.  John Mayer is both a gifted songwriter and singer, and you will be highly impressed by his talent.
0590259385|5.0|\\"Is your Mama a llama? I asked my friend Rhonda.\\" \\"I think not, is how Rhonda responded.\\" Little llama wants to know if his friend's mothers are llamas too. Superb, rich illustrations of the baby animals and mamas, including such exotics as bats and swans make this a Storytime favorite. My group has this one memorized and love to read along with the illustrations. Remember they are only three! New members to the group feel comfortable giving the correct responses with the rest of the tried and true. Treat your group to the bigger than life version. Fun to turn the huge pages and the illustrations translate well.
B00006AG5N|4.0|Dispite the few alternative takes on the cd, I highly recommend this compilation to anyone, no matter what music field they enjoy. RCA is showing a fresh new Elvis here for the future generations and they seem to be doing a superb job with the album's content. In my opinion, this collection ranks high among the other greats such as the five &quot;Elvis' Golden Records&quot; releases, &quot;Worldwide 50 Gold Award Hits&quot; and &quot;The Top Ten Hits&quot;.
B00005JL78|5.0|I thought this was an excellent movie with a pretty tricky plot.  When I went in to see this movie I thought the story would end when Tom Cruise finally meets his fate, however finding this to be only part of the plot was a great surprise.  I thought the ideas to be interesting and challenge the mind about the future.  I was also impressed by the special effects and do not see what people refer to when they say it was \\"too blue\\".  If you want a movie that will give you seasonal depression refer to the newest \\"Planet of the Apes\\" movie.  Also if you thought the sort of future imagined in this movie was corny please refer to \\"Demolition Man\\".  Overall an excellent film whose plot twists kept me stumped.  I'll buying this movie on DVD as soon as it's released.
0380778556|2.0|The story of Rebecca is interesting and different from usual ones. The novel shows the problems of the main actor, Mrs de Winter, very graphic. But for me there's not enough tension. One of the reasons for the missing tension is that you don't wonder why something happens because either you know why or you don't notice that something strange is going to happen.<br />After about three quarters of the book, the reader knows what exactly happened with Rebecca, but the book doesn't end at this place, it still goes on. That makes the end rather boring in spite of the unclear ending.
B00006AG5N|5.0|TV GUIDE named Elvis Presley the Entertainer of the Century. In the 1950s, journalists and critics hailed Elvis as the King of Rock 'n' Roll. This album of 31 US and UK no.1s proves why these titles are well-deserved. Elvis was a singles artist, an album artist, and made 33 movies in a film career that spanned 1956-1972.Elvis made many movie classics such as JAILHOUSE ROCK, KING CREOLE, BLUE HAWAII, LOVING YOU, and LOVE ME TENDER. Many of the no.1 singles on this release come off of movie soundtracks.<br />BMG/RCA note that the singles have been \\"mixed and mastered from the original master tapes\\". The sound quality is excellent. Elvis Presley never sounded better.<br />BMG/RCA used the methodology of the Beatles 1 album to obtain 31 no.1 singles on the US and UK charts. The 31st no.1 is a \\"bonus track\\", A LITTLE LESS CONVERSATION, which went no.1 in the UK this summer, breaking the tie Elvis had with the Beatles for most no.1s at 17. This JXL remixed bonus track went no.1 in over 24 countries around the world and is in the new Eddie Murphy movie I SPY.The unmixed song was in the OCEAN'S 11 movie. It is a testament to the enduring legacy of Elvis that he can still go no.1 around the world 25 years after his death. The single was also no.1 on the Billboard Sales Chart. It is a great bonus track.<br />The 30 no.1s during Elvis' career are the music that defined a generation and created a musical, social, and political revolution. Elvis changed not only music, but styles of clothing, the way we wore our hair, the way he looked at the world around us. Elvis changed the world. And this music shows why.<br />HEARTBREAK HOTEL is a classic record that began Elvis' streak on the pop charts. It is a song about loneliness and failed relationships, themes that are very contemporary today but not addressed in pop songs at that time.DON'T BE CRUEL was no.1 on the R&B, Pop, and C&W charts simultaneously. Elvis combined elements of black and white music which incorporated country, western, bluegrass, blues, tin pan alley, show tunes, to create what we now know as ROCK 'N' ROLL. In a period of McCarthyite witch-hunt conformity and racial segregation and the bland pop of Pat Boone, Elvis exploded on an unssuspecting America. We still feel the aftershocks today! Elvis created a revolution!<br />John Lennon said: \\"Before Elvis, there was nothing.\\" Bruce Springsteen stated that \\"Elvis is my religion. Without him I would be selling encyclopedias today.\\" Elvis had the greatest musical and social influence and impact of the 20th century. He changed the way we think, act,and the way we perceive each other. He represented freedom and plurality. He came from the people and he spoke for the people. He was of the masses and for the masses.<br />The selections on this set include LOVE ME TENDER, the 1956 classic ballad in pristine sound quality. You can hear every breath Elvis takes. The sound quality is that good! ALL SHOOK UP, TEDDY BEAR, JAILHOUSE ROCK, HARD HEADED WOMAN, HOUND DOG, CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE, A BIG HUNK O' LOVE, sound spectacular in this remastered sound! Elvis' vocals are clear and up front and the guitars can be heard much more distinctly. SUSPICIOUS MINDS sounds different because Elvis' vocals are more up front. BURNING LOVE, a great comeback no.1 from 1972, proves Elvis was the King of Rock 'n' Roll. Only Elvis could dominate any era by the power of his music. That is why he was termed the King of Rock 'n' Roll. No one else could match Elvis' career accomplishments or musical influence or impact. No one else even compares to Elvis. He is in a class all by himself.Little Richard and chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis and James Brown couldn't even buy a no.1 record. They don't know what a no.1 record even is. They have been hyped and overrated by mindless so-called music critics based on racism and on greed. But the people have spoken. In a democracy, it is the people who decide. We the people, Jack. The people decide, not some fascist-racist music critics. The people decide. E pluribus unum, Jack.<br />The only criticism of this package is that the picture sleeves for the 45s were not included. Moreover, there are two alternate takes, of A FOOL SUCH AS I and THE WONDER OF YOU. This is inexplicable. But there are excellent photographs and a photo of Elvis' classic customized Gibson Jumbo 200 guitar. Peter Guralnick and Ernst Jorgenson wrote the liner notes.<br />The sound quality is excellent. This is the music that changed America and that changed the world! This is not just any music but the soundtrack of Rock 'n' Roll. This is Americana. This is American music.<br />I would highly recommend this collection. Hear why Elvis was dubbed the King of Rock 'n' Roll and the Entertainer of the Century. Elvis could do it all. And he did it all. Before anyone did anything, Elvis did everything. Buy this collection. Listen to the sound of the revolution! Elvis changed the world.acist music critics. The people decide.

This is American music. <br />I would highly recommend this collection. Hear why Elvis was dubbed the King of Rock 'n' Roll and the Entertainer of the Century. Elvis could do it all. And he did it all. Before anyone did anything, Elvis did everything. Buy this collection. Listen to the sound of the revolution! Elvis changed the world.
B00005JLDW|3.0|This film throws a lot of things at you, which might be part of the problem, but what they do give you is generally very interesting.   First of all, it's a dragon film, or at least it's supposed to be.  I'll explain.  The effects are superb, and when the dragons are on the screen, they are totally convincing.  Problem is, I would have preferred that they be on the screen a lot more, and when you take a carload of kids to see it, they get a bit antsy during long stretches when there are no dragons.  <br />So what they do when the dragons are not on the screen is give you a world that is a bit reminiscent of \\"The Road Warrior\\".  Humans have been driven into hiding by the dragons who have taken over the world.  Since civilized progress is stunted, you see people making do with the bits and pieces of junk they pick up before happier times.  So we get to see all kind of creative costumes and vehicles put together from other peoples junk.  Just like \\"The Road Warrior\\".  <br />This stuff was ok from an adult point of view.  Matthew McConaughey is unrecognizable as a totally musclebound warrior.  He has a score to settle with the dragons that is not quite made clear, and this distracts from even that adult point.<br />I would have put in more dragon-fighting scenes to keep the kids from squirming as much as they did.  Or, if they wanted to be artsy, try to work towards some peace agreement with the creatures.  In other words, less \\"Road Warrior\\" and more dragons.
B00006F7S4|5.0|After Dylan split with his wife, he wrote what is largely considered his masterpiece, Blood on the Tracks. Truly one of the most devastating pieces of music in the twentieth century. The more you listen, the more you learn. Some twenty five years down the line, another album  picks up where he left off. This one. It's been widely reported that the catalyst for this stunning collection of songs was a breakup. Beck's loss is our gain. Like Dylan at his peak, the songs are truthful, simple and piercing. Take the lyrics of Round the Bend, the best song on the album....&quot;We don't have to worry. Life goes where it does.&quot; That's not the beginning of a song. That's the beginning of a novel. Trying to describe the music that supports the song is like trying to describe the Grand Canyon to a blind person. Just buy the damn thing. You'll regret nothing. I'm fairly confident that twenty five years from now, Sea Change will be one of only a  handful of albums to have made it through. Somewhere, Dylan must be proud....
0380778556|3.0|I think the book is good. The story is about Maxim de Winter, a rich man, who goes to Monte Carlo and who marries a quiet young woman there. He takes her back to his lovely country home, Manderley. But in Manderley there is still the goest of his first wife Rebecca who destroys the happiness of the couple.<br />The author had a very good idea to start with the end of the story. Like that the book gets a special touch. But apart from that the beginning of the book is a little bit arduous and boring to read. But it becomes better and better up to the final scene which is very exciting which isn't a happy-end. The whole book is filled with emotions and unexpected expressions. The variation of feelings of the unknown narrator are descripped in a way which allows the reader to go into this person and to feel with her. The feelings change from love to hatred. The book also shows how soon that happiness can be destroyed and what it means to be compared with a perfect person the whole time  even though the course of the book shows that there doesn't exist a perfect person without a mistake in the world. I think it the book would be better if the beginning were shortened and if instead of that the end were embellished and longer.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck, is there anything really left to say? He is brilliant!!! Taking the same path as \\"mutations\\", Beck brings forth his soul once more, this time with deeper introspective lyrics and some self healing. In a time when we all need it, Beck rises (unlike Springsteen) to the occasion. And don't believe for a second Beck is becoming trendy, he has always toyed with this sound: this time i think he finally realized his vision. One listen will prove my point.
B000068OCS|3.0|As many already know, MGM's new DVD of \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" is incorrectly hard-matted to an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 which IS NOT, and I repeat, NOT the correct aspect ratio for the film.  Shot in full-frame 4:3, the film was obviously intended to be seen in 4:3 and WAS theatrically shown in 1.33:1 - I personally saw the film 3 times theatrically in Los Angeles upon it's original theatrical release (twice at the Plitt in Century City (a premiere cinema at the time) and once at the Royal Theatre on the westside.   All presentations were 1.33:1 and NOT 1.85:1.    It was distinctly obvious that the presentation  was 1.33:1 upon it's theatrical release with much head room and unusually open scope to top and bottom, not this atrocious fake matting that MGM has now decided to instigate on their new disc.    It destroys many scenes that are WAY too cropped - and this is NOT the intended format of the director as many may think.<br />Godfrey Reggio oversaw the limited edition \\"members-only\\" DVD that IRE put out a couple of years ago to anyone who contributed $180+ to their cause to clear up the legal issues for the film. That disc was the original full-frame (no fake matting) version of the film and was identical to the way the film was originally theatrically presented.    Reggio apparently oversaw the production of that disc and approved it - even personally signing the sleeve each one came in.   Would he approve his own personally produced DVD with the wrong aspect ratio of his own film?   I think not. <br />Who came up with this idea that the film was theatrically shown in 1.85:1?   It wasn't shown that way in Los Angeles, that's for sure.  I understand the whole \\"matting/not matting\\" issue as far as some films shot open but are intended to be seen matted, but this is not one of those cases.    \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" was shot and intended to be seen open and MGM's disc is an atrocity to Ron Fricke's cinematography, cropping out important information from top and bottom.<br />I am glad I didn't sell off my IRE disc of the film in anticipation of this new MGM release.   The IRE disc will now be even more valuable to film fans and collectors - and any TRUE \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" fan will most likely NEED to locate one of those IRE discs now if they want to have the film as it was INTENDED to be seen.<br />MGM should have put both versions of the film on the disc if they were so adamant about including a \\"widescreen\\" print just to appease fans who always think widescreen is \\"right\\".   Well, in this case, they have basically released a pan-and-scan version of the film, but a vertical pan-and-scan instead of the usual horizontal.   A true disappointment all around.    Boo.
0380778556|3.0|I found this book interesting. At the beginning, I thought it was very boring, becaus on the first few pages nothing interesting happens. After reading on, the real story begins, and then it is quite interesting. I think it is a very special story, because it is independent of time. This story could happen today, tomorrow or could have happened forty years ago.<br />Everyone who loves a mixture between crime and love story should read this novel.<br />The story is not very difficult to understand.
B00006AG5N|5.0|If you are familiar with Elvis' recordings, this CD has definitely got some issues.  As pointed out, several alternate takes of the hit versions are oddly substituted (most glaring on THE WONDER OF YOU), not to mention a lot of deserving music that couldn't fit onto one disc.  Despite its title, I really don't see this CD as having much more than novelty value for the existing Presley fan...maybe something convenient to play in the car.  Fortunately, those fans have many other options than this disc.  Those who are familar with this material but who only want one Elvis CD in their collection will probably find this set to be the best pick out of the many anthologies on the market, despite its handful of imperfections.<br />As an introduction for newcomers to the music of Elvis (e.g., potential younger fans not born yet during Elvis' lifetime), in my opinion this CD best gets the picture across via his biggest hits of how adept Presley could be at blending musical styles and influences over the course of his entire career.  It's a little ironic given Elvis' reputation that there's relatively little bona-fide rock'n'roll on this disc, but that genre was only one of several that Presley excelled in.  The disc smoothly works its way from HEARTBREAK HOTEL onward, catching 13 key tracks from the 1950s, another dozen from the first half of the 1960s, Presley's five biggest chart scores from his comeback years, and the recent JKL remix of CONVERSATION (which fits in surprisingly well even though it was produced a quarter-century after the &quot;30th hit&quot; WAY DOWN).  It's difficult to believe that first-time Elvis CD buyers won't want to dig deeper into his catalogue after hearing these prime cuts, particularly when Presley's legacy has so many more moments of excellence than can be stuffed onto one disc.
B00005OAIE|3.0|Mr. Mayer is a talented boy. This CD is full of tunes that should be played in the car with the top down traveling down an open road in the summer. One thing that this CD lacks is depth, I am sure we will see Mayer show he is capable of finding it, just not on this one. A few more recordings down the road I think we will find a very talented young artist. But for pure, head bobbing, stereo up to 10, sing-a-longs, Room for squares is a good choice.
B00005YXZH|5.0|this album is a &quot;pop&quot; masterpiece--and that's a good thing, my friends. i mean &quot;pop&quot; in the beatles--beach boys--big star/alex chilton--replacements sort of way.  catchy as hell, with dignity to spare. sure, some of the lyrics are a little spacy (track 1), but the bulk of the rest more than make up for it. &quot;i'm the man who loves you&quot; is EPIC &quot;pop.&quot; even if you don't know what to make of their &quot;alt country&quot; past (whatever THAT means), this is an incredible pop/rock album. i'll be sad when the day comes that i've played this album so much that i'm sick of it!
B00005JL78|5.0|The people who said that there isn't much action in this were absolutely right: there isn't. If your brain lies in your biceps, maybe you should try something else...professional wrestling, perhaps?<br />That said, this is a phenomenal movie which blends a mix of creative genius, stark reality, humanity at its worst, and a precognizance of its own that is easily and chillingly recognizable in today's world of post-9/11 attempts at pre-emptive crime fighting.<br />In the world of \\"Minority Report\\" crimes can be stopped before they happen. This is because a trio of (essentially) futuristic...babies can see murders before they happen, and Tom Cruise is the cop that catches the bad guys before they go bad. But as his character says, \\"everybody runs\\"--himself included, when his name comes up in connection with a future murder. From there it's a test of wits, strength and a clever twist on a classic murder-mystery formula for him to prove his own innocence before he's captured by the same elite crime force he once headed. Alright, sounds like a good story, if a bit cliche. So what makes this movie so good?<br />First is Steven Spielberg's brilliant direction. With \\"Minority Report,\\" he makes up for his disturbing but misguided \\"A.I.\\" of last year. How refreshing to have a film where the special effects are folded INTO the mix, not used as the base. He crafts a seamless story, plugs most (admittedly not all) of the holes in the writing, and makes you truly believe that this is a possible future. (He seems almost prescient himself: just as the movie was released, Attorney General John Ashcroft announced a \\"pre-crime\\" initiative at our current day Justice Department) Spielberg also tries to avoid that which might be a bit too fantastic, so don't expect any laser beams, humanoid robots, or little cyborg children looking for their mommies (thank god).<br />Second in this film is the substance. \\"Time and timing\\" are themes throughout the movie, as is illustrated in one of the opening scenes (as Cruise races to catch a future murderer at the exact moment when the act is about to be committed), and watch for this to recur throughout the movie. In one of the most brilliant scenes, in which Cruise and one of the \\"pre-cogs\\" are trying to escape capture in a shopping mall, the clairvoyant girl guides Cruise through a series of perfectly orchestrated evasions of their would-be captors.<br />Third is style. I mentioned the special effects. I was getting so sick of movies \\"STARRING!\\" some new technology or special effect that my jaw dropped simply from the surprise of a director unafraid to make them a simple backdrop. This isn't \\"The Matrix\\": don't go in looking for Tom Cruise to dodge bullets. Instead, expect some slick sequences involving a futuristic world...or is it really that far off? \\"Popular Science\\" magazine ran a feature on Tom Cruise's Lexus in this film and pointed out the many features that aren't far away. In \\"Minority Report\\"s world, strategically placed eye scanners offer tailored advertisements for every person walking around: anybody have their ...webpage customized?<br />There's also some comedic relief to keep this from being chilling to the bone (although if the thought of somebody touching your eye makes you queasy, I wouldn't recommend seeing this film), a surprising performance by the inconsistent Cruise, and some fantastic support from Max Von Sydow and especially Colin Farrell. Yes, this will make you think. No, there isn't any adrenaline-raising chase or action sequence, although there are scenes so tense that you'll find yourself holding your breath (remember what I said about timing? Watch for a scene with some robotic spiders and you'll see what I mean). But this is still a great movie, cream from this summer's lackluster crop, and destined (I believe) to become a classic. This should be on any serious movie fan's Christmas list.
B000067CPX|5.0|An awesome album blending the old style of the chili peppers funk with their newer, more musical sound.  Songs like &quot;Dosed&quot; and &quot;Tear&quot; are perhaps some of the best work by the peppers ever.  But &quot;By the Way&quot; and &quot;Can't Stop&quot; sound like work off their older albums.  I think this is one of the greatest albums ever put out by the peppers and i've been a fan since Blood Sugar
B00006F7S4|5.0|When I first put the new Beck CD in my player, I have to admit, it wasn't what I expected. It was like his more folky stuff, but incredibly depressing. Sea Change can be viewed as either a masterpiece or as a disaster. It holds the depressing tone the whole way through, and manages to mesmerize the whole way with violins and other orchestral instruments in the background. Don't put this CD in your player and expect a new Odelay, it's depressing and downbeat. If you're in a horrible mood this CD will without a doubt end up becoming one of your favorites whenever you're in the dumps. I recommend it.
B00006AG5N|5.0|True fans of music in every form, from Rhythm and Blues, to Rock should be delighted with this release.  Although it is yet another RCA rehash of previously released material,  the material in question is without question the greatest music of this century.  This music catapulted Elvis' from relative obscurity to worldwide fame and fortune, and changed the face of popular music and culture as we know it.  The songs have been remastered (again), and in giving credit where credit is due, they do sound as fresh as the day they were cut.  Anyone with an IQ higher than room temperature knows that ... reviews from the always laughable ... are festered with \\"racial chip on my shoulder\\" mentality and are truly without merit.  This is the music that singlehandedly changed the face of popular culture.  Elvis is the man, then, and now.  Every artist/music fan owes him a huge debt of gratitude.  BUY THIS CD NOW!... It is E-S-S-E-N-T-I-A-L!...
B000067CPX|5.0|Every time you think the Peppers have spent their creative energy, they outdo themselves. This album capitalizes on the harmonies and versatility they have shown increasingly with each album since Mother's Milk. It takes as much ingenuity as it does bravery to explore new frontiers by moving towards sounds that are ever MORE poppy and mainstream. A lot of the tunes (e.g., \\"Universally Speaking,\\" \\"This Is the Place,\\" \\"Zephyr\\" ) are every bit as light sounding as something the Lemonheads or later-stage R.E.M. would release, yet infused with a distinctly Peppers flavor.<br />There are a few failed experiments here, like \\"Throw Away Your Television\\" (and \\"Cabron\\" is pretty goofy, too), but they're more than excusable in view of the light years the band has traveled since, say, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan. Not to say that there aren't traces of that youthful energy in spots like the title track and \\"Can't Stop\\"- there is just more variety, that's all.<br />What Keidis lacks in meaningful lyrics (they get pretty goofy at times, just for the sake of rhyming), he makes up for in courage. This is a man who has pushed himself beyond his voice's natural range, and it ends up working to his advantage. This is made even more evident by the fact that the instrumentation here- though beautiful- is sparse. It is a restraint that creates a more melodic sound, and shows the band's maturity as well as its talent.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I would like to put this quickly and simply.  Sea Change has two sides.  In its instrumentation, the album is both beautiful and understated.  In its lyrics, the album is downbeat and sad.  This is not Beck of any of the previous albums, except perhaps the song &quot;Nobody's Fault but My Own,&quot; however that song has its own characteristics which make it unique to the Mutations album.  All of the songs on Sea Change are of a piece that is unique to this album, and honestly, I think I could say that about all of Beck's albums.  However, of all of them, this one strikes me as the best, as well as one of the most beautiful albums I have ever heard.
B00000J7JO|3.0|I wasnt hugely impressed with this CD. That doesnt mean its a bad CD. But its different. Its not quite Blood Sugar and its not quite By The Way. Its basically a bridge for their transition from rap rock to melodic rock. Some people would like the mix, but not me.<br />This album actually has some good songs. Californication is okay, Around the World is okay, Scar Tissue is great... Its just that theres too many okay songs and not enough great ones. Therefore, although its not a bad effort, it doesnt keep me listening to the CD. At times I think it gets very boring. Its not hard at all. I often turn it on when I'm going to sleep. However, the CD would appeal to some people. Die-hard Chili Peppers fans should get it, and so should people who like not all that hard rock. Just be prepared for a different sound.<br />Closing Comments:Are their lyrics meant to make any sense at all?

B000005YZM|5.0|I forced myself to read all 40 reviews and was left shaking my head. Why compare Sgt. Pepper, Pet Sounds and Odessey and Oracle? Each are monster albums with their own flavor, character and mood. They all have fantastic, memorable songs. If they overlap a bit in technique, why should that disappoint anyone? The musicians were contemporaries. In particular, the Beatles and the Zombies (and Pink Floyd) all recorded at the same studios.  All share a psychedelic &quot;sensibility&quot;, they were products of their time. Music doesn't exist in a vacuum!<br />Odessey and Oracle is pure ear candy, an exquisite listen. Colin Blunstone's expressive vocals are captivating, and the musicianship of the band is outstanding. The songs are wonderful! One of the best things about it is the obvious, well, Britishness of it. Many of these songs could be played on college radio today and sound completely new.<br />In my opinion, the Zombies were an underated band at the time because of their elegant and sophisticated sound, qualities that are difficult to market.  To my 30 year old ears, Rod Argent's jazzy keyboards and aggressive arrangements seem quite progressive compared to most groups in the British Invasion category and otherwise. <br />If all this doesn't convince you, I recently had the pleasure to attend an actual Blunstone and Argent show. They are currently doing a short U.S. tour to promote an album of new material.  Although my expections were about medium, mostly wondering if Colin could still sing well after all these years, both he and Argent blew me away.  They both sound as good as they did in their 60's heyday, if not a little better with age. Blunstone may well be the most distinctive singer in the &quot;rock&quot; genre today and Argent is a keyboards genius. Because it hasn't been overplayed, the Zombies music sounds fresh and contemporary. They may finally be getting their due.<br />If you truly love music you will love Odessey and Oracle! And don't miss a chance to see Blunstone and Argent if they come to a town near you. They will thrill.
B00006AFUR|5.0|That's right folks, 30 SECONDS TO MARS is a great mix of industrial, modern,& numetal hard-rock, and it kix booty! If you like this kind of music you will love this band. They kinda have a old rock sound of the 80's mixed in there, like GENISIS, or PHIL COLLINS? Maybe its just me? But the music is great, and the vocals also! This should definitely make a movie-soundtrack as well!
B00003CXI1|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of the Harry Potter books. I was a little worried about seeing the movie. Like some movies, I was worried that it would not portray the book as best as it could. I figured I would be bored knowing what was going to happen, and that I would tell the others what was coming next. But... I was wrong. This movie made me love the book and Harry Potter himself even more!!
B00006F7S4|5.0|Ok, so you're pondering whether to buy Beck's new album.  Well it's something else.  To any avid Beck fans: this is totally different.  This is weird because it's totally unlike anything on most of his major albums, especially Odelay and Midnite Vultures.  Mutations was acoustic and soft but this is just sad and depressing.  As the proffesional review above says, obviously Beck was purging himself.  After his breakup w/ his 9-year stylist girlfriend and his other flings he's getting a lot off of his chest.<BR>It's very assaulting in a weird moody sort of way.  Songs that should be quiet and slow come off as emotionless and forgettable.  I couldn't remember a note of this album after I'd listened to it the first time.  So, because I love his music so much, I've been listening to it more.  It's gonna grow on you, but it's definately best after a hard breakup or if you just feel like u wanna listen to something kinda the opposite of Midnite Vultures... which also means not a lot of energy.  No cool drum licks, no cool instrument fills, no genre hopping.  His voice sounds like the weird slurry sad Beck voice of his early folk stuff on FM&amp;OS and the like, 'cept there's NOTHING silly on this album.  There's nothing else I can say that I haven't repeated at least 3 times already except that Paper Tiger is the coolest song on the album.  Definately the closest to the albums that came before this.  Might be worth checkign out<BR>but don't buy this if you have a history of depression... it won't help.

I know this is a minute detail but, it kind of throws the reader - in this case my wife - \\"off.\\"  Just for the record the Vespa GS was not produced for sale until 1955.

B00006AG5N|5.0|RCA has compiled an outstanding assortment of #1 hits from both the US and the UK.  If there was ever any doubt of Elvis' universal appeal, this CD puts those to rest.  Any questions of Elvis' legitimacy as the King of Rock-n-Roll are easily silenced.  After one listen, any lover of music will realize how much Elvis' cultural influence and artistic brilliance have been understated over the years.  The CD combines the best of his rhythm and blues, ballads, and all out rockers into one of the most entertaining and exciting collections ever released by any artist.  This CD is sure to introduce Elvis to a whole new generation of fans and keep his spirit alive long into the new century and beyond.  The best songs on the CD are &quot;Hound Dog,&quot; &quot;Hard Headed Woman,&quot; &quot;Suspicious Minds,&quot; and &quot;Burning Love&quot;.  Also included is the 2002 worldwide hit &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; (JXL remix).  Play this CD loud!  Elvis deserves it.
B000068CNX|5.0|Friends is awesome. At the 54th Annual Emmy Awards this last year, the show took home two awards: one for Outstanding Original Comedy Series (2002) and one for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy (presented to Jennifer Aniston for her title role this past season). Both awards were greatly deserved. Friends also received a multitude of nominations including two for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy (Matthew Perry and Matt Le Blanc) and Outstanding Guest Star in a Comedy (for Brad Pitt's hilarious appearance in one of the episodes). It was a fantastic night for Friends. This Second Season of Friends is a terrific buy in that it is one of the best. Viewers get to see the wonderful relationship that develops between Ross and Rachel and the conflicts that ensue between two best friends/roommates, Joey and Chandler, when one decides to move out. Twenty four episodes come with this DVD package including some special features (not many). Still, it's worth the money.
0380778556|2.0|I don't like the book Rebecca. At the beginning of the story it was just a list of everyday things. For example a walk or a meeting or something else. I found it boring.<br />When the diver finds Rebecca's  body there is a little moment of tention. But before you can study if it was suicide or if it was an accident or if it was murder, &lt;the murderer is revealed>. ... Then all tention is gone. The only thing I have found interesting is the question why the murderer killed Rebecca... But the rest of the story was boring for me.<br />Still the book was a good novel because it was easy to read. But if somebody wants to read an thriller, I wouldn't recommend Rebecca.
B0000524CY|5.0|Simply the scariest film ever made. Watch this one alone with all the lights off. Anyone who says this films isn't scary is lying through there teeth. Yes this is based on a true story, and the story has been confirmed to be true! Things like his happen! I was privelged enough (extreme sarcasim) to witness one of these exorcisms. They are scary. The scariest film ever made!!!

B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis Presley not the King?  Despite some of the misguided and nonsensical ramblings of the first \\"review\\" of this CD ..., Elvis fans, and non-fans as well, can (and will) be pleased with this brand new REMASTERED CD.  ...It is the MUSIC that matters, and this CD goes a long way in showing everyone why.  While Little Richard, Chuck Berry and dozens of others were instrumental in the explosion of Rock and Roll, it was Elvis Presley that was the spark that ignited it...No one should doubt that Elvis' recording of \\"Hound Dog\\" b/w \\"Don't Be Cruel\\" is not only the best selling single of the \\"Rock Era\\", it is also the epitome of everything that The Beatles, Stones, Beach Boys and countless others have aspired to ever since.  The bottom line is this:  The CD has been remastered from the master tapes from RCA.  Never before has the music of Elvis Presley sounded more rich and alive.  Never before has the magic he had been more evident.  In 1956, Elvis Presley was responsible for selling close to half of all records sold in America.  Not even the Beatles can claim that kind of success.  Listening to Elvis' growth from \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" to \\"Way Down\\" is staggering.  Presley wasn't just satisfied with \\"Rock\\" - who else in \\"Popular Music\\" could sing a gospel song and have it go to #1?  The answer is clear.  Before anyone did anything - Elvis did everything.  Hype?  I don't think so . . . and I don't think you'd get an argument from any of the other founding fathers of Rock.  There is only one King - this disc shows why.  It's all about the music.  Just listen - and you'll know too.
0399226907|5.0|The school that jump started my education loved theatre.  As a matter of fact, all grades throughout the year would create a series of short plays so as to have a different grade performing every monday.<br />When I was around 4yrs old, my first time in school, I also experienced my first on-stage experience.  My role was to be the one of a pear...who had been eaten by a worm.  A very hungry worm at that.<br />I am now a theatre director, and I must say it was thanks to this little book with a great apetite that I have gone as far as I am!<br />decades after reading this book, it still brings joy to me; I would recomend it to any child.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I have watched the program \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" since the first day it premiered.  When I heard about a musical episode, being a fan of musicials, i was anxious to see how God, excuse me, Joss Whedon would bring my favorite characters into a musical setting. Lets just say it was nothing short of fantastic. The night after it aired, i rewatched it a few times to memorize the songs.  My friend burned me a rough copy just to keep my fix in order, but when i heard that they were doing a professional release, my responce was gleeful.  For any fan of the episode, or the show in general, this album is absolutly great.  It gives you all the words also so you can sing along! for a fan of musicals, i urge you to hear what Joss has done with his cast.  It is not only a triumph in the Buffyverse, it is a complete triumph in the musical industry as a whole.  It should get a tony award, plus the much deserved emmy for Joss!  Long live Buffy!  \\"That's what it's all about! Da Da.\\"
B00006AG5N|5.0|Here are my thoughts, based on listening to the CD (which should be the criteria for reviewing a CD, I would think):<br />This CD deserves to be in your collection right next to the Beatles 1 CD.  While some may complain about the track list, this is a wonderful 1-CD survey of Elvis from 1956 to 1977 (most of the tracks are from the 1956-1963).<br />I owned very few Beatles CD's before 1 was released, so I found it a great compilation, and I still regularly listen to it.  Same goes for Elvis, so this is a great summary of a career that many seem to make fun of for some reason.  Block the image of Elvis impersonators out of your mind and focus on the nearly 80 minutes of music on this CD.<br />The sound quality is great.  There was only so much you could do with the 50's mono recordings, but they sound as clear as they will ever sound.  The multi-track recordings sound wonderful.  I hadn't heard some of these songs before, so I can't say if the versions here have louder horns, a softer bass line, etc., but they are all sonically superb.  It almost sounds like some of the later songs were recorded yesterday!<br />The CD booklet is well done, with Elvis photos, and a short paragraph describing each song, along with production information and US/UK chart information (and also an explanation for how the songs were chosen).<br />I think the list of songs themselves serves as the best review and incentive to purchase Elvis 30 #1 Hits:<br />01 Heartbreak Hotel<BR>02 Don't Be Cruel<BR>03 Hound Dog<BR>04 Love Me Tender<BR>05 Too Much<BR>06 All Shook Up<BR>07 Teddy Bear<BR>08 Jailhouse Rock<BR>09 Don't<BR>10 Hard-Headed Woman<BR>11 One Night<BR>12 A Fool Such As I<BR>13 A Big Hunk O' Love<BR>14 Stuck On You<BR>15 It's Now Or Never<BR>16 Are You Lonesome Tonight?<BR>17 Wooden Heart<BR>18 Surrender<BR>19 (Marie's The Name) His Latest Flame<BR>20 Can't Help Falling In Love<BR>21 Good Luck Charm<BR>22 She's Not You<BR>23 Return To Sender<BR>24 (You're The) Devil In Disguise<BR>25Crying In The Chapel<BR>26 In The Ghetto<BR>27 Suspicious Minds<BR>28 The Wonder Of You<BR>29 Burning Love<BR>30 Way Down<BR>31 A Little Less Conversation (JXL Radio Remix) (Bonus Track) (a superb last-minute #1 addition)
B000065U1N|5.0|... this has to be the most historically accurate war film ever. ...  BHD is an accurate, gritty, realistic, and intense vision of ground-level modern combat.  It is THE best portrayal of special forces on film, and is definitely the most amazing war stories ever told.  ...just say \\"This movie stinks\\" and run away.<BR>That's all.
B00005JKED|1.0|this movie starts off pretty good, but then gets completely ridiculous. it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Unlike our friend from Boston who seems to have too much time on his hands writing reviews, I think this CD is excellent. Whilst many of the tracks have already been released on various greatest hits slections of the past, the sound quality is exceptional.There are also a couple of surprises for the hardened collector in the form of alternate takes.
B00006AG5N|3.0|Well, as a huge Elvis fan for many years I ran right out to buy this CD.  I heard all the hype about this fantastic remastering that was done on all of these songs, and could not wait to hear it.  Well I must say, I could not have been more disappointed with this release.  I could not audibly detect any difference at all in any of the songs (it was said that you would hear things you were never able to hear before).  I even swapped CD's from different releases and listened to the same song.. they sound EXACTLY the same.. I am not sure what I'm missing.  The only thing good about this release I felt was &quot;The Wonder of You.&quot;  I have never heard this version before, and I enjoyed it.  So I give it 3 stars, and thats only because it contains 30 songs on 1 CD ~ Most Elvis fans obviously have all this material, but it's a good alternative for a younger generation to be exposed to a short range of Presley's material throughout his career.  But to the avid Elvis fan, I believe this CD will disappoint you.  Also, whatever happened to the re-mix of &quot;Burning Love&quot; that was supposed to be included with this release ?
B00006FXB6|4.0|This CD (in my opinion) is much to over-rated. Don't get me wrong it's a great CD but there's really nothing on the CD that really gets my stereo cranking but No One Knows.<BR>Highlights of the CD:<BR>You Think I Ain't Worth A Dollar, But I Feel Like A Millionaire<BR>No One Knows<BR>A Song For The Dead<BR>God Is In The Radio<BR>All the rest is OK.  I gave the album a four because it's different and it's a break from today's music.
B00006AG5N|5.0|I've been an Elvis fan for about 6 years (I'm only 19) and I own about 60 or so of his CDs, so I've heard \\"Hound Dog\\", \\"It's Now Or Never\\", \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" and all the other ones on here numerous times and the quality of these recordings is far and away superior to the others. ... If you've never heard Elvis' songs before or heard them only a few times, get this CD. You will be amazed how \\"new\\" and crisp the sound is. If you're a die-hard fan like I am and have heard his songs hundreds or thousands of times, you will be equally as amazed for the same reason.
B000063S6Z|5.0|Yes, I know I am writing a Moby review RIGHT next to an Eminem review, but I wanted to let this out because I only have today to write it. This is a beautiful, downtempo album full of great performances, lyrics, vocals, and MANY MANY more. Some of the best tracks/performances of &quot;18,&quot; are the sad-yet-effective &quot;At Least We Tried,&quot; the uptempo-first-single &quot;We Are All Made of Stars,&quot; which is also to be found on the Now That's What I Call Music! 10 compilation and &quot;The Great Escape,&quot; whuich is pretty underspoken on some of the other reviews I have seen. This should have been named &quot;15,&quot; or &quot;14,&quot; because those are the number of good tracks here, but I'm not saying at all that this album is bad - no it is not bad. 1. WE ARE ALL MADE OF STARS [first single]--This was edited on NOW 10, before I did not add. So I heard the new parts that I hadn't heard on the other version of this song. This is a very good choice for a first single and is an uptempo blues number which greatly opens this disc. 4.5/5 2. IN THIS WORLD--This isn't one of my favorite tracks, probably because the vocals irritate me. But the instrumental performance behind this song is very good. 3/5 3. IN MY HEART--Somewhat reminds me of &quot;Find My Baby,&quot;--not really like this song is uptempo. This I think is better than &quot;Find My Baby,&quot; and the piano and other performances of this song are very good and the vocals aren't bad either. 4.25/5 4. GREAT ESCAPE--This is only a short while more than two minutes, but it is still effective as the other standouts on the disc. 4.5/5 5. SIGNS OF LOVE--I like this one too and the violin? is very good. The vocals are computer-enhanced I think though, but it's still good. 4/5 6. ONE OF THESE MORNINGS--This is basically a double of my opinion for the second track. The instrumentals are very good, but the vocals don't help it with anything. 3/5 7. ANOTHER WOMAN--Yet another song where the vocals don'tmatch up. Well, this is a kind of filler track. The vocals don't do anything and it's not a really catchy sort of song. 2.5/5 8. FIREWORKS--A track with a great instrumental and no vocals (thank you!!) It is a good track. 4/5 9. EXTREME WAYS--The beginning irritates me but this is a very good song and it's catchy after you get after the first fifteen seconds. 4.25/5 10. JAM FOR THE LADIES--Angie Stone's smooth voice shines on this track but the Moby rap is laughable. MC Lyte is very good on this track though. 4/5 11. SUNDAY--Very good sad track which has another great instrumental. I will edit this later but for now...bye.
B00006J3WH|5.0|In the liner notes for this album, Joss Whedon states that, having little experience with music-writing (or even playing the piano) he sat down the summer between Seasons 5 and 6 of \\"Buffy\\" and hammered out all the music and lyrics for this episode - a brilliantly creative and witty 51-minute self-contained \\"Buffy\\" musical.<br />While he may not be the next Andrew Lloyd Weber, his work shows undeniable talent and a very surprising ability to switch between musical fields like romantic ballads and rock opera.  Possibly even more surprising, though, was the quality of the singing he got out of his cast.  While Alyson Hannigan (Willow) and Nicholas Brendon (Xander) or even Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) may not have musical careers ahead of them, virtually the entire supporting cast shows an ability to sing remarkably well - especially Emma Caufield (Anya) and Amber Benson (Tara).  He not only shows courage in having everyone do their own singing, but he knows exactly whose strengths to play to.<br />If you're any sort of fan of the show, I hardly need to tell you to get this album, but even if you're simply curious about \\"Buffy\\" or like a good musical, I'd recommend giving this album a shot.  In spite of its recent Emmy snub, it has both excellent storytelling and really catchy music.  The first is not surprising given that it came from Joss Whedon, but given that this marks his first foray into music, the second certainly is.
0380778556|4.0|'Rebecca' is an intresting book, I read it very fast because I liked to know what Rebecca was like and why Maxim is so weird.<br />The story about the storyteller's jealousy of a dead person and the murder is very thrilling, but, and that's the reason why I woulden't give five stars, I don't like the behaivour of the storyteller very much, I think she doesn't fight for her love, she never speaked with her husband, she gives up and thinks her marriage have failed, although her 'enemy' is dead.
B000066I6N|2.0|After months of reading reviews of RP's live performances, I was looking forward to the new release...and was hugely dissapointed. I've listened to it again and again..trying to find some hook..some jewel..but it's just a bunch of moaning..whining...its boring. Who in his right mind could condone this treatment of Hey Joe?..YIKES! I had to play Zep I and Fate of Nations for 2 days just to get Dreamland out my head.<br />Robert..please go back in the studio...NOW..with a venomous guitar player and do what you do best...wail...not whine!...and we'll forget this ever happened.
0380789035|4.0|Gaiman's American God's deviates from the light-hearted story-telling, with slightly darker underlying themes found in 'Stardust' and 'Neverwhere'. The book's structure is more like comic book frames than a flowing, page-turning story. I was thrown at first by this shift in style, but gradually sunk into the book all the same. It is a mythic story told on a high-scale and plopped down into the world we live in. The characters are unique and memorable, the voice, clear and certain. Again, I didn't read it as quickly as I had his other books, but this one requires more attention. And when I reached the conclusion, I found the long, hard journey quite satisfying and worth the trip.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Listen, to the jackass, or any jackass, who criticized this record on the point that it isn't funky: it's not supposed to be.  Beck is an immensely talented musician who is constantly pushing the forefront of popular music by combining influences from across the globe.  Beck just broke up with his long time girlfriend and he doesn't have it in him to make a record like Odelay or Midnite Vultures.  So what?  This is a lyrical masterpiece that is just one continuous expression of the heartache and lonliness of love gone bad.  It's a great record.  His best?  I'm not so sure, but it's certainly starting to grow on me.  If you are fan of music, or a fan of Beck with an open mind you will absolutely love this record.  Ignore any review that doesn't give this album 5 stars, they don't know what they're talking about.
B000001GQD|5.0|I leave to others the arguments over why these are or are not recordings worthy of praise or a sniff of distain.<br />Personally, I was amazed at the artistry of both pieces. Seemed to me that many neat little musical bits and details appeared in these two performances that I've not heard elsewhere.  <br />But I was more amazed at the quality of the recordings...1950's and '60's analog masters that put me more into the middle of the performance than many DDD recordings I've heard. If that was the result of &quot;original-image bit-processing&quot;, then I'm going to look for that little moniker on other recordings I'm considering.<br />I think this CD is wonderful.
B000002JR8|5.0|This was my introduction to Pantera, being from Texas, I was ecstatic to find out that one of the most brutal heavy metal bands grew up only four hours away from me (in fact, my senior english teacher taught Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul in high school when she taught in Arlington), I have heard their earlier stuff, I've even heard their first studio album!  The first incarnation of Pantera was very much like most 80's hair bands, all screaming and whining, no meaning or feeling.  Phil Anselmo didn't join the band until their independent release \\"Power Metal\\", and his voice did not really mature to the deep growl we all know and love until this album came out.  <br />\\"Far Beyond Driven\\" is a trip into the troubled mind of a great metal singer, many of the songs on this album are very vulgar (in other words, not meant for radio), and emit undertones of adolescent frustration, sexual inadequacy, disapproval by elders and other meaningful portrayals of a man coming to terms with his issues.  I think their cover of \\"Planet Caravan\\" is the best remake of a Black Sabbath song that I've heard, they really capture the emotion of the original.<br />If you like heavy guitars, deep growls, hard bass lines, and brutal, unforgiving drum beats, buy this album now, you won't regret it.
B00000K19E|3.0|quick question. what do you call a group of people who believe there way is better and then go around killing people indiscriminently to prove it...........if you said terrorist you would be correct.That was one of the many flaws in this movie that kept me from really getting into it. after all morpheus admits \\"we don't know what happened we can only assume humans blocked out the sun to kill the computers\\" (yet what if the sun was fading so in order to survive humans put themselves into this reality?)it beats eating slop from a tube and having no sun. without a real antagonist for this story NEO and his crew are just terrorist. But no big it is only a movie.<BR> as far as the subject matter it was presented in a flashier way but the story is not entirely unique if you have seen \\"THEY LIVE,TOTAL RECALL,ABRE LOS OJOS or several episodes of the \\"outer limits\\" and so on you have seen this idea before.<BR>  Don't get me wrong i enjoyed this movie somewhat...ironically it was all the various flaws in the logic of this movie that caused me to analyze it... thus enjoy it.<BR>   it is mainly the lack of attention to detail that i can't give this five stars i kept saying to my self \\"this would be really good if only...\\"<BR>so in closing i give this movie a generous 3 stars because i did enjoy it even though i thought it only deserved two stars
B00005U2JL|5.0|Both of Marilyn Manson's previous video releases \\"Dead to the World\\" and \\"God Is In the TV\\" were outstanding, I have been waiting forever for this to come out on DVD.  I saw one of the first shows on this tour in Houston back in Nov 2000, and as always Mr. Manson did not disappoint me.  You can probably expect strange imagery, an original loading menu, and awesome special features with this one.  \\"If you die when there's no one watching, and your ratings drop and you're forgotten, if they kill you on their TV, you're a martyr and a Lamb of God.\\"
B00003CXAE|1.0|I've been waiting years for this DVD, so I bought it the first day of release. The wrapper promised high quality Digital Remastered image. What went wrong? They apparently didn't think to clean the film of dust (there are some real whoppers that flash by), and spots reveal that the lenses were dirty as well. I've got DVDs of 1930's movies that look better than this. Shame on Paramount! Rent this before you buy, check it out, and see if you really want to reward them.
0060987464|5.0|When I first heard about this book, I have to admit, I was intrigued to know what a man like Mr. Manson would write, let alone whether or not he could actually get it published (there are some really sick accounts in here y'all).  <br />I first read \\"The Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" in the Spring of '98, and I could not put it down!  For those who may not know, Marilyn Manson (formerly known as Brian Warner) was born and raised in Canton, Ohio, and attended a very strict Christian school, where the teachers used to play metal records and suggest subliminal messages.  The kids were told that if they listened to rock music they would go to hell.  Of course, our hero would buy the records and sell copies of them at school to his classmates, getting suspended from school, and ridiculed by the other kids for being different...  This book conveys that message very well, (Be Yourself, don't let anyone tell you how to live your life) it shows how even a mega rock star can have a normal upbringing, and it gives great examples of what not to do. <br />In summation, read this book if you are a fan of the Reverend's, or you are just looking for a great read.  Just a warning:  This book is not for the faint of heart!
B00006IU73|5.0|So nice to finally see the Tree on a real U.S. label! Now will they finally &quot;make it&quot; here in the States, or has the public's interest in progressive, interesting and challenging music finally waned altogether?? The new album &quot;In Absentia&quot; is generally a combination of the more song-oriented, pop-leaning material of their last two releases, mixed with the more experimental side of albums like &quot;Signify&quot;, with a harder guitar edge occasionally thrown in. All over, a very satisfying album for new and old fans alike. Less reliant on their Pink Floyd-isms, while also not as directionless and loose as some of their earlier material, this one should cement their status as one of the most interesting &quot;prog&quot; bands out today. And unlike so many bands under that banner, the Tree has the chops, and most importantly, the songwriting, to become one of the biggest bands in the world. . . . if people are willing to open up their ears to something other than MTV and rock radio!!
B00005TT77|5.0|Don't let the ultra-purist Beatles fanatics sway you into thinking that this isn't &quot;just like the Beatles&quot; or that this CD's renditions aren't up to some inflated expectations of what the Beatles could be doing today. Of course they aren't &quot;just like the Beatles.&quot; These tunes are well-performed by thoughtful, talented, and excellent musicians.<br />We have truly enjoyed the CD from the first track to the last. It is nice to hear some of the greatest tunes of all time done with a different edge to them.
B00006IX0R|5.0|This greatest hits album is so wonderful since it includes all of my favorite singles by the band. Even though I own all of their CD's, it was great to get them on one CD. This album includes 2 of the Cranberries greatest songs that have been previously unreleased. My favorite is #19 &quot;New New York&quot;. This has got to be one of their better songs! I highly recommmend this album to fans of the Cranberries or to those who just want some good music with a great message!
B00005J9G7|5.0|Few 80s glam bands succeeded with capturing a unique and original sound.  The few that did, such as Cinderella, attained commericial and critical success.   Dinsneyland After Dark (DAD) was an unfortunate exception to this rule.  Although the band possessed great soungs on this album, with lush guitar textures of a clean guitar layered in with distorted guitars, they must've been too European to achieve a great level of success.  Although this album went gold, it was DAD's most commercial, and best album.
B0000542D2|5.0|This is a BEAUTIFUL transfer of the film and GREAT to see LETTER-BOXED!  The sound, especially on the songs is prestine!  When the DVD was first advertised, it was pictured with a wonderful cover featuring elements of the original one-sheet movie poster.  I can't understand why MIRIMAX would chose to re-design the cover in this very un-attractive and disfunctional cover?  Did they think they could improve on the original 1964 Movie poster?  These kind of things always amaze me.  It was probably decided by a focus group of non-fans?  A Small complaint to a GREAT DVD!  I will be glueing the one-sheet (Reduced of course) over the front of this box.  Rick Goldschmidt RANKINBASS HISTORIAN
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Similar to wine, Bruce Dickinson's voice has gotten better with time, and this album proves it. This album may not be as hard or as fast as their earlier great albums but this album is still incredible. With the original line-up from Number Of The Beast album entact, Maiden has written some great songs that beckon to be sung along with no matter how far away your voice is compared to Bruce's. Just like the part where you stand up, point to the heavens and start singing with the song &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot; (you know what part I'm talking about) you'll be doing the same for the song &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; as well as many of the other well written, good ol' rocking songs on this album. Great road album too, with a few faster songs mixed with the mostly slower songs. Now if they just come to tour around Tampa.
B000002MT0|5.0|it took me a while to get into this album. at first i found it too dark with too little substance and not enough melody. but one day i stuck this on for the sheer hell of it and was completely blown away. this album works wonderfully with headphones <regardless of what others might say> and is brilliant from start to finish. papa < track no. 5> is one of the greatest things prince has ever written. it's a song about abuse and when the chorus kicks in it's almost otherworldly, the way he shouts ... in unison with the snare drum is a brilliant piece of production. there are other gems here too- space, pheremone, come, etc... enough to keep you entertained yet still guessing for a long time. i rate this as one of prince's greatest albums and i believe it to be an ideal purchase for anyone who likes anything prince has ever done.
B00000JGHM|4.0|I'm almost ashamed to admit how much I love Michael Mann's movies.  I've read many reviews that complain of their being \\"technology-obsessed\\" and a triumph of style over substance.  In fact, I've always thought his movies were extremely smart, mostly having to do with the dark side of personal freedom and individualism.  \\"Heat\\" is perhaps the sleekest example of this motif, and it is also one of his finest movies.<br />Centered around the confrontation between a world-class bank robber Neil (Deniro) and his pursuer, an equally world-class policeman Vincent (Pacino), the plot seems familiar.  But Mann cleverly alternates between stunning action sequences (most notably, a climactic bank robbery that goes very, very bad) and more somber scenes portraying the disastrous personal lives of the main characters.  Much time is spent detailing Vincent's disintegrating marriage (to the radiant Diane Venora, who also did fine work in Mann's \\"The Insider\\"), while also following the budding romance between Neil and a young shop clerk (the equally radiant Amy Brennerman).  Both relationships are doomed, of course, but they are rendered with a surprising depth and soulfulness that elevates the picture.  And the parallel between Neil and Vincent, while none-too-original, takes on a resonance that is almost mesmerizing, especially in the famous diner scene where they finally meet face-to-face.  In this moment, both characters seem to really learn something about each other (and about themselves).  It's a standard crime melodrama, but brilliantly done.<br /><br />Much was made of the dream-team casting of Pacino and Deniro, and both men give stellar performances in their own varying styles.  But Deniro's seems the finer of the two, in part because his role seems closer to Mann's directorial obsessions, and also to Deniro's own past work.  In many ways, Neil is just another extension of Deniro's famous loner-roles (i.e., \\"Taxi Driver\\" and \\"The Deer Hunter\\"), men so hyper-macho that they live shadow-existences.  (One of the film's nicer touches is Neil's house, a georgous beachfront model that he inhabits alone and with no furniture--a sharp metaphor for his lavish but ultimately hollow life.)  Indeed, the film seems a long, violent meditation on the price of individualism, both in personal and social terms.  (Neil and his crew kill so many innocent people that I lost count.)  Whichever way you interpret it, though, \\"Heat\\" is an undeniably masterful film.
B000066NW0|5.0|Ok, I think this cd ROCKS!  I like the songs.  I don't care whether it is pop/punk/rock or WHATEVER!!  It is good music, and catchy.  I can relate to the lyrics, and I love it!  Who really cares about Avril's \\"image\\"  Her songs are what matter.  If you don't like it don't buy it.  You can listen to samples here at Amazon[.com], so you know what it's like.  Stop complaining about Avril's IMAGE!  Gosh!

0380778556|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book. There are a lot of emotions in it.<br />Daphne du Maurier has written a good novel! Especially the relation between Maxim and his wife is psychologically very interesting.<br />However I gave only three stars, because although the story is interesting and as I wrote already filled with emotions  the end didn't satisfy me totally! Manderley burns down - very suddenly and quickly and then everything is over. That was definitely a fast ending. Too fast for me. There I expected more.
B00005AXEL|5.0|There's a saying among Stevie fans: &quot;Stevie Rocks.&quot; And this CD definitely proves it. I really appreciate how the sequencing of the songs simultaneously lures and captivates the listener, kicking things off with the title track &quot;Trouble in Shangra La,&quot; followed the brilliant and spine-tingling introduction of &quot;Candlebright.&quot; Such an amazing song, and yes, written about Lindsey Buckingham back in the days when she wrote her most classic Fleetwood Mac tunes like &quot;Rhiannon,&quot; and &quot;Landslide.&quot; <br />The absolute most amazing song on the album, and my favorite, is &quot;Sorcerer,&quot; another older and never-before released Stevie tune that has been crafted into one of Stevie's best all-time cuts.  WOW. Sheryl Crow totally nailed it with the production and the rhythm. Simply a brilliant combination, Sheryl and Stevie. You can't help but wonder what they could have done together had Sheryl had time to produce the entire album. You just gotta love every last nuance of &quot;Sorcerer,&quot; especially Stevie's improvisational vocalizing toward the end. MOJO!  In fact, I was dismayed that &quot;Sorcerer&quot; wasn't the first single from the album. It seemed like the record company wanted to play it safe by releasing &quot;Every Day&quot; as the single, but that song isn't even penned by Stevie. (although she sings it wonderfully, and it is a sweet departure from some of the intensity of some of the album, it doesn't hold a candle to &quot;Candlebright&quot; or &quot;Sorcerer.&quot;)<br />Stevie pays homage to her country roots with &quot;Too Far From Texas,&quot; in which she duets with Dixie Chick Natalie Maines. Fun.  And the song, &quot;That Made Me Stronger,&quot; inspired by Tom Petty, really does rock. (No surprise that Sheryl produced this one as well.) Vocally, Stevie is in the finest form ever, and this song really captures it.<br />Personally, I don't care that much for &quot;Love Changes,&quot; mainly because therhythmic intro seems dated and uninspired. The album ends with &quot;Love Is,&quot; very personal and intimate.  Anyone who has loved Stevie throughout her career will really enjoy this album, so buy it and marvel at one of the great female rockers ever.
B00006F7S4|4.0|If Beck had manic depression, and &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; was his manic phase, then &quot;Sea Change&quot; is the hard-hitting, depressive comedown.  I've been a huge Beck fan for years, and even I was surprised by this departure.  &quot;Sea Change&quot; gives up his trademark abstract lyricism for words that are sadder and more sparse.  Many of these songs, especially &quot;Round the Bend&quot;, recall &quot;Pink Moon&quot;-era Nick Drake.<br />All sadness aside, Nigel Goodrich did an amazing production job on this album.  Songs like &quot;Already Dead&quot; and &quot;Side of the Road&quot; are simple acoustic-guitar-driven affairs.  At other times, with soaring string arrangements and cavernous vocal reverb, many of the songs have an epic quality (&quot;Sunday Sun&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Tears&quot;, etc).<br />This is, essentially, a Beck album without any moments of levity, which can make it quite a tough listen.  But then again, if you've had a tough day, this might just be perfect for you.  For first time purchasers of a Beck disc, start elsewhere.  For Beck fans, however, this should be a welcome addition to the collection.
B00006F7S4|1.0|After the distarious bomb that was \\"Midnite Vultures\\" (an album that I made the mistake of actually purchasing) and all his awful tracks that he had released before \\"Midnite\\", I tried to give Beck one more chance. <br />This man, along with PJ Harvey, has been an obsession with the rock press since his 1994 debut, \\"Mellow Gold\\". He's adored by them, he can do no wrong to them. But I find his music to be quite frankly, gimmicky novelty garbage. He's no creator and his \\"weirdness\\" is very forced. <br />\\"Sea Change\\" is an attempt to give a \\"quieter, more introspective\\" Beck and and it fails! And to think that I actually tried to give him another chance! The production's awful (and would they stop just piecing random pieces of [junk] and off-key guitar playing and calling it \\"avant-garde\\"!!!) and Beck has to be one of the worst vocalists this side of \\"J.Lo\\". His voice is thin, squeaky, and annoying. And the \\"songs\\" are god-awful. Just his TERRIBLE singing to corny, faux-hipster ballads. Aww, man, the contempt! <br />... But I was upset by this awful recording that I had to listen to. In conclusion, I'm going to say that Beck is a genius. Why? He has no talent and just pieces awful music together and it's acclaimed! This means that you're dog should be getting a record deal soon too!
B00003CXXP|5.0|There aren't enough future technology morality movies made and this is a prime example of what we need more of. There are so many lifestyle shattering technologies on the horizon and these kinds of questions MUST be answered before we go too far. Thank you Spielberg for being brave enough to tackle these issues in such a beautiful format. And please people they are NOT ALIENS at the end, lol.
B00006AG5N|5.0|I was suspicious of a \\"remastered\\" album for Elvis Presley, but after reading an interview with the producer, and seeing his enthusiasm for the project, I bought it. I have to say, this is wonderful. The sound quality is fantastic. On many songs, you can hear the intimate details of recording: breaths taken between lines, Elvis slapping his guitar. On the songs from the seventies, where the original recording was also in stereo, they were able to bring out so many instruments and voices you've never heard before. Die-hard fans and the merely curious alike will enjoy this album.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Very good, all the way through. If this does not win at least one album of the year award, it will be a crime. It is a mellow album, so if you are expecting party music you may be disappointed. But it is obvious from listening to this guy that he is an extremely talented songwriter and performer. I own all of his albums (as far as I know) and this one is already my favorite. Mellow and sad, but very good.
B000002KDG|5.0|I gotta disagree with another reviewer who said Live Rust is better and you should buy that instead of this.  Live Rust is great, I love it, but it doesn't have Thrasher, one of the best songs Neil ever wrote!  Or Pocahontas, or Sail Away, or Ride My Llama, I mean these are some of the best songs Neil has ever written and if you just buy Live Rust you don't get them.  Bottom line: buy Rust Never Sleeps AND Live Rust!!
B00006F7S4|5.0|Possibly his best.  &quot;Already Dead&quot; made me cry, &quot;Paper Tiger&quot; is epic.  Great break-up album if nothing else.  But it is something else, a great album period.  Beck is awesome.
B000002KOO|5.0|It's too bad that Fleetwood Mac has had so many incarnations, varied incarnations, over the years. In the end, they're really the story of a couple of the finest guitar players (Green &amp; Kirwan) to ever play together. Sounds over the top, I know, but I think these guys were each touched by the gods in some cruel way. It's hard to find a sense of touch, fire, vibrato, soulfulness, clarity, tone and speed that Kirwan and Green both had. And look where they both ended up. Mad, alcoholic, homeless, wandering, broken. They probably reached their peak with Then Play On. Great, searching, avant-blues stuff.
B00006IU73|5.0|Being a recent new fan of PT, starting with Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun,and my fav, Signify. I found them all in the same mold,(with Signify being more spacey but wonderful) great atmospheric tunes with great lyrics and vocals, some say a little Floydish, but I feel they have their own sound on each and every new album they do.  On In Absentia, PT is slighty changing again. In Absentia is song for song, the best Porcupine Tree recording, there is no filler, all fantastic.  The album starts off with one of the best new songs, Blackest Eyes, noticing a heavier guitar sound, one of the best on the album. The Sound of Musak is another standout, featuring great melodic leads and the PT vocals. Gravity Eyelids is also a standout sounding like the Signify era with a few heavy guitar parts thrown in that are the icing on the tree. Strip the Soul is an intense song with new heavier guitar tones for PT that absolutely knock me out. If Heart Attack in a lay by does not move you, you will never be moved at all, a beautiful tune.  The ending song is classic PT and takes you to another place, space and time. Overall, the new cd is a 5 plus, featuring classic PT with a few new guitar sounds that are definately heavier then anything they have done before. Steven Wilson is an amazing songwriter. The bass is also a highlight of this album and is the best I ever heard it in PT's history. What can I say, a classic PT album.
0780626966|5.0|\\"The first word in terror from the creator of Scream.\\" <br />This collection is awesome, it`s complete all 7 installments of the Nightmare franchise! 3-Amazing films, and 4 others which aren`t to pleasing. But still, great! Buy it now, and you won`t at all be dissapointed.
0783226837|4.0|This movie isn't horror. It's a comedy that makes fun of horror movies. It has the same mix of humor and action that made \\"Ghostbusters\\" so popular, but with much more gratuitous worm guts being splattered all over our heroes. Popular enough among its fans to inspire two sequels and an upcoming TV SERIES on the Sci-Fi channel, but obscure enough for its fans to consider themselves special, this is something you gotta watch. The paranoid gun freak totally steals the show, and was so funny that he held the lead role in T3!<br />Humor, senseless violence, and supreme cheesiness - the perfect way to spend an hour or two.
0385720920|2.0|This was my first Palahniuk book, and very likely my last. While I enjoyed the film Fight Club, this effort seemed to recycle many of the same elements of that story with much less at stake. The central character is a loser sex addict who revels in appearing to be emotionless and cynical. His offhand sex addiction, and the scenes concerning that, is presumably supposed to be \\"gritty\\" and \\"shocking\\" to the reader, which is kind of a ridiculous notion in this age. Is there anything that can be truly \\"shocking\\" in literature anymore in the wake of Burroughs or more recent novels like American Psycho (which by the way, is a modern classic) and Trainspotting (another amazing book)?<br />The plot (such as there is), revolves around the protagonist's relationship with his mother, a situationist/anarchist now in an expensive hospice for the insane. He pays for this via an elaborate scam whereby every night he pretends to choke in restaurant so that someone can save his life. Then he writes to these people and emotionally blackmails them into sending him money. This is cute and clever, but if you stop and think about it, unlikely to work both in terms of money (he supposedly makes $3,000 month through this), and practicality (food industry people tend to know each other, and it wouldn't take long for his scam to come to light). Flashback chapters shed light on his offbeat childhood in a halfhearted attempt to explain his current malaise.<br />His day job involves working in a colonial-era historic village, somewhat like Williamsburg. This is a nice milieu for some rather funny scenes, but little else. It seems there's some mystery about who his father is, and over the course of the book this becomes more and more important until it overwhelms all else, unfortunately, the reader is unlikely to care. This is a muddled and weak book just barely redeemed by being terrible by three really funny scenes.
B00005B238|3.0|Jesse Ventura says it all. Even after being shot, he is so caught up in the action that he barely even notices. Watching this movie has a similar effect: most of the time, you'll be so involved in the suspense/action/horror/whatever that you won't even realize how mediocre this movie is. That's a good thing. This movie stands out in other ways, too: the Predator is extremely well-done, with more and more slowly being revealed over the course of the movie. The characters are MUCH more distinct than those in other horror/action movies without falling into any stereotypes, and there is a genuine feeling of comraderie between them. The way the actors do everything feels very authentic, and gives the impression that they really are experienced military troops. The whole \\"shallow plot but extremely well-done\\" routine is very similar to that of the first Alien movie, so it's no wonder that Dark Horse combined the two.<br />Overall, a very cool ride, despite the paper-thin plot.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Great collection of The Kings hits from the 50's into 2002.Finally all his best on one cd. 79 minutes. This will get you rocking.
0316921173|4.0|...you'd get Infinite Jest. One of the most original books that I've ever read. It's hard to sum up this sprawling book, even harder to figure out what it was really about. I have to say that the main draw in this novel for me was the style of the prose. Wallace's lengthy, twisting, complex langauge is like a tasty taffy...it's to get through at times, but the struggle is oddly enjoyable. Wallace is addicted to detail that both amuses and infuriates. (For example, his lengthy footnotes, many of which cover the particulars of the pharmaceuticals that the characters are taking for allergies or other reasons.) I stuck with it to the end, expecting a good wrap-up that would explain the point of the story. Instead, the book simply ran out of pages without ever attempting to tie things together. Depite my disappointment over this kind of ending, I still recommend it.
0380778556|2.0|Rebecca was one of the worst book I've ever read. It was very boring and not very special for me. It may be good a book for readers who like romance and mysterious stories, but for those who like tension and action it's not the right one and not my taste. Sorry!!!
0380002930|5.0|Richard Adams's quirky masterpiece is what you might have gotten if J.R.R. Tolkien had written _Wind in the Willows_. It's a book that would have made C.S. Lewis weep tears of joy, if he had lived long enough to read it. This is the epic story of a group of rabbits who wander across the English countryside looking for a place to found a new warren, after their old home has been destroyed by developers. For once, the word &quot;epic&quot; really is warranted. _Watership Down_ has many echoes of classical literature. The basic story line resembles Virgil's _Aeneid_--the apocalyptic destruction of an established society and the flight of a group of exiles to establish a new home, guided by prophecy and beset by dangers. As with the _Aeneid_, the second half of _Watership Down_ is taken up with the rabbits' attempts to establish their new home, and their struggles with their neighbors, both human and animal. Like the early Romans (though this story comes not from Virgil but from Livy) the rabbits are all male and have to abduct females from elsewhere, and this brings them into conflict with the viciously formidable General Woundwort, a rabbit dictator of great personal valour combined with utter ruthlessness (who could easily have been the model for the Killer Rabbit of Monty Python fame). General Woundwort's totalitarian warren is one of the two obvious pieces of allegorical satire in the book. The other concerns a society of fat, decadent rabbits who have forgotten the ancient myths of their people and live a life of ease tinged with a fear that they don't dare to name--a chilling portrait of our own society, surely. But most of the book can be enjoyed without thinking of such things. Adams has created a world with meticulous detail--the only greater achievement along this line in modern literature is the _Lord of the Rings_. The rabbit myths, customs, and language seem utterly real. Like all the best animal fantasies, _Watership Down_ gives you rabbits who are both extremely human and extremely rabbitlike. Adams's character portrayal is impeccable, and his style has exactly the range and power needed--grandiloquent at one moment and tenderly mock-heroic at another. For anyone who loves imaginative literature, this is a book that must be read.
B00006ADFL|5.0|_Heavenly Creatures_ may well be Peter Jackson's finest film, including _Lord of the Rings_.  This &quot;director's cut&quot; DVD (which I gather was the European theatrical cut) runs about ten minutes longer than the version previously available to Americans.  Film and audio transfers are very good, but not outstanding; extras are practically nonexistent (theatrical trailer only, folks!).<br />At the low price, _Heavenly Creatures_ is definitely worth purchasing if you're a Jackson fan.  Otherwise, just rent it.
0553213105|5.0|If a classic is boring, then this is not a classic. If a drawing-room comedy is stiff and trivial, then this is not a drawing-room comedy. This is quite simply one of the loveliest, wittiest, most utterly _wise_ novels ever written about human relationships. Every word sparkles. The dialogue fairly dances. And Austen does this without any of the things that we often assume make for an exciting novel. The most suspenseful question that arises is whether a certain two characters in the novel have gone to Scotland or to London (this is suspenseful for reasons having to do with 18th-century English marriage laws and social mores). And this event, certainly the most sensational in the book, is really only important because it helps the two central characters make up their minds about each other. Austen's world is a world in which every detail really counts--in which the slightest look or the most insignificant word can have earth-shaking meaning. And the result of this, as of all great literature, is to send us back into our own worlds with the renewed conviction that it all really does matter. In that sense, Austen's &quot;realistic&quot; fiction is a lot like good fantasy, such as Lord of the Rings. By heightening certain aspects of our experience, Austen gives new life to the &quot;commonplace&quot; world we live in. This is a book that makes you feel alive, and glad of it.
B00006AG5N|5.0|All in all it is a must for any music fan. If you are going to buy one Elvis disk this may be the one to grab. The sound has been cleaned up but surprisingly with some alternate takes replacing the hit versions. \\"The Wonder of You\\" being the most glaring dupe. Pretty standard fare for RCA to pull something like that.You would think they could leave well enough alone.
B00006AG5N|5.0|I personally thought it was a real good cd. I couldn't have expected more from it except I wish the song &quot;My Way&quot; was put on it. He sang the song with so much passion. Besides that I love the cd. It has a bunch of his hits on it and everyone I know seems to enjoy it. Even my 5 year old niece. So.. his songs do live on.<br />For what Rich said about Elvis not being King. It honestly doesn't matter what he thinks because there are so many other people who do fall in love with his music. So his opinion lasts in his heart, but in the Elvis fans we enjoy the music and know what we know and will believe in it forever. Elvis did too much good in his life and I appreciate that. Just from me though Rich must have been terribly bored to write his message.
0380817683|5.0|This was my favorite (but only just), of all the Marian Keyes books.  I had much sympathy for Rachel during her adventure in this book yet also found her very amusing. <br />Rachel is a very believable 3D character, and though the story is amusing it also has a tasteful insight into addiction and recovery, I found it surprisingly educational.<br />Keyes's observant and hilarious writing style is evident throughout, maintaining the readers interest until the end.  <br />The best thing I liked about this book was the constant surprises in it.
1558216847|3.0|Too bad it's unlikely to be true.  Slavomir presents the reader with at least a half dozen incidents that are too hard to swallow.  Any one of them would have represented an astonishing convergence of circumstances, but so many.....and to one man.  My heart wants to believe but my mind tells me otherwise.  The inability to locate Mr. Smith or even a descendent is what most raises my eyebrow, and I beleive that the selection of America's most common name 'Smith' was very calculated.   <br />In order for old Slavomir to write this story one would have to believe that he had experienced at least a part of it....and that's the real shame of the &quot;The Long Walk&quot;.....I prefer a true yet less eventful story over a fairy tale any day.<br />If by some miracle Mr. Rawicz did manage to walk from Siberia to India without so much as a container to carry water....and while in route he encountered the abominable snowman.....then I offer the sincerest of apologies.<br />I give 3 stars for an incredible story and an admirable ability to generate controversy and sell books.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Beatles, Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, etc. and the list can go on and on. Yes, Chuck Berry and Little Richard may have created this art form but Elvis refined it and made it popular. That is why he is KING.<br />This album has been engineered so that it sounds as if it was recorded in a modern studio. Elvis's voice sounds rich and you can't help but be amazed how his vocals alone can carriy a song with lack of sophisticated equipment and instruments. Yes, I may be biased but this album is a MUST for any rock n roll lover.
B00006AG5N|5.0|The sound quality alone makes this cd worthwhile.  They didn't just clean the sound up. Where possible, they made it sound so fresh that it could have been recorded in the best studio last month!  You somehow get more a sense of Elvis with this cd, the crispness of the sound gets rid of that &quot;oldies&quot; sound that turns many people away at face value(not me, but to each his own).  So if you'd like to hear what Elvis would sound like with today's equipment, here it is.  Nothing has been added, nor taken away.  It's just that each track of each song has been restored to brilliance with a lot of care.  This cd rocks, I mean it's got the most successful songs Elvis ever put out.  It sounds awesome and will put your subwoofer to the test.  I'm listening to Jailhouse Rock right now and the clarity in which Elvis' voice comes through, along with the great bass response and crisp sound make it even more rockin'.  I would recommend this to anyone.  If you're curious about Elvis, this is a perfect introduction to 31 of his best hits.  The remix of &quot;A little less conversation&quot; had it's success after this cd was just about completed and was added as a bonus track.  And besides, 30 is a good round number, so what if it should be technically called 31 #1 hits.  There could have been many other number one hits if they had gone into the R&amp;B,country,or easy listening charts, but they stayed with scoring authorities like Billboard and Cashbox.  I once calculated how many #1 Hits Elvis really had and it was over 40.  But anyway, this is a great cd filled to the top with rock and roll that just doesn't make itself heard much these days with few notable exceptions like the Stray Cats and the Dempsey's.  Find the roots of a rockstar right here and ROCK ON!
B000002JB8|4.0|This may not be as deep and sweeping as Suzanne Cianti's piano interpretations of the ocean mood, but it's good, exotic sounding music.  It is more relaxing and meditative than tempestuous.<br />It is definitely new age, and lacks the depth that you'll find in Andreas Vollenweider, for instance.  For background, it is quite listenable.
B000069CWE|5.0|Before this &quot;Reanimation&quot; album, I wasn't a huge Linkin Park fan (even more so after seeing one of their soulless concerts) - I'm more into Black Eyed Peas, P.O.D., Smashing Pumpkins, and Radiohead.<br />But this remix album is far superior to the original for a few reasons.<br />For starters, Hybrid Theory was just too slick for my taste...a production album that lacked heart - like they were just playing into the current trends of rock and hip hop fusion (like Limp Bizkit - but better). I tend to like groups who like to experiment with different sounds and fuse them together with different elements to create original compositions (not just blatant samplings of old songs like P-Diddy - but like how the Pumpkins and Radiohead come out with new sounds that become music that is extraordinary).<br />With the remix album you get all that...rock, hip hop, and experimentation...probably the best example of fusion that I've come across so far...this the not only &quot;Hybrid Theory,&quot; but &quot;Hybrid Reality&quot; the way it was supposed to be. If you listen closely you will hopefully appreciate the hard work it took to take apart and reinvent the songs.
B00006F7S4|1.0|This cd is one big BORE. All of the songs are depressing. None of them are good. Buy at your own risk. Even if you are a fan of Beck's previous efforts, you should avoid this one at all costs.
0380778556|3.0|This story is a combination of love-story and crime thriller. I think this is a good idea to conbine those subjects.Somebody could write an interesting and exciting story. But this book is written in rather a boring way. The intervals between two events are too long and the excitement is not sustained throughout. But at least there is a lot of excitement.<br />It's a story about a shy young woman and her husband, who has killed his first wife. And nobody knows that he has killed Rebecca, just his second wife knew all. At least Manderlay burnt down.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I was never really a fan of Beck before. Sure, I'd secretly rock out to 'Loser' occasionally if I came across it on the radio while driving alone. But with this album, Beck has flushed me right down the toilet with him. This sad, mellow exploration into Beck's sorrow is a masterpiece. He has never, and will never make a better record.
B00006AG5N|5.0|to &quot;rich in boston&quot; wake up and get a life. if he does`nt, or more pertinently, WON`T acknowledge the artistry and genius of these recordings he does`nt know ZILCH about music. suffice for me to say, that, if you wish to find out where it all started from, you could do worse than purchasing this cd/record/cassette etc........
0393317552|5.0|In this book, Diamond attempts to show why Eurasians came to politically dominate native Africans, Americans, and Australians--even though Africa has been human territory for a much longer time than anywhere else on earth.  An over-simplified version of his argument is this:<br />1.  The domestication of plants and animals was the first key to building a society that could dominate others over a wide area.  Any society that domesticates a species (wheat, orange, horse, cow, etc.) can move that species with them as part of cultural or military conquest--but only to an area with a similar climate.<br />Eurasia has a huge area of similar climate, and most initial conquerers moved between east and west in that same climatic zone. <br />When an African or American society domesticated a species, they couldn't generally take it with them, because they usually had to move north or south--and thus into a different climate.  (The Nile valley and all of Africa above the Sahara are part of the Eurasian climate zone, and generally shared its advantages.)<br />2.  Eurasians were simply lucky.  They had many more species of both plants and animals suitable for domestication.  Even with modern technology and experience, there are many fewer species suitable for initial domestication in Africa, the Americas, and Australia.  (Genetic engineering may change this, but the Eurasians control that technology too, at present.  Could the hope of Africa be  to become much more permissive and risk-taking with biotech?)<br />3.  Once you've got agriculture, you get cities, and humans living close to animals.  Initially, that makes people more exposed to mutations of animal diseases, but over time the survivors develop an immunity.  When later the survivors make contact with other humans, those others die of diseases their ancestors never confronted.  (90% of all Native American deaths after the European conquest were due to disease, not war.)<br />It's fascinating speculation, and truly doestry to address one of the great questions of history.  For now, it's left to future research to try to prove or disprove the broad theory, if that can even be done.<br />As others have pointed out, Diamond shouldn't have tried to guess why Europeans currently dominate Asians and Middle Easterners--all three of which had the same advantages.  His arguments do better at explaining Euriasian dominance of others  than they do at explaining the more back-and-forth between various Eurasian cultures.<br />It's not clear to me that Diamond's forces are currently at work, in the sense that any new species domesticated now would almost certainly be transported easily all over the world.  Eurasia has won and unless its culture destroys itself, others will have to join that culture to be competitive.  (One possible exception is the AIDS pandemic.  African societies may be forced, through lack of medication, to develop a genetic immunity to AIDS, where other parts of the world could end up treating the symptoms well enough that the genetic exposure remains.)<br />I think the best way to view this book is as an explanation of the history of the last 500 years.  If you like broad-brush speculation with a LOT of interesting facts across multiple disciplines, I think you'll love this book.  I sure did.
0380778556|5.0|I recommend the book anybody, who doesn't want to make a fault by searching a new novel to read. You will surely love the book. As I read the book for the first time I found the beginning a little bit difficult to understand, but after two or three chapters I began to understand the story and gradually I couldn't stop reading. What I specially like, is the uncertainty of what will happen. The course of the story always changes, every moment things can happen, that you would never expect. Another interesting point is that the book doesn't begin with the beginning of the story, but with the end. At the beginning Manderley burns down and the first person narrator want to tell us the reason.<br />What I've very found exciting, was that I never expected, that Rebecca was as such person as she's at the end. I thought she was so lovely, but the truth isn't so.<br />The only thing what I can still say is that you have to read this book. I found exciting from the beginning to the end.
B00000HYXB|5.0|Given the genre, this CD really is an amazing piece of work. It combines heavy metal with J.R.R. Tolkien's world of elves, dark lords, and other mythical creatures. The vocals are absolutely ear shattering (in a good way)! The singer has one heck of a range! The guitar playing is very sold, great sound there. And the drumming is equally impressive. The songs are very long, but this a band of storytellers, and they do their craft well. I can only say I was disappointed that Peter Jackson didn't use some of their music for the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; soundtrack. This band certainly plays the hell out of Enya!
B00006F83Y|5.0|I was worried that QOTSA might not be able to live up to the strength of their self titled album or Rated R with this, their third and a half release.<br />I wasted my time worrying.<br />The songs on this album range from fairly exciting to outright beautiful. I knew this album would never be banished to my drawer of mediocrity by the second track. <br />\\"First it Giveth\\" convinced me that this album was probably going to be as great as their previous two albums. <br />\\"The Sky is Falling\\" just blew me away. It's even more compelling than \\"Mexicola\\" and \\"I Think I Lost My Headache\\". <br />If you liked their previous albums, be assured that this will not disappoint you. If you have never heard QOTSA before, you may as well start here.
B000003TA4|5.0|From the ages of 13-16 I was a Nirvana junkie. I owned every CD, read any book or magazine about them, and when Kurt committed suicide -- well, that just gave him god-like status! \\"Nevermind\\" is definitely one of the best grunge CDs I've ever heard. While the musical style or songwriting isn't that complex (\\"Come As You Are\\" was among of the first songs I learned to play when I started learning guitar), the actual tracks do have some catchy riffs and lyrics among them (anyone who has heard \\"Lithium\\" or \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" knows exactly what I am talking about). Drummer Dave Grohl is a really solid drummer and I was surprised when he became the frontman for Foo Fighters. He should have stuck with the drumming! Kurt's vocals are raw -- scratchy, growling, and tormented at times (this was even more intenisified on the \\"In Utero\\" CD), but this only adds to the overall effect of the CD. The band had an amazing impact on the music scene, and NOT owning this CD would be a major mistake.
0393317552|5.0|Sometimes, an author writes a book and because you know so little of the subject matter, anything they write about is great because it is new to you. Sometimes, authors have the ability to write, and just write well. Jared Diamond has done so and more because he links the principles of selection, based on evolution into the social realm of humanity and its history. Great. Diamond also introduces readers to an environmental history of the world. Thanks. Cheers!
B00005JKDR|4.0|At Pixar Animation, the love of detail both seen and unseen is expressed in the company mantra: &quot;We sand the undersides of the drawers.&quot; The fruits of this obsession are on display in the DVD release of &quot;Monsters, Inc.,&quot; the animation blockbuster that examines when bad things happen to things that go bump in the night.<br />The Buena Vista Home Entertainment release sprawls over two discs, with a clear separation of extras for kids (they enter a door marked Monsters) and adults (Humans). The segregation is helpful, but everyone will want to go everywhere anyway. A new &quot;Monster's, Inc.&quot; cartoon (&quot;Mike's New Car&quot;) exclusive to the disc should delight everyone, regardless of age. It includes what could be a dubious first: a cartoon character using a cell phone when trouble strikes.<br />The crush of special features can be a bit much, so the chronically zany folks at Pixar do their best to help along viewers. Clad in Hawaiian shirts and groomed for Disneyland duty, key filmmakers do video intros for many of the extras categories.  Civilians will find the filmmakers' commentary quite a challenge, however. Away from the visual arena, the men of Pixar lose their zip, with the discussion devolving into a survey of the film's problem-solving process. As with many group commentaries, it's hard to tell who is talking -- and when they drift off into a long discussion about the Sock, you probably won't care.<br /> &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; looks great, of course. Those lucky enough to first see the film in theaters with digital projection will find the look a bit soft, but the pastels are undeniably beautiful and easy on the eyes. The Dolby Digital EX 5.1 mix sounds solid and focused, with the rear channels used effectively for some dialogue.

B000001EQT|5.0|Let's face it - Marc Bolan's lyrics make about as much sense as a typical episode of &quot;The Power Rangers&quot; (does anyone really know what a &quot;hub cap diamond star halo&quot; is?) - but he sure had a gift for writing big pop hooks and effortlessly casting off crunchy, fuzzy-sounding riffs from his Les Paul.  This is as close to perfection as early 70's glam gets, liberally coated with a layer of cosmic fairy dust and boasting crystalline production.  Containing no filler, every track on &quot;The Slider&quot; casts a huge shadow over its contemporaries, including - at the risk of bringing the wrath of Bowie fans worldwide on my head - &quot;The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust.&quot;  Unfortunately, there are a million stories with no happy ending in The Big (Rock) City and Bolan's became one of them when his girlfriend wrapped his mini around a tree about five or six years after this was released.  Feh...
B0000542D2|5.0|\\"A Hard Day's Night\\" makes most critics' best-ever lists. It's widely considered an electrifying mix of great music and hip comedy, both a time capsule of the swinging '60s and a timeless entertainment. Roger Ebert calls it \\"one of the great life-affirming landmarks of the movies.\\"<br />Respect hasn't led to respectful treatment. Legal wrangling followed \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" throughout its home video life, resulting in oddities like the \\"tribute to John Lennon\\" musical prologue tacked on for VHS. The first DVD version, from MPI in 1997, disappeared after a few months of distribution.<br />Here, finally, is an up-to-date rendition worthy of the film.<br />\\"A Hard Day's Night\\" looks and sounds about as good as could be expected. The carefully lit black-and-white images should please most viewers -- even though they're on the flat side, with persistent minor speckling. The stereophonic songs swing as they must, smoking the tracks on Capitol's (shamefully outdated) soundtrack CD. (The MPI video had significantly worse sound but deeper contrasts.) Try this: Put on the Capitol version of \\"Tell Me Why\\" and then play the movie version. Perhaps Capitol can tell us why they continue to sell 15 year old Beatles CDs.<br />The film, shot in 35mm, is presented in widescreen, letterboxed with a ratio of about 1.66:1, enhanced for 16x9 televisions. The spiffed-up audio comes via Dolby Digital, with the musical numbers in stereo.<br />The first disc contains the movie as well as \\"Things They Said Today,\\" a new promo film that gives the big picture. The second disc is all interviews, arranged by category (cast, crew, etc.).<br />Martin Lewis, a Beatles historian and pal to most of the filmmakers, conducted 30 video interviews for the package. They include key players -- Martin, director Richard Lester, United Artists exec David Picker, cinematographer Gilbert Taylor (\\"Star Wars\\") and Beatles publicist Tony Barrow -- as well as those who were just lucky to find themselves working on a film project \\"at the center of the universe.\\"<br />The reminiscences get infusions of energy from upbeat clips, some amplifying the talkers' points and others making Beatle-esque visual jokes. The production was extensively filmed and photographed, with hours of that material first seen in this collection. The interviews are tightly edited, surprisingly focused and often a great deal of fun. It becomes clear that contributing to the film profoundly changed the lives of most of these people.n a film project \\"at the center of the universe.\\"<br />The reminiscences get infusions of energy from upbeat clips, some amplifying the talkers' points and others making Beatle-esque visual jokes.

B00005RHGK|1.0|I was feeling tense until I suddenly found out this whole movie is based around a devil guy with wings, and when he started whistling all the suspense and build up faded away and replaced with pathetic laughter. After that I didn't care about the characters, or about the rest of the movie. I found it a ugly dry empty attempt at 'something new' when it was anything but. I could not believe a movie in this day and age that has more holes than a 50s B-movie plot, like why would this guy burn his basement when he'd burn his art piece he's been making for god knows how long? Badly thought through and to top it off, some fine acting...<br />A classic example of Hollywood raping good ideas, in this decade where films, music and computer games are being recycled over and over again, and this is their attempt at something new???  Please avoid this movie, and check out Ring instead. Unfortunately that movie is to be raped real soon, with a western version as well as their own attempt at Battle Royale. God help us....
6302797535|5.0|This Film is a parody of all detective stories we can imagine, in literature, in the cinema and on TV. So we jump from one Colombo to another Hercule Poirot and many others, with their accents and their idiosyncrasies. But what's more all those private eyes and detectives are gathered in some strange house to solved a mystery murder they will never be able to solve but it will reveal that every one of them is in a way some kind of crook because his or her private life is just the antagon of what the private eyes in them represent in our culture : honesty and rectitude, the fight against crime. This gives us a very hilarious and absolutely entertaining film to be consumed in moderation not to choke on your own laughing.
B00006AG5N|5.0|It's all his number ones on ONE cd...What more can you ask for? This is a great chronological compilation that takes your through Elvis's career via his number one hits from the early days to the Vegas years. Even though some of my most favorite Elvis songs were not number 1s...this CD is well worth it! Elvis will always be one of the greatest entertainers and vocalists to walk the earth.
B000069CWE|1.0|How can you so uterly destroy a bunch of great songs?!  Some how they managed it with these remixes.  Take the Hybrid Theory CD and remove it's edge, throw in a bunch of techno stutter, slurs, C-RAP, over power the vocals with background and you've got this waste of money.  Thank the powers for P2P and Delete.
B00005A46T|5.0|Slipknot are one of the best bands to emerge from the crowded nu metal genre. And they are also one of the heaviest bands to also. Some people like to critize them by saying why would I want to listen to a band that screams all the time? Well if you are ever REALLY angry then you will know why, and if you dont like heavy music then just dont buy any metal albums. This is in my opinion not as good as their self-titled album, but it is VERY good also. Anyway if you like metal not alot of nu metal check this out. IT is just like Pantera or Slayer. Anyway Highly Reccomended!
B00006AG5N|4.0|I am no Elvis fan, and just bought the disc on a whim. The clarity of the re-mastering job shows an amazing talent at the height of his powers. He puts power and meaning into the most mundane lyrics by sheer force of will. The compilation features 30 tracks that hit number one either in the US or UK. Many of your favorites are omitted, but there is a lot of bang for the buck. Listen - really listen - to &quot;Hound Dog&quot; and &quot;All Shook Up.&quot; You'll realize that 50 million Elvis fans really were right after all.
0385335482|5.0|Much like Becky Bloomwood, I am a journalist (fortunately not financial) who adores the fine art of shopping. Discovering a great deal is cause for celebration for both myself and Becky - camel leather Kate Spade heels for $26 on clearance at TJ Maxx? -got those this week! <br />From the first time I read this fine literary work to the last time (which was the fifth) I find myself wishing that Becky Bloomwood really existed and was my best friend. From her hilarious justifications for hiding zebra stiped jeans, to her love of champagne, mile high heels and sexy Luke Bradon, Becky Bloomwood exemplifies the girl that most 20-somethings would love to be, minus her debt, of course! I would recommend this book to any girl who adores a light hearted, satisfying read - and of course, any stylish girl that loves to shop. Ditto for Shopaholic Takes Manhattan.
B00006AG5N|5.0|You can tell right away that the sound is incredible from the first track Heartbreak Hotel to the last track A Little Less Conversation. The sound of this cd is so clear it seems like some of the songs were just recorded yesterday.  Even if you heard all of these songs before they sound like you are listening to them for the first time.  If you do get this cd be ready for a jaw dropping experience when you listen to it.  Incredible!!!
B0000542D2|5.0|I still remember the first time I saw this film.  I've been a fan of the British style of humor ever since.  These guys were fearless, natural, and very talented.  The documentary style of the file was a brilliant choice and Paul's Grandfather was genious.  Reading the reviews posted here, there seems to a huge base of fans and just a few people who seemed to miss the point altogether.  These people seem to want their entertainment served up with all the blanks filled in, a cardboard plot instead of a reflection of life.  For those of us who like to think, who like to wonder, who can figure things out for ourselves, who like nuttiness combined with subtle humor and surreal images, who have open minds, and an appreciation for good music and groundbreaking film, this movie is very satisfying.
0316666343|3.0|This book has made me look at my child rearing responsibilities in a whole new light.  I am constantly reminding my children to be cautious of everyone, even neighbors and acquaintances.  Also disturbing to me was the idea that in this little girl's heaven, she still worried and had anxieties she had when living.
B00005A1PR|5.0|India.Aire just dropped her new CD entitled, Voyage to India yesterday and in anticipation of the new arrival, I was listening to Acoustic Soul all week.  I decided to come on ... and offer a review of Acoustic Soul just in case there is anyone out there still undecided about this album.  <br />If I had to sell this album in one sentence I would say:  many artists come out with emotional albums that express a small range of emotion, but Acoustic Soul is one of the few times we get to experience a beautiful soul on a record, celebrating every aspect of life and the human experience.<br />The key word is celebrating...because for India.Aire everything is a cause for celebration.  She celebrates her ancestors, she celebrates herself, she celebrates love, and she even celebrates the struggles that made India.Aire who she is. She is no pollyanna though, she embraces the real world with the wonder of a child and the wisdom of an old soul.<br />India.Aire is a phenomenal talent.  She has that rare gift that taps her into every age group and demographic music that sometimes grooves and sometimes soothes, but always delivers something fresh yet familiar at the same time.  The final track on the album is a bonus track entitled Wonderful that is an ode to Stevie Wonder.   How fitting because it is Stevie whom she bares the most resemblance to.  She is not the prodigious musician (although she wields her guitar with ease and amble dexterity), but she has that charm in her music that inspires and captures the heart of the listener.  She actually manages to deliver the same tingle in the listener that I am sure she feels whenever she puts on Innervisions or Songs in the Key of Life.<br />One gets the sense that if nothing else, India.Aire has balance in her life.  This album is consistently listenable, but varied throughout.  Don't let the title acoustic soul fool you.  With the exception of the moving Intro which continues later as and Interlude and Outro, each song has lush musical accompaniment.  Of course the live drums and instrumentation may sound less dense than anyone more familiar with the booming drum patterns of drum machines like the 808 and searing keys courtesy of the industry standard Triton and ASR-10 keyboards.  But the key to India.Aire music is subtlety.  The whispering strings on Ready For Love that accompany a smooth, self assured vocal performance and one of the most beautiful lyrical compositions ever written.  The bouncy drum patter and guitar strums of Video (ironically interpolated from the super sexist ode to felatio, Put it in Your Mouth by Akynele) provide an upbeat setting for India's tale self-acceptance in a culture of narrowly define beauty and worth.  The pulsing beat of \\"Nature\\" sounds is hypnotic, fitting for a song in which India is finds herself playing the role seductress and imploring her lover to let his instinct and intuition take over.  And perhaps the most musically intoxicating song of the album is called \\"Simple\\" but its anything but.<br />Not that awards should mean anything to a real artist, but I found it hard to watch India.Aire lose to Alicia Keyes in five different categories at the Grammy's.  I dare any member of ASCAP that voted for Alicia Keys to listen to those two ALBUMS from beginning to end and arrive at the conclusion that Alicia Keys deserved all of the accolades she received.  Perhaps its best that India stays just below the radar of mainstream tastes anyway.  Those of us who are fans of real music will get to have her to ourselves.
0679759328|5.0|Within the exquisitely refined prose of Hotel du Lac, British novelist Anita Brookner illuminates the quest of the human soul through the journey of one apparently meek, middle-aged writer of romance.<br />Encouraged to take some time away in order to come to her senses after committing a rather glaring social faux pas (which just so happens to be a manifestation of genuine truth), Edith Hope sees little to be gained from her exile. Yet, whether enveloped within the solitude of her dreary room or lingering within the company of the hotel's curiously assembled guests, this unassuming heroine finds herself gleaning perspective into the nuances of romantic entanglements while, at the same time, acquiring heart-wrenching insight into the ways of the world.<br />The subtlety with which Brookner so gracefully propels the tale, without question, serves to intensify the profundity and depth of the work upon its conclusion. Indeed, a moment arrives in which the reader holds within her hands not merely an engaging work of contemporary fiction, but a mirror within which she may discover her own illusions revealed.
0316666343|5.0|When my 32-year-old son told me he teared up in places reading this book, I knew it was something special, as he definitely is not the emotional type. I just finished it and have to admit that the sleeves of my t-shirt are still damp from tears that I wiped there in order to be able to see clearly enough to read. To all reviewers who didn't like it, who found it maudlin or boring or unaffecting, I say, &quot;Your antidepressant is working too well and preventing you from experiencing your emotions.&quot; In my humble opinion, this is a gem of a book and is not to be missed by anyone who can still feel.
B00003CXXS|4.0|The special effects in this movie were excellent considering Spielberg opted out on this one.  The first movie made you think that it could really happen. The second was still believable to an extent.  The third movie's storyline had a lot of holes in it. It was really hard for me to believe that even an extremely intelligent pre-teen boy would be able to survive on an island of dinosaurs for several weeks on his own.  However, the movie did offer some pretty good action scenes and the special effects were pretty cool.
6305842442|4.0|I liked the old version, with the so-called &quot;distracting&quot; narration. The narration reminded me of the old film noir classics like Sunset Boulevard, Casablanca, or even tv shows like Magnum P.I. and provided more insight to the character. I liked the old ending better too. After all the night, and rain, you'll finally escape to the green country. However, I did enjoy the effects polish added to the director's cut. A remarkable special effects accomplishment for 1982, and even today.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Does anyone else see the progression in the album titles...Mutations...Sea Change.  I think the Odelay sound, as great as it was, is a thing of the past for Beck.  Mutations was the slowest album Beck produced to that point...Now Sea Change.  Normally a man who never turns a pun, I must say this album is a welcome change.  Midnight Vultures was the most disappointing Beck album for me, because I think I was done with that sound.  I suspect Beck has also grown tired of it.  From the first moment I heard Loser on the radio, I knew there was something different about the song...and the singer was one I had to find.  I had to know who sang that strange song.  I'm glad I did.  I'm glad I've followed this artist incredible progression. Artistic progression is such a beautiful thing to watch when it comes from a mind such as this one.  I wasn't sure if Beck could touch Mutations again...WRONG!!!  He's blown it out of the water.  For the prolific Beck Hansen, it was a long wait for this album, but it was definitely worth it.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I've been seeing a lot more good music lately, but Beck has always been one of my favorite musicians. I love what he's done for music on Mellow Gold, Odelay, and Midnight Vultures, but what I loved most was always Mutations. Sea Change goes beyond Mutations and shows a darker and even more personal side of Beck. This album is so depressing and sedated that it is the most beautiful thing I have heard in a long time. While the lyrics aren't as poetic as on Mutations, they are simple and very real. I find myself going over the lines less in my mind after listening to it (which is not a bad thing, just different than with Mutations, which is the closest comparison I have to offer in his discography), but while I am engrossed in it the words are beautiful and the melodies are rich and haunting. Beck is an amazing musician and I can't get his voice out of my mind. He creates something new and entirely unique with every effort. Easily worth five stars.
0380778556|5.0|Rebecca was one of the best books I've ever read. The feelings of the different characters are described perfectly in this book. The mysteries are breath-taking. Daphne du Maurier made the end perfect. It's a very sad ending, but the story is not finished yet there. Every reader can imagine the very end himself.<br />About the story:<br />After the death of his wife Rebecca, Mr. de Winter goes to Monte Carlo to forget his past. At that time he meets a young lady, marries her and takes her to his home Manderley. But there is one problem in this new marriage, Rebecca who died under mysterious circumstances. The memory of Rebecca ruins the marriage of the new Mrs. de Winter and Maxim de Winter.
B000001DYD|5.0|Careful when you first put this disc in and you can't hear the beginning of the first song because in about a minute, you'll be blasted with Polly's anger. <br />This is an amazing album! Having only heard &quot;Dry&quot; before &quot;Rid of Me&quot; came out. I was disappointed by this album at first. Then I started to get to know the songs and identified with the anger behind a lot of the songs. The songs almost feel like break-up anthems at times, since I listened to this incessantly while I was dealing with a break-up. &quot;50 ft. Queenie&quot; is still a favorite of mine. I guess I can't get the image of Polly prancing around on stage with silver eyelashes singing this song. <br />This is the album where we really get to know Polly. Just when you think you've got an artist's style down, they give you so much more than you thought. This album is where she gives us so much more! You can feel her pain and anger in a lot of the songs. You also feel the raw emotion in every song. <br />You'll sing yourself hoarse with this album, and you'll love every minute of it.
0380778556|4.0|I think the book Rebecca is very good! some passages are a bit boring, but only a bit.<br />You understand what Daphne Du Maurier means and the story is very interesting. You think Maxim did love Rebecca but it wasn't true and you don't know at first what's wrong.<br />In the part of the novel, Daphne Du Maurier made the plot quite thrilling! That was the part for me. The end is a bit sarcastic, but ok!!

0151008116|5.0|If something inexplicable has lured you to this book, purchase it immediately.  If someone suggested that you explore it, please do.  It speaks to the heart and soul with striking depth, yet it provides much laughter.  A beautiful story that doesn't hide behind anything.

0312932081|5.0|I think just about everything that could be said has been said about this book.  It was one of the key books I read during my formative middle school years, and has stuck with me.  Ender and I shared a paranoia based on adverse conditions, and I've loved the little guy ever since.<BR><BR>Great book, excellent plotting, very witty (if sometimes in a school-boyish way) chapter openings, and characters you will probably care about in ways that few other books have ever made you feel.<BR><BR>I recommend all of the other books in the first quartet.  The second quartet, so far, exhibits decreasing quality with each book.  Though everyone who liked _Ender's Game_ should read _Ender's Shadow_.
0316666343|5.0|I go to high school and am the secretary for our's school book club, we recently chose this book as our next big read. Everyone finished it ahead of time, none of us could put it down. We meet each Tuesday to discuss the book and everyone had something to say about everything. This is a very good book that I highly reccomend this book to everyone. If a bunch of highschoolers could get a bunch out of it surely everyone can.
B00006F7S4|5.0|First, to write a review for an album you have to listen to it more than once, anyone who tries to review an album on less than 2 listens is doing a disservice to everyone.<br />Second, if you liked Beck's &quot;Mutations&quot; album, buy this album immediately. If you read the rest of this review, or any other review, you are wasting your time.<br />To really understand this album you should know that this is about Beck's breakup with his longtime girlfriend. Therefore these songs are not happy, but that does not mean they are not beautiful. Beck and his crew do a great a job of building a rich tonal tapestry. Just listen to the backwards tape noises of &quot;Lost Cause&quot;, it feels like your ears are being pulled backwards. Although almost all the songs are slow, but because they all have different structures, sounds and build up the album keeps you engaged. Beck's lyrics are fantastic. &quot;Lonesome Tears&quot; has some very great word play in the chorus:<br />How could this love<BR>Ever turning<BR>Never turn its eye on me<BR>How could this love<BR>Ever changing<BR>Never change the way I feel<br />But the best lyrics, in my opinion, would belogn to &quot;Little One&quot;. Not because the words are particularly strong, but the structure is unconventional. The best way to describe it would be a series of poems with 2-5-8 (although it will stray from this formula) syllable structure, and a break in the middle. Its wonderful.<br />These are probably Beck's best vocals, filled with emotion and range. In fact if you don't get a little emotional when listening to these songs there is probably something wrong with you, maybe you're a robot, or have the sense of a robot.<br />If you want to listen to something sad but beautiful, with a great acoustic/synth blend, check this album out. In my opinion it's a classic. If you try to download the MP3s be warned that a lot of them were taken off beck.com's stream and hence very low quality. The album sounds much better fromthe CD then from the stream. You can still listen to the album on Beck.com, so that's the easier way to preview it, since you'll probably be getting the same quality off peer-to-peer.
0440214041|3.0|This novel is much like the rest of Grisham's works. The character development is good throughout the novel, but the plot remains pretty much the same.  it was the typical struggle between government and the people.  <BR>  Personally, I thought the novel was pretty good.  I do believe he has done better.  I also think that if you've ever seen the movie, and didn't especially like the ending, you should read the book.
B00005YW4H|5.0|One reviewer wrote that the arrangements were lacking.  I simply cannot understand that.  I've been a musician my entire life.  I've played it all from elementary school marches to clasical, with Dixieland, Rock &amp; Roll and Jazz in between.  Personally, I've never had ANY music affect me the way this album has.  Everytime I hear it (and that's daily) I hear something new.<br />It goes without saying that Ms. Jones' voice is second to none.  That wonderful Julie London quality coupled with the seemingly simple yet complex arrangements serve up a sound that nearly defies discription.  EVERYTIME I hear the piano passage in Cold, Cold Heart I'm blown away by her grasp of chord structure.  This woman's only 23 years old, folks!<br />&quot;I've Got To See You Again&quot; ranks as my favorite.  No wait! Maybe it's &quot;Seven Years&quot;.  Or, maybe it's...  Listen. There are 14 cuts on this album and ALL of them are absolute charmers.<br />You simply can't go wrong buying this CD.  You're gonna love it!
B0000542D2|2.0|Not that most of you will care or notice...<br />But the DVD IS presented in \\"fake widescreen,\\" meaning that black bars have been applied to the top and bottom of the picture, actually COVERING UP some of the image.<br />That's why the tops of people's heads are so often chopped off, and in extreme cases, even their eyes aren't visible (see the extreme close-ups during the performance sections of the movie, or the kid watching Ringo at the end of the \\"parading\\" sequence).<br />Don't believe me?  Just compare the full-frame footage in the \\"making of\\" specials to the film itself.  <br />They did this to \\"The Last Waltz,\\" \\"Touch Of Evil,\\" and many other good films, but people don't notice it and the studios keep getting away with it.  If you truly are a Beatles fan, you'll raise a ruckus, because they've marred a truly great movie.
B0000524CY|5.0|I only review the DVD's I buy. If I buy a DVD it has to be good. This movie is classic. I enjoy the added scenes and can't figure out why they werent in the original version. I particularly like the quick flashing ghoulish faces and the highlighted devil/statue scene in the dark bedroom. I very much enjoyed the directors commentary. And as always the widescreen/letterbox format is always the preferable way to view a movie. This one goes on the all time horror classics list.
B00006F7S4|4.0|As a fan of Beck's funkier stuff... I first listened to Sea Change expecting to be a little uninterested. Other reviews I'd read used words like depressed, country, etc...<BR>Upon listen I was quite suprised to hear an extremely lush and warm sound... an understatedly funky groove upon which beck's folky side actualy becomes very dreamy. Accompanied by string arrangements very similar to Serge Gainsbourg's style (one track sounds almost exactly like melody nelson).. Beck Reaffirms himself as the great poplular artist of our generation.
B000068TPN|5.0|I was very impressed with \\"We Were Soldiers\\", the story of the first major conflict between American soldiers and the Vietcong.  The film, written for the screen and directed by Randall Wallace, and starring Mel Gibson in one of his best roles ever, is an unconventional look at war, especially the Vietnam War.  Rejecting the ambiguity and claustrophobic horror of such classics as \\"The Deer Hunter\\" and \\"Platoon\\", it presents an almost worshipful look at the American soldier, sure, but it gives us a reason to label these men heroes.  It is a simple, but poignant, glance into the brotherhood of soldiers as they fight to stay alive in the midst of absolute horror.  \\"We Were Soldiers\\" shows that war is hell, but it doesn't lose itself in it.  The benefit of 30+ years has allowed filmmakers to look back on this horrific period in history with some perspective.  What I like about \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is that it doesn't even attempt to justify our presence in Vietnam, but it vilifies no one.  The Vietcong are presented as men who believe in what they're doing as much as the Americans, if not more.  This might be one of the first films to attempt to provide an objective view of the \\"enemy\\".  It was refreshing; there's been enough propaganda in the media.  I'm tired of being told how to feel about Vietnam.  \\"We Were Soldiers\\" takes the viewer right into the middle of combat, in a manner similar to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Black Hawk Down\\".  The bullets whiz past OUR heads, the screams of the wounded and dying fill OUR ears, the heat of the explosions burns US.  Randall Wallace's direction is very evocative; I found myself trying to slink down like the actors.  Speaking of actors, this film has got some good ones.  Mel Gibson is superb as Col. Hal Moore; he embodied the role like he was born to play it.  Barry Pepper, Greg Kinnear, Chris Klein, and others were similarly outstanding.  I also appreciated the portrait of Army wives; the sequence in which Madeleine Stowe (Moore'swife) and Keri Russell (Chris Klein's wife) hand-deliver death-announcement telegrams to the wives is devastating.  There are some standard war movie cliches in \\"We Were Soldiers\\", but overall, I thought it was an impressive achievement.  My dad, a Vietnam veteran, agreed.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I already had an idea of what this album sounded like through the weekly previews on Beck.com.  Listening to it on the internet does not do this record any justice...It's simply amazing!  My favorite song has to be &quot;Sunday Sun&quot;.  The whole CD is consistent throughout, and more so than other artists these days who release mediocre material with maybe one or two good songs..Beck has proven his genius on this effort.  I can only hope his new direction will inspire a musical revolution, because right now, there's not much else out there that can even come close to a masterpiece such as this..
B00006J3WH|5.0|This CD is without a doubt, one of the best soundtrack Cds out there. I could easily just say that all the songs are wonderful. Here are some of my favorites:<BR>* Going Thru the Motions: this song has powerful vocals that back up some powerful emotions, as do many of the songs on this CD, and it also has the cute lines from the singing vampires that remind you why this show is so funny. The only problem with this song is that its too short!<BR>*Rest In Peace: Ok, so it didnt ever occur to me that Spike was going to, or for that matter could sing. This song is great- kind of rockish, it for some reason reminds me of a Bon Jovi song, in a good way. <BR>* Standing: My love of this song is only helped by the fact that Giles was always my favorite character on the show, and even if he sang an awful song I would probably still like it. But,this is the song which leads up to his decision to leave Buffy and Co. The lyrics are great and its great to see Giles finally express himself. <BR>* Standing/Under Your Spell reprise: Also, really harmonious and a nice mix of a song I love (standing) and the only song that I dont love (Under Your Spell)<BR>* Walk Thru The Fire. This is the big momentous song that all musicals have that kind of brings together all the characters  singing different lyrics at the same time, and it just works so well.  The lyrics on this song are the most poignant, for everyone, and everyones vocals just sound great combined. <BR> Other songs:Where do we go from here?,Ill Never Tell and Something to Sing About. (also, the demo Something to sing about, sung by Joss Whedon's wife is pretty good!)<br />And dont think: Ok this person is a Buffy freak, she only likes the CD becuase of Buffy,its not true. I ocassionally watch Buffy and am a music freak. I love this CD becuase of the lyrics and honest passion of it. Buy it!
0451191153|3.0|I had a mixed reaction to the book. On the one hand, I find the Objectivist philosophy to be fascinating. I was especially drawn to Howard Roark's determination to live life on his own terms--to be himself. This is one of the hardest things to do in life, and yet one of the most valuable. I am reminded of the quote by a MacArthur Foundation \\"genius grant\\" winner who said that \\"your own karma badly lived is better than another person's karma lived well.\\" Additionally, I like the resolute opposition to forms of collectivism, including fascism and socialism/communism that Rand made part of her work. <br />There are, of course, certain parts of the ideology with which I disagree. While I highly prize and value individualism, I sometimes got the feeling that Rand advocated the Balkanization of society--her individualism seemed that rampant to me. Additionally, I could never be an Objectivist, simply because I believe in the existence of God, and it is a belief that I have rationalized, and not just taken on faith. Perhaps I am just the latest person to accept the terms of Pascal's Wager, but in any event, my religious beliefs would conflict with Objectivism. I could never be Howard Roark--a man who was practically born without a religious brain center, according to Rand's own notes on the novel. Finally, I have some scorn for Objectivism's disdain for all things traditional and classical. I think it is fine if a Howard Roark wants to challenge tradition. But to entirely dismiss it altogether, as he does with architectural traditions and classical designs, is arrogant in the extreme. Tradition and the classics persevere not because they are sacred cows, but because they have survived centuries of trial and error. This is a fact Rand does not appear to appreciate. <br />I also could never be Roark because, quite frankly, he struck me as being the world's biggest jerk. He was flippant and dismissive of people who disagreed with him in the slightest, and since his was a decidedly minority opinion on life, his flippancy affected most people. I know that is how Rand drew the character, but I still found it off-putting. And then, of course, there is Roark's approach to romance, which . . . let's just say, is somewhat unorthodox. Rand was able to achieve the desired effect with other characters--I despised Toohey, was puzzled and dazzled by Dominique, saw Wynand as a tragic figure, and I think that Peter Keating is nothing short of pathetic. But Roark just struck me as an unlovable figure. And I don't understand how he suddenly achieves respect later on in the book, after being scorned at the beginning. No one really changes in their thinking about him. No one adopts his philosophy (at least not successfully). It is almost as if Rand has decided that Roark has done his penance, and should now achieve acclaim. <br />The other problem I had with the book is that Rand is a bad writer. At least in my view. I found her to have a tin ear for dialogue, and an even worse ear for inner monologue. Her characters struck me as being wooden and unreal. I would have given anything for some colloquialisms--which almost none of the characters seemed capable of. The dialogue and monologues appeared contrived, and made me roll my eyes several times. On a specific matter--and perhaps this is just the lawyer in me objecting (no double pun intended)--the courtroom scenes were entirely unrealistic, which annoyed me to no end. Also annoying was the fact that Rand appeared to set up two separate straw men--the Objectivist one, and the Collectivist one--and decided to knock one of them down. Her universally Manichean approach is something I don't agree with. <br />I suppose that the thing to bear in mind is that this is more a book about a philosophy than it is about a story. But I think that a philosophical work doesn't work when applied to a real life setting. I think that Rand's style of writing would apply more to a science fiction story, which is why I wouldbe interested in reading \\"Anthem.\\" I'm also more than willing to give \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" a chance as well, despite the fact that it is not science fiction. But I just think that this story had problems as a result of being applied to a real world setting. <br />All in all, I would recommend people to read \\"The Fountainhead,\\" if they haven't already. But proceed with caution.
0385503954|3.0|A very well written book with interesting characters.  The ending was a huge disappointment.  The last chapters rushed through too much time trying to find an ending.  Not as good as the hype.
0671024256|5.0|What I didn't know about writing could fill volumes, and it did. This fast paced reader on the pitfalls of writing pleasantly surprised me. Steven King of horror genre fame draws us in with funny stories about his childhood writing through his ascent to the heavenly kingdom hall of fame of the B novelists, and  lurks behind the drapes ready to cut the unsuspecting novice writer with a few points on scary things like grammar,(aaargh!)style, (oooh!)and work habits (oowch).<br />Steven King's fame is well deserved. As a storyteller he is top notch. It was a real pleasure to glimpse the workings of his creative mind as he uses a few simple word combinations to open up the reader's movie reel of imagination.  There are points where he tells you to watch and then does that magical telepathy thing before your eyes.  How does he do it? Read and find out.<br />And I haven't even read any of his other books yet.
B000002JS8|5.0|This is, as some of the other reviewers said, probably one of -- of not THE -- greatest albums by this hard-hitting metal band. There's not a single bad song on here ... a few that I like less than the others (for ex., \\"Night Prowler\\", though a good song in its own right, hits too close to home for me). But the great, classic tunes of \\"Highway to Hell,\\" \\"Girl's Got Rhythm,\\" \\"Touch too Much\\" and more prove the timelessness of AC/DC. This album is a MUST HAVE. AC/DC had a few good albums, in my opinion, after this one. But I never did care a whole lot for a lot of what they released in the 90s.
B00006IX0R|4.0|(I'm sorry about my english, I don't know a lot).<br />Well, this album is very good, the songs in it are the best of all. Some of then have been cutted (for example &quot;Hollywood&quot;), but they are still great. I hope you read this little review and think in bought this increible disc, don't miss the chance!
B00006AG5N|4.0|I'll take away a star for the fact that it's been remixed drastically. Personally, I like the mixes for the most part but it will certainly disturb the purist. I have all these songs elsewhere but I will purchase this for the different mixes used &amp; besides where else are you going to find 30 great Elvis cuts on 1 single CD (31 if you include the bonus remake A LITTLE LESS CONVERSATION). In response to the critic who gave this 1 star: WAKE UP INDEED! I love Berry, Holly, Richard, JB, The Stones,The Beatles, Dylan &amp; yes Elvis. Anyone who thinks that Elvis was just a singer is not listening. If you want to argue the fact that Elvis wasn't a great songwriter. So what! The delivery is what made Elvis so unique. He's an interpreter, much in the vein of say-Frank Sinatra. I'm sure you'll find fault with Ol' Blue Eyes too. Oh well, some people just don't get it. The rest of America is wide awake enough to compensate for the Elvis sleepers. Afterall, 50,000,000 Elvis fans can't be wrong!
B00006AG5N|5.0|Any singer who had 31 hit songs in the top 100 would be considered successful.  Any singer who had 31 hit songs in the top 40 would be phenomenal.  Any singer who had 31 hit songs that reached number #1 could only be Elvis Presley.  The purity of Elvis' voice and clarity of the music is evident from the first song, \\"Heartbreak Hotel,\\" which was released in 1956.  Every song sounds better than ever before, whether it's the acoustic guitar on \\"Love Me Tender\\" or the electric guitar and Dixieland band on \\"Hard Headed Woman.\\"  Only Elvis could follow the rocking \\"(You're The) Devil In Disguise\\" with the gospel song \\"Crying In The Chapel\\" and have both songs reach #1.  The live version of \\"The Wonder Of You\\" included here differs slightly from the familiar version, but is equally great.  The 2002 remix version of \\"A Little Less Conversation\\" brings Elvis into the 21st century and closes out this compilation.  With this CD clocking in at nearly 80 minutes, you literally could not ask for more.
B000068TPN|5.0|Talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time... These poor guys were in a world of hurt from the time the hit the ground.<br />This is a really good film. The authenticity and attention to detail are phenominal. All the way from the French in 1956 up through the actual battle that US 7th Cavalary was in. Wow! <br />The attention to the detail of how the soldier's wives had to cope with the deaths. It must have been a terrible time. The US Army did not handle it well.<br />395 American GIs against 4,000+ North Vietnam regulars. These weren't the Viet Cong that you normally see in films. The regulars were well equipped and well trained. Their officers knew the ways of war. This particular NVA officer had been in nearly constant battle since the Japanese occupation in the 1940's.<br />Gibson and Elliot were superb in their roles as the two American leaders. I can't imagine going into battle knowing that you only have airlift capability for 60 soldiers at a time and having a 30 - 40 minute gap between air drops. One sustained firefight and you would burn through all your ammo... If you were wounded right when you jumped out of the chopper, it could be more than 90 minutes before you were evacuated. Nothing good about that...<br />The first 40 minutes was introducing the characters and showing you how the unit was trained. This was America's first \\"Air Mobile\\" unit. New tactics and doctrines. This was the first major battle in the Vietnam Conflict. Once the unit hit the ground, the battle was on. The whole rest of the film concentrates on the battle. No let up in the action. <br />I watched the DVD. Plenty of excellent special features on this one. The section on the makeing of the film was especially interesting. Interviews with the survivors, how they created the battlefield, the weapons involved, the aircraft, the explosions... Very good. The director spent a lot of time getting it right. The veterans seemed to be satisfied with the accuracy. Other special features included director's commentary, deleted scenes, movie trailers.<br />But, when it all said and done, you don't walk away from this film feeling good. It was a major battle. Both sides declared it a victory. Neither side stayed and held onto the ground. A lot of men died. A lot of brutal close up in your face fighting. It was filmed in the same style as \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and A&E's \\"The Lost Battalion\\".
B00006AG5N|5.0|Being an Elvis fan from the beginning, and a collector of sorts - I hesitated to buy this CD because I already had this music. But this is all NEW! The sound is unsurpassed - clear and crisp, and so refreshing. Hearing this, you will know in your heart, if you didn't know it already - this man, these sounds - is how it all started. If you care about Rock n' Roll and it's history, if you ever wondered if Elvis Presley was really all they said he was - just relax and turn up the sound... and listen.
031286504X|5.0|there can not be enough praise for this book.. Richard Matheson is a genius... there probably isnt very many people that could write a book that is almost entirely based around one character and it still be interesting. Robert Neville- is the last man on earth.. in my opinion there is nothing about this book that should have been changed it is absolutly amazing, and the ending to it is great also... it has a few sad parts in it, the movie adaptation of the book known as &quot;the last man on earth&quot; starring vincent price is also as good as the book is.. Vincent Price is the perfect person for the part.. So if you havent had a chance to read the book but have seen the movie you should definatly check it out.. and vice versa.... If you havent had the chance to see the movie or read the book I highly recommend that you do so...
B00005B6NC|5.0|I will admit the only reason I rented this movie was because Vin Diesel is in it. So when I watched it I was plesantly surprised that it was a great movie. It's about a starship that crashes on an unknown planet with very few survivors, Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel) an escaped murderer, Caroline Fry (Radha Mitchell) the flight something or other, she's like a piliot, and Johns ( Cole Hauser) a \\"cop\\" who is bringing Riddick back to jail, along a little kid named Jack, (don't know the actor) who becomes Riddicks shadow and look-a-like. They are all trying to survive on this planet with three suns, when they find out that their is going to be a total eclipse which means that the creatures living in  the dark can come out and there is no place to hide.<BR>My favorite scenes were actually between Riddick and Jack, they were quite funny, and between Riddick and Fry, quite a bit of sexual tension going on their. In the end you find yourself cheering for the murderer, enjoying him take on as many of the creatures as possible, and to quote riddick , \\"It did not know who it was F&cking with.\\" I made all of my friends watch this movie and they all loved it. It is not exactly scary like can't sleep for days, it's just very entertaining. If you have surround sound I definately suggest it for this movie!
B000063UR2|5.0|Awesome!!!<br />I saw this movie when I was a kid, and loved it! Now that I saw the director's cut version, I remember why I liked Legend. It has beautiful landscapes and scenary, very much like in fairie tales. It's like a mixture of The Lord of the rings with Dragonlance and the Arthurian legends. It has unicorns, goblins, witches, dwarves, elves, fairies, and magic stuff. Tom Cruise did a good job (not his best), and Darkness (Tim Curry) was incredible!!! That guy was terrifying!!!<br />Good job, Ridley Scott. Five stars are not enough for you on this one!
B00006AG5N|5.0|This CD covers a great variety of styles and music. The songs sound refreshed due to the enhanced technology. It brings Elvis back and shows why he was the Entertainer of the Century. One can feel the pulsating bass line in &quot;Hound Dog&quot;; the electrying &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;; the touching, crisp and clean stereo sound of &quot;In The Ghetto&quot;; and incredible &quot;Suspicious Mind&quot;; the upbeat tempo of &quot;Burning Love&quot;, and the one of a kind bass voice found in exciting &quot;Way Down&quot; provided by Elvis's back-up vocal colleague. This CD has it all. Plenty of music for all taste and emotions. A C.D. worth adding to your collection.
B000001Y2U|5.0|If you thought Smells Like Children was scary youve been sheltered for far too long.Antichrist is the real deal with real songs with great music to back it up.Smells Like Children I admit is one of the best EPs Ive heard but its just an EP.This a full length extravaganza of nihilisim and animosity.The songs come one after the other perfectly.However it is not better than Mechanical Animals. Mechanical Animals is sleazy and rebellious but its a lot different than ACS so dont compare them.Theyre too different from each other.Man That You Fear is very spooky slightly depressing and singalongable.All the tracks feature great vocals,most feature muscular guitars and all feature a distinct mood.This an A plus record a perfect 10 out of 10.
B00006BTCA|4.0|When co-workers ask me to briefly describe Interpol, I can only come up with &quot;If Joy Division and the Chameleons had a baby raised in NYC by Radiohead.&quot; Not too original, but then again this is an album that bristles with an energy not heard since alternative became mainstream and boys with skinny ties became a footnote in rock history. The Joy Division comparisons are inevitable, sure, but Interpol goes beyond the predictable angst-ridden lyrics and droning bassline to create something new out of something admittingly old. Don't get me wrong, some of these songs (like &quot;Untitled&quot;) are extremely heart-wrenching, but without being maudlin. As a JD and Chameleons fan, I appreciate the soaring guitar on &quot;Obstacle 1&quot; and &quot;Roland&quot; kinda reminds me of JD's &quot;Tranmission&quot;. Overall, a stunning record that will outlast the early 80s kitsch kraze of the moment (Hives, Strokes, etc.)
B00006F7S4|4.0|While some cds are like friends you can cry to this one is one that cries to you. This really sounds like me these past few weeks.Why is Beck so sad?Thats what everyone is asking.Maybe someone passed away or broke up with him or whatever.Whatever it is this cd is great because its one you can cry along with.You actually feel much better afterwords.
0783239955|5.0|I came in on the middle of this film on HBO one afternoon while flipping through channels.  I paused for a moment, got hooked, and spent the next hour laughing like a crazed fool.  This is perhaps the funniest movie I have seen in the past decade.  When you think it can't get any worse for the main character, or any funnier, it does!  Having missed the first 30 minutes on HBO, I rushed out to buy the DVD, and have enjoyed watching this film again and again.  It's PG-13, namely because of a few bad words and some content dealing with adultery.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis once told Sam Phillips, of Sun Records, &quot;I don't sound like anybody&quot;. That was true then and it remains true today.<br />The remastering of these songs, many of them classics in the genre, is one of the most exciting ideas in music today. The sound quality is astounding. Every song sounds clearer, richer,and bassier.Most noticeably on &quot;Burning Love&quot;. Play the version that's on 101 different CD's and then play this version. You'll never want to listen to any other version than this remastered gem. Try this with any of the 29 other remastered songs, and you run the risk of never wanting to listen to any Elvis release other than ELV1S 30 #1 Hits.  Plus you get the newest #1 hit for Elvis, the remastered &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; remix.<br />Many people will not give this new release a moment's thought. That would be a big mistake. There's great music on this CD that anyone who loves music should have in their collection.  Certainly every Elvis fan already owns all these songs on several different CD's, tape or even vinyl, but nothing with the sound quality of this release, it's a must-have for the music lover or the Elvis fan.
B00006F7S4|5.0|&quot;The darker depressed brother of Beck's Mutations album&quot;, is probably what i'd tell people if they asked me what this CD is like. I've been highly anticipating the release of this CD. Beck returning to Mutations territory? I'm there. Beck reteaming with producer Nigel Godrich, i'm there and first in line! The genius producer behind Radiohead's OK Computer, Kid A, and Amnesiac. He adds breathaking orchestrations as well as his signature bleeps and warbles to what would of otherwise been an average Country/Folk acoustic set of songs. Listeners who like Beck's Odelay and Midnite Vultures CD's but don't care for Mutations should definitely pass on this one. But if you're a fan of Radiohead, Nick Drake and Alternative Country, you will love this. &quot;Round the Bend&quot; is obviously a clone of Nick Drake, from the whispering vocals, the acoustic guitar, to the strings. Being a huge fan of Drake i was a little annoyed at first that he would blatantly copy Drake, but the song is so good that i forgive him.Mutations is one of my favorite CDs of all time, but Sea Change is right up there. Who knows, after repeated listens and a lot of time has passed, i might just have to say that Sea Change is even better.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney Spears made a fantastic return in November 2001 with her third album, titled simply Britney. After a few months out of the spotlight, Britney stole the show at the MTV Video Music Awards 2001 in New York with her classic performance of the massive hit I'm A Slave 4 U. She didn't win any awards, but stole the show with her controversial performance and raw sex appeal. On November 6th 2001, Britney Spears released her third album. It went straight to No.1 in the US shifting more than 745,000 copies in its first week on sale. It didn't sell as many as her previous album, Oops!...I Did It Again, but it was still the fastest selling female album of 2001 - beating off competition from Destiny's Child and Janet Jackson. It has so far sold 12 million copies worldwide! I would say that Britney is definetly Britney's best album to date, because there is a huge improvement in the songs and she sounds a lot more mature...<br /><br />The album begins with \\"I'm A Slave 4 U.\\" This saucy slice of pop/R'n'B was the first single to be taken from the album in October 2001 where it peaked at No.4 in the UK. The video is absolutely phenomenal - very steamy! I'm A Slave 4 U is by far Britney's best single to date as far as creative genius goes. The trippy bassline is supplied with breathy vocals and a drippy beat that makes for one of the most infectious songs of 2001. The critics loved the song, but the fans didn't like it that much. \\"Overprotected\\" was the second single to be taken from Britney in January 2002 where it peaked again at No.4 in the UK. Britney goes back to her trademark pop roots with this classic Britney track - remeniscent of Oops!...I Did It Again, Stronger and (You Drive Me) Crazy. \\"Lonely\\" is a funky R'n'B number and was a hot contender as the final single to be taken from this album, but was changed at the last minute for \\"I Love Rock 'N' Roll.\\" This is a fiery girl-power track about how Britney is through with her man and getting on with her life - a lot like \\"Don't Go Knockin' On My Door\\" from the previous album. \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" is, in my opinion, Britney's best ballad to date. The lyrics are beautiful and the song suits her voice so much. A lot of girls could relate to this song, and it was released a few days after Crossroads came out at the cinemas. Britney was also huge in the British tabloids after \\"snubbing fans\\" at the UK premiere of the film. All this press attention saw the single peak at No.2 in the UK in April 2002. \\"Boys\\" is up next. This is the album version of Boys, not the CO-ED Remix feat. Pharell Williams of the Neptunes, like in the video. This version isn't as good, but is still great. Along with I'm A Slave 4 U, it's the hottest song on the album! \\"Anticipating\\" is a disco influenced number that sees Britney getting ready for a night on the town! The lyrics aren't amazing, but the beat is catchy - you'll be bopping your head in no time! \\"I Love Rock 'N' Roll\\" will be the final single to be taken from Britney in November 2002 in the UK. This cover is good but not her best.<br /><br />The album continues on a high note with \\"Cinderella.\\" This is another classic Britney pop song, very similar to her early stuff and was written by the pop wizard Max Martin, but sounds almost identical to \\"Stronger.\\" \\"Let Me Be\\" is a trippy R'n'B song that sounds a lot like something Aaliyah (R.I.P.) would have done. It has a great bassline with some good lyrics. Only problem? It's too short! \\"Bombastic Love\\" is next. This is another short song, but is still excellent - very corny, but good! \\"That's Where You Take Me\\" is a rather sicky mid-tempo ballad. Everything's going great, until Britney starts going, \\"La, la, la, la, la\\" in her baby-like voice! \\"When I Found You\\" is another mid-tempo pop ballad. At the start, it has a sort of swirly beat, if that makes sense! This is a big improvement on the previous song - things can't get any better, can they?! \\"Before The Goodbye\\" is such a fantastic song and would be perfect in the Eurovision Song Contest! The dance influence makes a welcome change from the brilliant, but familiar R'n'B sound. The lyrics are good (Britney wrote them herself) and she really does sell the song from the bottom of her heart. \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\" is the final song. This song was written by Britney's ex-boyfriend, Justin Timberlake and her choreographer/stage designer Wade Robson. Britney has a great voice on this song, but Justin is a rubbish songwriter - it has to be said!<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 8/10<br /><br />Without a doubt, Britney is Britney's best album to date. Britney Spears is the fastest selling female artist of all-time, shifting close to 60 million albums, 30 million singles and 10 million videos in the space of 4 years! She's gotta be doing something right! I don't really care what people think of Britney. I know I love her music and her and that's all that matters to her millions and millions of fans all across the world. People keep on saying Britney is going down the pan, but she never will. She's made too big of an impact on the world to slip away quietly. Trust me, she'll be around for quite some time to come. Buy Britney now from Amazon - it'll leave you desperate for more.

B00000J7I3|5.0|This was Motley's best record. They were the best classic style metal band to come out since Van Halen in '78. I first heard them in '82. Classic heavy metal. This is full of some of the best drumming and riffs in metal history. Tommy Lee used a cow bell with his drumming(?!) Mick Mars is a very underated guitarist. He is better then Joe Perry. Vince Neil is yet another example of the classic metal frontman. If you like Van Halen, KISS, Ozzy, AC/DC, and classic metal in general, you will love Motley. I don't hear the punk in this that some people seem to notice. Classic!
0743201140|5.0|Now, Discover Your Strengths goes beyond just strength finding. After reading the book and completing my own Profile, I found the profile to be so accurate it was almost frightening.  The concepts in the book teach you how to focus on the positive and improve yourself.  As I begin graduate work, this book gave me insight as to the specific direction I should go. This concept is also currently being put to test in two colleges in the U.S. The &quot;Strengthsquest&quot; text takes the next step in aiding incoming college students to discover their strengths, develop them as part of their 4 year college career and use them in selecting a field of study.  All of this is a result of Now, Discover Your Strengths.  My son attends one of those colleges, and we now know why he does the thing he does.  We know his top five strengths and he knows mine and my wife's.  Strengthsfinder goes beyond business and can be used in every endeavor we undertake; our marriage, home, church and other relationships.  For those who have read the book and feel slighted, review your strengths and you will know why you felt slighted.  Also, sign up for Gallup's e-mail service at the Strengthsfinder web-sight and you will get plenty of information to continue to use and develop your strengths.  I also recommend reading Now, Soar with Your Strengths.
B0000639IJ|2.0|I think Michael Mann forgot to have something happen in this movie. This film is about 120 minutes of slow-motion training shots, 20 minutes of actual boxing and 20 minutes of actual story. Muhammad Ali is an interesting person with a fascinating story, so why only tell part of it? Why stop after he returns to the ring? You've given the movie no real ending or closure. Aside from this, the performances are great. Will Smith is at his best as Ali and John Voight is wonderful as Cosell. I just wish there was more fist in &quot;Ali's&quot; punch.
B00003CXAE|4.0|Having owned this movie on video years ago, I was always irritated about the orange fleshtones, but now &quot;Grease&quot; finally looks good on DVD with accurate fleshtones, some reviewers under me have complained about this movie not having more extras, have they not noticed the double-dip ploy that Paramount is doing, not to worry, they will re-release it in a year or so with all the added goodies, just look at what they are now doing with the &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies, anyway, this is a standard DVD,Paramount usually is not a studio that goes the extra mile, but &quot;Grease&quot; looks good, its &quot;Widescreen&quot; is the one to get, I was really impressed, thi is the movie that made John Travolta, although the case is somewhat different, I suspect &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; will be the keep case, as will &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;&gt;(I hope), this is a timeless classic that almost makes you yearn for the good ole' days of the 50's (a much simpler time), &amp; I can say it was worth the wait, although Paramount was the last studio to support DVD, they have finally gotten their act together after dragging their feet the past 4 years, every movie by them except &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; seems to be making their way to DVD.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This release is truly an amazing sample of Elvis's god-given talent.  It gives you the feeling you are sitting there listening to the MAN in person again. Absolutely fantastic sound and quality.  A must-have for all fans.  Thanks, BMG!!  Thanks, Amazon.com!!!
B00000J2L8|5.0|Being born in 1980, I am just old enough to remember the Cold War.  I remember the controversy over the arms race, the talk about the iron curtain, and Ronald Reagan's speeches about the \\"evil empire\\".  Stanley Kubrick's inspired black comedy is one of the funniest, and cleverest films ever to come out of that period.  Made two years after the Cuban missile crisis and one year before American entry into the Vietnam War, \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" effectively satirizes anti-Communism, the arms race, and the potential for nuclear holocaust.  Just because the Cold War has ended doesn't make this film any less relevent.  Just look at the standoff between India and Pakistan.<br />Convinced that Communists are contaminating our bodily fluids, General Jack D. Ripper orders an all out nuclear assault on the Soviet Union.  Ripper has his army base sealed off and tells his men to shoot at anyone who comes near it.  Since the pilots of the planes carrying out the assault are ordered not to listen to the radio, the planes cannot be contacted.  What Ripper does not realize is that the Soviets have just developed a new nuclear weapon called the Doomsday Machine.  If the nuclear assault is carried out, then the world will be enveloped in a nuclear holocaust.  It's up to President Merkin Muffley and his staff to find a way to recall the planes before it's too late.<br />Peter Sellers gives a tour-de-force performance in a triple role as the hapless Captain Mandrake, the bumbling president, and the crazed ex-Nazi Dr. Strangelove.  Sellers is so good at immersing in the roles with his looks and accents, that you may not even realize that it's the same actor.  Sellers was originally going to have a fourth role as Major T.J. Kong, but Slim Pickens did a commendable job.  The dimwitted hillbilly Kong almost seems cheerful with his role with bombing the Soviets.  His final scene riding the bomb is priceless.<br />I loved Sterling Hayden's characterization of General Ripper.  Ripper seems to havebeen conceived from a right-wing nightmare, with his prominent cigar and his speeches floridation and loss of essence.  Locked in the same room as him, Captain Mandrake must put up with the thoroughly insane Ripper holding his head between his hands.  I also loved George C. Scott's performance as General Buck Turgidson (a name that suits him well).  Although on the side of the good guys, Turgidson is only slightly less crazed then Ripper and can't help but express admiration over Ripper's actions.<br />Some immortal scenes include Muffley's phone conversation explaining the situation to the Soviet premier (\\"You see Dimitri, one of my men went a little funny in the head...\\"), a soldier's battle with the coca-cola machine, and Turgidson's scuffle with the Russian Ambassador (\\"I caught him taking pictures of the big board!\\").<br />I agree with Roger Ebert's comments that the final scenes end a bit uncertainly.  Strangelove's struggling with his iron hand is amusing, but it doesn't really go anywhere.  However, there is at least one amusing moment as the Russian ambassador finally gets to take his pictures of the big board.  Then the film cuts to apocalyptic shots of the world being engulfed in a nuclear cloud.  Never has such a grim subject matter made for such humorous fare.

B00005RYL2|5.0|I am reviewing the Director's Cut of this DVD. The film his added scenes, and greatly enhanced surround sound (very muy bueno). Don't bother with the Immortal Editon. It has nothing to offer.<br />So here we go. The 16th century collides with modern day. Good vs Evil, with immortals. Could it get any better!!! The cinetography is superb in its darkness, the soundtrack is great (Queen), and the editing is tight. There is enough swordplay between the Immortals to keep a samurai glued to the screen.<br />When this film came out, it was the cutting edge of sci-fi/ incorporated rock sound track. Christopher Lambert burst into this film as a soft-eyed hero, and there is immediate empathy to the character. He plays a Scot from the 16th century who discovers he is immortal. Unfortunately, the rest of the immortals are trying to kill each other for `The Prize', which is undisclosed until the final moments of the film. Throughout the movie, you `feel' his sadness at being immortal, and outliving those he loved. Unfortunately Lambert accepted roles in too many B films later on. But I still like the guy.<br />The film does a great job of connecting modern day events to the past with flashbacks, ending a New York scene with a rise in the camera angle into ancient Scotland as if you are on an elevator emerging from the earth. Very nice touch, an effect I have yet to see since. The Scottish clan battles set in the 16th century are pre-Braveheart, yet realistic.  In the DVD I have, there are replaced scenes of `McCloud episodes' through history.<br />Along with fairly decent (for the time) special effects, you have a most excellent villian in The Kurgan (Clancy Brown...and where did HE go). He plays the role with virve, and a bit of humor (modern day, he kills another immortal, stabs a vigillante, and steals a car. In the car is an old woman. He calmly turns to her and says \\"MOM?\\"...singing `New York New York after he kidnaps the heroine...)) His role is so impressive, in a way, you he steals the movie.<br />A nice treat is Sean Connery as another immortal who trains Connor McCloud in the art od swordsmanship (which, by the way, was actually played by the actors, and very well choreographed). Bad part is he plays a 16th century Spaniard, who is actually Egyptian, and has a British accent. Still, he adds a very real touch of class even though he is only in the film for fifteen minutes.<br />There isn't a better example of Good vs Evil in a sci-film (okay, maybe The Matrix). Like my other reviews, I refuse to ruin the movie or the ending with an easy give-away. (okay, the final scenes are SUPERB swordplay and the hero wins...sorry. had to do it).<br />As to the soundtrack. You can't beat Queen for feeling and being in touch with the scene. There isn't a soul who has seen this film who cannot feel the pain and agony of loss (set 16th century Scotland) as Connor McCloud's wife, Blossom, grows old and dies to Queen's `Who Wants To live Forever'.<br />You who have seen this film will want the Director's Cut. You who haven't, well, trust me, you'll want it too.u he steals the movie.<br />A nice treat is Sean Connery as another immortal who trains Connor McCloud in the art od swordsmanship (which, by the way, was actually played by the actors, and very well choreographed).

B00005A0N5|5.0|I bought Nightwish for the gorgeous cover...the woman in white, floating in the sea, with the owl over her, and an eye with the world swirling in its center...there was something about it that looked like there was a real story behind it.  And I love stories.<br />I was a little nervous, popping it in--I had never heard of the band before, and didn't have even the vaguest notion of what sort of music they did.  (At that point, I wasn't even really sure if the band was called &quot;Nightwish&quot; or &quot;Oceanborn.&quot;) Well, it only took ten seconds to hook me.  The sheer energy of Tarja's voice and the instrumental sequences were like nothing I'd ever heard before.  &quot;Oceanborn&quot; didn't leave my stereo for about a month.<br />All of the tracks are flawless, but I would particularly recommend 'Passion and the Opera,' 'Stargazer,' and 'Moondance.'  From here, you may want to go on to &quot;Angels Fall First,&quot; &quot;Wishmaster,&quot; and &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away.&quot;  Nightwish's latest, &quot;Century Child,&quot; is another stunning work, but it is a little removed from what they'd done previously.  There's more of a concept to it...although the cover of 'Phantom of the Opera' is incredible.
B0000524CY|4.0|The Exorcist has a most unique story as far as demon possession goes. It's not exactely the scariest movie of all time but it does keep you glued to the screen for most of the movie. For a demonic film, there is not much violence to speak of at all. This film might scare little kids but teens and adults will find it interesting.
B00006AG5N|5.0|What a great CD. The song selection is great. The new sound quality is remarkable. A must have.

B000063K2W|4.0|I saw this movie for the first time a year ago and had to get it on DVD. Even though it was done over 60 years ago, the lines are sharp and funny - I laughed so hard watching it, and my boyfriend (who I had to force at first to watch) loved it too! Joan Crawford and Rosalind Russell steal the show, Crawford's last line in the movie is classic! It is really a great piece of filmaking, and an outstanding example of what good screenwriting can be!

0316666343|4.0|The whole concept of this book is original and purely delightful.  It will make you laugh, it will make you cry.  It will make you wonder about life and death in a way that can be very comforting. You will definitely feel for this young girl as she speaks to us from her heaven. I don't want to give any of the story away in this review, so if you are up for something interestingly original then read The Lovely Bones.
B00005LOUS|2.0|Before I went to the theater to see this movie I heard on the radio that this movie was going to be &quot;the next Wizard of Oz&quot;, but it wasn't! I enjoyed it a little bit, but haven't cared to see it again. Co-star Taylor Momsen makes a very unconvincing Cindy Lou Who. She should've won a Golden Raseberry Award for 'worst supporting actress' or something. Jim Carry is kind of funny but not as cruel and bitter as the Grinch in the cartoon. I'd rather stick with the Wizard of Oz than this. But everyone has a right to their own opinion. Rent it first. Then decide on whether or not you wish to by this.
B00006AG5N|5.0|For lifelong fans as well as newcomers, this is the CD to get. Elvis has never sounded better. While this would be a perfect addition to your existing collection; it would also be a great way to introduce the man and his music to everyone else. I have purchased several copies to do just that.
B0000524CY|5.0|Simply put, the scariest movie ever made, and it's actually the only scary movie. This was excellent! Great acting, great plot, great dialogue, and REAL scares. The best of all of them. The only other movie I could consider scary is The Evil Dead (Part 1) Buy this now! This is how reality horror should be done. Yes this is based on a true story. Buy this and the biographey about it. The ultimate scary movie. Don't have your expectations to high, like most movie you go see. Use your imagination as well, and put yourself in the characters shoes. This isn't gore, gore, gore, it has a story, likeable characters that you care about, and amazing acting. Buy this, you won't regret it!
B000002ULO|4.0|Listening to Paul McCartney records since 1984 is eerily like listening to your best friend talk about that one field goal he got in high school.  Each year the story sounds a bit more tired, and each year the telling seems to get a little more embellished.<br />It started with &quot;Give My Regards to Broad Street&quot; and its watered-down reworkings of a few Beatle songs, continued through his Beatles-hits-packed tours, his change-location-in-every-interview enthusiasm in the &quot;Anthology&quot; series, and finally into &quot;Flaming Pie&quot;.  The result of this Lennon-pegged title is the closest to a &quot;Beatles&quot; album any of the ex-Beatles ever produced.<br />On &quot;Pie&quot;, Paul seems very aware of his legacy, as opposed to his usual stance of merely claiming ownership, so the tracks are fairly intricate and fun.  Several Beatle tricks are used throughout - many first verses also double as songs' last verse, not unlike the Fabs' early days, the strings, the odd, nearly avant garde pieces, George Martin and Ringo Starr hoevering in the back - to fine effect, notably on the tracks featuring Jeff Lynne's able-bodied production.  There's even some ex-Beatle tricks used... John's &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;, churned through &quot;Let Me Roll It&quot;, buffered with some mid-uptempo Harrison-esque strumming gets you &quot;The World Tonight,&quot; McCartney's most convincing rocker in years - possibly decades.  On top of that, there's even a rave-up of the &quot;Anthology&quot; version of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, called &quot;Really Love You&quot;.<br />Several other songs stand impressively, if more so for their structure and care than their sheer brilliance as songs.  &quot;Somedays&quot;, &quot;Calico Skies&quot;, &quot;Souvenir&quot;, &quot;Little Willow&quot; and &quot;Heaven on a Sunday&quot; are beautifully crafted tracks.  Paul was derided a bit for waving the magic wand of love too readily on this album; in retrospect, with his wife slowly losing her life, &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; is a brilliant testament to their love and their lives (there is, as implied above, a &quot;flipping through a photo album&quot; feel to the disc).<br />Still, by so vociferously claiming the Beatles legacy (and cheerfully allowed to do so by Ringo and George), Paul winds up being his own victim.  As bland as some critics have dubbed efforts like &quot;Venus &amp; Mars&quot;, &quot;At the Speed of Sound&quot; and &quot;McCartney II&quot;, at least none of those recordings relied almost exclusively on the 'Beatle' sound.  &quot;Flaming Pie&quot;'s strength - and ironically, its weakness - is just that.sing her life, &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; is a brilliant testament to their love and their lives (there is, as implied above, a &quot;flipping through a photo album&quot; feel to the disc).  <br />Still, by so vociferously claiming the Beatles legacy (and cheerfully allowed to do so by Ringo and George), Paul winds up being his own victim.

B00006F7S4|2.0|I don't know what everyone is raving about, honestly. Sure, it sounds all soft and mellow like a good Air record, with some Nick Drake mixed in there somewhere. . .but why not just listen to those artists' records? The lyrics are trite, the songs are boring, and the reason the music is sad is because every tempo is almost catatonic. I've always liked Beck, but without all the flashy bells and whistles of his previous releases, he reveals himself for what he is: a mediocre songwriter with a strong baritone voice and funny way of pronouncoing words. <br />The production sounds superb, however. Of course, with Nigel Goderich at the helm, it's going to sound fantastic. But the core of this record is a bunch of sort-of-but-not-really sad, adolescent-angsty songs that will, with any mercy, put you right to sleep.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Let me start my review off by saying that is probably going to be biased.  I absolutely LOVE Fiona, and in my opinion she can do no wrong, but I am trying to be objective in regards to the music.<BR>I think that the songs Fiona writes are very easy to relate to.  She writes about failed relationships and her own insecurities and failures.  These are topics that I can very easily relate to.  The words that she chooses are absolutely perfect for the emotions that she is expressing---they are true poetry.<BR>I found the music on this CD much more catchy than that on her first album, Tidal.  Some people say that this album is overproduced and I can see their point, but I don't think that it at all takes away from the songs.<BR>My personal favorite songs are Paper Bag and Fast As You Can: what can I say.  Oh my God.  They are so original--music, lyrics, delivery, everything.<BR>The only problem that I have with this CD is that it makes me realize that I will never be able to express my emotions as eloquently as Fiona
0316666343|2.0|I read this book for my book club and was unfortunately  disappointed.  I think Alice Sebold has some interesting ideas, but didn't expand enough on the whole idea of Susie's heaven.  Susie could have moved on a little more and learned more about what was there.  Isn't there anything useful to do there?<br />Sebold's writing is lovely, though at times the prose seems to go on and on without getting to the story.  The development of the characters is done pretty well, but it is so depressing and sad to see what they go through after Susie's murder.  I would expect that after a murder, but it was tough to get through.<br />Also, there were some dumb things that bugged me, like how does a ghost smell? or how did the murderer leave an elbow behind - were the bones broken off around it? Finding an elbow is weird....is it supposed to be funny? ick!  <br />Finally, I thought the ending was just stupid...I did like Sebold's comments about the bonds/bones created in her family because of this terrible ordeal.  But, the end really just leaves you hanging.  <br />I wouldn't recommend this novel.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Once again the King waves his golden crown down to those of us left in the wake of his rock and roll reign.  This CD is an awesome culmination of the well known songs that changed American music. Even if you aren't an Elvis fan, buy this CD and I guarantee that you soon will be!  Before anyone did anything....ELVIS did EVERYTHING!
B00006AG5N|5.0|I guess every one is entitled to his own opinion.  Whether it's Chuck Berry or Carl Perkins or whoever??  Elvis brought the music to the mainstream audience.  Without Elvis, Little Richard and Chuck Berry would be underground legends and we'd be praising Pat Boone's 30 greatest hits right now.  As far as the CD goes, yes these tunes can be found on other CD's, but they are not mixed on other CD's as well, or as hot as they are on here.  New life has been given to every single song and it's actually a pleasure to hear Hound Dog all over again.  I am a Beatles fan as well.  I'd have to say that this compilation by far blows away Beatles 1.  It is obvious in listening to both CD's which one was given the treatment that only a King should have.  This CD will someday be called the greatest Rock and Roll album of our time.
B00000I8NC|5.0|The first GYBE record I ever got was Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven -- And though there were parts I enjoyed, I found it dragged a bit (which is saying a lot since I tend to have a considerable amount of patience when listening to music -- some of their segues are too long for my tastes).<br />When I got this CD, I found that it was much more punctual -- The songwriting is much more anthemic on this CD than their other work.  Straight to the point, and very powerful.  Buy it.  It may be much more digestible than their other stuff, but it's a good album to get a start on GYBE with.

Yes, you'll be out some money, but there will be one less copy of this book (here meaning random words thrown together without meaning, character, plot, theme, or purpose printed onto paper, bound together, and sold at an enormous effort to profit ratio) polluting the planet.  I don't think I've ever read a book more clearly meant solely to line the author's and publisher's pocket.  No redeeming value whatsoever.  Horribly written, dull, depressing, and not even interesting enough to be called one-dimensional.

0380002930|5.0|I had never planned to read this book, but I needed a book to read for school and I found this on my shelf.  I flat-out loved it.  It is the story of a groups of rabbits, one of whom predicts danger for the warren.  With his brother and everyone they can get to come, they trek across the english countryside looking for a new home, encountering many problems and trouble along the way.  Some have called it a political allegory, and although the author Richard Adams has denied this, allusions can definetly be made to fascism and communism.  A well developed book, with a structered plot leading up  to a brilliant climax, I would reccomend this book to anyone.
B00006F7S4|5.0|\\"Sea Change\\" easily demonstrates how great it is to have a recording artist like Beck available to us. Anger, sadness and phenominal music combine to make this record great on so many levels.<br />\\"The Golden Age\\" sets a deliciously simple groove dripping with emotion. It happens to contain some of the most beautiful harmonies I've heard in years.<br />\\"Paper Tiger\\" (my album favorite) is probably the most dramatically angry song that I've ever heard on a Beck record. It shares a fearful, angry edge as \\"Climbing Up The Walls\\" by Radiohead and the orchestral scope of \\"Joga\\" by Bjork. It's awesome.<br />\\"Guess I'm Doin' Fine\\" is like musical Prozac. Imagine if you can: You're dealing with a break up. You feel like [crud]. But you know you're going to survive. You just gotta go through the crummy process of emotional healing. Great track.<br />\\"Lonesome Tears\\" talks about the emotional confusion that comes from rejection. Like \\"Paper Tiger\\" it contains some terrific musical theatrics. Great production on this track.<br />\\"Lost Cause\\" is a song that could be about Sysiphys -- the mythical story of a man who keeps pushing a rock up a mountain, only to have it roll back down. I think this song is hilarious.<br />\\"Nothing I Haven't Seen\\" seems to be about disillusionment -- a dominant theme across the record.<br />\\"All In Your Mind\\" my second favorite track on the record. A song about being on the other side of codependent behavior.<br />\\"Round the Bend\\" -- Hard to explain, but beautiful to listen to.<br />\\"Already Dead\\" probably the most bitter sounding song I've ever heard. This could put teenagers over the edge.<br />\\"Sunday Sun\\" appears to have some interesting Indian influences without using native instruments. He succeeds using piano, guitar, drums, and triangles. It reminds me of walking along the streets of L.A.<br />\\"Little One\\" a weird song I haven't quite figured out yet. But it contains one of the best choruses I've heard in years.<br />\\"Side of the Road\\" - A terrific closer. Nuf said.<br />If you loved Mutations, you need to get this record. It's a big step ahead of that album, but relives the smarts of One Foot in the Grave and Stereopathetic Soulmanure. It's great stuff.A terrific closer.

B00006F7S4|5.0|I think perhaps that is the point of this album.  Rather than a collection of radio-friendly singles, Beck is going for a general mood.  It is safe to say he has fully accomplished that and created a beautiful piece of music.  In my opinion some individual songs are better than others (in particular &quot;Lonesome Tears&quot; and &quot;Little One&quot;), but they come alive within the context of the entire whole.<br />As with most great albums, more than one listen is necessary to appreciate the gestalt.  Admittedly, this isn't exactly like previous Beck albums and it is not merely Mutations 2.  But that is what makes Beck a great musician - he is consistently fresh, original and surprising.
B00006AG5N|5.0|If you want to  appreciate Elvis'amazing talent,this is the best Elvis' greatest hits  collection ever published by RCA. I'm a young listener and I deeply admire Elvis' vocal abilities. I think Elvis could sing everything,from r'n'r to gospel,from country to pop and convey deep feelings to the listener. I can't think of another single artist who could reach such levels. Just listen to the outstanding performance of  &quot;Suspicious minds&quot; or to the raw rock'n'roll of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; or &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;. Relax while listening to such tender ballads as &quot;Can't help falling in love&quot; or Are you lonesome tonight&quot;..Hear Elvis great rendition of &quot;In the ghetto&quot;.Then enjoy the 70's with songs such as &quot;Burning Love&quot; or &quot;Way down&quot;. The last song is &quot;A little less conversation&quot;,a recent smash hit worldwide! This collcection is a must-have for every music lover. Forget the jokes written during the last 25 years about Elvis. Listen to his music and judge for yourself. Elvis' image needs to be  revaluated...the time has come.
0609610570|3.0|I bought the book, eager to learn how to execute. It starts out with the premise tht the best laid plans will never succeed without someone actually making sure it's done. In they're opinion, the CEO must be the one to do it. An interesting premise and one worth exploring. Unfortunately, this book never delivered. Instead, it is packed with stories and reminiscences about how great some people are and why isn't everyone that way. It uses specific genralities to stay that it's important to be honest and realistic in the business world. <BR>Duh! There's nothing new in it, and especially nothing for those mid-level people who want to succeed. <BR>Other books are much better.
B00006690G|5.0|This definitely has good songs on it. All of Eminem's best songs are on this cd.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis Presley revolutionized our world. With his music he gave a voice to the teen generation, and changed the world both culturally and socially. Little Richard once said: \\"Thank God for Elvis\\", explaining that Elvis opened the doors for black music. <BR>The music on this CD is probably the best music made during the 20th century, and it's even more enjoyable than the Beatles \\"1\\". The remastering has been done with great skill; the music is still exciting and vibrant. Highly recommended!
B000006342|5.0|Break Every Rule is one of Tina's best albums, the album was realesed in 1986 after her &quot;Private Dancer success&quot;.<br />Tina realesed this album with a hole new direction from her early works at that time, she gives her self as a rock and roll diva and as a love singer.<br />The album contains hit songs like:<br />1-TYPICAL MALE wich was the first cut of the album and was a big hit in the 80's, the song made it to #1 in 1986 and was nominated for a Grammy award.<br />2-WHAT YOU GET IS WHAT YOU SEE wich was the second single, talks about the women revolution also was hit and reached #14 in the Hot 100.<br />3-The third cut TWO PEOPLE describes a perfect sharing love relationship it made it to #23 in the US and #1 in Europe.<br />4-The #5 dance hit AFTERGLOW shows Tina in the need of love.<br />5-The very acclaimed rock song BACK WERE YOU STARTED brought Tina another Grammy award in the Best Femele Rock Vocal Perfomance category.<br />6-The song for her 3 year sold out Break Every Rule world tour was BREAK EVERY RULE only made it to #74 in the US but was a hot track during her shows.<br />7-OVERNIGHT SENSATION her autobiographical song was not a single but tells us in a funny way Tina's music career.<br />8-PARADISE IS HERE was covered in 1995 by Cher in her album &quot;It's a man's world&quot;<br />Break Every Rule sold million copies and is consider a classic wich contains 11 songs and has composition by Bryan Adams and the writers of Tina's smashing hit &quot;What's love&quot;.<br />This album has all kinds of styles and lyrics.
B000063JDE|5.0|Blue Velvet, like so many of Lynch's movies, is multi-layered.  On the surface, it portrays (with subtle humor and some strange twists of reality) a Norman Rockwell type town and its disturbing under belly.  It is also a coming of age story for the main character played by Kyle MacLachlan as he wrestles with his lust for an older woman (Isabella Rossellini) and his feelings for a young high school girl (Laura Dern).  It also has elements of a morality play when the outstanding villian played by Dennis Hopper enters the fray.  Underneath it all though, there's always the thought that David Lynch might just be mocking our picturesque ideas of small town life.
B000003TBP|5.0|What can I add but my five star vote and to chime in \\"Pure Genius?\\" \\"High Five\\" may be my favorite track because it always makes me laugh to myself. In fact, Beck's off-hand humor is pretty evident throughout. Doesn't anyone else think this guy is full of bizarre, often dry humor? On MELLOW GOLD it was \\"Truckdriving Neighbors Downstairs\\" that had me rolling. I also really dig \\"Hot Wax\\" and \\"Jack-Ass.\\"<br />Although the whole album is truly excellent, the only thing that I don't like - no, absolutely can't stand and run for the fast-forward button when it comes on - is the intro to \\"New Pollution\\" and some of the monotone noise tacked onto the end of \\"Novacane.\\" Maybe it's just me, but I find these segments of noise irritating. I wish he hadn't put them on because sometimes I won't put on this album because I don't want to deal with it. I guess it's just another way for Beck to mess with our heads.
B000002KZ6|5.0|Speaking in Tongues is an incredible album.  Most bands slow down by their fifth album, but not the heads.  Just when you think that they don't have any more brilliant creative riffs and bass lines they bring you this remarkable piece of art.  The guitars are not as heavy on this as on previous albums.  They incorporate many other synthesized elements into the mix but the results are very satisfying.  All the other elements are still there: great songwriting, intellectually challenging lyrics, and rhythmic and melodic bass lines and guitar riffs.  In terms of the songs themselves all of them are great.  From track one to track nine every song is great and will have you singing along or dancing.  &quot;Making Flippy Floppy&quot; is particularly energetic and danceable.  It combines all the elements that characterize the heads and make them a truly great American band.  Other standout tracks are &quot;Burning Down the House,&quot; &quot;Girlfriend is better,&quot; &quot;Slippery People,&quot; hell just about every track.  One great track that is really a standout is &quot;Naive Melody (this must be the place).&quot;  This track is notable because it is perhaps the only real love song that David Byrne has ever written.  It is about being thrilled to be with another person and is about faithfulness, at least this is what I gather.  I also personally love this song because it has such a great, hypnotic guitar riff that is played throught the entire song.  It is really a perfect way to end the album.  It is so hard to rank the heads albums because just about everyone of them (especially the first five) is so good.  Yet, still this has to be one of their best.
B000062Y98|4.0|&quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; is Blind Guardian's newest release.  This Compact Disc has eleven tracks which provide over seventy minutes of thunderous, powerful heavy metal music.  They are similar in style to both Iron Maiden and Iced Earth.<br />Blind Guardian is from Germany and are veterans of the heavy metal music scene.  This is their ninth album.  Their first album &quot;Batallions of Fear&quot; was released in 1989.<br />The opening song sets the mood for the entire CD.  Thomas Stauch's drums flow with exceptional power.  The guitar riffs and leads compliment both the drums as well as Hansi Kursch's powerful and energetic vocals.  The lyrics are both well written and thought provoking.  Definately a step above most modern day heavy metal bands.<br />It is in my opinion that this is a well thought out and well produced Compact Disc.  I strongly suggest this CD to anyone who enjoys the musical stylings of Iced Earth, Rhapsody, Yngwie Malmsteen, or even old Iron Maiden.  This is one CD that will stay in my collection for a very long time.
B00005JKZQ|5.0|my wife and i watched this last night we like action movies and a good funny movie sometimes. this movie had both. i think robert deniro<BR>was funny in this movie and i have always liked most of eddie murphy movies and i think they were good together.and to see william shatner also made this a funny movie when he was showing them how to hood jump like tj hooker did was funny. this was well worth the time and the money to watch.
B0000542D2|2.0|The new Miramax release of A Hard Day's Night is a long-awaited release for Fab fans everywhere, but it let this fan down.  I have the old MPI release and in this case older is better.  Here's why:<br />1)  THE FRAMING: This new widescreen release actually shows less of the picture than the old standard screen version.  Compare the 2 side by side and it's obvious they made a letterbox image by cutting off the top and bottom of the picture.  You get a little more on each side, but you lose more on the top and bottom than you gain.<br />2)  THE PRINT QUALITY:  It's good, but it's better on the old release.  At several points throughout the film there are noticible scratches and specs that aren't on the earlier disc.  Why was this \\"restored\\" anyway?  It under went a highly publicized restoration for the previous release.  There was even an AMC special/documentary about the restoration of AHDN and Help.  The old print is cleaner and sharper.<br />3)  THE EXTRAS:  It's loaded with 'em, but most aren't worth the time.  The 40 minute documentary is very good, but the entire second disc is made up of interviews with people few would care about:  the movie's hairdresser, the tailor's son, actors in incredibly small parts (the croupier, the jumping dancer, the dance choreographer).  Other than a few segments, mainly George Martin and Dick Lester, it's pretty dispensable.  The old disc didn't have nearly as much, but it did have the trailer (missing here) and 2 newsreels actually featuring the Beatles plus an interview with Dick Lester.  <br />4)  THE SOUND:  No real problems, but no real improvements either.  The music has been remixed into 5.1 surround, but it's darn hard to tell.  Plus for some reason there's a lot of extra reverb in the concert sequence.  Why?<br />In short, I had my old release for sale on ebay the day this went on sale.  I cancelled the auction 2 days later and kept it.  The new release has fancier packaging and nice menus, but not much else to recommendit.  If you can find the out-of-print MPI version, you'd be better off.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I heard the buzz about Norah Jones and finally got my butt in gear to get the CD...  This voice is definately worth a listen (or a million).  Its a mellow sound that fits just about any occasion.  She is not, as I saw one person write somewhere, a \\"country sounding\\" artist... far from it.  Her sound, while based in jazz, dables with folk, pop, and even a bit of Spanish style on my favorite song \\"I've Got to See You Again\\".  Anyone looking for fresh, new sounds that give you a break from the constant droaning of the \\"pop elite\\" boybands and such, should definately check out Norah Jones.  You'll probably like what you hear.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This is a classic fantasy film and should not be missed.
B000069AUI|4.0|It is with a pensive reflection which Coldplay makes their sophomore debut with their album \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\". From the opening track, the return is tinged with contemplation while viewing the world from afar: \\"Look at earth from outer space.\\"  The band has learned to rock somewhat but with twangs and folk-like acoustic melodies on songs such as \\"Green Eyes\\" they still aren't the caliber of Radiohead. But that's fine, these guys have their place right among tearful weekends and rain-filled afternoons.  True, the album's purest rock song is aptly titled \\"Whisper\\". Almost cute, isn't it? Lead singer Chris Martin painfully moans loneliness and remorse throughout most of the album with his delicate vocals. We've all been there before.  My first introduction to their music, this UK-based band politely sighs to America as if to say `*it's* happenin' across the pond ya bloody yanks.' <br />While Radiohead defined modern rock with their complexity and machine-like anthems, Coldplay has reminded us of the melancholy frailty which rock can also portray in an eerie Pink Floyd-ish manner. Martin quietly proclaims \\"I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones, That I started looking for a warning sign\\" Oh - don't worry, we've already seen it and know that there is no cause for alarm. Total time: an over-to-soon 54 minutes. The inside cover has a fabulous black &amp; white impromptu picture of the boys taken while they were rehearsing. In the end, their weeping faintness gets you. Shhh...listen quietly. Sounds beautiful doesn't it? - Daz
B000069AUI|5.0|unbelievable. after parachutes i did not think that it would be possible for the follow up to even compare; however, a rush of blood to the head actually outdoes its predecessor. a bit more rock and roll than parachutes, a rush is a stunning mix of mellow tunes and rock classics. not a weak tune on the album again, listen out for amsterdam. the thing is that at first listen its a good album, yet the more you listen the better it gets. turn it up loud.
B000068QY7|5.0|This album is as good as anything that Oasis have written, and that i think says it all, from the hidu times, hung in a bad place which are pure old school rock and roll to force of nature, little by little and song bird which are very beatles inspired which is why this band take you over once the tunes start. You almost feel like you are part of the band and that you are on that stage in front of the people singing along with you. Liams songs are amazing and he finally has opened the door and i cannot wait for his next songs in the years to come. Gem and Andy Bell have been great for the band and that will bring out alot of different sides to the band. and noel is still belting out the best songs since the stone roses split up and surpassed anything before him in my opinion. Best songs are 1-11 and the secret tune is top too! so go buy it and stop listening to R & B and all that Rap Nonsense
B00006CJOY|5.0|Be ready to be embarqued on a very energetic journey through the standards of Manu Chao and La Mano. Manu takes you to South America, Jamaica, Africa through its rythms and the contributions of the different elements of this international Radio Bemba. A couple of slower transitions to talk to your neighbor and catch up your breath (Por el suelo, Mr.Bobby, clandestino). Minha galera is a pure jewel... And so is this album... Some beats even remind me of the hot nights of partying at the San Fermines in Spain...<BR>Push the furnitures, make room, invite the neighbors and enjoy !!!!
B00006F83Y|3.0|The first two tracks and outstanding and almost worth the price of the record. If QOTSA capitalized on the musicality and rockingness of \\"No One Knows,\\" (minus its two-minutes too-long length) they'd be the band we're all giving 5 stars to here. There are some jaw-dropping moments peppered throughout, but also some monotony. Indeed, the radio DJ parodies were barely funny the first time, and most songs are wayyyyy too long for the few musical ideas they possess.<br />Most of the tunes here have good ideas but no sense of how to effectively employ them. Ultimately, this is a decent, above average record by a band that may or may not be able to do better.
B0000636UN|3.0|This is probably the only Sheryl Crow album in which I feel that there are actually Fillers on it (forgive me for saying it!).  There are great rockers on it like steve mcqueen, soak up sun and even the cute ABilene, but when you hear Your an Original you'll be surfin through Filler City.<br />Safe and Sound feels like a forced ballad.  As if Sheryl thought, &quot;I just have to make a song for 9/11, I just gotta!&quot;  I dont know, the song does nothing for me...<br />C'mon C'mon, the title track, is a super honest to goodness hit.  I hope it does really well on the radio if ever released.<br />Best quote from the album &quot;You took the best of me and threw it away...too bad the rest of me still wants you to stay!&quot;<br />My personal favorite is her second album aptly title Sheryl Crow, which contains the hit If it makes you happy.  If that happens to be your favorite also, then you will also feel that this album has fillers on it.<BR>We still love you Sheryl :)
B000002GZ1|5.0|Butterfield's debut CD burst on the scene in 1965 and the blues, rock and pop scene were never the same after it's release. In it's original form, the band consisted of Butterfield on vocals and harmonica, Mike Bloomfield on slide guitar, Elvin Bishop on rhythm guitar, Jerome Arnold on bass, Sam Lay on drums and Mark Naftalin on organ. One can argue which Butterfield CD should be at the top of the heap but there is no denying that this would rank in the top five of any Butterfield enthusiasts list. The CD contains a variety of blues styles as well as what became the bands signature song, &quot;Born In Chicago&quot; as well as the Bloomfield gem &quot;Screamin'&quot;. If you love Butterfield, this is a must have CD.  If you are unfamiliar with Butterfield, this is the place to start.  In either case, you should own this disc!
B00005OAIE|3.0|But dont get me wrong, there are a good five tracks on this cd!  Its just that once you get past the cute similarity between John and Dave Matthews, ummm, you kinda get bored.<br />The highlights on the album are: Great Indoors and Your Body is a Wonderland which are both sexy and seductive.<BR>Back To You is my personal favorite, the tried and true topic of an undying love although the song ends with a self empowering twist.  <br />Not every album you buy is meant to change your perspective on the world, nor must it move you to tears.  Some albums are simply ok for what their worth.  This is one of them.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Congratulations to RCA for finally putting this CD out. The sound is more fresh and crisp than it has ever been. Elvis once again proves why he is the king! His place in our hearts and history is assured.
0385474547|5.0|Its a story about the Struggle between Change and Tradition.It's a story about a culture on the verge of change, Things Fall Apart deals with how the prospect and reality of change affect various characters. The tension about whether change should be privileged over tradition often involves questions of personal status. Okonkwo, for example, resists the new political and religious orders because he feels that they are not manly and that he himself will not be manly if he consents to join or even tolerate them. To some extent, Okonkwo's resistance of cultural change is also due to his fear of losing societal status. His sense of self-worth is dependent upon the traditional standards by which society judges him. This system of evaluating the self inspires many of the clan's outcasts to embrace Christianity. Long scorned, these outcasts find in the Christian value system a refuge from the Igbo cultural values that place them below everyone else. In their new community, these converts enjoy a more elevated status.
0553381709|4.0|I really love the stories and Martin's prose is smooth and evocative.  However, he jumps from one character's story to another each chapter, so the book never developes a flow or rhythm.  I wish he would have structured the book such that he told each character's story more completely rather than jumping around chapter to chapter.  I find the style very disruptive.
B0000020C4|5.0|An excellent recording with a very good cast and backup chior. Well recorded. Tempo proper (unlike certain other LM recordings). Plus, this CD has all the LM songs instead of leaving some out.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This disc displays the #1 hits of \\"The King Of Rock and Roll\\" AND \\"The King of Pop\\" sounding fabulous. It is a nice little slice of wonderful memories for seasoned fans, and the perfect vehicle to start with for The King's new generations of fans, which are very evident, by even including the bonus #1 track new remix of \\"A Little Less Conversation\\" to boot. The remaining tracks---all classic Elvis chart toppers, and most immortal moments in musical history sound crisper, sharper and more spacious than perhaps ever before. One slight unexplained and rather inexcusable fault here though is that a couple of tracks...\\"A Fool Such As I\\" and \\"The Wonder Of You\\" are NOT the brilliant original master #1 versions, but inferior alternate versions, and this perturbs me a bit. But overall it's a fine collection of the #1's for long time fans and for new discoverers and fans of The King to pick up, slide in and hear some truly great music....the likes of which is no longer made, and never was made like EP made it. As John Lennon once said...\\"Before Elvis there was nothing. If it wasn't for Elvis, there would have never been The Beatles\\". Get this disc and celebrate the King's legacy once again or discover it for the first time and find out in just this one disc why Elvis is and will always be the one and the only King.
0385503954|5.0|Atonement is simply a wonderful piece of fiction, one that starts off impressively and then continues, getting stronger, until the last page which quite frankly took my breath away.  The novel begins as a quaint, well-told tale about a few days on an English country estate in the 1930s.  Young Briony has written a play and is intent on staging it with her visiting cousins.  She witnesses an interchange between her older sister, Cecilia, and Robbie, their housekeeper's son, her imagination gets the better of her and she tells a lie that essentially destroys several lives.  After the lie is told, the novel jumps ahead several years, focussing on the lives of Cecilia, Robbie and ultimately Briony, as she tries to atone for her sin.  The novel then jumps forward again, it is 1999 and Briony is an accomplished writer, still, however attempting to atone for what she has done.  The closing passages of the novel are some of the most powerful I have read, ruminations on writing and the power, and the lack of power, of the written word.  Atonement is a serious piece of fiction, not something to pick up if you are in search of something light.  It may take a little patience to get into.  The first part of the novel can be a little slow (although I thought it was wonderful, something to be savored), but along the way it gains momentum and becomes utterly riveting and powerful.  If you are at all curious about Atonement, by all means pick it up.  It is a wonderful, powerful work, a rare novel.
B000002GJH|5.0|With the work of Eddy Vedder from Pearl Jam and Chris Cornell from Sound Garden blending perfectly on this alternative-at-its-best disc creates a must have for ANY Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Mudhoney, Screaming Trees or alternative rock fans collection. Listen to it. Love it.
B00006IU73|5.0|Wow! What a disc. This has got to be the best CD I have heard for 2002. &quot;in absentia&quot; the new release by Porcupine Tree is quite a departure for this progressive band. This CD rocks, and rocks hard. For those of you who are not familiar with PT, they have been frequently compared to Pink Floyd. Floyd never sounded like this. Guitarist and mastermind Steven Wilson has created a masterpiece of progressive music mixed with hard rock. PT has evolved into a complete band with hot bassist Colin Edwin, keyboard maestro Richard Barbieri, and new drummer, who I feel really puts the rock into it, Gavin Harrison. Wilson has always been an excellent songwriter, you can still feel the old PT sound in songs like &quot;Lips of Ashes&quot; &quot;Prodigal&quot; and the beautiful closing number &quot;Collapse The Light Into The Earth&quot;. There are shades of Jimmy Page(&quot;Wedding Nails&quot;) and Pear Jam would be envious of the hard rockin &quot;The Creator Has A Mastertape&quot;. This being PT's first major record release, lets hope Atlantic Records gets behind these guys. Radiohead and Coldplay are very good bands but Porcupine Tree is the best band right now out of England. If you get into this, I would go backwards into PT's discography, beginning with &quot;Lightbulb Sun&quot; and &quot;Stupid Dream&quot;. I hope that the diehard PT fans like myself except this new edge to this wonderful band as they continue to mature. I still love all the earlier work also. Steven Wilson has taken this band to a new level, lets hope &quot;in absentia&quot; does the same.

B00006IU73|4.0|I wish the media would stop referring to Porcupine Tree as \\"prog.\\"  Modern prog to me is stuffed with Yes and Genesis wannabes with nary an original or compelling musical thought.  Porcupine Tree are NOT part of the \\"Modern Prog\\" camp in any shape, form, or fashion.  They are their own animal and are exceptional.  <br />If any influences come to mind, it's more mid-period Pink Floyd and the more metallic side of King Crimson, but that would only serve to limit PT's considerable achievements and does not really describe their sound at all.  This band is rooted firmly in the present and is not interested in digging up old bones.<br />The compositions on In Absentia are thoughtfully structured but, as always, suggest limitless spaces -- albeit spaces with a few dark clouds and shadows lurking about.  If you're a fan of their previous works, I can't say In Absentia is a big step forward in their development, but it is a highly sophisticated fine-tuning of the shorter, more formal compositional styles prevalent on their excellent last CD, Lightbulb Sun.  <br />It's difficult to say where their sound will go from here -- they seem to have taken their current stage of development about as far as it can go -- but PT continue to produce some of the best-crafted, most intelligent music available today.  When it comes to smart music written and performed at a higher level, these guys are the real deal.  Forget your labels.
B000001ELP|5.0|This is a great album.  Many Kiss fans dismiss it because it is so &quot;un-Kiss-like.&quot;  The band themselves dismiss it because they dismiss everything that sells poorly.  However, there's no getting past the notion that there was more to Kiss than met the eye back in the 70's and 80's because of this effort.  A song like &quot;Only You&quot; is a perfect showcase for this album's dynamics; it's creeping at first - very Lovecraftian - before culminating into a majestic resolution.  &quot;The Oath&quot; is a powerful, but intelligent metal tune laced with melody and style.  &quot;Escape From the Island&quot; - a rare Kiss instrumental - is an obvious precursor to the music of bands such as Metallica.  There are some odd things here and there, such as the baroque stylings of &quot;Just A Boy&quot; and the operatic chorus of &quot;Under the Rose&quot;, but the absolute beauty of a song like &quot;Odyssey&quot; make up for them.  Shame on Simmons and Stanley for treating this CD with such disregard.  This isn't high art, but if you're playing D &amp; D or on your way to a Rennaissance Fair, this is a quirky but awesome CD to have playing in the background.
B000021YQV|3.0|A heavy, de-tuned guitar chord slash comes out of nowhere, advising the listener to take heed of what is about to unfold  (warning: do not have your speakers turned up high when you put this one in!). From this opening salvo of brutal riffery,  the listener knows that they are in for something powerfully intense, exotically eccentric and bashingly brutal.  System Of A Down have cordially invited us to take a ride with them through 14 songs of sheer power and bombast, and overall the ride is enjoyable, but not without some bumps and flaws in it's mechanics.  Thankfully, System warns us early on in their melodically gifted \\"Deer Dance\\" that \\"we cannot afford to be neutral on a moving train!!\\"<br />Indeed, a roller-coaster or a speeding train careening out of control are good ways to describe \\"Toxicity\\", the second major label release from System Of A Down.  Coming full speed at rock fans at a time when many of their musical legends are becoming more introspective in song and lyric and thus less commercially accepted (think recent offerings from Pearl Jam, Tool, and Incubus), \\"Toxicity\\" serves as a breath of fresh air for the heavier music fan who finds little artistry in the three chord punk displays or tired nu-metal whinings that appear to dominate the airwaves these days (think recent Blink-182 or Korn offerings).  It has sold very well, and has brought attention back to the intricacies of lyrics and melody combined, which puts them in the category of the modern classics bands (again, Pearl Jam, Tool and Incubus).  Some of their eccentricities can be a difficult pill to swallow however, yet at the same time some of their melodies fall under what could be considered \\"typical heavy metal riffing\\", which in my view puts System Of A Down slightly below the \\"big three\\" modern day classic rock bands I listed above. <br />\\"Toxicity\\" also suffers in the lyrical department, with some lyrics that are simply painfully unbearable in their heavy-handed meaninglessness (Trust inmy self righteous suicide, I cry when angels deserve to die), but System Of A Down surprises and entertains us even in their low points, as vocalists Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian manage to harmonize together in a way which can only be described as \\"angelic\\". Elsewhere, the pedestrian and predictable metal riffage of \\"Aerials\\" is saved again by some elegantly rendered vocal arrangements. And where in \\"Chop Suey\\" the poetry just doesn't make  much sense, System do communicate their ideas nicely in lines like \\"You don't care about how I feel/ I don't feel it anymore\\" or \\"cause we are the ones that want to choose, we always want to play but you never want to lose\\" or perhaps my personal favorite lyric \\"pushing little children with their fully automatics, they like to push the weak around\\".  Here, their messages of sadness at a society that has lost it's capacity to care for those who do not conform or \\"fit in\\" resonates deeply, a warm hug if you will to the listener, a reward for surviving some of the truly \\"Animal\\" like (the Muppets character) death metal growls and punishing metal riffs.  <br />Overall, System Of A Down achieve what they have set out to do on \\"Toxicity\\", offering the listener a solid collection of songs that are equally heavy sonically and emotionally.  At times it can be punishing, but it is important for us to remember that yes, in the year 2002, life does exist outside the silver-spires of the Staples Center.
0694003611|5.0|My son LOVES this book, and it's one of his (and my) bedtime favorites. It's a good, low-key book that's perfect for bedtime. I read it in a soft voice, and as we go through it, I ask him to point out the different things the story talks about. He likes to read it during the day, too. Just a fun book!

0316666343|2.0|It's easy to see from this book why Sebold's first book, LUCKY, was so well-received. She's a beautiful writer--her prose is lyrical, vivid, and imaginative. THE LOVELY BONES starts off with much promise: a well-crafted murder scene, followed by a spooky transmutative scene in which a classmate senses Susie's spirit on its way to heaven. From there, the narrative splits into two separate threads: the Salmon family's battle with the grief of their loss, and Susie's observations from heaven. Sebold's conception of heaven (and specifically Susie's heaven, as heaven is realm specifically tailored to each individual) is as wild and unique and plausible as any I've ever encountered. <br />As Susie observes her family, friends, and her killer from her perch on high, it becomes clear quite quickly that this book is not a murder mystery. The \\"spirit\\" of Susie will not intervene and lead her family to avenge her death. She cannot give directions to her remains, or to the last uncoverable evidence which can identify her rapist and murderer. Rather, the book will be about loss, and how each individual, not only in the Salmon family, but in the community at large, reckons the inexplicable loss of a young child in order to establish sense and meaning in their own lives. <br />Thematically, this is no small undertaking, and ultimately I didn't feel that Sebold succeeded in anatomizing the emotion of grief, much less The Meaning of Life, the promise of which is underscored quite heavily throughout the novel. This failing is forgivable, certainly, as one can hardly think of a more ambitious goal. But it is in this ambition, among other reasons, that the book didn't work. <br />The narrative runs out of steam somewhere in the middle of the book. One begins to realize that the characters are just as undefined and underdeveloped as they were in the dazzling opening chapter, and that they've come no closer to anything.  Perhaps the moral of the story here is that everything and nothingchanges, that at root life goes on, no matter how much one might resist. <br />But without characters with whom to identify and empathize, the author's every labor is nullified. Stoic Lindsey is little more than a Superwoman in denial of her sister's death; her mother's escapism defines her, as we learn little else about her personality other than her inability to relate with her own mother; patriarch Jack Salmon is an insultingly glorified character: a grief-stricken father who can't let go of his perfect conception of Susie, like his delicate ships in bottles; and youngest son Buckley, is little more than a barnacle affixed to his \\"perfect\\" father. <br />Susie herself is a problematic figure. At times she narrates like the fourteen year-old she is at the beginning of the book, squealing with delight from her heaven at her sister's first kiss. Other times she narrates with the perspective of an adult, someone who endured and understood the things she never had a chance to. Susie's perspective fluctuates often between the two extremes, rather than as a progression towards a greater emotional maturity. <br />I might have gone along with all of this--for there are some very incredible and moving passages throughout--were it not for Sebold's resolution. The idea that, given the chance to live, the single thing that Susie chooses to do is disappointing and degrading. It shows us that she's learned nothing from her observations, and renders the entire novel a great waste of time for having gone along with it. Susie's Heavenly Purpose isn't a purpose at all. And in her own self-motivated final action, I feel duped for having cared about her all along, and for buying into a promise that was never granted.
B00006AG5N|5.0|I had the oppertunity to listen to a promo cd of Elvis 30 #1 hits and after that I was so much waiting for its release - now as I have it I do not listen to anything else. It sounds like it all has been recorded yesterday. 80 min of pure music from the undisputable King of Rock'n'Roll and the only person in music history to be inducted in all 3 halls of fame. Better be going and buy the disc as soon as possible. If you have not been an Elvis fan after listening to this very recording you certainly will be.
B000002KBU|5.0|Before I review this record, I want to mention I had considered not bothering, because there are about 100 5 star reviews, so if you don't get it by now...but...there are acouple points to bring up.  I'll start with the last one first.<BR>the last point about &quot;Blue&quot; and Joni in particular, and her fans, is that she is not the beginning and end of songwriters, of women songwriters.  Her peer Laura Nyro, who debuts around the same time -1969-70, was incredibly important as a musical stylist and as an event.  She was Bruce without any pretense, without moves, without the band.  She was a new fiction writer out of the big city, all urban and poetry, describing things hippies were not thinking much about, and evoking musical styles that were not particularly popular. she used voicings and chords not used in any pop music. Joni was coming out of a kind of folk scene. She represented, if you will, California.  the beautiful hippies. but affluence as well. There was something decidedly not urban about Joni.  They was very unique, making themselves up, and they were wonderful to look at.<BR>These two women,both had incredible impact but in very different ways.  JOni's impact was rather social.  People wanted to sing like her, to wear their hair like her, to be Blue, like her. <BR>Laura's impact was cultural.  She was singing about her brothers the Black Panthers and telling stories that were certainly not about white people buying jewels in Laurel Canyon.  they were both needed, these women, in those times.  their voices were relevant.  They helped millions of people.  It's true.  <br />When I read some reviews that site Joni as THE influence on all girl songwriters, (because surely that statement must include men as well!!)  I must protest.  Joni was not then and is not the most influencial of these writers. though certainly the most popular amoung that generation which is now over 50.  She was their number one girl singer for sure.  <BR>Besides Laura, and Janis,Rickie Lee Jones has had incredible impact, She, ten years after those two women, brought strains of Billie Holiday, VAn Morrison, she was R&amp;B with some strange inflection of humor and despair, a white girl not allowed in white places.  She,  holding an accoustic guitar with long hair, looked just like a JOni, but in fact was so far from it. Far from JOni, or Patti, or any of it.   I believe many of the female singers I hear now are coming out of Rickie Lee Jones more than any other singer songwriter.  The no vibrato, no soprano, half-spoken style of Jones was completly unique.  Now it is so common I am sure many listeners do not know the well from which it sprang.  it is a disservice to great women to credit JOni with all things feminine, as if there has only been one woman with impact.  Her impact is huge. Peoples impression of her, I guess, is huge. She is one of the most important musicians of popular music. that is all true. and<BR>Blue is the definative artistic point of her career. <br />There is no better Joni record, and it surely counts in the top ten greatest records when all is said and done.  each song is a journey, and the sum of the total is more than the parts. There was not a college campus that did not ring with girls practicing their soprano with a slow vibrato. JOni brought sensuality to hippy love.  And she was a great, great player.  Bold, unique, perfect for getting her emotions across.  <br />Sophisticated, this is the folk singer finding out there are junkies sitting in the capppucino bar.  Dissillusioned,  lonely,  and living the lush life.  <BR>the college preppy gone awry persona,  her kind of rich girl bumming it thing. <br />Only a phase, these dark cafe days.
B000002JKA|5.0|<br />I actually only bought this disc to get a friend of mine to shut up about these guys; he was a big DT fan, forcefed me their music whenever i was in his car, and heckled me endlessly about not being as musically enlightened as he was because i didn't dig these guys.<BR><br />You know what? he was right. I've been into shred guitar for a while, so initially i just listened to it for Petrucci's unspeakably good soloing. Then, the music started to grow on me. These guys are all just disturbingly good musicians- the interplay this band demosntrates on this cd is incredible. And yet, the songs are accessable- it's a straight up hard rock disc, with a prog twist.<BR><br /> I particularly dig the work they do with samples on this album, in particular on the closer, &quot;Space-Dye Vest,&quot; which just may be my favorite DT song (and that's saying a lot, seeing as i got into these guys for their guitarist, and SDV is almost entirely keyboard driven). also, while Jordan Rudess (their current keyboardist) is undeniably the better technical player, Kevin Moore's lines really bring this CD to life; try picturing &quot;Caught in a Web&quot; without the line he's playing over the grinding riff petrucci opens the song with. It just doesn't work.<BR><br />This Cd is an astounding display of musicianship, and if you've ever been curious about these guys, or are just looking for a new cd to expand your musical horizens a bit, you owe it to yourself to hit that &quot;add to shopping cart&quot; button at the top of the page.
B00006AG5N|5.0|To say this album is worth 5 stars is an understatement. It is quite simply the GREATEST album EVER. The singing is a revelation and the quality of the sound is incomparable.<br />Elvis Presley is the ONLY artist who sang in so many musical genres and they are all featured on this album from out and out rock 'n' roll through ballads, country to dance. If you do not own an Elvis album then this is the one to start with as it gives you a good cross section of his music and must whet the appetite for hearing more of his incredible repertoire.<br />As the logo says &quot;Before Anyone Did Anything - Elvis Did Everything&quot; and that says it all.<br />Go out and buy this relase with confidence - you will not be disappointed.
6304698658|5.0|Yet another in the great Vacation series. The Griswolds have the whole family over for what most would perceive to be the &quot;A-typical&quot; Griswold family Christmas. This is a must have for the Christmas season.
0783226063|3.0|While this DVD works fine on analog (4:3) sets, you will likely be disappointed if you play it back on a progressive scan DVD to 16:9 digital HDTV monitor. It will not be proportioned correctly as the video IS NOT anamorphic. It is a shame, this would be a fun movie to watch in true 480P widescreen.
B000065V1V|5.0|Any album with a song that name checks Uncle Floyd, Oogie, and Bones Boy gets a special place in my heart.  Even without Slip Away, this is a good and close to great record; With Slip Away, it is a home run.
0875428940|3.0|There are good sides and downsides to this deck.  Let's start with the positive first.<br />- Based on Rider-Waite imagery, which is what most books explaining tarot are based on.  The basic format is the same, but the artist put her own version and twist on it.  This makes this deck very beginner friendly.<br />- Tastefully conceived.  There is nudity, but tasteful.<br />- More 'artistic' than Rider-Waite decks, in my opinion, because you see more emotion on the figures' faces.  Sometimes the Rider-Waite deck comes across as pictures of stick people, and at times, like rough sketches.  The Robin Wood deck is more emotive, colorful, and clean.  It seems more professional and 3-D.<br />Now, onto the downsides.<br />- Almost every person depicted is blonde.  Not to say I have anything against blondes, but it gets redundant.<br />- There's a &quot;Ken-and-Barbie&quot; feel to it.  Sometimes, it just seems 'cartoony.'  Like other reviewers have cited, it's very happy-happy.<br />- The imagery is very defined, so those seeking more abstract imagery would do well to pass this deck up.<br />I would suggest this deck to those who are beginners at tarot because this is a very friendly, Rider-Waite based deck.  I used this deck along with the Goddess Tarot deck when I first started out and it was very helpful.  I needed the imagery to be approachable and friendly enough to sort of 'hold my hand' as I learned the tarot.<br />I would not, however, suggest this deck to those seeking more abstract or &quot;impressionist&quot; images.  For those looking for something different, this is just a cleaned up, more vibrant version of Rider-Waite.  As of now, I am using the Margarete Peterson deck, but my Robin Wood deck still sits fondly on the shelf, and I do go back to it from time to time, because the images are very clear in their intent and depiction.
B00006F7S4|3.0|If you're looking for funky, disco-boogie, fun, electro Beck this album is not for you.  It's kind of blah.  I haven't listened to it much since I just got it today, but it's putting me to sleep.  Hopefully it will grow on me, but it's never gonna make my booty shake.
B00006F7S4|5.0|For a large part of the 1990's I have despised Beck.  When he wasn't busy being the posterchild for \\"post-modernism\\" he was making music which did its best to sound insincere and purposefully ironic.  Like many others I bought Odelay and while I enjoyed mostly those track which had already been released as singles (The New Pollution, Where It's At, Devil's Haircut) much of the sound sampling/collaging and styleshifts on the other tracks stuck me as garish and overly showy.  Don't even get me started on Midnight Vultures.<br />Sea Change however is a return to a sparse folk sound which is augemented by some, if maybe the best orchestral arrangements i've ever heard on a pop record.  Paper Tiger utilizes an upbeat string motif which drives the song to an exhilarating conclusion.  Lonesome Tears uses a string texture of ascending chords which triumphantly burst through the chaos of the song's coda.  And probably the highlight is Round the Bend, which utilizes an ambience which I can only describe as a warm blanket of darkness.  You need to hear it to understand.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis 30 #1 is a collection of 30 of Elvis Presley's hits, it is not all of them. They have been remasterd and the sound quality brings out the Kings variety of music. This is a quality collection for new fans to start and for existing fans to have a colection of these hits.
B00006IU73|5.0|Absolutely amazing! This band consistently builds upon the past and improves with each new outing. The songs are fresh, yet consistent with the style that makes Porcupine Tree so appealing. There is a decidedly harder edge to some of the songs than one usually associates with the band, but in songs like WEDDING NAILS and COLLAPSE THE LIGHT INTO EARTH you can still hear the psychodelic influences so prevalent in early works like ON THE SUNDAY OF LIFE and VOYAGE 34.<br />If asked to compare this album to an earlier work, I would say it is more like STUPID DREAM than SIGNIFY, but Steve Wilson and Porcupine Tree refuse to be pigeon holed into a catagory that is easily defined. A must own for all P.T. fans and hopefully the breakthrough album that finally garners the band the wide spread recognition and acclaim they deserve.
B000007T1M|5.0|My favourite band, System of a down, have everyhitng they need to stand the test of time in their hands, Hard riffs, meaningful lyrics, sizzling solos, and originality. The opening song suite pee is an explicit hard rokcer. The in-your-face peep-hole is my favourite. It has great riffs, singing vocals, and the best solo ever, followed by the solos in welcome to the fold by filter and over the mountains by Ozzy. Darts, has great fills and rokcing riffs similar to that of Shimmy, from toxixity. Sugar, is another good song, more melodic than any other song. These rockers among others will get you going and encourage you to buy the cd.
B00005JL78|5.0|I thought Minority Report was great. I noticed several reviewers who were disappointed by the `lack of action.' Well, if you want action, go watch some bears fight in the woods. But if you want a creative, well made, and thought provoking film, watch Minority Report.
0060930349|5.0|For anyone who was fed the standard version of American History in school, this book will be a refreshing eye-opener. His narrative is much more gripping and readable than most textbooks, and he presents information that casts a different light on many events, situations, and characters in American history, shattering the standard myths. This is historical revisionism at its finest. <br />Johnson tells the rest of the story behind the League of Nations (opponents weren't necessarily isolationist) the crash of '29 (and how the interventionism of Hoover and FDR made the subsequent depression into the disaster it was) Eisenhower (the workaholic president who pretended to be lazy) and many other misunderstood matters. <br />Some high schools use this as a US History textbook, and it is a wise choice for the purpose.
B000069HKH|5.0|This is no Born To Run or Darkness.  It's a much different Bruce in a much different world.  That's okay.  It's s still great rock n'roll!  A must listen!
0452282152|3.0|I was attracted to this book because of the original concept; also because I am a teen myself, much interested in art and art history.  But perhaps my expectations were too high, because I was disappointed in it.  I didn't feel I could relate to the main character, and I felt the &quot;girl against the world&quot; theme was overdone.  Overall, I just felt the characters and storyline were too unbelievable.<br />I would recommend this book for a rainy day, but rent it from the library.  Don't waste your money on it.
0060987464|5.0|Naturally, since I'm a huge Manson fan I'm going to say that this book is great. It truly is. He writes very convincingly {though I wonder if all of it is true...} and after you read it you realize that he is a human being just like all of us. Also, don't be freaked out by the cover. It is an old saying that books shouldn't be judged by their covers and this is true. The book goes by quickly once you start reading it and it is a little expensive but it is an excellent buy that you won't regret.
0345440900|1.0|I was really disappointed in this book.  She is very authoritative in her tone but without any scientific backing.  I did not agree with most of her opinions especially those that were not supportive of breastfeeding.  It's like listening to your English grandma lecture at you on how to raise your child.  No thanks.
B000000YG5|5.0|I've only owned this disc for a month or so, after hearing about it for decades. I got brave enough to buy it because I loved the &quot;Thelonious Monk/Sonny Rollins&quot; CD. &quot;Colossus&quot; is great. Every one of the six selections is worthwhile, just different enough from one another to make a wonderfully varied jazz experience. I especially like what Sonny called &quot;Moritat&quot; which is &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; to us ordinary folks. Compare Sonny's instrumental take on this to the vocal versions done by Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald and Bobby Darin (and even Jerry Orbach, on his only available CD re-release of a 1963 album.) Rollins' version holds up to all those others, even without lyrics. Another reviewer calls this one of the top five jazz records ever made. I would say &quot;one of the top ten&quot; but that is still the highest praise. As with so many of the classic recordings from the 50's, this album was accomplished in one day. (Some of them took two days, but they're still pretty good!) Some contemporary rock/pop vocal CD's involve a month in various studios, and still stink. If you doubt the often-stated claim that jazz musicians are the most skilled in the world, listen to classic 50's and 60's offerings such as this one, improvised, barely rehearsed if rehearsed at all, preserved forever from one take or two at the most. Amazing stuff, this most American form of music.
B00003CXUM|5.0|Chow Mo-Wan played by Tony Leung and his wife move into their apartment on the same day that Mrs. Chan played by Maggie Cheung and her husband move into the apartment next door. At first their relationship consists of passing pleasantries and simple mahjong games with the neighbors but soon a sneaking suspicion bubbles its way to the surface. The increasing absence of their respective spouses arrives at the same time that Chow sees his wife carrying the same handbag as Mrs. Chan. Mrs. Chan, in turn, notices that her husband sports a tie similar to that worn by Chow. The two begin a secret friendship, and soon discover their desire turning from revenge to genuine passion. <br />This movie is simply amazing...i can not believe Wong Kar Wai makes such good movies...Wong Jing and rest of the HK pack should learn some from him and the beautiful cinematography by Christopher Doyle..mmm mmm mmm thumbs up. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung turn in performances that will leave you in awe. Direction, Music, technique, etc. ALL THUMBS UP
B00006AFUR|5.0|I heard a 30 second radio spot on my local station for this cd, it was of capricorn.  i had [$$] in hand and decided to buy it, god was it worth it.  the cd is smooth and flows well, i am listening to it now.  the lyrics and clever, the music is original and non-repetative.  a must buy.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I would like to start off by saying that this is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. Every song is enchanting, for lack of a better word. Capricorn(Brand New Name) is one of my favorite songs...it has an awesome mix of a trancy-rock kinda beats and awesome lyrics. Also, Buddah for Mary...it's such a raw, truthful song. All the songs on the album have a new,  mystical rhythym and the words will cut at your heart with it's brutal honesty. If you are like me and relate alot to this album, then it will really move you(emotionally as well as physically) <BR>The lead singer has an amazing voice, a great talent with words, and an unbelievable energy as well. The whole band has an energy that is \\"out of this world\\". I feel as if I can relate to the music, the words, the feelings, and the open-ness presented in this album. It is quite different from anything I've heard, which I like alot. It is extraordinary and it takes my breath away. I give it five stars...it's a MUST HAVE!
6303234844|5.0|I was forunate enough to see a show on this tour which I thought was the best Gabriel tour yet. This video documents it excellently. Peter Gabriel concerts are always riveting but on this tour he had many more tricks in his bag of goodies. His ability to involve his audience in the each songs story is uncanny. He runs the gamut of emotions in this set. Special credit goes to every member in the band. They help to propel the songs' intensities while each revealing a little bit of their own personality. It was easy to tell from Paula Cole's singing that she was destined for stardom. This tour was way ahead of it's time and sets the bar very high for any theatrically inclined singer or band.
B000005H4F|5.0|This is a lovely, accessible, balanced collection which shows off Miles and Cannonball at their peaks (1958) and is a great companion to the more widely known \\"Kind of Blue\\". The ten minutes of \\"Autumn Leaves\\" is achingly beautiful, especially via earphones, but all six selections are just fine, including the \\"Alison's Uncle\\" number left off the original vinyl release for lack of playing time. One thing to remember about buying jazz through Amazon or other on-line sources is that a one-minute \\"sample\\" of a six or ten-minute improvisation can be quite misleading. I was not impressed by the \\"samples\\" I heard from this disc, but I found a good price and went ahead and bought it anyway. The totality is so much different, and better, than the sampled portions! The two horn giants here are wonderfully supported by Hank Jones at the keyboard, Sam Jones on bass, and the great Art Blakey on the drums. This is music you'll find it quite hard to get tired of.
B000002I27|5.0|This is one of my favorite Doors albums. The songs have a distinct sixties sound and are fantastic. What impresses me most with the Doors is their astonishing array of tunes. As a singer, I always thought Jim was great, mostly due to his tremendous range and emotional flexibility. On the title track, \\"Strange Days,\\" Jim conjures that haunting Goth sound that I love. Then comes \\"You're Lost Little Girl,\\" which is an evocative ballad that offers no resolution except the refrain \\"I think that you know what to do...\\" Next comes \\"Love Me Two Times;\\" one of my favorite blues songs by the band. Horse Latitudes is a great experimental piece that is a protracted and passionate poetry reading set to loud and stormy impressionistic sounds. The lines \\"Poise, Delicate, Pause, Consent, In mute nostril agony\\" to describe the horses laboriously making their way through the water is typical Jim in his creative glory. Then comes \\"Moonlight Drive\\" a great youthful and exploratory piece that shows Jim's dreamy and romantic side. But as is typical of Jim, there is always an edge in his brand of romantic crooning (if we can even call it that!). He sings, \\"You reach your hand to hold me, but I can't be your guide.\\" I love the way he always inserts that twist to whatever he's contemplating. \\"People Are Strange\\" is Jim's great exploration of alienation. \\"My Eyes have See You\\" has a great sixties rocking sound to it. \\"I Can't See Your Face In My Mind\\" is a real mysterious and sensual ballad. \\"When the Music Is Over\\" is another great protracted tune that has a hard and sensual beat. Wow! What an album! The music is classic, and John, Robbie and Ray are brilliant musicians who always play at their best. All music reviews are subjective, and I'm sure there are those who may not share my tastes. But all in all, this is an album with range and emotional flexibility on which I'm sure any Doors fan can find a song that they like. This is definitely one of my favorite Doors albums.
B000069HK2|5.0|This is a very good hardcore punk release that is actualy getting played. My only gripe is that the lead singer has such and awesome screaming voice, use the singing sparingly.
B0000542D2|4.0|Ok, the picture is incredible.  Everything is &quot;very clean.&quot; However, some listings of the DVD have indicated that the soundtrack is in 5:1.  Not really.  The dialog comes out the center speakers and the songs come out the stereo speakers (almost exclusively the front).  There is some debate over whether the songs are in stereo or not (I side with the no they're not).  It is just weird to watch when the sound shifts entirely from the middle to entirely to the sides.  But hey, this is Hard Day's Night with a bunch of extras at a very reasonable price...what, you're not going to buy it?
0887306101|5.0|Not for trying to copy one of the traders trading styles, as it is not about that, but you really must get into the mind of these successful traders. I have read this book over 100 times and each time I seem to gain more knowledge.<br /> I always recommend people buy this book before they even trade a stock. Very interesting people with great minds on trading. Buy it now.

B00006J3WH|5.0|\\"Once more, with feeling\\" is one of the most daring, imaginative, and entertaining episodes in the entire \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" series.  In fact, I would argue that it's one of the best episodes on ANY series in TV History.  Since this landmark episode originally aired, fans have been clamoring for the soundtrack.  Many bootlegs have appeared on the Internet, but the quality of said bootlegs left alot to be desired.  This official release is just what the Watcher ordered.  My only complaint with this official release is that a few lines of dialogue (lines from the episode that aren't actually sung as part of the song) have been removed.  On the plus side, the songs are finally complete (i.e. they aren't terminated prematurely, as when used in the show).  There are no potentially distracting sound effects either.  Overall this is a must-have for any fan of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" or musicals in general.  It's just a great CD...
B0000696ID|5.0|Well i must say that Steven and everyone who worked on this master of a picture were all kids in there past with great dreams after going to bed.<BR>From the start of this family entertainment you are reaching out for the snacks, and falling off the chair while the eyes are glued to the TV.<BR>I first seen the movie like most in a cinema, and i must be honest to say at the time it was not my choice.<BR>How wrong i was to think that this movie was not full of the usual violance and sex that i would not enjoy on my search for an adult film.<BR>This movie brings the kid in all of us out with a wonderful story that we can all relate to in our childhood through dreams.<BR>I am now going to purchase the DVD for my six year old, and also my Son who is one years old.<BR>I really hope they keep on asking there Dad to play this non stop.<BR>I am a big guy, but i want the return of ET to be made as soon as Steven decides it is time for him to come home to the cinema for all future big kids like me.<BR>A lot more of this story can be told, and i will dream this with my kids tonight.
B000069AUI|5.0|I've not much to say about this album. Coldpaly is one of my favorite bands. Chris Martin is beautiful, has an awesome voice, is an awesome performer and is generally just a really talented guy. The band of course rocks too. If you loved Parachutes, you know how good they are and shouldn't be reading reviews you should be buying. If you don't know them, you'll love this album, it's a little more uptempo than thier prior album but still beautifully mellow (And I advise everyone to get both). There's an awesome blend of acoustic and electric guitar and piano. The music doesn't dominate the songs, the lyrics and voice do. Their music is mellow without being sappy or sleepy. This is an album you listen to and absorb and get moved by. It's not just music, it's art. This group of young guys come off as more skilled at their craft than most artists out today. This album is so honest and heartfelt... anyway it's awesome, it's brilliant, it's COLDPLAY!!!!!!
B00005OAIE|5.0|I have to concur with all of the positive comments about Room for Squares. This is superior pop music -- thoughtful, soulful, and purely enjoyable. Together with Five for Fighting's America Town, it's great to see new talent aimed at thinking adults. This is great stuff, one of the best albums of 2001.
0345428064|5.0|This guy seems like the real thing. The special thing about this series is the hero's relationship to the little girl in his care.<BR>While much of the action seems fantastic, it never crosses over to unbelievability. <BR>Obviously, the author has been there and done it.<BR>Escapist reading of the highest order. First of the series.
6303269869|2.0|This will be short because with the many addiction/alcoholic films out there this is by far the most unrealistic. That is it's only and fatal problem.<BR> Meg Ryan is a truly beautiful woman. Far,far too beautiful to make a good alcoholic.As her husband,Andy Garcia comes across as a whiny little killjoy. <BR>Alcohol ravages the body and ruins skin tone. We are suppose to believe that Ms. ryan is so addicted to alcohol that she digs through trash cans to finish the dregs of a bottle of booze (as is seen in the film). It simply is not convincing. The pain and ugliness of  alcoholism never are realized. Since the agony and horrible consequenses of being an active and then recovering alcoholic are the basis of the entire dramatic \\"impact\\" of the film, I kept waiting for the problem to get bad enough for me to care. It never did.
0790729628|5.0|A STUNNING view of Los Angeles and its 'sometime' nocturnal denizens circa 2017 or thereabouts .... From the mind-blowing opening panorama of Angel City to the Ridley Scott's  apprehensive conclusion - the viewer is transfixed by this epic sci-fi film noir.  The Art direction alone is multi-award worthy, one is never never bored -  even after numerous viewings, there's still something new - just there in [or partially out] of the frame.<br />Storyline?  Robotic or human Terminator [Ford] hunting the 'Life-Deprived' superhuman replicants - and what an array - from Sean Young [a spectacular debut performance], Joanna Cassidy, Daryl Hannah, Rutger Hauer to the 'humans' Edward James Olmos, J. Emmet Walsh - a curious journey along the lines of &quot;Alice In Wonderland&quot;.<br />This version also provides one of the best excamples of &quot;audio-direction' on DVD - the expert way soundtrack, dialogue and effects become separate entities.<br />Grand costume design - especially the Sean Young wardrobe - homage to Adrian and Joan Crawford.<br />The current 'Minority Report' is positively anemic by comparision.<br />This work closely resembles the vision of great D.W. Griffths - who would probably applaud loudly if he were still around.<br />Double-bill with &quot;Fifth Element&quot; - another rad mind-trip!

6305508550|5.0|In a nutshell, this movie is a wicked take on the wretched life of software engineers.<br />I worked in the software industry for just one year and I am still able to relate whatever happens in this movie to my daily routine. The &quot;PC-Load Letter&quot; printer, the efficiency experts, the manager with the coffee mug.. man ! everything has been so accuratly portrayed ! Yes.. life as a software engineer does become monotonous so quickly that you will start searching for an psychiatrist, as Peter does.<br />I did not like the ending of the movie and the little &quot;techno-heist&quot; that these people plan. The movie was funny and hilarious till the last few scenes and somehow became a little dull and boring at the end. Maybe the directors thought that it is compulsory to have some sort of a story in the movie... just for the sake of having it. (Not a good idea at all...)<br />Gary Cole (Bill Lumbergh), Ron Livingston (Peter), Ajay Naidu (Sameer) and David Herman (Micheal Bolton !) have done an excellent job, while Jennifer Aniston doesn't impress much.. Maybe that's because of her script or something.<br />Anyways, this is a great movie to own ...

B000068TPN|4.0|Very few movies will honestly depict soldiers as normal people with a love of their country and family.  This one shows the Vietnam era soldiers that I am familiar with.  Having spent much of my life associated with the military, I have never met the typical Hollywood Vietnam era soldier.  It is refreshing to see regular people, who love their families, and are dedicated to their profession and fellow soldiers.  <br />The scenes during the battle are disturbing, as they should be.  Overall, it's an excellent movie.
B00006F7S4|5.0|That is all I have to say. That is all that needs to be said.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This is more than pop music. This is our heritage, our culture, our lives.   Each song wraps you in layers of people/places/memories/times of your life--if you are past a certain age. For the younger crowd, it's a good introduction to Elvis, who transends the pop music scene. And it's great to have all these songs on one CD. Worth the buy to me.
B00000DGUG|5.0|In my opinion.  Jagged Little Pill and Under Rug Swept, although good, are not as good as this one.<br />This is a whole seventeen tracks of pure, uninhibited &quot;kick @ss&quot;.  That's the best way to describe it.  Every single song is extremely different from the next, and there isn't one you want to skip over at all.<br />Front Row - Wonderful way to start off the album.  I love the lyrics, the beats, the harmonies, the production.<br />Baba - I liked this song before I even bought the CD by watching her perform it live on MTV.  This is a fantastic perspective given by Alanis in watching the various people from around the world visit India.<br />Thank U - The first single.  It's so unlike any of her previous songs (with maybe the exception of &quot;Head Over Feet&quot;) because it's optimistic.  And she clearly states that you don't have to be depressed and angsty to write good music.  That is, in fact, her message for the entire album.  And she does it well.<br />Are You Still Mad - Fantastic lyrical composition.  The beginning notes of the piano are similar to those that begin the song &quot;Uninvited&quot;.<br />Sympathetic Character - an explosion, a fury of art.  Like always, her lyrics captivate the mood of the song with the help of the synthesized instruments backing her up.  I love the harmonies... they are so tastefully dissonant.<br />That I Would Be Good - Slow song, great to listen to... very emotional.<br />The Couch - one of my favorites.  It's long, it's repetitive, and it's incredibly interesting.  The lyrics take you on a voyage in the perspective of a man.  Later I found out this song was actually written in her father's perspective.  I highly recommend you listen to this song.<br />Can't Not - slow beats, and the mood changes halfway.<br />UR - if there was one weak song on this album, it's this one.  But not even by far.  It's still a good song, although in my opinion, not as good as the others.<br />I Was Hoping - This one will blow you away.  Again in the perspective of a man.  The lyrics are so innovative and though-provoking.  Another one of my favorites.<br />One - Quite relaxing, although only musically it contrasts from the last song.  Lyrically it's just as fervorous.<br />Would Not Come - Possibly the most far-fetched song of the album.  It's incredibly different than any song she's made before, during, and after this time period.  I'm taking a stab at this, but I think it's about her case of writer's block she suffered through after JLP.<br />Unsent - Another single.  Along with UR, a little on the weak side.  I've noticed that Alanis always puts her weakest songs to be singles.  I agree incredibly with that move.<br />So Pure - Another single.  This song sorta reminds me of Madonna in her early days.  And I love it.  It's so catchy and fun-loving, done with taste, of course.<br />Joining You - Possibly the most emotionally-heavy song on the album.  A real gem and a favorite of mine.  Listen to these words carefully.  You will love this song.<br />Heart of the House - I love the message of this song.  It's about her mother, of course.<br />Your Congratulations - a dissonant way to end the album.  Very simplified, her voice is the most prevalent part.  It's so abstract and raw.  I love the lyrics.<br />Like I said, this is my favorite Alanis album.  It struck me in a way that JLP and URS didn't really.
B000068IEU|3.0|Last house on the Left is a truly sickening movie, not because of gore or splatter effect, but simply because what it shows & what it is about. If you're looking for a shocking & contraversial movie to add to your collection it's a must, but if you're looking for a movie to enjoy, try one of Wes' later movies instead. This one is too revolting to be enjoyable.The story revolves about a couple of psycho's who for no real reason at all decide to abduct, humiliate, rape & then kill 2 young girls. Made in the very dry style of Texas Chainsaw Massacre it is a movie that leaves a definate bitter taste in your mouth. Admittedly the dick chewing scene is rather well done. Not a movie to recommend for anyone but Craven completists, & people looking to own every contraversial movie made. A true Video ( DVD ) Nasty.
1573225517|4.0|Nick Hornby's book is a must-read for any man, woman or child who has ever encountered that fanatical zeal common to musicians and record collectors alike.  Having lived with a musician for years, and having a father with a record collection that is slowly taking over the house, I found this book with it's cast of characters somewhat re-assuring, as well as a damned good read.  I love Nick Hornby, his characters are the Bridget Jones' of the male world: full of insecurities, obsessions and neuroses but ultimately lovable for all of the above.  Read it and laugh.
B00000IOSU|5.0|Last night I played this disc for my brother, who is a Sarah McLachlan fan but was not aware of this disc. We were driving along with the sunroof open on a cool night.<br />He summed it well by saying, \\"You have to hand it to someone who can actually sound better live than recorded. These songs are amazing.\\"<br />This seems to be what occurs when an artist transforms music through the electrifying presence of her fans and her uncanny ability to feel the essence of the music and bring it to fruition in a live setting.<br />This wonderful disc has real staying power. I play it on innumerable mornings when in need of inspiration (most) and it never seems to lose its splendor.<br />I look forward to future live recordings by this astounding musician.
0446530573|5.0|As a Director of Catering I collect a lot of cookbooks. In fact if you like this review you might want to check out my listmania list I have several on cookbooks.<br />Now to my review. This book, in my opinion, is Beautifully put together. Recipes are easy to read with items that are accesible at most grocery stores. The stories throughout the books and little articles that in reference to the series was a excellent idea. This book had so many different little added extras that it was hard for me to remember that this was a fictional family they were speaking of LOL. I especially like the page of top 10 Famous Food scenes in Mob movies it was interesting. The book has recipes from Appetizers to Desserts. No Fuss to a little Elaborate. Pictures are nice and I had the feeling, after reading this book, that I could do many of these recipes even if I wasn't a Director of Catering.<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone that enjoys Italian Food or the Series, in fact I had an idea to do a Gift Basket for Christmas with the DVD's (from the series), this Cookbook, a Sinatra CD and a bottle of Ruffino Chiante what a perfect evening.<br />If you find that you like this style of cookbook, ethnic or because it tells a story along with the recipes also check<br />Van Gogh's Table (the artist life story is throughout the book), and Soul Food: Recipes & Reflections from African-American Churches by Joyce White<br />Respectfully Reviewed
B00006F7S4|5.0|.....eventually this had to happen. After the outrageous &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot;, where could Beck go? &quot;Sea Change&quot; is more layed back than anything Beck has ever released. The tunes were written during a break-up with a long time girlfriend, and they really reflect his feelings at the time ( reminiscent of Dylan's &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;, in a way). Mr. Hanson, who once hip-hopped and falsettoed about robots, junkies, and Christmas in July, has found his introspective side, and let me say, it's lovely. It passes what I call the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; test, which very few artists pass in their careers. This means that Beck has used as many studio resources as he could to get this album perfect.....and it's the closest he's ever come. The best songs are &quot;Golden Age&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Tears&quot;......but there isn't any &quot;filler here, so each track is worth listening to. There won't be any radio play from &quot;Sea Change&quot;, and sales will not be good, I can almost guarantee. Ignore the charts. This is a masterpiece.
B0000025GW|5.0|it was the first & only time i've seen bob dylan in concert, it was @ purdue university, & most of the crowd was whispering \\"if he sings the religious songs, we've leaving\\" & out he comes, the first song YOU GOTTA SERVE SOMEBODY   LOL........no one left & what a great concert this was!!! i love this album, great songs, great rebel feel(for him)
B00005JL78|5.0|these are comments on the movie, not the dvd.  i saw minority report 4 times and i am firmly convinced that it is a truly great film.  it's one of spielberg's best and reaffirms his greatness after the lukewarm ai.  tom criuse gives an impassioned performance as john anderton and samantha morton, in limited screen time, makes an impression as a tortured pre-cog.  needless to say, john williams provides an understated but great score.  spielberg's dp, janusz kaminski, gives the film a color scheme dominated by blues and greys, much like ai.  the editor, michael kahn, provides his most important contribution in the films chilling, suspenseful opening sequense.  probably mismarketed as an action film - don't get me wrong there's action - just not as much as you'd expect from seeing the trailers and commercials, minority report is really a film about destiny - whether or not people have the power to alter thier path.  one minor quibble is i would have liked more discussion on the legality of arresting people before they've committed a crime.  overall, one of steve's best and most powerful films.
B00006J3WH|5.0|when i first saw the musical on UPN i thought \\"i have to get this cd!!\\" too bad for me that i would have to wait a couple of months. but now that i have it i know its worth the wait! sarah michelle gellar has a good singing voice, as do the other actors and actresses. i expecially like something to sing about and under your spell. If you are not a big fan of the show you probably will not like this cd, and if you haven't seen the musical it won't make much sense. But for you fans this is a must have!!
B00006F7S4|5.0|I can't say I've been a very prominent Beck fan, I only own 2 other albums. I've heard most all of them, and can tell you that this is one amazing release. I read one review that pointed out it's 'sample less' non 'radio friendly'-ness as a downpoint. Beck's taken his music back to the core of what it should be all about. These songs are written so well, played so well, produced so well, and I've yet to find anything negative of them. Yes- you won't be dancing along and playing moog to witty hip hop beats, but who cares?<br />If anyone expects an artist to stay the same throughout their entire career, especially holding them to standards of an album that was a big departure of their normal soul, then they really need to stop buying albums :P<br />Sea Change is the last album I've purchased in a long time, and being a big advocate of not paying outrageous prices for music- I can tell you this cd is well worth the dollars and cents.<br />[Take Neil Young, Beck, Cornelius, and the beautifully harmonic orchestra next door- get Sea Change]
B00006F7S4|5.0|This is one of Beck's best records to date! It is simply amazing. This is his heartbreak album so it is pretty mellow, but the acoustic guitars and the string arrangements are very beautiful. His singing is fantastic. The guy is singing with some true feeling on this record. If you're into any good music, just buy this album and listen to it a few times. This movie wont get a party started, but it's perfect for after the party when you get home and just want to relax.
B00005QJDG|5.0|Dream Theater has done it again with another incredible live offering, featuring the last live performance of the entire &quot;Scenes From a Memory&quot; album, a touch of Liquid Tension Experiment, classic songs like &quot;Metropolis Part One&quot; and &quot;Learning to Live&quot;, and the first official release of live versions of &quot;A Mind Beside Itself&quot; and &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot;, both in full form. The third disc doubles as an enhanced CD featuring bonus footage of &quot;Another Day&quot; and Jordan Rudess' Keyboard Solo, plus a link to the trailer for the Metropolis 2000: Scenes From New York video. This album is definately a must-buy for any Dream Theater or progressive rock fan.
B00006J3WH|5.0|If you have not been able to wait for the official CD and have been listening to that downloaded  CD-R then you MUST get this CD! Without the background sound effects and dialogue you are able to understand ALL of the lyrics. Also included with the CD are the lyrics! I have to admit that after listening to the CD-R copy's for so long I do miss the sound of Sweet's(Hilton Battle) tap dancing during &quot;What You Feel&quot;<BR>As a bonus you get Joss and his wife singing on a demo of &quot;Something To Sing About&quot; and scores from some pivotal episodes.  A MUST HAVE for any Buffy fan. Now let's get them to do the DVD I don't want to wait another year for the season six set to arrive.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This newly released cd has unsurpassed sound quality which makes this cd so enjoyable to listen to. &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; has been remixed and sounds like a different version from what was released previously. By that I mean his voice is much louder on it and not drowned out by the music. It's a must for all Elvis fans, you'll love it!
B0000542D2|5.0|Except for the botched audio processing on the music soundtrack of this dvd, its great.  Its no wonder the music industry is dying, with tin eared producers of the likes that worked on this project, I guess it could be a bad dvd run..............not
B000068OSK|5.0|Anyone who likes punk sensibilities in their rock n roll, pick this up.  The Stripes are at the forefront of a new underground explosion that will wash away the sins of the rap rock nu metal sludge.  Some would have you believe Jack is a God, but they need to keep it in their pants.  Worshipping rock stars is what ruined the last great rock movement; some became gods, too many others were forgotten.
B00006F7S4|5.0|there is little here (if anything) to find its way into heavy rotation but is that such a bad thing. Chances are that Sea Change will not draw you in immediately but will require a few listening. Tracks like \\"Guess I'm doing fine\\" and \\"Side of the road\\" show Beck's true vocal capability. This album has affected me more than any of his previous due largely to how well the album works together. It allows you to be lost in the flow, stop listening and start experiencin.  I became a Beck fan with mellow gold but I believe this album will soon become my favorite.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Provehito In Altum<br />translation:<br />\\"Launch forth into the deep\\"<br />30 Seconds To Mars \\"motto\\" explains a lot about them. They are one of the only bands these days that has the courage to \\"launch forth into the deep\\", to step away from the \\"norm.\\" and deliver us a truely fresh and beautiful sound. They deliver what it seems not very many other bands these days have the courage to deliver, through their break out cd they bring a melodic trip through the most interesting and well sounding space age ballads.<br />1) Capricorn - this song starts the CD off with a bang. the moment you hear it start to \\"zoom\\" in you know your about to hop onto a powerful experience. with awesome vocals and a great message about finding a \\"Brand New Name\\" This is the perfect song to start the cd with.<br />2) Edge Of The Earth - another well placed song. this song picks up on the energy Capricorn created right away with a fast paced and excellent sounding song discussing \\"standing out on the edge of the earth\\".<br />3) Fallen - Another awesome ballad on this cd. From the moment the song starts with the emotional drum intro. to the last guitar chord it is a melodic sounding well thought out song.<br />4) Oblivion - an excellently mixed song. This shows how 30 Seconds To Mars can mix all the good things about music today into one great sound. <br />5) Buddha For Mary - By far one of the strangest and most powerful songs on the cd, this one is sure to leave the largest mark on you. The moment the \\"he said...\\" interlude begins, you know this song has more than meets the eye. A definitely interesting experience.<br />6) Echelon - This one takes the cake for the most mystical and \\"tribal\\" sounding song on the cd. Everything from the drums, to the synthesizer use, to the vocals make this song a eery and awesome listen.<br />7) Welcome To The Universe - This song truely shows 30 Seconds To Mars' darker and more lyrically awesome side. The wording and vocals in this song deliver a powerfulmessage and a great listen.<br />8) The Mission - This song definitely pumps up the energy that 30 Seconds To Mars delivers so well. the moment it begins the powerful combination of fast paced music is an awesome choice.<br />9) End Of The Beginning - one of the best \\"all around\\" songs on the cd. This song flat out shows why 30 Seconds To Mars is getting all the praise it deserves, starting out with a powerful guitar riff and continuing with a hard, fast-paced chorus; this song is a keeper and a possible next single for the band.<br />10) 93 Million Miles - 30 Seconds To Mars truely digs down deep in this song. In this they focus away from the \\"catchy\\" tunes and focus on the emotion and feeling behind the music. a definite high-point on the CD.<br />11) Year Zero - The perfect song to end the CD with. After sending you through an awesome experience of fresh music, it ends with one of the hardest most emotional songs on the cd. How fitting the song should state \\"we'll never fade away...\\" because it is such a true statement.<br />After starting out with a spectacular bang on their debut CD 30 Seconds To Mars is a band you will want to check out and will not be the least bit disappointed that you did. So are you sick of the same bands over and over? Each supposedly \\"new\\" Band beginning to sound like the same old [thing]? Well then take a trip to Mars. it's only about, oh, 30 Seconds away :D
B00006AG5N|5.0|If you're a big Elvis fan or want to get your kids to know Elvis, this is definitely the CD to buy.  The amazing remastering of each track is \\"Guaranteed To Blow Your Mind\\"!!<BR>Each track is crystal clear, more bass and amazing clarity not just on the vocals, but the band instruments as well.  You cannot compare this CD to any other Elvis release, THIS IS THE ONE!!  One song I was totally shocked with was \\"Burning Love\\" as all previous releases were flat, but not on this CD, INCREDIBLE DIFFERENCE!!  Conclusion, I highly recommend this CD to everyone.  After 25 years of his death, the King still rocks on and as my title says \\"The Sun Never Sets On A Legend\\".
6305878323|5.0|I saw this movie when I was just a kid and I loved it then. I saw it again now after so many years and I still loved it as much!! This is simply a great classic masterpiece that everyone should see and have!
B000002C1V|2.0|Ok, first, I dont want to hurt anyones sensibility, specially Roger Waters fans, they tend to be hypercritical... (Altough I think this all Gilmour-Waters confrontation is dull as hell and doesn't contribute at all in any aspect...)<br />Im a Pink Floyd fan. That meaning, that I truly aprecciate the band really great albums, those who were a result of a colective sound and are their best. (Excluding The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, which is a complete masterpiece, only contrasted by Sgt Peppers). Wish You Were Here is the clearest example of this, with 4 members working it off and making a true masterpiece of music...<br />So, what happened. My theory is this. (and please respect it and don't bash it if ur beliefs are different). Roger Waters has too much going on inside of him. Mother fixation, father trauma, the world unjustice factor... And in some terms that was really (or is) great. That made Roger lyrics little pieces of jewelry that we all can relate to. His composition levels were great (and are) too, and with Dave, Rick and Nick behind them, they had so much power and become floyd compositions. Tis was the floyd working at full machine. Of course the other guys have some excellent compositions too, but this was an example..<br />But beggining with Animals and finishing with this album, it seems to me that the lyrics overrun the music. That, for me has been Roger Waters problem. He let the lyrics led, forgets about musicianship at all. The oposite thing happens to David Gilmour. While he focus on the music, the lyrics are allright, but not just great.<br />So thats it here. For me, it was a Roger Waters album. Because it didn't sounded like the Floyd anymore, (there are some theories that say that there is not a PF sound...come on!, the atmospheric spacy sound, the guitar work, the lyrics...) it sounded more like an pop orchestra Roger Waters album. I personally don't like his voice, and he knew that in the late 60s and the early 70s... he let the others sing, while he made a right appearence in one or two songs...<br />So, yeah, it was a dissapointing thing for me hearing this. After  Animals (3.5) and the Wall (3), this was Floyd lowest point, and not. Because this was, and not, a Pink Floyd album.<br />The music here is good though, for an average album, but nothing more than a vehicle for the lyrics. And that's why these songs weren't on The Wall. They just not reached the standarts of the band. But Mr. Waters took over, and the rest its history., while he made a right appearence in one or two songs...<br />So, yeah, it was a dissapointing thing for me hearing this.

B000021YQV|5.0|I love this cd!!!! I turly and honestly have never heard something so original and amazing. Serj and Daron have come up with some of the most memorable lyrics of alterna-rock history. Serj's singing is at top form and Daron's guitar mastery astounds me. He is just so GOOD at that insturment. Oh, and Chop Suey...you just cannot play that song enough. If there is one song that never, EVER gets old, it's that one. It simultaneously beats me senseless and rocks with a harmony that is too pretty for words. I thought the first album was incredible...wheew!!! This one breaks the mold. The whole album is flawless. years from now, this will be remembered as THE metal album of the ages.<br />When I became the sun, I shone life into the man's hearts!
B00004RJ74|5.0|Let's face it: the guys who made this gutsy tough guy movie knew they crossed the line in just about every aspect...and from the looks of the outcome, they had a blast and so do we.<BR>Many movies have successfully combined action and horror, the best-made and probably greatest of all being Romero's masterpiece Dawn of the Dead, made in 1979.  Then came 1996, a new era of style, humor, and violence...this was Tarantino's era.<BR>After the incredible Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, Tarantino tried his hand at horror and succeeded.  George Clooney and QT himself play two merciless, totally out of control (but somehow lovable of course) gangsters who find themselves fending off hundreds of vampires in a seedy Mexican club...this is truly the ultimate story of two guys who walked into the wrong bar.<BR>Right from the opening sequence, you just know that anything is possible in this wild, wild movie.  Within the first five minutes, Clooney and Tarantino execute a cop, engage in a shootout with a clerk, and set fire to a building.  There is great dialogue of course, and the camerawork via Robert Rodriguez is amazing; some action scenes in this movie are still unparalled.  The movie is very, very stylish and often completely over the top, and that's what makes it so powerful and enjoyable.  Not for everyone, but for those who love non-stop, hard-hitting action, this movie will blow you away.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Ohmygod! If you love beautiful things, and your heart has leanings for music and art of a quiet, plaintive, heartfelt bent, then please, please, please buy this album! Not since the Cure's DISINTEGRATION have I put on a CD that won't come off until I become saturated with the sound. On the way to work this morning, I rolled up the windows and kept turning up Beck until my world became flooded with gorgeous waves of liquid sadness. I've never experienced a musician who was so utterly fearless. The result is not wallowing like some would have you believe, but rather cathartic and uplifting. I wouldn't trade it for anything right now...
B000068TPN|2.0|In the first conflict between the US and North Vietnamese, a few hundred troopers found themselves hopelessly encircled by over 2,000 NVA troops, and ultimately smashed their way out with a suicidal charge straight into enemy ranks.  Great war story, poor movie.<BR>Gibson's performance as Moore is excellent, but most of the movie is the action that took place at Landing Zone X-Ray and the knoll in which several soldiers found themselves pinned down.  Except for some disgusting moments (skin slipping off of flesh, people being burned alive, etc.) aided by excellent visual effects, there really is nothing new here.  The gory action is surprisingly lackluster and routine, especially when compared to the sheer intensity of Saving Private Ryan and the brilliantly-photographed all out chaos of Black Hawk Down.  <BR>Another complaint is the pointless scenes of the wives back home, which serve no purpose other than to try a jerk a few tears.  Portraying grieving wives in this type of war movie, which is basically about survival, is totally innapropriate.<BR>Of course there's the flagwaving and cliched talk amongst the troops which is fairly standard nowadays, and that detracts from the realism and brutality.  It's as if the director didn't know which movie to make: a shocking ground level view of combat or a Pearl Harbor-style teen flick.  Very uneven.  <BR>If you want the ultimate war story about troops who are outnumbered, outgunned, and emerge victorious despite overwhelming odds, see Ridley Scott's 'Black Hawk Down.'  For a great all-around war movie, watch Spielberg's Private Ryan.  For a great Vietnam movie, watch either Hamburger Hill (very realistic and gritty, not in the least bit flowery) or Kubrick's brilliant 'Full Metal Jacket.'
6300181278|4.0|For all lovers of vampires and Bram Stoker, please note that this film is \\"based on the novel.\\"  It does not go word for word and does not even have all the characters or events.  The connections between people are not the same.  Universal adapted this so that it could be shown as a movie in just over an hour.  Because of this, fans of the novel will be a little dismayed.<br />Briefly, some of the differences are the change in relationships and character roles.  In the novel, Renfield went to see Dracula before the novel starts.  Here, he is the one who meets Dracula and brings him to England.  Jonathan Harker never meets the count professionally, but he is betrothed to Mina.  However, Mina is Mina Seward rather than Mina Murray.  Seward is still a psychiatrist, but apparently has no connection to Dr. Van Helsing.  Lucy has no betrothed as there is no Lord Godalming.<br />All that aside, this is still a good movie.  Knowing that the movie had to be condensed, I think the writers did a good job.  My hat is off to whoever cast Bela Lugosi.  His accent and mannerisms give us the known image of Dracula.  Although it does not match historical record or the novel, Bela is Dracula.  There is no gore, but the black and white film works well with lights and shadows to help create a spooky and mesmerizing atmosphere.<br />I would recommend this for a collection and for casual viewing.
B00006J3WH|5.0|When I saw this CD in my local music store yesterday, I almost had a heart attack.  I've waited so long for this to arrive, and now that it has, it was totally worth the wait.  Joss Whedon is a GOD!  He is an amazingly talented man, and deserves every little bit of pride he takes in writing the episode.  <br />The actors have amazing voices.  Its incredible that such talented people keep on surprising us.  Sarah Michelle Gellar has a wonderful voice.  James Marsters is so understated I can't stand it.  His voice is so powerful and he takes my breath away everytime I hear &quot;Rest in Peace&quot;.  That song is my personal favorite, along with Walk Through the Fire, and Where Do We Go From Here.  I also appreciate the fact that they included some of Christophe Beck's composings from &quot;Restless&quot;, &quot;Hush&quot; and &quot;The Gift&quot;.  He is amazing as well as the others.  If you truly love &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, then I highly recomend you buy this CD.  It's a must for Buffy fans.
B0000047CW|4.0|Bought this on a whim and if you like &quot;chill&quot; and the current interest in Bossa Nova, then this is a great choice.  The drums and percussion can sound a little cliche but that isn't the fault of a record from several decades ago.  The skills of the musicians more than make up for the brevity of the CD -- it is I believe only 36 minutes long.  Just know that it will sometimes sound like &quot;your parent's kind of music.&quot;
B00006AG5N|1.0|I just want to make a statement by saying Elvis is NOT the King of Rock and Roll. He could not write songs and play instruments so competently as the Great Chuck Berry or Little Richard. He lacked the power and soul of James Brown. His singing was little less than mediocre.<BR>This CD is better than most rock albums of the times, but afterall it represents the first ever pop Muzak, the world's greatest imitator of pure R&amp;R music.
B000068QY7|3.0|The melodies aren't really there and the extended rock-outs aren't really there either.  What really hurts is the non-memorable lyrics.  No Oasis CD is perfect, but this one is 100% forgettable -- bummer. It sounds OK, but that's about all one can say good about it.
B00005UEAR|5.0|In short, disk 1 is some of the heaviest playing in Dream Theater;s career, amazing stuff.  Disk 2 is completly different and is a classic and will stand the test of time. If you are reading this, you love DT, what are you waiting for??? get it. I can not even explain disk 2, it defies explanation, If you are new to DT, get this as well as Scenes from a Memory which is also a concept album and equally great!!!
B00001OH7P|5.0|This remastered Ziggy, is fantastic.  I think between me and my brother, we've must have worn out 2 or 3 copies of the LP playing it at parties back in the early 70's.<br />This has NEVER sounded better.  Almost brings tears to my eyes flashing back to all the good times we had!!<br />I recently saw Bowie at the Moby Area 2 in Detroit, where he played 5 years, and for his last song, a Nut Ripping rendition of Ziggy Stardust.<br />You won't be disapointed with this Remaster
B00004ZD69|4.0|Drop everything and listen to this ambient, atmospheric,instrumental, orchestrated, dark, lovely, beautiful album.  This is some of the most original music that has been recorded in a long time.  Instrumental madness.  How does one start to write these passages???? Beautiful
B00006AG5N|2.0|Why, oh why, do certain marketing-oriented people keep &quot;messing&quot; with Elvis's voice? Newcomers won't know the difference. But what justification is that? The fact is that most  Elvis CDs since 1992 have sounded great. His voice has been remastered without artifice or re-equalization or other effects.<br />And his voice has such a great sound, such perfect timbre. It can be high and delicate, a growl or a snarl, deep and resonant, and all of these at once.<br />But on this new CD, the one RCA hopes will become their all-time big seller, the original masters have been remixed and re-equalized with two dominant effects: (a) a greater sense of &quot;presence&quot; to Elvis's breath, and to brushes and the snare - a kind of bright, snappy sound that will crackle out of lo-fi systems; and (b) an overall tinny, hollow, empty sound to everything else that robs every single track of that solid center it has always had. <br />Where is that deep bass that introduces &quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot;? Why does &quot;One Night&quot; sound so tinny? How come everything has just a little too much  reverb? The jerks who took it upon themselves to &quot;improve&quot; these records should be forever consigned to Rock &amp; Roll purgatory!<br />Instead of this disc, do yourself a favor and pick up &quot;Artist of the Century&quot; for the best selections covering his whole career or &quot;24 Karat Hits!&quot; (remastered by Steve Hoffman) for the absolutely best-sounding Elvis CD on earth.
B00003CXCD|5.0|Very good movie. like the seen at the wall of truth . putting hand in mouth and it will be bitten off if you lie, That part with Peck putting his hand in that mouth and her reaction was rea;. he told director he was going to do that. caught Audrey hepburn off guard. she was not acting that part...lol Audrey Hepburn one of the prettiest stars i have ever seen inmovies
B00006AG5N|5.0|I received my CD 1 day before the &quot;official&quot; release date.  Since that, I've played little else at home.  All of the songs are remastered so clearly that they sound as if they were recorded today!  The addition of &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; makes this an excellent value with all of Elvis' other timeless hits.  If you love Elvis, you can't miss with this one!
B00006AG5N|5.0|This is the greatest music collection of all time.  It has many of the greatest hits from the greatest entertainer in history.  A few people (very few) are critical of Elvis and his contributions, but you can't argue with facts.  He continues to sell albums 25 years after his death,and it's because of packages like this. Not many of his peers can claim to do the same.<BR> The clarity and crispness of Elvis' vocals and the #1's chosen make the man as relevant today as he was 48 years ago.  I advise anyone interested in great music to pick this up immediately. <BR> By the way, what does it say about a singers greatness and influence when the people who compiled this album had to \\"Limit\\" the #1's to just 31???
B00003CXI1|5.0|I LOVED THE MOVIE ALMOST AS MUCH AS THE BOOKS. AS SOON AS IT WAS FOR SALE I BOUGHT THE DVD FOR MY OWN COLLECTION, IT IS A KEEPER. A CORNER OF MY LIVING ROOM IS DEVOTED TO HARRY. I CAN HARDLY WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT MOVIE IS OUT. MY BIRTHDAY IS NOV 11TH SO WHEN THE NEXT MOVIE IS OUT ON THE 15TH, IT WILL BE LIKE A BELATED BIRTHDAY PRESENT. I HAVE SEEN A PREVIEW OF IT AND IT LOOKS AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, PRODUCERS, DIRECTORS AND STARS.
B000002C1W|2.0|There is a reason why my rating of this album is low.  It's because the powers that be (lawyers, business people, etc.) decided to call it a Pink Floyd album.  There have been many reviews stating things like \\"give it a chance\\" or \\"don't listen to what people say\\".  If this recording were originally presented to us as a David Gilmour solo album, or just an album of a band whose members included Gilmour, Mason and Wright, then I would have given it perhaps three or four stars.  It's not a \\"bad\\" album.  It's just not a Pink Floyd album.  The drum work of Nick Mason is its usual solid and dependable.  The keyboard playing of Rick Wright is, as always, subtle and jazzy.  The guitar work of David Gilmour is magnificent.  Yes.  It's really, really good.  Gilmour's guitar phrasings and, most importantly, soloing, are in perfect form.  His vocals are also quite good.  Still, Pink Floyd as an idea, as a mode and style of music is completely missing from this album.  However hard it tries, it's not there at all.  Yes, there will never be another Dark Side, or Wish You Were Here.  But, when, say, Animals came out, people didn't shout, \\"it's not Wish You Were Here!\\"  They didn't have to.  Animals was pure Floyd, just as The Wall was.  Just as was every other album that had Roger Waters in its make-up.  Those albums stood by themselves while still retaining whatever it was that made them a Pink Floyd album.  I recommend A Momentary Lapse of Reason to people who like good rock and roll guitar.  Other than that, I would advise against buying it.
B000002IST|3.0|It was clear from the first listen that this album was the end of the road for Genesis. They went out of their way to record several long songs for this one--the type of song that originally brought the old die-hard fans to the band, before they became a pop group. But...the long, \\"Genesis-style\\" songs on this album all sound tired and hackneyed, while the pop songs are inspired! The catchiest pieces here are the televangelist satire \\"Jesus He Knows Me\\" and \\"Tell Me Why\\", about the persistence of world hunger, with Mike Rutherford playing electric 12-string like Roger McGuinn on the latter. \\"I Can't Dance\\" reminds me of the Rolling Stones (the guitar part smacks of the opening to \\"Honky Tonk Women\\"), something I've never said about a Genesis song before. \\"No Son of Mine\\", about a guilt-wracked survivor of child abuse, the ballad \\"Never a Time\\", and \\"Way of the World\\" all have their charms.<br />Meanwhile, it seems that Genesis had forgotten how to write long songs. The best of the lot is \\"Dreaming While You Sleep\\", about a hit-and-run driver whose victim lies in a coma, but there are half a dozen songs on the album better than this one. \\"Living Forever\\" and \\"Fading Lights\\" both have lyrics about mortality, which in hindsight can be applied to the band. \\"Fading Lights\\" is redeemed only by a spooky, octave-sliding synthesizer sound Tony Banks uses during the solo (so good he used the same sound on \\"There Must Be Some Other Way\\" on the \\"Calling All Stations\\" CD). \\"Living Forever\\" is just mediocre. The nadir is \\"Driving the Last Spike\\", a decent four-minute song stretched into an interminable 10-minute epic on the building of England's railroads -- every time Phil Collins sings \\"Can you hear me?\\", you think THIS is the moment when this song is finally going to take off, but each time the band backs off from the building intensity. The song is a collection of bad songwriting decisions, capped off by Banks' wimpiest keyboard solo since \\"Your Own Special Way\\", which is played twice for no apparent reason.<br />If you liked the pop-oriented Genesis of the '80s, you will probably like this album, because there are several good pop songs here. But there is also evidence of a band in decline, and even among the pop songs, there are clunkers: the formulaic \\"Hold on My Heart\\" and the maudlin \\"Since I Lost You\\", inspired by the death of Eric Clapton's (a friend of Collins) young son. Collins left Genesis after this album, and Banks and Rutherford went on to make the mediocre \\"Calling All Stations\\" album before shutting the band down.<br />(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal)
B00005QW4K|5.0|It's understandable why they didn't just call this Evil Dead 3 -- they just about toss the horror movie idea out the window and instead give us a comedy with hilarious demon-stomping, non-stop action, and undead slapstick. This flick takes the gore and comedy of the first 2 installments of this horror trilogy and mix in sword and sorcery-style action. Ash, now a supermarket employee (\\"Shop smart... shop S-Mart\\"), is transported with his 1988 Oldsmobile to a medieval world by the powers of a mysterious book. Armed with a shotgun, his high school chemistry textbook, and a chainsaw that mounts where his missing hand was, Ash finds himself as a besieged kingdom's best hope against an \\"army of darkness\\" currently plaguing the land. The skeleton warriors have been resurrected with the aid of the Necronomicon, which is the same book that can send Ash back home. Ash agrees to go in search of the book. Along the way, he finds romance of a sort with Sheila (Embeth Davidtz) a beautiful damsel in distress (who gets \\"real ugly\\"), and fights with his double after mangling the spell he is supposed to say to safely recover the book.<BR>            <BR>An excellent tongue-in-cheek horror film that's loosely a sequel to the cult favorite Evil Dead pictures. Bruce Campbell seemed to have a bunch of fun with this one from playing Gulliver with a dozen of his miniature selves to doing a Three Stooges routine with a bunch of skeleton arms sticking out of the ground. There aren't really any scary parts in this flick, though. Every time something almost frightening happens, Ash turns it into a comedic moment with one of his many one-liners and quick comebacks.<BR>                  <BR>Be sure to check out The Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2.
B00006AFUR|5.0|This new 30 Seconds to Mars cd is awsome!! It has a different kind of rock sound. Thats what makes this cd so unique. Jared Leto knew what he was doing when he wrote the songs. The rest of the band is awsome too! I saw them perform live and the band is awsome! So if you wanna hear a new kind of rock sound you gotta pick up the 30 seconds to mars cd.
B00000DQSS|4.0|Mmmm how to describe 'Never Forever.' Neally as difficult as trying to describe any Kate Bush album. I think the best word is 'whimsical' but that's only half the story.<br />Lyrically this album is almost perfect, touching on a range of topics that can only be a result of a vivid and very left of centre imagination. 'Babooshka' is about a wife who tests her husband's faith by writing him letters pretending to be a seductive young woman. 'All We Ever Look For' revolves around the standards we impose upon ourselves and others. 'The Wedding List' evokes a scenario in which a bride clevery combines a wedding list with a murder list. 'Infant Kiss' is VERY twisted: a woman tries to suppress sexual feelings towards a small infant, 'Army Dreamers' laments the wasted human life in war, and 'Breathing' is about trying to live through but slowly dying from nuclear fallout. Not very typical stuff really is it.<br />Musically, although mostly I really enjoy this album, it seems to pale compared to 'The Dreaming' which I believe takes ideas from this albums and takes them to greater levels. And while 'The dreaming' is layered and dense, some of the songs on here seem to float and fluff around. I've never been a big fan of the way Kate does ballads, and 'Blow Away' 'All We Ever Look For' and 'The Infant Kiss' all have that classic broadway musical quality, kinda airy without having a big emotional drive to them. I much prefer the raunchier driving numbers like 'Babooshka' 'Violin' and 'The Wedding List' (this REALLY should have been a single.) And I find 'Delius'and 'Egypt' odd but fascinating. With my obsession with 'The Dreaming Album' the last two tracks really seem to form the blueprints for that album. 'Army Dreaming' combines a quirky medievil jingle with sampled army noises, but although I really like the song it seems a bit lacking of structure in the melody department, a minor problem for a bit of the album actually. The last song however, 'Breathing' wow...no words forit. Haunting, innovative, dramatic and grandoise, close to the best she's ever done I believe. If the rest of the album is sometimes up and down, than this song alone deserves 2 billion out of 5 stars.<br />So in conclusion, very original and interesting material, just that sometimes it pales when compared to 'The Dreaming' which I feel matches this album in intent but pushes the musical ambitions to further brilliant horizons. Reccomended
B00005R8FI|5.0|I saw this particular lineup in concert, and the album was never a disappointment. Perhaps the trouble Mayall had keeping musicians (Peter Green, Eric Clapton...) was a good thing, because he spread wealth to the music world like a Johnny Appleseed.<br />He also got to take this short-staffed drumless outfit on the road for an eye-n-ear opening tour. Wonderful, slow bluesy stuff, with the occasional upbeat number. Johnny Almond's work on tenor and alto sax is especially good.<br />One final point: Pay no attention to the reviewer who wishes the lyrics were deleted. What would the blues be, if it wasn't about wanting to get laid in town after town...

B0000542D2|1.0|The DVD transfer has been done at the wrong speed.  The dialogue doesn't suffer too much, but the songs are slow and, consequently, at the wrong pitch.<br />I recommend that you don't buy this DVD set.  I'm returning my copy.
B00005JKDR|5.0|The creators of the animated blockbuster \\"Toy Story\\" open the door to a whole new world of imagination in the very funny animated fantasy \\"Monsters, Inc\\". In the amazing world of Monstropolis, James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) are the top-notch scare duo of Monsters, Inc. When an unsuspected human child crosses over to their world, Sullivan and Mike must keep their new guest a secret and learn that humans aren't that scary. \\"Monsters, Inc\\" is the fourth animated movie produced by Pixar Animation Studios. The 2001 animated blockbuster is an inventive and delightful family comedy with a superb voice cast and incredible animation. The story is original, funny and appealing for all audiences. The computer animation is simply groundbreaking. John Goodman and Billy Crystal deliver great comic performances. The voice cast also includes Steve Buscemi, John Ratzenberger, Jennifer Tilly and Academy Award winner James Coburn. \\"Monsters' Inc\\" won the Academy Award for Best Song.<br /><br />Disney dishes out one monstrous DVD. The animated blockbuster is presented in both THX-certified 1.85:1 widescreen and standard full screen formats. The DVD contains an exceptionally sharp picture quality with bright colors and a positively excellent Dolby Digital 5.1-EX sound. This fully-loaded 2-disc DVD includes audio commentary with directors Pete Docter and Lee Unkrich and executive producers, several deleted scenes, very funny outtakes, multiple behind-the-scenes featurettes in the production of \\"Monsters, Inc.\\", the amusing animated short \\"Mike's New Car\\" and sneak peeks of upcoming Disney movies. The interactive DVD menus are very appealing. With its impressive viewing quality and enjoyable features, \\"Monsters, Inc\\" scores a solid \\"A\\".
B00006F7S4|5.0|If you liked Beck's Mutations, which I immensely enjoyed, then you'll most likely enjoy this album as well.  Some may call the music &quot;depressing&quot;...and these will probably be the same people who expected another Odelay when Mutations was released.<BR>  <BR>Musicians such as Beck evolve, and their fans (hopefully?) grow with them.  His latest album certainly isn't another Midnight Vultures or Odelay.  It's not even another Mutations, but it may be the closest Beck album to it!  Yet this shouldn't deter anyone from enjoying the music on this latest album.  Simply be realistic--don't expect sugar-sweet-sappy music when listening to this album for the first time.  <br />Some may find the music depressing, others will find it more thought-provoking and...well, refreshingly &quot;real.&quot;<BR>same way Mutations was
B00006F83Y|5.0|Ok, this review really isn't meant to be terribly helpful, since I am not claiming to know anything about music, but I do know what I like, and I love this CD. I first started listening to QOTSA a year or so ago, and was thrilled when I saw the new video for \\"No One Knows.\\" I love their music, it's so unique, catchy without being pop, and true rock without being dreary and boring. The entire band is highly talented, and, at the risk of sounding juvenile, Josh Homme has simply got the coolest sounding voice I have heard in a long time. And it is soooo fantastic to see, er, hear Dave Grohl on drums again. That alone makes them deserve five stars. Standout tracks in my opinion are \\"No One Knows\\", \\"The Sky is Fallin',\\" \\"First it Giveth,\\" and \\"Go With the Flow\\".
B0000542D2|3.0|First--A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is truly one of the greatest *movies* ever filmed, let alone one of the best musicals or the Beatles' best film.  It's a must-own for any music fan or fan of good film.<br />Having said that, Miramax has almost completely ruined this release.  No trailers for the movie, no outtakes (\\"You Can't Do That\\" was available on the documentary of the same name), no Director's Commentary, no \\"I'll Cry Instead\\" prologue from 1981, and no mono soundtrack.  And believe me, with this horribly remixed pseudo-stereo, echo-enhanced soundtrack, you're going to desperately want a mono soundtrack.  On the up side, the images are super: crisp, clear and gorgeous B&W.  And the interviews are interesting, but not likely to be watched more than once or twice by anyone other than a devoted fan.  (But why wasn't Victor Spinetti interviewed extensively?!)<br />Strong warning:  Buyers beware.  This DVD could have and SHOULD have been so much better.  The three stars are for the movie only, NOT the DVD packaging.  You might want to hold out for a later release.
B000000W6X|4.0|With `BLUE LINES', MASSIVE ATTACK had come up with this unique brand of `Birt - pop', mixed with `electronic' and a heavy chunk of classic soul vocals, which gave a distinctive sound to the band, which was later categorized as `trip - hop'. This very very British outfit, with a heavy `black' influence and unemotional sound gave dance music a new, darker and more serious facet. <BR>Though predominantly stoic, `BLUE LINES' had a great deal of positivity and hope. With `PROTECTION', all hope is lost. As a matter of fact, this can be described as a `lost' album. `BLUE LINES' reeked of this attitude of believing in the light at the end of the tunnel. With `PROTECTION', there neither the tunnel, nor the light to look forward to. Also, there is no despair. Let me say, it is just too numb to worry about everything around it. To put it plainly, it is STOLID. <BR>`BLUE LINES' had SHARA NELSON, giving vocals and exuberance to majority of the songs. `PROTECTION' has `white' vocals, with TRACEY THORN replacing SHARA. As a result, the sound of the album has all the chillness of Britain rather than the warmth of Africa, as was the case with `BLUE LINES'. The track with which the album kicks off with, the title track, is an eight minute odyssey which leaves the listener lost, cold and wet in the pouring rain. `KARMACOMA', undoubtedly the best track of the album, is the song of psychopaths. This gloomy, slow - paced dance number, with heavy `Indian' influences, leaves the person chilled by `PROTECTION', shivering and quivering with fright. Some room for pun... The third song is called `THREE', but what else? NICOLETTE does the honors with her sleazy singing, adding her own brand of sensuousness to the impassiveness of this L.P. `WEATHER STORM' is a piece of `pipe music', just the kind of a song to enjoy when you are having a nice meal in a cozy, comfortable hotel, with your `date', which matters you the most. `SPYING GLASS' is the only song in the album, which has traces of  `BLUE LINES', and HORACE ANDY in it. Coming back to the chill, `BETTER THINGS' and `EUROCHILD' make the atmosphere grim again, after the warmth of  `SPYING GLASS'. If one thought there is not enough of sleaze in the album, just wait for `SLY'. NICOLETTE can be as lewd and sexy as she wants to be, anytime. With NICOLETTE, harmonizing with the music, `SLY' is no less sensual than any other song sung by her. `HEAT MISER' is just a great melodious instrumental number, where the vocalists in the album take a breather. Last, but definitely the least, `LIGHT MY FIRE', is unnecessary filler. The album could have very well done without it. Yes, it is a cover version of THE DOORS' song. This version, however, is a desecration of the original one, and spoils the mood of this beautifully crafted work of songs.<BR>Restrained, unattached, glum, however this album maybe, but one thing is for sure; gloom is good!!
B00005JKDR|5.0|And it's fully enjoyable for grown ups too!  <BR>I've worked in day care for years and have seen how kids react to differnt kinds of books and movies, how they play and how they understand things (or try to) and Monstors Inc. has it just right.

B000000W6X|4.0|This album is often derided as the only misstep in the distinguished career of Massive Attack. True, it is not as immediate as &quot;Blue Lines&quot; or as coherent as &quot;Mezzanine&quot;, but &quot;Protection&quot; has an allure all its own. That the songs don't seem to fit together is part of the album's charm and appeal. Tracy Thorn kicks off the festivities with the epic title track, giving voice to one of the most poignant and evocative love (or is it anti-love) songs ever recorded. As is always the case with MA, the production is stellar and a harbinger of things to come (Thorn also turns up on the pleasant, but bland \\"Better Things\\"). 3-D and a pre-solo career Tricky share rapping duties on the harrowing \\"Karmacoma\\", a stark, head nodding blend of rap and reggae. Billie Holliday sound alike, Nicolette takes over vocals on \\"Three\\", seamlessly navigating the song's watery groove. Scottish composer/producer Craig Armstrong makes the first of three appearances on this album with \\"Weather Storm\\". It's not MA's strongest track, but it succeeds in creating a late night, quiet storm vibe. Elsewhere, Armstrong, conducts the strings on the amazing \\"Sly\\" (a Jungian tale sung with appropriate mysticism and mystery by Nicolette); and tickles the ivories on the new agish \\"Heat Miser\\". Tricky and 3-D return to the mic on the sleek, city song \\"Eurochild\\". MA regular Horace Andy appears on the sinewy \\"Spying Glass\\" (a reworking of his own tune \\"Spy Glass\\"), and the album closing live cover of the Doors' \\"Light My Fire\\". In both instances, his vocal stylings are a perfect compliment to MA's reggae-oriented dance jams. Following up a masterpiece like &quot;Blue Lines&quot; was always going to be tricky (no pun intended); but with the all-over-the-map &quot;Protection&quot;, MA managed to move forward without sacrificing any of their originality or spirit.

B000000WHX|4.0|It's interesting to view this album through the lens of history. Whether aware of it or not, most music fans are quite familiar with Massive and the long shadow they've cast over pop music. But 11 years ago, the mix of musical styles that would later come to be termed (somewhat simplistically) trip-hop was new and invigorating. Listening to it in 2002, &quot;Blue Lines&quot; has the effect of taking you back to the year of your choice: 1975 (\\"Be Thankful For What You've Got\\"), 1988 (\\"Daydreaming\\"); 1991 (\\"Lately\\"). Yet, this album is no retro piece. Instant classics like \\"Safe From Harm\\", \\"Unfinished Sympathy\\", and \\"Five Man Army\\" herald new approaches to hip-hop and dance music in particular, and pop music in general.
1878424319|5.0|I'm going on my 9'th treck through Don Miguel Ruiz's \\"4 agreements\\".  This book was written for those who find life to be an endless cycle of self-abuse.  If you truly believe that you go through each day without emotional trauma, don't pick up this book.  \\"Idle ramblings\\" \\"foolish determinism\\" are concepts that can easily be thrown at this book.  Those who don't find themselves searching for guidance, but stumble upon this book, will find it sensational... It can be the answer, or a butt of a synical quip.  I hope you aren't the latter.
B000069HKH|5.0|Two things happened to make THE RISING one of Bruce Springsteen's best albums ever: He reunited with his E Street Band, and the 9/11 tragedy occurred. Many of the songs were inspired by the tragedy, but \\"Lonesome Day\\", \\"Further On (Up The Road)\\", and the title track could just as easily be about anyone trying to keep well in the face of a difficult present and troubled personal past. \\"Mary's Place\\", on the other hand, is a great little party tune that provides a refreshing bit of joy among the weightier fare. This is a great album that we've been waiting for since THE RIVER. When you consider Springsteen's advocacy of sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's recent trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist, this CD/cassette becomes an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B0000542D2|3.0|OK, here goes. The rantings of a musical purist, in what I hope reads somewhat like a review.<br />The supplemental materials on both discs are very well done. Some goodies from the previous DVD edition are missing, however (see below). Especially enlightening were the Klaus Voormann and George Martin interviews.<br />And the film is in WIDESCREEN! FINALLY! This Beatles geek was very excited to re - experience the new reissue of the film that many years ago changed his life.<br />And then, I heard the familiar opening suspended chord to the title song. I knew immediately the something was not right.<br />I was stunned to hear a chorus/flange effect over the entire music track. Not just on the guitars, but EVERYTHING. Cymbals, vocals, all of it. Nothing subtle at all about this effect, in the way it swoops through the frequencies. All the Beatles songs appear to be treated to the same sweeping chorus noise. For this musician, it took some of the enjoyment out of seeing the film again. <br />I stopped the DVD and rechecked my english audio options: 5.1 surround. No stereo mix is available on this DVD. My question then is, who OK'd this audio remaster? Why isn't there a 2 Channel mix available, or even (gulp) the original MONO?<br />For comparison, I put in my older MPI DVD version in the player. Stereo, punchier remix. Alas, the video on it is only reformatted for TV. Few extras on it, but I'll take that MPI's 2 channel music/dialogue mix over this new anniversary edition 5.1.<br />It would have been nice for Miramax/Buena Vista to have included the deleted concert track (You Can't Do That) or the '82 Reissue Prologue (I'll Cry Instead). Maybe it's on the DVD rom portion, I have not accessed it yet.<br />All in all, I believe that the supplemental material is what will keep me busy with this DVD. I'm indeed very disappointed with the audio remix of the film itself. In my mind, what should have been a 5 star reissue of the film itself, is now an average 3.<br />Tim Longfellow<br />Typhoon Productions<BR>Norton, OH
B00005JKCH|5.0|This is the Best Comic Book movie since the first Batman. Get it. And the chick in the move is in a wet dress and you get to see some \\"stuff\\" if you know what I mean.. huh huh huh
B00006J3WH|5.0|I was eagerly anticipating this album's release, and it was worth every penny. If you enjoyed the musical, it is well worth buying to get the full versions of each song, the lyrics, and great liner notes from Joss.<br />What was a very pleasant surprise was the music from &quot;Restless&quot;, &quot;Hush&quot;, and &quot;The Gift.&quot; I had forgotten just how good the score was for those episodes- and I'm loving the disk that much more for including these tracks. All in all- a big thumbs up.
B00006AG5N|5.0|The sound mix on this new cd is the best I've heard yet from the Elvis Empire.  I hope they re-do the whole Elvis catalog with the much improved sound quality.  I do have a few complaints though.  They should have stuck with the original versions of \\"Fool Such As I\\" and \\"The Wonder of You\\" and saved the alternate takes for later \\"Essential Elvis\\" Cd's.  After all, it was the \\"original\\" versions that hit #1 and not these \\"alternate\\" takes that do not improve upon the original.   And though I like \\"Wooden Heart\\" on a children's cd, it doesn't belong in this selection.  Also, \\"Crying In The Chapel\\" is a great song that better suits a gospel selection.  What this CD really needs is \\"I Got Stung\\", \\"I Want You, I Need You, I Love You\\" and \\"Little Sister\\".  Then it would be a 6 Star CD.  In regards to the last reviewer who kind of hinted that Elvis stole everything from rock and roll legends, Little Richard and Chuck Berry, I would recommend that he  actually listens to this collection.  Elvis really doesn't sound anything like these guys. Elvis did credit them and other bluesmen for having an influence on his music, along with Hank Snow, Hank Williams, and Dean Martin.  Chuck Berry was influenced by Big Band Music.  And the beat goes on..........
B000068OCS|5.0|I'd never seen this movie before, so I can't echo the complaints of those who say the movie has been cropped in some way..<br />I had been waiting almost 2 years to see this movie, having heard the Philip Glass soundtrack and instantly falling in love with it, especially \\"The Grid\\".<br />In spite of my high expectations, the movie still blew me away.  Yes, its anti- modern society is repetitive and its presentation of that theme one-sided, but that doesn't mean it can't have an impact.  I have never seen a movie like this (except the less striking Powaqqatsi), and the only thing I can compare the climax to is Requiem for a Dream.. it is absolutely gripping and horrifying.  <br />I'm not sure some of the images of this movie will ever fade from my memory.. a challenging film (the beginning, let's face it, is a little boring, but necessarily so), but an unforgettable one.
B00005RDRO|5.0|It's been over 10 years since I saw this movie.  I was glad to see it had reached DVD and just had to snatch a copy up.  Althought the sound quality is not what I am used to.  No DTS or even 5.1 here.  <BR>     The picture is very clear on my 55\\" Mitsubishi.  If you want a good time classic with a bucket of popcorn, then this is your movie.
B00006674X|5.0|Change of Habit not only fits the movie in a story context, but also Elvis personally as well.  A real acting role that doesn't rely on songs - Change of Habit.  Elvis last acting role - Change of Habit.  Elvis preparing to begin touring again - Change of Habit.  I'd say Change YOUR habit about thinking all Elvis movies as silly thin plots used to promote songs, and buy this movie, it's great.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I will keep this short because the gentleman 2 reviews before me summed up my thoughts very well.  This album absolutely blew me away.  It is beautiful and soothing and shows great depth for Beck as a muscian.  I enjoy how the entire album flows together so well from track to track forming an entire experience that should be enjoyed as a whole.  I think fans of Beck's previous releases as well as people who have never cared for Beck should do themselves a favor and purchase this outstanding albumn.  In my humble opinion it is the best release yet this year, and it will take a surprise for it to be knocked off that pedestal in my eyes.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Finally, the best album of 2002 -- and one you'll probably never hear... This concept album would have never made my collection had I not heard the band open for Puddle of Mudd in Seattle a month ago... full of energy and passion, the album will not dissapoint.
B000002KIE|4.0|THE seminal punk album.I shudder to think at the acreage of rain forest that has been felled as a result of the endless reviews and theses on this one album. And don't bother asking dear old Johnny Rotten....no, Lydon...oh, alright then, I need the money, Rotten, for the truth. You just know he's only going to tell you whatever he thinks you don't want to hear.<BR>The Pistols were bloody awful live and that's a fact. Of course they weren't at their best on the US tour, what with the band imploding and the audience experiencing an insurmountable dgree of culture shock. But that wasn't a one off. They were appalling at pretty much every European appearance that I witnessed. This studio album, however, is a very different affair. I doubt there's anyone who isn't familiar with at least one of the tracks. The production is competent and the content is really quite pleasant....good old fashioned \\"three chords and a lot of energy\\" Rock'n'Roll, with a bit of bad language. The threat of the Sex Pistols was always a visual one (although how anybody could feel threatened by acne-blitzed Rotten or Sid Vicious, the man with the least accurate name in the history of the world, has always been beyond me).It's still a very listeneable album 25 years on. The gobbing punks have become Merchant Bankers and, unfortunately, \\"Never Mind......\\" is little more than a historical novelty. Buy it. The world will never see their like again.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Mr. Whedon never ceases to amaze me!  Been waiting on this for a while, listening to my own little 'bootleg' copy.  This was DEFINITELY worth the wait.  Thank you Joss, for giving me 'something to sing about!'
B00005QDW1|4.0|No Doubt, always reinventing themselves, do a great job with this album.  I don't really know of a track that I do not enjoy on this whole CD.  Underneath it All is a hit, and Gwen's vocals are tremendous throughout the whole album.  There is definitely a salsa/reggae feel with guest vocals from some Islanders that add depth and soul not seen on other No Doubt albums.  This album is worth having in your collection, and I do not regret buying it.  I recommend this without reservation to any No Doubt fan, or someone who wants up beat pop that is not boy-band influenced.
B00005JKDR|3.0|Pretty nice story that kept me interested throughout the entire 93minutes.  Don't have kids but enjoy the Disney approach to morals and life and diversity.  Neat computer grafics and different technique from Toy Story [the makers are the same - hence the two are often compared].  <BR>Nevertheless to give it more than 3 stars would mean it needed a little more pep to it to keep me entertained.  Amazing is the 2nd DVD - 207min of add-on material.  One can certainly get lost in all the material hidden behind any of the doors.  I wished they had showm more about the actual sound making and speech overlay.  Especially of that of the little girl - Boo.  My favorite character.  So adorable.  Overall comment - worth watching when in the mood for some harmless uplifting storyline.
B000069AUI|4.0|Coldplay, bastions of English Rock, come through big time on their second album.  This long-awaited release will not dissapoint you with its fine melodies and soulful vocals.  This album tones down their sound a bit from the &quot;Parachutes&quot; album, but it is still very enjoyable.  Coldplay is a welcome relief from whatever Rock N Roll the US is turning out lately, which is not much worth listening to.  Coldplay's new album is worth having and you will enjoy it over and over again while you are driving, or just chilling out.
0684800713|5.0|I've considered reading this book for years and finally my husband and I listened to the recorded book. The reader, Alexander Adams was absolutely wonderful!<br />Jake Barnes is the narrator of this story of disillusioned American and British expatriates who live in Paris after World War I.  Jake was wounded in the war and is in love with the beautiful Lady Brett Ashley.  Though never completely explained, the reader is led to believe that because of his war injury their love can never be fulfilled. Brett is reckless and goes from one love affair to another and I found her character very difficult to like. On the other hand, Jake is considerate, good to his friends and tries to help Brett out of the difficulties that are the result of her poor choices. Even when his own actions of helping Brett are somewhat despicable, Jake never explains or tries to condone his conduct.<br />Along with their friends, Robert Cohn, Bill Gorton and Britt's fiance, Mike Campbell, they go from bar to bar and restaurant to restaurant drinking and eating the days away. The group finally ends up going to Spain and attending the bullfights in Pamplona where Brett seduces a handsome young bullfighter.<br />At first, most of the characters seem like people without much depth or purpose, but then you realize that they have all been damaged in one way or another by the past and tragic war. Their carousing and fast living are a means of dealing with their problems. The friendships between the various characters is one of the most endearing parts of the story.<br />Hemingway has given me more of an understanding of that time in our history and of the lost generation. Worth reading!
B00003CXAE|2.0|I was so looking forward to the release of Grease on DVD. Paramount certainly made us wait a long time for it but now that it's here I can't believe what shoddy treatment it has been given.<br />Ok so it's an old movie. I expect to see some grain on the film and all in all, I personally am not that disappointed with the picture quality but it all could (and should) have been so much better. <br />To start off with the packaging is a cardboard case that will fall to pieces long before the DVD does. There are no commentaries, no production notes, filmographies, cast/character bios, gallery, outtakes, etc etc. All we get is a static menu, the movie trailer and 20 minutes of interviews with the cast (that were recorded 4 years ago to celebrate the re-release of Grease for it's 20th anniversary in 1998). There is also a songbook for anyone who still does not know the songs after 24 years !<br />There is a lot more material out there that could have been included - Maybe Paramount are working on a 25th anniversary release for next year and this was just the prototype !
B00005JL0U|5.0|Hay all you MJ fan's I know yall have seen this video but anyway<BR>this video is still a great video Right?<br />So anyway all you people out there that never seen this video befor yall just got to watch this wonderful video.<br />And enjoy the video as we Michael Jackson fans did, and sit back, and relix.
0385720920|4.0|...but it's the first word that comes to mind.<br />Before we get this review started, a word of warning:  THIS IS NOT FOR LITTLE KIDS.  THIS IS NOT FOR PEOPLE WITH WEAK STOMACHS OR ARE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE.<br />Okay, with that said, I found Chuck Palahniuk's \\"Choke\\" to be a very strange, perverted, dark, and bizarre novel....but it's supposed to be.  And, it's a very creative novel, despite if you love the novel or hate it.<br />I had read \\"Fight Club\\" after seeing the movie, and I found the novel to be just as entertaining and creative, if not more.  So, I wanted to read another novel by him, so I picked this up.  Wow....nothing could've EVER prepared me for this.<br />\\"Choke's\\" main character is Victor; a compulsive sex addict who creates heroes by purposely choking at restaurants and allowing himself to be saved.  He does this to feel better about himself, and to help pay for his very sick and dying mother's medical care.  And as the story and novel goes on and on, the more twisted and darker it becomes, adding up to one hell of a shocking climax.<br />The novel is told by the narrator, just like in\\"Fight Club.\\"  He still uses the same sense of thinking, the same amount of sarcasam, and the same dark humor found in \\"Fight Club.\\"  And yet, it's still just as refreshing.  I never thought of novels told by the narrator to be all that great, until I read his work.<br />Again, this is not for kids, and this is not for those who get offended easily.  It is a VERY sexually explict novel; I don't think I have ever read anything so sexually graphic!  It's going to be one of those books where you're going to be embarrassed to read in public, fearing that somebody just might snatch it out of your hand and start reading it aloud.  As intense as the sexual content is, it fits the story.<br />I found \\"Choke\\" to be a really entertaining and thought-provoking novel.  Palahniuk has a way of words, and knows how to create a very dark world that none of us have ever seen.  Again, this novel is not for the weak and sensitive.  If you liked \\"Fight Club,\\" or any of the other novels by Palahniuk, chances are you will enjoy this one as well.  While it may not be one I'm going to read over and over again, it is one I am glad that I took the time to read.<br />Sorry that this review is so short, and believe me, I'd LOVE to tell you more.  However, this is a book in which you must be careful how you describe it.  If you give too much away, then you just might ruin it for the reader.  I feel I have given the right amount of information that you need to know.  The great thing about this novel is even after reading the back of the cover, you still don't know where this story is going to go, until it sucks you right in, whether you're ready or not.<br />\\"End\\" isn't the right word, but it's the first word that comes to mind.this novel is not for the weak and sensitive.  If you liked \\"Fight Club,\\" or any of the other novels by Palahniuk, chances are you will enjoy this one as well.

B000063DHL|5.0|Here it is folks. \\"Somewhere in Time\\". The finest album produced by Iron Maiden in my opinion, with \\"Piece of Mind\\" a close second. This is not only my favorite Maiden album but along with Metallica's \\"Ride the Lightning\\", it's my favorite Heavy Metal album ever. It's purely genius musicians working at their highest level of creativity and talent. It was definitely a change from anything they had done previously. They now had the money to experiment in the studio, and that they did. It's a very effects driven album, but no other album or band has used \\"effects\\" in a better way or style than right here. It's possibly their darkest, moodiest, and clearly the most progessive sounding album they've done, filled with time changes, mood changes, and great long, fast and slow solo's from the best. This album features the songwriting ability and talent of Adrian Smith, as the acrobatic fingers of Dave Murray, and his fast signature solo's take somewhat of a back seat. It's very melodic, moody, and still fast. It's the first Maiden album I listened to, and I probably don't recommend lisdtening to this first, if you're new or looking to get into Maiden. I would recommend starting with \\"Number of the Beast\\" or \\"Powerslave\\". It took me a few listens to finally appreciate the genius behind the creation of this fine pice of Heave Metal History. The album begins with the classic dual guitar sound in the intro of \\"Caught somewhere in Time\\". A long, fast, and fabulous intro to the album. Two long and great back to back solo's from Murray and Smith. The next song \\"Wasted Years\\" is one of their biggest hits ever, and really made here in America. Great catchy chorus, and great solo. One of my personal favorites from the band. The next song is one of the meanest riffs and vocals ever performed from the band. Great fast song, and great time change in the middle slowing down the pace after the fabulous solo from Adrian Smith. The next song \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" is a classic long epic from Steve harris, bassist and main songwriter. It also remained in their live set for years to come. The middle of the song between the two solo's is the highlight of the song, a great anthem during live shows meant for the crowd to sing along. \\"The loneliness of the long distance runner\\" is next, and features another great, cool, intro. A solid song, but the following song, another single and hit, \\"Stranger in a strange land\\" is one of the best on the album. It's a slower song, but features a fantastic moving solo from Adrian Smith which begins slowly and then heats up into a great jam that continues through the end of the song. \\"De Javu\\" is next, not the best song on the album, but the finale \\"Alexander the Great\\" is not just the best off the album, but possible my personal favorite song from Maiden. A great intro, which begins with \\"Philip of Macedon\\" giving his kingdom over to his son Alexander. The song is a narrative of his life and conquests, and you can really invision him leading his troops into battle throughout the intro. Among the best long, epic, thematic songs that typically close Maiden albums. This is by far Iron Maiden at their finest hour. Plain and simple. Every song is superb. Buy it!!
B00006AG5N|1.0|Sure, Elvis was good...But hasn't his music already been packaged, re-packaged, re-cycled, and re-done until it's available in too many forms. After a while, you begin to bore with the same old songs. Putting them together on a new cd and calling it 1s (copying the Beatles I might add) sounds like a good idea to some, but enough is enough. I'm sure it will sell some cds, but then again people today fall for gimmicks so easily...
B000063DFN|4.0|This is classic Iron Maiden entering their peak years of popularity. Many feel this is their very best album. It is undeniably their most energetic and fastest paced album to date. Raw Energy. It is simlar in style to \\"Number of the beast\\", capturing a brighter and faster mood than the previous \\"Piece of Mind\\". A fantastic collection of songs. \\"Aces High\\" is a great opener to the album and captures the feel of the album right away. A great chorus and two fast fingered solo's from Dave Murray and Adrian Smith. The next song was the big hit from the album, \\"Two minutes to Midnight\\". One of their more famous songs, and well known chorus'. A great rhythm riff, and solo, the whole package. The next song is a long instrumental, and I personally loose a little interest here, and usually skip to the next, \\"Flash of the blade\\", which is indeed faster than the title suggests. A very fast opening riff, and another catchy chorus. The next song is one of my favorite Maiden songs ever, and is indeed the highlight of the album in my opinion, \\"The Duellists\\". Raw energy and Power. A great Chorus that Pumps me up everytime I hear it. A long progression of lead breaks and solo's, great harmonies between the two guitars. Fantastic, classic, and quintessential Iron Maiden. The next track \\"Back in the village\\", unfortunately is not as good as the rest of the album. Good guitar work however. The title track is a fantastic song, great lyrics and mean riff. Great solo's in the middle and everything you would expect from these monsters of Metal. The finale \\"Rime of the ancient mariner\\" in my opinion, is way too long. Not that I'm against long, epic, thematic songs. I'm NOT, but for half of this 13 minute plus song, is nothing more than a boring bass line and nothing. Almost like their taking a break in the middle of a song, but in the studio? Once it kicks back in, however, you'll be glad you waited. Classic Iron Maiden. Not my favorite album, but among their best, their most powerful and energetic. I highly recommend.
B000066NW0|4.0|The cd of this new talent, is really good, the songs are nice and the lyrics too, i think that Avril isnt just a one hit wonder, probably she will stay a long time, BUT, i think that the last songs of the album arent as great as the first ones, but if you wanna hear something new, buy it, you might be surprised.
B000063DFQ|5.0|This is Iron Maiden at arguably their finest. It is their fourth album and follow-up to their breakthrough &quot;Number of the beast&quot;. It's not as well known and is often forgotten, but in my opinion it's not only a better album, but their very best next to &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;. It's much heavier and darker then their three previous albums. It opens with the the long and fast &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;. The next song is one of my favorite Maiden songs ever, &quot;Revelations&quot;. It shows the songwriting talent and ability of Bruce Dickinson rivaling the previously creatively dominant bassist Steve Harris. A great song overall. Great melodies, time changes, solo, and lyrics. Classic Iron Maiden at their best. The folowing song, &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot; was one of the two hits and singles off the album along with &quot;The Trooper&quot;. These two songs have very catchy rhythms and chorus', along with great, expected, back to back solo's from Dave Murray and Adrian Smith. &quot;Still Life&quot; begins slowly and is a very good song, with dark creepy lyrics. &quot;Sun and Steel&quot; features another catchy chorus and is followed by the long thematic closing track, &quot;To tame a land&quot;. Very heavy, and great guitar melodies. Overall, a great classic album from the masters. Every song is good, no fillers. I would recommend it to anyone who's into Metal. I would by it along with &quot;Number of the beast&quot; first if you're a newcomer to Iron Maiden. It's a little heavier and darker but offers a different side to the band. One of my favorites.
0800177177|2.0|... You people that have rated this film 5 stars need your heads examined.  Yes, I do agree with the fantastic color,the special effects, breathtaking costumes,the surround sound effects, but what else is there for peep sake!!. The story is twisted, girls are getting raped by Satan himself, Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves acting is out of place. The only person that fits in this movie is anthony Hopkins, at least his british accent is authentic. This movie is so twisted that even Count Dracul looks like he belongs in one of the Star War films and not to mention Dracula's slave who craves insects and cats.  <BR>Not only is this film offensive, but a tremendous dissapointment to all Dracula film lovers.
B000063COX|4.0|This is the debut of Iron Maiden, a band that would become one of the greatest, most influential, Heavy metal Bands in the world. It's a very RAW album, but as far as debut's go, it's extremely well done. Paul Di'anno is on vocals and would only remain in the band through there follow up album &quot;Killers&quot;. Because of this the album, as well as Killers, has a different feel unlike the prosperous Dickinson era that took them into their Golden years. There are some great classic songs on this album. The songs are generally short and fast with the exception of &quot;phantom of the opera&quot;. It almost has a punk type feel, mixed in with their metal style that would later develop into full force. Steve Harris, bassist and main songwriter, wrote most of the album, while Dave Murray is featured on almost every lead break and solo. &quot;Running free&quot; was the hit track of the album, while &quot;phantom of the opera&quot; was the true creative masterpiece. A long, progressive, thematic, and epic track, which would later define their style of song writing. The track also features the the debut of Dave Murray's excellence and masterful skills on the guitar. &quot;Sanctuary&quot; is also a great track and remains on their live set today, over 20 years later, as well as the title track. &quot;Trasylvania&quot; is another high point to mention, a great thematic instrumental covered with Murray lead breaks and solo's. &quot;strange world&quot; introduces us to the slower melodic side of the band. The album is a debut, but also is among the finest collection of Maiden songs available. Definitely for the hard core fan, or anyone looking to get into Maiden. I highly recommend.
0375410341|5.0|Well, I'm not sure if House of Leaves terrified me as much as it did other reviewers, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I'll spare another repetitive synopsis of the book, and instead tell possible readers how enjoyable the book is beyond plot and background info.  At many times during the book, you'll find yourself completely forgetting about the supernatural developments in the house while reading a tangent Johnny had provided.  Along the same lines, fear and suspense are also interrupted from time to time with Danielewski's sporadic comedic moments (his sense of humor and use of irony is unmatched).  Personally, I discovered the book because of its relation to Poe's &quot;Haunted&quot; disc, and when I saw all of the insane page structures, I was hooked.  A silly enough reason to buy a book, but I had a feeling about it...and I was right.  If nothing else, satisfy your curiosity by picking it up in a local store and see what you're missing - you won't regret it.
B00001QGIQ|5.0|\\"When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you<br />are, anything you heart desires will come to you.\\"<br />You've heard this song on the Disneyland and Superbowl commercials, but do you remember where it came from?<br />It came from this cartoon, Pinocchio, Walt Disney's second feature to \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" in 1940.<br />I repeat 1940!! Wow and to this day ,Pinocchio still stands out as one of the greatest movies of all time.<br />This opinion is about the 60th anniversay VHS of Pinocchio with THX sound and Remastered visual footage. It even has a bonus at the end about the making of Pinocchio!!! Wow.<br />This was a Christmas gift for my best friend and she loved it, and I can see why.<br />Pinocchio is filled with dazzling animation,music and filled with so much fun and happyness that at the end of the movie , you will feel like wishing upon a star youreself.<br />Pinocchio is about a wooden puppet made by toymaker Geppeto (Christian Rub) who wants his own son.<br />Geppeto makes one wish, to have his own son. Geppeto gets his wish when the Blue Fairy brings Pinocchio to life!!!<br />It took nearly 700 animators and technicians to bring Pinocchio to life and the hard work definitely shows!!!<br />People can say whatever they want about Disney current movies, true they lack a certain magic unlike their cherish cartoon like Pinocchio, but Disney is one of a few companies that has a SOLID record of making Cartoon Classics that are loved by everyone.<br />The fairy brings Pinocchio to life and promises to Pinoccho (voice of Dickie Jones) that he will remain a real boy if he follows the basic principles that every boy should have.<br />He has to be loyal, truthful and above fair. She assigns Jiminy Cricket (Cliff Edwards) to be Pinocchio's conscience.<br />Well it sounds easy at first, but living up to these values is the real challenge here and Pinocchio tries his best to follow them,but since he has just being turned into a boy he doesnt yetknow right from wrong.<br />This is where we meet characters like ,J. Worthington Foulfellow, Stromboli and Barker who take advantage of the young boy.<br />Jiminy Cricket and the fairy save Pinocchio from his judgement calls ,but yet Pinocchio doesnt learn to tell the truth and when he lies his nose starts to grow like a Christmas tree. :-)<br />Meanwhile Geppeto is looking for Pinocchio and ends up being captured by a giant whale Monstro!!!<br />Pinocchio saves Geppeto in a brillian animation sequence and Pinocchio by displaying bravery ends up being a real boy permanently.<br />It's a classic, I can say more but I dont want to spoil it for anyone<br />In an age, where moral, brilliant, wholesome cartoons are scarce you look back to the classics and Pinocchio will forever stand out as one of the greatest classics ever made by Walt Disney who has left his print in the world and in children's hearts.<br />Go out and buy this for youre children
0446608955|5.0|I loved this book!  It had such a mix of emotions.  Great for the whole family
B00006F7S4|5.0|I disagree with the essentially negative reviews here. Beck has indeed drifted far from Midnight Vultures with Sea Change--in this album, he moves from an atonal electronic wall of discordant sounds to a generally melodic, mellower, softer side. The songs are almost all based on acoustic guitar but layered with lush keyboard arrangements, deep bass, and brooding, atmospheric effects. It's Beck at his most soulful, I think--like a handful of tracks from Odelay, Mutations, and especially One Foot in the Grave (his most acoustic album). It's good mood music you'll want to play from start to finish over and over again.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Ladies &amp; Gentlemen, this is Radiohead. Arguably the best album of the 1990's, and quite possibly one of the greatest records ever made. The 3rd effort from rock &amp; roll's best talent is a sonic masterpiece. Soaring guitars, fuzzy drums, melancholy vocals...this is an art house lover's dream! Think of this album in the same breath as &quot;Revolver,&quot; &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; and &quot;Beggars Banquet.&quot; I don't mean that is as influential as those rock classics, but like the aforementioned titles, &quot;Ok Computer&quot; marks a serious turning point for Radiohead(as those titles did for the Beatles, Floyd and Stones, respectively); the point where they(Radiohead) wake up and say &quot;ok people know who we are now, let's blow them away with something they've never heard before.&quot; A must own for Radiohead fans, and a college-radio staple(believe me, I played this one more than any other in school!), this tour-de-force of rock &amp; roll will leave you breathless, and I guarantee that if you love it the first time around, it will not be easy to take it out of your CD player. I have owned this album for 5 years now, and STILL haven't taken it out of my CD player....I am not kidding, it(to this day) occupies one of the 5 CD slots of my stereo. &quot;Ok Computer&quot; will change they way that you view rock &amp; roll.
0316666343|5.0|This top-seller has been criticized for everything from wandering, not tying up loose ends, not being realistic and even being unBiblical. The narrator is a teenage girl trying to tell her family's story from such a unique perspective that the wandering of her musings is nothing if not true to how a confused teen would relate an unfolding story. Great novels often do not tie up loose ends, but leave the reader to imagine the future of the characters as they wish. This book does not come to necessarily pat conclusions and some mysteries remain unsolved for the characters. But that is the beauty of the book. It is a snapshot of a family in crisis and the years following. Anyone who has been through a tough time knows life doesn't always turn out a happy ending and we may never have all the answers. This is an interesting glimpse of some fascinating characters. It is not meant to be a realistic view of the afterlife, or a guidebook to spirituality. Enjoy it for what it is- a beautiful piece of literature.
B00006G8HX|4.0|... \\"ST III: The Search For Spock\\" is a great movie and it has everything that a Star Trek [lover] could want: humor, action, adventure, emotion (especially for Kirk...poor guy), solid acting, tension, shock value(the scene with the Enterprise and the Klingon boarding party) and best of all hope and resurrection.  I personally love this film, as I find it to be a little bit darker in tone than \\"ST II.\\" Plus it has Christopher Lloyd in a fantastic over-the-top performance as Kruge, a rogue Klingon commander who enflicts some serious emtional damage on Kirk. Composer James Horner continues his string of soundtrack hits here, improving and adapting the score that he used from \\"ST II.\\" A great extension of its predescessor, \\"Search For Spock\\" continues the wonderful tradition of Star Trek(in my opinion rather proudly) and should be welcomed for not only being a great Star Trek film, but a great sci-fi film as well. Oh, and stop the comparisons!!!!
B000000I3O|4.0|The Misfits, released in 1988, is a collection of their greatest songs, from 1977's \\"She\\" through to 1982's \\"Wolfsblood.\\"<br /><br />These three-chord mini-anthems of blood, guts and decay are rooted in classic punk rock ramalama, as laid down by Johnny Ramone, Steve Jones, and Ron Asheton a few scant years earlier. Add to that ever-delicious concoction the unexpectedly tuneful, hyper-masculine, Elvis-by-way-of-the-Ninth-Circle baritone crooning of Jersey boy Glenn Danzig, and you've got Grade-A, First-Rate punk rock. There's hooks and catchy choruses galore, which makes this band perennially popular with today's skater kids who wouldn't know who Joey Ramone or Johnny Thunders or Dave Vanian were even if they were on MTV 24 hours a day.<br /><br />Of course Danzig's lyrics are (mostly) dismissable, but they are fun to sing along to. Their greatest songs are mighty chest-pounders, such as \\"I Turned into a Martian\\" (whew, a stunner, absolutely brilliant), \\"Astro Zombies,\\" \\"Where Eagles Dare.\\" \\"Skulls\\" almost manages an atmosphere of weariness and psychopathic desire:<br /><br />Corpses all hang headless and limp<br />Bodies with no surprises<br />While the blood drains down<br />Like devil's rain<br />We'll bathe tonight...<br />Gotta have you on my wall<br />Gotta have you on my wall<br /><br />This is the world of Famous Monsters of Filmland magazines, Saturday afternoon matiness, banned comic books read by flashlight under the bedcovers, and Aurora glow in the dark monster model kits. So it's appropriate that \\"Vampira\\" is an homage to the horror queen host, with a cool sexy twist:<br /><br />Mistress to the horror kids<br />Cemetary of white love-ghoul<br />Take off your shabby dress<br />Come lay beside me<br />Come a little bit closer<br />come a little bit closer<br />to this!<br /><br />\\"London Dungeon,\\" far from detailing Inquisitional punishment in a Hammer horror or Roger Corman flick, is an account of the Misfits' ill-fated tour of England in 1979, when they all got thrown in the clink for some infraction or other. Following the squealing, feedback-laden end to the signature tune \\"Mommy, Can I Go Out and Kill Tonight?\\" is the relentless pounding \\"Die Die My Darling,\\" one of my very favorite 'fits tunes:<br /><br />Die die my darling<br />Just shut your pretty mouth<br />Die die my darling<br />Dead-end ghoul for a dead-end girl<br />Die die my darling<br />Don't utter a single word<br />I'll be seeing you again<br />I'll be seeing you<br />In Hell!<br /><br />Now, the atmosphere darkens and the threat becomes uglier; \\"Earth AD,\\" \\"Devilock,\\" \\"Death Comes Ripping\\" and the rest are nastier, sludgier, faster songs with a hardcore wallop. Rather than singing, Danzig bellows and growls, while the Robo-tic drums destroy everything at twenty paces.<br /><br />The production here is odd--not clear and in-your-face like Walk Among Us not dry and plain like Legacy of Brutality but buzzy, thick, distorted, one-dimensional. It's not bad, certainly, but other 'fits albums are essential too. I think I can recommend the Misfits to anyone who digs songs about beheaded girls, zombies from outer space, and vampire chicks.

B00005J6T0|5.0|It sounds similar to her two preview albums &quot;Madonna&quot; and &quot;Like a virgin&quot;. Pop-music in the 80-Style.<BR>It's just a pity that there are only nine songs on it.

B00003CXZ4|3.0|This was a great movie the first time I watched, it kept me intreged well after it had ended but the more I thought about it, the more I realized how badly it was writen. <BR>...This is the sequence of events.<BR>1.  Sammy has no long term memory and Leonard, an insurance agent determines that Sammy is faking his condition.  Sammy is also a drug dealer on the verge of a very big deal. The only hint of this in the movie is right before Sammy's wife kills herself when she gets off the phone and says, \\"What have you done?\\"<BR>2.  The drug dealers break into Leonard's house to find if he an accomplise of Sammy's and trying to hide the drugs Sammy was supposed to have.  After all, Leonard says Sammy is faking. If so, Leonard might be the one with the drugs or working with Sammy to steal from the dealers. Leonard's wife is killed before his eyes right when he is shot in the head and loses his memory just like Sammy.<BR>3.  Teddy, a crooked cop and a lier, uses Leonard to find the man doing the drug deal (who is a John G) and kill him for the drug money. No doubt Teddy gave Leonard the name John G. to prompt Leonard to kill the guy.  When John G is dead, Teddy shows up to get the drug money but Leonard takes it instead and steals John's car before Teddy can get it from him.  At this point Teddy makes up several lies to get the money, including the one about Leonard being a self-induced murderer. note: Leonard places the drug money in the trunk of the car he steals and forgets it. Also, Teddy all but says he is the man who killed Leonard's wife.  Leonard then writes down Teddy's License plate number and goes and tattoes it on himself then forgets it all.<BR>4. Natalie is John G's girlfriend, who Leonard killed and she is torturing Leonard and misleading him to get even. During this time Teddy keeps showing up and sending anonymous messages to Leonard to mislead him. Also another guy shows up looking for the money whom Leonard captures and beats up, then lets go.  You are led to beleave this is Natalie's boyfriend; it isn't.<BR>5. Natalie identifies the license plate number as Teddy's and gives it to Leonard.  Leonard then kills Teddy and takes a picture so he wont forget that he finnaly killed the right John G. Right before Leonard kills him, Teddy once again all but admits he is the guy.<br />Note: Leonard is NOT on a rampage to kill John Gs. With each tattoo he narrows his suspects down. The finnal clue is the license plate number. Leonard will never find another John G with that license plate. At the end of the film, Leonard is onl contemplating the lie Teddy told him, it is not the truth...<br />... no where in the film was any direct conclusion drawn to any evidense.  This movie keeps you guessing and no matter how many times you watch it, you will never get any concrete evidense to whats going on.  Everything I have said earlier is drawn off conclusions that explain the sequence of the plot. I could think of no other way this film would make sense...<br />I give this movie three stars because it was intellegently done and very thought provoking.  Few movies today require any conscious thinking to watch.  I liked this movie because it intrigued me. Even though I thought it was bad, it took me a long time to draw that conclusion...<br />It loses one star for the crappy DVD menus and another for the poor writing, otherwise a good movie to watch to get your brain working.
B00006AG5N|5.0|One word describes Elv1s 30 # 1  ---  AWESOME !!!!  The sound is wonderful and the songs are killer classics.  The music does all the speaking and shows why Elvis is still the King of Rock n Roll 25 yrs after his death !!! All Elvis fans will love it. It will even hook the non-Elvis fan ---  just listen to it once and you will be hooked !!! Its so good it makes you cry tears of joy!!!  No one can come close to the magic of Elvis and his new cd !! I bought 9 cds of Elv1s 30 # 1 -- its that good !!!     Everyone should buy this new cd !!!!
B00006AG5N|5.0|Well, he got 30 #1s because he's the greatest entertainer/vocalist in the history of world! I highly advise the purchase of this cd to everyone.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This is Beck's most heartfelt &amp; introspetive album yet, and I can't quit listening to it!  Yes, according to RollingStone, Sea Change was written in the midst of breaking up with his long time girlfriend. However, I think it also reflects the uncertain and somber tones across the world post 9/11. In light of impending war &amp; dismal economics, the album seems quite appropriate for the times we're living in.
0440224764|4.0|This was my first Grisham read...and i was pretty impressed.<br />I think the only complaint i have would be the ending, as many before me have said.  It left me dangling a little bit.<br />The book in general left me very impressed though.  It was a very interesting turn of events the way the story started to move.  I ready one person thought it was predictable, maybe for veteran Grisham readers?  So, I have many more of Grisham's books on my shelves and i can't wait to start reading them!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead's, OK Computer is a fantastic Cd let me say first. But you must beware: THIS CD IS EXTREMELY DEPRESSING! It is totally emotionally draining. The band should seriously considered writing a warning on the label. But put that aside and you have before you an innovative powerful listen. The Album begins with Airbag. When I first listened to this CD for the first time I only liked a couple of songs on KID A, and I wasn't sure what to expect. The only song that appealed to my right off the bat was 'Airbag', and it still today is my number one song on the Album. I can't believe a song that amazing came out so long ago and wasn't a pop hit. The drums, hypnotic guitars and long-drowned lyrics of Thom's voice simply release me from my daily life. Not to mention the awesome bass. When he says \\"In an interstellar burst, I am back to save the Universe\\" I simply feel free. And the harmony at the end is mind-blowing. It's beauty... My favourites of the rest include 'Let Down', Lucky, The Tourist. But there really isn't a song I don't like. The thing I don't really understand is why everyone's all over Paranoid Android. It's unique and all but its not amazing or anything. Nothing compared to Airbag. O well. IT's for sure a buy. When I bought it for the first time I hated it save for Airbag. I couldn't believe I bought such an empty CD. Now I can't stop listening to it. I almost try not to because it drains all my amotion that I am so quiet and all at school. ITs dangerously good. BEWARE
B00005RYKV|3.0|Seemed like some things in this movie wernt explained much. You can follow whats going on, what happened, etc but it seemed like it had many holes. The direction is only there half the time. It had some cool scenes in it but it could have been a much better movie
B0000640VO|5.0|Movies are for entertainment. Movies are for dreaming. Some use it for philosophy or to practice cinematography techniques, but in the end, the whole idea is to have an experience. Amelie is a wonderful experience. The tag line says that &quot;she will change your life&quot;, and if you're in the mood, she will do it. The marvelous music, all the special effects (yes, the movie is full of them), the cast, and all the details are intended to give us an experience of love, optimism and wonder for simple things. Those who critized technicals aspects or plot or philosophical ideas from Mr. Jaunet, are missing the point.<BR>The DVD is excellent, specially Mr. Jaunet comments about the production.
B00005JKWJ|1.0|I liked the first one alot more. I think it was the change in directors. Part 1 had a better look and feel then this one did. The movie got boring after awhile and around the end the movie REALLY fell off. It just seemed like mindless beatdowns. It does get a one though cuz Leonor Varela was lookin' slammin' through the whole flick but damn that cheesy death scene at the end made me wanna cap myself. If they have a part 3 please give it back to Stephen Norrington.
B00005MP58|1.0|I am hard of hearing and the lack of captioning makes some of  the dialogue difficult to follow and there are language issues. People these days walk on eggshells to avoid offending blacks and gays and Jews and femminists who will have a tempoer tantrum over even accidental offenses against them, but they think nothing of offending God by misusing his name. The use of Blasphemy in this movie is anachronistic, and even if the people making this movie don't believe in God, they don't seem to care that they are offending the people who do believe in God with that kind of language. I bought it because 19th century life was clean, and I am deeply dissapointed because it is another example of what i call \\"Cafeteria Bigotry,\\" whereby one preaches tolerance and respect for other's opinion, while in actuality they are hypocritically  selecting which groups they mind offending, and which groups they don't mind offending.
B000050FEN|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time and one of the best quality DVDs Ive ever seen. David Fincher got his rep from doing this movie. The way he shows such a dark image of the city and life in it.....just watch the movie. Each scene has such gruesome detail.  The directing, the writing, the acting - just slammin'. Gwyneth Paltrow was wasted as she was only in the movie for 10 minutes or so but who cares. This movie builds with each scene as you think the cops get closer and closer to the killer. The ending was unexpected - dont let anyone ruin it for you. The DVDs image quality and sound are top notch. David Fincher is crazy about his dvds. Just watch this movie if you can stomach the scenes(which some cant) youll be glad you did.
B000065U1N|5.0|Ridley Scott is a master at capturing the essence of a particular story's time, place and atmosphere. The future dystopian world of 'Blade Runner'; the ancient Roman world in 'Gladiator'; middle America in 'Thelma and Louise'; the terror of deep space in 'Alien' - the list continues as this director ranks as one of the best in the business. Scott did not disappoint with ~Black Hawk Down~ because the realism of this film was at times extremely painful to watch. There were moments in the viewing where I actually felt part of the action - an intense fear in the guts and dizziness that a soldier could well experience before plunging into battle. There is no wonder that this film won an academy award for best editing because the action flowed seamlessly to the point of saturation then, suddenly, when you think you've had enough, it pours on a little more just to make sure you get the point. The editing is a work of art. I came away from the film emotionally and physically drained as if I had fought along side these courage's men.<br />There was an oddity in this film that is difficult to overlook: Somalia's lack of food (this was the reason U.N. forces were there in the first place) but an obvious over abundance of weapons. The country's population are starving, food is a scarcity, but automatic weapons and rocket launchers abound. There is a specific image in the film of a little Somalian boy, thin as a rake, obviously starving, walking down the road with rockets strapped to his back and a machine gun in his hands. I can't get this strange image out of my mind...<br />~Black Hawk Down~ is a soldier's story, fighting to keep themselves and their comrades alive - a well-used and popular theme in war films. This is also the romantic aspect of war we continue to dwell upon to somehow justify or at least divert our attention away from the fact that war is simply mass murder. This film communicated to me that we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that courage may be a virtue but war is essentially death and destruction.<br />This important film, despite its focus on the soldier's courage, which is a highly commendable virtue, still sends the message convincingly that war is about suffering and death, and does so in a highly realistic fashion.<br />This is superb filmmaking.t war is essentially death and destruction.<br />This important film, despite its focus on the soldier's courage, which is a highly commendable virtue, still sends the message convincingly that war is about suffering and death, and does so in a highly realistic fashion.<br />This is superb filmmaking.
B000028U0Y|5.0|I chose to give this review that title not because it serves as a \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation.  Cash's most famous songs, \\"I Walk The Line,\\" \\"Boy Named Sue,\\" and \\"Ring of Fire\\" are not even on this.  I say this should be the one to own because you cannot listen to it without wanting to rush out and buy more Cash.  I have a lot of friends who used to tell me that country music is awful.  But I just pop in this CD and as they listen, the immortal words \\"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash,\\" and \\"I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die,\\" change their opinion and they admit that country can be cool.  This isn't pop country, this isn't Shania Twain and Garth Brooks, this is hard-nosed country, much closer to rock and roll than the aforementioned watered-down country.<br />I am of the opinion that any real musician is always better live.  You get to hear more interpretation, you get to hear the artists looser and more playful and more entertaining, and above all, you get to hear the crowd react.  Something about hearing the prisoners cheer raucously for the most violent lines that Cash sings really gives this album a unique aura.  The prison audience is the best I've ever heard in a live recording.  Obviously they don't get entertainment like this very much, and they are making the best of it.<br />Songs like \\"Folsom Prison Blues,\\" \\"Cocaine Blues,\\" \\"25 Minutes to Go,\\" and \\"Jackson\\" are all classics, but for my money, the best track on the album is the previously unreleased \\"Legend of John Henry's Hammer.\\"  This is a song that needs to be played live, and the rendition here is just amazing.  The pounding anvil, the modulations that keep the excitement building, and the fervent crowd reaction when the song speeds up as John Henry races the steam drill make this more than a song; it's more in line with an epic poem.  You find yourself rooting for John Henry and really feeling the emotion of the ending (which I won't spoil for anyone who hasn't heard it).  But every song on the albumis great, nothing will have you reaching for \\"next track\\" on subsequent listens.<br />If you have even the SLIGHTEST passing interest in Cash, country, rock and roll, rockabilly, or just great music, you owe it to yourself to buy this album.  And once you do, make sure you pick up \\"At San Quentin Prison\\" to get all the hits.
B00000K0DK|1.0|I have never understood why this movie is consistently rated as the best American film ever made.  The cinematography is too dark almost the whole time, making the viewer strain to see faces clearly enough to tell the characters apart.  The plot is too psychological to follow without effort, and Kane himself is not a good enough character to justify such effort.  I never felt strongly enough about him (either way) to care about anything he does or experiences.  Basically I would rate this movie as a pretentious waste of two perfectly good hours.
0140288503|5.0|I served with first Ranger Battalion from 96 to 99 and I heard many stories concerning the operation in Somalia and there were many different views of the same story.  I was extremely pleased that Mark Bowden told such a detailed account to fill in the blanks of what happened on the ground that fateful day.  I encourage all Americans to read this heroic story about its son's and brother's struggle to overcome immense odds to protect the man next to them and make it out alive.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I thought the story line was excellent. A very different and very clever view of the monster in the closet that scares most every child. This movie has a few scary moments, but for the most part it is just funny with a few sad moments. You have your choice of Widescreen or Full screen plus 2 animated short films, games, and behind the scenes stuff that give hours of entertainment for all. I believe John Goodman (the voice of James P Sulivan) should lend his voice to more of these animated films as he does such a good job. He is able give the right tone for whatever the situtation calls for, whetther happy or sad. Billy Crystal also did a great job as Mike Wazoski. It totally cracks me up when the little girl (Boo) keeps saying his name. And James Colburn was excellent as Henry Waternoose who is the boss.<BR>Without a doubt, just a well put together movie for the whole family to enjoy.
B00004T0UT|5.0|First of all, let me say a big Thank You to the previous reviewers. It was YOUR reviews that overwhemingly swayed me to purchase this fine album. As the title of my post states, if Elvis ever had a masterpiece, this album is it. AWESOME. I got this album just last week, and already I am in love with it. This is quintessential late 60's Elvis. For those of you who think Elvis Presley was just 'Heartbreak Hotel' and 'Hound Dog', you have NO IDEA what you're missing. I think this was the album that showed Elvis's music was changing with the times. This album shows his maturity. From the opening of Wearin' That Loved On Look and Only The Strong Survive, the listener is hooked. Then the awesome bluesy feel of I'll Hold You in My Heart makes you feel you're in an underground, smokey blues club, with the man himself leading the festivities. There is NOT ONE bad song on this fine album. Any Day Now is MAGNIFICENT. This has quickly become one of my favorite songs (not just Elvis songs) of all time. The original album closes with In The Ghetto, my favorite Elvis Presley song of all time. It's also probably Elvis's darkest and most socially conscious song. A GREAT ending to the original record. <BR>The Bonus Tracks are, you guessed it, outstanding. The hits Suspicious Minds and Kentucky Rain are songs I don't think I'll EVER get tired of hearing. Don't Cry Daddy is absolutely superb. And Mama Liked the Roses is a very mellow and fitting end to the album.<BR>Besides Elvis's outstanding vocal delivery, his band, (like all of his musicians during late 60's and 70's era), is HOT! For people who think Elvis lost something after his Army years, THIS is the album that redeemed him. By the way, did I mention that I'm only 24 years old? That just goes to show the awesome power of Elvis and his music....to cross multiple generations. Although I'm a big Elvis Presley fan, I'm far from the BIGGEST. But this album makes me look at him in a totally different way. So, for all of you out there that think Elvis was a marginal artist at best (especially you people out there around my age), I almost guarantee this album will change your view about Elvis Presley. Bottom line, buy this album. You will NOT be dissapointed.
0446677450|5.0|....Unless You're Working 9 to 5.<br />I do agree with this statement.  Robert Kiyosaki and Lechter gives us reminders of the benefits of credit and debt management, compound interest, and ways to make money work for us, instead of simply \\"working for money.\\"  This book can benefit those who are financially literate or educated, casually interested in making money, or for those who need information on money and finances in general.  The author is a person who's accomplished what he set out to do, and his views are worth looking into.  Like most successful people, he didn't \\"work in the traditional\\" paradigm to achieve his financial independence.  Forget about the steel mill, corporation or government.  Kiyosaki's independent thinking \\"outside the box\\"  culminated in his voluntary retirement at the age of 47.  If a person wants to do that they have to create, produce, and make something of their own.  <br />This book seems even more relevant today in 2002, after the recent scandals in certain corporations.  Depleted Stock-option values and 401Ks have knocked a lot of folks down the financial \\"Joneses-ladder.\\"<br />One definition I'll paraphrase of wealth Kiyosaki noted is from Buckminster Fuller:  Wealth is how long a person can live/support them self, after they quit, are fired, layed-off, or lose their job.  How long could you last if you stopped working tomorrow? <br />This book is an eye-opener but in the back of our minds we know it  it shouldn't be.  Many Americans may not like Kiyosaki's views, (which are based on his real-life experiences), because it's too late for most of them to turn back.  I personally see these people quite often, and they come from all income brackets and ages.  From blue-collar union members to corporate yuppies.  I listen to baby-boomers wince at the prospect they're going to be hacking away at \\"the company\\" for a long-time to come after they finally decided to review the assets, liabilities, consumer-price-index and \\"golden tarnishedyear\\" pension fund and 401K.    <br />To Kiyosaki, owning a house is a liability. <BR>He notes the same steps individuals and couples take to get caught in what he calls the \\"Rat Trap.\\"  Buy a house, go into massive debt, work for someone else to earn a paycheck, keep paying bills, then die.  Work--mortgage--debt--bills--death.  Sound like fun?  <br />He penned a great phrase: \\"the leaning tower of suburbia.\\" <BR>In debt, hoping not to get fired, layed-off, or down-sized.  The author asserts his opinion on mortgaged \\"home ownership\\" because it influences behavior so much: more reluctant to take calculated risks in life, less willing to switch jobs and industries, or stand up for a bad situation that exists in the workplace.  Once a person decides to take out a long-term loan on a house they're going to live in, almost all of the choices and opportunities they once had evaporate.  Similar to a funnel:  We can pour our realistic wants and goals into a \\"funnel of opportunity.\\"  These are things we actually have the ability to do in life.  A funnel's mouth is wide, as are the opportunities and choices we have.  When a house is \\"bought,\\" the funnel of opportunity shrinks almost entirely to the choices and opportunity remaining for the homeowner:  work, keep up with the Joneses, and try to stay on top of the bills.  When a person or couples' home is their major asset (misnomer) it's not diversification either.     <br />Kiyosaki notes our educational institutions.<BR>High schools and universities teach students to think \\"inside<BR>of the box.\\"  The world has changed tremendously in the last decade alone, and one's ability to prosper may not be entirely what they know, but their ability to adapt and learn quickly in this ever changing economy.  Did anyone predict the Dot.com boom 5 years before it happened?  No, but a lot of people got into it.  <br />The author believes that it's better to know \\"a little about a lot of things,\\" than to know \\"a lot about one particular thing.\\"  In his view, \\"specialization\\" can be limiting in today's economy, and we need to \\"diversify\\" knowledge base and skills ourselves.<br />He notes we work for 3 institutions when we don't work for<BR>ourselves:  <br />1. We work for our employer or the<BR>share-holders. We work to help them get wealthy, and secure their retirement. We help boost their share holder earnings when massive layoffs occur.  But we are afraid of being let go, fired, or layed off by these same people.  Doesn't sound like a person in this situation is in control of their life does it?  Unfortunately it's true for 95% of the population.  <br />2.  We work for the government.  We pay taxes throughout our<BR>life, and even in death.  Where does our money go?  None of us really know.<br />3.  We work for banking mortgage companies.  <BR>paying off the long-term mortgage debt.  <br />To most Americans though--they've invested too much<BR>money, time, and emotional input into their current lifestyle and are too far along to change it.  For some it will offer hope, to others denial, or futility.
0316666343|5.0|This book is a pool of water for those trapped in the literary desert that is modern fiction.  For one, I was relieved to be consumed in the writting talent of Ms. Sebold.  Readers will be taken by the colar in the first few pages and Susie, the narrator and the victim of the book, will not let you go.  I was glued to the pages and found myself releasing numerous emotions; joy, sadness, bitterness, rage, and sweet relief.  <BR>Do not be discouraged by those who say that the ending was lacking.  It is not.  Seabold is giving us new and fresh writting which also includes different endings as well.  For me the ending was realistic and gave me a sense of resolve.  Was it rushed? I don't think so. Her ending makes us realize that sometimes, after a tragedy, without even knowing it, we start enjoying life again with each and every simple passing moment. The ending is not ment to be a catalyst or grand resolution, but rather keeps in  rhythm with the story; it is a release.
B00000IOSU|5.0|This album blows away the previous studio work. My only regret is \\"Witness\\" and \\"Wait\\" was left off the cd (they are on the DVD). This album is well mixed and hard to believe its live. Recomend this cd to anyone!
B00001ODHJ|5.0|My goodness, where do I begin?<BR>The hilarious spoofs on Kmart? The crazy wacked out demons? Bruce Campbell with the best lines ever written in all of human history? My good lord and butter! This is quite possibly the most hilarious and best movies ever. Gimme some sugar baby!!!!
B000002N2Z|5.0|BEAUTIFUL! I am so in love with the Deftones and I'm sure that  almost anyone into rock will love them too. This was the second cd I actually heard from the Deftones. I was quite suprised because it sounded nothing like the first one I heard, which was white pony. This wasn't a bad thing, It was a good thing. The fact that the deftones don't sound the same on every single album is wonderful. You won't feel like your listening to the same songs over and over and over. And another thing about this cd and other deftones cds is that EVERY song is enjoyable. It's not like usual cd's where you have like 3 good songs and about 9 other bad ones. They are all great! In fact, I was able to listen to this particular cd over and over non stop for about ten hours .  Chino Moreno is an amazing song writer and vocalists. Sure..The band may not play their instruments to perfection but they put together totally amazing songs. Some of my favorites from this cd were minus blindfold, 7 words, and birthmark but , as I mentioned earlier, EVERY single song on this cd is wonderful!
B0000214F0|1.0|Peter O'Toole was reportedly drunk when he made this movie. I wish I was too when I saw it.
1563898586|5.0|I heard about this on the internet among the buzz starting with the movie being shot, starring Sean Connery. It peaked my curiosity to hear that a comic book contained such an exhaustive reference to old literature characters that a website had been set up with annotations for practically every panel of the comic. Sure enough, just about every panel DOES contain references to everything from Oliver Twist to Sherlock Holmes. <br />But enough about the \\"Easter Eggs.\\" The fact that this is a great, ripping story filled with humor often is overshadowed by the hidden references, but it really is worth picking up for simply the story. Written in a similar form to the old \\"Penny Dreadfuls,\\" this is noir at its best. Even the ads on the inside covers, etc, are great to read, filled with references, or based on actual ads \\"back in the day.\\" <br />You owe it to yourself to check this out. Especially if you end up seeing the movie. Everything I've heard is that it will probably be interesting, but not as good as this. Then, after you read this, pick up the new miniseries, League of Extraordinary Gentleman, Vol. 2 - out now in a comic store near you!
B00004ST9Q|4.0|I can't believe I have waited so long to purchase this DVD. As  i child of the '80s, I grew up on Whitney's music, and I am glad that I now have the opportunity to revisit these classics! She has an AMAZING voice. <br />     The video itself is superb! It offers up rare Whitney performances from the 80's, as well as behind the scenes commentary from fellow soul divas Faith Evans, Missy, Kelly Price and others. It even shows a side of Whitney which is not often seen: for instance, Whitney clowning around at a photo shoot while singing Faith Evans' \\"All Night Long\\"! The DVD packs all of these things, plus all of her best videos into one tiny package. This is truly one of the best music DVDs that I have purchased. BUY IT!
B000059XYK|5.0|first off let me start out by saying that this movie is so much better than the original was, and there arent many movies that i can say that about.. I have probably seen this movie about 25 times, and everytime i pass it on tv, i have to stop and watch it again.... Nicholas cage is great in the movie... and the action parts with the cars are awesome... I love the relationship between memphis and sway.... and sphinx is a really cool character also...the one and only thing that i do have that i didnt like about it was the part when he jumps over all the cars on the bridge.... the cgi didnt look too good, but other than that the movie is excellent.... and the car chase at the end with elenor wasnt as boring as the car chase in the original..... the soundtrack is also a plus to this.... you should also check out the dvd.... its got some really cool extra stuff on it....
B00005QIPH|5.0|first off...this cd doesnt deserve five stars like i granted it...no no no dear ones...this album deserves 14, nay 15 out of 5 stars.  this album was a breathe of fresh air that i had been waiting for my entire life.  this is what music has been leading towards since rock strayed from pop.  theyve kept their music rooted in rock and have added a pop tinge.  this combination is what makes their album so timeless.  its an album that anyone could love.  this album is the best thing since the beatles...i take that back...this is the best album ever...and they are the best band ever...there i said it...you may ask whats my favorite movie...well my favorite movie...dear ones...is the strokes...im out                                       <BR>&quot;in many ways, theyll miss the good ol' days&quot; or were they the good ol days...the strokes werent around so probably not...
B00003CXZ1|4.0|So good to see a female superhero.  We haven't had a<BR>realy good one since Ms Weaver in the Alien series.<BR>Great to see Laura kick butt, but really what's with<BR>the costumes? Something for the boys?
6305508550|4.0|It really is amazing how Mike Judge captures all the intricacies of working in a cubicle atmosphere. The annoying boss. The characters that work around you. Hawaiian shirt day. If you have ever worked in a cube, you must rent this movie. It is hysterical.
B000003H2W|5.0|While violins in a dark/goth type band are nothing new (often dating back to the 1970's), if the band can integrate them with their sound - or better yet, build their sound around their violin - they will truly stand out as the best of the best. My personal first experience with violin in a band such as this is with Tristania. In this reviewer's opinion, this band is on a higher level to Tristania, in terms of their integration of the haunting sounds a violin can produce - though this album's sound is truly different than any of Tristania's. <br />The vocals are truly masterful, bringing the words to dance upon the darkest of minds in a deathly beautiful ballet of melody. As an artist who plays the violin himself, this album can not be rated higher. Buy it; you shall not be dissapointed.
068484267X|1.0|I picked up this book with great expextations and was quickly let down. This is a is not only depressing, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I truly felt bad for his family, but I don't know how anyone could give this a good review...
B00005YW4H|3.0|After listening to \\"I Don't Know Why\\" over and over on the radio, I was motivated to buy the CD expecting more of the same.  However, the rest of the CD is basically country music in her sexy voice which my be appealing to some.  Since I don't care for country music, this didn't work for me.  However, if she can make more songs like \\"I Don't Know Why\\" I could become a big fan!
B000066NW0|4.0|Sk8er Boi is the BEST song! There are different feelings through out the cd, each song, has it's own.
B00006GFAB|3.0|I am sick of buying the same songs over and over again. Yes, the songs sound great, most of them are re-mixed, but come on. Let's get some un-released stuff out. Maybe some rare studio stuff that we have never heard before. I have every KISS album. The two that keep going into my CD player,KISS ALIVE II, and Animalize. KISS is a great band, but it seems to me that they are money hungry.
B000002LRX|5.0|I was a big Mr Bungle fan;then i listened to \\"Epic\\"and i bought \\"The Real Thing\\",which I thinked was the best.<BR>2 days after i bought \\"Angel Dust\\",and it licterally blew me away!!!<BR>THIS ALBUM IS JUST GREAT!!<BR>I love every song on it,i can't stop to listening to them!!!!<BR>All of them has got their particular mood and atmosphere and you can't classify  Faith No More's style.<BR>They're FNM,stop.And they've got Groove,Passion,Funk,Taste,Mike Patton.BUY THIS ONE,TRUST ME!!
0679746048|5.0|I read this book in one night. I could not put it down. Susanna spends only an hour and a half with this phsychiatrist and he's already sending her off to Mclean Hospital in Mass. There she meets new friends and a new life. With the help of Lisa, Polly, Cythnia and more she discovers what real friends are. This a great memoir and physcology book for anyone.
B000002L82|3.0|What sets this early Techno Pop work apart from anything before it and anything after is without a doubt the Bass leads by Peter Hook--he carries almost the entire album and shines brightly.  <BR>Bernard Sumner strayed from filling Ian Curtis' shoes and tried very hard to become a new distingtive frontman himself--while for him personally this is a great task, but it really made the work suffer and truely show how incapable of being a great frontman or vocalist he really is.  But he did vastly improve over the years that followed.  The lyrics really lack on this album and are quite childish at times, ruining songs that could have been great(i.e.The Village, Your Silent Face, 586, and Leave Me Alone).<BR>The synthetics are layered all over the place, but never misused.  Very Poppy and Bright(not my thing).<BR>The Drums are very hard to distinguish amoung the tracks, for about half of the songs are a machine.  But almost all of them sound like Stephen Morris is actually playing(good job).<br />Overall the album is a disappoint.  But it was their first official step to become their own band.  Good to own if you're collecting all New Order albums, but otherwise you're better off to try any other NO album.
1577311523|5.0|A new spiritual approach. Eclectic. Suited for those who want more than the myths of Christianity.
B000002ADT|4.0|It is a true joy to listen to Miles Davis and his cohorts blend their instruments in wonderful harmony. The color and tone that Miles, Bill, John, etc. each bring is quite refreshing and relaxing. Flamenco Sketches is especially strong in that respect as Miles emphasizes each note of his passionate solos.<br />Whereas I do not love this CD to death at this point, I can certainly appreciate the beauty on how these masterful musicians feed off each other. And the calming tones surely do create a mood.
B00000I0XW|5.0|Brightman is in her element here. She s great with Webber's music. If you like Andwew Lloyd Weber's music, you will need this album.
B000002J1B|5.0|An absolute masterpiece.<BR>\\"Gates of Delirium\\" is the most compelling piece of music I have ever heard. The final sounds of life departing, that fills the ears of dying soldiers in the battlefield of aTolkien world. Thats the kind of images that this masterpiece brings to my mind. And I guess that the cover of the cd is not far away from this image.  <BR>Patrick Moraz's keyboards is the best thing ever happened to Yes and its a shame that he only stayed only for this work.<BR>I always prefered his more intelectual approach than the pompous victorian approach of Wakeman. <BR>In any case this album is a prog rock gem and possibly the most consice album ever conceived by Yes.
B00000IL1K|4.0|Good background music, but don't expect a real thrill from these performances.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Having grown up listening to mom's Elvis records, especially the ones from the 70's, I was already a fan. I ordered this one because it had the hits from his early career, i.e., &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, my fave from his movie days, &quot;Return to Sender&quot;, and of course, the 70's hits. It's a well-rounded listen to Elvis's catalog. I was impressed with the remastering, the sound quality is awesome! &quot;It's Now Or Never&quot; is a real gem! I was disappointed at the alternate take of &quot;The Wonder of You&quot;, but I have better versions on other CD's, so it wasn't that big a deal. A great buy for a new fan, and also for a long-time fan.
B00005JKCH|4.0|As a fan of the Original \\"Batman\\" & \\"Superman\\", this was a nice comic-book adaption, Tobey McGuire & Kristin Dunst were cast perfectly here as Peter Parker & Mary Jane Watson, although I liked \\"Attack of the Clones\\" better in comparison, I can give this one credit where it is due, In this we see the story unfold as Peter, a high school geek, is smitten with Mary Jane, who has a very intimidating boyfriend, on a field trip to a labratory, he is bitten by a radioactive spider, at first his body has a flu-like reaction, but soon his DNA adapts, giving him un-limited power & strength, he soon ajust to his new-found sense of self, & like \\"Batman\\" doesn't become a crime fighter until crime hits him personally, Willem Dafoe is here as the Green Goblin who wrecks vengence on those responsible for ousting his alter-ego Norman Osbourne in his research for super strength, it is this action that draws the attention of Peter & his alter-ego, Dafoe is at times quite comical especially when Norman apologizes for being late for a diiner date in which he declares that \\"work was murder today, sorry I am late\\" as the Green Goblin wrecks havoc on NY, Spiderman leaps into action & the showdown is quite good, at one point he even suggest Spidey join him, a tempting offer, but he refuses & the Goblin then goes after Mary Jane in an attempt to lure Spidey into a trap, which he does & the two fight it out on what appears to be the Brooklyn Bridge with Mary Jane's fate hanging in the balance, this is where the special effects really come to life, & is a real treat, with a sequel on the way, one can only wonder if it will be ruined the way \\"Batman\\" & \\"Superman\\" were ruined with their seqeuls, hopefully not, but likely, overall a good movie!!!
B00004T1NA|3.0|At first when i obtained this album the impression the music gave me was of a throwaway.  It didn t get through to me, the way it did a few months later.<br />This album by P T is pretty good.  In fact it is one of their best.  From an objective point of view I have to say that out of the 10 songs that grace this record.  3 are not my cup of tea.  The others are purely intelligent, and well crafted pieces (i.e  `How is your life today, Russia on ice, shesmovedon)<br />An interview on the p t web site asked Steve wilson how he came up with the music for his songs, and his response was `sometimes weeks can go by without a single decent piece of music, but then all of the sudden 3 songs are formed.'  He then went on and said that 2 or 3 of the songs on Lightbulb sun were done this way, or also on the road in hotel rooms etc.<br />Being a big fan of this band i have to say that after `Signify' the band to my opinion suffered somewhat of a distrophy in musical terms.  Objectively, the albums such as `Up the downstair', or the sky moves sideaways which were easier to listen, and that you `got' them right away had come to an end.<br />What i am trying to say is that although P T has changed musically, they are still an excellent band to listen to, or see live if you can, keeping in mind that their musical style has changed.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Since I just recently purchased the DVD of this animated classic, this seemed like an appropriate time to write a review on this wonderful film.  Walt Disney's animated fairy tale is the movie by which all Disney films, and indeed all animated films must be compared to.<br />I remember when I first saw this film in the theater as a kid (possibly on its 1987 release), I was completely blown away.  This film can stand up to the best animated films made today.  The wonderfully detailed animation is quite remarkable, especially when you realize that this was during the days when everything was hand drawn.  Even in this era of computer animation, animated films rarely reach this level of expertise.  The rich colours seem to jump at you out of the screen.  As for the songs, they are so well known that many people can hum them by heart.  \\"Whistle While You Work\\", \\"I'm Wishing\\", \\"Heigh-Ho\\", and \\"Someday My Prince Will Come\\" have all entered into public conscienceness.  I'll never forget the queen's terrifying transformation into an old hag.  Has anyone noticed the irony in the queen's needing to turn into an ugly hag in order to stay the fairest in the land?<br />Disney doesn't forget to add some humour.  For a kids film with such grim subject matter (an evil queen trying to kill her step-daughter), humour is a vital necessity.  I love the way Disney gave each dwarf a distinct personality.  There's Doc, Happy, Sneezy, Grumpy, Sleepy, Bashful, and Dopey, all named for obvious reasons.  I loved the scenes where Sneezy's chronic hayfever causes the dwarves to be blown across the room like in a hurricane.  It's terribly amusing to hear Grumpy expressing disdain over Snow White's cooking (\\"Careful, it might be witch's brew!\\"), and Snow White's policy of cleanliness.  Then there's poor Dopey getting selected to investigate what it is that is laying upstairs.  The forest animals are not without moments of their own, the scene where the animals help Snow White to clean the dwarfs'cottage is one of the film's most delightful moments.<br />All that being said, I have a couple of minor quibbles.  It occured to me that Snow White herself is rather poorly drawn.  Her features are all vague and without great detail.  It's odd that a film with such otherwise great animation could do such a poor job on its main character.  Also, the person who voices Snow White speaks in too high a voice.  But it's to this film's credit that such problems can only be noticed by nitpickers.<br />\\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'\\" release in 1937 was unexpectedly timely.  In Europe, Hitler was viciously persecuting the Jews, while Stalin was conducting his brutal purges of suspected enemies.  The way the dwarves take in Snow White and shield her from the evil queen can be compared to the way brave and kindly people hid the Jews from Hitler's Gestapo.  But these comparisons are probably accidental.<br />\\"Snow White and the Seven Dwars\\" is not just a great family film, but one of the greatest of all films.
0060989157|4.0|I bought this book because as a teenager, I loved Motley Crue.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but I really enjoyed it.  The book gives detailed descriptions of the band members' lives and careers, told by the guys themselves.  They all grew up \\"dysfunctional,\\" and their life stories are funny, sad, tragic, and unforgettable.<br />The book also describes - in often shocking detail - the guy's sexual misadventures, extreme drug and alcohol abuse, and their musical ups and downs.<br />But to me, the most interesting and surprising chapters deal with the emotional turmoil of each band member:  Singer Vince Neil's struggles to overcome the cancer-related death of his baby daughter; Drummer Tommy Lee's experience with domestic violence and jail; Guitarist Mick Mars' painful muscle disease; Bassist Nikki Sixx's father-abandonment issues... and the list goes on.<br />The book works on many levels:  A funny look into the lives of four screw-ups who made it big; a disturbing journey into the world of groupies, drugs, and the business of rock n' roll; and a fascinating commentary on how fame and fortune cannot protect you from the painful wounds of life.<br />Highly recommended!
B000063TNH|5.0|Traffic is not a movie that can be easily described. It is pure genius. From the great screenplay to the superb acting, and the real standout: Steven Soderbergh's fantastic direction. The movie focuses on an issue that needs to get more attention. Yes, you are probably saying that drugs gets enough attention. Everybody hears that drugs are bad, but that's all they hear. Nobody sees how it affects everybody surrounding the people wh use them. Totally engrossing, fast paced, and simply amazing. This is #1 on my all-time movie list. Hands down.
0452282152|2.0|I must have read another book.  After reading so many good reviews on this book I ran out and bought it.  I should have saved my $13.  It just seemed like through the entire book you were waiting for something to happen, anything! But it never does. There is really no turning point, no pinnacle moment in the entire story.  I fell in love with the characters, but it just seemed like the author didn't know what to do with them once she created them. Save the $13 and see a good movie.

B0000542D2|5.0|One of the best films to feature The Beatles, A Hard Day's Night captures a lost era in pop music and cinema. Writer Alan Owun followed the band around as part of his research incoporating actually comments and observations that the band made into his funny screenplay. Night represents a high water mark for the band; it's the first and only album  where all the material was written by John &amp; Paul. Lennon was very prolific during this period composing the bulk of the 13 tracks that ended up on the UK soundtrack and spread out over two albums in the US.<br />Richard Lester's direction was sharp, witty and groundbreaking when Night came out. His approach shaped the film, music and television world for sometime. The Monkees television series was an attempt to recreate some of Lester's tricks used in this film and Help! the follow up. In many respects, Lester's musical sequences are among the first &quot;music videos&quot; in terms of style and content.<br />The DVD comes stuffed with extras. The shorts and comments from those directly or indirectly involved in the film is still quite interesting. While I admire MGM/UA's version of Yellow Submarine (it looks stunning and the unfinished sequences and interviews with those who did the voiceovers are quite interesting), I wish that they had taken this approach to that film. The only think missing of note are comments from the most important folks involved--John, Paul, George and Ringo. Since they put forth most of their views in the Anthology perhaps it was felt that including them here would just duplicate that experience. Regardless, we could do with some fresh insight from Paul and Ringo and even audio commentary from Lennon's many interviews would have been welcome.<br />The picture quality is sharp and crisp. A lot of care was obviously taken in the transfer to DVD. This is the second time around for the film and it is an improvement over the first although some fans would be hard pressed to tell the difference.<br />The sound is nothing short of stunning and hopefully represents the type of upgrades we will see on the soundtrack album when it is re-released. One of the best early albums The Beatles made, A Hard Day's Night has held up remarkable well nearly 40 years later. Extras that might have been included (but aren't) could have included a DVD Audio or SACD version of the album, a replica of the press book and one sheet that came with the movie (suitable for framing of course). Still, the extras included here are nice and informative if not always as groundbreaking as the film itself.<br />A great DVD that recaptures the glory of early Beatlemania, A Hard Day's Night stands as one of the best rock movies ever made. It's well worth purchasing.br />The sound is nothing short of stunning and hopefully represents the type of upgrades we will see on the soundtrack album when it is re-released.

B00005JKJA|5.0|I have to say this film, Mulholland Drive is the best film, I have ever seen. The first time I viewed it, I hated it because it made no sense to me. But after viewing it, about 8 other times...i finally appreciated it. For all those who think this film would have a basic story structure. I have read past reviews on this film here, on amazon..and I was interested in how some hated it, and how it was a piece of garbage, and i quote \\"If u like this movie, you were forced to deal with it by the critics\\"!. Well, I have to say u must give this movie a chance at least, trully I have loved it too death..and David Lynch is simply a brilliant director!!!! Give it a try
B00006FXB6|5.0|Honestly this is the first Queens album i have ever bought. i had heard plenty of their songs before &quot;no one knows&quot; came on the radio, but i had never gotten the ambition to go out and buy a cd for some reason.  well im definately glad i did this time. &quot;songs for the deaf&quot; opens with &quot;You think I aint worth a dollar, but i feel like a million&quot; a very fast and catchy track, with screaming galore, and a great continuous riff.  &quot;no one knows&quot; is second, its a good choice for the first single, i like it alot. the 4th song &quot;song for the dead&quot; is also a standout, as well as &quot;the sky is falling&quot;, &quot;six shooter&quot;, &quot;hangin tree&quot; and &quot;do it again.&quot; all of the tracks here are good in their own way and i highly recommend it. one of the best ive bought this year.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Joss Whedon what a wonderful episode this was.  Keep up the good work.  The CD sounds great and easily beats out anything my TV could put out.  Even though not all of the actors or actresses have good singing voices they really pulled it off.  Bravo!
0385503954|5.0|I haven't loved a book like I loved this book in ages. I'll admit that it was slow-going for the first bit, but mainly because it demands a slow, careful reading. McEwan's characterizations are incredible and the layers that he weaves throughout this novel are truly incredible. <BR>The way the first section weaves back and forth through time and the characters conciousness is amazing--the unfolding and deepening of the tragic scene had me rushing to read more. He also brings each person and scene vividly to life through his precise and mesmerizing use of language throughout the novel.<BR>I can't recommend this book highly enough -- I finished it over a month ago and I still get literally mad at some of the characters and teary at the heartbreaking ending.
B00004W199|4.0|What is it about this film, that makes me want to watch it again and again?  It can't be the special effects; they are laughable.  It can't be the sound; the dubbing is the worst I've ever seen.  It can't be stellar performances by all involved; some of the acting and dialogue are horribly corny.<br />I think what makes this movie special, what has earned it a cult following, is that it traps the viewer within its own world, a claustrophobic, washed-out black and white world, a world on the edge of twilight heading inexorably toward an eternal darkness, a world where the heroine is slowly led to her doom, in spite of her desperate attempts to escape.  Lots of horror movies try to create this feeling of &quot;no exit&quot; but most try to do it with silly fright gimmicks and fail miserably.  This one uses a slowly constricting, strangely palid atmosphere centered on one character's increasingly odd experiences, eerie organ music, excellent cinematography, and an expressionistic landscape (a spider web shuddering on tree branches; a dark, abandoned carnival pavilion seen off on the horizon, a car pulled from a muddy river) to create a surrealistic sense of horror.  Candace Hilligoss, who only made this and one other horror film, turns in a stunning performance reminiscent of Kim Novak in Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo: distant, vulnerable, refined, yet repressed.  It's exactly what was needed here, and it makes her one of the most memorable horror actresses ever, in my book.
0385720920|1.0|... I absolutely hated this book, and it's not because I'm too squirmish to read stuff about sex -- and in fact, one of the only enjoyable/funny things about his main character was the way he used 'are you a sex addict?' checklists and their meetings to find new ways and methods of having sex/masturbating/etc.<BR>But overall, I felt the subject matter was used mainly for shock's sake alone and that a catalog of disgusting facts does not a plot nor a character make. I found Palaniuk's writing repetive...<BR>All the characters are detestable, which is fine if they're interesting, but I found them all flat.<BR>At the end of the book, I felt I had learned nothing about society or what it's like to be a sex addict, or even what it would be like to have a crazy nutcase mother -- so instead I was left with only a feeling of having wasted my time.
0395193958|5.0|Well, what can I say about the Lord of the Rings that has not already been said?  I first read these tales when I was a teenager and have re-read them several times since then and it never gets old.  As an aspiring author myself, I unabashedly marvel at J.R.R. Tolkien's imaginative genius.  Tolkien was not satisfied with merely writting a good story, he created an entire intricate mythology through which, like a master storyteller of yore, he tells an ageless moral story, while taking the reader on one of the most wondrous adventures ever written.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck has outdone himself this time around.  As the opening E chord was strummed, I was hooked.  From slow lap-steel to luxurious full string arrangments, 'Sea Change' takes the listener to places of stress-free and sometimes sad existance.  70's influences show through on such standout examples as &quot;Golden Age&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Tears&quot; which reflects Neil Young's 'Harvest' and ELO's 'Eldorado' respectively.  <BR>Although not overdone with his usual electronic zoo, Beck still delivers some neat tricks like &quot;Golden Age's&quot; seemingly endless vocal reverb.  Keep 'em coming just like this, Mr. Hansen.
B000069HK2|4.0|Listening to this cd has definatly been a great expiernce for me.Now a days this genre of music is growing more and more away from the indapendant scene and into the &quot;popular&quot; crowd.These guys stay with the indie sound that we all know and love.The song &quot;The Tast Of Ink&quot; is the stand out track on here followed close by &quot;A Box Full Of Sharp Objects&quot; and &quot;Blue And Yellow&quot;.All the songs on here are very good.&quot;On My Own&quot;is a great acoustic melody and &quot;Maybe Memories&quot; and &quot;Buried Myself Alive&quot; are great songs to pump you up.The Other songs on the cd are also great so be sure to pick this one up.The reason why this cd didnt get 5 stars is cuz one or two songs dont have a great melody to it.(i rate really hard so if u see me give a 5 out the cd is really worth a 5).If ur into the new indie-punk genre thats growing very rapidly(I.E Alkaline Trio,Taking Back Sunday,Thursday)then ull really like this one.
0425173895|5.0|When a spinster friend of Roger Ackroyd commits suicide, she sends a letter to him revealing she was being blackmailed. He reveals this to his friend Dr James Sheppard, but not the identity of the blackmailer. After Ackroyd is murdered, his niece turns to Dr Sheppard and his neighbor Hercule Poirot to solve the murder and to find her fianc who's the prime suspect. Poirot soon finds that everyone connected to the case has something to hide, which creates some confusion at first, but it's not enough to halt Poirot from solving the case. Dame Agatha Christie's remarkable storytelling and innovative structure make this one of her most memorable mysteries.
B00005RY7X|4.0|Let me start out by saying that I bought this album for \\"Party Hard,\\" and I thought it was worth it.<br />Yes, all the songs are very similar. And as for the lyrics-- yes, they lack the cleverness of the Ramones. However, it is very energetic. Emotionally, it gets you pumped up and makes you feel like you want to go do something positive but violent (or at least physically challenging). The last time I listened to this album, I wound up cleaning my living room & rearranging all the furniture!<br />I think that people who respond primarily to the emotional energy of music will enjoy the album.
B0000542D2|5.0|Why is this my favorite film? Well, for one thing, I've seen it scores of times and it still sends thrills through me at times and still makes me laugh at others. <br />Lennon snorting Coke-- the drink, not the powder; \\"Hey, Mister, can we have our ball back!\\"; The world's first glimpse of Patti \\"Layla\\" Boyd/Harrison/Clapton; the \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" section, which may qualify as the invention of music video; god, I could describe this whole movie and every scene is a keeper.<br />And quite frankly, if you don't choke up during the final \\"concert\\" scene, when Richard Lester's camera falls on the desparate blonde girl in the audience calling for her favorite Beatle in vain, then you probably don't have a soul. That is \\"Beatlemania\\" wrapped up in a five-second shot. It is at once mysterious and heartbreaking.<br />And Wilfred Brambell as Paul's grandfather! Definitely the supporting actor nomination that got missed for 1964. What a riot!<BR>Thanks to him, I have to stifle the urge to say, \\"I bet you're a great swimmer\\" whenever I meet a buxom woman...<br />Enough. Just go buy this. Go!....Go!
0060930187|3.0|I would love to rate this book as a five star, but it would honestly be not because of the quality of this book but because of the great admiration I have for the author. Sylvia Plath has a natural talent for poetry that is dark, lucid and sharp in its heartfelt emotion. Trust that when you read her poetry, it will absorb you and you will walk away drenched in it; it will hang on you in your daily life like a shadow. I strongly recommend reading Sylvia's poetry, specifically Arial and The Colossus. The Bell Jar does not tap into the writing skills that Sylvia is capable of. Perhaps it is because it is more of a recount, a truthful story than a visually painted portrait of the truth that she creates with surrealist imagery in her poems and even in her personal journals. This woman can write on a level of no other. In comparison to her other work this book seems almost written by someone else, or a child Sylvia. I did in fact read this book very quickly in anticipation of what depth Sylvia was to expose of herself. I believe she did just that in this book, in fact it was almost verbatim her life, with names and places slightly changed. Considering that Sylvia's life ended by her own hand, it's frightening to realize how honest this book was regarding her loss of hope. One can't help but wonder if in fact Sylvia planned this book (or it just simply is) her voice crying out from the grave, because it is in fact saying everything that this book is saying; I speak the truth, here is my pain.
B000058983|2.0|In the Deluxe edition, the sound has been greatly improved over the original CD release. 30 minutes of extra tracks have been added.  The bonus tracks do not make this worth getting, but the improved sound quality does (if you are a Love fan).<br />This album sounds really dated. I remember when it came out, that it already sounded dated (I am dating myself). Compare this to what Jefferson Airplane or the Doors were doing at the time.<br />The album has only two good tracks, Alone Again Or and Bummer in the Summer, which is like an early rap tune. The rest are annoying folk ballads, some with horrible lyrics.

John Belushi comes down the stairs, grabs the guitar, smashes it<BR>and then raises his eyebrow and gives a sorry shrug. <br />The bonus tracks are more of the same, only some are even worse. The first track of Your Mind and We Belong Together is of studio outtakes trying to get the intro riff correct. It is repeated over and over with someone making rude comments inbetween takes. Then, an instrumental version of the song follows. The second track of of Your Mind and We Belong Together is the complete song with vocals. The instrumental version was actually very nice, but it gets ruined when the horrid vocals and lyrics are added.<br />This album is a critics favorite, so I obviously don't know what I am talking about. But, I can think of tons of albums from the same time period that are much more important than this one.
B000002J1U|5.0|After releasing two of the most phenomenal albums in the hard rock genre in one year (1969), and not forgetting that they were their debut and second albums, Led Zeppelin turned round in 1970 with a follow up album that fooled everybody. How do you do this? Simple. Completely change the formula. Not content with ruling the hard rock world, they wanted the lot. Let me explain by leading you through this varied album.<br />Up first is the perfect opener in \\"Immigrant Song\\" (blatantly ripping off the riff from Bali Hai, I mean if you're going to steal something do it with class), a thumping rocker that could have been on Led Zeppelin Two. So no surprise there then, perhaps just a warning to any usurper of their Hard Rock Crown, to not even think about it. But then, Drop of the Jaw, we are into sprightly folk/rock with \\"Friends\\", an acoustic number which features John Bonham playing tabla drums. This was certainly not what this dog expected, Next up we got \\"Celebration Day\\", and what a celebration it is, too, with rocking acoustic guitar, Robert Plant wailing \\"How Happy He Is\\" (not surprising, really, as he'd gone from total obscurity to fronting the worlds biggest selling band),and Jimmy Page laying down some awesome electric guitar to bring the song to an exciting finish. Next is the album's central track \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\", (to this album what \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" was to the next), a blues work out not equaled at the time or I would defy anybody to defy me, since. A seven minute epic about love lost, the singing and instrumentation are at an all time high. John Bonham's drumming is as powerful, whilst subtle, as ever. John Paul Jones contributes to the dark feel of the song with an excellent back-alley organ riff. Jimmy Page's heartbreaking guitar solo in the middle is simply mind bending. And as for Robert Plant, he quite possibly delivers one of the most magnificent vocal performances of his career. Next up, which would have been the closing song on side one in the days of vinyl, is \\"Out On The Tiles\\", a hard rocking electric workout with a strong bass beat, which extols the virtues of hard living.<br />From here on out, instead of blasting away, Led Zeppelin simply laid back, got the acoustics out, and put down 5 songs that wouldn't have gone amiss on any folk album. \\"Gallows Pole\\" another poach in a remake of a lead belly song, begins with a soft acoustic grove but soon builds into a rousing crescendo. Both, \\"Tangerine\\" and \\"That's The Way\\", have great acoustics, heartfelt lyrics, and real feel, which all contribute to this back to back emotional punch. The album closes with the lilting \\"Bron-Y-Aur-Stomp\\" and the quite frankly bizarre tribute to their mate \\"Hats Off To (Roy) Harper\\".<br />All in all a very complete collection of songs keeping Led Zeppelin secure in their castle for another year. I would conclude by saying that this is probably Led Zeppelin's most creative, thoughtful, and introspective album.<br />Mott the Dog.one in the days of vinyl, is \\"Out On The Tiles\\", a hard rocking electric workout with a strong bass beat, which extols the virtues of hard living.<br />From here on out, instead of blasting away, Led Zeppelin simply laid back, got the acoustics out, and put down 5 songs that wouldn't have gone amiss on any folk album. \\"Gallows Pole\\" another poach in a remake of a lead belly song, begins with a soft acoustic grove but soon builds into a rousing crescendo.

0679601686|5.0|Someone once said that a classic work of literature is one which everyone loves to be able to acknowledge having read but which no one actually enjoys reading.  To be fair, there is some justification in this sentiment, as many classic novels are not readily accessable to readers not versed in various literary devices, symbolism, and so on.  Fortunately, Pride and Prejudice does NOT fall into that category.  It is a novel which has an interesting, captivating story that is easily accessible and humorous yet intelligent, insightful and extremely witty--in short, it's a novel which is a joy to read and re-read.  It is also my favourite Austen novel.<br />Briefly, for those unfamiliar with the novel, the story concerns Miss Elizabeth Bennet, a spirited, quick-witted and intelligent (not to mention beautiful) young woman from a family of modest means, and the wealthy Mr. Darcy, a handsome but very reserved and indeed proud young man.  Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth albeit against his will (for he deems her to be socially inferior and cannot abide her silly mother and sisters).  Elizabeth (who displays a quickness to judge others based on appearances and \\"first impressions\\"), however, does not care for the arrogant, proud, ill-mannered Mr. Darcy.  It is the tension between these two main characters that comprises the central story and gives it its spark.  I won't say any more, for I don't wish to give the story away.  Suffice it to say that although it takes place some 200 years ago, it is every bit as relevant today as it was then, for human nature is no different now than it ever was.<br />Now to address the merits of this particular edition.  (As reviews unfortunately are posted next to all editions, regardless of the one to which they may apply, the edition to which I refer is the hardcover Modern Library edition with the picture of Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle on the cover).  Generally, when one is looking to purchase a hardcover of one of the classics it is because one is looking for an edition that will be a more permanent addition to his or her library--one that looks nice and that can, perhaps, be passed on to future generations.  Personally, my first choice for hardcovers of the classics are those published by the Folio Society.  Having said that, this edition has a lot to recommend it.  Most importantly, it is printed on acid-free paper, so it will last without the pages turning brown (unlike those nice-looking but disappointingly cheap-quality bargain hardcovers one usually finds on the sale table in one's local bookstore).<br />Secondly, the print is beautifully crisp and clear.  The print is not as large as one might hope for in a hardcover, but it is a vast improvement over the cheap \\"mass market\\" type paperbacks.  Actually, I was surprised to find that it's only minimally smaller than my Easton Press edition, although the lines are further apart in the latter edition (which does make a bit of a difference).<br />As if that's not enough to recommend this edition, it has the added benefit of being housed in a very attractive dust jacket which looks beautiful alongside the BBC/A&E video collection--the definitive dramatisation of the novel and definitely a must-see.  (This edition was initially released as a companion to the video collection).<br />In conclusion, I give 5 stars for the story, and I have no hesitation in giving 5 stars for the Modern Library edition of the novel--it's a lovely edition.  Considering the quality, it is very well priced--definitely good value for one's money.  And for those who've steered clear of the classics for fear that they must necessarily be dull and incomprehensible, give this novel a try--I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Highly recommended!
B0000640VN|5.0|Kate and Leopold is another movie that demonstrates that love has no barriers, especially 130 years!  Kate, a modern woman, who is still having emotional instabilitity from her ex-boyfriend who lives in the apartment above thinks that all men are pigs, and that true love really never exists.  Leopold, Duke of Albany, is a man of the late 19th century.  Trying to find a bride with a rich family, otherwise he loses his inheritance from his jerk of an uncle.  By the way, he's British and his family lost their money.  Leopold gets transported into the year 2001, and his world is turned upside down.  He meets Kate, who is much different from the women he used to court.  Leopold teaches Kate that chivalry still exists, and Kate teaches him the ways of the modern century.  They fall in love, meanwhile Kate's ex-boyfriend(and Leopold's great-great-grandson), is in the hospital for a mishap.  Leopold is transported back 1876, and Kate has no idea.  Well, that's enough to intrigue to see this movie.

B000002I25|5.0|After bringing their somewhat revolutionary sound around the LA club circuit for 2 years, the Doors released their debut album. Recorded in just a week or 2, the Doors made one of rock's most eerie, musical and amazing albums.Jim Morrison's dark and trippy poetry is evident in &quot;Break On Through,&quot; &quot;Crystal Ship,&quot; and &quot;End of the Night.&quot; The Doors also had a pop sensibility, on &quot;Light My Fire,&quot; and the unusual adaptation of a Kurt Weill song (&quot;Alabama Song (Whiskey Bar)&quot;), but it still was amazing. A lot of this album pays attention to their rocking-blues roots (Soul Kitchen, 20th Century Fox, and the cover of Willie Dixon's Back Door Man). <BR><BR>The focal point of this album is the 11-minute finale, &quot;The End,&quot; a dark, mysterious, and unsettling song with Eastern influenced rhythms, Ray Manzarek's organ, and lyrics starting off about a romantic breakup but then transforming into an Oedipal, and violent frenzy, all contained in the psyche of Jim Morrison. It even got them fired from the Whiskey-a-Go-Go in 1966 after Jim said the infamous &quot;Mother.. I want to..&quot; I think you get the idea. It really is one of the best songs the Doors ever did, and very strange for such a period of optimistic muisc and the genesis of flower power. Many regard this as their best, but this was the beginning of a very interesting career for a very influential and seminal band.
B00000AFGM|4.0|Marilyn Manson - the band - isn´t a whole lot more proficient musically than KISS (which is pretty bleak).  What really elevates them above bands like KISS and, say, Alice Cooper is the intelligence and creativity they put into their music.  Marilyn Manson is, of course, the mastermind pulling the levers.<br />The music on this album is often very heavy like previous MM albums, but this time around they experiment with Glam rock (such as on the harsh and brilliant \\"User Friendly\\") and New Wave synthesisers (\\"New Model No. 15\\").  Unfortunately, they chose to not only imitate David Bowie but directly rip off his song \\"Fame\\" for \\"I Don´t Like the Drugs.\\"  The similarities are undeniable and I´ve sometimes wondered why Bowie never sued or if MM had to pay him off in secret or something.  DEspite that, the song has merit, especially in the lyrics which poke fun at \\"norm life.\\"<br />The album is drenched in negativity, but once you get to \\"The Last Day on Earth\\" you realize it´s not meant to be taken so seriously.  MM has a lot to say about our way of life.  Overall, a brilliant album
B000002JSN|5.0|I always saw this is kind of their \\"White Album,\\" due to the double-LP format and the amount of diversity contained in the album itself. This record covers hard rock, folk, AOR songs, epics, early rock and roll, Eastern music, and weird synth music all crammed into 15 songs and 80 minutes. Because of that it's my favorite Zeppelin album. It even took songs from sessions dating all the way back to 1970! <BR><br />Some of my personal favorite Zep songs are on this record, \\"Ten years Gone,\\" \\"the Rover,\\" \\"In The Light\\" and \\"Kashmir,\\" songs I regularly play on my guitar. I've even grown to like the homage to early rock and roll (such as Elvis) on \\"Boogie With Stu.\\" Zeppelin still could rock (on songs like \\"Sick Again\\" \\"Custard Pie\\" and \\"Houses of the Holy\\"), but they also let all of their other diverse influences of the past meet each other on this album. Before this, Zeppelin's previous 5 albums had their own style or sound; I blues-rock, II hard rock, III rock/folk, IV super-rock/folk, Houses of the Holy rock and synths.. It's very interesting to hear the many genres and styles on the same record because it really didn't have that surprising effect on all of the others. <BR><BR>Almost any rock band can base a lot of music on songs off of Physical Graffiti. It's one of those records you can sit through the enitre record. I usually don't skip over any songs when I listen to it.<BR><BR>and HOW CAN I FORGET \\"IN MY TIME OF DYING?\\" The 11-minute blues-rock jam. I love the ascension of the song, as Jimmy Page plays his guitar louder and heavier, and John Bonham completely shreds the skins of his drum kit, and of course Robert Plant wailing. One of the highest points on the entire record.<BR><BR>One of many rock essentials that I'll never grow tired of.
B0000009OP|5.0|You can´t really go wrong with any Morphine album.  This band was consistently wonderful.  Great, laid-back lounge music yet far from anonymous.  Easily identifiable from Sandman´s peculiar lead bass lines and smokey voice as well as the brilliant sax fills, not to mention the on-the-mark drumming, too.  They often add other instruments and sounds - sometimes it´s pretty subtle.<br />But whenever I reach for a Morphine album (I have 5), I most often grab this one.  I´ve listened to it over and over in my car and never get sick of it.  I don´t know why exactly, some records just stick to you.  I personally relate to &quot;I´m Free Now&quot; and &quot;Candy.&quot;  &quot;Cure for Pain&quot; may be their best song ever and I definitely relate to that one too.  <br />This is some smooooth, dreamy music, boy.
0345448898|5.0|Pullman is one of the most gifted fantasy writers of the 20th century.  Unlike Tolkein whose focus on creating a world causes him to neglect plot and characterization, Pullman creates an elaborate world (universe), tells an amazingly original story and develops wonderful characters (esp. Will who first appears in book 2).  <BR> <BR>As an historian whose work focuses on Calvinism, I was especially impressed by Pullman's creation---a world in which the Calvinist Reformation succeeded (what a scary place that would have been!). Many critics claim Pullman's work is anti-Christian but it is more of an attack against clerical institutions than an attack against religious belief per se (and ironically, the rebellion which Lyra, her father and Will stage and participate in establishes an alternative religion---that is a world without a God but which has an afterlife---if only b/c it claims that there is no afterlife).  <br />The details in this story are fantastic.  I loved the idea of a world where one's soul is visible and takes on the attributes of the character (I esp. liked the fact that one's daemon assumes a permanent form in puberty).  <br />Lyra is a wonderful character---no, she is not likeable but frankly, her likeability is irrelevant.  What is key is her mission (here Pullman seems to cheat a little---he denies the idea of Calvinist predestination but Lyra's fate is, to some degree, pre-determined).  <br />This book is not intended for young children.  I would recommend it to 14 and 15 year olds---and even then you should be fairly well-read if you want to grasp all of the subtle nuances of the book.  That said, I strongly recommend the book to adolescent girls.  Lyra is a great role model for young girls (her bravery, her intelligence and even her conviction that she is right are characteristics which young girls need to recognize are acceptable and even valuable).
B000068OCS|5.0|I too was concerned about the aspect ratio of the new Koyaanisqatsi DVD, so I e-mailed the people at qatsi.net.  Their reply:<br />\\"The DVD is how the film was and is projected in theatres in a 1:85 format and is how Godfrey Reggio intended it to be seen. The Laserdisc might contain more material because the original photography was shot full frame to be TV safe, but that was not the intended look. We did not control the pressing of the<BR>Laserdisc so it was full frame. <br />The fundraising IRE DVD was full frame as a cost saving measure as it wasbeing done on the cheap. Also it was intended to be different from anything that might be commercially released<br />Consider it a bonus not intended by the Director, rather<BR>than the MGM DVD being less.\\"<br />Thus it would appear that we have the original film as it was intended by the director.

B00004Z459|1.0|Should we marvel or scoff at them ? You decide, but how these guys managed to fill their music with the gist of the trendiest stuff around is nothing short from amazing. Although it's easy to pinpoint the lack of inspiration of such composite material, to make fun of the derivative korn-ish guitar work, vocal eminem-isms and nirvanesque song structures, the result is strangely addictive. It must nevertheless be noted that the initial effect of these tunes wears off very fast. I lent the record a couple months ago, and never thought about it again... The question remains : are these guys able to survive ? Trouble is that the bunch of remixes which stood for their follow-up lends credibility to the fact that these guys have basically got nothing to tell us. So my advice to them would be : take the money and run ! <BR> OR WRITE DECENT TUNES !

630460288X|4.0|The irony that defines this popcorn pleasure can be summed up with the comments of the unimportant little girl to the reporter who questioned the over-all worth of Spartan's rescueing her with such damage, \\"F*ck you, lady!\\" This film came after The Last Boy Scout and before The Professional, so the presence of such a verbally feral child was thankfully breif. <BR>    As for the action, we have some of the best inserted John Wooisms to come out of 1993(Hard Target, aside). Some good jumping,diving, a little of the required two-gun alternation.  There is the Bad Good Guy, and the really likable Bad Guy, and instead of the universal terrorist (Al Leong, where has he gone?) We have, you guessed it... Minnesota Gov.-to-be Jesse Ventura ventilating the \\"evil Mr. Roger's\\" since Pheonix's manchurian reprogramming prevents it. <BR>     Considering the state of Sci-Fi action at the time, it was disappointing that the rest of the movie couldn't live up to the Wile E Coyote pace of the Museum peice. Otherwise a good handing-over of the riens flick for Stallone, to Snipes. Now if Stallone would just get some more \\"Daylight\\" and less \\"Driven\\".<BR>     I can't leave without saying how much this movie benefitted from the presence of the West Coast Automotive Design Industry contribution. Take a could look. Some of those vehicles are prototypes that have hit, and left, the street. Back to the Future, indeed.
B00006FDCD|5.0|This film was indeed one that frightened me since my childhood and continues to do so now.  Tim Curry as &quot;Pennywise&quot; or &quot;IT&quot; is magnificant and the cast creates a natural simplistic feel of a group of children in a eerie small New England town.  If you enjoy Stephen King's work then you'll love this film.  Although some scenes could have been better if allowed to show graphics, the film produces a terrifying response from all viewers.  Not only does it provide a solid storyline, it leaves some scenes to the imagination which at times are incredibly petrifying.  It questions your own town's mystique and will forever make you afraid of clowns.  Enjoy it guys!
B000007T1M|5.0|SOAD is now a major force in alternative/metal music thanks to the success of TOXICITY, which is a great album; but personally I think this self titled release is far better. For starters, the album cannot really be put into any one musical category with an interesting assortment of sounds amongst the usual bass/drum/guitar. Serj Tankian's vocals are amazing. In fact, amazing is not a word that does the man's voice justice. Any singer who can be squeaking lyrics one minute and then emitting death metal roars to rival Cannibal Corpse (Jonathan Crooks rock your body baby!), and still retain credibility must be talented. His lyrics are amazing too. In fact I spent a long time while playing the CD just reading and re-reading the lyric booklet, I hardly ever do that; but these lyrics are something else. The man is a genius! And naturally I also love the anti-establishment angle they have going. Just read the blurb on the back of the CD case and the inner sleeve. With TOXICITY they sort of lost that, but if you love TOXICITY this album is a must have for your collection.
B000002LUB|5.0|I own all the Sabbath albums and this is the absolute best ever released.It is with out a doubt the hardest rocking album Sabbath has ever recorded.
B000063S6Z|3.0|When I hear this album I cant help but amuse myself into thinking that Moby hung out with THE CURE while recording this!<br />The cd as a whole is much darker, lamenting and melancholic.  You will find yourself closing your eyes and brooding more often than jumping up and dancing.  By far, my favorite track on the album is EXTREME WAYS for its catchy piano and signature beats and strings.<br />My only substantial criticism is that he seems to use the SAME piano/strings combination as he did on play.  But its done so often on this album, that you have to wonder if he's just recycling the same loops...  give it a hear, and you'll see what I mean :)
6303073107|5.0|\\"Rashomon\\" is one of those movies you hear allusions to at cocktail parties or see references made to in \\"The Village Voice\\", and you are chagrined because you don't know what everyone else seems to be carrying on about. Then I saw that NYC's Film Forum was showing \\"Rashomon\\" as part of a Kurasawa festival: I said to myself, TutorGal it's now or never! So I rounded up my friend Renee the psychotherapist and went.<br />Wow! Yes, it's clear to see why this movie was such a revelation back in 1950-1 when it appeared on the scene. Compare it, for example, to 1950's Oscar winner, \\"All About Eve\\". At the outset of \\"Eve\\", we're introduced to a tableful of people at an award show, looking at the two-faced Eve accept her award. As we go round the table, we hear every character's thoughts about Eve, and then go back in time to that part of the story. The story, however, moves forward chronologically; we never revisit a scene, either, to see if somebody else perceived it differently. <br />Well, that IS what the hoopla was about with \\"Rashomon\\". We start with three men meeting during a rainstorm in a deserted building. Two tell the third man about the murder trial where they've just given evidence. Then we go back in time to the trial, where we see the various witnesses and the defendant tell their versions of what happened. As they do, we return over and over to the scene of the crime, and each time the murder is enacted differently.  The idea of presenting multiple perspectives of the same incident was ground-breaking for 1950, and has been imitated over the years, but rarely as well as in the original, \\"Rashomon\\". <br />I felt I had to brace myself for seeing this movie, because I read it was about a murder AND a rape, and I balked at seeing a rape scene (yet how many murders would you say you and I have both seen in movies, huh?). However, I was relieved to see that the rape is never shown; that part of the story is always over by the time we revisit the scene. In fact, the woman doesn't even appear to be disheveled. The IDEA of the rape is the important thing, not its enactment on screen. Some have commented on the amount of apparent overacting and screaming going on with both the woman character and Mifune's bandit, but it didn't bother me too much.<br />All in all, this was my first excursion into classic Japanese cinema (unless you would count all those Godzilla and Gidra movies as classics of a sort), and it was not only interesting anthropologically, but entertaining as well. \\"Rashomon\\" is an excellently made movie, and one which every serious movie-goer had ought to see.
068484267X|5.0|Frank McCourt delivers what seems to be a truthful, and at times painful story of his childhood. Although the readers will draw various conclusions, the book is worthwhile and will draw some sort of an opinion from the reader. A very good book, written with humour, knowledge, and more importantly compassion.
B0000542D2|3.0|Since the film was restored and re-released in theaters in Dec. 2000, there has been much impatience for the the DVD release. I placed my pre-order with Amazon (way back in June of 2001), and I know there are other folks out there who did the same thing. We have all been very anxious for the much talked about extra material, interviews, and restored picture and soundtrack - which is why I feel this package falls a bit short and is not quite as satisfying as I had hoped it would be.<br />First things first - The film looks great, no question. Fabulous. The songs jump from our surround system, sounding pristine and full and rich - better than before. But here's where I begin to lose a bit of my enthusiasm...<br />On the first disc (along with the film), is a \\"documentary\\" called \\"Things They Said Today\\" (really just a string of mostly facinating anecdotes/interviews with those who were there at the time) - it's very enjoyable and fun to watch. Just the kind of thing that should be included. But then you get to the second disc, and it's a whole lot more of the same. With mostly the same people. Saying a bit more of the same things they said on the other disc. Now not to say this is totally a bad thing, but why not just make the documentary on the first disc longer and let it be the feature on the second disc? Why not include more of these other interviews instead of repackaging it on to another disc as if it were something different from what's offered on the first? Of course I know the real reason is marketing, but two discs are supposed to be better than one - not just more of what's already been said.<br />In my humble opinion, what should have been included are some of the film's outtakes (which do exist - there's only a teeny taste of that here with a few mistakes and some \\"Ringo/This Boy\\" footage), and the entire famous \\"lost scene\\" of Paul and the Showgirl talking backstage, which was cut from the original film. That stuff is truly priceless, and would have been a real treat to watch. It also would have been a great gift to fans everywhere. And where is the \\"Running, Jumping, Standing Still\\" short that was supposed to be included? This was a short film by Richard Lester that the Beatles had seen and enjoyed - it's one of the things that made them more comfortable about working with him...<br />My last, but possibly biggest issue with this set - they seem to have interviewed everyone who is still alive that had anything to do with the film - BUT WHERE ARE THE (remaining) FABS??? It is sooo obvious that the only interviews missing here are Paul's and Ringo's - and if they dug around in the \\"archives\\" a bit, I'm sure they would have found John and George talking about the filming also. To me, it seems their rememberances should have been the first order of business when deciding what to include in this package.<br />I didn't mean to go on so long, and despite everything I've said, for the price, it's definitely \\"a keeper\\" - worth purchasing for the DVD library for sure. But I'm just a wee bit sorry that, to me, it didn't quite live up to the pre-release hype.n a real treat to watch. It also would have been a great gift to fans everywhere.

0316666343|5.0|Susie Salmon is a typical 14 year old, experiencing puberty and love for the first time. She is very close to her family and usually does not cause much trouble. In spite of this, one day Susie goes to school and never returns.<br /> Susie's disappearance has devastated her family. They cannot imagine where she might be since she is not the type to run away from home. The Salmon family is feeling hurt, scared, and uncertain as they wonder if they will ever see Susie again. Instead of leaning on each other to get through this awful<br />time, they all turn away from each other. Ultimately, the family gets confirmation that Susie has been murdered. Meanwhile, Susie is in heaven and her heart is breaking for the family that she loves and misses. She fears that they will never find out who committed this horrible crime.<br /> In Alice Sebold's haunting new novel The Lovely Bones, you are able to see through Susie's eyes and join her on her journey. Experiencing Susie's murder was a poignant and frightening experience. I felt a wealth of emotions while reading this amazing book. I felt sadness, fear, anger and ultimately hope. I<br />also found myself wondering if Susie's heaven is the heaven that we all hear about. This is a beautifully written book and I highly recommend it to others.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks

Yes, the book is controversial and that is what makes it worth reading.  You will either hate it or love it but either way your time will have been well spent.

6305078181|3.0|I must have seen this film a dozen times in the theatres when it first came out, and probably know most of the dialogue!  Frank Langella was every woman's dream as Dracula, the Hunk.  Even though the screenplay didn't accurately reflect the novel, it was nonetheless engaging, beautifully filmed and acted, and parts are truly frightening.  It's one of my favorite films of the genre.<br />But alas, I am so disappointed with the DVD.  I don't know if I'm the only one, but the copy I bought is very washed out color-wise.  I distinctly remember the film in beautiful, &quot;living&quot; (ahem)color.  The DVD was almost in sepia tone, except for the infamous &quot;Bat Love&quot; scene.  Has anyone else noticed this? Curious minds would love to know!
B000002KHH|5.0|Paranoid is propably Black Sabbath's ultimate achievement. Maybe it is the ultimate achievement of metal the past 30 years. If you just started to listen to metal, this album is a must. If you are an old dog, then you already know what I am talking about.<BR>Black Sabbath was at the time, years ahead of their time. They delivered a very different look on the world, than was usualy present in the musical releases of the day.<BR>Where most musicians sung about \\"Picking flowers in the rain\\", Black Sabbath sung:\\"Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind\\". Sabbath had an entirely different, much darker(more realistic?) view on the world around them. <BR>I think most metal fans will agree with me that Sabbath are the godfathers of heavy metal, and that their contribution to heavy metal is beyond measure.<BR>The albums includes immortal classics like War Pigs, Paranoid and Iron Man. But the fact remains that all the tracks on Paranoid is of very high quality. The jazzy and trippy Planet Caravan, and the evil Electric Funeral and Fairies Wear boots are all top notch. <BR>Honestly it is one of the few albums without any fillers. Everything on this album is relevant, there is not too much or too little.<BR>If you only buy one heavy metal album ever, this should be it. But after hearing it I don't think you will be able to stop yourself from buying more...but do yourself the favour of at least getting this one
0156711427|3.0|Did you ever get the feeling that E.M. Forster didn't like people? <br />That's certainly the feeling I got while reading this book. It's not that it's a bad book, per se, it's just that, well...you kind of get the feeling that Forster doesn't really care about his characters. Instead of pulling you in and making the characters come alive so that they are real to you, and familiar, and friendly, Forster tells his story as if he were a zookeeper describing to you the behavior of the bonobos. There is an unbreachable glass wall between the reader and the characters that makes it hard to connect with or relate to the story. To make matters worse, Zookeeper Forster only seems to describe the bad behavior of the bonobos. He dwells continuously on the bad traits of his characters. He seems to think nothing of ruthlessly pointing out their faults and foibles, and dwelling on them incessantly. He completely humiliates the characters in the eyes of the readers, thus making even the \\"nice\\" characters, such as Dr. Aziz and Mrs. Moore hard to like. The moment you do begin to like any of the characters, Forster immediately returns to his critical mode, and once again exposes and harps on the faults of the characters, driving you quickly back to your former \\"who cares what happens to Adela Quested?\\" feelings. All this combines to result in a cooling of the reader's interest...at least it did in my case. While the story is interesting, and not completely dull, it is hard to get really caught up in a story where you don't care about any of the characters. While I have read worse books, I have also read books that are much better, with more likeable and realistic characters, and more gripping plots. However, this book is a classic, and provides an excellent and compelling look at race relations in 1920s India, and so I would reccommend it for those reasons. But, on the other hand, you can get a better written and more enjoyable read with essentially the same plot by reading \\"To KillA Mockingbird.\\" You'll like the characters better too.

B0000584V3|3.0|I bought this album on the recommendation of a record store clerk whose opinion I respect, and to be honest with you, I wanted to smack him upside the head after my first listen: It just seemed like a hastily concocted set of riffs and tempo changes arranged for maximum flash, with acoustic/electric sections and death/clean vocals juxtaposed in a way that screamed \\"Look at how eclectic we are!\\". Despite this almost completely negative initial reaction, something kept drawing me back to this cd. After several more listens, I've decided that, while I'm not going to join the ranks of enraptured idolizers going into a sputtering frenzy at the mention of \\"Oooooooopeth\\", I can at least appreciate some of what these guys do (and quite a bit of what they are trying to do). The memorable melodies of the clean vocals on \\"Bleak\\", and the distant, dreamy guitars at the beginning of \\"The Drapery Falls\\" are just a couple of the things I've come to like about this album. I still have problems with many of the seemingly arbitrary compositional choices( or if not arbitrary, then designed to impress the naive with pseudo-sophistication). I'm not some musical ignoramus who thinks anything that doesn't sound like Cannibal Corpse is for wusses: my tastes range from the brutally primitive noise of Merzbow and NON, to the dizzyingly multilayered orchestrations of Gustav Mahler and Olivier Messian. Nor am I anti-Prog, though I prefer the sly quirks of Gong, Soft Machine, and King Crimson to the yodeling pomp of Rush and ELP. Once you've surveyed a real breadth of music, Opeth's devices seem a bit calculated at times. Not that this takes away from the sophistication of the band's intentions, and the focus on contrasts has come to seem one of their strengths. In fact, the contrasts aren't drastic enough: the heavy parts aren't heavy enough. This is mainly due to the flat production; the guitars are suitably downtuned, but lack any bristle or bite. These guys are from Sweden: they should get Tagtgren or Skogsberg to produce their next album. The former's work on the latest Immortal album is proof that guitar crunch needn't be sacrificed for clarity and dynamics. With better production and, crucially, a more judicious and less haphazard compositional sense, these talented musicians will more successfully achieve the potential that their interesting concepts promise.Tagtgren or Skogsberg to produce their next album.

B000008HPE|5.0|I first came across Huey Lewis & the News after listening to \\"The Power of Love\\" and \\"Back in Time\\" on the hit movie \\"Back to the Future\\". After taking an immediate liking to their music, I knew I had to find their album. So I picked up \\"Huey Lewis & the News: Fore!\\" and I will never part with it! The 80's have certainly had a great number of music artists and bands, including one of my favorites, \\"The Bangles\\".<br />Originally was called \\"American Express\\", the band played at a Marin County bar. The members were Huey Lewis (main vocals, harmonica), Sean Hopper (keyboards, vocals), Mario Cipollina (bass), Johnny Colla (saxophone, guitar) and Bill Gibson (drums). In 1980, lead guitarist Chris Hayes was added to the group and the band was offered a contract by Chrsalis. When requested that the band change their name, that was when the members chose the name of \\"Huey Lewis & the News\\". Their debut album was recieved with little attention but it was their second album, \\"Picture This\\" in 1982 which began to get some notice with songs \\"Do You Believe in Love\\" (top 10 single) and minor hits \\"Hope You Love Me Like You Say You Do\\" and \\"Workin' for a Livin'\\". <BR>Sports, the group's third album, was released in 1983 and became a multi-platinum success. \\"Heart and Soul\\" (number eight, 1983), \\"I Want a New Drug\\" (number six, 1984), \\"The Heart of Rock & Roll\\" (number six, 1984) and \\"If This Is It\\" (number six, 1984) all became Top Ten hits, and Sports climbed to number one in 1984. Later on it would eventually sell over seven million copies. Their first number one single was \\"The Power of Love\\" (1985) from the soundtrack of \\"Back to the Future\\". <BR>Then came in 1986 their album Fore! which became number with five Top Ten singles \\"Stuck With You\\" (#1, 1986), \\"Hip to Be Square\\" (#3, 1986), \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" (#1, 1987), \\"I Know What I Like\\" (#9, 1987), and \\"Doing It All for My Baby\\" (#6, 1987). But after such a huge success, the band never really afterwards made any hits. Huey Lewis did appear in a few movies though, including very small parts (\\"Sphere\\"), uncredited parts (\\"Back to the Future\\"), and major roles (\\"Duets\\").<br />Here's my song by song review:<BR>1) *JACOB'S LADDER* - A steady rock song, the beat is very cool, especially the bass. The lead guitar is something to listen to, too. (9/10 points)<BR>2) *STUCK WITH YOU* - All together a pretty slow rock song, easy listening and great for slow dancing. I really like the background harmonized vocals! (9/10 points)<BR>3) *WHOLE LOTTA LOVIN'* - Don't be a bit put off by the beginning, I assure the song picks up in a bit. Again some pretty nice background vocals and Huey Lewis can certainly play the harmonica! Groovin' music! (10/10 points)<BR>4) *DOING IT ALL FOR MY BABY - Nice brass and keyboard work. A relatively slower song. ~doing it all for my baby!~ (8/10 points)<BR>5) *HIP TO BE SQUARE* - Definitely my FAVORITE song on this album! Cool beginning to an incredibly cool, funky, hip, and groovy song! GREAT sax! I guarantee, you won't be able to stop from starting to dance! Didn't you know?... it's hip to be square! (10/10 points)<BR>6) *I KNOW WHAT I LIKE* - Leaning towards heavy rock, I love the guitar work in this song. (9/10 points)<BR>7) *I NEVER WALK ALONE* - Another of my favorite songs. The synthesizer is light and blends in great with the beat. The chorus is fun and the harmonizing is perfect! (10/10 points).<BR>8) *POWER OF LOVE* - The hit song from the movie \\"Back to the Future\\", another of my favorites. ~that's the power of love!~ (10/10 points)<BR>9) *FOREST FOR THE TREES* - A song for easy listening, the harmonizing is very pretty, the best part of the song. (10/10 points)<BR>10) *NATURALLY* - A bit different from the rest of the songs on the album. I must admit the vocals are terrific, the effect is great since no instruments are used. But the song is just isn't my cup of tea. (7/10 points)<BR>11) *SIMPLE AS THAT* - An ok song, very light with a minimum amount of instruments, some drums, guitar, and synthesizer are lightly played. (8/10 points)<br />So, if you're a fan of good 80's music, check out \\"Huey Lewis & the News\\". I guarantee you'll love them! \\"Huey Lewis & the News\\" have also made a few music videos including \\"Bad is Bad\\", \\"Hip to Be Square\\", and \\"Couple Days Off\\". The music video \\"Cruisin'\\" from the movie \\"Duet\\" is also great, with Huey Lewis and Gwyneth Paltrow doing a beautiful duet.

B00006ADFL|5.0|HEAVENLY CREATURES is the best film I have ever seen in my life! I first saw it on TV in July this year, and have since been hypnotized by it. I rented the VHS (and subsequently the DVD) the day after I saw it on TV. I have seen it for six times now. I have ordered the DVD of the uncut version on amazon.com. It's intensely mesmerizing, and I was utterly absorbed and consumed by every bit of the emotions the girls portrayed in the film. It's haunting, beautiful, sad, frustrating, innocent. I did research into the murder case online and actually delved into the details of every main character shown in the film. Driven by desperation, I got to the extent of having dreams about the additional 8 minutes of the original film that's not released in the earlier North American version. I deem Peter Jackson the most ingenius and creative film-maker in the modern times. \\"It's all so frightfully romantic\\"!

It contains \\"Novocaine for the Soul,\\" a radio hit that E resents writing enough to never play it live under any circumstances, not to mention many other great and not-so-great pop songs. My main beef with this album is all the cheesy love songs like \\"Beautiful Freak\\" and \\"My Beloved Monster\\" that make the insidious \\"Fresh Feeling\\" seem good in comparison. Don't get me wrong, there's some good songs like \\"Susan's House,\\" \\"Rags to Rags\\" and \\"Flower\\" on here, it's just that the bad ones are really bothersome. Don' t buy this first if you're just getting into the Eels. Instead, try out Electro-Shock Blues or Souljacker.

B000002VMD|4.0|Surprisingly, when Whitney Houston made the leap from music to movies, nobody ever expected the music to be as powerful and enduring as it remains today. Nevertheless, she proved that music did matter in every single film, and every single soundtrack sale that gets highly overlooked for movies.<br />The 1992 soundtrack to The Bodyguard, consists of half the songs Whitney Houston recorded for the film. The songs are just tough and everlasting as they always remain to be. From her mega-hits I Will Always Love You, to Queen Of The Night, and even I Have Nothing. The soundtrack also has other good, strong gems from others, including Joe Cocker's soulful ballad, Trust In Me, and Kenny G's performance with Aaron Neville on Even If My Heart Would Break.<br />While many soundtracks lay into dust these days, because of the lackluster music they create for the films, the music from The Bodyguard is still a constant into the cross between music and movies.

Oh yeah, she can't act to save her life, but never mind that lets get back to the dancing. The Choreography was so cutting edge for the 80's.

B000002HPT|4.0|This album is proof positive that one must allow a fairly lengthy period to 'get to know' a release after purchase. Standard practice you may assume, yet the fact remains that I was severly underwhelmed by this album after the first few listens, especially when comapred to the fact that I was utterly blown away by the three Dream Theater albums I heard previous to this one. So yes, this album takes a while to sink in, although the sound isnt radically different from anything they had done previously. They still play melodic progressive rock, occasionaly it is firmly on the heavy side, although this album seems to largely abandon the crunch heavy dynamics apparent on 'Awake'. Not to say there isnt a lot of spite, anger and energy here, something that imbues Dream Theater with an agressive quality which sets them high above the crowd. For instance 'Burning my soul' and 'Just let me breathe' are intricate, dark and menacing songs which discard massive vocal hooks in favour of torturous instrumentation and extremely impressive lyrics. Then we have 'Hollow years' and 'Anna lee', both of which are radically different: they are lilting, delicate ballads which gradually eneter the mind and take up residence. The obligatory instrumental 'Hells kitchen' is very strong, as most all Dream Theater instrumentals are; we would expect nothing less from such talented musicians. For me the standout track here is the opener 'New Millenium', a fairly unique song which takes the bands sound in yet another direction, although it is fairly hard to describe here. Definitely a number to investigate. Even the epic closer is included here, the 13 minute 'Trial of tears' which,(yes) takes some time to get used to but really is very impressive (how anyone could accuse them of 'selling out' after hearing that song is beyond me). I really think the album could have done without the inclusion of 'You not me' (written with Aerosmith/Bon Jovi collaborator Desmond Child) althougn its hardly a syrupy power ballad, it just doesnt sound like the band I fell in love with. Still, even the weakest album by this band blows most of the oppisition out of the water, so Id definitely recommend this record to any prog fan. And beacuse a slightly more mainstream friendly approach is evident here, Id be tempted to recommend it to any rock or metal fan. Just dont go expecting anything easy to get your teeth into.<br />Good album, superb band.power ballad, it just doesnt sound like the band I fell in love with.

B000069HKH|2.0|To use a sports analogy, I wondered whether \\"The Rising\\" would be like watching the great Willie Mays in his prime, or watching Willie in his final season with the Mets. In 1973, with his best days clearly behind him, Mays fell down in center field while chasing a base hit -- a painful sight for those who remembered his singular greatness.<br />I have listened to \\"The Rising\\" for a month now, and just saw him in concert here in Chicago a few nights back. For me, the verdict is in: The ball is bouncing away from you, Bruce, and you've just hit the turf hard. Could be time for the Paul McCartney/Pete Townshend/Beach Boys nostalgia circuit for you.<br />The 9-11 theme is a brave challenge for any artist to undertake, and clearly Springsteen risks quite a bit in having this theme run through the entire CD. But he doesn't really say anything new about the events and impact of 9-11 that I haven't already seen 57 times before on TV. \\"The Rising\\" contains nothing controversial; in fact, he really doesn't make any kind of statement about 9-11 other than \\"this was a great tragedy.\\" Yes, it was. I don't think about it any differently because of this CD.<br />Springsteen is at his best when he writes about the private anguish and restlessness of the suburban anti-hero -- trapped in a small town or a doomed relationship or a threatening situation. Unfortunately, he hasn't really done this with any kind of impact since \\"Tunnel Of Love\\". So while he goes for a larger issue on \\"The Rising\\", the impact of his songs is negligible, and too many of the lyrics fall into cliche. \\"It's a fairytale so tragic/There's no prince to break the spell/I don't believe in magic/But for you I will, for you I will/If I'm a fool, I'll be a fool/Darlin' for you.\\" This is our American poet laureate?<br />Musically, the songs are weak. \\"Waitin' On A Sunny Day\\" shows flashes of the old Springsteen fire (though I liked it better when it was \\"Hungry Heart\\"), and \\"Nothing Man\\" has an understated, laid-back quality mixed with burning intensity. The rest? Springsteen seems to be going for a gospel-tinged, inspirational feel, but it just doesn't work. At all.<br />I wondered if I was just too harsh on \\"The Rising\\" (I am a huge Bruce fan) before Wednesday's concert at the United Center in Chicago. During the show Springsteen would trot out a 70s war-horse like \\"Badlands\\" or \\"She's The One\\", and the capacity crowd went berserk. Then it was on to two or three straight songs from \\"The Rising\\", and you could just hear the sound of 20,000 butts settling into their seats (unless they were going out for a smoke or to the restroom).<br />By the end of the show, he ran out of wind and was unable to sing the chorus to \\"Born In The U.S.A.\\" The adoring fans carried him through, but as he walked stiffly down the stairs at concert's end, the shouts and cheers ringing about him, I thought of Willie Mays and his diminished skills -- the ball bouncing away from him. You're a Hall of Famer, Bruce. End it here.uality mixed with burning intensity. The rest? Springsteen seems to be going for a gospel-tinged, inspirational feel, but it just doesn't work.

B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is one of the most creative, and inspiring films I have seen in a while. Beautifully filmed, and with a great cast, Amelie is an optimistic love story. Audrey Tautou gave a great performance, and so did the other cast members. My favorite character is the garden gnome. Watch it, and you'll see. I highly recommend this film!
B000069AUI|4.0|There is something faintly embarrassing about liking Coldplay. ... Refined aesthetes shudder. Coldplay are so... nice. The kind of band you would take home to meet your mum. Not quite as bad as Travis, but not exactly the Murder Junkies either. <br />At the same time, it is hard to imagine anyone NOT liking Coldplay. Chris Martin sings in a traditionally pretty, non-whiny non-Thom-Yorke tone of voice, and his pleasant vocals are accompanied by jangly guitars, soft touches of piano and soaring melodic hooks sure to induce melodramatic swooning and portable-cd-player clutching amongst those of a certain age and temperment.<br />My favorite songs from Rush Of Blood To The Head are In My Place and Clocks, but they're all pretty good. Those looking for feedback-heavy experimental dirges or psychedelic raveups will be disappointed, as Coldplay confine themselves to sensitive mid-tempo anthems and ballads suitable for dinner parties and roadtrips. Sporadically beautiful and consistently listenable, Coldplay's sophomore effort will be no disappoinment to fans of Parachutes.
B00005MKEN|5.0|WOW! I havnt heard this CD yet but wow! what a groovey name! I like that name...im not exactly sure what avenged means...or sevenfold for that matter, but thats ok because there songs have lots of big words! YEAH! um...ok im done now. DETROIT ROCKS MAN YEAH!
B000004286|5.0|Even though it's a variation of a Holst riff in &quot;The Planets&quot;, this soundtrack contains one of the best known movie themes of all times. James Horner has guaranteed his place among the greats with this magnificient accomplishment. I've enjoyed the movie and the soundtrack over and over again since its release. Horner knows how to play on emotions and he does it so effectively in this work. <br />I love how he used the bag pipes to validate the music as though it came directly from Scotland. After all, it's a Scotish story, written by Randall Wallace. The flutes in #4 &quot;The secret wedding&quot; are supported warmly by the harp and violin, making it an incredibly emotional component to the entire piece. As far as melodic and soft cues go for this soundtrack, another favorite is #16 &quot;The princess pleads for Wallace's life&quot;. <br />If it's the battle music you want, then you'll like #6 &quot;Revenge&quot; and #10 &quot;The battle of Stirling&quot;. Every emotion imaginable is wrung out of you if you listen to this CD, which is another thing I love about it. You don't have to watch the movie to be able to enjoy the music. It stands on its own, which is something Horner is famous for. I've owned this soundtrack and &quot;More music from Braveheart&quot; for years and I listen to them frequently. This work stands the test of time, and will continue to do so in the future.
B000002A3T|5.0|I'll never figure out how some people hate this album. Sure, it's not \\"The Final Cut\\" or \\"The Wall\\", but it's still an excellent make-up for the weaker Momentary Lapse of Reason.<BR>   <BR>   In my opinion, the best Floyd albums are:<BR>1- The Final Cut (1983)<BR>2- The Wall (1979)<BR>3- Dark Side of The Moon (1973)<BR>4- Animals (1977)<BR>5- The Division Bell (1994)<br />  The best songs on The Division Bell are \\"Poles Apart\\", \\"Wearing<BR>The Inside Out\\", \\"Marooned\\", \\"Coming Back to Life\\", and \\"High Hopes\\"
B000002JOH|5.0|This is my first Pantera album and certainly not my last. If you love heavy metal and don't like this album, I think that a santarium is the abosolute perfect place for you to spend the remainder of your life. All the one star reviews really make me sick and give me periodic spasms of pain and anger blistering in my veins. Why is the average rating for this 4.2 stars? it's far beyond that!! Those people probably don't even listen to the music. They are missing out on all the fun (or just don't like it). Pantera is loud but not very distorted, brutal yet technical, foul-mouthed and tough but send out a couple nice messages (see for yourself in \\"F.Hostile\\" and \\"No Good/Attack The Radical\\"). For an album that is this \\"commercial\\" (not like Limp Bizkit or Blink-182(ugh)commercialism) this really shows very little sign of selling-out (none). The music is not quiite as heavy as I was thinking, but I must of been thinking elsewhere when that came into my mind. However, it takes a little time to get into it. When I first got it, I only liked the first six tracks because the others were too slow. But you need to listen to the whole thing through so that when you're done, you'll be nearly out of breath. <br />If you want consistantly fast, I don't think that this is the perfect place to look. You'd best be looking at Slayer or Grip Inc. However, \\"Rise\\" is blindingly fast. Not all the way through (It would be a little hard for Phil to do the verses while keeping the beat), but if you compare it to Metallica's \\"Sad But True\\" in speed, you can see where I'm going. But also, HEAVY! All of that good stuff is found on all of the tracks. However, there is a ballad as you should know by now. The 6 minute-plus \\"This Love\\", with it's melodic semi-acoustic-guitars and softer (yet raw-throated) vocals, it deals with the extreme pain of broken relationships. Now hold on; I know some of you are thinking that this is another one of those Papa Roach \\"She luvs me not\\" type songs. NO!! KEEP THAT THOUGHT OUT! This song takes it a step further. Instead of feeling sad and pityful about it, Phil emphasizes violent and self hatred very well. It's pretty disturbing, and it can somehow get under your skin in ways too complicated to explain. You'll probably love it, considering it takes a much needed detour from all the screaming and scratchy vocals (that isn't a bad thing at all, don't get me wrong). Aside from that, almost every track is an assault on the sences. \\"A New Level\\" is amazing! Grinding guitars and a perfectly constructed (not to mention creative) solo that stands out make it up and really kikas! \\"Walk\\" (although very repetitive musically) is tiringly catchy. The main-riff packs it's belongings and moves into your head to live for about a year until it decides to leave you alone relizing how you can't concentrate on anything at all (It's not a bad thing at all). \\"No Good/Attack The Radical\\" is an unsettling song that can make you want to attack someone or something. Proceed with caution! \\"By Demons Be Driven\\" is one where Phil screams very loud. Be Careful Bizkit fans (it can hurt your ears). All the other songs you need to listen carefully to. You'll love em all. Any weakpoints? Yes as a matter-of-fact. \\"F. Hostile\\" is kinda sloppy, the bass can't be heard very well and it just doesn't do too much for me. Oh well. It'll grow on me eventually...<br />Don't read anymore!!Just grab this classic album as fast as you can! If you love this, I would also recommend Metallica's \\"Master Of The Puppets\\", Slayer's \\"Seasons Of The Abyss\\", Sepultura's \\"Chaos A.D.\\" and Megadeth's \\"Rust In Piece\\". HEY! ARE YOU STILL HERE? Go out and grab this! peace...
0684847248|5.0|...The first 87 pages of this book are phenomenal. It describes a truthful, honest and healthy way to apprach the problems of life and correctly defines discipline, courage and the difference between true joy and discounts the common societal ideal that feel-good happiness is the ultimate goal in life.   <BR>As for the rest of book it starts to go a little down hill after the section on love.  The section on love is very good from a purely secular or humanistic point of view. In it he states that true love is disciplined and is not the same thing as romanticism as so many pepople believe.  This sectioned will hopefully open the eyes of many who are unhappy with their marriage because the \\"romance is gone\\".  <BR>   However, his theory of Grace and his idea of God are quite ungracefull and unfortunately they lower the credibility of the book for many readers (not just Christian readers) because it is so sparce and it just doesn't do a good job of explaining much. Likewise his idea that evil is some kind of human entropy is interesting but it will be discounted by many becasue it may be structured upon an unsound idea of what entropy really is.<BR>But I highly, highly suggest the first 87 pages to all people
B00004STPT|5.0|I'm actually listening to the Gladiator soundtrack as I write this review. From beginning to end, this work satisfies completely. You don't need to watch the movie to be able to enjoy the soundtrack, and that speaks volumes to the talent of Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, who have managed to create a work that not only compliments the scenes of the Oscar winning movie, but stands on its own legs. (It's actually one of the very few times in recent history that I happened to agree with the philistines at the Academy) <br />The two longest cues at roughly 10 and 10 1/2 minutes, #3 &quot;The Battle&quot; and #13 &quot;Barbarian Horde&quot; are chest thumping triumphs that are monumentally powerful. They combine a mix of strings and horns that reminds me of &quot;Mars, bringer of War&quot; from Holst's &quot;The Planets&quot;, but, mixed with the subtle background of the synthesizer, creates an entirely different effect that is just amazing. 8 1/2 minutes into &quot;The Battle&quot;, Hans segues into the melodic strings accompanied by Lisa's beautiful voice, which sets up for #4 &quot;Earth&quot; and #5 &quot;Sorrow&quot; which are probably my favorite cues on the whole soundtrack. Combined, they're only a mere 4 1/2 minutes long, yet they manage to (softly) speak more to me than many pieces have done in an entire hour. So beautifully set within the goings on of the movie, they set the mood perfectly when Maximus arrives home.<br />The next cue, #6 &quot;To Zucchabar&quot; is ethereal and strange, and speaks of distant and foreign lands. Other pieces, notably #9 &quot;The might of Rome, and 10 &quot;Strength and honor&quot; are incredible. There's not a wasted note in this soundtrack. The last three compositions, #15 &quot;Elysium&quot;, #16 &quot;Honor him&quot;, and #17 &quot;Now we are free&quot; all work together to complete the exhausting emotional rollercoaster ride that is &quot;Gladiator&quot;. Obviously, I cannot say enough about this piece of work. I loved it asmuch as I loved the movie. Both are among my favorites of all time.
0790729628|5.0|To put in perspective some negative reviews about this picture,one has to remember how sci-fi movies were made and ambiented, their colours and the stories canned in them, before this one. Only then one can truly understand the importance and historical impact of this masterpiece by Ridley Scott. This is a movie to be seen by all, including those not really into sci-fi. No serious pictures about the future of mankind made after this one, can escape the influence of the dark city portraited in Blade Runner. Not only some very original effects for the time, but also the mood that Vangelis provokes through his musical score, set the rigth place and time to unfold a moving tale about human and nonhuman misery and redemption. This is a place and time were humans kill replicants that were created by them to serve, but not to live on earth or live in full. Replicants that are not supposed to feel, love or despair. But they do, and how.<br />I can hardly think of a more stirring and moving scene in a picture, than the one in which the last standing \\"bad\\" replicant (portraited by Hauer)does not do what humans thinks a replicant would do (kill Harrison, the hunter that has just liquidated his beloved one) but instead teaches us all a lesson about the value of life and compassion. If the final speech<br />that he makes doesn't represent poetry in motion to you, then maybe you didn't deserve to see this wonderful art act.

B000002LCD|3.0|The album has some great madonna originals, and a few late 80's band pop tunes to add to the mix.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I'll admit it now. I'm a huge Tolkien fan. He was a Master of fantasy writing who brought the genre into the mainstream, and I'll appreciate that forever. Peter Jackson was the perfect choice for recreating the story on the big screen and now that it's all said and done, I must say that Howard Shore was the perfect choice for composing the music.<br />I had honestly never heard of Howard Shore before I bought the soundtrack, which was a couple of weeks before the movie even came out. I looked at it and thought to myself, who is this guy? It's amazing that nothing he had ever done before had made me take notice. I think, however, the reason is, that nothing he had done before had been used in this way, to not only provide an emotional backdrop, but to propel the story by telling a musical tale all its own. Take \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" - just shy of 3 minutes long, but the compassion and love that went into composing the piece is tantamount to the compassion and love that Tolkien used to write LOTR. That 3 minute cue helped to define The Shire better than any amount of dialoge could have. Every single piece of music written for the movie worked this way; it defined not only the background, but sang of the emotions, fears, and strength of the characters within the story. Howard's vision of the \\"sounds\\" of Middle Earth is a definitive benchmark that will come to be used as the standard to rate movie scores, much the same way that Basil Poledouris did with the \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" soundtrack some 20 years ago. In other words, it's a shining success.<br />This soundtrack does not just support the movie. It is truly a magnificient work of art that stands on its own merits. You don't need to watch the movie to enjoy the music. I listen to the soundtrack all the time. In fact, I've got an MP3 CD player in my truck that usually has a CD with about 10 hours of what I consider to be the best that modern classical has to offer, and Howard Shore's LOTR score is right there among titles such as Braveheart, Gladiator, and Conan. I truly can't give enough praise to the man for this incredibly inspiring music. Even without the addition of Enya's two fantastic contributions, it would have been a masterpiece.
B000000WA4|5.0|Let's be perfectly clear about this for the last time-<br />THE SMASHING PUMPKINS ARE NOT GRUNGE!!!<br />People expecting such may be disapointed as a result.<br />Let's take a trip back in time. 1995. Soundgarden were still together, Alec John Such was still in Bon Jovi and The Smashing Pumkins recorded Melon Collie and The Infinate Sadness. It was a good year.<BR>This album was created on a crazy concept - to create a two CD album, which had an artsy idea to the way the tracks were set out and PULLED AWAY from the stylings of their previous material. And to top it all off, they used a new producer. This was doomed to be something new.<BR>One note on listening to this album - don't expect to take it all in the first time you listen to it. It's not only two hours long, it also changes musical ideas every other heartbeat. It's alot to take in all at once, but after listening to it a few times you start to see the true genuis that lies beneith the amazing music.<BR>The first disc (Dawn to Dusk) is admittedly better than the second (Twilight to Starlight), as every single track on the album is amazing, and the quality drops not even once. A particular highlight is Porcelina of the Vast Oceans, an amazing track that goes from a melodic balad to a heavier, upbeat alt-rock monster and back again repeatedly without warning. Also, one might wonder why singles were never made of JellyBelly, Muzzle and To Forgive, which have amazingly catchy choruses, brilliant melodies and sit beautifully with established favorites like Zero, Tonight Tonight and Bullit With Butterfly Wings.<BR>Twilight to Starlight doesn't quite live up to the brilliance of it's counterpart, but is still an amazing CD none the less. Much heavier and down beat, it is balanced beautifully with the oh-so-tender Stumbleine and closer Farewell and Goodnight. Round of aplause to XYU, which is my particular favorite on the album and just goes to show that the hurt whinings of bands like Stain'd and Puddle Of Mudd can't even come close to the raw passion that Billy Corgan can exude.<BR>The pure genius comes when you look at the albums comparitively. Both albums are set out to musically represent the cycle of a day (hence the disc names), with the first looking at life from a happier perspective, and the second looking from a more negative one. Ultimately, it's strength lies in it's amazing diversity that no other band before or since has tried to display.<BR>An album you can't possibly live without, it's a real masterpiece.
B000002JR8|5.0|After tasting commercial success with \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\", Pantera went above the grain and crafted one of the most brutal and frenzied albums to ever hit the Billboard Charts.  The first four tracks; \\"Strength Beyond Strength\\", \\"Becoming\\", \\"5 Minutes Alone\\", and \\"I'm Broken\\" are among Pantera's best and remain concert staples, all of which showcase Vinnie Paul's frantic thrash metal drumming that showcased him as one of the top drummers in metal history, and the rhythm section of Dimebag Darrel's blazing yet brutal guitar solos and Rex Brown's fleet fingered bass blasts combined with Phil Anselmo's raw, deep throated voice make \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" unforgettable from the beginning.  \\"Good Friends and A Bottle of Pills\\" is a three minute dirge of Phil revealing a dirty little deed to someone he knows, and it is darkly humerous until the ear shattering chorus hits: \\"I'm serving too many masters\\".  \\"25 Years\\" is delibrately slow paced until the second half of the song hits with a chorus you can't help but sing along and headbang to.  \\"Slaughtered\\" showcases Pantera getting even more heavier, while \\"Use My Third Arm\\" and a tripped out cover of Black Sabbath's \\"Planet Caravan\\" nicely round out the album.  All in all, I find \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" to be Pantera's best album to date; better than \\"Vulgar\\", better than \\"Cowboys\\".  This is a modern day classic and one of the definitive albums of the 90's, and I doubt anything Pantera puts out now or later can ever match the ferocity and brutality that is displayed here.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Weather you are a big fan of the 80's music genre or not, there is a new band that has a hybrid of music containing the best aspects of the 80's and makes them better with today's music.<BR>Not to say that it's all 80's music, but 30 Seconds to Mars' self-titled debut album delivers a new and interesting style of music play as well as broad lyrics that has words bouncing off the walls.<BR>The album, mainly constructed by Jared Leto (Fight Club, Panic Room), brings back some of that 80's sound in order to give it a futuristic tone throughout every song.<BR>Jared, who onstage sings and plays guitar for the techno-organic/space metal band, programmed, sang, played bass and guitar as well as the synthesizers, on almost every track of the record.<BR>Jared's older brother Shannon Leto also plays in 30 Seconds to Mars. Shannon covered the drums on the band's album and continues to do so on stage.<BR>The other two band members that share the stage are Solon Bixler on guitar and Matt Wachter on bass.<BR>The free flying, entanglement of drums, guitar, bass, vocals, and synthesizers each song produces connects closely to a sound that would match up with Linkin Park's style of music. The futuristic, space sounds may cause some people to think of the band Orgy with a variation.<BR>30 Seconds to Mars has been receiving rave reviews from their album as well as their live performance shows. Recently, they toured on the first stretch of Incubus' Morning View Tour, which lasted from Aug. 31 to Sept. 27.<BR>30 Seconds to Mars will continue to tour on a Canadian trek of the MTV Campus Invasion Tour, stopping at 11 cities across Canada. It will start on Oct. 4 in Vancouver and proceed until their last show in London, Ontario on Oct. 21. The tour will come to Calgary on Oct. 6, with a stop the next day in Edmonton.<BR>The first single off the album, Capricorn, starts off with a ten second intro of a low-pitched noise going higher and then slams into a wall of raunchy guitar playing intertwined with fast paced beats. Much like a rocket counting down from ten and then lifting off into outer space.<BR>Coincidentally, the lyrics kick in 30 seconds into the song, followed by a break 2 minutes and 57 seconds into the song that lasts three seconds and then continues at the three-minute mark.<BR>It's small connecting details like this that shows how much in-depth planning has gone into the theme of the album, the bands name, and the lyrics as well as the name of the songs.<BR>The lyrics show this as well with songs such as Buddha For Mary (\\"This is the life on mars, Mary was a different girl, Had a thing for astronauts\\") and Fallen (\\"Yeah, I've been to Jupiter, And I've fallen through the air, I used to live out on the moon, But now I'm back here down on earth\\").<BR>Other songs on the album such as Edge of the Earth contain the ever-so-classic electric drums, which produces an acceptable sound worthy for this type of music.<BR>Echelon, which starts and ends with these rhythmic drum beats, ends with new-age, twisted-beats, a synthesizer, and liquid guitars.<BR>If anything, solid rock ballads such as Welcome to the Universe, Oblivion, and The Mission should get your blood pumping and send your musical soul into orbit.
B00005IC2H|1.0|Please please please save me from this type of ....  this has to be the most overrated album of the last 10 years.  you will need a lot of mood altering drugs to get through the album and even then it won't be worth it.  i truly believe that people rave about this because they think it makes them look cool-when it just makes them look vapid.  i'm sorry to come crashing down on the sigur ros parade but save your money-this is one of the few albums that i actually got mad that i spent money on.
B00004RF9G|1.0|This movie is borderline unwatchable.  I know nothing of the play it was based on so my opinion isn't because the play was so much better.  This movie just hurts to watch.<br />Cyd Charisse's Scottish accent is laughable.  It keeps disappearing and reappearing when she speaks.  If fact, the only words out of her mouth that consistently sounded Scottish were \\"aye\\" and \\"verra.\\"  Even then it sounded fake.<br />The background is obviously a painted set.  I know that they did the best with what they had, but they should have had more because it looks terrible.<br />The story wasn't interesting.  The characters fell in love with each other at first sight so there wasn't any great \\"getting to know you\\" scenes.<br />Here's the falling in love scene:<br />\\"Good day.\\" her<br />\\"Good day.\\" him<br />\\"Good day.\\" her<br />\\"Good day.\\" him<br />Wow, don't hurt me with all the witty dialogue.<br />The only tolerable character was played by Van Johnson.  He had some funny lines but they were too few and far between to make a difference.<br />The dance sequences were very nice but I've seen better.  If you are a fan of Gene Kelly I recommend watching \\"On The Town\\", \\"Anchors Aweigh\\", or \\"Singin' In The Rain\\".  Actually, I would recommend sticking your head in the gas oven before I would recommend this movie to you.<br />Sorry, but I can see why this movie bombed at the box office when it premiered.
1568951833|2.0|I have enjoyed many of Ken Follett's books.  Sadly, I did not enjoy this one.  It seemed as if it was written for a grade school student.  To make matters worse, the characters did not react in realistic ways.  <BR>All too often, the dialog goes something like this:<BR>Luke: &quot;Hi, are you my wife?  I am glad to have found you.  I have amnesia, and I can't remember anything.  Sorry I have been gone for so long.&quot;<BR>Wife: &quot;That's okay.  I understand.  What can I do for you?&quot;<BR>While this may not be an exact quote, it is pretty close to what is in the book.  <BR>Because of the ludicrous dialog, I just couldn't get into the book.  The good thing is that it is a quick read.
B00005A3KS|5.0|While this film might be seen as a Lethal Weapon-type action/drama, it proves far more provoking and rewarding.  This epic drama (no joke!) very successfully analyzes Keanu's being drawn from a life of rigid authority through the massive gray expanse that is Swayze's surfing, sky-diving, and bank-robbing world.

Talk about having a bad month or year, this character has the worst year you could imagine and I couldn't help but wince and feel for her and most times laugh at the way she bumbles her way through her mistakes.<br />Becky Bloomwood is someone we could all identify with.  A realife personality with real problems.  Her main problem?  Shopping.  And way too much of it to be exact.  I love to shop, but wow, this character goes way beyond what I wouldn't even dream of doing.<br />When she admits to having this major impulse to buy, buy and buy more you smirk at the way she rationalizes it, but at times you feel like shaking her and saying, you just can't afford this Becky!<br />Becky is being chased by letters from VISA, angry ones and she is being harassed by her bank and stalked by her creditors.  What can she do?  Buy something.  That's it.  She just needs a little something to make herself feel better until she can get this under control.<br />But in the aftermath she realizes that she is in even deeper trouble than before.  With a job as a Financial Journalist, she doesn't make nearly enough to pay these bills off.  The bitter irony is, she writes articles on how other people can SAVE money....<br />Becky tries cutting back, spending less, doing odd jobs to make more, but nothing seems to work.  She is in deep.<br />The writer weaves a tale that is so engrossing and real, that I winced when she recieved her bills and I felt ashamed with her when she made excuses and tried to lie to the banks.  I was tense at times when she embarassed herself or got caught in a lie or fabrication.<br />Becky knows she spends too much, but can't stop until something changes her life for good and she must grow up and take responsibility.  We see her hurtle towards impending disaster, fall to the bottom of the barrel and pick herself up again and become a new person.<br />Very entertaining and way too much fun to miss.  This one is a keeper!<br />Tracy Talley~@is a keeper!<br />Tracy Talley~@
B000069AUI|5.0|Everyone has been talking about this band and I felt I had to give them a listen. Listening to Coldplay the first time struck me as similar to the Aussie rock phenoms, Powderfinger. Very original and beautiful melodies and lyrics - although not quite as 'heavy' as Powderfinger. Really quite unique, however. Some spectacular melodic tracks like Clocks - a lovely metronomic sound to it - believe it or not - a little like Elton John! Well worth listening to and highly recommended. Right up there as album of the year!
B00003CX5P|1.0|I found this movie to in no way live up to the classic star wars trilogy...and I am not even a huge star wars fan. I thought the acting was bland and forced, the plot unmoving, and frankly, I kept looking at my watch wondering when this movie would end. There are positives...some of the special effects are great, and in a few instances, both Liam and Ewan seem to make sense of the boring/contrived drudge that was given to them as dialogue. An utter disappointment.
0385474547|5.0|I read this book during my high school senior year for a world literature class and was caught up in the story right away. Perhaps since I have a different perspective then the average Western person, reading about another culture with a different perspective was very interesting to me. Then there is the emotional attachment that you gain to the characters. I mean, wow! It is very easy to understand how all the characters feel. Great book, everyone should read it.
B00003CXI1|4.0|As a fan of the book, I will admit that many story elements were left out, and the changes made to condense the plot really irked me upon my first viewing of the film. Also, many of the special effects look very cartoony. That said, I just rewatched this film, and when you don't compare it to the book (which is obviously going to be better) the movie does hold its own and is very entertaining. The actors are all wonderful (the film is very well cast), the sets and scenes are very true to Rowling's fictitious world, and the movie captures the essence of what made the books so popular in the first place. In fact, my only complaint with the second viewing (and the reason the movie only gets 4 stars from me) is the lackluster special effects in 2 specific scenes. Other than that, I would almost be willing to say that I loved this movie.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Very entertaining.  Can't wait for Book #5 and Movie #2 to come out!
0156012197|5.0|My mother read this book to me as a child and I enjoyed it every time.  Then I read it in my teen years and again as an adult--I love it every time.  I come away with something different each time I read it, I always learn something new. It is an interesting and beautiful story about life disguised as a simple children's book. I think that anyone can enjoy this book, as well as it's illustrations, at any age.
B00003CXAE|1.0|GREASE is one of my favorite movies, so I give the movie 5 stars but the DVD just one.  Paramount is so cheap.  There is absolutely nothing \\"special\\" about this special edition.  The interviews are at least 10-15 years old and the theatrical trailer looks like it was sitting in a hog trough for a few years.  The film itself is filthy in several sequences and Paramount did not even animate the menus in anyway or even put any music on the menu screens.  I mean for goodness sake...THIS IS A MUSICAL!!  I mean how do small, teeny-tiny, itsy-bitsy, miniscule studios (Synapse, Blue Underground, Anchor Bay)put out DVDs of obscure titles like: FADE TO BLACK, WATCHER IN THE WOODS, VAMPYROS LESBOS, THE PROWLER, DEADBEAT AT DAWN... etc...<br />And at least have commentaries or animated menus!  Even WILLY WONKA, which is hardly going to sell as many copies as GREASE has beautifully animated menus with music.  I would love to know why this DVD of GREASE (which will eventually probably sell hundreds of thousands of copies on DVD for PARAMOUNT, or more)does not even have MUSIC on the menus.  This is HANDS down the laziest release of a mainstream film from a major studio ever.  It really is pathetic considering how they are marketing it like it's gold.  PARAMOUNT is the worst studio putting out DVD.  They are the most overpriced for the least content.  I've always heard from people that PARAMOUNT was cheap...but this really proves it.<br />Remember Malcolm McDowell on the talk show years ago promoting STAR TREK and TANK GIRL?  When asked about what films he was in that were coming out he replied, \\"I'm in a new film called TANK GIRL, and another film that is not TANK GIRL.\\"  He refused to promote the film STAR TREK for PARAMOUNT because PARAMOUNT had screwed him in some way with money.  We're all behind you Malcolm, give PARAMOUNT what you gave that woman in CLOCKWORK ORANGE.<br />Buy this DVD if you absolutely can't wait for the even more SPECIAL EDITION of GREASE slated for 2004.  This practice of releasing 90 different versions of the same movie is called \\"studio double dipping.\\"practice of releasing 90 different versions of the same movie is called \\"studio double dipping.\\"
0446608955|5.0|This was the best book that i have ever read.  I read the book far before the movie came out and i really didnt think that Mandy Moore would do a good job. She did better than I thought she was going to but the story line is so great its hard to concentrate on anything but that. I love all of Nicholas Spark's stuff.......READ IT ALL!!!!!
B00005QDW5|5.0|I gave this collection 5 stars because it obviously contains some incredible music.  Theres one thing that needs to be understood though.  Pink Floyd has never been a band that is about songs, or hits, or anything like that.  Floyd is THE definitive album band.  Each one of the songs on this collection loses much of its effect when taken out of the context of the album that it was originally featured on, with the exception of some of the Barrett tunes.  This collection is NOT good as an introduction to the band.  Newcomers should begin with Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here.  Otherwise, you are missing the point of what Pink Floyd has always stood for and tried to accomplish.  What this collection IS good for is Hardcore Fans of the band, and here is why:<BR>1. \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" - Undoubtedly the holy-grail of Floyd songs (at least to us Floyd-heads).  This incredible song is featured in The Wall (the film), but this is the first time it has been released on disc.  Worth the price of the disc alone for the hardcore fan.<BR>2. The remixes of the longer songs - A good chunk of \\"Echoes\\"has been cut out, mostly from the creepy wind blowing middle section.  Good to listen to if you don't have 22 minutes to kill, but need your fix.  Also, the two bookend parts of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" have been pasted together (much like on \\"A Collection of Great Dance Songs\\").  Its dissapointing that they cut out so much for time, but the main themes of the song are still intact, making for a pretty good abbreviated version.<br />Now on to the complaints:  <BR>1.) I don't know why they even bothered putting the shortened version of \\"Marooned\\" on this compilation.  It is one of David Gilmour's finest moments as a guitarist and they omit almost 3/4 of the song.  So what was the point?  <BR>2.) Of the 5 tracks they could have taken from Animals, why do they always feel the need to choose \\"Sheep\\" (as they did on the \\"Dance Song\\" collection).  \\"Dogs\\" or \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" are both better songs and better examples of Animals as an album.  <BR>3.) I don't think it was really neccesary to include 3 songs each from \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" and \\"The Division Bell\\" and not include anything from \\"More\\", \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" or \\"Obscured By Clouds\\".  <BR>4.) Why not include \\"What Shall We Do Now\\" from The Wall film, especially if they dug up \\"Tigers\\"?  <BR>5.) How can you omit \\"Brain Damage\\" and \\"Eclipse\\" from a Pink Floyd collection?  Can anyone argue with the fact that it really was the only correct way to close out disc 2?<BR>To summarize, if you are new to Pink Floyd, skip this for now and get Dark Side or WYWH.  For the hardcore fans, this isn't perfect, but its good enough to be worth the cash.

B000002HPV|5.0|This CD is just great, 5 stars are not enough.<br />I first got introduced to Bjork watching her unplugged show broadcasted on MTV Europe...She was so experimental and not affraid to try new arrangements for her songs.<br />Homogenic is like that with wonderful string arrangements, experimental electronics...From Hunter to All is full of love, it's like visiting Bjork's world (and not just Iceland) through her eyes.<BR>My favorite part is at the end of Joga when you can hear/feel Bjork's smile when she sings...Close your eyes and you will find yourself close to her. Amazing.
B0000640VO|5.0|A refreshing change from the usual Hollywood fare. One person CAN make a difference.
B00004RF9B|5.0|If you have never seen this movie, you are in for a big surprise. Even by todays standards it is a masterpiece of technology.<br />I have seen it at least a hundred times and now on DVD its even better.<br />Its definately a must see.
B0000542D2|2.0|If you're just a casual fan, this is a must-have.  But if you're a Beatle nut, beware!<br />The print used here looks great as far as the blacks and whites are concerned.  But the \\"widescreen\\" presentation was achieved achieved apparently by chopping the top & bottom.  Strange.<br />What is really awful is the sound. The horrendous \\"fake\\" surround sound applied to the music causes odd phasing that makes the performances virtually unwatchable after the initial joy of just having AHDN on DVD subsides.  Now, the Beatles were not movie stars, they were musicians. Most of us  will buy the DVD more for the music and the associated performances than anything else. The echo applied to the soundtrack is unforgiveable and makes a mockery of the music. Even my 3 1/2 year old son -- who admittedly comes from a musical household -- asked why the songs sounded so \\"funny!\\"<br />I spoke with Martin Lewis during a recent screening of the film and he said \\"blame Apple\\" and that the effects \\"were not how (he) wanted to do it,\\" but frankly that's not good enough. Prior to the screening, in his lengthy introduction, Martin stated that Miramax had let him take his time to \\"do this right; for the fans\\" instead of rushing the reissue into the marketplace.<br />So, which is it Martin?<br />With the stellar AMC mono mix and the decent MPI stereo mixes out there as a starting point it simply seems convenient to blame Apple. More importantly, whatever soundtrack was supplied as the original source, it is just plain idiocy to ONLY include a soundtrack that sounds at least as bad as the old Capital \\"reprocessed stereo\\" records from the 60s. Along with widescreen AND fullscreen versions of the print, a choice of soundtracks should have been included. To not do this makes this project, quite frankly, and no matter how many \\"recollections\\" and other extras (that we'll probably only watch once at most, if that), a truly pointless endeavour.<br />It's about the music, man! <br />I'm waiting for a reissue of this DVD that Apple takes part in, or maybe I'll just be looking for a bootleg version that combines the AMC soundtrack with Martin's print in bootleg form.<br />But buy this anyway, just to see The Beatles before they became the myth. ...
B00005JKJA|5.0|Don't listen to anyone who tells you that this movie is impossible to understand. That's not true. Difficult, yes...especially on first viewing, but there is method to David Lynch's madness and there is an explanation to be found for those willing to look.     Mulholland Drive is a brilliantly structured film even though the structure is unconventional. Basically the first two hours play out as the dream of a very troubled young woman by the name of Diane Selwyn. In the final 30 minutes we are taken into Diane's reality. Mullholland Drive is a very disturbing portrait of the inner world of a woman about to commit suicide and we learn about her life and what led her to murder and suicide through the dream imagery of the first two hours.    What confuses many people the first time they see Mulholland Drive is that David Lynch doesn't use the normal cinematic techniques to tip his audience off that they are watching a dream segment. In fact, the dream plays out in fairly conventional linear fashion while it is the reality portion of the film that plays out in non-linear form, jumping back and forth in time and introducing psychotic hallucinations as well. This further blurs the line between reality and fantasy in this film.     Contrary to popular belief Mulholland Drive is actually very intricately plotted, although the narrative is not readily apparent on the first viewing. The dream portion is a mirror image of reality and it displays a reversed reflection of Diane's real world. A few examples: In the dream Rita exits the limousine and walks downhill; in reality Diane exits the limousine and walks uphill. In the dream Aunt Ruth is alive; in reality Aunt Ruth is dead. In the dream Adam Kesher's world is spinning out of control and he is losing everything; in reality Adam Kesher's world is very much in control and he has everything. In the dream the hitman is incompetent; in reality he turns out to be all too competent. In the dream Camilla is alive and Diane is dead;in reality Diane is alive and Camilla is dead.    Betty is, of course, the idealized dream version of Diane. She's a prettier, more wholesome, and more talented version of Diane. However, Diane is not Betty in her dream as most people automatically assume...she's Rita.    Mulholland Drive is a challenging and haunting film that I believe will only rise in stature as the years go by. David Lynch spoonfeeds nothing to his audience but challenges them to explore the nightmarish inner world of Diane Selwyn for themselves and reach their own interpretations and conclusions. There are great rewards for those willing to do so.    Nov. 1, 2007 Edit:     I just watched Mulholland Drive again after a few years and I was kind of surprised to see this old review of mine written years ago at the top here.  I do think my understanding and appreciation of the film has deepened over the years and, although I still believe most of what I originally wrote is correct, I'd probably modify it a bit, especially the part about Diane being Rita in her dream.  I now believe that Betty and Rita both represented different parts of Diane:  Betty was her idealized, innocent side while Rita was the darker, more seductive side that she believed would help advance her career in Hollywood.  One of the saddest parts of the movie, in my opinion, is my belief that the very likeable and attractive Betty was the person that Diane could have been if not for her tragic childhood and the series of destructive choices she made in her life.    For those who've read and commented on my original review and are interested, here's a somewhat revised version that represents my current interpretation of the film.      Mulholland Drive is a rather chilling look into the psyche of a deeply disturbed and suicidal woman named Diane Selwyn who is guilt stricken over her involvement in the murder of her estranged lover.  The entire movie takes place in her apartment over the course of a few hours on the day she commitssuicide.    The first two hours is a dream Diane has during a heavy, drug-induced sleep that attempts to rewrite a happier, idealized version of herself and her life from the time she arrives in Hollywood, but gradually grows darker over time and eventually collapses back into her reality.  The final part of the movie is her reality which is told through a series of flashbacks, memories, and psychotic hallucinations.  First-time viewers often don't realize they're watching a dream since Lynch doesn't use the usual cinematic techniques (other than a brief first-person descent into a pillow at the beginning) to signal a dream sequence and this part of the film is told in fairly conventional linear sequence, while it's the reality part of the film that jumps around in non-linear fashion.    The dream portion is kind of a dark, twisted version of Dorothy's dream from the Wizard of Oz where she casts people she knows from her real life into various roles in her dream.  But since her subconscious is the producer, writer, and director of the dream these people are just actors on her stage and everything is really about Diane and her life even if she doesn't appear to be represented in a scene.  For example, there's no reason to believe that a wealthy film director like Adam Kesher would check into a fleabag hotel like the Park Hotel when he thought he still had access to all his money nor would he know the hotel manager by name.  Diane, however, who had lived on the fringes of the Hollywood dream, might well be familiar with this kind of seedy hotel and its manager.      Once you realize that everything you're seeing in the first two hours springs from Diane's subconscious mind it's possible to take the clues and symbolism that Lynch plants in the dream and construct a remarkably deep and complex examination of Diane's life which also peels back the layers on a psyche that's been irreparably damaged by sexual molestation by her grandfather, prostitution, and a destructiverelationship with an actress named Camilla Rhodes which ultimately leads to murder and suicide.    Mulholland Drive is not only David Lynch's masterpiece, it's one of the most chilling movies I've ever seen.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie is absolutely incredible.  Dont't let the Disney logo scare you away from this movie masterpiece.  I feel that the G rating for this movie stands for Great.  The technicalness put into making a movie with such great graphics is huge.  The people who drew this should get a hearty pat on the back.  The animation is great.<BR>There are also several good special features including the two animated short films.  This movie is incredible so support the people who made it and buy yourself a copy.

B000002H33|5.0|With thrashing guitars and the occasional melodic bass line, \\"Master of Puppets\\" turned me on to heavy metal, this was one of the first metal albums that I bought (I got ...And Justice for All in the mail by accident), and is still my all time favorite.  If you want to hear the real Metallica this is it, all their albums since this one are still struggling to catch-up.  While \\"The Black Album\\" sold over 10 million albums, this is the one that defined Metallica as a band, musically, structurally, and lyrically.  Cliff Burton's bass line from \\"Orion\\" is what most bass guitarists strive to measure up to (no one has quite got it yet).  Don't get me wrong, I'm a Metallica fan, but the [stuff] they've been releasing lately (like the radio friendly \\"Until It Sleeps\\" from that heavy \\"Load\\" of SH#%), have only served to disappoint the music industry and their more hardcore fans.  The world needs more albums like \\"Master of Puppets\\", if you don't own this landmark metal album, pick it up, you won't be disappointed.

B00006690G|4.0|From his first album with \\"my name is\\" eminem has been my #1, but this album is not even close to his others. It almost seems like he has lost his \\"edge\\". Eminem seems more devoted to his daughter and less about the topics that used to be entertaining with his older albums. Sure \\"Without Me\\" is comparable to \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" but the rest of the album, NO. There are about 3 songs I actully like on this album, unlike with his other albums I liked about 90% of the songs. I am just dissapointed and I see a dead end in eminem's future (maybe in a couple of years, after his new movie).
B00006F2TV|5.0|This movie totally rocks!!  I have waited 30 years for this movie to come out. Can't wait until the sequel!!
B00006IU73|5.0|As the proud owner of all the previous PT CDs under thier old label, this is the best PT to date and an excellent first CD under thier new label.<br />From \\"Blackest Eyes\\" to \\"Strip The Soul\\", it is clear that Steve Wilson and Company have refined thier distinctly original sound that made its appearance on \\"Signify\\", \\"Stupid Dream\\" and the last CD \\"Lightbulb Sun\\". No longer can they be viewed as a band that sounds a lot like early Pink Floyd or King Crimson. \\"In Absentia\\" is the best CD I have purchased in the past year without question (over bands like Spock's Beard, Transatlantic, Yes, Liquid Tension Experiment, Steve Morse). I just can't get enough of this CD.<br />Clearly the best prog CD of the year hands down and maybe once of the best CDs of the past few years. \\"In Absentia\\" has put PT on the map! If this is a taste of PT's future voyages- then it is very sweet indeed. Recommended without hesitation!
B00005RRG9|5.0|&quot;The Parent Trap&quot; is one of the first movies I remember LOVING when I hit pre-teenagerhood.  It's comedy, adventure, and romance rolled all together.  Hayley Mills (as twins) is lively and enchanting, and the rest of the cast is superb as well.  &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; is about two girls who go to the same summer camp one year and are freaked out to realize they look exactly alike.  It isn't long before the truth of their relationship is revealed, and the girls decide to play cupid for their parents.  The &quot;Parent Trap&quot; DVD has many goodies, including an interview with the woman who played Mills' twin double and who you can see throughout the film, but who was never credited.  And ever wondered how they got Hayley Mills to really look like two different people?  That's covered too.  You'll get an earful of &quot;Let's Get Together&quot; and a lot more.  A great DVD for any fan of &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; or its actors.
B00006AG5N|5.0|The sound is crisp and clear.It's the greatest music ever produced.A great introduction to Elvis.The diehard fan will enjoy the sound coming directly from the master tapes.Buy it,you won't regret it.
B000002UZ4|4.0|If you were an MTV viewer in the 80s or listened to a lot of pop radio, then you are familiar with quite a few of these songs.  \\"West End Girls,\\" \\"Opportunities,\\" \\"Suburbia,\\" \\"It's a Sin,\\" \\"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\\" and \\"Always on My Mind\\" will probably be easily recognizable to you.<br />The other songs may not ring a bell as quickly to American audiences, but they are still good, danceable songs.  There is a lot of synthesizer just as in the other songs.<br />The part of this collection I like best is the liner notes.  Whenever I see a greatest hits collection, I wonder why.  If I am a fan, then I already have the songs.  For me to buy a greatest hits, I want to get something additional.  Here, each song lists the producer and songwriters (a veritable staple), but also mentioned are the release date, the UK chart position, and some comments from the Pet Shop Boys.  This made the collection more interesting.<br />I would recommend this for the fan of late 80s pop music.
B000069CWE|5.0|I really like Hybrid Theory and thought this album sounded like a ripoff.  I was planning to wait until they had a completely new album.  I don't recall what changed my mind but they have done enough here that it feels like a whole new album.  Highly recommend to fans of linkin park.
B000002H6C|4.0|It sounds odd, but one of the things I like best about Metallica is that you get your money's worth.  Out of the nine songs, the shortest one is five minutes and twelve seconds of metal; two of the songs are over nine and a half minutes.<br />This is the first album with Jason Newsted on bass.  Although I miss Burton (who wrote the lyrics for \\"To Live is To Die\\"), Newsted does a great job.<br />This album is from the earlier years where they still have the dark themes of alienation, but they also have a lot of fast riffs going throughout.  \\"Blackened,\\" the first song on the album, will knock you backward with its power.  While you are then in the reclined position, enjoy the fury.<br />I would recommend this CD if you are ready for the frenzy.
B00003CXAE|3.0|Other reviewers have noted that this DVD edition offers nothing different from the VHS version released only a couple of years ago. Note also that this edition does not come from the original film elements. Aside from the dirtiness of the print, the lack of extra scenes and the like, notice that most of the Coca-Cola ads have been \\"fuzzed\\" out. The image boost of the DVD image makes this alteration particularly clear. It's bad enough that Paramount was willing to alter the film in order to appease a corporate partner during an earlier release of the videotape; it's terrible that we are still saddled with the so-so, handmedown digital remastering of a corrupted print. Director Randal Kleiser has revealed in a September 2002 interview with ... that Paramount plans a reissue in 2004, a version with more extras; potential purchasers who have not yet bought this version may want to hold out a little longer. I should have been more patient.
B00000DLV1|5.0|This is the album that made me a Portishead fan!  The amalgam of Acid Jazz and Hip Hop combined with sultry voice of Beth Gibbons peeked my curiosity from the very first track.  From the upbeat tempo of \\"All Mine\\" to the self-loathing undertones of \\"Roads\\", I could visualize the stories told in these songs.  This recording is on its way to becoming a classic.
B000000I0J|3.0|If most on each of his first four recordings, Tubular Bells, Hergest Ridge, Ommadawn, and Incantations, Mike Oldfield created rich musical banquets, then Platinum must be the dessert. The music is, for the most part, light and lilting, and these songs are not apt to stay with you like some of the themes from his earlier, and for that matter, later recordings.<br />Mr. Oldfield turns to shorter, more accessible songs on Platinum, perhaps a gambit either to gain radio airplay or to appease his record company. Or perhaps he wanted to simply try his hand at something different, less ostentatious (which is not really a bad thing after he may have overreached a bit on Incantations).<br />Of course, shorter is a relative term with Mr. Oldfield, and the four-part title track still clocks in at a bit more than 16 minutes. Each segment has its own strengths---my favorites are Airborne (Part I) and Charleston (Part III)---but at times his guitar work starts to grate a bit.<br />The cleverly named and conceived Woodhenge calms and soothes though the unusual percussion also unnerves one , as though you stumbled on a secret place and know that you are being watched.<br />Sally is a fun, upbeat ode to Mr. Oldfield's sister, and it exudes brightness and light.<br />What to make of Punkadiddle? A message to punk rockers, perhaps, who prefer destruction and deconstruction to building rafts of melodies that float through the songs?<br />Alas, the CD ends with the rather moribund take on I Got Rhythm, a remake that, in my opinion, never quite gels.<br />Platinum has an aura of sweetness, lightness, to the sound. It's perfect morning music for weeding one's perennial garden, painting watercolors, hanging out with the cats, or writing a chapter in a fantasy novel. But this recording is neither the best nor worst of Mr. Oldfield's discography.
B000006045|4.0|Truth be told, I didn't become aware of Massive Attack until they released \\"Teardrop\\" here in the U.S., and although smitten by that song, I didn't fully explore their music until four years later, when I heard some of their early singles and was inspired to take the plunge into Massive's world. From the sound of this album, that world is one in which you're never alone, just commiserating with the lonely. Semi-stalker anthem \\"Angel\\" begins with humming bass, and then builds until it climaxes in distorted menace. On \\"RisingSon\\", 3-D and Daddy G juxtapose bizarre lyrics-the former lamenting \\"cheap beers filled with crocodile tears\\"; the latter sing-speaking part of the Pete Seeger classic \\"Where Have All The Flowers Gone\\"-with a lethal, head-nodding beat. <br />\\"Teardrop\\" provides the first part of the album's centerpiece, as the Cocteau Twins' Liz Fraser pours her angelic vocal over a staccato beat, punctuated by chilling stabs of piano. Part 2 of the album's centerpiece comes in the form of \\"Inertia Creeps\\", wherein music and lyrics combine to create a glorious, claustrophobic track that plays like an open wound. A romping bass line is the compass as 3-D navigates a hellish rap, warning, \\"inertia keeps/moving up slowly/inertia creeps/moving up slowly\\". Thankfully, MA insert a break from the murky action via the warm sonic washes of the instrumental \\"Exchange\\" (Horace Andy closes the album with an equally compelling vocal version of the song). On the crunching, \\"Dissolved Girl\\", we return to the shadows, as Sara Jay purrs her way into oblivion; and an amped up cover of John Holt's \\"Man Next Door\\" provides another perfect vehicle for Andy's brawny voice. <br />However, the album really kicks into high gear with the dubby, disturbing trilogy of \\"Black Milk\\", the epic title track, and the stunning \\"Group Four\\". \\"Black Milk\\", which features Fraser on vocals, opens with ghostly piano, and then takes the listener to dub heaven. The sleek title track features 3-D and DaddyG, the latter of whom utters perhaps the most poignant lyric of the entire album when he intones, \\"you know you had a heart made of stone/you should have let me know\\". Finally, on \\"Group Four\\", 3-D and Fraser share vocal duties over a typical MA beat, then the song careens ever faster until you think it's about to drop off the end of the earth. The aforementioned album-closing vocal version of \\"Exchange\\" only slightly melts the ice forest that is \\"Mezzanine\\". At the end of the journey through this bruised sonic landscape, the wounds are still fresh, but beginning to heal.
1587990717|2.0|\\"A taxi cab driver told me laughing that the best parts of this book are the hard cover and the beautifully coloured jacket. But more on its virtues later. Let me close this paragraph by repeating what I said in the beginning...Finally, it is worth noting that Plato, Kafka and Popper clearly predicted that I am the greatest.\\"<br />This is of course not a true quote from the book but shows how it sounded to me while I compelled myself to reading it from cover to cover in order to dis-cover something interesting and clearly presented. Alas...no success!<br />Here is just one rather typical true quote from the book showing style and consistency: Under the heading \\"Computing instead of thinking\\" we read on page 188 \\"One Harry Markowitz received something called the Nobel Memorial Prize (which in fact is not even a Nobel Prize...An immediate result of Dr. Markowitz's theory was the near collapse of the financial system in the summer of 1998 (as we saw in Chapters 1 and 5)...Drs. Merton and Scholes...caused the birth of your humble crisis-hunter's [the author's] firm, Empirica - as capital started flowing to people who did the exact opposite of what they did for a living.\\" What an achievement over the criticized approach, to do exactly the opposite! Notice also the abandonment of any randomness in this strategy!<br />Summarizing: it is the reader who is fooled - by the author. Two stars (one for the contents, upgraded to two because, as I said before, the book looks beautiful on my bookshelf).
B000069AUI|5.0|While it would have been easy to dismiss their first album<BR>at first listen as another Radiohead rip-off, there was something undeniable in its pop driven falsetto simplicity.<BR>But on \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\", melodies at once brave and familiar pull you in and hold you in an irresistable embrace and surround you with solid guitar hooks and pulsating bass figures. Prominent on this record are piano- laden mournful pieces that threaten to inject long lost emotion into a pop music arena that no longer knows those words. I'll play this one for a long, long time.
B00005Q66T|4.0|And that title would even be a little misleading.  It was kind of surprising that Madonna not only released a second Greatest Hits album with little fan faire but also insisted on not having any new tracks on there.  On top of that, GVH2 cuts out Madonna's huge period of dour ballads like \\"Rain\\" and \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\".  That isn't so bad when you consider the 1995 release of the ballad collection \\"Something To Remember\\" (which shockingly had 3 different new songs!).  GHV2 is after the young audience that wants the real popular Madonna songs from the last ten or so years.   <br />\\"GHV2\\" is in loose chronological order.  It begins with the disco jam \\"Depper and Deeper\\" and than dives into the pulsating \\"Erotica\\".  All the silky \\"Bedtime Stories\\" singles are here yet all are edited for radio (the R&B dance groove \\"Human Nature\\" doesn't use bleeps\\" but insists on repeating phrases instead).  Same for the techno savvy \\"Ray Of Light\\" tracks.  \\"Beautiful Stranger\\", the trippy \\"Austin Powers\\" pop track, finally gets placement on a Madonna album along with \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\".  Odd thing about \\"Argentina\\" is that it is the ballad version, not the dance remix that helped the single to shoot up to the Top Ten in the states.  The album closes with Madonna's biggest hit of the last 10 or so years, \\"Music\\".  Edits and edits and more edits.  The album has only 15 tracks so they its unfair to say that there was any time restriction.  Also, the opus ballad original of \\"Argentina\\" is disappointing considering the pop feel of the album (even on slower tracks like \\"Power Of Goodbye\\" and \\"Drowned World\\").<br />This album \\"ebbs and flows\\" nicely but is a let down, using radio edits, cutting major hits and just be thrown together to for only profit. What is this supposed to be, Madonna (or WB records)?  \\"Greatest Hits for Minimalists\\"?  If so, that only applies to the music considering the hundreds of Madonna photos inside (they are about the size of a small finger nail if not smaller).  This album only sounds brilliant with the presence of the missing ballads (\\"I'll Remember\\" is another eligible) and maybe a non-single track like the stellar \\"Impressive Instant\\" so if you have to buy \\"GVH2\\", also buy \\"Something To Remember\\" along with any of Madonna's albums released after 1991.
0767819446|4.0|There have been many &quot;surprise ending&quot; films in the last few years, but just knowing that tends to make a viewer more alert.  Unlike most films of this sort, that lay their clues so with such subtlely and you may only pick them up in retrospect, this one allows you to realize the truth as it unfolds before the hero.  <BR>  While the to story is not deep and you will probably figure it out, at least if you haven't stumbled on it by chance, before the hero does, it does have an interesting point to make &quot;cogito ergo sum.&quot;   <BR>  In terms of the proformance itself, Muellar-Stahl and D'Onofrio are as great as ever.  Even Moll shows talent in playing two ( or three ) distinct rolls.  While the lead realy is the weakness it may only be in comparison to the strenghths of Muellar-Stahl and D'Onofiro, so give him a chance.  <BR>  As to the plot itself, it is a typical cyber whodonit.  Telling you more would ruin it.  There are some films out there better seen with no idea whatsoever about the plot, even if that is only so you can pat yourself on the back if you figure it out at the end. )  In all, I do recommend it.

B000002NC4|5.0|What can I say that has not been previously been said? I know my fairly recent discovery of Built to Spill will have a huge impact on the way I view music. And this album, definitely Doug Martsch's greatest creation, is brilliantly constructed. There are no words I can use to describe its greatness. It took a while for it to sink in. I'll be honest... It was somewhat dull to me at first. There's Nothing Wrong With Love was the album that got me hooked. But I decided to listen to Perfect From Now On a few more times... to give it another chance. And its amazingness hit me. I was blown away. Doug Martsch is a true genius. The songs are all in themselves amazing pieces of musical artwork. But the album as a whole flows beautifully from start to finish.<br />It starts out with a pretty slow song with great guitar work and interesting lyrics. This long song has an eerie, dramatic feel to it. And Doug's vocals here are some of his best. Next is I Would Hurt a Fly. One of my favorite Built to Spill songs of all. The change in tempo at the end during the solo is great. Stop the Show is the song that stands out the most at first. It's what kept me listening to the album... hoping the other songs would catch me as well. They did eventually. Anyway, don't let the long slow start fool you. This song explodes into utter amazingness. The simple guitar riffs reminiscent of Big Dipper are very good here. Made Up Dreams is one of the last songs I was hooked on. A nice keyboard kicks in about a third of the way through and adds a lot of substance to the song. Velvet Waltz has latley been one of my favorite songs. Just the slow build up from the start to the epic guitar solo. Another great song. Out of site has some really interesting lyrics. It's one of the shorter songs on the album. Parts of the song are louder &amp; more upbeat, which presents a good contrast. It fades out, and begins Kicked it in the Sun. My favorite Built to Spill Song and one of my favorites of all time. It starts out pretty slow and serene.. but has a sudden tempo change (A very common thing on this album) in the middle. The song from then on gets only better. You would have to give this song a few listens to truly understand its greatness. I cannot express it in words. The final song, Untrustable, is another epic one. Nearly 9 minutes long. Yet it keeps my interest throughout. The final minute and a half is the best part, and a perfect closing to a perfect album. <br />As someone stated in a previous review... If you are new to Built to Spill, check out There's Nothing Wrong With Love first, and then move to this. And give it some time. I did, and now it has changed my outlook on music forever.

B0000542D2|4.0|Where oh where is the Running, Jumping, Standing Still Film?<BR>It was on the MPI VHS tape why not the Mirimax DVD? It is part of the history of this wonderful film and speaks volumes of A Hard Day's Night's inception. It's inclusion would have been as important as the interviews with aging assistant editors and the like. In fact the interviews with the aging cast and crew are mildly interesting but a bit tedious when seen next to the youthful vigor of the film. Some out-takes or Beatle interviews about the film would have been nice. The cover should have been the original movie poster. Generally the extras could have been more of a treat but in a world where Michael Jackson owned and sold half of the Beatles catalog to Sony/CBS and Disney is charged with re-releasing the Beatles breakthrough film these  shortcommings are hardly surprising. The movie is as always outstanding and refreshing even after all these years. Nice to have it on DVD. The 4 stars are for the DVD package not the movie which gets all 5, no let's make that 10!

B000005IRG|5.0|I don't generally write reviews, but when I saw this album's average rating was only a 4 & 1/2, I had to add my five stars. When I first heard this album, it absolutely rejuvenated my interest in rock n' roll. Although I was born too late to see groups like Television when they were still playing CBGB, I had always been a big music fan, as open to things that came before my time as I was to newer styles. But, at the ripe old age of 22, in 1999, when I first made contact with Marquee Moon, I had started to wander from rock music, figuring I'd heard just about all of its various possibilities explored by some band or another. This album changed my mind completely. Never, I repeat, never has anything like this been done before or since. It is alive, passionate, persuasive, groundbreaking, imaginative, playful, serious, emotional, raw, and rocking all at once. It is rebellious. It is entirely unique. It is a masterpiece. I took to it immediately. If you don't, force yourself not to give up on it so fast. Dig for the meaning, experience the upheaval, listen for the sounds you've never heard anywhere else and wonder how this band uncovered them. And when you're done, realize that there are dozens and dozens of other bands out there just like Television--virtually unheard of in the realm of the mainstream, and yet totally genius, just waiting to be discovered. Marquee Moon rules!

B00003CX5P|5.0|I think that once George Lucas has completed the Star Wars saga we will look upon this film more sympathetically. It was savaged on release for its awful script and wooden acting, and that will still remain true, but it will be seen more and more important in relation to the whole saga. It is merely an introduction, and at the time, critics and fans alike were dissaponted because nothing was new.
0316666343|3.0|After a teenage girl is raped and murdered by a neighbor we follow her family, and other relevant characters (the murderer, lead investigator, high school friends), through the immediate aftermath and long term effects of her death. Our guide is the murdered girl herself, an intelligent and open-minded narrator called Susie Salmon. She is in heaven and able to follow the living liberally. <br />During most of the book, which takes place during the days, weeks, and months after the tragedy, Susie paints a harrowing portrait of how different community members cope.  Among those featured: The grieving father's coddling of his youngest son, the lead detective's sincere-- but clumsy-- investigation, and the murderer's glee and utter professionalism as he disposes the dead girl's body. We are also treated to a sweet depiction of Susie's heaven: it is tailored made for her and filled with<BR>favorite things from her days on earth. <br />Towards the end, the author looses her cool. Her editor must have been on vacation (there is no other explanation)  and, consequently,  we are treated to a glorious meltdown:<br /> * Susie's narration, which was engaging and true to a teenager,<BR>suddenly sounds as erudite as a graduate student consulting   with her dissertation adviser.  <BR> * Her knowledge of sexual facts (in practice and theory) would  make Dr. Ruth blush.<BR> * A high school friend mingles with Susie's spirit and, after<BR>graduating from high school, moves to New York, sports an all-black wardrobe, visits heaven (don't ask me how) and preaches to dead people about dying (don't ask me why, or how-- it's a surprise!)<br />I encourage everyone to read this book. It must have been impossible, after such a beguiling start, to find a resonant ending. My suggestion:<BR> <BR>Once the narrative starts jumping years stop reading and call it a book,otherwise be brave and trudge-on.
0790744473|4.0|Given the tone of many comments here, I wish I'd seen the stage version of this first; it's apparently been restaged for the screen. That said, the film does have its merits: music by Lerner & Lowe, a fine cast of performers (Van Johnson is particularly effective as a wisecracking cynic who, nevertheless, still manages a pleasant soft-shoe with Gene Kelly), and a lighter-than-air book & story. Regarding Kelly and Cyd Charisse (a symphony of beauty here), they are fine; my only complaint is that they dance more apart than together. Beautiful as \\"The Heather on the Hill\\" is, it's the only complete duet with them (a reprise of the same dance comes at the end of their courtship, but it barely lasts 60 seconds). Charisse is gorgeous with her future bridesmaids in the number \\"Waitin' For My Dearie,\\" and Kelly is superb with buddy Johnson and the locals in \\"I'll Go Home With Bonnie Jean.\\" When the main plot point is finally explained away in roughly five minutes of the second hour, the fairy tale suddenly becomes more powerful- and therefore more poignant. The sound stage interiors have never bothered me, as most musicals were shot in studios; so I've never understood why so many people are using that fact as fodder to criticize this movie. The plot is lushly romantic and, as someone else noted, all romantics will love this one, warts and all.
B00005B36H|5.0|okay.  They started with opiate.  Brilliant, but raw.  They had a different sound, but it had yet too develop.  They made a bit of money, and were thus able to experiment a little more with Undertow.  The result was an album chalk full of new sounds, and capable of displaying their talent.  From there, they progressed to Aenima.  This album i believe was the perfect bridge between the old sound, and things to come.  Incredibly heavy melodies with an often psychadelic sound to be developed on their fourth and final album.<BR>That brings us to Lateralus.  Wow.  My 50 year old father, a die hard Pink Floyd fan (the only band to come close to Tool in musical genius) can't stop listening to it.  he truly appreciates the ability of the band as a whole.  Danny carey is truly the most creative and talented drummer of our time.  Justin Chancellors creativity with a bass is unmatched.  Adam Jones perfected his guitar sound with this album.  It is next to impossible to duplicate.  (believe me i've tried)  Never have i heard such sounds come out a guitar.  Of course, Maynard James Keenan has absolutely the greatest voice ever to grace the Metal music scene.  Although, i really don't believe that this album can be classified as metal.  Tool are truly creating a genre all their own, and are currently the only band operating within said genre.<br />All in all, one of the greatest albums ever.  All you Tool gans that were disapointed, give the album another listen, and just appreciate the talent!
0316666343|5.0|I am astonished by Alice Sebold's imagination. Her vision of heaven and souls is wonderfully convincing, down to the smallest real-life details, such as the \\"cold chill,\\" worked into her illustration of the movement of souls. Sebold's description of life in heaven is understandable that souls can't physically change things the way they could on Earth, yet their position is still so powerful in that they can see everything that happens, not only physically, but mentally as well. In this story, it's both awe-inspiring, and heartbreaking. The telling a story through the eyes of a young girl (who happens to be dead), casts a whole new spin on the novel.<br />It's true that the beginning of the novel is shocking and difficult to read, but I think it was a necessary beginning, and perfectly written too. Sebold wrote the incident that highlights the brutal reality that happens on Earth, yet she wrote it eloquently. Plus it brings you so close to Susie right from the beginning, wanting almost to protect her in some way.<br />Susie Salmon seems perceptive beyond her years, and it makes me wonder if in Sebold's mind, a traumatic event that Susie experienced will automatically force her to grow up in a short amount of time. Or does being a soul in heaven cause one to be more reflective, more attentive to the details of life on earth? Or maybe, was Susie herself an especially intelligent and sensitive fourteen-year old, unique to other kids her age?<br />It's a very positive outlook on life after death. A touching look at the many ways people live with grief and eventually move forward. So many good people's lives Susie affected while on Earth, yet after she left, the various turns they took was baffling. My favorite character was Ruth, an odd girl who was one of the very few people who could sense Susie nearby. Constantly writing in her journal, she was able to see much of what Susie could see from Heaven. Susie's mother was most perplexing. She couldn't stand the constant reminders of her deceased daughter, and sought to escape through adultery, and eventually left her family altogether. Through all of her vastly different characters, Susie?s father, Jack Salmon, who never gave up solving the mystery behind her death, the emotionally strong younger sister Lindsay, the brutally honest and hilarious alcoholic Grandma Lynn, the love of Susie's life--Ray, and of course, Susie's meticulously sinister murderer, George Harvey. The author thoroughly showed us the many ways that grief can affect people. I like the fact that not only was this a story about Susie, it was many stories, narrated by Susie. I cared for every character because each one was developed as a complicated, growing, important individual who I eventually knew intimately.<br />Ultimately, it's a \\"lovely\\" portrait of how deeply we touch each other without even knowing it. And if you believe in life after death, it certainly is a comforting thought that souls are among us, watching us all the time, and that it's okay to acknowledge that.inders of her deceased daughter, and sought to escape through adultery, and eventually left her family altogether.

0783225792|3.0|It's too long, and its too repetitive of the other Scorsese/DeNiro/Pesci mob movie. The saving grace is Stone's performance. She steals every scene she's in.<br />DiNiro is just being DiNiro. Pesci is so damn annoying that who cares?  Stone is the only actor who actually put an effort into  developing their character, instead of resting on a reputation  as an excuse for delivering a mediocre, if not be it poor performance.<br />It's just another mob movie. However Sharon Stone makes it worth the long, long ride.
B00005JKDR|4.0|While I was skeptical of going to see another mediocre cartoon in theatres, I walked away from this flick really surprised.  The animation in Monsters Inc. was great.  John Goodman and Billy Crystal are a great on-screen vocal duo of the two main characters.  I know my three year old niece loved this movie, and so did I.  This movie translates well for DVD and the smaller screen with the sharp sound quality and out-there animation.  I don't think this movie will leave you with any dissapointment.  I give it a B+.
B000068FWC|5.0|_Breakfast In America_ is a progressive pop/rock album, featuring many catchy tunes, in a seemingly \\"light-hearted\\" manner. However, many listeners miss out on one key factor about this disc: It's very depressed and cynical in content.<br />There seems to be a constant-running theme about Fame (the troubles of getting on top, loss of it) throughout the album. Some of the lyrical content is not unlike Pink Floyd's _The Wall_. This album covers loneliness, depression, frustration, self-pity, loss and more. However, unlike most of the music found on _The Wall_, the music here cleverly conceals these dark themes in a light, elegant, fancy, quirky and playful way.<br />The combination of Roger Hodgson's light, fancy, sexy and playful voice, works well against the quirky jazz-pop found on this album. _Gone Hollywood_ is a great hard-driving track, featuring some elegant piano playing. _The Logical Song_ is the radio tune of the album. Clever, catchy lyrics (and music) that are both fun and educational. _Goodbye Stranger_ is mostly sung by keyboardist Rick Davies. Those that are used to Roger Hodgson's vocals may be disappointed by the sudden vocal changes (which happen on a few more tracks as well). The title track is a short, playful tune. However, once again--those little devils known as cynicism and self-pity appear in this track. _Oh Darling_, musically, is more slow and wallowing. _Take The Long Way Home_ seems more reflective and dreamy musically. _Lord Is It Mine_ features Roger Hodgson's most moving vocal delivery. _Just Another Nervous Wreck_ is arguably the strongest track on here. Rocking song with loads of drama. _Casual Conversations_ is the weakest on here, but it's still good. Mostly a slow track. _Child Of Vision_ is the 7-minute closer, which features a long instrumental ending.<br />The best way to sum up this review goes like this: If you like Queen, particularly albums like _Sheer Heart Attack_, _A Night At The Opera_ and/or _A Day At The Races_, you should love this. The quirky, elegant and fancy art rock/pop, combined with the drama and fancy pouting of Roger Hodgson should please many fans of Queen and Freddie Mercury (Roger sounds like a combination of Yes' Jon Anderson and Freddie Mercury). Highly recommendedshould love this.

B00005N9CV|5.0|Great album. What else do you expect from the gal who can suggest like no one else to do the near impossible and &quot;Peel me a Grape&quot;. &quot;The Look of Love&quot; was getting a little overplayed on the Chrysler commercials, but it's the best cover of this song since Sergio Mendez and Brazil '66. Wonderful piano and killer sensuous voice. &quot;Krall&quot; on down to the record store or click and order this one for some quiet special time with the significant other.
B00006F7S4|4.0|I've always been a fan of Beck. Including the time I walked out of the Rosemont Horizon during one of his sets touring behind 'Midnight Vultures' because his singing and the music were rubbing nauseous. But I still think he is completely original, sincere and focused on what it takes to make good music: the music.<br />This time around, Beck and Nigel Goderich have put together a gorgeuos classic. I went to bed at 9pm last night but ended up listening to the album around the horn 3x. I left it running and would wake up in the middle of the night to hear this comforting voice comforting himself.<br />If its not what you expected from Beck, then pretend its somebody you've never heard of and keep an open mind. I'm totally psyched about this record.

B00006J3WH|5.0|I've been waiting for this forever and let me tell you, it was worth the wait. What could be better than watching James Marsters? Hearing him sing! OMG! James and Tony's vocals are incredible, as well as Amber Bensons. The whole cast sounds great, but I have to say my fav track is James' &quot;Rest In Peace&quot;. It's a great album, even more so if you love Buffy. Do yourself a favor and take a listen.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I'll have to give this the nod as Pixar's best movie yet.  Why? Quite simply, the created almost everything from scratch.  Very little human/our world to base these models on.  It's all monsters and their world, so they had to work overtime to create a believable and realistic world all their own. They succeeded!<BR>     The voice work on this film is superb.  Many of the voices you'll get right away, others might not be as noticeable until you see the credits roll and you'll go &quot;Yeah, it WAS Xxxxx!&quot;  Billy Crystal is Mah-velous once again, injecting humor into nearly every scene he's in.  John Goodman gives a warm performance as well.  You just want to cuddle that monster!  And Boo, quite possibly, the cutest kid I've ever seen in a movie.<BR>     However, Steve Buscemi plays his character to the hilt, and my 2 1/2 year old, much like Boo, didn't like him too much.  He's that good at being creepy!<BR>     The story itself is heartwarming and fun, tinged with just enough sentimentality that most likely you'll love the ending, whether you need the Kleenex with you or not. :)  Me, I needed it.  Shhh...don't tell.  The kids will laugh at Dad!  <BR>     The second disc is jammed with extras to keep you entertained for hours.  You even get a couple of mini sequels that are not to be missed.  Now that I've seen both, I can't believe this lost to Shrek for Best Animated Feature.  Shrek, while a fun movie, just doesn't have the heart that Monster's Inc. brings to the table, and for me, that tips the scales in Pixar's favor!<BR>      So, if you've made it this far, and are on the fence about the movie, let's see:<BR>1) If you have kids, they'll want this movie.<BR>2) You'll enjoy watching this movie with your kids.<BR>3) You might even enjoy watching this movie WITHOUT your kids.<BR>4) If you don't have kids, you'll enjoy this movie anyway.<br />So, come down off that fence, and add this great disc to your collection!  You won't be disappointed.
0380729407|4.0|Two 13-year old boys are the centre of this book, but this is not really a children's book.  In fact, I suspect that the modern 13-year-old would find the philosophising tedious and the action trite.  However, to the older reader (say, high school and up), there is much to recommend the book.  The plot: a carnival arrives in town, unusually late in the season, and a few townspeople disappear.  The two boys investigate and learn that the people who were thought to have disappeared still exist, but in altered form: one has become a wizened dwarf while another has become a little girl.  They discover a carousel that can turn the clock - make you older or younger.  The carnival operators become alarmed by the boys and try to buy them off (by making them \\"grownups\\") or kidnap them.<br />Of course, the plot isn't as important as the atmosphere, which is truly creepy.  Carnivals and freak side-shows are creepy at the best of times, but Bradbury manages to instill dread and darkness into every scene.  The boys eventually enlist one of their fathers, who works at the local library, and who supplies the philosophy in the book.  Naturally it focusses on death and aging, which the carnival's carousel can reverse.<br />The supernatural elements are a nice touch, and unique (I don't think they've been copied).  Especially well-designed is the blind \\"witch\\" that can smell souls - she is essentially the bloodhound that tracks the boys for the carnival's master.<br />The only drawbacks are that the philosophy is a little simplistic (mostly because the father is simplistic) and the notion of a carnival is outdated.  It sounds quaint to modern ears that 13-year-old boys would be this excited about a carnival and its acts.  However, I enjoyed the book, and recommend it to others.
B000000W3G|4.0|I am a big fan of the Pumpkins, unfortunately, my parents require me to buy my own CDs. <BR>Now, if I had enough money, I would get this *excellent* group of CDs. <BR>I have gotten some of the songs online, so I can vouch for the excellence. My favorite single is Zero, with Marquis of Spades, Mouth of Babes, and God.<BR>And, to heavily contrast, I liked the Thirty-Three single, as well, with the more artsy The Last Song, Aeroplane Flies High, and My Blue Heaven.<BR>If you haven't heard many of the Pumpkins' songs, I would not recommend getting it. <BR>Myself? As I said before, if I could afford it, I would. But, now, I'll have to stick with mp3s.
0140143505|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from such a slim little book.  I read it in one sitting and was sorry when it ended.  The letters the author selected to include really fleshed out the characters.  I laughed out loud several times!  A wonderful read for a rainy day.

B00006AFUR|5.0|Well. I bought the 30 Seconds To Mars album thinking it would be cool. What i got was a storming 11 track master piece. This is something a bit more inteligent, a bit more rock, a bit above the rest. There is nothing bad about this album. It features great rock tracks like 'Capricorn' to tracks like 'The Mission' which just make u wana jump about, to great, more chilled tracks like 'Echelon' A fantastic album that will no dout grab u and keep u lock in it's power for a long, long, long time. A very highly recomended album for anyone who likes music.

6304145438|5.0|This movie is a great classic!! You'll love watching this on Christmas with your family!<br />The story is about a man, though it first shows him as a boy around 12, named George Bailey. He dreams of adventure, building things, and also traveling. But he is cooped up in his town called Bedford Falls because of business matters and troubles with the meanest and richest man in town called Mr.Potter. When George loses 8000 dollars, which is partly his Uncle Billy's fault, which is somewhat very important and can make him lose everything and go to jail. I didn't really understand why 8000 dollars could make him bankrupt, but anyway, it does. He panics and decides to commit suicide on Christmas Eve. An angel named Clarence who has no wings help him by showing him a world without him being born. It is a pretty bad world and George repents of his sin and of trying to commit suicide. The ending is great and you'll just love this movie forever!!
B000065V9N|5.0|This 1986 album is by far my favorite album by Gabriel. The downpouring synthesizers and guitars of Red Rain are stunning. I love the bizarre chord changes of That Voice Again and the eerieness of Wo Do what We're Told and This Is The Picture. My favorite though is In Your Eyes. I don't like the fact that it was moved to the end of the album. If you have the older CD version of SO, stick with it. A marvelous masterpiece that truly was one of the best CDs the 80s had to offer. BUY IT!!!!!!
B00006B1HH|3.0|I was really excited when I heard it was coming out since I grew up with the movie Grease.  Great music, strong cast, and great story line.  I got home and watched the movie and was very disappointed in the DVD production.  Paramount did a terrible job on remastering to digital and I think they need to do a reissue already with better DVD engineers.  There were many scenes where they were out of focus.  I made sure it wasn't my DVD as I ran many others to check it.  The sound for the talking scenes were fine, but the musical singing and dancing scenes had terrible audio.  It was very &quot;echoey&quot; and there were some music I could not recognize instantly.  All in all, movie is great, DVD stinks.
B0000542D2|5.0|Loved it!  Best musical movie, black and white I've ever seen.  Glad I bought it.  Many years of reading and research finds this DVD excellent.

0393316041|5.0|I have given this book to several high school graduates and plan to continue that tradition this year. This is especially humorous for those in the hard sciences (physics, math, engineering). Such a brilliant guy and so funny! Some of the adventures are just a hair unusual, but that is typical of college students, so it opens the mind of high school students to future possibilities (and possibly what to avoid!). Definitely recommended and a great gift that will be devoured.
6304936362|5.0|This movie moved me.  A great portrayal of what it means to be heroic.<br />I'm glad I didn't read any reviews before watching it.  I didn't know how it was going to end.<br />I was left guessing the whole time.<br />Very believable plot (based on true story).  Very inspiring.<br />I rank it among my favorites.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Who wants to listen to happy hip-hop music all day? Certainly not me.  Luckily Beck serves up some very melodical blues in 'Sea Change'. Having a bad day at work or school?  Maybe that special someone you like doesn't know you exist?  Pop in 'Sea Change' and see the world through Beck colored glasses.  Nearly every track on this cd has a slow, melodious beat with acoustic guitar.  'Sea Change' is perfect for that long drive home from work.

0440234743|2.0|Finally Grisham writes a novel that is based elsewhere, in this case Washington and Brasil. The storyline is interesting - excentric spiteful billionaire wanting revenge one last time on his ungrateful children and ex-wives. However, there is a lack of tension in this story, which seems to end a little too easily and with apparently no conflict. The winning side in this case is clear right from the start. The story has some interesting elements to it, but I found it overall disappointing in the end.

0393317552|5.0|Jared Diamond makes a point of the fact that at the time he wrote this book, that Europeans who were living in New Guinea enjoyed a higher standard of living then even the native chieftains.  Evidence of 'racism', yes?  One gets the idea, though, that he would prefer the reverse.  That is, that Europeans 'joined the club' and reverted to hunter gatherers.<br />You will be told that the very same elements credited with the rise of western Europe \\"were developed by other peoples living elsewhere and were then imported to western Europe.\\"  However, he makes no attempt whatsoever to explain why these elements were of no use to their original 'developers'.<br />Although he decries the idea that western Europeans have a higher intelligence for any genetic reason and calls this idea 'loathsome'.  He nevertheless amazes the observant reader with a multitude of reasons why the reverse must be true!  He states that \\"New Guineans suffered high mortality from murder, chronic tribal warfare, accidents and problems in procuring food.  Intelligent people are likelier than less intelligent ones to escape those high causes of mortality in traditional New Guinea societies.\\"  Lest there be any argument that this is indeed a genetic cause for superior racial intelligence he makes it very clear by following this paragraph with this, \\"Besides this genetic reason...\\"<br />I fail to see where he is going with this 'proof' since the same argument could be made on behalf of an 'antelope'!<br />Although one not steeped in reverse prejudice would think that the extreme advantages that come in a western European civilization from mastering mathematics, literature and science would encourage these traits in the next generation, Jared Diamond instead informs us that, in a western European society,  it is so easy to reproduce that one can reproduce no matter how low your intelligence!<br />Since he can obviously offer no accomplishment to make his point of a higher intelligence by virtue of New Guinean race, he instead informs us that, as he judges it, the mark of intelligence is being \\"more alert, more expressive, and more interested in things and people around them then the average European or American is.\\"<br />Perhaps he should expect a look of utter and complete BOREDOM when in the company of a European or an American.<br />This is all so idiotic that I can barely continue to read past page 25, although if I do, my criticisms are sure to be longer than his work.  But for sure, this is not the book that ended racism.  This is the book that replaces one group's racism for another's.

B000002MP2|5.0|In the start of a decade that looked to be filled with dance and rap as the dominating genres of that era, there was a shining glimmer of hope for fan of rock.  The now legendary band from Berkeley, Green Day, released quite possibly the most influential album of its time, as it has triggered the start of many other bands in the area (Blink 182, No Use For A Name, etc.).  In their release of this cd, they began their journey in the rock world, and in effective fashion:<br />ANALYSIS OF TRACK LISTING:<BR>1. Burnout: 4.5/5-a fast paced, distorted guitar-blaring anthem that showed how people didn't grow up, but rather just burnout out.... A great start to the album with a great drum part in the bridge<br />2. Having a Blast: 4/5-possibly one of their most controversial songs (next to Platypus, on nimrod), it is a song about a person who is going to kill everyone in their path.... a very catchy song<br />3. Chump: 4.5/5-One of the un-appreciated tracks of this cd, Chump is about hating a specific person, though you've never even see them.... the instrumental in this is very good<br />4. Longview: 4/5-The original and only tribute to masturbation to date (at least to my knowledge).... despite it's widespread appeal, you may grow tired of this song, due to its excessive air time on the radio.... the bass part in this song is quite good as well<br />5. Welcome to Paradise: 4.5/5-A re-release track from their Lookout! Records release, kerplunk!, this track is about a young man who ventures away from home and eventually finds himself in paradise.... one of the best bass solo's i have ever heard<br />6. Pulling Teeth: 3.5/5-A slower-paced song, highlighting a true event of being busted up by the one you love (Mike Dirnt had both of his elbows broken while having a pillow fight with his wife Anastacia).... good, but a little bit too slow for my taste<br />7. Basket Case: 5/5-Quite possibly one of the best songs of all time, this song focuses on the mental instability of a single person and his ventures to find sanity.... A MUST LISTEN!!<br />8. She: 4.5/5-another great song, following up Basket Case.... it is mainly a reflective song giving advice to a girl that the person loves.... to stop yelling at them before they go insane..... Dirnt shows his talent with another great bass intro<br />9. Sassafras Roots: 4/5-a repetitive song that ventures the question \\"May I waste your time too....?\\" the lyrics will catch on, and don't be surprised if you end up singing it after hearing it a few times<br />10. When I Come Around: 4/5-a solid song, possibly their most well-known song on this album.... it is about getting somewhere that you need to be, and the one that matters knowing where to find you.... has a good guitar solo, and a solid bass and drum line<br />11. Coming Clean: 4.5/5-a better song than When I Come Around, it is a great increase of the pace that was held back by the previous track.... it is mainly about a person \\"coming clean\\" about being of an alternate sexual orientation.... a fun, quick and to the point song<br />12. Emenius Sleepus: 4.5/5-A continuation from the previous song, Billie Joe now sings how he's sick and wants to go home, since he doesn't know his friend at all anymore.... a VERY good song, as it keeps the pace of the album up as it comes begins to come to a close.....<br />13. In The End: 4/5-the second to last song, it provides a clear message: not liking what you see in the future and hoping that you're not dead when somethin important comes around.... it has a solid bridge yet again, and brings us into the final \\"official\\" track of the disc......<br />14. F.O.D. 4.5/5-the final track of the CD, it is  a mellow beginning, but then a loud and very clear anthem.... it mainly just says how the person wants everyone to F.O.D., which if you listen to the song, you will figure out what it means.....<br />Hidden Track: All By Myself 3.5/5-a very funny track that the guys recorded while they were high in one of their friends basements.... funny, but it won't be worth the wait for much more than two times
B00006J3WH|5.0|Hey...these songs are good. While some voices are decent in a sweet folks-y way (Tara and Giles), some thin and tinny (Buffy herself), these are well composed songs. Very &quot;Rent&quot; like in a somber, urban tone. But it does use irony to be a traditional musical in some instances. And the lyrics are as clever as the show's dialouge.<br />A must have for one who enjoys the artistic risks the tv show takes.
B00003CXAE|1.0|I have to admit I was pumped when I found out this was coming to DVD.  The movie is a timeless classic.  The DVD release is of course the quality movie you remember and probably own on VHS.<BR>The 1-STAR rating is for such a poor job of quality on DVD (lets not even go off on the cheap cardboard case).  Its looks as if Paramount found the worst print of film and threw it on DVD.  There are dust speckels and drop ins everywhere (almost like going to see the movie at one of those dollar theatres after the print has been run a hundred times at the first run movie house.<BR>What was REMASTERED, I cannot tell, even the 5.1 audio leaves me questioning, but then again quality of picture kills the whole DVD.  Come to think of it my widescreen version from 1998 on VHS is a better cut of film.  WOW ! I have never said that before about a VHS......

B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay is an out of college band from Britain, which is comparable to Radiohead. Chris Martin at the age of twenty three leads the band with his shaky voice and ambitious guitar playing. The band's music is enjoyable and powerfully moody. Their music has the acoustic sound of Radiohead, yet has <BR>their own fashion of music. The powerful mood of the music varies from somewhat gloomy to blissful and to a calm, relaxed state. When Parachutes was released it climbed higher than Eminem's album, &quot;Marshall Mathers LP&quot; on the UK music charts. Their album remained in the top ten for 33 more weeks. They climbed the charts mainly because of the songs &quot;Yellow&quot;, &quot;Trouble&quot;, and &quot;Shiver&quot;. Coldplay has not had just those hits but others including others like &quot;Sparks&quot; and &quot;High Speed&quot; which are songs that have been oustanding hits internationally. &quot;Parachutes&quot; is an album you would enjoy if you are a fan of Radiohead, Travis, Sparklehorse, or Supergrass.

B00004Z459|5.0|Hybrid Theory, Linkin Park's freshman album (Produced by Don Gilmore), tastefully fuses intense rap with straight edged rock. This album blends Linkin Park in with other modern rock groups such as Crazy Town, Limp Bizkit, and other bands that mix the sound of rap and rock together to create a great sound that is gaining popularity in today's music. Oddly most rap/rock groups have swearing but Linkin Park doesn't in this album. \\"Crawling\\" and \\"One Step Closer\\" are songs which start off with a calm and relaxed sound that explodes into intense, adrenaline pumping <BR>music. One of the songs, \\"Points of Authority\\", adds a deep and heavy style of music to be on a comedic movie called \\"Little Nicky\\", which stars Adam Sandler. The music videos from the chart topping songs have great visuals. \\"Crawling\\" includes a broken up world and a girl that is crying from being beaten. Her mascara is running down into the drain, which starts <BR>the song off to a slow quiet intro, and then suddenly the lead singer screams the lyrics. Throughout the video the world is being pieced back together. In the end the girl has a great smile and looks vigorous. This album features positive and negative lyrics with plenty of contrasting sounds that lead the listener along a spectrum of emotions.
0060090367|5.0|This book was great!  Marian Keyes has a awesome way with characters.  I couldn't put it down. The walsh family is a classic.  I'm waiting for the book about Helen.  I have read all the others.
0316666343|3.0|The Lovely Bones had super potential and there are beautifully written chapters - BUT- it feels way too long and sometimes falls into the &quot;The Lifetime Movie for Women&quot; category -- kind of unbelievable or soap opera-ish.  What the author needed was a good and ruthless editor.  I'm not saying it's not worth the read, but your eyes do glaze over for periods of time!
0553347845|5.0|If you have read other written works by Feynman, you will enjoy this set of musings and stories.   His premise is a great one, and well taken to heart.   In this book, he also details his loving and somewhat unorthadox relationship with his wife during his years at Los Alamos.   A quick, fun, worthwhile read.
6303567126|4.0|Stories about drug addicts are usually not my bag.  See my review on Easy Ryder.  However, the acting packed scenes and the fast paced nature of Basketball Diaries, make it an entertaining study.  Leo DiCaprio is very compelling in his role as a basketball star turned junkie as you can really feel his traumas. Mark Walhberg plays a good foil for Leo as his thug partner.  Bruno Kirby is his usual steady self as the basketball coach.<br />Many of the scenes are not too pleasing with drug addicts rolling around looking for their next fix.  In addition, the rampid theivery and misbehavior by Jim and his thug like friends is a bit overdone.  Its a wonder how children with Catholic School upbringings turn out so misguided.  However, Jim eventualy finds himself with poetry and eventually picks himself up.  But not without hitting rock bottom first.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This CD has every great Elvis song on it that you can think of. It has a total of 31 tracks. It also includes three newly remixed version of a little less conversation. This CD starts off with his early years with heartbreak hotel. Then it works up to way down released in July of 1977, 1 month before his death. This album is not the type you buy for only 5 songs out of 31 this CD you would buy for all of the songs because they are so great. When you get this CD you may want to by two because you will be listing to it so often that it will wear out.
0790730960|5.0|When I first saw it this film in theaters, I was doubtful that it would even come close to the original, but I was extremely surprised.  I was quite pleased with what I saw, however the main reason that this film did so well, in my opinion, was the return of Michael Keaton as Batman and Tim Burton as director.  Burton's unique, one-of-a-kind style gave this film a touch of elegance like no other.  Unlike the first film, Gotham City is preparing to celebrate Christmas this time around, giving Burton the opportunity to create a hauntingly beautiful winter portrait as the main setting.  Burton's view of this franchise is what made the first two films so great -- there is no other out there who even comes close to his personal style.<br />Next is the plot.  While it wasn't as creative and original as the original (the Joker's hip minions were much better villians than the Penguin's clown gang), it didn't do all that bad.  I feel that Michael Keaton had a stronger role this time around, since the excellent Jack Nicholson (the Joker) completely stole center stage in the first film.  Rather than have the imbalance that the first film had in which the villain seemed to have a bigger role than the hero, Keaton's Batman seemed evenly matched this time around with the Penguin (a chilling Danny DeVito) and the mysterious Catwoman (played excellently by Michelle Pffiefer, who bounced back and forth between the character's tranquility and the brink of insanity with sheer brilliance).  True, these villians were nothing near Jack Nicholson's depiction of the Joker, but it was a good effort.  I personally liked the idea of two villians at once, it brought more style and independence to this film so it could be separated from the first film in some sort of form.<br />Many people argue that this film was much darker and violent than the first film, and though I don't think this is entirely true, I have to agree a little bit.  I wouldn't say that the film is necessarily more violent than the first, but the themes are definitely much deeper than the first.  The first film concentrated on the Joker's increasing influence over Gotham City, while this one seemed aimed more at the Penguin's dark and anger-driven madness towards living in the sewers all these years, as well as Selina Kyle's violent and traumatized transformation into the distraught Catwoman.  Whereas the villian of the Joker seemed to rely on comedy in the first film, the two villians in this film were driven more by their own personal anger and frustration, which is what leads them into their descent into madness.  <br />All in all, I enjoyed this film more than the first.  I'm not saying that this film was better -- the first film will always be the best, however I seemed to enjoy myself more this time around.  Danny Elfman's score is also excellent; he adds another drop of elegance to this film by using the same main title from the first film while adding a blaring score that personifies the Penguin's devilish personality as well as furious, high-pitched violins that identify the Catwoman.  So if you enjoy the Batman franchise, I highly recommend this second film.  It's definitely worth taking a look at.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|I absoluty disagree with the customer who gave it one star.  I am from a generation that gets to appreciate all music.  I grew up on the Rock and Roll from the 60's &amp; 70's, but I love the more modern alternative rock like Creed, Stone Temple Piolets and Pearl Jam.  Lenny Kravitz is perfect for anyone who loves good old-fashion Rock and Roll.<BR>Lenny Kravitz came around at a perfect time with the music world was becoming infected with bubble gum sound pop trying to fool the American public into thinking that they knew anything about Rock and Roll.  He showed them all what true Rock and Roll is about.
B0000640VO|5.0|Yes, yes, this is Audrey Tautou, cute, perfectly green, French as it gets, alien......that's the word I wanted....alien....is our species really capable of being this wonderful?  innocent?  perceptive?  kind?.....pick one, they're all so alien to the films that have been made up to this point....this is a hurricane of fresh air so badly needed it's not possible to explain until you've seen the film.<br />Personally, the wicked humor, the philosophical philandering, the innocent good intentions, the soaring human spirit of the whole film gave me a new window on what film can do.  This is one that will be seen throughout the century and, if we're lucky, will inspire a new generation of film makers....I can hardly wait.
B00004Z400|4.0|I really like this cd. my favorite song is change, but i also like pink maggit and digital bath.  I didn't give it 5 stars because some of it is very repetitive.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Rolling Stone has reviewed several hundred albums so far this year.  Two got 5 stars (classic).  This is one of them.  This is a HUGE album.  It will sound just as good 30 years from now.  Beck plays whatever he wants, without regard for what's popular, or what the label wants.  From that standpoint, he's a lot like the Beatles in their day.  The amazing thing is that, like very few other musicians, he's able to appeal to a broad audience.  At times, &quot;Sea Change&quot; sounds like Bowie, and yes, like the Beatles themselves.  The CD as a whole actually has a Sgt. Peppers or White album feel, since it each song fits quite nicely with the next, even though they're different styles.  There's a beautiful melancholy driving it.  Beck is living proof that 30 somethings have their Dylan or Lennon, or Bowie.  Like the giants who came before him, Beck can boast of not one, but several masterpieces.  This is one of them.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|This film is the exact opposite of High Noon. In that movie, there was one hero anyway, well maybe 2 if you count Will Kane's wife when the story ends. At the end of this violent Western epic, everyone has blood on their hands. It tells the truth of violence, legal or illegal. There are no heroes when one is dealing violence and death. The entire cast is one of the finest ensembles ever brought together. It is surely the equal of the cast of The Wild Bunch, and maybe even superior. Gene Hackman is brilliant as the psycopathic bully of a Town Sherrif. Richard Harris is chilling as a murderous Bounty Hunter. He is traveling with his own personal so-called biographer who is writing his exploits for the pulp novels. Then there is Morgan Freeman, one of his finest most complex performances in his career as Eastwood's friend and partner in murder. In the end, though, this film is about Clint Eastwood. We first meet him as a sod buster farming the ruins of a life, caring for his two children and mourning his deceased wife. He can barely speak above a whisper he is so gentle and cowed. But we soon learn he is a man of violent past deeds of mayhem and murder. He admits to killing one of everything that ever walked on the earth and more. Hired on by a young wanna-be gun slinger, he and Freeman head off to avenge the stabbing, not fatal, of a prostitute on a frontier town. The film is incredibly violent, and matter of fact about it as well. It is filmed with a very dark palette, with dark night scenes and dimly lit interiors that add an almost palpable sense of the times. This is a great piece of cinema, and must be watched by anyone who is serious about American film as an art. In time it will surely be looked back on as a classic of world cinema as well.
B00006F7S4|3.0|I think Beck has a overall real mellow sounding Album&while that is Good on one hand on the other it doesn't spell out Great or Even good Songs.the overall Arrangements&His Vocal stylings are fairly basic here.the Album has some moments but nothing just reaches out&grabs me like His older material with at least one Catchy song.
0684800713|5.0|No matter what his detractors say, THE SUN ALSO RISES will always be one of Hemingway's true gems. He had the great gift. Period.<BR>You might also want to give Charles Bukowski a try, Knut Hamsun's Hunger, James Ross' They Don't Dance Much, Kirk Alex'es Working the Hard Side of the Street, Nelson Algren's The Neon Wilderness, Dan Fante's Spitting Off Tall Buildings... Fine writing lives on.

B0000047CX|4.0|Can't get enough of that mellow Getz sound. Astrud sounds pretty good herself. Would have given it five stars except there is just a bit too much of Joao Gilberto here--a relatively minor quibble, since it's Samba, after all.
B00006EXDM|5.0|I have never been so fanatical about sound before now.  It has always been performance first, the former taking a back seat.  Without question, these classic albums have stood the test of time as well as any recordings ever released!  All the studio discs released in 1986 sans the hits packages were brought under my roof, including the rare U.K. version of Aftermath.  That being the case, I decided to test the waters of the new remasters with &quot;Hot Rocks&quot;.  I was not just blown away by the improved sound, but also the life-like quality of each and every track that I listened to.  The new life that breathed into even the mono tracks was so impressive, I decided to eventually replace the entire Decca collection. Most appreciative, &quot;She's A Rainbow&quot; on &quot;More Hot Rocks&quot; loses the camp introduction that lost its welcome since the &quot;Majesties&quot; disc.
B00006G8G4|4.0|I have great expectataion for Spider-man. Although it did not impressed me, neither I am disappointed. The actions are there. Storylines are there. So what is missing? The special effects! I feel that it is just a bit \\"too computer\\". But overall, it is still consider a nice show. The dvd gift set is very nicely done. Should get if you are not even a fan of spider-man.
0553573403|5.0|In A Game of Thrones, George R.R. Martin has created a masterpiece in fantasy literature.  Martin's epic tale is, without a doubt, the best fantasy series being produced today.  The author has taken a fantastic world and added pure and gritty realism. He digs deeper into the lives of his characters than many authors ever do, revealing the human side of all of them. His use of point of view is remarkable as is the world that he paints for us. His work is monumental in the fact that it revolutionizes fantasy literature.  Martin transforms us from the perfect fantasy world that Tolkien created, into a fresh, new, more real world where no one is really defined as good or evil. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys any sort of fantasy or historical type fiction. It is, put quite simply, amazing.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This animation is very well done! Great graphics, cute characters and nice story plot. The extras in this dvd are very good too. Nice picture and sound quality. This should be in your dvd collection!!!
B000069AUI|5.0|In a recent story in Rolling Stone, Chris Martin has declared a mission to get passionate music back into the mainstream..There are signs that good music is finally getting noticed again, instead of junk like Creed, Uncle Kracker, Kid Rock, etc..I could go on forever. Artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Norah Jones, Dave Matthews Band, Beth Orton, Beck, Ryan Adams and more are in the spotlight..sorta anyway. And then there is Coldplay. The first time I listened to &quot;A rush of blood to the head&quot;, I was floored by the raw passion this guy had in his voice. I felt his emotion almost more than I heard it. Thats what real music does to you. <br />The album starts off with anthem-like politik, and it does not let up at all with the emotion rollercoaster. &quot;In my place&quot;, the &quot;yellow&quot; on this album, is a perfect melody. Then this band starts to experiment with alot of keyboards and piano on &quot;God put a smile on your face&quot; and perhaps the real gem of them all, &quot;Clocks&quot;. The energy and rush of emotion explodes on these songs, even without the exploding guitars that other bands use. &quot;The Scientist&quot; is sadly beautiful, and &quot;Green eyes&quot;, the only acoustic guitar based song on the album, is haunting...There are no duds on this album, and the last half of the album is as good as the first half..&quot;Warning sign&quot; is maybe my favorite on the album, and &quot;Whisper&quot; is energetic. The last two songs on the album the title track and &quot;Amsterdam&quot; are two of the most passionate on the cd. Gorgeous melodies, sad but hopeful lyrics brings this album to the top of my list for the year so far...Maybe its the times, but Coldplay has started something here, and its beautiful...

B00003CXDG|4.0|Unlike te first film, this one is easy to follow, seeing Tom Cruise as an action star is cool, seeing that he doesn't do these kinds of films very much, he almost rivals James Bond to some degree, directed by John Woo, the action set pieces are cool & aplenty as Cruise is hired to go after his former partner,  a former agent for Cruise's organization, played by Dougray Scott(Ever After) who has stolen a Virus & its cure, a virus created by a pharmecutical company that wants to make millions off of research for the virus, Cruise is told to destroy what viruses remain in the company's lab, that has him jumping from a helicopter above the company's skyscraper to enter its tight security's headquaters, but Scott is soon on to him as he tries to mess up Cruise's plan, soon a shootout ensues as Scott verbally assaults Cruise on his intentions & with Cruise soon diving out of the building's interior wall as he escapes by parachute, it seems Scott wants a large percentage of the company's stock in exchange for the virus & cure that he has, by blackmailing the company president, he will be able to control many black markets, but Cruise has to steal the virus, which he does leading to one of the wildest motorcycle chases not seen in a while, the only flaw this movie has are the masks that Scott uses in the form of Cruise, as if he suddenly has them at conveinent times or Cruise who switches identities with one of Scott's stooges in order to steal the virus & cure, ... if you can get past this, than this movie is a fun ride with Ving Rhames returning as Cruise's master hacker, A good action movie that has Woo's signature trademark all over it, & much better than the mess of the first film!
0151008116|4.0|Life of Pi is elegant in the pure simplicity of language and  story.  In this we can find both its flaw and its treasure. Where \\"Jonathon Livingston Seagull\\" and \\"The Little Prince\\" left off, \\"Life of Pi\\" continues.  The story seems to try too hard to leave you with that transcendental, spiritual ephiphany and it often falls short of its goal. The story is typical of the genre, reducing very broad \\"philosophical\\" or \\"political\\" boundaries into extremely pleasant little parables.  It is not a story of a boy and a tiger; but rather, it is an examination of relationships with \\"unrealistic\\" boundary conditions.  Society as a whole has been reduced to it's simplest form: one boat with disparate characters that forces the issue of reconciling typical prejudices and social parameters. <BR>This novel broaches the subject of religion as a very personal experience and if there is one true moral in here it's the acceptance and embracing of culture and all religion.  It may make someone believe in God as it promises, but it doesn't attempt to tell you which one.<BR>In summary: <BR>It's a nice story but don't expect to be changed by it.  <BR>It's a nice story but it's not a literary masterpiece.<BR>It's a nice story that is simple and uncomplicated.<BR>It's a nice story and nothing more.<BR>It's a nice story and I really enjoyed it.
B00005K3LU|5.0|When Released in 1988, no one thought this movie would be a success, after all it was turned down by stars>>Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Richard Gere, Mel Gibson, Sylvester Stallone, & Arnold Scwarzenegger, how could it succeed with Bruce Willis, then a T.V. star,well succeeded it did as Willis brought his own brand of humor & personality to NY cop John McClane who is visiting his wife in L.A. on Christmas Eve in a corporate highrise that is soon taken over by terrorist who are more in the form of theives who want valueable barrier-bonds tucked away in the company's vault, as Willis escapes detection he becomes a one-man force that creates headache for the terrorist leader Hans Gruber played terrificly by Alan Rickman, when police units arrive on the ground in front of the building we see Willis' sarcasm come to life as he not only has to do battle with the terrorist but do battle verbally with the deputy police chief(Paul Gleason) who seems more concerned about the building's damage than the hostages inside, Reginald VelJohnson(T.V.'s Family Matters)provides Willis with emotional support by radio response, this film is well put together as Willis soon discovers that the terrorist are planning on killing the hostages in an attempt to fake their own death in order to get away freely, he is soon confronted by the henchman of Gruber(Alexander Goodonov)in which they fight to the death, soon the F.B.I. arrives & attempts to thwart their plan of escape that backfires in one of the film's best sequences that has Willis jumping 40 stories from an exploding roof after he has dispatched the henchman & gotten the hostages off the roof, with a firehose wrapped around him he makes it to a safe floor, with debree falling all around him, Willis evntually saves the day & is soon out of the building in a satisfying ending, Willis proved he was just more than a T.V. star with this one & has had a successful film career since doing different types of movies, \\"Die Hard\\" spawned rip-offs, but this one still holds up well all these years later.
B000002KBU|3.0|This album is so overrated. This album is actually 2.75 out of 5 not 3. The lyrics are good and I have to say she is a good lyricist. But On This album the lyrical content gets often distracted over Jonis voice which well is terrible. Its not that I haventlistened to worse. But she is so corny. The whole album sounds corny. My sister And I were talking about artists and I named some female artist that were in a magazine. I named Joni Mitchell cause she was one of the higher critically aclaimed female artists... I heard Blue was considered her best and most famous album so I bought a copy. This is indeed very disapointing. This album sounds indeed corny. The music well isnt very much you can say about it cause it isnt very good. The production if any. I think this album was made live in a studio and shows us that this is merealy an unplugged LP. Joni Mithcell is indeed a great lyricist but her voice and the music itself really overshadow the lyrics and make them often vorthless and the songs become very forgettable. O and Did i Mention that like almost every song on this album sounds the same.
B000059Z8J|5.0|For a film made in 1978, this movie looks brand new on DVD, I was really impressed, this is by far the best comic-book adaption ever, director Richard Donner really brought human emotion to th character of Superman, the film begins on Krypton where three villians are cast into space for crimes(villians of \\"Superman II), Marlon Brando stars as Jor-El,a scientist who knows Krypton's fate is at hand, knowing this he dispatches his son to outer space for his journey to earth just before Krypton's destruction, once there his son Ka-el is found by a childless couple who take him as their own, the film the proceeds with Ka-el better known as Clark Kent as a teenager who discovers he has unlimited powers, after his adopted father dies, he is lured into the family barn where a mystical crystal has called to him, a crystal that echoes his roots, he soon leaves & delivers it to an isolated area in an iced region, where it builds his fortress & where he discovers his true identity, the film soon takes us to Metropolis where Kent is a reporter, we soon meet Lex Luthor(Gene Hackman) who has a plan for California that involves earthquakes, a freak accident involving Lois Lane brings out the hero in Clark Kent where Superman is revealed for the first time, aware of his existence Luthor attempts to destroy Superman so he can proceed with his plan, but his plan fails, & soon after Superman is chasing missles that Luthor has rigged to hit California, the missle chase is awesome where you see determination in Reeve's eyes, who does a wonderful job as Superman, the earthquake in California is intense as Superman attempts to stop its destruction, this was a well made film that had a very good sequel & is one of the best DVD's around, with added scenes such as Luthor's lair that Reeve enters, as he tries to take out Superman with machine guns, fire, & snow & ice, which have no effect, a great scene that is somewhat comical, the best Superman period!!!
B000068TSI|5.0|I'm not a veteran -- of any conflict. So I can't say how realistic 'We Were Soldiers' is.  But it was a very emotional experience, and I'm not an emotional sort.  I'm a contemporary of the Vietnam veterans, and this film really drove home the suffering, the fear, the horror many went through on behalf of an indifferent, sometimes hostile nation. The film really attempts to humanize both sides in the battle. This isn't an old 1950's 'fearless Audie Murphy slaughters thousands of the enemy as they charge his position' kind of war movie. Yes, there are lots of gory special effects.  But the real message is 'These were men who did what their country asked of them, despite the risk. These were families who lost loved ones in a war many of us didn't really understand or want to know about'.
0790731940|5.0|When Released in 1994, westerns were in revival, after 1989's \\"Lonsome Dove\\", 1990's \\"Dances With Wolves\\" 1993's \\"Tomstone\\", & 1992's \\"Unforgiven\\", Mel Gibson decided to revive \\"Maverick\\" based on the popular T.V.show, that starred James Garner who passes the torch to Gibson who has a field day as Brett Maverick, Jodie Foster takes over the role of Annabelle, after Julia Roberts for whatever reason dropped out, & pulls it off nicely as Gibson's advesary & later, his lover, it seems Brett is out to collect money for a high-stakes poker game & along the way encounters outlaws, whacked out indians(his friends), & out of control horses on a carriage that he is trying to stop, not to mention Garner & Foster who travel with him, this film doesn't take itself to seriously, which is a treat, even Danny Glover(Gibson's partner in \\"Lethal Weapon\\")makes a cameo appearance who is a bank robber that acts as if he knows Gibson from somewhere, but can't put two & two together, this is just one of the many running gags this movie has, as Gibson has fun in his role as Brett Maverick & him & Garner work well together as if they are father & son, a good western if you don't take to seriously & one of Gibson's best!
0393307050|4.0|I first saw mention of this faux historical series by Patrick O'Brian in the Common Reader catalog. Faux historical? I guess that's what to call it. O'Brian is historically realistic while using entirely fictional main characters, who may meet and interact with real historical figures. This is different from novels such as Robert Graves' I, Claudius or the Alexander novels of Mary Renault. While O'Brian's characters may not have the basis that Graves' or Renault's do, I wonder if he perhaps is the more realistic. This may be because O'Brian has much more historical documentation to work with. We simply know much more about the period of sailing ships and kings than we do about triremes and emperors. Graves' Claudius, although a reed in the wind of Roman politics, is still a very heroic figure; O'Brian's Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, although heroic, seem much more like real people. This is the opening book in the series (the sixteenth, The Wine-Dark Sea, just came out in hardcover) and sets the characters and stage. The title refers to Jack Aubrey, who is named Master and Commander (a step below Captain, yet in charge of a single ship) of the sloop Sophie as the story opens. Aubrey has a few character flaws, including being hot-headed and slightly indiscrete, and this has made for him a few enemies. The other main character is Stephen Maturin, who becomes the Sophie's ship surgeon, even though he is over-qualified for the job (as he is an actual doctor, and most ship surgeons of the time weren't). He shares with Aubrey some basic characteristics--a sense of honor, a love of fine food and music, and a real need for money. Maturin also has a past that, like Aubrey's, contributes a few enemies as well. But the character stuff, as good as it is and necessary to make this book work, is just icing on the cake. The fun here, and what got me interested in it when it recently became a topic of discussion on rec.arts.books, is the sea. The description of life aboard and off ship, in a land filled with merchantmen and warships, where loyalty to country is primary, but taking a heavy prize can make your name, the strategy of sea battles and the lonliness of like aboard ship. I've always been a sucker for pirate stories, and this is just the more honor-filled side. Needless to say, I expect I'll be reading the next fifteen books in the series and looking forward to O'Brian writing even more (I wrote this originally back in 1993; O'Brian wrote four more in this series before his death).f ship, in a land filled with merchantmen and warships, where loyalty to country is primary, but taking a heavy prize can make your name, the strategy of sea battles and the lonliness of like aboard ship.

B00003CX5P|5.0|Of all the DVD's I have seen, this one is the best, can't wait for EP II, This is the beginning of what we know as \\"Star Wars\\", although it falls a little short of 1977's \\"A New Hope\\", it definately delivers the goods, In this one we meet Obi-Wan Kenobi as a young Jedi under the guidance of Qui-Gon Jinn, a Master Jedi as they are dispatched to Naboo to end a conflict between the Trade Federation's shipping of goods to Naboo, what we learn is that the Trade Federation's commander's are being manipulated by Darth Sidious, a mysterious cloaked figure, as Qui-Gon & Obi-Wan arrive to settle the conflict, they are soon in a fight for their lives as an invasion is soon underway on Naboo, when their cruiser is destroyed, they hitch a ride to Naboo to warn the people, here we meet Queen Amidala as she & others are soon captured in an attempt to get her to sign a treaty which will put in motion a separist movement we know in Ep II, she & the ohers are soon rescued by Qui-Gon & Obi-Wan who then flee Naboo in her Royal Cruiser only to have it damaged in battle with the Trade Federation, once free, they land on Tattoonie, a nearby planet, for repairs, it is here they meet young Anakin Skywalker who has a special gift with the force, that Qui-Gon soon takes an interest in, but Anakin is a slave to Watto who Qui-Gon needs parts from, & uses a Jedi-mind trick that has no effect on Watto, with a pod-race looming, Qui-Gon cuts a deal with Watto to win not only his parts but to free Anakin, if Anakin can win the race, that is Nascar on steroids, the pod race is awesome as ILM works its magic here, Anakin wins & is freed to go with Qui-Gon, it seems Anakin wants desperately to be a Jedi, but Sidious has dispatched his apprentice Darth Maul(a demon-like Sith) to destroy the Jedi & get the Queen, Maul suddenly attacks Qui-Gon in a teaser of things to come, Qui-Gon escapes & they arrive at Courasaunt, the galaxy's Republic  Headquaters, once there we meet Senator Palpatine who wants to oust Chancellor Valorum(Terence Stamp) so he can be Chancellor, we see Palpatine's manipulation in full swing as he sets his utimate plan for the \\"Empire\\" in motion, the Republic itself is losing it's democracy, we meet Yoda who suggest Anakin's training should be in question, given Anakin's emotion, Valorum is ousted as Palpatine takes over claiming he will bring democracy back, Qui-Gon & Obi-Wan are then told to escort Queen Amidala back to Naboo to take back the planet that is now under control of the Federation, once they do, a stand-off ensues as the Queen & her security fend off the Federation's battle droids, while Qui-Gon & Obi-Wan are confronted by Darth Maul, in a two-against-one face off, which is spectacular to watch, Maul manages to seperate the two, & soon cuts down Qui-Gon, putting Obi-Wan in vengence mode, as Obi-Wan charges Maul in a fierce lightsaber battle which Obi-Wan wins by pulling the element of surprise, afterwards we see Obi-Wan vowing to train Anakin as a Jedi since it was Qui-Gon's dying wish, Yoda reluctantly agrees despite his bad feeling about it, the ending is somewhat on a happy note, but you know Palpatine's true intension, many didn't like this one, although it may be aimed a kids, \\"A New Hope\\" was too, this one shows more of the political strategy that eventually birthed the \\"Empire\\" & began Anakin as a Jedi in the making, like Lucas said>\\"you have to start somewhere\\", & Obi-Wan comes into his own at the end, as for Jar Jar Binks, he did not annoy me that much, I don't hate any character that can make me laugh, & Jar Jar made me laugh, the Ewoks annoyed me in \\"Return of the Jedi\\", Lucas dropped the ball with ROTJ, not TPM, I liked this one & was not disappointed one bit with it, my only complaint was that we did not see more of Maul, but as Lucas said> \\"It is not about him\\", other than that, TPM is good movie, not as good as \\"A New Hope\\" or \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", but way better than \\"Return of the Jedi\\" I think!!!,& is right upthere with \\"Attack of the Clones!!!
B00005R23X|4.0|Updated for Blu-ray Review: 11/10<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition of \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" unlike the Superbit or regular DVD editions does not have the color or contrast boosted. That's a bad and good thing for this stylized looking film; Coppola meant the film to have a slightly washed out, dark look to the film trying to echo early color 2 strip Technicolor films of the 1920's and 30's. The presentation of the film these issues aside IS as Coppola intended BUT fans who grew up watching this on home video or DVD will probably dislike the presentation here (as many fans disliked the grainy presentation of the Blu-ray restoration for \\"The Godfather\\"). This isn't a huge improvement over the DVD based on the presentation here. My advice--if you want to buy this rent first and see if the visual presentation appeals to you.<br />***<br /><br />Writer James V. Hart's adaption of Dracula is unique; Hart and director Franics Ford Coppola combine legend and novel to create a visually striking tour de force. There are a number witty visual references to silent movies (particularly previous adaptions from 1929's Nosferatu to Hammer's Horror of Dracula)and the visual effects are quite stunning. The effects themselves borrow liberally from older film and stage techniques. They prove just as striking and effective as any CGI images that could have been used.<br /><br />The literate script is more faithful to Stoker's novel than previous adaptions but there's still a considerable amount of liberaties taken with it. Calling this Stoker's Dracula is being generous;Coppola transforms anything he adapts and this is very much Coppola's Dracula.<br /><br />The acting and casting is more problematic. The most glaring problem is Keanu Reeves as Harker. Yes, I realize that Reeves' wooden acting style is deliberate. It's a stylized reference to the acting of the 20's and 30's. Unfortunately, given the other performances, it doesn't work. Anthony Hopkins manages to chew just about every bit of scenery in sight. Still, he's an effective Van Helsing. He plays Van Helsing with as obsessed bordering on madness. It works within the context of the film and is a fine contrast to Gary Oldman's fine performance as Dracula. Cary Elwes and Bill Campbell round out a fine cast of performers (although I personally would have loved seeing the versatile Elwes play Campbell's role). Tom Waits makes the role of Renfield his own. Waits' take on Renfield is the strongest since Dwight Frye's in the 1931 Todd Browning version of Dracula.<br /><br />The romantic element of the film is completely screenwriter James Hart's invention. It's a surprise and makes this something more than a run of the mill vampire movie. His script breathes life into a moribound subject that's been done to death. Coppola and his collaborator Hart have invented a tragic gothic Dracula mixing gore with the sensibility of a romance novel.<br /><br />The film is well staged and the action sequences have a kinetic energy that only a thoughtful director like Copppola could create. The cinematography veers from beautiful to eerie within the same sequence. Coppola's Dracula takes the vestiage of Greek tragedy and grafts it to the horror film in a way that makes this a fresh and vital film.n effective Van Helsing.

B00004TDRD|3.0|This is one of my favorite movies, but I'm rating it as a horror film. It was scary when it came out, the reason it isn't scary now, is because that the special effects for the shark are really bad! This needs a remake! Parts that could have been scary made me laugh because of the special effects.
B00005NWM3|4.0|As I might have said before, or not I have been into nickelback for quite awile now, around when the state was out. But one thing I feel I need to stress here is that some poeple on this site have the strongest habit of beeing way to overdramatic when it come's to reviewing CD's, talking like this is the most horrible peice of music since god only know's what. But it's not, infact it's pretty good. No, nickelback are not to origanal, nor that groundbreaking. Yep, nickelback are about as basic as your going to get, whitch is not a bad thing. Either you have people who hate this band, or you have people who love this band.Well, let's just get to the CD. Most of this album is just a good solid rock album, with plenty of rocking tunes. Infact the only songs on here or song on here that is really that poprock is how you remind me, and even that has it's dark edge to it. But the only down side to this is that it does follow the same formula with every song basicly, yet still mamages to keep the groove. Songs like woke up this morning, just for, money bought, where do I hide, and good times gone are great rock songs. With crunchy guitars, throbbing bass, pounding drums, and rahspy vocals with plenty of rythim. So, instead of letting all of these negative reviews blow you off, go out and judge for yourself. Might like it, might not, but give it a chance.
0684800713|5.0|Reading through previous reviews prompted me to write this one because I didn't find one that really understood The Sun Also Rises. Many reviewers saw only the surface of this great work and called it tedious and unworhtwhile. Others loved the book for the interesting characters. But not many probed the heart of the classic.<br />This is a book about finding meaning in the world. Jake is very much like Hemingway himself. He went off to the war thinking of glory and heroics and saw only death, and horrible death at that. His illusions are shattered, the notion of life in an ordered, coherent universe gone. They see that life is random, chaotic, without meaning. How does one live in a world like this? That was the question central to Hemingway's entire life, and it's central to this book as well.<br />Hemingway answers the question through the famous \\"Hemingway Code\\" that one can glean from his novels and short stories. Characters that stick to this code are heroic in his eyes. I won't detail the code here because it will ruin the pleasure of discovering it for yourself, but let's just say that the purest Hemingway Hero in this novel is Romero, the bullfighter. Characters like Robert Cohn and Mike are not Hemingway Heroes.<br />One reviewer wrote that he couldn't see how one could read the book and not come away longing for Lady Brett. This guy must have been reading a completely different book than what I read. Brett is like Circe; her job is to turn men into swine, as seen in several key scenes in the novel, including a festival scene. Or, to use a key metaphor from the book, she's like a bullfighter, twirling her skirt (instead of a cape) to lure the bullish men toward her, spinning around when they get too close, and finally driving a blade into their hearts. <br />This novel has nothing to do with surface events of the novel. Hemingway's style is like an iceberb; 90 percent of the thing is below the surface. This is a novel that has to be read slowly, introspectively, and with great care. Tune your ear to hear Hemingway, for his voice is one of the most subtle, but most powerful, in the history of literature.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|Forget those garbage sequels that don't have a plot, well this one doesn't have much a plot, but it's definitely worthy. Wesley Snipes returns as the half-vampire, half-human Blade. He joins his rival vampires to exterminate these bald creatures with bigger mouths than Steven Tyler. This is an extremely gruesome movie that actually surpasses its predecessor. I was happy that the mashed potato boy didn't appear in this one. Mashed potatoes are meant for Thanksgiving, not a gross out factor. Tons of action, thrilling moments and a tight soundtrack. You should know that bald people don't belong in the sun and in this movie you'll see why. Besides the glare, it could get ugly!
6304493681|5.0|I have been a big Anime fan for about 4 years now. I have had &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; for about 3 years. I have NEVER come across any Anime more extraordinary than this. It's bold, truthful and challenging. The animation is the best quality that you'll ever find. When you watch it, pay close attention to when Kusanagi is talking to Bateau on the boat. If you don't get all of it the first time, rewind it. Is this movie basically about Section 9 (a security force) hunting down the ultimate computer-criminal known as the Puppet Master? NO. There is much more. Conspiracies, cyborgs and artificial intelligence being more than the real thing... It is a world were only the Ghost - the indefinable element of human consciousness - exists to determine who is truly alive and who is purely a creation of the Net. Kusanagi is caught right in the middle of everything, but she's not by herself...someone or something has taken a special interest in her alone.<br />Don't waste your time renting it. Go ahead and buy it. &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; will shock and amaze you. It is an intelligent movie aimed at an intelligent audience.
B000050FEN|4.0|&quot;Seven&quot; carries a dark foreshadowing throughout the whole movie and the ending will leave you shocked. Does this movie take place in Seattle? The gloomy weather provides a morbid atmosphere for a killer who eliminates victims by the seven deadly sins. He has no identity. It might as well be a fallen angel. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are the detectives on his trail and deal with the aftermath of mutilated sins. The glutton guy was plain vile and I lost my appetite forever! Man, even the guy that was strapped to his bed for over a year gave me nightmares for years. This is Brad Pitt's best movie and a great debut for David Fincher. Definitely a classic.
B000006NPY|4.0|After living with this album since day 1 of it's release, I find myself still a bit confused by it. There are amazing songs on here such as \\"to sheila\\", \\"pug\\", \\"tear\\" and \\"blank page\\" and the album is worth owning because of \\"for martha\\" alone. The line \\"long horses we are born - creatures more than torn - mourning our way home\\" still chokes me up the same way it did the first time I heard it. \\"annie-dog\\" is a bit monotonous, but Billy Corgan's cracked and weary vocals redeem it because it was the first time I was truly impressed by his voice. It is absolutely beautiful. Most of these songs are much moodier and beautiful without being stupid. <br />I just can't get past the monotony of \\"once upon a time\\", and \\"perfect\\" seems more of a novelty song than something with the integrity that has been dripping from their other efforts. <br />I have found that an alternative tracklisting would have sufficed and why they kept \\"blissed and gone\\" (outtake) from this album, still makes me wonder. It would have ended the album with me begging for more and thanking them for not one, but two masterpieces (Siamese Dream being the other).<br />I think Adore is an important album for The Smashing Pumpkins. It was completely different from anything before, it still stands up on it's own and they were testing themselves, not repeating.
038533348X|5.0|I was told to read this over summer for an Advanced Placement high school course, and got a great surprise. I could talk about social satire and other philosophical, metaphoric ideas, but nobody cares. Everybody gets something different out of Kurt Vonnegut, and frankly, all you need to know is that this is an easy, great read. Don't be frightened off by Vonnegut's reputation, give Cat's Cradle a shot.  The book is just plain excellent.
B000002I27|5.0|The songs on this album were written around the same time as their marvelous debut. It has the same aura as their debut but it's also different. It starts off with the ominous title track, then goes into blues-rock like \\"You're Lost Little Girl,\\" and the rock radio staple \\"Love Me Two Times,\\" penned by Robby Krieger, THE most underrated guitarist in history. It contains uptempo songs like \\"Unhappy Girl,\\" \\"My Eyes Have Seen You,\\" and \\"People Are Strange.\\"<BR><BR>Moments of this album fit the title of the record, Strange Days. \\"Horse Latitudes,\\" is a Morrison poem with him wailing about.. God knows what. \\"I Can't See Your Face In My Mind,\\" has a marimba and a weird keyboard effect, adding to the isolated lyrics of Morrison and his passionate baritone.<BR><BR>Then the last track, When The Music's Over, is known to some as \\"The End Part Two,\\" following the same paradigm - verse, chorus, poetic and musical improvisation, the focal point and the finale. It's 11-minutes of some of Morrison's best poetry, a bassline similar to \\"soul kitchen,\\" and the battle cry \\"WE WANT THE WORLD AND WE WANT IT NOW!!!!\\"  I can't decide which one is better, but the Doors certainly closed off this album on a spectacular note. An often overlooked classic, usually in the shadow of their debut.
B00006IX0R|4.0|This is a great CD A must have for any Cran fan. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the editing they did on some of the songs(Dreams Promises Hollywood Free to Decide). I felt it just took away from those songs. Other than that, I'm glad I bought the CD. It's worth every penny. I can't wait till the next CD comes out. Rock on Cranberries, you guys are the best.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I have not been a fan of Beck's previous work, but I picked this CD up after reading several reviews.  Quite simply, it's stunning and beautiful.  Funny, but I found it to NOT be depressing at all.  It's music that makes you feel.  Good, bad, whatever... actually FEELING something is a good thing, is it not?
B00006DEFA|5.0|Although some of the added footage is superfluous, the extra scences of Elizabeth Berridge are a godsend. Her character comes off as much richer and intriguing in this edition.<br />The secong disk is a bit disappointing. The actors today talk about their experiences in the making of the movie. NOBODY has aged well.
B00005JLCE|5.0|Yes it's true ... I am an Older Dude ... but that don't matter ... what matters is, I used to be judgemental on Madonna, who, I find, at the very LEAST, has some, at the LEAST, *good* reasons for being who she is  :))  Indeed, I found my own jealously of her only contributed to my past judgementality of her.  The bottom line is this:  I have come to see WHO's THAT GIRL (Old Dude as I am, believe it or not !!) as the funny, cool movie it is -- good for Old Dudes and Young Ones to enjoy together !!  You Go, Madonna -- and thanks for this and other great films starring you !!  As to other Older Dudes, come on, let's drop our judgemental selves, and see Madonna and Ladies like her for the \\"good Joes\\" they *are* !!
0553573403|5.0|George R. R. Martin writes from the point of view of multiple characters in this amazingly wonderful fantasy book. An intricate plot and fascinating characters are portrayed across a well-developed world. GRRM's writing includes the outcasts that bring gritty realism to his story: bastards, cowards, a dwarf, and criminals. There are no solely \\"good\\" characters; even the extremely honorable Lord Stark of Winterfell has a bastard son, and the king himself is surrounded by plots and conspiracies that threaten to control him, or perhaps even kill him.<br />This book has violence, sex, love, betrayal, and death. GRRM writes a world beyond imaging, though it's only barely fantasy. It's definitely not full of fairies and unicorns and happy perfection. This is an excellent book, and I recommend it VERY highly.
B00005RFAI|4.0|im not a big pink fan. i dont have her first album nor do i want it nd didnt really want to own this own either. but that was before i borrowed this from a friend. why i borrowed it i have no idea but im glad i did. at first when pink's first single get the party started came out i didnt really like it. i couldnt relate to it. then came dont let me get me and just like a pill. that i could i relate to because the lyrics were so heartfelt. dont let me get me was exactly how i was feeling at the time the single came out. i could agree with pink when she said she wanted to be someday else becuz thats how i feel too. i could relate to just like a pill..but not at the time..i liked the song though nd the lyrics were pretty catchy. then i got hurt very close to my heart nd i saw the lyrics in a whole new way. that song was the only song i played for days. so i borrowed the album from my friend and really listened to it. its been in my cd player ever since.<BR>1-Missundaztood-good easily likable song somewhat catchy<BR>2-dont let me get me- beautiful loved it very catchy you could relate to it<BR>3-just like a pill- amazing vocals you could relate to it easily if u've ever had ur heart broken or some1 close to you hurting you very catchy the lyrics stay with you<BR>4-get the party started-a party song okay not bad won 2 mtv awards<BR>5-respect-its okay didnt really like it though<BR>6-18 wheeler-sounds a little bit like christina aguileras fighter its good the chorus is good<BR>7-family portrait-amazing loved it good song especially if ur parents divorced could relate to it<BR>8-misery-its okay not my favorite<BR>9-dear diary-britney spears had a song called dear diary her version [stinks]though pinks is beautiful its not about anything in particular but its a very moving song<BR>10-eventually-okay not my favorite either <BR>11-lonely girl-beautiful amazing vocals loved it favorite song<BR>12-numb-okay song expected it'd be a little more moving not that bad though<BR>13-gone to california-hate it-dont like it its okay but i cant listen to this song at all<BR>14-my vietnam-beautiful great vocals very good song
B00003CXAE|1.0|I was very disappointed in the process used to transfer to DVD.  The print that was transferred to the DVD appears to be somewhat faded and dirty.  However I was most disappointed with how grainy the movie is, I have seen movies that twice as old and older that had better transfers.  One other note; for some reason in all of the shots that were in the soda shop they having digitally blurred out the Coca-Cola logo in signs and menu boards.  This is distracting!

B000002H97|2.0|I've been a Metallica fan since \\"Ride the Lightning\\",and compared to what was out musically at that time (namely hair rock, such as Motley Crue), Metallica was far and away the best thing going.  Metallica was not about catchy tunes that were over produced, like all the other hair and make up rock garbage that was out at the time.  They became popular without much radio play, and only one video.  So why in the world did they hire Bob Rock, who produced the likes of Motley Crue, to produce the Black album?  Metallica used to be against that kind of glam sound, but after listening to this album, it appears Metallica went for the money, and no longer cares about what they once stood for.  The songs on the album are OK, but not by Metallica standards.  They abandoned their hardcore sound for an overproduced, cleaner, more accessible sound, that disappointed virtually every true Metallica that supported them prior to this album.  In summary, not a bad album, but if you want to truly experience Metallica, get \\"Kill 'em All\\", \\"Ride the Lightning\\", \\"Master of Puppets\\", or \\"...And Justice For All\\", and nothing beyond.
0553260111|5.0|The Bourne Identity, the first in a series of three Bourne books, is one of the best books I've ever read.  I simply could not put this book down.  If you like Clancy, but wish he didn't drag on at times, you'll love Bourne.  Bourne is always on the move, discovering more and more about who he is and what he's capable of.  This book is action packed, but don't expect complex plot twists or the character developement of Literature.  This is spy fiction at its best!

6304493681|5.0|This is a great anime dealing with many transhuman questions, such as what is human, and what is life. How and when do we become human, or beyond human. Why should we try to evolve? What is life, its components and unity, and relationship to each other, and all else? These questions are set up for you to explore throughout this action sci fi film. Lots of blood, violence, and chases are interrupted with the discussions of the main characters, reacting to their current case dealing with a hacker taking over peoples souls. These people can be hacked because they are all connected in their brains to the net, where information thrives. Who is this mysterious hacker and what does he want? At the end he gives an interesting proposal, ask yourself if you would take it. 5 stars, highly recommended.
B00006BIO0|5.0|Charley Patton has always been difficult to listen to because the sound quality of the surviving copies of his recordings is so poor. JSP records, famous for its faithful and clear remasterings, has done a fine job of bringing the music out from the static, scratches, and so on, without altering or diminishing it. And the price is remarkable, too.
B00006AFUR|5.0|This self-titled release from 30 Seconds To Mars is one of the most surprising albums of the year. With the recent flood of actors and actresses thinking they can be good at singing as well as acting, Jarred Leto is one person who actually CAN do both. This CD has amazing guitar riffs, cool lyrics, and awesome electronic noises. If Maynard Keenan from Tool and Wayne Static from(you guessed it) Static X had their DNA spliced, I think the product would very much resemble Leto. The album's lyrics make the listener want to stand up and revolt against something, and the great bass and guitar riffs provide the energy to do so. In general, this album is one of the best debuts of the year. I hope to hear more of the same from this band in the future.
B00003CY6M|4.0|Alright, we all know that nuthing like what happens in the show will ever happen in our lives, but nevertheless just imagine for a moment that it could...<BR>The show is basically about fate and destiny, both taken to the extremes. Guy meets girl whom he's never met b4 while christmas shopping, and within 5 minutes they've fallen in love. Though the plot might seem cheeesy and fluffy, the many pictureperfect romance scenes (i.e. rollerskating under a starry night together)makes you think....&quot;whao..i would give anything to experience a moment like that&quot;, and makes you wonder about your own fate and destiny.<BR>The best way to enjoy this show is not to be critical about the unrealness of the show but to just sit back, relax, and be taken on a beautiful ride of romance and fate, not to mention the soothing soundtrack of the film.<BR>John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale have a wonderful chemistry together on set and i would recommend Serendipity to all Romantic/feelgood buffs (such as myself) or anyone looking for the perfect date movie.
B00006DEF9|5.0|The 2 documentaries on the supplementary 2nd DVD are both excellect. &quot;What a Glorious Feeling&quot; (30 min.) has great interviews with Cyd Charisse, Donald O'Connor, Betty Comden &amp; Adolph Green and Kathleen Freeman (Lina's voice coach). These are interspersed with great clips illustrating the comments. Former is hosted by Debbie Reynold. &quot;Movies Great Movies&quot; (86 min.)is even better. A pretty comprehensive summary of the Freed Unit at MGM. These include interviews with Saul Chaplin, Michael Kidd, Cyd Charisse, Comden &amp; Green, Freed's daughter, Andre Previn, many more. This has longer many more complete clips from the films. An excellent demonstration of how they filmed the dancing on the ceiling sequence danced by Astaire in &quot;Royal Wedding&quot;. On that second DVD there are also original studio recordings including alternate takes and extended musical sequences from the Broadway Ballet. I haven't listened to the film commentary yet. This DVD set is a great value. The film itself looks fantastic. The image is almost 3 dimensional.<br />The sound has been remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 and has a pleasant spaciousness. The original mono track is there too. Now it sounds kind of flat.
B0000636UN|4.0|While this is not the best of her four albums, I still really enjoyed it.  You can tell she has changed over the past few years because her lyrics and music reflect a less angry, agressive persona, and a more subdued reflective side of herself.  Personally, I like the angrier, more defiant Sheryl, which is why I only gave this album 4 starts.<br />But don't get me wrong, there is a lot a good material here.  And I still think this album and Sheryl are a cut above most of the other drivel that's out there right now (most of which I can barely stand to listen to).  While I'm not too high on &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot;, I do enjoy listening to &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; and most of the other tunes.<br />Still worth the bucks.  I wasn't that disappointed.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Where do I begin? This movie simply flatout [super]!! I have loved Spiderman since I first discovered him through th cartoon series of the late 70s/early 80s. I don't recall everything about it, but I do remember that I wanted to be Spiderman. <br />This movie does a great job of transporting me back to that time in my youth. The attention to detail in the special effects and the overall appearence of this movie is amazing. The characters are dynamic and interesting. There isn't a single lull point in this movie. The action is fast paced, well done and exciting. The film really makes you feel as if you were there with Peter Parker. Willam Defoe is perfect as the Green Goblin .... <br />This movie has it all. Action, love, good vs evil and a plot!! When I left the theater I felt like I could do that. I wanted to do that. It was fun! I can't wait for this dvd to come out so I can experience it all over again and check out all the amazing extras. <br />This movie probably won't win the Oscar for movie of the year, but it should. Buy it and see why!!!
B000002NHN|4.0|This is a great first CD to introduce you to Loreena McKennitt.  Loreena McKennitt's voice is beautiful and given songs to sing that show it's range and beauty very well.  This one is worth buying.
B0000640VN|4.0|until I saw Jackman as LEOPOLD and the wheels started to turn. I haven't been this excited about a new star since Sean Connery. (Yes, I'm that old.)... <br />Regarding KATE & LEOPOLD (and I speak as one who has loved Meg Ryan movies in the past, especially FRENCH KISS, YOU'VE GOT MAIL, and CITY OF ANGELS, which has a similar fantasy element about love overcoming obstacles and about making leaps of faith)I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. But she seems so sad (which fits her character)...<br />KATE & LEOPOLD often reminds me of EVER AFTER --only it's a Duke instead of a Prince being forced into a loveless marriage, looking for a woman of intelligence and independence. The Prince finds her among the common people. The Duke finds Kate in the future. <br />Like the characters Kate and Leopold, we are asked by this movie to suspend disbelief and to make a leap of faith. I find that I can. The haunting STING song UNTIL is a great bonus.
0395873460|5.0|Whereas other reviews have focused on Tolkien's excellent story, I want to recommend Alan Lee's fantastic illustrations. Lee was one of two Tolkien illustrators called by Peter Jackson for the making of the trilogy film, The Lord of the Rings. His brilliance shines through in the recreation of Rivendell and the warm feel of Hobbiton. As a life-long fan of the Lord of the Rings, I have never been disappointed by Lee's interpretation of a scene or character. His artistic skill hits the mark dead center every time on every concept. In fact, his is one artist of a few (if not the only one) who are officially recognized by Tolkien's estate as a bard of Middle Earth. Therefore, the illustrations in this beautiful edition of a great book by the 20th century's best author are bound to appeal to you as you read it. In this book, the arguing trolls are just as I've imagined them, and the dwarves are like real people, not plump bodies with noses the size of their heads. The eagles, too, are glorious. I heartily recommend this edition of Tolkien's wonderful fantasy!
B00005QZ7U|4.0|When I rented this movie, I kept in mind what others had said about it: that you either love it. Or you hate it. When I began watching it with my parents, they both left near the beginning of it, claiming that it was \\"too weird\\". And I admit, it is strange. It is set in the 1900's yet the songs are mainly modern pop music (i.e - Nirvana \\"Smells like Teen Spirit). And, plus, the beginning is like a total drug trip. But I stayed and finished watching and, and I must say, I am glad that I did. The love story is incredibly beautiful (read: tragic); and Ewan was perfect. I don't care for Nicole Kidman as a rule, but her acting was good as Satine. As the movie progresses, her character grows as Christian and Satine's love grows. I think Directer-man Baz has got the whole forbidden-love scenario down pat. Anyways, I think the bottom line for this movie is: just give it a chance. Some parts are just too amazing to miss. It's just so passionate! I gave Moulin Rouge four stars because it was a tragedy, and I'm more of a happy-ending kind of girl.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Apocalypse now is of course loosely based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. The main twist is that this one is set in Vietnam not the congo river.  However, don't be fooled.  This movie is just as creepy as the book.  Furthermore the dialogue is astounding and is very successful in exploring the atavistic tendancies of man that was a part of not only Conrad's work but the Vietnam War as well.  Sheen puts in a great performance as do Harrison Ford and Dennis Hopper in supporting rolls.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis 30#1 hits are a must buy for all elvis fans and for those wanting to know more about elvis. By hearing this cd you will know why elvis was known and still is the king of rock &amp; roll. 50,000,000 fans can't be wrong about this album.
B00003CXAE|4.0|Grease is an interesting thing. It's one of those movies that stays with you and goes wherever you go. Watching it again or hearing any of the songs on the radio is like opening up your own high school yearbook. A trip back through time. A reunion with friends you feel like you know, or could have known. It's a special thing indeed. The movie, as I'm sure everyone knows, was based on a musical. It was made into this film and was released in 1978. The movie became the highest grossing musical in box office history. Rightfully so. The movies takes place in California in the 1950's. Just as Amazon said, this nostalgia was running rampant in the 1970's. We first meet Danny Zuko and Sandy(John Travolta and Olivia Newton - John) having a romantic time on the beach. It all seemed so perfect. We jump right to the beginning of a new school year. Students are coming to Rydell High for the first day of school. Young, beautiful Sandy is coming for the first time. She immediatley meets and befriends pink haired Frenchie(Didi Conn), and her clique of friends known as the Pink Ladies, headed by Rizzo(Stockard Channing). Rizzo is a tough, feisty thing, and Channing gives the role her all in a great and memorable performance. Sandy runs into her summer love, Danny. Danny is the leader of the cool gang in school known as The T Birds. The rest of the movie is pretty much the love and attraction between the two and how Danny tries to regain his cool and not seem like a whipped, lovestruck little puppy. What makes the movie great and undeniably cool and enjoyable is how it is shamelessly great, cool, and enjoyable. Does that make any sense?. It's a bright, colorful, popcorn movie that wants nothing but to be a good, fun movie. It achieves that goal on every level. While the movie is looked on quite fondly by people and lots of younger kids as a nice movie, you really have to look deeper and pay more attention to certain dialogue and lyrics to see how the movie was actually kinda nasty in some ways. I'm sure there are things that would get edited out if I printed them, so I won't. Be on the lookout if you haven't noticed it already. The supporting cast is chock full of memorable faces. Comedy legend Sid Caesar is the gym teacher; Eve Arden is the principal; Lorenzo Lamas is the jock; Eternal nerd Eddie Deezen as, well, the nerd. And, of course, the cameo by Frankie Avalon. The music. I've saved the best for last. The music in this film is pure kitsch, but a lot of it is actually solid songs. With a movie this campy and fun, you can't really expect the songs to be different. It's just that kind of a movie. Olivia Newton - John could sing from the telephone book and I wouldn't care. She has such a lovely, warm, and beautiful voice, she make anything sound good. Who can deny the pleasures of \\"Greased Lightning\\", \\"Hopelessly Devoted To You\\", \\"Your The One That I Want\\", \\"Summer Lovin\\", and, of course, \\"Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee\\"?. Pure pop done at it's very best. The writing is corny and sometimes cheesey, but guess what?. That's the movie. That's the era it's in. It isn't meant to be anything else. It is what it is supposed to be, and does it very well. The actors are all great. All well suited for their roles. Was John Travolta any cooler?. Olivia is a sight of pure loveliness. If you ask me, she looks even better today at the age of 54. Just gets better with age. Grease isn't a film that is going to be seen as Oscar material(the songs yes), and it wasn't meant to be. It has survived for the last 24 years because it's a good movie that can reach anyone in any age group or race. It's a film that takes place in a certain time, but the legacy will live on for all times. Grease is the word.

0440178002|4.0|Shogun was long and complex and utterly beautiful, an evocative narrative of 16th century Japanese culture.  Blackthorne, the brave but vulgar English pilot who rises to hatamoto status of the venerable Toranaga--Mariko, gentle externally but internally steel.  All the clean lovely complexities of Japanese culture that almost justify even the most brutal happenings.
B00006IX0R|5.0|This is a really good cd and anyone who is a Cranberries fan will like this. It has all my favorite singles on it and does have some cut's like on the last part of &quot;Dreams&quot; when Dolores does her yodelling at the end. But I think this cd has a better sound quality on it. &quot;Stars&quot; their current really brings me back to &quot;Dreams&quot; and I like that. &quot;New New York&quot; is a new sound for them and I love it. On their next cd you'll hear more songs like &quot;New New York&quot; it's their new sound. Well buy it, it's really good.
B000000OAH|5.0|Freddie Mercury's work on this album is stunning.  &quot;Bicycle Race&quot; is one of the greatest rock songs ever written.  Simple, and yet amazingly complex at the same time.  &quot;Mustapha&quot;, &quot;Don't Stop Me Now&quot;, &quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot;, and &quot;Jealousy&quot; are all superb rock songs that are worth anyone's listen.<br />Brian May serves up excellent songs on this album.  From the chauvinist &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot; to the care-free &quot;Dreamer's Ball&quot;, May provides great guitar arrangements and solid song structures.<br />As for the contributions from Roger Taylor and John Deacon, they are well done.  &quot;More of that Jazz&quot; (written and sung by Mr. Taylor) makes for a splendid finish to a fine album.  Check out those vocals!
0446530573|4.0|The recipies in this cookbook/Sopranos storybook are fabulous, and the extra Sopranos material is really fun to read. There are photos, stories, &quot;interviews&quot; with characters, family backgrounds, and many other items that make this book a must-have for any Sopranos fan.<br />The real stars of the book, though, are of course the recipies; everything from Carmella's baked ziti (a snap to make!) to recipies from Artie's own kitchen. Each character has his or her own chapter, and different kinds of food within it. Tony, naturally, has the chapter on grilling. [grin]<br />A really fantastic addition to any kitchen or bookshelf - enjoy, and buon appetito!
0451527712|4.0|A tragic emotional Gothic tale of the classic mad scientist and the unnatural grotesque outcast.  I feel contemptuous of Victor and extremely pitious of the monster.  Poor soul, abhorred by all, including God (as Victor is his God).  Some major themes in this book are Divine Nature, Passive weak women, and perhaps abortion.  I see why it's a classic.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Nothing like The SFA Rings album (buiy that too)  but already one of the great all time albums. Like Gram Parsons, Gene Clark. Moody and so beautiful! The string arrangements on track two...WOW.  Probably won't get much radio play from boring stations but who cars. BUY IT..BUY IT don't steal it online somewhere. Support artists who take chances and write and record wonderful music!..<br />Beck always does something different like the Beatles did. He doesn't just repeat successul formulas!
B00006DEFA|4.0|Difficult to say, actually.  Some scenes have been fleshed out, some with minor additional dialogue and some with lengthy additions.  But for those of us who have seen the film repeatedly over the years and know the film's tempo rather intimately, the additional scenes disrupt the pacing more than they contribute to the story.<br />Viewers might have been better served by having the addional footage relegated to the Bonus Features section rather than spliced into the film.  Or, better yet, the makers of this DVD could have offered two playback options - original version AND Director's Cut.  Other movies on DVD have integrated that option seamlessly.  David Cronenberg's film &quot;Crash&quot; comes to mind.  On that DVD you can opt for either the R rated version or the NC-17 version, and the DVD player plays or skips the chosen footage.  That would have been my preference for this &quot;Amadeus&quot; Director's Cut.<br />But what do we get with this new footage?  Insight into Constanze's dislike of Salieri at the film's end (courtesy of a brief bit of nudity on Elizabeth Berridge's part that seems gratuitous now), an extension of the scene in which Christine Ebersole's character discovers that Mozart is two-timing her, snippets of addtional dialogue between the aged Salieri and the young priest, a middle-act bookend sequence about Mozart's attempts to hire himself out as a music tutor to the daughter of actor Kenneth McMillan's character [surely McMillan would have been pleased to see his role restored in a Best Picture winner], and a few assorted other scenes/lines that clarify a few points here and there.  The best and most interesting addition to me, however, was a rather ominous line reading by F. Murray Abraham's Salieri early in the film after he recounts first hearing Mozart's music.  &quot;[music that good by that young, foul-mouthed child] must be an accident.  It MUST be.  ...It better be!&quot;  Here we get an earlier indication of the depth and maliciousness of Salieri's jealousy.<br />As of this writing I still prefer the original version better, but I may eventually grow used to this longer cut.  Fortunately I have the THX-treatment Pioneer LaserDisc Signature Edition from several years ago.  The LaserDisc set has the same running commentary by Milos Forman and Peter Shaffer (though the &quot;new&quot; footage on the new DVD has newly-recorded commentary behind most of it), and a different behind-the-scenes documentary called &quot;The Last Laugh&quot;.  A few moments of &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; are incorporated into the DVD's b-t-s doc, but they otherwise contain different material.<br />Some of the most interesting footage of the new documentary, however, is the footage from screen tests and auditions of other actors who sought the major roles.  Their faces have been masked by digital blur (so the producers wouldn't have to pay them for appearing in this documentary, among other reasons both legal and for sake of courtesy), but you can make out Mick Jagger and Elizabeth McGovern fairly easily.  You can also see a page or two of audition/screen test schedule sheets with times reserved for Sam Waterston, Rebecca DeMornay, and others.  There is also footage of actress Meg Tilly in rehearsals as Constanze.  The producers have not hidden the fact over the years that Tilly was cast and set to begin shooting as Constanze, but a leg injury sidelined her at literally the last minute.  Berridge and an unnamed other actress survived the winnowing process to select Tilly's replacement, and they were flown to Prague for test shoots.  That story is covered in greater detail in the documentary.<br /><br />Matter of fact, why didn't the makers of this Director's Cut DVD include &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; in addition to the other new documentary?  There certainly is room for it on Disc 2.  All in all, the bonus extras on this 2 Disc Special Edition are in short supply, when one considers the amount of Disc Two's unused potential space.<br />But if you weren't one of the fortunate ones to get the LaserDisc Signature Edition back in the day, then the whole of the running commentary will be new to you, and I'm sure you will be most pleased with it.<br />Well, there it is!tial space.<br />But if you weren't one of the fortunate ones to get the LaserDisc Signature Edition back in the day, then the whole of the running commentary will be new to you, and I'm sure you will be most pleased with it.<br />Well, there it is!
B00006LPER|5.0|I've yet to see this DVD release, but the theatrical release was brilliant.  The film does a wonderful job of bringing Elfriede Jelenek's book to the screen.
B0000027F8|5.0|This album has been in my Top 5 list since it first came out more than a decade ago. Till today, it is still one of the most intimate and introspective albums I've ever heard. The hauntingly beautiful voice of George Michael breathing life to the melodies and lyrics in this album is just to heartbreaking at times (as in the reprised version of &quot;Waiting&quot;) &lt;&lt;There is no point in moving on/When you've got nowhere to go/The roads that I have travelled on/Well they filled my pockets/And emptied out my soul/You look for your dreams in heaven/But what the hell are you supposed to do when they come true?&gt;&gt; But he also sang in this album the joyfulness of breaking from his past in &quot;Freedom&quot; (and that fantastic video where all previous images relating to him were destroyed. BTW - love this album cover, this whole &quot;new&quot; concept of his &quot;facelessness&quot; as was the Freedom video is a novelty). Also, absolutely loved &quot;Cowboys And Angles&quot; showing us more of his love for jazz that he has shown with &quot;Kissing A Fool&quot;. Of course, we now have his &quot;Songs from the Last Century&quot;.
B00006F7S4|5.0|While not anywhere near as varied as say, any of Beck's other releases, this picks a unified sound or theme and basically sticks with it. The results are absolutely jaw-dropping. Vocally, Beck can hold his own much better than his 'Mellow Gold' or 'Odelay' days, his natural singing voice is very calm and mellowing, he should've used it more. Musically, this is also Beck's finest hour, trading in samples and big beats for washed-over synths and strings and the ever-present acoustic guitar. <br />'Guess I'm Doing Fine' is almost like country given the electronic touch in the studio, while 'Paper Tiger' is like 21st century psychedelia including a freaky string section and an even trippier guitar solo. 'Lonesome Tears' is an exercise in gloom, given the complete orchestral treatment, sounding like a creepy Pink Floyd at times. 'Round The Bend' is the quietest number on the album, and arguably the most musically stunning, again with the strings, but in a more calming fashion. Beck may be &quot;bummed,&quot; but being bummed never sounded so nice. Beck has put out one of the best albums of the year, and definitely the most consistent album of his career, maybe even his best.
