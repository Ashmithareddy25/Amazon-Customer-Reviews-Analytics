B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game has instructions and will give you a hand right at the beginning. It is not too hard and if you don't understand just follow the walk thru on you tube until you get the idea. Fun and makes you think.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Rating this for my daughter (she is 11).  She has been playing this game since she purchased it.  Loves the game - definitely one to get for your child.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I do recommend that you read the first book in this trilogy &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; before you read this book to get the rich history of the families invoved as characters in this novel. The books are long but well worth your time.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I rate Criminal Minds, Season 8, 5 out of 5 stars. The cast has matured. Things are getting really intense. I just wish I hadn't been practically forced to purchase the episodes I've missed. However, the lack of commercials is really nice. As is having the episodes on my hard drive for viewing whenever I wish.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is fun, cool, i never get tired of this game :):):)  i give it 2 thums up:):)<br />:):):):):):):):):):):) the only thing i find is that the upgrades and costumes cost alot of bannannas. and i think that you should be able to log to facebook on more than one divise.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I have seen this movie many many times and it never gets old. It has so many great lines, and great characters.
1781162646|5.0|I've read a lot of Stephen King and enjoy his stories, both heartwarming (think \\"Stand by Me,\\") and terrifying (think \\"Full Dark, No Stars\\").  \\"Joyland\\" is a little bit of both. It's a coming-of-age tale that is mostly heartwarming, yet also creepy and suspenseful.  It is a classic King that by the end, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Another aspect about \\"Joyland\\" that I enjoyed was reading about \\"carny\\" culture at the amusement park.  Carnies have their own language and way of life that I find fascinating. When I wrote my first novel (which coincidentally also chronicled a terrifying turn on a Ferris wheel), I researched the \\"carny\\" way of life and am still eager to learn more.<br /><br />Read Joyland. For the story, its heart, the suspense, and magic.

B00COGZ8FU|2.0|The books are much better.  Tom's character was othing like the the book character who is much better.  This eems to be a movie about a character named Jack Reacher and that is the only real connection to the books.  Much like Alex Cross.

B008XG1X18|3.0|So, I have put off signing up for Pinterest because of the time it can steal from my day and other more important activities. I probably won't use it often. In fact, I haven't accessed my account since the day I began it, and that was an hour of sitting and scrolling when I could have been more productive doing other things.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|What a disappointment. Skip to the bottom of my review if you don't want to read \\"filler\\".  I turned the pages and scanned not fully absorbing as I looked for a story in all the words but try as I may 62% of the book and still endless filler. How desperate I became to find the unfinished story of the last book. Sadly my time and money were wasted on this pathetic gibberish. If I could return this book I would but even then I would feel guilt that it would be sold again to some poor soul who also believes they can find the story lines never fished in the previous books so instead I will through it into the fire where at least it will have some meaning.<br /><br />Don't buy this trash unless you don't mind wasting time and getting nothing of the prior story.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|It was so mesmirising ,my daughter and Iwould stay up late to catch up on all of season 1 ,have already seen the rest of the series and can't wait for season 6 to begin in September , the characters were like some of the people I have associated with in the past ,my daughter was so into JAX ,she can hardley wait for what's next ,

B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|My entire family loves this movie.  The kids think its hilarious and my husband and I do too. There are many jokes that the kids don't get because they weren't around in the 80's but that are great for adults.  Love the discs and the digital copy.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to use. Works great with multiple operating systems and devices. I'm currently watching Modern Family from the ABC Web page on my HDTV. Google seems to have really come up with a homerun. Wish it were both 2.4 and 5GHz but the 5GHz would have reduced range anyway. Google's design also has a couple of other benefits:<br />1. Less powerful devices and AMD chips can be used.<br />2. The control device (computer, etc.) can be located much farther from the HDTV than other solutions such as Widi.<br />When you use one of the currently designated apps. like Neflix, almost no laptop resources are used and the quality is excellent.  When playing quality video in a browser tab, a 3rd. generation i5 seems to be the minimum to produce very good results in a browser tab.  An i3 almost does it, but based on my experience there will be some issues with anything less.  Apps. like Netflix are a different story as far as cpu.  I have a Samsung 500T with an Atom processor and it is able to run Netflix on my HDTV using Chromecast with no problems.  We also have a 2012 Mac Mini running Windows Vista under the Parallels emulator.  Netflix runs fine in this configuration.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I absolutely loved the show. It showed that we all have a choice in life, and we don't need to accept the cubby hole some people would put us in. The ensemble was excellent in working together to find their place in their new circumstances. There is life after retirement!!!

B000N4SHPS|5.0|SOMEHOW Stallone suspends one's disbelief on his very aged shoulders so that one actually buys the premise of a senior citizen returning to the ring after having the living crap beaten out of him for the past forty years, and then he shows incredible cinematic maturity in the making of the film.  More than anything else, Rocky is here, more than ever, what he was from the beginning--an underdog fighting back--again, and again, and again, and again...-- in a life that can rough you up pretty good now and again.  Most importantly, rather than falling victim to the \\"upping the ante\\" temptation (like he did so many times there in the \\"middle movies\\") and having Rocky's final battle being against a twelve-foot outer space vampire cyborg, Stallone goes right back to the utter simplicity of the first film to close out the series in a most dignified manner:  just suiting for an old man who's done one hell of a lot of inspiring.
B0087ITBPC|3.0|its ok movie with barbra and co star  it does have a story line and that makes you want to see more all in all its pretty good some funny parts in it and other plots along with it comedy is what it is

B007IXWKUK|2.0|barely got through the first book.  Not sure what all the fuss is about. Couldn't even finish this one.  Thankfully I heard this exact thing from a friend of mine who is an avid reader.  Couldn't get through the second
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|Definitely the best game on kindle fire other than minecraft. I could play this for hours. Ignore 1 star reviews, they just don't have enough space, or have terrible Wi-Fi. Needs an update though.

B002KDUDG6|5.0|Can listen to him all day and I just want more.  What a class act.  Love his song choices of classics and the sophisticated way he sings them, keeping them alive and young.  The opening song where the music sounds sinister is a lot of fun and sets up the fun tone of the CD, refreshing style.

B00DHNBPA6|3.0|without the original films... this movie would be nothing special at all. it has nowhere near as interesting a premise, and it appears to have the elements from the original films just pasted in, here and there, for attempted relevance. nope... didn't help. altho gory... the pacing in many parts, is what is actually deadly. also, while suspension of disbelief, is required in/for a lot of films... this one asks too much... --- BEGIN SPOILER--- when mia pulls so hard to free her hand and forearm, that it tears away from her arm.--END SPOILER--- that, and a few other things, are just too much to ask. there's a huge difference in the way the \\"over the top\\" is done in evil dead II, for example, and this blood fest. you could add modern gore to evil dead II, and it would be a far better picture than this film is. gone is the main bulk of the original, captivating, story line and premise, and substituted is a weak plot line. as i say.. you can not just throw in aspects of the originals and then just expect that to \\"do \\". one should add to the lily, rather than attempt to make it better by guilding it... with blood, in this case. we are asked to believe that people survive these horrific things.. BEFORE.. they are possessed and while still \\"human\\". credibility, even in these films, counts for something. this was just another gore flick, without the allure and story of the original. if this version had come first.... there wouldn't have been an evil dead 2013. sorry... did not deliver the original goods.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Love this movie & it is awesome in 3D. Good quality DVD. I will watch it over and over again.

0525478817|2.0|I should probably start out by saying this is the first John Green book I have ever read, and I went into it with high expectations because of how many good reviews I've seen for his novels. That being said, I was very underwhelmed.<br /><br />First off, I felt the characters were boring, and rather unbelievable. Let's start off with, Hazel the main character. She's a cancer patient....that's it. There's really nothing else interesting about her: she has cancer, she likes to read, she falls in love, that's her whole character. Next we have the romantic interest, Augustus Waters. His name bothered me from the very beginning, it just sounds very...fake. I know that sounds overly critical, but still. His whole &#34;attractiveness&#34; felt very forced, and cliche. In the beginning he's just too perfect to be believeable. Plus, there was no build up between them. Their meeting was so rushed it was almost non-existent. I get that it's a short book, and you can't take a whole chapter to do everything, but it literally felt like one minute they are complete strangers and the next minute they are semi-dating.<br /><br />Also I found the wording to be a little on the pretentious side for a teen romance novel. Quite frankly, I'm not sure who the audience for this book is. The plot is a basic, sappy teen romance type plot, while the wording and references are something you'd expect to be aimed at young adults, maybe college students. I guess what I'm trying to say is, when I read this I couldn't help but feel like this is one of those books that kids in 9th grade read to feel &#34;sophisticated&#34; or &#34;mature&#34;. They tell all their friends how &#34;deep&#34; it is, when it really isn't. It only appears deep on the surface.<br /><br />Anyway, in my opinion the only redeeming quality about this book is that once in a while something sad happens, and I have this weird masochistic thing where I like things that can make me cry. And I did cry maybe 2-3 times through out this book. However, I just can't in good faith recommend this to anyone, unless like I said, you are a 9th grader who likes to feel &#34;deep&#34;. In which case, you go little hipster kid.s book. However, I just can't in good faith recommend this to anyone, unless like I said, you are a 9th grader who likes to feel &#34;deep&#34;.

0316069434|5.0|If you read Connelly once, you'll probably read him always. His morose detective is a brilliant delineation and I always anticipate the next read. If there are any films in the works, I'm grateful that Eastwood is too old and too stupid to play.
B0000714BP|5.0|one of the grand slam of movies with Kinky Boots and Pricilla, Queen of the Desert.<br />John was not surprise but he sure was convincing and pulled on my heart.<br />So unlikely to see the other two in paint and hair.

B007THA4FI|3.0|The book was a very slow start and a bit confusing because there were so many characters.  It did not get really interesting until Part 4 but by the end of the book I did not want to put it down.  The ending left a lot of unanswered questions so there must be a sequel coming.  There was way too much foul language.
B007HPO3CC|3.0|I read all the books. because of that, I think I was able to appreciate series better. The books delves into the characters so much more indepth.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|I was so disappointed by this book! If you have read and loved his other two books, you will find this one is not up to par. It is disjointed and almost like several short stories loosely tied together. New characters (You wonder: Why are they included?) keep cropping up. The ending is a bit predictable, especially if you have read Hosseini's other two books. I looked forward to reading this and found myself struggling to finish it, but persevering since I kept hoping it was going to get better, but it never did.
B005LAIGN2|4.0|good action. Great historical content. The HBO version is also a good movie. It gives a bit more back ground on their flight training ordeals.

140006922X|5.0|In my upbringing in the Lutheran church, not much was said about Jesus outside of the bible. I wanted to understand where he came from. Reza Aslan did a fabulous job with detailing a very complicated time period in a digestible, highly readable format. I learned more in one reading of this book about ancient Jerusalem and the area in which Jesus lived and taught than I did in years of Sunday school and sermons. He offers some intriguing insight into the man, Jesus, and how his motives and rhetoric may have been interpreted by his contemporaries. One can read Alice in Wonderland without any historic reference and find the story enjoyable; read it with notes on the context and the era and the book opens up an entirely different view of that world. Reading Aslan's book is like reading an annotated version of a classic - I now understand the events of the world in which Jesus lived and find myself thinking about the context of the bible as opposed to just reading a dry rendition of another persons words.
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|I am big fan of the original Wizard of Oz and I was looking forward to this film.  It is not Great, and it is no Powerful either.  They really should have take their time with this and it really could have been something special.  All of the previous reviews are right on point.  The characters are flat, the dialog is flat, and the important casting of the witch sisters is not very well done.  That being said, the film does have its moments.  I liked the way they paralled the original Wizard of Oz with the black and white opening sequence until the explosion of color when the Wizard first arrives in OZ.  Other than that the film is very mediocre and never creates any real magic like the original did.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I've read the book (unlike so many of the \\"reviewers\\" who gave it one star) and here are some points.<br /><br />1) This is a popularization of recent (late 20th-early 21st century) reputable scholarship regarding Jesus. There's nothing in this book that would surprise a person (like myself) who has read pretty much all of the accessible scholarship on Jesus published in the last 30 or so years. Just going through the (extensive!) notes and bibliography at the end indicates to me that Aslan has done his homework.<br /><br />2) Aslan takes the position that Jesus was a zealot for God and God's Temple, but (and this is repeated several times in the book) he was not a member of the Zealot Party, which wouldn't arise until over 30 years after Jesus' death. In this, Jesus was just one of a number of people who arose in the period from the reign of Herod the Great to the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE and his fate was like those others. In short, Jesus was killed for his zealotry, which was perceived as a threat to the Roman authorities and particularly to the Jewish sycophants who ran the Temple (and profited nicely from it). This is not a position shared by many members of the religious scholarship fraternity, who have attempted to carve out a position for Jesus where he's a religious figure who did not delve at all into politics. It's an interesting argument that I can't do justice in a few short sentences. If you're interested, you'll have to read the book yourself and decide if Aslan makes his case.<br /><br />3) Aslan doesn't stop with the death of Jesus, and, as someone writing history, not hagiography, he carefully notes that he can't pass judgment on whether Jesus' resurrection occurred, because it is not a historical event but an event of faith. He then pushes on to a discussion of the earliest Christians and, in particular, the conflict between James the Just, described as the brother of Jesus and the head of the Jerusalem Christians, and Paul of Tarsus, the evangelizer of the Gentile world. This part is definitely worth the read, because it brings out the fact that the early Christians were not \\"in one accord\\" but were in fact fractiously divided over what Jesus taught and what it all meant.<br /><br />4) My only serious factual gripe about the book comes from the first paragraph of Chapter 15, where Aslan describes James the Just as follows:  \\"He himself owned nothing, not even the clothes he wore--simple garments made of linen, not wool.\\" The problem is that historically linen was an elite fabric, not the fabric of the poor. (For example, Luke 16:19 points out that the rich man in Jesus' parable of the rich man and Lazarus wore purple and fine linen and all four gospels are agreed that Jesus was buried in linen.) Making linen from flax took a lot of preparation as compared to wool, which can be spun practically straight from the sheep. But getting back to James the Just:  The sources, by putting James in linen, were more likely comparing James to the Temple High Priest, who would have worn linen for the sacrifices.<br /><br />5) I'm knocking off one star for not being footnoted. Granted, there is an extensive set of chapter-based endnotes (and I strongly suggest reading them, they're as engaging as the book itself), but the lack of footnotes is a serious flaw. Even if the book is intended for a popular audience, it should have been footnoted.<br /><br />6) As for the assertion that the book is fatally flawed because it's influenced by Aslan's Muslim background:  That is flatly false. Let me state again that there is nothing in this book that can't be read in the scholarship done by *Christians* published over the past several decades. Moreover, if Aslan was pushing Islam, you'd think that he'd make a point of saying, \\"Well, Islam considers Jesus a prophet,\\" but he doesn't. Not at all. The reviews which make the assertion that the book is terrible, horrible and awful because of \\"OOOOH EVIL ISLAM!!!!\\" appear to have been influenced by Fox News' promotion of a screed by John Dickerson. As a former journalist for Phoenix New Times, Dickerson should know better, but perhaps that's why Dickerson is no longer a journalist but now pastors a church in Prescott, AZ and churning out inaccurate and inflammatory junk for the fearful faithful.een influenced by Fox News' promotion of a screed by John Dickerson.

That's the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five.<br /><br />Yes, it is a lot like Subway Suffers and Temple Run, but it is also its own game in that it has games within the game (the Meena run and Vector Battles).
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|One of my favorites good story line, i would buy it again. Made me laugh and cry. feel good movie
B0000C9ZBW|4.0|This watch fits the hand like a skin. The black dial is much easier to read than white or silver.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|love it, Denzel Washington does a great job enjoyed the story line and held my attention. I would buy it again
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Lots of action, however, I felt the line up of actors/actresses could not have been better. They had an online chemistry that made the move better! Just saw Red 2 at the theatre. I am  not typically an action movie person, but these 2 are highly recommended by me.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|really liked it, great digital effects enjoyed the story line and it held my attention. I would buy it again
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I really love this game and I'm a brony but I have one issue with this game. Rarity doesn't have her horn and I believe that they made Fleur de lis an alicorn and sorry if I misspelled hr name. But really people! The game is worth it but it's just weired seeing Rarity without her horn is the shop.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|really liked it, made me a little sad but a great ending enjoyed the story line and it held my attention. I would buy it again
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|This guy is truly an artist in his own  right, which usually isn't the case with American Idol winners. This is a really good album, I look forward to more from Phillip.
B001FD5KJM|3.0|How can you hate Iron Man, Tony Stark is one of the most well constructed comic characters in the stables. And this re-imaging of him does a great job to keep his essence while bringing him to a modern audience.
B00BMR5HOO|3.0|I chose this rating because I don't really like the lay out. The don't give the dew point and enough details.
B005ZMUXDC|4.0|Now this is a good show, a wonderful take on the classic damsel plot, doesn't matter what your age range you will enjoy this movie.

B008K6HN8I|3.0|I would be lost without this honest to goodness, why doesn't android os have a file explorer? Great user interface to make it all come together aswell.
B001FBSMW6|5.0|i would say this is the best Keane album of them all. its fun, quirky and some of the tracks are absolute genius. H + F it ain,t, but if you are prepared to move on from the Piano Rock time you will love it.
B005ZMTAXQ|5.0|Classic Pixar, you can sit down with the entire family and enjoy this movie. No matter what your age everyone will love this movie.
B007EC6FIS|3.0|i,ve loved the whole musical journey from H+F onwards and thought that with Keane every record has surpassed the previous, but this one I have tried and tried and can,t get it.<br />It has nice melodies and a couple of tracks that I do like but bizarrely the two tracks which I like most are bonus tracks on the deluxe editions. Strangeland and the Boys.<br />on the whole it is very safe, very wet, there is none of the fun evident in Perfect Symetry or Night Train, even the video which comes with the cd they all dress like they are at a funeral and look thoroughly miserable throughout. This is very forgettable. I struggled to give this 3 stars but I did love every other record they have done.
B00CLZ4B4I|2.0|Here we have a perfect example of a plot that could have been half cent being blown by poor production and being badly over hyped.
B002ZRPQ5K|5.0|ishin Denshin we could do without, but this was never mean,t to be an album and is an ep of odds and ends to keep the fans happy in between albums.<br />it doesn,t flow like you would expect from an album but I would say it has some of Keane s greatest tracks on it.<br />Your Love, Stop For A Minute, and Clear Skies are some of the catchiest tracks they have ever written. I Followed the band on the promotional tour to back this record, and there was a fantastic vibe for the whole tour. if you want Hopes and Fears you,ll be disappointed but if you like each record to progress and sound different to the previous, you may like it!
B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|Classic Pixar, you can sit down with the entire family and enjoy this movie. No matter what your age everyone will love this movie.
B00932AA5G|4.0|This is a great movie it was very suspenseful. We were not sue what to expect but I like it! I thought from the title that the movie would be about something else. Although the title didn't really match the story It was still well written. I like the ending also!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Honest Abe as a vampire hunter! If only we could send him after those sparkly vamps from some other unmentionable movie.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I've grown up with the marvel characters since I was a kid, and this move was everything I wanted.  I enjoyed the characters and how they mixed.  The story is engaging, and the action is awesome.  Overall, this is an excellent movie!
B002BWCJOA|4.0|This is a great family movie, with the multi-layered story it will keep both kiddies and parents entertained. I personally loved the animation style aswell you see stop motion used so rarely these days its nice to see it done so well!

B0064W65SO|4.0|Frank Millers batman is simply a must read! No collection should be without this work! The Dark and gritty batman we all love!
0307474259|5.0|I was blown away by this book as it basically takes the food pyramid and slams it on its head, along with all the accepted conventional health wisdom we've been force fed from birth regarding carbs, meat, cholesterol, and fat.  This is a must read for anyone looking for a long termanswer to losing weight and keeping it off.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|A great Disney movie, a real family movie you can sit down as an adult and let your kid out as you chuckle. The plot is simple and predictable but very well done. Its simply a nice heart warming movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app... The graphics are amazing and there is so much interaction... This app is great for any age group.

B0046B1KHG|5.0|Now this is a good show, a wonderful take on the classic superhero plot, doesn't matter what your age range you will enjoy this movie.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|I read through some negative reviews here, and I cannot imagine people can actually give 1-star for a movie as spectacular as this. I am a movie buff, and have watched all the top 100 most successful movies of all time. This movie deserves nothing but 5 stars. Why? Because it emphasizes the human element of Kal-El, a.k.a.Superman, why is he here on Earth and how important he is for mankind.<br /><br />In addition to that the movie features mind blowing special effects that will put \\"The Avengers\\" to shame. By mind blowing, I mean, crazy, out of the world, never before seen action...that WILL blow your mind! If you have grown up reading comic books, and if you really like action-packed/special effects, then you WILL appreciate what's in this movie. But, if you expect a 3-hr boring drama, voted by some air-headed/mindless critics, then this isn't your movie.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the best super-hero movies even made. Period.
B005ZMUTZ4|5.0|Classic Pixar, you can sit down with the entire family and enjoy this movie. No matter what your age everyone will love this movie.
B000EZMIC4|4.0|I own the video which has the one eye with the pupil moving away the dvd has the two eyes and is not exactaly the video it is still Pink Floyd but not what I was looking for
B00464F19Q|5.0|This is hands down one of the great suspense movies, It will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire duration. But it is clearly not for the faint of heart.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|So much fun !! The kiddo and I can compete with each other on a pretty even playing field... thumbs up fun fun til my daddy takes my third away
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Surprising cute and really funny! The dads are completely comical and the moms-to-be are very accurate/believable when it comes to being pregnant. I think I will buy this one:)
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This is the best war game in the app store i was looking for a long time  but like all glu games the glu points items are way to much but it is a good game
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It takes the best aspects of temple run and subway surfer and combines them.  The best game I've ever played and it works better than temple run and subway surfer combined.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Awesome game more better than the other ones  now that I have been playing it my mom wont let me play it anymore because I'm addicted to the game
B003G4W49C|5.0|the mental games and character development are amazing. Card strings you along like a fish on a hook begging for more
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I do not understand why I can not receive more Uno tickets. I get the scratch off &#34;sometimes&#34; and even then I have to check back every 45 mins, People work I can not keep checking to do scratch offs. Even then I only get 2-4. I can barely play more than 4 games for lack of tickets. Even when I level up I only received one ticket. I do not understand?? I am about to give up because I am getting no where with the game!
B005LAIIJY|4.0|The movie was way to bloody and slow in different areas. It could have ended alot sooner than what it did.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|Great app for when you do not have access to your PC.  Good for tracking deals and sales (Summer Sale).
0060873175|2.0|Crichton writes with a love of science, truly exploring the what-if of everything. Whenever something seems unbelievable, he provides just enough sound reasoning for even the most cynical reader to consider it REALLY happening, at least for the length of the story. The character's thought processes can usually be followed, and it's fascinating to look at life through the eyes of a scientist, even just a fictional one!<br /><br />This, however, is not Crichton. There is a clear line from where Crichton's slight skeleton of a potential masterpiece plot ends and the lack luster adventure of a different author begins.<br /><br />As long as you don't expect it as a Crichton novel, it's not a bad beach book. It reads like an Animal Planet narrator, reciting interesting facts here and there as the scientists recognize this bug or that bug, and properties of them. But the cool problem solving stuff other Crichton characters do (like for example, literally any interaction with the bots from 'Prey') simply isn't there - it's reduced to 'let's take toxins from bugs to defend ourselves from other bugs'. Though the pacing is the same as a Crichton thriller, unfortunately most of it's like listening to regurgitated facts instead of critical thinking or exploring.<br /><br />I was looking for something more thought provoking, the usual Disneyworld of Science he would create where boring logic turns into an imaginative adventure! I'm disappointed by this book, though I gave it a fair chance and finished it to the end. I don't regret it - but it definitely didn't pull me in like Crichton does.<br /><br />Want to read a really cool Crichton novel about microbots? Read 'Prey' instead - it's more sophisticated and interesting than both 'Micro' and 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Made my wife very happy--what's not to like?  Not much to say about a DVD--it either words or it doesn't, and this one does.

B00D6BQG1W|4.0|A zombie rom-com with heart. Nicholas Hoult does a lot with a little in this flick, a good Friday night popcorn movie.
0143116371|5.0|If you love fashion, clothes, people stories, then this book is for you.  The book has pockets of interesting life stories inserted at what appears to be Scott Schuman's favorites.  He has a wonderful sensitivity and he channels this into his eye for detail and story telling.  The book is so thick, he must have had a hard time figuring out which photos to leave out!!!
B005DD7TI0|3.0|This movie is the cinematic equivalent of a good beach book. It's easy to watch and the performances are good enough but as a whole this movie isn't the most original. It feels like it should have been made 10 or 15 years ago.
B00CTKHXFO|4.0|EXCELLENT PACK, I CONSIDER THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD SAGA I LOVED IT, IN AN OTHER HAND AT THIS MOMENT I HAVE NOT PLAYED ALL THE GAMES.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I purchased two of these bad boys a little over a month ago for myself and my fiancée. I purchased them for light gaming and using around the house. I have a few wireless devices in use, including a keyboard and mouse, Xbox 360 wireless controller, and, of course, a wireless router. I also am using two of these devices. The router is set not to use channel 6, for what it's worth.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />The headset gets crystal clear sound (when it works, which is discussed below). The surround sound feature is accessed using a switch behind the left ear and is instantaneous, and also sounds excellent using Plex and the built-in feature in TeamSpeak, which I use when gaming with friends. The G-keys are always my favorite feature of Logitech products, and are no exception here. They are automatically detected in Spotify for playlist traversal and starting/stopping, which I thought was a clever feature to include. The microphone is _amazing_, and the folks who I game with that use the G930 sound an order of magnitude greater than average headset users, and on par with those who use headsets in the $300 range. It also has a very neat feature where, if you raise the boom on the headset, the microphone automatically cuts out (there is also a button on the side of the mic to mute), and the boom will light red when muted. I purchased these on sale for $85 each, which is a steal considering the quality I received (on one of the devices). The charge lasts exceptionally long for what I'm used to on wireless headsets.<br /><br />● Great sound (with and without surround sound)<br />● G-Keys<br />● High-quality microphone<br />● Holds a charge well<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />One of my devices works flawlessly and has since the day I bought it. The second device, however, seems to be cursed with the same problems many low-score reviewers claim. It is interesting to see one excellent device against one plagued with problems, validating both the excellent reviews and the poor ones. As a point of interest, I have replaced the poor performing one already, and the replacement is ALSO defective. Currently, Amazon is reviewing my case and may replace it again, if the investigation team allows it.<br /><br />The issue that is most quoted in poor reviews is that the headset cuts out on occasion. For me, the first faulty device would cut out once every hour or so. The new faulty device does it several times an hour, cutting out up to 3 times an hour on rare occasions. I am probably 5 or 6 feet away using my device (both are wired to the charger, but I don't think that's relevant), with absolutely no issues. The other device is near no other wireless devices besides my own headset. Additionally, the first device that I received had a damaged Surround Sound switch. If you were able to pry the button down, surround sound would work excellently, but the button was hard to move. Lastly, if the device cuts out for whatever reason (be it from being faulty or you went out of range), the microphone will turn back on even if you have it muted on the device itself. How embarrassing!<br /><br />● Received 2 defective devices in a row<br />● Microphone mute feature flaky<br />● Poor quality control<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this device under two conditions. First, it would have to be on sale, because the full price point is not remotely worth the hassle of getting a G930. Additionally, you have to be willing to be rigorous in testing the device when you get it and prepare to suffer through several returns before getting a fully functional and stable device. If you manage to get your hands on a flawless one, take it and run. I will probably take a much closer look at warranty services in the future for Logitech devices, though this quality control problem may be contained to this particular device, as my other Logitech devices (including a mouse and the G510) all work great.<br /><br />I heavily doubt that this particular headset will last for a reasonably long time, but, at this point, that is just conjecture. Amazon fulfilled their original return policy with no issue, but following up with another damaged device has been a tad difficult.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|It's a fun game and it's helpful of your a new player. I hear that if you don't want to buy the whole game but still want ask the stuff ask you have to do is wait. I'm not sure about that. Maybe wait until you unlock it out until next year's game comes out.. Anyway, it's fun and you can live without ask the other stuff.
B009MO5G90|5.0|First I should say I am a huge fan of the RE movie franchise, but have never played the games. I also have about 50 of the more popular 3D releases. That said I reiterate my statement above. I will admit the movie is a little campy compared with the first film but how can they not be considering the age of the franchise. If you have been with them since the beginning then you have to have fun with these films at this point. The story is great and picks up right where the last one left off. It also leaves on a great climax like the previous films but hints that the next film will be the last one. They bring back lots of older characters in a unique way. The pace is great, the fight scenes well choreographed, and Milla is as hot as ever. Best of all is the 3D. I did not see this in the theatre but this film has the best 3D I have ever scene. Objects come out of the screen just as I always wanted. PTA did a great job and I cannot see why the reviews are so low for this film. If you liked Afterlife then you will love Retribution.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is great fun. Great feeling to solve the puzzle. Highly recommended.not sure how many puzzles there. Just played a few so far, looking forward to playing more.
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|Adam Sandler is a hoot and this movie is fabulous. The music is fantastic and Selena Gomez is a cute Vampire
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I used to love temple run so I thought that I would also love tample run 2. I quickly got hooked, but it soon became apparent that this app was only a nuisance. it would glitch, shutdown, and even once removed itself from my device! Please fix this or try to see what the problem is; then I will raise my rating. If others are experiencing this also, you are only losing custumers.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is quite additive.  Really fun. Would br nice if you could getbmore money for tasks though. Over all its very fun and I find myself messingbaround with it all day
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Can't get enough of it love this game need more games like this one and easy to play awesome awsome
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and fun. A thinker! Like that I can shop and go back and figure out the puzzle. Keeps the mind sharp.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is challenging and fun. Hard time putting down. Got stumped on a few levels but over all easy game.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I had a hard time putting it down. I shared it with co workers and they love it too. Just ordered the second book.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series so much I somehow ended up with two copies!<br />The story line is great and the actors suburb!<br />Bawled all thru this season!<br />It's even more fun to watch now I have been to Downton ABbey ( Highclere Castle)  super awesome to see in person. However if u go by advanced tickets. They sold out last December for the previous year!
B0076DELIG|5.0|A most I enjoyable mystery.  The plot and characters keep you interested throughout.  Very well written and packaged.  You will enjoy it!
B007SGM084|5.0|I have read these books several times. I love how Ana and Christian found each other and learned to love each other despite their differences.
0618871713|5.0|It seems that a conservative action group and some parents are none too thrilled with the College of Charleston's choice of Fun Home as freshman reading. One conservative leader even went so far as to call the book pornographic. So how could I not read it?<br /><br />Know what I found? I found a book that is a very well written story about a girl's coming of age, how she dealt with finding her own identity, how she managed to love her father despite a difficult relationship with him that was only made more difficult by the discovery that he had a secret life, and then how all of this wraps around her father's apparent suicide and the affect of that upon the entire family. Heavy, but pretty normal stuff for coming of age literature. The two things that set this work apart are that both the author / daughter and the father are gay, and that it is a graphic novel. Being a graphic novel means you get to actually see some of the situations that would just be verbally described in a regular literary work.<br /><br />This is a good book. It handles real issues. It does it in a way that is both entertaining and thought provoking. This work is a microcosm of exactly what college is meant to be - an exposure to new material so that you can expand your field of knowledge, learn from that, and grow. And then hopefully, no matter what you take away from that experience, you can put that new wisdom and growth to use in your own life.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new version is terrible!  After trying it for a bit I am finally deleting it - please bring back the other version!
B00D6M86RS|1.0|There is no play action on the boards, just a bunch of ramps.  The graphics are too complicated and make game play confusing.  I bought bought Captain America hoping for a better board, but it's exactly the same as Avengers with different graphic overlays.
1490313370|1.0|It was more of a autobiography than self help<br />or business investment book.<br />  The book is not informative and really has<br />nothing to offer.<br /><br />RD
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Initial setup isn't quite as easy as they make it out to be. Some things you might not know.<br /><br />1 - You need a laptop or PC that is connected to your wi-fi router wirelessly. I don't have a laptop and my PC is wired to my router so this method of activation is out.<br /><br />2 - You can use a smartphone or tablet to setup as well. Sweet I have an ipad and iPhone so I'm good to go right? Nope. iPhone and iPad setup functionality is &#34;coming soon&#34;. So yeah you can set it up via phone or tablet as long as they're Android. Great. They didn't quite mention that part.<br /><br />Hopefully iOS setup support is actually coming soon so I can use this thing. As of now it's pretty useless.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book absolutely love it! .I have already read it several times. I will definitely recommend to family and friends!
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|Having said that, I will say that, once again, my husband thoroughly enjoys them and that makes it worth the five stars.

0783230079|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen.  Both for Robert Downey, Jr.'s mindless comedy and for the seriousness of the actual subject matter.  I would reccommend it to anyone.
140006922X|5.0|Good book. Well written. You should read it. You will enjoy it. You will agree that it is a good book.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|As a lover of a good tale of horror, I should have read Dracula long before now. Thanks to Kindle & Amazon, that omission has been remedied. What an exciting story! It held me enthralled from beginning to end. Each character came alive through his or her \\"journal,\\" and<br />Van Helsing is my favorite hero in a long time. Can't recommend this book highly enough!
1426209584|5.0|This book is the most complete and beautiful compilation of Birds of Paradise.  It worths every penny of the cost.  Just buy it.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I love this game so much and I definitely recommend it but playing it on medium is so hard I can barely beat the first one and I'm scared to find out how hard it is on hard. Overall I love the game!
B005ANZN3Q|3.0|Lang Lang plays real good, but he was spending too much time crowd-pleasing.  Would be nice to have more actual piano playing footage.
B00AA03D18|5.0|I couldn't pit it down. My deceased friends and family are now thought about differently, and I feel sooo much better. I have already loaned this book out to a family member.
0062280228|5.0|Gaiman's works grow on me slowly. The first time that I read American Gods I thought that it was interesting and ultimately forgettable. But I didn't forget it. Bits of it kept popping up in my head for years and now several re-reads later it's my favorite book. The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a bit like that: something that on the surface looks like a bit of light reading, a short dark fairy tale. Except that fairy tales stay with us, become part of our own personal mythology.<br /><br />I don't think that Ocean is Gaiman's best work but it's certainly his most personal. I particularly love that the picture on the back cover is actually of Gaiman as a child.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Despite some idiosyncrasies in the previous version, this new &quot; updated&quot; version is nothing short of a disaster.  I don't like its look, it's cumbersome to use and it has a tendency to freeze up, necessitating a restart of my original Kindle Fire.  The Weather Channel folks have been tinkering with their app over all platforms for years now.  This is their worst offering yet.  Just a bunch of &quot;try hards&quot;.  Going to download Accuweather as soon as I finish this.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I will be sharing this story with others.  There is a great deal to be thought through and considered.  A wonderful story/life.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fantastic! E L James has a way of writing where the words jump off the page. Most romantic book I've ever read!
0385349947|4.0|I heard the interview while on a road trip and it got my attention.  Easy to read and love that inspite some negative reviews, I still think it is a good book!
B0090SI56Y|3.0|After the lackluster feelings people had to &#34;X-Men Origins: Wolverine,&#34; you'd think it wouldn't be tough to outdo it in being an entertaining effort. And this film does manage to do that, but not enough to be considered a great film experience.<br /><br />Picking up where &#34;X-Men: The Last Stand&#34; left off, Wolverine is now living like a mountain man and battling his own guilt. But he is soon drawn into a web of conflict and honor in Japan, due to an old acquaintance, which has him facing not only his guilt and past, but his own sense of mortality.<br /><br />Much of this story's main thrust and inspiration is taken from the early 80's mini-series by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller. Director James Mangold does a decent enough job of implementing the facets of that story, while updating it for more modern sensibilities. He also does some wonderful work with some of the major action sequences, as well. But many of the performances just feel subdued, save for Jackman's as Wolverine. The emotional context of the scenes and motivations don't quite ring true. The love affair with Wolverine and Mariko (played by Tao Okamoto) Feels extremely rushed and forced. And the inclusion of Viper (played by Svetlana Khodchenkova) feels completely miscast and unnecessary. However, the last bit at the end during the credits, was a great bit of tease, which was a lot of fun and one of the best moments of the film.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman does his best to give you what you expect from the character he's spent over a decade bringing to life on the big screen. He perfectly provides you with a very realistic feeling for the inner turmoil within Wolverine's soul. But there are many lost opportunities to dig deeper into it, which are sidetracked for the action sequences and other characters machinations that aren't vital to the story and don't really advance the overall plot very much. There was so much more that could have been expanded upon with Wolverine and Mariko, if the time used on these superfluous character plots had not been in the way. Worst of all is that Yukio's character (played by Rila Fukushima) was totally wasted as little more than a plot exposition guru, there to fill in the blanks that the script and story didn't bear out as they should.

This film feels much the same way!ime used on these superfluous character plots had not been in the way. Worst of all is that Yukio's character (played by Rila Fukushima) was totally wasted as little more than a plot exposition guru, there to fill in the blanks that the script and story didn't bear out as they should.

B00DC7NNAC|5.0|Perfect follow up to Wizard of Oz. Does great job explaining &#34;how and why&#34; in the magical land of Oz!
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|FINALLY finished. Good but not worth years of waiting. This last book was pretty much one big battle. Sanders did well
B006YVZZ0Y|4.0|Been looking for this movie for a while. Great movie, and awesome price. If you liked the Prestige, you'll like this one even more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that this is the best free game out there, entertaining for children terns and adults I believe everyone will love this game
B004J64QSI|2.0|I was hoping for the play on dvd, but this is just the actors and actresses standing around singing their songs. The music is good, but its not the play and I was very disappointed by this.
0061950726|5.0|So well-written and heartbreaking. A wonderful read; have some tissues handy. Loved it and will add to my collection. I was so grateful for the privileged life I have had (meaning a safe home, food on the table and clothes); I challenge anyone after reading this not to be thankful.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Well written book about a very depressing subject matter. The author really helped me understand what it is like<br />to live in the slums. The people are brought to life and become visible.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I think it is really fin how they set up th  game it is way more fun then the regular uno. I think u should play it.
B00DHQ208Y|4.0|pretty much sums it up.<br />still the 60s psych feel of the earlier records<br />but with alot more analog keyboards<br />(and a little more production)<br />this group is progressive in that it grows with each release.<br />beatle harmonies and john lennon esque singing<br />over 4-track sounding lo-fi ish rock.<br />maybe its more like &#34;mid-fi&#34;
0786956291|3.0|D&D is a great and this game is really the only way to introduce ones self to it, but the first adventure is kind of hard to follow sometimes and during character creation i often found myself having to go back over the text to find out why i never got a constitution score or some bs like that and perhaps the cards could already come in rather than tearing them up trying to remove them from their sheet.
034580404X|4.0|I am not a prude but was somewhat shocked at the sexual content. I loved the story and was amazed at how the heroine tuned the jerk around.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|There is no doubt that this album is going to catapult this wonderful talent right back up on center stage, world wide. Some of these songs are going to be mega-hits, each one unique and her ability to evoke an emotional response from the listener is exceptional.<br />Congratulations to all that were involved in this project! This is a &#34;WINNER!&#34;

B00A3AUGEW|4.0|Enjoyed beginning to end.  It's a great mix of relaxing and get you're groove going kind of music.  Just the way I like it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I usually get so frustrated with this type of game that I just end up feeling like an idiot, but this game is more intuitive while still challenging. I really liked it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Helps drown out noise and even had sound waves designed to help you fall asleep but head phones are needed for  that feature.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|ALL I CAN SAY IS 5 STARS! This story has a lot of different moments and hooking parts in it. Made me cry. Made me laugh.Just a story for the memories!
B000O76T8Q|5.0|Not much to say. The acting was great, and the portrayal of character types was spot on, and the only qualification I could add would involve the rather hazy science. I am not sure divers could do OK on a regular basis even if acclimatized to pressures at 1700 feet, and, well, that deep dive was preposterous. Still, if we judged all sci-fi movies by scientific accuracy, none of them would get even one star.
B008PZYZH6|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. I would not say it was a favorite of mine. It was interesting and fun. Probably never watch it again.
B00871C09S|5.0|My wife said she did not like the idea of Raymond Burr being a bad guy, but I could cut him some slack as a husband with a wife who was causing him grief. Heck, he was just frustrated. In any case, the movie is a nice way to head back into the old days of movie making and have a relaxing evening.
B0041OOEJY|5.0|I'm loyal to the original, but this version is really cute. Great acting by all involved. My kids (girl 7, boy 6) love this one. There's two bad words, ass and damn, they're only said once each.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I don't usually write reviews.  I was always very skeptical of near death experience stories. I try to find a scientific reason for everything, this book made me think twice, especially since it was written by someone whose life's work is based in science. It was also very uplifting, I look at things differently now
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have it on my kindle fire. Great game and it doesn't run slow or slow anything down. And it's free. Can't beat that.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Bought this DVD to have on hand for when my nieces and nephews come over....but ended up watching it myself...<br /><br />Cute movie for all ages...
B0063M22QO|4.0|Enjoyable entertainment that takes some concentration. Start out with easy, as some of the symbols are very similar.All in all an easy way to learn an ancient game.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I couldn't wait for this book to come out... I read it slow because I didn't want it to end.. I love this \\"relationship\\" with Gideon and Eva... I see bad reviews on this book and I think's it's because some wanted to end.. well I didn't I want more of these two.... I hope the next book comes out soon..<br /><br />Of course you didn't like the ending... how many of you like an ending anyway... The \\"ending\\" is ......
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I saw this show live on PBS t.v. and loved it then!  I was thrilled to find the same version on cd!  If you love James Taylor and Carol King, you will love this!  They take, and add a lot of little insights to the songs.  Its funny and reminiscent at the same time!  I highly recommend it!
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|The author takes me to a parallel reality. The word as we know it but ... Different. I feel I am seeing things through the narrator's point of view. Ready to read the sequel.
B0002C4JE4|5.0|I forgot how much I love James Taylor!  I would highly recommend if you are a James Taylor fan! Great price too!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Since the beginning kept me trapped. I couldn't make myself put it down. Great story that leaves me thinking about life.
B008TRH5N6|5.0|There are very few books that I have read that make an ongoing difference in my life or the lives of those I know.  This book is one of them.  I &#34;borrowed&#34; a prayer from this book  and prayed it 3 times a day morning, noon and night for my father who is ill.  My son also prayed with me.  The second day of prayer, we both were so exhausted that we each fell asleep 4 times that day, taking care to pray before we slept.  My father is elderly and has multiple problems.  I just think he is a very tall order.  We prayed for 2 weeks and when we saw him, his health had definitely improved.  I like to say that his physical condition improved &#34;a level&#34;.<br />I had some health issues that just stagnated during this period of time, so I went back to letting my body heal itself for a few weeks.  Now I am back to health and praying that same prayer with my son, and we are asking to bring my father to health again. We are looking for more improvement or a miracle.<br /> Now, these methods are not promoted as &#34;prayers&#34; in the book, so you do not need to be religious to say them.  It's just about putting orders and positive thoughts into the consciousness.<br />My main focus is not money but I have put some thoughts out there and surprise money has come to me in the mail as well.  Not a lot, but here, one day I get a refund of a fee I should not have paid.  The next day, I get a letter about unclaimed property.  A week later, I find the title clearance for a car I had (missing for 4 years).
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I like the other case that did not need to close, I had a couple of incidents with this one. I forgot to close it.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It goes right to the word that you are looking for and tells you the noun origin and everything it's great!!!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This may be one of my favorite novels by Neil Gaiman.  This story is imaginative, whimsical, and dark at times.  I love that part of this is his personal story, wrapped up in a fantastic story.  Luckily it isn't a long novel because once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.

034580404X|3.0|I love literature, but got caught-up in the media hype on this one.  Not the greatest literary piece of work.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Plays jerky but does follow my leads.  Adds get to be bothersome at times.<br />Easy to play a new game when directed.
B003V40SGS|2.0|Wow. . .took about five days to watch this train wreck.  I can't believe it was one of the highest grossing films of that era.  Horrible on all levels.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I read this book because I always like to read the book before I watch the movie (starring Tom Cruise, which was great, by the way).  Because I did absolutely no research, I just assumed the film would be on this book, the first in the series.  It was not.  Instead, it was apparently adapted from the 9th book in the series.  I have no idea why.  I don't think the plot was worse or better in either book so I am curious why film-makers started there.<br /><br />Personally, I feel that Killing Floor would have made the better movie.  It had just as much violence, a better mystery, more of an explanation on whom Reacher is and what his motivations are plus a healthy dose of romance (well, man-romance--none of that sappy stuff).<br /><br />Jack Reacher is an drifter, literally floating from town to town on a whim.  His current whim has him investigating/tracking down a legend surrounding a favorite blues singer of his.  Reacher has been in town for just a few hours before trouble finds him (in a cafe, eating breakfast).  He is arrested for a crime he didn't commit and knows nothing about.  Reacher is a patient man...to a degree and then he is impatient to the extreme.  Pretty soon, he just takes the entire town and hands them their butts back in a little bag.  Reacher is one mean son of a gun...and really good at it.<br /><br />I really liked this book. Just pure adventure fun.  It started to drag a little in the beginning and when Jack was making his 'plan'.  Other than that, it was a great read.  Action, adventure and an intricate and original plot.  I love the character of Jack Reacher and am really looking forward to #2 (or #9--I doubt it matters if you read them in order).  He didn't give anything away.  There is a whole lot more to discover about him.  Those still waters run very deep.
B003IWYOF4|5.0|I have been looking for the rated &#34;R&#34; version, rare and HARD TO FIND!!<br />Thank you! I will be back for more!
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the books and saw the movie and thought they did a great job with it.  Hope there will be sequels.  The books were page turners!
B0015AARJI|1.0|When I opened it, both joysticks were a bit harder than my original one that came with the device, so I thought it was normal and I just needed to use it a while and it would change. Well never changed and they completely affect the game play since its not as smooth as the one that came with the Play Station. Then a couple of months after the controller started to go off on its own after 3 minutes of no use (used it to play a movie and after the intro tried to use triangle to access the menu and the controller was already off). Now I am trying use it and it will say that it has low battery and it was fully charged. This issue is very intermittent and this just shocks me that it could go bad in such low amount of time, since my original one I still have it and works perfectly. So basically felt I wasted my money.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game isn't just adorable, it's also really fun! It's easy to pick up and play, and hard to put down. It's super addicting! The graphics are great, especially for an online app, and the minigames are very cute.<br /><br />Add me, if you want! e211ae

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I play this on my ipod and kindle. Playing on ipod takes some loading time and could be raggy but the graphics are beautiful and lots of details. This game is so addictive too! I hope in the future they create more stages and rivals other than vector and meena. Also the error of not connecting to facebook properly on android (this seems to be not an issue on apple) has to be fixed asap. Overall, though, great game. MUST HAVE on your tablet/phone!!!!!!!

B008S4FZHI|4.0|Although not my favorite book by Patricia Cornwell as it seemed to start off slow for me, I must say I did enjoy The Bone Bed and would recommend to other Cornwell fans or for readers who haven't yet sampled her wares. Great character development.
B000FBFMIO|4.0|A good beginning to a second series of the farseer's. the question I have regards fitz. He seems destined to always lack. Whether that is love, recognition, whatever it is, he never gets his fair share of it.  Realizing that he is the &#34;kings&#34; man, it is understandable that he has little of his own life. But I hope that by the end of this series we will see him find some measure of true happiness
B003ODIZL6|2.0|I really loved this book it was interesting and I would give it to the people who don't know how to read !

B0029VMKJC|2.0|Although the trailer was dubbed in English, the movie wasn't.  I would have enjoyed it more if the movie was in English or at least had subtitles.

The cd finally arrived today; I inserted into my disk drive and...\\"disk is not readable by this computer\\".

B003G4W49C|5.0|I've read this story several times over the years, starting as a teenager. Every time, I just love it.<br />Even though I know how it ends, it still keeps me in suspense. Can't wait to see the movie.

B008IJT0CE|4.0|I really like this app although my daughter uses it the most so this is her review. I think this app is awesome to use for relaxation or going to sleep. it offers many sounds that can be combined. it also has a timer and a button -close app after timer stops- which is helpfull at night. I would rexomend this app to those who like or need soothing sounds to help sleep or relax. I use it pretty much each night and it helps me wind down for the night.

140006922X|5.0|...most of whom I'll bet haven't even read the book.  Note that their claims of historical inaccuracy conflict wildly with reviews of the book by professionals, who I suspect are capable of leaving their religious credentials at the door.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The 1-star reviews are the usual fundamentalist trolls out in full force, a quick glance shows them all talking about how they can't imagine as a christian writing a book about Muhammad and not being biased, ergo the author must be biased as a muslim. This is a point the geniuses at fox couldn't get their heads around either. The writer of this book is a scholar and a professor of religion, the fundamentalists rating this book 1-star can't fathom someone not blinkered by their religious beliefs  as they so clearly are.<br /><br />Read the book, make up your own mind and rate it on its merits. Don't rate the book poorly because it doesn't conform to what your church tells you to believe.
B00C7E3EFU|5.0|When The Fog was originally released, I was not old enough to see it in the theater, so I had to satisfy my curiosity by reading the book that accompanied it.  I would later get to actually see it on network TV in an edited form, but it was so exciting to see on screen what had only been in my mind from reading the book.  Many years later, I was able to obtain a DVD, and that remained my touchstone for this film up until the recent High Definition release of The Fog on Blu Ray by Scream Factory.<br /><br />First of all, let me get it straight for anyone who has never seen this film.  This is NOT a slasher film at all, rather it is a classic creepy ghost story of revenge for a wrong committed by the predecessors of Antonio Bay.  Watching this in high def for the first time would provide many surprises for me.  Most of all, is the cinematography in this film.  Honestly, I had never noticed just how beautiful this film is until I saw it in high definition for the first time.  Some of the shots of the bay and the countryside just took my breath away at how fantastically they were framed.  The picture is so crisp and colorful, I couldn't believe I had never noticed this before.  If you own any previous versions of this film, throw them out, because this is the definitive version!!  The video and sound are presented in a quality that I have never experienced before in its other versions.<br /><br />If you're new to anything produced by Scream Factory, let me tell you that these guys know what they are doing, and they present these films in a way like they've never been before.  Not only do you get all of the extra features from the previous DVD, you also get some new extras like an interview with Jamie Lee Curtis and one by Dean Cundey.  Another new feature that has shown up on other ScIream Factory titles is the Horror's Hallowed Grounds featurette where we are taken to many of the current places where this film was shot.  You also get a new commentary from Adrienne Barbeau, Tom Atkins, Tommy Lee Wallace. This commentary is very enjoyable, and these people have many interesting tidbits to share about the making of The Fog.  There is also a cool Easter Egg that really brings back memories for me.  Go to the special features menu and click \\"more\\" to get to the second screen of extras.  Arrow down to the word \\"back\\" and click right arrow.  You will notice a little cross on the tombstone light up.  Click it and you'll be presented to the way this was presented on its network TV premiere, which is the first way I saw this film.  This little extra really brought back memories for me.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  If you love this creepy ghost story, then you owe it to yourself to get this beautiful new transfer from Scream Factory.eau, Tom Atkins, Tommy Lee Wallace.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Every Neil Gaiman book is a distinct gift that leads us to explore new worlds that are as well-drawn as they are unexpected. I want more stories about the Hempstock women. Please.
B00AEUU4LQ|3.0|I must say I did not enjoy reading this book as much as the previous two.<br />I think what I felt most is that I did not get a chance to fall in love with the characters; they did not spring to life for me - which for me was what I loved most about his previous two books.<br />The beginning of the book is enticing, you feel like you're in for something. But then the plot stops, characters are left hanging in mid-air; while he introduces new characters, that do not ultimately feed into the central plot. And those are left hanging in mid-air as well.<br />I think what he was trying to do was give us a bigger picture of how one's actions may unknowingly affect others; rather than give us the focused picture of two characters and their lives that we'd been used to. He starts out with the tragic separation of Abdullah from his little sister Pari and branches out, giving us snippets of other characters' lives, and then ends with Abdullah & Pari again. The problem is, the minute you grow attached to one plot and its characters, you'll find it ends; and you've moved on to the next one.<br /><br />Given how good his previous two books were, the expectations were pretty high, and I imagine it must be very difficult to try topping them; so even though it's not my favourite, it won't discourage me from reading his future works.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|When you take on such a well known subject, which has such passionate followers and well established dogma, and still manage to create an interesting and enlightening narrative, you have managed to break the \\"doctrine\\" barrier and actually reach literary mastery.<br /><br />It's a story I have known for ever and yet was discovering for the first time. It managed to keep my interest high, the same way \\"The DaVinci Code\\" kept me enthralled. I truly did want to know how it would all end. Where Dan Brown takes some liberty for artistic sake, Reza Aslan takes the fully documented approach. And to be fair, he realizes that even with facts, there is room for interpretation of the meaning.<br /><br />My personal take was not exactly what Churchill said \\"History is written by the victors\\". In this case, History is written by those who can actually write, leaving the rest to an ever changing and fading oral legacy.
140006922X|5.0|I had doubts about this book's authorship since it's been so controversial, but after reading it cover-to-cover, I've learned a few new things about the historical Jesus. Reza Aslan does a good job in narrating the life of Jesus, I like his well-referenced research style because it does not leave room for speculation. Highly recommended. Please ignore the media hyperbole.

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My 7 year old grandson is the reason I even watched this show but much to my delight I loved it, it is entertaining and very cute, no rough stuff which is so refreshing, no foul language and a good Family show you can watch without getting embarrassed.  He was able to see the Newest Despicable Me with his summer school class and I cannot wait to own both of them so we can watch them over and over again.  Thanks
B00AYB16EO|5.0|Awesome, awesome series depending on your type of humor. If you like blunt, mocking with a touch of raunch comedy this is perfect. If youre looking for silly family fun? Not so much. Check out a Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler movie. If youre with friends and wanting adult humor? This is it. Would not allow kids to watch this myself though I'm sure many do.

1907360573|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the adventures (and misadventures) of Gerry and his cohorts, whether they be two- or four-footed. The 10-year-old budding naturalist explores the far corners of Corfu in the 1950s, where no rock wall, olive orchard, swamp, or family member was left unexamined. A fun romp of a read!  I have purchased additional copies as gifts.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game..Warning though you might get addicted. This definitely gets you to use your brain and reflexes.
0307987647|5.0|I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy and this is a wonderful addition to my medieval fantasy library. I am in the midst of the second book having been completely reeled in by the first and will enjoy finding out how the saga unravels with its twists and turns, loves and hates, dangers and tender moments.<br />Thank you George Martin for your imagination, wisdom and magical story telling powers!

1401216676|5.0|This book is superb.  Pages nice and crisp, thick and high quality for a smaller book.  The art has been updated ti look more modern, but that's ok for me.  If I want nostalgia I'll get the original from the collection out.  Recommend this to ant one wanting to expand their collection.

1451626096|5.0|I actually enjoyed various theories presented by this book. You can't expect someone to write about the 14th and 15th centuries with modern sensibilities. If Henry did, in fact rape his future wife, would that be in keeping of the brutal times they lived in? And how come no one is shocked or mentioning the incestuous relationship between uncle and niece? These were horrible times, when women were nothing, a man could do anything to his wife and she was nothing more than an object. The fact is that Elizabeth was pregnant when they married. The fact is that Margaret Beaufort was ambitious for her son to be king. She did do many of the things that Gregory reports and I do think that Elizabeth was a child born of fear, living constantly with a sword of Damocles over her head. Her grandfather and great uncle were killed trying to take the throne from her cousins, brother went against brother- mother against sons- Her siblings were murdered and she didn't know if if was by the man sworn to protect her, or another member of her wide flung family. Elizabeth was the daughter of a power couple, could she have quietly wanted to fly under the radar- I wouldn't be shocked if she did. Sounds to me, Gregory presented a girl who just wanted to be safe, her children safe, and if she did it with a no nothing attitude- well, she wouldn't be the first in history. I thought her believable. I did however, enjoy the B story more than anything else. I had never thought about Perkin Warbuck as being anything more than a Pretender and Gregory's representation was quite creditable. She gave the whole story legs and made me want to read about Henry's infatuation with Warbeck's wife. Elizabeth was a pale shadow compared to both her mother and grandmother Jaquetta. I always thought of her as able to influence her husband with her Yorkish savvy and intelligence. Perhaps I was wrong, but it sure did skip a generation to rest in the heart and mind of her granddaughter Elizabeth 1 , one of the greatest queens of all times.est queens of all times.

B00DV2D0JC|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game and have played it through twice already. This is from the same developers (Artifex Mundi) who made Engimatis, Dark Acana and Nightmares from the Deep - all wonderful point and click games.<br /><br />The story is engaging and really held my interest. The game follows standard point and click gameplay where you search different locations, pick up inventory items, and then use them accordingly when the time comes. There are also hidden object searches and mini games, both of which are fun to play. This game has so much going for it: the graphics are top notch and extremely detailed, the dialouge sounds authentic, and the characters are interesting. There are lots of scenes to explore, and a fair amount of back and forth as you navigate your way through all the various locations.<br /><br />The locations can get a little confusing, but there is a map and arrow hints to point you in the right direction, and if you are in the right place, the hint will indicate exactly what you need to do. No task was so difficult that I couldn't figure it out. The hint system is very good and includes a full strategy guide, which makes the game suitable for beginners. I had no glitches, loading screens, or technical issues playing on kindle fire HDX 8.9. This is a long game, which includes 10 chapters, a bonus chapter, which continues the story from another character's perspective, and some extras.<br /><br />I recommend this game to everyone - it is extremely worthwhile and definitely one of the best point and click games available for Android!!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|The folks at Abbey Road who undertook this project had a difficult job.  They knew that anyone who would spend $320 on a box set of the Beatles' \\"core catalog\\" on 180-gram vinyl would have to be either audiophile enthusiasts, or hardcore Fab Four fans, or (more than likely) both.  In other words, this product, by its very nature, is going to attract very critical customers.<br /><br />In my estimation, the end result is an impressive success.  I'm not going to talk about the merits of the music because, once again, if you are looking at buying this, you know what you're getting -- the \\"core catalog\\" consists of the original UK albums, with the exception of the American version of Magical Mystery Tour subbing in for the UK EP version, plus the Past Masters two-disc set that collects all the non-album singles, b-sides and other odds-and-ends.  Suffice to say that this is a legendary discography, and for good reason.  The Beatles continue to resonate, 50-plus years after their debut LP.<br /><br />What a potential buyer needs to know is, \\"Did they do a good job?\\" in putting this set together.  I think they did. I wouldn't call myself an audiophile, but I have a mid-to-high range setup, and own just under 1,100 records.  The records in this set are some of the better sounding discs in my collection.  The music is crisp and clear, the sound range dynamic.  The \\"dead wax\\" (the silent parts at the beginning and end of a record, and in between songs) is very, very quiet.  It's obvious that a lot of painstaking effort was put into making a vinyl set worthy of the Beatles' legend.<br /><br />There is some controversy surrounding the use of the digital remasters that were used for the 2009 CD reissues. I own a fair chunk of Beatles records that originate from the 1960s, and I do notice some occasional sonic differences here and there when comparing the old vinyl to the new.  But, in my opinion, the differences are very subtle, and always for the best.  This is not like George Lucas revising the first Star Wars movie.  It's more like what Lucas did when he revised THX-1138; the changes actually work. ;-)<br /><br />If you've wanted to have the Beatles on vinyl and have the money to spend, go for this set.  I believe you will not be disappointed.  In addition to the quality of the sound and the vinyl, the box and included hardback book are gorgeous.  This is probably the best vinyl box set I have ever bought.Lucas revising the first Star Wars movie.

B0023SDPS6|5.0|I love books that are unpredictable. This story is certainly that.  Also the main character is flawed and ever so likeable. I also like the way the relationship between Longmire and Henry unwinds.

0812973992|5.0|Colum McCann weaves an intricate, carefully crafted tale of life in New York City, as seen through a variety of unique individuals.  It is a clever and inspiring vision of the deepest needs, cravings and survival techniques of very different people, whose lives are interconnected by happenstance.  I loved it & ordered more of his books.

B001EC2ISA|4.0|I was hesitant to order the Blu-Ray vs the DVD, assuming it wouldn't be done well so much as a quick buck from the movie archive. While the cartoon episodes have artifacting issues the main feature is pretty solid, you might not notice any visual issues, if you do it should be very, very minor (right corner of opening credits). I can't comment much on the sound quality as I usually use headphones or my TV's speakers than surround sound (I don't own one) but blu-rays.com describes the surround sound quality in their review (off Amazon). I have no complaints.<br /><br />All video is VC-1.<br />Audios are Dolby TrueHD and Digital (also known as AC3), and it includes a &#34;Music only&#34; track in AC3 surround.
B0040QDMBE|5.0|I found this one of the easiest economics books I have read. As a result I found it very engaging and informative. Would recommend to those interested in economics and the 2008 economic collapse.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|UPDATE: Chromecast can stream AVI, MPEG, and MP4 video files from computers. For now MKV files only play video, with no audio. May be a software update can address that.<br /><br />What is it?<br /><br />My previous article explains a bit about that.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Setup:<br /><br />Fairly simple. You can setup following provided instructions using your PC / Mac or in Android App. iOS App for setup is coming soon as of today. Doesn't mean you cannot play videos from iOS devices. You can still play from iOS devices after initial setup. It is said to be having 4 GB of flash memory and 512 MB of RAM.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />Stream from Android and iOS devices (Netflix and YouTube for now. More apps coming).<br />Anything and everything you can play / open / do in your Chrome browser of Windows / Mac. This means a lot. Any content where there is no app, we can simply play from the computer. This also means you can open a local video file in your chrome and that can be streamed.<br />Queue Management of the content. I can keep adding videos from YouTube to the TV playlist. Other devices in the same WiFi network can see and control the queue as well.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Only Chrome Support in computer browsers. That is enough anyway.<br />Sorry to Blackberry and Windows phone owners. Hey, still you can use your computer to stream.<br />Some local file types may have challenges, for now.<br />Mobile device streaming at the mercy of individual apps. Glad to have Netflix on board. There is YouTube obviously. I am expecting that supported app list to grow fast. Need an app to play local mobile device videos / pictures.<br />No mirroring of mobile device like iOS AirPlay.<br /><br />Will it replace Roku / Xbox Streaming / Apple TV?<br /><br />It potentially can, if you have a computer at home. For me, it definitely will. It will even replace my Home theater Windows PC. There is hardly any content that is not playable in computer but only in these streaming boxes. Anything that plays in Chrome browser, can be streamed to Chromecast. Period.<br /><br />Bottomline, for $35 you get too much!
B00C7O8TSM|3.0|Husband liked it...I didn't mind it, but I prefer more current songs.  At least this was not a throw away like the next one I ordered!

B0080SZ0V8|1.0|As the title says. And I'm not the only one with this problem.  As soon as the game starts my phone starts vibrating at almost 100%. And with no option to disable vibration it's unplayable.  Uninstalling. I'll check later for a patch. Samsung galaxy S3. Android 4.2.1 (I think. Maybe 4.2.2)

B00CW665VI|5.0|Originally posted on my blog: [...]<br /><br />Tangled was our weekend read along book with our Girls with Books group and I really loved it! (Warning: this review may be filled with quotes because Drew is so funny and I highlighted about half this book).<br /><br />Drew is a hilarious narrator. He tells us his story, breaking down the 4th wall, and starts off with how he's currently sick with \\"the flu\\". I mean, what other reason could there be for his sick feeling and the fact that he hasn't left his couch in 7 days? Oh and that pillow that smells like her? The one that he's clutching? That DEFINITELY has nothing to do with his flu, right? Of course not.<br /><br />\\"If I'm just sick, then I can take some aspirin, get some sleep, and I'll feel better. I'll be me again. Eventually. But if I admit I'm crushed, if I acknowledge that my heart has been shattered into a thousand f-ing shards...then I don't know when I'll ever be all right again. Maybe never.<br /><br />So I get back into bed. To wait it out.<br /><br />Till I'm over the flu.\\" - pg 158<br /><br />Drew starts off as an egotistical, arrogant, playboy ass. He's successful, put together, picks up random girls all the time and has the hilarious sense of humor that reminds me exactly of Barney from How I Met Your Mother!<br /><br />They are seriously SO similar. And just like with Barney, despite his jerk-ish ways, you can't help but start to like him. I mean, I was laughing OUT loud throughout this book! I started reading this in public and had to go home because I kept laughing. After he meets Kate, he can't get her out of his head but then he finds out she's the newest associate at his company. He's serious about his work and isn't going to let this affect his work.<br /><br />\\"She works here. In my office, where I have sworn to never...ever...screw around. Her warm soft hand slides perfectly into mine, and two thoughts enter my head simultaneously.<br /><br />The first is: God hates me. The second is: I havebeen a naughty, naughty boy for most of my life, and this is my payback. And you know what they say about payback, right?<br /><br />Yep. She's one hairy bitch.\\" - pg 17<br /><br />I freaking loved Kate. She is smart, hardworking, career-minded and has worked hard to get to where she is. She's not going to let some smart ass like Drew screw anything up for her. They're both so competitive and clash and argue in the cutest way. At one point, as they're vying for a client, they try to one-up each other continuously until they find themselves showing up to work at 4:30 am.<br /><br />\\"It's still dark. And as I get to the door of the building, guess who I see across from me, arriving at the exact same time?<br /><br />Kate.<br /><br />Can you hear the hiss in my voice? I hope you can. We stand there looking each other in the eyes, clutching our extra-large caffeine-filled double-mocha cappuccinos in our hands.\\" - pg. 36<br /><br />Their competitive work relationship is hilarious. But as they progress, you start to see different aspects of Drew peek through. Kate challenges and changes him. Oh, sure, he's still his witty, confident self but she brings out the good side of him. A side not even he knew really existed. Think Barney and Robin in How I Met Your Mother. I just fell in love with Drew.<br /><br />Drew is one persistent guy. I think he can start up a how-to advice column on how to apologize for being an idiot. Or just an advice column in general. He deals out advice throughout the book aimed at us readers and it's.. simply hilarious.<br /><br />\\"The female mind is a scary place to be.<br /><br />Men? We don't leave a lot of room for doubt: \\"You're a dick. You f-ed my girlfriend. You killed my dog. I hate you.\\" Clear. Direct. Unambiguous. You girls should try it sometime. It would bring us all one step closer to world peace.\\" - pg 98<br /><br />His narrative voice is just fantastic. The secondary characters were also really fleshed out and I really liked them all! I hope that the second book will be a companion novel about some of these other great characters.<br /><br />Overall, I absolutely loved the humor in this one. I fell in love with Drew. I aim to be like Kate. Drew is abrasive at first, but he grows. Read this -- but not in public because you'll be a) biting your lip to stifle your laughter or b) laughing anyway and drawing stares or c) both. (Why, no, I am not speaking from experience...)<br /><br />Favorite Quote:<br /><br />\\"Women fall in love quicker than men. Easier and more often. But when guys fall? We go down harder. And when things go bad? When it's not us who ends it? We don't get to walk away.<br /><br />We crawl.\\"

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun fun fun. A very quick addicting game. it is also quite challenging. I absolutely love it. which is surprising since I am not generally a fan of race games
0307341577|1.0|Having read Gone Girl and absolutely loving it, I decided to work backwards and read Gillian Flynn's \\"Dark Places.\\" The writing is not as great as Gone Girl's nor is the depth of the story line. The story is drawn out and there isn't much suspense as others have mentioned. I personally highly disliked this book.
B0058VA2TU|2.0|It was supposed to be black with some orange swirled in. It was only black.  I like all vinyl, so I kept. Would have liked to have the color though.
B00004U45G|5.0|The brilliance of Jimmy Page paired with the power and earthiness of the Black Crowes. Delivers on every level. Saw this show live at a different venue and finely found this rare gem to always remember one of the greatest musical nights of my life!

IT IS NOT MADE FOR THE HD HERO3!!!  I purchased it for the larger lens opening over the supplied HD Hero3 housing only to find out that it wasn't made for my cam.

B008TT7CXW|5.0|I am always worried about losing my micro sd card.  I have 3 gopro cameras and several other devices that use micro sd.  Even just taking the card out of the camera to go to the computer I have dropped them and felt lucky I found them.  As soon as I pull a card I can plug it into this holder and mark on the dry erase service (if I want) info about it.  Very helpful if switching cards and tracking used vs unused ones.  I keep on sd adapter in the sd slot, one true sd card then there are 4 micro slots.  You can use both sd slots with adapter cards so there would be a total of 6 micro sd slots if you filled the adapter slot.  Has a hole to mount a ring to clip to or a neck strap to keep track of.  Would be nice if they had put open area on the front product name plate for writing down contact info.  I will use my label maker to put on the info I want.

B007MB5OCE|4.0|A very interesting story in the genre of Life of Pi and Forrest Gump.  Set in Sweden and around the world, the story reels of the adventures of a 100 year old escapee from a nursing home, and then uses life flashbacks to 100 years of the heros life as he develops his history in flashbacks. Very well done.

B008XKSW7M|4.0|I have to wonder about whether the people who wrote negative reviews have actually gone through having children. I think they did a pretty good mob of mining some of the more difficult aspects of pregnancy and parenting for laughs. I'd give it a solid three and a half stars to four stars.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|Almost like My Dinner With Andre in it's casual seeming impromptu conversation .. and in fact, it was written partially by the actors who don't seem to be even acting.  I like the idea and how they carried on the original story. It turns out not only did they partially write it themselves, Julie Delpy really wrote the music herself and played the guitar and sang ... no stand-in voice-over here .. a really nice, interesting show.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|This album is just wonderful.  Songs that you can understand the words to.  The quality of this album is great.  Highly recommended.  DAME HILDA
B001NA6096|4.0|No sparks, no explosions, no big things ... a very neat &#34;little&#34; movie that doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is, but what a neat thing it is .. a movie about real ...&#34;real&#34; people talking about real things ... a picture of humans interacting.  Very much like My Dinner With Andre years ago, one long conversation, walking through the city.  It sounds so real because the actors had a hand in the writing of it. I think some will find it boring, and they should look for the newest Tom Cruise pic instead .. this is for people who like movies that illuminate lives and speak our language.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a great product.  The quality if wonderful and of high class material.  Therefore, I would highly recommend this product.  DAME HILDA

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was just as good (maybe better) than the last two books. I hope the next book is just as good as this one.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This is a wonderful product.  Very high quality.  And it came it good order and as advertised. Highly recommended.  DAME HILDA
B00B8ESX42|4.0|A melancholy and though-provoking study of a lost soul. Outstanding cinematography. There are some amazing closeups of the actors, especially Joaquin Phoenix. His performance is so good it is almost painful to watch.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book is a must read. It will open your eyes to new ideas clarifying and answering questions you've had for years. Great book for open minded people.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|I saw this movie in 2D and 3D (don't waste your time on the 3D for 2D did just fine). Great story line, great acting, loved every minute of it, Kaiju's are ugly but the graphics are phenomenal. Made me want to be a pilot to a Yeager.  There is a also a philosophical aspect to it. LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this movie!! Can't wait for it to come out of DVD.<br /><br />I really do hope they create the prequel to this movie!!
0345803485|4.0|The sex was hot, the plot was not.<br />This is a grown up version of Twilight, and I have no shame in admitting that I read it all in the first day. It was nice to see some sexy situations but the mental/emotional/codependence of the characters was kind of revolting.
0785153942|4.0|I am not a fan of graphic novels but I really wanted to know what happened before the movie. Purchased this book and was a little upset that it was a comic book depiction but was surprised that it kept my attention. Seriously I read the book in less than 30 minutes. I will purchasing the actually novel but this book does give hope that a prequel may be coming down the line soon!!
B003FB0268|4.0|This is not my normal genre of reading, but I heard about it in a class and Im glad I purchased it. It was a very good book.
B000002VSN|5.0|I have many of Whitney Houston's cds, and this one is a favorite of mine!!  I highly recommend it to others.
0345803507|2.0|I was disappointed with the third installment of this series and felt they should have stopped halfway thru the first book.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|What a great story.  Story telling at its best.  Told in the true voice of a fifteen year old boy.  Takes place in 1960 in Montana and Canada.  About children's skewed view of their parents, parent's self centeredness, and how their actions affect kids long term.  Also about the lack of child protective services in 1960.
1881273873|5.0|Knowing what your love language is can help your express to your partner or future partner how your needs are met. Understanding why you feel the way you do can only enhance a relationship or marriage. Good book!
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Most of the time when a band doesn't release an album for a while, it shows.<br />This album is so far from that--it is unbelievable!<br />Every song is fantastic and the overall album leaves me exhilarated!<br />Keep them coming--there aren't enough bands like this out there anymore.
0316154687|4.0|This was my first David Sedaris read, and I found it quite funny- I will have to get more of his books.
B00BOXZAG6|5.0|Was looking for something different in 3D this fit the need.  Very good story and<br />very good quality.  Thank you.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Loved Boz in my college days and still do!  I put the album on shuffle on my mini i-pod when I work out too.
B007XAYKX8|5.0|Moto GP ROCKS!!<br />THE KENTUCKY KID'S GOT SPEED....................69(((((-;<br /><br />Owensboro ky is proud of the Hayden boys!<br /><br />The Waltrip's  show class! NASCAR -----((((-::
B0035JNRXU|5.0|Also, the great action show of the type of movie always showing all the great entraining movie on the TV series. They have great stories and estrous subject to their stories and many plots. Love to see it again, it never greats boring.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is lots of fun. There are four ways to play so it's always a challenge. I enjoy this game.
B00C2GJWNG|5.0|Kind of an old bluesy rock and roll with a twist of strange but awesome voice. Good mix. Sounds Good !!
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|Clarke, Asimov and Heinlein the masters of Sci-fi.  Unique take on the fate of mankind. Fascinating read. Expect the 2001 Space Odyssey trilogy will be an experience in reading as well.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Fun movie for the whole family. Funny and sweet, without being too sweet! Am looking forward to the sequel. A must-have movie.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|BIG FISH always has great games. Even for your computer. Been a member for years. Glad they finally started putting them on my Kindle
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Its fun to play but I think the dragon's egg are to expensive same with other items you have to buy
B003YL4KS0|5.0|At 41, to finally learn how to get my curls perfect ...is such an absolute relief. This book is perfectly written with easy tips and tricks that have made me fall in love with my curls at last. Great for anyone who's been struggling with curls, grizzly and bad hair days!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have family and friends all over the country as well as Europe so it's great that I am able to see the weather they're experiencing as well as their forecasts!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoy watching this show it's very good although i don't think they should've killed the oldest girls husband just after he has a son.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|Good flick. Kinda corny and a little predictable but enjoyable. I really liked streaming it through Amazon Instant video, saved me a little room on my hard drive.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched one episode and was hooked. Counting the days with all my friends until the next season begins. Can't come soon enough.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Had a lot of fun solving the mysteries of this game. Definitely would like to see more in the future.
B00005M989|5.0|Everything I love about Prince is included in this album.  Great quality sound and awesome song lists.  I love this album.
B00821PCJS|3.0|I clicked on what was presented as one episode and was charged for the entire series. It is not worth watching the entire series.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|If you enjoy Diana Krall's music, you need to buy this CD. She does a terrific job singing many of the standards.
B009X00E18|4.0|Perfect fit and function and looks good too! I'd recommend this. There aren't too many options for the larger Kindle.
0547564651|4.0|Sometimes Tough comes to the wrong conclusions about what we should do about the studies, but the best part about this book is the large amount of studies he includes. For example, the study on ACE (adverse childhood experiences) and the studies on HLG mice (high licking and grooming) can teach us all a lot about what's most important for young children in order for them to grow up to be functioning adults.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|By far one of the most enjoyable books I've read this year. Endlessly entertaining and it has such an engrossing undercurrent that I was literally unable to put it down!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i like it,  this game is pretty cool, also a great way to kill time,  really cool for children as well.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Quite a nice selection of equipment, game goes faster if you buy up but even without you can get very fast along
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Fairway solitaire is a very fun and addicting game that is easy to learn. you find your self wanting to play all the time. easy to pick up and hard to put down.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. If you have a brother you need to watch it and it if your just in to mma.
140006922X|5.0|Pay no mind to the bigots leaving 1 star reviews on this particular work -- most have not read it, and are merely unable to comprehend that religion and history may no coincide. The author, a historian who's more than qualified to speak on Jesus of Nazareth, neverr hides the fact that he is Muslim - the fact is pasted on the 2nd page of the boook. More importantly, why does it matter? He's spent two decades of his life exploring Christianity and religion as a whole.<br /><br />His book is truly unbiased, informative, and moreover, a sort of \\"love letter\\" to the real, historical Jesus Christ. This is an excellent read, and I suggest it to people of all faiths!
1426308469|5.0|His big brother (age 6) can read it to him.  Love it.  I don't think I  could have given him a better gift
0743435729|3.0|In the far future mankind has developed space flight and colonized several star systems.  The rub is that they ave also brought with them all the problems and idiosyncrasies that they had on Earth/  There are wars, politics of power and religion and, happily, growth and development.<br /> Honor Harrington is an officer in Her Majesties Navy.  She is put in charge of a convoy to a backward system bringing supplies and diplomats to work out treaties for everyone's future benefit.  The system is between the Manicoran system (read United States or Britain) and the Republic of Haven (read Communist China or Russia).  The new system they are in is very religious, as is its descendent (read Muslim), so the conflict entails some sex issues.  Honor is very good at her job and so are all her underlings.  She makes the best of a bad situation.  She ends up doing what she can, suicidally, but wins in the end.  I do not think this is a spoiler because in this genre the hero always wins, the question is when and how.<br /> It is interesting that in this story the planets are human friendly, but barely so.  The inhabitants have to adjust, sometimes with mechanical aid.  This is the first time I have read of this sort of thing happening, though it stands to reason that any and all new systems will have challenges for immigants.
0500515328|3.0|While there were some stunning pictures, I was disappointed by how relatively few there were for the size of the book. The Romanovs had some gorgeous jewelry, and I'd have liked to have seen more pictures of the jewels and less of the people (without the jewels). There were also some factual errors in the book, as well as a lot of info on more distant relations that really added nothing to the book. In all, I'd have to say that I was very disappointed.
B008LVCKH6|3.0|At first I greatly enjoyed the unexpected turns and deadpan style of this book. It kept me amused and reading for about half the book. Then, because I was not deeply engaged with any of the characters, I lost interest and stopped reading.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This was the slowest moving book in the series thus far.  Martin doesn't use 10 words where it's possible to use 50.  I appreciate the depth of his characters, but this book read more like an extended series of biographies than an engrossing story.  Nonetheless, I'm hooked on the seven kingdoms and look forward to book 5.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's really fun because there are ways to get more bananas and such. Also there are challenges like battling Victor and more.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I am some what disappointed in the ending of this book. It seemed rushed. I was hoping for some detailed closure with Katniss and Peeta and Gale.
0896760839|5.0|The only thing that could have made this book better was more of it! There is so much wonderful information, sketches, pictures, and detailed instructions on how the garments contained within the book were made. The smallest details were not overlooked on the original pieces, either. This is one of my favorite books.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have a small business and weather I'm on my tablet,  phone or computer I can take my notes, recipes and photos with me. Making presentations have never been easier.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Great movie and like the interaction of all the characters. Iron Man and Captain America rock! Looking forward to #2!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I give it 5*****. Only thing is it's difficult to put down. Read when you have plenty of time to get lost.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Adorable,funny,and love able. I watched it with my 6yr. old grandson and we had a great time. I would recommend it highly.
0425263924|5.0|love,love,loved it. omg. didnt see the twist with trey and tatiana. wish they went more into gideons past all little more. whats going to happen with eva's parents?
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Pleasant. Enjoyable. Easily played. A new twist on an old favorite. Can be played by multiple age groups. I heartily endorse it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|It's free and I like looking for items.  Would like puzzles to solve too though.<br />I like that I don't have to get my Facebook friends to play.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This is the third book of the Outlander series and there is no let down from one book to the other.  You feel as though you are watching an adventure and love story at the same time.  The strength of Jamie and Claire's characters keep you fully engaged in the story as they move from one intrigue to the next.  I find myself hoping for a little peaceful respite for them.  I intend to read the entire series for it is a memorable journey in reading.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|This is a good movie. Been trying to watch all the Scarlett J movies, she is excellent, she did well here.<br />Good story, great people in the film, will watch many times.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|I downloaded the free app first, after playing it to the end was hooked and had to buy the full version.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My granddaughter introduced me to this, and I haven't been able to stop playing!  My cousin and I played it as a two-person game.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I love this headset. Everything is great except I cannot give it a full 5 stars. The battery life is pretty good, I get three or more hours out of it, except it could still be better. When not in use it turns itself off to save battery, however unless I just unplugged it from charging I constantly find myself having to plug it back in. Unless you are really good about keeping this charging when you're not using it I would consider it a &#34;semi-wireless&#34; headset. Half the time I'm using it I have it plugged in. Granted I will wear it for 12+ hours on occasion (and it's very comfortable), The battery is not outstanding, but do not let this deter from buying.<br /><br />It's great for games, I can tell where sounds are coming from. It's not as great as my previous Trittons were with a dedicated mixamp, but it's sufficient.<br /><br />For music this isn't too amazing of a headset, though no headset is great for music I would say. The sound stage is rather limited so I prefer real speakers. As long as whomever you're talking to doesn't mind, you can wear these around your neck and still hear+talk over chat with music playing on speakers.<br /><br />The microphone is not too great at the background noise canceling. It picks up everything from birds if you have your window open, to someone talking on the other side of a closed door.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is quite a rush!!!  my grandson and i have fun playing this game together.  the game is fun
B005QUQP76|5.0|This mouse is my favorite mouse to date. It's well weighted and a clean design. The top is smooth and sides are rough so I grip the mouse perfect with no annoyance. the open design allows airflow and I've yet to be bothered with a sweaty hand after extended use. The DPI changing buttons are there when you need them but out of the way when you don't. The thumb-button provides a comfortable natural resting spot for my thumb now and it's too easy or difficult to press. I haven't accidentally hit it ever or been strained to press it.<br /><br />The build is solid with quality materials.<br /><br />My only complaint would be the software only supports four DPI settings though the range is great.<br />You can bind the settings to the mouses hardware or something to that effect for when games refuse software input of the mouse (an anti-cheat feature as I understand it). This does not affect my recommendation in the least though, it's still a perfect mouse.<br /><br />Ah, and one last thing: the default DPI settings are a bit weird for me, but I prefer a higher mouse speed which fell in between the top two settings. For the normal person I don't think they would even need to deal with the software.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I couldn't put this game down, and ended up staying up way late! Beautiful graphics, challenging game. It will give you hints if you need them. I highly recommend it!
6305678715|5.0|I have been looking to buy this movie for a long time. I really enjoyed the film. Sean Connery is an outstanding actor
B007PM218K|3.0|There was a glitch in the middle of it and it quit working. I had to go to the beginning and fast foward it and finally got  to finish it.<br />However I can't see that blu-ray is any better than plain dvd's.
B001B0G5WA|5.0|I don't know what to say but God Only Knows is one of the greatest songs of all time. This album was ambitious in it's answer to The Beatles Rubber Soul the previous eight months. By this time Revolver was released as well. It was the dawn of the psychedelic era. Pet Sounds is my favorite song on this album and I'd recommend this for any Beach Boys fan.
B005D4YOY6|3.0|I currently own a six year old pair of this model. I can see the build quality has fallen in new generation. Think Ill shop other brands in the future, sad for a shoe company that I own about six pairs of the older models.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great app I love the minions I just wish that you did not need to have friends for the goals.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A great portrait of two &#34;Heroes&#34;, both gave up their life for fellow man. The first, Jesus Christ who gave up His life so that all mankind would have a chance for salvation. And Adam, who after many demons found this eternal life in Christ and became a devote disciple as a warrior, a friend, a son, a husband and as a father. Thank you for sharing this inspiring story.
0307405095|5.0|Excellent recipes and fun ingredient combinations I had not thought of before.  Totally yummy cooking!!  You will love this book.
0307277887|5.0|This book is great. I was skeptical about reading the Dexter series, because I thought nothing could match up to the televison series. I was wrong. The books are just as good, if not better, and they provide hours of thrilling entertainment. I can not wait to read them all!!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is one of the best games I've ever played in a long time and I'm very good at it, too
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|I rented this movie for my 9 year old nephew and 4 year old niece, what a wonderful movie! both of them loved it. I highly recommend it to other children or adults.
B000JZ45LQ|5.0|better than I could ever think of being for all the energy and the voice is greater than ever, only gets better with age.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|This cable did help with the loose port some . You still have to manipulate it  little for it to charge the KINDLE fire with the loose port but it's still working one month later!
B004IK8Q86|1.0|This book was published in 1944. Why is it $11.99?  Maugham's other books are FREE. Maugham is long dead.  This is absurd.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I was reluctant to watch this series because it is a fantasy and I am not fond of the genre, but this series captivated me. Its characters come to life in this more or less 14th century not earth world. My complaint is that there are no captions, and I need them.
B008476HBM|4.0|Sometimes the writing style in classics is too thick, tough to get interested in.  And the story is old fashioned.  I have to admit that this is one of those stories for me.  It just doesn't keep my interest.  But how can i possibly rate it lower than a 4?  It's a classic and many people love it (and maybe some day i'll get into it).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the all time great series.  Period British programing is not my cup of tea.  While everyone was talking about Downton Abbey I had no interest in following suit.  My taste run more in the genre of thrillers such as &#34;24&#34;, &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; and &#34;Lost.&#34;  However I was home recooperating from surgery and it came up on my Netflix suggestions.  I was hooked.  Well written, well cast and excellent story/character development.  Now I am anxiously awaiting Season 4 in January 2014.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Who wouldn't like this cd with music from Sons of Anarchy? Great gift for any SOA fan. Great songs from best show on TV ever.
B00DU74U74|1.0|It was so terrible, I couldn't finish it. I forced myself to sit through all the Twilight movies but couldn't make it through this.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|First, you should realize that this charcoal starter is smaller than the standard sizes so if you are planning on using one of these for a full-sized charcoal grill then I would recommend getting one slightly larger.  However, if you are like me and use a Lodge Sportsman's grill (or a standard sized hibachi) then this starter is perfectly sized.  A full load of charcoal in this starter is exactly enough for my Lodge grill and the slightly smaller diameter and wire cone-shaped grill at the bottom promote faster starting than my older one from the local big box store.<br /><br />My only Con is that it is not made of stainless steel, but for the price paid I certainly won't complain too loudly.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The story is amazing and you just fall in love with the characters. And Jack Gleeson makes an excellent job playing Joffrey Baratheon. I hate him!
B001EBYMB2|5.0|Great flick. The boot camp half stood on its own. Tips could have done well as a 2 movie set and even a trilogy with the 3rd bring all about PTSD.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It's well written, witty, and has a good pace. There has been a lot of research put into both the background and characters.<br />I also love the interaction between Atticus and his hound!
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show. Right up there with \\"The Walking Dead\\". Thanks for putting in on prime for everyone to enjoy. Hope everyone takes the time to see it.
0399162097|3.0|Karen Joy Fowler writes beautifully, descriptively and with conscience. Although this book is thought provoking, I was unable to connect to the characters and felt a bit like an intruder, kept on the periphery of the story rather than fully engaged in their experience. It is certainly worth reading but ultimately disappointing.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My five year old son loves this show.  He says &#34;you get three shows in each episode and they're all great!&#34;
B006MW3V6U|2.0|Thought it was the actual season 2 and it was just interviews with the actors<br />Was disappointed - oh well
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I liked it in general, as the action scenes were realistic and the pace was good. Alot of &#34;padding &#34; though which I thought unnecessary and detracted from the good stuff, which was the real action.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Good movies, great actors, interesting - would recommend in a heart beat.<br />Would watch it again - I loved it
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I read this book in two days. It was such an easy read, flowing and intriguing.  It is not a literature classic, but is a very good beach reading or for one of those rainy days when you need to distract yourself. I am reading the second book from the series now.
B00D41H2PS|3.0|The game gets unresponsive when I get to the shield puzzle. I like the game so far but I can't advance any further without solving it obviously. I downloaded it for kindle fire HD.
B009MYARIK|3.0|This is a quick funny read. Not as good as the shop a holiday series but a nice afternoon beach read,
B00AQL8VU4|4.0|Easy one click to use, so far. I found just what I was looking for. After download search and display was great. Download and installation did take some effort but worth the time. I have an android 7in ZEKE and a 10.1 in ASUS which both work very well with amazon mobile.
B000NY17J6|5.0|ALL RONSRATES GREATEST HITS AND SOME I NEVER HEARD BEFORE.THOSE TURNED OUT TO BE MY FAVORITES ...GO TO SONG 21.....NERVER HEARD IT UNTILL I GOT THE CD...IT IS NOW,EASILY MY FAVOTITE SONG OS RONSTATS CARRER.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Something like 100 floors, but a very nice puzzle for those who love to be challenged.<br />I would not recommend this if you do not have patience.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This Doctor Who pen is really cool, I love the invisible ink and how the sonic screw driver light makes it show up, best invisible ink pen on the market.
0399226907|5.0|Best baby present ever. I recommend it for all new parents. The colors and content are perfect. We read it every day.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|I just started reading this book and I felt the need to write this review right away. I usually do not highlight books, as I usually do not go back over what I read: with this book, every page has found a highlight!<br /><br />I am part of a small business female owners forum and will definitely make sure to share this book.
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|The remastering of Brothers & Sisters is truly successful in all it's attributes. The sound is so natural and clear, as if it was recorded yesterday. The outtakes/rehearsals CD is interesting in itself as it literally takes you into the studio for some pleasant insights with the band. The live concert CD's are a welcome addition to any Allman Brothers library. Yes, there are a few missplayed notes and some off-timing, but the different renditions of their classics outweighs it tenfold. This collection is a MUST for every Allman Joy!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game one one of the BE s t games I have ever played.even though it takes a while to be able to upgrade your minion, it is so worth it. Everyone shod plAy this game
B0000VCZKM|5.0|my 4 year old granddaughter really enjoys watching this edition of &#34;Annie&#34; with Carol Burnett -  she knows most of the songs by heart and its a great purchase.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|This is a must see movie.  Scorcese does a fantastic job directing up until the end.  Hang on for a wild ride!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|The movie was cute but not as good as #2 - We say #2 first and it was great.  The Minions are the bet.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't wait until the 4th season.  WD3 is a must see.... enjoy! I loved it soooo much! The characters evolve nicely... You will love the writing/directing of this series...
B0014D6PCO|3.0|Goo movie in the series.  My wife had never seen it and we all enjoyed it but not as good as the last one.
B00BV1P8NG|5.0|Not a toy but a solid chunk collectable.<br />Not for little kids, no articulation and if it falls on your foot it will hurt.<br />The only downside is I've had some of these with residue that looks like paint smears, not sure what from, but each time it has wiped off. Packaging is not taped so your pony can be taken out and placed back in.<br />Got one for my daughter but, after watching the Derpy Hooves clips with her I got one for me too - not a BRONY.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|This is a safe and easy to use tool for keeping your Kindle Fire HD clean from all the clutter that we don't even know accumulates on a portable device..
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book was very informative. I learned a great deal about the era in which Jesus lived and what he stud for.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I've had no problem from this game.  There are lots of games to keep you busy.  Something I like for my Kindle...
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|What a fun night of entertainment with these fine actors! Although I'm a big Bruce Willis fan, to me John Malkovich stole the show. I like 'em crazy and he did an excellent job of it! SENIORS ROCK! Looking forward to RED 2!
B006YTTVHO|2.0|It didn't deliver what it its title implies. I found it preachy and full of advice on what kind of person one should be.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I does everything you've come to expect and better!  Great resource!  I have it on all my devices, and it instant syncs all of my info.  =)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game! it's always fast &amp;accurate. I am totally. addicted to. this game. I love all types of solitaire.
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|Even though this is the paid version, it has two large and obtrusive ads for other Big Fish games on the menu screen.<br /><br />I can ignore that, but the game force closes as soon as you press the book in Titus' study to begin the game.<br /><br />Ads + unplayable = 1 star. Come on, Big Fish. I know you can do better.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Card's ability to create a race, and all of its intricacies is amazing.  Love the story of the Piggies as well as the Buggers and Humans.  Good follow up to Ender's Game
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fun little game when you feel like getting away from working. It can be addictive trying to complete missions.
0525953728|5.0|Very  well written book. Kept me interested the whole time while reading the book. Did not want to put it down
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|Best love story ever!<br /><br />Great cinematography, music (Cat Stevens) and story. Seem to notice something new every time I watch it.
B0030P1WKY|5.0|Although I'm especially open-minded and very empirically-inclined, I usually take astrological descriptions with a sack of salt. Most are inaccurate. Jan Spiller's &#34;Astrology for the Soul&#34; is anything but inaccurate. After two respected friends, both professional sorts, raved about it, I read it. I was amazed to discover that Spiller has my personality pretty well pegged.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Rick Riordan serves up another great adventure with Greek and Roman mythology.  He brings Percy Jackson to a Roman demi-god camp and they have to work together to save the camp from Gaea and her merry band of monsters.  It is a great read for kids, teens and adults. I do recommend reading \\"The Lost Hero\\" first though. I look forward to reading the next in the series.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is anjoyable because even someone who knows very little about games can play this. There are different modes to meet the needs of a variety of skills.  Fun game!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use the Kindle app lets me read more than just a few books. I use to accees some research material as well as biographical news on the authors. This app is no one in my thoughts.
B004GXKBFQ|5.0|Great movie that tries it's best to stick to the original story! If you're a fan of the book or would just like to have a better idea of the real peter pan adventure, this is a must have
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app! I use it daily. I find it very helpful when making plans. It is definitely user friendly!
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|i loved this movie. The characters where fun, the lines were witty and the story was heart warming. I would recommend it to any adult audience that likes British humor and a good story line.
B0016JBCJW|5.0|The chains of events are attached with humorous layers. This is a movie with dialogue versus simply the actor and a scene. Magnificent backdrop. Quirky human interactions about 3 brothers and how they get along. Not for people who don't get and appreciate uniqueness and dark humor. Exceptionally well written and acted. Owen Wilson's star shines bright. Even Angelica Houson's short appearance ties the film together and the brother's relationships are understood! Plus the Indian settings and Waris' and &#34;Sweet Lime's&#34; acting is magnificent.<br /><br />Please do more Wes!
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|We bought this movie for our kids to watch during a road trip, and they really enjoyed it. Legos are, by far, the most popular toy in our house. The minifigure that comes with this movie is a great addition to their LEGO collection. Since our car DVD doesn't play Blu Rays, we will keep the standard disk in the car for entertaining the kids and the Blu Ray version will be kept at home to watch on the tv. I can't add the digital movie to my iTunes collection, but the price for 2 disks is still good. The Amazon price went down a couple of days after it arrived, as prices sometimes fluctuate on Amazon. Still, it was the lowest price I found for this movie, especially for the minifigure edition.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This film is a definite crowd pleaser.  Its message that you are never too old to find yourself definitely resonates.  The central plot concerns a group of British seniors who for various reasons, some financial some personal, relocate to a dilapidated retirement community in India.  They don't know what they'll find but some rediscover themselves or have an epiphany in their adopted land.  The film is funny and at turns poignant.  The film also contains a number of plot twists that are wholly unexpected.  There are a multitude of characters, plot strands, and backstories here but they are adeptly handled as a cohesive whole by director John Madden who previously helmed the Oscar winning \\"Shakespeare in Love\\".  The main characters are portrayed by the crème de la crème of British geriatric heavyweights so you expect no less than perfection and that's what you get.  The film is deliberately paced but not slow so viewers should allow for it to gain momentum for maximum satisfaction.  I highly recommend this film with little to no reservations.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|I didn't give it 5 stars because it is a little predictable but then you knew that didn't you?<br /><br />Downey is awesome as Holmes. The other actors are very good too. Actually the wrap up (as opposed to the actual end of the movie) was unexpected I thought.<br /><br />The special effects are cool. I don't think I fully appreciated them in the first movie. I wasn't aware there was a ummm point to them - it's part of the story which I've never read. Yes I'm trying not to spoil the movie.<br /><br />I would have been disappointed if I'd paid $20 for it but I think it is worth $10. I will watch it several more times I am sure.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|My YouTube won't work so I got an app it doesn't freeze or anything and on kindle fire HD it's more HD
B0090SI582|4.0|I am a  X Men fan; especially when it comes to the comic books. I was uber excited when I found out that the classic Wolverine in Japan story line would be the basis for this film. And surprisingly enough, after the barely tolerable mess that 2009's X Men Origins Wolverine was, this movie goes to show that improvements can always be made.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman returns yet again as Wolverine in what seems like his 100th time, but is ultimately his 7th time. And I gotta say, he put on quite the performance this time around. When I say he played the part to perfection in this movie, I MEAN IT. He brings the necessary brutality, the depression, the aggression, and overall force to the character. Famke Janseen makes minor appearances as Jean Grey. We also have a whole new cast of people some of you may or may not have heard of. Tao Okamoto portrays Mariko, Brian Tee plays Noburo, Rila Fukushima portrays  Yukio, and we also have a Russian actress by the name of Svetlana Khodchenkova who plays one of the movie's antagonists, Viper. The cast was excellent.<br /><br />Story wise, if you have read the full Japanese comic story involving Wolverine, then you know exactly what you are in for. And as a movie, The Wolverine brings the action, the unexpected and enjoyable humor, and the dramatic tone needed for the movie.<br /><br />In my honest opinion, although Wolverine is a X Men, this movie feels more like a stand alone film. But for the movie as a whole that is a good thing. The Wolverine did not fall flat at all. It is really engaging, and again much MUCH better than the 2009 Origins film. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes the X Men movies (specifically 1,2 and First Class) and especially to anyone who is a TRUE Wolverine fan. I myself will be buying this on blu ray when it comes out; and I do hear that there is to be an unrated cut of the movie as well. Out of 5 possible stars, The Wolverine gets a score of:<br /><br />4 Stars<br /><br />PLEASE stay tuned during the credits for a scene that will lead to further anticipation for next yearuring the credits for a scene that will lead to further anticipation for next year
B001DU8T6I|1.0|When I received the album it was broken.I didn't pay for a broken cased album! The description box didn't say anything about a broken case when i was about to purchase it.I am not a happy customer.How can I get a refund or if not an album that isn't broken?
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 is full of surprises and shocking events. Must see for everyone! I can't wait for the next season.
B005JABN8Y|5.0|great thing, i spent half day to finish this, and the thing is great, love thousand sunny , love one piece
B0074AGVWK|3.0|Finished this in a couple of days whilst on holiday.  Not the best Binchy I've read but entertained me as a light read.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love this game! I have it on my ipod touch and the original for my DS. I recommend this to puzzle lover's!! Plus there is a free play mode where you can create and do whatever you want!! It's SOOO amazing!!!!
B0000069CT|4.0|what was there was great.  But I was expecting the full movement.  Next time I order I will know.<br />This was my first CD ordered on-line.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Tom Cruise and Mary J Blige stole the show.  I highly recommend this movie to all true rock fans.  Two thumbs up!
B00CLIJ9A6|5.0|Quartet wins my vote of the best movie of its year.  Dustin Hoffman's direction is extraordinary.  He never lingers too long on sadness without making us laugh.  Never too long on lightness without letting us know these old people are on their last lap.  Because he musicians in this movie are from the real life English musical landscape, their presence in the retirement home adds a big dose of reality.  The four lead actors carry the story beautifully, each down now and then, each encouraging the others when they can.  Just go.  No matter your age, this is what good moviemaking is all about.
B00979CS50|5.0|This 2012 release featuring Crazy Horse has that familiar grungy sound, with marathon length songs that never seem to tire; instead, they keep on rocking with many guitar changes and plentiful lyrics. While this album isn't Neil's best with Crazy Horse, I still give it high marks (4.5 stars), because these are thoughtful jams that stay with you long after listening. I really enjoyed RAMADA INN, DRIFTIN' BACK, and BORN IN ONTARIO. This album is on par with Sleeps With Angels, but not as good as Ragged Glory. I recommend this album. 9/10
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|Upon starting the game, my phone starts vibrating and won't stop until I kill the process.  The options don't provide a way to stop the vibration.  It's battery draining and making my hand go numb.  Perhaps I can use it as a massager.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I LOVD THIS MOVIE IT IS A GREAT MOVIE FOR CERTAIN SITUATIONS LOKE THIS. I WOULD CONSIDER YOU TO WATCH THIS MOVIE.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|The author seeks to balance the Jesus of the gospels with the \\"historic Jesus.\\" It is important for readers to know this, as it impacts the possible reception of the book.<br /><br />As a believer in Christianity, I hold the words of the Bible in high regard, believing scripture to be true. \\"All scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.\\" (2 Timothy 3:16-17 ESV)<br /><br />On the other hand, the author of this book is forced to quote scripture in attempting to discredit it, in favor of what he calls the \\"historical\\" version of events.<br /><br />Due to the fact that most of the writings about Jesus that have survived from antiquity are canonized in the Christian Bible, this presents a problem for academics such as the professor authoring this book.  Even non-canonical works from the period of the early Christian church are problematic for the professor, as they are infused with spiritual mysticism that most assuredly is not written as contemporary views of history seek to do.<br /><br />To his credit, Aslan acknowledges these shortcomings early on in his book, preparing the reader for his slicing and dicing of scriptural references.<br /><br />Due to a worldview that is substantially different from that of the author, it gets annoying having him denounce parts of the Bible as \\"outlandish,\\" \\"patently absurd,\\" \\"troublesome,\\" and \\"inaccurate.\\"  However, despite my annoyance with his treatment of what I consider Holy Scripture, he presents some information I found fascinating.<br /><br />Other men, both contemporaries of Jesus Christ, and those that came before and after him, are mentioned as claiming to be messiahs.  One known only as \\"The Egyptian,\\" another as \\"The Samaritan,\\" Hezekiah, Simon of Peraea, Judas the Galilean, Menahem, Simon son of Giora, and Simon son of Kochba are all written about in this book as having messianic ambitions.<br />Those wishing to know more about the religious views of Jews at the time of Jesus will find something to learn by reading this book.<br /><br />I read this book as an advanced reader's copy uncorrected proof. This review copy was provided by the publisher in exchange for a fair and honest review.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|This story is in the same genre as the other Volrkosigan books.  It is a good read and a good addition to my collection of Bujold stories.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I enjoyed this book from the beginning to the end. Easy read and engaging book. It keeps you guessing all the way through.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|I appreciate J.Cole continuing to deliver his own feel by making his beats and not conforming to who is popular. I'm simply going to enjoy his growth and delivery. The lyrics are great and putting a nice radio feel to it but has MIC cred.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I wasn't sure if this would fit my Kindle.  My last cord literally fell apart, for no reason.  I purchased this one as a replacement and it fits perfect.  Now I can download and read away!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Wow excellent read. If you are a Wheel of Time or Game of Thrones/A song if Ice and fire fan. Then this book is for you.
0060763280|3.0|I like the great quotes and advice. Yes I would recommend this book to others. I like this book so get it.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I watched the Broadway show first time last week during my family’s NY vacation at Majestic Theater. It’s a wonderful show and I was so moved by the performance. After we came home, my husband and I went to Amazon web site to search what Blu–ray we could buy. I am so glad we found this one which we are able to see the facial expression of the performers which I was not able to see when I was in the theater and we had a better view than we had in our seats in the theater. We really enjoyed Andrew Lloyd Webber’s extra tribute at the end. Amazon also included the Video On Demand version as a gift so we were able to watch it before receiving it. What a great surprise; thank you, Amazon!
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I'm glad it had a happy ending, I'm glad there are more books to continue the family story...  The build up to the conflict was long in comparison to the conflict itself, then the sweet but quick ending...  Overall though, it was a good read.
B0028RXXFC|4.0|Understanding that the producers took some artistic license to expand the story, we thought the series provided a pretty accurate depiction of life at that time.  Take note of the other reviews on violence, sex, nudity as this is definitely strong R-rated material.  I didn't think it was gratuitous but an effort to be accurate to life at the time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game I play it all the only thing I would change is only having one of the characters for a certain amount of time before they go away from the game
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great mind candy for a quick read! I was disappointed to not have some issues resolved at the end, but I am looking forward to the next novel!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Great game... hours of fun. Downloaded it just because I was curious but it's addictive now. It's a must to have
B009O07NBQ|5.0|Really love this CD.  Loved the movie HAD to have the music<br />My Granddaughter (13) borrowed it to listen to while reading the book.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Another fine game, with terrific graphics!  G5 has another hit on their hands here. I enjoyed hours of game play, with difficult puzzles and HOS scenes. Once again, there is a hint button, and also a map showing areas for action. If that isn't enough and you need more help, there is a guide with step-by-step instructions for each scene of the game. If you've enjoyed previous G5 games, you'll want to get this one too.
B003Y5T0X6|4.0|Pretty good, We just went to Universal Studios and Twister expeince was pretty good, even though we had nver watched the movie. Really good movire, good story and pretty darn good special effects for that timeframe.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game!It is so fun because you can rescue animals and set them free. And you can get dinosaurs!It is a really epic game!
B00D6SBOWG|1.0|DO NOT DOWNLOAD AND ATTEMPT TO PLAY. INITIAL TIMES YOU TRY TO OPEN, GAME FREEZES AND YOUR SYSTEM SHUTS DOWN TO REBOOT (IF LUCKY). UNABLE TO PLAY ON KINDLE FIRE.
B00CO52NLI|3.0|You have to spend money, and it lagged my kindle out. But I do recommend it to people with 70 dollars. Well it's kinda enjoyable. So I don't know what to say,really.
B00821OX98|4.0|Somewhat original. Decent effects. Overall I like it and will watch the rest of the seasons offered with my prime membership.
B009AJD5E0|4.0|Prometheus was a good movie but it got vilent in the end!<br /> the computer animation as great but i did not like the ending.
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|Bastille is &#34;the Find&#34; of 2013.  Dan Smith has a fantastic voice! These guys are going places. check 'em out!
B003XDUCIG|4.0|Although I am a geek, I'm not a scientist and this book was really geared more towards chemistry majors as much of it went above my head.  That being said, what I did understand was fascinating.  If you like Alton Brown you'll love this book because it takes that scientific approach to cooking to the next level.<br /><br />Presented like a computer manual, each chapter examines a function of cooking such as the hardware, software, variables and methods involved.  In these chapters celebrities and food luminaries are interviewed for their unique perspective on the subject and recipes demonstrating the concepts are also included.<br /><br />The book is densely packed with information and if you understand college chemistry and physics you'll get much more out of this book then I did because I struggled remembering the details of chemical bonds and Kelvin.  Even with those limits, I still struggled with the onslaught of information explaining different tasting patterns and flavor combinations and had to read some chapters more than once.  This isn't  light fluffy reading but it's really worth it in the end.<br /><br />After this book I was much more empowered to experiment with my cooking and cooking methods and understand why I like certain foods, combinations and cooking methods and why I dislike others.  This is the science behind the art of cooking.
B003JH8LPW|1.0|can we say 0 stars? I read this some years ago and I can forgive the technical errors, but what makes this book worse? the way the female lead is portrayed. I was insulted at how stupid she sounded and acted. REALLY? it was an insult to intelligent women everywhere. I was so disgusted with this book that if I had read it before Angels and Demons or the DeVinci Code, I would not have read anything else by him.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Renting a movie is so easy and the variety of selection is fantastic.  Nice to have a great selection.  Thanks
B00821OX98|4.0|oddly enjoyable tv show.  Started watching it to have something on in the background and got totally sucked in, word.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I won an iPad mini in March, and gave it to my husband. About a week later he found this app, and I fell in love with it then! Beautiful graphics from start to finish including the competition s, which is rare in horse games. I would/will recommend this app to everyone!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is a very handy app to have at your fingertips. I don't open the dictionary frequently but I find myself using this app more and more often. Easy to use yet practical.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I found this book very hard to get into and boring. I made it to Chapter 5 and gave up.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Very interesting and interwoven story,  and the ending was with a difference.  I enjoyed the read immensely and recommend the read.
140006922X|5.0|Reza Aslan has proved himself to be a thoughtful, rational human being whose hard-work as an academic has entitled him to cast a scholarly eye over whatever he wishes. I look forward to being further enlightened by your well-informed writings.
B000002J0B|5.0|Maybe the best three song streak on any Zeppelin album can be found here; \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", \\"The Rain Song\\", \\"Over the Hills and Far Away.\\" TSRTS, a great, energetic opener that sets the pace for the album exquisitely, and when it comes to musical beauty, it's hard to top \\"The Rain Song\\". John Paul Jones' beautiful mellotron orchestra always makes me feel a bit misty.<br /><br />And OTHAFA is my favorite song, period. Those three tracks alone would make for a great album, but the fun doesn't stop there. \\"The Crunge\\" is a great, funky little number, \\"Dancing Days\\" and \\"The Ocean\\" are excellent and then there's the track that would become one of their best live showcases \\"No Quarter.\\"<br /><br />It might be easy to overlook the studio version of \\"Quarter\\" having been inundated with the various live performances that range anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes in length & the jazzy, improvisational piano & guitar jams of those performances were some of Zeppelin's finest on the stage, but that shouldn't take away from the greatness packed with those seemingly brief 7 minutes found here on \\"Houses.\\"<br /><br />There's a very dark & mysterious edge to it that seemingly is in contrast to the rest of the album, but it only adds a different kind of spice to what is a very satisfying dish. When it comes to Led Zeppelin, there is none better than \\"Houses of the Holy.\\"
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The first half of this book was great but then it drifted off in too many directions which were not  relevant to the story.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|I'm pretty new to the Rush game, having been a fan for only about 6 or 7 years, but I quickly became inundated with most of their studio output & not long after that discovered what a powerhouse they were (and still are) as a live band.<br /><br />This may be my favorite Rush concert yet, the setlist is tremendous, combining the then new material from the excellent album \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" and blending in their more familiar staples such as \\"Tom Sawyer\\", \\"Freewill\\", \\"Distant Early Warning\\", \\"The Spirit of Radio\\" and pulling out an old, but very good and underplayed song such as \\"Between the Wheels.\\"<br /><br />I liked \\"Time Machine Tour\\", loved the \\"Grace Under Pressure\\" concert & \\"Rush in Rio\\", but \\"Snakes And Arrows\\" live tops them all. I can only hope the forthcoming \\"Clockwork Angels\\" tour can kick as much butt as this one.<br /><br />5 stars no doubt.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|My wife and I have a hard time finding good shows that we both enjoy. Downton Abbey is great show with an excellent story. It provides great entertainment.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Fast shipping, good product and will definitely recommend also great pricing over all thank you so much for getting it to me
B00DFFI7K2|2.0|I enjoyed the 1st two of these movies as entertainment.  This one though just has way too many holes in the plot (if there is a plot).  Blowing stuff up doesn't save this one.  Made for 10 year Olds. (Lots of violence)  Rent.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|Good Science Fiction about an alien landing in the Viking days with a creature in tow. He loses his &#34;modern&#34; weapon and must deal with the creature using what the Vikings used. Action moves right along and the Newfoundland scenery is spectacular.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Fun and zanney fun use of story and environment with gravity around planets. Lots of fun for everyone I must own for any puzzler
0062235893|5.0|This was a gift and perfect for a small child. Mother loved and the packaging was great.<br />Would buy again for gift!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|The items in the puzzles don't always work for me when I want them to, but I am enjoying the challenges of these puzzles so far.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Never thought a story set in India would capture my attention. Tom Wilkinson, Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Celia Imrie, Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton....could it get any better!! Simply splendid acting.
140006922X|5.0|Reza Aslan is able to do two things which are individually remarkable, and in combination perhaps unique.<br /><br />- provide a credible, erudite, historical overview of the historical facts that were recorded.<br />- do so in a way which is vivid, accessible and often inspiring.<br /><br />P.S. to non-Muslims, this is definitely not the Muslim viewpoint!
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Pretty absorbing, but I would have liked our main character to have had a more interesting life after such an interesting beginning.
1781162646|5.0|i've read a lot pf his books but i enjoyed this one much more than them all of the others
B000QCS8TW|3.0|An absorbing saga, and it pulls you in, but the brutality depicted seems to be more than needed to tell the tale.
B009MYARIK|1.0|The storyline wasn't clever or cute like her previous books. The characters weren't charming or lovable. This was a terrible waste of a read. Sigh, shame because I have enjoyed most or mostly enjoyed her previous books. I'll think twice on buying a book from her. This book was as bad as her M. Wickham books which I find very hard to read because they're quite awful.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Found this story written through a dogs eyes very enjoyable, both touching and sad.<br />Loved the ending when he meets Enzo once again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the show!  Can't wait till the new season arrives - I'm addicted.  An interesting look at the relationships between the servants and the aristocrats of the time.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are so inventive and we can't get enough of them. Very different, but wonderful music. Hope we hear more of them!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Loved it. This gives more proof of life after death. This will bring peace to whoever reads it. Enjoy it.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|This music touches all your emotions & I just love the ending when the lead singers from all over the world sing together.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Wonderful characters who pull the readers into the story and into the war realizing that  good and the evil are always present and not always as one expects them to be.
B000VDUWMC|4.0|It has a very interesting point of view of the history. However, applying the logic in the book, a lot of facts remain un-explained.
B009WUBERW|4.0|A who's who of past action stars. A little cheesy but still fun to watch. Plenty of laughs and lots of action. Can be a little bloody and plenty violent. Not suitable for young kids. If you liked the first one you will like this one.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I thought this book's topic was something different than what it was. I am not much into the supernatural, mystic type books. Although I do like some time traveler books.<br /><br />The writing was okay, but I noticed typos and extra words.<br /><br />Just not my type of book.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|A very enjoyable puzzle game with a challenge. I love puzzle games so when I saw this was the FAOD I picked it up. It never hurts to pick up the free apps cause you never know when you would need or like it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|me and my daughter love playing this game. We switch between each other trying to get to the end. Download this game.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Ang Lee did it again. We love magical realism and this is it at it's finest. Great movie to watch with your older kids.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Can't wait to read book 3 which I have already downloaded. I have finished 2 books in two nights lol. Say punch a great book!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis was fantastic! The screenplay was well written and acted, well Lewis did win best actor for his role. Need I say more?
B00AYMKUOK|4.0|While not the most riveting of the series so far, it does clear up some questions, but poses many more.  The structure, parallel with the preceding book, Storm of Swords, is a little confusing.  The ending was unexpected, but in keeping with Martin's penchant for dealing with major characters.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|What a waste of a good $5. We were so excited to see this movie and it not only didn't meet our expectations, it sucked.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Bradley Cooper gave a rich and dynamic performance. He's one to watch over the coming decades. DeNiro was great of course. Jennifer Lawrence was electric. Sexy and damaged.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Probably one of the best films we've seen all summer! If you are GenX or even a young baby boomer, this is a great film to send you back to your past. It deals with some sensitive subjects, but we all dealt with them when we were teens.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The end was a little unbelievable but all in all this was a good read. I had a hard time putting it down.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|If you are into British Films, although this was Dustin Hoffman's baby, then this is a must see. It is full of real and retired former musicians and singers. No, Maggie Smith did not sing opera or really even lip sync, but still a fantastic film.
B00BAXTYF8|5.0|I have been a Trekkie for the longest time!  This movie is full of all the action and adventure expected of it!  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys science fiction.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I am reading the whole series in succession. I love the stories and all of the action that takes place.  It makes you feel like you are there.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|Wow, I only hate that I waited so long to get around to this series. Thought provoking existentialism at its finest. This is just a great philosophical story that adds so much information to the movie. The movie gets all the attention and is beautiful in its simplicity, but this just takes the participant as close to an understanding as it can. Highly recommend.

B002SSUQFG|3.0|While I like the way the watch looks and I like the band.  I am disappointed that you must wear this watch everyday (or shake it for 30 seconds) or it stops working until you wear it again.  Many years ago I had a self winding watch (they call this automatic but I think it is the same thing), that I could leave off my hand for a few days and it would still have the correct time.  This is not true with this watch.  I originally gave this watch one star but have since upgraded to three stars.  What I suspect the problem is that I am not as active as I used to be.  So, my current recommendation is that this is a great watch for people that walk a lot or at least move their watch hand a lot each day or else I would recommend a regular quartz crystal battery operated watch.

B002OSY2T6|5.0|This toy was a savior when my son was refusing to do tummy time at 3 months of age. The moment he saw the face light up, a smile swept over his face and it has been his favorite floor toy ever since (now 7 months old). Day after day he plays with \\"Shelly\\" and loves swatting him to spark the music and lights. Having a mirror on the shell is an awesome feature, too. This is one, happy toy!

B00D23GXB2|5.0|What an lovely, emotional ride through images of beauty and it's associates. The mind these poems come from is not simple, nor is it one track - no matter how entrenched it is in the joys of physical intercourse. I won't go into the descriptions of the author as a great poet - that's obvious. I will simply say, read as you would read about any pleasurable journey, without judgement or fear. after all, it is his journey, not yours and it's nice of him to share it with you.

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Wow! So I have heard of this book years ago & it's my first time reading it. It has opened my eyes to love. I thought I knew love is action but didn't know the depth of that. This book has helped me be a better partner as we look towards marriage. I feel blessed that I learned about the 5 love languages prior to the I do 's.

B00BR9ULKM|5.0|This is perhaps one of the most well-written autobiographies I've read.  The pace and tempo were perfect.  Arnold shared so of the most intimate details of his life and experience.  He takes the reader through and extraordinary journey from his humble beginnings in Austria to his arrival at the California governor's office (he chose not to live in the governor's mansion).  The reader will learn things about movie making and politics as well as the world of bodybuilding competition.  While reading this book the reader gets the sense that Arnold is truthful and humble.  He makes it no secret that he wanted to become rich and after becoming rich he enjoyed be so.  I've always liked him movies.  I remember when I was 14 years old some friends and I saw his movie \\"Hercules in New York\\" and I thought it was one of the best movies I'd ever seen.  If you haven't seen that movie, trust me, Arnold has come a long way as an actor.  Anyway, I highly recommend this book.  After reading it, you will come away feeling that you actually got to know him and he's been a dear friend for a long time.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I hope there's a chapter 2 and if there is going to be a chapter 2 make sure slender man is not walking my friend play hard and he could not collect all 8 pages I suggest this game to people there is easy, normal, and hard and 2 different lvls the road and the farm.
B00D37UP4S|4.0|This movie skipped some pretty important parts from the book but overall it was pretty good.  The actors were very good so the lines came across as genuine and heartfelt which helped to convey their desperation during trying times. I thought they handled the voices in the head scenes as well as can be expected.... That's just difficult to put on screen.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've been a Science Fiction reader for more than 45 years, and wool reminds me of the very best of the golden age Science Fiction with a modern edge.  The author manages to capture human beings in very complex and modern situations, but manages to keep us from having to know every detail of their intimate lives, and without having to resort to graphic depictions of violence or sex.  I personally appreciate that - what is implied is clear, and when it is needed to advance the storyline, it's in there, but not in such a way as to slap you in the face.<br /><br />I can add little more to what everyone else has said.  This is an utterly engaging and well plotted story that has a lot of layers.  I am starting Shift now, and look forward to that.<br /><br />Thanks to the author for his hard work, and for offering the Omnibus edition at such a reasonable price.  It was well done, and he has my loyalty as a reader for whatever he wants to put out there.

You play a tape to your computer and you can burn it to CD.<br /><br />Be sure you get on the internet for the software and instructions. I think they were written by someone who not only did not understand the language, but had also never seen the unit.<br /><br />The down side to the unit, You do get some noise interference in some of the recordings, also my player will start playing a tape and somewhere in the middle reverse itself.<br /><br />Be sure you listen to your recordings before you consider them complete.

0812993845|2.0|I've read a few of Sophie Kinsella's books. The Undomestic Goddess was by far my favorite. It was quick witted and told a cute story. I don't expect these types of commercial books to be deep and intellectual. But, I do want them to make sense. There were too many people involved, I actually had to write everyone down to keep track. I also didn't love how from start to finish the entire book was based on one mis-communication after another. Although I didn't love it, I will keep reading her.

B007549YM4|3.0|War is hell and surviving a nuclear inferno seems to be the worst part of war. Being trapped in a shelter with desperate people seems to step up the turture and show us all how disturbing and ugly we can be. This perspective is disgusting and dark with little point or plot but survival. Maybe the point of the movie was to show how the victims and pawns of war don't really need to have a point or purpose from the lowest perspective other then to do what your supposed to do SUFFER AND DIE.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|Disc 1: a classic and no other comments required<br />Disc 2: live recording - very enjoyable, I actually listen to it more that disc 1<br />Disc 3: interesting and the only weak spot

B005CRQ4N8|4.0|Overall The Tales of Beedle the Bard are a wonderful collection of stories from the Wizarding World.<br /><br />The Wizard and the Hopping Pot initially comes across as a \\"What comes around goes around\\" story but when 1 takes a deeper look at it you can clearly see the wizard-muggle issues Dumbledore refers to in his notes. Interestingly,Bellatrix Bloxan's objections to this story as told in Dumbledore's notes reminds of the adults who object to even older children/teens reading/watching certain books/movies,including Harry Potter because the subject matter isn't all happy and light hearted. Bloxan's desire to keep everything \\"pure,sweet,happy etc.\\" is reminiscent of the adults/parents who go way too far in \\"protecting\\" their children from sad,heavy,or unpleasant subjects. The alternate version taught to some wizarding children by anti muggle parents was interesting as well as you see how people can twist stories to fit their own ends. We also get a look in the notes at how far back the Malfoy family's pure blood mania goes back as we see an excerpt from Brutas Malfoy cleary showing anti muggle views. Another interesting take. And in the story itself,the detail is fantastic. Notice that we are told exactly what woes the villagers are going through and we are given good specifics for the pot's behavior. 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />The Fountain of Fair Fortune is my favorite of the Tales of Beedle the Bard. One great thing about this story is that our characters triumph through effort,thought,and character rather than on pure magicial ability. Note that Harry ultimately triumphed over Voldemort at the end of Deathly Hallows in spite of being far weaker magically. In fact,Harry's magical power was far weaker than Hermione's,let alone Voldemort's But his heart and strength of character got him through in the end. (And I LOVED how Harry NEVER attempted Avada Kedavra not even against Voldemort.) Note that as we progess,Asha's emotion,Altheda's encouragement,all of their effort,Amata's logic,and Altheda's quick thought that get them through. While Asha's and Altheda's situations were clearly far worse than Amata's and we don't know as much about the knight,it was great to see all of them triumph through their own strength. As we saw with Harry in the main series,magic is a useful tool,but it shouldn't be relied on too much. Effort,intellegence,and character got them through. The is also the story in the Tales of Beedle with the most vivid imagery and it's unfortunate that we'll never see this story come to life th way we did The Tale of the Three Brothers in DHP1 because it would fantastic to see. 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />The Warlock's Hairy heart is the 1 story in this series I can't say much about. I didn't care for it when I 1st read it and I usually skip this one. This one didn't appeal to me at all.<br /><br />Babbity Rabbity and the Cackling stump is a fantastic story on many levels. Dumbledore's notes talk about the story's consistency with magic and the lesson that bringing the dead back to life is impossible. I however,look at it more from the perspective of showing the dangers of power hungriness. The king wanted to be magical,and to be the only magical person his power hungriness shamed him after he couldn't perform magic and the charlatan's order to destroy babbity didn't go as planned. The king created a shame for himself by being too power hungry. 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />The Tale of the Three Brothers is the most well known of the Tales of Beedle the Bard because of the full text being put into the DH novel and the wonderful animated version in DHP1. The idea od death being an actual \\"thing\\" and of thse legendary objects being Death's gift's is such a fascinating idea. I must admit that I do not share Dumbleodre's view of death. I completely disagreed with Dumbledore in SS when he said the stone was not such a wonderful thing. Yes,the stone needed to be destroyed for the needs of the many in the story,but I'vealways seen the stone as a great thing in and of itself. If I could get a Sorcerer's Stone&lt;I certainly would. I see immortality in and of itself as only a good thing. (The only reason why immortality might not be desirable in my view is that as you get older your walking,breathing,sight,and hearing all weaken. But for me I'd rather have a frail life than no life at all.) But having acknowledged this,the thing I really liked about this tale is that the humblest brother is the 1 that had the best outcome. The 1st 2 brothers had a high level of arrogance and both quickly paid the price with quick deaths. The 3rd brother,the only 1 who had any humility,was the 1 who had the best outcome and I liked that. The humblest are usually the wisest. I also like the DH connection to this story (Remember that the 3rd Peverell brother of the original owners of the Hallows that inspired this story turned out to be an ancestor of Harry Potter himself and Harry's invisibility cloak turned out to be the 1 refered to in this tale.) Dumbledore's notes on the history of the Elder wand also go to the humility issue. Note the \\"unbeatable\\" wand has been beaten many times.  But every next owner of the Elder Wand the same arrogance. Note too that at the end of DH,the humble Harry is the 1 who chooses NOT to keep it for himself. Again,the humblest are the wisest. A really good story and a fabulous depiction in the DHP1 movie. 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Overall the Tales of Beedle the Bard are a wonderful supplement to a hardcore Harry Potter fan's reading and since I liked 4 out the 5 stories,I think the appropriate rating from me is 4 out of 5 stars.always seen the stone as a great thing in and of itself.

B008NQYWC0|4.0|Who has never daydreamed about going back into the past and making changes, either larger or small. Going to a different college, marrying that other person, moving to that dreamed of city.<br /><br />Steven King, at an age where such musings take on a heightened dimension, goes even further in his latest novel, \\"11/22/63\\". Suppose you went back and prevented President John F. Kennedy from getting killed as he motorcaded through Dallas, Texas on that awful day.<br /><br />It is an article of faith among more progressive Americans that had Kennedy survived Lee Harvey Oswald's bullet, he never would have sanctioned the war in Vietnam. Our national history and character would have then followed a more benign path. Without giving away the ending, King puts a big gaping bullet hole in that theory, and it's not what you think. It will be worth remembering that his alternative history was co-written by famed historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, whose husband was a Kennedy aide.<br /><br />\\"11/22/63\\" will undoubtedly resonate more with the Boomer generation who knew exactly where they were on November 22, 1963 (I was in 8th grade Shop Class). However the story doesn't begin there. The protagonist, Jake Epping, a high school English teacher in a small town in Maine, is shown a time travel portal that exists in the pantry of the local diner. Going through it deposits him back to September, 1958 and when Jake initially travels, his primary desire is to prevent the gruesome murder of the family of a fellow co-worker, in this case the school janitor whose GED essay breaks Epping's heart.<br /><br />This episode, which takes up nearly a third of the book, has the thrilling effect of taking the reader back to the world of the late 1950's when King himself was in elementary school. There is a charming quality to the detail which is less cynical than \\"Mad Men\\". It seems like a happier, slower way of life, covered in cigarette smoke but free of the attention-deficit cyber and cell phone frenzies that now dominates our lives.<br /><br />Epping, living in the past under the name of George Amberson, eventually moves to the mythical town of Jodie, Texas, where he is warmly welcomed by the type of Texans one remembers from \\"Saturday Night Lights\\". Quirky but kind, decent small town folks. There he falls passionately in love with Sadie, the school librarian, and that's where his dilemma begins. He is now on a mission to shadow and prevent Oswald from his murderous deed and has to either bring Sadie in (and risk telling her his true identity) or push her away.<br /><br />There is also the Past which is \\"Obdurate and doesn't to change\\" as Epping/Amberson repeatedly finds out. King holds this as his central theme and it is handled deftly with the kind of intelligence that makes you spend an hour on one page as your own mind goes exploring deep and mighty thoughts.<br /><br />Despite its length, King tells the tale without his usual clutter of too many people or an overwhelming amount of back story. This is one of his few books without monsters, evil clowns, or demonic entities (Derry, Maine does provide a post-\\"It\\" setting). The most malevolent force is the past itself and it tries to prevent our hero from achieving his goals for perfectly sane reasons. Oswald himself is presented as a pathetic character who in the end, surrenders to his own hidden demons. Until then, he is a family man who acts perpetually unanchored. King surrenders to the thread that Oswald is, indeed, the lone gunman although there are enough teasers to keep the Conspiracy Theorists happy.<br /><br />Which brings us back to \\"What if?\\" Historians have gone crazy over that question forever. We mortals go through our own perplexity dealing with personal lifetime journeys. \\"11/22/63\\" brings both to the fore in a wildly accessible and enjoyable story, the best King has written in years,renzies that now dominates our lives.<br /><br />Epping, living in the past under the name of George Amberson, eventually moves to the mythical town of Jodie, Texas, where he is warmly welcomed by the type of Texans one remembers from \\"Saturday Night Lights\\".

B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but like others said, I got less.  Don't get me wrong, it had some funny parts, but good grief was this movie drawn out.  I literally fast forwarded to the end through the last 15 minutes of the movie because it was pretty obvious how it would end.  Some scenes were just absolutely meaningless.  I felt like I was watching a directors cut, before editing.  Overall, I wouldn't waste your time with this one.

This movie takes the cake. It's got more 'loops' and self-references than I've ever seen. Absolutely brilliant script, and exquisite cinematography. This was the movie that convinced me that Brad Pit was far far more than a pretty-boy, and could actually make me BELIEVE he was someone else. Incredible all-around film!

B000FCKGPC|5.0|In keeping with the earlier books in this series this is a can't put down read.  Can't wait to get to the next book.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Wonderful summer read... On a sunny or rainy day. Great characters and a horrifying insight into slavery. Make sure you have some tissues handy.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I have been a fan of George R.R.Martin since I started reading &#34;The Hedge Knight&#34; a few years ago.  The high production values and inspired acting make this show a credit to Martin's creativity.  He created an alternate universe that is so fantastic and yet so believable, and this show brings it to life.
B00AALX5SI|4.0|Great background on Katy and how she got to where she is today. Shows how the music industry today is all about fitting people into molds they like, instead of being who they are.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Great camera bag with a lot of room.  It protects all my equipment well (actually, I have a Nikon D5000 and a Nikon J2) and it is big enough to put both in with the multiple lenses and flashes (well, for the D5000).  I have taken it all over and it is great.<br /><br />Why four stars?  The pull on the zipper says &#34;Amazon Basics&#34; and I wasn't crazy about that.  yeah, I know that's the brand, but it kind of screams &#34;CHEAPSKATE&#34; to me and I have had a couple of people ask about that.  I may be a bit vain, but I wish it didn't have that on the pull....
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed the challenge of finding clues and opening different ways to get the elevator doors open. Looking forward to more challenges in the future.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fantastic game! I love little time wasters like this lol. too bad there weren't any more rooms. hopefully they come soon!!!!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|The story was somewhat predictable but loved the characters. A fun movie to forget about the world and its ills. Looking forward to the next.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I liked learning information about the Orphan Train of which I knew very little.  It was a little difficult to keep the characters straight at the beginning.  The resilience that the characters showed was amazing and I sometimes I wondered if a child would have actually handled the life they experienced and then be a productive adult.  I learned more facts about the Orphan Train from the author's notes. i
140006922X|5.0|Aslan gives a very thorough examination of the life of Jesus.  The subject is not diminished, in fact, he is celebrated.  But, Aslan delves into the social aspects of what Jesus did, his purpose, and why his life led to its conclusion.  Anyone, religious or otherwise, can gain some great understanding of what should be the basis of one of the dominate religions in our world, but perhaps also allows one to see where this religion often falls down in that regard.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|The beginning few levels are good and if it gets harder it will keep me entertained. Because it asks for a review so early it gets a 4
B008JFUNYG|3.0|Evil Dead is my favorite horror flick of all time and when I heard it was being remade I was worried, but when I also heard Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi were involved I was very interested.  After watching the Evil Dead remake I was pleased and dissapointed at the same time, the effects were great, welcomed and well done for any real horror fans, the scares were good, the plot was good but kind of failed compared to the classic version, and the ending I really didn't like which I wont spoil.  Alot of classic moments from Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 were touched on but not played through enough for my tastes.  I bought the DVD and will watch it many more times but it did not have the magic or logic of the real Evil Dead.
B0015DWLD0|2.0|Nothing great about the book .. It is dragging for the most part .. It starts out promising, but soon gets boring and tedious .. More importantly, the book betrays the tone it sets in the first chapter .. It was supposed to be an interesting tale of the protagonist's entrepreneurial acumen .. Instead it degenerates into a weak gimmicky story .. In a word .. Meh
0891419195|5.0|Great read---could not put it down.  Unlike the movies that glamorize their war stories, Sledge puts it out there as a &#34;grunt&#34; in the thick of ti!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is so easy to setup and just works. I cant believe it is only 35 dollars, everything streams perfectly for me and the video quality is great. It's a great product at a stunning price why wouldn't someone buy this.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Sorry....should have left a great thing alone...used to love going to your site...now it is just one big commercial and what is with the points...for kids!
B000P0J0A6|5.0|What a great movie, but don't let the little ones watch it!  This was released BEFORE PG-13 was created and was one of three movies which created enough outrage to create PG-13.  It is a great movie, but the mother kills a bunch of Gremlins gone bad in a series of very visually disturbing (for young kids) ways - sticks one with a knife, puree's one in a blender and one is popped in a microwave!  BUT it is still a fabulous movie and holds up well over time.
B000F8O35U|5.0|When my daughter turned two she absolutely loved watching this movie. The sea witch was a little scary for her the first time, but a year later we still watch it and now it's not scary anymore. We go on the Disneyland ride all the time, and my daughter is now old enough to sing along with the songs. One of the best disney movies ever.
B00003CXWV|5.0|I purchased this movie for my daughter for Christmas. The price was very reasonable and the product is what I expected.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I found the book very interesting and well written. Nikola Tesla: Imagination and the Man That Invented the 20th Century seem to be well researched and well written.

B002ZM74Y6|4.0|Without significant plot twists, I am not sure a movie was worth it. I would have watched a documentary instead. However, I would recommend it for good screenplay and acting.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The story line is suspenseful. The live at Downtown Abbey is unpredictable. Anything can happen, anybody can die. You just can't outguess the writers. The costumes and acting are perfect. While watching the show I feel beamed back in time to 1920.
0385349947|5.0|A must read for MEN and WOMEN.<br /><br />I like the fact that it doesn't just look at the famous glass ceiling but talks more of hard facts and what WOMEN AND MEN can DO to improve our society for it to be more equal.
B000YMDQQ4|5.0|I enjoyed reading this, even some of the stories that appeared in other short story selections were worth a second read.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Gift for my mother who sang Oprah while hand washing the dishes as I grew up!  I think it is a great movie for those that are living just waiting to die and be with their loved ones that have gone on before them.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Leave it to the BBC to keep you engaged, this is a wonderful Series and a great way to see how life was, back in the day.  I can hardly wait for Season 4.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|We love this movie, it's a real feel good kinda flick, wonderful acting, funny and very touching.  I would recommend to friends and family.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Having the entire set in Bluray is great.  My kids can actually feel and see the originals.<br />The picture quality is even better than the theatres and I had worked as an usher for the original series release in the late 70's.<br />Price and delivery were great.  Will definitely buy other series for my movie collection.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|I would give this 5stars IF it had a tutorial on HOW to use the objects within each puzzle instead of &quot;it seems we are supposed to do something with this piece of paper&quot; just to give you an example.then the 2nd puzzle&quot;drop chemicals on to paper in right order&quot;with no clue what the order is,its a box full of colored bottles.I completed the 1st two by accident,VERY frustrating.I still dont know HOW I did them.I do puzzles all the time and have never had this much difficulty figuring out WHAT or HOW you are supposed to proceed<br />Iam going to keep at it because this has the potential of being a great game
B000I8HIV8|5.0|Just relax and enjoy it.  No need to pick on technicalities.<br />Fun and entertaining. One for the collection.  A keeper.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good game for the brain but sadly ends at floor 10. I wanted to keep going! Hoping an update brings more.
B008JFUO36|3.0|Two things struck me in the first hour of Universal's recent blockbuster Oblivion: The familiarity of its elements (at times iconic, at others cliché) and the degree of physicality in so thoroughly digital a production. The first of these I was prompted for, by reviews that cited a derivative spirit in the film with few citing exactly what its screenplay was deriving from, or explaining why the makers of Oblivion - or any film, for that matter - should be faulted for the practice. The second aspect was harder to put my finger on; so much has changed - and in ways improved - in VFX in these first years of digital's victory over photo-chemical film. Was the sense of physicality `just me', or was it also in the product, as a document of actual, and not merely (i.e., excessively) computer generated events? This sense of substantive record in the film does indeed concern its staging. More significantly, it also concerns the two marriages of the film: the superficially genuine, fundamentally phony one of soldier-laborer Jack Harper (Cruise) with the more clerical half of his &#34;effective team,&#34; Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), and his diegetically genuine, yet distractingly cosmetic marriage to a Russian astronaut by the name of Ruskova.   Exquisitely shot on the Cinealta F46 and Red Epic, Oblivion is one of the more visually arresting contributions to its genre, largely due to its reliance on natural light and exteriors. Even key interior scenes often feature exterior visuals against which actors perform in real time, and objects with reflective surfaces (numerous here) are shot without concern. Instead of employing green screen for the film's sky-high, glass house scenes, the F46's mechanical shutter allowed for flicker-free front projection of clouds, stars, etc  The cinematography also exploits Iceland's steely terrain and unusually long magic hour (from 6pm-1am, due to the island's northern position), yielding an embarrassment of landscape riches. It is primarily for this reason of exceptional staging and location - and despite occasionally rushed CGI - that it compares favorably with forebears The Quiet Earth (d. Geoff Murphy, 1984), Robinson Crusoe on Mars (d. Byron Haskin, 1964), The Omega Man (d. Boris Segal, 1971), Planet of the Apes (d. Franklin J. Schaffner, 1968), 2001: A Space Odyssey (d. Stanley Kubrick, 1968), Solaris (d. Andrei Tarkovsky, 1972), Zardoz (d. John Boorman, 1974), Demon Seed (d. Donald Cammell, 1977), Capricorn One (Peter Hyams, 1978), and Moon (d. Duncan Jones, 2009), as it claims little conceptual innovation. This is not necessarily a strike against the film - a characteristic of genre filmmaking is after all the repetition of form and theme - but it does command attention and perhaps a bit of research, and in this the many negative reviews, claiming weak writing, are remiss, and somewhat misleading. Excessive recourse to the grounding device (e.g., the dashboard bobble-head); exceedingly long action sequences (i.e., better suited to an action film, which this is not); the tired boomerism of Procol Harum's &#34;A Whiter Shade of Pale&#34;; the lithe, supermodel wife (former supermodel Olga Kurylenko, now the vaguely exotic/Eastern love interest of several films, including this one); Morgan Freeman as the go-to black elder statesman; the pat homecoming... The easy choices of the production are many, but their essential error of familiarity (i.e., convention) at the expense of internal realism is perhaps mistaken for something native to the film's achievement, precisely because it effectively combines so many now familiar sources. A patchwork of perennial science-fiction tropes (e.g., first contact, the lost civilization, the ascendant machine, simulacra & virtuality), Oblivion draws from each of the titles just cited in various ways, perhaps most obviously from the red-eyed computer/Cyclops of Kubrick's 2001', though most heavily from Jones' Moon, itself a sci-fi hybrid (its own sources 2001' andSolaris, as well as Silent Running, d. Douglas Trumball, 1972, Dark Star, d. John Carpenter, 1974, and some measure of his father's ballad to Britain's also-ran space program, &#34;Space Oddity&#34;). In another, more ironic parallel, Oblivion bears the title of a low budget space western from Charles Band's straight-to-video schlockmill, Full Moon Entertainment. Shot in Romania, Oblivion (d. Sam Irvin, 1994) takes place in the small town of Oblivion, on a distant planet on the interstellar frontier (in a nod to the Western expansion premise George Takei is one of a handful of bargain celebrities), and pivots on the mining exploits of an alien tyrant called &#34;Redeye.&#34; The makers of the blockbuster Oblivion were likely aware of echoing the earlier title, but the reason this wouldn't concern them, and the reasons they might claim obliviousness (alas) are interesting, as the original Oblivion is not only cheaply and shoddily produced, but woefully derivative, in a manner that makes the better conceived, funded, and mounted Oblivion appear inspired.   To return to the more substantial parallel, the protagonist's distance from the home world - whether spatial or temporal - is linked to the moon's destruction in Oblivion, and lunar mining in Duncan Jones' Moon, but the causal connection between the two sci-fi conceits is plain. What makes this connection curious - and potentially problematic - is the differing scale of each production, as Moon was astronomically cheaper, costing a mere $5 million compared to Oblivion's $120 million, suggesting a longstanding Hollywood tradition: throw enough money at a project, and its creative problem/s (in this case, clear derivation) are solved by an economics of scale. However, aside from its visuals - which reflect the film's artistry at least as much as its generous budgeting - there are two fairly unique themes that save Oblivion from itself - from what we might call its indistinction. These are the hi-tech war, in which theall/any-American is complicit, and the conflict of the celluloid/cellular (i.e., live/living), and digital/electronic (i.e., virtual), beginning with the nostalgic opening image of the Empire State Building's observation deck, a coin-operated pair of binoculars greeting us like an emissary of the medium on which it is shot - or appears to be shot. Though evident throughout the film due to the prominent role of lethal &#34;drones&#34; (in addition to ubiquitous surveillance, satellite mapping, heat-signature, and other video images and imaging of distant topography, figures, and events), the theme of telepresent war is clearest in the film's second half, when the elusive, desert-dwelling enemy capture Harper, force him to recognize their humanity, and coerce him to program one of the captured drones to attack its origin (the orbiting artificial intelligence Harper unwittingly serves). The other theme is more profound but less apparent, giving the film a weight just beneath conscious detection: the tenuous relationship between a film past of material means - a past at risk of oblivion, naturally represented by Cruise - and the current one of digital optimism, enfigured in the wife who dresses for work without leaving home (who in fact refuses to), and a CG rendering of a completed One World Trade Center, composited onto a healed New York, ripe for cataclysm and reified through the antiquated binoculars (n.b., from the deck of what was once the tallest skyscraper, and the first to suffer impact from an airplane). Blurred, but clearly the object of focus, an engagement ring is held up tentatively in the foreground, dwarfing the new tower. The form and tone of the essential conflict are perfectly united here. The trouble is in the proposition of such limited options for man and wife (not to mention viewer), when drawing from so vast a catalogue of futurist fiction. Ultimately, the nuclear family functions as a sort of punchline. Not a bad one, perhaps, but an exceedingly clean one - a choice, apparently, between Town and Country. Forget the ashes of your fathers and temples of your Gods, your cabin in the sky awaits. Or, if you prefer, the hidden valley of the LP.

B001H4NXCK|5.0|I have wanted to add this DVD to our collection for a long time. Loved seeing James Garner reliving his Maverick glory.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|That this book can stand the test of time can only speak for itself.  I love the grandeur and beauty of this great country (USA) and it is quite revealing to see how it came to be what it is today.  No embellishments, no softening of the edges, a sad and sometimes macabre story of how gentle nations were exploited.  This book forces us to look at our Native American neighbors with a new respect for their courage, beliefs and compassion for humankind even though the reverse was rarely shown to them.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is my absolutely most favorite Disney movie ever made!  I remember going to see this several times with my parents in the theater and it never got old.  It still has the same affect on me as an adult!
B004J4WLB4|3.0|This is the kind of book to bring along on vacation to read while sitting on the beach without a care in the world.  In this context it rates 5 stars but as an every day read without the trappings of a good beach and a great margarita in hand, I give it only a three.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Don't get me wrong, this video is great for getting results; but, the fact that it only contains 3 workouts makes it boring after a month or two.
B000SCHC0Q|3.0|Did not enjoy this book as much as the Kite Runner but it was still worth the read.  The writing style was a little disjointed in my opinion which sometimes made the reading arduous.
0545405777|5.0|A friend of mine this book a couple of months ago with some of her high school students and suggested the book to me.  I really enjoyed the futuristic setting of the book.

B0085OELXK|5.0|Fast moving, deeply psychological, conflicted characters, fabulous setting, (Italy) and terrific acting by all.  The pace may be slow in the beginning, but then, watch out; so much starts to unravel that before you know it, you're sitting on the edge of your seat!  When movies combine intense interpersonal drama, suspense, beauty beyond measure, and actors perfectly suited to the roles they play, you, indeed, have a winner. I've noticed the number of reviews which have preceded mine, and I believe many are interested in the movie for entertainment, mostly. The names, Gwenyth Paltrow, Jude Law, Matt Damon, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Kate Blanchette, are mesmerizing in themselves! The truth is, each one is a class act, but in combination, the energy and chemistry are over the top. Personally, I forgot I was simply watching a movie and gravitated, instead, to the pathos. Anything psychological that Patricia Highsmith creates like, \\"Strangers on a Train\\", have a psychological edge so fine and so subtle that I believe somewhere her passion was as much for psychoanalytic thought as for crime drama. Read her books and you will see what I mean. The movie is visually as stimulating as Highsmith's insights are intellectually satisfying. The level of analysis this author brings to the reader is brought to the screen in perfect unison with Highsmith's intent.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I somehow managed to miss watching the first two seasons of Suits until a friend recently recommended it.  I'm one of those people that always reads a book series in order, and I needed to do the same thing with Suits.  Well, after watching the first episode of year 1 (using my Amazon-purchased Roku) , I was hooked.  I recommend watching the series in order so you get a flavor of how the relationships develop.  I'm watching season 2 now, and without the season 1 background, a lot of it would not make sense.  Thanks, Amazon!
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|Unlike its predecessor, this Evil Dead left you with too many questions.  (spoilers ahead) To begin with.  Who was that man who killed his daughter/demon at the beginning of the film?  What was he doing in a cabin that apparently belonged to the protagonist's family?  Who were those people who helped him get rid of the demon?  Where were those people and that man when the demon was resurrected again?<br />Admittedly I am probably quibbling over what some view as little stuff, but I honestly thought this movie was not well thought out.  The original, cheap budget and all, with its touch of bad acting, was in actuality a much better written film.<br />Seriously,(more spoilers) what friend, and a nurse no less,  would &#34;kidnap&#34; (the moment Mia wanted to leave it was a kidnapping) an emotionally unstable person with a drug addiction, in order to &#34;cure&#34; her, knowing she is prone to violence and could possibly injury herself, without a hospital close by?  Also, what was a nurse doing, outside of a hospital, with the meds needed to sedate her?<br />Mind you, I have always loved horror movies, and had looked forward to an improved version of one of the old classics, like John Carpenter's version of the Thing, but unfortunately as often happens - the improved special effects in this one did not make a better film in this case.  However, if you are someone who likes the emphasis on real looking blood and gore type special effects in a horror movie, and doesn't mind holes in its plot, this movie will not disappoint you.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Need more rooms ! A great game with all kinds of challenges. A little math, memory and creativity. Just make more rooms and it will get 5 stars.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game that becomes very challenging in later levels but yet uses much of your common sense that we all over think.
0375869026|5.0|this was an assigned read for the summer.  my daughter was not happy at first but quickly grew to really enjoy it!  She liked the characters, the humor, etc.  The storyline is great for discussion for middle school age children.  Would recommend for tweeners and teens.  Be aware that the topic is about a disfigured boy who goes to public school for the first time.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I am a voracious reader, and I loved this book! I first heard about it because in August a film version of this book is being released and I saw a promotional trailer and thought it looked interesting. I quickly realized it was based on the first book in the Mortal Instruments series and got this for my Kindle immediately. I really loved this book and soon began to read the whole series.

B008CP6RWU|4.0|This is definitely a great game. I was tearing up a little by the end of it. It was a little over-hyped to me unfortunately, because Reddit told me it was the greatest game ever made and I have to disagree. Regardless, this collection is great for people who want a sweet, simple stories with only 3 or 4 hours of commitment, as opposed to 60+ for most games these days.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|It's interesting but not a very deep story. I'm probably not the intended audience but since it was such a big hit I had to see what the hype was about.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game for patient people! especially while waiting for the little blue pill to wear off in the hospital, how embarrassing!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I liked the story, the way the author expressed it, the characters in this story. I did't like the long chapters.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Make sure you watch in HD on the big screen.<br />A movie that should not be missed.<br />Great for the whole family.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Bought this for my husband! He's a big Rocky movies fan and this collection is great at a great price!
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I've been a Zep fan all my life.  Typically the albums were not well recorded and didn't fare well on high quality playback gear.  This changes that all.  Highly recommend.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book is cleverly written.  Characters are developed in a way that makes you feel like you know them all.  Many issues are brought up throughout the story that really make you think about your own life.  It is a page turner - you really want to find out how it ends!
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|Too much tedium and endless find the item. However the other puzzles were creative and challenging. Also the navigation was simpler than other similar games, with neat little blue markers pointing the way. Unfortunately you Needed them, as you had to take the same path across the village like fifty times to get past one stage.
0525478817|3.0|It's funny & sad story... i was so focused on hazel and her parents that i didnt care about augustus(s*** character)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I couldn't ask for more in a weather/forecast application than what The Weather Channel brings to the table with this super app. They have truly thought of everything a person would want to know or be interested in learning and wrapped it all up into what I think is the #1 choice for this category in an application. They even have a points program in which you can earn points to get gift cards to your favorite stores, or if your feeling generous you can use your points and turn them into a donation to a charity of your choice! I give this app a definite two thumbs up and five stars across the board!
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|Product Exterior- The Astro Slim 3 as a nice strong plastic feel to it.  With rubber edging so it is easy to hold in your hand without it slipping out of you hand. The build on micro USB cable it short so it won't work good with devices that have the charging port to the lower end of the phone. It also comes with a micro USB cable that can be used to charge the battery backup and it comes with a 30 pin adapter for your older Apple Products.<br /><br />Description of Use - I use it mostly around the house when my phone or tablet has a low battery since this external battery charges them faster than using the wall outlet.<br /><br />Ideal Users - This external battery would be great for people on the go and don't want to take a Car charger/bigger external battery. But since it fits nicely in my pocket it will work great when you're on the go.<br /><br />Completive comparison - This is the first External Battery that I have ever tired so I don't really have anything to compare it too.<br /><br />Summery - The design of the Astro Slim 3 is great. Love that there is rubber on the edge of the battery. It recharges my Motorola Razr M from 20% battery life to 100% in about an hour. Also it's great charging 2 devices at a time. There are some down sides to this External Battery. One was something I was very disappointed to see in this external battery and it is that it takes a very long time to charge the battery up. I think it took 7 hours total to charge the battery. The other problem is the build on USB cable is short and would be hard to use on some phones. Also another thing was that they should have packaged a lighting adapter with the 30 pin adapter.<br /><br />*I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Good for whole family-a little bit for everyone.<br />Action, adventure, comedy & no foul language.<br />I would recommend to any family.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|slow start, good 1 time view. I think I might have expected to much, actors did well. In the end a slight twist.
0425166805|5.0|This is a keeper.  Makes you think and question a lot of well-established thoughts.  Would be getting more of the author's works.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Good movie, made me laugh. Can't wait for Despicable Me 2. I have nothing else to say about it at this time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the simple design of this app.  Its functionality and ease of use is excellent.  Best of all, it's FREE!  What more could you ask for?
B008KOTNVA|5.0|Awesome Tool Set. Just as described in the ad, manufactured with very good quality materials, easy to handle all of them. I'd recommend it to any technician repairing cell phones, laptops, etc.
B00867GJYK|4.0|I love the movie, Nemo. However, I ordered the three-disc edition. The only one that will play is the regular dvd. The blu-ray will not play. It won't go any further than the disney castle. I do't really know what to do about it. I think I should be sent another one since his one is defective. It's not our blu-ray because other blu-ray discs work.
B00DFFI7K2|4.0|The plot was a little then and they killed the main GI Joe character but other than that it didn't such
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|Maybe you need to read the book to understand the depth of the meaning and make connections to the plot. Very disappointing movie!
B00BLSJI80|5.0|I love her songs, I like how I can relate to them either presently or in the past. However, I do have to agree with a previous review, her lyrics are very basic. Doesn't bother me but I can totally see it, or should i say, HEAR it :p
B00CWY76CC|4.0|You could keep playing and playing! But if u get stuck there's no help button so you could get stuck in a room for a long time :(
B001UREJWM|4.0|The vocal was canges. I was to tray what happent of Black Sabbath ? I think they trayed for more experrient metall and rock for excist a gain .
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Perfect size. Easily fits in purse! Good material! Good value. Works as is described. Just what I was looking for.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|Let me say right off the bat that this is an enjoyable puzzle game (if you like a variety of puzzles, that is) in an attractive format.  The graphics are nice, as are the music and sound effects.<br /><br />The game is indeed fun, if not very easy for experienced puzzle players.  It features a dozen or so different types of puzzles, with a 'boss' puzzle at the end of each of the dozen 'levels'.  As many of these types of games go, you play against the backdrop of a mysterious story, trying to rescue the old recluse that got himself in trouble.  I've been playing for almost two hours, and am over halfway through the game.  If I had bothered to use the hint system and the free passes, I'd probably have finished the game by now.<br /><br />There is the potential for replay, as many of the elements are randomized.  Unfortunately, the replay would have to be after an extended period of time, assuming I remember I have this in my library.<br /><br />Now for the bad news: If it weren't for the troubling permissions, this would have earned at least four stars.  Not only does this game have the troubling FLURRY ANALYTICS, it wants access to your accounts!  The idea of a game having access to my accounts is a real problem, however.  I rarely let any application have access to my accounts, much less something that has no business accessing them. By the way, this game has no qualms over accessing the internet!  Something to keep in mind.  At least the game works properly with access turned off.<br /><br />Big Fish offers good game play for the money.  Unfortunately, they take a few too many liberties with accessing the internet and especially accessing my accounts!  Not to mention the FLURRY ANALYTICS that you should be quite unhappy about.  Thankfully, I've rooted my devices and installed firewalls and blocking apps to prevent Flurry servers from being contacted.  I strongly recommend you do the same.<br /><br />Get rid of the account access and the Flurry Analytics, Big Fish, otherwise I can't get bring myself to give a favorable rating on this otherwise decent game.otherwise I can't get bring myself to give a favorable rating on this otherwise decent game.
B007MAETA8|5.0|2003's [[ASIN:B0000ALSDR Heavier Things]] is John Mayer's peak to me. He's a very popular artist but that album had fans a bit divided. I think it's his most underrated work in his discography and to me lyrically it's untouched by any of his other albums (as of 7/28/13). It really speaks to me.<br /><br />This album is really close lyrically though. I might even go as far as saying this is his second best album behind [[ASIN:B0000ALSDR Heavier Things]] and a PINCH better than 2006's amazing release [[ASIN:B0014VPFTA Continuum]] (sorry guys!). This album is very country and supposedly has genres in it like Americana too (I don't normally listen to that so I'm unsure). So in that way it's very different from most of the material he has done beforehand. But the pinnacle of the record is its mood. There are a couple of tracks that are more upbeat like \\"Queen Of California\\" and \\"Something Like Olivia\\" and those tracks are good. But the meat of the record comes from the more melancholy tracks that breathe life into it. \\"If I Ever Get Around To Living\\" is by far my favorite selection and has this very relaxing vibe about it. The guitar work isn't crazy intense like what we heard on \\"Continuum\\" but it is nonetheless still very effective. The second half of the album seems to be the moodiest and brings out the best songs.<br /><br />I love every single song here. I wasn't so sure about the route he was taking when I first heard \\"Shadow Days\\" but I eventually did like the tune. After getting the record home some time soon after its release and spinning it a couple of times I really loved it. And if I recall correctly it has remained the only John Mayer record that has made me shed tears over thinking about an ex. It really is a powerful record and I'm ANXIOUSLY awaiting the day that [[ASIN:B00DQBWLSO Paradise Valley]] comes out. I will buy it first week of release if I am able to. Bring on August 20th!!!<br /><br />4.8 stars.
1439152802|5.0|I am still reading, but so far this book has grabbed my interest.  It is easy to read, and the story is believable and relatable.  Enjoying it.
1451695187|4.0|The book was very good the only thing I could say bad was because of him a very well educated man he used alot of words I didnt understand.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I liked the old version much better.  Sorry to see it changed. I still use it but why fix it when it wasn't broken?
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a great book. Lots of surprised throughout. At one point I thought I had figured the book out and almost quit reading but suddenly a shocking change. Read until the end, you will not be disappointed!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game<br />.. It was quite the mind tester.<br />The images  were awesome the way they moved when<br />you get the answer,changing ,and shifting to the next clue.<br />I loved it!
B002SKZBQS|5.0|A journey into human nature. I loved the suspense. The difference between love or hate. Stephen King at his best.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|A good game to just relax to. It is fun for children also. Would recommend to a friend lots of fun.
B004AQR29C|4.0|just nothing but action no good story line. really random and you mostly see stallon and not as much of the other expendable beside the bigger name.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like subway surfer than you'll  minion rush it's even better than it I  think it's the next big thing!!!!!!
B003H4I4JU|4.0|It's a little too much psychology, metaphysics, and theology. However, the sci fi does break through and hold the readers attention. Good book.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Excellent!!! I recommend this product for childrens and adults! It´s fun and stimulates your brain.<br />I´m satisfied with the durability and quality of this product!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was really fun to play.  It was challenging but not so hard that it frustrated me and made me give up.  I'm looking forward to more levels.
B000FC13Y0|4.0|Not as great as Good Omens, but very entertaining.  Read it! Light, happy, escapist fantasy.  Agood summer read.  Read it!
B00070DK1E|5.0|By 1985, Jethro Tull was suffering from poor criticism from their album Under Wraps, as it was deemed too electronic and not so reminiscent of the popular flute style music that made the band popular. So in 1987, Ian Anderson supposedly went around and asked JT fans what they'd like to hear on a new album. Crest Of A Knave is the result.<br /><br />That's right, JT's fan base actually formed this album. The flute is back, modern late 80s keyboards are present and are not overdone as I believe they were on Under Wraps. Not to mention some great guitar work by Martin Barre, the band's guitarist for over 40 years!<br /><br />Some favorite cuts of mine feature Farm On The Freeway, Said She Was A Dancer, and Steel Monkey. This album was heavily praised when it came out and was deemed a comeback. In 1988, it won the Grammy Award for best hard rock album, surprising many people who believed Metallica's album And Justice For All album would win. Nonetheless, JT pulled through and HEAVILY deserved the award.<br /><br />In conclusion, Crest Of A Knave is a landmark in JT history. It saw the band win a Grammy, and it was deemed a very successful comeback for the band. Every and any JT fan should add this album into their collection. Even Metallica fans will rest satisfied knowing this album win the 1988 hard rock Grammy.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|The philosophy in this book made you think, and the comedy made you laugh! My daughter recommended it, and I thank her.
B00785P2QC|5.0|i really enjoy this app and how it allows me to create the city of my dreams. I would recommend this game to everyone
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This is yet another great release in the Marvel series. Sam Jackson was a wonderful choice to play Nick Fury. As a matter of fact, I enjoyed all of the actors chosen to play the characters. This is a must see!!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Have seen this on TV, but wanted my own to watch when I want.  Great acting, great actors, fun movie.  Made me smile.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Loved this so until the new update. Taking it off my Kindle. Going to give another weather app a try!!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|My favorite show ever!  The interaction of the team is fantastic.  Love how Ziva is feminine and kicks whatever she needs to.  All cast are great.  LOVE IT!!
B006CHML4I|1.0|Wonderful watch, until you get it wet. I was wearing this watch with a suit, and after washing my hands, the band had become a little wet. When I got home, I noticed that the cuff of my suit and shirt had been DYED dark blue because the color had come off with the water. I bought the watch because it was rated WATER PROOF. Extremely cheap product.<br /><br />Amazon should be responsible for a few hundred dollar suit, but they won't even process my return.
B006YC74E8|5.0|This app was amazing i can edit my own photos and share them. I was looking 4 and app like this 4 ever and now i got 1.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I love the way Jody Picoult writes, particularly creating, especially in this book, courtroom drama. Her characters are believable. The moral issues she writes are ones we all face to some extent and I like the way I, as the reader, am allowed to make my own conclusions. Reading &#34;The Pact&#34; I feel grateful my own children have passed through adolescence relatively balanced in mind and faith. I am also glad they didn't read this book then, as I would have been worried about the subject (suicide) affecting their thinking.<br />I read this book while on holiday, which was ideal as I could not put it down!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I am in love with the books n show ever since the beginning lol i hate that the books are better then the show
B003G4W49C|5.0|I absolutely loved it! It was slow in the beginning but it got really good. I loved the part before the end. I was in shock,I read it over a few times to make sure I read it correctly.
B002TXZRRM|3.0|Due to difficulties getting communication with Amazon this book never downloaded to my Kindle. In fact no books will download to it. Sigh.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I knew a little about Tesla but it was enough to spark intrest in reading a book about the man and his inventions. This book did just that. It was extremely well written and short enough that I was able to sit down and finish in one sitting. Excellent read. Would recommend to anyone even remotely interested in Nikola
B005EHNEDO|5.0|I was very hesitant to buy this album. Despite my love for Wilco, I refused to buy this album due to Wilco's increasing drift from their original style of music. I finally gave in and bought it. I was actually surprised on how much I liked it. It isn't their greatest but it is good for what it is.
140006922X|1.0|This book was written by someone who has no problem with threatening those who criticize him or his religion. Not only is Reza Aslan a Muslim, and not only does his alleged historical reconstruction of the Gospels just happened to correspond exactly to the Muslim view of Jesus, but he is also a Board member of the National Iranian American Council (NIAC), which has been established in court as a lobbying group for the Islamic Republic of Iran.<br /><br />Even worse, Aslan has tried to pass off Iran's genocidally-minded outgoing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as a liberal reformer and has called on the U.S. Government to negotiate with Ahmadinejad himself, as well as with the jihad terror group Hamas. Aslan has even praised the jihad terror group Hizballah as \\"the most dynamic political and social organization in Lebanon,\\" as well as the anti-Semitic, misogynist, Islamic supremacist Muslim Brotherhood, which is dedicated in its own words, according to a captured internal document, to \\"eliminating and destroying Western civilization from within.\\" Aslan wrote: \\"The Muslim Brotherhood will have a significant role to play in post-Mubarak Egypt. And that is good thing.\\" Millions of Egyptians obviously disagree.<br /><br />Aslan is not a trained historian. He is not unbiased. Instead he tries to sell his islamist ideology pretending it's science. Just pathetic.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Really liked this book and the mysterious tone to it all the way though....Thought I had it figured out a few times and was still surprsied at the end!
B00932AA5G|3.0|The movie starts out strong, with lots of quick scenes of sophisticated Oslo and rapid dialogue.  The suspense builds quickly.  But then it turns into a cat and mouse game that has two problems: 1. The cat's motivation for pursing the mouse was never clear, and 2. As is too typical in movies like this, the mouse got out of too many perilous situations to be believable.  It could have been more interesting if it turned into a psychological and intellectual thriller instead.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Couldn't put it down - dark and twisty at times, but always entertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat. So well-written, fantastic character development, and just gripping. Will be recommedning Flynn's novels to all my friends!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman has written another great exploration of mysterious other worlds - strange happenings - evil and good not from our world. Great read!
B00CQ8U5ZE|4.0|This is a very good movie.  Very entertaining, but Ms. Dickinson had no point to existing in this movie.  None.  I guess they needed to make the movie longer and they had some sort on contractual obligation to use her in a film.<br /><br />Also, it has a number of holes in the story.  For instance, at one point Bronson drops his gun on the top of the cliff (where the guns stays).  Then he jumps off the cliff into a tree, makes it to the ground and picks up his gun and shoots.<br /><br />Unnecessary swearing, a young Mountie get drunk and shows some interest in a fat slob of a woman.  That same young Mountie gets a long kill from the villain.  Huh>  I don't know that that added much to the movie.<br /><br />Bronson was 59 or 60 when he made this movie.  There is no way a 60 year old could do what he does in the movie (even squatting for 30 seconds to talk to the mad trapper must have killed his knees).
B000002KDO|5.0|I had forgotten how heavy Master of Reality is...does not sound dated some 40 years after its release.  Classic doom metal.
0061537969|5.0|What a unique story! told from the dogs point of view. Sad, happy, cute, heartwarming and frustrating. Well worth the read, I couldn't put it down!
B005HED08I|5.0|Great to see the old crew back in action.  My 15 year old son is all over it.  Two words
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|The usual: expensive cars, exotic women, car chases, futuristic gadgets, and James comes out unscathed. Worth the viewing if you're a Bond fan
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Very good film with good humor. Star studded and well acted.  Fight scenes are very well done and it is just a fun, feel good movie.
1400025354|3.0|One of those books you hear about and can't wait to read, so maybeI built it up too much. Different in that it comes from the point of view of an autistic point of view, but the story was depressing. Not satisfying.
B00D3ZJB1S|5.0|Reminiscent of the  old days when Sabbath ruled.  They rule again.  Excellent vocals by Ozzie, but I don't know how since no one can understand him when he speaks.  Guitar work is first class. I highly recommend this album to everyone.
B006R1T40I|3.0|I don't think it is she who is falling short in any way.  I think I choose poorly.  I am quick to buy and then when I actually experience things, they disappoint me.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love minecraft it is so much fun trying to survive or creating whatever you want in creative mode but I wish in creative that there was flint and steel.
B003U4ZQRK|4.0|Well wondering where this is all going. Will all this be tied up and all explained. It seems to me that all this is to drag out the series, should of ended it all last season.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game. It is very brain stimulating. Actions are good and everything works well so far.<br />Will continue to look forward to playing the rest of the levels.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Absolutely the most heart-warming drama I have watched in a long time.  This is a tale of yesteryear but with the same human struggles and lessons to be learned.  My husband & I watched two to three episodes a night.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoy the history of this time . The clever scripts and performances by the likes of Maggie Smith! Enjoyable on so many levels. I didn't watch DA until so many friends were excited anticipating Season 3. I enjoyed being able to watch the first 2 seasons in a few sittings thru Amazon Instant Video app & my Prime account. Shortly thereafter Season 3 became available as well. I now eagerly await Season 4!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoyed this series immensely and am looking forward to season 4 in February 2014. PBS did a spectacular job!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is so cool a life like so if you like horses and games chose this to play bye bye
B00DP3IGJ6|1.0|This movie was crap. Total crap. I've spent more amusing hours with food poisoning. Don't waste your time. I've already spent more time writing this review then the scriptwriters spent on creating a coherent plot and convincing characters.
B008KOTNVA|4.0|I am an onsite tech and use this product almost every day and am very happy with it. The only problem I had was with one of the bits becoming damaged while trying to remove a stubborn screw. The metal used for the bits may have been chosen to ultimately protect computers from damage, rather than the bit, so I would still recommend this to other techs and will definitely buy this again if I ever need to.
B009GXHOW4|4.0|You can put anything in your inventory. you can even change it from survival to creative but when you want to change make sure to put everything in your inventory in a chest. or else....IT WILL DELETE YOUR INVENTORY!!!!!!!!!....all of it and you wont get it back. that is the only bad part about this app. but I do highly recommend this app.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie although i would recommend splitting it up into two.  I had seen parts of the mini-series a long time ago but never was able to watch it complete.  Definitely a favorite.  Well acted, well directed with a great storyline.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I love puzzle games so this one will be challenging.  I put it on my kindle and haven't stopped playing.
B00AWJYJVA|3.0|Good page turner, very topical. But too many characters are stereotypes who talk in cliches, the writing is hardly sophisticated.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|When I  first got this app, everything was just fine. But after the other day, the videos in my favorites/others won't show up for apparent reason whatsoever. And now I can't watch my favorite videos.
B00138KKP8|5.0|I live five miles away from Ray (haven't seen him around yet), but have listened to and respected him since seeing him on Artist's Den. You should have this CD already!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a very good game  I play it when i want something challenging it's additive I love it it's a good game
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Upon viewing the video; I realized I needed the CD, and I'm very happy I bought it! The sound-stage and acoustics are captivating. If you are familiar with his electric music, these arrangements will give you a new appreciation for his genius (and his choice of accompaniment).
B009KS4XRO|2.0|htgs are so rare i quit room before finished. have paid but too expensive to keep playing so i can move on.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Ive found a great many deals on this site....if ive had a problem they are quick to reimburse then investigate puts my mind at ease to use this site...
B008BDZP3K|5.0|Playing that has drive and imagination and that maintains its coherence.  Great stuff.<br /><br />Back in 1992 I'd play the LP when people came over for dinner.  I'd tell them as they came into the living room that art of one of the Presidential candidates was on display and have them guess who.  No one got it.<br /><br />I like Freak Out too, but have its other reviewers ever heard of The Fugs?
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have a digital copy of this collection, so I ordered two copies of the CD to give as gifts; the recipients love the music!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Anyone looking for a solid drama, one that goes outside the normal Hollywood boundaries, should love this.  Quite a new genre, and the acting is phenomenal, despite the numerous characters.  The storylines are extensive, and do switch back and forth, but I think it keeps you interested in all that's going on amongst all the confusion it generates.  I missed this live when it started, but after recommendations from several friends, I started watching it and quickly fell in love with it.  It's got that renegade feel, done very very well.  My friends and I are in the entertainment industry, thus creative minds, and it suits all of us in that regard.<br /><br />There's lots going on in this series, and it's not for the faint of heart.  But, rest assured, if you're up for something different, this show is amazing.  I liken it to the passion people emit for The Wire.  It is that good.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a pretty fun puzzle solving game. Haven't played very much of it yet. It sometimes seems like you just tap the screen until something happens.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Loved the info provided by the author.  Well-written and easy to understand.  Makes you want to jump right and start decluttering and simplifying.
037571457X|4.0|A memoir of the author's childhood during the Islamic revolution, presented in a comic. This book caught my attention by two reasons:<br /><br />1. My recent love for memoirs and historic stories.<br /><br />2. The unique representation through a comic.<br /><br />It's a must read. :)
B00005614M|5.0|My only complaint is that the album is too short.  Besides that it's great stuff.  Very upbeat for Miles Davis.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|It is a good adaptation of the original book. Their actors are extremely talented, achieve one's love or hate, depending on Their character. Recommended for those who love the fantasy genre.
1401223176|4.0|I got this for a friend for his birthday. He was very happy with it.. and you could be too! It came on time and is a good read.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|It is a good adaptation of the original book. Their actors are extremely talented, achieve one's love or hate, depending on Their character. Recommended for those who love the fantasy genre.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is just like u r in the room.  This game needs strategy and knowledge.  I love this game
B00514HDNW|4.0|This is a far more compelling story than the one presented in the theaters. This is a more human story, more bleak for everyone, more personal, more poignant.<br />This is one of those books that remains with you and stirs your soul and makes you ponder the question and pulls you into the characters as if it was happening to you.<br />That is the beauty of this book. Thanks, Mr. Matheson!
0762451319|4.0|Liked the magnets. The necklace was too short to wear, but well made.<br />Get it if your a fan of the series.
1416972242|4.0|I enjoyed \\"City of Ashes\\" even more than \\"City of Bones\\".  Maybe I am just getting sucked into the story more now that the characters are introduced and I have spend 800 pages or so with them.  This time around I found Magnus and Alec very intriguing.  I also still love Simon the best but the twist here with him is a nice surprise and I think this will play out nicely as the series progresses.  However with that said, perhaps keeping him completely human a little longer would have provided some interesting places for the plot to go as well.  He always seem to be the standout to me.  I still am not overly fond of Jace as I know that I am supposed to be and Clare is just starting to reveal his past.  I am going to hang out for the long haul though and read the next book as well.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|it is a realistic fun game an  it  great for kids this game has a five star review honestly  woohoo
140006922X|5.0|A very good book that's based solely on the authors twenty years worth of research and not his personal opinion. I'd highly recommend it.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|It is fun to play.  Problem is that the buy coins keep popping up for cash.  I do not like that feature.  I did remove it.
1439153663|1.0|This book was painful to read in so many ways. I was so excited to read it...excellent reviews, a best seller, etc. I could not have been more disappointed or more in shock at how awful this was. The plot dragged more than any recent book I could think of, I was 150 pages in and the same plotline events were still going nowhere. If not for the colorful history portrayed throughout, this book would be nothing but a poorly written, depressing novel. I can't believe I seem to be the minority in thinking this was extremely unskilled novel writing. Maybe Grissom gets all this credit for all the detail and the historical accuracy of the book, but too many times a major point in the plot was quickly and unsuccessfully resolved leaving me feeling as if I was reading a high schooler's unfinished work.<br /><br />With all the amazing authors and novels out there today, I cannot believe this book received any credit at all.  I highly urge people to avoid reading it
B00CWY76CC|1.0|This is a fun challenging game. The levels get appropriately harder the higher you go. I like this game and suggest it for anyone who likes puzzles.
B00DW39B2K|5.0|This movie was so good I even watched the 10 minutes of closing credits. The images and soundtrack during that closing period were as good then as they were throughout the entire movie. This movie was a true roller coaster of suspense, drama and action. It is a deeply enriching movie with a subtle message, one that Hollywood is not known for, but it is there. To really understand the fullness of that message, watch those final closing credits and listen to the songs. If you are an astute listener, paying attention to the entire movie, you will have already gotten the message before then. This is essentially a two-man movie. The other few people who appear are more extras than anything. So the burden of this movie in on the shoulders of two of our finest males actors.<br /><br />In my opinion, this was a stellar movie. The outdoors scenes are beautifully shot. The suspense is intense. The action rugged and at times brutal.<br />Fight scene coordination is credited to the legendary Jeff Imada.<br /><br />I paid the $6.99 price to see it now, because I sensed from the preview and the cast that it would be well worth that price. I was correct. I never give spoilers in my reviews, so you will have to depend on others for all that. If you love riveting action movies that pit man against man in the most harrowing of ways, this is one you will want to see, at least once. Some of it was shot in Bulgaria.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review. Peace.<br /><br />PS: I have to laugh at those who cannot deal with Travolta's accent. He is playing the role of a Serbian Death Squad member. The accent is to lend realism to the character. It is easy to understand him, IF YOU LISTEN. This is not Honey Boo-Boo or some mindless \\"reality\\" show that you can watch while playing on the Xbox, cooking supper, or whatever it is you do. Americans are quick to turn off a person whose accent differs from theirs. This is sad.<br /><br />BONUS MOVIE EATS TIP:  Melting American Single Sliced Cheese into Mayonaisse does not a home dip make.e into Mayonaisse does not a home dip make.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it!!<br />I really enjoy the options this game has. I enjoy playing cards on my kindle due to my arthritis in my wrist.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|We did not want to watch this movie for fear of being upset.  However, the movies emphasis is in the spirit of the mind and it was amazing and funny instead of sad.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Great story, excellent photography, awesome characters, full of twists and turns, one of if not the best series i have ever watched. Packaged beautifully, can't wait for series 2,3 and 4.
B005DNOAQY|5.0|If you like Woddy Allen you love this movie.  Diane Keaton and Woody are the best combination of entertainment, Great Movie
B0060MYM3S|5.0|As per series 1, excellent show, recommend it very highly, looking forward to series 3. The story is enthralling and filmed brilliantly, not for the squeamish.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I gave this rating because it does not always the word you are looking for and also it does not have a search unit.
B000N3ST7K|5.0|Never sure what is going to happen next in Tarantinos movies and this one is no exception, brilliant film, have watched it four times and always find something new, great soundtrack as usual and effects are excellent
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love this game!!!  So glad they got it back on my Kindle Fire HD.  Now please get CANDY CRUSH back on the Kindle Fire HD....I love that game and lot of people do!!!!
B00E4W40C4|2.0|Just seen the movie. This movie was ok not what I thought it should have been. This story line dident need to b told .at least four or five movies down the road. This story follows after x-men 3 the worst of the x-men movies. (Yes I said it) maybe Hollywood doesn't know how to put back to back story lines together? But thats just me. Any ways I don't recommend spending money on this wait for DVD
B008Y768XO|1.0|Great beginning, but after about 5 minutes, you spend the next half hour waiting for the epic tragedy.  Then you spend the next hour crying your eyes out at the tragicness of the story. Every time he goes back your heart breaks a little more.  As a dog lover, this was *not* a fun movie.
1439152810|2.0|I was let down by high expectations after reading previous reviews. This is the first and last book I will read by Kate Morton. I read a book a week at least. I enjoy books that travel back & forth in time. The writing of this book was not enjoyable in the time changes. It was very choppy. I felt I never got into a reading rhythm that felt comfortable. I actually had to force myself to finish this book.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|While I am not a gun nut, this was a fascinating read.  It is sometimes necessary to get into the mind of a person who is unlike oneself.  What drove Chris Kyle to do what he did was still unclear at the end of the book, but his honesty and integrity was stellar.  I don't care where your politics on war lie, broaden your horizon with this book about a remarkable man.  It is so sad that he was killed.  Almost like falling on his own sword.
B00AEBB86A|5.0|Another scary &#34;take&#34; on our government.  This is a GOOD movie and I wouldn't doubt it for a minute - even though<br />it might have been several years ago.  Everyone in Washington is worse than a cad and doesn't give a hoot about<br />the people they represent who put them there!
B00DFFI7K2|3.0|Killing Duke at the beginning was not cool, how do you kill off the one and true leader of the the G.I. Joe team after he had just joined the team in the last movie, again not cool.  The Rock did good but should have kept Heavy Barrel to compliment Roadblock, whats better than 1 big gun slinging character, 2 big gun slinging characters.  I see Cobra got away again, what are they trying to do make this like Transformers?<br /><br />You know they never really confirmed Duke to be dead they only showed Roadblock pull off dog tags from a body that looked like Duke at an angle......just saying, plus he had a bag full of dog tags for those who died so if you think about it that could have been another soldier.  What was up with Flint, his role served zero purpose, the should have kept Rex for the intel type character.<br /><br />overall the movie was decent.  could have been better...yes.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I laughed, I cried, and I loved watching Season 3. It was full of excitement and drama. I couldn't stop watching it. I kept watching one show after the next and then before long I had no more shows to watch.  I can't wait for the new season.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|This product did not allow the toggle to work on the side of my phone, when I tried to contact the seller, no response.  Eventually the seal broke because I had to continually take the case off if I wanted to turn off/on the sounds function with the toggle switch.  You get what you pay for!

B00555X8OA|4.0|I am always interested in books that teach me new things, make me a better person and a better leader. What I think about this book probably depends on the question asked. If the question is - &#34;Did you learn something from this book&#34;, my answer is &#34;Absolutely Yes&#34;. If the question is - Is the book interesting, my answer would be different.<br /><br />Although I admire and truly respect the author for the work he has done, my personal feeling is that the book is probably not very captivating. Although several parts of the book are very interesting, there were several times when I had to pause and re-read (sometimes more than two times) to make sense of what the author is trying to say. You have to use System 2 and you will understand what this means once you start reading the book.<br /><br />The book is very long too. If you really want to learn something and if you don’t mind investing time - purchase the book.<br />Although this book is already a big hit, I feel that it could do even better if the length is condensed to about 75%.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I guess I wasn't playing it correctly so i became bored with it very quickly. I will try it again when I become more familier with my Kindle
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best app in the whole world.I love it this game is beyond compare.beauty is very beautiful I like it because it gives you an opertunity to have fun and take care of one of natures gifts
B008B4KVS8|5.0|I owned the DVD of this movie, watched it on my old tube TV & thought it was ok.  When I finally upgraded to a Panasonic 55\\" Plasma, I was blown-away by the DVD. It immediately became one of my favorites, so much in fact that I bought the Blu-ray disk.  Watching the Blu-ray on on a large screen TV is a viewing pleasure.  The theme music playing while the sub races across the ocean is one of my favorite scenes.  It's just a pleasure to watch. I've seen this movie on Turner a few times, and it's no comparison to the Blu-ray.  If you like this movie, do yourself a favor & see it as it was meant to be seen.
B00E25KVLW|5.0|It is the perfect book for any Rails beginner. The code examples are<br />well thought trough and easy to understand. Only not being able to<br />copy and paste the code from the Kindle version is a bummer.<br /><br />That the book starts with an introduction to Ruby 2.0 is a blessing.<br />It takes maybe an hour to read the Ruby chapter but after that you<br />know all the basics and can jump into creating the first Rails mini<br />project. The ActiveRecord chapter just makes anybody fall in love with<br />ActiveRecord. Because the author doesn't overwhelm the reader with one<br />mega project but with many small examples it is easy to just dive into<br />a specific topic.<br /><br />If you want to understand Rails 4.0 fast this book is perfect for you.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|It is really embarrassing to admit how addictive this silly game is.  What can I say?  I play it entirely too much.

0812550706|5.0|I first read this book in Junior High and since then have re-read it at least 10 times. The thoughts and concepts in this book are well beyond their time and the follow on series for both Enders Game and Enders Shadow are so well planned and pieced together. To show the life of a person from young child through a series of events and years and a parallel series that is in conjunction is extraordinary. Enders Game a great read, it will keep your mind engaged, and will not be forgotten after you are finished!
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|I have just finished reading my second Bob Book - James please write a 3rd.  Cannot get enough of his adventures.  I certainly hope this will be made into a Film - what a story of love, hope, life and in the end happiness.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|When a movie like this comes along you jump in for the full ride. The action & graphics create a fantastic world where you can just imagine the old west recreated from the old cowboys & Indians to a future world where we use our brute force to take what we want damn the consequences .
0071752854|5.0|One of the best  books in persuasion.  Highly recommended to those students<br />in marketing or advertising and for entrepreneurs as well.  Also recommended<br />to those involved in sales, advertising, marketing, training and speech writing.

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|works like a champ best purchase I've made in a long time. I use it with a karakoe machine and it works great!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I love this book.  Steven Pressfeild accurately describes the inner voice of resistance that I hear chattering away at me daily, telling me all sorts of lousy, unkind things. The voice lies to me, wants to keep me fearful, unhappy and unproductive.  He then introduces the concept of \\"Turning Pro\\".  The Pro still hears all that  racket but does his work or follows \\"the pursuit of any calling\\" regardless of what the internal noise says.  The Pro knows the voice will always be there.  The Pro keeps working no matter how loud resistance tries to speak.<br /><br />Another book I love addresses resistance in a brilliant way.  [[ASIN:1888043024 How to Have A Match Made in Heaven: A Transformational Approach to Dating, Relating, and Marriage]] is a fabulous and inspiring book by Ariel and Shya Kane.  The authors offer an amazing possibility regarding resistance: notice the resistance, without judging it, and the resistance falls away.  The mere act of noticing and allowing whatever is happening to simply be the way it is, allows the very thing to dissolve.  I've tried it and it works.  This innovative book has a unique and exciting feature: each story has an online web address that links you to a video of the very people you were just reading about.  I love that I can \\"watch\\" part of this book as well as read it's wisdom.  I am touched and energized by both of these smart and enlightening reads.
B00BB22GSU|3.0|. . . But it lacks that signature Afro-pop sound of the previous Vampire Weekend albums.  The musical skill of the artists has improved, but their identity has been hidden behind a layer of genericism. This is a shame, as I typically do not enjoy indy pop music and had found a love for Vampire Weekend with their two fun and quirky first albums. It would be hard to recognize any song from Modern Vampires of the City as being Vampire Weekend; there is no trademark, nothing to make them stand apart from everything else being made.  They have gone the way of Maroon 5 and every other band that once had a unique sound, then fell into the pop music melting pot.
0061353248|5.0|Dan Ariely has a knack for this.  The book combines intriguing Behavior Economic theories with the practical, very relatable application that he demonstrates thru the experiments he used to test such theories.  If you are a small business owner, aspiring entrepreneur, or just like to peek into the human mind at what drives their purchases, how pricing a product should be thought about, building a brand, and a laundry list of other interesting topics, etc... read up.  It's not a dry, battle to read like some marketing books - it's a little more colloquial, and the concepts are easy for anyone to grasp and apply.  I've even recommended this to my friends who need help gaining insight about their own irrational spending  so they can better budget their lives.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Sad it's over. Congrats to Suzanne Collins. An excellent trilogy. Seemed to kinda skipped a little at the end, but still .... great reading.
0887307280|4.0|Good Entrepreneurial insight for current business owners or future endeavors.  It provokes thought for a more structured foundation of your personal mentality as a business owner, as well as examples of how to actually manage specific elements of ownership that everyone otherwise tries to figure out on their own (usually with shoddy guesswork and misguided intuition).  Most importantly, it continually reminds you of how to establish a system for your business that can be easily replicated - the ultimate purpose of which is so your business runs WITHOUT you being there constantly to  A) Supervise or  B) Do the work yourself.  The most successful companies in history set such systems in place, so that any 15 yr old, pimple-faced kid can run McDonald's without fail or falter.  Worth reading, hands down.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very interesting game. It requires some thinking and we appreciate it a lot at home. Kids like it as well.  Thanks a lot!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a solid teamwork-building game! Great for families! We recommend this app to any parent conscious about enhancing their child's lateral thinking abilities.

1781162646|4.0|The first thing that can be said about this is that that this is a relatively mild, mellow, not-too-horrific Stephen King. Actually I almost have the impression that it might have been written with a early-teenage audience in mind. There is some bad language, but it's relatively light on the brain-eating maggots and such. It has a kind of happy ending in a pleasantly melancholy sort of way. I would have loved this book when I was thirteen or fourteen.<br /><br />It also is a more coherent and _finished story_ than some of King's books. It's not like some of his other books where he seems to be unable to think of a resolution and hopes he can distract you by grossing you out so badly that you won't even notice the loose ends.<br /><br />If you like Stephen King you'll like this book. It definitely has its moments. For me, the best incidents in the book involved the hero's self-discovery of his talent at \\"putting on the fur.\\"<br /><br />Nevertheless, I feel that the master has been just mailing it in lately, and I have a lot of small gripes with his books. I just never really ended up caring about his characters. And there was too much telegraphing of plot turns.<br /><br />What I really RESENT is that it has a CINEMATIC SENSIBILITY, not a literary one. It reads as if it was meant to be made into a movie. That final confrontation with the bad guy, it's ALL movie, NO novel.<br /><br />As is his wont, King seems to steal ideas just a little bit too easily. You can never prove anything unless he confesses it, as he sometimes does in his author's notes, but he seemed to be recycling some of his own Heimlich-maneuver incidents. One of the characters is named \\"Annie Ross,\\" which just happens to be the name one of my favorite jazz singers, and I wonder whether that's a coincidence. A character says \\"I'm flying!\\" and it's a boy, not a young woman, and it's on a Ferris wheel, not the bow of the Titanic, BUT STILL... I kept feeling that the amusement-park and carny background seemed sterile, the product of research rather than first-hand experience, and I felt that was confirmed by his afterword, in which he graciously acknowledges a source--a website operated by one Wayne Keyser--and generously suggests that readers buy Keyser's book-on-CD.
B00C1BTWV4|4.0|It's a little slow for the kids in a couple areas, but over all the movie is fantastic. Lots of drama + learning about dinosaurs in an exciting way makes this a hit for our family. We've watched it several times.
B006BQNJR8|2.0|Both the story and the direction need tremendous help. I watched this movie all through to the end in the desperate hope that it would redeem itself. My only reward was knowledge there it's unlikely there will be a sequel.

B00CISC2DA|5.0|This album is my first exposure to BOC but I think I'm in love ( or maybe in lust ) with them. All I can really say is that the music sounds the way the front & back of the CD album cover looks ( it's very horizonal (( horizonal is a new word I guess )). It reminds me of the soundtrack to a 1970s surreal, animated sci-fi cartoon ( probably from an alternate universe from ours ). It's soothing. It's one of those albums you can listen to while doing work ( a.k.a. drawing )... especially in the wee hour of the morning.... with a few glasses of beer. I give it the highest recommendation. So glad Amazon thought I'd like them. <:-D
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. I loved the game. It requires a little thought at times which makes it challenging but doable. Would recommend this app.

B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|A great game for a 40yr old A.D.D. guy. It kept me entertained and focused even when the wife was in my ear yaping for God know what
B00CQGU9GG|4.0|I had the first eight ZZ Top albums on vinyl only. Well worn vinyl at that. This box set is nicely presented without bells and whistles. I've listened to each CD at least once and found them to be better than expected without any jawdropping flaws. My musical tastes have changed since I first heard &#34;La Grange&#34; blasted out of the speakers at a college bar. I had thought about picking up a couple of them for old time's sake but never got around to it. I'm not a big fan of several of the albums and this set didn't change my mind. But it's nice to be able to listen to &#34;Just Got Paid&#34; and &#34;Mexican Blackbird&#34; without it sounding like tumbleweeds blowing through my speakers.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I thought Homeland was intelligently written and wonderfully<br />complex.<br />The characters were sympathetic and I never knew what was coming next.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't believe how amazing this show is. The story lines, the costumes, the magnificent backdrops. There's drama, tragedy, love, and comedy all rolled into one. I can't wait for season 4!!!
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I like this game a lot but I hats how it always stops my game so I got the full version it is a lot better!!!
B0050AV5MW|5.0|I wanted  to read all the time. A wonderful story. Hope the next book will come out soon. I can't wait.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I just finished the book bigger leaner stronger and I must say, it is very instructive.<br />I started 9 months ago to do a lot of research on how to get the body of my dream, and, even if I already knew some of the stuff, they are a lot of good things to know, and a lot of mistakes to know.<br /><br />Very helpful, nice to read, and a lot of studies references too, so it's not just arbitrary facts.<br /><br />I strongly recommend if you don't want to fall into majors traps.
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|We all know the movie itself is a little cheesy but HEY its the Beatles! The blu-ray looks and sounds amazing as compared to my old dvd copy.recommended.
B0090SI582|1.0|I am rating the package, not the movie.<br /><br />On the list of movies to collect, but the choice of Ultraviolet digital copy over iTunes digital copy makes this a package a 1 star for folks with iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, Macs and Apple TV. I hope the studio wakes up and provides the iTunes digital copy in the final package.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It made me a better Christian and I love Jesus Christ the more.<br /><br />However, while reading the book I wanted to bring the present Palestine into the picture - I hope the United States is not the current Rome.<br /><br />I got scared.<br /><br />We need to leave the middle east and worship Christ as we beleive He exist in our lives.<br /><br />The sooner the better.<br /><br />Peace
B00E3IZIM0|1.0|I am rating the package, not the movie.<br /><br />Even Amazon clearly shows if a movie has Ultraviolet to warn those who are looking for the iTunes digital copy. I actually pre-ordered it, only to see the product title change to show only UVDC. Canceling my preorder.<br /><br />I hope the studio provides the digital copy for this package in the final release.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and it reminds me of going to horse camp. I love all the features and it  is just a great game!
B0068LYEHA|5.0|I love this book! Caitlin Moran is so funny but she's also shamelessly honest about taboo topics relevant to women growing up that they don't even talk about among each other. She's a great writer and an amazing woman
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game!  One of the grandkids ask if they could download the game and I ended up playing it more then they did..LOL
B0060MYM7O|5.0|So many great moments to tell. Superbly acted and directed, you will enjoy it. The battle at Kings Landing was one of the best episodes yet.
140006922X|5.0|I have heard Dr. Aslan lecture, speak, preach and interview as a religious scholar in several venues. This book provides historians, people of faith and religious scholars with an important view of the political climate in which Jesus lived and why he was a threat to the Roman establishment. Regardless of one's faith, there is still a need to understand history and why things happened the way they did. In order to do this, it is necessary to remove the magic and the mystery surrounding a topic and to provide the reader with facts. This book does exactly that. As a person of faith who also loves history and who constantly seeks to understand the dynamics of past societies and the driving forces behind them, I found this book to be riveting.<br /><br />Dr. Aslan spoke at All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena, CA and provided the congregation with a moving glimpse into the historical Jesus. It is wonderful to step outside of the Vacation Bible School stories and to have a deeper understanding about the dynamics of the world 2000 years ago when these revolutionary changes occurred in the Palestine. In order to understand the world, it is important to know the required history. Dr. Aslan gives anyone interested in this subject matter a wonderful gift with his comprehensive understanding of this subject matter. This book is not a rebuttal to one's faith. It is a companion piece.
B00CT2P6VA|4.0|Worth it. There are plenty of short puzzles to keep you occupied for hours. I will most likely buy other Quell games for my phone.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|My 8 year old granddaughter selected this game, I like the cartoon character, its not violent and keeps her busy
B005544V6A|5.0|I can' t stop watching it! It keeps on getting better and better! Awesome show! Can't wait for the next season!
B006S053K8|4.0|If you liked the movie  Zombieland, you will definately love this movie too. Its funny and very  young adult oriented. Like if you are in your late teens or early twentys then its more likely you will enjoy this than mom or dad.
B006LMMN8I|5.0|I love this CD because it tells stories of love and compassion that I can actually play around my children. I would recommend this CD.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|Teen Beach Movie is quirky,sunny, movie for ages 10 and up. The Songs are super catchy and Ross and Maia sing really great together. This movie was seen in people magazine and it does not lie. Another great original, Disney! With this movie, your kids will laugh,sing and dance along to this one of a kind film!!
B00AZQ4VMC|4.0|bryan ferry has decided to re-record some of his most popular songs in the style of 1920s dance tunes. why? who knows! ferry explained his desire to reset his songs in this fashion and one day, i may get around to reading the liner notes. until then, i will have the songs as they are to keep me company.<br /><br />the arrangements for some of the tunes bring out even more melancholy and aching than their original versions; especially the last track on the disc. it is very haunting.and some, like 'slave to love' take on a jaunt, even humorous tone.<br /><br />i have to admit that, outside of 'avalon', i didn't know any of these melodies and the recent film version of 'the great gatsby' didn't help me love the new arrangements. but now that i have listened to them on a couple of road trips i have tapped my fingers and even danced a charleston or two down the grocery store aisle. it is a fun witty set of tunes and i hope avalon fans aren't too disappointed about the end result.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I was so very addicted to this game. It was very difficult to stop playing it. I highly recommend it to all ages of players.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|When Joe Walsh writes new music he has a special talent for creating a feel for the whole album that is from the school of hard knocks. He has lived quite a life!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Keeps me entertained has a lot of quests the only thing I recommend is to speed up the time it takes to restore your energy
B00BW0QC8G|4.0|Originally for me until `not me' saw and it was sucked away like a hoover vacum.<br /><br />The light weight is amazing for it's size, heft and sturdiness.<br /><br />We use it for airplane travel and it's a breeze to fit our Sony Viao and our iPad plus in the middle we put the HP Touch, a mouse,  chargers and our Garmin GPS. Plus a sweater and sweatshirt if we get cold.<br /><br />The zippered pockets are easily accessible and smooth to open and close.<br /><br />Very Ergonomic - liked it so much we bought it for our soon to be college freshman.<br /><br />I am hoping the price will come down - it seems a little steep for what it is.<br /><br />Winner!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Sometimes the second book isn't as good as the first one but this is not the case with this series. I can't wait to read the third book.
B00DRDVHA4|5.0|Love this album!!!! Marc always brings his A game to his albums and this one is no exception. Que viva la salsa!!!!!
B009WO7NQO|2.0|I play this game on my samsung galaxy...it was free. why does it cost 2.99 for my kindle? it doesn't make sense to me...
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Great game. Love it. Have it on my iPhone and I play against friends through Facebook but on my kindle fire HD it will not connect.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Read the series right after the first season of Game of Thrones came out on HBO, amazing TV show, even better book. I'm currently rereading, this series is PHENOMENAL when you already know what's going to happen, you can see all the little pieces moving and events happening in the background, building up to the exciting conclusion.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Very cute game including all the characters we love. So much fun, you almost don't realize you're learning at all! WARNING: this game can be very addictive!
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|First of all its The Beatles, so there is no better content for a movie.<br />Second, the conversion to Blu-Ray is top shelf.<br />I had a copy of this movie on VHS, and DVD, and the detail and pristine color are far superior to either.<br />And someone has taken the musical numbers to heart, as they are great to listen to in Dolby 5.1 surround sound.<br />The story is good, (although not as good as A Hard Day's Night) but entertaining none the less.<br />I was not disappointed in the least, and recommend it to any Beatles Fan anywhere.
B00APACSJG|4.0|However, if you are not familiar with Miles Vorcosigan do not start this book. You will not understand most of the underlying content and meaning
1781162646|2.0|Was not what I expected from the master of the thriller, horror, supernatural composition. The &#34;hard-case crime&#34; from Mr. King is not for me. Wish I had only borrowed this one and not invested my cold hard cash.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Once again SF and romance team up in an excellent Bojoled book.<br />As it is part of the Vor series, readers who red it will fined it a grate book. However it is a separate book and one can read it without reading the previous books.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|Want to go a little nuts!  Set your pen or fingers too sudoku. It will drive you stone batty. BIG-TIME-FUN.
B0093LINT2|3.0|People that like to move pc location a lot will like it the most. the only issue with it is the heat.
0553801473|5.0|hmmm, I would say this book and feast for crows just building up toward something! I don't want to spoil it but you will feel bored through some chapters.<br />this book had some twists, good ones, if you are a big fan of the targaryens!<br />I'd say be prepared to know some shocking truth  and endings of major characters<br />one more thing, I felt like he introduced some characters and he just killed them off and that was so useless! since I am a big fan of the targaryens, I loved this book haha<br /><br />Enjoy<br />I recommend the book :)
0545265355|3.0|The rating is not due to the aesthetic. It's a beauty. Hardback books with covers inside a cardboard box encasement. The rating is more of about the contents itself. The Hunger Games was great, Catching Fire was good, and Mockingjay was not bad. Therefore, three stars.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The description was exactly as the product was when it came to me. It was in perfect condition. We enjoyed it! Thanks!
B00BH0VSM6|2.0|I found this hard to get into. I couldn't understand why the Scandanavians would send a detective to Australia to basically get set back on the sidelines of a murder investigation of an ordinary citizen. A reason was given (the young woman was a minor TV celebrity) but it just didn't jell. Somehow the dialog and descriptions of the setting were staid and not too engaging.
B005544V6A|5.0|Really love the first season.  Looking forward to watching he second season. It's not your run of the mil USA show. Really gets you involved.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this app and it is very easy to download and use, and it works great with my kindle fire hd!
B002U3CCKQ|1.0|After reading gone girl and sharp objects this book was less than I expected. I did not even finish it.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|The only thing I didn't like about this app was how short it was.  I loved trying to figure out where the clues were and what they meant.  I'm sure it would help us seniors with our memories.  Thanks to the developer for making is a free app of the day!  Hope you add additional floors!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I keep getting a message at the top of my news feed that Facebook needs to update, but when I go to the app store to update there are no new updates.  Either keep up with all the updates or get rid of this app.  So annoying!
B0029ZA3H4|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was so cool. It is definitely one of the books that I will remember and hopefully with my new information, I crush it. And cash in on my future.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|At least I didn't buy it.  I would probably not watch it twice.  Same old story, boy meets girl, girl is going to be eaten by a giant, boy saves girl.  Graphics are good.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The new update is not user friendly and took a good, functional weather page to a cacophony of useless gibberish.
B00CDCIQX6|3.0|Many different timeline going on at the same time with very little notification when storyline shifts from one timeline to the next.  After a while it began to fall into place.  Better to rent before buying if you think you want to see this story.
0425263916|5.0|Read the first of this series and wanted to find ouit what came next. Plot doen't change a lot but interesting reading.  Not sure I'll continue with the last book in the series.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I bought this on a Saturday when I was home alone and wanted to watch something different.  Thought it was a kids movie.  Never read any of the reviews.  Glad I saw it.  Good storyline, and graphics.  Put together something line &#34;Big Fish&#34;, by the way the seems were shot.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I like it . I wish there were some more features for battle though . And cheaper prices on the planes and stuff after level 3.
B0026772N8|5.0|A second reading brings equal joy and anticipation of a third. The Quality of the reading experience more powerful than the  limits of these words.
140006922X|5.0|All of you Fox News believing Christians out there who claim that the author, Reza Aslan, is out to destroy Christianity, need to see the interview on this webpage. He is a Muslim, but he is not out to destroy Christianity. You can listen to it or read it and learn the truth before you bear false witness against Mr. Aslan. In case you are wondering, bearing false witness is telling lies about a person, and happens to be number nine of the ten commandments that you want to post in front of courthouses and elsewhere. Here is the webpage--<br /><br />[...]
B005LAII80|5.0|By old school I mean the down & dirty, no apologies, no holding back action & dialogue you would expect to hear out of a bad ass like Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />Visuals are brilliant too. 3D or no 3D, you'll be impressed.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Oblivion wasn't a dynamic bang `em up, annihilate the universe sci-fi. It was steady, uncomplicated and extremely enjoyable. Cruise's performance is good (not a big fan of his, but he does have that charisma that is caught on film and makes it work extremely well). The premise was really good; the plot was a twist I did not even anticipate, but it was a really nice surprise for a sci-fi flick. The visuals and special effects are outstanding! Overall, it was an extremely enjoyable and entertaining Saturday night movie. For you sci-fi fans who need a fix, give this a look-see! Highly Recommend!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This Mahjong game is a very relaxing game, and helps pass the time away when you have nothing else to do.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Great version if Magic!  This is coming from someone who hasn't played M:TG since the late 90's.... Believing the magic!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game, I'm sorry I'm finished.  I could play this if there were a thousand rooms to escape from!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Great game fun for everyone. My six year old can even play it and she thinks it is great too.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|fun but this game had way to many ads you click something ad comes up play new game ad comes up its a lot of waiting<br />also when startinqg you need more coins and the bonuses sometimes don't register so you don't get the full points you win ....
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|LOVE IT! It was exactly what I was looking for. Very easy to follow the app &amp; plenty of different boards to play on. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Thw Wizard of Oz (1939) has always been one of my favorite classic stories . Oz. the Great and Powerful, is the first vrsion that taks you back as close to the classic WOO as any has ever come and therefore is the most believable and fun to watch.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Planned a camping trip in Colorado over the weekend of the 26th thur the 28th of july near Fairplay Colorado. Weather channel called for rain thunder storms all weekend long, we watched the weather channel for 4 days prior to going, almost didn't go, ALMOST. We decided to go any way, glad we did. The weather was fine, sunshine thu the day light rain at nite, highs in the mid to upper 70s. I wont depend on the weather channel again
B007P7UF0G|4.0|wonderful love story, great music always a good story of King Arthur and his life. Love Gwinn and her  ways with men
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I rated this book 5 stars mostly because it kept me turning pages wanting to read more. Also because it's just Avery good well written book.
B00821OX98|4.0|Okay, so pardon the pun. I promise, the writing is much better on the show. Very pleased with all aspects, from relatable, human drama to plot progression to dialogue to character development. Any fans of post-apocalyptic alien fiction should definitely check it out.<br /><br />Did I mention how hot Noah Wylie is?  Perhaps I could have left that unsaid... but I don't think so.<br /><br />Looking forward to season 2.
B008602KQI|5.0|I ended a boring Saturday night by browsing the Internet. After realizing that I had already paid for a year of Amazon Prime, I decided to put to use the feature of free instant movies on Amazon's list of available movies. At first I was hesitant about watching the hunger games because I had created a prejudice against it thinking it was too similar to twilight or Harry potter which are two movie series that I deeply despise. However, I decided to give the hunger games a chance, and it far exceeded my expectations. It starts off slowly but it leaves you wanting more and this is why I continued watching. Overall, everything you'd expect/demand from a very good science/dystopian is covered in this very good movie that instantly became one of my all time favorites. Cant wait to watch the 2nd hunger game movie at the
B00DHNB5CY|5.0|Huge, huge fan of the original(s) and was very worried they were going to Star Wars Episode 1 the franchise. This is hands-down the best remake I've ever seen and I loved it just as much (if not more!) than the original(s). There are so many nods to the original, from the rusted car they sit on to the necklace in the shape of a skull on the ground to the Michigan State sweatshirt. Absolutely amazing and would recommend to any fan of the original(s).
B004MC0FO8|5.0|It does exactly what I expect it to do :) I have  no problems with it. It may no  have all the lyrics to every song, and sometime  it tells me it's a different version of the song when it's not, but it doesn't bother me.
B00B935SUY|4.0|Super interesting historical account of the famous studio and sound board. Ironically, the sound wasn't quite right for my system? The dialogue was significantly lower than the music clips? Great documentary regardless..
B008B68IUY|5.0|If your Monster High loving daughter already has several Monster High dolls, especially if any are from the \\"Scaris: City of Frights\\" line or if she has seen and enjoyed the TV special of that name, here is a gift possibility that represents a nice change of pace from yet another doll or yet another package of clothes for them.<br /><br />No assembly is required for this toy (Thank GOD!), but as per usual, you've got a good half hour of work ahead of you to unpack it, and you will need a Phillips screwdriver and a pair of scissors at the very least.<br /><br />As we've come to expect, the car is chock full of MH details: rot iron (get used to it; the MH universe is chock full of lethal puns and wordplay), spider webbing, and Fleur-de-lis body styling details, skull wheel covers, and gargoyle stick shift and taillights.<br /><br />Note: The seat belts are adjustable and unfastenable, though not in an intuitive way: the center of a pair of seat belts is fixed; you adjust or unfasten the belts at the sides, the opposite of how you do it in a real car.  Because it has been made into a seat, the trunk is rather small.  I don't think even one of the remarkable rolling suitcases that come with dolls in the Scaris line will fit inside, but several of their purses will.<br /><br />Fun and durability shouldn't be in much dispute, but you might be wondering about educational value. I submit this toy is educational if only in the area of puns and clever wordplay; I counted at least eleven. Of course whether you WANT your daughter to learn about making puns is another matter; personally, I prefer to fight fire with fire, bad pun with worse pun,...<br /><br />until we are both asked to leave.<br /><br />Note: No dolls are included; the car seats four MH dolls.<br /><br />Note: With leg room for the front seats extending all the way to the front grill and enough slack in the adjustable seat belts at full extension to easily fit [[ASIN:B0006M1ANI Barbie's Friend Midge with Pregnant Tummy and Baby]] in the back seat as well, (if you are crazy enough to strap a nine months pregnant Midge to the unprotected back seat, that is,) this car will seat four of virtually any approximately Barbie-sized dolls you can find.Tummy and Baby]] in the back seat as well, (if you are crazy enough to strap a nine months pregnant Midge to the unprotected back seat, that is,) this car will seat four of virtually any approximately Barbie-sized dolls you can find.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|Ok so we have good graphics and good play controls from what I can see. I haven't done any of the online multi player stuff yet, just the tutorial, but it looks like a really well done game. I've been impressed with other games by the same maker so I'm sure this one will be fantastic too.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|In areas where there is much snow or much rain, it is most important for us to know the forecast for accumulated snow or rain so we can plan our time / schedule.
B0061S073A|5.0|I got this app to lock down my device for my son, who is 18 months old.  Now I no longer have to worry about apps getting deleted and losing my saved data, and he only sees things I have selected for him.<br /><br />Occasionally when you press the home button the carousel will briefly appear, but Kid's place will kick in.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|Fairly good read, not too repetitive as others have said.  Seems a little rushed towards the<br />end, with lots of &#34;oh then this must have happened because of that&#34;- in a hurry up & tie up<br />all these loose ends- sort of way.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|I have to say that it has much eye candy . Popping cinema photography , and rich color . If you own a 3d tv like I do then your in for an even better treat .
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled hosseini is my favorite author and this book proved to be amazing, just as I expected.u feel as if u are part of the story, not just an outsider looking in..Great book
B00A77II0U|5.0|Story line was rather bizarre but that is the point after all! I hate clowns and find them really creepy, even before Gacy (but he definitely sealed the deal with me after that!)! And this clown is over the top creepy! A lot of the dolls are pretty freaky weird too! It is soooo creepy.....IT'S TOTALLY AWESOME!!!<br /><br />As in most HO games like this, it means a lot of back and forth, however the area is pretty confined with lots of rooms so it doesn't seem to annoy so much and the graphics are amazing (extra kudos to the artist/s!!)! This is the best game I've played so far in this genre! Length is great, the puzzles are for the 'normal' person rather than a rocket scientist, and the bonus chapter actually clears up an area mid-puzzle which was totally unexpected! I love surprises, don't you?<br /><br />The price? Perfectly reasonable and well worth every penny! The dialogue was pretty simple-minded in places but made me actually smile and laugh at times so not only was it an entertaining albeit bizarre storyline, it was awesomely creepy and humorous too! A little something for everyone! Yeah! It was way cool!
B000FC1MCS|5.0|I gave &#34;The Curious Incident&#34; top rating because of the strength of the narrator's voice and the originality of both the plot and the point of view. I was entertained every step of the way. Seeing the strange events of the story through the eyes of the autistic boy was compelling and touching, especially the portrayal of his feelings towards his father, which combined an uncanny detachment with an awkward respect, appreciation and an attachment that can only be called love. This is a fresh insight into how strongly such a boy might feel about a person close to him.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|I never get tired of reading this book. It is not only a spiritual journey of the characters in the book, but takes the reader on one as well.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|We have used this now about 4 times and it works really well makes starting the charcoal a breeze.  Instead of newspaper we use a bit of cotton rag soaked with cooking oil and the coals are ready if about 10 to 15 minutes.  Some reviews say it gets to hot to handle<br />they must be waiting to long to empty the coals I don't find this to be a problem.  The directions state to wear a mitt to handle but I don't use one and have not found the handle to be too hot.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book clearly identifies the major viewpoints prevalent in each spouse and how to bridge the differences between their primary viewpoints.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This is a great show and a must see. Something everyone should watch. Just the right amount of drama and intrigue.
B004LROUW2|3.0|I am a pretty big Murakami fan. Post-graduation and feeling completely uncertain about the future, I picked up Norwegian Wood on a whim and fell in love with the character Naoko and her belief in the healing power of cognitive thinking. I loved his delicate phrasing, his characters' sensitivity, their abilities to look into life like a dark well and reflect on how sad human existence can be, or how weird, or how sexy or how mysterious or how full of joy or wonder. He has a power to capture intimacy with the careful poise of fingers walking along a leaf's edge. When it comes to emotions he is a craftsman, and these insights are paired with the most refreshing balance of the practical, everyday big picture, which a reader can extract real value and pleasure from. On the flip side, one of Murakami's other major strengths is his flair for the bizarre, as found in The Wind-up Bird Chronicle. If not as heartbreakingly intimate as Norwegian Wood, his flirtation with ideas as entities that move and shape the world are perfected here (one of my favorite parts is when the character \\"Cinnamon\\" is surveying a house to make sure everything is spotless and in its place. \\"Perhaps he saw himself as lending just the slightest hand when things were driven by an intense inner desire to return to their original forms.\\" Perfection). And for all Murakami's strengths, I think I most of all love the rush; beginning a book of his is always a slow, meditative practice, asking you to stay with it, and you stay with it, because you want to see if it goes anywhere, and then all of a sudden there's a woosh and you take off into the story, flipping chapter to chapter, feeling regret when you have to put it down. It's not that the army is at the king's door, ready to sack the throne, or that the scientist is holding human destiny in the palm of his hand. It's that you never pondered how terrifying or strange the zoo at night could make you feel, and what that means about reality, or if that's reality at all. Or you never thought about how much you love someone in terms of percentages, and if there is possibly someone out there that is 100% tailor made to love you and what if your girlfriend is only 88%, only 62%. It's asking what it means to be the world's only professional skyscraper tight-rope walker or being so good at fashion design that you can start to design people's thoughts. Murakami's great talent is asking you to look at life from a different way, and when you do you see things from a beautiful, odd, thrilling new light.<br /><br />So what, then, happened with 1Q84?<br /><br />This novel reads suspiciously--shamelessly--like an unedited first draft. It needs editing. Bad. In fact I think the editors were either afraid to touch the hallowed words of such a literary icon, seeing as it was clearly meant to be an opus of sorts, or else they were vest-clad dewey-eyed hipsters who hang on Murakami's every jazz, fashion and sex philosopher reference like it's some kind of coveted underground electronic currency. It's a shame, because it started with so much potential, but the truth is that it could have at least been cut in half.<br /><br />It drags. It repeats itself. Things never ever get resolved. All the elements that I love about his writing were present, but they were so stretched out and heavy-handed that I began to resent every little bit. Physical description of fine details is something Murakami does particularly well, and yet we have probably near 50 pages of one character's grotesque appearance alone. And it would be okay if it mattered to the story, but it doesn't. The plot is in essence a love story, and yet the two characters spend some 600 pages piddling around their respective apartments, making food (each meal described in full detail), flipping through books on the couch, thinking about going to bed, or staring out the window. You are literally sitting there reading about people's miniscule tasks, one by one, frittering away the day. Again, this isn't a particularly new element in a Murakami book nor a particularly off-putting one; the mundane must be present to offset the surrealness of the larger narrative, but in 1Q84 this is the bulk of the book, and you are asking so much of the reader to devote several hundred pages to putting up with it. Perhaps this illustrates the maxim that too much of a good thing is bad. You have the makings of a classic Murakami tale: abstract thought, deceptively peaceful Japan shielding a more sinister world, a dreamlike enchantment, love, sex, music, violence (particularly sexual violence and muted, secret violence), high speed car chases, elegant symphonies, aliases, alcohol-fueled capers, dry humor and interactive realms, and yet the book is too long, too big for any of these elements to become cohesive. It is almost like accidentally dumping the whole bag of flour into the mixing bowl. It had potential, but it never got there.<br /><br />Other reviews I have read have smartly referenced some particularly troubling aspects of the novel: in particular the element of sexual violence toward girls and women. One of the characters is a particularly dastardly predator, and yet his redemption is peaceful, while we never again hear of his victims' fates or well-being. What started off as a really gripping plot twist (vengeance against a sexual cult) gets lost in abstractions before it fades completely out of existence. I suppose responsibility to the subject matter means something different to each person, but it's jarring and frankly disturbing to simply cast off such an important and sensitive topic. Again, an editor could have been used here.<br /><br />I would like to list some things I did like about the novel:<br /><br />- Aomame's beautiful face gets contorted into a monster gape when she frowns, so much so that people audibly gasp and children start to cry.<br />- Tengo's engagement with the literary process and the act of creative writing is inspiring, lovely,and classic Murakami: creativity shapes the world. Creativity is power. This is one of the elements that kept me going.<br />- Japan is a mysterious and vast place full of skyscrapers, danger, lights and magic, and sometimes the entrance to the next world is as close as a staircase.<br />- The Dowager. How badass a name is that? She's worthy of her title: she's a martial arts fighting geriatric who runs a safe house for battered women. She also has a little side business to uh, have a little chat with some of their abusers. She has an equally badass assistant named Tamuru.<br />- Jazz, cats, hotels and bars. Of course.<br /><br />Many people have stressed that first-time readers of Murakami should pick up another book first and I wholeheartedly agree. Kafka on the Shore is one of his most celebrated novels, and Norwegian Wood is beautiful and simple and such a worthwhile read. 1Q84 is not without its merits, but I fear that it would put otherwise interested readers off by its sheer volume. I give it three stars not because it was a pile of garbage, but because I know he can write so much better than that; I saw the elements there. They just didn't connect. Whether or not this was because of the lack of an editor or some other worrisome factor, I hope it doesn't continue into his new novel, \\"Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage.\\" (That title. I can't make up my mind about it!) I will continue to read and enjoy Murakami, and while I AM glad I read 1Q84, it was only a job half done.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|As a true believer that doing puzzles help keep the mind sharp and operating at peak performance, whenever someone asks me what my favorite kind of puzzle is, I always respond with, \\"Any David Lynch film.\\" Every clue to solving his puzzles is presented somewhere in his films, but like a true artist, he leaves it up to you to discover it and put the pieces in place. This film is what David Lynch has been working up to his whole career. To know anything about the story before watching it unfold beautifully in front of you will rob you of the sheer magic of this film. If you're a 'check your brain at the door' kind of moviegoer, this movie is NOT for you. If you crave intelligent moviemaking, films that get stuck in your brain for days after viewing, this film is worth more than every penny you will spend on it.
