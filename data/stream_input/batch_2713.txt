B0051ANPZQ|5.0|&#34;Wonder&#34; is a very emotional and funny book. It will make you laugh and cry and smile. It's a page-turner with great characters with vibrant personalities. It also teaches young people lessons for life. This is a great book, definitely read it!<br />-Sofia R.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|Season four does not disappoint, funny and witty writing as usual, I think Ed O'Neil has always been the &#34;star&#34; of the show but I think with this season all the characters have been developed even more and they are all equally as funny and mesh exceptionally well together!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The Alien Anthology is without a doubt the best all around compilation I have ever purchased. Its really a shame that every compilation isn't this complete and well thought out. Including both theatrical and special editions? Check. Spectacular blu ray transfers with amazing picture and sound quality? Check. Including every special feature/extra ever created? Check. Putting extras on blu ray instead of dvd? Check. Compact, shelf saving case instead of some bloated, oddly shaped monstrosity that needs its own special shrine? Check. Well designed digibook that won't scratch your discs up but still holds them securely? Check. Bonus: Got on Gold Box sale for under twenty bucks! WOW!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game - just wish it was longer and had more  re-playability.  Hopefully they will come out with another one soon. I would definitely get it. I recommend this game -  it's free and fun!
B009AMANBA|5.0|Nice  Movie<br />Good  Great<br />I got  this for  my  Dad<br />buy  this  now<br />Your  family  will love  this  movie  lots
B007WFQZF0|5.0|i am a long-time Liars fan & have all their albums. this one sounds nothing like any of their others, being that it's mostly electronic, yet it is this one that is now my favorite
B00CWVFPGO|3.0|Entertaining movie. A bit corny in places, but would you expect anything less from Arnold? Overall, I enjoyed the \\"underdog wins\\" kind of story.
B000W93CHC|5.0|It's as interesting as the first one written (Pillars of the Earth).  Ken Follett at his best, as usual.  I love reading it, and will be sad to finish it. Characters have become old friends.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Captivating mind-candy...the kind that stays with you in that &#34;Wow was that something really good or what&#34; kind of way!
B006OCM0G0|3.0|No longer interested. Purchased by mistake. Not child friendly and totally do not like that everything is at a cost. Please remove. Too costly.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|One of the best Music documentaries ever! A true and somewhat tragic story about a fabulous Detroit Musician who became hugely famous, mostly in South Africa, and somehow got overlooked in his own. A must see!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I've played many like it. And this is just as good as all the rest
B00BU18U82|5.0|This game is incredible now as I start to grow up as an adult I'll end up being a farmer this is a good head start on my future plus a good game
B00CL8D83U|1.0|Oh No,why do i hate this psb Electric THIS much .I'm fan of EVERY album until now listening now..and have been BORED ,yes bored..a word i'd never imagined using to use whilst describing listening to a new PSB cd.There's ENOUGH highly produced house/electro/techno out there already in an saturated genre as it is.Why did it have to bleed all into our boys music.A rap on \\" Thursday\\" ? REALLY ?  Plain just makes me sad.Sorry It's just how I feel.One star for the nice try :(
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Love it... Great game, reminds me of classic platformers like Mario, etc, except with fantastic 3d graphics.  Really like this game, I highly recommend it.
B000VWE5OY|2.0|After me and my husband watched all the episodes of Primeval on Netflix we thought we would give Torchwood a try.  We assumed it would be similar to Primeval with a sci-fi edge.  You know what happens when you assume!  First of all, I cannot even watch the show without subtitles.  Being an American I had a hard time picking out some of the characters dialogue, especially the Welsh actors. I could catch some words but definately not all of them so we had to watch with subtitles so I wouldn't miss important dialogue.  Secondly, as we have only watched 6 to 7 episodes so far I find the show to be one of those that you either love or hate.  It is not very engaging like I hoped it would be, it is somewhat dullish at times and some of the acting is either too much or too little?  The story lines are interesting enough but the execution of them isn't phenomenal.  I think the one with the evil fairies is the only one I have liked.  I don't care for the barrage of language or the unnecessary sexual comments but that's just me!  I think at this point my husband and I will abandon the show if some viewer can assure us it will get better as episodes progress.  Comments very welcome!
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|As much as I enjoyed the book. I can not give it more stars. I twice done experiment one and no results. I follow the instructions by the letter and rare coincidence.
0143034901|5.0|If you love books, especially mystery and suspense you will love this book. Tears in my eyes at the finish! Man card taken away. ;)
B000056QE5|5.0|My daughter loved this movie as a child and loves the music. She was thrilled to receive the soundtrack and still sings along!
B003UESJH4|4.0|I am not one to believe in divine right or any of that British royalty junk. They are lucky humans and subject to the same pit falls we all face. Very well acted I enjoyed this film.
1609611543|5.0|If you are interested in learning all about the wheat that we consume today, you MUST read this book.  You will gain valuable information about how wheat was once a healthy item in our diets, but has now become a problem for most people.  I learned a lot by reading this book.  It helped me to make better decisions about what i feed myself and my family.  If you are looking to be more healthy and to lose some weight, this is a good choice.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Takes me back to the good old days. I love being able to play with other people instead of just playing with the computer.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|must have ..amazing fun.if u r a minion fan u will love this app.. the movie in the beginning it funny too
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I use this app pretty much every day. I often find it's more accurate than my own local weather report, and I like the user-friendly layout. The alerts and advisories are helpful too. A very useful app! I've learned to depend on it.
B00957T6X6|5.0|i am obsessed with the books and am almost at the end-- can't wait for book 6 to come out!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too difficult but challenging.  Wish there were more levels. Really enjoyed.  I played on and off for a couple of weeks.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Really loved it, the product was perfect, big fan of the series and looking to get the next season. Fantasy, scheming and fighting! Loved it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I read the reviews before I got it and I was expecting just a connect-the-dots type game. wow was I wrong!!  this game starts that way but gets very thought provoking. I am playing it all the time. I have other things I should be doing but I am hooked!!!  you wont regret this game no matter your age.
B000B589JI|1.0|I suppose I should have heeded the other reviews more. Like the others, this leaked IMMEDIATELY. I didn't use it or carry. I opened it, filled it, and closed it. Laid it on the counter and was rewarded with a puddle of fluid. I retightened both seals and same result. It's absolutely worthless. Frankly Amazon should pull the product. Nothing like leaking a flammable fluid in a bag or clothes. I tried to rate it with zero stars but Amazon won't allow it.
159463176X|2.0|I love his other 2 books. This one was a let down. I got to 200 pages and couldn't finish it. I hope to try again but it seems to jump all over the place and never really seems to make sense.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Eighth grade humor. Silly. Neither the wife or I could last to the finish. Don't waste your money on this dog.
193700788X|4.0|I was really not satisfied with this as a ending for all the books.  And I am not saying things didn't go how I wanted them to, because I am not the writer I was just along for the ride!  Yet this book just felt like any other in the Sookie series.  I still enjoyed it but it was like good Chinese...I am still hungry for more!
B000X67ZZE|5.0|it comes highly recommended. got the companion book to go with it. This book has been teaching me a lot about my self.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|there's a glitch on level 3. unable to obtain object from cupboard. please fix problem. anyone else have same issue?
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|My humble opinion....With all the movies/DVDs on the market and a majority of them being \\"DUDs\\", this is the exception and one I would highly recommend to see.  The visual effects are beautiful... for a moment it made me want to be there experiencing the beauty of nature....NOT shipwrecked though!!!  I cried once during this movie, the thought of being separated from someone you love (and Robert included) has a profound way of touching your heart.... when it may be the \\"END\\".  I like how the animals seem so human (emotionally), like the interaction between just the animals on the boat, wasn't just a hunting for food, but a matter of survival in the midst of no-win situation, as people would react in the same situation.  But the interaction between MAN and BEAST can also be beautiful and touching.  The eyes are the window to the soul and I felt I saw this portrayal in both the man and the animal(s).  Shipwreck movies always make me wonder what I would do.....and I'll leave it at that.  Good movie to see.
B008HK3XKO|3.0|Did not like after I purchased this product I got an e-mail the next day offering 50 percent off this product when I paid full price. Why couldn't I have gotten that savings at time of purchase?
B009NQZVKG|5.0|As always James Rollins has written a great book. I would recommend this book to everyone and would recommend they read the other books that he has written.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is such a cute game. I love the little minions. More fun than Temple Run as far as I am concerned. Can't. wait to run further!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I loved this story. Santiago is one of the best-written and developed characters I've ever read. Even though this book is very short, it is dense. I found that I often needed to stop for a few minutes to process what I had just read. I know it was sparsely written with the intent of being thought-provoking, I wanted to know more about what the author and Santiago thought. I enjoyed reading every word. In a way, reading this book is like being parched and drinking a glass of water that is a few drops short of what you think is thirst-quenching. It isn't until after you've finished that realize it was perfectly satisfying in every way, but a few more big gulps would've been welcomed.<br /><br />-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman
B003PBB4ME|4.0|Works wonders for Smaller consumer camcorders, I had been using it to mount a boom / light combo and it stayed sturdy. Also helps for those down low shots.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My daughter and I love this game. Any a standstill now due to can't afford crystals. Should be allowed to buy them with coins you earn playing game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|As another reviewer stated, this series is destined to become a science fiction classic. It is the best I have read in the genre in a long time.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This new version is so hard to use I find myself looking at the newspaper to get the forecast. Please fix it an remove the ads.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|now it's here and i loved every minute.  I hate to say this but i'm hoping they will remake the wizard of oz movie too. not that i don't like  the old one.
1936719118|5.0|I have read \\"Anything You Want\\" twice already. Derek continues to amaze me with his ideas, wise yet uncomplicated. It's inspiring and fun to read, and I always get a great kick out of Derek's brilliant & unassuming style of writing.
014241493X|5.0|it was on time and I appreciate the quality of the product. That is what matters when purchasing online quality.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is a book I think kids in middle school could really understand and relate to. For example, the story talks a lot about bullying which is something kids in middle school have to deal with. But what really stands out about this book is that Auggie(the main character)deals with all of the conflict so well, which is what I really loved about the story. What I liked about the book was that it was split up into eight parts with everyone's view of Auggie. What I disliked about the story was that people saw him as a deformed person when he was really a nice boy with a good heart. Overall, I thought Wonder was one of the very few books that changes your point of veiw.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love Evermore and couldn't be without it. Use it on a constant basis across all of my platforms. Saves time,money, energy and frustration. Well worth having and using.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|My daughter loves it although she is in her 50's. It cheers her up  while her father is well.He also resides  in S.C.<br />sometimes.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|uninstalled from kindle fire after getting stuck in opening game ad...close ad to &quot;exit. you do not have access to this page&quot; go back to original screen to just get another ad with same message...disappointing...at least didn't have to pay for it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. The team acts really well together and there is a lot of action throughout the movie.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|City of Ashes is a good quick read. The characters are good-although some seem a bit forced. Clary is a bit of a damsel in distress which begins to wear on the reader, but she is beginning to pick up some empowerment. Overall, I recommend the series!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I liked this a lot and the whole idea of life after &#34;global warming&#34; almost became a reality and also the idea of no problem being too big to solve almost gives the reader hope for the future.
B004LROUW2|4.0|I really enjoyed the story; it was a fun concept.<br />It was quite repetitive in regard to the description of characters, and  places, and past events.<br />I feel like the author could have told the exact same story in 725 pages instead of 925 pages and it would have been a much better book.  Who edits this guy's books anyhow?  I mean how many time do you have to tell us about the shape and size of one of the main character's breasts, or the shape of another main character's head, or what another character's father did for a living, or that a certain beach area has a pine tree wind break, etc., etc., etc..<br />At the end of the day, it's a simple love story, with a wacky backdrop.<br />All that said, I am still glad that I read it.
B0031R5K72|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. One could feel one with the protagonist. This is a different way of approaching to a well known topic.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|Love it. Cant wait to buy the next season. Ive alwayes liked torchwood. I love John Barrowman. I must have more
B002VISNAS|3.0|This book gave me more confidence to go with my 'gut' feeling. (ha ha ha). A very good book that makes one aware of how we sometimes do not look or think about the obvious. We often do not think about the simple things in life and then we have to read a book to realise that we are equipped for this life we just have to be more in touch with our inner being.
B000AMUU94|5.0|David Bowie deserves to be recognized as one of popular music's most effective songwriters.  Beautiful melodies are pervasive in his music whether the genre is rock, punk, glam, or soul.  His songs sound fresh today, even though many we're written over 40 years ago.  Some annoyances on this collection:<br /> - No \\"Panic in Detroit,\\" one of rock's greatest head-bangers.<br /> - Bizarre (AM radio?) rendition of \\"Young Americans.\\"<br /> - Short version of \\"Heroes.\\"  A longer version of this masterpiece could have been included.<br /> - Some filler on each CD.<br />But these drawbacks don't significantly detract from an otherwise excellent collection.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|Item was as described and received quickly.  This is a great movie for those that like musicals, surprisingly, it was entertaining movie.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I like the innocence of the game. However my self I would never spend any real money to play a game so this limits my playing opportunities...sad that it's all come down to money. It has good graphics. The initial set up ,getting neighbors and inviting friends is a little confusing infusing as well. I'll keep playing.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|The items was a described.  It does help to keep the smaller cards together and I don't have to hunt as hard to find them
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great information, up to date, helpful, I liked the maps and all of the forecasts I check it daily and it is convenient it's there when you need it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers will always be an awesome game. I really like how it changes after awhile. Like when it was China then Miami and now paris. This game is a great challenge and time waster altogether. I guess the only flaw  to it is all the ads. Other than that it's cool. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is is great!!! I enjoy it  very much, in glad I installed  it. I've been playing this game a lot. I recommend to everyone, kids to. It's a great game to play, and time passes by fast when you play. Overall great game!!! Happy that I got it
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is just like the real game! Compared to other slenderman games this one is.actually good. I love this game it is so worth the money
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I think this is a good game cause you can be iron man and that you can have a fun time and yet have a bit challenges throughout the game.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I USED TO HAVE THIS GAME ON MY PHONE TILL IT BRONE.NOW I HAVE IT ON MY KINDLE BUT IT WON'T ALLOW ME TO CONNECT TO FB AGSIN! I REMOVED THE APP AND EVERYTHING AND NADA HAPPENS... HELP ME FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONNECT TO FB PLEASE
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Merlin was an EXCELLENT family series that was brought to us by the BBC. The series was canceled after 5 seasons. Family oriented televion is hard to come by in todays world! Myself & my family are EXTREMELY SORRY to see it go : (
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Due to my fault, the one I ordered first did not fit the<br />Kindle Fire. It was for a HD. But this one is just great to fit in my handbag.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think it is better than Temple Run and very additive very fun for the little one to play on
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|it is fun and easy you can learn it fast also very good for kids. you can change minions. you can earn bananas and coins
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Use strategy and smarts to beat the game. That's all there is to it! Fun!<br /><br />Would like to have more like this :)
B007SYWFRM|3.0|The game is a lot of fun but when you tap on something it doesn't do it until you tap about 3 times
B00CA3C1N4|3.0|I never heard of it or lite so i tried it i didnt like it my 3year like connect  the dots she thought it was it but it was nothing like it it was fun till  10 minutes :(&quot;&quot;&gt;:(  yiur very lucky it was todays free app OF the day
B007FIY3VW|4.0|On the Galaxy Tab 2  10 inch tablet this app works just fine.<br />I don't expect a full blown office system on a tablet but one that allows me to do some work on Word and spreadsheets.<br />I have not used the excel section yet but the Word part is doing as I need.<br />My new keyboard has just arrived and I expect to be using the Olive Office Premium much more.<br />I do recommend it.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I watched it last night and it was better than expected!! A lot of people compared it to high school musical, but for me it was better than hsm! It's not like those ghetto ass high school film. The songs are also better than hsm. I bought the soundtrack on iTunes and I absolutely loved it! And the cast are perfect! :) good job disney!
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Well yes it is HD but you can't get to someones channel that is the problem. Other then that is is really good!
193700788X|3.0|I have just finished reading this, the last book in this series, and I was dissapointed.  Then I got on here and read some of the reviews... Though I've read every other book in this series with much excitement, I do not pretend to be an expert on the Sookie universe.  As a result, my disappointment is not directed at who she did or did not end up with, it simply just wasn't an exciting book, at all.  It is completely understandable that Sookie could end up with Sam, I just wish it would have taken more than a kiss by the side of his trailer to make than happen.  There was no passion, no chase; it wasn't even part of the plot really, it just happened at the end. And the writing of that flacid \\"sex scene\\" was so unecessary.  Then same with the departure of Eric... no passion at all, good or bad, from the writer or for the reader.  He should have gone out with a bang.  Though I'm not quite as passionate as these other scorned readers, it does seem like the ending of this series was kind of half-assed.
B00DQQZNZW|5.0|Not much to say beyond the fact that all the hype is indeed true. This is, hands down, the best electro pop album of the year, and possibly in recent memory.<br /><br />Favorites: Love is Bourgeois Construct, Shouting in the Evening, Last to Die.<br /><br />A truly stunning record from a band with a consistently solid output.
193609648X|5.0|I felt these techniques were challenging but fun to try. Beautifully illustrated. Love doing lace work this book offers many opportunities.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|I have 5 CDs by her with a couple more on the way. I have to admit that they are all excellent. I also have to admit that after spending six years in high school and college learning French, that I have a bias in favor of French songs. I will single out two singers who specialize in French songs. The first would be Madeleine Peyroux, who was born in the USA while her French parents attended college here. She made up for the fact that she is an American citizen by returning to the streets of Paris with her mother to sing French songs. If you liked Billy Holliday, you might notice that Peyroux sounds like her.<br />The second famous French singer is Carlo Bruni, an Italian who is married to a French official, has CDs named \\"quelqu'un m'a dit\\" and \\"Little French Songs.\\"  I would have to give her a nomination for the most French songs, which leaves us with A Brazilian who began singing the smooth Bossa Nova which I admire and is beginning to branch out into newer areas but still singing smooth jazz.<br />Finally, I would like to mention Sara Gazarek, who seems to be breaking out as a new star, Karrin Allyson, who can sing just about everything (her CD From Paris to Rio shows her versatility). I have 7 of her CDs and I like all of them. The last mention is for Halie Loren, a beautiful young woman who has a bright career ahead of her.<br />You can't go wrong with any of these young women, and there could soon be ten more out there that will be new stars.<br /> If I find some new voices out there, I will write a new review.
B004YXE438|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game in bed after a long day. It's simple and fun but challenging at the same time. With both puzzle size and difficulty options, you can easily solve at the level you wish. There is a wide variety of photos.
B00DIFARQ6|2.0|Game play is not very smooth. I've seen other flight sims with better control. That doesn't mean the game is not fun, it is. But it can get expensive loading other flights.
1416955070|5.0|I've had the first book for a while, but never had time to read. After seeing the movie trailer which I just love, I decided to give the book a chance and I'm glad I did. Once I started reading the books, I couldn't put it down. Cassandra sucks you in the Mortal Instruments world right away, I could not stop reading. Instead of going to sleep to go to work the next day, I stayed up reading and kept having sleepless nights.  I had to find out what happens next, I read the first 3 books in 5 nights. One of the fastest time I have read anything, nothing have pulled me in a world since I read the Twilight Saga. Of course Jace is a plus, I just love Jace. Even though he can very cocky, sarcastic, funny, and has a heart of gold.  I love the love that Jace and Clary have for each other. Yes sometimes they can be very selfish about it, but I love love and that I can understand. I do love all the action in the book and wish for more love chapters in the future. Great job Cassandra, you really got me hooked. Can't wait for the last book of the series, I hope it's everything we all want as an ending, I'm sure you wont' disappoint.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander tells in such detail what we all know in that deep part of us we often ignore.  The medical terminology is sometimes over the layman's head, but does not detract from a message that needs to be heard.  Wonderful, rich read.  Very thought provoking.
B005LFQRTC|4.0|Whats not to love? Steve Austin was like the Elvis Presley of the 007 spy world. He always did the right thing following his own infallible moral compass - this generation needs heroes like Col Austin instead of Spongebob or Pokemon!! They might appreciate their fellow man or at least be a bit less whiny and self-entitled!
B001F9Y2CM|5.0|If you get this collection you'll never fret over whether you have all of the individual Abba CD's or not. This collection covers all their songs with the exception of &#34; Get on the carousel &#34; and &#34; Just like that &#34; which aren't included.It has excellent audio quality.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|I have to admit Blu Ray DOES make a difference!<br /><br />A classic Sci-Fi movie and one of the best sequels ever. Well worth it!
B009IH0ICG|5.0|No more toxic petroleum based charcoal is needed when you have this.  Lights standard charcoal into an inferno with just a few sheets of paper.  This works every time to light your coals!
0312330529|4.0|This is one of the best books I have read. Fascinating  non-fiction account  of Gregory David Roberts experience in India.  I buy this book and give it as a gift!
1423101502|5.0|It was a great read! If you haven't read the other four first, i recommend you do because they are all amazing!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I bought it and it just says downloading 0%. I tried 3 others after and they were just fine. I think its bull and needs to be fixed.
B00DYEN5QU|1.0|Howdy;<br /><br />I just noticed that in the \\"Frequently Bought Together\\" selection, they have Man of Steel + Iron Man 3 + Star Trek 2.  The thing is Man of Steel is 3d+2d BD + DVD while Iron Man + Star Trek are only 2d BD + DVD.  If I am getting Man of Steel in 3d, would I really settle for other movies in 2d if they are offered in 3d?  I DON'T THINK SO.<br /><br />Just my thought on it...<br />L8R daze...
B00002N9ER|5.0|I live on a farm and sometimes I have to go out and checkout the area quickly to make sure my animals are safe from predators.  The mounting bracket allows me to quickly access the flashlight and keep it out of that way when not in use.  It brings the screws needed to mount.  Mounting is a 30 second easy job just screw it to the wall or where ever you want it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Absolutely love it!  I've not been this hooked on a series in a long time!! Reaching for Book Two... Now!!!!! :)
B0037BB00I|4.0|I love Adele's voice but this CD was no where as good as 21. This was an excellent album to come before it though. Glad I bought it.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Fascinating man with rapid cycling bipolar disorder and narcissistic personality disorder used in a constructive way.  Definitely worth a read
B00113N6KQ|1.0|Extremely disappointed. The video and sound quality are what you would expect from a vcr copy. I bought this movie because I had seen it before and loved it. Watching it through Amazon instant video after having purchased it makes me not even want to watch it; that's how bad the quality is. A rip off at $9.99
B0097PW7H8|5.0|Excellent Excellent Excellent Excellent Excellent ... Seriously get this for your Kindle you will love it & tinker with a little & get your settings just right don't just download it . Very easy to use!
B00AFEXRME|1.0|Pissed me off immediately - writing this AS I'm watching it, and ONLY still watching b/c husband wants to! OPENS with about 5 minutes of COMPLETE female nudity, entirely gratuitous, no need for it (= not essential to the plot). The exciting part of flying the plane that's going down is interesting, and then it all just BORES along from there......still trying to see if there's a point to the movie, committed to watching it now (about an hour in), but it's boring the crap out of me....
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Great movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game. super addicting and my daughter has a blast playing it. downloaded on my kindle. my daughters kindle and my phone.

B004X2M3N8|5.0|This season has all sorts of twists to it that I found exhilarating! The Doctor's death at the very beginning was like &#34;What?!&#34; and then you know that it has to be resolved sometime during the season. Amy and Rory's relationship is still adorable, especially when Amy is captured by the Silence and Rory can hear her thoughts through that recording implant; it's so cute at the end when he realizes she was talking about him when she said &#34;I love you&#34; and not the Doctor. All the River Song stuff is also very intriguing, even if the timelines are all screwed up... like usual :P The finale with her and the Doctor is adorable. There are also some fantastic individual episodes throughout this season, especially &#34;The Doctor's Wife&#34;, where the Doctor gets to talk to the TARDIS is human form, and &#34;Closing Time&#34;, where the Doctor visits Craig for one last time. Matt Smith really started to grow on me during this season, and now I can honestly say I am very fond of him as the Doctor.

B00BPA2PEI|3.0|I'm not going to review the movie, it speaks for itself and you either like it or not.  I purchased this disc to experiment with the 4K Mastering.  I can see little if any difference in this 4K mastered edition than my older Spiderman 1 BluRay.  I'm using a new Oppo Player with a Pioneer Kuro Elite TV.  Since I've just received the disc, I haven't had the time to call Oppo to determine if their new players support the Deep Color format but I'm assuming they do.  My Kuro TV does support Deep Color providing it's receiving the signal.  Since I'm not totally convinced the Oppo is setup for this format, I'll hold off further comments until I know for sure.  Other than that, this disc certainly doesn't blow me away.  I've got plenty of other discs that have much better PC.  Nothing great here, so far.  IMHO, it's all marketing hype by Sony trying to promote their new UltraHD TV's.  Until someone manufactures a player and software that truly output UHD material, I'll just keep my Kuro Elite PRO151 and my Oppo player.  I expected much better.

1451695195|2.0|This book was disappointing in several aspects.  It is certainly not a spiritually enlightening story and, in my estimation, was written in a manner to impress the reader with the author's intelligence and background.  Not a book I would recommend to anyone seeking a reassurance of the existence of heaven.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|I was a fan of Game of Thrones from page one, although it was possible to take a small flaw or glitch in the writing here and there. Yet there was never a doubt in my mind that a true master writer was at work. I've also enjoyed GOT on TV, although I consider it a \\"lite\\" version that doesn't quite live up to the novels.<br /><br />But when I read Tuf Voyaging, I was delighted to find another deep, funny, engaging, and captivating aspect of Martin's work. The stories are simply great, with a depth of insight and a sensitivity to character that is pure delight.<br /><br />I highly recommend Tuf Voyaging to anyone who wants to see a different perspective of this master writer. Forget the confines of any type of D&D or medieval genre you may have stuck George Martin into. He is at least as fantastic a science fiction writer as he is in the sword and sorcery genre. What a wonderful discovery!

0062014536|4.0|It obviously sucks that Alex was broken by torture, but it works narratively to break the love triangle and otherwise dull the annoyance of his 'resurrection'.<br />One of my online friends ships Hana/Lena, and reading some of Hana's earlier chapters, it's obvious where they got that from. Hana's dulled feelings in general highlight the devastation of the cure.<br />When Coral was introduced, Lena's jealousy was a nice little flashback of her feelings for Alex. However, the triangle kept being dragged out, a distraction from the steady action building later in the book.<br />The long action buildup was great. The assaults on Invalid camps seemed like a realistically negative development. I especially appreciated Lena and Hana still trying to do the right thing by each other.<br />I'm not sure how I feel about the unclear ending, and the bit of breaking the fourth wall at the very end. However, the seemingly obvious parallel to the fall of the Berlin Wall was great.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I have had this game forever but now it has some problems. The new update with glacier park seems to be the key. Every time I go into the aquatic park, it runs it for a sec, then it closes the game. Please fix this, for it is a fun game.

B0036EH3XE|4.0|I will say that I truly just did not get the ending of Lost; I admit to not being able to wrap my head around it. Having said that though, I will say that the series is well worth watching. It is television at it's most creative, exciting and original. There are so many truly touching moments throughout the series, and they are touching because characters were created that we could care about. My fave moments are actually the smaller ones...from Hurley getting a broken down vehicle up and running, and the guys going joy riding...to Vincent lying beside Jack at the end. To me, Lost was always about the more personal moments, and I would highly recommend the series for those alone.

0345803493|1.0|I'm saying \\"Later's Baby\\" to this series.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure when I was 15, if you had asked me to make a list of my qualities in a perfect man, it would have been Christian to a T, minus the weird emotional issues and sex problems. I'm serious. It's like they got a teenage girl to come up with her idea of a perfect guy, and BAM! there's Christian.<br /><br />One thing that I'd REALLY like to know... how is Christian a self made billionare (not millionare, and Ms. James has made that quite clear) but HE NEVER WORKS? He's constantly having sex with Ana, forcing Ana to eat, e-mail Ana, parading around with Ana... when does he work??? I don't believe we've seen this man working since the first few pages of the first book in this series.<br /><br />I'm getting so sick of the words \\"murmer\\", \\"gasp\\", \\"flush\\", \\"fifty shades of [fill in the blank]\\", \\"holy crap\\", \\"I bit my lip\\", etc. Ms. James uses these words on nearly every page. It's called a thesaurus. Use one. Or better yet, come up with something DIFFERENT to put on every page! Then you won't NEED thesaurus for the same words you use on every page!<br /><br />Also, I've had people tell me that their sex life was enhanced by this series of books? Are you frickin' kidding me? Your sex life was enhanced by THIS book? Did we read the same book? The sex scenes made me laugh. Christian says, \\"I'm going to take you now.\\" Then Ana bites her lip. \\"You know what it does to me when you bite your lip, Ana.\\" How has she not chewed a hole in her lip from biting it so much? Anyways, then they both have an orgasm, AT CHRISTIAN'S COMMAND, and not a second before. They fall into a million pieces together at the same time, and find their release. That's how each and every one is described. If that's \\"hot\\" and \\"steamy\\" for you, I really do feel sorry for you. Really. This book is just as horrible, if not WORSE than the first.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|The last two books of the series have moved very slowly. This book begins and continues mostly as a meandering story with too many characters, not enough plot, and muddy purpose. It's not until three quarters through that the action finally picks up and the plotlines move again. Martin is using too much exposition in these books. He has established the characters and hopefully in the next book instead of adding more characters and further slowing the story, he can give us more meat.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|I have seen this movie before, but learned a lot from the companion disk that I never knew.  There have been many movies about Pear Harbor, but this is the most accurate.<br />This film addresses the attack from two different perspectives: the American and the Japanese.  Three different Japanese directors, including Kurusawa, directed the Japanese portions.  Japanese wrote the Japanese part of the screenplay.  The planner of the attack, Commander Genda, wrote that portion.  Japanese pilots were interviewed for their perspectives.  After their surrender, the Japanese had to destroy all their offensive weapons, so there were no Zeros to use for this film.  The Zero was a copy of an American aircraft, so all the Zeros are American planes with Japanese markings.  All the locations where the events happened were used.  The Japanese built a full scale carrier and battleship.<br />The American parts were directed by an American.  American sailors and pilots who were there had input in the script.  Once again Hollywood portrayed events in its way, but then actual survivors told what really happened.<br />The Americans built a full scale replica of the Nevada and partial replica of the Arizona.  The rest of the fleet were miniatures that were viewed a pilots perspective.  All the original American locations were used.  Pearl Harbor was an American defeat, because of arrogance and stupidity of the American military mindset of the time.  The Japanese were not seen as a serious threat, but as comical and incompetent.  The movie was made so that America would not become complacent again.  I do not know if we learned that lesson.  More Americans were killed on 9/11 then at Pearl Harbor.

B00CA3C1N4|4.0|I have a weird relationship with space strategy games. I feel like I want to play, but every time I do I get bogged down with researching new items and trade deals etc. This game, however is both simpler and still gives you a lot to keep track of. It is basically a conquest game. The rules are simple, but keeping all your starts under control can be challenging. I was looking at this game for a while, but never decided to buy it. Now that is the free app of the day, I decided to check it out and I'm really enjoying it and being frustrated buy it at the same time :). If you miss the chance to get it for free, buy it anyway. It is definitely worth the price. In face, I bought 4 games for my birthday and this is the one I keep popping into.
B009KHCT94|4.0|Let's not get this wrong: the Nazi movement and the Second World War were terrible events that resulted in the tragic death of millions of people. What gets forgotten here though is that this should not be a taboo subject, this is something we must not forget and despite being a slapstick approach the movie raises some real concerns and sends a harrowing message about our current time (or rather the projected near future).<br /><br />The film begins with the USA sending a team to the moon as a publicity stunt to boost the President's public image. The president is a caricature of Sarah Palin, the team sent includes an African American model to show that the racial divide is gone (and one might argue there are a number of points here, such as IF we are pointing out something is gone, then it probably is not). Either way, they land on the moon and the model gets captured, while the other astronaut is killed. Oh yeah, captured by Nazis who have been hiding on the dark side of the moon, and been preparing for war.<br /><br />The secret reason why they went to the moon, which the President wasn't even aware of is that America wants to harness Helium 3 which is available in abundance on the moon and will solve their energy problems for a millennium.<br /><br />Meanwhile the Nazis on the moon are divided, on the one hand there is a massive military complex, but the children are taught that nazi-ism is a movement of peace. One thing leads to another and a team goes back to earth to get mobile phones (just watch the film) and to meet the president. They are mistaken as actors (that part doesn't fully make sense) but the publicist takes their message of peace to bolster the President's message, which is suddenly very strong in Nazi iconography and no one notices (think about it). One thing leads to another and the invasion of earth begins, which is also approximately where a lot of the footage from the trailer comes in.<br /><br />The worst part for me in the film was pacing. It was too slow in some parts and on re-watching it I can't help but feel the director was maybe padding or trying to build dramatic tension. Second time round though, the pacing didn't bother me, but be warned some scenes seem to linger.<br /><br />The other issue (not bad cause I'm a cinephile) is that there is a lot of references to other movies, where scene setups are appropriated. The most iconic one being from [[ASIN:B0009RCPUC Downfall]], that scene that was really popular on youtube for a while. Some of the people I was watching the film with did not recognize the references, and although they still loved the film, that import of the themes from the other movies won't give you pause to think, thus loosing some impact.<br /><br />But what is good? Well firstly, this is a B grade, Nazis from Space, pulp sci-fi film. And granted this is not something some people will be able to appreciate, but at the same time it is drawing parallels between then and now and it isn't just done for the Hogan's Heroes play of making the Germans look stupid and incompetent, but you may need to dwell on that for a little while.<br /><br />Secondly, although the concept isn't new, it is very current because it reflects on our current political climate, both form an America Centric perspective, but also with the wider impact on the world community (though in fairness this is relatively minor and the importance doesn't become apparent until the very end). In that vein it also deals with a great number of current issues centered around the intrigue of international politics. True it is always done slapstick, but basically it's the opposite of tongue in cheek, it's a joke, but with serious undercurrents.<br /><br />Third, for a relatively small budget (7.5 million) it does an incredible job with decent computer effects (the initial moon scenes are a bit poor, but they get better), great acting (for a B movie) with Julia Dietze being a standout and smart script. Keep in mind this isn'ta mega studio production, but for what it is, its amazing.<br /><br />As I said, this is a B grade movie, but this is the good kind. It's not in the category of \\"so bad it's good\\" rather it is just that: good. For me the concept and visualisation are especially great, but that it is making a message under all the slapstick is a big factor of why I think so highly off it.a mega studio production, but for what it is, its amazing.<br /><br />As I said, this is a B grade movie, but this is the good kind.

B00CL8D83U|1.0|Do the boys really need money or have they just reached the end of their career.Ive been a fan for the whole ride but this has to be the worst release ever.Where are the melodies,harmony or social commentary?This reminds me of a second bonus disc they might tack onto a major release.Hopefully they will get through this and back to what they do best.Hard to believe they are getting such positive attention on a release full of electronic repetition,empty,limited vocals and no melody to speak of.Ill take YES any day or even Elisium which is a masterpiece compared to this.

1451683405|1.0|First of all, the book ends after 66 pages. The rest is notes. I read this in about 45 minutes sitting in Barnes & Noble. It has the philosophical and scientific depth of an internet blogger. It contributes nothing original to the debates of free will.<br /><br />Perhaps it isn't \\"free\\" will, but self-control of some sort is an actual capacity. Regardless of whether or not we are ultimately \\"free\\", you can't deny that there's a difference between a brain with self control and one that lacks it. Harris regards something like a tumor making you do something criminal as just another instance of our behaviors being caused by something. This may be the case, but how philosophically relevant is that?<br /><br />I don't necessarily disagree with all of Sam Harris's conclusions. I'm a materialist, and an experimental psychologist (my speciality is a psychobiological approach to personality psychology in the tradition of Hans Eysenck, Jeffrey Gray, and Marvin Zuckerman). My career very well depends on the fact that our behaviors are caused and can be studied like any other thing. So in that regard I am also a determinist. My problem is that Harris glosses over subtleties which other writers address. This book is not only short and lacks any contributions, but it's severely lacking in depth as a result. This is one you can safely skip over, even if you are a Sam Harris fan. He discusses free will in The Moral Landscape, so just read that.<br /><br />Here's an article concerning free will written by two psychologists. It's full of good information and I'd recommend it over this book. [...]
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had seen a couple of spoilers (thanks for nothing, Yahoo!), which did not diminish my enjoyment of this season. The drama! The drama!
B004EWFV9K|2.0|Ok story although maybe does not come across as particularly plausible. Too much back story dealing with political events in Sweden as well as too many detours into Wallander's past which do nothing to advance the plot. Also Wallander tends to be maudlin, focusing constantly on aging, death, disease etc. After a while it became repetitive and annoying..probably my last mystery by this author.
B0063GORYU|5.0|As someone that's played a lot of card games,  this one is awesome! Haven't had any problems at all. Easy to read
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its so exciting and its fun to. You can do challenges to get free rewards. Its so fun so  I'm going to rate it 5 stars.
B000WC3864|1.0|I recently watched the remake of this movie, which was really good. So I thought I should watch the original. I do NOT understand how this movie got over 500 5 star reviews. I can understand the bad special effects because it was made in the 80s. But that's it. It was so bad! The acting was terrible. The camera was too noticeable. Why are there so many close ups of the actors faces? There was a scene where a character was possessed and every time the angle changed her hair went from straight, to long to curly. And when Ash gets sprayed by blood on his face and then enters the house there is no blood at all. Not even a stain. I understand the older people liking this when they first saw it. But when it's 2013 and your saying its still good, I recomend that you watch it again. Even for a low budget movie, they could do a lot better.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have enjoyed the You Version Bible. It has help me in my studies and also to take it with me almost anywhere I go
B008AWBQGW|3.0|I don't know what to make of this. I know this has a lot of the Street Survivors line-up but the songs and production leave me feeling like I just listened to a Nickelback record. The attitude and laid back bluesy swagger have been replaced by a modern rock (with a tinge of metal) sound. While I was listening to this it just didn't feel like I was listening to a Lynyrd Skynyrd record.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|PLEASE give me the option of keeping an older version. I used to look at a glance and see the weather for 5 or 6 cities, now it's a mess. I'm now going to weather bug.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|I thought the game was good but It wouldn't let me connect to Facebook but overall it was vert addicting and fun to play
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|needed a memory card that would hold more pictures since i will be taking a trip in the Fall to Washington DC
B006TAJ9WU|5.0|I have had other CROC'S in the past, but these far exceed what I anticipated. With my old set, I could feel rocks through the soles, and even bruised my heel a few times. Not so with these. These will definitely make my life of here in Afghanistan more bearable.
B005JR47R6|5.0|Probably the least favorite season for most fans, it was nevertheless still &#34;House.&#34; Its cancellation left a gaping hole in my viewing schedule. &#34;House&#34; raised the bar impossibly high, and few shows can ever measure up. It's astonishing how good the show really was, and how often it hit its target. The DVDs make it possible to really analyze every element in detail. From the acting to the sound effects, this was fine American craftsmanship at its very best. (And yes, I know Hugh Laurie is British. All the more impressive.) When it comes to broadcast television, it doesn't get better than this.<br /><br />I purchased the seasons separately rather than as an entire set, having read that the quality of the bundle left something to be desired. After a monumental &#34;House&#34; marathon -- eight glorious seasons viewed commercial free -- I can say that the quality of the DVDs is exceptional. The picture and sound are crystal clear. Each set arrived well packaged and in perfect condition. It's a good thing, because they're going to get a lot of use.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This by far has been the best free game APP EVER!!  Challenges your mind every minute!!  Hurry up with more levels!!  You have a winner here!!
0380730405|5.0|There's a common stigma among the younger generation that older books equate to boring books. An unfortunate interpretation, not helped by a poor choice of mandatory books throughout school.<br />I believe \\"Rebecca\\" disproves such misgivings about older literature. Although the book itself is not that old, it was not written in the past decade and thus not on the radar of many who are around my age, being in my early 20s. That being said, I HIGHLY recommend this to absolutely anyone, of any age, of any gender. It has its moments of hilarity, suspense, and occasional romance. I personally think it is a strange (but wonderful!) mix of Downton Abbey and a hint of CSI.<br />  This is an absolute MUST read. One of the best books I have read yet.
B00CA3C1N4|3.0|Well... Starlink is a Nano War clone with special abilities and a rank system. I loved it. All my original raving about the multiplayer on Google play? Gone! Multiplayer is broken for this version. I'm disappointed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was curious about his book because of all the hype I heard about it.  So much sexually charged text that had women flocking to the stands. I wasn't sure what to expect.  After reading the first couple of chapters, I found myself so curious about these characters, especially Christian.  At times I would be amused, angry, repulsed, intrigued...  I was all over the place.  When I finished the first book, I had to keep reading to find out what happened to these two.  I was thrilled when the storyline turned to one with a mysterious plot and a \\"who dunnit\\" kind of feel.  Yes, the sexual tension, confusion, frustration, and love was all still there, but now this mystery was closing in on these characters.  I loved it and hate that I'm done with this series. If you like romance, drama, naughtiness, and mystery, I would suggest giving this series a try.
B000ARFNNM|5.0|This purchase was for my wife and she absolutely loved it. Very happy with this purchase not to mention that this cd is now hard to find...
B0059GVBHG|3.0|It was ok.  I wouldn't  recommend it.  It was just an old 50's movie.  I  had bought the DVD as biue rey at first.  I had to return it since I don't have that feature.  So I look for it on the internet and deiced to purchase it.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Very detailed reading of a fascinating part of U.S. history.  It depicts Lincoln as a man of honor, humor and with great strategic skills. His time in office shows that politics has not changed much over the past century and more.  Those who are in office and want to do what is best for the greater good of all Americans are invariably doing battle with  those who look to their own narrow interests.  It was true then and remains so to this day although I am impressed that an order given by the President then was carried out, which fortunately or unfortunately as your politics dictate is not the case today.
B008Y73940|5.0|This movie is great to watch and of course Matthew McConaughey is great like always.  There is a lot that happens in the movie so pay attention :)
B0097EWK3A|5.0|very good mystery game and lenghty loved it cant wait to continue on the second one this one kinda reminded me of ravenhurst
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game!! Its so fun I have it on my phone also. I love the minions they are so funny! :)
B00AYB0SQQ|4.0|This movie should have been a total dud, but it's one of the most entertaining teen horror flicks out there in my opinion. Admittedly that's not a genre I watch much of, because they tend towards the predictable slasher type, which isn't my style. But I do enjoy a good monster and/or alien invasion scenario.<br /><br />The Faculty should have been a dud because there is absolutely nothing original in the plot or characters, and I do mean absolutely nothing. Name any movie with teens or monsters and you'll find elements of them in this one. Yet it works as an entertaining romp anyway.<br /><br />A humongous part of why it works is due to the casting. They mixed known with up and coming adult actors with some known, some up and coming, and some completely unknown young actors, and all of them did their part to sell the idea that none of the cliches were cliches. I was already familiar with a lot of the cast when it was originally released (which is when I first saw the movie), but quite a few of them are people I only know from later work (like Famke Janssen, Jordana Brewster, and Jon Stewart). That's part of the fun of going back and watching the movie now, as I point and exclaim, \\"Oh SHE was in this!\\"<br /><br />One of the other reasons it works is because the filmmakers were unabashed in their unoriginality. They didn't resort to cliches while pretending to be doing something new or different. Instead, they wholeheartedly embraced genre conventions and tropes, constantly tipping their hat to those who did it first or best. (In much the way Galaxy Quest did, though they did it even better, and with an at times tongue in cheek aspect that is absent here.)<br /><br />While on the whole the dialogue is probably the weakest part of the film, there are many lines that will make any SF geek chortle with glee, from discussions of Heinlein's The Puppet Masters to an accusation of \\"going all Sigourney Weaver\\". In the end that is what pulls it all together. This is a movie made for all of us who have grown up reading about and watching monsters and aliens, and might also have a penchant (perhaps a guilty pleasure one) for teen flicks.de for all of us who have grown up reading about and watching monsters and aliens, and might also have a penchant (perhaps a guilty pleasure one) for teen flicks.
0767817478|1.0|This was a giant monster movie that didn't want to be a giant monster movie. It wanted to be Jurassic Park soooo bad that it took an iconic monster and just changed him to an over sized raptor. Why bother calling it Godzilla? The actors were given horrible lines so I don't want to fault them, but the dialogue was painful. Also, it was just plain boring. How do you make a giant monster movie boring? Well, they managed.
0807208523|5.0|This is a life saver when teaching this unit! (I teach 3rd grade- usually most students are not at grade level)<br /><br />They follow along in the book with a bookmark & are so much more engaged than if they're reading it or I am.<br /><br />Note - I wish the story chapters/lengths were noted with the CD tracks. I'm often guessing which track number is which chapter and how long it plays. I finally took 20min with the CDs and wrote down which CD had which chapters and how long they ran.
B00B3EJ292|5.0|I watched this the first time on TV.  I looked at the TV menu to re-read the topic thinking somehow I had the wrong movie. But I hung with it.  By 30 minutes into the movie you are in love with Guido.  He draws you in with his wonderful heart, persistence, and sharp mind while playing a silly.  Wonderful acting on the part of Roberto Benigni.  Even with such a dark story, it left me with a warm feeling.  When I left the theater after seeing Schindler's List, I was sad for days.
0307476073|5.0|This memoir is a combination of travel/adventure tale with a sincere soul-searching andevor. I found it estonishing by the amazing feat of hiking the PCT alone, and by the total honest exposure of the auther's intimate feelings and experiences, both on the trail and in the past. The writing style is entertaining, with a new surprise in every turn of a page.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I felt like the little boy in the story.  It touched my heart.  It is hard to believe but it could have happened.

1781162646|5.0|All right - so the first Stephen King I ever read was [[ASIN:B0019LV31E 'Salem's Lot]]<br /><br />I picked it up after seeing an idol of mine - Benjamin Grimm of the Fantastic Four - reading it in a comic book.<br /><br />Okay - so that ought to tell you just how VERY young I was when I discovered the writing of Stephen King.<br /><br />I followed his work religiously - eagerly awaiting the publication of each new novel. Even when he began to trip up - (anyone remember [[ASIN:B002SR2Q0A Insomnia]])<br /><br />Then - when I hit [[ASIN:B000FCKNYG Cell: A Novel]] I lost my will to live.<br /><br />I remember thinking \\"How could you write such a kick-the-door-down opening chapter and then so completely lose your way?<br /><br />(I know, I know - some of you folks probably LIKED Cell. One or two of you might even have enjoyed Insomnia. What can I tell you? Reading enjoyment is HIGHLY subjective and I stand by my judgement)<br /><br />However, when I picked up Joyland my heart rose up and sung.<br /><br />First off - I've worked a little at circus, carnival and busking over the years - so ANYTHING set in this particular setting has DEFINITELY got an edge up.<br /><br />And I love coming-of-age stories - and that, more than anything else, is what JOYLAND is about.<br /><br />The mystery is secondary. The supernatural is likewise secondary.<br /><br />JOYLAND is primarily a coming of age novel.<br /><br />And on this level it succeeds.<br /><br />You want to read a book that tastes a little like the way that candied popcorn tasted like when you were a kid - you ought to pick up JOYLAND.<br /><br />I'll give it five big old stars - pinged out with the BB target rifle of your choice.<br /><br />Everybody's a winner!<br /><br />yours in storytelling,<br />Steve Vernon

B00BB22GQM|4.0|I wasn't going to purchase this CD because I thought Contra was ... ok... but this is more like their first effort in my opinion and that is a good thing.  pretty fast paced and easy to tap your foot with goes a long way.  If you enjoyed the first one or kinda like the radio song they I think you will enjoy this one.
B00005JLF5|5.0|Very nice packaged set. Entertained husband for hours!<br />Fast shipping, like new. Quality of boxed set and inserts would make excellent gift.
B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|I will be honest I have only listened to the CD 2 times fully and it took more plays for me to fully realize that his last solo effort was by far the best CD of 2010, as close to a true masterpiece as I have listened to in many years.  I am not per say a rap fan but I like Kanye but so far I do not get this one.  To me it is noise layered on noise with him rapping awfully over the top.  I think he would be sitting in jail somewhere if someone heard him mumbling on the streets of Chicago some of the stuff he says on this CD, maybe I am getting old and prudish but I listened to MBDTF recently and nope that is still a masterpiece and so far Yeezus is a piece of crap.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Good quality, like new, fast shipping. Entertains husband for hours/days when he is on a Trekkie marathon.<br />The box packaging and inserts would make this a great gift.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's hard to say in words what it is about this book it that makes you feel so many things in a shot can't-put-this-book-down span of time. Hard for me to say in words. Easy for John Green.
B006S08RLU|4.0|This was a very original movie. I enjoyed that it was all in French but had English subtitles. The characters seemed very interesting as well. Definitely a neat idea.
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|This by far the best movie I have seen on the Holocaust.  The characters are vibrant and the story is spellbinding.  To think that someone could create this kind of fantasy world amidst the horror of their situation is amazing.  What a wonderful and sad tale!  What must the real Holocaust victims have done to keep any kind of sanity?  Love this movie!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've had this book suggested to me a lot. Well, I'm trying to read a YA set in every state, and encourage ideas, and so it's not odd that this was the popular pick for Indiana. I hesitated, because I could tell it was going to be sad.<br /><br />I'm not opposed to sad stories, but I have to be in the right emotional place to read them. Still, it soon became clear that TFiOS had moved a lot of people. It has to be my Indiana.<br /><br />I should point out that I sometimes use the option on my Fire to listen to the Audible version of the book as I read. Yeah, I'm the one who does that, the only one. :) So, I have to say that the narration was terrific.<br /><br />TFiOS was an unnaturally good read. Funny, moving, thought-provoking, and strangely life-affirming. Yes, I cried, but it was worth it, because the tears were honest and earned, and not based on author manipulation -- or at least I didn't see the strings. These are likable characters, and unfair things happen to them that really happen to people every single day. People say God never gives us more than we can handle, but the jury is still out on that one. Bad things often pile on top of other bad things, for whatever reason ... or no reason at all.<br /><br />I've read some criticism that the characters act too old, but I don't think so. There are smart kids in the world, and Hazel and Augustus have more reason than most to know they have to do what they find important, be the people they want to grow up to be, right now. This is particular true of Augustus, who tried harder than most to be his best self.<br /><br />I loved the time spent with these characters, enough to cyber-stalk the author. This is my non-threatening homage to authors I like involving binging on past interviews, and what have you. Since he has a prolific vlog with his brother, this will take months. :) (And that makes me happy.)<br /><br />DFTBA -- Don't forget to be awesome.<br /><br />(If you have a suggestion for terrific YA, the middle of America is pretty wide open -- please feel free to add a comment.)of America is pretty wide open -- please feel free to add a comment.)

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app! It's really fun and very addicting...I often tell myself &quot;just one more run&quot;, and it turns into several more LOL. I don't have a single bad thing to say about it! I honestly cannot believe it was free because the graphics are amazing! I wish it didn't cost so many coins to revive and buy certain things, but I get it--the company has to make a profit somehow.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This movie my daughter and I really liked it.  She sat through the entire movie, even though she's only 3!  It has a good morale to the story.
B008P9M614|5.0|It's great to have the whole series so I can watch it from start to finish. I didn't watch it when it was a regular series, so it has helped fill in the blanks.
B00656C6KK|5.0|He wanted it so I got it for him. He enjoys it and I am glad that this purchase makes him happy.
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|It took longer than I wanted but worth the preorder and waiting.<br />Full of metal and metal!<br />I saw them live in San Bernadino and they were even better in real!<br />I hope they come tour again with longer set times.

B000002JSP|5.0|My husband loves Led Zeppelin, so.......needless to say, he was very happy that I got this for him.<br />I think it was the only one of their cd's that he didn't currently already own!!!
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|Another good Tom Cruise movie with excitement and adventure and good story  line. Not quiet as good as many other of Cruises movies but still well worth the time and expense.
B000SVZIGC|5.0|I remember this movie airing on TV a lot a few years after it came out, and having recently rewatched a lot of favorite disney movies, I decided to revisit something else from my childhood. I wasn't really expecting all that much out of it, but even as an adult, I think this is a pretty great movie. It takes its starting point from historical events, but turns into a very sweet fairy tale about family and finding yourself. Its obviously in the DIsney Princess tradition, and I enjoyed it as much as any of those films. The characters are a lot of fun, and its nice that we see Dimitri and Anya spending enough time together for a plausible romance to develop. While the villain, Rasputin, can be quite comical, there are also some genuinely scary scenes, such as when Anya almost jumps off the boat while in an enchanted dream about her forgotten family. The animation is quite beautiful, and I was specially moved by the sequence where Anya wanders through the old palace, seeing ghosts of her former life. The glitz and glamour of Paris are also well-depicted, and images such as a Chanel store and the Moulin Rouge remind us that this film is set in our own world, not too long ago. There's something about the way Anya uncovers her past, with the haunting song (Once Upon a December), the necklace and the music box, that gives the film a really beautiful magical quality. All in all, I would say that this film is a bit of a forgotten gem that I definitely recommend. Of course, there is the undeniable fact that this movie takes a troublesome time from history and gives it the fairy tale treatment, and it can definitely be perceived as trivializing the events of the Russian Revolution. In my own mind, I was able to disassociate the film from history fairly easily, and I treated it as a separate entity. If you're a person who doesn't like the idea of watching a movie that glosses over unhappy historical events and gives them the fantasy treatment, this movie probably isn't for you.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Well thought out and creative game . Highly enjoyable. Hoping it's just a sneak peak at things to come. Great design!

0345529057|1.0|I adore this TV show and it led me to want to read the books. I had previously gotten a copy of Game of Thrones from the library, but wanted to read the other books as well. I finally decided to buy this set, after all, it is a great deal for four books. Now, I am not an &#34;older&#34; person, but the print in these books is WAY too small! Not only that but it seems as though there's very little space between the words and lines. It's very hard to read, much less enjoy. Therefore, these were sent back. They should list how small the print is! I know it's a long book, but really....there's no use buying this set as it will give you an instant headache! That being said, Game of Thrones RULES!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|So much fun, hours of entertainment. Love that there is slots also. Only wish you could play offline also. Will recommend to all my friends.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Cute and simple. Seems to slow my device down. Takes a bit to load but fun to play! Will play more tonight.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It's very entertaining, I've been playing it for a while , gives me something to do without having all the adds
B0071AKB38|2.0|The speaker was cool but I was not impressed with the sound, the bass overpowered everything else and it wasn't that loud. I only used it for a few hours when it died, plugged it in and it would not recognize that it was being charged. For the price I would not recommend it.
0804165734|5.0|This was a great book. I travel a lot for work & listen to a lot of audio books, this was by far the best produced audio book I have listened to to date. It had an entire cast of narrators as opposed to just one person doing a variety of voices. As for the books content, it was top notch story writing. It read more like a history book which was a surprise. I really enjoyed this book.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun and passes the time well without frustrating you silly.  I like games like this and would enjoy playing more levels.

B0064X7FVE|3.0|This updated version is okay, but I like the other version better. I do not like the way the future forecast is set up. I do like how the map is much closer to my actual location. I also liked the now set up better. I was able to see everything at one time. I like how the map loads much quicker now too!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Very good book that takes you on a journey to find your own meaning  through<br /> thought provoking literature. No magic bullet that will instantly make you happy.
B008JFUO0Y|2.0|To me, the original was not scary. It was funny. Silly funny. This version is not scary and it isn't funny. Gone is the humor, the outrageous bloody scenes, the overacting of Bruce Campbell, and those rediculous scenes that go on for way too long but you don't mind because even though they're not really funny anymore they are somehow still funny because they're, well, have to say it but just plain silly. Gone is all the silliness of the original. What's left is an attempt at just a regular old cookie cutter horror movie. Some teenagers you really don't care about go out to a cabin that looks completely unsafe, as if it would fall down if you sneezed hard. They predictably ignore all kinds of warning signs. Anybody with the smallest bit of common sense would run away as fast as possible. Yet they stay and become victims of some kind of evil force that kills them one by one. Not hardly original. So if you take away the humor and silliness of the original, all that's left is just another predictable horror movie. Some things here and there to remind you of the original and to justify the title. Other than that, hate to say it but wasn't even worth a redbox rental for me.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Waited 2 months on a waiting list at my local library. A huge disappointment. It is sick and twisted all around. How can anyone think the end justifies the means. Am I being naive to think that wanting something, Amy and his baby, would allow justifying evil. I feel as if I wasted 415 pages. This book actually left me nauseous.
1400031001|5.0|\\"Any Human Heart\\" doesn't begin early enough in protagonist Logan Mountstuart's life to be called a bildungsroman, and it's written as an intermittent diary; it falls between genres but succeeds brilliantly.  Boyd writes with painful honesty about Mountstuart and has Mountstuart writing with a combination of painful honesty and self delusion about himself. The early scenes with our hero still at school and university have some of the feeling, albeit already a shade darker, of the first book of Anthony Powell's  \\"A Dance to the Music of Time\\"; in fact Powell and other real literary, artistic and political figures walk in and out of this fiction unexpectedly from time to time.  Mountstuart's relations and relationships with women evolve into the main theme as the book progresses, and here is where Mountstuart, not surprisingly, gets into the most complicated and even disastrous situations.  Apart from a very few editing oversights, the writing is brilliant, a pleasure to savor. The Vintage International Edition has an aptly arresting cover painting by Duncan Hannah.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|An interesting adventure into a genre I'm not familiar with.  I'll watch it again but probably only once more.  Thanks.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|This ovie was forced because this actor is who's hot right now in Hollywood. Truth is, this movie was painful to watch and the story was dumb. I couldn't really believe how dumb it was. The part about his dad being superstitious about the Eagles was wildly off and had nothing to do with the invisible story. The entire movie sucked.

B00CV5ZPA2|3.0|This is certainly not typical hip-hop! The first few tracks in my opinion are unorthodox and noisy. The next few tracks are less noisy but seems angry. I am not sure if this album was rushed but it sure sounds as if it was. Not radio ready or Grammy ready.  In his defense the more you listen the more tolerable the album becomes. It starts off violating the eardrums but later moves to something that is just \\"OK\\". Which is not something expected from an album called Yeezus.But in retropsect for those of us who are old enough, Remember Parliament/Funkadelic Dr. \\"P-Funk\\" and the Ohio Players \\"Funky Worm\\" They are sampled in several Hip-Hop songs and are considered before their time and in some cases Classics.

Breaking Bad will always keep you coming back for more. 5/5

159463176X|4.0|I didn't think this book was as good as his previous two novels, which I very much loved.  It was a bit difficult, at first, to be engaged in the story, because it felt disconnected.  But, along the way, I did get into the rythim of it.  The book was really several stories within the story, which could,have stood on their own, but which were, nevertheless, connected.  I found myself anxious to get back to it whenever I had to put the book down.  I think Mr. Hosseini is a wonderful writer.  He has the ability to draw you into a different culture and thought process than is commonly known, while at the same time be universally thought provoking.  I applaud him and look forward to reading his future best-sellers.<br />Francesca Patti Molanphy

It's always been an inspirational story when you focus on the positives as I do, and the way the team that worked on this film chose to display their own artistic attributes on this project, well it was rather interesting and genuine to say the least. It's great to see it on Blu-ray, not much difference from the DVD other than the smoother frame rates and some deeper detail. I love this film and I highly recommend anyone with spare time to see it for themselves.

B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game is super fun with detailed graphics, lots of variation, and some novel elements that really set it head and shoulders over other games of this type. But  the game is really glitchy and has enough progression-stopping bugs to drop this to 3 stars.

B00CKOQC9C|5.0|Hundreds of readers have already provided in-depth comments and critique of Ray Bradbury's THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES, so I will not endeavor to do the same. Suffice it to say that this was one of the best books I've read across the past decade. I don't know how it is that I'd never heard of it previously. Earlier this year, I read FAHRENHEIT 451 with some middle-school students whom I tutor. One developed a great interest in Ray Bradbury's work as a consequence. One of this student's cousins recommended THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES, so I ordered a few copies, expecting another high-minded literary work like 451. I have never read much science fiction, so it was an joyous surprise to find, within the first few pages, that both my student and I were immediately and wholly engaged. From start to finish, this is a real masterpiece. This particular student remains a Bradbury fan--now we are reading through a fat anthology of the author's short stories.

0061854549|4.0|Dan Ariely's Predictably Irrational is an entertaining effort to raise your awareness of how your mind works and in particular how the workings of the human mind can be used by savvy marketeers. As a group humans have habits in their thinking and in the decision-making processes which can be used to incline those humans in certain directions.<br /><br />Before going further it is important that we understand something about science. When an new study comes out stating that there is a statistically significant relationship between (for example) the colors and font sizes used in product packaging and customer buying decisions that is a highly conditional statement. First the results of a single study are not the same as established science. Findings must be replicated and a variety of alternate studies are needed to confirm or deny the relationship. Once study findings represent a consensus opinion it is understood that this relationship is not absolute in all cases for all individuals. It is understood that this relationship only describes some portion of consumer activity and that portion in some situations. Example: giant sharp edged red colored fonts may help create excitement and purchasing activity in a toy store but turn people off in the over-the-counter medicine section.<br /><br />Even where the relationship is scientifically upheld and applied in the most optimal situations it may only make a difference of a few percentage points in sales. In other words you may not think a particular study is true because of something you believe about yourself or have seen in others but that does not change the fact that the proper application of these kinds of studies produce enough changes in sales that very savvy bottom line oriented, hard-nosed business people willingly pay large amounts to isolate what may seem like marginal changes in their cash flow.<br /><br />This book may not change your attitude towards the \\"study of the day\\" nor will it necessarily change your shopping habits. Its value lies in giving you specific examples of how market research can isolate human tendencies and turn those kinds of innate preferences into actions.<br /><br />To choose a specific example from early in the book most humans have no innate ability to place an absolute value on anything. In given a choice between alternatives the typical human reaction is to engage in a set of comparisons. We do not know in any meaningful sense what a particular item or service is actually worth. Most often the word \\"worth\\" carries no meaning. We derive our sense of worth as applied to that item in terms of our past experience with similar items, how much we think we need or want that item, and how that item is portrayed. Somewhere in this is the question what can we afford but again what we can afford is related to what is that you attach to that item.<br /><br />A very specific example of this property relates to the history of black pearls. Going straight to the bottom line of this history; the first time a black pearls were placed in the marketplace they failed. They were later introduced to the marketplace surrounded by highly valuable gemstones and jewelry creating a sense that these were rare and precious jewelry items. Suddenly black pearls were valued in the marketplace and sold for a great deal of money.<br /><br />Predictably Irrational is one of a long line of books speaking to the general reader about how human decisions can be influenced by those who understand the human mind. Some of what is in this book represents new research, or at least new research as of 2008 - my edition. However some of what is in this book represents what reads like casual studies conducted by Prof. Ariely with some of his students or by some of his friends in the related fields of study. My problem with these more casual studies is that they are illustrative of some of the points being made but do not always seem to fit well with the point being made. This is a relativeweakness and forgivable because some of the things he has done are elegant in their simplicity and fun to read. Even if a particular example is not conclusive it is fun to read about how relatively easy experiments can demonstrate powerful principles. The professor manages to demonstrate a number of points with little more than a few chocolates in the campus of hungry students.<br /><br />The competition for your money is fierce. Some of the tricks used to influence your buying decisions do not cross the threshold into being unfair or dishonest. The point in this book is that if you are more aware of how your own mind works, and how that may work against you, or you can be a more aware and better prepared buyer. This is not a great conspiracy theory type book but rather an entertaining read that can help make you more conscious of your decisions.weakness and forgivable because some of the things he has done are elegant in their simplicity and fun to read.

I like the way the author worked her story and the added pleasure of British humor made me not want to stop reading. It is a love story about finding oneself and also about making life and death choices for yourself. I hate reviews that go on and on about all the characters. Read the book. It will make you laugh, cry and you won't soon forget each character.

B00BH0VSM6|3.0|This is the book that introduced Inspector Harry Hole of the Oslo Crime Squad--or it least it would have been had not several of the later Harry Hole novels reached the U.S. ahead of it. The wait is finally over, though, and The Bat is now at last available in a U.S. edition.<br /><br />It seems a bit odd that the first book in a series featuring a Norwegian police inspector would be set in Australia. Nonetheless, that's the case. A young Norwegian woman who had been something of a minor television celebrity back home, has been raped and murdered in Sydney. Harry is sent to Australia to act as a liasion with the Sydney police in the investigation. His instructions are clear: he is to be an observer and he is not to actually meddle in the investigation. The Sydney police clearly expect that Harry will spend most of his time seeing the sights and will be content to go home and report after a few days at most.<br /><br />Even if you've never read another Harry Hole novel, if you've read any crime fiction at all, you know that's never going to happen. From practically the moment he arrives in Australia, Harry develops his own ideas about the case and is anything but shy about pursuing them.<br /><br />The principal merit of this book is that the reader gets to meet a younger Harry Hole and to learn a bit more about his background. The case itself is intriguing and Harry meets a number of interesting characters along the way. If there is a problem with the book it rests with the fact that Nesbo spends quite a bit of time as a tour guide and cultural anthropologist, exploring the land, its mysteries and its peoples, and sometimes the travelogue gets in the way of the story itself.<br /><br />Actually, The Bat seems more like one of those books that you would find much later in a series, at a time when the author has begun to run out of ideas and so sends his character off to an exotic land to mix things up a bit--and, not incidentally, to give the author a great vacation that he can deduct as a business expense.<br /><br />Still, though it's not up to the standards of some of Nesbo's later Harry Hole novels, this is a fun story with a lot of unexpected twists and turns. And for those of us who are compulsive completists when it comes to our crime fiction, it gives us the chance to finally start reading this series in order. The problem remaining is that the second book in the series, The Cockroaches will not be released in the U.S. until December. At that point, all of the Harry Hole novels will finally be available here and all will be right with the world.that he can deduct as a business expense.<br /><br />Still, though it's not up to the standards of some of Nesbo's later Harry Hole novels, this is a fun story with a lot of unexpected twists and turns.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved the old Weather Channel app.  However, I really dislike the update.  Why did you have to mess with a good thing?  I find the graphics very distracting and cheesy looking.  It's hard to figure out how to see the 10 day forecast.  Frankly, I use this version a lot less than the old one, and I will probably delete it.

1590171993|5.0|Against everything I would wish I've become almost strictly non-fiction. I've lost count of the number of novels I've started and then abandoned. A row of books with page corners turned down half way through chapter two.<br /><br />Then along comes Stoner. Someone said that not much happens in this book: a LIFE happens, a real, believable, quietly heroic human life. And the writing is exquisite. I’m a fairly slow reader but I sped through this, which meant it was over all too soon.<br /><br />If you want guns and cars and action, this might not be the book for you. But if you want to meet a stranger, get to know him and care about his life to the extent that you are saddened when you reach the last page and there is no more to learn, then this is almost certainly for you. Most of all, if you just want to be held by wonderful and deceptively straightforward writing, then I bet you’ll love every page of Stoner.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Wow!  This tiny device about the size of an Ipod shuffle has some boost.  It made my Sansa Clip sound even better, and the sound presets provide a nice deep &#34;surge&#34; of power if you will.  I can only imagine what the bigger amps from FiiO provide.  HIGHLY recommended.
B00CMQX84A|2.0|Just finished watching this and it was painful.  This was not Disney's usual quality.  It was the worst lip sync I've ever seen.  The cutest parts of the movie they showed on the previews.  And I know Disney has enough budget to re-shoot a scene once water gets on the camera.  It's like they rushed through production - the movie doesn't flow.  And don't get me started on the second-class special effects and computer animation.  The movie was dedicated to Annette Funicello, but the movie seemed to just poke fun.

1250025362|2.0|Left out too many people at end.  The relationships  were not resolved, some were very neglected.  It wasn't very well put together.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love it great for kids or adults or well any one just like the movie ive herd so I'm so excised to see the movie beacause this app is the best
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I just watched this on the Disney Channel! I just loved it. I loved all the surfing, retro like dancing, and vintage fashions. The musical number was awesome. This is way better than High School Musical. Disney just has to put Ross Lynch in another movie.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|why have guide and not the real game?? so bass backwards!! I work in customer service for a nationwide company and we have an app that I help people with everyday.. if we get so many requests for one thing...  IT Gets Done!!! PLEASE ADD CANDY CRUSH SAGA!! DAMN...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Arguably the most fun of any of the running games. The download is fairly big so it takes a bit of time to install but well worth the wait.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Some writers just have a type of imagination that knows no bounds. This story could be considered far fetched until you read each individuals accounts and you start forgetting about what the monster is and just think about how to get away from it. I kept trying to think up ways they could end this problem like they were going to call and ask. Then I got to the last few interviews and wondered could we really be able to go through such drastic measures to end this problem. This is a good book.
0425263916|4.0|This sequel to Bared to You was still pretty good but it got a little dark for my taste.  Looking forward to the closing book.
B000002KE2|5.0|What's not to love about this album?!?!?! It's BLACK SABBATH!!!<br />The original line up, great songs, heavy riffs, this album ROCKS!<br />A must have for any true sabbath fan!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Grey game. This may take over for bejeweled.<br />Thanks for the suggestion. If the jewels moved back faster after an incorrect choice, it may make me happier.
B006M7JCC2|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It opened my eyes to identifying my true self. However, I will continue to hold my own spiritual beliefs about Jehovah God and Jesus which also satisfies my soul to the core.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|its really fun but i cant pass the second one cause the water wont work so i cant get the key to unlock the cupboard. very disappointed. can someone fix this or tell me how to pass
B0039TAHMA|5.0|All around this is a really great movie! Great CGI, acting, and action. I've never read the book but have been meaning too. With that in mind, as a stand alone movie it is awesome but I have no idea how it compares to the storyline of the book.
1451627297|2.0|This book had potential, and there were certainly some great segments. However, this is Specimen A of Stephen King needing a good editor. The middle of the book dragged on and provided very little to the substance of the story. This could have been a decent 300-page book or a great short-story. Instead, it was a bloated behemoth of a book with a center that could have been completely avoided. King has said that he no longer feels the pressure to write anything but exactly what he wants. I hope this isn't what he meant.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|This is a verry good app but could use some more.the first on is grate with plinty of guns.over all a verry good app for its price and compared to other rip offs
0307476073|5.0|We read this book for book club and I couldn't put it down. Cheryl Strayed is a fantastic writer. This book made me want to hike the PCT so badly and I don't even hike!
B004AP9W46|5.0|This is a pretty good book and I rather enjoyed it.  This is one of those books where I think you either love it or hate it - there's not much in between.  I'm one of those who loved it.  Even if you've not read the other books, you can still read this one.  There might be some parts that the reader might not \\"get\\" if he/she hasn't read the other books, but you can still get the gist of it and really, the book is more about God and the Devil than anything else.  Well, and Lestat, of course, who narrates the story.  I thought his interaction with Memnoch was well written and interesting - I found myself wanting their actual conversations with one another to go on longer.  The only complaint I have is with the character of Dora; she could have been a stronger character, or maybe even left out of the story altogether and some other device used to bring that aspect of the book into the story.  I just never \\"connected\\" with her character.<br /><br />Overall, an interesting and thought-provoking read and I recommend it whether you are a Vampire Chronicles fan or not.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is great and it is way way way way beter than temple run and temple run two this game is awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008QE9XD2|4.0|I have never been a fan one way or the other of Dark Shadows, airing as it did between my ages of 3-8, and thus having no interest in afternoon tv of any kind at that age. I am a fan of Tim Burton, however, even as I'm aware of his hits and misses, which made me curious to see his version of Dark Shadows. I've seen it on the big screen and now a handful of times on HBO, a testament to the fact that I find it worth repeated viewings.<br /><br />This movie bears little resemblance to the program - the words of the many dissenting opinions - putting it squarely in line with the majority of movie versions of old tv programs. It's a safe plan that shuns creativity for easy manipulation of a particular fan base.  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are reportedly a part of that reverent fan base, but that doesn't stop Burton from employing his deft macabre touch and penchant for overblown conclusions to tell a satirical tale of an cursed man (Barnabas Collins) who comes back to 1972 New England to restore the family name and settle an old score with the witch who cursed him (played deliciously by the lovely Eva Green).<br /><br />The jokes are mostly of the fish out of water variety, Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and the aforementioned Green clearly relish their campy roles, the movie has silly sub-plots and could be trimmed by a good fifteen minutes, and the ending is a typically epic Burton confrontation, yet in spite of all that, this movie was very enjoyable for me. There are some truly funny moments and Depp's campilicious performance keeps the silliness rolling along. I've been critical of Depp turning into a cartoon with his roles, but for some reason, his turn here works for me. No accounting for taste, aye?<br /><br />Dark Shadows is played for laughs and irony, and it worked for me.  It reminds me of The Brady Bunch movies, and those too are funny yet irreverent to the source material. If you approach this movie without expectations and prejudice, you might enjoy the ride as much as I do. If you go into it expecting a loving recreation of a beloved tv show, you'll most likely be very disappointed.<br /><br />3.5 - 4 starsas much as I do.

B000AYQJ3I|5.0|I used to listen to the vinyl sound recording of this on my turntable in the 1980s.  (It first came out in 1971.) It's incredibly satisfying to put visual images with the audio that I remember.  (&#34;We've forgotten Billy Preston!&#34;)  Also, Eric Clapton.....  He gets the loudest applause when the performers on stage are being introduced, but as he looks at George Harrison during the applause, he communicates a sort of fear that he won't measure up.  (He was going through heroin withdrawal.)  As they play &#34;As My Guitar Gently Weeps,&#34; Harrison starts to back him up with a counter-solo, and the look in Clapton's eyes is both grateful and abashed.<br />Contrast this to the &#34;Concert for George&#34; in 1992 when Eric Clapton masterfully played the same song in honor of his dead friend, as well as being musical director for the whole concert.  Both strong and wonderful men, who evolved for the better over the years.<br />Never thought I could SEE this as well as hear it
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|The movie was pretty good and the special effects were amazing. I gave it 5 stars because it was a great story and my kids enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed the Wizard of OZ!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The app was good before, clean and easy to navigate.  I hate the redesigned app. Too busy Too many distracting ads. And, as a previous reviewer noted, it now drains the battery. Un installing today.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is a great way to see the weather at a glance without having to go through the web.  I especially like the notifications (Kindle Fire HD) so when I wake up, I can see if there will be any aberrant conditions. Very good free app.

B005LAIIJY|5.0|I showed you how slavery played a part in history.  Jamie Fox was excellent in the movie he had guts and was not afraid to go after his wife. Loved the movie the end was great.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|I vacillated quite a bit on rating this book and finally decided that while the series itself is still a solid 5, I can't give this book any higher than a 3 star rating. I don't necessarily need a lot of action, I just need characters that I care about and decent writing. I've come to love these characters and the world that the author has created. I prefer books with depth who aren't afraid of spending those extra pages on character development or a good side story. Despite all this, I found myself so bored with this book, I actually starting skipping over pages. For example, I just couldn't get myself to care very much about the Adem and the endless chapters detailing the way they communicate and fight. I found it very tedious and indicative of an author who thinks very highly of every word he puts on paper and has no one reining him in. Editors are our friends! Or maybe that was the problem, is his editor a friend? Perhaps the long boring chapters detailing again Kvothe's cleverness was a deliberate commentary on the possibly unreliable narrator/main character but I think I'm being generous to say this.<br /><br />All the criticisms pointing to lack of action and plot movement are completely valid. Much of the book was the same enjoyable characters and mysteries of the first book. But don't pick this up expecting much in the way of plot development.<br /><br />I even got quite bored in the Fae world. I personally would have preferred a dozen chapters detailing the 1000 Hands technique over the endless pages of... whatever they did. I can't even remember. The exception being the Cthaeh which was brilliant and exciting and actually managed to advance the plot (!!) for the first time in what felt like forever. It was like an ice cold beer in the middle of a desert of boredom.<br /><br />Now that I've got that out of my system, I would still wholeheartedly recommend this series to anyone. It's a fun ride with great characters and plenty of little mysteries to keep mecoming back for more. I even delved into the online fan forums to find the fascinating theories about side characters like Meluan, Bredon and Lorren. (If you don't know what I'm talking about, look them up!) Seeing things that I missed the first time around convinces me that this series will ultimately live up to its praises and despite my less than flattering review, I truly am looking forward to the next book!
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|I loved this movie. I would recommend this movie to every one. It was a real  real good movie . I loved it.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|Weather channel has always been my go to for all things weather related, but the app on my kindle auto updated to this new version and it is just! Not intuitive, the screens are cluttered and hard to interpret and difficult to find what I want. On top of that the map feature is now exceptionally slow and when zooming out it usually doesn't load any more of the map, just make the section I was looking at smaller.  I am searching for a new app right now.

B0009P42S2|5.0|Having adored Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira, and being that I am currently exploring the realms of Steampunk fiction, I'm glad I finally had a chance to see this film.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0009P42S2 Steamboy: Director's Cut]] is set in a unique offshoot of that science fiction-slash-fantasy genre-mashup known as Steampunk, which features late-eighteenth-to-early-nineteenth century industrial age mechanics, powered by steam-based systems in some alternate universe where steam has been made as potent as dynamite, and engineers have proven capable of building anything, no matter how impossibly large or complex.  It's an odd mix of the Industrial Revolution and Victorian morals and ideals with impossibly complex mechanical technology and a complete disdain for the natural limitations of matter, a romantic before-physics-and-fossil-fuels-ruined-everything kind of notion.  And right now, there seems to be one of those technological backlashes going on in the entertainment industry, resulting in a lot of magic, fantasy, and, well, this.  Whatcha gonna do?  You put on your aviator's jacket and goggles, wind up your pocket watch and go with it!<br /><br />A PG-rated story--mainly for violence, which is mostly comic-book harmless but does show a bit of blood--Steamboy is a boy's adventure romp from beginning to end, with plenty of chase scenes, on-the-fly inventions and cool gadgets to help Ray out of each jam.  Steamboy uses a mixture of traditional and computer animation to take full advantage of the Steampunk genre.  The colossal engines, Victorian-era zeppelins, cobbled-together garage inventions and hybrid machine-bastards are the eye-candy of Steampunk, and nowhere have have I seen them better presented than in this production.  Every frame is gorgeous: The backgrounds, machines and action are so beautifully rendered as to elicit oooohs and ahhhhs from those anime fans out there.  I do find myself wishing animators would put as much work into the character's faces as they did their incredible machines and backgrounds... they all tend to be the very basic of caricatures, as is unfortunately typical of anime.  This complaint aside, it's hard not to love the look of this production.<br /><br />In many ways, the movie reminds you of Akira, with its massive scales, world-shattering technologies and themes that make individuals seem as insignificant as ants.  And the ending of Steamboy is Akira-like in its constant escalation of technology-gone-wrong that impacts the very atmosphere around the juggernaut  known as the Steam Castle, and threatens to destroy Manchester, the historic Crystal Palace (early symbol of the Industrial Era that inspires Steampunk), the Queen and, ultimately, the very British Empire.<br /><br />Like Akira, the ending just seems to keep going beyond the point where a more practical director would have said, \\"Okay, enough already.\\"  Still, if you can forgive the animators' over-zealous efforts at the end, you'll find yourself exultant at how much fun Steampunk can be, in the right hands--the hands of the Japanese, apparently.heir incredible machines and backgrounds... they all tend to be the very basic of caricatures, as is unfortunately typical of anime.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Freaking awesome, fun for all ages, my daughter well love it, I know I do. written well. No glitches so far
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|What a wonderful book!  Courtney Milan is now one of my favorite authors.  I liked it because there's more to it than just the usual \\"will they or won't the get together\\" that we expect from all romance novels. \\"The Duchess War\\" also deals with some difficult moral questions. Would you throw someone under the bus (metaphorically) to save another person?  What if the person you sacrifice has done nothing wrong? What if the person you must sacrifice is the person you love?  Would you sacrifice someone else to save yourself?  The lead characters, Minnie and Robert, are both flawed individuals who must face some very difficult decisions.  They both have traumas in their past that affect their behavior today.  Learning to forgive - and love -  as well as accept forgiveness - and love - are themes  in this book.  Wanting to be seen and loved for the person you truly are instead of being judged for your wealth (or lack of) or your good looks (or lack of) or your family history is also a theme that runs through this book.  But it is a romance, so rest assured that there will be a happy ending.<br /><br />There are a few very \\"steamy\\" scenes but they are tastefully written and serve to illuminate the characters of Minnie and Robert.<br /><br />The side characters are also interesting. I look forward to reading their stories in the rest of the series.  I downloaded \\"The Heiress Effect\\". As soon as I finished The Duchess War\\".<br /><br />\\"The Duchess War\\" is part of \\"the Brothers Sinister\\" series.  There's a prequel novella, \\"\\"The Governess Affair\\", available as a free download.  You don't have to read it first, but I recommend it.  You'll have a better understanding of the relationship between the two brothers.  It's excellent and it's free, so go for it!
B0006J28L4|5.0|Shipping was very fast. The DVD was as described. One movie, two discs. A must watch movie because it shows the struggles and sacrifices Malcolm X went through to try to promote pride, power and equality within the black race.  However, his efforts were thwarted by his own. Very empowering movie!
B00DIFARQ6|5.0|I love this app so much I am only on the second mission and I already love it wow just wow

Excellent vendor, item exactly as described.
0071762345|2.0|The main message in this book is to offer reasons for people to visit your site - eg. useful advice, coupons offering more than 5% off. The secondary message is to respond immediately to adverse comments made by others and don't delete them (adds credibility, dissuades the unhappy from starting a new site). Some of the examples provided clear instances where social media added customer flow; however, I have trouble envisioning its usefulness for large corporations and the author provided no data whatsoever on that topic. And as for picking eg. a dentist based on the experiences of my friends - no thanks! I prefer going to more informed/credible sites such as BBB or peer ratings by professionals. As for eg. Angie's List, it's under a cloud and costs money ($29/year for consumers, with no opportunity to preview the service) to boot - the former for reports of businesses paying telemarketers to call customers and encourage good reviews. A contractor complained that in order to be highly rated he had to pay Angie thousands/year for position, as well as accumulate time to accumulate favorable reviews.

B00AK3D5BI|1.0|I ordered this book based on the fact that it was the book published by Usborne books.  I am creating a library of Usborne books.  My rating is not a reflection of the actual book itself but the fact that it was not the book I ordered.  I am not pleased at all and hope that the other 2 &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; from Usborne books are indeed from Usborne.  I specifically seared using Usborne in my search so I can only receive books from Usborne publishing.  I also hope all the other 30 books I ordered through Amazon are Usborne books. Shipping and returning it is too expensive for me that must keep this one.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|a friend told me of the show.  I have watched season 1&2, and am now viewing season 3. I love the era, the costumes, the actors are great; you forget they are actors, you feel like your a fly on the wall watching their lives.  I am truly enjoying this show. oh yes, I love the fact that there isn't vulgarity, or sex.  so nice to see good acting without all that extra stuff.

I got it because it was the game of the day. if you like stratagy games that are hard and almost imposiple to win evennl on beginners than this  is the app for you.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Amazing movie!  Denzel has never disappointed and he shines again in this movie.  Great ( a little disturbing haha) storyline.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I don't know how to describe this game other than &quot;beautifully inventive&quot;. It's great, and well worth the money. The creators have done a great job integrating humor and meaning into this well thought out piece of art (I call this art because it's true). You will not find a more artistically enclined gaming app like this. It's fun, creative, and one of my favorites.<br /><br />The object of this game is to drag goo balls to build a structure or two in order to get to the pipe which will sick the goo balls up. It has a story, but is mord focused on the gameplay.<br /><br />The gameplay is simple and you will get the hang of it in no time. It is challenging at times, but not so challenging that you will pull your hair out in frustration. I found that sometimes when I tried to pick up a certain goo ball, it wouldn't register correctly and pick up a different one. You can avoid this by zooming into the screen to make the goo balls appear larger.<br /><br />The graphics are outstanding. It has sort of a Tim Burton style which I find very appealing. At one point the game will be very colorful and the next it would be dark and backlit. This, along with the breathtaking music in the background, sets the mood for every level.<br /><br />Get this game. It is great, well worth $5. Though this game is short, you will enjoy every minute of it. I hope they make a sequel with more levels, but for now it is great; a little masterpiece.
0316212377|5.0|The Hydrogen Sonata is about the near Sublimation of the Gzilt, a civilisation at the same technological level than the Culture. For those that read mostly mainstream novels, this would be like a story about passing away from the material world and inheritance, although at the level of galactic civilizations. The Hydrogen Sonata is a clear return to form by science-fiction writer Iain M banks. It displays a rather mature shaping of the plot, the structure, and its characters. It is never easy (at least for me) to summarize in a few paragraphs the more than hundred thousands words typically delivered in each of his books, moreover because the content is challenging, complex, split, multi-layered, resonant, with a long-term remarkable interpretative added value, that a written, fixed, public review may only interfere with, unless the review remains vague and flexible enough to allow for new impressions.<br />The story is very astounding, even more than that of Surface detail, and it shows unequivocally that Iain M Banks is a great storyteller.<br />Whereas his first SF novels are \\"realistic\\" and action-driven (\\"travelling with the body though physical landscapes\\"), the latter novels are more caricaturesque and thought-driven (\\"travelling with the mind through galleries of ideas\\"). The first SF novel, Consider Phlebas, and The Hydrogen Sonata might thus constitute such antipodes, noting also that whereas in the first novel everything seems to spiral out, at least for the main protagonist, in the last novel everything seems to spiral in. In The Hydrogen Sonata, the events are assessed successively by- or reverberated across a chain of actors/observers, producing some redundancy, but it is not critical. Team work is well depicted. The wrong doings of the few Gzilt baddies appear incredible for a civilization that advanced, though one might hypothesize this is because the Gzilt do not surrender their governing or evolution to artificial intelligence like in the Culture. After Matter and Surface Detail, this is the third consecutive Culture novel with a female main protagonist reaching Contact due to special circumstances (though very different circumstances indeed). The novel offers a lot to reflect upon (on the one side, casual social engineering - not so like in Dune from Frank Herbert, exceptionalism, militarism, and over-conceptualized art, and on the other side, futuristic technology, embodiment, longevity, the beginnings of the Culture, and so on) and is a great read.
B004P7CNE0|1.0|As noted, this film borrows from Dark City, Blade Runner, Terminator, The Matrix, Fahrenheit 451, and Total Recall, but this movie falls far short of those greats. There is a difference between employing genre, plot, character, theme, and other such elements from past movies and rolling them in to a creative, inspired, and unique film experience, compared to such films as this which represent nothing more than simply stealing from the successful and not even attempting to cover your tracks.<br /><br />Christian Bale looks great in this film, but his beyond-Neo super-human antics have no basis for believability, whereas the Matrix properly set the plausibility stage for how one man could kill dozens. We saw the same implausible kind of ripoff with the Selina character in 'Dark Knight Rises' who performs Trinity-like moves with the same lack of foundation. They're hoping we won't notice, or care.<br /><br />Equilibrium is also full of the kind of plot twists and unexpected character behavior audiences tend to go for.... except, again, absolutely no set up for the twists, so it gets less and less easy to suspend your disbelief, while at the same time easier and easier to predict what's coming next as the movie drags on. By the end of the film you are fed up with the nonsensical sequences, you realize there's not a fresh piece of meat to be found in this turkey, and you start to regret the time you've invested. Save yourself the trouble and instead catch one of the aforementioned films you haven't seen yet! :>

B00D8OHPF8|5.0|Now this is what an R&B album should sound like! I heard how Joe's new CD, Doubleback-Evolution of R&B, was getting rave reviews from fans and critics alike. So being on the great musical purchase run I've been on and hearing the first single of the album, I'd Rather Have A Love, I went out & picked it up. Man! This has a feel of what could be a timeless classic. Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but I was more than impressed by the work put together here.<br /><br />The feel of this album seems so rooted in old school R&B in not just the sound but how his songwriting is more along the lines of put all that you can into loving just one woman the right way. Not just physically, but with all your heart and soul. Doing all you can in all aspects to satisfy the one you love. Can be argued that today's generation of artists have gotten away from that a bit in their songs. Perhaps that inspired the title, doubling back to what great R&B used to be. And the music had a great range from using symbols, triangles and xylophones to give those soft tinkling sounds on the softer & slower songs to mellow funk with a couple having finger snapping involved like it's on-the-corner harmony. Just a great use of instruments to add to the element that gives off just a crisp, polished sound.<br /><br />Listen to those horns blow to kick start the album in Something For You and puts you on the road to a smooth ride with this CD. As Joe says in the chorus, Got a lil' something for you to put you in the mood, just lay back and relax. That line can pretty much sum up this album which you can use for a night with your lady for a little one-on-one. I really like Easy as well, talking of how love can be hard at times but not on this night as just so into you so much that you make it easy. Some good tracks follow but the album really picks up with the stretch of tracks starting at six all the way through 11. I'd Rather Have A Love is a song a lot of men could take heed to. Instead of trying tobe 'the man' and running through a bunch of females, just be A man and love one special woman and do whatever you have to in making her happy. Building a love and life that can last and not ending up alone by life's end. Line that sticks out from that song, \\"Mama told me what a real man should be/She said, Son pick one and treat her like me!\\" Nail on the head. Love & Sex is an awesome duet with Fantasia! This song almost instantly brought to mind groups like The Dramatics, the Stylistics, the Manhattans, the Intruders. Just the sound and how the instruments in the bridge match darn near the pronunciation of each word. Song points out the difference between the two but how you can bring them together to have that special magic with 'that one.' Follow those up with Sexy, More and Mary Jane which could be Joe's equivalent to JT's Pusher Love Girl in how he compares his lady to 'Mary Jane' in getting high off her love to help he ease off from stress. Bass guitar helps this song just ride so mellow! Then he picks it up and haves a little fun with 1 To 1 Ratio featuring Too $hort, showing you can have fun going home with just one that you love. Can make a club night back at the crib with yo lady. Throw that stretch of songs on and seems like it can make for a fun night, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />This is the true essence of R&B. The sound, the songwriting, the vocals and harmony. Joe says in the song Doubleback, love has a lost connection with all of us heading in the wrong direction. Same can said be said for today's music. Perhaps, the two are kind of tied together and that's why the music is oversexualized. With CDs like this, perhaps this thing can turn around. Getting back to what makes music great. Not just sex, but all that goes into love. This is one of those albums that people shouldn't miss the boat on. It is worth every cent you put down on it. Way to go, Joe! Go ahead and mellow out with Joe Smooth.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|It has many more things than the original Temple Run. It now has ziplines, rolling balls with spikes, and much, much more. Also, it's free so if for some reason you don't like it, you can just delete it.

B007SGM084|5.0|I started reading this trilogy based on my wife's review. These books are not only for women and were difficult on most days to stop reading. I would recommend these books to everyone; they're erotic, funny, heart wrenching, and the story keeps climbing and never slows down.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|I am not yet accomplished with using it.  Started out at a 2 but am a 4 now and planning on 5 by the end of the month.  I am 78.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I really liked it. I had seen the movie, with Tom Cruise, and told a friend about the movie and he chided me stating that Tom Cruise was NOT Jack Reacher and I should read the book. I did, and he was right. Tom Cruise is 5' 7&#34;. Jack Reacher, is 6' 5&#34;. But my friend did watch the movie and he liked it because Cruise does play a Reacher type character. So the book is good and another thing I like about it, I bought the Kindle version for my Fire, was that it had an intro by the author explaining how he came to be a writer and how he came to write the Jack Reacher series. I really liked that because I like to write and I'm always curious what other writers are thinking when they pen characters.

B005DKLPQ0|3.0|First, the Pro's:<br />This box set comes packaged very nicely.  The CD sleeves are vinyl album replicas.  Personally, I didn't own all 8 albums, so it rounds out my Smiths collection nicely.  More or less, the remastering is acceptable (more on that later).  The price at $66 makes it definitely worth it.<br /><br />Next, the Con's:<br />CD sleeves are \\"tiny\\" album replicas.  Meaning, you can't actually read any lyrics on them.  The included booklet *should* have included a legible lyric sheet.  Granted, you can find lyrics on the Internet, but this is a glaring omission in the release.<br /><br />The Comparison:<br />Setup: 1985 Sire CD release of \\"Meat Is Murder\\", played on a Rega Apollo CD player, w/ AudioQuest Evergreen interconnects.<br />This \\"Complete\\" CD collection, ripped to FLAC, played via the Decibel application on an iMac, through a Rega DAC, w/ AudioQuest Forest USB cable and Sidewinder interconnects.<br />Lastly, a Rega Mira3 integrated amp and Paradigm Studio 20 v.4 speakers<br /><br />This system is mid-high end, pushing $5000.  It definitely gives whatever source you throw at it the very best opportunity to shine.<br /><br />I synchronized playback between the two sources, and switched back and forth w/ a remote.  In general, very little noticeable difference on most tracks.  Morrissey's vocals have been cleaned very slightly, and the bass has been boosted somewhat.  However, I actually preferred the CD on most tracks.  The original vocal track typically had a slight reverb which added to the ethereal quality of Morrissey's voice.  I'm not sure what processing was used, but the level is higher and the lilting mystery is gone.  One of my favorite tracks \\"What She Said\\" is absolutely atrocious on the \\"Complete\\" remaster, sounding like they are playing into a tin can, compared to the original.  Album tracks such as \\"Nowhere Fast\\" and \\"Well I Wonder\\" are nearly identical.  The major difference is w/ \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" which has received quite a bit ofattention.  This was the only track that the remaster was notably superior to the original, having had a nice dynamic range boost, w/o being overly bass-heavy.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: MOST PEOPLE W/ TYPICAL CONSUMER ELECTRONICS WILL HEAR LITTLE TO NO IMPROVEMENT OVER ORIGINAL RELEASES, ESPECIALLY IF YOU RIP IT TO MP3, BUT IT'S NOT WORSE.  PLUS, IT'S A GREAT VALUE TO ROUND OUT YOUR COLLECTION.<br /><br />If you want to hear a sublime example of remastering, the Led Zeppelin \\"Mothership\\" 4-album vinyl release is absolutely incredible, even compared to 90s CD reissues.
193700788X|1.0|******************CONTAINS SPOILERS******************<br /><br />To me, the books started going downhill after #8 but to end the series this way is disgusting and a rip off to fans!  I used to love reading these books.  I bought every novel and read all of the short stories.  Never again!  This book had a lot of problems other than having a weak plot:<br /><br />1) GROSS: Every Louisiana woman of child bearing age is pregnant or breastfeeding (except Sookie, who at age 29 or so is so desperate to breed that she will date anybody who asks)!<br /><br />2) TOMATO OVERDOSE: There are dozens of mentions of tomatoes growing in Sookie's yard or being eaten.<br /><br />3) RIDICULOUS PREMISE: Every remaining villain (at least 6 characters) in the entire series shows up simultaneously to kill Sookie. The only reason is that each one now gets killed off so that nobody will ever bother Sookie again... except Felipe De Castro!  (Somehow CH forgot to have him killed in this story.)  These characters had no real reason to harm Sookie in the first place.  For example, Claude (a gay fairy) wants her dead because she wouldn't have sex with him earlier.<br /><br />4) RIDICULOUS PREMISE: Copely Carmichael sells Tyrese's soul to the devil to get 1 wish, which he uses to ask for the cluviel d'or which would grant him 1 wish.<br /><br />5) CHARACTER ASSASSINATION: Everything Eric says/does is completely out of character.  Suddenly he is 100% evil.  Why spend years building up a relationship only to destroy it? The reason is that vampire books sell and CH grabbed the cash despite her personal distaste  for vampires.  Notice how the books stopped being called \\"Southern Vampire Mysteries\\" and started being called \\"Sookie Stackhouse Novels\\" a couple of years ago?<br /><br />6) RIDICULOUS BEHAVIOUR: Sookie doesn't mind her break up at all.  No grieving.  She starts ranting that real life should be like  a romance novel, where the hero promptly leaves and is never heard from again.  This doesn't sound like any romance story I've ever heard of!<br /><br />7) GROSS: I have always considered Sam to be in the friend zone.  He is a always described as being small with messy hair.  He has always dated the female villains.  Imagine the smell when he turns into a dog.  He cannot raise $30k despite owning several rental properties.  He chooses to live in a trailer despite owning several rental properties.<br /><br />8) PLOT HOLE: Sam could have gotten the bail money from Bill who always seems to have money to give to the Bellefleurs, enough to renovate a mansion.<br /><br />9) OUT OF CHARACTER: For the first half of the book, Sookie is out of character, being mean spirited and swearing like crazy.  It doesn't even feel like CH wrote this part.  Not to mention that this simple barmaid is using tonnes of big words like omniscient, etc.<br /><br />10) THIRD PERSON NONSENSE: Maybe CH thought she was building up a mystery by not identifying some of the villains for the first third of the book.  They are only described as \\"the tall man\\" and \\"the medium man\\".  This did not work.<br /><br />11) UNREALISTIC AND GROSS: There is no build up to a relationship with Sam.  Supposedly they've always wanted each other (retcon), so the day after she breaks up with Eric, Sookie is having slimy seal sex with Sam, peeling off his holey, ancient cutoffs, seeing his red chest hair, wanting his d**k.. \\"the best sex ever\\".  Oh ya, I am totally convinced.  Sounds like it was written by a 14 year old boy.  Plus being a dog, Sam keeps resting his forehead or mouth on Sookie and<br />asking for more sex later.  {{{Shudder}}} I was cringing and groaning in disgust when the audiobook played in my car on the way home from work.<br /><br />12) BIBLE THUMPING: Sookie now expresses her pro-Christian views a lot (anti-soulless-vampire sentiment), enough to be a member of the Fellowship.  These books used to be based on tolerance!<br /><br />13) ESSENTIAL SPARK WASTED: By the end of the book Sookie is back to square one.  So many characters died along the way because of her talent and her association with supernatural beings, all for nothing.  No more travel or adventure.  No hope of education.  Just keep working in Merlotte's and start having seal puppies.  ICK!<br /><br />Now I would like to discuss CH's bizarre behaviour since releasing the book!<br /><br />1) SPOILERGATE: A few days before the North American release date of DEA, a<br />store in Germany was selling the book, so fans on the internet got talking about the  plot.  CH begged readers to not discuss the book until May 7 because she<br />wanted to grab the pre-order cash.  She blamed the fans for publicly discussing their disappointment instead of the German store for selling the book early.  I was glad to read the spoilers. I cancelled my pre-order and reserved the book from the library.  CH has no right to censor me!<br /><br />2) ALLEGED DEATH THREATS: In many interviews, CH tries to get pity by mentioning being threatened by crazy fans.  Look on amazon to see that 45% of readers gave DEA a 1 or 2 star rating.  For her to lump all of us in with the crazies is not fair.<br /><br />3) ENTITLED READERS: How dare we have an opinion?  Here is a recent interview quote from CH where you can see how much she hates the fans and wants our money at the same time:<br /><br />\\"I hear from a lot of people who, I don't know why they think I'd be interested in hearing their thoughts, say, \\"Oh well she's going to be sorry when she doesn't get that big pay check, I bet she'll write another.\\" I like to think I have some integrity. If I was just doing it for the money, I would keep doing it. I'm not saying I don't enjoy making that much money. I do. Golly, who wouldn't?\\"<br /><br />4) BLAMING ASKARS: In another recent interview, CH blamed ASKARS for making fans love Eric.  I guess she forgot that she wrote many sweet scenes in the books which did not appear on television, which showed that Eric loved Sookie and that they were a good match.  Then she blamed this remark on her shoes which were hurting her feet.  She can't stop sticking those feet in her mouth!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is the best game ever I love it I am so addicted to this game like I play it every minute good on kindle fire no problems at all just love it so much
B00D2ZF24O|4.0|After Earth is a pretty decent movie if you don't go into it expecting non-stop action and over-the-top special effects.  The heart of the movie is not the typical modern sci-fi \\"blow them away with action and effects and hope they'll forget about the acting\\".  The background story (IMO) was pretty decent though somewhat perfunctory which is actually just fine (read the review title again).  I'll admit the plot even felt a bit contrived in some spots, but overall the story held up fairly well.  But the movie was really about the building of a relationship between a mostly absent father and the son desperately (and ultimately, successfully) trying to measure up to what he supposes to be his father's expectations, and exorcising his own internal demons in the process.<br />I wouldn't give the director too much credit for what I believe is a good movie, though.  I suspect that, with a huge star like Smith involved, and particularly after his last film, M. Knight Shyamalan likely had much less creative input into \\"After Earth\\".  I can (eventually) forgive M. Knight for brutally butchering \\"The Last Airbender\\", but (unfortunately) I don't think I'll ever be able to forget it.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Our whole family loves this show.  It is the best show on TV. It has a great blend of action, adventure and great storytelling
B00DGN51O8|3.0|I do wish we could give half star ratings.  This one's not quite a three star movie, which on my scale means definitely worth renting, and possibly worth buying.<br /><br />It is a fun movie, and I did not regret renting it, but I do not consider it strong enough to warrant a purchase.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of fun even my grandson enjoyed watching . What a fun puzzle game. Love games that make you think. Hope there are more levels coming out.
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|I really liked the first Expendables.  I found it somewhat original within the action genre, bringing together so many action icons.  I would even consider Bruce and Arnold's on-screen moment the action movie equivalent of Pacino's and De Niro's tête-à-tête from &#34;Heat&#34;.  It was a very entertaining movie deserving of a solid three stars, so I had high hopes for the sequel.<br /><br />Sadly, Sly and the Gang did not deliver.  The story was disappointing, and the action was over the top ridiculous.  I'd consider this one a pass, even as a rental.  (Even on Netflix, you really need to be bored to find any entertainment value in this movie.)
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Peter Falk in an iconic role.  Great storytelling, great acting, and the quality holds up over the 40 or so years these movies were made.  Good thing the movies are so good because the extras are not really worth mentioning.

I think if you could use Bananas (the easy earned trade items) there wouldn't be such a problem. I hope gameloft takes this review into consideration.

B0067EKY7M|5.0|It's a wonderful movie that teaches the power of belief and tolerance... something our world is sorely lacking in right now. Just the premise posed in the title is enough to say: \\"What the heck are you THINKING?!?\\"<br /><br />Having been in that part of the world, the problems posed are formidable to make this a reality. However, it shows the spirit of people who refuse to accept \\"It can't be done\\" as the final say on the matter. It was a highly entertaining movie on two vastly different continents highlighting not just two cultures but three: Yemeni, English and Scottish. The landscaping is just beautiful. I love to fish and was rooting for the sheik when he hooked his salmon... and wouldn't have minded hopping in the river beside him.<br /><br />Tolerance, patience and belief that it can be done... hmm... maybe more of the world should learn to fish together?:-)
B00DL47PHI|5.0|It is not our imagination that many species are becoming extinct. We need to be aware that making use of nature should not be synonymous with destroying or using it up since we will drown in our selfishness, ignorance and waste which is increasing everyday. What some do to many creatures of this planet, including to this planet are those criminals without integrity that are not hold liable since their victims do not have a voice.<br /><br />When I watched [[ASIN:B002YEWLU2 The Cove Documentary]], the disturbing part was how could a group of people in a civilized society known for their accomplishments in this case Japanese, gather up hundreds of dolphins every year, year after year and slaughter those dolphins by hitting them so hard that blood covers such a huge area in the ocean without any protest or any resistance from a single citizen, all in the name of gathering and selling few dolphins to other nations and the rest of their catch to their citizens for a whale meat instead of a dolphin meat. To understand the impact of the Sea World, an American business on dolphins, killer whales, etc. as well as the Japanese, one needs to watch [[ASIN:B000VEGUHC A Fall from Freedom Documentary]]. These days, the Japanese Navy even accompanies whale killing vessels in Antarctica supporting the Japanese fisherman from environmentalists.

B002PNAY9C|4.0|Brisingr 4 stars<br /><br />Brisingr is the third book in the Inheritance Cycle and I thought it was a better story than Eldest. The overall tone, hazards, and subject matter was a little more serious in nature.  Eragon and Saphira continue on their quest to overthrow Galbatorix. I enjoy that these novels are a bit long despite the fact that the author tends to draw things out a bit. Sometimes when you are into the story though, you don't want it to end (or too soon at least). Read the one and two stars reviews for detractions. Most comments are on the money and don't need to be repeated. I have been keeping an open mind and trying not to be too quick to criticize, as these books are written for a younger audience in mind. I do feel that the author has matured in writing since Eragon and it is nice to see his writing evolve for the better. Overall, the plot is very simple and despite some issues, I thought the author did a good job. I look forward to reading Inheritance.<br /><br />Jeff<br />Indieproofreader@gmail.com
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Great card game! Haven't hit a wall of boredom.  Fair chance to earn money and such.  Challenging and some strategy involved.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a fantastic and realistic game for all ages!you get to compete and take care of as many horses as you would like.
1936891026|5.0|This is a must read for everyone. Applicable to anyone with goals (everyone) and I found this to be very motivational.
B00CU7ZMRW|5.0|Some months ago, blinded by the nice presentation of two red and orange colored LPs, I bought the limited edition issued by &#34;Rhino / Enjoy the ride&#34; of Dream Theater's IMAGES AND WORDS.<br /><br />Then, upon knowing that a newer version was to be released by &#34;Music on vinyl&#34;, I was interested. Again. There was something wrong with the &#34;other&#34; version. I'll tell you what it is.<br /><br />&#34;Music on vinyl&#34; edition of IMAGES AND WORDS delivers everything you'd expect from a reissue of an old record. Robust and clear sound all around. Strong on the bass, crystal clear trebles. And everything well separated, the quality that allows you to hear the music as never before, discovering little things here and there the you didn't notice before. It looks like somebody got a hold of the original tapes, and took the time to remaster it.<br /><br />On the other hand, the Rhino/Enjoy edition, well it loks like it was remastered too... From the cd ! Flat sound, not impressive. It looks like the bass sound was boosted, but it only adds to too much noise and little clarity. Really, you wouldn't notice a big difference from the digital counterpart. It may be even worst.<br /><br />Yeah, that Rhino edition tries to win you by being eye candy. But of course, LP is about how well it sounds, first and foremost.<br /><br />On that regard, the &#34;Music on vinyl&#34; edition has a great package, only lacking the fancy colored records. Even the cover looks better, with better colors. And it even includes an insert with lyics. The other edition doesn't.<br /><br />The only &#34;but&#34; that some may find, is that unlike the Rhino/Enjoy edition, the &#34;Music on vinyl&#34; version comes in only one LP, not two. So, you have more grooves squeezed together, because you have too much information in each side ('26 and almost '30 minutes, respectively). But as I said, it doesn't affect the quality of the sound (and what would you win anyway by having the sound stretched  in two units, if the original sound is bad to begin with ?). It would only take a little more care, in order to avoid scratches and dirt that would affect this more sensitive kind of grooves.<br /><br />Important note: To be fair, I must repeat that the Rhino version that so disappointed me, was the special colored vinyl version. There is another in regular black vinyl. Could it be that the bad sound is  consequence of the colored vinyl? Well it could be, but I doubt it. I have no complaints with other colored vinyls that I own. But only someone who owns the Rhino black vinyls could say...
B002SF9YUM|5.0|This exquisite story! It's composite of love, lunacy, creative genius, and fortune's fall is all-consuming. The performances are agonizingly beating and breaking. The history pulses and pulls through the souls of three luscious men, symbols of freedom and simultaneous bondage, with relationships that rip out our hearts.  I've never seen anything like this because it's never been done. It is astounding.
B00AEFY6ZQ|4.0|Hatari is a movie that was in theaters in the early 60's.  It is a story about some guys who go to Africa to catch wild animals for zoos, etc.  There is no doubt that with the current state of affairs on the large animal populations in Africa that this movie is no longer politically correct.  I, however, being a John Wayne fan watched this movie as a child and was thoroughly entertained by it then and I still am.  The music, the action, and the comedy are still great.  Don't show this movie to your children.  It glorifies things that are not good for them, however for adults who understand how things were in the early sixties I would recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is the best game ever I refuse to stop playing this game it is so good also they should update more.
B005K8H8W0|5.0|So the vinyl is great, sounds better than cd. This was a great choice for reissue. The packaging is even better. The cover is done in a wonderful remix almost, the colors are trippy and the front and back are shiny as hell. Silverf*** is one of the most audibly pleasing song on record. It just sounds so wonderful.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's an amazing book I couldn't put it down until I finished it had so many surprises it kept my attention from start to finish can't wait to read the 3rd book ^_^
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|What is not to love about the loveable killer in Dexter? Now for season 2!<br />If you haven't watched any of it, you need to!!
B0042RUMG4|5.0|An overwhelmingly beautiful album. Minus the excellent but nonessential posse cuts Monster and So Appalled, every song is nearly perfect in sequencing and individual quality. An intense accomplishment.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Very descriptive, kept my attention but not necessarily a book I couldn't put down. Overall though, it was good and I will buy the second one!
B00874T02K|4.0|I've gone from 0 sit-ups to 100 in three weeks, so hopefully I'll get to 200 in three more. I did need to get back to week 2 at one point but didn't know how. It only allows to repeat a day or the week you're on. Still, nice app.
0062082353|5.0|I enjoyed read this book about a true American Hero. It was one of the best books I have read in a long time. Would recommend this book to anyone
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This movie was good. I like the acting and the ending was a surprise. I didn't expect the &#34;ghost&#34; ending. My husband said he had guessed it but I didn't and I enjoyed it. Just a relaxing kind of movie.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Interesting game. Very similar to another flying shooter that's very colorful and with interesting bosses called 'Orion Nebula'. [[ASIN:B00DOZ7DOY Chong Kok Seng Orion Nebula]] I enjoy both games very much.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|ordered this item as a filler item and it did not disappoint.  It's multi-tip allows for the use on several pieces of equipment from my Kindle Fire HD to my cell-phone (the smaller tip at the bottom).  It could be priced a little lower thought but all-in-all it's a good buy.
B000078DOI|5.0|MOTHER´s MILK is a great great album from the RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS.....All the songs ROCKS!!!!!TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!WELL DONE, CHILI PEPPERS!!!!!!!!!!!!MASTERPIECE!!!!!
1616550414|5.0|IT is a hardcover book, it was wrapped in plastic and got there fast. My son loves it. Great price.
B0054N73EY|5.0|While I´M WITH YOU is not a masterpiece like BLOOD SUGAR and CALIFORNICATION, there´s plenty great songs like FACTORY OF FAITH, MONARCHY OF ROSES, DID I LET YOU KNOW, ADVENTURES OF RAIN DANCE MAGGIE and LOOK AROUND....The CHILI PEPPERS are on the road for a long time, and most all their albums are great!!!! WELL DONE, PEPPERS!!!!!!!!
B0012GMVDK|4.0|Anything & everything Mr. Cohen does has Heart...He is a true Classic.....I love the way he tells a story in his songs....
B000002MTR|5.0|ONE HOT MINUTE is a great great album from the RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS....Dave Navarro did a great job here, creating a more HEAVY METAL sound on the FUNK ROCK of the Peppers.....It´s one of the best PEPPERS albums with gens like WARPED, AEROPLANE and COFFEE SHOP!!!!!!!MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I loved this movie!  I'm nuts about anything and everything &#34;Oz&#34;, and this one does not let me down.  So much better than the just-plain-awful &#34;Return to Oz&#34; Disney did so many years ago, but maybe not quite as good as the stage production &#34;Wicked&#34;.  It is true to the L.Frank Baum visions, and I enjoyed the casting.  The Wicked Witch's transformation is very powerful.  This movie is visually rich and so, so beautiful!  I will watch this over and over until I have it memorized.  Thanks again, Disney!
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is another masterpiece from the great RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS....MOTHERS´s MILK, BLOOD SUGAR and ONE HOT MINUTE are all glorious FUNK ROCK METAL masterpieces, and CALIFORNICATION is on their high ROCK level!!!! THere´s some HUGE HITS here, like SCAR TISSUE, OTHERSIDE, AROUND THE WORLD, ROAD TRIPPIN, PARALLEL UNIVERSE and the title track....but ALL the songs ROCKS like GET ON TOP, I LIKE DIRT and EASILY.....MASTERPIECE!!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!
B00COQKE2M|2.0|But then, I'm 58.  I ordered this for my Granddaughter who is 13 and she loves it.  I just don't understand kids these days....or their &#34;music&#34;.....
B000067CPX|4.0|While it´s not one of my favourite albums from the CHILI PEPPERS, BY THE WAY got some classics like the title track, ZEPHYR SONG and CAN´T STOP....But it´s a bit too POP and slow with many ballads.....
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|IT strategy is something that people either get or they don't, in my experience. But IT management - the other side of the CIO coin - is a science that one can get a big leg up on by reading this book.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Man, the CHILI PEPPERS are creating GREAT music for a long time now, and STADIUM ARCADIUM is among the TOTAL BEST these guys created!!!!! There´s A LOT of songs....28!!!! But, believe in me and the other 5 star reviews....THIS IS A GREAT GREAT ALBUM!!!!! I can say that most ALL the songs are great.....THIS IS A HUGE MASTERPIECE in 2 discs!!!!!!

While most ALL the PEPPERS stuff rules, this is the one....the collection of great HUGE GENS that put the PEPPERS on the hall of fame of ROCK!!!!! All the songs are so great, funky and inspired.....TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!WELL DONE, RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00506NRBS|4.0|Derek has the perfect track record to be able to write like this. He sounds like such an average person, which is what I think makes his businesses work and makes this book so great. Practical advice, funny stories and details of failure all come together to form this quick read. An hour well spent!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|The right price and size!  I wanted to protect my investment of the Kindle Fire, and be able to spot my Fire really fast, so the  red color reaches out to me.  I love the strap that holds it together and I clip my stylus to it for easy access.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I really enjoyed the game but hated spending $5 for it.  It was challenging but not so hard you want to quit.
B00ARI9CDQ|2.0|Not really sure how it works. I loaded it but have not had the need to use it and I am confused by it.
0439023513|5.0|I'm not normally one to write reviews but after just finishing this book, I feel I need to. First of all, I cannot choose a favorite out of the trilogy since each book was amazing in its own way. This book, however, was a lot different from the others. I was extremely surprised by the bad reviews it got, but as some of the others have said, the ones who gave it only 1 star were expecting a fairy tale \\"happily ever after\\" ending, which is far from what this provides. In my opinion, though, it could not have been the wonderful trilogy that it is without this conclusion.<br />  The entire idea it is surrounding is one that shockingly is not so far fetched in what our future could become, and the horrors of what the human species has proven its nature to be. Everyone has their own hidden agendas when power is involved, so there is really no one to trust; not the Capitol, not the rebels. Katniss was merely a pawn for the side that was seen as the lesser of two evils. Being tossed in and out of horrifying games(in the arena and out), murdering innocents, being ushered around to put on a show in the midst of destruction and chaos, seeing everyone she knew become subject to this insanity as will: will not result in someone unscathed in reality, so I don't believe it should've been any different in this story. She was part of a war, a brutal terrifying war. This was exactly what would have happened, which is why I think it was so powerful. For much of the book I found myself either completely depressed, crying, or just feeling empty, and still feeling that way. In my mind, a book that can do that to you is a very well written, and well thought out story. By far my favorite trilogy!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I love everything about this movie.  I especially love them signing &#34;live&#34; and enjoyed Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe very much in this movie.
B000E5N6LG|5.0|Great movie. Kevin Costner plays the roll very well. This movie will soon be a classic. Buy it if its still available.
B000AMSSAW|1.0|The movie does not work in any of the DVD players in my house. I am very unhappy with the product.
B00827OWO8|5.0|I already knew this movie a long time, but wanted to see it again and wanted to purchase it. Very good.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|This product is a plastic p o s. the  iPhone does not fit in it like the picture. When I tried to fit the phone in the holder, it broke.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|This is more then i imagine, amazing hiAnd a very engaging film, and I really identified with the film clearly shows the reality of things. Excellent in every way.story....
B00005NWM3|1.0|I heard a nicelback song and i kinda liked it, so i decided to buy the cd. Needless to say i was pleased at first, but track 2 was the exact same song. At this point i was confused, but i kept listening. And to my dismay the entire cd was the same song played again and again. I looked up more online and found that they havnt made any new songs. They keep using the same song. My advise would be to buy a single, because thats all you need for the full nickelback experience
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I finished this book in one sitting LOL.<br /><br />Well I must say there was twist and turns. I threw my kindle, yelled at it. I felt like I was on this emotional coaster as well and I felt it all. I can relate to some of the feelings that Sky was feeling.<br /><br />I'm excited to read the next book
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War are fascinating subjects.  This book gives the reader an inside and personal look at Lincoln, his cabinet, his key Generals and the political landscape of the period.<br /><br />Mr Lincoln is presented as a crafty leader who was often underrated by his fellow leaders.  He is also presented as a remarkable man with a delightful temperament and sense of humor that carried him through one of the country's greatest crises.  He was also one of the greatest communicators in history much like Churchill, Roosevelt, Kennedy and Reagan.  One of his finest attributes was his ability to absorb slights and direct insults without holding grudges.<br /><br />Of the leaders one meets in this book, Secretary of State Seward comes off particularly well.  A fierce Lincoln opponent early on, Seward came around quickly and became his most trusted friend and cabinet member.  Grant is presented well as one of the few Union generals who could be counted on to get the job done.  The interactions with Frederick Douglas also highlight Lincoln's fine character.<br /><br />Salmon Chase is presented as a highly capable Secretary of Treasury, but also as a backstabber whose lifelong ambition was to become President.  Worse though, was General McLellan who lived obscenely well in the field, had no apparent willingness to fight and who constantly blamed Lincoln, Stanton and everyone else for his own failings.  I found him truly disgusting.<br /><br />The author also covers the politics of the day with the radicals and abolitionists focused on only one issue--slavery.  Lincoln's challenges in executing a war while balancing the various Union factions and holding them together until his Generals could get the job done are well covered.<br /><br />In the end, one feels that, as with Washinton in the early years, the country was extremely fortunate to have Lincoln at the helm.  Without him, there is no telling where we would be today.  Had he lived, the probability isthat Reconstruction would have been a much less painful process.<br /><br />This is a great book!  As the author has said in interviews, any time spent getting to know Mr. Lincoln is time well spent.
B000002NJS|5.0|I love my CD. I put it in my car and listen to it couple of time a week.<br />It is in good condition. I received it on time with perfect price. I love this seller, and I recommend it to everyone.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I don`t want the dream to be over.  I doubt a movie could match what I saw in my head but under the right direction, maybe.  PURE MAGIC.
0061122416|4.0|The book is in good condition by it self. It came on time, but I didn't liked the packaging. It was like bobble wrap envelope which protects the book, and it was fine if it was shipped regularly.  I have a small P.O Box, when I receive a large item that could not fit into it, the post office put it aside, and write me a note to receive it separately. This item was big, but it was bendable, so in order to fit into my P.O Box they bent it, and pushed it in the box; as a result, my book got bent. I know that was post office fault, but my concern is, if the packaging was  a small box, or something hard, this would not happened.<br />I put several heavy weight in order to fix the bending which they worked little bit.<br />I love my book anyway, and I enjoy reading it.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I couldn't have been more pleased with this Superman movie! I've read some reviews that said there was not enough character development and that the final third of the film had too much action. I don't agree with either of those opinions. I thought the setup with Clark searching for his origins was really well done, I thought the use of flashbacks moved things along faster and was very interesting, and I loved the way Lois tracked him down and the way their first meeting went.<br /><br />As far as the action and special effects went. Wow!! I will say that I can understand how some people would feel that the length and intensity of the action at the end might be exhausting, but in my case, I have been wanting to see Superman in that kind of building-collapsing slugfest since I first HEARD of the character. It was GREAT!! And the part where you see Zod gaining the power of flight and taking off his Kryptonian armor was truly scary. I found myself thinking, \\"Jeez, if Superman doesn't take him down right now, he may not be able to later, and the world will be lost!\\". It was really a thrilling, comic book, feel-like-a-kid moment. Just a great movie. I'm putting aside coins from my paper route now, so I can buy multiple copies of the blu-rays ASAP!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|So read the book! It's a thoughtful trip around the world with the undead -and the living who always have the potential to be more frightening than any monster.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game.  It starts quite easy but gets to quite hard over time.  Four more words required.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|DA is the best thing going rt now.  If you loved season three, hold on to your hat for season four!  I don't know any female who didn't love it.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This is one of the better movies I've seen this year.  It is quite violent, so don't let the kids watch.  I would see this again.
B00632HWOG|4.0|that's okay though Yahoo...you sometimes are the slow one in the race, but I will keep you around ;) I do like how you seem to be trainable for spam.
B0030V0PEW|4.0|It is easy to sell the virtues of checklists, though Gawande does so with exceptional literary skill.  The more important and challenging insights are those discussing the resistance, personal and organizational, to adopting and using checklists.  I wish he had spoken at greater length about his successes and failures in change management, but perhaps that would be beyond the interest of most readers.  I will recommend to those I work with, and will likely see more personal use of checklists.
0545265355|3.0|I loved the Hunger Games, stayed up late to read one more chapter, then another.  Book two wasn't bad, the third book seemed to be the same battles over and over again. ( I can't believe they intend to split that into two movies. Well, yes I can.)  I bought the books because everyone was reading them and I wanted to talk about them to young people in the family,  But I won't reread them, and gave them away..
B0031RAOVY|5.0|We have watched this a couple times, and really like the movie.  I have also used it as a gift.
B00AK77WPE|5.0|Excellent!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was able to follow the characters well and it was mostly exciting. Will continue to watch next season. Thanks.
B00785P2QC|4.0|So far this has been a pretty good game. Granted I'm only on level six, so we will see what happens. One thing that could be better is being able to build more &quot;environment&quot; items earlier on in the game. They take way to long to unlock.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Worked better than I thought...a great buy for the price! Will definitely recommend this to my friends and have already bought one for my Dad as a Father's Day gift.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. it is a little easy I have to admit, but if you love minions,  you will love it too.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great book.  I decided to reread the first as opposed to starting mid stream and I'm glad I did.  Fantastic!
B001RL4K1Q|5.0|got to my house quickly and was in good condition. i also bought spun, requiem for a dream, eyes wide shut, and vanilla sky.
B000BCE918|3.0|I think this is a pretty good three-pack deal for those that have not seen all the movies, and/or are dino-philes.<br /><br />The first movie is great, exciting, fun to watch and gives both a sense of terror and wonder, exactly what one would hope for in a dinosaur movie.<br /><br />Lost World is pretty good, some exciting parts, amazing special effects for its time, but  the wonder that made the first movie so great, wasn't as strong as it could have been.<br /><br />Jurassic Park III, was a monster movie with a lot of great special effects, and little else for the dinos or the audience to sink their teeth into.<br /><br />To sum up, you like dinos, and haven't seen these movies, this reasonably priced three-pack is definitely worth a look.
B00005ATQD|5.0|got to my house quickly and was in good condition. i also bought spun, requiem for a dream, vanilla sky, and train spotting.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is like nicatine. Can't stop and playing it before I realize that you are and can't quit when even when you do.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|got to my house quickly and was in good condition. I also bought spun, eyes wide shut, vanilla sky and train spotting.
B004ZG5F3M|5.0|This movie is charming, a magical fairytale quality, yet serious social relationships issues explored.  The music is delightful. It is especially enjoyable in blue ray.  I would recommend it to anyone, especially to those who like fantasy, romatic movies.  The actors are all excellent.
B007EDYN36|4.0|Very interesting and seemed very honest.  I never thought of him as a technical drummer - much more of a musician than I knew of.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|good game to play when you have to kill time. Easy to play and doesn't take a whole lot of thinking to play. Anyone can play it. :)
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Outstanding movie! The music, storyline and most of all, the acting by some of Britain's best is memorable. The Quartet has  quickly become one of my favorites.  If loud action moveies attract you, skip this but if your tastes run to fine character development and sensitive, understated acting, this is for you.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|whats not to like about angry birds? and it was FREE! Great app would recommend it to anyone who loves to play on your tablet. :)
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Right up there with best political dramas, House of Cards never wavers in its impeccable quality. Can't wait for season 2.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Awesome show! Jim Parsons is hilarious. Sheldon cooper is too funny. Would recommend this show to everyone. It won't disappoint! :D
B000IHSKSY|5.0|The heading pretty much says it all.  These are the best outdoor sandals ever made.  The toe cap is incredibly protective, the leather doesn't hold tons of water and the sandals have a very grippy sole.  Whether wet or dry they things do it all.  Don't hesitate - get them!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. its so fun. 101games-in-1omg.love it.I want to say you like this game say heck yea because its awesome. the game involves arrows;romance;rockets;and more. its so fun
B008JFUQZ2|3.0|In the modern-day action film you come to expect it: The big special-effects, blockbuster extravaganza! The world in peril; Only one hero can save us; It's all-out action! &#34;Pacific Rim&#34; is all of those things. And while it's enjoyable for what it is, it doesn't bring you anything you haven't seen before.<br /><br />The plot revolves around an inter-dimension rift in the ocean, that allows giant monsters to come into our world. The only force to stop them are giant robots, called &#34;Jaegers,&#34; which rely on two pilots to control it. When the threat of the monsters becomes too great, the &#34;Jaegers&#34; must undertake a mission that is a do-or-die proposition for them and the Earth!<br /><br />As I said, this film hits all the notes that you expect. There's lots of action and visual effects on display. And some of the battles are a bit exciting. But it also has character plots that are so by-the-numbers, that you could set your watch to them. The one jerk pilot (played by Robert Kazinsky) is always poking our hero pilot (played by Charlie Hunnam), so you know a throw down between them is inevitable. Then you have the story point about only one other guy having piloted a &#34;Jaeger&#34; solo, besides our hero, and they telegraph to you who it is, so when it is revealed, there is absolutely no surprise at all to it. Much of the character development stuff between the battles, while not dragging in pace, certainly doesn't do much to advance your interest or investment in the characters. It's decent filler material, but you'll see the &#34;twists&#34; coming a mile away.<br /><br />There is some nice comedy relief from Charlie Day's and Burn Gorman's characters, as they play a couple of squabbling and competitive scientists, looking to figure out a way to stop the monsters for good. And Ron Perlman's turn as a sleazy black market salesman is good for a few laughs, too. They bring a little bit of campy life to the script and downtime moments from the action sequences, which are enjoyable. But, overall, the character moments are just there to kill the time between monster fights. Director Guillermo del Toro knows that he's not looking to make a great dramatic tale, but a fast-paced action epic that is filled with lots of visual eye-candy for the viewer. And, for the most part, he accomplishes that much.<br /><br />In the end, &#34;Pacific Rim&#34; is what it is and does what it sets out to do. But it doesn't give you anything new, that you haven't seen before. To me, the film is basically &#34;Voltron meets Godzilla (the 1998 version)!&#34; It's a movie that's all about having some big, dumb fun, as it asks you to check your brain at the door. It's far from the worst movie you could see and there are definitely worse ways to kill 131 minutes of your day. So, if you are looking for a visually exciting spectacle, that won't cause you to tax your mental capacities, this film will give you what you crave! If you are looking for something more, you'd probably best look elsewhere.sequences, which are enjoyable. But, overall, the character moments are just there to kill the time between monster fights.

B00CL8D83U|5.0|In March of this past year the Pet Shop Boys did something I am very surprised they didn't do years ago: they left their longtime label Parlaphone and entered into a business arrangement with Kobalt Label Services. Their they launched their own label x2. This is their debut release as part of the new venture. And knowing their love of bracing out into enormous multi media events,this should provide enormous creative possibilities for the now renowned duo. Stuart Price,famous for his work with Madonna and The Killers, was chosen for the producer of this album. Since the majority of dance music today is based on the Pet Shop Boys musical innovations its only appropriate this album marks essentially a re-visitation to their musical salad days.<br /><br />  \\"Axis\\" is a wonderfully orchestrated house number that's mostly instrumental. \\"Bolshy\\" continues the house flavor with some vocals from Neil this time only more sparsely added. \\"Love Is A Bourgeoisie Concept\\" on the other hand is full on late 70's Eurodisco with yet another of their wonderfully witty lyrical concepts. \\"Fluorescent\\" has a very layered synthesizer harmonies with some creative use of melody-a very strongly crafted number here.  \\"Inside A Dream\\" has a very spare and breezy house arrangement and The Boss's \\"The Last To Die\\",a potent anti war song is given a modern day EDM/rock hybrid flavor to it-with a heavy steely thud worthy of Springsteen's wall of sound approach as well as Neil & Chris's own style as well.<br /><br />  \\"Shouting In The Evening\\" and the closer \\"Vocal\\",with it's musically descriptive lyrics are the most modern electro type numbers-with a strong rave influence. \\"Thursday\\",with British rapper Example providing a rap far superior to the foul mouthed US rappers would've offered, is very close in execution and even sound to their mid 80's sound and is a favorite of mind. A review here referred to this album as \\"the Pet Shop Boys new 'best since [[ASIN:B000002USP Very]]'\\" and that is an excellent description of this. Its a full of synth/dance album that not only works for a party or club but is filled with more than enough strong musical ideas to make it a headphone masterpiece as well. Its a Pet Shop Boys dance opus if their ever was one and a superb way for the duo to launch their own label!llent description of this.

0740745271|4.0|Since I got the book &#34;Mind's Eye Gallery&#34; first, this was not as much fun.  Not as many pictures to try to find the 3D image.  That said, the information on the how and why is informative and yet I am still left with more questions!  A great place to start learning.
B000KITQK2|4.0|I'm a sound engineer who bought this amp to supplement an in-ear-monitoring station in order to allow the musician to control the level with which he hears his instrument.  It appears to be working as advertised. The tone controls and modes allow a wide variety of applications and the direct XLR and 1/4&#34; phone jack outputs allow good connection flexibility.  An AC power adaptor can be bought separately if you don't want to keep feeding it 9V batteries.<br /><br />The only drawback was the lack of engineering specifications in the literature such as maximum gain.  I bought it not being sure if its output level would be sufficient to drive a line-level input to the local mixer. After trying it, there does seem to be sufficient gain to do so.  I'm thinking about buying a couple more for the same type of application.

Better still is the extra content you can purchase while playing. But my favorite part is this: you don't have to purchase anything or even have an internet connection to play. Once you download it - it's yours!

0345803485|1.0|I have a few regrets concerning this book.  One, I did not read the reviews of it before tackling it.  Two, I actually finished reading it (sort of; towards the end I started skimming pages at a time). Three, I have lost at least 6 hours of my life that I can't have back.<br /><br />I've attempted some terrible books in my life, most recently: \\"I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell,\\" which I could not get through.  So why, then, did I force myself to go through this?  I guess because it was a \\"story,\\" whereas \\"I Hope. . . Beer. . .\\" was a serious of fraternity-style vignettes.  Both involved misogynistic characters.  However, I think even \\"Beer in Hell\\" would have drawn the line at the endless \\"Fifty Shades of Crap.\\"<br /><br />I can't begin to top what other reviewers have written.  If this author had been a student in my English class, she would have failed.  The most glaring assault of this book is the handling of the English language.  The author is British.  One would think she'd have a better grasp of how to use it than the rest of us.  Sadly, no.  Repetition.  Bad grammar.  Mis-use (my favorite: \\"I'm a misfit.  I never fitted in.\\"  \\"Fitted in?\\")  Repetition.  Lack of imagery.<br /><br />Then there's the lack of tangeable plot.  The whole plot was boring.  I'm not a prude.  Erotica is fine, but it's possible to overdose on it.  Dessert is delightful once in awhile, but a steady diet of it leads to malnutrition, headaches, nausea, and more.<br /><br />Characters?? The ONLY likeable characters in the whole book were Ana's parents, and their roles were very minimal.  Everyone else was like a paper doll, two-dimensional, black and white, boring.  If I had to spend time with ANY of them, I'd run screaming to the nearest lunatic asylum to hang out with \\"normal\\" people.  Whiny, self-indulgent, stupid, pathetic, boring characters.<br /><br />Dialogue: Might have been normal for junior high students exploring erotica, if such an idea was not abhorent.<br /><br />Sentence variety.  The lack of any sort of interesting vocabulary and repetitive phrases makes me want to clean my brain with a scrub brush.  If anyone ever says the phrase \\"oh my\\" in my presence again, I might need to hurt them.  Lip biting, blushing, head cocking, \\"hot,\\" \\"what is it about - - fill in the blank?\\"<br /><br />And poor Thomas Hardy.  The abuse hurled at \\"Tess of the D'ubervilles,\\" which was actual quality literature, is just wrong.  Please, there is no comparison of heroines or plot to be made.  One author could write; the other could not.<br /><br />I've never felt such relief at reaching the end of a book.  It was like having the dentist turn, with a smile in his eyes, and say \\"Your triple root canal is over.\\"  All I want is a strong whiskey and a piece of delicious literature to sink my fangs into.<br /><br />If anyone is on the fence about reading this book, please, please, please heed the advice of my fellow one-star raters and do not attempt.  You will find yourself sickened, tearful, resentful, and angry that, not only did you waste your time reading this, but you also contributed to this author's prospering off of this insufferable trash!  If I ever find myself locked away with only the next two parts of this trilogy as reading material, I only pray there are scissors so I may cut it up and rearrange the words into something readable.

B008VVT51U|4.0|Nice movie for a date at home. The film moves a little slow which works fine for developing the characters. Relaxing, fun & thoughtful.
1781162646|3.0|Just okay. Reads more like a young adult novel.  Admittedly, I only got about 2/3s of the way through before putting it down and moving on to something more substantial.  I hope September's The Shining sequel, Doctor Sleep, is more adult and not as disappointing.

0425263908|1.0|I thought it would be great for the summer especially, after Fifty Shades-Not Even Close...The author was such a Copy Cat. She could &#34;Never&#34;  Write this as well as E.L James! It was very close to the same Story Plot. Eva even has a safe word....Hum sound Familiar-YES! It was such a Slow Boring read it literally Took me three weeks to read &#34;The first book and 50 shades took me a week to read the trilogy. The front cover of the book looks so similar to Fifty Shades—REALLY...Can We not make it so Obvious. I will not read the other books Whatsoever. I'm done! Waste of my time.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Although I have seen this movie in the theater it was great to sit in comfort at home and view it again.  It is a wonderful story and shows how we must laugh at ourselves as we age and make the most of what it means.  These lucky people happened to be in a Home where they were among other musicians and could enjoy ongoing music.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|My 8year old son was so happy to start playing this game but after a few min. he started telling me He had to buy things to keep moving forward in the game. and my 4.99 did not buy to much.  I think that it is wrong to offer free apps and then require a player (a child) to purchase things to move on in the game.  My child thought this was going to be such a cool game but was very disappointed after 30min and asked for it just to be deleted.  I would not suggest this game to a parent it is just a money pit....

B008CLI4N4|5.0|When I first watched GOT on HBO I had not read the books.  After Season 1 ended I read all the books then bought the series and rewatched it.

B003VWU2WA|5.0|6 functions (spin R/L, push and spin R/L, momentary push, held push) that give you some great control.  The app gives solid configurations options.  It feels solid and quite well made, and all movements feel smooth and clean; very effective input device.  The only issues I've had are that it has issue with remote desktops (writes letters instead of controlling the volume/etc) and application limitations around which applications it can control (it can play/pause/skip in iTunes, but not Pandora or VLC), but that doesn't detract from my opinion of it and I would absolutely buy it again.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game I get on it everyday but it stopped working so I updated it and it is still as great.
B00C061HZY|5.0|This record is awsome. That is it. Great music, great design, great audio quality. If you're into vinyl, you must have it, if it is for the music, you must have it. If both, no chance to avoid it.

B002QE3CTY|3.0|Heads up, spoilers.<br /><br />I tore through this trilogy pretty quickly, so it was pretty engaging, but it had its weaknesses. There are certain things that are not explained well enough by the end of this. Dashner clearly doesn't know how viruses work. WICKED was one-dimensional. The characters themselves were not independently engaging.<br /><br />Honestly, I can take bad science and hand-wavy plot lines. What bothered me the most was character development--or lack thereof. Even the protagonist isn't well developed. We're 'told' a lot of what Thomas thinks and feels, which diminishes the emotional impact of certain events. At one point in the first novel, he loses someone he cares about (and in an awful way too), but I found myself sighing and rolling my eyes because neither the &#34;friend&#34; nor the &#34;friendship&#34; were all that well developed. I just wasn't invested because his friend was a plot device, a cheap way of causing him more pain, and I saw that coming from a mile away. Unfortunately, this trend of underdeveloped characters continues through the trilogy. The only remotely interesting character was Newt, and he didn't start becoming interesting until the third book.<br /><br />That being said, this series had some upsides too. Dashner has interesting ideas of a post-Flare world and the society that follows. He has good pacing and comes up with neat scenarios. I liked the idea of the Gladers and Group B coming up with their own slang. As I was never a fan of &#34;Lord of the Flies&#34;, I also liked the idea of how cooperative they were within their own groups (and later each other). The plot is really engaging. It's the situation that keeps you reading, not the characters. For me, personally, I kept reading because I just wanted to find out how everything got better. I wanted to see the Gladers finally &#34;win&#34; and I was consistently heartbroken to see them jerked around by WICKED. The Cranks (past the Gone) were actually pretty scary ina zombie/horror movie villain way. The nose Crank in &#34;The Scorch Trials&#34; was especially freaky for me.<br /><br />All in all, I don't regret reading these, but it's highly unlikely I'll read them again.
8866137634|5.0|I'm a moleskine addict, after getting freaked out when I saw that the paper for the regular moleskine squared's have been purposefully messed up (darker/annoying lines, darker paper) I ordered several alternative's to replace my large squared regular moleskine, which was almost full<br /><br />I really love the green stripes, the cover etc, that's why I decided to continue with this notebook<br /><br />The reason I'm giving 1 star is because the dots are EXTREMELY annoying, when you write something on them they render themselves as irregularities in the writing, also when you look at the paper all you think about is \\"so many dots\\", it strains your recognition (If the dots were faded to 30% this notebook would be beautiful -- the dots are not as dark as the new lines, they are as dark as the old lines, however it's still annoying as they are dots and not lines)<br /><br />If you are like me, looking for a regular large squared moleskine replacement, hunt for old versions of the notebook<br /><br />I managed to find an old version of the regular, however that notebook had many defects, faulty seperator, glued damaged paper etc, so decided to go with this one instead<br /><br />Poor Quality Control + No User Testing = Moleskine<br />If only there was a viable alternative ...<br />-- edit --<br />after a while dots stop annoying, other than the dots, it's a great notebook, much better colors/looks/feel than regular squared moleskine's

030758836X|4.0|This book grabbed me from the first page. I really liked the character Nick and detested his wife Amy. I felt Amy's \\"voice\\" was too contrived, too much like a character in a book. But then I grew a little more understanding of Amy and started to dislike Nick.<br /><br />As the story unfolded, I realized that I was being manipulated - by both Amy and Nick. Or was I being manipulated by Gillian Flynn herself, through the characters Amy and Nick?<br /><br />Ah - it was hard to tell, that's how wily Flynn is. I became part of the mystery, as embroiled in it as a character, masterfully crafted by the writer. Being manipulated - by Nick, Amy, or Flynn - what does it matter? Who ever thinks of manipulation as a good thing? I didn't, until I read this novel and was happy to have fallen into Flynn's trap. That's serious writing talent, and I don't even like thrillers. I read this one as a dutiful member of my book club, but I couldn't put it down. Was that part of Flynn's masterful plan as well? Somehow I think she knows exactly what she is doing.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it five stars was the story unraveled in Part Three. It was almost as though Flynn was tired of the story and wanted to be done with it. And one note of caution - profanity peppers nearly every page. Even so, it is a roller coaster ride I would gladly recommend.

It takes him half the book to get down to the actual operation but that does not make the first half uninteresting.

But Dambisa Moyo explains well documented her argument why aid does not work and she gives possible alternatives. It is fascinating to read and gives new insights. From my own experience I recognise most aspects. And thanks to Dambisa I started investing in micro credits as well. For anybody interested in development cooperation this books is very worthwhile and a great read. Thanks for sharing Bambisa.

B00985E3UG|5.0|This book is incredible. I was only a few pages into it when I realized my mouth was hanging wide open in shock. I read a vast majority of this book out loud to anyone who would listen. I'm shocked and appalled at the food industry but understand where they are coming from. The author wrote this book without taking a side. He simply reported on the situation. After reading this book I feel I'm more educated in the ways of avoiding these foods and how not to fall victim to their marketing ploys. I still can't get over how long I've been duped by thinking certain foods, like yoplait yogurt, was actually good for me. Thank you Michael Moss. I may very well owe my life to you.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I've never really played this type of game  before but this one was a great place to start!! Honestly some of the other game  out there don't even compare to this  one!! I'll definitely be keeping my eyes open for the next chapter!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Although I don't love the headset that I got this case for, I do LOVE this case. I love how long the charge is and that I don't have to worry about having to recharge my headset everyday. It's also super convenient to be able to charge the case while using the headset. I'm no longer stuck holding my phone to my ear because I forgot to charge my headset!<br /><br />The case itself is sleek, small, rounded edges so it fits nicely in a small pocket in my bag. I would definitely recommend this case.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's like temple run but with cute little minions! I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys Gru and his little buddies
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games was a very well thought out story giving enough background so you had a good idea of what was going on, but not so much as to bog down the story line. The director did a very good job of bringing the audience into the story, of course some of that credit has to go to the cast who did an excellent job of living the story!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Good story and got the feeling of what it was like to live in Afghanistan during this time.  Characters very likable
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|After really enjoying the first two Quell games, I was excited to see Memento and bought it immediately (though I played the free versions of the first two). All three games are easily worth $3 each for the time and enjoyment they offer. Some puzzles are really tricky at first, but they make sense once the player figures out how they work. Winning every level perfectly (or better) is truly satisfying. I wish there were more games like this for Android.
B00271HAK8|5.0|John Hughes movies are awesome but some don't hold up as well 25 years latter.  But Ferris Bueller does, I love that you can stream this movie, now I watch it with my kids and they love it.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Easy game to learn, people complaining of no tutorial clearly have no experience with logic games or just want a game that's easy to play.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I actually purchased this cd for my husband for Father's Day. We watched the 25th Aniversary on TV and he really enjoyed it. He mentioned that he used to have the album and always enjoyed listening to it. So...I decided to get the cd so he can listen and enjoy it again!<br />It arrived in a timely manner and it was packaged well. It was a very reasonable price and we are both pleased with it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|My chill out time is used playing Bingo. Great game keeps me amused for hours. Made many bingo friends also, thats a bonus!
0743270754|5.0|I was absolutely pleased with this purchase. The book is \\"new\\", and I can not<br />wait to read it again.  thanks
B00CO8TA4I|5.0|This processor is a beast , is super fast and very reliable . Is all you need if you are going to build a gaming pc, and for you guys that want to know the &#34;grade&#34; WEI gave it in my system is a 7.6<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price<br />Performance<br />Quad core<br /><br />Cons:<br />none<br /><br />System:<br />Intel core i5 4570<br />Msi z87 g43<br />Kingston hyper X genesis 8 gb<br />Sapphire hd 7850 1 gb<br />XFX PRO750W
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I've loved Jennifer Lawrence ever since I saw her in [[ASIN:B00498TQV8 Winter's Bone]] and [[ASIN:B008602KQI The Hunger Games]] and who doesn't love Bradley Cooper, especially in [[ASIN:B002RVCCUQ The Hangover]]?<br /><br />These two played off each other perfectly in this quirky look at Pat and Tiffany, living in Philadelphia, both a wee bit crazy (really), both having spousal issues, and both needing a friend that won't judge them.<br /><br />There are some great side characters, too, including Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver as Pat's father and mother.<br /><br />Funny, poignant, uplifting - this movie has it all.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am still having problems with getting into the shop to buy the things for the game. But other than that I really love the game. The problems do not stop me from playing the game.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I'm going to say there might be MINOR SPOILERS in this review but if you've seen the trailers, you've seen most of what I write about.<br /><br />There is a pee-your-pants airplane crash to start the story off but what this movie is about - truly about - is substance abuse and it's effect on the abuser and those around him/her. And it is one of the better movies I've seen on that subject.<br /><br />Pilot Whip Whitaker miraculously lands his damaged plane, while heavily under the influence of more than one addictive substance. Does it matter that no one believes that ANY other pilot could have landed this plane, sober or not?<br /><br />Washington plays a gut wrenching role of a man struggling with his demons. Masterful.<br /><br />There were some excellent co-stars in the movie, too. Kelly Reilly, Don Cheadle, John Goodman were just some of a superb cast. Reilly especially in her role as Nicole, who has her own demons to fight, was splendid.<br /><br />NOTE: There is some nudity in this movie and excessive alcohol and other substance use.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Watched this several time at my sister's, but got married and moved out of state.  When I saw that Despicable Me 2 was coming out, I ordered this to watch with my husband prior to seeing #2.  I'm not sure if just watching it again was enjoyable, or hearing my darling husband laughing out loud during it was better.<br />A must watch for both children AND adults.
0062255657|4.0|Another example of great Neil Gaiman fantasy. If you like innocence meets the other side of the veil, you will love this.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO AMAZING, SO FANTASTLY SCARY THAT MY FRIENDS AND I PLAY IT IN THE DARK AND SCREAM FOR LOUD ENOUGH FOR CHINA TO HEAR US. I recommend this app to any Slenderman fans, also if you want a legit slenderman movie there is one on YouTube.
159463176X|4.0|Hossein's writing is fine, and his stories are exotic and interesting.  Nevertheless, I'm not sure the book is that memorable.
B001EOOQEM|5.0|Great Black Sabbath rock with Ronnie James Dio at the helm. Turn it up to 11 and enjoy. I really like this lp Dio's vocals really separate this music from the Ozzy era. All good
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This is a unique play for Woody Allen and a &#34;personal best&#34; performance by Owen Wilson. Marion Cotillard is wonderful as always.  If you love action films, pass this one up.  If you love sensitive, whimsical stories, see Midnight in Paris.
B001NVIZ9I|3.0|The story is familiar - but the colors and pure joy that seemed to be had by the actors makes this a pleasure to watch again and again - RECOMMEND IT.
B0019IIPXQ|5.0|A fun story with great characters and acting. I'm always pleased when I find myself drawn to the characters and caring about what happens to them. It was a very well made action film especially considering the fact that it didn't have a blockbuster budget. Riddick is a mysterious character and his history is not fully fleshed out in this movie, leaving me wanting more. By the end of the story, I was eager to follow him on his next adventure.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|This app for my  Samsung Galaxy S III works quite well and I have had no issues with it - recommended for other Android devices.
B0082RHRHC|1.0|This is chick lit and sexist. Poor plain Jane, the governess who falls for her playboy rich Boss.<br /><br />I don't like any of the bronte sisters works. I've always admired George Eliot and Gaskell over them. They don't write high octane pathetic romances, but the social and poltical dynamics involved in their work has always been far more interesting.<br /><br />btw -Gaskell and Charlotte were friends and Gaskell wrote The Life of Charlotte Brontë (1857).
B000N5F6OW|4.0|Loved the landscape and the music - takes you to another place and time - great entertainment value - watched it several times and liked it each time - RECOMMEND IT.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|I loved this album. Every song is a joy to listen to.  I don't skip any songs.  Hope she makes another album!  Have been a fan since 1975.  This is her best solo album so far!
B0086700CM|4.0|It is a fun, single player exercise in hand and eye coordination.  This is one I recommend to others as it works quite well on my Samsung Galaxy S III.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ttttthhhhhhhiiiiiisssssss is the best game eeeevvvvvaaaarrr inventid I apsloutly love it worth the mony<br />believe me so what are you whating for get it
B004FRX0MY|3.0|This is an app that I have downloaded to my Samsung Galaxy S III for playing my music.  Works to specs.
B0043URV5U|5.0|Here it is ...  Timeless really ...  I'll never get tired of these Classic Bob Seger recordings ... My Favorite &#34;Rock and Roll Never Forgets&#34; is included ...
B001M3PQGM|3.0|Interesting to see a Viking in King Arthur's court - just like in the comic strip series from earlier years that I use to read every Sunday in the papers.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|i have purchased ebok collections before and found it hard to navigate them, but I've had no problems so far!
0449011151|4.0|It was enjoyable to hear the life of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy after the story by Jane Austin ended.  Good charactors acting like you think they shoould in an entertaining story - like it and recommend it.
B009CPEOC4|4.0|Yes...I teared up a bit during the break up (and I'm a fan of \\"The One That Got Away). A well-done documentary about a woman on a very gruelling music tour while trying to maintain her relationship at the same time.
B005ZCXFD2|3.0|Nice to see a familiar alien invasion movie take on a different approach in this English version - really interesting.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|I saved up all my peanuts for getting a panda I accidentally buy a zebra and bear...I am pissed because it never ask me if I wanted to buy it! It was a slip of the finger.. it needs a double hit button to confirm a purchase when buying animals!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Provides a nice snug fit for my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; and it looks and feels more luxurious than the price would have you think.  I'd definitely recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Wow! There was so many twist and turns, great roller coaster ride. Some stuff was disturbing but overall great love story.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|Pro edition great.  Four cameras alined on screen perfect shots. Movement is captured every time. email functions perfectly. Love this app.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|EXTREMELY FUN! Super addictive and fun. My kids love it so much they fight over it! We love the minions and in this game they are as funny and cute as ever!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like the ability to check on Facebook without going to my laptop.  I have been using it steadily since I got the Kindle.  I know I will use it a lot.
1451695195|5.0|I ordered this book over six weeks ago and finally received it yesterday.  It would be very helpful to know how these small items ship, especially for those of us who have a POB only.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I really dig it. At first I wasn't even sure what I was doing but I just started tapping my finger around the screen and I started solving puzzles I didn't originally know we're there. A real Sherlock Homes.
1564428117|5.0|This is THE BEST horror movie around (by my opinion) . And the mind of John Carpender made this was amazing and this is the movie that made Jamie Lee Curtis famous. The legend of Micheal Myers still scares people after 35 years
B007MDB71O|5.0|It has it all for everybody!!! sci-fi, love story, princess, kings, wars, aliens,a dog monster thing, space travel, cowboys and indians, old west, gold mining, battles, more battles, kids love it boys and girls.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I saw the title and couldn't help but wonder what it was about. I LOVE IT. My family and I enjoy it a lot.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome book with a lot of changes you didn't see coming and had a great ending :)  definitely recommend it!
B0019IB0II|5.0|My Stroke of Insight By Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor has clearly took me and my family through her successful journey of recovering from her brain hemorrhage. She has nonetheless explained who, where, when, what, why, and HOW she lived and recovered from it, which has given us understanding of a family members fight as well. Shes given us useful tips and beautiful encouragements to live on. My family and I have found comfort within this book to accept, understand and let go. We don't know what its like, but we know.
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|Great Lost Jams ! 4 Cd Box Set of remastered magic ! Did this really come out 40 years ago !
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Still intriguing as ever and surprising twists. Some of the developments are sad to see but life is like that. Interesting to see how, even with the &#34;privileged&#34;  the traditional is replaced with the new even when it is strongly resisted.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game combines the puzzle solving mini games with hidden objects with an interesting storyline. Well worth the cons especially with a free preview.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the book but the catchy synopsis that caused me to buy it and warned \\"watch out for the big twist 1/2 way through, you will never guess where this story will take you\\" was a joke. I guessed correctly, like I'm sure most readers will, but alas I finished it and will probably go see the movie too when it comes out.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great story and excellent acting.  The home is beautiful inside and the gardens.  Can not wait to see the next season.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|If you like the new Upstairs Downstairs, you'll like this as well. The acting is very good and the variety of characters adds to the interest.
B003VXMMTK|4.0|I remember reading this book in high school.  The movie gives a good review.  The acting was very good but it really is not my type of story even if it is a classic.
B009178OQA|5.0|Such a wonderful story of family, food, work ethics and the logistics of acquiring rare and fine food. Truly fine film making
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|the book was properly advertised,simple tyo find and a breeze  to  review. These are all characteristic of amazon. Amazon never let me down.
B009IF82SK|5.0|I worked with many scientists at NASA and they are just like these guys. A great change from all the boring cop and blood and guts shows.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|After the last update this app is CRAP!!!!!! PLEASE GO BACK TO THE LAST VERSION! Everyone else who gave you a one star review was written in the last few days! This app is BEYOND STUPID now! Everyone loved it before!
B003UYUP58|5.0|This book took hold of me  and overwhelmed me right from the first page to the last .Dr Mukherjee comes across  as a clinician who  not only has a deep compassion for his patients but also a  keen insight into cancer. He has studied  the journey of this devious intelligent 'being ' called cancer and written about it in a manner which makes me look at future outcomes of cancer in a more positive way .And he writes beautifully . I was overcome with emotion, not a few times , at his poetic lyrical writing . Well worth the Pulitzer .
B0064X7FVE|4.0|personally, I like the new upgrade and I have always enjoyed the weather channel app. I think the upgrade was good and helpful, I dont llike the little &quot;present&quot; or &quot;gift&quot; things you get. I just want the weather. Also, I don't like the &quot;past&quot; selection on the radar, but hy no means does that make it a bad app. I think the new upgrade make the weather more accessable while still aesthetically pleasing. Good job.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Overrated and not even worth the rental price. After all of the hype I thought it would at very worst be \\"O.K.\\" but I was extremely disappointed. It was a waste of time and money and I would not recommend.
B007HACDLK|5.0|See my headline, above.  There's certain genres that I enjoy, and action/thriller is at the top of that list.  Lee Child, Vince Flynn, Tom Clancy, and Martin Cruz Smith to name a few.  Vince was always near the top of the pile.  I was shocked at his recent passing, and he will be missed.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|The movie was very good.  I enjoyed seeing this action packed movie, one reason it had hardly any cussing.  I hate to see a movie with f... and gd and cuss words.  People I know don't use these words in everyday conversations.  I wish they would make more movies without cussing.  I don't go often to the movies for this reason of the language.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If this were a book, I'd call it a &#34;page turner&#34;.  I honestly did not expect a saga about Edwardian aristocracy to be so enthralling. Yet, here I am, eagerly awaiting what comes next!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I was glad that with practice I didn't have to rely on buying with real money, which was my biggest fear. Great for what it is. I gave only 4 stars because game play doesn't vary all that much. Fast paced, great graphics, and rich sounds.
B005LJITS0|4.0|This movie was entertaining and fun to watch. It was creative and action packed. This was a good one to rent.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Just discovered Gru and the minions and absolutely loved this movie.  I am not a kid and laughed a lot throughout the movie (cried once, too).  Little minions make your day for sure.
B00CLD65X0|1.0|The French and Russians killed every single one of this class in their country and England should have also. Here in the USA we tried to keep this hereditary elite class from forming with the tax code eliminating most inheritance but over time they changed the debate ( calling it a death tax ) and eliminated almost all of the protection. Today we, also, have a hereditary elite that needs to be hung, each and every one of them.<br /><br />Anyway, this show details the many reasons these people are maggots, eating away at the flesh of society.
B003NS1JHY|5.0|I am a big fan of the original WWW TV show, and have all that is available out for the TV show. I truely hate remakes of the old TV shows over the years. I did enjoy this movie. I tried not to compare it to the original and just enjoy it for what it was. I like Will Smith and Keven Kline movies.
B000PMG16U|5.0|My husband and 7 year old son are very into Star Wars, so I was excited by the good deal of having 3 movies in one case.  I like how, for a non-fan, I can make sense of the order of all of the films, so it's a win-win.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy this Ap. its fun for all ages and the graphics are wonderful ! Its free and entertaining, and it relaxes me because it is a very un-stressful game.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app! You can easily get lost for hours pinning to your boards. It feels like shopping without actually buying anything!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's hard to find good new science fiction literature this days, there is a lot of stuff out there. I followed the hype about Wool just because my urgency to read something.<br /><br />And now i'm very happy I did...<br /><br />It's just an excellent read, keeps you going, makes your mind picture everything in great detail without boring, It really is an instant classic.<br /><br />I just hope talented people make a TV show about it!!<br /><br />Love it
B00821OX98|4.0|I would compare this series to walking dead only instead of zombies its aliens. Same basic plot. However I liked both series so I guess I like the plot and acting.
0517543052|4.0|The story of Ram Dass's path to enlightenment is a fascinating one. The first part of this book is that story. A traditional read.<br /><br />Be forewarned that much of the book, the middle section, is a compilation of drawings, large print, free form stories and musings on brown paper that feel very hippie/trippie. You have to be in the right frame of mind, maybe have some incense burning, play some eastern music, open to a page, close the book and ponder. Not a sit in the recliner and read prose kind of book.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was a very good tale. Connor was AWESOME and I loved how he worked to convince Megan that they were good for each other. It took him a while to realize what his true feelings were, but I absolutely loved this couple and cheered them on. A very good, real love story and will be looking for more stories from this author.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|When it first started and I realized it would be ALL singing, I didn't think I would be able to handle that.  But I figured I'd keep watching for a while.  After a while you forget they're singing and just start to listen to the words and get sucked in my the story.  I ended up loving the movie and really didn't think I would during the first 15 minutes or so.  Stick with it - it's worth it!
B003G4W49C|5.0|had heard of it but never read it until i saw the movie trailer.  the trailer made me interested in it.  it was great definitely worth reading.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 6 year old loves this game! And so do I!  The minions are adorable and the game is fun and addictive! We recommend this game!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|great show to go with great books.  if only HBO would put the seasons out more frequently or let you buy them as the season goes along.  a must see show
B0036EH3UC|1.0|I purchased BSG Galactica on the recommendation of friends. I never had time to watch TV because of work and DVDs are my best option.<br /><br />I made a point of also reading the Amazon reviews. They were at best misleading.<br /><br />I am more than disappointed. The writers of BSG Galactica have turned out one of the worst series I have ever seen. The plots are amateurish and plot turns are clumsy at best, The characters are caricatures and bad caricatures at that. When a character departs from type, it is not for character development but because the writer desperately needs a plot twist and is not bright enough to achieve it honestly. Some of the actors are highly skilled but they have nothing to work with. The others are beyond hope. The best of the scripts are moronic. The rest descend into idiocy. By the end of season one, the writers have telegraphed the ending so obviously that there is no suspense about the outcome.<br /><br />The sexual fantasies of Galactica are geared to an age twelve audience. The same goes for the constant use of the euphemism “fracking”.<br /><br />Galactica did clearly demonstrate why men and women should never serve together in combat conditions. I doubt that was the intent. The current news reporting about sexual assault problems in our newly integrated military forces is exactly what would be expected.<br /><br />Just a final thought. It would be nice if a writer using a military context would take the time to learn at least a little about how the military actually works. But then that would require intelligent writing.<br /><br />This series was so bad that it is not worth any more of my time. I absolutely regret the waste of money.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I thought that season 10 was a great season with unexpected twists and bonding between Ziva and the other characters.
B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|This book is very easy to understand step by step process to move your photos through all the modules of Lightroom 5. I can't recommend this book strongly enough. All the other Kelby Media books have become my go to books!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thank you Hugh,<br /><br />From everyone who ever dared to dream, who scribbled stories on random paper since very young, and those who may never achieve your level of success but still write out their stories regardless of audience, congratulations.  What engaging entertaining  dynamic characters, and possibly the best world ever created to challenge all our beliefs about what is real and important in our lives.  Master world building at its best.
B0052WKZZ6|5.0|I purchased two years ago \\"Oldfields\\" Incantations album performed live in Germany. This live album is totally beyond fantastic / great. A must hear for anyone who likes/loves this album. Performed live in 1975 with full orchestra. Gnarly
B004ADH1RI|5.0|we watch the goodies every time it's on. it's a classic fun movie. we can't wait to watch it with our kids some day.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The witty writing and intense situations make this show amazing. If you haven't started watching this show for some reason, I would recommend that you start from the beginning.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Waah Matthews dead, not a happy camper, I guess it will go on but I'm getting tired of it !
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The witty writing and intense situations make this show amazing. If you haven't started watching this show for some reason, I would recommend that you start from the beginning.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I viewed this after seeing Red 2, which was the best movie of the season for me, and I had to see Red. I wasn't disappointed, and how could I be with actors like parker, malkovich, Willis, and my all time favorite, Helen Mirren. This was even better than Red 2...great writing, many zingers, lots of action, and wonderful chemistry between Willis, Freeman and Parker. The plot was actually very good, based on actual cold war events that few will recognize.
B006S01GH2|5.0|Happy endings are my favorites, a love story with quirky misfits that have creative touches and little surprises to enjoy throughout
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series.  Always keeps me on my toes.  It has also got good English humor in it.  The characters are just perfect in their roles and play them well.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Zombies are not my thing. I don't squee every time I find a decent novel about them nor do I queue to see the horror films about them. Slow-moving rotting flesh in a romance plot is definitely not my thing either.<br /><br />So it's a good thing that this book isn't about zombies at all.<br /><br />Excuse me what? You splutter.<br /><br />Yes, you read that right, World War Z isn't really about zombies. It's about the world and people in it, namely Americans. No, the citizens of the United States of America would be more accurate. This is an American novel about Americans today, or rather about U.S. and its inhabitants seven or ten years ago. Things don't change that much in a decade though, so it still applies.<br /><br />The slow-moving rotting flesh is just an ugly mirror that produces a surprisingly clear image. It allows the characters to look back and explain in gory detail who they were before the Great Panic and how they've changed for the better. It allows a suburban mom to explain how she viewed some latinos clean and rational opposed to all the rest. It allows a child who grew up during the ten year zombie war to explain how her materialistic priorities have changed. It allows a jaded young man to explain how he learned to appreciate an outdated institution or how another like him found value in real life as opposed to the cyber reality he'd been hiding in. It allows the foot soldiers to explore in depth how rigid command structures can be a hindrance before they learn to adapt and become a strength.<br /><br />And that same distorted mirror allows the reader see what the characters themselves fail to understand: How a victory and change can make some things worse even when it fixes other problems. It allows the author to outsource his and the nations greatest fears to other faraway places that they've always been afraid of. Or how else do you interpret what Russia becomes after the war?<br /><br />Brooks takes the reader around world, China, South Africa, a few places in Europe, Australia, Canada, and allows those countries to take responsibility for some of the atrocities and failures that end up dooming and saving the world. Setting it all up in the U.S. would have ignored the realities of travel in the modern world and it would have made the story near claustrophobic. It's a funny word to use in this context but it applies. The bigger the picture Brooks paints the more specific the message and the intended audience are.<br /><br />Usually, I detest first person voice storytelling and a step below that are the stories with multiple first person voices mixed in together. Usually. But here it works. Brooks couldn't possibly make each and every voice distinct enough to stand on their own, but he litters just enough specialised vocabulary to make it palatable. The format does the rest. Because each and every character is telling their part in a larger story, their voices can't stand out too much. The story needs to be cohesive for the message to get through:<br /><br />The more things change, the more they stay the same. Even through a zombie apocalypse.
B003DZX3SA|4.0|Since the Disney vault seems to be closed to getting a copy of this, we wanted to share this with our 4 year old daughter, who loved the movie. This was the only place to find the DVD at this time.  Thanks for helping us to share a Disney experience with her!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|the more you play it the more interesting it gets. this is a great game for the young or old.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|We chose this rating because after growing up with the better innocent tales which Disney created, we were so pleased to share this with our 4 year old daughter.  Think that some of Disney's newer material/films have lost their innocence of appealing to the minds and hearts of children, and yet this film stands alone with some of the better original films produced by Disney.  These appeal much more to the imagination and fantasies of childhood years and feel it's so important to let our youth have just that - their youth!<br />Since the Disney vault only releases some of the older movies from time to time, we felt fortunate to be able to obtain a copy from Micah at Eastcoasthollywood to share with our family.  She made sure that we were satisfied with the movie and that it was delivered ontime.  Thanks Micah....you helped make a little girl's dream come true!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is just like temple run but it's not way cooler with the rockets. I love this game so cool
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good graphics. A little too slow getting ahead. I wish there were faster ways to restore energy with out using cash.
0307271080|5.0|I typically only read non-fiction, but decided to pick this up.  It is one of the best fiction stories I have ever read.  A beautiful love story reminiscent of a Hemmingway novel.  Really loved it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this game is great I love it you earn bling easily and kibble a totally awesome game not even one flaw
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Could be improved with a bit more lighting.  If energizing my imagination was the intent, it worked.<br />supered  lyrics would have helped follow the story line.<br /><br />However, I have never had a movie move me so except &#34;The Passion&#34;.<br /><br />Left me crying out to Almighty God, Why must we have such misery? Why must we do this to ourselves?<br /><br />At 91, I still do not have the answer except that it rests with HIM.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Awesome book!  Thank you Marcus for telling the story.  The book makes you laugh and cry and will keep you wanting more.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Funny, wise, modern language... I really enjoy it... kindle, beach, sun is everything you need... If you like books that you can't leave it till the end.. This is the book for you!!!
B0029EDMEG|5.0|I'm a Tom Selleck fan! so anything he's in I like.  Night Passage is written very well, and I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes mysteries.
B00821OX98|5.0|I don't have much free time so I am very selective about what shows I invest in.  This one has been worth it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great!  My entire family was playing, including our six year old!  Good challenge, some levels more than others,  We played for hrs, can't wait for more levels!
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|I purchased this app for my 4 yr old granddaughter.  She quickly learned its various features and had so much fun cutting and coloring the hair.  Occasionally we had problems with it freezing up, but overall it's a lot of fun.
B009G41CG2|4.0|I did not play this yet but if it is like the rest of the Mahjong I will like it and recommend it for people to buy.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|I've read quite a lot of David Sedaris' works, so when I bought the Kindle version of this book and breezed through it on a round trip flight, I wasn't disappointed. The book is hilarious and exactly what you'd expect from David Sedaris. The only thing that might beat is is an audio book read by Sedaris himself.<br /><br />If you like humor, memoirs, short stories, France or dysfunctional families, this one's for you.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I think this game is really great .It keeps you trying to be faster to bet your last game. I would recommend it to people to buy and play.
B00CBXV96I|5.0|So many times the cross over from book to screen is a horrific failure. The writing, the character development, the camera angles, the mood are all wrong - it's as if the director had never read the book!  Most  importantly the intimate connection between the story and the reader (viewer) is completely ignored by the production - an element in some books that is essential to the impact of the story on the reader.<br /><br />Hannibal is none of these things. It is quiet clear to me the director not only has read the books but laments over the characters as so many of us do. I was so hesitant to watch this show as I fell in love with the books and characters over 20 years ago - it gives me great pains to see a slop job of it done (e.g. Hannibal the movie).  It is evidenced by the quiet, surreal, creative, and cerebral way the director approaches this show that he too worships at the feet of Thomas Harris (book author). Bravo, NBC for staying true to the author's characters & overall mood of the books and loving them enough to pay attention to the details that breathe them to life!!  I whole-hearted thanks from a long-time fan!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game but my Granddaughter is really going to love it because she loves horse and you can do things with this game. I would recommend it to people.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an amazing book!The writer puts a lot of feelings into the characters and there is a surprise at every turn!!!
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|I have not played this game yet myself but a lot of people I talk to say this is a fun game so I would recommend for people to try it.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|The cast, the director, the music, the story...everything about this movie filled my heart.  It's the kind of story that makes you think about your life and life choices as you watch it. The drama is subtle but the depth of the characters' speaks volumes. If you rarely wait to read the credits at the end of a movie, you'll want to hang in for these. They are an added treat!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this game is fun to play.I would tell people to try it.I only played this for a short time but I like it and I think other people might find it fun.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|It's a little overblown but fun to watch.  They need to cut back on the blood, grunting and slo-mo violence.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|lots of fun; a challange for anybody my grandson love so I gave it a try now I'm hooked. hint...... leave nothing unnoticed and piece of paper ready
B005S9EJ14|2.0|I was excited about this movie when I saw the high ratings it got and noted the star-studded cast that it boasted.  I was surprised I had never heard of it before.  I ordered the movie and watched it when it arrived and it was okay, but I can see why it never really reached great heights.<br /><br />The general premise was good, but I was a little disappointed that the biggest message of the movie seemed to be, not simply overcoming difficulties and thriving in a hard situation (which is the way the film advertises itself), but instead that true happiness is found from casting off rules and expectations.  Many of the moral dilemmas of the film were, I felt, resolved in the wrong direction.<br /><br />I suppose \\"to each his own\\" when it comes to moral interpretations, but I also felt like the acting was just a bit hollow.  Judi Dench does very well for about the first half of the film, and after that I really struggled to understand what she was doing and what the significance of her character was.  Nighy does a fair but not amazing job, and so do several of the others.  Maggie Smith does a good job pretty consistently through the film, but even the epiphany of her character seems just a bit under-developed.<br /><br />The film has some pretty good moments -- some genuine good humor and a few poignant lessons (\\"Everything will turn out okay in the end.  So if things aren't okay, it must not be the end.\\").  On the whole, though, I still came away from it predominantly disappointed.  It was a movie with a lot of potential that took a few wrong turns.  I don't intend to watch it again, and I honestly can't really recommend it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Get this game NOW, it is so much fun. Easy controls and simple gameplay. Also a lot of upgrades. You need this on your device.

0525478817|5.0|My daughter recommended this and I didn't get to it right away, but once I started it, I spent an entire day reading and didn't go to bed until I was done. I can't explain more except to say that it is sad and beautiful and deeply moving in a way I never expected.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was great.  Although I'm new to these games I love puzzles and finding things and this was intriguing also.  Kept my interest, l played it late into the night.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is actual fringe science. Who other than corporate government has the time and money to do the research needed to make these abilityies viable.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is by far the best escape game I've played.  It's not so difficult that you have to give up after a level or two, but definitely challenging enough to make it fun.  I'll admit there were a couple times I thought it was impossible, but if you use your brain, you'll figure it out eventually!!  Love it, can't wait for more!!!!
0143039431|5.0|Easy to read paperback.<br /><br />Stienbeck was a master.<br /><br />His writing style kept me thinking.<br /><br />This book is a must read about struggling to survive in the 1930's, although the ending is a little odd-
B000068FWC|5.0|This Supertramp is Supertramp at their best, with their witty, clever lyrics and great melodies. I would highly recommend purchasing this CD and collecting them all since they are a truly unique and talented band!
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I found this book to be very repetitive and unrealistic.  Bow and arrow in the nuclear age?  Be serious!  How about a 16, 17 year old boy sleeping at night with a beautiful girl and nothing.  How unrealistic is that.  Particularly since they both may be dead the next day.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Michael was an extremely talented artist. Like Whitney, he abused his body until the end. It is a shame. He was a unique artist and I grew up to his music. He will not be easily replaced. This is an excellent CD. He was a once-in a lifetime entertainer! I highly recommend his music!.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Loving it already just downloaded cause mi from have it on her phone.this is really great can't stop playing it thanks
B002YIHO7I|5.0|This is an excellent SADE CD. She has a unique sound. Those pleasant lyrics and nice melodies are a pleasure to listen to. I would highly recommend this CD!
B000FC1GJW|5.0|This book was quite the ending to the trilogy. I really dig Philip Pullman's writing style that stands out through all three books and the way he pulled together epic fantasy, thought out facts (constellations/quantum entanglement...), corporeal souls/subconscious, romance (though I don't really jibe with it), and religion. In fact I envisoined almost everything that I read in the trilogy. The idea of dæmons struck a chord (there are web communities based on the idea. Look them up).<br /><br />Mega spoiler:<br />Aside from that it I really didn't understand why Will and Lyra had to fall in love. I liked the relationship as it was. This made for an unpleasant ending (Though I did like how Will met his soul/subconscious), and then I took the star down.<br /><br />Edit: Three years later I still remember almost all the character's and ideas. I am a big fan of Philip Pullman's writing style.
B000002GVO|5.0|This is one of the best &#34;CD&#34;.s. I grew up to the Eagle's music and they were a very talented band. Every track is a hit on this CD. I highly recommend it!

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very challenging. A must have for all game lovers.<br />Addicting and the game is very challenging. The little minions make it fun and very entertaining. Hard to put the game down.
B0000028VT|5.0|Another show of her talent. Mariah is definitely talented. She does not have to flaunt anything in order to sell CD's. Her fans are steadfast. I would highly recommend this CD. Excellent voice and beautiful melodies.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|This book had a great story line. I could have easily read it in one sitting, but life goes whether you are reading a good book or not. I hope there is a sequel.
B000002H5I|5.0|Who could ask for a better and more complete artist with outstanding talent. Tracy is here at her best. This CD foretells all the talent and all the other CD's that are to follow. I would recommend buying all her CD's. She is truly an outstanding artist!
B00111YM5G|5.0|I primarily bought this movie because i'm a big fan of the late actor Andy Whitfield, but also loved various other aspects , other actors & storyline. I'm a big fan of Angel movies, &#34;Fallen&#34; & otherwise...One of the top films in this genre
B00004S35Z|5.0|Some excellent Stevie Wonder melodies. He is truly a Wonder an extremely talented. Each track is a pleasure to listen to. I would highly recommend it!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This is a good alternative to play when the game is not possible. I wish the social networking portion of the game worked better.

B0059WTMLW|5.0|Many levels of difficulty. Many varieties. Several levels of hints that will teach solving techniques. Can't imagine how it could be better.<br /><br />+adding after 4 months:<br /><br />The info on the Amazon website page is extensive, and well worth reading to make an informed decision, beyond the overview in the App store.<br /><br />This is an incredibly well done app and easily worth far more than the $1.99 it's listed at today.  I have now moved up from Easy, through Moderate, Advanced, and Hard to Very Hard (with a couple yet to go).  I have just begun to use the provided coloring functionality, which is very well done, too.<br /><br />The coolest thing about this app is that if you use the Hint function it will teach you how to solve using different techniques, and provides first a look here, then a see these numbers and then a this is what with an explanation.  The plus adds to the current hint, the arrow goes to a different hint.  When I first got this app, I spent some time having my mind amazed and by choosing Nightmare and stepping through the various hints and trying to follow the logical explanations.  I concluded that I should start from my 'beginning' and learn from there, but knowing I had much to look forward to.  This was wise.  Now I know what an X-wing is and can usually spot one on my own; a month back I had to let the hints highlight and explain them.<br /><br />As I allow that I have more to learn, then it's OK if I choose a difficulty a bit beyond my skills and then use the hints if I get stuck, and thereby learn a new solving technique.  I also like using the hints when I find my mind is dull and I just want to get to an easier stage and veg out a bit.  I have all the control anyone could wish about what level of help I desire, from pencil marks (prefilled, filled on demand, or not) and number highlights (marks, full squares, none) and wrong move alerts or not, to check for conflicts or for errors, to Analyze which will alert to errors, if any, then tell which techniques can be useful for solving, all before I even ask for a hint.  The hints give the user a lot of control over how much to tell one, too.<br /><br />Today I learned there is a bookmark feature that lets one work ahead to test a solution and then go right back to the marked state instead of backing up one undo at a time.  I bet there's yet more I haven't yet found.any, then tell which techniques can be useful for solving, all before I even ask for a hint.

B000001EGA|5.0|I highly recommend Elton John's music. He is a talented, timeless artist, and we are very happy to still have him. He keeps producing excellent music!. I would highly recommend his CD's and his music!

B000002VMH|5.0|This is one of her best CD's. Annie Lennox serves some terrific vocals and she is truly outstanding in this CD. I would highly recommend all her CD's and to collect them all as she is an extremely talented artist!
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|I can't say enough about this book!  The narration by Rosemary that slowly reveals the story of what happened to her sister, Fern, and mixes the humor of wacky events of her college days and thoughtful musings on our relations with animals, is incredibly well written.  One of the best books I've read.
B000002KGT|5.0|Some timeless, ageless, Fleetwood Mac music. This is great music that can be enjoyed while sitting back and relaxing. Fleetwood Mac is at their best. Memorable lyrics, and mood creating songs. I would highly recommend this collection!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very smooth play. Addictive. No crashes, but ads are annoying. Darn Good free app in any case. Must be logged in to app store to play.
B0000025R3|5.0|This is an excellent, timeless CD and timeless music. Men at Work had some very talented performers and musicians. I would highly recommend this CD!
B0013HYLT0|5.0|This was a beautiful collection of songs I remember well from my childhood. Some of the songs like Dick Van Dyke singing &#34;Step in Time&#34; while dancing with the chimney sweeps was a longer version than the original 1964 version.
B000005RS0|5.0|This is one of Tina's Best CD's. She is truly outstanding in these heart-felt vocals. She is truly outstanding and memorable in her interpretations. Excellent lyrics... I highly recommend this CD.

B00004SZWD|5.0|Stevie is a genius. This music collection shows why. Every tune has memorable lyrics and memorable melodies. Stevie outdoes himself track after track. I would highly recommend this CD and all his &#34;CD&#34;'.s Stevie is a true genius and I wish him a long life! We are lucky to still have Stevie!
1608871819|5.0|This big, beautiful book is the coffee-table book for all who love the latest interpretation of The &#34;Man of Steel.&#34;  The preliminary artwork by the production designer is spell-binding.  To see it realized by the set designers and matte artists gives you a glimpse into the scope of making worlds come to life.  You'll need some of this &#34;behind the scenes&#34; knowledge to impress your friends.  It also comes in handy as a true test of your soul-mates ability to tolerate some of your preferences.  Wonderful.
B000005J56|5.0|This is some quality, timeless, and terrific outstanding music. You cannot find this music anywhere else. They are very talented artists who are expert in their trade. I would highly recommend this CD and the Buena Vista Social Club series!
B000FC2KL0|2.0|I enjoyed this book a little, but I thought some parts could be boring. It took me almost two months to get through this book. Kiedis does have a great sense of humor in his writing, though.
B000BGR0OM|5.0|This is an excellent collection of Eurythmics music with excellent tracks. Annie Lennox and her partner, at their best. I would highly recommend this collection.
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|I am so glad I rented this before I bought it. I love fantasy movies and the OZ stories are a favorite of mine. This movie has nothing to do with the OZ  stories.<br />They tried to bring in memories from the 1939 movie and that was pointless. They did nothing for this \\"story-less\\" story- except remind you of the wonderful classic and how awful this one was.<br /><br />For a sequel see the 1985 Disney movie \\"Return To Oz\\". It was a wonderful movie, with a great feel for the stories of OZ. The special effects, costuming and story were outstanding - there was true MAGIC in that version. In this one I felt nothing, nothing for the characters and nothing for OZ itself. Too much of it was CG, which made it cold and impersonal.<br /><br />RENT BEFORE YOU BUY.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This was an excellently produced CD and Mariah is terrific here. She also has an excellent production supporting cast. She could not lose in this CD.
B006QKJQ12|5.0|Panda once again entertains the whole crew! Good versus evil. Redemption. The strength of family. If you haven't seen Panda 1 and 2, they are a must see.
B000002LOE|5.0|This is one of the best CD's. The music is catchy and inspiring. The melodies are memorable and pleasant. I would highly recommend this CD and all REM &#34;CD&#34;'s. They are very talented and have some excellent music!
B004EF65QA|5.0|My friend introduced this to me. It is a movie I like to rewatch. Richard Armitage is wonderful in this movie. It is a great classic.
B00005AXEL|5.0|If you appreciate Stevie's raspy delivery you will like this CD. She delivers these nice melodies in her specialized manner. It is a pleasure to listen you. I would highly recommend this CD!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|This was a fun film, great special effects. It wasn't a life-changing film, or deep in any way. But a light, film to watch.
B00005QGAV|5.0|Michael was an extremely talented artist. Like Whitney, he abused his body until the end. It is a shame. He was a unique artist and I grew up to his music. He will not be easily replaced. This is an excellent CD. He was a once-in a lifetime entertainer! I highly recommend his music!.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Another great book from this series.Can't put them down.It's awesome.I tell everyone to read these and to watch the show!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|After much research I decided to buy this charger because of its versatility (letting me charge both an Apple device as well as an Android one) and powerful charging capacity (the fastest on the market as far as I know).  I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and I'm very happy with this purchase. My iphone 4S charges super fast as I'm driving, so I never have to worry that by using it as a GPS I'll kill the battery. The device itself is small and has a minimalistic design, which is great! Would easily recommend to anyone looking for a car charger!<br /><br />Off topic, but a word of advice to anyone using a car charger: before you turn off your car, disconnect the charger from your car's power port. If you leave it connected it will drain your car's battery.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I haven't had this that long but it is fun. I love the fact it has minions. And its not to hard to play.

B002OMZTSK|5.0|This is a really inspiring book for gay teens. It is full of humor and very realistic. It has inspired a movie by the same name which is also good but deviates a lot from the book. I have also read others in the series and recommend them as well.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I'm tickled with this app. Now I can access my Kindle books on my lunch break without having to carry both phone and Kindle! This is great! Thanks.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book, very well written and I Couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the next one. Love it!
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|I had no idea what this movie was about, but I was willing to give it a try based on the cast. This was a great movie and a change of pace for the traditional Tom Cruise character. But it works. Now I'm learning there are a whole series of Jack Reacher books. I can see Tom Cruise producing a string of movies based on this character. He can't keep doing Mission Impossible forever.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|Reads well, literal but not awkward. Study notes are great with additional articles that are thorough and educational. You will profit from it.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|.... but for this one, I was pleasantly surprised that the movie did the book justice and it led me to want to read the next two books in the trilogy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves this game, and it is a good introduction to the PC game for the younger set. Kids that are into Legos would really like this game.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|He goes on and on about climbing up and down stairs.  He develops the characters in detail but the plot is beyond comprehension..  If you suffer from insomnia, this book's boredom will cure it!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I always get really nervous when I download something that takes the same amount of time to download as it would take me to write a term paper. I never installed it. I'll just play this on my PC.
B003B02PF4|5.0|The story line keeps you guessing and your attention.  Easy to read and interesting areas to visit on this journey.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I'll never understand how an author can create a whole world and write thousands of pages while keeping it fresh and revealing new things all along the journey but Mr. Martin does it well.  I am looking forward to book 6 in the series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really enjoy the historical perspective this drama has to offer.  Maggie Smith is one of my favorite actresses. .
B0088TG252|3.0|I will see anything with Denzel in it but they can't all be winners.  This movie is just so so with some good action scenes.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I like this guy's style. I like his premise. I like his facebook pitches. I have a feeling I'd like hanging out with Hugh over a beer or two. And this book? Solid writing with an interesting dystopian treatment. Nice.
B007X15GRQ|3.0|he's not really a bad guy.  He's just doing what he has to do to get by.  So what if it isn't legal?
0307951529|4.0|This is a good book. Not ground-breaking, or uber-motivational, but a good solid treaty on starting your own company. I would suggest it for your entrepreneur types. You won't be disappointed. Why the 4 and not 5? It felt a wee bit &#34;rehashed&#34; at times; borrowing from others.

B003VANOFY|5.0|The best headset I have used so far. Very comfortable and charges last about 10 hours per use, runs low you can charge while playing. Well worth the investment.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|The explanation on the app store page made sense and the game seem entertaining for a mystery buff like me. However, after I located the first clue in room one I was stuck. Done. No direction no more clues. Nothing. This app has already been deleted.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Good argument, great acting and in my point of view a different approach to all other lawyer shows. I really enjoyed and recomend watching.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Still some really good writing here. Almost a shame to compare it against his previous books but the story here is very good. Somewhere between Graveyard and Anansi Boys, the story has his dark, folk mythology tied up into interesting characters and as in all his books the end twists a little and you are glad for that
B0028AQLYE|4.0|This really reduces the airflow. I bought this so I didn't have to keep clearing my snorkel after a flip turn. The product description kind mentioned that it also increased the breathing resistance, but a snorkel does generally anyway. This really reduced it! The first time I used it, I was already winded to start, and had to knock the snorkel out of my mouth to complete the set. I think it reduces the airflow at least by half. I'll continue to work with it, but ...Wow!
B002HWRYJE|1.0|this movie has no message its only focused on action if they were smart they would have made the prequel to this movie instead of this star trek countdown does deserve the title star trek but this movie it just a lazy action movie and it does not feel like a star trek movie at all the only good actors in this are not used well either karl urban and simone pegg are used poorly and this movie was a waste of time and space to make heck the nero book that takes place during this movie should have been made into a movie as well their is lots of stuff in this movie left unexplained this movie stinks i know im more of a star wars fan than star trek fan but my god this movie is terribly made and the director only focuses on action not story and the movie has no meaning or even a message in it thats how terrible it is
B00190N4E4|5.0|I've seen this movie several times over the years and pick up nuances each time I watch again, due to further experiences in my own life. Epic film making and performances throughout. Gandhi was an enlightened man, and Ben Kingsley must have been also, to channel him so brilliantly. A long movie but definitely recommend viewing, multiple times.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|what the heck was wrong with the old version? the new version doesnt have half the things the old version did and its slower. it doesnt even work anymore.
B004UPANGM|4.0|Super cheesy but really fun. I love bruce cambell. He is hilarious. All of the evil dead movies are are good.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I really liked this book it was awesome.  Please read it. :)  If you like adventure and if you like suspense.  :) ;) :p
B009NY43NY|3.0|This book proved to be a fitting close to sookies adventures. Harris did not load it with explosives, or bog it with sentimentality, but did neatly tie up all the loose ends. An easy read with enough action to keep it interesting.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|With the exception of a few details, this is Christian Grey and Ana Steele all over again...not impressed...<br />Also I hated that they were solving all their issues with sex. I mean, it's okay to be fiercely attracted to one another but they has some serious issues and instead working them out they'd just jump each other's bones. I know it's a book that really got under my skin. One another note, I will be a hypocrite and admit that I will be reading the next book only because I would like to see what is going to happen with these two...<br />You won't be blown away but I will not discourage you from indulging...just see if you can borrow it first...
B0089EHWQE|5.0|story keeps rolling along. found myself right in the book with the characters. wonderful writing and I will definitely pursue this author's other books.
B000SVZIOE|4.0|This is a good movie for children.  No bad words or adult habits in movie. Very funny.  You can watch it over and over. Good movie.
B008JFUO72|4.0|I am an Iron Man fan, loved the first two movies. I think that Robert Downey Junior nails the part perfectly. He did a great job on this one. But, the writing, script etc was a bit confusing. Not to mention that I remember from the comic books a guy named Mandarin who was an actual guy who wanted world domination etc. This story deviated from that whole scenario quite a bit. ***Spoiler Alert the whole Mandarin as a actor/fool just took something away from the Iron Man storyline, and to be honest I found it confusing. Why not let Mandarin be Mandarin. Why did they need another person who hid behind his persona? There was no need for that unless they were looking for filler. There is a great but unrealistic connection with a little boy whose' garage Tony Stark ends up in. And, how is it he had to drag the iron man costume around. I remember the costume used to fold up into a briefcase. There were way too many conflicting pieces to this Iron Man. Conflicting in the sense that they conflicted with the comic book version that I remembered. When Iron Man landed on the ground in the ice and snow, his suit began to fail. Ok, he got out. Then the suit should have folded up into a neat compact suit that could be carried. Perhaps because this was an experimental suit, maybe I could buy that. Then there was the scene where he saves something like 17 people who are blown out of an airplane, very unrealistic, but hey it's a comic book movie, I'll accept it. That is, until the train shatters his suit and we find out. . . HE WASN'T IN IN IT!!!!!  Talk about confusing and misleading. There were many other plot holes. What does picking up that little tiny piece at the end really symbolize, certainly not what I think it was supposed to. (Have to watch the movie to find out that spoiler).  **** End Spoiler Alert.  All in all I will buy this one when it comes out, only because I want to see it again. That and I own every Marvel Movie that has been put out, so why not this one too? Should you buy it, I think there is enough fun in this one that justifies buying it when it comes down to about $5 or maybe as part of a multi-pack unless you have the others already like I do.<br /><br />Ralph J. Fitcher
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Realistic  characters ,  intriguing  characters, you really  feel and  live  the  thread of the  story, and  wish  to  be  there  or  not  there  . . . as the  case  may  be .
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I have enjoyed another of his work!  His story brings Vonnegut to mind, but with his own style.  Highly recommended!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The Weather Channel app used to be easy to use and view while providing you with multiple choices and clear results. After the recent redesign, it is the complete opposite. It's messy, cumbersome, confusing and sluggish. I tried it for a week or so, but still have nothing positive to say. Looks like I'll be deleting this app and looking for an alternative.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Good  read, can't wait to read the other Pride books about the other members of this very close, caring and loving family.
B002XWXPC8|5.0|Just a fun baseball comedy that does not take itself too seriously.  Great cast, well paced, well written.  R rated for the language.
B003RRY60S|5.0|Nice plot, loved also the humor of this book. I enjoyed the setting in ancient Rome a lot ;) Worth reading :)
B008Y2X78S|5.0|The series is great drama. I don't know how accurate the history is but the story is just engrossing. I watched a couple of episodes on the Comcast site and the video didn't stream as well. Same computer, the Amazon purchase proceeded without interruption. I also love watching TV series by binge. I buy the season and watch several episodes per sitting. Not waiting, not anticipating, is what I like.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Didn't want the game to end. It was very entertaining and kept me interested in wanting to figure out how to escape. :)
B00BC24NT4|3.0|I wasn't as impressed with this book as I thought I would be.  It seemed rather one dimensional and not as fully developed as some of his others.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I enjoyed reading this story. The story line was well written and kept the mind wondering what was around the next page.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|Just your average horror movie with lots of gore, some of which I had to cover my eyes for. This version has no personality so it just goes through the story and you really don't care about anyone. It is over real quick which is a good thing.
B000007UTN|4.0|A really good disc, with a nice mastering. Unfortunately, discs do not fit well in the sleeves... It is a bit regrettable
1743117094|3.0|It flowed, it dragged, it got confusing, but overall it was a good book.  Will it be a book I know lines of and can't wait to read again, no.
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|Loved this when I was young and my kids loved watching it now.  Still a good family movie to watch.
B002SAUCBC|4.0|This is a one- of- a- kind narrative that haunts you as you trudge down a never-ending road! The agony of the walkers is made so real that you become one with Ray Garrity and can feel each step on his journey into oblivion! A &#34;must&#34; read of King's uncanny ability to make you feel that you are part of 'The Long Walk' ! V. Taylor
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This is such a funny book. Love it!!!!! It is the best book ever. Make a lot more. Go Jeff!
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Awesome game on the Kindle, The best I've ever downloaded. Same as the play station two , hours of entertainment.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Awesome as usual without the hang ups of other free APS. Simple yet challenging as would be expected from all Rovio products.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|I bought it to read on the plane to London because I had a ticket to see the stage version. A totally original voice, and one that really allows those of us with no experience of people on the Asperger's spectrum a view into what their lives and thought processes are like. By the way, if they ever show the Live in HD National Theater production again, it was brilliant too.
B00005JLRT|4.0|this is the last of the star trek movies so far and it is great - just doesn't quite have the ambiance of the first ten movies made
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is a romance yet it's also a peek into the thoughts of teens diagnosed with different forms of cancer. Makes you realize just how \\"normal\\" we are...even with a life shortening illness.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|This is when Lindsay Lohan first started her acting career - and what a great job.  Too bad she grew up and got into mischief.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|...to keep it entertaining. I only have one recommendation for developers of this game: Hurry up with more rooms from which to escape!
B003BWERF8|4.0|In general it works very well and it pairs with my LG wireless headset automatically without using codes (I would have no idea how to &#34;enter&#34; them into my iPod nano or the headset).<br /><br />While swing my arms on an elliptical it does seem to cut in and out sometimes...
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Had to reattach my stock filter but this is what people have told me to go and look for. Shipping was fine and the product works. And I found out the problem was my heat sink. I would come back to this product if I decide to upgrade. Also, there is enough for many placements so you won't have to worry about buying a new tube after a mistake.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really had fun playing this game and I can't wait until more games are added. This game really makes you use your brain.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Please fix tye 11kb glitch. I have trouble shot my phone to the ends of the earth and I still get &quot;completed videos&quot; @ 11kb!
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|The book is a rather depressing read. I would still very much recommend it. When I got involved in the whole situation I reacted emotionally to the main character's choices. I believe, though, that her reactions are exaggerated and that she simply wasn't ready to have a child. The way she describes the viciousness of a new-born is surprising and hardly credible. Besides, she as an adult and she understands more than a small child... The whole story is definitely not something you will forget easily.
B003RNZFRK|5.0|You'll think it's a great album if you think it's a great band. I like them for the variety, each song is good in its own way instead of all being the same song with different lyrics.
B00CIU3IVS|4.0|I haven't seen the movie yet (I know) but I was really quite eager to get my hands on the soundtrack because it seemed so ... at odds with what I expected a Gatsby movie to be.<br /><br />Most of us have read through the classic at least once in high school, I gather, and it was interesting to see just how many of the artists on this album blend together the music of the now with that of the glittering Art Deco era. I do understand that Baz Luhrmann was deliberate in his musical choices, to do a blend of then and now, to add to the feeling of the movie, to draw today's audiences into that era. And the music does that.<br /><br />I do like that the artists are so varied: From Jay-Z to Gotye, Florence + The Machine to Nero. It's a fun album, definitely worth at least one listen through; more if you find yourself enchanted (as I did).
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book. Is what really goes on ,if you can handle military facts of life then give it a read this book is not for the week of heart
B002QRWJA4|4.0|Great acting, lovely singing, and captivating story. Gerard Butler played an awesome and passionate Phantom. Minnie Driver was hysterical as Carlotta. But I would have loved a little more from Emily Rossum and Patrick Wilson's characters. Overall, though, it was fantastic.
B000HL2J0G|4.0|Enjoyed it when I was younger and it was first on.  Still like it now.  Has the right combo of humor and drama to keep  you entertained.
B00933JL0A|5.0|I love this game! So addicting!<br />I just wish there were more building options! Big maps with all the same buildings can get dull. :0
B00AF7Z44K|5.0|I absolutely loved the whole series. It was quirky, funny, and enjoyable from beginning to end. By the time the 3rd season came around, the characters and their relationships were well established and made the show so much more fun to watch.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is fun and it does seem like an accurate economy and simulates how to use it and make it better as well as it seem real
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|for starters I love despicable me but this app is reeally bad seriously do not get this app if you like despicable me do not get it does not even work
B0081336FO|5.0|So well done, great acting, great writing, current but as quirky as the original Holmes. Well directed - few plot or scientific flaws - when I was told how good it was I didn't believe it. I was wrong. I'm now waiting for season 3 to air and become available. Oh... And the actors - now lead two of the biggest movies of 2013 - Star Trek and Hobbit. Not bad for a couple of small time Brit TV actors eh?
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I use this app all the time.  Highly recommend it for quick weather updates. Love the extended forecasts and current condition feature.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|Just like a couple of other apps I downloaded, this one is still somewhere in a cloud that I can't locate. It probably works ok, I just never got a chance to find out.
B0049U4INC|2.0|Stick with Dale Carnegie's How to Influence People and Win Friends, although this one is up to date with social media that didn't exist back in the (19)30's.
B001EBV0NU|5.0|I love this movie.  It would not play the voice track.  Desperate, I thought maybe it would work in some other language.  The defaulted option was music only.  I clicked on English and it plays beautifully.
B00CA3C1N4|1.0|I had this game for 2 days after getting it as the free app of the day. I kept trying it because I wanted to like it, but the AI is just unfair even on the beginner level. I've even tried looking up strategies or hints to possibly help me to no avail. The AI seems to have unlimited ships and always gets the special stars that give them bonuses, while I was stuck with the vortexes that would limit my ships sent. I would have 3/4 of the stars and be going in for one of the remaining few of the enemy's stars, only to see one of his pop up behind me, then the AI would just go around and completely wipe me out. Deleted quickly and very glad I didn't waste any money on this.
B008EKMB82|5.0|The footnotes were a problem on my Kindle Touch, but I pushed on without them.  If I had known about the footnotes, I would have bought the paper version.
1781162646|5.0|Brilliant and captivating writing. Stephen King is truly a master of his genre!  Can't put it down ( I read in two days).
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I bought this for my brother and he loved it and got us hooked!  Perfect for anyone who loves suspense and mystery.
B00BESIKWM|1.0|I am so thankful that I rented this movie instead of seeing it in the theatre, because I would've had to walk out on it.  The first Silent Hill movie wasn't great, so all I was hoping for was a decent movie.  All the tension that made the first film enjoyable is gone.  The mannequin-spider monster is creepy, but they overdid the CGI effects on it.  You feel no connection to any of the characters, there's a teenage love story going on, and the hell monsters can just hop into our dimension whenever it's dark.  Please don't waste your time.
B000V86OKG|5.0|I bought this for my brother and he loved it and got us hooked!  Perfect for anyone who loves suspense and mystery.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I have watched the HBO series, but the books help explain so much more.  Wonderful read! Highly recommend if you love the series.
B00CO8D3G4|2.0|I didn't finish the book because I'd soon had enough of the author talking about himself and all his accomplishments and all his problems.  Enough already.  I run into too may people like that in real life and don't need to read about it, too.  It's at least somewhat of an interesting life, though, hence the two starts.  Just stick to Seth Godin if you want to read motivation about &#34;choosing yourself.&#34;
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Interesting  refreshingly new ideas of story telling.  Hoping the follow up books are as adventurous entertaining and unique  a must read
B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|Totally entertaining for kids and adults.  This is a classic movie.  Definitely one to purchase for your library.  Pixar rocks!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Well put together. Love this game, it's addictive! It's so much fun to groom and fix the food for your horse. I love how you can compete and how you can do everything for your horse!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really love the new update on it where you can see the weather on your status bar in the top corner and it will alert you to all alerts so this is a great app to have I approve
B004GYY714|5.0|This is a great app, it is easy to use, the selection topics are plentiful and you can get many stations around the world.  As far as I can see there are no commercials which is great.  I would highly recommend this app to everyone.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun game so far.just got started playing but my daughter's been playing and she loves it.we will see how it goes and rate again later.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|His works are helping me to understand the culture of my grandson's heritage. I look forward to further publications soon.
B000IFQLSW|4.0|I like most of the songs. Kenny Wayne Shepherd has a voice that's kind ti the ears. Pretty much what I expected. A good listen.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|This game is like survivalcraft and is perfect for younger or newer people. If you have enough money to buy the game survivalcraft, i suggest you buy that instead. But if you don't then get this game. It is much like survivalcraft but you have a certain amount of worlds and time. Enjoy :)
0064431789|5.0|What could be a better combo than little grandsons and books about monsters? Another book in the frequent reader pil at our place.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game!  My 6 year old was even having fun!<br />This game kept us busy for hours!  Some levels were difficult, but love it and enjoy the challenge!
0802130208|5.0|I enjoyed this book. Too bad the author is no longer with us, I would have read more of his books.
0316067598|5.0|I'm not good at writing fancy reviews.  As a woman, I don't read war stories and I really didn't even know what a SEAL was until I read this book.  But Marcus Littrell is speaking in our town next month and I started researching who he was.  The next step was to read his book.  Well, I could not put it down.  I don't want to spoil any of the story, but just to say it was hard to believe.  I kept thinking it would make an incredible movie and sure enough, the movie is coming out in January, 2014, I believe.<br /><br />I've now ordered Marcus Luttrell's 2nd book and anxiously await it to arrive.  Hopefully I will also get to hear him speak when he comes to town next month.  Good read !!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Nice game and puzzle solving with mystery. Scenery and graphics set the mood well. Would be nice to have another made.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I was very happy that I could use Adobe Reader on my Kindle Fire.  I did not know if it would work because I had heard that Kindle did not support Adobe Reader but I have had no trouble with it.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|All planets should be unlocked at the beginning not after you completed the first planet, just like the other angry birds games.
B003JTHXN6|2.0|This is a sales pitch for Zappos, and it's irritating to me that I had to pay to get pitched to.  Much of it is reprinted emails.  Yuk.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is an awesome game and I'm totally addicted to it. The only thing I don't like about it is that everything takes a long time. Go DRAGONVALE!!!!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is much fun. It really makes you think. A brain teaser.  Wish there was more levels. Are they going to add more levels?
B00006RU5B|5.0|This was a replacement for me as I had lost the first one.  The disc was in perfect shape.  Great price, quickly delivered!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series gets better each year. The rich scenery and the fabulous characters make for an unforgettable story. And where did they find the cars??????
B004EPZ03O|4.0|The Muppets Movie is great fun for the whole family. Anyone young and old can appreciate this. Jason Segel is funny as ever. As someone who enjoyed the original Muppet Show, this is a great addition to the Muppet collection. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Charlotte Oliver<br />Clearwater FL
B005544TRQ|4.0|Very well written and well acted. The plot and the characters are interesting and you are looking forward to the next episode.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After hearing the author being interviewed on various aspects of his views of publishing and DRM in the digital age, I thought I would give his most popular series, to date, a go.  I was pleasantly surprised with a well paced and written story.  Hugh Howey is the real deal.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|Stargate Atlantis was such an amazing series and I wish it was being shown on tv  on a more regular basis.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Tons of fun, love the art work and the battle scenes. Kind of on the hard side if you don't spend money but doesn't decrease its awesomeness! Kudos to the makers
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have never played a better game in my life ever you need this game get it!!!! I still have a few words I have today which is why I am saying this
B009NY43NY|2.0|After many years enjoying the SVM, the best thing I can say about DEA is &#34;no comment&#34;. A polite Southern lady knows when to hold her tongue.
B00C7DGRL4|3.0|It is the type of movies that I like. SO it is a added movie to what I already have.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great t.v.!! British television at it's best!! Can't wait until next season to see what happens. Riveting! Keeps me glued to my iPhone.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I really enjoy relaxing with this game.  It is easy on the eyes with tiles that are easy to see and match.  I also like listening to the chimes.  The last part that I really like is the shuffle so that you can complete the game when needed.  Thank you for this game.  Look forward to many more games in the future.
B005MXQD5Q|5.0|Of course which DVDs are among the best depends on the music you prefer.<br />I know Leonard Cohen very well, but have none of his CDs in my vast collection.<br />Maybe I have heard his songs too often - sung both by him and so many others.<br />But this DVD brings together elements whose sum is vastly more than all of it parts.<br />First there is Cohen. Warm and humble and in great voice with perfect timing despite his 74 years.<br />Then there are the musicians, several of which play multiple instruments in the course of the concert.  And varied they are: the melodica, clarinet, sax and mouth harp by just one of them. Add to that an auto harp, Portuguese guitar, mandolin and an array of electric and acoustic gutiars and other instruments.<br />Thirdly, the three back up singers are sublime indeed.<br />Leonard's pleasure in their brilliance is palpable.<br />He is great at selecting great back up singers.  First Jennifer Wearnes, then Perl Batalia and Julia Stephenson and now the young Webb sisters and Leonard's collaborator in recent years Sharon Robinson. They elevate Leonard's baritone into a realm of complex polyphony worthy of the finest madrigals.<br />What a perfect complement Sharon is to the Webb sisters' ethereal harmonies, not to mention her own great solos.<br />And finally, the sound is great and the photography excellent and of high quality in my opinion considering it is filmed on a dark stage.<br />Most of all I like that the camera lingers not only on Leonard, but also on each of the musicians and especially the three back up singers.<br />You just don't see that on most concert DVDs.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|I am happy to get this cd.  Forty years or so old,...  The brilliance of the artists performance  (front line and back line of horns)is just standout amazing! Paul McCartney got a good pick with this band!  It took all of them to make it as good as it is! The song selection ,plus the acoustic segment especially breaks it all down;.. making the recording a must have for that era in Rock and Roll history  for sure. Open the door,and let em' in. Thank you,..Paul
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|are you still up this app I even bought the unlock her now I have to b with in wifi in order to use this app because it won't let me play a song plus I'm connected to be slipping amazon store. No goodfe
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Bought to movie, because my son wanted to see it.  It was okay, but not as good as I thought it would be.  The acting was good, the special effects were good, but some parts of the movie did not work for me.  It was more of writing problem than anything else.
B007KW5N9Y|1.0|Other than having what might possibly be the most thoroughly annoying boy protagonist in all cinema<br />(I kept hoping one of the Samurai would just gut him)...<br /><br />What a horrific trivialization and travesty of J.G. Ballard's story!<br />Whose central theme might have been the fragility and impermanence of what we take as bedrock: Human civilization.<br /><br />But this is the sort of schlock American audiences have been raised to gobble up at the movies.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a very fun movie with scenes that everyone enjoyed. Kids can't get enough of it, but it sure beats going to the movies.  At home it is so much cheaper and there is no drama and I don't have to worry about taking the kids to the bathroom every 30 minutes.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|App is average and not able to hold my 5 year old granddaughter's attention.  Would not recommend this app not worth the price and the add-ons.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|Kids got bored after about 30 minutes.  Not really worth the download. You can pet it and poke it and punch it and it responds.  That is about all it does.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Gets right into the action. Love the historical perspective and the research that is based on real fact and locations. Makes you believe there is still some mystery out there.
B004LROUW2|3.0|A perfect setting for what could have been a perfect fantasy story but the author missed the mark by adding needless information that did not move the story forward and redundant conversations.  At times i thought Tengo was missing a few marbles and was incapable of normal conversations.  Example in point,  Ari:  &#34;more than I can count on my fingers.&#34;  Tengo:  &#34;but, more than one?&#34; And another gem, Doctor:  &#34;your father is in a coma. &#34; Tengo:  &#34;You mean he is unconscious?&#34; This last one caused me to laugh out loud.<br /><br />I do admire the authors character development and his ability to describe to the reader his world of Air Chrysalis.  I could be persuaded to read another of his books for this fact alone.  Time will tell because I need a little time to heal so I myself will quit repeating people's statements and questions to me in my head. The author should have taken heed from his leading mans rewrite of Air Chrysalis...concise and to the point but chose to take a laborious route.<br /><br />Dear reader take heed and do not listen to this book, read it so you can skip the unneeded content. But do in fact read it for the authors imagination and rich characters.
B00919CI5Q|4.0|Maxes out all recent games combined with a fast processor ! Big card, make sure you have room in case.!
0060989157|5.0|This is hands down my favorite bio about a rock band. I was a huge fan growing up. Being 14 and seeing the incredible live show they put on for the support of Dr Feelgood is forever burned in my brain. Had a nice evening with a good lady friend and a perfect soundtrack provided by the Crue.<br /><br />From the opening sentence til the end this book keeps you captivated. I finished it pretty quickly not because it's a short book but because it's so good it was hard to put down. Tons of great stories from their finest decade which was the 80's. I am amazed they have all made it this far in life. Loved hearing the stories behind the albums. Found it shocking Nikki doesn't even hardly remember writing 2 of the albums only to have them go multi platinum regardless. It's all here from their triumphs to tragedies. I love hearing about the hedonistic rock n roll life. If there is any on aspect that bothers me about this book is these dummies fight like a bunch of sissies over the dumbest things quite often. There are a few downers here as it's not all good times. Vinces chapter about the loss of his daughter is heart breaking. As was John Corabis shot in the band, he got a pretty raw deal. And Mick Mars health struggles, I admire him most because while his disease has greatly effected him he has kept going back be damned. These are kept relatively brief and the rise and high times are the main focus of this book. It is fantastic, one of a kind. My only wish that I hope does happen in the future is an add on addendum to pick up where The Dirt left off. There is still a lot more story to tell from the Crue. I don't know what to say. If you haven't read it already do yourself a favor and go pick it up now. Highly recommended.
B007N85POS|3.0|Having lots of fun with this one. Some of the scenarios seem to be impossible to solve without additional help provide. Takes some time to find out when it is time to &#34;TNT&#34; or use other possibilities. It is free, so why worry.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book and hated to leave the characters when I was finished.  I could feel the human good gualities that exist in so many people.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Another predictable romance. A fun summer read.  Not spectacular.  Not fabulous. Just fun and enjoyable.  A great book to read on vacation
B005VPRFSY|5.0|Bought this for my cousin who's a huge star wars fan. The little lego characters are awesome and the price is very reasonable. He loved it.
B009ME47H2|5.0|So good. it is loud and works good your divice can be in sleep mode and it will still record.<br />I use mine to catch my sister .it's like a spy divice
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great story line, easy read. Not predictable and would make an awesome movie. I would recommend it to anyone. Read \\"Losing Hope\\" to follow.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Going from laughing to crying because of honesty is the constant power in this story. It's truth and raw sense of humor speak volumes and shows the author has faith in his reader. I am so happy to have read this book and cannot wait to share it with others.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I had thought this was going to be the finale to the series.  After waiting months and months after the second book I was so anxious to read this one, was very disappointed that it was not the conclusion and I would need to wait months and months again for the next book.  Although experiencing the heated, passionate,steamy,sizzling love and romance between Eva and Gideon is very erotic,exciting,and well written, this book seemed to drag on and on.  It was not as compelling as the first two.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the fast & furious movies. I'm not a big motorhead or racing fan, but this movie does it for me.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|I bought the Fire HD 32G mainly to watch catch up tv anywhere in the house, and on my lounge tv when I am settled in there. As we all know the Fire cannot run flash, but Dolphin can. I read a few guides on the web, and although initially confused by the OS as I had never used a tablet before, I soon figured it out. In simple terms:<br /><br />1. Change the settings so that you can download apps from other sources.<br />2. Download EsFile Manager. An apk file will be in your downloads folder.<br />3. Install it.<br />4. Download GoodEReader. An apk file will be in your downloads folder.<br />5. Install it.<br />6. Download Dolphin HD. An apk file will be in your downloads folder.<br />7. Install it.<br />8. Download Flash. An apk file will be in your downloads folder.<br />9. Install it.<br />10. Everything will now work.<br /><br />If you do not follow every one of these steps, nothing will work as you need to download and install the app each time.<br /><br />You can add an installed item to the carousel, using the normal methods.<br /><br />I use Duck Duck Go as my search engine within Dolphin and it works just fine.<br /><br />All catch up tv works just fine.<br /><br />You may find that switching off acceleration in the settings actually speeds up download times.<br /><br />Switch off sideloading when you have finished.
B00005R2IS|5.0|I actually bought this movie for my brother for his birthday. He's a huge fan of these movies. Their still great films though they're just not for me.
B009MCRHH6|1.0|I would have  enjoyed this game much more if there was any explanation of the game mechanics at all. Instead I am stuck with unpredictable behavior and many methods for solving the puzzles are only available with a google search. Especially if you tryto get the &quot;OCD&quot; achievements. Done with this game, don't buy it.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the fast & furious movies. I was never a motorhead or racing fan, but these films really get me going.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I love this book, it's very well written. I will probably read more of his books, Nicholas Sparks, that is.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I'm a huge fan of doctor who. When I saw these I had to get them. Unfortunately I got them for my brother instead of myself. I gave this to him for christmas. He almost had a heart attack.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|Great graphics.  .  It has its challenges.  But after a while you get tired of starting over when timer runs out
B004DMIIUU|5.0|I really liked the movie. It was extreme to watch & I'm glad that I found this moive when I did.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Another great chapter in Angry Birds. The beat goes on.<br /><br />Tons of fun for everyone.!<br /><br />Any and all Angry Birds fan!
B0001XAPY2|5.0|I'm a huge fan of this studio's work. The animation is awesome in this feature. You can't find an animation like this too often.
1594481717|5.0|This book is fantastic. Fresh insight that is mightily checking in and written in the style that a holistic mind enjoys and can relate to. Truly IMHO a must read for anyone coming into the next era.<br /><br />I found it interesting, as I perused some of the reviews that it seemed not surprising that some criticized the book for not giving enough solutions. As a mystery school teacher, I get this some times, and I'd have to say that Mr. Pink is a mystery teacher of the highest order. For it is by pointing and allowing those who are just absolutely crushed by their left brain faculties that we foster the opportunity for them to start exercising their innate, albeit atrophied curiosity and wonder, imagination and innovation, with something other than their thinking mind. So, of course. they might find some fault in a book which is urging them to open up to this very thing.<br /><br />The truth is that we, individually and collectively, are writing this story as a whole. And unless we get a whole new mind, we will remain divided, or get lost in a negative group mind. I loved the fact that Mr. Pink does not downplay the importance of either region of our brain, and acknowledges that he must speak more powerfully of the right brain activities because its time has come, and it has been taking such a backseat. The real beauty of it is that when we enter into those realms of thought and being, such as story... we create synergy.. or something greater than the sum of its parts. And that is where the magic lives and the ability to reveal and bring forth truly creative ideas, solutions and inventions.<br /><br />I can totally understand why some might have difficulty with these concepts. Perhaps those that do are the very ones that probably need to hear this message the most. However, the story behind the story is that perhaps most of all this book is a big thumbs up to the right-brainer who have been languishing like the Maytag man waiting for their time to come. What if both of us met in the middle? Ultimately, perhaps that is at the crux of this book... but it will take an out of the box solution and alot of heart to bridge that gap.... So perhaps it is the right-brainers that will rule the future, after all.of us met in the middle? Ultimately, perhaps that is at the crux of this book... but it will take an out of the box solution and alot of heart to bridge that gap.... So perhaps it is the right-brainers that will rule the future, after all.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|It's not the best structured book and running won't save the world as the author claims it would if everybody was doing it.<br /><br />I give it the highest rating nevertheless. It is a very inspiring book. It might even get a non running person into running. Me, being a runner myself, I loved it for the hilarity, the passion and the insights into human evolution.<br /><br />It is an easy read and even as a slow reader you will be through with it in a weeks time.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|If you are interested in Afganistan and Pakistan. This book holds you spellbound. Couldn't put it down once I started.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|I can't remember a single thing about this movie as I sit here to write this, so I think that pretty much sums up what I thought of it. It was hard to follow for most of it, I think. Not one part of the movie stands out to me. I usually remember movies I've watched very well.
0812983459|1.0|Best story I have read in a long time but first 30 pages fell out of book before I even began to read it.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Second best sitcom ever next to Seinfeld. I grew up with this show. Loved it. This is an amazing deal for the entire series on DVD. The only negative is the theme song couldn't be used, I guess the Sinatra estate wanted too much money.<br />Bundy! Bundy! Bundy!
B002W7J3SO|3.0|Unbelievable plot, unbelievable characters. Except for van Damme. I think I felt more sympathy for him than anyone else in the story. Some fun and interesting scenes. Nothing much to comment about otherwise. Certainly nothing to rave about.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Ive played off and on for years, now I can own a small collection and not have a big mess of physical cards.  I went ahead and bought the full version, cards are extremely cheap, well worth it!
B009MYARIK|2.0|I'm a huge Kinsella fan, and what I love about her novels is that you can re-read each ten times and they're never boring. Not this one. I was put off by how shallow, insipid and unlikable the two sisters were, and by the far-fetched plot that tried hard to be exciting and engaging but kept missing the mark.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I was really entertained by this movie and all actors were excellent.<br />There was nothing I disliked about this movie and would and have recommended to my family and friends.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Exceptional acting....makes one feel a definite part of the story...waiting for the continuation of the entire family...just wondering what characters will leave and the arrival of new ones.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|I chose this rating as I feel the movie had earned the praise.<br />I would recommend this movie to all my friends.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|We've seen a lot of Nam movies, most of them hard to follow and understand since we didn't experience the actual war. This one was easy to watch, easy to understand, funny, sad, captivating, and worth watching.
B002BY77CW|5.0|I love Lauren Conrad so I finally decided to start reading her books and I was not disappointed. I definitely recommend this!!!!
