B00BAVCD8A|5.0|It's different than other Fall Out Boy albums, but I still really enjoyed this one! I especially liked the songs, Phoenix and Young Volcanoes.

B009NY43NY|2.0|I think everyone who will be reading this book will have read all of the ones prior, so I don't think my review will really be \\"spoilers.\\"<br /><br />At the end of the previous book, I think we all knew what she was aiming for. Sookie doesn't want to be a vampire and Charlaine Harris has said that she will not make Sookie a vampire. So, we know her relationship with Eric won't last. But why did she make us love him? I know I am not the only fan who saw behind the mask of Eric, who saw his deep-rooted feelings for Sookie. We all knew she was going to end up with Sam, but Harris has done it in such an abrupt fashion that I was baffled. No more Sookie and Eric?<br /><br />The relationships Sookie has wasn't even the most baffling thing about the book. Charlaine has written all of her books from Sookie's point of view, but now she starts it off with random characters out of her knowledge. As is tradition, bad crap happens to Sookie, and then she slowly puts it into place. With the adage of knowing things outside of what Sookie knows, the book wasn't even surprising. I knew everything that would happen before it would happen. I've always thought of these books as sci-fi, romance, and most of all a mystery.. but this book was such a disappointing way to end my years of reading the series.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I've read this book twice now and it was better the second time. If you are an Ender's Hague fan, READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!
B009T8XBBO|3.0|This game is fun and addictive, but the icons are TINY! The bonus bar is right on the bottom edge of the screen, and almost impossible to use.  Either because of the proximity to the edge, or poorly written code, but you will fail levels because you can't activate the bonuses.
0694524441|5.0|This audio book was such a treat!  Not only was the story (parable) constructed in such a clever manner, but Jeremy Irons was fantastic as the voice talent.  You'll find yourself driving slowly or taking the long way home just to continue listening to this book. You can't go wrong with this selection.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Not much to say other than if you are a Huey Lewis and The News fan, it's a great collection top to bottom. All the ones you remember on the radio back in the day. Love my 80's music!

B0060MYM3S|5.0|I lived it and the box set was spectacular! Only complaint is the size, each dvd only contain 2 episodes and could easily held 1-2 more per dvd
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Great sci-fi book reminiscent of the forever war or starship troopers. It is not overly scientific but does have some nifty tech
B008CLI4N4|5.0|A riveting and thrilling series that keeps you on the edge of your seat for hours. Only complaint is the box set size, each dvd only contains 2 episodes and cod have easily been reduced in size (7-8) dvds
B0091REZMW|4.0|Overall, this is a fun game. There are a lot of instructions that pop up, but otherwise I have not had any issues with this game. I have been playing for weeks and everything has been free. You just have to wait for your energy to refill on its own,  but that is like most games.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|This movie is awesome. I would recommend it to anyone for solid actors, and a great story line. Had to have it after seeing it years ago in high school.
B004EBT5CU|3.0|Perhaps I was oversold.  From the build-up I received, I was expecting another Sarah Brightman or Lara Fabian.<br /><br />No such luck.  I mean, the lady is okay, even good perhaps, but nothing special, nothing exceptional.<br /><br />Probably good for some background music.  But no magic here.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Wonderfully written as always by CH...but disappointing ending to a series that has held my heart for so long.<br /><br />(Team Eric)

B003R50FRI|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  Recommend it to anyway who want a more serious meaty novel than that usually written
1616551151|5.0|This book goes into full detail about the world of Thedas, and the type of cultures and species that inhabit this vastly-constructed universe. While reading it, I mused over how it was very similar to a real-life encyclopedia, just a fictional Dragon Age version.<br /><br />This being volume one, not every single bit of information about the world is in here, but I'm sure we're to expect more to come. This specific issue covers the nations of Thedas, such as what every culture wears, the classes, how to pronounce some of each nation's dialect and language, species, and events that have happened since humans first arrived on the continent. (Elves and Dwarves go back much further, and some information is told about life before humans as well, although that time is \\"less documented\\".) Beautiful art is through out the book - we're able to see what cities or nations we've heard much about but never have seen look like. There's also a timeline of events in Thedas all through out the book - very useful when you've read the books, comics, and played all the games, to then fully grasp the structure of when each event occurred. (Before now, I always \\"knew\\" the timeline due to fans trying to piece everything together based on general times given to us.)<br /><br />As some people have already mentioned, some of the information given to us doesn't exactly add up to things we've been told in-game. That being said, for any Dragon Age fan, this isn't exactly new for the franchise. ;) As Mike Laidaw said at PAX East, the version that we're told about now can be chalked-up to the canon of the series. For the most part, any \\"different\\" information is very minor, and really doesn't detour you from the story telling of this giant fictional universe.<br /><br />Also, there might be griffins mentioned in this book.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This was a very good book,I have read all of the Kane chronicles, and this was a very good beginning book.
1881273377|5.0|During my network marketing biz venture, our office recommended this book to help with our self development, and to better partnerships in the biz. I bought the book that i ran across at goodwill, but didnt read... Then at the library i came across the audio book. So i downloaded onto my ipod. Began listening on my runs.. And it is very easy to listen to, and makes so much sense!!  Everyone is a different love language, so we express our love differently, and thats where miscommunication can occur, so understanding your spouse's love language is important to keep one another's love tank full! I was single at the time i listened to it, but it had me reflecting on my past relationships and helped me to have a better understanding of how to better my next relationship. I have grown a lot and i often still try to listen to it once a year, it helps!!! My top fav
193700788X|5.0|I don't really feel a need to break down the entire book. I am sorely tired of seeing so many people bashing Charlaine Harris for telling HER story the way SHE imagined it. I enjoyed this series from the beginning and feel the need to give this 5 stars to show my appreciation. Authors do not owe us our version of the happy ending. They can only write what they envision for their stories. I enjoyed Dead Ever After immensely. I did not have any problem with the ending and I understand completely how the characters arrived at where they did.<br /><br />*I did not have a problem with Eric's portrayal. He saw the writing on the wall. He knew what steps to take to release Sookie and ensure her safety. Eric was always a combination of ruthless cunning and great emotion. I  think Eric stayed true to form. I expected Eric to be both despondent and spiteful at losing Sookie. He did not disappoint.<br />*There were a lot of loose ends to tie up in the Sookie-verse. Sometimes it felt like there was an overwhelming amount of activity going on at once, but I know these characters and it was not at all hard to follow.<br />*I loved the HEA. I always wanted it this way, and I understand the characters had to experience other relationships to come full circle.<br />*I believe the most important lines of the book are the final two: \\"I'm Sookie Stackhouse. I belong here\\". Sums up the whole series for me. Sookie needed to find her place in the world and prove to herself she belongs not only in Bon Temps, but to her homestead as well. With her \\"disability\\", she didn't fit in with her community or her family. She was attracted to Sam from book 1 but didn't ever want to risk their friendship or her job. I also believe the Sookie in book 1 may have secretly feared tainting Sam if he became serious with her. She needed to grow up and find herself to be at home....well, at home. Just my opinion.<br /><br />Thank you, Charlaine!
B004SIP9Z6|4.0|Very good film. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys films of the &#34;comic strip&#34; genre. Content not suitable for children.
B004478AS4|4.0|This wasn't my favorite book ever, but it is well-written and not a bad story.  I feel that its importance lies in its depiction of the lower Niger region before and during colonization.  I would recommend this for anyone interested in African history or the effects of colonization.

B000SXMSJ0|5.0|Basically I am a country, Americana fan, but something about the way Norah delivers a song moves me.  She has Country roots and it shows.  I highly recommend this Album.
B000006U44|5.0|The Kick Inside was my introduction to Kate Bush. I originally owned it on LP and played it until it was nearly unplayable. I bought the CD recently so that I could also play this on my iPod. While I love most of her work, this recording still continues to be my favorite. From the evocative &#34;Wuthering Heights&#34; to the hauntingly beautiful &#34;L'amour looks something like you&#34;, this recording continues to show up on my &#34;most played&#34; list.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I enjoy this game - it is very challenging and I am not good at making some of the birds do what I want them to do but it is very addictive.
B009NY43NY|4.0|And a suitable ending for Sookie. I wish Eric's character was more fully developed in this book but not necessarily by staying with Sookie.

B00CJ32S74|4.0|...this is a great soundtrack. It really is. I haven't seen the film yet, but I was really excited to hear the music, as it features such a great collection of dynamic artists. There are some songs that I think are just okay, but I like most of them very much. Highlights include the hypnotic \\"A Little party never Killed nobody\\" by Fergie...this will be the club track of choice this summer, methinks. The Florence + The Machine track, \\"Over the Love,\\" is my other fave, and this deluxe version contains two versions of the song. The Jay-Z song is just okay, but honestly I'm not a fan of his anyway. The other songs are great, too...high energy and fun, with some desperately longing ballads in thee for good measure. It's no \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" but the album invokes a similar spirit. I'm glad I bought it and sprung for the deluxe version.
B000IZ7YK6|2.0|The cinematography was good, but the story was bad - too disturbing and perverse. I could read about the history of the California Water Wars.
193700788X|1.0|My disappointment in this book has nothing to do with Sookie's romantic choices, as unbelievable and out of character as they might be. I did not like the book because the plot was slow and poorly developed. It's as if the book was badly executed fan fic.  I did not enjoy reading it and am frankly surprised that Harris would sign her name to this book. A very anticlimactic ending to what, until this point, was an outstanding series.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Love the soulful sound .  Some of the songs make me think of Janis Joplin.  Hope to hear more from this group.
B009NY43NY|3.0|For me, books and movies are alike in one thing: it's all about the ending. It truly won't matter if the beginning was sluggish, or if the book or movie didn't make any sense, as long as it has a satisfying ending. That just doesn't happen here.<br /><br />Let me start from the beginning.<br /><br />The Sookie Stackhouse novels are, in my opinion, much better than the television show. In fact, I see them as two entirely different things, with BookSookie being much more relatable, beautiful and strong than TrueBloodSookie. That being said, it is understandable why so many people fell in love with her and why so many of us craved a well deserved Happily Ever After for our heroine. Unfortunately for us, somewhere in the midst of the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, Charlaine Harris lost her way and she wound up writing Dead Ever After.<br /><br />What can I say about this book? Here comes spoilers!<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />1. We see a lot of characters making a comeback as a final farewell to all of us. Quinn, Barry, Amelia, Bob, Claude, Johan Glassport, Steve Newlin, Desmond Cataliades, a mention of Hunter, Remy and Niall, Sam's mother, Arlene (of all people) and Copley Carmichael, among others.<br /><br />2. I always enjoy spending a day with Sookie, so I seriously didn't mind going shopping with her, cooking with her and gardening with her. If you truly care for this character you will enjoy what she does, and she enjoys doing these things. They come as a nice distraction from the many terrible things happening in her life.<br /><br />3. Sam and Sookie sitting in a tree... COME ON! You had to see this coming since Book One! If you didn't, you just weren't paying attenion. Sam was always there for Sookie. Sookie always counted on Sam, watched out for him, gave him a loan of her money... Crap... She even gave up the cluviel dor for the man! I agree that after all of the passionate sex scenes with luscious Eric, Sam and Sookie seem very tame and underworked. Harris could have spent a bit more time creating sexual and romantic tension between these two, but I overlook that because, like I said, I expected it to happen since the beginning.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />1. The murder plot was sloppy at best, exasperating at its worst. It seemed like Harris really didn't know how to end Sookie's story so she decided to bring out every single character that had a personal vendetta against poor Sookie and have them all try to kill her, or torture her, at once. Like I said: sloppy.<br /><br />2. Eric. We all knew this was coming. She had been working this for awhile now to a point in which I really felt indifferent towards his relationship with Sookie. Still... I liked Eric. I liked that he knew what he wanted and was strong enough to go after it. I liked that he always tried, in his own Eric Northman way, to take care of Sookie and I liked that he cared, in his own inimitable way, about his children. I really think that he deserved a better farewell and it made me feel like Harris really dislikes the character she worked so hard to make us love.<br /><br />3. Sam and Sookie. YES, I did say it was one of the \\"Good\\" parts, but the way it was rushed, the way the sex scene was laughable and the way they treated one another (like strangers) was just wrong! I wanted them to end up together, but I would have written it better. Much better.<br /><br />The Middle Ground:<br /><br />1. There have been a lot of complaints about how Sookie will relate to vampires from now on. Some people remind us that Harris has likened the Vampire and Were cause to the LGBT community and it seems wrong to them the way Sookie's relationship with Vamps end. It doesn't seem wrong to me at all. Just because you can relate to a cause, be it Vampires, Werewolves or LGBT doesn't mean that you have to become one of them or live with them. You can back them up, sympathize with them and be their friend and nothing more. What most people seem to forget is that Sookie has been beaten, raped and traumatized by her relationship with vampires. I won't hold it against Harris that she chooses for Sookie to not want to relate to them intimately anymore. I find it strange that some people do.<br /><br />It all winds out to the ending. Was it good? Was it bad? The jury's still out on that one. I wanted more. I wanted more passion. I wanted more happiness for Sookie and Sam. I wanted Bill to go on and be happy...<br /><br />I wanted more. You will want more too. But maybe that is the whole point of this book: life and love go on. And for Sookie this isn't the end. It's the beginning of the rest of her life.

193700788X|5.0|I am savoring the last chapter for when I get home, but I have to say I absolutely adored this final book. It's funny and Sookie is as spunky as she ever was. All of my favorite characters from the previous books are in it which was a blast! I am so happy for Sookie, she is the person she has always wanted to be. It am very satisfied with the ending, even though I have been dreading it for a long time. What am I going to do with myself next May?? I guess it's time to start more Charlaine Harris books.
0140039589|5.0|One caution: this is a book for adults. There is quite a bit of violence, cruelty, and the like. Characters very well written; good story. Item arrived in great condition.

B00509OFE8|1.0|A very interesting SciFi action series that is liberally congested with useless flashbacks to the past and remote visits to earth. If one took the central plot of each program then there is only about 10-15 minutes of content. The writers attempted to fill in the space with useless emotional trivia. The alos tended to end each show with a \\"cliffhanger\\" on the main plot to bring the viewers back. Thus the entire series ends with an enormous cliff hanger that is left unresolved for all time.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|my kids love it. they want to play every night. the only thing I would suggest is to let the app open the icons at the top so see what they mean.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|Imagine my total surprise when I ran across this CD. I was watching a youtube video of cats jumping from one perch to another and missing (of course). There was a song in one of them, so whipping up the soundhound app on my phone, discovered the song was called &#34;Sail&#34; by AWOLNATION. I sampled the CD and VERY glad it is now a part of my playlist. It's JUST WONDERFUL!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I was skeptical, after the past couple of books, about how everything would tie together in the end. I really enjoyed this book though and feel like there is room for a &#34;where they are now&#34; book down the road. I always hoped that Sookie would end up with the person she ended up with as well! Overall I'm very pleased with the book.
1451695195|4.0|Too bad he didn't use more of his education as a neurosurgeon when he wrote this book - it was a bit too sappy - not enough science for my liking.  Cute ending though!

B00002N9ER|3.0|I have these all over the place and like them a lot.  Makes it so much easier to keep track of where the flashlights are.  The problem is they are very brittle and easy to break, so be sure you get them installed properly and be careful when inserting or removing the flashlight.  Would have been nice if they would have used a more flexible plastic.  But at this price, just keep a couple extras handy.
B009NY43NY|2.0|It's seems so bland to end the series this way. Not to give too . Much away, but disappointing. With this ending, what was the . Point of the past 10-12 books?

For instance among my favs is Pictures, Trail to a Pile, She her and Me, Her Flow and Pose (For Me).<br /><br />I love the seductive rhythm of this book and other than minor formatting issues; I have literally read this book over and over!

193700788X|1.0|CH butchered the characters that made this series worth reading (even through all the errors) with such a dull wit and with such complete lack of respect for the history of those characters that we can hardly call it character \\"assassination\\" because that word implies some skill. It actually feels perverse, the tone she took which allowed her to write Sookie, Eric, and even Pam so out of character. It felt wrong from the beginning (and that's EXEMPTING THE APOLOGY at the front), worse towards the middle (dragging minor characters through like 2D-cardboard people), and HORRIBLE through the final quarter. Her writing is not clever enough to pull a \\"conjuring trick\\" such as the \\"now you see him, now you don't\\" that she attempted with Eric. I can't believe she had the gall to try. I still wonder how the publisher let this crash and burn happen, though. Frankly, CH's impending demise as a result of this book is more interesting - and exceedingly more apropos - than the book itself.<br /><br />I'd also like to call CH out as a FRAUD for not being intellectually honest about people's reactions to this book. She knows why-for the furor. And she knows its not really about who Sookie ends up with...what a cop-out. Furthermore, I have come to suspect that she was NOT the real and/or only author of the books when Eric became central; she wrote the beginning, and the end of this series. And hoo-boy, did it show. I will never again read another CH book and I will forever steer others away from her books. Way to go, Ace.

1468179993|5.0|The date was set for me to give a talk. Which stories do I tell? What does an audience really want to know? The Awkward Principle, my first book, was just published. Writing a speech isn't the same thing as having a conversation. And I wanted to talk with people, not read some speech. Nervously, I awaited a copy of How to Deliver a TED Talk; it arrived two days before the event. Donovan's short book was a fast read, but still managed to cover everything. How to Deliver a TED Talk talked me down with its surprisingly fresh advice.

I have all of her books and love them all bit this one was terrible! Even Harpers end was better than this. The only thing I can think of to make this make any sense is that this will not be her last Sookie novel? Maybe she is going to do an epilogue?
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|this is a great CD -- moody, but yet upbeat - it has that Bowie 70's sound but with a mature viewpoint and a mellow and weathered voice that is not afraid to be emotional or honest.<br />Valentine's Day - love this song -<br />Haunting ballads - I put it on and then forget everything - it puts you in a different zone and centers one listening to it....can't stop listening to it! Great CD
B00008G8LG|5.0|This was one of the most romantic movies I've ever viewed. Both Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat were terrific in their roles of the governess and the King of Siam. The costuming was truly magnificent and the scenery gorgeous. The interplay between Anna and the king was understated and very beguiling. The desire underlying their scenes together was very evident and yet sensitively done. This is a movie about romance NOT sex. The movie, of course, has very little to do with the real-life story of the life of the governess and king of Siam but it is surely more fun.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|This CANNED edition of Forbidden Planet is becoming more difficult to find in decent condition, let alone a decent price. This movie is MANDATORY for any Sci-fi collection. If you can afford this exceptional release buy it. It displays beautifully with vivid colors that draw the eyes. You will brag about it and your Sci-fi fiend friends will envy you for it. Promise.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I received this dvd movie quickly, in great shape, and at an affordable price.  Securely packed for shipping, billing taken care of online -- also securely done.  Amazon is the first place I look for what I need.<br />  I read The Hobbit and the Fellowship of the Ring books a number of years before that fantasy world was brought to life before my eyes.  I loved every minute of the story and every character.  Now with my wonderful new copy of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, I will watch it many times and hope more stories from these lands will be told as beautifully and as exciting filmed.
B0019NG73G|4.0|I don't think anyone who's seen this movie could give it a bad review. I will say up front I prefer the original release more than the directors cut. Its just seems to move a bit better. The directors cut is primarily more 'sweeping pans' with a lot more music. Nice, but it does slow the movie down.<br />There are only a couple of things of issue.<br />ONE. All of us must remember that this movie is based on the book \\"Killer Angels\\". An extremely well researched book based on many facts available about the Gettysburg battle. BUT it is colored with a bit of the authors opinion when it comes to actual dialogue and individual emotions. There are conflicting opinions as to who decided what, who is at fault for this or that, even a bit of who actually was where. Some of the information provided (the writer admits) may be rose colored from biographies of some of the major players written long after the battle and slanted to place blame on others and laurels on themselves. More in depth historians may rip in with their opinions. They have a right to do so as long as they to admit personal feelings may also be a bit slanted.<br />TWO: The unfortunate fact that the battle was much larger than even this movie could accomplish displaying may be lost to some. I just ask everyone to remember that. There was fighting all along the Union line, and around the left flank. The main body (center) is portrayed and of course Chamberlains defense of the right flank. Heh, the movies long enough with just that. But I would have loved to see/hear more about Jeb Stewarts ride around the left side trying to get into the back of the Union defense. It was a very important part of the battle. The Union Cavalry (including General George A. Custer) did an excellent job of thwarting that attempt.<br />This movie has already become a staple for anyone who collects Civil War or just plain war movies. I had the original VHS boxed edition with the bullet in a bag.<br />If you already own it, blu-ray, dvd, vhs, whatever. This is the 150th anniversary edition of the battle.<br />BUY IT!
0606265058|3.0|The first half of this book is unbelievably gripping, and I was unable it down. I loved the way it is written from Jack's perspective and how the actual situation dawns but slowly on the reader; after all, this is the only world Jack has ever known, and his mother has made sure that it is a safe and happy world (within the limitations of the room in which they live). The nail-biting tension of the first part works to a climax and is then released, so it is understandable that the second part of the book has to be different. I'm not sure that the second part is as satisfying - perhaps it is not all that necessary; perhaps we do not need things to be 'rounded off'. That said, I would, however, definitely recommend 'Room'.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great book full of life lessons for all ages, that really makes you think about the way we \\"see\\" others.
0143122916|4.0|Although we have been aware that North Korea interprets the word 'liberty' in a different way to most other countries, Blaine Harden's book about Shin's unbelievable escape from a life of imprisonment is gripping, horrifying and educational. The brainwashing and the physical deprivation that coloured Shin's early life and formed him into the person he later became is heartbreaking. 'Escape from Camp 14' should be compulsory reading for everyone, if not to put such atrocities into the limelight then, at least, to put our own lives into perspective.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I gave this book a 5 star because of its style. Not a typical zombie book. Told the stories of all parts of the world, their experiences, and end results after world war z. Wasn't one sided. I would recommend this for a zombie fan but also someone that enjoys short stories that have the same topic.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|One of those books that tries to gain something by hauling in numerous major historical characters (e.g., Truman, Stalin, Mao).  The sample was much more interesting than the book, which was pretty silly.
B000BISBDY|5.0|It was even better than I knew it would be.<br />I had heard most of Cash's early music and it sounded so clear and vivid on this CD. It was from the middle of his career to the last recordings of his life that the music really hooked me. Just excellent song choices put together for this CD.<br />I highly recommend this CD for any music fan.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Classic Joe. I enjoyed he heck out of it!LOVE, love, love.<br />I can not say that. Have ever purchased a bad Joe CD.
B0000X61VE|5.0|My favorite workout ever! Excellent at shaping and toning your body! I would suggest this product to any woman in need of working off a few or a lot of extra weight.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Loved this film. It will be a part of my collection for many years.<br />I highly recommend it to people with a political mind.
B008J9EYFG|5.0|Very strong new album from Beth. I'm a fan. Own all her albums and seen her live twice. Most recently front row at an acoustic set during her comeback and presumed preparation for this album - think it was Jan 2012. She was very funny and the music was astoundingly good. Listening to the new album, there was no hint of it in her performance that night.<br /><br />This is her masterpiece. Everything that has gone before is just a stepping stone leading to this. Genius!<br /><br />Mystery, the last song on the cd is my new favourite song of all time. Achingly good.<br /><br />Give it a try. It doesn't get much better this.
141690977X|5.0|I have already given two copies of this book away to friends. Let's face it, this world doesn't teach many women how to understand men correctly, but this book has some insight into how to translate men-speak before and during a relationship. It helped all of us understand some things that happened in our relationships and how our missinterpretation led from one thing to another.<br />Then again, I may never be in a relationship again. Haven't met a man who fits my criteria and wont budge for less.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I have been using this app ever since I got my HTC Sensation and i must say, this is one of the best apps I've used on my phone. It is consistent, easy to use, and packed with features. I would definitely recommend this app
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Most definitely a movie everyone will love. My students love it when I play it at the end of the semester as a send off.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son LOVES legos and also likes this building game.  It is one of his favorites.  I hear they have a mindcraft lego set too
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really good game I love playing it all day long it's really fun it's a safe app for all kids all ages.
B009LXECF6|2.0|I bought this album for my 9 year-old daughter because she likes current music.  I thought that by buying the &#34;amended&#34; version, which I believed was supposed to remove suggestive words, I'd be O.K.  But no, we hear Bruno singing &#34;Yeah your sex takes me to paradise&#34;.  My daughter heard this and knew what he was saying, but I tried to divert her by saying he was really talking about her scent.  So now we can't play this cd anymore when the kids are around.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is my favourite game to play. As far as I can tell I have no problems playing this on my kindle fire. I love how you can make your pictures on the cards. I recently bought a drawing app and I like to change the cards to the pictures I make. I constantly play this game and I would highly recommend this game to everyone.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is so fun it as almost all suits in iron man 3. pluse you get to vs old school bad guys.There's different places to play.Lastly you get destroy Roberts tanks creatures and get coins while doing it.Overall it my favorite game.
B009P5S11G|5.0|I absolutly loved this cd, I am so happy I bought it. It was well worth the money. I would recommend this cd to all Rihanna fans.
0788859544|5.0|Bought it for a gift.  It came super fast and just as described.  It was still in the new wrapper and my granddaughter will be so excited.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|Spent MANY hours of enjoyment and frustration. Would love to see new or addon game.  Will keep trying to better scores.  Challenge mode is precisely that.
B00AIBZM40|4.0|I'm conflicted on MAMA.  There are things that I really like about this movie, but there are things I really can't stand about it too.<br /><br />Let's get the bad out of the way first.  The CGI on Mama was awful.  What should have been something really scary was just ugly (and not in a good way).  The ghost was overly CGIed, and looked pretty horrid in my opinion.<br /><br />However the good far outweighs the bad on this film.  The script is above average for these types of movies.  Sure there are cliched moments, but the story and characters are well written.  Even with a good script the movie could still fall apart without the right actors, and here Jessica Chastain, Megan Charpentier, and Isabelle Nélisse do a remarkable job.  This is really some of the best acting I've seen in a horror movie in quite a long time.  As Jeffrey, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is amazing as a man who is at the end of his rope.  The opening scene is really held together by some fantastic directing and Nikolaj's fantastic performance.  Nikolaj's other role as Jeffrey's twin brother Lucas kind of falls into cliched territory in terms of story content (he leaves the girls alone for a good portion of the second half of the film), and it doesn't seem like he was given much to do, but his acting in the opening is quite good.<br /><br />As for the blu-ray itself it has some really good extras (which is why I gave the disc 4 stars and not 3).  My favorite is the inclusion of the original MAMA short.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome. I would recimend this game to people that like tempel run and games like that. this is one of my favorite games.
B00004RFFI|5.0|this is a great movie a classic in my eye. I love to watch it. I know all of the best lines.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I truly enjoyed this classic tale.  The innocence is refreshing.  The story line is realistic.  The characters, deep.  The message, powerful.
0399157565|5.0|My entire collection of books is never complete unless I have Patricia Cornwell's latest Scarpetta episode of medical mystery pleasure.
0307595862|1.0|I love good mysteries but call me old school. I miss Authors who can write about sex without it being so in your face that I didn't go beyond the second page.  A mother leaving her child in the car to meet her lover etc.  I can watch TV for this kind of story.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Enjoyed the graphics, videos and the art work. Smart interactive sequences. The story mystery had me wondering...and the puzzles and games mixed it up. Very entertaining! Hint and skip buttons if you want, and also very nice on screen &quot;hint&quot; details for full pay. Me likely.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|This is for the &#34;real fans&#34; who have wanted these songs and footage for many years. At last our wish was answered!
0920668372|4.0|Nice premise, we read is in our house and leave out the parts we don't like, or which don't apply.
B002GIBVV6|3.0|If you haven't read the book, this might be fine.  I did read the book.  Some details of this were changed.  Some of my favorite parts of the book were left out.  My husband, who hasn't read the book, says the plot went a bit fast. I agree.
B009NY43NY|2.0|For fans of Ms. Harris, stick with the PREVIOUS book as the last book in this series. I won't go into much detail, as many other reviewers have provided some good, detailed reviews of THIS rather disappointing book. Personally, the only way to redeem this book (so as to make it worthwhile reading) would be if the author announced a follow-up book. By follow-up, I mean one that is a stand-alone that's more in keeping with the progression of the entire series of books (not TV episodes), or one that's the beginning of a spin-off series that accomplishes the same. While the author writes well, the content leaves much to be desired....especially for the last book in a lengthy series.
B000PKX2KA|3.0|Rosepoint software does not work reliably with this unit. It's the serial link that is the problem and it has been modified in later revisions of this GPS puck and should be OK. But check before you buy, but this model has issues. Worked well on just about all other Navigation software but not the one that I really wanted it for!
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Thanks Mark for taking the time to jot down these notes, thoughts and experiences.  Loved the book and will not only read it over and over, but will also recommend to my good frends.
B009NY43NY|3.0|That I didn't hate it is the most praise I can generate for this book.  Am I satisfied with the ending?  &#34;Somewhat&#34; is the best I can do.<br /><br />I haven't gone through the nearly 600 reviews posted before mine, but I'm sure others are repeating most of what I want to say.  So I'll be brief...The plot was convoluted.  It really seemed too long overall.  There were inconsistencies with characters, plot, whatever.  And I'm very disappointed with what was done to Eric.<br /><br />**Mild Spoilers Ahead!**<br />What I will say is that you could see from the past couple of books that CH had no intention of leaving Eric and Sookie together.  Feel free to correct me if I am wrong, but the relationship has been clearly deteriorating.  And after the last book, it was no secret that she was going to end up with Sam.  I'm not sure how I feel about that - but again, I didn't hate it.<br /><br />I have grown to love these characters so perhaps that is why I didn't mind spending time with them via this book - but it is obvious that Ms. Harris is tired of them.  The major fault that I do have was pointed out in one of the reviews that I did actually read - after the adventures of 13 books, Sookie seems to be no better off than when the series started.  And that's really too bad.
B00169N0BK|4.0|It took me a little bit to get the knack of measuring targets but the result has been well worth it.  My prints absolutely match my screen for the first time in forever.<br /><br />The only downside is that producing the test targets consumes 2 sheets of whichever paper you are profiling.  That can be an issue when working with very high end papers as it can get expensive.  The results are worth the occasional expense. This is a great tool for the hobbyist, or semi-pro who wants a simple way to get accurate color in their prints.
B0009XRZ9M|5.0|This is such a neat movie!  The camera / picture technology is amazing.  Although it is very Santa Claus - centered (rather than the true meaning of Christmas), it will certainly be a Christmas tradition.
B00AZNEW5G|1.0|Do not waste your money, This movie (if that's what you want to call it ) is a real turd. If you like weepy, girley movies this is the one for you. Most facts are incorrect, the ones they bothered to use are of the political correct kind ( let's not show any blood or guts it is a war movie someone may be offended) No wonder people can't get history right. They did our boys a real injustice, Thank God we have real Seal's.
B00BSWMITK|2.0|Satriani is a guitar wizard. There is no question about it. He sparked the instrumental rock genre all those years ago. You can't argue with that either.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this record just lacks...IT. I don't even know how to describe it. The songs lack polish to me. Almost as if they were demos hanging around that he wanted people to hear, but never really got around to finishing them. Many of the solo breaks can be heard on other records in one facet or another. There was nothing on this record that really wowed me. Same old Wah drenched solos. Same old whammy bar squeals. Jut more of the same with different back ground riffs.<br /><br />I'm so conflicted because Satch is THE man. I've seen him live and he blew me away a few times. This record just seems so blah. Nothing that ignited my soul like many of his other efforts. He needs to get the crew from his self titled record back together and really do something different.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan, but this record just fell very, very flat for me. Come on, Joe!!! Give us something we can really sink our teeth into.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Very well done movie. Have watched it several times and it's always fun. And I'm not really into comic book characters. Has the right amount of action, drama and comedy.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|it is a good game and lots of fun to play this game is very addictive beware so much fun you cant stop playing
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|I loved this book. Casting felt pretty awkward. The stage and changes in the film were distracting. It felt like they either were attempting to give you the feel of a stage play or they ran out of budget to film on location. Costuming was beautiful. It was difficult to really enjoy the film and connect with the content due to the various failed art house styling that was employed.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I love the revolving part of the case. It's easy and quick to use. Stand up works  Well also. (No slipping. It stays where you put it....) Another feature I really like and was one of the reasons I chose this case is the wide elastic band across the back of case. When you put your hand under band it takes some pressure off your hand and makes it much easier to hold. I have arthritis in my hands and this feature really helps. I highly recommend this Marware Case to everyone !!!!!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like this game because it is easy to win. It maybe a bit to easy.  I would like more of a challenge.
1897299192|5.0|I read these whimsical, carefully cafted comicstrips as a kid, way back in the seventies in the Dutch newspaper &#34;De Volkskrant&#34; and the strange atmosphere intrigued me. Drawn in a very distinctive, clear line, the stories leasurely meander through the loose plots. Reading Moomin brings you in a relaxed state of mind. Read a story every night before bedtime and you're guaranteed to have pleasant dreams.
1591841992|5.0|Humans are visual beings. This book helps setup frameworks for communicating visually. You don't need to be a Picasso or Bob Ross to visually communicate. There are so many situations where visual communication is SO much more effective than the written word. I'd draw my review if it were possible.  :-)
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Everything mentioned in this book was not only inspirational but frighteningly true. I would recommend all men and women to read this.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|The case excede my expectations.  It makes my Kindle Fire so much easier to handle, and I know it's always protected.
B0009MZ7WA|5.0|It is a sensitive, thought-provoking, and elegant film. Excellent actors, outstanding photography, penetrating story.  I would advise it to anyone concerned with finding the true meaning of relationships.
B006CUDDUG|3.0|A disappointing novel due to the lack of George Smiley as the prime character. The title is deceptive: &#34;...... A George Smiley Novel.&#34;
161176064X|5.0|This is a unique point of view for the reader.  One can become a 13 year old boy who loves the law and practices in the courthouse of his own small town in Mississippi.  Adults and kids will like Theodore Boone.
B0083V2WBS|5.0|Hugh Laurie is a multi-talented performer.  So glad to have an audio and video that show his amazing musical talents!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Dr Heinze does it again....He's locked up Perry but we help him escape! Fun puzzle. Kids and adults both enjoy it
B009T8XBBO|2.0|I aquired this as the App of the Day (aotp) and this seemed right up my alley for something interesting to do while having a few minutes to burn (while riding on a bus). Unfortunately the game becomes almost unplayable not too many levels in because the target that I'm suppose to press are too hard to hit with my big finger(s) on my Samsung Galaxy S3 (not a small phone).<br /><br />There is some thinking to be had about resource management and doing things in the proper order to get the highest score but it isn't terribly difficult.  That is until you add in the fact that you want to do something but have to tap 6 or 7 times to hit the target.<br /><br />Some tasks can't be completed and there are popup bubbles that say I need X amount of Resource Q. Is that X amount more or total? If it's total then I have enough and it lies, if it is more then why not say, \\"more\\" in the bubble to be more clear.<br /><br />But the thing that totaly ruins the potential of the game is that your taps aren't registered properly, so I couldn't possible recommend this to anyone.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Loved the play. The film plays very true to the film and we definitely enjoyed it.Buy it,watch it, Love it!!

0142428698|5.0|I enjoy all of the John Grisham stories.  Even though this is about a 13 year old kid, it is so well written that adults can enjoy this book too.  Anyone interested in learning a little more about law, will like this book.
B00466HN6S|5.0|My grand kids really enjoyed it. They watchfed it several times. The characters were interesting and original.  It was nice to see a new story line for spring/Easter.
8866137634|5.0|While Evernote can capture any paper, this notebook helps to flatten out the image and improve the overall scanning rate. The paper is very high quality, and I very much enjoy the combination of the notebook and Evernote.
0300169787|5.0|This is Alexander McQueen, his last collection. The photographs are superb. His work is breathtaking. Does anything more really need to be said?
B0009A1AS2|5.0|very good
B009UNH0EM|5.0|This cord is simple , effective , and economic. Yes you need to plug it in to a computer to charge the Bluetooth but it is lightning fast and as much as we are on our computers u r killing two birds with one stone
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|OK, let me start by saying there will never be anything to match the 1939 version of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", but this movie has a lot going for it.  Wonderful special effects, interesting story and fine cast.  Overall, very entertaining.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|i can keep in touch with my family easier and add photos so much easier. i can also find other interests thru threr.
B004YESKU0|5.0|You get a lot of &#34;system&#34; without having to break the bank on this one!!!  Hours of loaded ear bleeding fun!!!  Thanks a million, really enjoying it.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|This is a great movie we watch over and over.  The music is wonderful, the scenery is wonderful and the sentiments are worthwhile.
0785163174|4.0|I think AVX was a great story. I only think it should have been bigger. The civil war storyline should have been done here and all the crossovers like the individual battles and the stuff from WATX and Keiron Gillen's Uncanny should have been included too. This would have been awesome.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I gave this as a gift.  It arrived on time and in great condition.  The person who receieved it was very happy to get it!!  The story line is darker than I would have imagined, but loved the dancing!!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Great movie!! Love Adam Sandler and Selena Gomez! Can watch it over and over again! Funny and had a love story, whats not to like? Fast shipping!!!!!! :)
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|Love his music, love they way he sings and plays music he truly makes it an art. seems to be a great person also.
B008QOH1NG|3.0|HD to me is Blu-Ray, and this is something Stryper has yet to come out with!!!  I love Stryper and have been listening to them since I was 16 and I'm now in my 40's, so they've stuck!!!  I get that, nevertheless, the over all production lacks due to the DVD quality one must deal with if they want to enjoy this show!!!  I really did enjoy the show I must say, just wish it had a little more of the &#34;BLU's&#34;....
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|The acting was great and the special effects were spectacular.  Highly recommend this action movie for everyone that it is rated for.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like this game a lot. Some reviewers say that you have to pay real money in the game but, you don't have to unless you don't want to wait for your energy to fill. Over all it is a little annoying to wait but I still like the game.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I gave this as a gift.  It arrived on time and in great condition.  The person who receieved it was very happy to get it because we hadn't seen it in the store!!  We liked this one even more than the first movie----funny + far fetched!!  Great cast!!
1616550414|5.0|I missed out on the collector's edition, but I don't mind at all really. I think the green cover is more fitting to Legend of Zelda artwork.  Speaking of the artwork, it is AMAZING!  This book is beautiful from cover to cover.  A lot of attention to detail went into this and it shows.
B00BSWMITK|3.0|Ok...Unstoppable Momentum....<br /><br />As with any Joe Satriani album, I have to process it over several listens. My current impression is like with \\"Strange Beautiful Music\\" and \\"Is There Love in Space\\".<br /><br />There are moments of shear compositional and technical brilliance here and there and then moments where you are scratching your head saying to yourself...\\"Man, what was Satch thinking when he laid that down?\\". I feel obligated to buy it just because I really want to support him, but several of the tracks are so boring and 'inaccessible', it just seem like filler. A couple of the tracks though are so groovy and infectious you just can't help but bob your head right along with the tune.<br /><br />The first two tracks, \\"Unstoppable Momentum\\", \\"Can't go Back\\", and the track \\"A Door into Summer\\" are all fantastic. \\"Jumpin' In\\" and \\"Jumpin' Out\\" are both funky hillbilly vibe tunes, maybe reminiscent of his \\"Banana Mango\\" phase, but the solo sections in both of these tracks are off the hook awesome, especially on \\"Jumpin' Out\\"! Whenever Satch explores those minor lines, his tunes just have an incredible gravity to them and reminds me why he's one of my favorite guitar players.<br /><br />\\"Weight of the World\\" begins with a \\"Bamboo\\"esque intro and then turns into a dance track with a rather depressing melody and it just doesn't work very well. Certainly one of those \\"scratch yer head\\" tracks. Think of \\"Hordes of Locusts\\" with dance tracks and more morbidity.<br /><br />\\"A Celebration\\"....think of a \\"Happy\\" version of \\"Driving at Night\\"....it should have been titled \\"Driving during the Day\\"...its ok, but certainly not a stand out at all.<br /><br />The worst track on the disc is by far \\"Shine on American Dreamer\\"...this track is such and amateur composition it is hard to believe this came out of Joe's head at all. I was toying with Joe's opening to his track \\"Time Machine\\", using that open D and then fretting notes on the G and B to make little melodies when Ifirst started playing guitar. To have Joe construct a whole song around that is just amateurish at best. No progression, just a locked in, staccato rythym. It reminds me of his track \\"The Golden Room\\" which I call \\"The Song that Never Went Anywhere.\\" Its not that its bad...its that it just leaves you disappointed, unfulfilled and frustrated because you know Joe is capable of writing, composing, and playing so much better than this.<br /><br />Also, their isn't a ballad at all on the disk.  So disappointing.<br /><br />Anyway...those are my initial impressions. I'll have to digest it more...maybe it will grow on me more over time. But when you've been listening to Jack Thammarat (Thailand), Marco Sfogli (Italy), and Rick Graham (UK) for the last few months on YouTube (whom I now pretty much consider to be \\"The Second Coming of Instrumental Rock Guitar\\") this offering from Joe just doesn't measure up very well.<br /><br />Just IMHO...<br /><br />**Peace**
B008AUGEFC|5.0|I've only read two of David Mitchell's novels (this and [[ASIN:0812974018 Black Swan Green: A Novel]]) but it's enough to tell me this is a man who has great ambition and talent.  I don't know about other readers, but I often find myself being intimidated by authors whose books win awards like this one (it won several, including the British Book Awards, and was shortlisted for end-of-the-year accolades like the Booker Prize, the Nebula, and the Arthur C. Clarke Award).  But rest assured, Mitchell's work is as reader friendly as it is impressive.<br /><br />In that vein, some friends I've described his books to have made comments like, \\"six stories within one novel - and they're not even in the same time period, or share narrators?  No way.\\" Again, while Mitchell may sound intimidating, ATLAS is thoroughly enjoyable, very readable, and actually fun at times (the fourth story's a hoot!). The six stories within actually link up in unusual and clever ways, and I did not find this novel hard to follow.  I'll relate the bare bones of the first few stories to point out how interesting they are.<br /><br />The first story - \\"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing\\" - begins and ends the novel. As it relates the story of a young notary whose business takes him to the South Pacific in the mid-1850s, he is horrified by their society's treatment of slaves, and aghast when he finds out one has smuggled himself inside his berth on his return home.  But Ewing's health becomes a big issue on the long voyage home...so much so that I was shocked when it just seemed to end in the middle of a sentence. (Don't worry...it concludes at the end of the book. )<br /><br />The next tale moved ahead 80 years to the 1930s: \\"Letters from Zedelghem\\" concerns a young, bankrupt con artist named Robert Frobisher whose letters to his male lover Rufus Sixsmith inform us how he is exploiting his considerable talent to secure a place at the side of a languishing Belgian composer who seems unable to finish his masterwork. Soon, Robert begins frequenting the bedroom of the composer's wife, and in his spare time he writes his own musical composition and lounges within the composer's estate reading the first half of a journal of a young man named...Adam Ewing.<br /><br />Next up is \\"Half Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery\\" and find ourselves in the 1970s, within the mind of a resourceful young female reporter who is being handed a bombshell of a story: an elderly scientist named Rufus Sixsmith has evidence that a nuclear power plant about to start operating is highly dangerous. He is murdered soon after, and her investigation turns up not only his report, but also his letters from his old male lover...Robert Frobisher. As she is assembling her story she ends up buying Frobisher's magnum opus: \\"The Cloud Atlas Sextet.\\" But her story takes an abrupt pause after a malevolent pursuer forces her VW off a bridge - plunging her into the sea below.<br /><br />Thus it continues: the next story, \\"the Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish,\\" is actually uproarious, as its overweight protagonist is a horrid but hilarious modern day book publisher who finds himself imprisoned in an old age home. \\"An Orison of Sonmi 451,\\" the fifth story, was the slowest for me, as it was constructed as a futuristic interview of a genetically engineered clone created merely to serve food at a restaurant. When she mysteriously becomes sentient, however, she becomes the target of several groups who wish to use her to further their own agendas. What happens to her becomes somewhat clearer when the sixth and final and only continuously told story occurs: \\"Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After\\"<br /><br />It was the sixth story, occurring at an unnamed time in the post-apocalyptic future, that I found most fascinating, and it captivated me from the very first words: \\"Old \\"Georgie's path an' mine crossed more times'n I'm comfy mem'ryin, an' after I'm died, no sayin' what that fangy devil won't try an' do to me...\\" I included this quote because, while I thought this sing-song dialect rolled off the literary ear as smoothly as silk, there are many who HATE dialect in print. Their minds reel at memories of Huck Finn's Jim, or of certain passages in Faulkner, or any other stories in which authors take liberties with the printed word. But for me it worked, and I loved reading this section, for many reasons: we learn of the near end of civilization, of the savagery exhibited by the tribal clusters still left alive, and of man's hope of living on. Mostly, however, I found this story to be VERY compelling...I loved the characters and rooted for them more than any other story.<br /><br />It is at this point that the book \\"devolves,\\" returning to each tale in reverse order to wrap up their portions of the book. As this happens the reader is able to see the interlocking elements of life...how one human can affect another, even hundreds, thousands, or more. Mitchell's unusual novel is a puzzle, but it is not immensely difficult. It is a story of interconnectedness, a reaffirming collection of individual stories that shows us we are NOT merely solitary people, but members of a common humanity, one related to all.<br /><br />Mitchell's CLOUD ATLAS is after all, then, a clever story but not TOO clever, a literary puzzle that is very solvable, and a tale of separate stories that is really quite unified in its overall approach.  Mitchell is fast becoming one of my favorite authors, and I look forward to reading [[ASIN:0375507264 Number9Dream]] next.<br /><br />(A NOTE: if you give a negative review, please leave a comment to help me do better next time.)..\\" I included this quote because, while I thought this sing-song dialect rolled off the literary ear as smoothly as silk, there are many who HATE dialect in print.

B00AHTYI5M|5.0|It arrived on time.  It is a good story and I like Ben Affleck.  I recommend this DVD to who ever like to watch this kind of movie.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Every tune is a keeper, every slide lick is perfect, and her voice is still pure Bonnie Raitt. No surprise that she won a Grammy for this album.
B005LAII12|4.0|I gave this as a gift.  It arrived on time and in great condition.  The person who receieved it was very happy to get it!!  I definitely wouldn't watch it with kids around----this is an adult movie-----stupid humor, but funny!!
1606864602|4.0|Smart, funny, and occasionally scary. This is a memorable novelette that seems every bit as relevant, as it was during the height of the Cold War when it was published. The story follows a young woman, named Oedippa Maas, who through luck(not all of it good) was bequeath the vast estate from the deceased Pierce Inverarity. What follows is a vast uncovering of truths, complications, and revelations that everyone seems to have a stake in. Ms. Maas finds herself running from the Italian Mafia(involved in the fertilizer business, of course); meets up with the secretive Inamorato Anonymous(consisting of people addicted to love); finds a key to the secret of Maxwell's Demon, and finds herself brought to the attention of renegade postal carriers, and ultra secret society, Trystero. Sometimes exhaustive, often difficult, but never boring this book packs a punch that leaves a bruise on the mind(but what a feeling!). Highly recommended for fans of X-Files, conspiracy tales, or biting satire.
B004OEIL54|5.0|This movie is awesome & the blu ray is too. the picture is great, great everything. the only bad thing is it is cut just like EVERY single dvd or blu ray but thats not this blu rays fault. if you really love scream & want the ORIGINAL UNCUT version then do what i did, go to amazon japan, click &#34;in english&#34;, enter PIBF-7013 & the japanese DVD version will pop up & thats the UNCUT version you want. it's region 2 though so be ready for that but it's audio is completely original english & has removable subtitles. the menu's in japanese but it's no big deal. if anyone else wants to take a gamble & get the SAME version but in blu ray & let us know if it's UNCUT also that'd be really appreciated. &#34;It's all one great big movie&#34;
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|It was good show, I wish the.y came out with this first. The animated  show started with this first and it made more sense.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|I would recommend this product to who ever like to watch this kind of movies.  Shipping was fast, and I like this kind of movie.
B00447L4KA|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. Sure sometimes you might think it's a little too inappropriate, but stick it out it's so worth it.
B002ZG999U|4.0|I gave this as a gift.  It arrived on time and in great condition.  The person who receieved it was very happy to get it because we hadn't seen it in the store!!  We know it's far fetched, but we love the older hit, kick, bang movies!!
B00006K0WX|5.0|This is an awesome product, its the cheapest legit Sony PS2 controller on amazon that I could find, and it works great. I've had it for a few weeks now and it still works great.
0143122916|5.0|A fast and remarkable read with a lot of information about North Korea and the criminals that run the country.  Don't miss the book and the saga that involves this young man, Shin.
B008JFUO72|2.0|If you are into special effects, you will enjoy it a lot. The trailers fooled every one. I do not mind a good twist, but the one in Iron Man 3 is far from good. When do we see the Mandarin? That was the question since the first Iron Man movie. I read somewhere that they did not want to use him because the magic rings would be a silly thing. I think that would have been great, technology vs magic. Anyway, they took Iron Man's greatest enemy and turned him into a joke. A bad one.<br /><br />Ben Kingsley is a great actor, but his talent was wasted here. The story could have been based on the entire Extremis  plot, why mix it up with a fake Mandarin? That scene where Kingsley is coming out of the bathroom, the audience is laughing and my friends look at me and ask: THIS IS THE MANDARIN? You know there is something wrong when everyone is laughing in a movie like this one. It felt like we were watching a parody of Iron Man.<br /><br />It is like tropic thunder, Kingsley is a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude. It also reminds me of this other movie (Wag the dog). Is Marvel going to do this often? One good movie, let's do a bad one now. Do not hate me, it is just my opinion and I would like to know about yours. The plane sequence was awesome so was part of the final battle. It could have been better, but I think too much funny stuff and the Mandarin plot ruined it. What do you think?
B000FC1HBY|5.0|George R. R. Martin continues his Lord of the Ringish mythology with somewhat slow but superb story telling.  He makes the reader feel for each character while despising the majority of them. All are arrogant and basically fools obsessed with power and control while attempting to stay loyal to their families. Staying true to ones family is near impossible when those family members are conniving war mongers. Unfortunately, I never heard of George R. R. Martin or his A Song of Fire and Ice until the show on HBO. Which I'm ashamed of because this story is very compelling and deserves to be read without being compared to the show.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|It's OK but I probably will not watch the movie more than the original.<br /><br />I complain about having to write an excessive  amount of words to get my thoughts across.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Rod Stewart's songwriting gift has been reawakened and he has shared it with us. Long time fans have waited a very long TIME for this album, and as others have said it tells a beautiful story of different TIMEs of life that many of us have experienced.  Thank you Rod for all the passion, honesty and love you share in this album.  YOU MADE US HAPPY.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game! I am way too addicted to this game! I play it everyday, for longer than I should. It keeps me awake at night. lol
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows. So my review is biased. I cannot say enough good things about it. Winter is coming.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I had a feeling about the way the storyline with Eric and Sam and Sookie would go (Not Saying, won't spoil it!)  but I was very pleasantly surprised with how wonderfully detailed and rich this book turned out to be. Just a heads up, don't read this if you have not read the previous 12 books because so many things come up from the past that you wouldn't understand it unless you read the previous books first so don't start with the last one!  I can't wait to get After Dead in October to see how all of the Happily Ever Afters turn out. A truly wonderful read!!! Every page was filled with information I definitely had wondered about before when reading the previous books. A really great ending to a phenomenal series!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so fun I think that everyone shod git it I am a big horse fan I got 4 horses of my own.
B009P5S11G|5.0|Great CD - Haven't watched the DVD yet but Riahnna is my favorite artist. Even got a free Amazon Cloud downlaod of the CD
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Works like a charm. Reset the edge with the carbon side first, then drag it through the ceramic side, and your good to go. This wont put a &#34;quality, long lasting edge&#34; on your steel, but you wont be too concerned with that when it only takes you 30 seconds to get ANY knife sharp. I recommend this for everyday use on standard everyday knives. Dont use this sharpener on your expensive steel, this is meant to create a very sharp edge quickly and will remove a lot of metal (you can see the shavings after every drag through the carbon) and set its own brute Edge.
1476712042|5.0|I could not put this book down. I stayed up till 3am reading, which I rarely do. I woke up this morning and bought Walking Disaster, starving for Trav's side of the story. I'm hooked on Jamie McGuire. She can really weave a story around you. I would like say more, but I'm afraid I might spoil the storyline for you.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Angle of stones is not acute enough for kitchen knives. It maybe alright for a hatchet. It will make a blunt knife sharper.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This was a birthday gift at last minute. It came on time and the quality was excellent. I am so glad I got it.
B005D4YOHI|5.0|I bought these for my son for this summer so he hasn't worn them much yet, however the fit is perfect and we received them in Alaska within a couple days of purchase.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I got this as a free deal-of-the-day app on Amazon, and really like it.  It has way more functions than I will ever use, but if you are in the scientific field and need to interconvert metric vs english units this is very handy.  Now that I have it, I think it worth paying money for.  Quality app.
B007SGM084|2.0|It was so so. First book was too long. Not as good as all the hype. I don't think I would recommend it.
1557048630|4.0|This book is a necessity for anyone who loves the movie, and it has quite a number of gorgeous drawings. How they came to some of the designs proves interesting as well, but my one complaint about the book on a whole is that it didn't have a lot of Toothless drawings.
193700788X|1.0|I must admit I was Thoroughly disappointed with this book. I was expecting it to go out with a bang! As much as I have admired the authors imagination through out the series I felt it showed that she had grown tired of writing the series, just wanting it to end. The book was not nearly as imaginative or creative as the others... It felt as if it was thrown together in desperation to get it over with once & for all! Normally she paints a picture but this book was all over the place. Many pointless sections, as if to fill the spot. A lot of the book felt like it was going no where. There was someone constantly saying they had something important to say, later but it seemed later never came many times or not as much or as big as it led you to believe. It seemed like she had a good idea for the ending but lacked the Enthusiasm (though I disagree with her idea for the ending). Charactors were rushed in & out or mentioned as if to finalize them but it seemed pointless. The climax was weak & the final battle was short. Through out the series Sookie realizes she is the only one she can really count on,with some exceptions here & there, but in this book all of a sudden everyone comes out of the woodwork to show they have her back, even strangers. It didn't make sense to me, almost as if a syfy fantasy took a fairytale turn. I really thought being the last book it would paint a picture as to how Sookie's life would continue or end but instead it left it open. I had read there was a twist ending so that made the ending all that much more disappointing. All in all I think the series ended leaving Sookie right where she was in the beginning of the first book. You want to see a beloved character evolve, to come out of it all learning a profound lesson that changes their life. I was really looking forward to that twist ending. I understand where the author was going with it, why she ended it the way she did & what the supposed life changing lesson was but in my opinion it was dulland yes disappointing. After all the other books in the series I would give it one star! Just my opinion.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Very true to the program Castle on TV. I just recently found out that there was an actual author going  by the name of Richard Castle. After the television show I was able to pick up on the characters almost instantly. Keep the books/ stories coming.
B00BGI076M|2.0|The twists and development was very intriguing at the start of the season, but after that it became the same tired recipe and gimicks right to the end.  The acting is good, but through the whole season the only driving character is Joe Carroll; none of the other characters (including Kevin Bacon's Ryan Hardy) ever break out of their mold or suprise you as a viewer.  I was left very dissapointed, this show had lots of potential.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Works great.......Does what I need it to do.....Highly recommend ordering this calculator. You can't go wrong with a touch screen calculator
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I liked the movie, but this is the smallest book that is pre-ring series and it is being portioned out into 3 dvd's.  I doubt that I will be buying the sequels.
0345529057|5.0|Uh.... It's A Game of freaking Thrones baby!  Nuff said. I need to add ten more words so uh yeah.
B000WF0BXE|3.0|came quick.  good quality.  when I play it on the computer it makes me change the settings to another country.  It won't play USA compatible.  I had to set it to UK.  other than that (which is annoying) it is as expected.<br />Haven't tried it on my dvd player yet.  hope it works.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I look for a game that will make my mind go and search. This is one of those games.  Enjoy over and over!
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|It worked perfectly with me It kinda took slower than usual cuz I have a lot of games . Had a rainbow dragon than it went nut and lost progress.yeah, I had to start over but the silver lining is that I got a moon dragon. Then I lost progress again.o well, after 6 times of losing progress. It sent me a letter on dragonvale and it said it was sorry and gave me back everything and got 30000 gems. Interesting.....
B0002YLC24|5.0|I think it's best to watch Before Sunrise prior to watching this movie; however, there are a few flashbacks in this movie to give the viewer an idea of what happened several years prior to their reconnecting in Paris.  I love this movie:  the acting is superb; the characters are so realistic;  they invite you to join them in their afternoon in Paris!  I have recommended this to  friends.
B004SIP8W0|5.0|If you are like me, tears do not come easily from a simple movie, be prepared. This movie will have you fighting them back and laughing simultaneously.
B008US4PBY|5.0|So, first of all, I found this product and then went all around the interwebs to find some reviews.  I was surprised to find that it is not all that popular, so I moved on.  First I decided to go to BB and find a PS3 controller that was similar to the Xbox controller.  I found one that had the same layout, so I bought it.<br />Here is what I bought. http://www.amazon.com/Afterglow-AP-1-Controller-PS3-Playstation-3/dp/B003IU01LC<br /><br />I got it home and realized that it was smaller than the PS3 controller.  FAIL!  I took it back the next day.  So I started doing some more research, and found this.... http://www.amazon.com/Gioteck-HF2-Bluetooth-Controller-Playstation-3/dp/B005AK858E/ref=sr_1_5?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1368109525&sr=1-5&keywords=gioteck<br /><br />Now, while this is actually a pretty good controller, I still was not happy.  The sticks on this controller are too........let's just call it loose.  The XBOX sticks have a certain resistance to them.  This controller did not have that.  Also the top of the joysticks are sharp and dug into my thumbs. There was a also a noticeable delay on button presses.  I call this controller, MEH!<br /><br />After failing twice, I was left with two options, this Cronus adapter, and the XCM ... http://www.amazon.com/Cross-Battle-Adapter-PLAYSTATION-3-PS3/dp/B002SGG6A2/ref=sr_1_4?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1368109693&sr=1-4&keywords=xcm+cross+battle+adapter<br /><br />I decided to give this one a try, even though I have read some terrible reviews.  I decided to just buy it from Amazon Prime in case it was a crappy as I had read, I could return it.<br /><br />I am very HAPPY to say that this product works, and I am now playing my beloved PS3, with my beloved XBOX controller.  Life is Grand!!!
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|The acting in this movie is terrific and the story contains an unusual mix of drama, comedy and love story that makes the overall movie very memorable.  I've already seen it twice, my wife three times.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I held back buying the blu ray for so long but one day I felt far too weak. I sold my Star Wars DVDs and bought the blu ray box set.<br /><br />I now wish I'd kept the DVDs as well for the special features that featured on those discs are no where to be seen here (I forgot this was a Lucasfilm release and they don't want you having simply one version, they want you to buy twenty).<br /><br />That said some of the new special features are great. There are no particularly good documentaries but little details and deleted scenes are fascinating.<br /><br />The films look great (in particular revenge of the sith and the empire strikes back).<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of the prequels. I do think there are good things in them but they seem like not enough care has been taken in their making but I couldn't just buy the originals because I feel compelled to own them all (all part of George's cunning plan).<br /><br />I changes to the original trilogy, much like previous changes, add nothing. Vader's added dialog in Jedi is heinous and the ewoks blinking is simply distracting.<br /><br />The trouble is... I love star wars. I find myself always complaining about the films and Lucas but I am drawn to them like a moth to a flame. I don't feel burnt with this purchase though, as they have made them look fantastic and ultimately that is why I bought it.<br /><br />If they were to release the films in their original forms on blu ray tomorrow I'd buy it but I am impatient and this'll do in the meantime.
B009NY43NY|2.0|This was written as if she had nothing better to do with her time. I can't believe all the years I've been reading this series and to have it end with such a boring book is upsetting. I feel it was written lazily and just because it needed to be done. Not because she wanted too.
B0045HCIZY|5.0|This is a 'must see' if you plan on watching Before Sunset.  The acting is superb as are the locations.
B00012QM8G|5.0|If you haven't seen it, then I must ask which rock have you been hiding under? You are missing out, period!!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I avoided all spoilers. Reread some of the last book. Figured out who Sookie would end up with. Didn't like the writing.  Obvious that this was a have to write it contractual book. I have read all of CH series except the Teagarden series. She has failed every time in her endings. Either end your series when you're still liking your characters or quit charging so much for a blah ending to what had been an exciting series.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I could not put this book down! I read it in one day. I had this book on my Kindle for some time now and was always putting it off. I am so happy I decided to pick it up!
B00000JXHB|5.0|This is a great selection of songs from one of the great southern rock bands, you will be swept away to another time and place listening to these classic tracks. Just because its old school doesn't mean it aint good and these are great so if you like the old school southern rock sound then get this and be ready to be taken to another time and place leaving all your worries behind.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|We love this game because all ages can play together (27 grandkids all ages), however, my daughters have created covers for the cans because the graphics are pretty bad for really young kids which, I believe, is the target user.  If you like &#34;Zilch&#34; or &#34;Farkle&#34; it is much the same idea, just for younger kids.  One of our daughters found a similar game with dinosaurs - much better graphics!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|got every part of my knife to a razor's edge, the straight blade and the serrated. extremely happy with this product.
0345803493|5.0|By far the best series of books I have ever read. Once you start reading you cant put it down,.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|As a long time Eagle fan, this is a wonderful way to remember the good times. Learning the true story of the Eagles was a treat.  They were an important part of an era of some of the best music ever recorded.
B00CDFWJIG|2.0|Disclaimer: I am a little bit of a stickler when it comes to film adaptations of books that I've read. In my opinion, if it's a popular book with a large fan base - why deviate? Give the fans what they want! I understand that books move at a slower pace and are able to be SO much more detailed when it comes to character/plot development. However, I have seen some pretty good film adaptations that have satisfied fans in the 2 hours allotted.<br /><br />\\"Beautiful Creatures\\" Pros:<br /><br />- Great cast. I thought they did a good job casting the characters. I especially thought that Alden (who plays Ethan Wate) did a phenomenal job, especially for coming into the flim last minute. He was pretty much how I pictured his character to be. Alice (who plays Lena Duchanne) grew on me as the film continued.<br /><br />- Charming set. I felt like the set captured the feel of the books - no complaints<br /><br />\\"Beautiful Creatures\\" Cons:<br /><br />WHERE DO I BEGIN?!<br />- Mythology poorly set up. \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" is the first book in a series of 3. Therefore, it sets up the mythology for an entire series. The beginning of the movie does not set up the correct mythology, and I felt confused. The book addresses the concept of destiny and how much control we have re: our destinies. Lena and Ethan are supposed to have a deep connection - where they share dreams, speak telepathically, etc. The book begins with Ethan dreaming about this girl - who he finds out later is Lena - and he hears this hypnotic song called \\"Sixteen Moons.\\" It is clear that there is a strong connection between them, even before they meet.  I felt like there was no connection between the two of them in the movie whatsoever.<br /><br />- Pace too fast. I appreciate that the film makers had to condense a like 600 pg book into a 2 hr movie, but I feel like they cut too many things. It became confusing. I found myself asking \\"why do i care?\\" I think that the fast pace did not really allow the audience toget to know and care for the characters.<br /><br />- The ending. Seriously, WTF. The ending was completely different - I won't spoil it for those who haven't read the book (you seriously should read it if you haven't), but it is an understatement to say that it was disappointing. I have issues beginning with Lena's birthday...all the way to the annoying ending \\"6 months later.\\"<br /><br />- Removal/Changing of Characters and their roles. I am not down with the Amma/Marian amalgamation. Marian is the librarian for the Gatlin and<br />Caster libraries. She was also best friend's with Ethan's mom. I felt like she was a pretty important character and I was irritated that she was removed. Amma is the glue in the family...we don't really see any of this! Amma is a seer and I felt like her role was undeveloped compared to her role in the book. Additionally, Larkin is supposed to be a dark caster...and now he is a light caster in the movie?<br /><br />- Ethan's mother. Ethan's recently deceased mother is actually really important to the story. It is realized that she was involved with a lot of caster dealings. Her death causes Ethan's father to go into a deep depression and lock himself into his office saying that he is writing a novel. The pieces that Ethan's mom left behind are important to discovering what the connection between Gatlin/Casters/Lena/Ethan and I feel like if those points were addressed the story would have made some more sense. It is also insinuated in the book that Ethan's mom may not have actually died of a car crash, but rather her death is the result of Caster involvement. The \\"spirit\\" of Ethan's mother protects him and guides him to clues that help him answer his questions<br /><br />-Lack of mystery. Kind of already mentioned this, but what made the book great (along with the lovable characters) was the MYSTERY. The movie was lacking.<br /><br />In summary, I liked the cast and I don't think it's their fault....they didn't write the screenplay. I amdisappointed with the outcome of the film plot. At some point, if it's not broke...don't fix it!
B000000OMP|4.0|Big Whitesnake fan and this is another home run for me, I know some people say the old bluesy Whitesnake were better than the more commercial sounding band but I like both versions. They are good either way and you can't help but smile and enjoy thier music when listening to it. This album from 1984 more commercial for sure and was a hit but it was the next album that exploded that was the self titled one which sold about 10 million copies. This album features John Sykes from Thin Lizzy and Tygers of Pan Tang on guitar (gosh hes good) and Coverdale what can you say but great voice so grab a copy, crank up the volume and enjoy.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this game is fun and exciting. sometimes the prizes go to the gutter and I get upset. but it is also cool to go look at what you have earned.
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|Downton Abbey<br />I choose this rating because when I watch a show and it's over, then it's over, but with this show I couldn't wait until I could see the next episode.  Just keeps you glued to your seat.
0345803507|5.0|This is an outstanding book. Once you pick it up it is very hard to put down. This is a great book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is my first read by Colleen Hoover but it will not be my last.<br /><br />This author knows how to write the perfect story. She hooks you into the lives of her characters so fast you don't have time to think before you're invested in the lives of those you're reading. I knew there was a twist (isn't there always) but I just didn't realize it would be that twisted! Colleen touches on a real and utterly serious issue that is sadly not brought to light often enough.<br /><br />Hopeless is an amazing, devastating and heart warming tale of Sky and Dean's journey of discovery, heart break and love.<br /><br />Thank you Colleen Hoover and Netgalley.com for the ARC in exchange for my honest review.
B00BMCAM6M|1.0|I must be a klutz.  I downloaded from Amazon App Store, installed in Fire HD 8.9\\"  Registered and fired it up.  It starts playing, popup comes up and says \\"Accuradio has stopped\\" although it keeps playing the music.  Kindle is frozen.  Uninstalling, reinstalling, clearing cache, etc.  Nada. Zilch.  Big disappointment.  I have listened to Accradio via browser for several years and no problem.  Just glad it didn't corrupt the OS of my Kindle.  Beware.<br /><br />Edited: 5/10/13  Downloaded and tried again, from Amazon Store.  No dice.  Does not work.  I sent a message to Accuradio and no response.  Apparently they don't care.<br /><br />Edited: 5/21/13  Still doesn't work. Tried again today.  Why would anybody mess with this when Pandora free version is available?  I am totally disappointed in Accuradio.

B009NY43NY|3.0|This was not the ending I was looking for. Sookie's life kind of turned mediocre and we all know Eric wouldn't have gone out that like that. I know a lot of people are disappointed and I myself debated on buying it, but I had to see it through. I think Charlaine's ideas just got clouded by all of the \\"noise\\" that surrounds the series. With the popularity of HBO's True Blood and different story lines of the show and the books, even the past few Sookie books haven't been that great. The first six or so are the best because the author could focus on what she wanted story to be. Oh well, it's not the end of the world.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I feel good about it.  It followed up on everyone in the end, and I have to write 7 more words for the end of a series that I have followed for 20 years.  Finnally it is done.
1476712042|5.0|Really cute love story told from the female perspective. Only downfall is that it uses profanity, but not so much that it took away from the story.
193700788X|3.0|Spoiler Alert....!<br /><br />I started reading this series after watching the first couple episodes of True Blood several years back.  I have to say I'm not surprised and am happy about whom Sookie chooses.  Many readers were hard-core fans of Eric, but he was always pragmatic and limited in the way he loved Sookie.  Sure, there were some consistency issues in the story, but there have always been a few in her books.  Some will say that it doesn't makes sense that Sookie chose Sam... I beg to differ.  There friendship continued to grow over the series of books, and she made it clear that she cared for him, (and vice versa).  Sookie wouldn't be the first 20-something to put a good guy in the friend zone for years while she chases a bunch of bad boys only to grow up and realize the nice guy will actually make her a lot happier and love her the way she needs to be loved.  Sookie's stance on possibly having kids had softened over the years too as she saw her friends grow up and become mothers (also something that happens to women in real life).  Was the writing much tighter in the first 4 or even first 8 books, absolutely, but I still enjoyed being transported to the Sookie-verse even in the later novels.  One complaint, I wish Harris had just let the fairy plot lines drop already!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|It will be another 50 years before a movie this great comes along. It appeals to both men and women, plus children.
B004I744AS|4.0|I found this app to be really helpful when I had to do some assignments for school. This is a great app to us when you need to look up definitions.  ;)
B0087X728K|5.0|Very impressed, lowered my temps by about 10c. Well worth the price. AS is now the only paste I'll use.
0316236535|5.0|I gave it to two of my grandsons on opposite coasts and they both liked it a lot.  One is 4 and one is 5.  They love the command-giving.  It's a good opportunity to role-play with kids on  how to look another person in the eye (stranger-danger or bully) and say, \\"I don't like that.  Stop it!\\".<br />Addendum:  I heard one of the boys (a cautious six-year old) practicing his strong I-mean-it  voice while in the bathroom.  It's a very simple book, but it helps kids to be able to stand up for themselves, which they will have to do.
B004I744AS|5.0|A most have app for everyone. I wouldn't know what to do without this while I'm reading it makes it easy and fun to do
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I love the movie and would recommend it to a friend without hesitation and I like the fact that you get the movie and a digital copy as well
B007A2O3FO|4.0|My mother and I enjoyed Downton Abbey so much I wanted to see another one of the writer's productions. Several of the parts were played by other Downton Abbey actors besides Maggie Smith. It was a very heart warming story.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|outstanding photography.  acting very good.  will watch it many times and recommend to friends  hope to see young actor who portrayed Pi in more films
1780721676|5.0|I have only been on the diet for two weeks, and have lost 5 pounds.  Having been on Atkins many times for several years, I am quite pleased with this approach.  Have never had real 'hunger pangs', nor have I experienced a 'low blood sugar' feeling.  Quite surprised at the ease of following the simple &#34;rules&#34;.
0316044695|5.0|An amazing story.  Sometime hard to read due to the graphic detail but impossible to put down.  The teamwork and training is truly amazing.
1451695195|5.0|I found this book uplifting for openminded individuals.  It is a subject not many people can agree on.  Eben has a way with words, even when &#34;there are no words&#34;.  I look forward to more from him.
B00CJ7EK4E|5.0|And he has plenty to crow about.  This album is, without doubt, the best offering in decades from an artist who has so much to say.  How can the pen of such a lyricist have been put away for so long? .  A personal album filled with the full range of human emotion  Heart wrenching ballads filled with love, sorrow and reminiscence, joyous upbeat singalong tracks and genuine thump the air anthems  A triumph for Rod and the genius that is Kevin Savigar  A classic Rod Stewart record. If you buy only one album this year.... this should be it.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Love this musical.  The two lead did a great job and the play is good.  They changed the characters of Meg and Raoul a bit too much, but a wonderful production overall.
0786890932|1.0|I was only able to read the first few chapters. The writing is horrible, and the characters are flat. Even the relationship between Holly and Gerry seemed unrealistic. They never fought over anything serious? Really?<br /><br />Holly and her friends are completely unoriginal. I've definitely seen these characters before. The gay hairdresser was a complete caricature.<br /><br />It's just a poorly written novel, which is a shame since the storyline gives it such potential. I read that the writer is the daughter of Ireland's prime minister. Perhaps that's why this book was published?
0399157565|5.0|I have all of Patricia Cornwell's &#34;Kay Scarpetta&#34; novels and love everyone of them. My only problem with her novels is that I read them so fast, that they are over with way too soon and they leave me hungry for more. I've never read a Kay Scarpetta novel that I didn't love.<br />M.B.

B009EP3DJM|4.0|I chose this rating because I have not finished listening to the CD in its entirety. Kesha has always had catchy fun songs.
B00CJVZB5W|5.0|TIME is Rod Stewart's answer to his 1971 Every Picture Tells A Story. An honest, personal work. Best album for years.
B005LAIII0|5.0|This is one of the best and most significant to me movies I have ever seen.  You can take it just as the story it is, or see the deeper meaning in it.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love the simplicity of this program!  It helps me keep my life together! I use it to track my busy schedule at work, help me with complex story-lines, and is now helping me gather notes for a book.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Like all war movies this one is set upon the harsh treatment by the Germans to the Jews and how man showed a little compassion to save many.
B004SH40BQ|2.0|I bought this for my brand new iPod Classic.  I needed the storage space for my tunes, but wanted the flexibility to bring it with me and listed to music in both cars that support Bluetooth.  I have a 2012 VW GTI and a 2013 Jeep Wrangler.  It works &#34;Okay&#34; in the Jeep.  It disconnects frequently and doesn't allow for advancement of songs and navigating the menu while connected.  It will not connect to my Bluetooth in the VW at all.  It pairs, but then fails when trying to connect.  Very disappointing.
B009NY43NY|1.0|This book was SO bad I found my mind consistently trying to rationalize 1)how I could hate a character so much (yes, this made me wish Sookie would just DIE, and 2)why would I ever continue reading this crap when I have been so disappointed in the past 4 books.  I guess there is some morbid pleasure in seeing just how terrible the culmination was and trying to determine which is worse- this or the ridiculousness of True Blood after the first few shows.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game!  I have had a lot of fun playing this game and I know you will like it too!
B0010OIN90|5.0|My four year old son love this watch. he was very excited to have his very own watch. and asked and tried to read the time!! Very cool and neat!!
B001NB5BXG|5.0|The Visitors by ABBA was the world's first ever commercially produced CD in 1982. This album is truly a milestone of music history in many ways.
B008P9M614|4.0|Good content, not sure of DVD quality though. DVD Tends to hang sometimes, hence it cost this product one star.
B000V7J82S|5.0|This is a reissue compilation of some great old tunes. Love the album - makes a great addition to my collection.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love this book. It goes right along with the first book. Can't wait until the next book. This book tells u more secrets than first one did.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|I received this product and used it with my existing Azden WR-PRO wireless system.<br /><br />The construction and packaging of the product is top-notch.  It feels like sturdy equipment.  Installing the battery was not as easy as it looked but still not difficult.<br /><br />However, the quality of the recording from the microphone raises a lot of questions for me.  In my tests, the tonal range of the microphone was poor compared to the other lavalier microphone I had (the one that came with the Azden).  I've also tried it plugged directly into my recording equipment to bypass the wireless system, with the same problem.<br /><br />For the price it's okay, but don't expect miracles.
1554685133|5.0|This book reminded me, as it did another reviewer, of the seventeenth-century picaresque novels in Spain. But whereas those novels portrayed usually self-serving, impoverished young men forced by their miserable circumstances into devious strategies to come out on  top, with mixed success, this novel creates a believable, thoroughly likeable boy, whose name was bestowed on him, a foundling baby, to give him a place in all three major Indian cultures, Ram Mohammed Thomas.  The structure of the book is clever, each chapter to explain the chapter in his life which prepared him to correctly answer a question in a quiz show game. A wide variety of characters and social situations people its pages, allowing insight into many aspects of Indian life. The home which bought boys and deliberately crippled them to send them out to beg and bring back their earnings was both believable and appalling, as was the chapter about a gang of thieves which got on a train and robbed all the travellers, taking all of Ram's hard-earned savings from a job working for an Australian diplomatic family. And many more, offering a panoply of detailed vignettes on a tough life, with characters who still found the resources to make lifelong friendships, enrich their lives by watching Bollywood movies many times each, and helping and defending those in need of their help, including an autistic boy who helps Ram and is helped by him in turn. Ram's success at becoming a tour guide at the Taj Mahal is funny and inspiring, as is his falling in love with a young prostitute, born to a tribe which routinely makes one daughter in each family become a prostitute.<br /><br />Tongue in cheek and sly in its allusions and inventiveness, this is a book which I enjoyed immensely, and I hope that the author will write more like it!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I absolutely love this CD! I have been listening to this CD everyday since I got it about two months ago... she is AMAZING! I love violins, and she rocks the violin!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|What an amazing and thought-provoking book!  It's irreverant (in a good way), intelligent, laugh-out-loud funny at times.  Neil Gaiman tells a wonderful story.  So many have given the plot line, so I won't, but I must say this is one of those books I wait for.  I couldn't wait to get time to read it and I hated finding time because that meant it was closer to being over.  Wonderful book.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Since they stopped making these memory cards above 2GB it was nice to see these cards for sale at a reasonable price. The service was fast and the card works well.
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|Each Album was in a sleeve with the original album cover art and the discs were perfect. Price was better than anywhere else I looked.
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|But I didn't, and even though I got it at a steal, I would totally recommend buying this flick for said full price. As a full grown adult, i'll still watch this over and over, the jokes are a cut and blu-ray/dvd combo doesn't hurt. Buy it already...
B0085HWZDK|5.0|Robert Plant is a fabulous singer (as we all know). On this DVD, he surrounds himself with stellar musicians and singers he calls the Band Of Joy to back him up including Patty Griffin (who's fabulous in her own right). The music is Americana roots music which I love. This DVD was a wonderful investment and I'm sure I'll be watching it again and again and again.

Lovely. Lovely. A little on the light side. But who cares, I find this album very pleasurable. I am impressed! Good job.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This reminds me of Myst.  It's so good if they had more stars I would give The Room more.  The graphics are amazing.  This game will work your mind and patience.  Thank goodness for the hint button, you will need it.  Very good game.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|this movie is very action packed, and it is a way to see how hard our men had to fight and all the hardships they faced.it's quite a learning experience. it is also about all the real people that fought and died to keep our country free.this is no john wayne movie so if you watch it you best be ready for it. the pacific is well done and you'll learn allot more about  world war 2 and what realy happend. it's a good buy, and theres some nudity but its not much. from___n.n.______.

B00002SSKI|3.0|Made from a copy in mexico, not from the movie producers. I love the movie it works in most DVD players not the cheap ones, and the color isn't all there like watching it from VHS on an early 90's tv, Takes me  back to my teenage years when I first saw it.
B007QVLKI2|5.0|They did pretty well on their first album.  I love &#34;Little Talks&#34; and &#34;Mountain Sound.&#34;  &#34;Love Love Love&#34; is a track I find myself going back to a lot.  Nanna and Raggi's voices blend very nicely together.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|This game rules. It has skeletons and monsters, but if you find them scary ( I do not) you punch them! If you are male you will love this game.  You can customize your character any  way you want. It is like jetpack joyride, but better!  If you put it all together it comes out#1!

B0064X7FVE|3.0|Sometimes it works, at times it doesn't. Like a female with PMS, one day it's so lovable and predictable with the weather predicting accurately to the umpteenth degree, and the next day, it pouts and doesn't tell you what's wrong. So, I have to reboot my tablet to make it work. But I have another weather app (Yahoo Weather) that works just fine, so maybe the Weather Channel gets jealous from time to time and stops working just for spite.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My five year old wanted to download this game. Well it's actually fun for all ages. My two year old daughter, my son and I all love it.If I could change one thing it would be that a level actually came to an end.GREAT GAME!!!

B000UIVRXG|5.0|I dig this flick. The main characters work well in every movie I've seen them in. The comedy is British... have to love the sometimes dry humor.

B009NY43NY|3.0|I have read every book aS soon as I could get my hands on them. This one really was the least exciting. There wasn't the usual element of surprise. I'm seriously upset by how big of jerk Eric ended up. I would rather pretend this book never happened
193700788X|5.0|A month ago I started in on this series after seeing one True Blood episode, not a fan however the books had me hooked. I get that many other fans are disappointed at the ending however to me this was the most natural ending for Sookie. From the first book to me it was obvious that she and Sam were ment to be. He was the constent in her life throughout the series. He didn't use her like Bill Eric and even Quinn. He didn't have hidden motives he just wanted the best for who she actually is and didn't need her to change to become his idea of what she should be. I loved the entire series loved the ending. So spoilers<br /><br />Sam and Sookie :)<br />Amelia's dad was the minor evil<br />Claude was the big evil<br />Eric choose money and power over Sookie and married Oklahoma<br />Bill is in a holding pattern... still
B00AF6B22E|3.0|I was very disappointed in the movie overall to say the least. With Denzel Washington staring in it I was expecting some action as is usually what his movies have but I nearly went to sleep with this one. Very much to be desired for the story line but the only thing that saved it was his acting and waiting for some action.
0385536828|5.0|I enjoy McEwan's novels - mostly because of his writing. Often not a great deal happens in terms of plot - but I like the way the characters think and can empathize with them.

Ala Jackson Brown.<br />Can't wait until they come to my area. I'll bet they are even better in person, if that is possible
B009AMANBA|4.0|We ejoyed this very much. we waited until it came out on DVD so we could purchase it. My husband likes anything pertaining to President Lincoln. Well worth the money.

Good photos, step by step instructions, patterns for the virgin sock knitter to the more complicated and challenging designs.  Very well written.  Come on, take a leap of faith and find a skein of gorgeous sock yarn that is screaming to you, and try something you've only dreamed of.  Knit up some stunning socks and you will be hooked forever.

B00CHNKJFO|5.0|I love playing pinball on my Kindle Fire HD, especially the classics on Farsight's Pinball Arcade, but Zen's Star Wars Pinball takes pinball into a new direction. Zen marries real pinball playability with computer graphics in a way actual pinball tables couldn't. The results are very addicting.  Here's hoping that Zen Studios will port its whole catalog of pin tables to the Kindle.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Because my old one broke.  If the new one lasts longer than the old one, then great! If not, then I guess I will have to buy another one.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Good entertainment even though it does not follow the book.  A bit childish at times but it holds together.  Worth watching again.
B0061S073A|5.0|I set this up for my toddlers to play with, but I worried they would accidently unlock apps or buy something.  It prevents those from happening.  There are ways for them to close out and do other stuff, but it would be more deliberate on their part, like if you go home and click another app quickly, it will close out of Kids Place.  But I do love this app and have recommended it to family and friends.
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|This is a movie I want to show my great grandchildren. I hope it will keep their attention they are very young.
B0045HCJQW|5.0|I love this movie.  it is very entertaining.  I've seen it many times on TV over the years and have enjoyed it every time I've seen it.
0385495323|5.0|There are a lot of books available on the subject of cryptography.  For the non- technical, non-practitioner<br />I think this one may be the best (though, I certainly have not read them all).  Its very readable and accessible.<br />Not boring.
193700788X|5.0|If you are so entitled as to think an author should change his or her story based on what the fans want, don't bother reading the other novels HBO has adapted. In the Song of Ice and Fire series (Game of Thrones), George R. R. Martin really doesn't pull any punches.<br /><br />Loved the book, but actually thought the ending was predictable.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Do yourself a favor and buy this movie!  Amazing!  I can't wait for the second half to come out.  The movie did great justice to the book.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|hands done amazing!! i loved the book... defaintly a page turner and so sad it eneded. recommend to all for hot romance
B0067R0APK|2.0|i loved this app...until the update.  it was simple to use and quick with everything readily accessible  but with this latest update there is too much information.  used to love it.. may uninstall...
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I first came to Clancy late in life through a movie only partially about the exploits of Dingo Chavez, but I'm very glad to have found him in Kindle format, where I can adjust the font.<br /><br />This book is fabulous, & eerily topical considering daily events involving both China & Russia.<br /><br />It is very much worth the read.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I can't believe it's over!!! I have spent many years with Sookie Stackhouse, and I will miss her dearly. I still believe it is open ended enough to have just one more or maybe a couple of short stories. I have to admit I'm not ready to say goodbye. Thank goodness there is the other Sookie universe True Blood!
B0090SI460|5.0|This movie has always had a place in my heart, and it's my daughter's favorite, too. The presentation on this is great -- someday, when that 3D TV makes its way into my home, I'm ready.
142311339X|5.0|Is the best store to buy book, games and other, I live in another country and arrived before the deadline, so I recommend
1439190275|5.0|Easy to read. Many items - background, explanation of the 4 phases, menus and recipes. I shared this with many friends.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This movie is just wonderful. I recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy or mythology type movies or is a big fan of JRR Tolkien books. This movie has it all! Hobbits and dwarves and goblins and mountain trolls! It would be fine for children, but with Mom and Dad there to help with anything that may be a bit scarey..like the trolls!! But it is not too scarey.
1476734941|5.0|This approach to dieting is amazing. This book explains how the diet works. I would recommend this book<br />to anyone who struggles with losing weight. I have been losing about 1 1/4 pounds a week and keeping<br />it off. I will probably be staying on this diet until I reach my goal.
B0040Y7EU6|5.0|I have the Seiji Ozawa version from Japan with European soloists, which is coupled with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, which is a plus, but I liked the enthusiasm that Simon Rattle brings to the Berlin Philharmonic on this DVD along with excellent soloists.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|excellent product I recommend it 100% is what is actually described, besides that is unique, I found it excellent, very good
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My granddaughter asks for this for last Christmas. When she opened this she was thrilled. Her girlfriends came over and the marathon began. Her parents, her brother, his friends, and me watched from one to eight of these within days.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Tender and sweet, this is a good, solid story. I would  recommend this  for book clubs.  Characters are endearing and the story is both tender and tragic.  Loved it!!!
B003K16P3M|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can't wait to read the other two. Each chapter had me second guessing my ideas about the story line. It kept me on the edge of my seat and reading when I probably shouldn't!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|A friend told me about it but I had to wait a over a year to see it.  Bought it before I was finished watching it on Netflix.  Recommended it to ALL my friends and they all loved it too.  We watch it over and over.  Its such a beautiful story.<br /><br />Then when we get together, we find that each of us has researched the back story.  We LOVE it.
0812983459|5.0|The Man Booker prize badly needs a refreshingly uplifting novel like Rachel Joyce's \\"The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry\\" to rid the reading public of its perception that the prize attracts only the most obscure, elitist and inaccessible titles recommended by publishing houses each year. Pity it made last year's longlist but went no further.<br /><br />The story of Harold Fry does not need recounting. What he did one morning after receiving a short letter from his one time colleague of years long past seems absurd on the surface but is anything but. It is as much an act of will as it is one of faith and courage that every man who has lost his way must muster within himself if he is to regain his path back to humanity. It may be the single most decisive thing Harold has ever done in his life and it's important that he makes the finishing line, regardless of the outcome. The journey is as, if not more, important than the destination. It is where Harold relearns what it means to be human.<br /><br />It's when his sojourn on foot becomes the subject of media attention and he gets waylaid and distracted by all and sundry along the way that he gets tired, confused and frustrated. He loses the purity of purpose amidst the noise around him. That's when the novel also begins to stall and lose some of its emotional resonance. Is the author sending us a message ? I'm not sure though I'd like to think so.<br /><br />This book has all the best qualities of literary fiction and a special charm that cannot fail to register with readers. Don't miss it.
B009T3AE1Y|2.0|I love Robet Pattinson. I have all of his movies. This one was pretty bad, didn't love it.<br />Was really disapointing.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|This is the new gold standard in super hero movies. WOW what a surprise!!!<br />Part thriller part romance part horror part espionage /terror yes this film has it all.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|I'm having fun for free and learning to play games I would never have tried thanks for all the fun.
B0000046ZJ|5.0|Any jazz lover knows this artist and the quality of his work. Together with Oscar Perterson this is as good as jazz gets.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|Really Great<br />Hope there is more of them in the future<br />Great Guitarwork<br />Great Production<br />and now a box with all the original albums
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Simply Brilliant!! This is a wonderful CD. Rod has done it again!! Way to go Rod! You have made us proud!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Great performance for the money. I game and program for school. Had to write some cryptography programs soon after I bought it and they ran much faster than what my classmates reported. It depends on your uses, but I didn't think I needed 8 threads so I went with this one over the i7, which is much more expensive. I overclocked mine easily to 4.2 GHz, but from what I've read that's pretty conservative. Up to 4.6 seems pretty common. People say Ivy Bridge runs hotter than the Sandy Bridges, but using liquid CPU cooling mine never runs hotter than 60 C at max load (Prime 95), which I'm very happy with. It idles around 30-35 C.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|The search function enters all letters twice. Nothing else I use on my Kindle does this. Wish it could be fixed. App is useless without a good search function.
B00BLYFDO2|2.0|Listening to this album is like listening to something an artist like Chuck Berry might have produced in the year 1995. There´s just no need for it (anymore). Time moves on and no one can stop it, not even Iggy.
B0000DIJO2|5.0|This is something that you can watch with kind of a sadness because of the passing of Maurice and Robin, yet it's a celebration of all that was good about these Brothers Gibb.  Captures many of their hits and the sound of this is amazing with DTS.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book was so sad and so beautiful. I had a lot of different emotions as I read this book. How could so much good come from so much bad. I absolutely LOVE Colleen Hoover! You make me believe in real life HEA's.
B001NKI60W|5.0|Love Love Love this movie.  Watch it with my kids and we sing along.  The quality of the DVD is great.  Came very fast.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Unlike any game I've played for a smart phone or Kindle, this was so enjoyable that I didn't want it to end. I wasn't sure what to expect, so I was a little hesitant to spend money to buy the game, but honestly it's one of the best couple of bucks I've spent. It's not just a puzzle solving game..it's got a hint of mystery that keeps you interested too. Honestly, it was a bit like reading a Dan Brown book! To further prevent it from being like any other game is the fact that you truly have to utilize your brain and imagination. The completion of each task leaves you with a sense of<br />accomplishment. My congratulations to the creators for a wonderfully intriguing, beautifully crafted adventure!
B005VPSEK2|5.0|POWERFUL AND AWESOME MUSIC/SOUND!! It's nice to see Kelly back in her comfort zone and having a great time rockin' it out!!!!
1401324649|4.0|Jonasson tells this wild story in a hilariously dry style, but the old man's thoughts, which are regularly shared with the reader, make the story seem like it might actually be true.  The research that went into the book is impressive and especially fun for history buffs... or for those of us who have lived through the past few decades.  Many laugh-out-loud moments.
B00AUU2KI0|4.0|It was a little confusing because the plot was erratic.  Wonderful descriptive passages!  Symbolism was more apparent<br />after the second read.  It is exciting, implausible, hard to put down.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love all three books. Very easy to enjoy them &  never want them to end. Would read any books written by her.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Absolutely love, i watched this when i was younger and now me n my daughter enjoy watching it thanks
0307341577|5.0|Dark but addictive.  As always, Gillian Flynn is flawless in making her characters come to life.  Totally enjoyed this book!
B000VM9Z8K|3.0|I enjoyed the story, although there is a lot of cursing. It was fun to escape. And it reads quickly, I finished it in two days.
B008H6GHL0|5.0|I love this format.  It's a nice variation from the live movie.  The main character is a bit over the top but that still made for great entertainment.  I woul gladly purchase other Resident Evil CGI when & if they ever become available.  Go for it.  If you love everything  Zombie, then this movie is for you.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|one of the best James Bond flicks. Love the action in this movie and he is far the best bond
0307341550|5.0|The development of the characters is mesmerizing.  I don't often find a book I wake up in the middle of the night craving to read &#34;just one more chapter&#34;.  This is the 3rd Gillian Flynn novel I've read and I am anxious for the next one to come out!!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|My original Plantronics Voyager Blue Tooth broke because I did not have a protective case for it.  With this new case it keeps my blue tooth charged and protected.  A good investment!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read it just before the first movie came out. As soon as I read the first sentence, I was hooked and wasn't able to put it down. I read all three books of the trilogy within about 5 days... I barely slept... Great books and I'd recommend it to anyone.
B0013WI0PQ|5.0|Great movie , saw it along time ago and just had to have it as part of my collection. Would recommend
B003L77FYS|5.0|Like I said before this is an excellent series. I would recommend it for everybody and I love how they get along and try to get things a secret.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you liked Myst or Riven this is the game for you. It is not just looking for hidden objects to solve a mystery but it is very challenging puzzle. When you think you finally got to the end another problem awaits. It will give you lots of enjoyment.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I was extremely disappointed in the way this series ended as I felt that the main characters all just gave up, there was no fight left.  After so much anticipation and love for the characters, the author had them all just give up, very sad.
B001FB4W0M|5.0|Fast shipping, shrink wrapped product, everything was in order, would buy again! Needless to say, it was perfect and I have greatly enjoyed watching it over and over!
B0053O89KG|5.0|Would recommend to everybody. I love how they get along and finish each others sentences and come up with the answer at the same time
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Perfect for photo editing. Use this to edit your pics just the way you like with all their avalible opptions then use your Hp eprint app to send it to your local printer and you've completed three fourths of your newest scrapbook :) I really do like this app. Lots of fun.<br />Very User friendly and so far pretty reliable. No complaints thus far!
B009NY43NY|1.0|What was the point of all these books over all these years to just put her exactly where she started. The book was a convoluted mess of just about every character ever and the ending for all of the favorites were tragic at best. So very upset this is how it ended.
B002JVWRAY|5.0|Fast shipping, shrink wrapped product, everything was in order, would buy again! Needless to say, it was perfect and I have greatly enjoyed watching it over and over!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Just love this show. I like how they get along with each other and its real funny. I would recommend this to anybody.

B00164KYV4|5.0|I loved the movie! I thought it was funny and realistic and had just enough romance as comedy. I found myself wanting to keep watching it, so i finally bought myself a copy.
B003L77GGU|5.0|Fast shipping, shrink wrapped product, everything was in order, would buy again! Needless to say, it was perfect and I have greatly enjoyed watching it over and over!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Very good. There are many slots to put your lenses and accessories in. Highly recommended.<br />Good quality bag from amazon.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|It's Adele....enough said about this extraordinary artist.  All of her first hits are included and some new ones too!  Great album.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This is a great movie.  It matures along with the characters.  If you are a Harry Potter fan, this is a must see.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|The ageless rockstar has picked up the pen and shared with the world his TIME tested secrets for the good life. This album is a brilliant collection of new music that also serves as the perfect audio companion to his recently published book [[ASIN:0307987302 Rod: The Autobiography]]<br /><br />Kudos to his lovely wife, Penny Lancaster, whom by Rod's own admission has been the inspiration for so much happiness in his life over the past decade; which goes a long way in proving behind a happy man there's a strong and supportive woman.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and purchase TIME to enjoy Rod's new music and learn some of his secrets to a healthy and happy life.<br /><br />Simple Rod lessons on this album:<br />-love that special person (She Makes Me Happy, Finest Woman)<br />-cherish life's best memories (Brighton Beach)<br />-learn to let go and move on (Its Over, Time)<br />-celebrate your accomplishments (Can't Stop Me Now)<br />-take control of your life (Live The Life, Beautiful Morning)<br />-surround yourself with pictures of your favorite people and places (Picture in A Frame)<br />-live one day at a time (Make Love To Me Tonight)<br />-communicate well with your children (Pure Love)<br /><br />Well done Mr. Stewart... again!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game, I'm 11 and I have 15 year old friends who love it!! Very challenging to keep up with! But I love the challenge!
0446547573|5.0|I was surprised to be enjoying a Nicholas Sparks book again.  The last two I read were very boring.  This books was an exception.  I read the book quickly as it was quite exciting.  Without spoiling the book for those who have not read it yet, let me just say I was disappointed at the ending.  The part about \\"Jo\\".  Other than that, however, I liked the book very much.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Once you get into the story, you can't wait to see what happens next. A good book to escape with and gives any abuse victims out there a deep satisfaction only they can understand.
B009AMANH4|5.0|I loved this movie, it was very inspiring and uplifting. It really took you back to the period and showed that nothing has really changed in all this time, just different leaders. I enjoy watching it over and over, especially when I need to feel inspired for it shows with courage, conviction and hard work you can achieve amazing things.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|it is very very very cool and it isnnot like other app it is more foun and cooler than any other app
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Easy to use and very easy to customize. Clean interface as well. I have had no problems and it is now on my second phone.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Downloaded the free app before it had so many unnecessary permissions. Each update request added new permissions. I liked the app but don't knowingly use anything that wants that much info. Uninstalled it as quickly as I could. I just want a good Bible app not a deceptive way to collect info. What happened to privacy?
B004FPE4DK|5.0|Great album. Have recommended to a number of friends. NB original release hardcopy does not include Higher Love cover. SW
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|A must have for Batman collectors. The legend never dies, Batman lives forever...and so dose the Joker! Buy one for a friend.
193700788X|3.0|I feel like some of the people who wrote these reviews are the same people who dress up with fangs at Comic con, hoping to get an autograph and hang out with their \\"friends\\" Bill and Eric.  I read all the Sookie Stackhouse books and while I LOVE the Eric and Sookie love affair, you had to know that this wasn't going to end with Sookie and Eric living happily ever after, with Sookie and Eric sitting on Gran's porch, listening to the cicadas at night.  This book wasn't my favorite, and it DID feel rushed and contrived, BUT it certainly doesn't warrant the one star ratings and hateful comments about Charlaine Harris.
0812983459|5.0|As I read the book it really made me think about my life. I began to make changes in how I talk to my husband and what is really important in my life. I asked my self the question, &#34; Would my husband feel like Harold and want to get away?&#34; It is a delightful book!
B00B3HJLX6|5.0|Without even trying I ended up buying 3 different rock records in the last yr or 2, never knowing drummer Mike Portnoy was the one variable. I guess that officially makes me a fan bc this guy seems to be able to do no wrong. The covers here are so spot on you'll have to check the dispaly to make sure you're listening to Adrenaline Mob & not the original bands.<br /><br />Portnoy fans should also seek out a band he was in called FLYING COLORS, too. Not metal, but more a 70s rock thing happening there... it is one of my favorite &#34;unknown&#34; rock records in the last 2 yrs. Like I sed, the guy can do anything very, very well!<br /><br />Peace~
B005LAIHY0|4.0|The Master did it again. A true insight. Who say's WE aren't Aliens? Check it out, the statement is clear!!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this game is great and worth the money! I played on the harder mode and found it challenging enough. recommended if you love a great mystery!
0345529057|5.0|I love the series and the price of the paperbacks.  I bought the first book at the airport, then bought the second book to read on my Kindle Fire.  BAD IDEA.  It was too hard to flip to the maps, back a couple of chapters to remember what happened to Jon, or flip forward a couple of chapter to continue with Bran's story.  For those of you who have not read the books, they are written in chapters by the person who's life it's chronicling.  It's hard to flip back and forth to the person's chapters on the electronic version.  When I saw the great price of the paperbacks, I jumped at it.  Still ended up cheaper for me in the long run and definitely worth it.
B004I4H8QS|5.0|This has been one of the very best albums I've had in my record collection for over 40 years. I updated to this deluxe edition for the digital version . This album is from Clapton's best era.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I love the movie and I ordered this 2 disc set, thinking there would be deleted scenes or bloopers, as 2 disc movies often have. Instead, it showing the (often boring) shots of Peter Jackson and the making of the movie-- which I saw on YouTube. so I was really disappointed with the 2nd disc. It was not necessary. So just the single disc movie would have been just as good.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have read many dystopian / post.apocalyptic novels and this was the best in a long while. I really enjoyed it thank you.
B009NY43NY|1.0|The writing in this series has been in decline for at least the last 3 books.  I was hoping the author would be able to rally for the last book.  Unfortunately, it was not to be. I wouldn't have minded who Sookie ended up with if the author was able to tell a good story in the process.  Way too much time was spent on unimportant details.  Please go on some more about Sookie's foliage growing.  It's so interesting!  While it was nice seeing the some returning characters, a lot of them served no purpose to the story.  Characters suddenly developing extreme vendettas against Sookie for the most flimsy reasons.  Just very poorly written overall.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark<br />Ruffalo and Samuel L. Jackson star in this 2012 action film based on the<br />Marvel Comics. A team of unique heroes unite to stop a ruthless God<br />from destroying Earth. This is a good film with a terrific cast and<br />this set not only has nice picture and sound, but neat extras.<br />I recommend this, especially for comic book fans.
B008K3N68M|5.0|Love this series cannot wait until the next set is available for purchase!  Full of drama and history!  Go get it!!!
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|I must applaud the many good reviewers that are articulate in their written reviews.<br />And I quote..Steven Soderbergh's 'Side Effects', first appears as if it's designed as a critique of psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry. Ultimately, it becomes more like a Hitchcock thriller. It's a film that keeps your interest but you'll have to suspend your disbelief quite a bit, to appreciate it.[...]<br /><br />The key players are Rooney Mara and Jude Law with  support from Catherine Zeta-Jones and Channing Tatum. Tatum must have been used for star power as he adds  little in his role. Nice work if you can get it. Zeta-Jones plays a cool icy psychiatrist. Not much depth here.<br />All the actors do a good job with Rooney Mara being the most interesting of the players.<br />All in all a good thriller that holds your interest.<br />A good RENTAL.
B000ZECQ08|5.0|I found this Harry Potter movie at a used but playable disc and at a great price. I was completing my DVD collection of the movie series and was replacing a used, rental DVD version that played all commercials before accessing the movie itself. I would recommend this movie (and price) to my family and friends.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|i cant believe that he did'nt  make it it in the usa such a humble man a bit sad the way it all turned out
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am forever addicted to this game. Love the obstacles and fast-response challenges. I also enjoy the options of having different runners.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I was worried about how bulky this case would be, but it is very sleek but sturdy. Easy to pop the Kindle in and out. I take it off for general use because the flap gets in the way a little, but it is perfect for watching movies on an airplane, which is the reason I bought it.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I found this Harry Potter movie at a used but playable disc and at a great price. I was completing my DVD collection of the movie series and found this to be as enjoyable as the first time I saw it. I would recommend this movie (and price) to my family and friends. Also, I plan to review the Blu-Ray movies for more post-movie content.
193700788X|1.0|I'm upset to see her lack of care and time in this book, she seemed tired and irriated with the series.  The villians were laughable and poorly written. The main character seemed to become shallow, self centered and not true to herself a different person than from the other books.  The fact that the magical CD changed her and her best friend to make them fall in love just after losing the supposed love of her life as sex slave for 200 years seems out of left field and cruel.  Then her first love suddenly is happy because he got to get back at the love of her life.  And the fact that the love of her life is in love with her but instead of fighting for her as is his character to fight he tucks tail and runs away because someone told him he had too, since when did he become a wimp?  I certainly missed something! I hate this book and will not buy another one of her books ever!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have always had trouble going to sleep.  I downloaded this app because it was free a while ago, and it works wonders!  Now I sleep regularly every night.  This is especially good in winter when real nature sounds are scarce.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I found this app to be very user friendly. Could use a feedback page though. Overall it is very good
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I found this Harry Potter movie at a used but playable disc and at a great price. I was completing my DVD collection of the movie series and found this to be as enjoyable as the first time I saw it. I would recommend this movie (and price) to my family and friends.
0465043577|5.0|A surprisingly readable and informative explanation of the reason risk is evaluated incorrectly today, and how to adjust your expectations accordingly.
B008NQYWC0|5.0|but I love all Mr. King's books and this one won't be any different so I can rate it before I read it. It arrived quickly, no damage. Would order from again in the future.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Best show in the entire world. All other try hard comedies like BBT can suck my d. Three more words
B001WZSBAI|5.0|I bought this Harry Potter movie at a used but playable disc and at a great price. I was completing my collection for the DVD versions, and found this movie an enjoyable one. I would recommend this movie (and price) to my friends and family.
1400067820|5.0|Once you invest in his historical references and modern experiences you can see why we under- and over-evaluate risk, and why unexpected things seem to happen too frequently. Rather than concentrate on some unacceptable risks, why play the game at all! He nails it. I wish he had written this years ago ...
193700788X|1.0|This is mortifying...<br />That's really all you have to know.<br /><br />Poor Eric, I don't know how his own creator (CH) can hate him so much?
B00A81NFAS|5.0|This movie has great actors, music, and narrative! Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence make a great team, I would love to see them in movies together in the near future. The movie is definitely the best one of 2012 and should have won best picture! All in all a great buy and the Blu-Ray quality was superb!
193700788X|1.0|After investing many hours in this series, I was sad to be blindsided in the last book.  Wish I hadn't bought the book!  Ugh
193700788X|1.0|I am so incredibly disappointed in this book. I regret having read it now. The last few books were a little weak but I was holding out hope that Harris was building up to an incredible ending. So bummed out.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Love playing this game.  Works perfect on my kindle fire.  Challenge is good to keep me playing for hours. It replaces the tiles if you run out of moves which is helpful.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have to say I started reading this at 9am today and here it is 10pm and I'm already finished.<br />The characters are real and I love them. Their chemistry is perfect, the book touches on some really awful subjects including suicide, rape, molestation and although uncomfortable to read at times, the way the author chose to handle this was genius.<br />Even the title, paired with the girls names and the tattoo -every last detail, loved it all. Why, oh why is it over?!
B001HN6922|5.0|This is my 3 and 5 year old sons new favourite movie (replacing cars 1).<br /><br />It is full of action, jokes and most importantly CARS!!!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Of course i love my Kindle charging cable.  I live on my Kindle and without that cable i am not a very happy person.
B009NY43NY|3.0|While there are new characters in this last book to the story of Sookie<br />I personally feel much info is missing from the time the next to the last book was written and the time this final book was written.<br />I feel like I am missing a book somewhere but have read and re read all of them.<br /><br />Cannot believe after all these years this is what<br />the series ended with.<br /><br />It wasn't as enjoyable as I was expecting but I'll still keep it on my Kindle to re-read.<br /><br />I hope Charlainne Harris  writes some more book in a series.
193700788X|1.0|I am going to put as much effort into my review as CH put into this book.<br />It is not worth your time or $.

B000002KHH|4.0|I had this album (vinyl) when I was a teen.  Black Sabbath in the mid 70's was tops in the rock/heavy metal arena.  I wanted to add something like this to my collection and also was interested in hearing it remastered.  The instruments seperated well and it is very clear, the old recording sounded &#34;muffled&#34; and had some hissing in the background... typical of many recordings of that era.  I especially wanted the long version of the song Fairies Wear Boots.  I give it a 4 out of five... I already liked it and I am pleased with the remaster.

B008220DIC|4.0|\\"An auteur director making an unapologetically auteur piece; an inscrutable character study refusing to neatly wrap up in an unearned tidy ending and instead leaves you questioning, forcing you to do what you never want to do in a theatre: analyze rather than empathize. This is an all-time director working at the top of his game to deliver seemingly unexplainable themes in a non-narrative non-traditional fashion, because that's the only way his stories CAN be told. I wasn't crazy about Ebert as a critic, but one of the most brilliant things he ever said that I often want to shout at people is \\"It's not what the movie's about, but how it's about it,\\" and the \\"how it's about it\\" is absolutely on another level in this film. The craft on display here is simply staggering, and people need to realize this, because it's absolutely precious to be able to experience one of the greatest directors who will ever live operating in his prime -- this is Jordan in the 90's stuff, revel in it! It's sad that what we seem to want most from our masters of cinema is the safe and conventional.\\"<br /><br />- \\"Films of 2012\\", by Alexander Veee
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Having seen Le Miz stage productions 4 times, each different, and the company now touring,the finest staging yet, I anticipated a film that would not disgrace the original. What I discovered with the Blue Ray DVD was an absolute masterpiece. Flawless casting, sound perfect, picture quality unsurpassed. This is a DVD to be appreciated time and again! One would not have to be a fan of musicals to appreciate this film!
B000VLE3GA|5.0|This IS Led Zeppelin, it gives you a very good variety of their work (and there is a lot of it).  I would say that you almost don't need any thing else of Zeppelin's but that would be ... insane?  The recording highlights Page's powerful guitar playing and brings out the piano/keyboards of John Paul Jones too.
B00AL1ONN8|4.0|T.I. still remains the king on this joint. His talent has remained razor sharp, with an excellent engeneering team.

B008DK3PJC|5.0|(Note: This review is based on the 1999 release of this material ([[ASIN:B000026D4J Beethoven: The Complete String Quartets]]). Based on the back cover of this box there is no difference in contents from the previous release, besides the packaging. I have upgraded my rating to reflect the excellence of the performances.)<br /><br />(4.5 of 5 stars)<br /><br />It may not bear mentioning for most people on this page, but these works are considered to be at the heart of the string quartet repertoire, and chamber music repertoire in general. Personally speaking, the late quartets in particular are some of my favorite compositions in all of music. They offer a singular perspective on the final musical thoughts of Ludwig van Beethoven's life, and seem to transcend time and genre. The quartets as a whole are notable for offering a fairly complete cross-section of Beethoven's progress as a composer while revealing some of his most experimental and personal musical expressions.<br /><br />Performances: The Alban Berg Quartett approach these work with a Viennese grace that acknowledges the classical roots of Beethoven's music while highlighting the energetic and frequently unsettled nature that define his idiom. In taking this balanced approach they can claim equal success in such distinct movements as the lengthy andante of Op. 131 and the off-kilter vivace of Op. 135. Technically their playing is impeccable, with excellent intonation and disciplined ensemble.<br /><br />I find myself most drawn to the ABQ's accounts of the early and late quartets. Their middle quartets are very good as well, but for some reason don't quite stand alongside my favorites (see the Takacs, Emerson, Cleveland quartets).<br /><br />Sound Quality: Sound seems to be a sticking point for this set, which was recorded between 1978 and 1983 - the middle and early groups first (in analogue) and finally the late quartets (in early digital). The early and middle groups were then digitally remastered in 1985. The sound overall is spacious, in the same vein as the Takacs cycle, but with just a bit less clarity of texture - unsurprising given the two decades separating the two cycles. Also, I find that the upper registers (violins especially) can be overrepresented and excessively bright at times, and the sound can get rough at the loudest dynamics. To my ears the late quartets benefit slightly from their later recording date, being a bit clearer and better balanced. In my experience these recordings seem particularly sensitive to speaker/headphone quality - I am much more satisfied with the sound when using my best headphones. Finally, if you listen to MP3s it is a good idea to use a high bit rate when you rip the music. Overall I prefer the sound of more recent recordings (like Takacs, Cleveland, and ESQ) but I still find these recordings quite listenable.<br /><br />CD Issues: The most irritating things about this set have nothing to do with the recording, but rather with the CDs. First, there are four tracks in the middle quartets in which two movements have been combined into a single track. This was a deliberate decision, as it is reflected in the track list in the booklet, but I can't think of a good rationale for doing this. Also, the order of the quartets may irk those who seek to easily locate a particular quartet. Early, middle and late quartets are jumbled together on each disc, perhaps in an effort to provide a program-like experience. In reality, I don't tend to listen to more than one quartet at a time and so flipping through the discs to find the one I want is an irritation. If you listen primarily to MP3s these problems are easily dealt with using basic software by creating playlists or changing the metadata, and by separating out the combined movements (this can all be done in iTunes). Then, if you plan on listening to CDs, you could burn the quartets in the desired order. For MP3 listeners proficient in iTunes or similar software these quirks will bea minor initial inconvenience, but for others it could present an insurmountable obstacle to enjoying the music.<br /><br />Price: The last thing to consider about this set is its price, which makes it one of the most inexpensive complete sets of Beethoven's quartets.<br /><br />Conclusion: If you can come to terms with the obnoxious CD issues and find the sound quality acceptable, the Alban Berg Quartett's Beethoven cycle is a great deal. Frankly, because there are some great modern recordings with better balanced sound, this cycle might not be my first recommendation for someone looking to own only one set of these works. The expensive Takacs set in particular can be seen as major competition, since they have a similarly balanced approach (without the Viennese flavor) and a similar, slightly superior acoustic. The Emerson Quartet set is now priced similarly to this one and provides a more revolutionary, less traditional approach in a closer, crystal clear acoustic. The Cleveland Quartet are not unlike the Emersons in their virtuosity and recorded acoustic but play with somewhat more sensitivity and flexibility. None of this is to diminish at all the quality of the Alban Berg Quartett's performances, which are distinguished for their intellectual and emotional grasp of the music as well as their superb technical execution. I have found that my opinion of this set improves with time, and upon hearing other recordings. In fact, I might venture at this point to name it as my favorite.

B00CATONCA|5.0|Awesome, I can buy the walking dead season 3 before it is released and it'll be shipped to me once it comes out!! Honestly, that is all you really need to know about this offer.. pesky details like release dates, and purchase prices for a box set that might not be the special super platinum deluxe collectors fish tank edition are really irrelevant. Everyone knows that the only important fans of this show will understand the need to pay a whole lot of money for a show that could easily be recorded on a DVR for free.. For that matter, its those same fans that understand the importance of a high level of suspense ingrained within the show as well as the box set delivery! Each time your mail comes, you'll experience a spark of excitement knowing that today could indeed be the day in which your purchase arrives...<br /><br />Thank you amazon, for allowing me to buy this product without any clear timeline for when I might actually get it! Perhaps while were on this subject, I would also really like to purchase a hover board like Marty Mcfly had in back to the future 3.. Im positive that eventually this device will be invented, so if there is any way I can just go ahead and give you my money now it would be fantastic! If so, then perhaps in one of the many the years to come, when the hover board is invented, you can just ship it to me.. No need to say anything beforehand, timeline information tends to give me a splitting headache that hurts real bad.<br /><br />Lastly, I am also including payment for Iron Man 8. Please follow the same shipping protocol that is outlined above so that checking my mail can be like playing the lottery.. Thank you! :D

193700788X|1.0|I've only ever read the novels in this series.  I've never seen True Blood tv show, never read the vignettes, and not followed blogs or read interviews with the author religiously.  My expectations of the genre are to be entertained, to indulge in a fantasy with the experience that in the best cases I come away with greater insight or at least thought provoking analysis for my own character in real life.  I have long admired Sookie Stackhouse because I felt like she embodied many character traits to which I think we should all aspire.  From the beginning, she fought for what was right and just, even when it wasn't easy. . .<br /><br />Until this installment.  It read to me like the author wanted to write a thirty page short story ending everything, and the rest was filler.  And the Sookie I knew disappeared.  The first ten percent of the page count contained little mention of Sookie, no action, and no real conflict driving the \\"story\\".  The introduction of a different point of view as narrator seems only like a device to introduce a voice for a new series, and well beyond the scope of what has previously been the hallmark of the SVM.  If this was supposed to be a murder mystery, it did not make sense for nearly a third of the book to occur before the dead body. There was no clear driving conflict or story arc for this to be a novel in and of itself.<br /><br />That said, I have read the stories for Sookie.  Not for romance. Not because there were vampires or magic, but for the brave, different, unlikely champion who emerged more and more throughout the series. In the end, I thought this Sookie was destroyed; the evil still was there, but all she was ever going to do was sit on the sidelines and eat and shop her way through life.<br /><br />I had come to expect the dilemma of good versus evil, with Sookie painfully navigating her way through suspensful action to regularly emerge as an advocate of justice.  My favorite stories have such heroes.  The ultimate failure to me of Dead Ever After:  this was not a story of a hero at all, and this deviation from the meta narrative I thought was driving the series, coupled with the poor writing, inconsistent story lines, and editorial failure of POV mean that this failed.  Sookie didn't save the day after all.  All the evil remains, but it's best to just sit on the porch and sip tea.  And talk.  And talk.  And talk.  And discuss.  And use dialogue to explain instead of develop a story.<br /><br />All I can think of at the end:  all that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.<br />For this reader, Sookie ended up worse off than she began the series by capitulating.  After this novel, it seems that fighting for what is right and good and just requires too much sacrifice.  Willy Loman had it right all along. . .in Bon Temps, in the end, it's better to be liked by everyone than to stand up and risk being alone in order to have an identity, or even to remain in a fight against evil.<br /><br />If you want a Sookie who sits, watches, and discusses life, this book may be for you.  If you had come to love the unlikely, flawed heroine who somehow struggled through new challenges to uncover her best self to actively defeat evil- I'd suggest skipping this one.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|Okey dokey, review #4,736. I enjoyed this. It was different from anything else I've read, but wasn't the blockbuster I expected. Sometimes, chatter and hype will do that. It happens a lot in movies, too. Some sections of the books were slow, with scenes taking too long to play out. At those times, I was okay with putting the book aside. When I did get back to it, however, I enjoyed it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book and it's me FAVORITE book so far<br />So if u get it I hope u like it
B009NG1Q96|1.0|*Sigh*<br />This is the first book that I've given a one star orlow score in a very long time. Why didn't I like it? America, Aspen, Maxon. The main three characters. I gave it one star because the book was interesting enough to make me want to finish it to see what happens at the end to lead into the next book. But I don't think I'll finish this trilogy. America was so...confused throughout the whole book that she showed no signs of improving not even in the next book. And Maxon was coming off as being a self centered nice guy/gentleman, which means he's a good douche bag that only cared about what good feelings he could get from his selection of girls. He kept going back and fourth from being too nice and too perfect to the douche bag that I wasn't sure which side of him was real. And Aspen? *Sighing* Oh Aspen Aspen Aspen. So determined to be the brave soldier and wanting to provide for the family and woman he loves dwindled down to begging for her attention ever other page when Maxon wasn't there with dialogue that was lack luster for me to get into. With enough polish this trilogy could have been great. Part reality show part dystopian/futuristic wannabe but sadly America's POV in this one became very whiny and self centered. Maybe it would have done better from Maxon's POV this book. Because reading America whining about the two young men in her life through the whole book bored me to tears. The Selection and The Elite are great ideas but for me they both just fell flat, and I say this because the Elite just brought the Selection down to a two star for me. It's been a long time since main characters annoyed me to frustration and usually they win my favor back. This one couldn't even accomplish that by the last page. So disappointed.
193700788X|1.0|Apparently, they suck the life out of you and deserve unfavorable treatment.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br />Bill the rapist neighbor and Alcide the user are actually better friends than Eric the lover/turned power hungry consort. Sookie is more concerned with making bacon than her divorce. I'm still suffering from whiplash - her love life took such a fast turn I'm still in shock.<br /><br />The Sookie I fell in love with would have kicked Freyda's ass!!! And Claude is too stupid to be that evil.<br /><br />I'm always first in line to pick up a SVM book and Eric and Pam have always been my favorites! Sam is just plain boring and shifty (with his angelic halo of curly hair and poor taste in women). So many truly memorable scenes in the SVM series and I can't recall one of those pivotal scenes with boring Sam in it (and 13 books is plenty of time to build Sam up). I get it - Sookie loves the bar, her house and a safe choice.<br /><br />I would describe this last book as Total BS - Boring s*** - with a character parade in the middle. The last few books have been lacking but after this ending NOW I get why so many characters want to murder Sookie. Ugh. So disappointed in this unsatisfying end to a once loved series.<br /><br />Eric + Sookie = Exciting page turning experience.<br />Sam + Sookie = Tomato sandwiches with no meat.
1591391105|4.0|I buy this for my new management employees and ask that they read this before showing up for their first day.

0743233832|5.0|I read a different translation of the [[ASIN:0143036270 Meditations (Penguin Great Ideas)]] a while back.  It is well known that Aurelius' writing style does not always lend itself to ease of reading.  This book cures that ill.  Scholars of the topic will probably say that it makes the work too simple, perhaps.  No matter.  If you want to clearly understand Aurelius' thinking on your first try, this is the book for that task.  The Emperor's views on death, fame and glory, are particularly clear, as he constantly reminds the interloping reader (his works were not meant for publication) that death happens to all, that it is as part of nature as anything else, it is the great equalizer and needs not be feared.  Aurelius also provides good advice on learning how to grow a thick skin by understanding that the slights of others only harm us if we let them, and to expect these slights since how else can we expect boorish or inconsiderate people to behave.  He emphasizes the idea that reason (the mind) need not be affected by what happens to the body, so that pain, illnesses and inconveniences can be borne better and maybe even to advantage.  Christians should not be afraid to read this book if they are well catechized.  Although Aurelius himself persecuted Christians and criticized what he referred to as their hysterics, presumably when they were being tortured or slaughtered in some way, Aurelius' stoicism is consistent with the Christian message of detachment from the things of this world.  Also, Aurelius was a devout Roman who honored the Roman gods.  Christians can simply substitute one God in these thoughts without loss of effect or meaning.  I don't think one can fully appreciate all of Aurelius' teachings alone; a guide or mentor is needed.  My plan is to next read [[ASIN:0674007077 The Inner Citadel: The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius]], a more scholarly treatment.  The Hicks brothers' book should be a good preparation for that.
B001CDWFPC|4.0|I like the translation a lot.  The navigation is not convenient, requiring the user always to go the the main TOC to navigate to another location. When you're following a sermon that has references to several different books, it would be nice to have a &#34;Back&#34; feature that would remember several recently visited locations. That way, I could keep up with the Pastor as he jumps around in the Scriptures.

1936608898|5.0|This book has literally changed my life. The way I think and feel about food and the way I eat and feel about myself. I think this is the single most important book I've ever read, besides the Bible. It is my food bible, and I am so grateful for it. I am 47 and am starting to feel an energy inside of me I haven't felt in many, many years. I am watching my aging parents take basket fulls of medicine and supplements everyday, just to keep themselves going. I am convicted about my health now in a way I never have been before. Food is essential, and eaten in the right way is all the medicine you will ever need.

B000FA675C|5.0|I couldn't put the book down.  The suspense and mystery of trying to solve the puzzle had me wondering. Truly gripping
193700788X|2.0|I've been torn between rating this 3 or 2 stars. I guess it's perhaps a 2.5. When I initially got started with this, I was enjoying the heck out of it, and figured on a solid 4 stars. The reason only 4 when I was enjoying it was because I was not thrilled with the format in this one that included third person segments featuring other people. It veers away from the style of the rest of the series and just felt out of place and totally unnecessary. But I was intrigued by the initial plot and was sucked in right away.<br /><br />I don't feel I can continue talking about this book without MASSIVE SPOILERS. So, if you haven't read the book and are trying to decide whether or not you want to, this is not the review for you to read. You've been warned. SPOILERS AHEAD.<br /><br />As I said, I initially found the plot interesting, with regard to the people plotting against Sookie, and with Arlene's murder. It has been obvious since at least the previous book that the author was arranging for Sookie and Sam to wind up together. It was obvious long before that that she and Eric were not going to last. If anything, that was dragged out beyond where it should have.<br /><br />I admit, I was a fan of Eric. He did a number of bad things, but compared to every other man Sookie had a relationship with, he was far and away the least abusive. That's not saying much, considering Bill fed on her against her will and raped her in the trunk of a car, paid people to attack her in order to get close enough to seduce and spy on her, and frankly, for a while I was angry that she chose to forgive him for all that. Quinn didn't have me particularly impressed either. He seemed overly pushy sexually, even when Sookie wasn't necessarily in the mood. And then he blamed her for not being able to deal with all of his baggage. It never sat right with me. Eric had many problems himself, from tricking her into drinking his blood, tricking her into a marriage, and apparently contemplating turning her into a vampire against her will.<br /><br />So, it was predictable that in the end, Sam was the one she'd wind up with. And he's okay. I don't mind him. Unfortunately, that's as strong as my feelings go, there. The way she wound up with him was sensible. It fit her character to want to be cautious and go more slowly. It was satisfactory.<br /><br />I really wasn't thrilled with the resolution with any of the antagonists. Tyrese, well, I couldn't feel bad for him. I consider his bargain to win the love of Gypsy to have been no better than rape. His rage over her suicide was obviously misdirected, but everyone could see he wasn't right in the head. Carmichael's capture felt like Deus Ex Machina, and rather abrupt. It was a bit of a letdown, having that all handled for her. And I wasn't thrilled with Sookie's decision to give him over to Pam. The worst of it was the last confrontation, though, with Newlin, Claude, and the lawyer whose name I just read hours ago and have already forgotten. I admit I had a soft spot for Claude. I felt his interaction with Hunter was a sign of at least some small spark of good in him. I can accept being wrong, and apparently I was. What bothered me was Sookie's lack of feeling regarding his end. This guy was part of her family. He'd shared space in her bed when they'd been lonely, played with Hunter. And yet she felt no sorrow over the way things turned out. Certainly she should be angry at the things he'd done, but her apathy regarding his death really turned me off.<br /><br />I wasn't thrilled with Eric's resolution. I'm not sure what I wanted for him, but his brush off seemed unsatisfactory given the prominence this character has had throughout the series.<br /><br />I will say I was pleased with Pam getting to replace him as Sheriff. For some reason I'd been expecting that to be Bill, but I'm glad it turned out to be Pam. She actually made the most sense, after thinking it through.<br /><br />So, overall, it was an okay, lackluster ending, in my opinion. There were things I liked, but a good amount was disappointing, too.<br /><br />After thinking it over a bit more, there's something else that bothered me about this last book, and perhaps most of the series.  Sookie is never at fault for anything.  Tyrese's vengeance against her is misdirected.  Carmichael's, too.  And Claude is blaming her for things that were his own or Niall's doing.  It's actually one of the major red flags indicative of a Mary Sue when people hate her for reasons that are no fault of her own.  I write some, myself, and it's something I always try to avoid.  Let your characters make mistakes, let them be less than perfect.  Let them, gods forbid, wrong someone.  Let some of their enemies have a legitimate reason to dislike them.  It weakens the story a great deal when the main character can do no wrong.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best book I've ever read in a long time. I thought peeta was going die in the games. I love this book and can't wait to read the next two.

B007PVHMCG|4.0|There is no more reason for you to buy the expensive Minecraft Lego through Amazon resellers, unless you like me live in a country where Lego doesn't deliver. It costs 34, 99 and is back in Legos website.<br /><br />The bricks are small and  would be great to have 5 instead of 1 to build a bigger minecraft world. But not for 35 U$ (neither for 50US!)
193700788X|1.0|Wow, what a fantastically sad ending to a series I had such high hopes for.<br /><br />Everyone has a flop sometimes, even some of my favorite authors like Stephen King have churned up some not so stellar novels. So I can excuse Charlaine Harris on that count. However, what is inexcusable is the fact that she went to great lengths to demean, belittle, and rape Eric's character(my favorite character and the one I read for btw)--the one suitor/character that had been present and completely supportive of Sookie and her choices for the entire series. In my humble opinion this destroys her credibility and Sookie as well because she had her protagonist use magic to determine her love for mystery suitor C instead, the guy who was rarely present when the going got tough, the guy she saw as a friend and big brother, the guy she had no chemistry with or love for but because he was vanilla enough-he would do for the long haul.<br /><br />The baffling part for me is how she got from point A to point Z. Because A to Y was telling a completely different story. For this alone I will never buy her books again because she would rather use a contrived plot to tell the story rather than the characters. But the reason she has not only lost my support, but my respect is how she treats her fans, even the disappointed ones, by placing the blame on them. I'm not sorry for reading the Sookie books because they led me to meet a lot of great people and introduced us to a wonderfully compelling and pragmatic character-Eric, who I still love and will live on in my memory in a positive way, but I rescind CH and this series. She can go peddle her bull crap to some one else.

B0095VP8D4|5.0|So up until a few months ago I was running a dinosaur of a desktop computer, an old P4 Dell. I finally had enough money to build my own PC. I managed to build a new computer, with this APU and 8GBs of ram for under $350.00 from NewEgg (the total cost includes a case, PSU, APU and ram).<br /><br />Let me just say this APU is simply amazing! This little bugger runs everything under the sun and then some. Almost my entire game library runs on Ultra with no problems at all, when I used to have it run on the lowest settings possible. I can run Saints Row the 3rd on Ultra with just the APU and it runs fantastic. Higher end PC games will run great on medium or high settings, this is all using the built in GPU of this processor.<br /><br />To be honest there are still some things this little darling can't do on it's own (running Skyrim on Ultra using TriDef 3D for 3D support) and I plan on buying a new GPU for that, but besides that if you need to upgrade and you are trying to save money this is a great alternative to the expensive and often over rated Intel line of CPUs.<br /><br />I'd recommend this APU for medium to sometimes even heavy gaming. You won't be sorry picking this thing up. I am using the factory heatsink and have had no problems with this, but I have not tried to over clock it yet.

193700788X|1.0|I don't need to necessarily reiterate what everyone else has already stated but I did want to put out there how disappointed I was in this book.  The fact that this series started out so great and then ended this way was awful.  Spoilers::  Even if she didn't end up with Eric - her relationship with Sam has always been one of friendship and nothing else.  I'm not sure Charlaine thought it through because their \\"relationship\\" (if you even want to call it that) seemed very rushed in the book.  I was 85-90% into the book before anything even came up about Sam wanting Sookie.  The story was boring and I was upset that there was no closure with Eric at all - after so many books of them together as a couple - I think we loyal fans deserved that.  At least this was the last book and I don't have to feel torn about whether or not to buy the next book in the series.  Hopefully True Blood on HBO will make up for this terrible ending to Sookie!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|There are some obvious reason the PBS Masterpiece production Downton Abbey is so fantastically popular.  1. The story moves fast and has many twists and surprises.  2. The characters are very engaging, if not all good hearted.  You want to be friends with them, even the ones who make life difficult for the others. 3. The settings are rich and opulent, from the castle to the small Yorkshire villages to the scenes in London.  The same is true about the elaborate costuming.  4. The music grabs your heart and directs your feelings with memorable melodies and grand orchestration.  5. The acting is spot on.  The very competent actors infuse the dialogue with every nuance of meaning possible.  Although the notables might be Maggie Smith (lights up the screen every time she appears) and Dan Stevens (sweet and gorgeous), there is not a weak characterization in the very large troop.  It is beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, and don't we all need beauty in our lives?
B007EC27QM|5.0|Awesome.  Better than a traditional calculator. Love the touch screen and love being able to see my work to verify it.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series was referred to us by a relative who enjoyed it. This is not the type of show my husband and I enjoy and would never have watched it without the recommendation. We started with series 1 and struggled just a bit getting into it, but half way through the 1st show, we were hooked and looked forward every evening to getting settled in with 'our show' and watched 2 sessions each evening. When series 1 was over, we went immediately to the 2nd season and on to the 3rd, even tho the 3rd was still new and we had to pay for it. Loved this series.

1439190275|2.0|This book seems to push the products more than the diet and lifestyle change and honestly, having used the products, I think they stall weight loss. I think the older books are much better because they weren't out to make money by pushing the foods with the Atkins name on it. Which is what I think the new people are doing, with the Dr gone. I'd recommend skipping this and buying the old 80's or 90's original.

B00975LEJK|1.0|Do NOT buy the MFSL vinyl of this.  The leadout runs right into the center label which not only sounds nasty but is obviously bad for your needle. This happened to be my first, and last, MFSL pressing.  I gave them that feedback, and they didn't even seem to care. I buy hundreds of new vinyls per year and was shocked they would have that attitude towards potential new customers.<br /><br />Otherwise - this could be my most loved desert island disc. Lush, melodic, dreamy, catchy....do yourself a favor and just buy it!  This is my 3rd format (cassette, cd, now vinyl)
0345529057|5.0|The TV show Game of Thrones caused to to purchase all four books.  I have never regretted it and I am still reading a Feast of Crows.  These books may take a while to read, but when reading them it won't matter because they are so good.  At this price for four books, it doesn't get any better.  These books will take into the rough and dangerous world of Westeros following several different families as they fight for control of the Iron throne, the chair of the King of Westeros. Contains power, intrigue, deceit, dishonor, and general bad behavior. No act is taboo, no character is completely a saint and don't be surprised for wanting a character to die, there are truly despicable people in the books.  Caution: do not get attached to any character, even minor characters because they will probably be killed.  I'm not finished reading all of the books, but many characters I liked are dead.  There are no clues or build up, they die.  Another thing, if you get large amount of characters confused, Mr Martin has nicely put a glossary in the back of all his books.  It's okay to flip back there for names and places, there is much to know.  Westeros is divided into seven kingdoms.  People who like Action/Adventure, Science Fiction, Romance, and fantasy will love this series.  I am not a rabid fan of fantasy or science fiction, but I got hooked.  PS: Prudes, do not read this, there are graphic sex scenes.

B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Normally I tend to ramble on and type a lot. First, the people who didn't like it. In my humble opinion I think its just silly. One review, although a very good review, said Cruise was short, something about his nose, and his personal life. Well, lets see?  First he was getting a 100 million a film for how many years?  Every film was a huge hit and allowed him to make that kind of money. Yes his love for his now ex or soon to be ex Katy seem to be his undoing a bit. I for one could care less if he jumps up and down on Opera's couch and declares his love for his woman.  I would have.  Who cares?  This movie has nothing to do with his looks or his personal life.  I did not read the book, nor do I care to. I watched this movie cause I wanted to see Tom Cruise play something different.  It was not a 100 million dollars in special effects, explosions and crazy car scenes.  It was just Tom on screen most of the time, good plot, the chemistry between Cruise and the District Lawyer was great. But not over the top.  No sex scenes, no romance for the sake of having it. They had humor on and off through the whole movie which was perfectly timed and it made me laugh.  I thought Tom's personality for this character was spot on.  His dry humor was also just spot on.  And I loved the fact that they added Robert Duvall even though it was a small part, but still a part that was needed and he came in towards the end and did a great job. A side note, Cruise and Duvall paired up for Days of Thunder, where on David Letterman (I think?) Robert Duvall said Tom Cruise was the most generous man he had ever met in his life. This was just after the making of the very cheap and awful Godfather III.  The two had great chemistry together on film then and I cant believe it has taken them this long to work together again. This was a good thriller, good plot, great acting and most of all it was believable. Nothing that made you think \\"oh special effects\\", or \\"no way that could happen\\".  It was just Tom Cruise in a jacket, pair of jeans, on a mission to do what he thought was the right thing. A good conspiracy theory, and great action.  I loved the fight scenes.  Nothing over the top with flips and crazy stuff.  It's all stuff with training in the MMA Gym most can do. With a ton of practice of course.  It was just good fun and I was entertained the entire time. And I just felt it ended to quick. I would love a sequel.  If you like Tom Cruise I think you must see it.  I think its funny that some people talked about how he looked.  This guy got best looking man alive a few times.  Gee?  I wish I looked that bad with the girls....lol  lol  Watch the movie and enjoy....Tom Cruise in a jacket, pair of jeans, on a mission to do what he thought was the right thing.

B009T8XBBO|5.0|This is the best game I've installed on my Kindle Fire.  It is as good as or better than the pc version.  I have this game and two sequels for the pc.  If they adapt the sequels to android, I'll get them too.<br /><br />The only con I've noticed so far is the amount of time it takes to switch to the next level.  The screen goes blank for several seconds, but it is tolerable.
1476733953|2.0|Wool starts out alright but unfortunately goes downhill from there. One thing that kept bothering me was, \\"why no elevator\\"? As the story progressed, I had to wonder, why at least, didn't IT have a secret elevator and if no elevator, wouldn't these folks have evolved to the point that they'd be stair climbing machines? Seemingly, hundreds of pages devoted to climbing stairs and how hard climbing is, were just overkill.<br />My other concern was, of course, the evil Americans destroyed the world and put everyone in silos in order to keep America pre-eminent? Typical \\"liberal\\" nonsense. If the author had have made the bad guys Green extremists who wanted to rid the planet of humans until it was renewed, with Global Warming reversed and these people could emerge from their silos into a new Eden, maybe that would have had some credibility. As for the novel's concept of \\"cleaning\\", it didn't make any sense that anyone would have arrived at this convoluted nonsense as a way to rid the silos of human \\"viruses\\". The psychology that a untrue view of the world would get everyone to clean the camera lenses before dying is utter silliness. After everyone in Silo 18 came to their senses, I couldn't believe they couldn't have fashioned a vehicle or an expedition for the return to the other silo. Why would Juliette risk her life in the same way again? I don't think even people in the future would behave like these folks did.<br />I dunno. All in all, the story is pretty weak, not that well conceived or written and too long for what it, in the end, delivered.
B00B7G23KQ|3.0|not real scary, almost the same as the others.  boring, repetitive, and few scary scenes.  I felt like I was watching all the prior ones.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a calculator it does what it is supposed to do. I am happy with using it I can get what I need done and that's enough for me it's not like it's a super app or anything
0756686970|5.0|I love all the DK books. The pictures are wonderful and the fun facts make it a great gift that grows with any age enthusiast.
B00B5A9FOG|5.0|The journey for Merlin and Arthur continues for the fifth and final series. The first 11 episodes are good entertainment. The last two are very good. If you've been following the series from the beginning, the last episode is very emotional. SPOILER: According to the legend Arthur is killed by Mordred. But Merlin doesn't tell Arthur he has majic until this last episode. The writers had many chances to let Arthur know in previous episodes. We never get to see Arthur rule with Merlin's majic at his side. They never show Arthur as the once and future king of Albion. Other than that the DVD is still a very good one. Colin Morgan won the National Television Award in England for best actor in a dramic series.  I had the privelege of meeting Colin last summer at San Diego Comic-Con 2012. What a terrific actor and also a very nice guy.
0786715103|4.0|excellent book ... chilling and a stain on humanities pious blouse
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|So I thought he would love the CD, and he does!  This was an early Father's Day gift for him.
B00BCJ1AXE|5.0|This CD is awesome.  The music is great and has more than one hit that is playing on the radio currently.
B008OOYALE|3.0|This game is everything the other reviews say-- fun & addicting! If you have patience it's quite possible to play without spending actual money to advance.<br /><br />HOWEVER...<br /><br />Kindle users beware. After playing for awhile you'll start to notice that many of your \\"neighbors\\" in the game have things that aren't available to you. Unfortunately for whatever reason, TeamLava is releasing update upon update for iOS users and to a lesser degree, android users with nothing new coming to the Amazon marketplace. Their excuse is that Amazon has a tough approval process for new apps/updates, but whatever the reason.. just be forewarned that you will probably feel left out and even a little resentful when you see all the cool new dragons and features that everyone except us gets to enjoy.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I like the quick action in the game. The colors are great. and the sounds are great. It makes you want to play more.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book was well written. It held my attention and presented a most interesting ending. I would recommend it to people who enjoy stories about struggles with life situations that let us feel the hopelessness of many lives.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice and big can use without my glasses.  Fast and easy to use. So handy.  I love this app.  Does what it says.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I friggen LOVE this movie. Super fun, super cute, and funny. I really enjoy some of the throw-back references most of all.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Face book on my pad is just as good as on the computer.It is nice that I'm not strapped down to play just as home.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So competitive if you connect with Facebook and great fun. Even better its free!! One of the best game I have ever played on my kindle
B00B97SNJI|2.0|I have liked some of their music before and was looking forward to this CD.  It sounds like songs Jackson Browne would have rejected for his Late for the Sky CD however long ago that was.
1616550414|5.0|It is what it says it is.  Not much else to say that hasn't been said about this book.  If you are into Zelda in any way, shape, or form, just go ahead and order this and be happy.
030746363X|5.0|I read the book and it had a lot of helpful hints.  I still practice much of the info I read
0062238868|5.0|A true to life account of what it was like going to war and surving it.  Don't be afraid to try it.
0143122916|5.0|It is a page turner. I always suspected this is what's been going on in North Korea. A fascinating tale.
B004SBQALA|4.0|Although a little slow in the beginning the story becomes non-stop until the end. SiFi lovers will really enjoy and can see a follow up in the works.
1476734941|5.0|I saw the program on it and found what I expected.  However they had good menue plans.  they also had a lot of motivation.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|love this CD! it has been an amazing experience!! 10 songs that moves me in every level! just loved it!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I cried and I laughed out loud! My husband and I enjoyed it together. We are parents, so it was a lot more touching to us in that sense.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|Great Movie and a whiff of childhood, God Bless Angela Landsbury and her co-stars. A great movie for sentimentality and some fun.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I am not going to give anything on the plot story, the book description narrows it down enough.  I just had to voice how terribly disappointed I was with the end of this series.  The series itself started off so good. I couldn't put the books down and was able to overlook that Charlaine does not have the best editor nor does she seem to remember the rules she created for her world.  Then as the series went on, instead of becoming more intriguing, they began to seem like a whole book of nothing.  The few somethings that would happen were only mildly interesting and could fit on one page.  I had hoped that after the last 3 books, this final book would be some sort of redemption and it would blow me away.  I felt nothing for any of these characters that I have read for so long.  By the end of this book I didn't care or like most (if not all) of them.  Now I wish I hadn't bothered to read this series that I had recommended to so many people.  I understand that if you are this far in the series, you need to know what happens, but please prepare yourself to be completely let down.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|It is a convenient one .. it's quality is suitable for the price ... it is nice having amazon trade mark on it :) ... i liked it
B000J2BRQU|5.0|Excellent Movie.  Can't wait for the next installment on Memorial Day this year!  Love the series though 2 and 3 weren't the best.
B000002VMH|5.0|If you have any Annie Lennnox love in your heart buy this album. It is Wonderful and the talent just lilts off of it. My favorite track is \\"Money Can't Buy It\\"; but I bought the album for \\"Walking On Broken Glass\\" and it is wonderful too. This is an album you don't mind keeping in the car because every track is perfect.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I was first intriduced to this series with the Bloons TD 3. Since that time the series has grown and matured and added new modes, towers, and complexity that keeps the game fresh after all these years. This is a fun and addictive game that is family friendly.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This grabbed me from the very beginning, and held me all the way through. Great character development and a well written story.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This album is totally amazing.<br /><br />As a lifelong Rod Stewart fan I did not expect anything less.<br /><br />However, I have invited friends who were not Rod fans to listen to this album and all 5 of these people have now ordered the album.<br /><br />At age 68 Rod has self-penned 11 of the tracks recalling parts of his life, he does this extremely well with such meaning and soul.<br /><br />Thanks Rod, you've done us very proud.
193700788X|1.0|Absolutely nothing happens for the first 42 percent of the book.  There is little mystery, suspense, or plot.  Even the one very short sex scene is ruined by lines like &#34;we slid against each other like seals&#34; and &#34;I'll ricochet you.&#34;  Absolute sloth on the part of the author.  I will never let myself get hooked on her characters again.
0744014549|5.0|This book is amazing, each illustration is a work of art, the color schemes, the light, atmosphere, etc. No wonder the game is great too. It is good to know that there are books like this where the artist behind a game can have al least some recognition.<br />Besides it's a very thick book, a LOT of amazing drawings, totally worth the price.
0061544493|5.0|Absolutely loved this book<br />Had a lot of good fashion tips in it<br />Be warned: much of the products/apparel listed in this book are expensive
0345803485|3.0|Just okay.  I read it because it was all the rage, but it didn't blow my sock off.  Happy I have it in my collection, but that's the extent of it.
0545265355|5.0|I love the fact they are hard back and that they came in a set. I like the box to keep them in and they came in excellent condition.
B009NY43NY|5.0|SPOILERS**** I am apparently in the minority, but I loved it. Thank you for not making Sookie a vampire. Thank you for following along where this story has OBVIOUSLY been heading...to her finding love with Sam. Thank you for tying up many loose ends. And thank you for the amazing gift if the Sookie Stackhouse novels. I couldn't have asked for a better end.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is great!  It looks cool. Both this and the weather app work well together. I like the slim line clock face. I leave It on at night in night stand mode and it is easy to see. Not too intrusive. Best clock app available. I have them both on Fire and on up iPhone.
B001N09BDS|5.0|I have watched it twice on DVD and it is one of my favorite movies. I put it on my watchlist for Amazon instant. I am an aviation buff but it was still great just as a classic movie lover. With the time period it portrayed it felt like a classic movie. Leonardo's portrayal of Howard Hughes was great, Cate Blanchett was great, I fell in love with Kate Beckinsale and a nod to Christina Aguilera for being classic sexy in her scenes. Roger Ebert gives it 4 of 4 stars and \\"This is one of the year's best films.\\"<br />[...]%282004_film%29#cite_note-15
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|From the very first note in \\"She Makes Me Happy,\\" this album screams ROD'S name. It has the distinctive instrumental notes that lets any fan know that Rod had his hand in every part record production. The 30+ year fan will recall what made them a fan in the first place as this album certainly brings back Rod's classic vocal sound. This album has a way of bringing together the diverse sound that Rod has displayed throughout his amazing career--it will sure delight fans from each generation. It is a purchase that is well worth every penny!! Way to go Mr. Stewart!!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I love these types of stories, but line flops around too much.  Not much suspense to keep you intested in &#34;What's next&#34;.
1416549447|5.0|I have only been running for a year. I bought this book hoping it would help me with my endurence and breathing. This book is very imformative and a lot of help to make you a better runner.
B009NY43NY|4.0|A fitting end to the Sookie saga. A few surprises, sure, but a lot of the developments a fan would see coming. The writing has been on the wall. We see Sookie doing what she does best, survivng. With a little help from some welcome and recognizeable friends. Sad to see her go.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game nothing else like it<br />The game keeps me playing continuously I never get bored playing it I can't get enough of it my cousin put me on to this game
B0073XORCY|5.0|Excellent album, surprisingly good in fact! This record really sounds like a bona fide follow-up to the original Thick as a Brick, and has quite a few great songs that would fit in perfectly with Tull's TAAB-era music.
B008476HBM|2.0|Stopped reading after ten chapters.  Suppose Sci-Fi and Fantasy are more interesting to me than this &#34;gossip&#34; soap opera (manipulative) type story.
0062235893|1.0|I purchased the Cloth book version of this story to give to a best friend who just gave birth to twins.  BAD CHOICE.  I'm glad I had it shipped to me (so that I could add it to a basket I was making for her) instead of shipping it directly to her.<br /><br />1)  This item is poorly packed.  I'm sure Amazon has the best of intentions when it wrapped a piece of cardboard around this for shipping, but the gift box itself arrived badly dented and not in gift-giving shape.<br /><br />2) I don't know how to put this nicely, so I will just throw it out there: WHERE IN THE HECK DID THE REST OF THE STORY GO?!  It has two tiny blurbs and 2 illustrations.  That is it.  Most of the story isn't even included.  Why on Earth did this version cost more than the others when the whole story is not even included?  What exactly is the point?<br /><br />This is going directly BACK to Amazon.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THE CLOTH BOOK VERSION OF THIS! I don't ever say this, but if I could give it no stars, I would.
B00004XPPE|4.0|One of the first great apocalyptic end of the world movies. Great cast, Great story, Henry Fonda and Larry Hagman. Their scenes together are classic
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Could not put it down!  You may not agree  with Victoria's choices, but to walk a mile in her shoes was a real eye opener.
B00377V6IS|1.0|Since February of 2006, I've had a love-hate relationship with Opeth.  This honestly has annoyed me a lot over the years because at least with run-of-the-mill nu-metal and metalcore sewage like Korn, Killswitch Engage, or Disturbed, I knew immediately to loathe them after some extremely unpleasant exposure, but with Opeth, I've been constantly conflicted on whether or not to like them because they're not they type of band to be outwardly annoying.  The band certainly has tasteful musicianship going for them and the overall sound of their music isn't really all that offensive, but at the same time, their music usually didn't stick with me and usually lacked cohesion.<br /><br />STYLE<br /><br />The style of music in \\"Blackwater Park\\" is best described as progressive metal with strong influences from 70's progressive rock mixed with death metal vocals.  On paper, this sounds pretty ambitious and sounds like an idea that can be executed well.  Unfortunately, the execution of this album is quite lousy, which I'll get to in the topic below.<br /><br />On a sidenote, people need to stop calling Opeth \\"progressive death metal\\" because despite the presence of death metal growls on the music, there aren't many (if any) death metal riffs in their catalog.<br /><br />LACK OF COHESION<br /><br />I say there's a lack of cohesion on this album because with all of the different musical ideas Opeth has on here, there's almost no cohesion among them to have the songs flow smoothly.  Because of this lack of cohesion, listening to it becomes quite a chore.  While listening to the songs, you try to get yourself set up into a certain emotional state according to what you hear, but then the song transitions into something totally different and does so abruptly.  This wouldn't be bad if the band's goal was to create something feeling chaotic (such as Behold the Arctopus, their instrumental compositions are chaotic in all the right ways), but because Opeth tries to be \\"beautiful and poetic\\" much of the time, these transitions from something \\"brutal\\" into something more \\"classy\\" feel really uneven and after a while, you just disconnect yourself from the music and get bored with it.<br /><br />MUSICIANSHIP<br /><br />Mikael Akerfeldt's vocals are a bit of a mixed bag here.  His death metal growls are okay, but they don't even begin to compare to what Martin Van Drunen, Karl Willetts, Alex Camargo, Matt Karki, Ross Dolan, and Jeff Walker can dish out.  His clean vocals seem pretty bland, since I couldn't remember much of any of the clean singing parts that stuck out at me.<br /><br />Mikael's guitar work isn't bad, but like with the music in general, lacks cohesion and focus.  He's capable of making compelling metal riffs when he feels like it, and the solos in many of the songs sound nice, but the disjointed styles in many of the songs make them pretty forgettable.<br /><br />Peter Lindgren handled the guitar as well on this album, and like Akerfeldt, has tasteful skills with his instrument, but other than a few riffs from the more \\"aggressive\\" songs and solos, most of his contributions lack memorability.<br /><br />Martin Mendez's bass guitar, honestly, wasn't all that noticeable in most of the album.  There were some parts of some songs where there's some noticeable basslines, and they sounded nice, but that's all I can say about that.<br /><br />Martin Lopez's drum work, like Mendez's bass, didn't stick out to me all that much, either.  I guess his drum work isn't bad, but given the overall forgettable nature of the music, it's hard for me to draw any specific examples addressing the drums.<br /><br />I know that Steve Wilson of Porcupine Tree fame (I'm not a fan of PT, either) helped produce and provide extra clean vocals on some songs.  The vocals Steve provides on this album were pretty bad.  I think he provided extra vocals in the song \\"Bleak,\\" and they made the song sound even more of a chore to listen to.<br /><br />SONGS<br /><br />Remembering specifics for the songs on this album proved to be as difficult as mastering advanced calculus, so forgive me if there's a lack of detail in describing the songs on here.<br /><br />I think for an album that only has eight songs on here, it's too long for its own good (considering it's eight songs in a 67 minute album).  Now I'm not against long songs, as there's bands like Symphony X, Dream Theater, Burzum, Pan.Thy.Monium, and Phantasmagory that have crafted long songs that go past the 10 minute mark that remain compelling to listen to from beginning to end.  Even Opeth created a superb song called \\"Black Rose Immortal\\" (off the album \\"Morningrise) that's 20 minutes long, and isn't at all boring.  However, on here, many of the longer songs seem really disjointed for me to stay engaged in.<br /><br />If I had to choose any songs that I'd consider decent, I'd say \\"Blackwater Park\\" and \\"The Leper Affinity\\" come close to that.  Despite being two of the longer songs on this album, the \\"metal\\" parts on these songs come closest to what I want to hear in any type of metal album, and with the title track, has probably the best guitar solo in the whole album around the middle of the song.  However, the potential greatness in these two songs is greatly hindered by the \\"soft\\" segments of the songs that don't really fit in with the aggressive parts.<br /><br />\\"Harvest\\" is basically a six minute acoustic piece with clean singing.  The solo in the song sounds pleasing, and the overall feeling of the song is inoffensive, but the song is pretty forgettable at the end of the day.  \\"Patterns in the Ivy\\" is merely a two minute acoustic interlude that functions no more than as filler.<br /><br />I couldn't stand the song \\"Bleak.\\"  Mainly for Steve Wilson's guest vocals mentioned earlier, but while songs like \\"Blackwater Park\\" had better \\"metal\\" segments in the song, the metal parts in \\"Bleak\\" felt pretty lukewarm, so this was a really boring song to listen to.  The other songs like \\"The Drapery Falls\\" and \\"Dirge for November\\" were good examples of the songs that are long and felt like they were going on forever.<br /><br />PRODUCTION<br /><br />The production on this album is very clean, though I think it's more fitting for a progressive rock album than for a progressive metal album.  Then again, Steve Wilson produced the album, so he obvious wanted this to feel more like the former than the latter.<br /><br />The instruments and vocals all come in pretty clearly, except for the bass.  I personally wish the bass was more noticeable than it really was.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />\\"Blackwater Park\\" commits one of the worst crimes a metal album can commit, which is being boring.  Most of the time, I was staring at my wristwatch waiting for the album to end.<br /><br />It took me nearly four hours to write this review because the music contained in \\"Blackwater Park\\" is too forgettable to quickly gather my thoughts and write them out in detail.<br /><br />Many people will tell you that this album is a masterpiece in progressive metal or worse, will tell you that this is \\"progressive death metal.\\"  Avoid this and check these albums out instead.<br /><br />Nocturnus:  The Key<br />Atheist:  Unquestionable Presence<br />Coroner:  Punishment for Decadence<br />Phantasmagory:  Odd Sounds<br />Death:  Individual Thought Patterns<br />Cynic:  Focus<br />Gordian Knot:  S/T<br />Behold the Arctopus:  Skullgrid<br />Gorguts:  The Erosion of Sanity<br /><br />Why people go ga-ga over this is beyond me.g specifics for the songs on this album proved to be as difficult as mastering advanced calculus, so forgive me if there's a lack of detail in describing the songs on here.<br /><br />I think for an album that only has eight songs on here, it's too long for its own good (considering it's eight songs in a 67 minute album).

B001JNNDAQ|5.0|This is a classic hands down. Gene Hackman is solid as a cop who keeps pushing the case against the advice of his command.  Roy Scheider is a good fit to be his partner. The story never really slows down or stops. Its also interesting to see how police methods have changed with advancements of technology.  The balance of action and drama is just right. You won't be disappointed.
B005LCECU6|5.0|This record may very well be one of the best live recordings ever, or at least in a long while.<br />All Rush live records have something good to offer ( favorites are All The Worlds A Stage,Exit Stage Left and Rush In Rio ) but this one is showing a young hungry band playin with raw intensity!<br />Get this if you like good classic hard rock played well live.
0446547654|5.0|one of the best stories I have read lately I recommend it to anyone who likes Sparks books I gave it to my sister to read she loved it too
B003G4W49C|4.0|As soon as I began to read Ender's Game, I was hooked. I didn't want to put the book down and when I did have to (due to work or school) I would think about what was going to happen next. It's a great science fiction but more than that, it tells a story we all know. One we all face every day. Check it out and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
B00683JLXA|2.0|This is obviously just a rip-off of Angry Birds. The people who made that game need to call their attorneys. I liked Angry Birds, but I'm giving this two stars because it just isn't as good. A boring waste of time and money. Just get Angry Birds!
B0000D9R1P|4.0|A tad disappointed  didn't realise some songs were live . But I must say I enjoyed most of this CD .
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Good story.  Hard to believe how awfully his child  hood was  HAPPY ending  . Writer done a good job hard to put down when reading.
B00AJAFNIA|2.0|my sister got the free version....no idea how lol i think its a nice little game EXCEPT it is really looong to get to the top i some what agree its spy ware not sure since didnt purchse full version lol i keep looking at reviews to see if i should actually get it aaaand i dont think its right for Liquid Entertainment to post fake reviews giving themselves fivestars my opinion since at the bottom there are lots of five stars then one stars
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome I play it all the time I am on my kindle fire I would rate this app five stars every day
B009NY43NY|3.0|As sad as I was to see the series end, I wish CH would have put a little bit more oomph into this final book.  I could tell it was starting to go downhill with the last 2 books, and I had a funny feeling that this one wouldn't send Sookie out with a bang.  I have read a few reviews of some readers who sound pretty upset, but I don't think the book was all that bad.  The characters have come full circle, yes, but look how many books have been written.  People change, why not characters in books?  They can't act the same over a span of x amount of years, and I think it would be pretty boring if CH would have kept everyone the exact same as they had been in the first 1 or 2 books.  Sookie has always had an interest in Sam, and it goes back to some of the first books.  They've always had that chemistry but the timing was never right.  Sookie had been trying to block reading the thoughts of shifters, to stay out of peoples' heads..maybe she finally got good at it.  I liked Eric just as much as the next reader, but realized they would never really end up staying together.  A clean break was the best for both of them, and that's what CH did.  I don't like how short the book was..I think she could have given us a little bit more story in there.<br /><br />With the Sookie books that CH wrote, the good outweighs the bad in terms of how well the series was written.  You could tell her heart wasn't in it anymore, though.  However, I am glad to have read the entire series and think she did a good job pulling the books together.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This freaking game is complete bull s*** it goes way to fast when you get done with one board you die if you hit one obstacle and stumble and hit one right after you die in other words they don't give you a chance to recover you just die and when you finish a jetpack you hit am obstacle so if the maker of subway surfer I wish you could please fix all the stuff stayed in is review that would be great
0399226907|5.0|I love the illustrations and the way the book is designed.  It teaches counting, names of food, and some basic science.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so addicting i play it all the time. i think its a very good game! now my mom and dad play it all the time too. they love it also!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is a good usb cord.  It works good with my kindle charger.  I would recommend this to other people.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The only way to get past some of the pop up ads is to quit the app, then restart. The only option offered is to click through to the ad site.  Game is nicely implemented. It does not provide a notice when there are no more moves.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome. I love this game. I play it everyday. its just fun to play.  I love horses and I love the whole game aspect.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|My case is very durable and love the color! I like that you can fold it pretty much in any way and it goes back to it original shape without it ruining the case.
0385523912|4.0|As you get in the story, you feel you are one of the characters (non-fictional) and you feel the hardship.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the first two books in this series and for this reason am giving it a very positive rating!!  I can't wait to read it and would be happy to send a review after I have completed reading it.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I really wanted to like this last book in the series, especially after the previous book had left me rather heartbroken. I hoped that Charlaine would pull yet another miracle out of her hat for Sookie and Eric at the same time taking us ( her devoted fans) on yet another spine tingling ride to see The Sookieverse crew solve a murder mystery . But alas the journey ended horrendously askew for me. Spoiler alert here- Eric , the fabulous , heroic Viking Vampire with the hidden heart of gold and wit as sharp as his fangs - was given no chance by Sookie ( or Charlaine ) to reconcile with his fairy / waitress lover. Instead he lost his faith in Sookie ( and honestly who could blame him after the last book , when Sookie dissolved their bond) Yes Eric sold out his shredded /jaded self as a slave / consort to the vampire queen and had to leave everything he ever held as valuable to go exist in another state with her. Sookie then settles for a \\"safe \\" and convenient temporary relationship with her long time boss Sam. The mystery murder plot line was just ok , pretty predictable and bordering on almost satire of some of the other characters. Overall everyone involved behaved as if they were on an overdose of Prozac and were just going through the motions of their lives cocooned in cotton wool. Plus the quote \\"happy ending\\" promised was actually only a one night stand sort of a scene suggesting that Sookie may or may not stay with Sam, but oh wait you have to buy Charlaine's next book to be sure of how that relationship will play out. Sorry Ms. Harris but at this point I just don't care enough to find out. ( or purchase it) PS  I did purchase and read all of the previous books in this series.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Tom Cruise nailed this role! I predict that this could be the next Borne trilogy! I absolutely love him in this role, it really showed off his tuff guy side. People need to stop tripping because they may not like the personal and religious choices he has made in his life! That does not take away from his acting skills. Tom is a dam good actor period! I love you Tom and I hope you keep this franchise going because I would definetly like to see more adventures of Jack Reacher!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is good on so many levels I don't know where to begin. The author is really trying to work a lot of stuff out through writing or she is truly one of the most creative people I have ever read. Hilarious, sociopathic, suspenseful, calculating. Loved it.
B009NY43NY|3.0|While I too was disappointed with the way the series was wrapped up, and thought it was a bit short on action and suspense, the book itself was not a bad read.  Like always Sookie and Bon Temps are enjoyable to visit.  I could criticize Ms. Harris plot and ending choices, but honestly these characters are not my vision.  Regardless of whether or not the story went in the direction I wanted it to, its still a decent effort.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I got so much information out of this book,  I definitely enjoyed the read, but can no longer enjoy meat or where it comes from...{ Factory farming }
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|I had the great fortune to see this great band at the ProgHouse in New Jersey this week during their brief, first US tour. Riverside live exceeded expectations.  A great band, tight, relentless and man did they rock the place in their own inimitable way. The live sound does not differ greatly from their albums as the production is clean, clear and magical. Mariusz Duda is a great bassist and works magic in his multifaceted playing. He controls the fret board like few other rock bassists.  His voice is one of the greatest currently in rock and really elevates Riverside to spectacular heights and gorgeous sounds.  Piotr Grudziñski similarly is masterful in coaxing his guitars with tightly weaved leads and notes that are majestic, powerful and yet, totally under control.  It was the best live show I have seen in years. (And that is not a knock to the great Steven Wilson show I saw the week before).  Not to be missed!<br /><br />Shrine is another progessive/rock masterpiece from Riverside.  I cannot get it off the player currently. There is a wonderful progression that Riverside has and is making into a world class band. Of course, only a few know how good they are, as seen in the reviews above.  The songs on Shrine show a maturity that is refreshing, less intense than some of Riverside's earlier efforts but, as expected, each song goes places that no other band goes. Shrine of New Generation Slaves is a knockout. Cannot recommend Shrine or the Riverside catalog highly enough.
B001C4AFOY|4.0|I have a renewed interest in the current British royal family, and thought I'd see what the movie industry has to say about one of their ancestors. This movie imagines what it's like to be a young heir to the crown from young Victoria's perspective, and the almost impossible odds of actually finding love with your governmentally chosen spouse. Victoria was the focal point, but Albert was who I wanted to know more about. I wound up thinking I'd marry him myself if she didn't. I would have liked to see more about their twenty years of marriage in their positions as the queen and prince; the movie ended too abruptly for my taste. It's like the first ten chapters of a book with thirty-five.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book gives perspective on what really matters.  I enjoyed the writing style and character development.  Be kinder than you need to be.
B006LSZECO|5.0|When I think about it, the plot is no different from the movies or tv shows or other books I've seen and  read.  But the author has a purely genius way of crafting the story you don't want to put the book down.  Cliche as this may be, but it is really a page turner. One minute, you're siding with one lead character, and after a few chapters, you swing to the other side.  And finally, you don't know whose side you shoulld be empathizing with.  And the last part, ooh the ending, you'd be \\"forced\\" to think if that\\"s how you want it to end.<br /><br />I hardly get affected after I read a particular novel.  But this one, got me all worked up.  I've seen many reviews and there's a myriad of feelings on how it ended. Some were too angry and too emotional.  My highschool teacher said, literature is suspension of disbelief.  If you were too caught up with the book, it felt so real and brought a lot of varied emotions, it's a good read.  That was exactly how I felt when i was reading this, and days after that (I can't get over it!  haha) The writer flirts  with words,  her characters' thoughts are provoking -- simply superb!  This book is worth every penny!
0140544518|3.0|I like the story, but the pages of the book weren't cut all the way. Unfortunately, it was a gift and the recipient is the one who discovered the defect.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I couldn't put down this book. It's so good, that keep up 'till I finish it.<br />Congratulations, Mr. Baldacci<br /><br />.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I don't normally enjoy watching cartoons, but this one is laugh out loud funny. It's a very cute story as well.
0618001905|5.0|King Leopold's Ghost is the riveting account of one king's quest to turn the Congo into his personal fief. This is non-fiction that reads like fiction, replete with robustly developed heroes and villains and a suspenseful and well-paced narrative arc. And lest one think that this book privileges drama over historical accuracy, the author draws on a vast array of primary source documents in crafting his narrative, the most interesting of which being private journal entries. Shakespeare himself could not have created a character more duplicitous and avaricious than King Leopold. The Belgian monarch is forever solidified in my brain as one of history's worst villains; I knew nothing of his greedy exploits before reading this book. I recommend this without reservation to anyone with even a remote interest in the history of colonialism in Africa. This is absolutely one of the finest works of narrative non-fiction that I have ever read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really like this game...its a good time waster when you're waiting....also very addicting. Try it I bet you get addicted too
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This series does an awesome job of following the books. For once, a series that does the book justice. I can't wait for Season 3.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|Got this for my GoPro and love the accessibility of the Skeleton housing.  It makes it easy to connect the power adapter and remove/change the SD card.
B009X01FJS|4.0|I like this product.  It really does protect my Kindle.  I've dropped it a couple of times and all is well.  The flipping device is great and so is the standing device.  Both work great on a table top.  Holding it in your hand is heavy however.
B000077VR3|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.<br />I would recommend it to everyone I know and I give it 5 stars.<br />Best movie ever.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This version is much better than the one I have on my laptop.the previous version did not work as well
B000056HUA|5.0|Great sound for a famous blues rock album ! The mix 5.1 is well done and I don't miss my purchase.
B0066QQ8DA|5.0|I had already all of wolfmother works on cd, so I decided to listen to it on the turntable, I bought it used , and I got a new one thanks to seller !
0671449028|4.0|I think this is a book for toddlers who may try to resist going to bed.  My daughter said her children really loved it. I think after going through all the activities these animals go through to get ready, anyone would have several laughs  and also be more than ready for a good long nights rest.  They also are on a boat, so that is a good thing to talk about. Are they on vacation? Do they<br />always live there?
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Fits my kindle snuggly and feels and looks great... Just like a notebook. The stand feature of the cover is also quite nice.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This was a great solution for me since I don't have a smart phone.  This syncs with my calendar, then  I can use it off-line when I'm out.  If I make changes, it updates my g-calendar when I get back on-line.  Love it!!
0425263908|5.0|Great book couldn't put it down! Cant wait to read the next book I'm sure its just as great as the first book!
0679809015|5.0|I bought this as a baby shower gift.  It think it will help with animal identification, colors and counting and most important, it is a fun book to read, with a surprise behind every door. Being small and &#34;chunky&#34; it should be easy for a child to handle and &#34;read&#34; himself.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely satisfying.  I am eager to find Christian Grey in my household, it has brought LOVE alive in my marriage.
0385341008|5.0|\\"I have gone to [bookshops] for years, always finding the one book I wanted - and then three more I hadn't known I wanted.\\"<br /><br />I want to give this book a hug and skip on the sidewalk with it, holding hands. I loved the storyline, I loved the idea, I loved the time period, I loved the style in which is was written... I simply loved this book. Two points Liz for the recommendation! It was a great one for Book Club :) .<br /><br />Yes, the name is a little crazy, but The Guernsey Literary and Potato Pie Society by Annie Barrows & Mary Ann Shaffer is such a treat. The book is written all through letters. Much like my beloved and top three all-time favorites Dracula, I love this style of letters (although Dracula has journal entries and such as well). The colorful characters, the setting (Europe & post-WWII), it was so easy to get drawn into their lives.<br /><br />January 1946: writer Juliet Ashton receives a letter from a stranger, a founding member of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. And so begins a remarkable tale of the island of Guernsey during the German occupation, and of a society as extraordinary as its name.<br /><br />After one letter I kinda fell in love with Dawsey. Just throwing it out there. And in my book you can fall in love with fictional characters. And Juliet! Her sarcasm kept me laughing and we could totally be friends. I've been known to practice the art of sarcasm on occasion.<br /><br />You should read it! It's romantic, heroic and enchanting!<br /><br />P.S. How fun is it that aunt and niece worked on this together?!?
1596680180|5.0|This book helps you to come up with original ideas for necklaces and bracelets.  I made one for a young girl in a wheelchair and she loved the colors and braid design I used from this book
1452110581|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my cat-loving friend and it was a big hit.  It's hilarious.  I will definitely buy another copy!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|What a great love story.  This is one of those books that are very very hard to put down.  I recommend!
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|This was a fabulous & family friendly movie that I wouldn't hesitate to show to the younger generation.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|This is a turn based game.  The object is to take and hold the opponents bases by building warriors and moving them to enemies bases.  I think this is one of the best turn based strategy games out there
B002SRQ214|4.0|It's Fast, It's cheap and has four cores.<br />It builds heat very quickly under load and the stock cooler barely keeps this thing in check.<br />Under full load, the heatsink fan speed ramps up to an ear splitting 6000+ RPM.<br /><br />Underclocked to 3.2GHz and Undervolted to 1.375V all in an attempt to keep Power Consumption, Temperature and Fan Speed Down<br /><br />I couldn't buy more processing power for the money :)<br />Get a quieter cooler if you can...
B003VANOFY|3.0|Battery life does not seem to be as long as advertised and my device would occasionally disconnect randomly when the USB device is connected to the power base instead of directly into the PC.  Otherwise, product is great.  It has a long signal range and its very comfortable.
034580404X|1.0|really!!!! maybe for people who have not read really hot books. new and trendy but not a good read or well written.
B002XZNHG4|5.0|This is a comedy classic that should be seen by everyone who has experienced the emotional swings of navigating a complicated new intimate relationship.  Diane Keaton steals the movie in this one.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|This show is spectacular Acting is superb I hated to see it cancelled!!!!This had to be one of the sci-fi channel's big hits.  The feds will keep the memories alive for me.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|my sister has one of these, so I knew what I was getting.  I am completely satisfied with this product.
0385361661|5.0|This book is gorgeously read. I mean it, if you listen to it in the car, you'll run out of gas, because you won't want to stop. Tons of talent here. Entertaining story, too.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|This stylus offers three tips in progressive sizes for a wide range of uses. For me, the stylus provides extra dexterity that compensates for my physically disability. Touching the Kindle Fire HD screen with the stylus allows greater accuracy. The stylus is comfortable to hold and easy to use. I would like the tips to be just a bit more rigid, but that is my personal preference, hence 4 stars instead of 5. I highly recommend the AmazonBasics Multi-Tip Stylus for its versatility and quality manufacture.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My entire family loved this series.  We do not get Masterpiece Theatre so we had to order.  Can't wait till season 4 comes out on DVD!  Not happy losing Matthew at all though!!
1617751588|5.0|This book is really funny and better yet it comes with stickers of the kitten! I love these books and I love the videos on YouTube as well. Having a book though makes it more special and there are things in the book not included in the cartoons. Definitely worth the buy especially if you have children (or cat people friends).
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A great app one of the most useful on my Kindle Fire. Accurate and easy to read. Gives a very reliable indication of power remaining in the battery. Audio reminders are very useful.
0385349831|5.0|I think it is one of his best works yet. A fascinating backdrop, for the profound wisdom to be found by readers, to be formed around.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|I bought this after hearing ac couple of the songs on the radio. Easy to listen to and good lyrics..
0545128285|5.0|This is a great book and also very easy to read. It is perfect for children or any Harry Potter fans. There are notes after each story by Dumbledore. These are classic stories much like the Grimm tales of our past.
0385394233|5.0|This book is beyond amazing. I am ready to take on the world. I have never been so inspired!!! My only regret is that I didn't read it sooner.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|This is an exceptional copy and captures the very best of the production; it has the best artist and I believe the if flows better than other versions out there.
B009NY43NY|5.0|So I am an addict!  Story rocks will probably read series again.  Sad to see it go but this book is great
B001DEXDNI|5.0|Annie Lennox is one of my favourite female vocalist and her sound is so pure and clean and true it makes you want to weep... anyone who &#34;likes&#34; Annie Lennox should get this CD and elevate that to &#34;loves&#34; Annie Lennox!
0525951652|5.0|I chose I love it because I have not yet been disappoined by a Ken Follett book, and I am hoping this will be no exception.  Have not read it yet, but I have heard from at least four people of its greatness.  Can't wait!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|If you haven't sen this series, you must. If you are already a Sherlockian, watch this brilliant update and be thrilled by the great writing, terrific cinematography, character chemistry, awesome actors, intelligent stories, and the Best British Cheekbones in the BBC. Many many wonderfully geeky references to the original Arthur Conan Doyle tales. If you're not a Sherlockian, you will be once you've seen this.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I heard the music watching the movie and decided I wanted to hear more I play it over and over great songs
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I love the gameplay and graphics.  the upgrades are interesting.  and levels are hard.  a great free game if you don't mind the file size
0553328255|5.0|I first read these stories back in ...ah... was it??? High school? Back in the Dark Ages, anyway, and have enjoyed various film and TV versions randomly since. With my immersion in the BBC series, I thought it best to revisit the original tales (the folks doing the BBC series are the utmost Sherlockian fanboys ever, and include many many references to the Doyle canon). This set is a convenient carry out size (pack it anywhere to read while waiting in line), a good price, and contains every single bit of Sherlock ever written by Doyle: 56 short stories and 4 novels. (I have another book that contains just the stories published in the Strand Magazine with the Sidney Paget illustrations, nice, but it doesn't have ALL the stories). A must for anyone who's fallen in love with Downey and Law in the films, or been thoroughly Cumberbatched by the BBC series.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This worked perfectly on my Kindle Fire.  Just make sure you have enough space to handle 300MG's.  That may be the problem some were having.  Interesting, spooky and cool.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I'm a HP fanatic so I love all things HP. This set is an unbelievable value. The seller actually sent me a different set, mine is the 11 disc instead of the 8 at no extra cost. There isn't much to say, it's Blu-ray quality and the sound is great. Order and enjoy.
B004132HZS|5.0|If you're already a Sherlockian, be awed by the brilliant geekfest that is Moftiss (Steve Moffatt, and Mark Gatiss, who brought you Dr. Who). This is TV as it should be, brilliant, funny, thrilling, and the best cliffhangers ever... you'll need season 2.<br /><br />If you're not a Sherlockian, you will be once you've been Cumberbatched...
B000093BDX|5.0|Wonderful.  Like and remember almost every song and takes you back to my youth (American Bandstand in California).  My daughter heard it and hates it, but too bad.  She can keep her talky rap, I'll take the Beach Boys any day.
B005HEGQQ6|1.0|I got charged for it but didn't get to watch but about 10 minutes of it because it quit working and I paid for nothing.  BEWARE!!!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|If you expected another angrybirds 5000 level game you arnt getting it. it specifically says in the title friends! meaning co-op. if you dont have a facebook dont play it but dont resent rovio either! so what theyre getting in oj the fb trend, just play the original and dont downvote this because youre against fb.
193700788X|1.0|I'm sorry Ms. Harris didn't care enough to put any effort into the book after all this time. The book seemed like she was just trying to end it and get that checked off her to do list.  Sookie and Eric will always belong together and  neither deserved to be cast the way they were, fiction or not.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|My daughter loves these blocks.  Yes, they are pricy but they are super cool.  We had played with these blocks at Imagination Station and then found them online... LOVE them!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|It gets a little more challenging as the levels are completed.  You have the option of skipping through the story line if you so desire.
B002WYJHBA|5.0|And this wonderful movie even better in Blu-Ray with the colors and the textures. This movie is a classic for us.
193700788X|1.0|Southern Vampire Mystery?<br /><br />Southern: Yes.<br />Vampire: Few and Far between.<br />Mystery: No.<br /><br />This book was far too predictable to qualify as a mystery novel.  There was also no attempt at romance.  I finished the book and couldn't figure out why it was written.  Buyer beware!
B00A2AU0KI|5.0|Clint Eastwood did it again,&#34;Trouble With The Curve &#34; go check it out. The package was well done and it protected the item. Thanks.
B000001Y5D|3.0|Still don't know why I got it, the wife likes Morphine and chocolote, me, not so much.  But I got it.
B00CBKXGPI|5.0|Art Mogul is straight forward. You find hidden objects in fantastic art, and strategically wheel and deal in the art world.  I have  often been inspire  to fin  out more about many of the 900 paintings in the game. The music is great as well. The concept is unique, and I would  love more games like this. Thanks for a job well done g5!
B006LA6IW2|5.0|American Sniper (Enhanced Edition)  is a good read, get it and enjoy, that is if you like events like this. The package was well done and it protected the item. Thanks.
B008QOFOQW|4.0|This was very cute and I was surprised that they had Lego's for girls.  The little girl I purchased it for was very excited and opened it up and began playing with it so I take this as \\"It was a hit\\".

0307165485|5.0|I love Richard Scarry's Best Storybook Ever.  I cannot begin to count the number of times I read this book as a child myself.  The stories are wonderful, and the graphics are beautifully done - with bright colors, and very cute animal characters.  This is a keepsake book that I wish I still had the original of.  I lost my book, but have now purchased a brand new one from here at Amazon to give to my Grandson-to-be.  When I received it I couldn't help but smile and look through it...  I read a few of my favorite stories once again as well.  I can't wait to read some of them to my grandson!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|It<br />s A GREAT MOVIE.I wanted it for my collection.Fast service, good price.Will recommend to others,keep up good job. Good store.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|There's not much to say because it speaks for itself- loved the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings...kudos again Peter Jackson!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|A remarkable read. Thoroughly engrossing from beginning to end. The authors seem to anticipate the readers needs and affection for Pendergast and carry us on a journey through the depths of his mind and soul and yet leave us longing for more. Looking forward to the next installment!
0802473156|5.0|This book was very good.Will recommend you to others. good price fast service.,Keep up great job, will tell others about your site..
193700788X|1.0|I have been a fan of these books since before I started watching True Blood, so this is completely disappointing to me on so many different levels. Charlaine Harris really seemed to have phoned in these last 3 books. The continuity discrepancies, which to be honest have always been a problem for Ms. Harris, were completely atrocious in these last 2 books especially, but were a disgrace in Dead Ever After. So many other reviewers have already pointed out some of these inconsistencies, so I won't bother with all the details. I will say this though: The character assassination that happened in this book was such a shame. The Sookie I came to love, the woman who fought for what she believed in and those she loved, was nowhere to be seen in this book. She became a bigoted, whiny, sniveling brat who thinks about nobody but herself. The mysteries in earlier books were nowhere to be found. I had the entire plot figured out in the first 2 chapters. BORING!!!!!<br /><br />Why Ms. Harris chose to have Sookie have to live next door to her rapist for the rest of her life is beyond me, not to mention having Sookie KISSING HER RAPIST AND LIKING IT!!! What a slap in the face to all sexual assault survivors. Let's not forget what you wrote Ms. Harris: Bill raped and nearly drained Sookie in the trunk of that car in Jackson. For Sookie to try and say that she never really loved Eric was disgraceful. For Sookie, who hated the blood bond for so many books because she felt it made her feel things that weren't real, to be fine with the cluviel dor making her change her feelings for both Eric and Sam is a complete out of character moment.<br /><br />Ending Eric's story the way she did was disgusting to me. To have Eric be a sex slave to a woman he can't stand for 200 years, when he already had at least 100 years of being raped by his maker is a travesty. To try and get us to think that Eric was just going to give up and give in to Freyda is not something that sits well with me. Eric, the1000 year old viking vampire, who always has plan b,c,d,e, and f to go to, to just say \\"ok, I'll be your sex slave for 200 years\\" and not have a problem with it is completely out of character. Having Eric not be able to have contact with the only 3 people he cares for was such a terrible and degrading ending. Eric was the only male in this entire series who truly loved Sookie for who she was and had the potential to be. Every other male character in this series mentally, physically, emotionally, or sexually abused her at every turn. To just get rid of Eric without a fight is unfathomable to me. If Ms. Harris really and truly loathed Eric so much, she should have just written him off many, many books ago instead of building his character to be so loveable . Why not build up Sam's character? I feel like after reading this series of books, each of them 8 times with the exception of the last 2 books, that I really don't know anything about Sam. He was a minor character at best for the entire series. But, Ms. Harris knew that Sam was boring, Eric was her ca$h cow, and Sam's boring character development would never sell the books the way that Eric would. WHY ON EARTH IS IT A GOOD ENDING TO HAVE A RAPING PEDOPHILE WIN FROM HIS GRAVE???<br /><br />I could say so many more things about this book and this atrocious ending to a series that I truly loved, but what's the point? Charlaine Harris doesn't really care about anything but her pocket book, why on earth would she give a damn what her faithful readers thought with the last book? She gets her payday no matter what. All we're left with is questions...
B000VWE5OY|5.0|This album was an extraordinary accomplishment by these talented musicians. There was not a bad song on the whole album. I am patiently awaiting thier next album.
B00BQ1D91E|3.0|The only real issue I have with this album is the production quality. The songs are catchy and the vocals are strong but add all of it together & the sound is very disappointing.
B005FMZX9Q|1.0|THE BELT IS SO SMALL, SO I CAN'T HAVE THE WATCH SO LONGER.i'm not happy at all with this purchase.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|This album has such a great sound. i liked every song on the album. I can see why they won a Grammy.
0307341577|4.0|Gillian Flynn has captured the pure essence of character building in this book. She'd have had a good story with even half the work she put into Libby, her brother, and the other people in this tale. I also loved that she did such a great job of building on characters who are bruised, used, and otherwise utterly imperfect. This was an enjoyable read that kept me guessing for quite a while. I do believe I've been sold on this author.
B005URRCUY|5.0|Outstanding musicians producing some amazing music. All the songs on the album could stand alone as a single. I am patiently awaiting thier next venture.
030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl is a well written novel about ugliness that teems beneath the surface in the most seemingly perfect people. This was a very good read. I didn't like it as much Dark Places, as the characters aren't as likable, but that's part of the point of this book. I can honestly say that I'm very much looking forward to this author's next effort.

1623150825|5.0|Sales is not just for used car dealers and advertising pitch-people. Sales is an integral part of our lives that transcends our every activity, from winning friends and changing minds at work, to dating, to convincing children of superior ways of interacting through parenting,  to nearly every daily scenario where you are convincing one or more individuals that your position is superior. These daily forays into personal sales and teaching the reader how to be persuasive in them, are the purposes behind Daniel Pink's seminal work \\"To Sell Is Human\\", effectively summarized herein.<br /><br />In this book the author will take you through the modern-day version of the \\"ABC's of sales\\" which has evolved from a concept of \\"Always Be Closing\\" to a response more personalized to those you are trying to sell to, with \\"Attunement\\" (listening and customizing your response to meet the needs of your audience), \\"Buoyancy\\" (overcoming rejection and staying consistently positive) and \\"Clarity\\" (seeing the big picture and being proactive in solving problems for your client and/or audience).<br /><br />With this book's information, those of us who do sales at home and in social situations rather than boardrooms, can better grasp the process and concept of personal sales.

1250012570|3.0|Eleanor & Park is one of those books that you think will be a light and fun read about first loves, and it is partly that, but it's also about families, courage, strength, and fighting for what you feel strongly for. I really enjoyed Rainbow's writing style, even though it's very different from what I usually read. I love how she took these two misfits, made them fall in love, and experience something real in their lives that changed them forever. I was kind of sad with the ending though and wished there was more, but it was symbolic, I guess, which is probably what the author was going for.<br /><br />I adored Eleanor & Park's relationship. It was a bit weird sometimes, I have to say that, but then again, what young, teenage relationship isn't weird, to a point? There definitely isn't a lot of talking between these two at the beginning, but as their walls come down and they find common interests, their relationship grows and develops into something so pure and beautiful, you can't help but fall for them as a couple. I loved how they shared a love for music and comics, it was so sweet. Yes, things seem rushed and sometimes I kind of felt like there wasn't much to their relationship, but that's usually how young, first love is.<br /><br />Eleanor did bug me a few times, with her anger issues and the fact that she wasn't really there for her siblings, but I understood where she was coming from. Still, I definitely would've liked to see her be there more for her siblings. Park, on the other hand, was a great character and such a sweetheart. He had his faults and wasn't always the most sensitive guy around, but for his age and circumstance, he was just right for Eleanor.<br /><br />If you love contemporary novels with a different spin on them, then you'll definitely want to give this one a chance. The feelings I got while reading this are reminiscent to when I read Perks of Being a Wallflower. Eleanor & Park is a poignant, genuine take on young love, life, and family that will easily capture your heart.at will easily capture your heart.

0385535147|2.0|I listened to this as an audio book and it was moderately entertaining I guess.  (Deep sigh; decided lack of enthusiasm)  It's hard to take this novel seriously because the plot is so convoluted and implausible.  It's one of those novels where an elaborate plan is hatched that requires a remarkably unlikely series of events to fall perfectly into place and if even one piece is out of sync the whole plan will collapse in on itself.  But of course, all of these improbable pieces come together perfectly, in completely unconvincing fashion.<br /><br />The far-fetched plot was a problem for me, but one I was prepared to accept, with only occasional eye-rolling, to keep my mind occupied while I was in traffic.  But of course, that isn't the only problem I had with the novel.  One that is perhaps even harder to ignore is the reality that Grisham is simply not a gritty enough author to write convincingly about criminals (unless they're of the white collar variety of course).  It's comical to listen to Grisham's dialogue involving drug dealers, something he manages without the use of a single swear word.  Grisham is better off writing about small town lawyers.  His street hoods and drug dealers sound like characters that belong in an episode of Murder She Wrote.<br /><br />The whole plot is preposterous but I kept listening to it so it must have been entertaining enough I guess.  Grisham is trying to write something clever, but it comes off as silly and mostly predictable. It feels like he isn't trying very hard.  2.5 stars.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I just love all of these books! So far this on is good, but by far my favorite book is book 3.
0451232852|1.0|I started this novel but just couldn't do it and gave up part way through. I understand that this series is hugely popular, and in fact, the book was lent to me by a coworker who is a fan.  I have to admit, the novel was highly readable and I found the pages turning quickly.  It became an issue of quality for me.  As I was reading it, I just kept thinking 'This is just a big old cheesy soap opera'.<br /><br />It was hard to read because my eyes were always rolling. Take this sequence from the end of Chapter 2:<br /><br />He gazed back at her. \\"You are absolutely enchanting,\\" he said in a low voice; then he kissed her again.<br /><br />This time she pushed him away. \\"My lord, what are you doing?\\" she said in a shocked whisper.<br /><br />\\"I don't know.\\"<br /><br />\\"But what can you be thinking of?\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm not thinking at all.\\"<br /><br />She stared up at his chiseled face. The green eyes studied her intently, as if trying to read her mind. She realized she adored him. Suddenly she was flooded with excitement and desire.<br /><br />\\"I can't help myself,\\" he said.<br /><br />She sighed happily. \\"Kiss me again then,\\" she said.<br /><br />I read a few more chapters after this, but it was just sooo baaad. I guess a lot of people like this sort of thing but it just doesn't appeal to me.  I found the writing pedestrian, the dialogue clunky, and the story too melodramatic for my tastes.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Nowhere near as good as the stage show, but a different take on a classic musical. I woulda picked some different leads---maybe singers that can act vs actors who can kinda sing
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very addictive game. Loads of upgrades and boards you can get but sometimes it lags and is unresponsive when other games are fine
B007MDQW3W|5.0|Russian-born émigré and Bronx, New York resident Regina Spektor has been one of the most eclectic talents on the music scene since her 2002 debut album SONGS.  Of course, these days, the term \\"eclectic\\" seems to be anathema to most corporate radio programmers; and this proved to be the case for WHAT WE SAW FROM THE CHEAP SEATS, which once again displays Regina's penchant for combinations of rock, cabaret pop, and minimalist jazz, combined with a solid piano technique and a fairly wide vocal range.  It just couldn't get the kind of attention it deserved from radio.<br /><br />Just the same, WHATH WE SAW FROM THE CHEAP SEATS sold well enough (and rightfully so) and ranked among a lot of people's Top 10 favorites for the year 2012, and that includes me.  Regina's about as far removed as it is possible to be from Taylor Swift (in her pop phase), or even Norah Jones (who has since worn out her welcome, at least with me).  Even comparisons to Lilith Fair-era artists like Tori Amos or Sarah McLachlan won't suffice, not after hearing just the first two tracks, \\"Small Town Moon\\" and \\"Oh Marcello\\" (with its literal lyrical borrowing from the Animals' 1965 classic \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\"), and, later on, \\"All The Rowboats\\" and the very pointed \\"Ballad Of A Politician.\\"  Not only is a lot of Regina's music on this album eclectic; one almost has to classify a lot of it as being deliberately funny and satirical, even, dare it be said, kitschy.<br /><br />But then that's all the more reason for fans of unorthodox pop music to get CHEAP SEATS, and all of her previous albums along with it, and leave the corporate radio stuff behind.  CHEAP SEATS is a winner.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I happen to enjoy Science Fiction, and have, for the last 50 years. I'm a former Marine, a former Video Game designer (continue to be a Gamer and dabble in level design) and a former, almost member of the Screen Actors Guild. I LOVE good movies, and this is one. Hands down, it has all the elements of a good film. It's like watching Iwo Jima, I Lost My Heart at Wounded Knee, Boots And Saddles and War of the Worlds (WE are the Aliens in this one) all rolled into one. Great graphics, great &#34;locations&#34; and some pretty darned good acting. It will be a Classic if it isn't already. I couldn't not but the Blu-Ray-3D version Of Avatar, just as I couldn't not buy the Blu-Ray 3D version of the Hobbit, or Harry Potter, etc, etc. Watch for those reviews!
B009NY43NY|1.0|***WARNING - SPOILERS***<br /><br />Okay, wow...I honestly don't even know where to begin.  First, I have to say what a huge fan I am of the SVM series.  I have been desperately and eagerly awaiting the arrival of this final book.  To say that I am disappointed is a massive understatement.<br /><br />While reading the book I found myself skipping and scanning through pages in utter disbelief.  To be honest, it comes across as nothing more than substandard fanfic.  The book was entirely inconsistent with the previous 12 books...like it was written by someone with a complete lack of knowledge and understanding of the characters and story lines.<br />It was 300+ pages of absolutely nothing.  No real story line was developed, at least no believable story line, and each character and relationship that had developed over the previous 12 books felt shallow, empty and dismissed.  It is a rushed story that can only be described as bland at best.<br /><br />Every character in this book was totally at odds with the characters we have been introduced to throughout the series.  Sookie became somewhat fragile, boring and subdued.  Bill became a friendly neighbor who appeared to be nothing more than an old acquaintance.<br />And then there's Eric...oh, Eric...I'm at a total loss.  He began as a fierce hot kick-ass alpha-male vamp who, in my opinion, made the series so much more.  He was relentless and fearsome, but throughout the series it truly seemed that he did love Sookie.  He definitely wasn't someone to be messed with.  In the end, he was a petulant, sullen & disconsolate vamp who was bullied into becoming a Queen's consort.  I kept waiting for his secret plan of total annihilation to be revealed, but he does absolutely nothing.  He literally walks away with his head bowed and his tail between his legs.  I was dumbfounded.  There was absolutely nothing about him in the end that could even be compared to the character we first met in \\"Dead Until Dark\\".  I hated seeing his character disseminated in such a way.<br /><br />My issues with the book are not even necessarily related to the ending of Eric and Sookie's relationship.  It's really more to do with how it ends...it was completely dismissed.  I've read that Ms. Harris had originally planned this ending after the first few books and that was obvious after reading it, but I really thought that after choosing to extend the series to 12 books she would change her mind.  The characters were not the same after everything that happened in books 4-12.  The way this book pans out just doesn't coincide with everything that has happened until now.  Honestly, I saw the whole Sam thing coming with the ending of \\"Deadlocked\\".  But even the development of their relationship just wasn't believable and, again, it was inconsistent with the previous books.  She suddenly can only read his emotions, not his mind and apparently she's wanted to be with him the entire time but was too scared to pursue a relationship in fear that it would damage their friendship. Seriously??  While she and Sam have had several (almost) intimate encounters in the past, there was absolutely nothing that would have suggested they were both secretly in love with each other the entire time.  It just wasn't convincing to me.<br /><br />Eric is petulant over the fact that Sookie won't consider continuing a secret affair after he marries the Queen and Sookie appears to suddenly realize that maybe she never really accepted his vampire nature because in a moment of contemplation she suddenly has an epiphany that maybe she does have an underlying aversion to the fact that he's a vampire....what??  A relationship that gradually blossomed into something much deeper (and took 5 or 6 books to progress) was literally dismissed in only a few pages as nothing more than Eric's feeling of apparent \\"affection\\" because he truly only viewed Sookie as a possession he owned for a short while and Sookie's admission that their break-up actually \\" doesn't even hurt as much as her break-up with Bill\\".  To be honest, I would have been more satisfied had Eric kidnapped Sookie determined to turn her against her will in order to keep her...at least it would have been more true to his character.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Sookie has 3 brief encounters with Eric and I believe 2 or 3 with Bill.  The entire series is based on vampires and yet there is absolutely no interaction with vampires in this book...only a couple of brief humdrum encounters where nothing of significance happens except for the ceremony between Eric and Sookie.<br /><br />I could really go on and on, but it would be pointless.  Everything about this book was off and left me disappointed with the entire series.  In fact, it left such a bad sentiment that I've decided to just re-read the books and stop at 12 to get this final book out of my head.<br /><br />\\"Dead Ever After\\" is an extremely disappointing and inadequate ending to the SVM series.n't even hurt as much as her break-up with Bill\\".

B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Was looking forward to this new work from Rod and it doesn't disappoint. He has produced a account of his life now,different to his rock and roll days. He still has his raspy recognisable voice. Well worth buying.
1419705849|5.0|Once again Jeff Kinney does a wonderful job in writing this book. I really loved how Greg goes throw Valentine's Day and I also agree with everything he says about it being a most embarassing situacion. Definetedly one of the best books of the whole Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. I do recommend!!!

B00A3NQNUU|1.0|What happens when you finish with your update will the gamers get the dragons that they have not been able to get because we can't play. How about the party hats do we get the coins from that too cause I have not been able to play for over a week. Getting tired of waiting, can't even get my game to load on an iPad.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Very different from the previous Stargates, but still first class. In fact the only thing wrong with it is the fact they didn't go on for another few seasons! Definitely worth getting!

6305971935|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies and great to watch over and over again. First rate actors and story.
1594204217|3.0|While Michael Pollen has done some brilliant writing, and this book is entertaining, it's also rather irritating.<br /><br />Omnivore's Dilemna was wonderful; while there were irritiating bits (his gushing over Polyface farm, the peculiarly elite wild-foods dinner), these were not so noticeable, in the wealth of wonderful information and perspective.  Unfortunately, there's much less wealth of information in Cooked, so the irritating bits are much more visible. Yes, if you have hundreds of hours to focus on baking bread and take lessons from award-winning bakers you can make a great loaf, and I'm sure his are delicious, but not like the humble loaves I bake; and no, I don't chop my onions finely for my stews, yet we eat them with enjoyment. It's possible to cook from scratch ingredients (many home grown), and have it not take a long time; and while it may not be haute cuisine, it will taste pretty good. Pollan notes that as a culture we are interested in watching cooking even when we don't do it; this book seems to fit right in, we are reading about him doing things that sound quite inaccessible (and I've done some of these things myself, so it's not like lack confidence).<br /><br />This book seems to make the divide in our food culture even larger, rather than bridging the gap; the line between those that take their time to cook wonderful meals with organic ingredients from the farmer's market, and those that don't have the time or finances and so don't cook, and just eat fast food.  There's a whole lot of different interesting things that lie in between the San Francisco artisan sourdough loaf and Wonder bread.<br /><br />Having said all this, Pollan still is a great writer, and this might inspire some folks. Perhaps I'm too jaded, the first time you read about fermentation may be that much more exciting than the umpteenth time (but I do recommend you go directly to \\"Wild Fermentation\\" if you want to be inspired to ferment)
B009NY43NY|1.0|hated this book..hated what happened 2 eric.  what a supreme let down after looking forward to this book. methnks true blood better than last 4 books together....so i have posted my own ending on fanfiction.net....pen name is angie9281....us readers deserved better than what ms. harris put out
B00947N6UG|5.0|As a family we have really enjoyed watching this movie over and over.<br />Very nicely done, and a very good story.
B00AATFJK2|3.0|The story line is cool. The special effects are limited because of when the movie was made. It was way more &#34;high-tech&#34; when I saw it as a kid. It is still entertaining.
B00B2TTVNU|4.0|Lisitsa's talent is obvious here, with her easy and natural performance enabling the listener to concentrate on Rachmaninoff's music. Between her performances here and Rachmaninoff's performances of the 1930s, there have been a wide variety of alternative interpretations of the concerti, beginning with Van Cliburn's dramatic interpretation in the middle of the last century, through Ashkenazy's strong and highly romantic versions of the latter 20th century, and a wealth of other readings of the music throughout the years. I still vote for Rachmaninoff's interpretations as the clearest and most dramatic, but Ashkenazy's versions are the loveliest and the easiest to appreciate. There is an incredible variety you can choose from, and very few versions are worse than &#34;very good.&#34;
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wow, a completely awesome game.  I could not put it down.  As far as puzzle games go, this one is on the top.  You must of had a genius person to think this up and to create it. love the 3D effect.
B000002G23|5.0|I had most of my Police on cassette tape, so this was a great way to update my Police collection - has all the studio albums - songs from individual albums are sequential - album tracks are remastered so sound better than on the original albums - and contains quite a few live tracks that would be hard to get. Booklet is fairly large and glossy - fun format - especially like the short liner notes on individual tracks.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|My expectations were really high for an outstanding read...but book didn't deliver to expectations. It was on best seller list forever, saw so many positive reviews and lots of really strong ratings. Story was okay, but did not justify all the hype for me. Found the ending very unsatisfying. Won't be recommending or reading again.
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|There were parts of the movie that were entertaining, mostly because I'm so familiar with the books. Like the LotR movies, this didn't compare with the books, and the attempt by Jackson to rewrite the story failed on so many levels, it's funny. I guess I'm so much of a fan of J R R Tolkien's work, that when a new adaptation of one of his books comes out, I have to go and sit through it.
B004BLTNM0|5.0|You need a very stomic a lot of rape of man  women hard integer  ion  Water boarding , yelling screaming , if you have a strong billy watch it
B009NY43NY|5.0|I loved the book, finished in 9 hours. Wasn't completely happy with the ending, but a great read. Liked how much confidence Sookie developed. Loved that Quinn made an appearance,  wished Bubba would have thou. I always hoped that if things didn't work out with Eric she would end up with Quinn. Glad for Pam too, and I cried when she spoke of their friendship. Not sure about Sam, he has always given me the creeps, like that Sookie figured out the she could survive without a man.
B004USRKX8|5.0|David Crosby's first solo record has everything going for it, including great songs, vocals,harmonies and vibe to spare.  This is  timeless music that brings you back to the Golden Era.  Consider it a must buy.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am a true fan of Downton Abbey.  Soapy, maudlin, at times amusing.  The clothing and china are fantastic.  The story is as you would expect and it sucks you and and doesn't let you go.
B007NZDES0|5.0|By far one of the very BEST LIVE CONCERT DVDs in my library!  Though often &#34;forgotten&#34;, SADE is a BAND, not just the voluptuously talented lead singer.  This DVD takes the opportunity to showcase ALL of the members' considerable musicianship layer upon melodious layer.  Equally stunning is the cinematography done by none other than the contemporary Queen:  Sophie Muller.  BraaaVAAA!!!
B001MSMUH0|5.0|This book was assigned as \\"summer reading\\" by our principal.  Summer isn't even here and I have killed the book in just three days. I believe that \\"finding your passion\\" does change everything.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I did not really like this book as much as I expected to.  I found the main characters to be not very likable, so it was hard to root for either of them.  I guess this was just too dark for me.  The ending left me feeling like nobody won, and my heart went out to the baby-on-the-way!
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|but didn't actively dislike it.  I'm 53 and so not the target audience.  I wish I'd seen it with a little kid, and if they'd enjoyed it, I could have enjoyed their pleasure in it.  As it was, it was okay.  Two and a half stars.
B005EHILV4|5.0|I just plugged it in, hooked up a microphone and presto it started working.<br />I am a novice in audio, so that was a big bonus.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story. Well written. I was surprised at the ending. There's a few things I didn't like. But don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I liked the book. Good read. Looking forward to final book. Fillet does a nice job of tying his characters together.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I am a music buff and this is one of the best CD I've ever heard. I absolutely recommend getting it.
B0008ENICU|5.0|This movie has satisfied me since I first saw it many years ago.  It is the original &#34;chick flick&#34;.  My single girl friends and I find the humor as fresh today as when it was written in the 1930's.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|I could watch this movie a hundred times.  So much to it.  I feel like I know all three of these musicians personlly now -- jimmy, the Edge, and Jack. I loved hearing about their creative processes, how each musician's personal life and history contributed to the shape of his career, and to see their passion for their art.  A really touching group of stories.  Never has a movie made it so clear that there is more than one way to skin a cat -- the three men had such diversely different personalities, philosophies and methods, yet all have been so successful.  And seeing them get together with only the wish to learn and share, no competition, no backstabbing -- just genuine mutual respect.  Just a terrific movie.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I got this app to make sure my kindle was charging and it is pretty cool u can see your battery temp and voltage
B004J64QSI|5.0|Gripping, emotional, delightful, amazing, incredible, awe-inspiring. Every cast member puts forth the performance of a lifetime.  I had heard a lot of buzz about Les Mis before I saw the recent movie with Russell Crowe and High Jackman, and after I saw that movie I just didn't get it...couldn't see why the show was so popular.  Then I rented this and everything fell into place.  Wonderful, wonderful.  Alfie Boe is a god.
B0070DOHQS|2.0|I deleted the program once I realized you had to leave you computer running 24/7 for it to serve any purpose. Maybe it's a good business tool but for personal use not so much.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|THIS HAVE LETTERS MY ENTERTAINED FOR HOURS.<br />I LOVE THIS GAME<br />I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M DOING THIS REVIEW<br />JUST PLAY THE GAME<br />IT'S BUNCHES FUN
B005LZW8FO|2.0|Full disclosure: I love Brit Marling and also loved her prior film \\"Sound of My Voice\\", so if you're a fan of either, this movie is at very least worth checking out.<br /><br />As far as the movie, it's pretty intellectual, pretty deep. It's important that you know it's not a sci-fi movie. It's a drama that uses the \\"sci-fi\\" as a metaphorical driver of the film's theme which should relate to anyone who's ever had a regret. Though there's some lack of polish with the music and writing, Mike Cahill and Brit Marling have crafted another beautiful film that will leave you thinking.<br /><br />I would love to own this movie. Unfortunately, I'm not willing to pay $20 for a DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital combo when I don't have a Blu-Ray player and rarely watch movies on my computer. Since this is the only option, I'm left to wait until Blockbuster puts it in a bargain bin. Not sure what the purpose is behind this distribution technique, but it's frustrating.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Can't give review as I havnt started to read it yet.  I'm assuming I will love the book as theTV series is fantastic, and my Dad recommended it, we have very similar tastes in our books.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|A great realization of a great book. Few movies are ever more than based off the books. Get over it.
B00C27LB20|5.0|Definitely shades of Bob Dylan, even if Jake Bugg is a member of Generation Y.  And Mr. Bugg delivers with all the talent and original sound<br />that makes audiophiles sit up and take notice.  If \\"Lightning Bolt\\" or \\"Two Fingers\\" doesn't hook you, well, I'd be surprised.<br />Well done debut.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Why are you reading this when you could be watching the series right now?  Everyone has an opinion about this series of films, whether you agree that the first one was a great cinematic achievement, or that the fourth installment was worthy of the hate, but there is no doubt that this set is a wonderful one to own.  When I buy compilations of movies like this, I expect to get more than a set of discs in a generic case.  Fans of a series of movies, are what make it possible for the films to live on from generation to generation.  If you can't reward us with some cool behind the scenes footage and/or artwork, then it comes as a bit of a slap in the face.  I am happy to say that this set does not do that.  The transfer to Blu-ray looks amazing.  I don't have a decent surround sound setup at home, as mine is an antique, but it does sound good on my system.  If you are a fan of the Indiana Jones stuff, you probably already own this series in some form, but if you want it on Blu-ray, this is a great choice.
B003VR5PPY|2.0|I thought that this would be a fun game. However, I found that there was too much dialog to really get into the gameplay. The puzzles were fun, but I had to sit through 10 minutes of chat bubbles for 3 minutes of puzzle.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|This CD has so many wonderful songs.  Probably the best cd I have ever purchased.<br />Emile Sande is an incredible artist.
B0033AI4PM|5.0|I have watched most of the film, and am estatic about the blu-ray transfer! The audio is top notch, and the few extras included (especially the behind-the-scenes featurette) are enjoyable. I do tend to agree with a previous review which pointed out that the chapter stops are badly placed in regards to the song cues. And, to make matters worse, previews are included which have nothing to do with Streisand or her films. The preview for \\"Funny Girl\\", as well as \\"Funny Lady\\", should have been included!!! Who makes these insipid decisions anyway? Whoever it is does a disservice to the film, one of William Wyler's finest. He exudes a deserved Academy Award performance from Miss streisand which is the first of many brilliant acting jobs she has done in films. Barbra Streisand is truly timeless, and just gets better and better each year. Seeing her perform in the 21st centry is just as thrilling as seeing her older videos and films. The lady has the chops and proves that true talent will win out and be enjoyed for many, many years. I have the pleasure of seeing the film in pristine condition, but wish I could see it on a giant screen at a theatre again, like when it was first produced. The \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\" sequence was, and still is, worth the price of admission! Highly recommended.
B00004Y6NM|3.0|This was supposed to be Clapton's comeback album.  It was produced by Phil Collins and features much more guitar work than almost any of his albums since the 60s.  Unfortunately most of the album is forgettable.  It does have the great \\"Forever Man,\\" but otherwise nothing really stands out.<br /><br />This isn't as stuck in its era as badly as the later Collins' produced \\"August,\\" but it still isn't Clapton at his best.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|do not get this app it stinks it stopped working the second day I got it DDDDDOOOOOO NNNNOTTTTT GET THIS APP IT TRUELY SUCKS THIS IS FROM ANDREW RAY SHAW
B00006AW2J|5.0|This album is a return to the Rolling Stone's blues rock sound, after the psychedelia of \\"Their Satanic Majesty's Request.\\"  They're back with a vengeance on this one with tracks ranging from delta blues, to country, to hard rock and even truly innovative songs like \\"Sympathy for the Devil.\\"  On this album, and the three that follow it, the Stones can do no wrong.<br /><br />This album was the last one Brian Jones played on.  The album features the slide guitar on a number of tracks, a technique the Stones would revisit on \\"Sticky Fingers.\\"
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was my first sex/porn novel. I enjoyed reading this more than any book that I have ever read. It is good stuff.
0307476073|4.0|I really enjoyed the way the author writes.  Easy to read, the pages just melted away.  I found the majority of the substance of the book was in the first half, as the author describes her trials of childhood into her early 20's.  The tale of her mother had me openly crying on a crowded airplane, it was gut-wrenching.  I found the second half of the book to be slightly less compelling, more the tale of the actual journey along the PCT, but entertaining nonetheless.  Very enjoyable book.
B00CDXOXB4|4.0|I did not get the chance to see this movie in theaters and could not wait to see it. I bought this movie as soon as it came available and it was worth the wait. I honestly figured that this movie would be fairly predictable but the twist in the movie just makes this movie watching it  has a wonderful story to it. If you are looking for a recent movie that just came out then take the chance to watching this one!

B00ATDOVNK|4.0|So far I really like the game. I have to use the hint a lot to figure out which room I need to go to next but I'm glad it let's me without having to recharge every time. The storyline is pretty cool also. Keeps you in suspence and wondering what happened and will happen. Fun game over all!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I am in the age group in which Justin Timberlake is not music I usually seek out.  I have two children living with me now who are 10 and 15 years old.  I have been listening to different music now and I really enjoyed most of the songs on this cd - alot of them sounded like some of my favorite music from the 70's & 80's R&B.

B007FLHW3K|5.0|Bike Party!!!!!<br /><br />Fairly easy and straightforward install. Intuitive controls. Durable construction.<br /><br />Don't be scared by the price, you get what you pay for and the durability of these more than justifies the price IMO.<br /><br />My Recommendation<br /><br />Buy two per wheel. With one you wont get a full circuit of light unless you are constantly going downhill at high speed. With two (Mounted exactly opposite of each other) you get a nice stream of light at lower speeds.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I REALLY ENJOYED THE MOVIE. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT MOVIE. BOND MOVIE'S ARE A GREAT SERIES, CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE.
B00A820UF0|5.0|Wow that a really interesting book that show the design process that they have gone through to create the material that we have all enjoyed while playing or reading the series.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|So far it seems you cant do anything without completing a puzzle. Hope chapter 2 will be better.<br />touch screen is glitchy. I have reached an impasse, the item in the puzzle I need to click is located UNDER the tab that says \\"Back\\" and I can't get to it. If I click on the general area it just takes me back out of the puzzle. No way to complete this puzzle, so no way to move on. I deleted this app from my Kindle and from the cloud. Disappointing.

B00BHHIWQO|3.0|This is a good app love playing this game, but there must be an update to this to keep up with the Facebook app. I gave three stars because of no update with Facebook. I have more powers that I've earned on Facebook but does not show up on kindle fire's app.

B00133KHCY|4.0|This is a quirky, not your typical Hollywood fare, but very enjoyable.  Definitely a heart warming feel good movie.<br /><br />My only reason for not rating it 5 stars is I found the Blu-ray seemed more of an up conversion of standard resolution.  But otherwise it's great.

B009NY43NY|4.0|The book is paced well, puts Sookie in peril in several ways and brings most series characters into the plot in realistic ways to wind up both the plot and the series.  Many of these characters have grown over time, as should be expected.  If you liked the previous books, you should like this one.<br /><br />May I remind some critics that the genre is fantasy, not romance.<br /><br />Spoilers after here :<br />Sookie has relayed many opinions on her values and her hopes for a future that would have fit those.  Sookie was never going to become a vampire and that was what a choice of those partners would mean.  Sorry, team Eric and Team Bill.  Sookie - has never been willing to rule out children and a home for her future - and who has been standing by to give her that?  This ending could have been seen a mile away.<br /><br />It's like the advice on scenery for a stage - don't leave a gun lying in plain sight if someone is not going to pick it up and shoot.  Who else has been there all along?
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Incredible graphics! Loved your game. Can't wait for the next one. You won't be sorry that you bought it. Not so challenging as to be frustrating.
0140157352|5.0|Fundamental tactics for sales and negotiation!  In our day-to-day lives we try to sell friends and family on ideas, tasks, etc... so I would seriously say its useful for most.  Negotiate a higher salary or a better price on a new car.
B000068C3U|1.0|The soundtrack is so tinny that it is distracting.  Warner Brothers, internationally famous for sucking its stars dry, is now doing the same thing to consumers.  It is a shame that a great movie like this cannot be re-mastered to provide the great entertainment it should.  Shame on WB.

0679420401|5.0|Rec'd in a timely fashion, good quality copy. I first read this book as a ten year old, it left an impression, I always said I'd re-read it<br />and finally have the chance. This copy will be in my personal library a reminder of when I started taking good books seriously. I need to thank Annika personally for doing me this great favor, a nice quality book, sent in a timely way, at a decent price. Thanks!
193700788X|2.0|I've been a fan of the SVM series since before True Blood.  Year after year I became more attached to these amazing characters.  Like many, I felt the last few books were lacking in many areas, from continuity issues to feeling rushed and disorganized.  Truthfully, the books seem to have changed in tone and quality since True Blood started.<br /><br />In my review of Deadlocked, I stated that I figured Sookie would end up with Sam since all of sudden he was brought to the forefront, but hoped it would be a wonderful story and Sookie just wouldn't be 'settling'.  Unfortunately, this seems to be what happened.  While CH says that she stayed true to her vision, I have to wonder what exactly it was.  We already know that CH planned to kill Bill, but her editor prodded her to keep him alive because of the growing popularity of True Blood and they didn't want to hurt the brand.  And because of that popularity, I believe that is why the Sookie/Eric relationship was kept alive for so many books.  There was no build up to this Sookie/Sam relationship.  Their 'romantic' scenes were awkward and forced.  In the end, we just wanted Sookie to be happy and have that miraculous HEA she so deserved after all she'd been through.  I just didn't see it happen. I felt how the ending of the relationship occured with Eric just wasn't good, plain and simple.  And I would have loved a much better story with Pam, who is a known favorite.  When you cut out all of the filler in this book, which there seems to have been a lot used by CH in recent books, so much more REAL story could have been added.<br /><br />I am giving this book two stars instead of one because I truly did enjoy how we got to see so many of our favorites one last time. I always love Mr. C and Diantha and loved that they had such a big part.  Overall, this book was very disappointing because there simply was no legitimate reasoning to how it ended.  There was no proper build up.  And the ending of one of the most popular romances in recent history just fizzled and died a sad death.<br /><br />I will always cherish books 1-8.  They were, and still are, amazing.  For that I thank Charlaine Harris.
0156027321|5.0|A few sentences won't sum up accurately the experience of reading this book. One is affected in<br />every aspect of Pi's journey and thoughtful reasoning. I was gullible at first to believe at first that<br />this was true story being related to the/ an author, but that didn't matter anymore. The book journey<br />took me to many places in my own experiences and touched me in broad expanses of my heart.
0061733199|5.0|I really like this survival handbook.  Although I've not read it entirely, I can see that it is very detailed and provides a wealth of information to survive in any climate.  One thing I have noticed is the slight difference between British English terminology and American English.  This doesn't greatly detract from the information conveyed, but it does give the reader pause as you try &#34;translate&#34; the word or phrase into American English.  I would recommend this book!
0064400018|5.0|This is a very important book because it celebrates a family and a way of life that is truly uncommon in the times we find ourselves in. Christmas presents were often handmade (and there was usually just one - made with love, and accepted with genuine gratitude); Children shared bedrooms (sometimes the same bed), wore hand-me-down clothes. The family ate meals together. Everyone had their chores, allowances were earned. Songs were sung, then taught and sung together. When harvest time came the farmers came together and helped one another going from farm to farm until the work was done. These people lived a hard life, constant work. And yet, they seemed very happy and content and would never for one minute think of themselves as poor.<br /><br />I especially loved the Garth Williams illustrations.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Can't wait for more updates!<br />Use it every night.  You won't regret this purchase.  unless you do.  It won't be my fault though.

B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I see that some people are confused when it comes to the reviews about movies they purchase here. They go on about how the movie sucks and that's really not the point. No one cares if you liked the movie or not, they want to know the quality of the discs and the packaging. I mean, let's face it, did ANYONE like the first Star Trek movie? It was sooo boring!<br />These discs are packaged individually in thin plastic cases with minimal exterior design. Not much in the way of inserts. The picture and sound are great quality like you'd expect in any movie in DVD format. I've had these in VHS for years, so it was nice to see a much better picture and hear sound without the analog hum. Definitely recommend.
055357342X|5.0|yeah, i ruined it. do something about it.<br /><br />thats what i thought...<br /><br />ninety percent of this book is sansa stark crying
B0067R0APK|2.0|I could kick myself for allowing this app to update. The previous version was fast, informative without being overwhelming, and nicely designed. I've tried to get used to this new version, but it's slow, overwhelming with way too much information, and poorly laid out. The previous version had a similar amount of information, but it wasn't 'in your face' all at once like this one. I wish there was a way to get the previous version of the app back. I've started using a weather app from a local TV station. Even though there are advertisements, it's much better than the premium version of the AccuWeather app (which also now has a built in ad for a local Fox station that you can't opt out of, despite this being a fairly expensive app).

B00BK40QO0|5.0|&#34;Gustav Mahler recommends Herr Klemperer as an outstanding musician who despite his youth is already experienced and is predestined for the career of conductor.<br />He vouches for the successful outcome of a probationary appointment and is willing personally to provide further information.&#34;<br /><br />In 1905 in Berlin, twenty year-old Otto Klemperer made his professional debut as a conductor.<br />The work was Mahler's 2nd, the &#34;Resurrection Symphony&#34;.<br />The composer was in the audience.<br />After the concert, Mahler congratulated Klemperer on his performance.<br />Two years later, Mahler wrote a letter of recommendation that secured Klemperer's first professional appointment.<br /><br />Actually, Klemperer only conducted 2% of this Symphony. The other 98% was conducted by Oskar Fried.<br />Fried engaged young Klemperer to conduct the off-stage band in the finale. *<br />You have to start somewhere.<br /><br />Otto Klemperer had a life-long obsession with the music of Mahler, particularly the &#34;Resurrection Symphony&#34;.<br />Between 1950 and 1971, he left us with eight recordings.<br />Amazingly enough, Klemperer holds the record as both the fastest and the slowest conductor of this symphony on record - timings from Peter Fulop's 'Mahler Discography':<br /><br />[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review though to the end, then come back and click on the links.]<br /><br />67:04 = 1950 Sydney Symphony Orchestra broadcast - Fastest performance ever.

Hughes for this inside information).<br />This dubious procedure was repeated for the 2000 EMI Great Recordings of the Century release.<br />So this box is the first appearance of Klemperer's EMI Mahler 2nd on CD at the correct speed.<br />As such it is an essential purchase for any serious Mahlerian.<br /><br />The four Klemperer performances from 1962-65 are essentially the same conception.<br />The Bavarian Radio broadcast is marginally more intense than the EMI studio performance.<br />It was also well-recorded in stereo, but the EMI studio recording is unbeatable for clarity and warmth (recorded in Kingsway Hall).<br /><br />Perhaps inspired by the need to remaster the 2nd Symphony, EMI also commissioned new remasterings of Symphonies 4, 7, 9 and Das Lied von der Erde.<br />This is the only volume in the new Klemperer Edition that has had such extensive work.<br />It was worth the effort.<br />I find all transfers preferable in clarity and warmth to previous attempts.<br />One caveat: My ears are 64 years old (ditto the rest of me) and I am probably not the best judge of fine gradations of sound.<br /><br />Klemperer's strings were seated in an arc: First Violins, Basses, Cellos, Violas, Second Violins.<br />Not all violins scrunched together on the left, and lower strings on the right, which you will hear with Bernstein, Karajan and Solti.<br />Their 20th Century seating arrangement has become almost universal, but Klemperer's is the orchestra that Mahler was familiar with.<br />Klemperer's old-fashioned seating plan makes the conductor's job a lot harder.<br />Worth the effort. **<br /><br />Nowadays, thanks to an unfriendly neighbor and a dog who demands three walks a day, I have been doing most of my listening on headphones.<br />The 2nd movement Landler of the 9th Symphony seems to have been composed with headphones in mind.<br />Give it a try (in Klemperer's recording).<br /><br />Mahler's 7th Symphony has never appealed to me.<br />Interestingly, Bruno Walter and Otto Klemperer shared my opinion (they also avoided Symphonies 3, 6 and 8 - I am incredulous).<br />Symphony 7 seems like a let-down after the the raw emotion of Symphony 6.<br />Late in life, Klemperer reconsidered the 7th Symphony and left us with a really weird (meaning SLOW) recording of the work.<br /><br />I still don't get the first four movements, but have come to an appreciation of the 5th movement (CD 4, track 1).<br />This movement has nothing in common with with the rest of the symphony.<br />It seems like a throw-back to the world of the First Symphony.<br />All fanfares, chorales and peasant dances.<br />Its actually quite vulgar, but I now find it invigorating.<br />Klemperer's slow pace actually brings out the vulgarity more than Bernstein's streamlined reading.<br />One curiosity: After the initial drumroll and brass chorale, there is (at 1:05) a theme that sounds for all the world like a Broadway showtune.<br />I only noticed this in Klemperer's recording.<br /><br />My only complaint is the absence of texts and translations for the vocal works.<br />Predictable with these bargain boxes.<br />Still sad.<br /><br />All serious Mahlerians need to own the recordings by Klemperer, Bruno Walter, Oskar Fried and Willem Mengelberg. ***<br />They were part of Mahler's inner circle for the last ten years of his life (he died in 1911).<br /><br />USELESS MAHLER TRIVIA:<br />The new Bach-Haydn box in the EMI Klemperer Edition, [[ASIN:B00BK40QWM Bach, Rameau, Handel, GLuck, Haydn]] includes a Mahler rarity.<br />Christoph Willibald Gluck's Overture to Iphiginie en Aulide (1774) was re-orchestrated by Wagner in 1847.<br />The Gluck-Wagner overture was popular in the first half of the Twentieth Century.<br />Furtwangler, Mengelberg, Richard Strauss and Bruno Walter all conducted it.<br />I believe Klemperer's is the only recording in stereo.<br />According to the booklet notes, Klemperer conducted a version with further revisions by Gustav Mahler.<br />This was done in 1907, when Klemperer was part of Mahler's inner circle.<br />I don't think it's been published.<br />Apparently this is the world premiere recording of the Gluck-Wagner-Mahler Overture to Iphigenie en Aulide.<br />Its a monster.<br /><br />REMASTERING DATES:<br />2012 for Symphonies 2, 4 and 9.<br />2011 for Symphony 7 and Das Lied von der Erde.<br />1999 for five songs with Christa Ludwig (the GROC remastering).<br /><br />*******************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />* In 1924 Oskar Fried recorded Mahler's &#34;Resurrection Symphony&#34; with the Berlin State Opera Orchestra: [[ASIN:B00EIPIL2M Mahler: the Music of Gustav Mahler: Issu]]<br />This was the first ever recording of a Mahler symphony.

B00BNXOMHA|1.0|Nowhere in the description of this article, or on the outside of the packaging, did it mention that the DIGITAL COPIES would not be available outside of the 48 contiguous USA States.  This is an outrage!  I live in Puerto Rico, which is part of the USA (it is a USA territory), and the CINEMANOW site will not allow me to activate, or download, or any way to use, the Digital Copies THAT I PAID FOR as this collection cost me $112 USA Dollars.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|ruf. $5.99 is tooooooooooooo much.  your games are super terrific and are the only games I play.  but I cannot afford $5.99 to continue.  too bad cause they are great games.  I have over $3 million on  your fishdom.  I should not have to pay for a continuation of envoy.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is a musical that I can see over and over again.  Hugh Jackman surprised me with such outstanding dramatical acting (and singing) when my association of him was with his Wolverine X-Men character.  Russell and Anne also deliver outstanding performance (and singing, can't get over it).  This is a movie to watch many times over.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Kids can play this game at the first few levels. However, when you reach higher than level 10, you need some \\"experiences\\". Parents, please be aware that this game would attract kids to use real money to buy pearls or they could spend hours tabbing on the screen in order to get more rare fish or move up to the next level quickly. Disney should have made this as a fun game for kids.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I love this book! Very unique to the other things I have read. Definitely knew love would come in to play eventually bur it was still a rocking book with amazing characters.

B009NY43NY|1.0|Reading this book was a waste of time & money, I should have waited for the reviews instead of pre-ordering this book : (<br />I sincerely hope CH does not have anything to do with the current storyline on HBO's True Blood.
B00A0MJ9VY|5.0|No problems with the product what so ever - item had some small minor dent in the corner, but it's nothing you wouldn't find on a store bought dvd. Loved the movie, not scratched or anything and the case did come in the standard plastic wrap. Love it!

B0071F3T0K|3.0|While parts of the book were fascinating such as intricate details on bull fighting, the small talk became tedious for me quite often. And has there ever been a book where more alcoholic beverages were consumed by the characters in such constancy? It's an era that has largely vanished such as unfiltered cigarettes. But overall I'm pleased I've read it.
B00BEIN9VO|5.0|This album just shines on vinyl and you would be crazy not to get it, they also give you a digital copy.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I would, however, like it to be a little easier to remove from the case.  I suppose that you are not able to have both.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|A good job and a good film but you can see and feel why the academy did not nominate Ben for best director. My need for more conection to the individuals held in the house limited my care and I wish he would have taken more time to explore more of these people lives! Still a good movie experience just not a great film for me! Thanks

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Good game and very challenging. Have had no problem what so ever, aside from game sensitive turning with my kindle
B004D38HOG|5.0|A fabulous, dark, scary, loving wonderful and horrible story, beautifully written.  So many memoirs are self-indulgent, but this book didn't feel like that.  This book tells the story of Portia's eating disorder and explains so well that an eating disorder is about so much more than what you eat (or don't eat).  This story is made all the more wonderful as we see Portia emerge from the darkness of her disorder to find a life filled with love and happiness.  Hope for us all.
B00846REIS|4.0|I loved 50 shades of grey.  This book is ridiculously similar so naturally I really enjoyed it.  Quick easy and fun read.  Can't wait to start the next one.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|I wanted a program to print directly to my wireless printer or my bluetooth printer not to some cloud. Why would I want to send something to cloud when I want a printout right now. By the way, who is cloud? Does he/she have better fonts than my printer? Does she/he use water resistant color ink? It all sounds a little spacy to me, but I'm pretty well grounded.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good good good good good. I really like this game it is so fun and my little brother loves it to. GREAT GAME
0307266303|5.0|I ordered this book out of curiosity about a tribe of humans in mexico that run very long distances on a regular basis.  I ordered it because I thought reading about such people would be very interesting (being a runner myself) but i ended up learning a great deal about running shoes and running barefoot or nearly so.  This book is a sort of treatise, in part at least, about how the advancement in running shoes has worked the reverse of what you would expect.  This is good reading and I recommend this book to anyone, but especially those who are runners and/or would like to know more about the human foot and its ability to acclimate.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|great game lots of fun kids and adults would love this game. leveling up is pretty easy<br />again I say a great game
B00AEBB8BK|1.0|Let me give you some background: This release was one of the releases that came out near the beginning of Bluray in 2008. The Bluray.com knobs that worked there in that timeframe were incompetent as you will ever know. This was another 5 star 'Patton' review where the reviewer of the PQ has no idea what he is talking about in any way whatsoever. Please revisit the site and read their old reviews of those two films, not the Patton remaster, for a GOOD AND HEARTY laugh at PQ criticism gone down the drain.<br /><br />This is easily one of the worst transfers on the market.<br /><br />Stay away from this garbage. Who in their right mind puts out a 37Mbps transfer at the top of the heap and then DNRs the living **** out of the picture and uses some old DVD master with heaps of EE for a release? This 'film' looks like straight to video trash on a decent screen. I could not even bare to watch more than 3 minutes of it before it was sent back.<br /><br />And not only that but add in the fact this is one of greatest films ever made and all I can do is throw up.<br /><br />Hollywood's finest couldn't give this the time of day. Expect another release at some point. When they did this with Gladiator enough people complained. No go here for the same treatment and that is quite sad. This film should not look like this.<br /><br />The 2013 release is the same release. Garbage. Expect a 4K release and new transfer within 3 or 4 years.
B004E547D8|5.0|This is a great action film with excellent characters  that I can watch time and time again.  I plan on getting v2 and watching the two films as a double header.
B004K583KA|5.0|Though an amateur and play no instrument I enjoy a very broad range of serious music with Bach at the top of the list.  Although familiar with his great oratorios and much keyboard and orchestral music, I was only able to access the tip of the huge iceberg of the cantatas.  For weeks since receiving the set I've enjoyed 1 or 2 discs per evening and am still not half way through.  Many  treasures in that box are the best of the best.
B0000683DH|5.0|I loved it for character development, the plot and great acting.  I cried when Spock died; especially when &#34;Amazing Grace&#34; was played on bagpipes.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|I have seen it on Broadway and  i have all other DVDs regarding as movie/as musical . I guess the story should be told as a movie OR as a musical. This was a combination of both. It was musically talked and I just did not like it.

B009IA9OLE|4.0|Love this game!  Very entertaining and challenging.  Does get somewhat boring after more than half an hour worth of play - but definitely a great time waster for those dull moments at the doctor's reception or when stuck in traffic ;-)

193700788X|4.0|I couldn't stop reading the book and ended up staying up until 1am finishing, so it was decent enough. It was quite twisty, I had no idea who the big bad was until the end. Ultimately they're meant to be mystery books with romance thrown in so as a mystery, it was well done. I think the 99% of readers have got too tied up with the romance side, hence the outpouring of frankly irrational rage on here and elsewhere. I have never left a review for a CH book before, but I was compelled to do so to provide some balance.<br /><br />Sookie, though often irritating, is an empathetic and engaging character, you feel like you are living her small but dramatic life along with her, and so the ending, though I have always had a soft spot for Bill, was satisfying for me and entirely consistent with who she is. Standing strong on her own, all enemies vanquished, Eric banished, a bit of money coming in, and a relatively human potential boyfriend that has always had her back. Sookie is the heroine in these books, not one of her boyfriends. It would be a disgrace if she sold herself out just to keep shipping readers happy. So well done CH, I haven't always enjoyed the 13 book ride but I cannot say that it was a waste of time and out of all the chick-lit paranormal smut books out there, yours are the best.
B005LAIII0|3.0|Although Life of Pi was entertaining on the Blu Ray disk; it just couldn't come up to the book.<br />So often these popular books are made into films- I found myself wondering if I would have enjoyed the movie if I had not read the book first. The film did alter some of the book's most exciting passages and when you got to these spots, it left you at sea.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Great movie night movie for kids and grown-UPS! You never get tired of watching monsters....so pop some corn and snuggle up. Have some fun time with your little ones...
B001KEHAI0|5.0|Absolutely love this movie!  I still see something new every time I watch it.  It never gets old.  Glad I finally ordered a copy.
B002RL7VKC|5.0|He is 2 1/2 and just loves this.  What boy wouldn't.  Well made and has provided hours of fun.  Duplo is a trusted brand.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|A great beginning and an interesting initial storyline about the main character, but events that follow are muddled and leave questions unanswered. A great opportunity to fully utilize the great Sir Ben Kingsley is almost entirely wasted. Not a bad film, but it definitely does not live up to all of the pre- and post-release hype, and this one has nowhere near the level of captivating plotlines and giddy thrills of the previous two films.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I am loathe to admit I almost did not buy this book after seeing the abysmal reviews left by others. Lucky for me I wanted to form my own opinion about how this series ended and I plunged in. I am really happy that I did that.  I always felt that Sookie was in the sup world accidentally, or at least unintentionally, because after all, Bill was ordered to seduce her way back when. To me, series always was about a strong woman who was just too nice for her own good which people had no scruples about taking advantage of.  All of the people in her life took her for granted - everyone except for Sam that is.  I loved the progression of her growing strength and her refusal to be treated that way anymore and was pleased with how the people in her life came around to that idea in this book.<br /><br />On the HEA front,I always thought she was supposed to end up with Sam and that HEA just got off that track due to the vamps interference in her life.  The whole series can be seen as the journey back to him and the life she was always supposed to have. I don't know why people are saying Erik's character was assassinated, he chose the path with long term reward which is 100% per his usual M.O.  He treated Sam and Sookie both in typical Erik fashion in this story,I saw no difference in him. I felt he played out true to how he was always written and was portrayed as the character I have always seen him to be. I thank Ms. Harris for this wonderful series and I look forward to seeing what she comes up with next.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent series with gripping writing, great settings, lush clothing and some scene-stealing appearances by famous actors/actresses.  Maggie Smith as the Dowager Duchess is a hoot -- when she is on the scene, everyone else pales by comparison.  I found the entire three seasons to be wonderful!
0887431453|5.0|As a former teacher, I highly recommend the 'Big Preschool Workbook' for kiddos. My three-year-old grandson wholeheartedly agrees. His mom works with him on a page-a-day schedule and he loves the variety of activities.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I believe I rated this earlier , along with other things I have purchased. Downton Abbey is a lot like  Upstairs, Downstairs. I love both of them. Anyone who enjoyed the one, will enjoy the other.  I have only the  complete first season of Upstairs, Downstairs and will be looking for the rest soon.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The Solitaire game is fine.  It is very disturbing to have so many pop-up ads show up, especially those that are impossible to delete. I have been using my repertoire of uncouth words, which I generally do not use, each time I play the Solitaire game.
B008J05EL8|1.0|While this app is needed, it shouldn't be. OfficeSuite7, like other applications of this style, should have included everything necessary to make the program effectual without adding an extra fee.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I use this app all the time and also use it to purchase items and its quick and easy to use.
193700788X|1.0|I can understand Ms. Harris being Sookied-out, but that is no excuse for the lazy writing in this and the previous book in the series. They are boring and lifeless which is uncharacteristic of the wonderful world of Bon Temps that she so lovingly (originally) created. I wish she would simply have taken a hiatus from writing Sookie stories and come back to her when she could've done both Sookie, and herself as an author, justice.<br /><br />Don't buy or read this book.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|I wanted to read this book the moment I see it. Sadly I didn't start reading it until after CPO Chris Kyle had been murdered by a young Marine he was trying to help. Being a Navy vet and having known a couple SEALS I have great respect for them and all my brothers in arms. All I can say is thank you CPO Kyle for your service. RIP brother.
B00CI5ET7K|5.0|I have to say that I have been following this legend for over 3 decades now. In that time, my only disappointment was 'Engines of Creation'. That being said, almost every two years, like clockwork, Satch releases a unique gem for his followers to feast their ears on. This current release is no exception. From the outset Joe shows us why he is still considered by many as one of the best on the planet. Every song is an adventure in exploring the limits of what he can do with his instrument. I hope he remains an 'unstoppable momentum' for many more years.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Awesome game you can breed amazing dragons!But some dragons such as the diamond Dragon you can't breed. Which is a bummer because  it's nearly impossible to get gold unless your willing to spend money to buy some. As I said  though it's a great game!
193700788X|1.0|Wow...where did this series take such a horrible turn.I remember eagerly awaiting the new book and rushing to buy it at store or open it up on my kindle/ But after Dead in the Family CH's books really seemed to fall apart. it was like she didn't have the heart or desire to write anymore.<br /><br />Now the romance in this book..eww seals I use to like seals now ick! It will tkae a long time to get that image out of my head. and for her and Sam the so called hea ending was just soso. yeah I am an Eric fan who was prepared for it to be Sam but CH did such a lame job with the romance it was like ehhhh...what ever he's here and we will see where it goes.<br /><br />Now I am not happy at all with her Sookie/Eric stuff after yrs and yrs of books where they connected loved and protected each other CH turns them into teens fighting with a slamming door ending. What?! that's it no more E/S time?!!!!!! pfffft<br /><br />This series was ready to be kept with my favs like Dianna Galbadon, KMM, etc but nope will pick a few early ones to keep and remove the rest.<br /><br /> What a sad way to end a series that  I and many others loved..it is now dead to us too and that is so sad.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is like soooo boring you can't buy any cool horses see that zebra yup costs 368 gems. Guess how much you have yes 0 zero and know how much it costs? 99&cent; to 99.99 dollars so don't spend your money and time on this boring game! Anyway l don't mean to be harsh I'm just telling the truth.
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|You definitely gotta get this CD if you like Buddy Guy. I've been to his concerts and this CD was like being there (BUT) and I mean BUT, I wish that I was at this live performance - gotta see him live at Legends.

B005HS00V4|2.0|good filming and sound, but its like watching a old classical opera. Gabriels older  concerts much better in my  ipinion.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|The short stories made it possible to finish them in one sitting, and I found myself looking forward to the next time that I'd be able to read again.
B005LAII8K|5.0|The ending of this movie is sooooo good!  Completely heartbreaking.  If you know before hand, it spoils it though, sort of like &#34;The Sixth Sense&#34;, another movie Bruce Willis is in...
B009T8XBBO|4.0|Don't know what the IAP argument is about because I don't see it on the addons or in the game itself...<br />Guess alot of people are reviewing and don't actually know if it has IAP, their reading other reviews and jumping on the bandwagon.<br />The game has Flurry -1 star for that. People usually go ballistic over Flurry being installed, but it depends on how the developer uses it makes it good or bad.<br />The game is ok, but kind of repetitious. Is it worth $3.99? Depends if you're into this type of game, try the free version first to see.<br />I like the game, but to me $2.99 would be a more acceptable price point for what it actually is. The controls are easy and responsive on my phone sgs2 skyrocket running 2.3.6 Plays good on my Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 running 4.1.1 too.
B00993FEUK|5.0|I heard really good things about this movie from my friends and finally decided to check it out on Netflix.  After seeing it on Netflix, I decided to buy it.  It is a really good and satisfying movie though not in a way I would normally expect.

B00BN3EE1O|1.0|This is very long \\"chase and find\\" movie which opens with a promising scene of a crime being committed.  Unfortunately, it takes the viewer nearly 2-hours to get from the \\"chase\\" to the \\"find\\" -- with the intervening time consumed by irrelevant and extraneous romantic filler having absolutely nothing to do with the premise of a crime having being committed. Although there is one \\"semi-interesting\\" twist, and the cast is filled by very attractive actors, none of this is enough to keep you involved in this slow moving and predictable film.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Christian Bale is the best Batman ever....the plots of the three movies meld seamlessly together...love the insights to the Batman lore, especially in the 3rd movie!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This games is fantastic especially the world tour right now we're in Tokyo I wonder what's next? Tokyo awesome  I passed the weekly hunt!!
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|Wow. I could hardly wait to see this film. The trailers looked fabulous. This film turned out to be the ultimate in what is wrong with Hollywood these days. It's all about formulas & casting so & so. Here they put someone in charge who is all excited that he gets to play with tech gadgets and do something cool and weird. Yet they had no concept how to tell a good story!! This film has no heart or soul! It's an immature exercise in something, but it is NOT good filmmaking or storytelling. I was disengaged the entire time and did not care squat about any of the characters. I gave it 2 stars because the sets were gorgeous and that took effort, and the actors actually did well if you looked at their acting in a capsule. It was the horrific story and the direction the people at the head of this film decided to go with it that flushed everything else down the toilet.
B000001FSR|3.0|Self-indulgence at its best, and worst.  I am not certain what Waits meant to do here - I gather that this was part of a performance at Steppenwolf, and as pure music or blues, it suffers.  But Way Down In The Hole is worth the rest of the shenanigans.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I love love love this app!!!!! Especially that I can switch back and forth between mobile and full suite Facebook! My only complaint is that I can't send pictures through Facebook messages..I click and click and nothing happens! If this could get fixed this app would be perfect! :)

0380713802|5.0|Bill Bryson is so funny, so perspicacious...reading Bryson on a train, (or on an unfortunate bus ride) while alone, leaves one vulnerable to looking maniacal with laughter. It is also hard to catch one's breath when gulping for air while wheezing with laughter.
B009O2XY12|2.0|No instrutions.there should be hint or instructions . I got to level 60 and I'm not getting anywhere. Hints would be nice
B00466HM28|5.0|Compact<br />Sturdy<br />Simple layout<br />Good feedback<br />Quick relay<br />Easy to set up<br />Great Price<br />Works with Reason<br /><br />My husband who has knowledge of Midi controllers and computer based music composition, had no issue with setting the Akai up in Reason. The reviews I read on some of the products seller feedback stated the item was extremely difficult to set up and there are a ton of youtube videos to show you how. It is very simple, but like I said we both our computer majors and he has knowledge of various midi controllers. The feedback is no different on it than other midi controllers within a lower price range. It's great for a portable composing setup and even great for professional set ups. I think it is a great investment. He loved it and it was a gift to him that I chose based on research and he likes based on quality.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Like everyone else, I loved Sookie and Eric. I really loved how Charlaine Harris made me care about what happened to Sookie. Ms. Harris did not make me believe that Sookie and Sam belonged together. I wouldn't be mad about the ending if the \\"essential spark\\" had been evident in this relationship. I am so sad.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is a must read for any woman in business, whether she has aspirations to rise to Sheryl's level or not.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I've been watching \\"Breaking Bad\\" on Netflix for the past few weeks... to say that this show addicting... that would be an understatement.<br /><br />One episode - that's all it takes before \\"Breaking Bad\\" sinks it unrelenting teeth into you. Credit must go to the pure, original concept - a chemistry teacher (dying of lung cancer) chooses to cook meth to secure his family's future - \\"a chemistry teacher\\" being our protagonist, Walter White (aka \\"Walt\\", or \\"Mr. White\\") - a very real character, with quirks of hilarity, and a perfect touch of gutsy badass that string you along through the first season, and propel you right into the next.<br /><br />\\"Breaking Bad\\" pulls no stops - it lingers around extremely tense situations that hit home in the real world, madly fatiguing your emotions... but no sooner when you're at 'wits-end', the scene turns 180° and offers a wonderfully bizarre setting - one that is equally as tense - one that might have you timidly fantasizing about what YOU might do in Walt's shoes. This, sort of, 'yin-yang' plot is reflective of Walt's character - a family man, and drug dealer.<br /><br />As the seasons progress, the plot transforms into a monster. Unforgettable characters are introduced at every turn. The staple characters' situations grow, and become intertwined - all resulting in aesthetic complexity. The lines of good and bad become blurred beyond recognition.  Your love and hate (sometimes both, simultaneously) for the characters will waver almost every episode as you get COMPLETELY blindsided by extremities... it will put on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />If anyone asks me, this is undoubtedly my favorite TV series. I wish I could label myself with something less... contentious... but hey... you can't be satisfied watching Spongebob for the rest of your life, right?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book AHHH amazing..everyone must read it!!!! Team Peeta all the way!!! This book rocks! It's great! Yay
B0058SNIC6|5.0|Love them!!<br /> I'm 7 months pregnant, and they are wonderful!!<br />My co-workers didn't even know they were crocs, very cute and fashionable.
B001DJ69E8|1.0|Its not bad if u like theme music from shows and movies but not what i thought it was. K
B00A81MV3U|3.0|Just okay pretty much describes this movie. How it is Oscar worthy, I still do not understand. The relationship between Jennifer Lawrence and Cooper just seems strange. She is way too young for him and the character she plays seems to be way too old for her. It's just not believable for me. It's a bit slow. Don't get me wrong. It's not the worst movie ever created, but it is definitely not worth watching over and over.<br />It's a movie about two dysfunctional people. That sums this movie up.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the show. The picture quality is amazing. Its good to revisit some things you may have missed first run so it is a must for fans.
B009874S68|4.0|A fantasty full of blood and death and a unique take on vampires. The look of the film is stunning and I cannot wait to see what this team of directors do next.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|this app came in handy for a trip when I needed an alarm clock...the light was bright enough to see clearly, plus it gave me the weather conditions. totally easy to use!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I expected more in a final book after following this series.<br /><br />This seemed to be a quick and dirty means to and end.  The action was lame, and the characters seemed as bored as I was reading it.  I'd hope the spark would come back with the final installment but it was lackluster at best.<br /><br />Oh well, It's been a long road and for the most part a pretty good ride.<br /><br />Regardless, thank you Ms. Harris, it was a pretty good ride.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great because it lets you look at your entry to eliminate mistakes. big and easy to use buttons to tap. well lit.
B0042RUMIW|5.0|Went to this concert so it was a must have for me . Now I will injoy over and over on DVD and<br />my iPod.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|This was my first experience reading a Ken Follett work.  It was fascinating...could not put it down...absolutely wonderful.  I cannot wait to read the second in the series, and look forward to the release of book 3.<br /><br />Follett's characters are spellbinding;  his descriptions marvelous; and his historical accounts most educational.  My only disappointment was that he did not write about the massacre of the Czar and his family.
B000002GYW|3.0|One of my favourite c.d.s..it's the eagles at there best.was really let down because two of the songs skipped ...one if them being the title track....

B009AMANBA|5.0|Great acting by Fields and Day-Lewis.  Good story line.  Will be watched over and over for historic and entertainment value
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|I love the TV show 'Nashville' and its music, especially the songwriting and arrangements. Clare Bowen (who plays Scarlett) has the sweetest voice I've ever heard, and is the reason I purchased this CD. Fans of 'Nashville' will probably enjoy this collection from the show.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|I enjoy true life stories.  Good acting and suspenseful story line. Visual effects are very believable and frightening. Bravo director.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I am a fan of Alicia Keys, love her music and love this hit. Girl on Fire is the bomb.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Have been a Tolkien fan since high school, having read the &#34;hobbit&#34; books several times.  A delightful addition to the &#34;Fellowship of the Rings: series.
B008OTTRXU|4.0|Honestly I bought this cd to listen to my favorite song of Carly Rae's. Call me maybe. I play it constantly and really haven't listened to the entire thing.
B0083D9MXM|3.0|I'm glad to have this set, mainly as a cultural document.  Stokowski was one of these musicians who caught the public imagination, and he seemed to have a genuine interest in making music accessible to regular folks.  He obviously knew how to get what he wanted from an orchestra, often in resplendent sound.  However, not everything works.  For me \\"the \\"good\\" here are the Mendelssohn and Bizet symphonies, the De Falla suite, the Ives,and the encores.  Music should give pleasure, and these discs give pleasure, even though none of them is \\"the best\\" performance out there.  The questionable, for me are the Bach and Beethoven discs.  Orchestral arrangements of Bach's pieces for solo keyboard instruments sound bloated to me -- not revelatory -- even when the sound is good.  I just can't get into them -- maybe my fault.  Stokowski certainly plays them with conviction.  Also questionable is the \\"Emperor\\" with Gould.  The sound is very good indeed, although everything is a bit \\"up close,\\" and Gould's touch and lucidity and even beauty of tone are a pleasure.  The first movement I liked; with all its little quirks, it was alive, even if a bit fussy.  The second movement didn't work -- the phrasing gets glacial, with each note, it seems, being picked out for inspection.  A sense of song and the forward movement get lost.  The \\"ugly,\\" for me, is the Brahms Second, in sound much inferior to the Beethoven of eleven years earlier, and really lacking a sense of  direction.  In the finale, there's no build up, just extreme dynamic variation, and it all just falls to pieces: a real mess all round.  So . . . I'm not sorry to have the box, but it's mixed bag indeed.  When he was good, he was good . . . when he was bad, he was horrid.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|We all know she's the bomb when it comes to some of her music. I love come on baby it's you!!! I sing this constantly, the other songs are good to.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|To start with, the quality of the blu ray box is very good. Nice glossy finish with without any frills. I am not impressed with metal boxes.<br /><br />The series match the quality that was put into the blu ray production.<br /><br />It's scary without going for any cheap thrills. The acting is good. The photography is top-notch (though sometimes I did not understand why some scenes were shot, slanted, without any relation to the scene).<br /><br />Sex ? Well, there are no nude scenes (there are more nude scenes in one episode of Girls than in this entire season). And the sex scenes (only a few) are not tawdry. Hey, this is an adult movie.<br /><br />There are some inconsistencies though. Probably, because they have bought in several directors. But, that is indeed, the good part. Because, you do not feel like watching redundant episodes. Each episode has its character.<br /><br />No unnecessary product placements (a short mention of Nescaf&eacute;, though).  No ridiculous heavy-drinking or chain smoking scenes like in Mad Men.  There are some scenes where one of the gay couple is seen drinking white wine.<br /><br />Ugh. I don't know from where they picked up that.<br /><br />One of those TV series that you watch the whole season in a weekend. It is so addictive. This was not the case of Mad Men or Breaking bad (I have to struggle myself to finish some of their episodes).

B0007OCG56|5.0|GREAT MOVIE<br />one of my favorite movies EVER! i LOVED IT! why havent we seen more of Paz Vega? she IS gorgeous!
B00740FMTS|5.0|This book is an absolute MUST for anyone that has played or plans on playing Bioshock and Bioshock 2.  Even if you've never picked up a game controller you can enjoy this book.  It really delves into the details of just how far the madness of Rapture went after the introduction of ADAM.  I loved every page of it and the ending, though I suspected it was coming, still struck me.
0765365278|4.0|I'm a big Brandon Sanderson fan, and \\"The Way of Kings\\" (Tor, $27.99, 1,008 pages) is a very accomplished book one - and a pretty hefty beginning, as well, checking in at more than 1,000 pages. So I would normally say \\"Jump right in,\\" as it will be a great ride, except for the fact that this may be the first of a ten-book series called the Stormlight Archive.<br /><br />Yes, ten books, and that immediately brings to mind Robert Jordan's seemingly endless Wheel of Time series - which, not coincidentally, Sanderson was hired to complete. And to add even more uncertainty into the equation, Sanderson was supposed to write only one book to wrap up that series (which was begun in 1984), but now will write three.<br /><br />So basically, if you hop on board the Stormlight Archive express, you're on the hook for at least the next decade, assuming that a) it does turn out to be 10 books; b) Sanderson retains his interest in the project; and c) that unlike Jordan, he lives to complete it.<br /><br />Still, Sanderson is a much better writer than Jordan, which is definitely a positive, and \\"The Way of Kings\\" is superior to any book in the Wheel of Time. And as usual, Sanderson's meticulous world-building includes not only an ecology, but a carefully thought-out magical system that has echoes in the culture and society at large.<br /><br />\\"The Way of Kings\\" is set on a planet that is routinely scoured by highstorms, which are powerful, hurricane-like storms that are infused with a magical energy known as Stormlight, or so it appears. The pre-industrial society has Sanderson's usual interesting quirks: In this one, for example, men do not read or write - only women are allowed that skill.<br /><br />The narrative involves the struggle between humans and a humanoid race for control of magical gems that are found in an area known as the Shattered Plains. There are plenty of battles, enhanced with magic, but there are also Sanderson's complex plots and carefully developed characters.<br /><br />I would be unabashedly enthusiastic about \\"The Way of Kings\\" (though it could have used a few more upbeat sections) but for the possibility that it may not finish until we find out who wins the 2022 World Cup. After all, even if all goes as planned, The Wheel of Time will turn to be a 27-year odyssey over 14 volumes.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book was great. A good read that has an in depth look into the lifetime of one of our greatest presidents.
1597801585|4.0|Paolo Bacigalupi is a committed environmentalist, and as such, he looks upon humanity's wreckage of the planet with a jaundiced eye - and thus it follows that \\"The Windup Girl\\" (Night Shade Books. $24.95, 359 pages) is a dystopic vision of a damaged Earth in the late 22nd century.<br /><br />All of the catastrophes that are today predicted to lay waste to the planet (global warming, water shortages, the disappearance of oil) have occurred, and on top of that, the twisted heart of capitalism has resulted in large corporations that first design food plant plagues and then plants that can withstand them. The corporations let loose the plagues and then generously offer to sell countries the plague-resistant plants - which naturally cannot reproduce so there's plenty of income the next year as well.<br /><br />\\"The Windup Girl\\" is set in steamy Bangkok, where Thailand struggles to maintain its independence from the tyranny of the American agricultural corporations, and Bacigalupi deftly details the political power struggles common to all of human history in a setting of looming threats from disease and the encroaching sea.<br /><br />Bacigalupi is a talented writer, fueled by a passionate point of view, and that combination makes \\"The Windup Girl\\" a powerful, if not exactly uplifting, novel. Read it to experience the world we don't want our great-grandchildren to live in.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|Michael never sounded better. I wish that the Cd was all standarts. My favorite is \\"Neverdless I'm in love  with you\\"<br />His voice became more deep and mature. The arrangements are great as always.
0345457692|3.0|I've always been a mystery fan, from Lew Archer to Travis McGee to Hercule Poirot, so mixing a detective story with science fiction doesn't bother me much. But it's only fair to warn prospective readers that `Altered Carbon' (Del Rey, $13.95, 384 pp.) is a lot more hard-boiled detective novel than classical science fiction.<br /><br />Oh, the underpinning is solid scifi: Personalities can be stored electronically and injected into new bodies (called sleeves), and the very rich have cloned sleeves that they can move into on a moment's notice. They even have automatic remote updates so if they're killed, their memories can be restored. The setup involves a Methuselah (one of the rich folks who lives a long time) who commits suicide between one update and the next, and, reincarnated in a new sleeve, wants to know what happened. The police don't like him, or any Meths, as they're called, so they blow him off. He then resleeves (or re-animates, if you will) the hero into a new body on a new planet, and puts him to work solving the crime.<br /><br />Our hero is a nasty ultraviolent sort who's had some special training that makes him extra-tough, which comes in really handy during the many bloody episodes that dot the book. He also has some highly charged encounters with beautiful blondes (some things never change, even in the future) as he unravels one mystery and creates his own elaborate revenge.<br /><br />I confess I was confused by the end, for keeping track of who was in whose body and what had been done to whom was a pretty daunting task, but author Richard K. Morgan had the rhythm and the feel of a Dashiel Hammett novel down pat. If the idea of reading about Sam Spade in a cyberpunk world holds some fascination for you, `Altered Carbon' will be a great ride; if not, though, it won't change your mind about detectives who drink too much and have a taste for snappy repartee while they're getting pistol-whipped.
193700788X|1.0|So...just like everyone else I was so excited to see my last Sookie book in my Kindle list.  This book was not a surprise to me at all.  I always thought she would end the series this way.  I just felt that she should have been building in this direction for more longer than just the last book.  I was also so disappointed in the way Eric was portrayed in the story line. I fell in love with his character since book 3 and wanted some better resolution there for him. The biggest let down though was I felt while reading, that she stuck every single character into one book, even dead ones. Almost as if it was forced. It just wasn't as exciting and fun as the others.
