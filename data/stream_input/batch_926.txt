B002JM1VJG|2.0|After purchasing this dvd, I figured I would go ahead and throw my hat in the ring on the quality controversy. My two star review does not reference the sound quality, the content, or the choice of videos (although I am confused that artistic and theatrical videos such as Bad Girl, Oh Father and This Used To Be My Playground were not included, I do understand the marketing decision to not make other video collections obsolete). It is all about picture quality.    I sampled several videos on a dvd player, where the \\"copied from tv to vhs\\" look was somewhat annoying but not TOO distracting. On a blu-ray player, the quality is ridiculous. As many other reviewers have already stated, there is no excuse for a two-disc collection in 2009 to look like this. It also is insulting to say people are unreasonable to expect videos made in the 80s and 90s to have good picture quality. If you watch video collections by Prince, Eurythmics, Iron Maiden, Smashing Pumpkins, or Tori Amos (all with videos from the 80s and 90s and released several years ago) and compare them to this collection, you see WITHOUT A DOUBT the DRASTIC difference in quality.    While I do say that it is unfair to point out videos such as Erotica (which was filmed intentionally to look grainy and difficult to decipher images) and Give It 2 Me, other videos (I Want You and Bedtime Story specifically) showcase just how bad the transfer is. People that say this collection looks like someone taped it from television onto low quality vhs are ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CORRECT. I am just not sure how much blame goes to a disinterested Warner Bros, or to a disinterested Madonna.     One final note: those wacky black bars on the Justify My Love video. I will file them under \\"unintentional humor.\\" Why not at least make them grainy and fuzzy like the rest of the video so they blend in a little more? By being so dark and so sharp, they just stand out even more and add a touch of comedy. (And, to any conservatives happy about theblack bar, it just brings your eyes right to those sinful and corruptable breasts, so it's all your fault we are engaging in sin).
0385504225|3.0|I liked A&D the most, followed by DC and the lost symbol. Dan Brown builds huge suspense and dramatizes almost every chapter. He mixes clever dialog and suspense with facts and real surroundings. However in almost every case the end result is the same - none of those clever dialogs and suspenseful events lead to any tangible or significant result. It was hard to put DC down but lost symbol didn't have as much substance or thrill. For both DC and lost symbol when I was done I had the same question - notwithstanding thrills along the way, why did I spend so much time on this?
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Snow White is a film that has been released numerous times on various formats. So after awhile you have to stop and wonder, is it possible for them to come up with anything new. Well it's Disney, and the answer is yes. Yet again Disney has put another top notch release. This set is packed with great bonus features. One that stands out is Snow White Returns where Disney found old storyboards for what could have been a possible sequel. We may never know. But the real star of this release is the picture quality. Making it's first appearance on Blu-ray, Snow White looks absolutely amazing. I purchased Snow White back when it first hit VHS and again when it first came out on DVD and dare I say that it looks even better now, than when it was first released in theaters over 70 years ago. They say you can't improve upon perfection, well someone forgot to tell that to Walt Disney. After watching Snow White I can only wait in anticipation for their next home video release.

0316017922|5.0|I read this in the summer and would re-read chapters because I was fascinated with the stories/evidence. By far it is the most incredible dinner, business conversation piece I have ever read. People will be amazed when you ask them a question like: \\"Do you know what ties together most of the Junior Hockey League Professional players?\\" \\"Do you know what causes most major airline crashes?\\"<br />I wish Congress would read his section on education. It should be mandatory reading. (I'm guessing Obama did by his stance on education...)<br />It is a fascinating study on looking at things in new ways, to really see what can be learned. One of the top books I have ever read. Period.
0385513755|3.0|After having read & loved this book when it first came out, I finally shelled out the bucks for the illustrated edition. I wanted to see the different places, items & pictures featured in the book looked like. As such, this review is going to be more about how different a read it is than the non-illustrated version.<br /><br />I'm not going to bother going over the plotline as DVC is one of the most recognizable books out right now. Now as far as the plotline goes, I really enjoyed this book the first time I read it. It's a quick & easy read, with subject matter that's intriguing... whether or not it's actually \\"true\\". My biggest problem with the book is that there's not a lot of re-readablity to DVC. Once I finished the book, I just couldn't get as involved in the plot as I did on the first reading.<br /><br />So as a result, I decided to look into the illustrated edition. The pictures in this are slick & beautiful, so they give me something to look at if I get bored with Brown's book. While that's not exactly a great selling point, it brought a new layer to the book that I'd already read. After going through the illustrated edition, I decided to go ahead & purchase it. Now after doing so, I have to admit that this is really the book that should have been released in the first place. It's a much more entertaining read with the pictures & sites added in.<br /><br />But bottom line? If you didn't really like the book when it first came out, you'll probably want to avoid purchasing this version of it. The pictures are nice, but if you didn't like the book to begin with, this book won't change your mind.
0790749815|5.0|I had to see North by Northwest for Film class and i have to admit that i was glad i got to see one of the finest films in American movie history.    the film is iconic for it's one scene involving the airplane and crop field, but overall, the film is a tribute to one of film's greatest directors, Alfred Hitchock.    North by Northwest is a film about mistaken identity, where Cary Grant gets mistaken as an undercover spy agent, and what follows, is a series of one suspense after another.     i don't want to go to deep into the movie, but i will say this. Unlike the films of today which are big budget, big bombs, sex scene, nude part, etc, North by Northwest is a great film of story making that will have you entrenched from beginning to end.    i highly recommend North by Northwest, and for film class, it's a great film to study.

B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I guess I liked this book more than most of the readers.  I'm not always looking for high falootin' literature, just some entertaining hours of escape.  I heard a couple at the train depot saying that this book seemed to them like Dan Brown was already writing the screen play.  For me, that was a plus.  I listened to this book on audio and it really translated to the \\"theater of the mind\\".  98% of the book was a page turner (CD turner?).  I'll admit the ending was weak - possibly non-existant.  All in all I give Lost Symbol a thumbs up....bg
B0013K1ALE|5.0|I have always liked \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" but after seeing this video I can say I am a fan. In my youth I felt Led Zeppelin was too heavy metal. Now that I am alot older and wiser, I realize how talented each one of them are, and why they are fantastic together. Music was great! Recommend this video for everyone.
0385504225|5.0|What Erasmus did with irony in `The Praise of Folly', Dan Brown does with suspense in `The Lost Symbol': identify religion where it `established itself as a tollbooth to heaven'.<br />`God is Dead'.

0810994739|5.0|The first book was good, the third one was good, this one was great!  This book gives a great realistic story!  Though the other ones were good this one was surprisingly funnier!  My favorite joke was when the power went out on poor Greg Heffley when he was on the computer.  Ha Ha!  Can't wait for the movie in 2010!
076781326X|5.0|This is indeed a fantastic movie/musical.  Many many fun and singable songs like \\"I'd do anything for you\\" and \\"Oom pah pah\\".  Our kids very much enjoyed it and the movie teaches great lessons about the existance of people who start life with a tragedy and how society responds.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Bought this controller when it was on sale at Amazon which offered the free PS3 Airman guitar. This is a great wireless controller for the price of similar wireless 2.4Ghz controllers offered by non-oems. I'd rather get this Bluetooth versus 2.4 since you don't need a dongle or use up a USB port if you get this one. Highly recommended.

0385504225|4.0|I have to declare from the onset that I am a Freemason. This book is therefore of interest to me. Having read the book over two weekends I have to say that I am impressed with Brown's intellectual bandwidth as it relates to his knowledge of the esoteric. Any author who can reference the works of Bro. Manly P. Hall, Alesteir Crowley and Sir Francis Bacon ( Brown seemed to be particularly impressed with Bacon)  has done his background reading. I would love to tour Brown's personal libray.  Brown's portrayal of Masonry as comprising honourable men like the book's 33 degree Masons Peter Solomon and Warren Bellamy is indeed accurate. The central theme of the book is that man has not realized his full potential and can do so through tapping into lost knowledge that is contained / encrypted in the higher degrees of Masonry and is also being unwraveled by Noetic science.
0385504225|4.0|Friends: If you love Dan Brown as much as I do, OF COURSE you want to read this book and it is a great story and a \\"great ride\\" so to speak. But when it all comes to an end, if you are like me, you will say to yourself: \\"WHAT? That is what all this was about!\\" WHAT A DISAPPOINTING and very preachy ENDING. DAN: If you are listening? What the hell is wrong with you?
0879309210|4.0|This is a must have for all you DIY's out there. It has soo much info I still can´t finish it. Of course there are some points less important than others, depends on your interests, but I think that every guitar owner/lover should have one of these just in case something gets broken or if you want to save some money in technisians labour hours...better do it yourself!
B001U7FWM8|4.0|If you are a Radiohead fan, this will be an easy band and CD to fall in love with. Thick haunting atmosphere, lots of bleeps and beeps,  intense melodies, beautiful vocals and mystery-vailed lyrics (notably more optimistic than Radiohead's). A bit darker than the band's previous CD \\"The Yellow House.\\" At first listen the CD seems far tooo slow and thick to get through. But I've grown to love it eventually and still listen to it a lot several months after purchasing.   Southern Point - quick and very U2-inspired  Two Weeks - gorgeous harmonies  Fine for now - could have been a tune for a Broadway production of Henrik Ibsen or another thick philosopher  Cheerleader - the most accessible track and the gateway song for a newcomer to the band   Dory - yup, it's about the Dory from Nemo and fittingly slow  Ready, Able - one of my absolute favorite Grizzly tracks ever. Doesn't end the way one might think it will, great lyrics and a brilliant hook.   Foreground - Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, dark, brooding and introspective. Bears resemblance to Radiohead's Videotape.
B000V1Z0GW|4.0|Okay, Haitink's RING is not the most bombastic, a la Solti, and it doesn't have a cast that's exactly in the same league as the Solti, or Karajan, or even the 1955 Keilberth on Testament, but if you aren't looking for the complete 14 hours or so of a complete RING, this set is a good alternative of essential highlights with singers who, on the whole, aren't all that bad considering what we're listening to today.  The fifth disc is a bit of a throwaway unless you're fluent in French and need a French musicologist identifying all the major leitmotifs for you.  For the price, you really can't go wrong.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|let me start off by saying that i am not one to write reviews, but i was really surprised by this little device. i was looking for a firewire adapter to plug in my 3rd gen touchwheel ipod into my new macbook and this was my only option. i was really skeptical about this, but after extensive research, i finally gave in and bought it. let me just say that i am writing to you potential/wary buyers right now while my old school ipod is charging through my computer!!! in addition, my itunes window popped up and the little ipod icon appeared without any trouble (i was worried that my ipod would be too outdated for the new itunes..)! i can finally add playlists to my ipod again! very awesome product.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in the last ten years. I'm a fan of movies from the 1930s and '40s much more than I am of current movies. Benjamin Button is the type of story that could have been made in that golden era of Hollywood, but with much better special effects. The movie haunted me for days after my first viewing and I had to watch it a few more times to absorb some of the small details that make the movie a lot more fun.    I've recommended it to everyone I know who likes well-made, quality movies with good story lines.

B001F12J0C|4.0|I could just as easily given this a 5-star rating, but  whether it makes any sense or not I gave it a 4-star.    I found nothing wrong with the product. It was as it  was advertised. I received it in just 3 or 4 days and  in good condition.    My only regret is that I would have rather had the standard screen version than the wide screen version.  I don't remember noticing if it was available in the  standard screen version, and it may have been in the  HD format. Nonetheless, too late.
1597370053|4.0|Dorian Gray is an exceptionally handsome young man, but when he sees his portrait and realizes his own beauty he wishes that the painting would grow old while he could remain young. At first he is mortified when he finds changes in his painted image, but influenced by a friend Dorian begins to seek the pleasures in life. No matter what depths he sinks to his handsome face remains unchanged, while the portrait grows uglier and more hideous, burdened not only by age but by his debauched lifestyle.<br /><br />I don't know if this work of literature is as widely read as it maybe once was but I was quite taken in by the story. It's interesting that Dorian, instead of using the portrait as a type of conscience to correct his actions, instead takes strange delight in observing the change. He revels in his freedom from outward consequences and digs deeper, delving into every pleasure. In some ways the separate manifestations of the individual reminded me of [[ASIN:158049577X Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]], while his recognition of his outward appeal and how it would fade seemed to have shades of Bradbury's [[ASIN:0380977265 Dandelion Wine]].  And the character of Lord Henry is interesting, always in the background congratulating him and encouraging Dorian's sensual hedonism. But it's also a critique of society, both Victorian and today: we spend our time and money trying to reverse the effects of age (the gym, cosmetics and cosmetic surgery, etc.); companies spend billions idealizing (or idolizing) \\"youth\\"; and some even even seek to excuse away weakness and place blame elsewhere. In all, it may not be a perfect story but it's very interesting and thought-provoking.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|Its exactly as it says. Its a Daft punk album set to thte album Discovery. Its an amazing story that keeps you in the plot as well as loving the music. I wish they'd do this more often!!
B002C6K7N0|3.0|The guitar work in this album is some of the fastest and most verocious ever, but what drags this album down are the painful lyrics.  There's no catchiness, nothing that stays in your head.  Mostly, I listened while cringing at some of the wordy phrases.  It wouldn't be hard to make some of these tracks brilliant by simply speaking less.
0738711500|5.0|I have for years wanted to investigate Tarot.  I had absolutely no idea where to begin.  I did an internet search for background info and found a huge quantity of sites that deal with Tarot...but few that helped a neophyte like myself to really engage.  this \\"Kit\\" is very user friendly, organized and written in terms that are both entertaining and informative.    I have been learning and enjoying these tools.  will I be able to predict the future?! Who knows?! But, I will have a better chance thanks to this kit.  A good price point for a tool that delivers.
B000001ESJ|3.0|Back in the 1970s, rock bands were compelled to put out a new album at least once a year. Not only did this keep the money rolling in, but it also kept them continuously in the public eye. Of course, this led to a lot of half-hearted, lackluster albums with filler material. Rush did better than most bands, but this album and the previous album (2112) both suffered from a major drop-off in quality on \\"side two\\". In fact, if the band had waited and put side 1 of 2112 with side 1 of A Farewell to Kings, you'd have an almost perfect Rush album.    This album starts off with the vastly under-rated title track. Why this song has been mostly forgotten by everyone except the die-hards is beyond me. With its lyrical attack on academia and politicians, its jazzy center section, a brilliant vocal from Geddy Lee, and one of Alex Lifeson's most awe-inspiring solos EVER, this is one of the band's greatest moments. Likewise with \\"Xanadu\\", the sci-fi epic based on Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \\"Kubla Khan\\". It's no accident I've never met a Rush fan who didn't like this song, as this is a true classic and a long-time concert favorite.    \\"Side two\\" is a bit more problematic. \\"Cinderella Man\\" is a good song. \\"Madrigal\\" is a nice change-of-pace, but a little too precious. I know a lot of people like \\"Cygnus X-1\\", but I consider it to be one of the band's biggest mistakes ever. It blatently sounds like it was thrown together in a hurry, a last-minute sound-check composition written to fill out the album. This song alone costs A Farewell to Kings two whole stars: so bad, it's BAD. Rush has never been a singles band, but I think they were trying with \\"Closer to the Heart\\". I know this is now a concert sing-along favorite (especially the version on Exit Stage Left), but the only thing that saves this song for me is the wonderful guitar-playing of Alex Lifeson. Mr. Zivojinovich (Lifeson's real last name for the uninitiated) is Rush's true MVP. I'm convinced the band's entire reputation todayrests mostly on his shoulders.    Today this album is mostly disowned by the band. There's a self-consciousness now about Rush, where it seems they're really insecure about how their fans perceive them. In interviews, there's this attitude of: \\"We're not rock stars, we're just regular guys, but please respect our privacy. A Farewell to Kings was written back in our Serious days, but now let's have a reggae version of 'Closer to the Heart'\\". They're very thin-skinned regarding any criticism, and there's no hunger or risk-taking any more. It's just 3 old guys indulging in their hobby while trying to be hip, so of course they pour \\"Was that really us?\\" contempt on their earlier recordings. After this album, the band would go on to write and record two of their best albums ever, 1978's Hemispheres and 1980's Permanent Waves. A Farewell to Kings was an important step along the way, but \\"Cygnus X-1\\" prevents it from making any claim to greatness. I would have loved to have seen them with UFO on the tour that year.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|Like most fans of Alice In Chains, I was skeptical when I learned that the band was reuninting with a new singer and still using the same band name. Granted that Jerry Cantrell is the primary founder and song-writer of the band, but Layne Staley just seemed too crucial to the group's unique sound, and it just wouldn't be AIC without him. However, I was excited that Cantrell was going back to working with Sean Kinney and Mike Inez, so the result had to be good...I just wasn't sure if it would be worthy of the AIC name.<br />By the time I heard \\"Check My Brain,\\" my mind was changed entirely. This song is classic AIC, like something straight off their 1995 self-titled album. I can honestly say that this song is worthy of a spot next to some of the group's best material. The other single, \\"A Looking In View\\", is quite good to. This tune reminds me of the sound they had for the 2 new songs they recorded 10 years ago for the Music Bank boxed set...only heavier. The album opener, \\"All Secrets Known,\\" is a decent song but it's not as strong of an opener as something like \\"We Die Young\\" or \\"Them Bones.\\" It sounds like AIC, but it kinda drags on and doesn't go in many directions. \\"Last Of My Kind\\" starts off with a sludgy guitar riff, not unlike something from Dirt or the self-titled album. The new singer, William DuVall, gets a bit more singing time on this track than most of the others. When William harmonizes with Jerry, it sounds just like Layne and Jerry...but when he sings solo, he doesn't sound anything like Layne at all. However, his melodies make it very easy to imagine Layne singing the same lines, and this song is a great example of that, and it's one of my favorites on the album. \\"Your Decision\\" is likely to be the next single, and it sounds like something from Sap or Jar Of Flies. I like this tune, it reminds me of listening to the band back in 1994 when I was 12 years old and had just discovered the group. \\"When The Sun Rose Again\\" is another acoustic number, and although the singing sounds like classic AIC, the hypnotic guitar riff offers something new rather than just rehashing old sounds. It also has some nice lead guitar work. \\"Acid Bubble\\" is sorta slow and sludgy, like \\"Frogs\\" from the last album. But at 2 different points the song starts to rock out and you can't help but bang your head to it. Then there's \\"Lesson Learned,\\" in which the singing sounds a lot like something from the Dirt era. I didn't think much of this tune on the first listen, but after a few spins it definitely gets stuck in your head. \\"Take Her Out\\" is a good tune, but honestly it could pass for something from one of Cantrell's solo records (which weren't bad, they just didn't touch AIC). \\"Private Hell\\" reminds me a lot of \\"Down In A Hole\\", but it's not so similar that it can't stand on its own. The last song is the title track; \\"Black Gives Way To Blue.\\" This song honestly doesn't sound like any past AIC tunes, but I like that it's unique. Elton John plays piano, and you can really feel the love in Jerry's lyrics towards Layne Staley. My only complaint with this song is that it could've lasted a bit longer and perhaps had some sort of climax at the end.<br />So there you have it! It's a great album, especially when compared to all the generic radio-friendly rock that's out there right now. This album takes you back to a time when even mainstream rock had a real edge to it. Obviously, I can't say that this album is every bit as good as the band's previous albums, but it's still a great record. It's a big step up from Cantrell's solo albums, and you can tell this isn't something the group just cranked out to sell records. It's obvious that they poured a lot of hard work into this album. Some stuff on here is slightly forgettable compared to classic AIC, but other stuff is every bit as good! Even if you have your doubts, I highly suggest giving this album a try. As some people have said, Alice with a new singer is better than no Alice at all.though the singing sounds like classic AIC, the hypnotic guitar riff offers something new rather than just rehashing old sounds.

The sub makes up for that loss if ( but only if ) you need direct fill with the bounce, if not turn it off.<br /><br />- The spot beam pattern is funny, the 5D mk2 does lock on with it but not as fast as the spot beam pattern from the 580, also no where does it say how to turn the spot beam off.<br /><br />- Wireless works but I need to test it alot more to see just how well.<br /><br />- the zoom head makes lots of weird noises, not just mine but all other nissin units I have tried, normal but it just sounds like there is something broken when it is not.<br /><br />- Who ever wrote the manual needs to learn English, it is honestly the worst written ( but still understandable ) of the recent manuals I have read recently, Honestly your almost better off figuring it out on your own as the menu system is easy to figure out.<br /><br />- Good built in diffuser and bounce card, the stofen I have for the 580 also fits the nissin, a tight but usable fit. Nissin needs to add a pocket in the included flash case for the shoe stand like canon does, as it is the show stand will just get lost somewhere.<br /><br />- Great battery tray, all batteries fit in the same direction and pop the tray in, works very well in the dark, nissin you need to offer the trays for sale separately.<br /><br />- This flash needs to add a low battery warning, I'm also sure that lcd saps battery power more than the regular mono colour ones.<br /><br />- my Opteka external battery pack works with this and the 580, no adapter needed but I will break the rubber cover on the flash it's not well attached.<br /><br />- Waiting to see firmware upgrades, they might just fix some of the missing but needed menu items ( turning off the lcd or spot beam etc )<br /><br />- Nice my ttl menu item, you can set the flash to consistently expose in ettl with a exposure comp, ie set 1/3 or 2/3 stop more or less so you can match the exposures of other flashes you may have, I found the Nissin to expose 1/3-1/2 stop more than the 580 but I have the 580 set to 1/3 comp consistently. Now I have them both balanced to each other and can swap flashes at will and not see the difference in pics.<br /><br />- so far the flash is not compatibly with the 5d mk2s flash control from camera ( another firmware fix ? )<br /><br />So a few gripes but for the price vs performance I think it's a good buy, I would buy it again over a 430 or other similarly priced flash, I think the MEtz 58 is better than this nissin but it and the canon 580 both cost more with no real performance difference, but they do have some features/ build that makes the price difference worth it.<br /><br />Based on price alone I would give the 866 a 5 star but it has pro aspirations and it needs some improvement so it gets a 4.hoe stand like canon does, as it is the show stand will just get lost somewhere.    - Great battery tray, all batteries fit in the same direction and pop the tray in, works very well in the dark, nissin you need to offer the trays for sale separately.    - This flash needs to add a low battery warning, I'm also sure that lcd saps battery power more than the regular mono colour ones.    - my Opteka external battery pack works with this and the 580, no adapter needed but I will break the rubber cover on the flash it's not well attached.     - Waiting to see firmware upgrades, they might just fix some of the missing but needed menu items ( turning off the lcd or spot beam etc )    - Nice my ttl menu item, you can set the flash to consistently expose in ettl with a exposure comp, ie set 1/3 or 2/3 stop more or less so you can match the exposures of other flashes you may have, I found the Nissin to expose 1/3-1/2 stop more than the 580 but I have the 580 set to 1/3 comp consistently.

B002K0WBXW|4.0|I haven't laughed this much during a romantic-comedy! So far, I can't recall the other films of this genre making me laugh this much. Sandy and Ryan's on-screen chemistry really made this work. Sure the premise and the plot is not new, but it was refreshing to see the story again. I took one star off because of Sandra's character. I feel like it could've been written a little better. There were times where I felt like she went out of character. Not in a very obvious way and I don't want to give details so I don't spoil it for those who haven't seen it. Maybe it was Sandra's acting, maybe it was how it was written.    But other than that, I loved this story. I especially liked the awkwardness they portrayed and how they had to keep their real motive a secret.      Plot - 4/5  Premise - 5/5  Dialogue - 4/5  Character - 4/5
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|Both myself and my children love this CD. Songs are very soft and soothing. My son listened to it every night from 19 months (when it first came out) to 3 1/2 years old, my daughter loved it as well. Now we are getting it for our newest member!
B000AAVG1W|5.0|I really enjoyed this CD. Have them all and have yet to really pick a favorite. This one has the potential of being the most played though. Much better than 'Karmacode', which as another reviewer stated was like \\"Korn\\" but with a female lead.   This Cd is just great music, great vocals, and heavy enough to help test the best speakers.
1416550542|5.0|Compelling tale told in a fascinating manner that keeps you guessing while eagerly reading just a few pages more too see what happens next and to garner more clues.    Some may find the switching between different characters in different time periods a bit confusing.    But for those who enjoy paying close attention and watching the various bits and pieces of a puzzle come together to tie off all the loose ends and form a cohesive and comprehensive picture with a thoroughly satisfying conclusion it is delightful.

B001IHJ97E|2.0|I remember seeing Brainstorm in the theaters and loved it. The VHS was OK, and the first DVD was an OK transfer as well. Then again, the TV I was watching it on was a knob-tuner 19\\". Again I enjoyed the movie though the heart attack/death scene gave my ex some bad nightmares. Now I have a 50\\" plasma and wanted a better DVD. This one looked promising but failed. Hopefully they'll bring out a blu-ray and just leave the original movie alone. As some have mentioned, not the greatest of acting but a good story and great effects (remember it was done in 1983).  What I can't understand is why they stripped out scenes for this \\"remastered\\" version. The sound is improved but they had no need of removing anything. Not as bad as what happened with the 'Director's Cut of 'Bladerunner', but nearly so. I'm almost sorry I trashed my VHS.
032147404X|4.0|Sometimes, the jokes and fun stuff got a bit much, but the tips are good. For me, choosing aperture and shutter speed is always a challenge, as well as the Program, Aperture, Shutter & Manual settings on the Nikon D80. Scott's tips are good. I can reread them again and again to help remember. I also liked the mix of camera techniques and Photoshop Elements tips. I recommend the book.
0375713751|4.0|When I went back to work after the birth of my first child, I read a lot of these working-mom-makes-good books. You know, the ones that set out to show you that you're not the only one to show up at a client meeting with a spit-up stain on her suit jacket, or to have bags under the bags under her eyes from trying to juggle home and a career. In my opinion, though, this is the best of the bunch.<br /><br />I Don't Know How She Does It hit home for me because the heroine shares my industry (public relations/advertising). The novel is set in England so some of the language and pop culture references are a little off, but its a great story of a mom finding herself without losing herself.<br /><br />Plus, it's hysterical. Highly recommended for any mom who gnashes her teeth when some well meaning person asks her just how she does it...
B0001VV1GK|3.0|I just received the parking garage for my 2.5 year old son.    Here are my comments.  1.  It took about 1 hour to put together.  The holes were not drilled on the designs per the instructions so it's important to follow the drill holes and not the pattern on the wood.  I suppose, because there was an error on ours, we could return it.  However, the kids don't notice that the yellow checked pattern should be on the other side.  This is weird to explain, let's just say that when attempting to line up the garage correctly, I finally just stopped looking at the patterns on the pieces.  2.  The elevator is cute and works (make sure to drop it between the posts before tighting the poll screws).   The only problem is that the elevator is SMALL and will only fit Plan City vehicles which are much smaller than most match box cars.  When my son puts a matchbox car in the elevator it jams on the second level because the car is too long.   I am waiting for the string to break because I don't think my son \\"gets it\\" that the elevator could break.  He just says, \\"my car is stuck\\" and keeps cracking the wheel.  3.  The little gas station at the bottom is so low to the ground and under the garage in such a way that the entire garage should sit on a table or elevated surface for the kids to actually want to play with that aspect of the toy.  4.  Both of my kids (5 year old and 2.5) are enjoying the product thus far.  My son says \\"pick me up\\" and my daughter will work the elevator, etc.    5. Quality:  the ramps are not secure and fall off VERY easily.  My son can not play with this toy independently because of the ramps, the elevator getting stuck, and not being able to see the gas pumps to work them properly.  My 5 year old daughter can play with it just fine.  I am looking to purchase a different garage toy that might hold my sons attention longer independently and fits Matchbox cars.
0439023491|5.0|Before I begin this review, I should start with a disclaimer: if I could give this book more than five stars, I would. I tip my hat to you, Ms. Collins. Not only did you surpass my expectations for the sequel to The Hunger Games, you managed to write a follow up that was actually better than its predecessor. Wow.<br /><br />Catching Fire picks up six months after the end of The Hunger Games. Katniss and Peeta are recovering from their experience in the Hunger Games arena, and have settled into their lives in the Victor's Village. Now that every day isn't a struggle to stay fed, Katniss has some free time on her hands. She still hunts and trades at the Hob, spends Sundays with Gale hunting in the woods, and tries not to think about the approaching nationwide Celebration Tour and the next Hunger Games, where she'll serve as mentor for the first time and have to use her lessons learned to try to keep another young girl from District 12 alive. Through it all, Katniss is also still holding her breath, waiting for fallout from her act of rebellion at the end of the last Hunger Games, and hoping that her family and loved ones aren't punished for her transgressions.<br /><br />In addition to Katniss' own personal issues -- including her ongoing confusion over her feelings for both Peeta, her fellow champion, and Gale, her life-long best friend -- changes are sweeping the nation. There are rumors of uprisings in other districts, supposedly stemming from Katniss' act of defiance against the Capitol. Soon, the plot escalates to a frenzied pitch with not one, but two incredible twists that actually made me exclaim out loud. Both times.<br /><br />I've called The Hunger Games the best book of 2008, and I stand by that claim. However, I can also easily say that Catching Fire is unquestionably the best YA book of 2009. I've recommended Hunger Games to almost every reader I know, and look forward to continuing to spread the word about Suzanne Collins' amazing series. I only have one negative comment to add: Collins is the queen of cliff-hanger endings, and I found this one to be especially brutal. It will be TORTURE waiting until 2010 for resolution to this thrilling story.e negative comment to add: Collins is the queen of cliff-hanger endings, and I found this one to be especially brutal.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|So far I've been amazed by what Blu-ray could do but when I heard that Disney was coming out with Snow White on Blu-ray I was a little skeptic. How much can Blu-ray really do to make a 72 year old movie look better than it did on DVD. The answer is a lot. Snow White looks amazing on Blu-ray and it really is shocking to see how up to date the animation looks. I won't bore you with a synopsis of the movie since you probably have seen it.     For parents who have kids who haven't seen the movie this is a great buy as your kids will want to watch it again and again. Adults who haven't seen this classic in ages will get a lot out of this release as well. This is a great buy even if you don't have a blu-ray player since it comes with the DVD version as well. Blu-ray is the future so you'll probably end up getting one. It's nice to see Snow White look so new again.
031604461X|5.0|[close] I was so looking forward to the release of \\"Breaking Dawn\\", I downloaded one of those widgets to count down the minutes on my laptop.<br /><br />That said, was the book so great that it warranted a widget? Probably not. It's definitely not the best book in the Twilight series. But it is the last book of the series, and managed to tie a complex and sometimes convuluted multi-character story into a fairly neat little bow.<br /><br />There were lots of things I loved about the book. I really liked Meyer's deviation from Bella's point of view in the book's middle chapters. This block of the story -- narrated by Jacob -- was surprising, but I thought it really worked. The plot twists going on at that point of the book were best told by someone not intimately involved in Bella and Edward's strange circumstances. I also think (okay, hope! Desperately hope!) that this section might have been a test run to see how readers reacted to Jacob's voice as a future central character... maybe of a spinoff series? Maybe one starring Jake and a certain unforgetably-named young Cullen? Who knows. Meyer has said that \\"Breaking Dawn\\" ultimately concludes Bella and Edward's story, but that she hasn't closed the door on other stories that might take place in the Twilight universe but with other central characters. So this conflicted co-member of Team Jacob/Team Edward will just have to cross her fingers and hope, I guess. ;-)<br /><br />I also thought that Bella's development was great in this novel. She grew up in spades. She discovered a love bigger than the one she felt for Edward (and some of the exchanges between Bella and her new Great Love had me in helpless, snuffling tears - very emotionally charged.) She learned to tap into gifts she didn't know that she had. All good stuff.<br /><br />There are a lot of new characters in this book, and Meyer helps readers deal with the inevitable confusion by posting a handy-dandy chart in the back of the book. I referred to it more than once, so it was a good move.<br /><br />The bad news? Limited use of some of my favorite characters. A lot of build up and not much action. And that unforgettable character name. I'm still shaking my head over that one.<br /><br />That aside, once I got past the shock of the big surprising plot twist of Meyer's, I really enjoyed the book. Did it \\"jump the shark\\" a little? Probably. But it provides a satisfying conclusion for most of the key characters, and hope for the future. And really, that's all that a fan like me could ask for..     The bad news?

B000000OQ5|5.0|Without exception, this is as good as anything ever released by anyone. I'd rank this one with Who's Next, Aerosmith's Toys, and Floyd's Dark Side. It's that good.
0439023483|5.0|If I had to pick just one book that I most enjoyed in 2008, this would probably be it. Now, I have to add the caveat that I read lots of series this year, and it seemed unfair to try to pick one book from a series like Meyers' Twilight books or Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse saga. So Hunger Games did get a little help in that department. But even with that said.... wow. This is just a great book.<br /><br />In The Hunger Games, Collins creates another one of those dystopian societies that I love so much. In her world, America is no longer. There's been some kind of a big life-changing event that has reduced the nation into 12 disticts, all under totalitarian rule by the Capital. In this world, the people are starving and once a year, young people ages 12-18 are forced to enter their names into a drawing to participate in The Hunger Games, a life-or-death reality show from hell in which the victors are treated to a life of luxury while all the other competitors perish.<br /><br />Yes, the story is a little familiar. It's reminiscent of The Long Walk or The Running Man by Stephen King, and there's a little bit of Lord of the Flies in here, too. But the characters are well developed and likeable. The dialogue is great. And -- here's the best part -- its only the first book. The story ends with a major cliffhanger that drove me to immediately visit Amazon to figure out how long I had to wait for the next installment. Now that's the sign of a good read. It's destined to become one of the titles I read again and again, if someone buys it for me for Christmas this year. (hint! hint!)
B0009RCPY8|5.0|This is a great edition of Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters 2.  When first released there were some mistakes in the aspect ratio information on the cover and inserts (this lead to some confusion about the aspect ratios of these DVDs), but those errors have all been corrected.  These DVDs are widescreen and the cover and insert info is all correct now.
0451196716|5.0|Another favorite from Stephen King, and another paperback on my shelf that's almost too ragged to read. The Long Walk (originally published under King's pseudonym, Richard Bachman) is one of those books that gets better the more times you read it. The premise is actually pretty flat -- In the not-too-distant future, a group of 100 teenage boys is selected each year to participate in The Long Walk. Basically, the participants in this reality show death march begin walking in Maine and continue south as a group until they can walk no longer. If they drop beneath a certain speed, they're shot. If they stop for any reason (no bathroom breaks here, folks), they're shot. Blisters and head colds are a matter of life and death in this especially brutal race.<br /><br />That said, there's not much action in this book. The story focuses on the relationships and friendships that emerge among the walkers, and how these individuals change along the journey. As always, King draws characters that are memorable and very real. He parcels out information about them little by little, allowing the reader to get to know them alongside the other Long Walkers. It's hard not to get emotionally involved when they fall, one by one, along the side of the road.<br /><br />The ending is typical King -- is it a happy one? Does the \\"winner\\" get his \\"prize?\\" I've read the book many times and I still can't make up my mind. But I challenge you to read it and draw your own conclusion.
B000UR9QGW|1.0|Big fan of the film and Raimi's low-budget comedy horror stylings, but this has to rank as the worst blu ray I regret to own. If you upgraded to hi def for the picture quality, don't bother with this one. Its absolutely shocking, with terrible use of noise reduction that gives everything a wax-like appearance. Go with the book of the dead edition until Anchor Bay fixes this mess.
0786838655|4.0|I think it's difficult to write a review for Percy Jackson and the Olympians without drawing comparisons to Harry Potter. Both are about boys with mysterious lineage coming into their own around puberty, and their subsequent, fantastic adventures.<br /><br />However, it is wrong to say that Rick Riordan \\"ripped off\\" J.K. Rowling in this book. The Lightning Thief treads much of the same territory, but also introduces young readers into the world of Greek mythology without sacrificing any of the fun that made the Potter books such a huge success.<br /><br />The first book in the series focuses on Perseus \\"Percy\\" Jackson, a 12-year-old boy with lots of problems. He and his mother live with his boorish stepfather, he's always getting kicked out of one boarding school after another, and he struggles with ADHD and dyslexia. These problems seem small, however, after he begins to encounter threatening, mythical monsters everywhere he goes, from a museum field trip to a beach vacation with his mother. He soon ends up at Hogwarts -- er, I mean, Camp Half Blood -- where he will begin his hero training and hopefully learn more about his personal history, including the identity of his undetermined Olympian father.<br /><br />Much of the story follows new demigod Percy on his quest to find the title character -- the person who has stolen Zeus' master lightning bolt. He's helped along the way by two friends: intelligent, Hermione-esque fellow demigod, Annabeth, and his goofy satyr guardian, Grover.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book, although its tone is a bit more YA than I'm used to. I think it's very reminiscent of the earliest Harry Potter books, and am interested to see if Riordan's voice and stories mature in future volumes of the series like the Harry Potter books did. Although the \\"surprises\\" and plot \\"twists\\" will be pretty obvious to most adult readers -- or even younger readers with an understanding of mythology -- it doesn't diminish the story. The modernization of Greek mythology and its integration in our contemporary society is lots of fun, and will give readers of any age some good laughs. I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Overall, a very enjoyable read from a series I can't wait to explore further. This is a book I'll look forward to reading with my kids in the next few years... not that I plan to wait that long to get my hands on the next book, The Sea of Monsters.gration in our contemporary society is lots of fun, and will give readers of any age some good laughs.

1416914307|5.0|I am a male, 33 years old, and a very eclectic reader. I like historical fiction, westerns, thrillers and a number of other Genres. This series grabbed my attention and kept it up to the finish. Yes it was a bit predictable at times, and I knew what was going to happen before it did, but that in no way took away from the story or the suspense in these books. I do get a little tired of the whole teenage angst (i.e. Twilight), including the homosexual sub-plot, but I can look past it and enjoy a good a read that helps you escape from the \\"Mundane\\" world. I don't think you will be sorry if you pick these books up. I thoroughly enjoyed the world the author has created.
0765317389|5.0|I can see why Ender's Game has won so many awards, including earning a place among the Top 100 books for young people. Although the story is very sci fi, it's actually an interesting discussion on children and how society treats our brightest, gifted kids.<br /><br />The book begins with the government monitoring six-year-old Ender Wiggins, a child born as a result of specific government permission giving his parents the right to have a third child in a time when more than two is unheard of -- and even a source of shame. His two older siblings are also brilliant, but weren't quite right for the government's needs. Ender, on the other hand, is a perfect fit for Battle School.<br /><br />At the tender age of six, he's taken from his family for the priveledge of attending Battle School in space. He won't see his parents again until he is 12, but he is escaping the clutches of his jealous and sociopathic older brother, Peter, who is bent on killing his superior sibling. Unfortunately, he also has to leave his beloved sister, Valentine, the only person in the world he really loves.<br /><br />Ender is a fascinating character. I had to keep reminding myself that he was only six -- like my own son. His genius shows through in every exchange, but Card also does a good job of showing that albeit exceptional, Ender is still a little boy. He makes mistakes. He has regrets. In the end, I was reminded of another child genius in literature -- Charles Wallace from A Wrinkle in Time. Both antisocial, both brilliant, and both fascinating characters I won't soon forget.<br /><br />My only criticism about Ender's Game is that some of the battle practice scenes get a bit repetitive. They all serve a purpose in showing Ender's growth and development, but they wore on me a bit. I enjoyed the secondary story highlighting Peter and Valentine's efforts to stir up rebellion back on Earth, posing as adults on the Internet and using their superior intelligence to herd adults toward war - just to see if they can. It's great stuff.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the book and am glad I can say that I've read this classic. I loved the characters -- but wish it was just a bit less military-focused. I think young men will love this book, and anyone that loves science fiction should definitely give it a try.at stuff.

B001AVCFK6|1.0|I can't say enough terrible things about this peice of garbage of a movie. I love Star Trek, i own all the seasons of every series on DVD, I like most of the movies but, if you're a fan of Star Trek save yourself the anger that this pile of crap will instill in you, and give it a miss.    What's wrong with it? I honestly don't know where to start... every single scene can be just picked apart and critcised endlessly. They took all existing mythology surrounding the series, everything that was coolo about Star Trek, and dumbed it down into a cutesy, pop-culture mess. From the fact that Spock is about 80 years old in the original series, yet looks as young as Kirk in thios movie (I guess Vulcans just suddenly age a lot between 65 and 80) to the fact that Spock is boning Uhuru, and has STRONG EMOTIONS about whether he should continue with their relationship or devote himself fully to Starfleet, to the fact that the Federation's Flagship gets it's ass kick by a danged mining vessel... J.J. Abrams should be hanged for producing this offense to Trek fans evertywhere.    And these are pretty harsh closing words for this review but, it has to be said... if you consider yourself s Star Trek fan and you actually liked this movie? You never understood Star Trek in the first place.    Thsi is Space 90210... not Star Trek. Too bad I coudn't have given it a negative score... 1 star is more than it deserves.
0307276902|5.0|[close] I read A Million Little Pieces right before the big \\"it's-all-a-lie\\" scandal errupted on Oprah.<br /><br />I think the book lost a lot of its impact for me after learning that it was largely fabricated by the author. But really, its still a great book.<br /><br />A Million Little Pieces is the story of Frey's gradual, painful recovery from drug addiction at a well-known rehabilitation center in Minnesota. It took me a long time to get used to Frey's writing style -- his repetition (and repetition, and oh yeah, the repetition) can really wear on a reader and probably added 20-30 additional pages to the manuscript. Conservatively.<br /><br />However, the story sucked me in and actually kept a hold on me even after the book was finished. My biggest question after learning of Frey's \\"liberties\\" in his storytelling was about Lilly, the central character's love interest and fellow addict: was she real? That character was the most compelling for me -- I felt for her circumstances and thought her relationship with the narrator added a very real dynamic to the book.<br /><br />I think the answer to that question is that Lilly is (like many of the other characters in the book) a composite of several people from Frey's own experience. More of the author's liberties at work.<br /><br />However, despite the controversy (or maybe because of it) I think everyone should read A Million Little Pieces. It is a naked and raw view of substance abuse and recovery that will make you squirm, but is definitely worth the repetition.
0385737947|5.0|This book should be made into a movie soon.

B000089CJI|5.0|I have had the CD for nearly five years and liked the originality of the disc but I also knew that I would not be interested in repeating the sound of subsequent releases, often a problem for bands with a very unique sound.    Kind of ironic that the UPS commercial uses a song(Such Great Heights) by a band called \\"The Postal Service\\".  I like the CD a lot and recommend it to anybody with adventurous tastes but it is not for everybody.  If you like this CD you might also like LCD Soundsystem's \\"Sound Of Silver\\" another great CD.
B001041JLE|5.0|I am all the way from Australia and received this in 3 weeks!That's what i call excellent service.  Anyway this casebook edition of Thriller is fantastic.Excellent quality, great photos and a keepsake for all time.   What can i say :Thriller the best selling album of all time!  Long live the legacy of Michael Jackson!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|An all around great CD that really highlights Maynard's vocals.  This is a CD you will listen to from beginning to end but it also has three, count them, three of my all-time favorite songs \\"Weak and Powerless\\", \\"The Noose\\" and \\"Blue\\".  Three of the most powerful songs you will ever hear.  One of the greatest three song stretches in album history.    Honestly the whole CD is amazing and I hate highlighting three songs in particular but they are so good I had to.  If you are not inclined to buy the whole CD, but you should, then you definitely have to download \\"Weak and Powerless\\", \\"The Noose\\" and \\"Blue\\".  Highly recommended for any music fan and I mean any.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|My daughter is 6 and was just captivated by this beautiful restoration of the Disney classic. Even my husband sat and watched it with us, remembering when he saw it in the theater, years ago. The packaging is stunning, and the extras are just amazing. This Diamond edition is sure to be a keepsake, something for my daughter to show her children someday. Disney has spared no detail, all the production moments and animation stills are fascinating to see! Bravo Disney!
0061914177|5.0|Gary's book succinctly says what many others in his field are saying: Now is the time to quit the 9-5 and start an online business you are passionate about.  I love that he doesn't sugar coat it and straight up tells you that you're gonna have to work your butt off. BUT, since you are doing something you love you won't even feel like you're working. There are only so many waking hours in a day, how do you want to spend them?
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This movie was like a breath of fresh air. Very memorable story, and a very interesting characters. I wish there was a sequel. This was my first Miyazaki film, and my most favorite of them all. I highly recommend it. I however would recommend reading the book, for it has more detail, which the movie does not cover, leaving many loopholes.
0385504225|5.0|This new Dan Brown book was just wonderful.  I was on the edge of my seat for much of it and was very impressed with the historical background. I learned a lot about the Masons and about Washington, DC.  I have read all the Dan Brown books and his writing just gets better and better.  I can't wait for his next book and would highly recommend all of his books!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. When my friends come over we watch it for not only the amazing picture, and wonders that are depicted, but for humor as well. As an example, our favorite quote is, \\"The female [...]is mysterious\\"  5 stars! Well worth the money and I wasn't expecting to get a laughs out of it! BUY IT
B00007AJGH|5.0|Modern technology may dwarf this film to a certain degree; however this pre-digital era film still stands against those of today.  Especially when you consider the amount of work that went into it.  The bonus features is worth the purchase alone, however Roger Rabbit is a classic in my opinion with strong characters, acting and plot.  I did see it in the theatre and at a young age so my opinion is bias perhaps.  I'm looking forward to seeing my niece's reaction and one day my own children's.
B0002NRQTS|3.0|This so-called \\"re-mastered\\" cd sounds exactly the same as my original cd; the remasters of Rush's earlier material were obvious improvements over their predecessors. I'm really disappointed in this cd. Musically, however, this is a great album from Rush's more mellow 80's period.
B001KPYNR0|5.0|I enjoy this CD for several reasons, one being that it's very relaxing to listen to.  A glass of good wine and a warm fire with this playing in the background makes for a relaxing evening.    I would not think twice about recommending this to my frinds.  I hope you will enjoy this ENYA CD as much as I do.
1569242739|5.0|I would just like to say that this is by far the best cupcake recipe book out there.  I purchased this book in preparation for my daughter's 1st bday and thus far, my cupcakes have turned exceptionally delicious, fluffy, and moist.  Baking these cupcakes makes me want to open a vegan cupcake shop.
B002C1BHIO|5.0|We just purchased our 4th HD TV so all the bedrooms have one now. This HDMI cable is made better than the monster cable I had last purchased. It has a cloth-like covering instead of just plain vinyl/plastic. It came packaged in an easy to open box. I would definitely recommend!
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|Love it. It wasn't anything tremendously new in the story line but it did \\"flesh\\" out the characters.
B002KVSJ64|4.0|Breaking Benjamin have made quite the career for themselves out of producing hard-hitting, well-produced radio-rock, much to the shared joy of their record label and radio stations everywhere. If Nickelback are too corny for your tastes, here's a band who takes their craft a little more seriously and whose music has a little more personality and substance than the average crop of post-grunge radio bands it is unfairly lumped in with.<br /><br />Having said that, though, their fourth effort is hardly re-inventing the wheel. \\"Dear Agony\\" is, at its best, all four members of the band firing on all cylinders, producing the best music they can, the only way they know how. Producer David Bendeth returns to the helm once again to ensure the band sounds as dynamic and dense as possible. Tracks like the opening number, \\"Fade Away\\" and \\"Crawl\\" (a song that calls back to the days of [[ASIN:B00006GF9L Saturate]]) are the finest examples of the band's everlasting collaboration with the producer. Then there's stunning ballads like the title track, which stand out from the crowd and show that the band can tone things down and still deliver an emotional and melodic tune without the aid of one Billy Corgan.<br /><br />Most of \\"Dear Agony\\" delivers what one would expect from a Breaking Benjamin record, but yet, you can't help but want more by the time it winds down. It seems to be that at this point in their career some creative stretching (marginally hinted at in the band's previous effort, [[ASIN:B000G6BL7E Phobia]]) is in order. As it is, though, it's certainly an efficient record that will produce many hits, make its fans happy and pad out the soundtracks of many video-games and sci-fi flicks to come. What's that you say? The album's first single is the theme to the Bruce Willis techno-thriller, [[ASIN:B00275EHCI Surrogates [Theatrical Release]]]?<br /><br />See, I told you so.
0061914177|5.0|[[VIDEOID:38746091]]Hey everybody! Paul from dudecraft.com here. Instead of writing a review, I'm uploading the video review from my blog. Love the book. Extremely useful and inspiring.
0439023483|5.0|WOW! This is a great book .I could not put it down. This is now my new favorite book. I rate this book a 4.5 out of 5 but would have to give it 5 because there are no halves on Amazon. I give it this because it was entertaining, fun to read, and there were surprises in it.<br />  This story is basically about a country named Panem of what was once known as North America. There are twelve districts but use to be thirteen. District 13 had an uprising so for punishment to remind the districts not to do an uprising again, the capitol (head of everything) has a Hunger Games each year. They send one female and one male from each district to compete in the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are a blood thirsty match where all 24 tributes fight to the death, and the last one alive gets a life of ease, and losers die. The only rule is you can't eat the contestants.<br />  The main character Katniss is the main character and lives in a town called the Seam with her sister Prim. At the drawing Prim is chosen to be in the hunger games, but Katniss takes her place instead. Katniss has to take care of her family because her dad died in a mining accident so her mom is depressed and won't do anything. One day Katniss almost died from starvation when Peeta who later gets drawn for the boy to be a contestant in the hunger games, gives his burnt bread to her and gets a beating from his mom after he gave her the bread. Katniss never knew why she felt like she always needed to pay him back.<br />  I would recommend this book to anyone but not to younger kids because there are violent parts like, Poisonous bees, or werewolves. If this would be a movie I doubt it would be possible to get it to be pg 13.<br />  There are some parts I do not like in this book. One reason is this book is written in first person because in the story it would be cooler to go around to the other contestants and see what they're seeing. But I understand why she would want to put it in first person because it would be confusing if it wouldn't be in first person. Also with every desperate part it seemed like every time Katniss was in trouble something positive happened like when she was thirsty she found a lake so she got water. Also Katniss was starving and found food. Another thing I don't like is that Katniss's personality can be annoying at times. The thing I don't like is the romance part is a little cheesy when she doesn't even want romance. The last part I do not like is the ending. I will not tell you the ending because I don't want to give it away. But the ending is not exciting and should be more exciting.<br />  Even though there are negative parts, you should still read it because all books have bad parts! No one's perfect. But there are way more good things then bad things in this book. One thing...get the book! Read it! Get your friends to read it. When you read it give it a chance up to pg. 130 because part 1 might not be exciting as the second and third part. This is a great book!
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I was very excited to receive this DVD, as Snow White is simply a Disney classic that is unparalleled.<br /><br />This two-disc DVD is a Blu-Ray/DVD combo \\"Diamond\\" edition, so in my opinion the value is fantastic. You get a two disc Blu-Ray, and 1-Disc DVD of the full length movie. The quality of the movie sure has improved from the days of VHS, which was the last medium in which I watched this movie. The colors are more rich and vibrant, it is much more clear, the sound is high definition (for the first time ever), and all in all it makes for a fantastic viewing experience. I also love the packaging on this set!<br /><br />I think what I love most about this DVD (as well as most any Disney DVD) is the amount of extras. Included in this set is \\"Snow White Returns\\" which includes storyboards, a piece where you explore the original studio, a bit about how Snow White changed movies forever, and you also get a sneak peak of Disney's new movie \\"The Princess and The Frog.\\" Of course, you also have a number of games, a music video, a karaoke sing-along and lots of other fun things to play around with.<br /><br />I think for anyone who enjoys this movie, or for anyone who collects Disney movies this is a must. The quality of the movie is like none seen before, and the fact that you are getting both DVD and Blu-Ray in one set is a huge plus. Very impressive.
0061914177|5.0|This is a great book to kick people in the pants to live what they love and eventually through hard work, patience and enough passion.....earn money from it. Crush It is well written and has a \\"from the heart\\" feel to it. Gary's story is captivating and his ideas are excellent. Many of my friends have read it and were instantly motivated to go out and Crush It!! I am going to read it a few more times to assimilate everything and totally apply it to my niche and then I will totally Crush it!!! Go Gary! Congratulations on your book! See you in Paramus!!!
B002MW50KO|1.0|Croak the angels herald singing?   This is Mr. Zimmerman's little joke on our consumer nation.
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|Known better for gimmick than talent, it may be surprising to some to actually discover that Katy Perry actually has some of that too.  Her debut album, `One of the Boys', is a pretty solid collection of pop tracks that are destined for radio play and have enough catchy likeability to make them memorable.  From her outrageous antics on the hit (and I mean MAJOR hit) `I Kissed a Girl' to the surprising tenderness of `Thinking of You' (the two best tracks on the album, by far), Perry shows a nice range for the genre she's embraced.<br /><br />If you like this brand of pop/rock entertainment then you will be more than pleased with `One of the Boys'.<br /><br />Looking at her radio singles, these are nice little examples of what Katy has to offer.  The first was `Ur So (not going to even attempt the word that gets my reviews banned for no apparent reason)' and, while it has a funky vibe to it, it grows tired quickly for me.  If I had heard this song on the radio (I never did, surprisingly) I wouldn't have rushed out to buy this album.  `I Kissed A Girl' is a much better song; cheeky but it remains fresh, even after getting played out ridiculously on the radio.  It's fun and spunky and remains one of the most recognizable songs of last year.  `Hot N Cold' is also a great anthem for this young popstar.  The `all too accurate' portrayal of the crazy boyfriend is a fan favorite, and deservedly so.  I used to really like `Waking Up In Vegas', but it has grown tired with all the radio play.  It doesn't hold up over time and just becomes rather boring.<br /><br />Besides, Vegas is not something I personally want to remember.<br /><br />My favorite track from Miss Perry is the stunningly sincere `Thinking of You', a track that nearly brings me to tears with its power.  She sounds quite a bit like Alanis Morissette here (major compliment for this greenhorn).<br /><br />The majority of her album carries the same jovial structure of her most popular single, `I Kissed A Girl'.  The opening title track is fun and gets the album started off in the right direction, and the `throw your fists up and chant' closer `Fingerprints' gets you pumped and ready to start the album completely over.  `If You Can Afford Me' and `Mannequin' are serviceable, if not a tad forgettable.  `Self Inflicted' is nearly brilliant and one of the best on the album.  It's just crazy fun and so catchy!<br /><br />The beautifully controlled `Lost' and the nicely crafted `I'm Still Breathing' serve as reminders that Perry has a voice and can carry a ballad quite nicely.  I prefer `Lost' of the two, but neither have the emotional power of `Thinking of You'.<br /><br />`One of the Boys' is a pretty solid debut effort, one that shows a lot of potential and room for growth, growth that I'm pretty confident Katy Perry can make.  Sadly, she is not really considered a talented singer as much as a media target.  Hopefully enough people will actually give this album the attention it deserves.  Hating on her because she's a crazy party girl reminiscent of Lindsay Lohan doesn't mean she isn't talented.  If you can separate the singer from the celebrity I think you'll see that this album is one to be taken seriously!the album started off in the right direction, and the `throw your fists up and chant' closer `Fingerprints' gets you pumped and ready to start the album completely over.  `If You Can Afford Me' and `Mannequin' are serviceable, if not a tad forgettable.  `Self Inflicted' is nearly brilliant and one of the best on the album.

B001FB4VZS|5.0|The item was in good condition. The only complaint I have is I had a shipping problem. My friend who I sent it to was suppose to get it Sept. 29 the day it was released. I tracked the order and it said delivered. He didn't notice until about 2 days later that the package was on his roof.
B001QOOCTE|4.0|Great energy and some pretty good tunes.  The Indian singer has a haunting voice and brings the idea of world music with a twist to front and center.  Loved it.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|I hope next Gen, sony makes the L2 and R2 button like this. I liked it, but my problem was that I didn't like how it stays on. If you drop it, I hope you  can find it. I drop my controller one day, and the pieces came off, I found one, but the other one was history. I recommend, that you tape them or glue them on.
B002GJU54E|5.0|Another series of belly laughs from Janet Evanovich. \\"Plum Spooky\\", though more weird than spooky, is packed with the humor and outstanding characterization readers have come to love.<br /><br />From the tiniest, Rex, to the what-the-heck-will-she-do-next, Stephanie, Evanovich's characters are always a treat...A++. Elmer the fire farter is a guaranteed riot!
B002C1BHIO|5.0|I was very happy to receive this HDMI cable from the Amazon Basic line. I loved the fact that the box was easy to open, small cardboard box with a little sticker that was sealed. Not only was it easy to open but the box was nice to place other cables in it.<br /><br />I replaced another cheap HDMI cable I bought from Amazon with this cable. I used it on my new Roku. This cable is made very well! It is not only the right length but also is braided with cloth. It is not cheap looking at all. It is much thicker than a standard HDMI cable but to me worth it. It runs cleaner and looks great!<br /><br />As attractive as the cable is I did not see any difference from my other cable I was using. I will keep using the Amazon Basic HDMI cable but it is merely for the look and size. It worked out perfectly for me and I am very happy to be using it. If I had to buy a future HDMI cable I would prefer on that is made well and this cable definitely is.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I started watching this show when it was first aired around September 2007. This is a very very funny show. I bought the first season and could not stop watching it all over again and now I'm just waiting for this second season to arrive. This show should be nominated for an Emmy.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|I was first drawn to this by the visuals, and was quickly captivated by the subtleties of the story. If you aren't one of those people who needs to be spoon-fed explanations, it's a treat that will stick with you. Enjoy the experience of it. Absolutely see this on Blu-ray!
1594488916|4.0|The title of this book alone was enough to draw me in. I'm a compulsive reader and book buyer, though I don't have the mania (or the budget) to acquire first editions and other rarities that drive some bibliomaniacs. This is an interesting journey into the world of rare books and a great detective story rolled into one. The author has found an intriguing hero and a complex villain.<br /><br />The bad guy is John Charles Gilkey, a book thief who plundered the shelves of rare book stores from coast to coast. His reign of thievery is brought to an end by book dealer Ken Sanders, who built a network that collected the pieces of information and stitched them into the mosaic that led to Gilkey's capture.by authorities. Bartlett immersed herself in the rare book word, a realm that was new to her. Though she was a passionate reader, she had never before visited the shops and fairs where the trade does business. Before too long, she is caught up in the romance for first editions, original manuscripts and other ephemera shared by collectors.<br /><br />Bartlett spends time with both of her leading actors, but her primary focus is on Gilkey. She wants to know what drove him to plan and carry out such audacious thefts, some with the assistance of his father In a series of conversations with Gilkey, some of them literally at the scenes of his former crimes, Bartlett learns that Gilkey, like so many of us, is under the spell of books. He appreciates their beauty, their power, their magic. Like so many of us, he wants to own beautiful and important works. Unlike most of his, he has persuaded himself that his entitlement to them is so strong that he has the right to acquire them by any means necessary. He wants the status a fine library will confer upon him; yet he assembles it in a way that means he will never be able to show it off to anyone. That is the ultimate paradox of John Charles Gilkey, an apparently intelligent, but amoral man.--William C. Hall

1416914307|5.0|After reading the first two books I was very impatient about getting the third. I just had to have it. Now that I've read all three I find myself liking this series even more. I loved the resolution to a much anticipated ending. I read this book in one sitting and again I must say I enjoyed every minute of it.

1416955070|4.0|I almost didn't buy this book because of all the negative reviews I read on here. But one day I saw this book at a bargain bin. For $3.00 why not try to read it? I honestly didn't really expect much, but was pleasantly surprised at being quite entertained with the characters and the plot. This book is a great quick read and you will find yourself wanting to get lost in Jace & Clary's world. It will keep you wanting more.
0060763280|4.0|I love the book but after the book if you want o do a little more research they try to  make you feel stupid if you do not take their seminars<br />keep the wisdom of the book only
031606792X|5.0|The fouth book of the Twilight Saga gives you everything you could possibly want and then some. I enjoyed the the last book of the saga because of that and loved every minute of it. I highly recommend to read the entire saga. You will fall in love with it from start to finish. And it's a good thing I got into this after all the books were already published. I don't think I could have waited to read them as they came out one at a time.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Excellent movie. I had not seen the movie in years and really enjoyed it. It was nice to be able to enjoy it with my daughter. Excellent color. Would highly recommend this movie to anyone!!
1428144552|5.0|I have had this product for about a month now. I listen to it daily as backround and turn it on when I go to sleep. I was ready to accept drastic change, and am I changing. I am transforming. I have never possessed less, and loved life more. My story runs deep and I will share it one day. I have a mountain in my life, and I enjoy the climb, everyday.
B002GZQY6Q|4.0|Like most other reviewers I've been a PT fan forever.  And, like many PT fans I notice that whenever I get a new album of theirs I usually HATE it after the first listen.  I've found that I have to listen to an album at least 5 times before I can really understand what I like and don't like about it.    \\"The Incident\\" is no different.  My initial reaction to the CD was less than favorable.  But since then I've listened to it many more times and I can tell you that this album is just as good as any PT album out there!    I dislike the way that the tracks were broken-out on the CD.  This album is NOT shuffle-friendly.  While the CD was \\"designed\\" to be a 50-min song, you'll find that there are in fact distinct songs on the disc, consisting of a certain number of tracks each.  For example, I love listening to tracks 10-14 in order.  In my mind that feels like a single song that follows the recipe of traditional Prog anthems.  I'm considering re-tracking the album myself for my iPod, so that when I shuffle I get the whole song.    Overall, if you're a fan of PT you owe it to yourself to give this album the time it needs to grow on you.  I'm betting you'll like it!
B001FB4VXU|4.0|Yes the words intelligent & funny usually go together like an elephant & a pair of Y fronts but in the case of The Big Bang Theory, the humor is based on science & psychology rather than fart jokes & prat falls.  Series 2 is a great companion to series 1 but still no commentary track!  They'd better have one for series 3 that's all I can say!  This show mixes sci-fi with psy-fi brilliantly!
B002HML6Y8|5.0|Great movie and the product I recieved from Amazon was in excellent new condition.  No problems enjoying my movie.
0307454541|4.0|This was the first mystery I've read in years and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The creepy characters were ultra-creepy and the interactions between characters very authentic.  It had me guessing to the very end.<br /><br />Larson left a couple of loose threads which annoyed me. Some things were too neatly wrapped up and others weren't explained sufficiently by the end of the story.  The first third of the book was weighted down with a lot of back story and detail that could have easily been pared down.  I wish we were left with a better understanding of how the girl --before the dragon tattoo -- got to be so damaged, so socially inept, so guarded.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this book to readers who are willing to devote hours at a time because you won't want to set it down.<br /><br />Marie Estorge<br />author of CONFESSIONS OF A BI-POLAR MARDI GRAS QUEEN and STORKBITES: A MEMOIR
B001AK3S4Y|5.0|This is a good science fiction/comic book movie. Even though the characters have \\"powers\\" its not like X-Men, it definitely carries its own plot. Guillermo del Toro has a great vision for this movie that makes people enjoy it even it they didn't read the comic books. His movies just keep getting better and better.
0596101996|5.0|Because I purchased this book as a gift I cannot review it personally. However the person who received it was very happy with the book.
B002KAJ0AO|3.0|The first thing I said when I started listening to this album was, \\"This isn't them!\\" Of course, I was being dramatic then, but I still hold that opinion to a certain degree now. I have been a loyal fan of these guys for over a decade and the thing I've always loved about them was their ability to sing and the harmony they had together. They can still sing, and they still have great harmony - the problem is, you can't quite tell from this album. It's what has always set them apart for me. Their songs, as sappy as they may have been, worked for them. I'm not saying they can't step away from ballads, but they have to move forward with it. It seems to me, they didn't move anywhere on this one. Some of the songs sound generic, like everything else that's on radio right now. And I've quit listening to radio for that same reason!     If I Knew Then - enjoyable but sounds like a song I'd give to Jesse McCartney.    This is Us - The guitar in the beginning immediately threw me back to White Lion's \\"When The Children Cry\\" and so when the beat came on I was stunned. With that opening, I was expecting something else. It still lulls me and then boom.    PDA - I laugh when I hear the chorus with Nick singing about booty. I don't think that's what they intended lol. ETA: The more I listen to this, the more I don't like it. It's not growing on me.      Two songs which I easily picked as my two favourites, are Masquerade and Shattered.    Masquerade is upbeat and catchy from the get go and holds up till the end. The chorus comes in smoothly and it's just a really well put together song.     Shattered has more of what I wished the other songs had - emotion. When the chorus comes on, you really feel it.     Another one I really like is Undone - it sort of builds and just gently sweeps you away.     All in all, I gave it a 3/5 because despite my expectations, it's still a solid album and it does have a few gems on it. I think younger/newer fans will groove to it, but the fans who havebeen fans since the first and second albums, will know that they're capable of better, because we've experienced it.    KTBSPA!

Since Amazon offered it so quickly and at such a great discount they were indeed impressed when I presented it to them before they even realized it was available.  Now, I'm hoping they'll let me read it when they're done with it.  I love the convenience of buying things on Amazon.
0385504225|3.0|Easy reading like the others.  Not exciting like A&D  or VC.  You will have so many confusion..I'm telling you...like how she get cell phone signal in POD 5....and receiveng text & calls.  How you can get out of POD 5..which is most secured area by some vent and chase a car...not even finished...you go back in there again..and burn the whole thing...its really really funny.      Anyway..feels like written in hurry...to make some money...
1595141715|1.0|DISCLAIMER: I don't mean to offend anyone:)  I feel that this book has, in essence, an excellent concept, but in actuality, did not exactly turn out this way. Not to say the book wasn't well written, but it was a tad bit irritating. I'm not sure what the point of this book was, but I read it in a reading group, and we all just got very angry at the dead girl. I mean, what kind of SICKO blames their SUICIDE on other people?! It's a SUICIDE! that means SELF-inflicted death!I'm a teenager; all teenagers go through problems. EVERY SINGLE ONE. And we're all like \\"Oh, this is so serious; these problems matter\\", even though 20 years from now, we'll laugh at these things. But now, all these people that she's blaming for her death are REALLY gonna be messed up. And thus the cycle of depression will continue.     Conclusion: This book is mediocre-sad, because the girl who committed suicide is a very rude, sarcastic, screwed up person that could't handle normal teenage life. There's no moral value whatsoever.     Thanks for reading:)

B002ELM5HY|3.0|better than the last one , from a year or so ago,although that had two songs on it that are better than anything on this one, but as an album this is better as a whole, a bit mellow at times, and I'd say more introspective of him but a good effort and worth it if youre a Knopfler fan, good recording quality too.

1400063736|4.0|McCann is Irish, but he writes about New York with such a critical knowledge and understanding of the city's many layers and cross sections of the populace that is truly amazing.<br /><br />By interweaving the story of The Man of The Wire throughout the novel (somewhat Olive Kitteridge-ish style), he brings us to meet real people, each with their own demons, visions, mysteries, pains and pleasures. It's a multi-layered microcosm of New York City in the 1970's.... a series of short stories told from different viewpoints that are all interconnected the way people are interconnected.<br /><br />The 'man on the wire' is central to the story, but his walk isn't the only force driving the novel. The book focuses on people and how they come together across lines that otherwise divide them.<br />A spinning together and how lives touch other lives in sometimes random ways.<br /><br />Exploring how differently we all cope with the wires we walk, the spinning we encounter. Where we came from...where we are going...how to find the humor in even the most desperate situations.<br /><br />This is what comes alive and resonates deeply in LET THE GREAT WORLD SPIN.... a wonderfully crafted novel!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The set came on time and was as described. This is a great series. Awesome footage and very informative about a side of life most of us don't get to experience.
6302256615|5.0|this movie is best.  Kathryn Bigelow is the best director ever.  Dont believe me?  take a look at k19: the widowmaker.  for serious.  that movie is like point break, but under the water.
B000V6Q9NU|5.0|OMG!!!  This soundtrack is a masterpiece.  I felt like I had attended a symphony concert after hearing the music.  All instruments of the orchestra were utilized.  The first three compositions flowed from one piece to the next.  The sound was so moving, it brought tears to my eyes.  Gladiator the movie is one of my all time favorites.  Now that I have listened to the soundtrack it likewise moves to my list of top music selections.
B0025KVLVA|2.0|Like other reviewers here who have given the \\"Past Masters\\" 2009 Remastered album 1 or 2 star reviews, I wholeheartedly agree that this release is something you can safely skip and spend your $12-$18 elsewhere. It pains me to give a Beatles release 2 stars, but understand that the low opinion is based solely on the quality of the remastering, which is not quantitatively different from the mastering on the original 1988 release of these discs.     Note that my opinion expressed here is exclusive to the remastering of the \\"Past Masters\\" disc(s). The other releases in the collection that I've heard so far (White Album and Revolver) have been significantly improved in terms of sonic quality when compared to the initial 1987 releases.    The majority of the cuts from both Remastered Discs 1 and 2 are virtually indistinguishable from the 1988 release. For a point of reference, I'm listening to the 16-bit AIFF audio files on high-end studio reference equipment (Mac->Apogee Rosetta D/A->Dynaudio Acoustics BM15A Monitors) in my comparison tests. After informal A/B testing, only a few tracks show any appreciable difference in sound quality, and one track - to my ears anyway - actually sounds worse! Quite simply, it is as if the mastering engineers made subtle tweaks to the EQ, but otherwise left the tracks alone (Maybe some subtle limiting, but no compression or volume optimization). I'm left to conclude that either: a.) The engineers doing the remastering were too timid to (or pressured not to) mess with the original masters, or; b.) The 1988 mastering on the original release was already EQ'd and volume optimized to the point where there was little to do to improve things. I certainly hope the latter is the case, but if that's so, then why bother with a remastering at all?    In short, when the \\"remastered\\" badge is used to sell a product, it should sound significantly better to warrant repurchasing music you already have. On this count, this 2009 Remastered release of \\"PastMasters\\" falls flat, and I for one feel ripped off. In case you're wondering, no - I wasn't expecting the music to jump out of the speakers. Just subjectively better in terms of extended harmonic definition, high end clarity or low end power. Unfortunately, none of that is to be found here.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|This show brings to television all the creepies and crawlies and man-eating beasties that we all love and deny we fear. It also tosses in some great laughs. What's not to love?<br /><br />The series starts by introducing a little back story for the Winchester brothers, Dean and Sam, respectively. Then it takes you to present day Sam, the baby of the family, now in college. Then in walks Dean, the classic overprotective, jerk big brother. The first season of the show is about the brothers setting out to find their Dad who has disappeared on a \\"hunting\\" trip and the creepy things they encounter on their search.<br /><br />The dynamic between the two brothers is hilarious and can at times only be called a Bromance. With Dean plaguing \\"Sammy\\" constantly then turning around and risking his life for him. This creates an almost sentimental backdrop for a show that oozes horror and/or gore at every turn.<br /><br />If you like horror, action, suspense, comedy, Bromances, or anything else for that matter, you'll want to check out this show. It's a show that everyone (except maybe the younger kids) can watch.<br /><br />Guys, girls, parents, grandparents, anyone can watch this show and love it!
0312588887|5.0|I read this book 28 years ago while I was on maternity leave. I was pregnant with my first (only) child and going through a divorce.  WHAT A READ!!!  The story line is engrossing and the female characters are well rounded, STRONG, determined women.  In fact, I gave my new born daughter Aunt Edwina's name in the hopes that she would grow up to be just as well-rounded, strong and determined.  (She is!) I am now a grandmother. When my daughter was pregnant 8 years ago, I re-read it and it still had the same impact on me.  I felt just as swept away by the story, the romance and the adventure, just as I had 20 years earlier.  I love this book, it's characters and it's story -- just as I did then.
068484267X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book!!  It had been on my \\"to-read\\" list for awhile; and the passing of Frank McCourt earlier this year reminded me that I wanted to read it.  I am very glad that I did!  Yes, the book was a tad repetetive (drunk dad drinks away family's money, leaves, repeat); but I was still engagaged the entire read.  Yes, the writing was nothing spectacular; but that helped to create the feeling that you were witnessing the story through the eyes of a child.  Many reviewers called the book depressing.  While McCourt no doubt had a difficult childhood, I did not find the book depressing at all.  McCourt frequently injects humor into the story; and there were multiple instances when the goodness of humanity shined through amidst the poverty and despair.    As a teacher, I think that this book could be used in a high school literature class (or even history class...I learned a lot about Irish and Irish-Catholic history from reading this book).  The language is accessible to younger readers, but the themes become more mature as McCourt passes through adolescence.  It would also be an interesting book club pick.  Many interesting discussions could be had about coming of age, poverty, politics, family, and resilience.    I wavered between four and five stars.  I ultimately chose four, as the writing itself was not five star quality, and I wished some of the characters had been more fully developed.  A recommended book nonetheless!
143911000X|5.0|The Bro Code is a journey into the insight and genius of Barney Stinson.  It is a collection of everything that is known and never said.  The book is an adventure into the mind of every man who adhere to a code of ethics that unites us all as Bros.  This book should be given to all teens who are having a tough time finding themselves and should be a general education requirement in college.  Just like Woman Studies there should be Bro Studies.
B002SVBDYQ|2.0|I like a few of the songs, but not completely in love with it as I was with Twilight's soundtrack even the main movie's theme  song \\"meet me on the equinox\\" doesn't capture the essence of this movie. I was hoping for something more heartfelt although still indie. I'm just not feeling it, the music is not conveying the heart-wrenching breakup  that Bella goes through. As others have mention is feels too monotone.  Who knows once the movie comes it might grow on me or at least that's what I'm hoping for. All in all not a bad purchase for $4.99.  I give it 2 1/2 stars with the potential for more once the movie comes out.
0439023491|5.0|Awesome book.  I was expecting to be slightly disappointed because I loved Hunger Games.  I was not disappointed - it delivers everything I hoped for.  If you liked the first, I think you'll love this one.  Can't wait for the next.
0790731894|4.0|This is one of those action thrillers that goes perfect with popcorn or chips or whatever. It's really intense. As a growing fan of political thrillers, this gets even better after repeated viewings. With action, drama, humor, and of course, thrills, this should be watched by those who are into these sorts of movies. And for those who want to see Steven Segal killed off in the film, then this is your first, and probably only, chance.
B002MW50KY|4.0|At first I was going to give this product a 3 star rating (right up the middle; half great, half terrible). The reason being, these are wonderfully orchestrated musical productions done in an old school style as (many have referred to in other reviews) reminiscent of traditional fifties style Christmas albums. The bad, Bob's voice is so raspy that at times the vocals seem out of place with the music.     Upon first listen it was hard for me to imagine ever wanting to play these songs as part of my seasonal Christmas rotation of music. Bob's vocals just seemed too harsh and raspy for this kind of music.    After listening to the CD a few more times it is now hard for me to imagine not playing them as part of my seasonal rotation.    The reasons for my change of \\"heart\\"? For one, it is the \\"heart\\" felt way Bob delivers these songs. There is sincerity in every note. Almost like Bob knows his voice is hardly up to the challenge of covering Christmas carols in a very traditional fashion, but he wants to do it anyway because he cares about the themes. The other reason is, after hearing them a few times, I really started to like the harsh and raspy vocal. The joy that seems to emanate from Bob overcomes the lack of ability to deliver the vocals in the soft and melodic fashion I have become accustomed too on this type of music. Finally, when my three year old daughter fell asleep singing \\"Must be Santa, must be Santa, must be Santa, Santa Claus\\", I knew Bob did alright.    As far as the deluxe packaging goes. I was a little disappointed that the Christmas cards were basically the CD cover combined with a stamp on the back referring to Feeding America. Would it have been too difficult to type \\"Seasons Greetings\\" or something inside the cards? These cards can easily be reproduced with a scanner, or you can make your own by just copying an image of the CD art from the Internet, adding a blank section next to it, cutting, and folding; they are the same shape and almost the samesize as the CD cover art. Having said that, the additional cost of ~$7 for the five cards with envelopes (less than $1.50 per card) is very cheap by card standards.     Finally, it is important to keep in mind this whole project is for the sole benefit of a very important charity.    All-in-all, Bob got me and my family in the Christmas spirit and it is only October! I don't know whether to thank him or curse him.    Thanks Bob!
B00005JKG9|5.0|Guns. Explosions. Car chases. Sex. Damsels in distress. Child sidekicks. MTV-like madness. These are the things that Glengarry Glen Ross DOESN'T have. So what makes it so great? Because it's a character-driven story that relies strictly on dialogue and personalities. There is no need for gunfights and car chases; the characters and the dialogue in this movie are what makes it so captivating. These characters are raunchy and obscene; it's hard to either love them or despise them.<br /><br />Based on the Tony Award-winning play by David Mamet, it is a story about desperation, distrust, greed, and real estate. There are six main characters, and they easily make the film for their hard-hitting attitudes. Pacino, Lemmon, Harris, Arkin, Spacey, and Baldwin . . . I don't know how to perfectly describe them. They are brilliant. The way they interact with each other, how they detest each other, how they trust and distrust each other; complexity lies in their chemistry. The plot may be simple, but it's the characters that makes Glengarry Glen Ross really special. It's a movie that must be remembered for every new generation.<br /><br />Word of caution: if you can't stand heavy profanity, then you probably won't feel very comfortable while watching this. The F and S words are constantly used throughout, so you have been warned.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I had never seen this show on TV before I got the season on DVD so I wasn't really sure what to expect. It turned out to be one of the most original and well put together shows I have ever seen. Normally when I watch movies I play on the computer and whatnot but this show captivated me to the point that I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. The writing is excellent, the characters are well developed even in the first season, and the plot takes so many hilarious, morbid and terribly bizarre (yet believable) turns that you can't help but be completely absorbed.
1573300403|5.0|I received this DVD today and i feel it is one of the best i have purchased to date. The clarity is amazing on every video. For me  the Smooth Criminal and 1995 MTV VMA show is worth the price of the DVD. Fantastic ,absolutely genius in the performances. I couldn't be happier with this. I own a lot of MJ's DVD's and CD's and this is by far my favorite. May his creative and sensitive soul rest in peace as the world forever misses him.
0385504225|1.0|This book was a waste of time. Although the beginning is interesting, the book seems to fall apart in the middle and comes to a weak ending. Angels & Demons was a fascinating book and the Da Vinci code was an OK read. Dan Brown seems to be slipping!
B0000DIXDR|5.0|Worth the extra couple of bucks for all the special features, and the fact that the other version isn't in wide screen like this one is.
B002MW50KO|5.0|This is a truly special and \\"real\\" christmas record. It is helpful if you like his voice.... heart felt and heart warming. perfect christmas present. royalties to feeding people here in the US and classic songs.   Thank you Mr. Dylan. check out The Christmas Blues!
0882709194|2.0|This edition of Darwin's On the Origin of the Species is being used to stealthily spread creationism and an anti-evolution message.    I bought this book as a gift for my son who is turning 14, a gift that is meant to help him think about the world around him, the world based on facts and science, not on superstition and biblical passages.    Don't waste your time with this book. You want to read about DNA and personal insights, get a book like Francis Collins' The Language of God that doesn't have to surreptitiously spread the material while masquerading as a classic of science.
B002436WFI|4.0|Actually, considering it was made for TV, this adaptation is very well done.  I'm a long-time Terry Pratchett fan, but I think this movie (well, pair of movies) should also be quite accessible to people who have never read Pratchett's work.<br /><br />The only trouble is that there is a LOT of material to cover (Pratchett novels are never thin!) So, to the eye that is not familiar with Discworld, I fear that these adaptations may seem to ramble a bit.  But, in any case, the rambling is always fun.  The apparent rambling is due to the fact that the storyline sticks very closely to the books, something I appreciate as a fan, and only hope that newcomers to Discworld don't feel lost or overwhelmed by the enormous scope that has been crammed into a short, movie-length time span.<br /><br />Speaking of newcomers, I was delighted by Astin's portrayal of Twoflower, even though I had actually pictured Twoflower as more of a skinny, geeky type when I read the books.  Astin really carried off the sense of innocent wonder and plain fool's luck that kept Twoflower alive throughout all his adventures, and everything he did, even the simplest little line or gesture, just made me smile.<br /><br />Rincewind was also very convincing, and Cohen the Barbarian was completely delightful.  I can't look at shoop the same way anymore!<br /><br />I wasn't too keen on the way the Luggage was rendered, though.  I think its legs really should have looked more like those of a millipede.  The humanesque legs were distracting and unbelievable.  I guess I had pictured the legs as being more like those of a millipede.  Your mileage may vary!<br /><br />Altogether a fun romp with a generous handful of thought-provoking zingers thrown in; almost as good as a Terry Pratchett novel, and that's saying a lot.
0451134699|3.0|Over all, the book is in good shape, binding and actual cover.  I was a little disappointed that the paper cover has some large tears in it.  The book had been listed in \\"used, very good\\" condition.  It doesn't rate quite that.  But it finishes my collection of the Space Odyessey series and had a copyright date from around when the movie was released.
B0029O08WA|5.0|The best thing you can say about any movie's soundtrack is that it can stand on its own, and that no matter what you think of the movie, the soundtrack is chock full of amazing music.<br /><br />And the soundtrack to \\"New Moon\\" is one of those -- apparently the people behind it have gone completely indie in their tastes. Whether you love or hate the teen-vampire-infatuation flick, it's undeniable that the soundtrack is bursting with brilliant bands -- angular rock'n'roll and lush echoing pop, some of it well-known (Muse, Thom Yorke) and some relative obscure (Grizzly Bear, Lykke Li).<br /><br />\\"Meet me on the equinox/Meet me halfway/The sun is perched at its highest peak/In the middle of the day... \\" Ben Gibbard sings distantly as the gentle guitars swirl around him. A storm of drums builds up every time he laments that \\"everything, everything ends,\\" as his pronouncements about an unknown lover become eerier and more surreal (\\"A window/An open tomb/The sun crawls across your bedroom/A halo/A waning moon/Your last breath moving through you\\").<br /><br />There's a pretty good showing of solid rock'n'roll following Death Cab For Cutie's memorable introduction -- Band of Skulls provides the buzzing, blunt-edged rocker \\"Friends,\\" Hurricane Bells erupts in a buzzing storm of fuzzy bass and sharp beats with \\"Monsters,\\" and Sea Wolf's \\"The Violet Hour\\" is a swirling little pop-rocker that seems to trickle down the reverberating guitar.<br /><br />Then there's Thom Yorke, whose buzzy-edged electronic \\"Hearing Damage\\" is a furtive, dark little rush of sinister beauty. And of course, Muse is included in the stomping, mournful rocker \\"I Belong To You (New Moon Remix).\\"<br /><br />Some of these bands are also going unexpectedly low-key to suit the mood, even if they're usually much louder. The Killers turn out the dramatic layered lament of \\"A White Demon Love Song,\\" while Black Rebel Motorcycle unfurl a twangy lo-fi ballad \\"Done All Wrong.\\" OK GO abandon their usual sound in favor of the trippy psychedelic-edged \\"Shooting The Moon,\\" and the Editors dip into a dramatic, hauntingly sad piano-rock sound with \\"No Sound But The Wind\\" (\\"Help me to carry the fire/it will light our way forever...\\"<br /><br />But some brilliant indie pop also makes the cut. Lykke Li's \\"Possibility\\" is a shimmering, icy little melody, while Anya Marina sticks to acoustic guitar riddled with organ in the whispery \\"Satellite Heart.\\" The absolute highlights of the album: Bon Iver and St. Vincent collaborate on the otherworldly, hymnlike \\"Roslyn,\\" and Grizzly Bear's exquisite \\"Slow Life\\" is a slow haunting build to a celestial climax.<br /><br />For the record, I'm not a fan of \\"New Moon\\" or Stephenie Meyers' Twilight series in general. But I felt a prickle go down my spine when I saw the songs listed for the soundtrack -- they've crammed it with one brilliant band after another, ranging from hard rock'n'roll to soft, sweet ballads. In fact, the only one that failed to move me was Alexandre Desplat's outro -- frankly, it was four minutes of boredom for me.<br /><br />Otherwise, the playlist sets a wonderful mood -- think a mingling of bittersweet romanticism and outright melancholy, with lots of slowly winding piano, buzzing guitar, acoustics and ghostly veils of electronica and organ. The singers' voices range from dramatic laments (Matt Bellamy) to quirky murmurs (Anya Marina), and their lyrics tend to reflect two themes: loss (\\"How much pain has cracked your soul?/How much love would make you whole?\\") and love (\\"Even though you're only one I see/I've got to set you free...\\").<br /><br />Even those who are not (and probably never will be) fans of the Twilight phenomenon should immerse themselves in the \\"New Moon Soundtrack.\\" Taken on its own merits, it's still a haunting string of beautiful songs.Shooting The Moon,\\" and the Editors dip into a dramatic, hauntingly sad piano-rock sound with \\"No Sound But The Wind\\" (\\"Help me to carry the fire/it will light our way forever...\\"    But some brilliant indie pop also makes the cut.

B00005JM1F|5.0|This and Animal House are truly the two best movies about college fraternaties of all time. I may even have to say this is slightly better because it gets at something that adult way post college middle aging men all sort of feel deep down : \\"Wouldn't it be cool to just toss all responsibilities and go back to college?\\" and then proceeds with the logical and probable consequences of three men who actually try doing that in the most comedic fashion possible, I was busting in half laughing through the movie.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|These just clip right on and work amazingly well. Games that were tough  before because my finger would slip off the L2 or R2 buttons now  work like a charm. These are very trick and honestly should be a part  of the controller from the factory.  Buy these and you won't regret it.  My wife has small fingers and these help her immensely.  Too bad I can't get these for my PS2 controller.
B002C6A6F4|5.0|This is such a cute movie, inspiring for any age. I completely recommend it! Must see
B002SVBDYQ|3.0|It is truly nice to see indie artists get the spotlight on this album but it does feel like Alexandra Patsavas eschewed most mainstream artists simply because they were mainstream.     After hearing the teases on Amazon.uk I was expecting to love this soundtrack more than I did, but it does have some great tracks. Standouts include OK Go's trippy \\"Shooting the Moon\\", Anya Marina's quiet gem \\"Satellite Heart\\", Grizzly Bear's emotionally gut-wrenching \\"Slow Life\\" and the lush and ethereal Bon Iver & St. Vincent collab \\"Roslyn\\". I suspect I'll enjoy the soundtrack more once the movie comes out and it becomes more apparent where the songs fit into the storyline. I question the wisdom of putting the soundtrack out so far ahead of the movie but I realize that the appetite for \\"Twilight\\" is ravenous.     Overall, good but not great with four or five songs destined to be among my top played. 3 1/2 out of 5.

B002G1X350|3.0|A good album no doubt but not what leaves eyes used to be.  My fav album was lovelorn and vinland was epic beyond measurement, but this new album doesnt feel like leaves eyes.  It sounds more pop, something like delain or sirenia.  The vocals are still amazing, the title track my destiny is spot light of this album and feels the closest to the leaves eyes i know.   My personal favorite track is scarboroough fair, the acoustics and vocals are very well done.  This album wont disappoint, but im sure anyone looking for more of the \\"epic\\" and viking style music from leaves eyes will not find much here.

0307716988|5.0|Being a long time fan of Michael's, I had bought this book and read it years ago when it first came out. Unfortunately, during a move a few years ago, I had given it away to a used book store. After his death, I felt terrible that I hadn't kept the book, I realized too late how precious it was and that I was foolish to get rid of it, but now I am thrilled to see that it is is out again for all of us to enjoy once more. I will be buying the new updated version and this time I will be keeping it and I will be re-reading it again as well. It was a wonderful book and a must have for any fan.
0307120007|5.0|I began reading this book to my baby at four months. She absolutely adores it and turns all the pages. She was able to pat the bunny right away and over time do all of the activities- except waving which we are working on now at almost eight months. Her favorite is the peek-a-boo activity. If she is across the room and I get out this book, she comes crawling over as fast as she can to read it along with me. By far, this is her favorite thing that we've given her!
6301174240|5.0|I LOVED this video. I bought it when it first came out years ago and loved it from the start. It's amazing. Fans that have never seen it will be in for a treat when it comes out on DVD. It is another must have for every Michael Jackson fan out there!
630587493X|5.0|I love this film so I'am not objective. This film has science fiction; it is a love story; it has comedy; it touches the reality of racism; it shows our preocupation of relationships that are not accepted by the mayority of the society; it shows how the need to excell, drives the soul when love is powering it and beautifuly it shows how someone who can live for a long time, choses to die because being alone, without the loved one, is intolerable. The end is sad because death is part of living, but as some know, it is not how a person dies but how he or she lives, what gives meaning, purpose and an example.
B0026J8LHM|2.0|been following DT since the beginning. now im totally disappointed, the intros are long and boring, the lyrics are the worst ever, some songs sounds old, they are only 2 good songs here, the others are boring, don't like portnoy's voice, labrie has no space to sing.    the #1 is good  the #2 sounds old and boring.  the #3 is boring as hell  #4 sounds like Bryan Adams with happy chorus and stuff, really childish.  #6 is excellent, good prog touchs, reminds me the good DT times.
0385504225|5.0|Once I started the book, couldn't stop reading. I read it in 2 days. Dan Brown has held my attention with all his novels. When I read, I am in the story with the characters, hearing what they say, feling what they feel. And Dan Brown has done this with his novels. I look forward  to more by him.
0545123267|3.0|Someone needs to give Stephenie Meyer (Twilight Series) some credit here for coming up with an idea that seems to have taken everyone by storm.  Suddenly there are numerous \\"copy cats\\" of her werewolves, yellow-eyed characters, vampires and the like. This book includes the werewolf and the yellow eyes. (What, no room for vampires?)    This book sounds like it was written by someone who was on \\"Team Jacob\\" if you know what I mean.  Plot: Girl falls in love with \\"old friend\\" who just happens to be a werewolf half the time.    Too many loose ends, too much like other books I've read before to keep much of my interest in it.    I considered letting my 10-year-old daughter read it first, but decided she is too young for this material just yet.
0345479092|5.0|I ordered this book in a panic when as a first time mom my 4 week old would not go down for a nap unless he fell asleep in my arms. And then I couldn't put him down out of fear that he would wake up. I wanted desperately to put him down in his crib so I could take a shower, eat a meal, get a nap myself!!! This book showed me a great method for helping a baby to sleep without creating a \\"sleep attachment\\" such as breastfeeding or rocking that I would have to repeat every time my son needed a nap or to fall back asleep. Her Shush-Pat method worked miracles and helped the tears stop. By the time my son was 6 weeks old I could lay him down for a nap with little work on my part and not worry whether he would fall asleep or stay asleep. This also meant he only woke at night when he needed to eat. If he woke up for any other reason he might make some noises, but he fell back to sleep. The dream feed advice also helped me to get more sleep than I would have otherwise.  Several reviewers state that Hogg is Anti- Demand Feeding. I would disagree with this statement. She does say to feed your baby whenever they are hungry. But, she also says not to put food in your baby's mouth every time they cry. Don't feed when in reality they are tired or overstimulated. The answer is not always feeding.   Today I am the well-rested mother of a happy, healthy 4 month old who dependibly takes 2 hour naps twice a day and sleeps 12 hours at night.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|This is actually now my favorite movie of all time, I enjoy the theme of changing one's life and the actions that occur as a result. Will Ferrel is usually not who i'd expect to be rooting for, but I was - an impressive movie and a total sleeper hit.
0312330537|5.0|A true masterpiece. This book was given to me by a friend.  Halfway through reading it I ordered it for 3 of my friends, and recommended it to anyone who would listen to me!!  It is a beautiful book.  It reads like a biography and it seems that most of it certainly must be true because it was written with such amazing depth and emotion that could only come from experience.  I have never visited India but through reading this book I can sense what a beautiful country India is, and what an amazing spiritual adventure he was on because of what only India can offer to your soul.  The book is long, yes....but absolutely worth it because it is written so well.  When I finished it, I wanted it to go on and on.  I hope he writes a sequel.  I would buy it in an instant!

B002CAWNEM|1.0|Let me cut to the chase here, this movie is a drag in every sense. If you watched Fatal Attraction and liked it then skip this one without further thinking. Besides being a lousy copy of the 80s classic this movie is SO CHEESY so so so bad that will let you wondering how some of these directors (and screenwriters) even get funds to produce such disasters.<br /><br />The director is clearly a guy that knows his craft shooting commercials, everything is peach perfect, all the illumination and the acting resembles the happy family from the tooth paste commercial, it is so CLICHE it hurts!<br /><br />The plot is so bad, you can see what's coming next from a mile away, I figured out the ending 20 minutes before it happened! Every scene sequence has been copied from somewhere else because it all seems too familiar to be original.<br /><br />The music is so tacky, even when disaster looms or somebody dies you have the freaking R&B sung by Mrs Knowles, I mean the soundtrack must be the entire purpose of this film. As an actress Knowles shows she's a great singer.<br /><br />I could go on forever on this one, just stick to the beginning of my review,  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE. Oh well....perhaps you wanna laugh some then go for it.
B002Q0F6V0|5.0|I resisted. I did not want to buy Black Gives Way to Blue by 3 of the former guys from Alice in Chains plus some \\"replacement\\". And once I finally did buy it I had a preconceived notion to not like it.<br /><br />I mean, how could Jerry Cantrell, Mike Inez and Sean Kinney possibly find someone that could fill the shoes of Layne Staley? And if they did find someone, how could I possibly get my brain around the idea?<br /><br />Well, all it took was one listen-through of the disk. Black Gives Way to Blue is one of the best Hard Rock recordings I've listened to in 20 years. Alice in Chains [[ASIN:B0000028M7 Dirt]] stands atop of my Amazon Listmania List of The Best Hard Rock CDs (With Clear Lyrics, Post 1990). And to make it onto my List a band has had to do something really special. I've got to give Black Gives Way to Blue a few more listens, but I sure am leaning towards putting this disk on my List.<br /><br />Calling William DuVall a replacement was an insult. After watching him perform a few songs today (courtesy of YouTube) I can see that he is truly a new member of a great band. I can see why Cantrell and the other guys didn't rename the band as a new project with a different singer. DuVall brings a different energy than Staley did, but he really keeps the integrity of the band solidly intact. That's a hard thing to accomplish...just look at Drowning Pool and countless other bands whose singers have either passed or left...it usually just does not work.<br /><br />William DuVall does indeed work. He doesn't have the cool charismatic darkness surrounding him like Staley did; he brings more of a positive light to AiC. But rest assured, when he sings the AiC classics (again, thanks YouTube), he makes you \\"believe\\". As for the sound-alike aspect...yeah, he does sound like Staley. Is he an imitation? No. Jerry Cantrell sounds like Staley...is he an imitation? Uh..no. Layne would be proud of this group and as he looks down must be honored by the songs that tributize him.<br /><br />To anyone who likes Hard Rock and especially to anyone who likes Alice in Chains, Black Gives Way to Blue is no Dirt, but it is an outstanding Hard Rock recording. Add it to your cart.d Rock and especially to anyone who likes Alice in Chains, Black Gives Way to Blue is no Dirt, but it is an outstanding Hard Rock recording. Add it to your cart.
B000ZECQ08|4.0|As with everything Harry Potter related, I was uber excited to see this film. I was terribly dissapointed with the 5th movie, since it strayed so much from the book. I had high hopes for Half-Blood Prince but I was also a bit nervous. After watching it, I must say as a whole, I was still a bit dissapointed. I know, I really do, that you can't fit everything from a book into a movie. However, what I don't understand is if you have a plot pretty much handed to you on a silver platter, why must you toy with it and destroy it and change it and for what purpose? Yes, 70% of the film was all about romance and heartbreak. Fine, it was very well done and I can deal with that. But when it starts to interfere with the plot, well, then I have issues with that.    This was deemed a 'darker' Potter film and yet, besides the end, I saw nothing of it. The romance aspect really brought things out of balance. And making the film PG did not help matters. Changing characters' personalities did not help matters. And changing the ending certainly didn't score points. Maybe I am being picky but for once I would like to see a Harry Potter film true to the book in tone and plot, like the 3rd film. There is no need to include every minute detail, but please don't CHANGE what is already there. Why mess with perfection? The book was dramatic and it's ending surprising, dark and depressing. The movie's ending was just rushed and seemed to come completely out of nowhere. People that have not read the book would even be confused. Seriously, for those that have not read the book, did you even get the whole 'Half-Blood Prince' thing? Yes, you know who the Prince is, but do you know WHAT it is? There was just no explanation. It was just too rushed. The director and screenplay writer needed to spend less time on romantic scenes, and more on important plot points.     As for the cast, well, it certainly has improved. The 3 principals do a fine job with their roles and they clearly have matured in their acting abilities. I was very impressed. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore does a good job (though in my mind he will never really be Dumbledore), and of course, my favorite actor, Mr Alan Rickman finally has more to do, and yet, though played to utter perfection, still feels underutilized. Sad, really, all things considered...    The special effects are top-notch and flawless and they clearly get better with each film (unlike other things...)     I am giving this film 4 stars regardless of my gripes, because although they changed ALOT, the movie was still enjoyable and well, it IS Harry Potter.
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|A fine cast of  well-written characters on CASTLE breaks through a set of stereotypes to create a witty set of who-done-it tales.  Wit, charm, and intelligence are hallmarks of the series and therefore the DVDs.  We have seen the strong but self-destructive female detective brilliantly portrayed (SAVING GRACE), the  hero-dependent waif ( (THE MENTALIST) and a creator of a career that jeopardizes  her real world life (THE CLOSER).  Plus or minus charm,  most male leads in dramas are stereotyped principled guys who  ultimately solve the problems associated with a mystery and often punctuate  their seriousness with a witty Real Guy joke.  In CASTLE the romance between the male and female protagonists has an unconsummated,  fine tension between equals and actually consistently is driven by examples of articulate repartee.           Consistently well-written by folk who may have actually read a book or appreciated a play, the leading romantic duo are bolstered by a marvelous Diva mother/Grandmother who has a brain, lively/sexy life goals and understands her handsome and talented son.  Unique in the world is also the daughter of the male protagonist who is beautiful, wholesome, intelligent and well-mannered.  The strength of CASTLE has been from the inception the brilliantly written characters, but the mystery elements improve in each tale.         This is a fun series and a great way for grown-ups to spend an evening with characters who actually have brains and use them.  The leads are the required beautiful persons, but both male and female leads are equally well-written and charismatic.   It is not high art,  but it is splendid entertainment for folks who also enjoy BONES, NCIS,  and NUMBERS.

B001493FK8|5.0|I picked up my copy of \\"A Game of Thrones\\" at a local used bookstore about six-years ago.  I was just browsing and thought it looked worth the 3.50 for a good-sized fantasy book.  I got to the register and the woman said that I was in for a treat.  She couldn't have been more correct,  I loved it.  George R.R. Martin masterfully creates one of my favorite fantasy worlds, weaving political intrigue and action throughout.  If you enjoy fantasy I can't see you not liking this, everyone I have loaned this book to has enjoyed it just as thoroughly as I have.  I will say one thing though read them slowly, Martin has a lot on his plate, (including a possible a Song of Ice and Fire HBO series) so he's had to push back release of his \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" for quite sometime.  I await \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" with more anticipations than I ever waited for one of the Wheel of Time books if that gives you any indication of where I place these books on my personal fantasy list.<br /><br />The characters are complex and grow with each new installment, each chapter in these books is written from one of their perspectives.  The world is rich and engrossing.  The tale just keeps getting better with each book.  I know it seems I am gushing about it but that's because A song of Ice and Fire is just that good.<br /><br />Get this book you won't regret it.
0385504225|3.0|I shall be fair with Dan Brown.  Outperforming his Da Vinci Code is something he will never achieve.  The Code was original, smart, hit hard on the Catholic Church (I am Catholic myself but took the book as not serious) and generated such a polemic that made the book known worldwide and a difficult benchmark for himself.  I then read Angels & Demons which I also found a more interesting plot than the Code and even more considering that it was written before.    Nevertheless, and in the full awareness of the above, when I started reading the Lost Symbol I felt like I was reading any of the other two plots:  Langdon being contacted in Boston, being flown to a new destination, meeting a girl in dispair, a mentally deformed and & physically handicapped foe, etc. etc.      What's new?  Has Brown lost his own originality?

B000NQRE0K|4.0|Braveheart is an inspiring film. One with great direction, breathtaking cinematography and a very gripping(albeit inaccurate) story. Since the onset of High Definintion and Blu-Ray, I have been salivating at the prospect of this film being released in HD and it's finnally here.<br /><br />Braveheart tells the story of William Wallace, the scottish freedom fighter that inspired a nation to face England head on, is a virtual clinic in epic filmaking. Arguably Mel Gibson's best film, (both as a director and actor) the succeeds at so many levels, that it is easy to forgive the historical inaccuracies that so many critics have pointed at the film. Not only beacuse the result is such a powerful film, but since the most of what we know of William Wallace is based on legend, word and song. Gibson and screenwriter Randall Wallace take broad creative liscense in telling this story, but the result is a film that makes you want to go out and fight for whatever cause you feel is worth fighting for.<br /><br />But many words have already been written praising this film as is. Lets go into the HD transfer. This Blu-Ray features impressive picture and sound quality. Braveheart was realeased in 1995, which is fairly recent compared with other HD transfers so one would expect at least the possibility of a near-flawless transfer and for the most part it delivers. The colors are rich and detail is clear throughout. The stunning vistas that help the film give it so much of it's character and personality look breathtaking in HD. The greens especially, which is so prominent in the hills of Scotland and the fields where the battles take place in the film. Textures come through quite nicely with clothing and surfaces looking quite good.<br /><br />It is not without some minor flaws though. I was able to pick up several scratches and things of that sort throughout the film which I found strange considering that the film is not that old. Apparently the master from which the transfer was made was not in optimal condition or was not cleaned up properly. Which is another issue. It is again minor, but I feel the film could've looked cleaner. It is also a bit inconsistent with some scenes looking better than others. However, I don't want people to read this review and think that these issues are big enough to hinder the enjoyment one can get from watching this film in HD. This things are quite minor and you really notice them if you are combing over the film like I did for this review. I mention them because given the quality and importance of the film I was expecting a little bit more work from the studio when it came to the transfer but the operative word here is minor.<br /><br />Overall, this is a must-buy for fans of this film and film in general. Despite minor issues, this is the most breathtaking Bravheart has looked and sounded. Ever. Better I would say, than in theaters. So pop it in you BD player and cry: \\"FREEDOM!\\"tion or was not cleaned up properly. Which is another issue. It is again minor, but I feel the film could've looked cleaner.

B001FB4VXU|5.0|The show was recently discovered by my eleven year old son, so we got the season DVDs for him for his birthday. Some of the humor is over his head, but the basic concept (4 nerds and a girl) is hilarious to him AND me, my husband, and my 15 year old daughter. The Sheldon character is a scream! It's one of the few shows that entertains us all.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|For me, Dan Brown's books are like Domino's cheese and tomato sauce pizzas:  they aint bad, but they aint good either.  \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is admittedly a page-turning, up to a certain point, and then the book bogs down and sloshes over the same items again and again and again.  Toward the end, I found myself skimming the book because I could tell it was all over and what I was reading was just filler. And the ending of the book was really disappointing, but it wasn't as stupid as \\"Angels and Demons\\" which was mind-bogglingly asinine.  But Brown does manage to make the reader sit back and say \\"Oh, come on!\\" once again when the hero, Langdon, is trapped in a box--I won't say more.<br /><br />Brown's writing style hasn't changed much:  his Perils-of-Pauline chapter structure continues for over a hundred or so chapters.  Rather than adding interest or suspense, after a while it is predictable and downright annoying.  Getting back to our hero for a moment:  he's a cardboard cut-out.  We get to learn precious little more about him; he is merely a vehicle by which Brown can transport us across the DC landscape. The villain is nicely grotesque and villainy.  There's a kind of a heroine, I guess.  And the supporting characters are shades and degrees between the two extremes.<br /><br />There is no doubt that the plot is entertaining.  And the Mason references are all very interesting.  Hopefully, however, much of Brown's linguistic pontification and erudition will not be taken all that seriously, as for example, his explanation of the etymology of the word \\"sincere,\\" which is more folk etymology than fact.<br /><br />Lastly, this review is on the Kindle edition, so I didn't have a chance to participate in the decoding of the cover game that owners of the hard-bound edition were privy to.  The formatting was very nice (Kindle 2), but I still can't understand how spell and grammar checker allows certain typos to get through, as I've seen in several Kindle editions.

B000P0J09W|5.0|I never tire of this movie, I've seen it dozens of times and still love it.
B002MW50KO|4.0|They say you can't polish a turd, but Dylan comes pretty darn close here.  For this reveiewer, it's a marriage of heaven and hell, as few things irritate me more than listening to Christmas Carols, yet BD is my favourite recording artist. I own every (official) album he has released,and chances are if he elected to release a cd of polka hits hummed to a cacophany of pounding saucepans, i'd probably buy it.  That said, this is what it is: a collection of Christmas songs given the Dylan stamp.   It's interesting in part because people normally concentrate on Bob's songwriting and neglect the fact that he is an incredible performer and interpreter of others' material. These songs may not hit the highs of \\"Black Jack Davey\\" or \\"Two Soldiers\\", but some of them - despite the familiarity of the material - feel like they wouldn't be out of place on a recent Dylan album. The arrangements are more than listenable, with a couple of winces thrown in here and there.  Including the photo of Bettie Page in Christmas costume on the booklet may be Dylan's succinct and cynical summary of what's on offer here - the wolf has wrapped himself in wholesome garb.  Perhaps it would have benefited from a later release closer to Christmas, but Dylan fans will buy his albums any time he chooses to release them. If you don't like Dylan - or haven't listened to him in 30 years - this probably won't convert you.  It should be added that my wife - not a Dylan fanatic, but still enjoys some of his recent albums - didn't think much of this effort.   It's probably best to listen to this cd alone. Scotch helps.

B000002AH1|3.0|As a record label, what do you do when one of your boldest artists has just recorded several days of some of the most innovative, forward-looking music of his career? In making this 1972 double LP, Columbia decided to junk all but the last day, which some band members called the weakest, and then mix it with studio sessions recorded months earlier by a different lineup, additionally cutting and splicing everything up. Miles Davis fans have often had mixed feelings about the Frankenstein monster that is LIVE-EVIL, and the release of [[ASIN:B000AP2Z6C The Cellar Door Sessions 1970]] boxset was greeted with applause by those who wanted to hear the recording session in its entirety, and free of Teo Macero's studio editing.<br /><br />I'd have to join the chorus that proclaims LIVE-EVIL a weak album. As interesting as some of its moments are, it feels like a patchwork in a way that BREW, though it used its fair share of splicing, never did. There's some interesting use of new technology here, such as Davis' use of wah-wah pedal with his trumpet and Chick Corea's expanded electric piano timbres. Airto Moreira contributes Brazilian percussion and whistles, which gives a whole new variety to Miles' sound. Nonetheless, things just don't grow into a larger convincing whole. The one big exception is the track \\"What I Say\\", the only performance from these sessions provided in its entirety and without studio trickery. This is easily one of the greatest tracks on a Miles Davis release, and the solos within from Davis, John McLaughlin and Jack Dejohnette here are awesome achievements.<br /><br />LIVE-EVIL might be enjoyable listening if you are saving your pennies for the The Cellar Door sessions boxset, but it is quite flawed and I'm still scratching my head wondering what Columbia was thinking.
B002SVBDYQ|3.0|I didn't like the Twilight movie that much, but I loved the soundtrack.  I was hoping to get more of the same from this soundtrack, which is definitely not the case.  There are a lot of good songs on the soundtrack, but I was hoping for some more driving rock, and it is almost all soft indie-rock.  While the songs are good, and I think the songs reflect the somber feelings that Bella is going through in the book, the songs start to sound the same after a while.  With a few exceptions, the songs are very slow and heavy on the reflective emotions.  Taken in parts, the soundtrack is great.  Taken as a whole, it gets tedious for me near the end.
0684830485|5.0|For Whom the Bell Tolls is one of Hemingway's  masterpieces.The novel is  set during the Spanish Civil War and at the center of it is Robert Jordan an American who has joined the international brigades supporting the democratic Spanish government against the Fascist insurgency led by Fransisco Franco. The focus is onJordan and the loyalist guerillas he is with and their mission of blowing up a key bridge which would enable the loyalists to trap a fascist army, The other part of the novel focuses on Jordans relationships with the guerillas particularily a young woman named Maria. Jordan and Maria fall in love and it is a compelling story but Jordans relationships with the guerilla leader Pablo and his wife Pilar as well as the other loyalists  are also compelling. The novel has an air of tragedy about it for the fascists destroy a large loyalist army before the bridge can be demolished and we know that the Fascists end up winning the war. Jordan is one of Hemingways most compelling heroes and he carries the novels. You see Spain through his eyes and Hemingway makes you believe you are in Spain in late 1938. This is  a great novel and I recommend it highly

0307269981|5.0|Just as \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" topped my list of exciting fiction in 2008, so, too, does the sequel in 2009, the second book in Stieg Larsson's trilogy set in Stockholm.  You'll have missing links if you don't read \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" first.  In \\"Fire\\", Larsson engages in a better portrayal of heroine Lisbeth Salander, filling in the \\"missing links\\" from her past.<br /><br />Lisbeth is accused of committing three murders, some two years after her last adventure and successfully goes into hiding.  Her small group of advocates stand by her, including Mikael Blomkvist, who is working on an expose of the sex trade for his Milennium magazine.  Violence and dark topics permeate the pages, and, once again, the reader is engrossed in the plotline, which unfolds rapidly, despite the book's 500+ pages.  It will have you wanting more, and luckily, the third and book in the series (Larsson died and the books have been published posthumously) releases in 2010.<br /><br />Easily my top fiction read of the year so far!  Recommended reading after you finish \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\".
0385504225|1.0|As other reviewers have mentioned, Dan Brown is no literary genius. His writing style is as if he already knows this will be a blockbuster movie (and I know which character is designed for Morgan Freeman to play!). Can someone do a word count of how many ridiculous exclamations of shock (i.e. \\"What in the world?!\\") are used in this book? Too many silly bouts of disbelieving dialogue, too much repetition of the Ancient Mysteries (as if Brown realizes that no one is going to understand what the big deal is--and, despite all the needless repetition, I still don't see what the big deal is); an \\"imminent crisis\\" that would barely make the front page of the New York Times if it were to come to light; a protagonist who literally does nothing in the final third of the book; an evil genius whose secret identity is telegraphed almost immediately; and finally and most objectionably, a payoff that is anything but.    With A&D and DVC I was able to get past Brown's downright bad writing because the plot kept me turning the pages; the books were legitimately compelling, largely because they were controversial. But so little happens in his latest book, there are so few surprises, and the characters spout off their surprise so often (it's as if he wants to show how shocking these \\"revelations\\" are because the reader just won't care otherwise)--well, there's just not enough there to overcome his weaknesses with prose.    Predictable, painful at times to read due to the poor writing, little to no climax, no controversy, an even more ridiculous and improbable a villain than normal--this is, plain and simple, a bad book, no two ways about it. It should say something that while reading it I picked up and finished several other books because I just couldn't get through it without taking a break for some good writing. I will most definitely NOT be in line on day one for his next one.
0385504225|3.0|Let me start by saying I am on the fence about Dan Brown.  He has had some good books (Angels,Da Vinci), and some not so good ones (Digital Fortress, Deception Point).  So it was with some modest trepidation that I purchased The Lost Symbol wondering if I should have waited a bit longer for the paperback version to come out and save some money.  After a somewhat quick 2 day read, I have come to the conclusion that I should have waited, or at least went to the local library and checked the book out for free.  Overall, it tells a somewhat interesting story, and even seems to make one or two good points in the end about humanity and the like.  However, I could not help but feel that much of the book, like a previous reviewer stated, was more of an an attempt to make it \\"movie-like\\" and fluff it up with all sorts of frivilous details that would have been better left out.  In addition, scattered throughout the book were refrences to Angels and Da Vinci Code that had no actual purpose for advancing the plot of the story.  It seemed like his follow-up work was more of a pitch of go back and read his previous two if you had not already done so.  I was even shocked to see critical reviews for The Da Vinci Code on the back cover and not reviews for the actual book I was about to read!!  It seems to me that Dan Brown, possibly not of his own volition, but that of his publishers, has fallen into the role of a cookie-cutter story teller where he takes the same outline that worked for his previous two books and simply inserted a few new facts and locations to make this book sell.  I feel that I did not experience anything new, but simply re-read an older story set in a new location.  Overall, I'd recommend folks to wait until the paperback comes out and save a few bucks, or even better yet, check it out at the library for free.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I am officially a die hard Evanescence fan now. This album is better than the other ones, bringing back the same sound and interesting lyrics as before - but 100 times better. As always, Amy Lee and the band kick butt.<br />This album is filled with good music. There isn't a single one I dislike. At first I didn't care for a few songs, but after hearing them a few times, I was hooked.<br />The best song on the album in my opinion is \\"The Only One,\\" of which I had never heard before listening to the album. Definitely an overlooked piece of work. The album includes hits such as \\"Call Me When You're Sober,\\" \\"All That I'm Living For,\\" \\"Sweet Sacrifice,\\" \\"Lithium,\\" and \\"Good Enough.\\"<br />For those of you who have never heard of Evanescence, they are a metal/rock band like no other, with a very disticnt sound, best known for putting the piano in a lot of their rock music as well as the vocalist Amy Lee's voice. If you prefer softer music, I would suggest that you purchase their first album \\"Fallen\\".<br />For those of you who DO know who Evanescence is - BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
055380684X|5.0|I was not 30 minutes into this book when I realized how right it is and how I could use it in my own life.  I play guitar, of example, and once I started using this system my playing improved.  And if you follow the author's advice like I have you will see immediate improvement in what you do.  It is about building brain cells called myelin and the more we practice, they more of them we build.  Anyone can be great is the message of this book and it is right on.
B00007E8NM|5.0|This is my new reference quality SACD. The multichannel track brings the 3 instruments out into the room with clarity and accuracy that is rare even in SACDs. The session and performances are equally stunning. Do not miss out on this one.
B002IYEQR4|1.0|The one thing you shouldn't defile is the things we grow up looking to as kids. Things like super heroes. This movie took that notion and destroyed it. Most of the \\"powers\\" were the same. Super heroes raped super heroines, for crying out loud. FOUL! The only saving grace at all was Rorshack.

0375842209|5.0|This fiction book came recommended to me, even though I tend to read non-fiction history.  I was pleasantly surprised not only by the approach taken by the author in telling the story, but also the attention to detail.  Worth the time, even for me - it is now being passed around to my family members and work associates.
0385504225|2.0|Dan Brown is a very gifted writer who can make a mundane story suspenseful and keep the reader's interest. Good thing---because this book lacks any substance and the main story is unclear. I was expecting all manner of intrigue about the Free Masons and there was none--a real disappointment. All we got was some synbolism in the Washington Monument and the U.S. Capitol. Maybe Mr. Brown received pressure from the Masons not to write about them---if so, they were very successful. Most of the book is about a guy named Mal'akh whom I expected to unleash all manner of evil on the world. But his story just fizzled out about three-quarter way through the book and the rest of the book just meanders through the Washington Monument. Not a thriller at all!
B000VLE3IS|5.0|first i bought zep's early and latter day best of together as an actual set and i like it alot and still do, so i wasn't sure about this having already having most songs in another format, now that i've bought Mothership i love the live dvd included. and no matter what format i listen to led zeppelin in, i'm just really happy that they gave the world such great music. and the fact they finally reunited after so many years puts a smile on my face. if you're a new or old fan and are wondering whether you should buy this or not i say buy it cause it's Led Freakin' Zeppelin one of the most influential bands of the 1970's who when starting out were told they'd sink like a led balloon??....don't doubt yourself any longer and buy this limited edition cd/dvd
B0029LHW4U|4.0|I have been an Alice in Chains fan since the early 90's with my favorite album being Dirt. When I heard that AIC was making an album without Layne I laughed. Then I heard the new album on a radio preview and was impressed. It is not a masterpiece by any means, but it is still a great album.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|My favorite album of Buble's yet (and I have all of them). I really can't think of anything I would change on it - it contains the perfect recipe of soul, swing, snappiness, blues and pop. Personal favorites included \\"Heartache Tonight,\\" \\"Crazy Love\\" (so high-caliber I can't decide if I love Buble's, Morrison's or Aaron Neville's version best) and \\"Haven't Met You Yet.\\"   This is definitive Buble, but by no means predictable - a triumph!
B0000027G6|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this soundtrack!  In my opinion, it contains some of the most beautiful music ever created.  Every time I hear \\"The John Dunbar Theme\\", especially, I get chills, and am moved to tears. This theme has been used by the local PBS station for quite some time as background for an ad (perhaps, a special about National Parks???--I don't remember because every time I hear it, I'm caught up in the beauty of the melody, and don't pay attention to what the video portion is!).  At any rate, I knew it was from \\"Dances with Wolves\\", and finally decided that I would not be satisfied until I had my very own copy to listen to whenever I wanted.  And I'm so happy with my purchase.  Thank you.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Of COURSE I love the product.  It came as it said it would.  I would just add the that Amazon sent it even earlier than expected.  That;s why I keep coming back.
B001TODCII|5.0|I rented this movie first, then bought it right away. I love watching the good guy kick butt on the bad guys! Liam Neeson was great in this movie. Good action, as well.
0307266303|4.0|Born to run has a refreshing outlook on runners. It delighted me to read this and get into the heads of runners. My son had finished an Ironman race and I wanted to understand why, this book did it for me. Fun read and very beautiful people and places. It's an adventure that will help to create more adventures and understand the runners adventure and pitfalls. Then when you ask \\"why does my foot hurt?\\" it won't seem so serious.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|This strobe has everything a Nikon shooter would want. Forget the negative stuff about overheating. That safety feature is good. Study the manual for all the set up features.
1439102813|5.0|This is one of the best and best-written books I've read.  I devoured it in less than 48 hours - couldn't put it down.  It's absolutely fabulous - I loved it. I cried - visibly during the last 5-6 chapters.  What a rush....I can't stop thinking about it.  It was incredibly well written and was so very, very real. This is a must read for everyone - whether you have been or are directly affected by the disease.
0767812166|5.0|Best view of the other world I have ever seen from a totally different viewpoint.    It's ashame the military wanted to destroy verse assist the other side toward PEACE.    I'm glad he left, before it was too late.    It was an excellent movie.
B001V9LPWQ|3.0|Restoration is extraiordinaray and English language sounds great, however as on most blu-ray disnery restorations spanish sound is terrible, voices are way below expectations making all the effort on image be lost.  when Walt was still alive Disney paid great attention to double on foreign languages, unfortunaetly this is not the case with current adminsitration.
B002BFIN6K|2.0|Let's take the best known piece in the set - Prelude in C# Minor. Listen to this recording then listen to the version on the RCA Red Label Complete Recordings set (Disk 10). Next try the one on the \\"Rachmaninoff Plays Rachmaninoff\\" on the Laserlight label. Finally listen to the one on \\"A Window in Time\\" collection - another digital reproduction but taken from piano rolls rather than the 78 disks. Now go back and listen to this one again. It comes across as flat and lifeless in comparison to any one of the other three versions. It just doesn't have any dynamic passion. It sounds like it was played by a robot that was programmed to imitate human emotion but is incapable of feeling it. That absence of feeling is very apparent here. Somehow the folks at Telarc managed to capture it in the \\"A Window in Time\\" recreation - you never get the feeling that there is anything other than a human pianist, (and a great one at that), sitting at the keyboard. Here - sorry to say, not so much. To borrow, and bend, a quote from the movie Seven Year Itch: \\"It did not shake me, it did not quake me, it did not make me feel goose-pimply all over.\\" Rachmaninoff really ought to - don't you think?
0385504225|2.0|I was so excited to read this when it came out.  [[ASIN:B002CF0GP0 Angels and Demons (Robert Langdon's First Adventure)]] and [[ASIN:1400079179 The Da Vinci Code]]are two of my favorite books.  I've read each of them at least 7 times if not more, so I couldn't wait for this one to come out.  Unfortunetley it just didn't work for me.    To me it seems Dan Brown had a cookie cutter outline for all three books.  With the first two it was fine, but by the third it just made the book predictable.  As it was I figured out the AH HA moment less then half way through the book.  Then I kept wondering what happened to Robert Langdon...it seemed between The DaVinci Code and this one that he lost some of his intelligence.  I felt like he had to constantly look to someone else to explain what was going on.  It got annoying after a while.      Basically I'm just glad I borrowed the book from my father and didn't spend money on it.  This is one I will defintely not read again.
0385504225|3.0|For almost 500 pages I was enjoying the story and looking toward the CLIMAX. Very disappointing last 30 or so pages - boring. Probably won't go back to Dan Brown again.
B000005JA8|5.0|12/23/10 RIP Mr Van Viet.<br /><br />What Sergent Pepper was to all of rock after it, Trout Mask Replica is to the rock avant gaurd. Listen to any Pere Ubu or James White and the Contortions, and you can trace its exsistance back Trout Mask Replica. Yet this was done ten years before and still sounds infinately more daring. The album is the first and last word in avant-rock.<br /><br />Before 1969, both Beefheart and producer here Frank Zappa had recorded. But most regarded Frank's work as \\"comedy rock\\"-wrongly-and had never heard of Captian Beefheart. Rock was still a reletively new medium, and people who bought records in general did not understand surrealism, which both artists were deeply engaged in.<br /><br />Trout Mask Replica was a sharp left turn, for ALL of rock. At first blush, with is grating textures and atonality, it seems to work on free jazz unterpinnings, but this is just not the case. Beefheart rehearsed this material with his Magic Band for months. Wikipedia says 14-hour days. Every player's part was written, and the band worked until it SOUNDED improvised. In truth, Beefheart was writting modern classical music.<br /><br />Trout Mask contains contains short tracks with Beefheart spitting out his masterful poems \\"white elephant escaped from zoo with love,\\" \\"a silver bowl rings up in inches,\\" Fast and boulbus. It does not make sense, but it makes perfect sense. His imagery is abstract, but 100% concrete. Beefheart writes about things we see each minute of every day. He just words them differently. Had he never written a note, he would be one of our best poets.<br /><br />The band plays their instruments in a primative tone, as if you are around a camp fire with experimental musicans on a particularly trippy night. In fact, a lot of this was recorded outside, and has this rustic feel.<br /><br />The only difference between this and a country campfire record is that the band is playing notes that work \\"against each other. Wierd time signatures change by the bar. Beefheart screams, shouts, barks, but when he sings, man can he do so.<br /><br />Magic Band's interplay is magic. They do little atonal scales, working off each other's rythms, listening so all the parts meld.<br />Pay particular attention to the cracking cymbals, opened and closed materfully by Drumbo. They seem to give new power to your tweeters<br /><br />If you are new to Beefheart, try to get Trout Mask on vynal. This is not for audio reasons. Zappa lines the songs up here so you get poppier tracks next to jazz solos, studio dialouge, all the diversity of Beefheart that he has filtered through Trout Mask's sound. In 1969 this made sense. Four sides to a double album. A start, middle and end to each. On CD, at around 75 minutes, this cohearance is gone, and everything seems to run together.<br /><br />If you can't get vynal, try what I did when I first got this: put the CD on. go track by track, Try to isolate the pop from the jazz from the spoken word and group each type of track and listen to them. Then go back and play the whole CD in order. Once you know the songs, it gets easier to find the throughline, and presto-- it all comes together. This album is jarring enough, and if you try to sit through the whole run, it will be overwhelming. You will get frustrated, put on a Beatles album, and miss out on a lot of great music.<br /><br />This is too great to let that happen, but when he sings, man can he do so.

0385504225|5.0|I started to read this book's couple of pages around 10:30pm and I fell sleep. I thought oh, this is not good. But then the other day I just couldn't put it down. It was exciting. Same Dan Brown twists.

B002KDUDG6|4.0|I really do enjoy this cd.  Michael Buble is extremely talented as a performer and a vocalist and it is pretty hard for him to do wrong.  But he does hit some definite missteps here.  When I played it for the first time I was rather puzzled wondering what sort of cd he had tried to put together.  It was very different from his others and I had to play it another 5 to 6 times before I really formed my true opinion.<br /><br />Michaels's previous cds have all emphasized pop standards sung with class and quality in the big band style.  He would also throw in a couple of redos of more current songs for fun.  He also started to venture into the pop genre with his singles HOME and EVERYTHING.  He continues his venture here with HAVEN'T MET YOU YET which seems to be getting mixed reviews.  I first found it rather simple but find it to be a fun, playful song on this new cd.<br /><br />It is obvious that Michael is trying to go more pop on this cd and the result will end up in mixed reactions from fans.  What truly stands out is that the styling and interpretations he applies to most of the standards here are just off the mark.  CRY ME A RIVER is an emotional song in itself with its heartwrenching lyrics.  Rather than emphasize the emotional delivery he has a loud orchestral intro worthy of James Bond lead up to his vocal.  It just doesn't work and is over the top big time.  The other is STARDUST sung with NATURALLY 7.  I felt like I was listening to the Andrew Sisters or even Lawrence Welk.  This was such an old fashioned sappy interptretation that has no emotional value.  This song also could have been perfect for his vocal gifts.<br /><br />So he is going pop and the cover of the cd is CRAZY LOVE, a very old song that has been sung by so many and is pure pop candy.  He sings it so simple and adds nothing to it.  There is no Michael Buble magic.  It is a simple filler song on the cd yet he finds it worthy of being the title.  I also was excited when I saw he would be singing the pop classic AT THIS MOMENT.  Again, he gave a simple rendition of a song that asks to be played with dramatically.  I also found the orchestration on YOU'RE NOBODY TILL SOMEBODY LOVES YOU to drag.  I kept waiting for it to build a little but this was another rather boring rendition.<br /><br />What works for me here are ALL OF ME, GEORGIA ON MY MIND, HOLD ON and the real fun HEARTACHE TONIGHT.  I went into the flaws I founds so extensively only because this is Michael Buble a singer with vocal and emotive abilities of the highest caliber.  There is nothing I hate here or need to skip over.  I just wanted to be honest with my review.  And the honest truth is even with these flaws I play the cd over and over and really love the new single HAVEN'T MET YOU YET.  I even laugh at the over the top drama to CRY ME A RIVER.  I really am a hard core Buble fan and give him high kudos for trying to venture out and try different things on this cd.  Some small missteps don't take away from this being immensely enjoyable.  Sadly, if you really want Michael singing the standards with the big orchestra this cd might not be to your taste.  But for those who appreciate the true talent Michael Buble has it will be lots of fun to go on this new venture with him.IS MOMENT.

It has to be that I am still eating the wrong things.  Yesterday, was my first day on the workout, I bought it 6 months ago, I got on one of my diet kicks, and lost motivation right away, my feet ankles and knees were hurting too bad!  But I broke all of those bones 3 years ago, motor cycle accident, thats how I gained 60lbs.  Not usually a majorly overweight person.  So anyway, I've been watching the show since the first season, and I was like all these people are puking and crying over working out, what gives??  So I tryed the workout today, now I know why all the puking and crying??  I was almost there myself.  I was on the verge of tears, and was yelling at Jillian, and she just said right at the exact time, come on you can do it!!  So I did the workout in the entirety, and I was holding back the puke when I was done.  It was so hard, and my muscles were screaming!! I'm going to do this everyday, and take a break on the 7th day.  No matter what I feel like, I felt awesome, and full of energy the rest of the day!  But i will do this first thing in the morning, not after I have eaten.

0307269981|5.0|Dragon Tattoo was what this genre is all about.  Now The Girl who Played with Fire is even better!  This is character, plot, suspense, noir, everything you want in a murder mystery.  These are characters you really care about who surprise you over and over again and yet are absolutely true to the psychological ear and believable. Each character, even the minor ones, are revealed as you would experience them in life. Extraordinary unusual female heroine. That the author died suddenly and left us with only 3 of the books he had planned is a tragedy for those of us who love fiction and particularly this genre.  This is as good as it gets.  I await number 3 with baited breath and a broken heart.

0385504225|2.0|I loved \\"The DaVinci Code\\" so was looking forward to \\"Lost Symbol\\"  It started off well with promising points of interest like the Freemasons and Washington, D.C. and a menacing villain.  But the narrative became bogged down in lots of minutia, a plethora of boring details that most educated people ought to know already, little psychological insight, hardly any character development, and individual reactions to events that are impossible to believe = try walking down the Washington Monument just hours after having your hand lopped off.  How Brown could make this so boring and unrealistic is a feat in itself.  The book needed lots of editing and more creativity!  Sorry I wasted my time.

Highly recommended to fans as well as newcomers to Thomas Pynchon's fiction.

The true interesting part came from tracks of well-known artists who surprised with a more melancholic sound than their typical repertoire. I am glad that New Moon's soundtrack took the risky move of not trying to please the wide audience. Being so different from the Twilight soundtrack may detract the more mainstream audience. However, in the sake of art, I find this composition of tracks to suit perfectly the emotional charge of the book.     Thank you for a great compilation!

0545123267|5.0|If you adore \\"Twilight\\" and \\"New Moon\\"...You will adore \\"Shiver\\".<br />Its focus is on teens but i know adults will enjoy it too.<br />Both my daughter and i enjoyed the urban mystery and supernatural<br />romance this book holds.<br />Instead of putting it on my bookshelf when she was done. My daughter put it on hers!
1416594787|5.0|If you are a creaionist, this is not for you.  It might make you think and you don't want that.  Well written, interesting thoughts,  and provocative ideas.  Dawkins makes you think about the world, the universe, and your place in it.    A worthy purchase from Amazon.    Recommended for all those who want to continue to understand evolutionary biology.

B001P50HOI|5.0|I saw this tour and it was awesome.  The orchestra was kind of drowned out but that was ok with me.  The setlist is like none they ever did before.  Wicked versions of Starship Trooper and Gates of Dellerium.  Ritual is also a rarity.  Longest Yes show I've attended by far.  I can rate this because I have the DVD which is great but now I can put in the old Ipod!  Good stuff.
0515141429|5.0|This is the first book in the series and maybe the best.  You get insight into the character, Jack Reacher, as well as a great story line, great action, and a great ending. Reacher going to prison for the weekend is quite riveting, as you can imagine it not being a pleasant place and one hard to survive in, much less escape injury. This is the first time we see Reacher in action and understand what drives and motivates him. The story centers around a small town in the south, an unidentified body, a suspect, corruption, etc. Reacher must find out who was killed, who did the killing, and stay alive the whole time. A must read.
1400112559|5.0|This is a wonderful book for dog and their owners. Even if you have lived with and loved dogs your whole life, as I have, you will learn an enormous amount about their behaviour, motivations, and inclinations. This is a serious book based on science and observation, and it is fun to read.
1881273156|4.0|The book is very good at helping one look at themselves and understand the love they own.  It also helps you understand/identify how people close to you view love, and what type of love is in their make-up.  The book will not save your marriage, but certainly helps identify, if what work you are putting into your relationship is good, quality work. The book actually will let you know if you made a mistake and didn't wait about 2 years before you uttered the words, \\"I do\\"...   easy read, great to pass along to friends or your child that has reached his/her late teen years.

B002GY9F9K|4.0|I read volumes 1-7 of the Goodkind series about 6 months before this television series came out, not knowing it was in production. As with most written works, particularly fantasy, it was somewhat jarring seeing the characters come to life on the screen.  The 'reality' of the characters the books had created in my mind was a bit different from the video version.  In particular, I pictured Richard as a powerful man (like Chase) rather than a boy becoming a man as in this video.    The Kahlan character is just as if she stepped out of the page onto the screen. She is the spitting image of the character described in the books. Bridget Regan lends an ethereal quality to her performance which completes the characterization    Zed's character too is pretty damn close, particularly physically. The whimsy that Bruce Spence lends the character was not in the books for me, I pictured more of a Ian McKellen type, but I have no complaints about Spence.    The most revelatory thing to be found on these discs is the 'true' voice of Craig Horner. I knew he was Aussie, but he has a beautiful, vibrant expressive natural voice in the documentary and audio commentaries which he totally eschewed in this series, choosing an adolescent American accent.    If you've ever listened to the old Superman radio show from the 40's where Bud Collyer (!) plays Clark Kent as a wimpy adolescent and then drops his voice a couple of octaves to be a gruff he-man sounding Superman then you've got a great comparison to Horner as Richard and Horner as his real self. I wish he'd chosen a voice nearer to his own, it would lend more credence to the character and make him less of a Luke Skywalker clone and more of the mature man portrayed in the books.    Still and all, there's very little to really dislike here. The New Zealand scenery is spectacular, and the sets are elaborate and realistic.    There is a short 'making of' documentary included as a bonus. This is not the 'making of' doc broadcast early in the televised schedule. And there is an interesting doc featuring author Terry Goodkind, which takes pains to show how affluent his books have made him.    Reproduction for the standard DVD is first rate.      Get this if you like good fantasy and want to see more of the fantastic New Zealand landscape we all loved in the Ring trilogy.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|OMG, this was the first of the 14 that I plan to buy and it is the sound that has made me sure that I do want all 14. The sound is so clean. Believe it or not, I was still using vinyl and a penny on the needle to play the old Beatles about 19 years ago, and I grew to like the old hiss the vinyl had.  But go out and buy the Remastered,it is all worth it, and the companies didnt gouge us with excess prices.
1416594787|5.0|Dawkins is a rock star not because of his scientific standing but for his ongoing crusade against religion. One infuriating tendency are the smartass digs he manages to insert regardless of their aptness for the current conversation whether writing or speaking. Dawkins is not an original or creative thinker as many think. No new insights or discoveries ca be recalled. Instead, he is an explicator, a teacher and debater, perhaps as important as new discoveries of great truths.  He excells in connecting the dots - quotes, scientific wonderings, old and new research along with some science for the layman - all with an educated, witty style.     THE GREATEST SHOW is unlike his other books in that it deals with \\"evidence\\" that is simultaneously overwhelming and stark.  He delights in berating ignorant folks (primarily Americans) who believe the world is 6,000 years old and cave folk played with T Rex.  As a lifelong Bible Belt resident I can attest that this thinking exists but it is more due to lack of scientific exposure as religion. Many times, a simple explanation will set folks right or at least thinking.     The included color photos are FANTASTIC.  Prose is nice but accompanying photographs add so much more. Hopefully, this will become the norm for all his future books. An initial discussion of \\"types\\" of Evolution (human-directed, other specie-directed, nature/mutation directed) is followed by several related subjects,  He slowly builds a  magnificent edifice of logic and data that leaves no room for doubt and covers almost all the bases - from dating to missing links.   While its audience may be diehard Evolution advocates (the \\"saved\\" as Clinton was so fond of saying) it is a book that deserved to be written.  My Grade -  A-
0385504225|1.0|I love Dan Brown's other books, Angels & Demons is my fav.  So eager to read The Lost Symbol, espcially since I lived in DC, had toured some Masonic Temples and knew enough about the Masons to have my interest peaked. And, I realize these are not classics nor award winners, but exciting and often educational reads (at least for me).    Book started out ok, liked the female lead character, family history, etc. But soon I found myself skipping entire needlessly long paragraphs about stuff I had already read about pages earlier. Then the feeling hit that this is a screenplay for a blockbuster movie, not a novel. Next, I stopped making making the reality-jump to accept that so many experts had so much knowledge at their fingertips to spew off at perfectly convenient moments, and how great it is to have students ask just the right questions so that more information can be fored in front of our eyes.    About 2/3rd through, I completely stopped caring about the characters! And soon thereafter I couldn't believe the book kept on going, and going, and going, on and on, on and on, like some crazy mirror reflection trick - I kept saying 'just stop already!'    If you want to read this - borrow it from a library or friend. Dan Brown ought to be ashamed to publish this steaming pile of you know what!
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I bought this for a Book Club meeting and was initially disappointed at the format, which is a variety of letters among the characters.  However, it is so well written that I ended up enjoying it, and the format fit the time period and circumstances.  At first it may seem to be a fluff piece; post WW2 \\"authoress\\" gets to know quirky characters on the Channel Islands in order to write another book. However, there is  sadness and insight into the suffering of both London, Guernsey (which was occupied by the Germans) and Europe.  Juliet, the main character, is tougher and more complicated than you might initially think. A worthy read.
0385504225|3.0|the book started well then you can notice that it follows a repeated pattern that make it boring, and the end was the worst, everything was predictable and not the greatest ending in mysteries.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|This movie has a lot of heart. William Wilberforce almost single-handedly stood up against a noxious totally-ingrained-social institution and changed the world. This accomplishment was executed quite well in the movie. True, 'Amazing Grace,' does chronicle the end of slavery in Britain (and years before the Americans saw the light, at that), but it does so much more. By the way, Ioan Gruffudd performed beautifully.<br />Is this film relevant today. Oh yes, indeedy do. Would anyone care to name certain noxious-totally ingrained-social-institutions that have us under their thumb today?<br />Other than consumerism (shoddy products and service as well), oil dependency, corporate malfeasance, and press having been sold out to sensationalists instead of reporting the facts. Gee, I can't think of a thing.<br />If you would be a voice for change, for making the world a better place, you could do far worse than taking a page from Wilberforce's book. As to the title of this critique, Margaret Mead's full comment was \\"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever does.\\"<br />Some critics have complained this movie is boring. I agree. There are no car (carriage) chases, explosions, sordid sex scenes or other Hollywood staples. This move nevertheless has heart. It is about character.
B00007AJF8|5.0|While I have seen and enjoyed this film many times I figured with Where the Wild Things Are about to come out I'd give this film a re-look-see and write a proper review for it. BJM is on it's surface satirical take on modern famous types, unknown creative types, and what it is that makes those at both ends of the spectrum tick. Now while the true creative type from any discipline is compelled by unknown forces there are also those amongst them that are, shall we say, compelled by less pure forces. Those being fame and money. Still, even the pure artist needs recognition of some sort. After all, art is just another form of communication. Without anyone to communicate with an artist can go ever inwards and mad, I suspect, if one is not understood by others on some level. Craig Schwartz, is a pure artist who is at the start of the film misunderstood and not communicating, no matter how hard he tries, to those around him. As events unfold his wife leaves him and he is eventually thrust into the head of real life actor John Malkovich. This is where the film departs from what is typical in mainstream movies. Ambiguity, symbolism, and exploration of existential concepts is not what most people go to the films to enjoy decoding, thinking about, or passively watching.  Soon sexuality and the male and female body types we are born into are questioned and subsequently broken down. Also challenged is talent, fame and the notion that recognition comes from good art or just any established face in the public eye with some money to spend to explore any whim. Finally the film brings into question our very lives and if in fact we are in control of anything, or if some unseen force controls us. Craig Schwartz is a puppeteer who in fact winds up controlling John Malkovich and using his fame and money to further his personal self indulgent need to be a puppeteer is a never ending tunnel of mirrors like the very universe itself, where particles and matter are seemingly infinite outwards and inwards. This same topic is explored in other films written by Kaufman, Synecdoche, New York being the first that comes to mind with the never ending warehouses and smaller and smaller paintings.<br /><br />In ending we see a new life born, unaware that it is controlled by hidden forces. Is this each and every one of our experiences? This is food for thought in BJM. The film never fully explains itself and that is why the film is so great. For if everything were explained and summed up then there would be no reason to re-watch the film again and agin, seeing it fresh each time it's explored down the road.<br /><br />The inclusion of animals and higher primates in the film is symbolic. I suspect it alludes to our evolution, base animal nature and how we so often deny that we are in fact just another animal on this planet, albeit a creative one, apart but the same from all other creatures.<br /><br />The 1/2 floor represents our subconscious, and also animal side. Much is explored and hashed out in the 1/2 floor of that building. things go in and things go out. Personalities and desires, thoughts, hopes, dreams. The characters want to go back to the portal that is in there. The portal to ones true self.<br /><br />Comedy, a trait that most likely developed as a result of our higher brain functions, is explored as well. Comedy in this film is approached as absurdity. Existence is a bit absurd and this film takes it head on. Comedy probably developed as a buffer from the complex human brain running itself mad with endless thoughts about the nature of existence. These thoughts are explored and bubble up and out of the subconscious to the surface.<br /><br />This film is a masterwork by the writer and director. It will be remembered long after the drivel of the day is long forgotten. This is one of the great films of our times.and inwards.

B000006OHL|4.0|No credits, no plaudits for the man mentioned in my review title and I'm sure the soundtrack, specifically, and the movie, collectively, lose a significant portion of the overall luster without the gorgeous alto saxophone renderings of Ronnie Lang, whose solo work here over the recurring theme is nothing short of a masterpiece unto itself. Why do so many Hollywood ending credits jump at the chance to give \\"props\\" to the caterer, or the electrician trainee, or the third best boy, as examples, but make no mention whatsoever of the contributions of the stellar musicians, such as Ronnie, and the solid impact they make on the impetus of a given film? Bernard Herrman deservedly gets his \\"props\\", but his \\"aces\\" in the pit really take his score to a higher, more subliminal level.      At any rate, my personal kudos go out to Ronnie and the other soloists and pitmen who flourish in their glorious musical interpretations!

B0029O08WA|5.0|As a fan, I've been eagerly waiting for the soundtrack and finally got my copy today. I am very pleased with this CD. I was a big fan of the Twilight soundtrack, but I can honestly say that I love this as well (maybe more).<br /><br />Compared to the Twilight soundtrack, this is much quieter. With Twilight, it was a bit harder in sound and more fast paced. It fit with the hectic situations of the first novel. This New Moon soundtrack feels more somber and truly embodies the emotions at the center of the story.<br /><br />This is definitely a must-have for fans of the series, or just fans of good  music. But be warned, if you're not into more indie music, chances are that you won't care for this CD. But the indie feel is another part of why I really like this. Plus, I now have quite a few new favorite bands that I wouldn't typically hear on the radio. My personal favorites would be \\"Meet Me On The Equinox\\" \\"Friends\\" \\"Satellite Heart\\" and \\"Shooting The Moon\\".<br /><br />I highly recommend playing this in your car on your way to see the movie in November; it gets you in the mood for the adaptation. But it's also wonderful to listen to while reading the book. Honestly, it doesn't matter what song you land on while reading, because each one is made amazingly well for the subject matter.<br /><br />Oh, and you definitely get your money's worth with this. There are 15 songs and they're all of decent length, so for the $9.99 that you can buy the CD for right now, it's a steal that's sure to please.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I LOVE this show!  I read the entire Sword of Truth Series and while the show does not follow the books to exactly, it does capture the essence of the books and the soul of the characters.  With the exception of a few episodes, it is intense, dark and romantic.  It is so well acted and the cinematography and music are outstanding! There's nothing like it on TV.  Season 2 looks like it will be phenomenal!  Can't wait!!    One complaint on the DVD - why, why, why would you put EDITED versions on the DVD?  One of the most awesome shots from the opening scene is cut as are several lines here and there later in the 1st episode.  If you have to cut for TV - keep the original intact for DVD.  iTunes has full, unedited version.
B002K0WBY6|5.0|Sandra Bullock is a talented actress that is always a pleasure to watch. She can be funny and she can also do good drama. Unfortunately, her film choices have not always been the best. This may not be the case with \\"The Proposal,\\" a charming and feel-good romantic comedy which showcases Bullock's full range.    Bullock is Margaret Tate, a powerful publishing executive, who is feared by her employees. She is tough and doesn't hesitate to fire people when she doesn't get results. Ryan Reynolds is Andrew Paxton, her assistant, who has been at her service long enough to understand and read her every wish well. The order of things drastically change when, one day, she is informed by her superiors that she will be fired because she is an illegal immigrant - she is Canadian -- working in the United States, which makes her eligible for deportation. Being a smart lady, she thinks fast and immediately tells her bosses that Andrew is her boyfriend, and that they are planning to get married. Andrew, who is taken by surprise, reluctantly accepts. Margaret blackmails him by telling him that he will never be promoted to editor if he doesn't marry her. Andrew, of course, is no fool and also takes advantage of the situation. They will end up in Alaska, visiting Andrew's relatives, because oh his grandmother's birthday. Hell will break loose while there, and many surprises will lie ahead.    \\"The Proposal\\" is very entertaining and well-meaning, aided by a supporting cast that includes Mary Steenburgen, Betty White and Craig T. Nelson, as well as Alaska's beautiful scenery. The DVD includes an alternate ending; commentaries by director Anne Fletcher and writer Peter Chiarelli; alternate takes; and more. (USA, 2009, color, 108 min plus additional materials). Reviewed on October 14, 2009 by Eric Gonzalez [...] by Touchstone.    --- On a personal note, I watched the very same movie by coincidence either on Monday 10/12 or Tuesday 10/13, practically around the same timeframe as Eric's.  My wife and I enjoyed the flic, I had a good time with it.

0810994739|1.0|I hesitated before I let my son check this out from the library.  He sees other kids reading it and there was even a big pre-sale/promotion at our school for Kinney's latest book in this series.  Since I was unsure, I made him read it aloud to me before I let him read it on his own.    By the time we were twenty minutes into reading, we heard about \\"butt kissing\\", the word \\"jerk\\" used a few times and \\"screwed up\\".  Now if that weren't bad enough, Kinney (through his main character) was kind enough to teach children how to cheat on exams.  Needless to say, I had a lot of explaining and \\"un-doing\\" to take care of; but not until we closed the book and it went BACK to the library.     I was totally apalled at this material.  Now I have to explain to my second grader (who reads way beyond grade-level) that cheating will get you a fast trip to the principals office and that \\"screwed up\\" and \\"jerk\\" are terms we don't use.  My husband and I are very careful about the language and slang we expose our children to and what they are allowed to use at home.    I am convinced that 99% of parents just see this cartoon-y book that must seem innocuous.  They probably don't even look at it or read it with their kids.  Be warned!  My next letter will be to the author; shame on him and the publisher for printing such material.  Jeff Kinney books are permanently banned from our home and reading lists.
0061914177|5.0|Vaynerchuk has done an extraordinary job \\"crushing\\" his own passions and this book makes his business development philosophy accessible to anyone interested in following his footsteps.<br /><br />The book's main idea is that we need to take our passion, create relevant and engaging content, then patiently construct a brand around ourselves. To that end, we need to be prepared to work hard and put in serious hours; but that's alright, because 20 years ago no amount of hustle could have overcome the bottle necked filter of mass media. Gary persuasively argues that the landscape has changed thanks to ubiquotous and pervasive use of the Web. With social media tools in our bag of tricks, now is the time to deeply pursue our passions (and turn them into a fun career).<br /><br />Like Gary, I have my own set of passions and had already taken some of the steps he suggests; however, I was stagnating and unsure of where to go next. \\"Crush It!\\" has shown me the light.

B000UVT3OI|5.0|I'm not a country music fan, but on a recent airline trip, I heard this album on the Delta system, and loved it. Had to have it. For you to see how far out of the country music scene I am, I'll tell you that I knew of Garth Brooks and that he had a lot of fans, but I didn't know any of his music.  \\"We Shall Be Free\\" sounds like a country/gospel version of the old folk music I love.  Music with a message. I also love \\"The Dance,\\" \\"If Tomorrow Never Comes,\\" and \\"Friends in Low Places.\\"  The DVD that comes with this set is also great.  Some of the numbers are from videos he's made for CMT or something while others are live from concerts or a composite of concerts. As a result of this album, I've started to listen more to country music.
B002KAJ0AO|2.0|This CD is huge step backwards for BSB.  Until this CD, the boys have done a tremendous job of bucking the negative stereotype attributed to boybands, delivering infectious, high quality pop music.  These guys have incredible talent and they wasted it here on bubble gum, same sounding, generic club music.  These are the kinds of songs that cause people to deride boy bands for delivering mass market muscial drivel.  I'm not sure who would like this stuff, but it's definitely not the fans who have followed the Backstreet Boys for the past 15 years.  I'm all in favor of \\"evolving,\\" and understand that musicians often try out a new sound or move in a challenging direction.  This is neither, and I would be amazed if any of the boys really believe that there is anything here that will be remembered for a few days, much less stand the test of time. VERY disppointing.  C'mon guys!
0240810961|5.0|I really enjoy this book, I find it great for beginners. He bashes into your brain the need for gesture and exaggeration. I found it repetitive... and at times some pages were repeated. I like the repetition because he really tattoos on your brain gesture drawing. I had a hard time getting through the 2nd volume... so repetitive. I also enjoyed his spiritual approach, and really shows you that to draw, you must love it with all your being.

Julia Migenes-Johnson's sensual, luxuriant, hedonistic portrayal of Carmen is beyond description; the voices of the Julia, Placido Domingo and the choruses are wonderful; the Andalusian locale provides spectacular visual backdrops.    I cannot imagine a more superior rendition of Bizet's Carmen. [[ASIN:B000022TSV Bizet - Carmen / Maazel, Migenes, Domingo]]

B002BEXG86|5.0|Killer is one of the greatest rock albums of all time(just ask Johnny Rotten)it came out late 1971 and was the fourth album from a band called Alice Cooper.Produced by Bob Ezrin witch was to the band like George Martin was to the Beatles(later he worked with Lou Reed,Peter Gabriel,Kiss,Pink Floyd...).This band made seven albums from 1969 to 1974 and then they broke up and the singer took over the name and went solo.Under my wheels the opening track is a classic rocker and Be my lover the second track is a great hit song.Halo of flies takes your breath away, the guitars(Michael Bruce and Glen Buxton) are stunning,the bass(Dennis Dunaway)is a teaching lesson and the drums(Neal Smith) are like an octopussy is playing them and finally the singing is awesome.Just listen to Alice screaming \\"flies\\"it makes the blood freeze in your vains.Desperado the fourth track is a song about Jim Morrison who was a drinking buddy with Alice a great track.You drive me nervous, track number five is another great rocker with a unique sound and Yeah yeah yeah follows that up.Then comes along Dead babies witch is about child abuse a thrilling song and finally this great album closes with Killer,you should listen to that song in total darkness with a maximum volume on.For any rock fan Killer is a must to have.

B0002OXVDW|5.0|At barely 30, I remember when this came on TV. I was in a foreign city, suppose to be site-seeing, and I couldn't stop watching it. Of course this is well out of my generation, but I do have an interest in nostalgia, and it's such a great glimpse into the past when entertainment was pure, simple, and honest. I highly recommend this, young or old. In fact, I sent it to my grandma to have her watch it first.
B001FB55HQ|2.0|Not as bad as I was expecting it to be but certainly the worst TERMINATOR movie (yet). SALVATION has got the action, the chases and the explosions but one really couldn't care less about the characters, with the women being the very worst (what was the point of bringing Jane Alexander out of retirement for a bland two minute role?). It's good to know though that in the near apocalyptic future the women are still hot and shampoo is available in abundance (Bloodgood) as is makeup (Howard). And for me, the most annoying & recent trend from these movies: in I and II you just knew that if the Terminators got within a hair of their targets they were most likely toast, now in III and specially in IV they get to John Connor often, grab his shirt and throw him into the air while he miraculously lands on a soft surface, unfortunately for Skynet these more recent Terminators seem to be too dumb to figure out this isn't going to get the job done anytime soon. No wonder the sense of excitement has pretty much gone from this series.
B002HRTMHQ|4.0|Having been raised on 60s A.M. radio and also digging indie rock (Guided By Voices, Apples In Stereo, etc.)  Hawthorne's \\"A Strange Arrangement\\" recording is a great combo of what excites me in music:  good songwriting, an indie rock spirit, and great performances caught on record.  It sounds like he was  having a good time recording this CD.  I'm tired of over-produced, slick recordings geared for MTV!  I'm tired of drum looped  \\"songs\\" being \\"written\\" by producers and 5-6 other so called \\"writers\\" (which usually include the star wanting her/his name on the song).   Mayer writes good, catchy melodies, good bass lines with cool beats.  I like his sparse arrangements;  he doesn't need to cover up a badly written song with more and more vocals, beats, gimmicks, etc. Why?  Because every song on this recording is well crafted and can stand on their own. Get this CD if you want to experience an indie dude who embraces the '60s Motown genre.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This is the best show that has come out sence the csi series. Full of action romance and just raw sex being what it is. There is a place for everything family gode and hard everyday living. Something not so good trying to become better. I love the show and have all my family (adults) watching it. We cannot wait for Tuesday night to see our show.
1932907009|5.0|Excuse me while I name drop, but I was referred to read this book by one of Jamie Foxx's good friends, Johnny MF Mac, and I have to say that I have not regretted spending my limited down time to stop and read a few chapters a week. Even though I'm still only at the beginning of the book, when I get time to work on my script ideas, I am able to automatically implement what I've learned from the book to my scripts, and it has helped my easily format and explain my ideas in my head to written form. Its a great book so far. I can't wait to finish it!
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This is just a wonderful story suitable for young and old.  At first thought one may think the story of an elderly man travelling across country USA on a lawnmower (based on a true story) would be a bit dull, but it isn't, it is just so believable, brilliantly acted by Richard Farnsworth, Sissy Spacek and all the supporting cast making it a real treat and a DVD we have watched and rewatched.
0385341008|5.0|I used the book in our monthly book club read, we all Loved the book, Isola was probably our favorite character, Elisabeth such a free spirit and had empathy for all around her. We really thought we had learned something about the Channel Islands and the German occupation during the war, all of us baby boomers, so non of us living during the war.  Great read for all generations.
B00004RFCM|4.0|I was really shocked when I received this IwAS PERFECT ALMOST NEW.  i WAS VERY HAPPY WITH WASY THAT IT LOOK AND VIEW JUST LIKE NEW
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Fringe is one of the best sci-fi shows I have seen in a long time; that is the one of the reasons I have brought the Seasons One dvds. The other reasons for the my purchase are  the main storylines which are so bizarre and yet so day to day that you think it could happen to you; the subplots of the main characters are full of twists and turns that you do not know rather to trust them or run from them. The characters are well delevoped, scripted and acted. But the real reason I brought the dvds is that I have the pleasure of watching the shows over and over again. I can not wait until Season Two DVDs to come out.
B001QOOCTE|4.0|This does not contain the same material as found on the recent PBS presdentation, but still very good piece of work.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|Es una muy buena muestra de lo acontecido en esos maravillosos años de libertad y desenfreno!!  En 4 cds tenés mucha variedad de artistas y de canciones, que te irán llevando a otras que no estan en el compilado, dependiendo de tu curiosidad. Y el precio es adecuado, a pesar de que el cambio de la moneda no favorece a ningún país latino.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Get out and buy this album it's awesome, and for all the critics, of course William Duvall isn't Layne, Layne was one of most gifted vocalist in the world but this album is as close as it will ever come with him being gone. The music is the same, and the vocals come pretty close. Duvall has his own style and is good. I hope they have future plans for more music.
0316067598|5.0|I bought it and read in cover to cover in four days.    The first two chapters are general background and only fair.  Chapters 3-5 get into the detail of becoming a SEAL and training, totally captivating.    The next five chapters detail the actual battle.  Out numbered 50 to 1, the four SEALs hold off for hours, all fighting with multiple gun shot wounds.  The story is completely astonishing.  The last 3rd of the book is the journey of the loan survivor trying to get rescued.  The story borders on incredulity it's so amazing.    The last two chapters make you proud to be an American.  It's the greatest story you'll ever read.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I play this cd daily in my car and when I get out of my car, I bring it into the house.  She is awesome and so true to what her life has gone through.  I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks they cannot come back after a storm!  My favorite is:   \\"Call You Tonight\\".  It speaks to how busy we are even in the face of real love and attraction.  Love it!  Love it!
B002SVBDYQ|5.0|This soundtrack has some incredible songs on it! I had heard the new tracks by The Killers and Thom Yorke, and I loved both of those, so I bought the soundtrack on that basis alone. I was pleasantly surprised by how good all the other songs were as well. Each song carries a certain essence and captures a particular feeling     Overall, I would definitely recommend this soundtrack. \\"A White Demon Love Song\\" by The Killers and \\"Hearing Damage\\" by Thom Yorke are my two favorite songs
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Got this movie in time for Halloween this year. I remember watching this movie when I wasn't supposed to as a kid, but I'm all grown up now and can watch it whenever I want. I recommend this movie to those who've not seen it from the beginning. The real beginning.
B00127RAJY|4.0|It's a tough 20 minutes but worth the  effort. I do it every other day to supplement my swimming workouts. Would like to see her make a 30 minute version. The thing I dislike is that you can't skip her beginning speech which is for first timers to the video. You have to sit through it every time. Hope she changes that in the future.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|First the good things. I give five stars for this season because of Erica Durance´s portrayal of Lois Lane, the best ever, and for the episodes with Zatanna, Maxima and the Legion. Alisson Mack creation of a futuristic Frankenstein bride in the Brainiac episode also deserves five stars. Smallville is the only show where we can see actors playing such legendary characters of DC universe as Maxima, Zatanna and the Legion of Superheroes, so this box is a must for DC fans. I have only words of praise for all the actors who give their best for the show. Smallville should be renamed Metropolis by now because there is no way they could go back to the early days of a teenage superboy at high school. They are in Metropolis now and must leave Smallville behind.  Now the bad. The worst idea was to bring Lana back to make Clark behave as a dumb teenager again. Everytime Lana turns around all Lois heroic efforts to make a real man of Clark are wasted. But you can ignore the four episodes Lana arc and stay with the best ones, about Lois, Clark and the Green Arrow.  And now the ugly, the last one. That was the worst season ending ever and worst that the exploding baby in season four. The Jimmy that wasn´t and the 75 seconds fight with Doomsday should be forgotten. Or erased. That is what Lois should do with that time travel ring. Go back in time and fix things up.  I have the region four edition so no problems with package or sound, everything is fine. And here we get to the bottom line, buy or not buy. If you are a fan of DC Universe or enjoys Erica Durance ultimate Lois Lane this is a must have. But if you want to see the epic confrontation between Superman and Doomsday try the cartoon
B000000WA4|5.0|An amazing album that I can just keep listening to. If I could only own one album from the Smashing Pumpkins this would be it.
B002FOQY04|4.0|I not the type to go record by record...oh what the hell? right?     2. Soundtrack 2 My Life - good lyrically. get to know the artist by him pouring his emotions out in the record    3. Simple As... - fun. could be single? not that fun. But it enjoyable.    4. Solo Dolo - Again, he pours more emotions and feeling of loneliness in the record.     5. Heart of a Lion - Sounded like how \\"Final Countdown\\" sounds, at least the beat. He put a little of his ego into this record    6. My World - more of his ego. but I love it because it seem more painful to prove haters...that you belong. deep?    7. Day N Nite - really? if you don't have your on opinion on this record, I juss have to tell you that it helps to get a record deal...next...    8. Sky Might Fall - I love this one alot because this record shows that he is facing his emotions.    9. Enter Galactic - another fun record...hmm about love and SPACE. that sound fun, huh?    10. Alive - almost how Day N Nite is...umm...    11. CuDi Zone - like My World, but rolled up with Soundtrack 2 My Life    12. Make Her Say - This record is out of place, but its fun. I put it as a fun record but wonder if it could of made it for the sophomore record    13. Pursuit of Happiness - I heard this record before getting the album; this is a positive song for a rapper and it juss shows that sometimes you should do you juss to do you...how you suppose to leave a footprint in your industry if you are like everybody in it. I feel (he feel) that he will not be a carbon copy.    14. Hyyerr - fun record. but...like Day N Nite...juss, let go    15. Up Up and Away - fun record again, but even if its a  another Day N Nite - type of record... its positive    in the deluxe album you get three addition sounds that all together I feel juss...sort of add to the album and a DVD that give you more on Kid Cudi world. And let me say, I am ready to return back to it next year or whenever he release the 2nd album.    Does the songs sound the same? Yes, so I wish the next album will be less \\"introducing Scotty\\" and more \\"welcome to Scotty War.\\"
0060574216|5.0|I have to say that reading this book has brought a new and better understanding for me and my husband. Prior to even reading parts of this book, we honestly lacked complete communication differences of men and women. Of course, the deep love was always there, but there was always misunderstandings. This book has honestly helped us to stay together and become stronger, but it really does take 2 to read.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|Se devo essere sincero, la prima volta cho ho ascoltato questo cd mi sono irritato abbastanza,l'abbandono completo del rock per un genere decisamente pi&ugrave; leggero, mi ha fatto pensare alla fine di questo grande cantante.<br />Invece no! vi sembrer&agrave; incredibile, ma questo scream &egrave; il miglior lavoro di tutta la sua carriera, da ascoltare tutto di un fiato lasciando perdere il suo passato, senza confrontare tutto quello che ha preceduto questo lavoro, e con questo spirito amerete ed ascolterete pi&ugrave; volte Chris cantare questi bellissimi pezzi.
B000QEIOUS|5.0|The quality of my purchase is excellent and I am very pleased to have bought this through Amazon. The delivery was speedy and efficient as well [truth be told I was very anxious to watch it and it exceeded my expectations]!
0764574124|5.0|Finally, a book on VBA that even I can understand.  This one truly starts at the beginning unlike other books, and I tried a couple of them.  Recommend this book first before you use the others, (unless you are not a true beginner).<br /><br />Note:  This is mostly for Office 2000 thru 2003, there is another book for Office 2007.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I bought The Sons of Anarchy Season 1 cd's and they were awesome for the type of movie they represent. Meaning biker, sex,drugs and gangs. The meaning of being true to your gang, family shows through. Jaxs is a whole different breed. He seems to have more compassion than the others. I think since finding S.A.M.C.R.O.W.'s book, he will become a different person all together. Time will tell. Clay and Jemma don't care about other people's lives, other than their own. The rest of the gang just follow along and do as Clay tells them to do. Of course they do always have a vote on everything first but I believe knowing what Clay wants done, that is why they usually always say \\"yeah\\". I love the show and will continue to watch it. Can't wait to purchase Season2.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This is a great show, and Season 2 is even better than Season 1!  Must see!
0385504225|5.0|I've read all of Dan Brown's books. I enjoyed Angels and Demons more than The Da Vinci Code but I think my new favorite is most definitely Lost Symbol. He's facts mixed with fiction makes you believe his story-line. He has a way of putting loose facts together and making cohesive sense out of them. I think he's a great writer! He's style is modern and very well organized. The book has a good flow and there are points where you feel what the characters are going through. This book is worth the money...time! You'll enjoy it!
B002G1X34G|2.0|No where near the energy that is present on Vinland Saga. I might listen to this album once in a while, but Vinland Saga will always get many more listens than Njord. I will say this, it is best looking CD I've seen in a long time.
0385504225|1.0|The book started out with yet another mystery that could easily be solved.  I found myself skipping a majority of the book after I easily discovered the son was the strange man behind all the trouble.  After 100 pages it became nothing more than water cooler gossip. Can you sound smarter than your coworker if you know about the freemason's????  Dan Brown is nothing more than entertainment before you fall asleep on the Airplane.  I find it shocking that so many American's read his work.....yet they also voted for BARRY OBAMA!!!!!!
0385336691|5.0|Lee Child is an Englishman who writes in typical American jargon.  He does on occasions insert a little bit of jolly ole England in the story, but it doesn't distract.  If you read Patterson, Parker, Burke, Brown, etc., then you'll be right at home with Child.  The prose, phrasing, storyline and suspense are just as tense and you really can't figure the ending.  His novels could be categorized as page turners, but they also are extremely engrossing, making you want them to not end.  Hard Way has, to somebody who has had the experience of what's written, a lot of true to life facts, incorpated in the \\"fiction\\" of the novel.  If you're a Lee Child novel reader, you'd be hard pressed to find this or any of his books boring and not worth the effort.  If you haven't read Child, it's was past the time for you to start.
B002OHDRF2|5.0|I dont care what naysayers or even critics who get paid to criticize the film, this IS a worthy sequel. Sure it aint the same without Arnold being there throughout the movie but ever since watching flashbacks of the future war in the previous installments, id say it was about time that someone made a film that shows what happens next after judgement day happend. If you watch closely, you would notice more than one homage to the first two films. From seeing the ruins of observation area where the first terminator arrived in T1, Marcus showing Reese how to handle a shotgun by tying a string to it which Reese did in T1 to help hide his gun in his trenchcoat, to a similar chase scene with a truck & the motor-terminators lookin like the first chace scene in T2, and even John Connor playin ( You Could Be Mine)  by Gun's N Roses to lower a motor-terminator into a trap etc. Anton Yelchin really impressed me as a young Kyle Reese throughout the film just as Sam Worthington played a great cyborg who later finds out he's a pawn to eliminate mankind. Christian Bale pulled off John Connor well himself. As for Moon Bloodgood, Common, & Bryce Dallas Howard i would say it was unfair to discredit them when they didnt get that much screen time. But anyways, if you're a true terminator fan you will enjoy this film. Especially the climax that leaves you wondering what awaits John connor in further battles. Keep in mind that the film takes place in the early years of the war and if you still dont like it, stick to the Terminator: TSCC tv series instead if thats more your taste.
B000MTFFZY|5.0|Just flat out great...high energy, terrific vocals and amazing riffs. Their second album, April Rain, is also terrific. This band has a future!
B000A2RRF4|5.0|So I had always wanted to see Michael live but never got to, and bought the DVD knowing this would be the closest I would ever come to seeing him live.  While Michael's performance is as amazing as you'd imagine, I'm so annoyed by the makers of this DVD because they spent more time filming fans fainting and passing out than they did Michael!  I did not buy the DVD to see all of the fans every two seconds, and was a bit disappointed that the focus of the cameras wans't entirely on Michael so that I would feel like I myself was watching the concert.  Too many camera angles away from Michael during his dance moves to show fans' ugly mugs.  Ugh.
B0029O08WA|4.0|The amount of talent in this soundtrack is ridiculous (especially for such a mediocre teenage movie that will be forgotten - and I'm being nice). I'd like to think these artists were put a gun to their head by Stephenie Meyer herself in order to make them contribute to her vision. But that's my wishful thinking.    Thom Yorke delivers with the hypnotic \\"Hearing Damage\\" - the track is a cross between Depeche Mode and Joy Division vocals. It's catchy and infectious. The gorgeous \\"Slow Life\\"(featuring Victoria Legrand from Beach House) is my favorite song from Grizzly Bear so far. I'm glad they are becoming more famous because they really desire it. Bon Iver & St. Vincent do a bittersweet, folky duet in \\"Roslyn\\" and of course I wouldn't expect less from them. Sea Wolf and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club also contribute nice tracks.  In short, I guess it would be considered a good thing that these Twilight-obsessed tweens are about to be exposed to amazing musicians. But I'm afraid they won't appreciate these talents and will instead cry over the fact that Paramore and Linkin Park aren't on this soundtrack like the last time around. I guess you can't please everyone.
0385504225|5.0|Just as good as \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". Great read that makes you want to devour the book in one sitting. All the twists and turns popular with Dan Brown. In my opinion, the violence could be toned down a little. However, it certainly gets your attention.
B002SVBDYQ|3.0|Some of the tracks are excellent and make this soundtrack worth the price. But I am not impressed. It isn't Supermassive Blackhole or Decode.<br /><br />DCFC is excellent<br />Monsters has promise<br />Muse, excellent as always. Their song really stands out and make the others look like amateurs.<br />The Meadow....absolutely the best. That track alone makes it worth buying.<br /><br />The others, *shrug*. Lots of touchy-feely stuff.<br /><br />And Friends is gag-worthy, horrible.<br /><br />Maybe these cuts will mean more to me later. I don't believe these are good choices for the movie or this soundtrack.<br />Yuck.
0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown- The Lost Symbol-(hardcover)-The title made me want to read the book. Once I started I couldn't put it down Just when I thought I had figured out what was happening it took a turn. Full of suspense,a can't put down book.
B000002UVX|5.0|I just started listening to this album for the millionth time and felt like amazon reviewing that probably   anyone who cares about Hendrix and rock in the 60s should be required to own this album.   Its probably one of the greatest collection of jams ever recorded.  Machine gun is of course the lead track.
1603580557|4.0|I'm fascinated by the premise of the book. As someone who has no formal training in the mechanics of high-level systems oversight I'm convinced that this is a good primer. Thinking in Systems is really more of a Logic 101 in the first half. It could serve as a useful tool for readers who want to be more organized or who want to see the world through a different lens.<br /><br />The book shows how to build a systems map and identify the \\"choke points\\" in a system. Some of the diagrams were a bit muddled from my perspective but overall the book was well organized and informative. It helped me modify my way of seeing problems a little bit. I've since started using a mind mapping tool called Freemind which is changing the way I approach life in ways I never expected.
0375413405|5.0|I bought this for a gift for someone.  I know they will love it!
0385504225|4.0|This is not as good as probably Angels and Demons or the Da Vinci Code but is an improvement from Brown's Deception point and Digtal fortress duo. The storyline is more or less predictable and follows the same pattern as rest of his novels. The clues are easily deciphered even with out extensive knowledge of Freemason history. The clues end up being primary school stuffs and do not force the same kind of reaction as Angels and Demons or Da Vinci Code. The narration is more like a movie script than a book...which is good in one sence but does not provide the thrill the way a book should. Overall a decent timepass read and probably Dan Brown's 3rd best publication by a long way.
B00064AM6C|5.0|By far the best white stripes dvd yet.They jam many songs in a row, and most are from the prime era of white blood cells, elephant, & (self titled).
B002KDUDG6|1.0|MB is arguably the best ballad voice since Sinatra. Yet he sings these songs with no real feelings, and his lack of passion shows also in his choice of songs - never his strongest suit anyway. Very disappointing. Michael, you owe your fans and your gift a better effort. Don't go back into the studio until your heart returns. Perhaps you need some personal struggles to remind you.

0385504225|3.0|The Lost Symbol was similar to other books by Dan Brown with its fast pace and numerous twists and turns.  I was unable, however, to get fully immersed in the story line; partly because I found it less interesting than his other books' plots, and partly becuase it was incredibly far fetched.    As always it was an entertaining read, simply not as riveting as previous efforts.
0385504225|5.0|This book picked up right where Dan left off in the Davinci Code. Once you start, you can't put it down.  A must read for any avid reader.
0385504225|4.0|I always enjoyed the way Dan Brown writes.  The book flowed smoothly and the details mixed with facts are tremendous.  I actually loved the concept of the book and felt the bad guy was one of the darkest he has created.  But the ending left a feeling with me similar to watching a M. Night Shamalan film.  The ending was not quite there.  Still a great read.
B002JM1VJG|3.0|I put it only three stars because of the video quality of the set. But compensates that the full version of EXPRESS YOURSELF was included, not the edited from The Immaculate Collection, that's a really good one.  ¿Why putting in CRAZY FOR YOU and not GAMBLER?
0385504225|3.0|#minor spoilers ahead#    This is a dissapointing book given the long time that passed since the previous installment. It is understood that during this time Dan Brown had to deal with his huge unexpected success, be involved in two movies etc. Still I would have hoped after all this time to see a book a bit more mature and interesting.    Without repeating to much what other reviewers are said, Brown shows again he knows how to keep suspense and draw the user into a shadowy world of unknown history, esoteric trivia and mystery. However at the end all these does not add up into a meaningful message, and the reader is left with a feeling of \\"why did I bother\\".   It seems that Brown lost much of his talent to create real surprise in his plot devices. Many of the plot twists and turns are so expected that they can be detected many chapters before they are actually revealed.    Unlike in DVC which was provocative and critical in its relation to christianity and church, it seems here there has been an effort to remain politically correct and to \\"be OK\\" with everyone, specially with mid-stream America. Except for the lone psychopatic killer, there are no bad guys in this story - Church, Masons, and even the CIA, all are good and noble in their beliefs and intentions. There are no real revelations or criticism with regards to the somewhat mysterious Masons.   The most annoying part is the long ending of the book - after all the plot has been resolved, the good wins and the bad is punished, there comes a very long and boring part where the different characters priech to each other - and specially to the reader - with pseudo-mystical and pseudeo-scientifical arguments the importance of God and Faith, the need to release our internal amazing capabilities, and so on and so forth. This again tries to be compelling both to mid-stream christian America as well as to new-age liberals. This part actually spoiled what could have been a reasonable reading and left me with a bitter after-taste.    Despite everything I still give the book 3 stars since in most part it still provides an interesting and suspensful reading. But it could have been much better.
0307716988|5.0|I have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of this book and it finally came on Wednesday! It is beautiful!  The front and back jacket cover has half of Michael's face on it.  Under the cover of the front of the book is his autograph in gold.  The book itself is in black and red (Michael's favorite colors).  On the inside front and back binding there are color pictures of Michaels belongings and other pictures from his albums and tours.  One of the first several pages has a drawing of Michael's from 1998. Another page has his autograph, which surprizingly looks like he actually signed the book in person with a felt pen! Very creative!      Inside there are many beautiful pictures of Michael, his family and friends throughout his earlier years until the late 80's era.  Some of the color pictures are breath taking. I have never seen some of them before.  There are also pictures in black in white that are nice as well.  I am sorry to take so long to describe what the book looks like but it shows that Michael did put out junk.  I believe that he wanted it to be a bold statement about who he was and the kind of work ethic that he had.  I never saw the original from 1988 but I am sure that it was just as lovely.    Now for the contents of the book!  I am thoroughly enjoying reading about Michael from his prospective and I almost through half the book. I feel as though I am witnessing the happenings around him as he tells it as if I am there with him.  It is very respectful and proper.  I know now where some things about him originated from in the other books I have read.  He even makes a bad experience light hearted and some ways positive. I personally believe you have to look at life that way, the good and the bad, or you will give up. It is not like those other books that sensationalize everything, but he tells the story cleanly.    I have not finished the book yet and I will hate to see it end.  I wish that he had written a sequel later on in his life so that we could see how he was feeling about the way that bad things that were happening to him.  I guess emotionally he could not do it.  It is probably for the best since he could not talk about the legal stuff.    I will keep this in my vast collection of MJ keepsakes because it is a detailed and beautifully presented piece of literature.  If you love MJ, you will not be disapointed.  If you are a hater, looking for dirt and fabrication, then you will be. =)     I urge all of MJ'S fans to PLEASE BUY IT!!  It will not only be a financial boost his estate, but it will also help us to remember the kind and loving soul that he was by experiencing his life in his own words.

I truly love this album. I can identify with everything she has been through and I am so proud of her. I rate this album,if I could 10 STARS.<br /><br />Tammy Jones
0061914177|5.0|Let's just say what Gary talks about in this book works!  I found out about him through some Tweet, and checked out his site, and like what I heard.  I was at the book store and couldn't put the book down, so instead of spending countless hours there and spending more on coffee than the book costs, I bought it.  And let me tell you, it's just the kick in the a** you need!  Everything is clear and to the point.  If you love the internet, web 2.0 and want your life back, this is the book for you.  Enough already... I'm off to CRUSH IT!
B0000025H6|5.0|Id just like to point out to  Alan Caylow, great review, totally wrong information regarding the story behind the making of the epic album/film Pink Floyd's The Wall.  It is actually loosely based on the life of Syd Barrett - co-founder of pink Floyd and the original front man of the group. Syd (real name Roger Barrett) was the man who turned Pink Floyd into one of the Greatest bands and the sudden death of his father when Barrett was 11 is believed to have been at least partly responsible for triggering the mental problems that plagued him as an adult.  In 1965, he introduced a different flair for musical innovation (and the name Pink Floyd) to a group who had mainly been playing covers of Rhythm & Blues songs.  Under Barrett's influence, Pink Floyd began to experiment with a jazz-based psychedelic sound. He used \\"low tech\\" techniques like sliding a cigarette lighter up and down his guitar's fret board to give Pink Floyd a distinctive sound different from any other bands.  As the band's success grew with its first two albums so did Barrett's erratic behaviour. He would wander aimlessly around the stage during live performances, or play just one chord throughout an entire concert. Heavy use of drugs, especially LSD, made his mental instability even worse.  Barrett left/got sacked from Pink Floyd in 1968, just three years after co-founding it and he left the music business altogether, living the rest of his life in near seclusion in his boyhood home in Cambridge, spending his time painting, gardening and avoiding the public eye.  Pink Floyd's 1975 album Wish You Were Here was written and released as a tribute to Barrett.  This is actually a well-known fact and when I read the review I just had to write my own to set the record straight!  The Wall is an amazing album and a brilliant film, but you must understand what is going on or you would be completely baffled!  It is not about education systems, Nazi Germany or even Roger Waters spitting on a fan, it is an insightinto the mind of a man who was extremely talented yet on the brink of madness and I think it was a mixture of these and also the amount of drugs available at the time that sent poor Syd over the edge.  Roger Barrett (Syd) died in July 2006 at the age of 60 of complications caused by diabetes.
0316017922|5.0|Purchased as a gift for my Godson.  He was very pleased with the book - very interesting and informative.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|The vocals on the early records are saturated in reverb. That may be an accurate representation of Martin and Co's original intentions, but I don't much care for it. As wonderful as The Beatles' early work is, the band didn't really hit their stride until the masterpiece Revolver. It's well represented here, but Pepper is the revelation. The sonic improvement is amazing. I can't say enough about it. Mystery Tour is ordinary. On Baby, You're a Rich Man in particular, Lennon's vocals are barely audible. Moving in order, The Beatles is sounding terrific so far. If you have the coin, you can't go wrong.
B002MW50KO|3.0|this album is a most wonderful f.u. jabbed directly into the heart of shallow american christmas consumerism: check out the illustration on the back cover of the cd booklet.  dylan's heart seems to be in this, and there is a sense of both fun and reverence along with a perhaps jaded eye.  interesting how people are over-reacting violently on both sides of the critical fence.  maybe those reactions show people's true christmas spirit.  anyway, happy holidays, mr. dylan, and thanks for the gift.

B002KQ6BT6|1.0|To say that this was a big disappointment is an understatement. This book is weak, meandering and contrived. It is clear that Brown just wanted to make money. The book was boring.It made no sense, was not compelling in any way. I resented the time I spent reading it- hoping that perhaps it would eventually develop into something - it never did.

B001AQTWF2|2.0|I've bought many new cd's, and this one I don;t believe was new, first of all the factory seal was not on it..And the plastic case would not stay shut.  When you look at the burning of the cd, I can tell where it stopped, because I myself burns cds.  The cd works fine,  I don't like the cd at all, because it was not what I thought it would be.  I thought it was a Christian cd, but it's not.  And I would not buy from these people again for not being trueful.  If a item is new, make sure it's new, if it's a copy let a person know it's a copy.  I sell stuff on the Market Place  also, and I'm as honest as I can be.
B000FVNX2Q|3.0|I have used the 12c for 20 years now but was cautious in buying a new one because of reader's feedback (My first one got stolen and it was the best one ever, the second one was made in Malaysia - not bad, keys felt good, the print on the keys was not completely straight, and this one).  In a nutshell, keystrokes have a harder feel and despite the clicking noise, nothing might happen. If I am calculating something, I have to look at the calculator as I don't know if it took the number or not. Also, I now had to make it a habit to calculate everything twice to confirm the results. So RPN (which was developed for speed) has lost its purpose.  The leatherbag is crap. I threw it away. It is really big, bulky and too tight for the calculator. I was afraid it will push on the buttons too much.    Non-responsive keys are the main reason I that I will switch to another calculator.  It's really too bad. The calculator has a great layout, fits in your shirtpocket, and uses less deskspace.    HP used to be a mark for quality, but I guess times change.  The HP12c app for the iphone is great though.
B0000TB014|5.0|I really enjoyed this dvd.  The only problem was Smooth Criminal, I didn't really liked what they did to it.  Smooth Criminal has a lot of his dancing and it looked liked they just fast forward through the whole dance routine.  Why did I rate it a 5, because I just love Michael Jackson.
B002MW50KO|1.0|This CD is indescribably aweful !!! There's really no need to expound upon that. Simply listening to the clips should sufficiently traumatize you. I just... I'd say more, but I have no words to describe it. As I said, INDESCRIBABLY aweful ! It's so bad he's made the baby Jesus cry !
0385504225|4.0|Another good Dan Brown thriller, but a weak ending.  I think he lost it with a 50 page anti-climax of metaphysical ramblings.  The book essentially ended with the dispatch of the antagonist.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|The centrepiece of this album is \\"Time Flies' and it sums up all that I love about PT. I hear Floyd, Tull and a bit of Crim in there, but mostly it's Porcupine Tree. That's why it's so good. Mr Wilson and co. have taken the best of 70's prog and made it both fun and contemporary. It's kept me going through trying times and I'm sure others will find it similarly uplifting. Only Steve Martin's \\"The Crow\\" album has given me as much pleasure as this album this year. I look forward to seeing a live performance.
1572814349|5.0|Wow, this is an amazing deck. A real deck for collection. The images are stunning in its way it relates to the story and symbology of the traditional tarot. Eventhough this deck is very in to the Middle Ages and early Renaissance period, its interpretation of the card meanings are really easy to read. Just beautiful. The quality too is excellent. Well worth investing. Highly Recommended. This deck is really rich in style, substance and symbology.
B002MTTZ5I|2.0|After hearing \\"Death to All But Metal\\" and \\"Fat Girl\\" on satallite radio, I was pretty excited about the release of Feel the Steel. I was expecting something along the lines of the Darkness. Talented rock musicians that can outplay their more serious counterparts while skewering all of the hair metal conventions. Instead you get 9 songs about sex and 2 songs about metal. Although that playlist isn't far from Tenacious D, whom I love, it falls terribly flat.     The guys in Steel Panther are very good musicians, there is no doubt. Each of the songs is played in the style of one of the bads that they have spent years covering. There are sound alikes for \\"Bon Jovi\\", \\"Whitesnake\\", \\"Motley Crue\\", \\"Van Halen\\", \\"Extreme\\" and \\"Poison\\" I put them in quotes becuase they aren't covers, but songs that sound deliberately similiar to those bands, except they are ridculously vulgar. I'd like to say that the songs are clever, but they just aren't. They are pretty funny the first time through, but unlike The Darkness or Tenacious D, there is no reason to listen more than once, you aren't going to miss anything. There are also comparisons to Spinal Tap. Spinal Tap, The D, Dethklok and Darkness all figured out something that Steel Panther completely misses. They write songs that actually can pass for legitimate Rock'N'Roll music. Once you listen more carefully, you here the absurdity of the lyrics, the wit and satire. In Steel Panther, you get 40 minutes of puns for sex acts.     I also have to mention the lyrics. This is perhaps the most vulgar CD I have ever heard, and that's saying a lot. With the exception of \\"Eyes of the Panther\\", there may not be more than 10 seconds in any given song that could be played on air. EVERY SINGLE LINE of the majority of songs is one discription of sex after the next. I was stunned at some of the lyrics and the chorus in \\"Schocker\\" nearly had me in tears the first time through. The problem is that they are so blunt and literal that they quickly losetheir effectiveness.     It's not all bad. The riffs and licks are really good. Satchel's solos are dynamite. Corey Taylor lends his growl to \\"Asian Hooker\\", Justin Hawkins drops in his falsetto and Scott Ian busts some riffs too. Unfortunately, the songs sound so similiar to the bands they cover, that it really comes off more like Wierd Al without licensing permission. There are no songs as epic as \\"Wonderboy\\" or catchy as \\"I believe in a Thing Called Love\\". This is the type of CD you play with your buddies and have a laugh. It's not likely to be something that finds its way into regular rotation.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love this show.  It has great characters, fun stories, and fantastic chemistry.  I can't get enough of Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic's scenes together but the whole cast is really wonderful.  Molly Quinn as Castle's daughter and Susan Sullivan as his mother are really a joy to watch.  This is a show I can't get enough of and on a bad day I pop in my DVDs watch an episode.  It really brightens my mood.  If you haven't seen the show, you really should watch and the DVDs are a great way to catch up on the first season.

B002KDUDG6|5.0|I am a Michael Buble fan. Crazy Love, however, stands out as my favorite Buble CD to date. Buble's inflection and definition of some of the most memorable covers are pure and translate as original in Buble's voice. His rendition of \\"All of Me\\" - up tempo and toe tapping - makes me smile and his interpretation of \\"Crazy Love\\" is mellow and wraps around you. Jazzy, Bluesy, Upbeat, Soulful, Heartfelt... Great mix of songs!
0810994739|5.0|First off, this is not a great work of literature.  If you want something for your kids (or yourself, frankly--I'm nearly 30 and enjoyed it thoroughly) that is education, insightful, meaningful or socially aware, this is not your book.<br /><br />But--it is funny.  Very funny.  If you've been through middle school or suffered as a younger sibling, you'll sympathize and identify with the characters in this book.<br /><br />I picked this one up about a day after finishing the first and was delighted to read that this sequel was even funnier than the first.
B002SVBDYQ|1.0|From the very first song, I knew it was bad. For a minute there i thought i purchased a Grey's Anatomy Soundtrack.  What were they thinking?  The only song worth listening to is the very last one. The Meadow.  When you listen to the Twilight soundtrack you could hear the emotion and it all just clicked.  This is supposed to be Bella's darkest hour, not some Indy outing. very disappointed.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Just read the rest of the 5 star reviews and you'll know why this game is such a great buy.

1601251505|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this book at first, because I liked my D&D 3.5 books, but the revamped character classes, the improved skills set, and simplified combat rules made me give it a chance. I found that my players loved the revamped character class.<br /><br />The paladin is now truly a force to be reckoned with against evil outsiders. They also make it possible to survive without a cleric in the party due to their improved healing prowess.<br /><br />The ranger is now truly a master of his environment with both favored enemies and favored terrain plus he can transfer some of his abilities to party members.<br /><br />Just like in 1st edition, the fighter is only good for doing one thing but wow is she good at it. Between character feats and class feats the fighter now gets a new feat at every level. Plus the fighter has armor and weapon bonuses that make it near impossible for anyone else to have as good a bonus to attack and defense.<br /><br />In my other D&D group I'm playing a druid for the first time and loving it. I've got shape-changing abilities, nature spells, a bonus set of arcane fire spells, plus a bunch of cool feats.<br /><br />As both a player and a DM this book was exactly what I was looking for when D&D 4th edition came out. I didn't want a whole new system, I justed wanted a fun update of 3.5 edition and this book gave me just that.<br /><br />With passing of Gary Gygax and D&D now in the hands of Hasbro I am glad to see a new game on the rise.

B000007U6V|5.0|Legend aside Kraftwerk definately created some of the most unique and certainly the most enduring music of the 70's. One of the main reasons for that is,much as Stevie Wonder did in his musical world made music that was creative and often very beautiful music (yes,even for all Kraftwerk's cold exterior sound) with very primative and difficult instrumentation.The title song of course dominates this album and there's a good reason for that.The melodic theme is irresistable for one,not to mention the fact between two stereo channels the quartet allow for a self created series of vast polyphonic style sounds from what are obviously primative synthesizers only capable of playing one note at a time,mostly seeming to illustrate impressions of various automobile sounds.. But even audiophiles will not likely tune emmediatly into the masterful engineering on this album but rather to the haromonic and melodic delights found within. Most of the rest of the music here follows a similar pattern to the title track and \\"Kometenmelodie 2\\" really showcases another of Kraftwerk's many appealing musical qualities,again one I can liken to Wonder despite the differences in mood and genre. They could take a musical idea that was,as they say all wax and utilize their pre-MIDI electronics,as illustrated by another reviewer and great new rhythms based on basslines and beats. Since this begins what is really a second stage in Kraftwerk where live instrutmentation tended to be shunned,as opposed to the more live sound of their first three recordings it's surprising to here a pretty flute melody,a piano and what sounds like a Japanese Koto harp on \\"Morgenspanziergang\\",which actually repeats one of the melodic ideas from the title song. The great innovative sweep on Kraftwerks music,without which of course all electronica of the last two decades could'nt have existed as such,that began to peak during their [[ASIN:B00000DQSZ Trans-Europe Express]] period really began here. It's definately a key point in 70's music on many different respects,not to mention how rhythm and blues in the 80's would owe much of what it became to Kraftwerk's rhythmic and melodic use of electronics..

B000002VCQ|5.0|i am very familiar with most of the songs on this album. some of them were hugely popular back then. this was the album that made people fall in love with whitney and her voice. it's all filled with great memories and classics. for people who are beginning to like whitney and her music, you should start right here. such bittersweet memories!!!<br /><br />1. \\"You Give Good Love\\"-a[...] love this song. her vocals are so amazing. i could just feel it. it takes me back to those good ole times when i was little. 5/5<br /><br />2. \\"Thinking About You\\"-\\"that's what i wanna do\\". i miss this kind of whitney. she sounded so youthful and vibrant. unfortunately, good things don't last long. 5/5<br /><br />3. \\"Someone for Me\\"-a nice, 80s pop tune....that's all i could say. 5/5<br /><br />4. \\"Saving All My Love for You\\"-this song was HUGE back then. everyone tuned into this song and tried to sing like her. they even got steve urkel singing this song, lol. it's very seductive at best. 5/5<br /><br />5. \\"Nobody Loves Me Like You Do\\"- i don't care too much about this song. it sounds country-like and it's kinda boring. 1/5<br /><br />6. \\"How Will I Know\\"-the only dance song on this album that moves you to your feet. 5/5<br /><br />7. \\"All at Once\\"-i'm not sure if i heard this song before...i probably have but it's a really nice, decent song. they need to have more songs like these. 5/5<br /><br />8.\\"Take Good Care of My Heart\\"-whitney and jermaine sound great together just as they did on \\"if you say my eyes are beautiful\\". it reminds me how music used to sound so great back then. 5/5<br /><br />9.  \\"Greatest Love of All\\"- another HUGE, memorable song. it was an 80s equivalent to Mariah Carey's \\"Hero\\". i remember the kids at my school sang this song one time. it may sound cheesy, but it is really inspirational. it's about believing in yourself. too bad they don't have these kind of songs anymore. 5/5<br /><br />10. \\"Hold Me\\"-i grew up hearing this song but i never realized that this was whitney singing this. i love this duet with her and teddy pendergrass. it's very romantic as roberta flack and peabo bryson's \\"tonight i celebrate my love\\". 5/5ery romantic as roberta flack and peabo bryson's \\"tonight i celebrate my love\\". 5/5

B0019HQIFE|5.0|I used to be a big AUDIO and music junky! i used to round up all kinds of musicals and whip them out in my car, home, headphones etc.  I sort of got busy with life and family and kids and sort of just lost the ear/interest for these things.<br /><br />John Mayer besides being a brilliant and talented musician with heart, produces some of the most amazing acoustic sound and vocals i have heard in a very long long long time!  My first song was \\"Free Falin\\" and that just led me to become an instant John Mayer fan!  besides the technical mumbo jumbo on this blu-ray, its the HEART felth riff  with which John Mayer plays is what really stands out.  This album as a whole is just heart moving and a nice breath of fresh air to any collection,<br /><br />if you are sort of dead tired of all the clutter in your musical collection, get this album!  It will really bring you back to what you think you once had as an ear!  of course the whole HD sound is awesome too! the video looks just terrific on any LCD/Plasma.
B0012Q732O|1.0|Ok. This movie is a real clinker. First, why are they building the damned pyramids in the first place? Second, what is the huge ship for? Then we have the (pre) historical inaccuracies...mammoths and smilodons in Africa? Also, who the hell are these pyramid builders? The inference from the dialogue and the rather modern looking map on the table is that they were supposedly from Atlantis. This whole thing is a mess.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I'm a big fan of history documentaries, having seen Ken Burns' \\"The War\\" series and The History Channel's \\"Battle 360\\".  Produced by Tom Hanks, \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" does a superb job of depicting every aspect of America's space program.  Starting with President Kennedy's bold declaration 1n 1961 to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely, this set covers the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.    Having been born in 1965, I was too young to remember very much of this time in our history, but this collection expertly covers the early space race against the Russians to the heroic landing on the moon in July, 1969.  I can remember gathering around the television with my family to watch Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon.    What makes this set so special is that EVERY aspect of the space program is covered.  From the heroic efforts of the original 7 Mercury astronauts to the first manned spacewalks of the Gemini program and finally to the triumphs and tragedies of Apollo, including the tragedy of Apollo 1 to the triumphant rescue of the men of Apollo 13, this disc is loaded with the highs and lows of the space program.     I especially liked the format of the series.  It was designed more like a mini series than a traditional documentary.  Actors portrayed the key players in the space program, and boy, did they do a fine job!  I easily began identifying with each character in subsequent episodes.  Despite the mini series format, the history of the program was not neglected.  The outer space scenes are truly fantastic to view, and every historical aspect is correct, since NASA participated fully in the making of the series.  The viewer gets a true sense of what it was like to be an astronaut in the 1960s; from the highs of successfully completing a mission, to the lows of families who lost husbands and fathers.    I give this great series my absolute highest recommendation.  Its easy to see why this series garnered so much critical acclaim.  The story is razor-sharp, and the portrayals of personnel is first-rate.  This series is a must-view for people interested in America's early space program.
0312370849|4.0|I love historical fiction. Ever since I read Herman Wouk's The Winds of War and War and Remembrance I've been fascinated by WWII accounts. Sarah's Key is an interesting story about an American journalist, Julia Jarmond, who lives with her husband and daughter in Paris. Her latest project is to look into the Vel D'Hiv incident, which was when Vishy France followed Nazi instructions for French policemen to round up and deport jews in 1942. She finds it difficult to find any information at all because the French are ashamed of having followed Nazi orders.<br /><br />Julia finds her own story and her husband's family to be connected to that of a young girl who was rounded up during the Vel D'Hiv incident; her name was Sarah. De Rosnay punctuates Julia's story with Sarah's experiences. It's interesting and hard to put down. Julia becomes a detective. She is obsessed with learning whatever she possibly can about Sarah. She's a passionate woman. However, by the end of the novel I found myself getting bored.

B000V8A95C|5.0|OK, I'm a 46 year old man that loves musicals.  Any musical really, good and bad.  I started watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer after I watched the musical episode. Rent, Moulin Rouge, Across the Universe, The Wiz, Sound of Music, I could go on and on, so there's my background.<br /><br />I knew very little about Wicked except that it was a Broadway play that was set in the Wizard of Oz universe.  I never had read the novel or seen the play.  I was browsing Mp3s in August 2008 and Amazon had the MP3 album on sale for $5.  I listened to the previews and thought, 5 bucks, it's worth a listen.  I instantly fell in love with the music, I'm talking listening to the album 3 or 4 times a day, which I have NEVER done with any music.  The songs are great individually, but listening to the words you get the entire story of Galinda and Elphaba.  Wonderful story which sheds a new light on these characters you've know since childhood.  My obsession with the album went on for 2 months, REALLY, until I went to see the play in Atlanta, Ga.  Great play, witty and fun, and of course the story was everything I had heard from this album.  The album is the original Broadway cast.  Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel are spectacular talents.  They bring the story to life with their remarkable voices.  I still get an emotional response to many of the lyrics and their delivery.<br /><br />I was listening to my MP3 player on shuffle today, and \\"Popular\\" came up.  The first thing I thought is I have to listen to the whole album again.  That's probably what I'll be doing at lunch tomorrow.<br /><br />If you want to see L. Frank Baum's OZ characters in a way you never though you would, buy and LISTEN to this album.  Go see the play too.  I've never laughed so much during a play, or thought I'd shed a tear for the Wicked Witch of the West.
0743289412|1.0|I've read alot of Stephen King. While he's no John Steinbeck he has written some nice books, but let me tell you this: of all books I've ever read, this is by far the worst. I can't recall having read anything more boring, silly and just plain bad. No, I didn't finish it although I tried. I got halfway. I don't like to start reading a book and not finish it, but with Liseys story I had no choice. It was either that or my sanity.
B002SVBDYQ|4.0|This soundtrack shocked the indie world. Who would have thought this teen pop culture phenomenon was going to have such a strong indie-centric soundtrack. It is a very downbeat soundtrack with moody songs from moody artists (that I personally love) for a moody movie. You can just feel the fear, impatience, longing, an inadequacy in most of the songs, which are primary emotions of adolescence and most vampire fiction.     Highlights for me were Thom Yorke's (Radiohead) song \\"Hearing Damage.\\" Anytime I can hear new material from this guy I'm happy. It has a similar feel to his solo release, Eraser, which I thought was great. When I read about this soundtrack I was REALLY excited about hearing the Bon Iver & St. Vincent collaboration because I'm obsessed with St. Vincent's album Actor. It definitely sounds more like Bon Iver versus Clarke but her haunting voice adds a lot the song. I really like Grizzly Bear's \\"Slow Life. It has their normal haunting feel with unbelievable harmony.     Overall, this is a great soundtrack and since it's geared toward teens it's an awesome opportunity for them to hear from some of the best artists in music today. It does feel a bit like colliding of two worlds since indie fans typically don't like their bands to \\"go mainstream.\\" However, I hope twilight fans grasp the uniqueness of so many great artists being on one soundtrack.
1416594787|5.0|Dawkins is at his best in this book. Every concept is beautifully laid out and written in wonderful prose. Not only does Dawkins explain the evidence of evolution, he proves that it occurred without a doubt. I already believed in evolution prior to reading this book, but was unequipped to properly explain it...until now. Dawkins starts the book by introducing what he calls the \\"history deniers\\", those who deny evolution. Regrettably, this is my only qualm with the book. Immediately he attacks those who don't accept evolution as fact, but then goes on to say that he wants to educate those who may not accept evolution. Seems to me that it you want to persuade somebody of your position the best thing to do is not attack them. Other than this minor detail, everything else in the book is wonderful. Dawkins starts off by discussing domestication and artificial selection to \\"soften up\\" the reader for natural selection and finally the meat of the book, the evidence of evolution. Dawkins takes on the dating methods and breaks down the process so that anyone can comprehend it. Further, I was able to disprove an article given to me by a creationist friend that said radiometric dating is unreliable because a rock that was only 20 years old was dated at 330,000 years using potasium-40 dating. Based on what I learned from Dawkins I was able to explain the margin of error relative to the half life of the potasium-40 and that the dating method used was not the proper method for a rock that new (old). Anyway, Dawkins discusses the fossil evidence, which is vast, then moves on to the genetic evidence and geological evidence. The genetic evidence is, in my opinion, the most powerful. Not only does all this prove evolution true, but anyone who reads this and is still skeptical is obviously stuck in religious dogma. Overall, great book and I highly recommend it!

B001NZ70G8|5.0|I own this album on vinyl, cassette, CD, and now as a remastered download....and I would buy it 20 more times, and still not feel I paid too much.  \\"My One and Only Love\\" is the most perfect jazz ballard every recorded - and the rest, with Trane and Johnny bouncing back and forth with such skill and ease, and McCoy Tyner just sprinkling brilliance around the outside.  This is perfection on a par that can never and will never be matched.    The greatest jazz disc in my collection - and that is saying a lot, since there are about 15,000 jazz discs in it.  Brilliant!!

0385504225|2.0|In his earlier Da Vinci and Demons novels, Dan Brown's disdain for religion, Christianity in particular, at least motivated him to a good yarn with genuinely creepy villains operating from organized systems threatened by secret truth.  \\"Lost Symbol\\" ends up with a 10 chapter apology for new age optimism about the value of truth, even though the book's main threat to world civilization is that a few important people might get embarrassed by having the truth revealed.  It's shabby work, full of cardinal violations of a good thriller -- many of the clues are just downright false.  The author intentionally leads the reader away from accurate suspicion, ending with a \\"gotcha\\" that holds up only because the clues along the way turn out to be fraudulent.    At least the animosity of Brown to the Roman Catholic Church made for good antagonists.  Here the antagonists are all parties Brown will defend in the end, and his ability to put real vitriol into their actions isn't there.  Imagine Jason Bourne singing Kum Ba Yah with the CIA chiefs at the end of the trilogy and you get the confusion that Brown is at the heart of Brown's poor effort in this novel.    There was a point where Robert Langdon could have died.  Brown should have taken the risk and ended this series with something worth remembering.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Wow! Just when you thought the 1st season was tops, the 2nd season of TBBT is hugely funny. The almost impossible mix of nuance and outrageous comedy are synthesized to prompt great hilarity from the academics, children, and the simple-minded. This is a set to not just buy, but to keep.
B002K0WBXW|3.0|I love Sandra Bullock.  I love Betty White.  I love Craig T. Nelson (go Coach!).  Mary Steenburgen was great.  But this movie was totally a recycled storyline from about 3 movies, 2 of which Sandra Bullock starred in.<br /><br />Margaret (Bullock) is an uptight, high powered, book excecutive who terrorizes her co-workers and subordinates.  Andrew (Reynolds) is the long suffering Assistant that has tolerated her manic ways for three years in hopes of a promotion.  She is a Canadian on an expired Visa and will be deported.  HEY, LETS MARRY MY ASSISTANT and stay in the country.  Andrew agrees on the condition that he gets the promotion he has been working for so hard.  All agreed they head to Alaska to visit his family and try to trick the I.N.S.<br /><br />After 3 days they connect, she is moved by his family, especially since she has none.  They continue on with the wedding where certain events transpire that SURPRISE proves Margaret loves Andrew.<br /><br />I wanted to love this film.  I wanted to see Sandra Bullock at her comedic best, again.  But I was left with the impression of seeing this movie before, except in the form of Green Card, Two Weeks Notice, and While You Were Sleeping (one of my all time favorite movies!!!!).<br /><br />Green Card (self explanatory), Two Weeks Notice (Margaret is the same uptight character that is obsessed with work) and While You Were Sleeping (Margaret is Lucy, an orphan that convinces a family she is the fiance of an injured son she helped rescue. She is moved by a family she wishes she had)l.<br /><br />There are funny parts, Betty White is great.  But Reynolds (cutie) and Bullock don't seem to have long enough scenes to really progress their relationship.  Right when their banter is getting good and the timing is gelling, it ends.<br /><br />I wish they could get Bullock some good material, because she is a talented comedic actress and I have missed her in good films.  But this was just not a good pairing.<br /><br />Two Weeks Notice is a good film and Bullock and Hugh Grant have good chemistry.  While You Were Sleeping is hilarious and has a great cast along with a great script.  Reynolds is funny, but the chemistry between these two is just not there.  The end credits prove this since they are shown solo and it is genuinely funny and they shine, but together its a no go.<br /><br />Too bad, since the talent was there.  Ramone was the funniest character in the movie!!!!!good chemistry.  While You Were Sleeping is hilarious and has a great cast along with a great script.  Reynolds is funny, but the chemistry between these two is just not there.  The end credits prove this since they are shown solo and it is genuinely funny and they shine, but together its a no go.    Too bad, since the talent was there.  Ramone was the funniest character in the movie!!!!!

B001FB4VXU|5.0|I am a physicist and my wife is not and we BOTH love this show! There is humor in it for just about everyone, except maybe little kids because there is me sexual content in it.
0810983915|2.0|Forgive me for saying this, because I thought the other \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" books were really funny, but this one lacks the spark of hilarity that brought the others to life.    I think a few factors contributed to this:  the series is no longer new and original; some of the humor was more ick than ha-ha (like the hairy men in the swimming pool locker room scenes); and with summer vacation there weren't any school scenes to play off of.  So the book drags on just like Greg's aimless days of playing video games and watching TV with the shades drawn.  Greg's falling out with Rowley is ho-hum, and his family's repeatedly-thwarted attempts at summer fun are also not particularly funny. The characters are bored most of the time, and so was I.      Part of the humor in the previous books was seeing situations through Greg's eyes in which he thought he was being a great guy when he was actually being a jerk.  Maybe it was the choice of situations in this book, or maybe Greg is just getting too old to get away with that any more, but here he generally came across as an insensitive dolt.    The best part of this book was the recurring \\"muddy hand\\" from the horror film that Greg worried was out to claim him as the next victim.  The hand's appearance up in a dream sequence was one of the only laugh-out-loud moments for me.    So honestly, this book didn't live up to the series reputation for me, but ten-year olds will probably love it anyway.

0385504225|5.0|Like many of us, I waited a long time for this new work by Mr. Brown.  I have often had expectations that the author could not live up to, when I waited so long.  That was not the case with this newest book.  It was every bit as engaging as any of the others and in my view, only Angels and Demons was as good and perhaps better.  I could not put it down.      I will be ready for his next effort, whenever it comes.
1592402690|5.0|Okay, so this book may not be for everybody. But for anyone that has an interest in the tremendous recording innovations that went on behind closed doors during the Beatles' standard-shattering history, this book is fascinating!    Geoff Emerick got amazingly lucky to be witness to the Beatles' first EMI recording session. Then he was called on to assist many times while Norman Smith did an excellent job of engineering the Beatles' recordings up until Revolver. When Geoff Emerick took over Norman's position, however, the time was ripe for rules to be broken in the name of exponential progress, and Geoff was the perfect creative-thinker for the job! (As a side note, I feel frustration and sadness that he, and other top-notch sound engineers, don't get the recognition--or the pay--that I think they deserve. At least he was recognized with a couple Grammys for his efforts. And I'm very happy that he, with help of course, got this book out... it certainly shows just how huge a contribution someone like him makes to the whole process.)    Geoff does venture off into personal conjecture numerous times, guessing at why certain Beatles or other personalities may have done this or that, but I view that as him just expressing the kinds of questions most of us would wonder... and, like him, we would probably also be left still wondering. Be that as it may, I found lots of his personal recollections to be thoroughly engaging, adding his own personality and color to the grand scheme of things, which is entirely appropriate since he was an important part of the whole thing.    Personally, I don't think he overdid the technical talk, but then I'm into that kind of stuff. Fans who know and care nothing about the recording process would probably be bored stiff. If you, however, are curious just how they made that magic... how they got all those amazing, complex mixes... especially being mostly on *4-track* machines (!!!)... I mean, even considering the use of bouncing tracks... wow!I found it to be a really great read, filled with fabulous details of not only recording stuff, but also lots about the wild and crazy times that were the late 1960s. I could feel like I was almost there at many of their most historic recording sessions. What a gift!
B002SVBDYQ|3.0|Who said the film had to be limited to an Indie Rock soundtrack?  I feel they are losing appeal to a lot of listeners out there for limiting the song selection so badly, especially after they did such an amazing job with the Twilight soundtrack!  I enjoy this music style and don't dislike the album but there are one or two selections that are just awful and don't go with how I envisioned the movie at all. Overall it is a disappointment for me, but to each his own!  I still thoroughly support Stephenie and the movies!

B0029LHW4U|3.0|As anyone who's casually following the band is aware, Alice in Chains' original singer Layne Staley died of a drug overdose in 2002, and this is the band's attempt to regroup and begin recording again.  This isn't necessarily a bad idea.  Although Staley was unquestionably the frontman of the group and a major artistic contributor, guitarist Jerry Cantrell was always the driving musical force of the band, so his decision to reform the group was understandable, especially considering how ignored his respectable solo efforts have been this decade.  Cantrell thankfully got all the non-Staley members of the group to sign onto the project-- giving this album more a sense of legitimacy than the Smashing Pumpkins \\"reunions,\\" which are little more than glorified Billy Corgan solo projects-- and hired a new singer, William DuVall, to succeed Staley (\\"replace\\" would be a bad word, since Staley was irreplaceable).    So with all that background, how then is this album?  It's difficult for me to say.  I've been an AIC fan since I first got into popular music in the late 1990's, and Staley basically WAS the group to me for a long time.  For better or worse, Staley's struggles with heroin addiction pretty much became the story of all the band's albums, coming to dominate the lyrics even when Cantrell was writing them.  Thus, to hear a new Alice in Chains album after all these years is both exciting and distressing.  There definitely is a sense of urgency missing from this album's lyrics, which for the large part are pretty standard metal lyrics; there's little of that compelling drama that made most of Staley's songs so memorable.  Truth be told, DuVall is part of the problem.  He seems like a perfectly capable vocalist/guitarist, but he sounds a little too much like Staley for comfort (think Gary Cherone trying to impersonate Sammy Hagar on \\"Van Halen III\\").  I think this album would have been better served had Cantrell allowed DuVall to expand his vocal range more and stop trying to recapture the famous Staley/Cantrell vocal harmonies.    As for individual tracks, \\"All Secrets Known\\" is a pretty rousing opener that does give off a regeneration vibe.  \\"Check My Brain\\" is silly but is undeniably catchy.  \\"Your Decision\\" doesn't quite reach \\"Jar of Flies\\"-like transcendence, but is at least as good as the ballads found on \\"Sap.\\"  \\"Lesson Learned\\" and \\"Private Hell\\" are good tracks that energize the album's second half.  Weak spots?  I definitely could have done without tracks like \\"Last of My Kind,\\" which sound closer to AIC-knockoffs Staind and Godsmack than the real thing.    I think that \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" is a decent AIC album which will perhaps grow on me, as did their self-titled 1995 album.  AIC fans should definitely not blow it off just because Staley's absent, but then again his missing presence definitely hangs over this album.  If the band wants to rise again, they will have to cut loose from their past a bit and see where a new direction takes them.

B0029O08WA|5.0|When I woke this morning, the first thing I did was download this soundtrack from iTunes.  It was $15.99 there, so it's clearly cheaper to order the Amazon version (I'm not sure if the bonus tracks are included or not).  The New Moon soundtrack is stocked with a slew of brilliant music, most of which has an indie feel.  I was a bit pretentious about the OK Go track, but I can honestly say I'm quite impressed by the album as a whole.    The New Moon soundtrack seems to evolve from the deep, dark melancholy that Bella dwells in until the last several songs of the album, upon which time the tracks become more upbeat and \\"fun.\\"  This is a wonderful effect!  It's like a journey, which is entirely what New Moon is.  Anyone who is a fan of the Twilight Saga will be able to listen to this and identify with almost every song, and those that aren't will definitely be able to appreciate the musical genius of these artists.

B0029O08WA|1.0|I am VERY disappointed with this CD. The song selection, as well as the singers on this soundtrack, do absolutely nothing for me, with the ONLY exception being \\"Meet Me On The Equinox.\\"     My family and I LOVED the Twilight soundtrack (and we are all HUGE fans of the Twilight series books), so we were all anxiously awaiting the release of the New Moon soundtrack. Now I feel like someone owes me $10 for having to listen to this junk!    The biggest questions I have for the producers of this album are: \\"Where in the heck is Paramore?!?\\" And, \\"Did Stephanie Meyers have ANY input on this album?\\" Based on what I've seen from her Website, this doesn't seem like music she would like, either.    Hopefully the movie won't disappoint me as much as the soundtrack has...
B002GU5V24|1.0|Full marks for the music, no stars for the box. The lack of video is inexcusable - even if some of it is individually available on DVD. I can see no real justification for this box set except to rip people off. Yes, the sound quality is a marked improvement over previous botched CDs, there's some 5.1 which is of extremely marginal interest, and we get an unreleased live show - at a silly price. It's a sad ending to what started as a glorious reissue program. The Gabriel box was superb, the next two mostly so (the music got weaker as the years advanced), but why on earth couldn't they have put in the videos of the live materials in this box?    Since I am standing on my soap box, I can't also understand why the previous boxes were issued as hybrid CD/SACD in Europe but not in the US. The mind boggles at the incomprehensibility of some of these decisions.

0385504225|3.0|This book is 509 pages. For me, it got interesting around page 492. That's when the tease made on Noetics and the Global Consciousness Project in the beginning of the book was fulfilled...somewhat.<br /><br />Okay, in the interest of full disclosure - I'm not a Dan Brown fan. I think the Da Vinci Code remains his best. I hated \\"Angels And Demons\\" primarily because of the implausibility of parts of the story (i.e. a tarp held at the corners serving as a parachute....c'mon!...and don't *even get me started on antimatter). He did not commit any such obvious errors with the Laws of Physics in this book. But, he didn't develop his villain until Chapter 57 starting on page 221. Up until then, he had the air of a badly drawn cartoon character. But his worst crime occurs at the opening of Chapter 94 on page 351, an extremely implausible plot twist (which I won't reveal here) without which the entire rest of the story couldn't have taken place. So, from page 351 on, I find myself saying, \\"No way...THAT couldn't have happened without [the events of page 351] happening...sheesh!\\"<br /><br />But like I said, Brown made good on his early tease. And as I closed the book I realized that Dan Brown is a deeply flawed writer with a great nose for suspense, who finds himself on a deep spiritual quest, working his realizations into his novels; a writer whose realizations are uncannily in step with the zeitgeist of our culture and times.<br /><br />In the Da Vinci Code, he made people question the history of Christianity. In the pages of The Lost Symbol after page 492, he will make people question their own nature as well as that which they call 'God.'<br /><br />For obvious reasons, I was happy to see him give a nod to the Gnostics...But perhaps my biggest criticism is in comparison to The Da Vinci Code. In the Da Vinci Code, he used the vehicle of the story to further his theme about the history of Christianity. In The Lost Symbol, you had a suspense story which dealt heavily with the history and symbolism of the Masons but which seemed, to me, largely divorced from the points he discusses from page 492 on. So, while there was a cohesiveness between story and theme in The Da Vinci Code, that cohesiveness is lacking in The Lost Symbol.<br /><br />These opinions are wholly and strictly my own. I'm fully aware that most people will just love the story right up to page 492, after which most will say, \\"What is THAT all about??? Good book, but I don't know about that ending.\\"<br /><br />Your mileage may vary. Happy reading!sons but which seemed, to me, largely divorced from the points he discusses from page 492 on.

B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I've read other of Mr. Brown's books and found them to be entertaining and page-turning.  Good summer reading.    This outing, however, fell flat in so many ways.  It was predictable, there was little tension/suspense, Langdon appears unbelievably stupid (as in \\"How can anyone with his reputation be so stupid?\\"), glaring plot inconsistencies, and all told in a hum-drum kind of way.    The constant hammering of Christian/Masonic ideals becomes dull and, in no way, explains or forgives the action in the book.  It's simply \\"this book needs a message\\" hook on which to hang the rest of the tale.  It does nothing to explain motive for the antagonist and, really, isn't at the root of his motivation.    The cliffhanger \\"beat the clock\\" devices were really neither - and any nine-year-old with a computer could have told the author so.    Many of the \\"saves\\" felt unbelievably contrived.  An immersion tank?  One that uses a fluid that allows the person to continue breathing?  And the antagonist (who didn't want Langdon to live)  didn't know that?  After using it repeatedly?      The final reveal felt like a complete sell-out that was tacked on because of a deadline.    Overall, the book felt more like a story sketched out one weekend with a few details thrown in after lunch with the publisher.    While in previous books, like \\"The DaVinci Code\\", you could turn the final page and feel that you'd enjoyed a well-told story, that was not the case here.  In fact, I resented having paid $9.99 for the Kindle version.  It just wasn't worth it.
044024367X|5.0|I can't believe most of the people  who reviewed this book actually read it. it would be hard for me to do this  book justice without  spoiling it for the rest of you but I will say it is excellent and typical of Child and I stayed up  til 2 A.M. as I could not put it down. Action is only part of what Child does well.  One really needs to think about his main character and what forces shape him and how others react to him .Jack Reacher is  more of a Rorshach test than a fictional character in some ways. People who don't like him are  probably the same folks who don't like cats... I have no use whatsoever for folks who don't like cats or Lee Child. I think some people come on Amazon and bash books to satisfy a jealousy they have of best-sellong authors or merely to get attention. The Reacher character is a Jungian archtype ;i.e. the wandering knight, and Child does him justice and a mytho-poetic way that most authors have no hope of ever achieving. Failure to appreciate this book shows a shallowness that one should hesitate to exhibit in a public forum.
0385504225|2.0|Having read two of Dan Brown's books, I was excited for this new one.  However, I am completely disappointed.  It reads just like his other books but he's created a \\"formula\\" for writing.  Nothing new in The Lost Symbol--same characters, twists, and turns.  The plot is way too predictable.

B0027HBAB2|5.0|Ok. I like Regina Spektor. I said it. I decided to diversify up my collection a little bit, and had heard this chicky on the radio once or twice and figured she was alright...wanted some smooth subtle music for my turntable, to play when entertaining company and whatnot... The album however is infectious, and I am a little bit suprised how easy it is to get into on a whole.<br /><br />From what I've read this is her most pop heavy production yet (there must be at least five songs here currently on the radio...)  While some reviews are shunning on the production, declaring it robs the feeling of her raw past records... I can't agree. The production here is extremely well done, giving a strong punch to the tone and attitiude that comes from her songs. ...Sure I may have to look later for the raw grit that is promised in her Soviet Kitsch album... but just to get a sense of style, I'm digging fine on this one.<br /><br />The music is expressive and catchy, and she crafts a poem in every song. Not poems for poetry lovers... I'm not a poetry lover. I like words that pop in the brain like firecrackers. There is an ironic sadness that often times puts you on the spot.And yet somehow the whole album remains joyful, but never sappy or contrived. Its Good stuff... it's good to see that this one crawled out from the raw side of the music biz, and has infiltrated the pop side. I hope to see more good things...
B002O1TMI4|2.0|... and not bought this album. Here Bellamy et al. forcefully tried to create something *new* (many other great bands have taken that route before and failed).  The product are two acceptable songs, namely \\"Uprising\\" and \\"Unnatural Selection\\". The rest of the album is in the borderline-embarrassing category. Do Bellamy et al. really have the aptitude to write a \\"Symphony\\"? If it's not a symphony, then why call it that? The name of the song \\"United States of Eurasia\\" alone is at least as cringe inducing as the song itself, which sounds like a microwaved version of a Queen song (sorry Freddy!). And \\"Undisclosed Desires\\" sounds like it was written by Savage Garden, if anyone happens to remember what they sounded like. Could they not simply have made another good Muse album?
B0025KVLUQ|3.0|I bought the Abbey Road and Let It Be Remastered albums and compared them with the older albums. In the car not really sure if I noticed a difference. Come Together actually sounded better before imo. The bass is too ridiculously loud now. I skimmed through the entire album. Who knows maybe I need to listen more closely??? With the earbuds, I only noticed subtle differences...mainly the remastered versions being louder. That's it. If you own their last 2-3 older albums on CD, don't bother buying the remastered versions.

141654917X|5.0|What if you had a sister with leukemia, and you were her donor?  In the novel My Sister's keeper thirteen year old Anna Fitzgerald and sixteen year old Kate Fitzgerald had  a strong relationship, besides average sibling rivalries (fighting over the T.V remote, arguing over makeup etc.).  The novel is about Anna and Kate.  Kate has leukemia. It explains Kate's life with leukemia, Anna's life as a donor,  and the struggles they went through.  I think this is a five star book.  It will keep you wanting more.  There are a lot of tear grabbing points in this book, which makes it so active. I chose to read this book because it looked like a great book, I also was inspired by a classmate who recommended the book.  I do not regret reading the book, I do not think it was a waste of time at all.  Rom TP 3/4
B002I9Z8B2|5.0|I didn't know this movie would look so good considering how old it is, however, since it was filmed in a format that has higher resolution than 1080, it only makes sense.  All the action scenes looks really sharp.  The whole movie looks great.    I thoroughly enjoy the extras, especially James Horner's explanation of his approach.  It was basic, and to the point, but I'm glad I got to see him explain it from his artistic point of view.    I don't really understand why someone would give this product 1 star for it being what it is not, the directors cut.  That's just stupid.  It is what it is, and it's excellent.

As background, I can tell you that I am in the late 70's listened a lot of Philip Glass, and then even Einstein On The Beach and took note of the theme, which of course there is doom the novel On the Beach by Nevil Shute.  Koyaanisqatsi is a powerful but in many respects confusing history the destruction of which man becomes too great for himself and threatens to destroy the world in its zeal for efficiency.  Powerful scenes and superb music offering this movie on.

B00005MM01|5.0|I bought these wonderful records originally, back in,I think,1971 as two separate vinyl LP's, titled 'Wear Your Love Like Heaven' and 'For Little Ones', and was overjoyed when I saw them available on one CD, the way they were first presented, boxed, just like a Gift. I've cherished them and tried to preserve them , but, as we all know, vinyl tends to be impermanent. However, the music and poetry transcends time; bridging the space between the pureland of infancy and the worldly wisdom of the 'grown-ups'. I'm yet to hear \\"HMS.Dono.\\", but I know I'll love that one as well. Truly inspired, warm, happy and joyfilled, songs of love and innocence, the sand and sea, shells and lullabys ...timeless and beautiful.
B002AGIEYG|5.0|When I was in Berlin this last fall, I had the great luck to be able to hear Sir Simon Rattle conduct the third and fourth symphonies.  It was an electrifying experience just to be in the Philharmonie and hear the Berliner Philharmoniker, but there was something very special about these performances.  There is a certain energy and precision about Mr. Rattle's reading of the symphonies.  So much shaping of volume and phrasing.    I am an immense fan of Brahms, though I don't claim to be an expert.  But I walked away from that performance deeply moved by the emotional depth of those two symphonies.      Having heard them again on this recording has not changed my mind: they are so expertly played, that it would be hard to be challenged.  Indeed, there is no orchestra in my estimation that can match the Berliners.  And amongst conductors, Mr. Rattle is only eclipsed by Karajan.  I consider Herr Karajan's 1970 cycle of the Brahms to be the gold-standard.  But that is not to say that Mr. Rattle doesn't do things very well, or give new insights into the symphonies.  There are moments of such youthful exuberance, purely vibrant, and thrilling!    If you are really only keen on owning one recording of the Brahms symphonies, then I would recommend either the 1980 or the 1970 cycle from Karajan.  But this recording isn't far behind.
B002FOQXZK|5.0|First let me say I am not a fan of hip-hop/rap of any kind, but Kid Cudi's \\"Man on the Moon\\" changed my way of thought. Being 18 you'd think I love hip-hop, but I don't. And trying to be a little more open I listened to some samples of this album on iTunes and I was blown away. This is not mainstream rap, and that's good. Remember Kanye's first album when it was real and meant something? Well I think this album falls under that category of \\"meaningful rap\\". There is not a slew of songs about his money, women, and extravagant things he owns. His only song about to fulfill his ego is TGIF (Thank God I'm Fresh) which I still like a lot. I would recommend buying the extended version off of iTunes (if possible) because it has extra tracks and very amusing videos him and his friends made, such as them trying to golf and failing, for only a couple dollars more. Overall the album is perfect. His voice is great, the beats are original and do not mimic each other, and I'm now addicted to Kid Cudi for life.
0515142247|3.0|Die Trying by Lee Child is the second in his Jack Reacher series.  While not quite as good as book number one, The Killing Floor, Die Trying was still an entertaining audiobook for a very long car-ride.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is a former military policeman who finds himself roaming the country.  Spending his childhood as a military brat, and most of his adult life in the Army, he has seen little of the US.  He walks by a dry cleaners in Chicago and sees a young woman, Molly Johnson, struggling with a pile of laundry while using a crutch.  The ever-chivalrous Reacher grabs her laundry and before he even knows what is happening, both of them are kidnapped.  It turns out that not only is Johnson an FBI agent, but she has connections in high government circles.  The kidnappers are a group of militia who plan on using her as leverage for a new, break-away country in Montana.  Both of them are trying to keep themselves alive, while the FBI frantically searches the country for one of their own.  And while FBI agents are loyal to a fault, at least one of them is giving information to the enemy.  How Die Trying plays out will have you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />On the plus side, this book may have been published in 1998 but it couldn't be more timely in 2009.  The news today is filled with many stories of Americans forming militias, stock-piling ammunition and talking about seceding from the US.  Much of their hate-filled agenda is very frightening.  On the negative side, there was way too much description!  I got tired of hearing Child depict such information as every little step from a bullet being fired from a gun until it reaches its target.  This type of filler took pages and pages (or minutes and minutes) and got boring after awhile.<br /><br />But overall, my husband and I enjoyed Die Trying.  We especially like the reader, award-winner Dick Hill.  We have already ordered book three, Tripwire, for our next trip.

0385040253|5.0|It's hard to be able to say how influential this book is as it's cited in almost every knotting book since it was first published in 1944. The current edition is knot the same as the 1944 one. It has been updated to correct a few inaccuracies by Mr. Budworth of the International Guild of Knot Tyers. I've own both editions and treasure them both. However Amazon.com appears to be selling the current in print one as the 1944 edition. The easiest way to tell the difference is to turn to the title page and look for the updated message Mr. Budworth inserted there after he update the book with the help of Ashley's daughter. I'd be a little upset if I ordered this expensive book expecting the old 1944 edition and received the new one and vice versa. This book rocks and is the best book on the subject of knot tying.
0739319175|5.0|Dan Brown does it again!  Another well researched and intricately woven yarn that beats all expectations.  He always has a surprising twist at the end of all his stories and this one is no exception.  He has cleared up so many derogitory myths about Free Masonry that it was quite refreshing.  Next rainy day in your neighborhood... grab that hot cocoa, blanket and enjoy a great read.
0756603749|5.0|This is an excellent book. It's small 100ish knots and pocket size make it extremely portable. This is in contrast to another great knotting tome such as, Clifford Ashley's \\"Ashley Book of Knots\\" which is the definitive work on the subject. Which is large and heavy and very expensive. This book is a great value being in full color and it's jam packed with info for each knot. I particularly like the section on whippings that includes sewing palms. I've been a teacher of knots to scouts know for over twenty years and this is what I'd recommend to a young tenderfoot or second class scout if he was interested in learning more than the 10 required knots for 1st class rank.

This story is about a girl whose family was gruesomely murdered when she was seven.  Her brother was convicted of the crime and is in prison but a club is wanting to prove he didn't do it.  She sells mementos to club members of the murder victims.  It took me forever to read this book.  It had an interesting premise but fell short of my expectations.
0061914177|5.0|I ordered the new book by Gary Vaynerchuk, \\"Crush It: Why NOW is the Time to Cash In on Your Passions\\" and was captivated at page 1. I can't remember the last time when I sat down and read a book from cover to cover in one sitting.<br /><br />Personal branding is all about finding out what is unique about you that sets you apart from your competition. Part of the personal branding process is finding out your values, your passions, your vision, and your purpose. Gary tells his family's story of how they came to the U.S. and the hardships they faced when they arrived. It is truly an inspirational rags to riches story and explains how social media made such a huge impact on the business.<br /><br />Gary (@garyvee on Twitter) is so passionate about the wine business and created [...]. He discusses wine in layman's terms and stays true to his brand. He said that he probably loses 12% of his audience that watches his show for the first time because he is so excited and shouts. If you've ever watched him in action, you can't help but to be as passionate about what he discusses. His book reads much the same way-passion, excitement, engaging, and a real page turner! I could almost hear him reading the book as I read it last night.<br /><br />If you want to understand the importance of passion in developing your personal brand and how social media can play such a large part in getting you recognition for what makes you and your product / services unique, then this is a MUST read for you. Make sure you have about 3-4 hours set aside because I promise you won't want to put this book down!

B000Q67876|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered the Shawshank Redemption on Blu. It was my third, having already enjoyed the VHS and the DVD. It's one of my favorite movies, the all-time 'guy movie' (but all genders should love it), a show of friendship, loyalty, love of freedom and, above all, love of life in freedom. And who could tell a story better than Stephen King, the number one story-teller in residence? And who else practically exhales humanity if not Morgan Freedman as Red Redding? Add Tim Robins as the mysterious and never tired of living Andy Dufresne and it's a movie that at least I keep watching over and over again. I've already watched the Blu edition twice after having watched the DVD and the VHS who knows how many more times.<br /><br />But I won't be reviewing the movie or the script - it's been done thousands of times already by others, much better qualified. I only want to discuss this most impressive Blu-ray rendition. So, here it comes.<br /><br />THE BINDING<br /><br />Physically, it comes in what I see it's called a 'book' binding. I have one other edition of 'The Matrix' put together in the same fashion. It is literally a book. Hard-cover style, the disk attached to the inner side of the back cover. If you open the book, carefully, you will find glossy, beautifully illustrated pages dedicated to the many great actors that played in Shawshank, to Stephen King, of course, the director, the writer. Being a book, it doesn't lock. It also doesn't open very well so, like I said, open it carefully.<br /><br />I am not going to say that \\"this book binding alone should be reason enough to get yourself the Blu edition\\" because it would be silly but the pretty package shows that some TLC was invested when putting this together this release, unlike some other do-it-quick-and-cheap DVD-to-Blu translations - and they know who they are.<br /><br />PICTURE AND SOUND<br /><br />The quality is dramatically better when compared to the previous DVD edition. And, no, it does not compare with an upscaled DVD. I watched the first few minutes on the DVD and on the Blu on a PS3 that upscales DVDs and there is no comparison. There is some graininess in scenes shot in semi-dark surroundings but I would call the overall quality of the picture as somewhere between 'excellent' and 'spectacular'.<br /><br />Almost the same to be said about the sound. The TrueHD makes a significant difference on a 7.1 surround system. I know it because the Dolby 5.1 track is also included and even my untrained ears can tell the difference.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />Sadly, there's nothing new here. Three LENGTHY features (40-plus minutes each), including a full Charley Rose episode discussing the movie with all the two main actors and the director. The other two extras feature Stephen King, the script writer, the director, the actors, the town where the movie was shot, the 'Shawshank Prison' building (a former real prison in real life), even former 'true' prisoners, talking about how it really was. All three features are worth watching but, sadly, they are in the old 'narrow screen', low-res TV format with 2-channel stereo sound.<br /><br />An alternative sound track with director's commentary is also available.<br /><br />RATING THIS EDITION<br /><br />With all the little shortcomings noted, it HAS to be a 5-star because I'm comparing it with any of the prior editions.

B00005MP58|5.0|I love this BBC version of Pride and Prejudice and am not distracted at all by the picture quality that others have described. Perhaps because my television is older. Not sure. Nevertheless,this ranks as one of my favorite movies (next to Gospel of John). I watch it several times a year. Superb acting and direction, and it keeps very close to the original text, which I am currently reading - again. Of course, there are slight variances from the novel, but not so many liberties taken as seen in the theatrical version starring Keira Knightley.    I have lost disc two and find myself having to purchace a second copy (sigh). Albeit, it is a worthwhile investment.
B001MYIXAW|3.0|It's taken me a long time to write a review of this film after seeing it. The delay came not from the daunting praise that's been heaped upon it (well over 60 international award nominations/wins), but by the film itself. It also has ...something ...about it that lingers in the mind; something that I'll try to hit upon while writing this review.<br /><br />First let's talk about the movie's genre. It has often been mislabeled as horror. It isn't. It has very few horror elements and should never be cast into that bloody pool (those who've seen the film will get my pun ...I hope). Yes, there's the vampire construct from the beginning, but this vampire film is far different than those that've come before. It is touching in the adolescent sense and numbing in the way the story unfolds and is filmed.<br /><br />So let's talk a moment about the filming. Shot on-location in Sweden during the winter months, the color film is often muted by the black and white of snow and buildings. This gives the film a unique feel and a connection to the main characters (as they live in a black-and-white world full of knowns ...for a while), but it also makes the eyes of the viewer tired of seeing the same drabness. This is why I gave the film a bit lower rating than most. Although I know where and why writer/director Alfredson did what he did -- for the sake of his art --  I don't think it translated completely to the big screen.<br /><br />The story, however, is pretty magical in that it takes an old genre (vampire films) and puts a new spin on it. The main characters aren't just young, they're REALLY young. Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is just 12 years old. Battling toward adolescence, he is small for his age and is ridiculed and tortured by fellow classmates. One can only imagine the amount of anger bottled up inside him. But we don't have to imagine it ...because it shows up in the form of a 12-year-old girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson), an aged vampire forever locked in a young body. The two form a friendship based on puzzles (Rubik's Cube) and their need to connect with someone their own age. For Eli, the connection is a much greater need (as we see by the end of the film). But for Oskar, it must feel just as great.<br /><br />And speaking of the end, there's a surprise waiting for those who make it through the film. A big one. The ending, when spoken about in movie circles, is often said to present more questions than answers. Was Oskar just a pawn for Eli? Something she needed to survive? Was Eli even real? Or was she a dark figment of Oskar's personality that manifested itself via murder? It is a dichotomy that will not be easily un-puzzled.<br /><br />And herein lay the reason it took me so long to review LET THE RIGHT ONE IN after seeing it: I didn't know how to respond (myself) to that ending. But one things for sure, it stuck with me. I remember every word the two main characters spoke and recall all of the mixed angst and beauty they represented. It definitely sank a fang into me.sed on puzzles (Rubik's Cube) and their need to connect with someone their own age.

0385504225|5.0|I like the lost symbol because it is easy to read, instead of watching a film I read this book an it's quiet as easy as watching. I red also the pervious Langdon books Dan Brown wrote and so I felt directly familiar with. I could not understand way so many reviews her criticize the authors writing abilities because everybody who buy or bought the lost symbol could easily know which sort of book it is. Some people seem to be annoyed about the fact that this book describes sciences which are in reality not really scientific but this was also predictable in order to this author. For an immigrant like I am it's a convenient way to read in English no dictionary is necessary like buy my other English reading projects (Marcel Proust: the search for the lost time and the Gilgamesh epic). The inductive approach Robert Langdon uses to solve the ancient puzzles is really congenial. The lost symbol posses all what I expect from  a mystery/SIFI thriller (suspense, action, drama, murder and ancient riddles).
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I have seen a lot of romantic comedies and they are all the same, this was predictable obviously we all knew that Ryan and Sandra were going to really fall in love but it was still funny and Betty White is still great. I am going to buy this movie to add to my collection there were several really cute parts that made me laugh out loud. It's worth a watch!!
0375758992|5.0|In Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight, Alexandra Fuller provides a book that truly captured me.  Her book, an account of her life and growing up in Africa, presents a corner of the world that I found I know little about other than headline news banners.  The surroundings, culture, politics, and life struggles of the location she lived in were unfamiliar and fascinating to me.  Within her accounting of the environment she grew up in Ms. Fuller provides the reader a personal story that makes the news banners real and powerful at a human level.    What was familiar to me and just as fascinating was her story of family life.  Her mother, Nicola, is definitely a memorable character.  My sisters and I grew up in a family with a memorable character also.  I have never been able to explain to my wife that the craziness was not hell at all to me.  At the end of her book, actually in the reader's guide, she provides the best description of life in that environment - passionate, wonderful, troubled, oppressive, chaotic, beautiful - that I have ever read.  Fantastic.    Enjoy the book.  If the cover alone doesn't grab, just start reading.  The book will do the rest.
B00005MAM2|4.0|It's easy to see why 'Akira' became one of the first anime to be really successful in the West. The dark, apocalyptic storyline was very different from the usual Japanese magical girls and fighting robots, and there was plenty of flashy eye-candy in the form of outstanding animation (for its time). However, while the style is great, the substance is lacking.     The fundamental problem with 'Akira' is that it is a 2 hour movie cobbled together from a very long manga, meaning the story is compressed and rushed almost to the point of incomprehensibility. There are so many important plot points that are skimmed over or left out altogether, and the pacing of the movie is poor. Most of the important plot points (involving Tetsuo) are dispensed with reasonably early in the film, and the entire second half is given over to Tetsuo's rampage and destruction. They should have cut this down and spent more time fleshing out the story.    Another problem is the characterisation. Since the main characters are mostly biker punks or ruthless military/medical men, there isn't exactly much room for depth and sensitivity. In fact, it's pretty two-dimensional to be honest. Kaneda is a sort of anti-hero, and he does at least show some development and growing maturity over the course of the film. Kei is probably the closest thing to a true heroine, while The Colonel has some humanity to him despite being the main antagonist.    Sure, given the flashy and action-packed nature of this anime, you can just switch off your brain and enjoy the eye-candy. On a very basic \\"I'm mad as hell and not gonna take it anymore!\\" level, the film is easy enough to follow. But to truly understand 'Akira' requires the utmost concentration, and almost certainly multiple viewings. This is the issue with the film: blood and guts action fans will probably not want to make such an in-depth investment, but the more intellectual fans might be put off by the pointless violence and brutality.     From the viewpoint of 2009, 'Akira' is arguably more important for its influence than for what it actually is. However, its historical importance is enormous, and despite its major flaws remains essential for every anime fan.
0307472590|5.0|Es un libro muy rico en que se desarollan tramas, sub-tramas y ramas de sub-tramas. Ruiz Zafon escribe con toda su fuerza del coraz&oacute;n y muestra una Barcelona g&oacute;tica y aut&eacute;ntica, una hist&oacute;ria estupenda!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This show is great.  We stumbled on it part by accident and part because my husband loved FireFly.<br /><br />The comedy is great.  The mysteries are good.  Its well written.  The chemistry is there.  The show has everything needed to keep me coming back every week.<br /><br />Unlike some cop type shows, you do want to go back and watch these episodes again.  So, I was excited to add Castle to my DVD collection.  I just wished the DVD had come out earlier so I could re-watch before the new season stated.
0385504225|5.0|I bought this book for my husband who is a Mason and a Shriner.  He really enjoyed  the book and now I am reading it.  Dan Brown went to great lenghts to understand  Masonic ritual and he really explored Washington, D.C.  In many of the European  countries hundreds of years ago, the Masons had to go underground as they were hunted and killed for being a Mason.    Masons are not a secret society and any man who joins will find that out.  Dan Brown has woven a great story, and even though I have not finished the book, everyone should read this book.  It is filled with a greater understanding of how  Washington, D.C. was built and gives everyone a closer look at our forefathers.  It is because of them that this country became so great.  And as most people know  many of them were Masons, and because of their principals, we became a great democracy.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I started reading this on my kindle the day it came out.<br />Unlike Angels & Demons I did not find myself thinking about giving up on the book.  It was an entertaining and easy read.  I think people might have set expectations too high for this one.  Some things felt a little choppy, and a little repetitive, but all in all a solid read.
0545123267|5.0|This was a great book and I can't wait for the second one! If you like Twilight, this is a great book to read. The characters are wonderful and there is a lot of action. It is a love story, but has other aspects in it. Great book to read. I read it in about two days.
0385337388|4.0|This 1970's novel about Roy Basch, intern, is well known in the medical field. I read it for the first time during my own training in the early 80's. Most of us did. I'm on my fourth copy, because it keeps falling apart. Despite reading this book, my eldest is now in medical school, looking forward to his own internship.   It's a slightly (!) over the top journey through what was then a very tough medical apprenticeship. The rules limited all night call to four nights a week, and no more than alternate weekends, but the rules were often ignored. Refusal to work got you kicked out and futureless. We took refuge in black humour, cruel jokes, alcohol, and sex. We, too, slept with and often married nurses, or sociable cervixes. We called for bowel runs, 'roids, and fought for the best patients. One or two of us found it too tough and shuffled off this mortal coil. The rest of us grew a skin. In short, (almost) everything found in this book was true for us. This remains an extremely funny, cruel and slightly surrealistic look at medical training which has a lot of lessons for students now. It's also a great read. It should be #1 on any wouldbe medical student's must read list.
0439023483|5.0|I loved this book and could not put it down. It is a YA book, but I think anyone would enjoy it. It has great characters and a great storyline. I read this book in two days and bought the second one the day it came out. Hunger Games is all about dedication, love, commitment, family, friends, and so much more.
0385504225|5.0|Enough already with all the negative reviews, too many bitter people on Amazon..Let's face reality, if you are a Dan Brown fan (and MANY are) then you are going to love The Lost Symbol. In fact this book is MORE exciting than the Davinci Code and Angels & Demons! The hype for this book was unbelievable and this book was fantastic!

B0009XNUK0|5.0|I happened to grow up listening to Michael. He was the first artist I ever heard since I was six years of age. Over the years I have liked and heard of other great artists as well but this is the only artist that has helped me develop and to be- come inspired by the love of innocence and compassion for all. He has given me that and to other fans around the world. I will never ever forget him and my love for him will be eternal thanks to the spiritual power of his music that has been spread to me and others around the world. This set will raise our emotions and the need to be compassionate as well, especially in this day and age. Love U Michael, and thanks so very much for the gift you've given me.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|If there has ever been a controller out there that you have been looking for then look no further because this has got to be the best Gamecube controller I've ever found.  It plays perfectly and the buttons are smooth; the L and R buttons click in fast without any real push from the springs.  The 10ft( or 3m[or 9.8ft for those technical guys]) cord was a surprise to me, I didn't even know it was going to be that long and really I'm glad it was.  A long cord like that for controllers work well for where i play my games.  This is a definite recommendation and I urge all those looking to buy a new controller to pick this up even if you think the price might not be worth it, just trust me cuz it truly is.  You won't regret buying this product.
0316017922|5.0|What could be easier. I need to make a purchase, I go to wonderful Amazon, easily navigate the site, find what I'm looking for, love the price, order it, receive it in a few days and am thrilled with the seller as well as the purchase. Isn't that nice??? Thank you Amazon! Happy customer, Diane
0439023483|5.0|My daughter recommended the book.  It took a few pages before I could get into it, but then I was hooked!  Quick moving, exciting, good character development, great story line.  When I wasn't reading the book, I was thinking about it.  As soon as the the book was finished I immediately went to the second book in the series, Catching Fire, and I've just about finished it.  Hurry with the third in the series - I can't wait to see what happens next!
4770030088|5.0|This book is great, It has helped me learn so far so I am able to keep up with my class. The audio CD is great to listen to and easy to get used to. I had no problem beginning with the Romanized version, I am now transitioning onto using the Kana version. I recommend it to anyone beginning their studies in the Japanese Language.
0385504225|1.0|The Characters are not believable, and if they were real, how lame they would be. I wanted to slap all of them for stupidity. I plowed through hoping the ending would reward me with something cool, but the ending was a big yawn.    I wanted to like it. However, when it was not a total bore, the story and characters stretched my credulity and patience too far. I was just glad it was over when I finished.     Poor Dan. I think he really is a good writer! I feel sure he believed in this story and the people in it. So much work went into this book.
B0000AYJXR|1.0|My kids have been waiting for this movie to arrive for this movie since Sept. 15 today is Oct. 15 we still have not received it. I called the vendor AOKMOVIES2 to find out what could be done. The customer service rep (3)that I spoke to was not very friendly or appoligetic for the movie not arriving. The customer service rep instantly processed my payment return. I had to call back to speak to a manager who was very customer service oriented. He offered to resend the movie Oct. 12 but it still has not arrived. I ordered Monsters Vs. Aliens from another vendor Oct 8 and it was in my mail box Oct 14. I am still waiting for Space Jam that was remailed by manger at AOKMOVIES2.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|As much as I love \\"Dirt\\" and still confused (and in love) with their self-titled (1995, \\"tripod\\")... this one surely deserves much more praise... Layne's missing for one thing, so trying to come up with this under such loss is no easy feat. Buy it, just like I did. Few bands evolve so brilliantly and age this well... these days passion in music is fading away. At a very alarming rate. My respect to Sean, Jerry and Mike, and a big welcome to William. If faith in good music was somehow lost, this is a deeply reminder that there might be some more left to come.
B0011NVC98|5.0|When I saw this film was computer generated I thought it would be cartoonish but it was amazing! Great story compared to the other Beowulf movies I have seen. This one was the best by far. Very moving, incredible computer effects. Grendel was horrifying and actually gave me nightmares. The ending was sad though.
B002KDUDG6|2.0|As a preface, I haven't listened to this album.  But I saw Bublé perform last week on the TODAY show.  He was boring and off pitch! The arrangements were pretty good if very conservative, and the band was super tight.  But he just seemed very uncomfortable onstage, and was simply not a good singer.    If the album is any good at all, it's most likely because of some SERIOUS editing in the studio.  And most likely some close-to-T-Pain autotuning.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It was frank and yet humorous at times. I highly recommend it.
B000JQU7U8|1.0|This is truly a great book, but the translation of the free version is awkward and painful. I suspect that the volunteer(s) knew German very well, but their English was like that of a foreign exchange student on his first day in America. I read it all the way through, but would gladly pay a few bucks for a professional translation if I were to do it again.
B002K0WBXW|2.0|I was so looking forward to viewing this because I like both Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds (and of course Betty White!) and I was expecting a great time since it was a huge box office hit and had good buzz. After 30 minutes, I started wondering when the hysterical moments would begin. Unfortunately they never do. Sure, there are a few scenes that are mildly funny but I found most of the film awkward and strained. The leads are attractive, the setting is gorgeous, and the photography is outstanding but the movie fails to get off the ground and the whole scenario is just unbelievable.
B001GCUO16|5.0|This is one of the best summer movie of 2009 by far.  I loved this movie and since its arrival have played it 10 times.  I recommend this video for any avid comic book lover and action film enthusiast.  From the beginning the movie has pristine color and amazing special effects and blu-ray only adds to the crispness of the film.  Its a definite must for anyones collection, and not only did it come with the blu-ray disc but it also came with the digital copy to add to my ipod so i can take it anywhere
B001VPJZOU|5.0|Enough of the issues and questions from the series are resolved.  Left an opening to continue the story.
B002NXSRX4|1.0|Liked it that he didn't say a word and did a lot of chop-socky.    Other than that, this movie was awful. Love the fact that even though Parks' character Shadow (I think that's the characters' name) didn't have much air time, he's larger than the rest of the gang on the cover. This of course shows you that the company knew that my assessment of the show was correct and are hoping that the audience who Did Not see the movie in the theater will buy this because they see a 'sorta' ninja on the cover and think that he's the actual Star of the movie!    They're making a movie on silly games like 'Astroid' and 'Battleship' which shows you how desperate hollyweird is nowadays. 'GI joe' is on that weird coin too.
0385504225|3.0|I'm not sure it's safe to get to know Robert Langdon, the main character in The Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons, and this book.  People around him suffer terrible mishaps.  But when religious and mystical understanding is the result, perhaps it's okay.<br /><br />Well, that about sums up The Lost Symbol!<br /><br />Here's a recipe for this book:<br /><br />Take a half dozen macabre deaths.  Mix with a desperately tight timeline.  Be astounded every time there is clarity regarding the meanings of symbols.  Leave all skepticism out.  Add the location of every step every character takes.<br /><br />This Quackwatch-worthy book (Noetic Sciences... good grief, Charlie Brown!), with a poorly educated bad guy outwitting everyone, and severely injured and exsanguinated people never needing a rest, really requires the reader to leave disbelief behind.<br /><br />Okay, on the positive side, you REALLY want to know how it ends.<br /><br />Rats!
0767821629|5.0|Sony Conspiracy to rip off consumers is in play. Sony greed.    BOYCOTT OF SONY STARTING HERE AND NOW.   DO NOT BUY ANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS because as one reviewer already noticed that Starman was not re-released in Widescreen in effort to defraud public.    We consumers in the recession economy won't, CAN'T, will not buy overpriced Bluray so Sony has devised a diabolical scheme to FORCE US instead of just lowering Bluray prices.  They thought that when they beat the HD battle they woudl be rich beyond compare.    NOT !!!!    So now Sony has conspired to FORCE US TO BUY BLURAY by buying the rights and then releasing great movies we all want on DVD in WIDESCREEN ONLY IN BLURAY specially the Si Fi movies that MUST be seen in their entirety ie NOT 4:3 Pan and Scan.  They are releasing them in FULLSCREEN 4:3 GARBAGE.    Examples so far:  1. Thirteenth Floor  2. Starman    ARE FULLSCREEN ONLY LIKE SOME STUPID TV SHOW.    The Bluray version is Widescreen but the standard DVD is Fullscreen.  Can you believe this evil corporation?    I HATE SONY MORE THAN ANYTHING AND FOR ME I NOW WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING SONY AGAIN, NO TV, NO PLAYER, NO NOTHING.    We must revolt against them.  The back lash will teach them a lesson.    Boycott Sony products because they are disgusting, greedy pigs who treat their customers like idiots, have the worst customer service, and who MUST force us to buy their products because we will NOT volunteer to buy overpriced Bluray.    GREED AND EVIL RULES SONY.  They care nothing for us only ripping us off.    PLEASE PASS THIS ON.

As the masons have always illustrated the higher truths in sacred geometries made of stone, so has Dan Brown created the perect mix of history, mystery and mysticism.
0061914177|5.0|It was late last year when I first heard about Crush It! (Harper Studio, 2009) I was interviewing author, Gary Vaynerchuk for my book.  The Crush It! may not have had its title at that point but he spoke with passion and enthusiasm about the value of authenticity, hustle, and following your DNA.  He really believes that someone can follow their passion and live the life of their dreams.  I am happy to say that the sharp wit, business savvy, and zeal that I experienced in my conversations with Gary come across in Crush It!<br />The book is both a motivational speech and a how-to manual for budding Web 2.0 entrepreneurs, and really anyone who wants to take charge of their lives by doing what they love.  Despite being a brief 142 pages, he makes his point strongly without wasting a lot of ink.  He discusses indentifying a personal passion, and using social media to build a personal brand that will, through hustle and patience, reward the entrepreneur with happiness and cash. (He stresses the former as the primary goal.)  Clearly, anyone new to the world of social media will find this book informative, instructive, and easy to read.  Those with more experience in the world of Web 2.0 will also find Crush It! worth a look.  I suppose I am a great example of the latter, I live the subject and have written a book, keep a successful blog, teach it at the college level, regularly speak to business and professional groups, and use these techniques every day and I have a page of notes that I made while reading this book.<br />If I have any criticism it is that Gary does not give much time to using traditional media ( I am talking about PR stuff, not advertising) to create the personal brand that stems from the entrepreneur's DNA.  He mentions it briefly in Chapter 11, \\"Start Monetizing,\\" but doesn't give us the depth he could have.  He is a master of the traditional media too.  He has been mentioned in the Wall Street Journal, on the Today Show, and on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, just to mention a few of his traditional media appearances..<br />So, whether you're just getting started or have already made a mark for yourself I will say that you will find a pretty strong return on investment for the $[...] you spend on Crush It!<br />Gaetan Giannini, author of Marketing Public Relations: A Marketer's Approach to Public Relations and Social Media.

B0029LHW4U|4.0|Damn this is a solid album! The new guy doesn't sound exactly like Layne but he does a fine job singing the songs and meshes well with Jerry's voice. And Jerry totally brings the heavy riffs and good song writing that he's always dished out. The slower songs also rock as well, \\"when the sun rose again\\" is definitely unique and is one of my favorites. \\"Private Hell\\" and the mains single \\"Check My Brain\\" both sound such like classic Alice in Chains. Its good album name and the song is a great tribute to Layne. Its hard for a band to continue to be successful creatively and commercially. AC/DC did it and I think Alice is sure to follow.
B00004VVND|4.0|I remember seeing this is the 70's and bought it because I wanted to see it again.  It was worth it, although I remembered parts I didn't remember the end.  I think it left you wondering if he made it out of Westworld.  Glad I watched it again.
0061914177|5.0|Think you can read these 148 pages in an hour or two? Not if you're really getting it. Not if you want to build your own personal brand as it's packed with details that anyone who wants to, can apply to their own endeavor of building a personal brand.<br /><br />I went right to Chapter 9 because  of the title \\"The Best Marketing Strategy Ever\\" and because I had to know why the entire Chapter was only 2 pages. Afterall, isn't Marketing the biggest budget in any company?  How then can the best be explained in 2 pages?<br /><br />Actually, the best marketing strategy ever is explained in LESS than two pages. Gary explains it in one word CARE!<br /><br />You owe it to yourself, literally, to read Gary's book.

081095415X|5.0|The book is great and just what I expected from Nick Brandt.  However the packing of the book was beyond terrible and the book arrived damaged and bent.  It came in a package that was far bigger than the book and with bubble wrapping only on one side of the book, thus why it was crushed and damaged.
B002K0WBYG|5.0|It's been a long time since I have seen a movie this good! I was laughing so hard during parts that I was crying. My boyfriend and I watched this movie together and we both though it was a really good movie. I know a lot of people are unhappy because they feel that it is so similar to other movies, but let's face it, most plots are predictable. I think this is completely worth the money. Overall, great, funny movie!
0061730327|4.0|A very inspiring story of a boy (William Kamkwamba) growing up in Malawi in Africa. The book gets a rating of 5 for subject matter but probably sits at a 3 for narration.    Its a first time I have read a book based in the heart of Africa and got a whole new perspective to the cultural life there especially with regards to the influence of \\"magic\\" and witchcraft that holds sway over people's minds.    This book is more like a biography of this young man growing up in Africa. Living in a large family and making off their living off the land as farmers is tough as it is. Plus throw in the prevalance of disease, a corrupt government that makes basic necessities of life look like luxuries (read no water, no electricity and of course no sanitation facilities)and also the threat of famine.    William's family and the whole country goes through a period of starvation and that is very moving description. Old men, babies, young men and women all reduced to bones with wandering bands of men looking for food in lieu of work that they provide. Families reduced to eating only one meal a day and parents making sacrifices for their children. One description that I remember is that of the floor of the mill house being swept clean by tongues of men and women hungry and starved (no need for any brooms). Those living priviledged lives in the West should make a note of the luxuries that they live in.    The main focus of the book, anyways, is on Williams and his creative genius in unlocking the power of the wind to make electricity through the combination of a wind mill and a dynamo. He is a very inquisitive guy and picks up knowledge from his observations and a book that he picks up from the local library - - - makes a lot of sense to invest in education/libraries in developing countries. Along with the fact that he is supported by his family although his friends do make fun of him.    It does not come our very forcefully in the book but like many inventors, he would have faced dissappointments and hurdles to overcome. Its very appreciable what this farm boy did with a great passion to learn but having to drop out from school as he did not have the fees to pay (in some ways thats a blessing as he then got the time to work on his invention).    On a larger public policy scale, governments and NGO's should think about how to replicate this culture of innovation that can uplift whole sections of people from the clutches of dire poverty and despair.    Thanks to William and the authors for letting us know about this triumph of the human spirit.
0440238153|3.0|I recently finished the Dark Material Trilogy and, quite frankly, I'm not sure if I really understand what finally happened,    Think of a rocket taking off from the earth and speeding through the sky.  The first book, The Golden Compass\\" takes off with a tremendous burst of energy with our protagonist, Lyra, driving the story forward with grace and power.  Overcoming challenges of all types, she makes the right moves, meets the right people and befriends those who become stout allies.    The Subtle Knife is the second stage of our rocket.  Aided by the energy of the first stage, the addition of the character Will starts to send the rocket off course.  Our dear Lyra becomes unsure, subservient and servile.  Will suddenly becomes the \\"star\\" of the second book and Lyra becomes a secondary character.  Unfortunately Will just doesn't work in the role of leader.  At this point the story is starting to lose its way.  Stories and subplots start to multiply and many questions are never resolved leaving numerous plot holes.  Did we really need homosexual angels?    Finally we finish with \\"The Amber Spyglass\\".  Running here, running there, cutting holes in one world and out the other.  Angels, the Authority in a box, Ariel and Coulter over the edge with Metatron, the wonderful \\"Intention Machine\\" that drops from the plot.  The simple coming of age story is lost in rediculous details that detract from, rather than reinforce the story. Lyra is floundering badly, Will is clueless and the story grinds to an embarrassing end sadly lamenting lost puppy love.    I missed something here, but I don't know what.  How was Mary Malone the temptress?  What was accomplished by Lyra and Will? What was the result of Ariel and Coulter's actions?  Father Gomez??     I know that this series is considered a modern classic, and I'll grant that status to The Golden Compass.  But with the introduction of Will, the series just lost focus and perhaps that's why we'll never see either \\"The Subtle Knife\\" or \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" on the silver screen.

B002KDUDG6|5.0|At first listen, I didn't know what to think of his album. The first three albums are so even that I can barely remember which songs are on which because I love them so much - I just pick one at random when I want to hear some Buble. This one is definitely a departure, and I personally think he knocked it out of the park. I don't doubt that not all the fans will like this one, but I thought it was more upbeat than his other albums.<br /><br />It definitely opened strong with \\"Cry Me a River\\" and \\"All of Me\\", which are more traditional Michael Buble fare and benefit from his dominant voice at the poignant parts. \\"Heartache Tonight\\" follows in their vein, as well, and has that Frank Sinatra feel to it.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed with \\"Georgia on my Mind\\". It's still a worthy cover, but it's one of his few covers where I wasn't blown away.<br /><br />One of the tracks that really stuck with me was \\"Stardust\\", a collaboration with Naturally 7. It makes me feel like I'm in a 1940s song, only I know that I'm not - it stirs up very different and fun emotions within me.<br /><br />\\"Haven't Met You Yet\\" is a perfect single and is sure to be a mainstream hit, and is very catchy.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the sampling in \\"All I Do is Dream of You\\", but it's otherwise a truly fun track.<br />\\"Baby (You've Got What It Takes)\\" is definitely one of the bigger risks he took, but Sharon Jones adds a really cool element to this album, in my opinion. I love that it's something different, and it really grows on you. \\"Whatever it Takes\\" with Ron Sexsmith is another great collaboration, and it's just awesome how well their voices work together. The accompaniment on this track is really wonderful and has some beautiful riffs.<br /><br />As you can probably tell, I have trouble giving descriptive words about these tracks, but I really am just trying to convey that this is a well-rounded album that is as much a joy to listen to as any of his other albums. It is a slight departure from his normal stuff, but you will get a fair amount of the Michael Buble you've grown to love. I recommend that first timers check out his self-entitled album or It's Time first, but regulars should feel safe in picking this one up. It's a great feel-good album and it's clear that he hasn't fallen into a creative rut yet, so hopefully the great albums will keep flowing.amount of the Michael Buble you've grown to love.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|Although Whitney doesn't quite hit the high notes she's known for, I absolutely love her CD.  It's inspirational and makes us remember why we waited for her return with baited breath.  Whitney actually makes my morning commute pleasurable as I sing along with her...she's back!
0545157617|5.0|We love all of the books by these authors, and this one does not disappoint.  A great little story, despite the Xmas theme, that can be read no matter the time of year.  I love the sing-songy writing of the book (which many of their books have) and the illustrations are so detailed and bright.  If you have liked their other books, you will also enjoy this one.
0141439513|5.0|the book font size is perfect -- was my only unwritten concerns before receiving the book.
B002MW50KO|5.0|Well first off if you don't like this album then you obviously are not a Bob Dylan fan! Pleaseo not expect Bob's voice to sound any diffferent than on his last album called \\"Together Through Life\\" he does not and will not sound like he did 30 years ago!! Please people stop criticizing Bob Dylan! This is a great Dylan effort, it sounds kind of old fashioned which is the sound Bob is leaning to these days. Its a fun album with Santa songs and carols done in the unique Dylan way, also an original song called Christmas Blues which is a good song too! I have beeen a fan of Bob Dylan now for 30 plus years, and have liked everything that he has done. This album did not disappoint me one single bit! I want to say thank you Bob Dylan for this Christmas album!! Also thank you for donating the proceeds towards feeding the hungry this Christmas season. Again people stop criticizing this music icon.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|This movie renewed my interest in Batman. Christian Bale is probably the best batman yet. I highly this movie.
0790729733|3.0|If there was ever a more disreputable character in modern American history than the late Jim Garrison, it doesn't come to mind.  He ruined lives, committed criminal fraud and in the end the people of New Orleans threw him out of office.  Yet this slick con-man is the Gary Cooper-like Everyman in Stone's \\"re-imagining\\" of history.  Oh, it is well cast and a neat thriller.  History it isn't.  This shouldn't come as a surprise as Oliver Stone has never let the truth get in the way of his movies.  Entertaining?  Yes, actually it is.  Just don't kid yourself that you are getting some insight into a conspiracy that has held together for over forty years.  The Kennedy Assasination now enters the same realm as Area 51, Elvis sightings and alien abductions.  Much talked about without a shred of actual evidence to back up any claim.  Most political assasins tend to be screwed up losers who beileve they cam be big by killing some who actually is.  Oswald killed JFK and that is the truth. Accept or it doesn't alter it.  Like the Theory of Evolution does not change the fact that it is a fact -- never mind the pinheads who think the world is only 10,000 years old.

B002FOQXZK|5.0|I am not usually a hiphop music lover but I heard Kid Cudi's \\"Pursuit of Happiness\\" from his Man on the Moon album, and I was hooked.  This became my new favorite song.  I like the rest of the album also.  He has a wonderful soft style and you can actually understand the lyrics.  It's the first time my grandkids have wanted me to burn a cd for them.
B001RQ0SJO|5.0|Short and simple. Bat for Lashes aka Natasha Khan is awesome. She is incredibly talented, has vocals that are Heaven sent, and is gifted on so many levels, it is hard to believe so much talent can reside in one person! This album is incredible, sound wise, lyrically, and is a mystical masterpiece. Get it without a second thought, you will love it. I also saw Bat for Lashes live in Austin, TX and they sounded just as good if not better live than they do on the album. She has a mastermind group of exceptional artists, Charlotte Hatherley, Ben Christophers, and Sarah Jones. Again, you have to experience this musical masterpiece. Five stars without a doubt!
B001RTCP1A|5.0|This is Vin Diesel best movie this is what got him started this was so good that everything else he put out doesnt compare. A little about the movie... a crew is travelling when all of a sudden the captains on the ship are awaken to their space ship falling apart and are forced to land on a mysterious planet where there are creatures that only come out at night and the planet is about to go dark and then mayhem occurs this movie rocks!
B0020TS5JM|5.0|As most of the other reviewers have already stated, this is a must see! My dad and I watched it just last night! At first we were a little wary of it, because we thought it was going to be in a different language and we would have to read subtitles the whole way through, but as it turns out, that's just the first few minutes of the movie! Push past that and become glued to the screen!<br /><br />The hitchhiking creatures (I'm not really sure what they were called) were amazing! Great graphics and storyline. The movie starts off imediately filled with action as the main character, Canaan's, ship crashes on what seems to be an older earth. As the movie rushes past your eyes, you wonder why all of this is coming about until a third of the way through, when Canaan tells his story.<br /><br />During the movie, I really had to use the restroom, but I was so engrossed I couldn't pause it to go. I had to see what happened next!<br /><br />Add this to your collection, it's a five star film all the way!
B000I5XOVY|4.0|Great movie everyone does an excellent job u feel tension almost right away and will find yourself glued to this movie to see what happens.
B002MW50KY|4.0|So what's the difference between the regular and the Deluxe copy of this CD? The deluxe version contains 5 greetings cards bearing the same picture as the album cover which, I guess, are limited editions. Now back to the album.    Listening to these tracks for the first time I assumed that Dylan 'BobCats' would buy this with a completely uncritical ear - and that these fans would probably be the same ones who'd hated 'Self Portrait,' now mellow and soft shoe shuffling along to 'Winter Wonderland', bopping to 'Here Comes Santa Claus'. But then I realised that Dylan has constantly added new generations to his fan base so it is more difficult to make predictions concerning his newer listeners. I didn't know what to expect but then, I thought, 'nothing will surprise me with Dylan.' There has been a lot of merit in his last four albums - though I believe they are over-rated on account of The 'BobCat' factor which must opine that the master can do no wrong these days. This album can hardly be judged alongside his recent studio work as it is pure Christmas 'Product' and, without its status as a 'Charity Record' would be less easily forgiven - though to many of his fans Dylan can do no wrong.    'Christmas In The Heart' sounds as though Dylan has enlisted The Mike Sammes Singers/King Brothers and somehow pasted The Andrews Sisters into the mix. Where this album follows in the wake of his last couple of albums is in Dylan's ear for that 'Old Timey' music, reflected in the choice of album cover and in much of the music played on 'Theme Time Radio Hour'. This music oozes Christmas past.    With the album playing on a continual loop I came to a deeper enjoyment of it as I listened, 'The Little Drummer Boy' is quite affecting in Dylan's burnt out vocal, 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas' which I confess to quite enjoying though not necessarily in the spirit I should do. Dylan intones rather than sings it. 'Do You Hear What I Hear?' [Ahem] 'The First Noel',[with a heavy Andrews Sisters sound] 'Oh Come All Ye Faithful', a slightly strained vocal as Dylan tries for notes beyond his reach and rasps out the latin verse with comic pronunciation; a frantic 'Must Be Santa Claus', a croaked 'Oh Little Town Of Bethlehem' and a mellow 'I'll Be Home For Christmas''. - '[I Guess I've Got] The Christmas Blues' sounded as though it could be an original but now I have the full credits instead of an info free demo I find it isn't. Another 'stand out' track is 'If You've Ever Spent Christmas On Christmas Island' to the tune of Patsy Cline's 'Have You Ever Been Lonely' and awash with Hawaiian guitars The whole concept is a link back to the late forties and early fifties, in particular to Bing Crosby purveyor of many a Christmas album. Dylan has included three of the songs most closely identified with Crosby--\\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" (1943), \\"Silver Bells\\" (1952), and \\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\\"[1962]    So what do I think? Well it's a 'Christmas Album by Dylan' - art imitates history. For back in the late sixties there was a rumoured bootleg of 'Dylan's unreleased 'Christmas Album' and there was even mock up art work and a tracklist. But considering I'm impervious to Dylan's X Factor this album grew on me with each listening and Dylan charmed his way so far into my consciousness that I was humming and singing along to myself as I went through the rest of the day.    This is a 'Good' record but not a great one, there are few 'Great' Christmas records, though, 'A Christmas Gift For You' from Phil Spector'  is certainly one that I'll be playing alongside Dylan come Christmas. Unlike some of my detractors I can't automatically award 'Christmas In The Heart', five stars just because it is by Bob Dylan and the royalties are all going to charity. But as Live listened it has gone from 3 to 4 stars.
0393312836|5.0|This may be guilding the lily, but I might as well put in my two cents.  Yes, this book was so great I enjoyed every page.  What a ride. What a trip.  Great use of language.  The kind of book you want to have in your library, for occasional re-reading (altho I havent done so).  This book will knock you upside the head and you will like it!!!
B002MW50KO|4.0|I must admit I thought back to Self Portrait when I was listening to tracks from this Christmas offering from Dylan. I actually found, and find, some good songs on Self Portrait and would swap many of Dylan's eighties albums - and certainly Under the Red Sky for it. Then it was heresy for Dylan to pick old time music standards to compile an album. Later he would win some acclaim for his two 'roots' albums Good as I Been to You and World Gone Wrong though there were still mumblings about the need for a new album of original work - amusing considering how many old songs were wrapped up in his 'original work'. Today half of his charm is an old time feel and nostalgia that characterises his late work - awash with a late forties/early fifties feel.     Listening to the record minutes after downloading it I assumed that Dylan fans would buy this with a completely uncritical ear - and that these fans would probably be the same ones who hated 'Self Portrait' now mellow, and soft shoe shuffling along to 'Winter Wonderland' bopping to 'Here Comes Santa Claus'. But then I had to remind myself that Dylan has added new generations to his fan base and that just how this record would be heard and rated by his newer fans was unpredictable. I didn't know what to expect but then, I thought, 'nothing will surprise me these days.' There has been a lot of merit in his last four albums - though I believe they are over-rated on account of The 'BobCat' factor which must opine that the master can do no wrong these days.     'Christmas In The Heart' sounds as though Dylan has enlisted The Mike Sammes Singers, Kings Brothers and Andrews Sisters as backing singers. Where this album follows in the wake of his last couple of albums is in Dylan's ear for that 'Old Timey' music, reflected in the choice of album cover and in much of the music played on 'Theme Time Radio Hour'. This music oozes Christmas past. However, while it's probably heresy to say so a lot of these tracks sound like Dylan singing these Christmas classics Karaoke style to the aforementioned Mike Sammes/Andrews Sisters backing - which I suppose is original . . . . today. It's now OK to 'Look Back'. In fact it's imperative if you want to keep on collecting Dylan's catalogue. It's a 'good' album, [hence the three stars] but not a great one. Can anyone make a GREAT Christmas record? Well, yes A Christmas Gift For You from Phil Spector [Digitally Remastered By Phil Spector] And I'm recommending that as an admirer of Bob Dylan who has collected his music for over 40 years.     With the album playing on a continual loop I came to a deeper enjoyment of it as I listened, 'The Little Drummer Boy' is quite affecting in Dylan's burnt out vocal, 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas' which I confess to quite enjoying though not necessarily in the spirit I should do.

0385504225|4.0|I titled this \\"Another Masonic Novel\\" since there have been so, so many novels written recently using the secrets of the Masons as a story line.  I would have expected Brown to come up with a new group, even if fictitious, to build his story around.    That said, the novel is well written and, thank goodness, well proofed.    I found the characters interesting and the plot twists to be well chosen and well placed within the book.    I think he could have worked a little harder on the ending and given us one more twist.    Still I rated it four stars since it was a very enjoyable reading experience.
0060168366|1.0|The book took three weeks to get here, which seems kind of ridiculous to me.  The product itself was in good condition when it finally arrived.
B002SVBDYQ|5.0|It's not like Twilight but I still love this soundtrack. I can't wait to see how it all fits into the movie.
0553381407|4.0|Well-structured and helpful book.  Author provides good insight into how parents influence our development.
0385504225|3.0|The book was action packed... but the plot kept hinting at more... in the end I'd already predicted the \\"more\\" and it was kinda flat.  The highlight of the book for me was learning about the traditions of Freemasons and who they were. Also there were some incredible science/research mysteries that I will definatly want to hear more about! Bottom line, it was a good book, better if it hadn't followed Divinci Code. Looking forward to the next one Dan!
0385504225|2.0|I thought this book was awful, and I don't say that simply because of Dan Brown's writing style or because of the flat, predictable story line.  I say it because it simply just a terrible book.  The characters are underdeveloped (which is quite a feat given the book is 528 pages long) and cliched, the plot meanders aimlessly for pages at a time, and the book is filled with entire throwaway chapters.  However, the worst part is to trudge all the way through it and find the ending is a complete and utter disappointment.     I have never felt Dan Brown was a stellar author, but both A&D and DVC were at least entertaining and interesting.  But it was an absolute CHORE to finish reading this book; no wonder it took over 6 years to write.
B002KDUDG6|3.0|Just purchased this album when it came out of Tuesday. Was excited to get Michael new work but was very dissappointing to hear it.  It was too pop tart, too many remakes of other people's songs. Lacked the pizazz and vocal fun of his previous albums like \\"I'm Here\\" and \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\".  Felt like there was only 1 good song that was like his past albums, \\"Whatever it takes\\", the last song; I kept wishing that all the other songs on the album sounded like that; this song was incredible and is the type of song that made him successful. The song takes you to a dreamlike state of enjoyment just listening to it.  Rest of songs I was skipping through all the songs looking for better ones.  Think I need to listen to this album several times more to appreciate some songs but it most of the songs just don't have a good rhythm when you first listen to it.  Definitely, his worst album to date.  As someone else has stated, Michael is reaching mega star commercial success and unfortunately, seems to be putting out more mainstream, junk rather than unique music. His last DVD concert in Madison Sq Garden was dissappointing too; way to short and had few of his signature songs. Michael if your reading this, please stop skimping your fans on your albums and concert; your too good but if you keep putting out dissappointing albums and DVD concerts like this, fans won't buy it. I am selling this cd and DVD.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I am not a fan of \\"indie\\" music by any means but almost every song on this soundtrack grows on you! With the exception of Tom Yorke's which I found a little too far out there, I enjoyed and continue to enjoy every track.   I am absolutely in love with Alexandre Desplat's score. It captures the desperation and love of Bella and Edward so well.   Even without the movie, I would have still purchased these tracks.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|I love this movie.  Very suspensful and action packed with beautiful scenes of Alaska.  Add a ticked off Grizzly bear chasing the stranded folks, and it's a party.  This movie will keep your attention.  Very entertaining.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I've been a Buble fan since the beginning, but I admit I was nervous about this new release. The song list warned of the possibility of boring and redundant, but, in his unique style, Michael pulled these songs off wonderfully. His greatest talent, second only to his vocal ability, is an apparently innate ability to redo the old in a new and exciting way. I should never have doubted him.
B001L5U15M|5.0|I was using a Lowe Pro Sling Shot bag which I loved before this purchase. I needed a bag to protect a new purchased Sigma 150-500mm lens. This bag works wonderful and I can have the 150-500mm lens mounted on the Nikon D80 body and ready to go at all times. I have lots of room to grow, could add more lens and even an extra body if needed. My new lens is right at 10\\" long and with the body attached puts total length to 12\\". I also will add this is the smallest bag that I looked at for my needs, most other bags were larger and would carry a laptop computer which I didn't want. It doesn't have a rain fly like the Lowe Pro bag but the material and zippers look to be very resistance to water. I have used the bag on several trips now and am very pleased.
B002C6K7N0|2.0|I have every Megadeth album and I've been a fan for over 20 years. After pretty dissappointing, dull, [[ASIN:B000OCXFCO United Abominations]] I really expected Dave & co. to wipe the table clean this time. They do not.    Sure, Endgame is better than UA; more powerful and better songs - but there is really nothing new, nothing that we would have not heard before. It lacks the freshness that [[ASIN:B0002SPQ1I The System Has Failed]] got. Endgame is like a band going on autopilot, safely, without taking any risks, without inner fire.    I'm afraid Endgame might lead the band to end their game. Metal is not metal without the fire burning inside. And the cover? It's horrible, a childish cliché.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|The original novel by Bram Stoker is definitely the ultimate vampire story. And this film is the definite adaptation. Dracula is everything that you can ever find in a tale about vampires. The gothic settings, the excellent performances (even Keanu does a good job here!), the blood, the music, the pacing, the cinematography, the dark humor, I mean everything about it is done right. Don't get me wrong about the legendary original 1931 film; it's a classic and still stands on its own. But I'm more for the remake. It has big-time actors such as Gary Oldman playing Dracula himself, Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing, and Winona Ryder as Mina. Francis Ford Coppola has created another masterpiece, even though it isn't even in the same league as The Godfather trilogy and Apocalypse Now. Avoid Twilight as much as possible: Bram Stoker's Dracula is the one that must be watched (and read).
B001IBIQU6|4.0|After all the hoopla over 'Playing The Angel' I'm really don't understand why more people aren't appreciating 'Sounds Of The Universe'.<br /><br />'Playing The Angel' was far from perfect even though it had some great tracks. The euphoria around that release seemed to hinge on the fact that the band had put out a more electronic collection that their previous, recent efforts. SOTU is, if anything even more electronic sounding but with an ingenious use of retro keyboard sounds polished by modern production techniques. So, clearly, just sounding electronic isn't going to help people enjoy these songs even if that's what was apparently the draw last time.<br /><br />SOTU is a more complete album than 'Playing The Angel', for the most part the song writing is as good as ever and the production is excellent. There is no need to change producers or bring back Alan Wilder. The sound of the record recalls classic, early Depeche Mode.<br /><br />One thing that has bemused me has been the choice of singles released from SOTU. 'Wrong' is in my opinion one of the less interesting tracks here and so is 'Peace'. The accompanying videos for these songs were baffling - who needs to see disturbing violence in a music video? Yet the video for 'Wrong' is up for an award, so what do I know? The third single release, the Dave Gahan penned 'Hole To Feed' is the first single release that is more representative of the album as a whole.<br /><br />Once again, the freeware program 'Audacity' came in useful for chopping off the first minute and a half of 'In Chains' and the end of 'Corrupt' - minutes of forgettable 'drama' that ultimately detract from two otherwise great tracks. Less is more.<br /><br />I do have to say, that the first couple of times that I listened to these songs I was deeply disappointed but with repeated listens this album does reveal its considerable gifts.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|The Sons of Anarchy season one DVD is awesome if your a big fan of the sons.
B002S0OBFK|5.0|The entire film was made using a budget of roughly $11,000. Almost all 86 minutes of the film take place inside one room of the house. It consists mostly of one camera position the entire time. 95% of the film consists of just two actors, one of whom has only one previous film to their name, and the other has none. And more or less, this is a just ghost story. Everything about this movie is simple and seems like it could have been made by just about anyone. And therein lies its brilliance; using a minimalist approach and a slow, yet deliberate pace, Paranormal Activity is a stunningly effective horror film that makes watching two people sleeping in a dark room some of the most suspenseful and terrifying moments you will ever experience while watching a movie.<br /><br />  What makes this film so effective are the two main characters, Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat). Everything from their conversations, to their facial expressions, and their body movements are so perfectly executed and believable that it makes us think this might be actual footage we are watching. You become emotionally invested in them (specifically Katie) that you can actually feel their sense of paranoia escalating throughout the whole film. They have no idea what is going to happen next, and neither do we.<br /><br />  The premise of the film is very simple--Katie has been being haunted on and off since she was a little girl by what she believes to be a ghost. Moving into a new house with her boyfriend Micah, these \\"hauntings\\" start up again. Her boyfriend, not having known about this when they moved in together, becomes excited at first about the whole thing and wants to investigate it more. He goes out and buys a video camera and sets it up stationary on a tripod in their bedroom while they sleep in hopes of catching something, if anything on tape.<br /><br />  One of the best things about this movie, and why you should see it at least once in theaters, is the audience and their growing sense of fear throughout the film. You could literally feel the tension in the movie theatre. As the days go by, the hauntings get worse. Each time the night footage started, you could hear nearly everyone in their audience rustling their seats, anxious and terrified about what might happen next. By the last two nighttime footages are playing, people in the audience were screaming before anything even happened.

You could literally feel the tension in the movie theatre. As the days go by, the hauntings get worse. Each time the night footage started, you could hear nearly everyone in their audience rustling their seats, anxious and terrified about what might happen next. By the last two nighttime footages are playing, people in the audience were screaming before anything even happened.

B002SVBDYQ|3.0|Simply put, this soundtrack sucks. I won't go in to detail because there are others who enjoy reviewing every minute detail. I gave it 3 stars for the 3 songs I found interesting. Maybe this means that the MOVIE will actually be Good since the soundtrack is so BAD-the opposite of Twilight. Here's hoping. In the meantime, I'll stick to my own playlist. It's got Blue October, 3 Days Grace, Seether, Linkin Park and some other good stuff.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|First 4 songs are really catchy and most definitely Muse.  The only other Muse album  have is Black Holes.  This album is quite different.  Listen to it before you get it.  Some Muse fans might not dig this one as much as the other albums.
B0017H1MB6|5.0|This is a huge dinosaur action figure standing about a foot and a half tall(twice as tall as my Papo T-Rex). The figure is solid and sturdy but is adorned with nicely detailed skin textures and wrinkles to give it a realistic look. Very happy with this Scheich product and impressed by the workmanship coming out of that company recently. Props to Papo Toys for setting the new standard in dinosaur action figures.
B001NB6IN8|1.0|I am convinced these guys lost it after the first album.  Once again fame, fortune, and MTV destroys a band that had some potential.
B002I9Z8B2|2.0|Worst HD transfer I've ever seen.  Plus the disc wouldn't even play until I scratched the paint off the backside that had adhered from sitting on another disc.  You can see right through the disc too.  But mostly, there are two bridge scenes where everyone seems to have one side of their faces 20 shades darker than the other.  Looks muddy.
1400063736|5.0|The paradox of great fiction is how much truth is portayed. I really enjoyed the format of the story. If you are a fan of the short story format, I think you will enjoy this book too. I had to put the book down for several weeks and was able to easily get back into it. So that was convenient, but each chapter and 'book' was a story in it's own right. The high wire act serving as a connecting thread throughout. More interestingly was the 'intersection' of the stories and the lives therein and how McCullum was able to maintain the surprises through to the very end. If you enjoyed any of the following stories, I tink you would also like this book: \\"I know Why the Caged Bird Sings\\" by Maya Angelo; \\"Beloved\\" by Toni Morrison, \\"The Brief Wonderous Life of Oscar Wao\\" by Junot Diaz. I would not be at all surprised to see the book win the Pulitzer.

B001G9FFM2|5.0|This is epic metal. I can not get enough of this cd. I play it at the gym, I play it at home, and in the car. Truly one of the best albums I've ever heard. I'll go as far to say it is better than Burn My Eyes. Good to see the dvd was not a cheap lame cash grab as so many bonus dvd's are. **It should be noted there is a 3 disk version that also includes a disc of b-sides/covers and demos but that is near impossible to find.**<br /> Bottom line buy this!!
B00127RAJY|2.0|It takes way too long from when you put in the DVD until the work out starts.  There must be 10 minutes of 'commercials' in the beginning! The DVD does not let you fast forward through them either. More marketing than work out. I bought a bunch of Michael's DVDs and if I could return them, I would.
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|I LOVE IT. I don't know what is wrong with the people who say this album is a let down. YES its different, but different can be a good thing. They still got it, and I love almost every song on this album, with my absolute faves being If I Knew Then, Masquerade, and Undone, and my two least faves being PDA and She's A Dream (both kinda corny). I think the album is really good. See this is why they went to Europe in the first place, cause America didn't know talent when they had it, and then when they saw they were big in Europe, they suddenly wanna claim the boys. They haven't changed, the music is still good, and if MY honest opinion, this is one of the best cds. The songs are great, and well I like to dance anyway, so this is a good album for that, and the ballads are great. I didn't consider this as a let down at all. They have grown and matured over the years, and it shows in their music. they aren't kids anymore, they are grown men, and still got it going on. Its a good album, I say buy it and form you OWN opinion, that's what I did. Good music is good music, but you can't please everyone. I do wish the album had more songs, but hey Its all good, I love the cd anyway.
B002HRTMHQ|3.0|Mix is a little fuzzy, some of the songs meld together. but it is okay.
B002KDUDG6|1.0|I'm a Michael Buble's fan and was really looking forward to listening to this album. What a disappointment! I purchased it as soon as it came out and listened to it. There are 13 tracks on the album and 11 of them are just old songs stolen from others and only 2 of them are new and written for him which were okay. Needless to say, that he's done such a poor performance on redoing the old songs too. If Amazon had a policy to accept open CDs for refund, I would have returned this in a heart beat! Don't buy it folks, you'll be disappointed.
B00169N0BK|4.0|I have lost lots of paper because the color was not right. When using the colormuki, you are not going to waste a lot of paper.  What you see on the screen is what you get.  The colormunki is worth the investment and I save time, paper and ink.  Which in turn saves me money.  Very good product.
1573300403|5.0|I enjoyed this DVD thoroughly! The performance at the MTV Awards is amazing. Definitely worth the money! RIP Michael Jackson.
B001GCUO16|4.0|I was not one of the people that followed the comic books just the tv show. So I never knew how Wolverine be came Wolverine and I always wondered how it happened. This movie explains it and I think they did a great job with the movie.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Charlaine Harris is a brilliant writer and has been since long before the Trueblood series. I've read all of her books, and I've watched as she has honed her craft. The Trueblood series shows her brilliant imagination married to that craft. The books are a delight, but the DVD series is nothing short of amazing. It brings us into a world that is just like ours (maybe it IS ours?),  populated with vampires and many other strange creatures of the night. Seeing this world, with all of its well-drawn characters, on the screen, draws the watcher in. It is like taking a delightful, but sometimes frightful, romp on the wild side. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Caution: This series is addictive, and you will always want to see MORE.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Amazing Grace, based on the true story of William Wilberforce, is one of the best movies I have seen in years. This movie proved to me that modern actors can still put on a true cinematic performance based on their skills alone, without the use of special effects.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|I just watched this movie two nights ago by myself.  I don't know Guys; I really think it could have been better.  I really don't like the way they portrayed Ryan Reynolds's character.  I'm so much happier when he can be himself or some other version of \\"Van Wilder.\\"  Sandra Bullock was funny?  I don't know I think I giggle like five times through out the whole movie.  The story was cute and predictable.  The story is that Sandra's character is from Canada and is getting deported.  Ryan's character is her assistant and is forced to marry her or loose his job.  I just wish Ryan was more sarcastic and funny like he's known for.  Sandra plays a good hard arss but not really believable.  All in all I give this movie a three out of five.  If Ryan was topless more often maybe there were be a higher score.
0394417887|5.0|The book was in good condition, although I have not read it yet, haven't gotten to this particular book in class yet.
0141182865|1.0|I had to give up after 60 pages,  and scanned the rest.   There was some interest in the way he writes  and his strange, stupid characters.  But it gets tedious after awhile - nothing happening, and certainly NO humor.    What a waste of time.
0385504225|5.0|I read Da Vinci Code as well as Angles and Demons.  Dont let the length of this book scare you.  While it starts slow to develop the characters, it is well worth the wait.  I read it too fast and there was so much information, I am going to read it again soon.  I just have too many friends that wanted to get their hands on it before my second read.
0920668364|5.0|My mother gave me this book for my birthday fifteen years ago the year I turned 40, and the theme from it has stuck in my head ever since.  Now that my son has grown and moved across the country, and my parents are getting closer to the time when they will be just memories, this story becomes ever more tender.  I cannot read this book without choking up.  It truly does sum up the feeling of closeness and connection between parent and child in a way no other book I've ever read does.
1416594787|5.0|Dawkins finally brings together all the evidence of the \\"fact\\" of evolution.  While putting the last nail in the coffin of the biblical fairy tail of the creation of life on Earth, he laments the fact that over 40% of Americans have been brainwashed by organized religion to reject logic and reason and believe the writings of primitive beings.  More tragic is that public schools systems, in defiance if the US Constitution, have been forced to give equal time to religious superstition.  A book everyone should read.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|In the twilight of most actors careers you wouldn't think they could put out such powerful films! But holy moly this film touched my heart and had me reaching for the kleenex. Clint plays a guy that everyone has either known or met in their lives. It's a film for anyone from 16 to 100. Please make this film one to see! If you want to have your heart warmed and a good cry please see it!
B002GZQYMA|5.0|I was a child of the 60's and 70's and enjoy all the classics, Beatles, Stones, Led Zepplin, Pink Floyd, Queen etc and when I was introduced to Muse a year ago, I was enthralled...clearly above most of the musicians today. Have purchassed all their music and thorougly enjoy it...didn't think I could be any more impressed until I received The Resistence...Matt has outdone himself again...the band is one of the best in my book!!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I'm a huge Batman fan since the age of 7 and I'm 50 now! Usually I wait in anticipation for Batman to appear...but not this film! The Joker is who you can't wait for when you see this film. Heath captures and claims the role and NEVER will there be a greater performance by an actor as the Joker! Jack Nicholson be damned Heath is THE JOKER!
0307454541|5.0|The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larson is an engrossing read.<br /><br />Both of the main characters(and the minor ones, too) are well fleshed out. It's almost painful to read Lisbeth's reaction to anyone who tries to get close to her(as someone who has Asperger's Syndrome, I could relate.) And the tangled web aspects of both  Mikael's and Lisbeth's lives  are interesting to read.<br /><br />It's almost like a Ingmar Bergman  film in book form(if you don't feel like moving to Sweden at least once whilst reading this book  there's something wrong with you!)<br /><br />The ending wraps up things a little too neatly, and seems a bit far fetched;however, Kalle/Mikael and Lisbeth get their own back on\\"Big Buisness\\" in a way that's also very amusing.
0739319175|5.0|This was the best of Dan Brown's three novels (Angels and Demons, The DaVinci Code).  I found so much symbolism and intrigue in this book that I couldn't stop listening to it.    It seemed like Robert Langdon had a lesser role than in the previous novels, and more of a disbeliever.  Perhaps that was intentional to bring out the other characters.
1416550542|5.0|I just love this book; I could not put it down. The story is a mix of The Secret Garden, A Little Princess and Jane Eyre all in one. Plus, a glorious touch of classic fairy tale magic that makes this the perfect read. If you want an adventure and mystery you will not soon forget, you should read this book. I loved the writer's ability to take you through each of the generations of characters and magically bring their stories together. Destined to be a classic and favorite in your library.
B000HL2H3A|5.0|I missed this episode during a replay of the entire series and couldn't find it anywhere on the 'Net. When I finally found it here, I purchased it and enjoyed every minute of it.  It's a great value and highly recommended to any Star Trek: Enterprise fan.<br /><br />One of the best story lines in the entire series involves the Enterprise's search for the Xindi home world and this is one of the critical episodes from that story line. Lots of action and suspense, even the second time around!
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|The original movie I got had two small scratches.  I did not think when I mentioned it anything would be done.  I was contacted and told the movie would be replaced.  It was and in a very timely manner as was the original purchase.  I was very pleased with this purchase and how the replacement was handled.  More than pleased, surprised, nicely.  Thank you.
B001OQCV9W|5.0|I loved this movie.  I have Julia Child's French cookbooks, I am a French teacher, I love to cook, and I love French culture so this movie was right up my alley.  It was funny and interesting. I thought Meryl Streep and Amy Adams did a wonderful job as well as their \\"husbands\\".  I enjoyed both of the story lines of their lives. It held my attention the entire time and was funnier than I expected.  I can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can watch it again!
B002P1YEY0|2.0|I LOVED ALL THE OTHER BOOKS, BUT THIS ONE IT TOOK ME SOOOOO LONG TO FINISH. I FOUND IT BORING AT TIMES AND GET LOST ON ALL THE SYMBOLISM. NOTHING LIKE DA VINCI AND ANGELS AND DEMONS. GOOD LUCK ON NEXT ONE.
B0011TQLA2|5.0|Cannot get enough of how talented this band is! Just plain and simply brilliant, magnificent creatively speaking in everyway!
B000002GYW|5.0|If you like the original sound of the early Eagles, this one's for you.  It's got the feel of country-western rock of the early 70's.  I remember buying the first two albums of the Eagles when they first broke out on the scene.  I played them all the time.  These are the best sound the Eagles ever put out.  They have their early hits, but also the songs that never made hits are here that I feel are just as good if not even better since they weren't played to death on the radio.  Songs like Doolin' Dalton/Desperado Reprise, Out of Control, Bittercreek, etc.  If you want the outlaw music of early Eagles, this is a must buy.  You'll love it.
B001FB4W0W|3.0|I really enjoyed Sookie books but the story traslated to the TrueBlood series is not quite as entretaining. Lot of sex involved and not so much attached to the book story line. Lots of things that I thought where important on the book where erased or modified in the series. Well, in this series you might actually fell in love with Bill, which by the way, he is exactly as I imagined physically. There are also lot of side stories that leaves the main character away from the plot, in the series Sookie is a bit annoying compared to the one on the book. The only scene I really liked how it was changed was Sookies grandma funeral, much more real than in the book. Anyway, its worth seeing this series if you really like fiction.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|great idea . pretty good story telling . some flawed prosthetic work (the lovely japanese girl) . yeah , that was the point at which the picture kinda derailed for me a pretty fair bit . i thought the acting was uniformly quite good .the ease of our hero's escape strained credibility a good measure also . oh , and the street urchin flip/flop was silly as well . glad i saw it to judge for myself . glad we had a likable and winning protagonist . satisfactory . i liked MR. ROTH'S CABIN FEVER a bit more . i'd recommend both to folks with strong stomach's .
0307291146|5.0|My wife was overjoyed at receiving the Mastering the Art of French Cooking Box Set. The product was as advertised except for the Box (not the shipping container)that the two Volumes were in had a broken corner that I believe happened during shipping. I did not return the item because I believe that the box was broken in shipping and I can fix it.
B0000640SA|5.0|TAXI DRIVER good . even the DARK KNIGHT can't get you here . genius(s) . a true collaboration with his biological brothers in vision .
0385504225|3.0|This book was so similar to his other books that I was disappointed. I must admit there was one twist I didn't see coming but the rest of the book was pretty much more of the same old same old.<br /><br />It was entertaining once I go into it and The Lost Symbol is a perfect long plane ride book. I can't sleep on planes so I often read a book or two on those grueling 10 hour plane rides.<br /><br />I'd definitely wait for the paperback.
B000002UA5|5.0|I have owned Ummagumma (on vinyl) since it's release (I was about 12 then) , and on all other mediums since. Ummagumma revealed the band's musical (including classical leaning) abilities, and whisked me to imaginary locales, while meditating with my headphones on. Prior to owning Ummagumma, I used my meager allowance to purchase Atom Heart Mother, and fell hard for Pink Floyd. Astronomy Domine was like a trip on a spaceship, Careful with that Axe Eugene is nightmare-chilling. The band used every musical instrument available, and had no qualms about experimenting with melds of longhair classics, improvised in their own personal psychadelic style. Awesome, just awesome. I have turned on many acquaintences to this music, who didn't know Pink Floyd pre-Dark Side of the Moon.
B002HNA95E|3.0|Don't need to talk about the songs. You know them. However, I will just say that I was 10 when Madonna's first album was released, and I have basically grown up with her throughout the years. I am not a rabid Madonna fan, just own all of her albums plus The Immaculate Collection. This compilation feels rushed and haphazard.<br /><br />I have to say that the sequencing of the songs is not to my liking. I would have preferred chronological order--I want to hear an artist develop. I want the original album versions only--no edits, no remixes, no video versions. I want ALL of the hits major and minor plus key album tracks. So the bottom line is: Madonna should have put out a box set--easily three or four discs. Also, the remastering is uneven on this compilation. I've heard far better remastering done on other artists. Madonna is a superstar, and she should have excellent remastered sound like Michael Jackson does.<br /><br />My greatest hits would go something like this:<br /><br />Disc 1:<br /><br />1. Everybody 4:54*<br />2. Holiday 6:10*<br />3. Borderline 5:21*<br />4. Lucky Star 5:37*<br />5. Burning Up 3:45*<br />6. Like A Virgin 3:38*<br />7. Material Girl 4:00*<br />8.

0385504225|1.0|I don't have much more to add to what others have already said.  \\"Lost Symbol\\" was terrible and I definitely recommend that if you really feel the need to read it, you wait until most of our copies show up for sale at a used book store.  As another reviewer said, it was a page turner but for all the wrong reasons.  The only reason I could get through it was because I started to play \\"point out the errors\\" and \\"who is the least likable and believable character\\".  From the beginning, I was set on edge because of the the locational inaccuracies and errors and (without writing spoilers for people who've not yet read the book) the powers ascribed to specific government organizations.  Has Dan Brown ever bothered to come to D.C.?  Anyone with a computer and google can figure out how long it takes to get from Dulles Airport to where Robert Langdon heads next and which organization is responsible for what.  Dan Brown was sloppy and should have done better research. This book reads like he's been so absorbed soaking up fame and fortune with DaVinci Code that he missed his deadline and then wrote most of Lost Symbol one drunken weekend.  While I didn't think DaVinci Code was incredibly well written, Brown showed us then that he was exceptionally creative and a master story teller.  I think so many of us have been waiting for Lost Symbol, just knowing the story and plot were going to be masterfully crafted.  What a waste of time and money!  Dan Brown owes me $16 and a few hours of my life that I won't get back!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This was probably one of the best DVD purchases I have made in a long time.  If you like Pink Floyd and are a little standoffish of watching a 4 hour long DVD of then in concert.  The time flies by with every song you love and to see them perform the greatest songs is hands down amazing.  For under 20.00 with shipping included you can't go wrong.
B000SQKZKG|5.0|This is a classic live album. I've never heard more talent and energy come out of any band before. Great remastered version by Shout Factory. Starts off with \\"Hoedown\\", every review states that it is played too fast. Huh? The faster version is more exciting. Then Keith announces that they're going \\"to get into a little Brain Salad Surgery\\", which is met with thunderous applause. How many bands get THAT reaction from new material? Most people come to hear the \\"old stuff\\".....\\"Jerusalem\\" is great on this album, Greg's vocals are beautiful. He was blessed with the most awesome voice in all of progressive rock. Not to mention being a founding member of both King Crimson and ELP. This qualifies him for a special detached wing in the Progressive Hall of Fame (if there ever was one). The complete, extended, perfectly played version of \\"Tarkus\\", taken from the Anaheim Convention Center show, is the main reason you have to purchase this CD. I attended this show and all 3 members of the band took turns completely blowing us away. Keith had a portable keyboard and jumped off the stage and ran down the center aisle poking his instrument into peoples' delighted faces. Emerson the showman was unmatched. \\"Piano Improvisions\\" proves that he has as much total command of the piano as his array of sythns and other keyboards. His favorite is the Hammond B-3, he always turns to play it at the best moments. This is how the Hammond should be played. \\"Karn Evil 9\\" is awesome on this album, much better than the studio version if this is possible. At the end of the very long song, Keith's massive cordboard moves to the front of the stage BY ITSELF and begins to spin.....it then blows up! Too much! The lights go up and the 3 of them are standing there with towels waving goodnight. The album doesn't even include the encore, which was \\"The Great Gates of Kiev\\"....didn't fit onto the vinyl, which was already a triple LP. I've always wished that the band would have FILMED this unforgettable tour.The professionalism and talent were immense. This was one of the all-time greatest bands ever and this CD should be in your collection. Compare this to anything that has come out in the last 30 years. There is no comparison.

B000AM1TGC|5.0|By far one of the most touching epics in all of prog history. Voyage has been a part of my inner soul for many many years. If you have never heard Hackett you will not only be introduced to the master but will just begin to get a glimpse of the genius. If stuck on a desert island and had only one album to pick I would not think twice to have Voyage with me!
B001FSDOZO|1.0|A lot of music groups become more refined and unique with time... Nickelback apparently learns nothing from the past.  Chad put down the bottle and grow up.  How many songs about sex and drugs with nothing unique do we need in one album.  I have loved your past music but let me put it in terms that even the new and with Mutt's help NOT improved Nickelback can understand, \\"Dark Horse SUCKS!\\"  No originality and foul lyrics.  What kind of crap is \\"Something in your mouth\\"?  What discerning individuals want that garbage?  Nickelback has serious talent, but what a waste this is.  When Nickelback comes out with another album, I know that I will not rush out to buy it without knowing what I am getting into after this drivel.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|I am a huge Alice in Chains fan. I am always skeptical when bands try to replace their singers and move on, doing this has very rarely been a successful move in my opinion...but I gotta say, Layne lives on in William Duvall. Wow.  Seeing Alice in Chains play live, I closed my eyes and just listened...William emulates Layne so well, I could have been fooled - is he channeling him from the other side somehow?! I know this is the bands first recording since Layne died almost 15 years ago... and from the very first listen, I was floored. Jerry Cantrell captures a sound that is even below \\"the brown sound\\"; creating a darker yet brighter sound all at once, as only Jerry can. He has created his own new color palette of sound...Black Gives Way to Blue captures the classic essence of A.I.C and at the same time it provides the listener with a fresh twist that matches the demands of today's hard rock audience. I think Layne would approve.      JayDee  10-17-2009
0307716988|5.0|This book was a very easy read. I finished the entire book in about 6 hours. I'm glad that the estate decided to ask for a re-release of the book because it's the only book out there that's written about Michael, by Michael. It touches on alot of aspects of his life that fans and most of the public already know about. But it's always good to know that he had agreed to the book being written.     The only thing I would fault the book on is that the reader is left with a feeling that there is more depth than the book allows. I suspect that this was intentional because MJ wanted to keep some things private. By the time this book was first released (1989), MJ had already spent about 25 years in show business and you would think that he would have had more to say about both his professional and personal life. You get a glimpse into his thoughts and feelings on different things that he had experienced - his time at Motown, his family, the making of Thriller, but given the enormity of what he had achieved by then, the coverage almost seems cursory.    Having said that, I gave this 5 stars because it's probably as good as it's going to get as far as an autobiography is concerned - he's gone and didn't have an opportunity to delve deeper into his life and share it with readers. It's a waste and very regretful to think how much more he could have achieved and shared had his life not ended so soon and so abruptly.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|First of all, you have to know what to expect from an album like this. I would say that I have listened the album at least 20 times since I bought it and I have to say its getting better everytime. It's not an easy/friendly listening album, but since once you are getting into it you can be sure is a masterpiece. Steven Wilson put so much effort in the production of this album, so it in incredible the atmospheres he creates...   In few words, if you like porcupine tree in all its complexity, from Lazarus through Mother Child Divided and Arriving Somewhere But Not Here, I highly recommend this album. Expect some metal riffs with Tendencies of Opeth and Nine Inch Nails for example. It's just Porcupine Tree.
0060786523|5.0|It took me twelve weeks to read all 1300+ pages of Vikram Seth's novel, A Suitable Boy, but it was worth the intense commitment.  When I read a novel, I enjoy becoming totally immersed in another world. This saga of four families in post-partition India in the early 1950s was so steeped in the sights, sounds, feelings, love interests, politics and spirituality of its characters that I felt like I was experiencing it alongside the protagonists.      The main plot revolves around a mother's frantic attempts to find \\"a suitable boy\\" for her feisty young daughter, Lata.  My interest in seeing what happens to Lata kept me motivated to keep reading, even when I couldn't understand all the subtleties of politics and history.  The familiar dance to the altar gives author Vikram Seth a vehicle to display how the characters are affected by issues of race, class and gender in this cultural context. Like my favorite novelist, Jane Austen, Seth does a wonderful job of plotting to get people who don't like each other in the same room and making satirical observations. Although they are wearing different clothing and speaking with a different accent than my own, I could swear I've been to dinner parties with the chattering Chatterjis or Lata's mother.    Those who are simply seeking the romantic buzz of a Jane Austen novel may not have the patience to stick with this dense book, but I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to spend time with a fascinating group of people.
0385504225|2.0|I was extremely disappointed with this long awaited sequel to some of Mr. Brown's other great books. The entire story lack any intrigue. The end seemed to ramble with no clear mystery or purpose to the store. The characters were not very interesting or believable.  After reading the book, I was left very disappointed with the story! A co-workder read the book and felt similarly.  This book almost seemed more forced as a work, sort of like he was paid and HAD to come up with something?  I have no idea how they will make an interesting movie out of this one!

B000001E18|5.0|I am not big on mainstreem music, but you have to give it to U2: they were on the very top and took risks uneeded. Zooropa is the riskiest of all, and is their best album<br /><br />This takes the electronics of Actung Baby a step up, giving the music a glimmering hue as opposed to treatments of individual instruments. The title track features a ghostly dome with synathsized wha wha guitar. \\"Baby Face\\" seems like a love song, but is a fever dream love song with its chiming keyboards and ecchoing drumbeat. \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car\\" is industrial at is creepiest--at least in mainstreem rock--and \\"Far Away, So Close\\" is a sad number with its dampered guitars--flat as a pancake and showing the worness U2 probably felt comming off the road.<br /><br />Europe was uniting when Zooropa arrived in 1993, but neo-Naziism was on the rise. Genoside was unanswered in Bosnia. There was a dark chaotic underbelly afoot as we celebrated the end of the cold war. In Africa, Al Qudia was already incubating plots.<br /><br />None of these topics are addressed directly on this album, but the hillucination feel of the album, the sense of scattered pieces that can become sharp and dangerous, lurks just beneath the surface of Zooropa. \\"I don't know the limits of what we've got\\" says Bono on track one, and he was right. Zooropa is a creepy record, and U2s move of talking about these issues without talking about them, is their masterstroke.<br /><br />Listen to the alarm bell that goes off at the very end. U2 may not have been able to predict Septeber 11th or Iraq, but they had a finger on the dangers when the world becomes a more complicated, fragmented place.
1878424602|5.0|I am not a fan of Deepak Chopra but enjoy these types of book.  A friend gave me a copy and I read it based on his recommendation and the fact that this is such a short one.    I am glad I read this book because there are some very important lessons here.      The \\"laws\\" as I understand them:    1. You are pure potential  2. What do you want?  Give it to others and get more in return.  3. What goes around comes around.  Plant good seeds.  4. There is ease within all things in life.  5. Intention makes things happen the quickest.  Desire, because of attachment, limits things.   6. Detachment - Do the \\"next right thing\\" and forget the outcome.  7. Everybody has a purpose.  Follow it.    Probably things you have heard before, but I think he did a good job of explaining them and pointing out some things that many people wouldn't consider.    I think there is a lot of value in this book.  It's making me reconsider Deepak Chopra and I'm going to pick up some of his other works.
B000002I4S|5.0|It made sense for John Coltrane to record Giant Stpes in 1960. After spending years recording standards and hard bop, Coltrane was finally able to write music that matched his technical abilities.<br /><br />Let's talk about that technical ability for a minute. The theme to remember, always, with Coltrane, is that he studied so hard, he internalized every scale, every inversion of every chord. Down to the nuance. He could take the most complex chords, 13ths with a flat fourth in the bass, and rocket around them as if it were do-ri-mi. He knew every detour and back alley. The western musical encylopedia was not in his head, it was in his fingers. When he mastered this, he went to eastern modalities, and I am sure got full command of those.<br /><br />Finally he writes Giant Steps. Music that matches this massive ability. He stoped trying to lead the listener into the solo, and blasted through the intros, heads, in jazz terms, so he could spin his magic, and the more he played, the more direct he became. Coltrane does not go to you, you go to him, if fortunate enough.<br /><br />Take the title track. The complex chords change each beat, yet Coltrane moves though them at 1000 mph. weaving his endless permutations. His ability is beyond stunning, and if there is any critisism, it is only that he is moving so fast you don't realize the technical magic of what he is doing. Even on a blues like \\"Cousin Mary,\\" he is more interested in moving through the intro as quick as he can so he can get to work. If you can't keep up, though, check out his spare playing on \\"Niama\\" which later became one of his best avant gaurde vehicales.<br /><br />For jazz purists, a little blasphamy: the only equal Coltrane had as a solo player was Frank Zappa. The music is almost unrelated but let's deconstruct this for a second. Both men refused to rest, even for a beat, and worked as many notes into their solos as they could. Yet they could make so many permutations, the playing never got boring. Both understood the blues on a primal level, and was able to take their solos and spin the form into endless permutations. Both even have intersting little sounds they make getting from note to note, and are the only players that, after all these years, have me cuing my CD to the second, trying to answer \\"what the hell was that.\\"<br /><br />After this, Trane went to Impulse, and threw out chords for modes, where he could spin his web in open spaces without having to anticipate the next bar.<br /><br />It is almost as if he had to move beyond his own musical expertise to find the next step.rimal level, and was able to take their solos and spin the form into endless permutations.

B0025KVLVA|5.0|The \\"Past Masters\\" two-CD set is great because it includes many of the most popular Beatles' songs like \\"Strawberry Fields\\" and \\"Penny Lane\\" - songs that were singles but were never released as part of the British albums (and thus not released on the CDs which followed the British format).  However, what I like most about \\"Past Masters\\" is the fact that it includes several hard-to-find Beatles' songs that are usually not included on compilation albums (like \\"The Beatles 1\\").      \\"Rain\\" and \\"Across the Universe\\" are two of my absolute favorite songs, but \\"Rain\\" is very hard to find.  It appears on disc 2, along with an early single version of \\"Across the Universe\\" released as part of a compilation album to raise money  for the World Wildlife Fund.  It is a very different mix to the version later released on \\"Let It Be\\".  I think these two songs alone would have made it worth the purchase price for me.  Add them to the very early singles that begin disc 1 (which include \\"Komm, Gib Mir Diene Hand\\" and \\"Sie Liebt Dich\\" - \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" and \\"She Loves You\\" recorded in German)and this 2-disc set becomes a must for any Beatles fan!  I've been listening so much lately that my three-year-old immediately asks \\"Is this the Beatles?\\" as soon as the car radio comes on!
B0029O08WA|5.0|The ability to use 100% original material in a soundtrack is a lost art, this soundtrack absolutely does that while retaining all of the emotional aspects that it needed to for this film/book. Then on top of all of that, they use all these indie artists that are truly great at what they do. What a great soundtrack, will be a keeper in my collection for years to come.

B002S0OBFK|4.0|I couldn't avoid the massive hype before forking over my money to see the film that many called the scariest movie ever made. I sat down in my seat prepared to jump at least a few times before the end credits, but it only gave me one mild jolt at the very end. That's not say that Paranormal Activity isn't creepy, it really is. It's neat how a few loud noises or a flick of a light switch in the middle of the night (there are a few more elaborate gags than these as the film progresses) creates more tension than any big budget horror film in years. I got goosebumps a couple of times and the less is more approach (whether due the whopping $11,000 budget or not) made it much more unsettling. The Jaws rule of the less you see, the scarier it is, definitely applies here. Comparisons to The Blair Witch Project make sense. They are both horror films, shot dirt cheap (though Blair Witch had twice the budget) and have the same documentary like style. Only in this case, I was happy to find none of those frantic camera movements that made so many people want to hurl leaving the theater back in 1999. The two main cast members are unknown, but they were much better than expected. The dude got on my nerves a little at times and the arguing got tiresome in between the night scares, but they were successful in seeming like real people documenting the paranormal, not actors.<br /><br />Paranormal Activity is slow moving, especially the first half, and it doesn't live up to the hype, but I envy those who just recently heard about this little movie. I saw it with a small crowd and I'm sure it would have been more enjoyable with a packed theater (unless it's full of stupid teens laughing at everything). I liked it quite an bit and unlike The Blair Witch Project, I can see this one becoming a minor classic.

1593082479|3.0|treasure island, By Robert Louis Stevenson, is an island filled with gold. The main settings are in Great Brittan, the ocean, and Treasure Island. The time period is in the 1700's. The main characters are Jim Hawkins, John Trelawny, and Long John Silvers. The major conflict is when Long John Silvers plans a mutinty against John Trelawny. one of the many parts of rising action is when the Hispaniola set sail from Bristol. The climax is when they found the treasure. This book was very believable.     Treasure island was very descriptive in its writing. The characters are very well developed. All characters stars out friendly untill you get to read more about them. long john silvers was a really nice guy untill jim overheard him talking about planninng a mutiny. 'Captain Smollett as he refuses to negotiate with Silver. \\"But one man of her crew alive. What put to sea with seventy-five.\\" The theme of the book is the theme is don't trust anybody with a certain task. Things can change in  a heartbeat. I did not really enjoy the book but i would recomend it to certain people.
B001DCN178|4.0|I purchased this Midi Controller when an older controller I owned no longer worked properly.  I was also looking for an audio interface and found that this keyboard had both.  I had never purchased anything by Behringer before and when doing my research I found that many people consider Behringer a bit of a joke.  However, it seems that in recent years that Behringer has really improved the quality of their products.  Specifically, I found some great online reviews for this unit that really praised the price versus performance value for this controller.    For starters, you get ALOT for your money.  The device comes with a gig bag, straps, cables, a headphone/microphone and the built-in audio interface.  The headphone/microphone works just fine but the build quality is a bit cheap.  However, the actual Midi Controller is incredibly solid and looks fantastic.  There's plenty of control built into the unit.  My only real complaint is that the velocity response of the keyboard is a bit shallow.  There's not a great deal of range, even though it certainly does transmit velocity information.    What I really like is that the gig bag carries everything.  When I travel, I can pack the keyboard, cables, headphone/mic and there's still enough room for my netbook too.  What I found frustrating, is that I found I needed to purchase a seperate mixer to really utilize the built in audio interface to its best advantage.  Thankfully, there are many inexpensive mixers available that are perfect for the budget musician.    All in all however, I feel this is a really good deal and I'm very happy with it.
B00005RHF8|5.0|Just as so many others have said, you can take our word for it that this is a poorly made DVD of, in my opinion, the best of the Jane Eyre movies. I've seen them all except possibly the earliest one. Most are good, some very good but the character of Rochester has never played than by George C Scott. Superb. I bought this because Netflicks doesn't carry it and for good reason. Unless you love the book and therefore are looking for a movie that captures the essence of the book, you wouldn't want to own this poor excuse for a DVD. The fault lies with the maker of the DVD not the excellent original work.

0786868724|2.0|I did not ever read Tuesdays With Morrie, a book that has been described as \\"The bestselling memoir of all time.\\" I find that claim a little difficult to believe, but I suppose that the eleven million copies in print may prove it correct. From the pen of that same author, Mitch Albom, now comes Have a Little Faith, a book that shot straight to the top of the New York Times list of bestsellers within days of its release. Like its predecessor, this book is probably best-termed a memoir, a book that describes the impact of a pair of clergymen on the life of the author.<br /><br />The book begins with a request. An eighty-two year-old rabbi from Albom's hometown asks if he will deliver his eulogy. This leads Albom on a quest to learn enough about the man that he can deliver an effective eulogy. This in turn draws him back to a consideration of the Jewish faith he had walked away from as a young adult. At the same time, near his new home in Detroit, he encounters a pastor who, despite a past in which he was a drug dealer and convict, is leading a ministry that serves the poor and destitute. The book alternates between these two worlds, between these two faiths and Albom's attempts to get to know both of the men.<br /><br />Have a Little Faith is a well-written and interesting book that has already been widely praised. The endorsements on the book's cover range from Bob Dole to Bishop T.D. Jakes; from Rabbi Harold Kushner to Coach Tony Dungy. The book reflects the diversity of the endorsers, seeking to emphasize what unites these faiths and all others. It is a defense of the kind of faith that is so popular today-a type of religious belief that de-emphasizes distinctives and plays up the importance of unity. It is a book about religion, about faith in general, more than it is a book about the Christian faith. Unfortunately but undoubtedly, it is a book that could easily comfort a person in a faith that excludes Jesus Christ. And in that way it is a book that misrepresents the Bible, for the Scriptures will not allow for such a faith. The Bible demands exclusivity, it demands that we understand that Jesus Christ is the only way to the Father.<br /><br />So I guess the irony in Have a Little Faith is that the unity Albom purports to find between all faiths is a unity that comes at the expense of at least one of those faiths. It is a unity that cannot be sustained or supported by one who holds fast to the Bible. This is a book that makes for a quick and enjoyable read, but in its moral, its great theme, it falls tragically flat. It tickles the ear of those who read it, but does not strike straight to the great truths of the Christian faith.the Scriptures will not allow for such a faith. The Bible demands exclusivity, it demands that we understand that Jesus Christ is the only way to the Father.    So I guess the irony in Have a Little Faith is that the unity Albom purports to find between all faiths is a unity that comes at the expense of at least one of those faiths. It is a unity that cannot be sustained or supported by one who holds fast to the Bible. This is a book that makes for a quick and enjoyable read, but in its moral, its great theme, it falls tragically flat.

This was a good example of that, except i don't think they suffered enough. Placing his head in the microwave was good, except he didn't give him a chance to beg for his life, and then take it. I recommend this film especially if your a parent.

0061719544|2.0|Ferguson is, of course, the host of The Late Late Show, one of those staples of late night television that airs way past my bedtime. Ferguson was chosen to take over the reins from Craig Kilborn when he stepped aside in 2004. A native of Scotland who boasts a thick, Glasgow accent, Ferguson was always a long shot. But his zany sense of humor and his ability to lead compelling interviews eventually landed him the position over many competitors. American on Purpose tells how he got there and does so under the rather thin veneer of the joys of becoming a U.S. citizen.<br /><br />The book, like its subject, is profane and obnoxious. Growing up in working-class Glasgow, Ferguson was introduced early to alcohol and, hot on its heels, drugs. He gave himself over to both and for decades they dominated his life. Despite his addictions, he put together a career as an actor and comedian-a career that eventually brought him to the United States. After acting in a handful of films, many of which were far from successful, and after years spent in a recurring role on The Drew Carey Show, he was offered his current position as host of The Late Late Show. Along the way he drank endless amounts of alcohol, inhaled vast quantities of drugs, successfully passed through rehab, slept with countless women, married three times, got rich and became a celebrity. All of this is described in the 270 pages of his memoir.<br /><br />The book's title, American on Purpose, refers to Ferguson's decision to pursue American citizenship, something he accomplished in 2008, though he chose to hold on to his British citizenship as well. in the book's final chapter he says, \\"America truly is the best idea for a country that anyone has ever come up with so far\\" and offers a few words of explanation about his love for the nation. But beyond that, there is little in the book that really explains the title. It is, I think, a bit of a gimmick.<br /><br />This celebrity memoir, as with so many like it, will probably only appeal to people who are fans of its subject or people who have to endure long airplane rides and brought along only the one book. If you enjoy The Late Late Show and are a fan of Craig Ferguson, I can understand why you might want to read it. I'll grant that there is some value to be had in hearing about how an addict has learned to overcome his addictions. Yet even then I doubt you will find much there to enjoy. It is just another celebrity memoir, filled with drugs and alcohol and tales of sexual conquest and inevitable divorces. It is a big yawn.ple who are fans of its subject or people who have to endure long airplane rides and brought along only the one book.

It tells us of the struggles John Paul II had to deal with during his papacy, between the Soviets trying to kill him, to the so-called \\"enlightened\\" West trying to dilute his message of love for God and for peace.  The forgiveness he shows to his enemies, and the heartbreak in Piotr Adamczyk's eyes when so much inhumanity, is shown, from Mafia hits to 9/11.  Plus we see the final struggle he fought to stay alive to continue his work on Earth.  Put this on your list.

If you lived your life as these words are written we would have a much better life,and a much better world with a lot less mayhem and quandry.

B000RIWAVW|5.0|Well first off, if you were able to get past the cheesy pun I used in my title, thank you! John Carpenter's \\"Halloween\\" is one the all-time horror movie classics, and one of the very first slasher films in horror movie history. Whether or not it was THE first slasher film, a title that's up for grabs between this movie, the original \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" (1974) and the original \\"Black Christmas\\" (1976), and even \\"Blood Feast\\" (1963), it's a debatable topic.<br /><br />However, whether or not \\"Halloween\\" is the absolute first slasher, it's still one of the very best. Why? Simply put, \\"Halloween\\" is a movie where everything is done right. There's plenty of character development throughout the movie, the suspense builds as the movie progresses, and unlike in some other horror films, everything that should have an explanation is given (shown in the first scene with Michael Myers as a child, etc.) Another thing I like about this movie is that the whole film is a steady incline towards the end, which is quite the slasher climax! Also, while it's able to build up progressively and draw you in more and more, it's still able to perfect the slasher formula of killing off more and more people throughout the entire course of the film.<br /><br />As I stated before, \\"Halloween\\" is a slasher film where everything was done right, unlike certain remakes. In addition, the DVD comes with plenty of extras and you even get to choose between a widescreen and fullscreen format. Overall, this is a great version of the DVD with one of the utmost best horror films ever done. I'm sure most horror fans have seen this movie, but if not, it's very highly recommended. Buy it in time for Halloween, kick back, and let that theme music remind you what a joyous, scary time it is! Thanks for the time, and peace.

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I did not enjoy this book as much as Dan Brown's others, especially just having finished Angels and Demons, which I thought was outstanding.  This book had way too much scientific jargon, along with leaving me with the idea that there was going to be some huge revelation at the end of the story.  Very disappointing.  Not sure I would recommend it as a good read.  Too much hype for the little bit of story behind it.

B002KDUDG6|4.0|Favorite Songs: \\"At This Moment\\", \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\", \\"Cry Me A River\\", \\"Georgia On My Mind\\"    I love Buble - just love, love, love him! I own all of his studio albums and many of his DVD/special projects. As a lover of all things Buble; I wanted to love this ablum the way I loved \\"Its Time.\\" But I just can't, no matter how many spins I give this cd.     \\"Crazy Love\\" is somewhat of a dissapointment for this Buble fan. Buble's latest cd is very hit-or-miss for me; out of thirteen tracks, I really like and enjoy only six. I think three of the songs are \\"ok\\" or \\"so-so\\" and I hate the other four (\\"All of Me\\", \\"All I Do Is Dream of You\\", \\"Stardust\\", and \\"Whatever It Takes\\").     The sound on this album is very \\"classic\\" Buble; there is nothing too daring, suprising, or different on this album from any of his past cds. If you enjoy Buble's ability to take old standards and make them feel \\"new\\", then you will like this album. The major difference between \\"Crazy Love\\" and \\"Its Time\\" (or even \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\") is that many of the song choices and arrangements on \\"Crazy Love\\" do not appeal to me and do not make the most of Buble's voice. In fact, it's Buble's wonderful vocals that save this album from being mediocre. It took Buble two years to create \\"Crzay Love\\", yet it seems like he should have been able up to come up with better material in that time - too many songs sound like fillers!    But, as a true Buble fan, I will continue to stand by my man!
1905654294|1.0|I'm not too far into this final part of the saga (about 200 pages), but I have to say that I'm already immensely disappointed.  It hasn't been a huge secret (to me) as to how the story ends, so I won't spoil it for others. However, Meyer was holding strong on the character development for the first three books (even though I feel Bella's character is portrayed as very childish and selfish) and obviously lost her steam for this one. So sad.  I'm seriously tempted to write my own version.
B002K0WBXW|3.0|This movie has a lot of good actors and actresses who do a decent acting job. However, the storyline seems like a collection of typical romantic movie situations cobbled together into something that isn't very meaningful.<br /><br />The movie is supposed to be about two people who don't get along and have an abusive one-way relationship at work, but who, through a series of events, end up falling in love. My first complaint is that Sandra Bullock is misused in this movie. She is one of my favorite actresses in romantic comedies, but she is always at her best when she's the sweet, innocent-girl type. In this movie she is supposed to be the tough, driven boss everyone hates. She never really effectively gets out of that mode and the so the eventual happy scene at the end seems a little unbelievable. My second complaint is that rather than developing a good storyline that focuses on character and relationship development between the two characters, the movie seems to go for a montage of the typical plot devices for this type of movie. There's the crazy old grandma, the conflict between dad and son over career choices, the discovery that one of the characters was really from a rich family, the scene where the two that supposedly hate each other have a forced kiss that ends up being nice, the scene where the two that hate each other accidentally end up undressed, the scene where the grandma suffers a heart attack and everyone has a change of heart, the scene where the guy realizes too late he loves the girl and goes chasing after her and the list goes on. The problem is that the movie seems to want to pile up all of the \\"expected\\" scenes for this type of movie rather than focusing on a meaningful story so that in the end, the happy resolution seems like it comes out of left field.<br /><br />The production quality and acting in the movie are pretty decent, so if you like this kind of romantic comedy this movie is probably worth taking a look at. If you are expecting a top Sandra Bullock movie that will rank up there with While You Were Sleeping or Two Week's Notice, you will probably be disappointed.ck movie that will rank up there with While You Were Sleeping or Two Week's Notice, you will probably be disappointed.
B002MW50KO|5.0|Oct 30 UPDATE: The more you hear it, the better it gets!<br /><br />If y'all don't \\"get\\" Dylan, then you gonna be disappointed, but this release will guarantee a COOL YULE for the rest of us.  Anyone complaining about the dude's voice is following the oddest cliche to plague Bob since he began recording.  This ain't \\"American Idol\\" material for you to judge, you either get Dylan or you don't.  There is so much passion and dare I say FUN in all he has released in the last decade, and having just seen him in concert this week in Hollywood, there isn't anyone alive or dead that has a better catalog of material, BOTH older and more recent to draw from.<br /><br />Regarding this holiday release, I would argue with a few of the song selections.  As a producer, I would have beefed up the production and played with the arrangements, but how the heck can you NOT have fun listening to this album?  I've read quite a few \\"professional\\" reviews of this release in the press, and you can tell the folks who actually listened to the WHOLE recording and those who sampled it.<br /><br />As soon as a reviewer starts in on his \\"croak\\" you know they don't know where it's at.  You want perfect pitch, buy Streisand.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and listen to \\"Must Be Santa\\" all the way through for the Reindeer Roll Call near the end...Bob is having a blast and he was when I saw him in concert as well.  This isn't some old croaky dude cashing in on his past...it's a vibrant soul who is still more interested in reaching out and touching his audience than sitting back doing nothing or touring just to rehash the hits.<br /><br />I, for one, am tired of people trying to \\"judge\\" the man because that's all so irrelevant.  You accept what he has to offer and go along on the journey...because...it's always worth it with Dylan.  As with all of his recording in the last decade, this Christmas album is LOADED with fun.  Dylan is NOT some serious poet preaching to a world gone wrong, Bob is a BLAST!  It's NOT about seeing him as a legend, as a genius or as some silly \\"rock god\\" - I truly enjoy the groove he's been in recently and this album is PURE HOLIDAY FUN!as a genius or as some silly \\"rock god\\" - I truly enjoy the groove he's been in recently and this album is PURE HOLIDAY FUN!
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|A few evenings ago, I had the great pleasure of introducing my four year old daughter to Walt Disney's SNOW WHITE.  Let me tell you, SNOW WHITE is still a true classic - beautiful, charming, and quite amazing even all these years later.  And the joy of sharing it with my wee one made it even more special.<br /><br />I don't think that I have seen SNOW WHITE in probably close to 40 years.  While I remember the basic story - who doesn't? - there are many snippets and scenes that I had forgotten.  Watching this latest, lovely version with my daughter snuggled in my lap, the forgotten scenes and songs came flooding back, and my daughter and I found ourselves singing along together.  The music of SNOW WHITE clearly crosses the generations with ease.  Old favorites, such \\"Some Day My Prince Will Come\\" and \\"Heigh Ho,\\" sail across the years and are as fun and memorable as ever.  My little princess was entranced by this film, and, I have to admit, so was I.<br /><br />It is astonishing to realize that SNOW WHITE was released in 1937, and that it was Disney's first full length animated feature film.  The story, the art, the animation, and the music have all stood the test of time, and still rank near the top with the best of the Disney films.  This latest version is bright and sharp; quite simply, it is exquisite.<br /><br />Everyone born after 1937 was basically raised on SNOW WHITE.  I am so glad that Disney has rereleased it for yet another generation.  I can just picture great-grandmothers, grandmothers, mothers, aunts, daughters, and sisters all sitting down together to watch this movie, introducing it to the latest little princess in the family.  And that, most certainly, is the true definition of a classic family film.
B002HWBS96|4.0|Starting with the reason why this is a vital purchase for any Renee Fleming fan (or even any fan of a great singer / actor)--it may be the best thing she has ever done.  She uses every dynamic, every color, every movement, every reaction to her fellow singers you can imagine to create a one-of-a-kind &#34;living&#34; woman, and a few ideas you probably won't expect.  (The last minute of Act One is infinitely touching without a note sung...just to name one.)  If you are a fan of hers, you will find nothing to complain about and so much to admire--the tricky mixture of sadness, irritation, pain, love, and even a touch of humor that makes up the final meeting of Octavian in Act One.  She does not &#34;milk&#34; the monologue about the clocks, which makes it all the more touching.  Her final appearance in the opera, including the heartbreak of the Trio, is a marvel to watch and hear.  In its subtlety and range and originality, her Marschallin is unmatched.  Really, this is a truly great operatic portrayal, to rank with and even surpass the wonderful Schwarzkopf in the famous filmed version, in at least one aspect. Fleming certainly seems more &#34;girlish&#34;--Octavian would not fall in love with a &#34;mature&#34; woman. He sees no difference between them, age or otherwise.  Important and usually ignored, especially by a few too many people who swear they know Rosenkavalier backward and forward. Why do so many of them think the Marschallin is a middle-aged woman? The comic roles (certainly &#34;buffo&#34; and played broadly) mostly work very well and though Hawlata is far from the greatest &#34;singer&#34; of Ochs, he is lovably obnoxious and even rather pathetic when confronted with his own foolishness. He seems within the character word for word and it shows. His vocal shortcomings are not so grave as to keep you from enjoying him. And Jonas Kaufmann is quite funny as a tenor who brings in paparazzi as well as an agent!  The conducting by Thielemann is free from the&#34;squareness&#34; that sometimes mars his conducting.  He is flexible and free and follows the singers like a glove. When a firmer hand is needed, it is there.  In fact, his control over line, shape, and dynamics to match all the singers--though most especially Fleming--is one of the best selling points of the recording.  The production is beautiful to look at, the updating unobtrusive (how often is that the case?) and the directing makes all the elements work as a frame for characters not just singers, especially the use of mirrors as a meaningful and unifying device.  A few comic pieces of business don't quite work but they are few and short and far between.  Costumes, lighting, etc. are all of a piece.  This should be a given at all times in every production, but so rarely is.  No, it is not Zeffirelli realism, but all the better for it as far as I am concerned.  (You know if you are not in agreement, so take that into consideration.)  And the &#34;problem&#34; of the young black servant which is a little too redolent of its time period--and not ours--is cleverly &#34;solved.&#34;  Now the disappointments.  And they are grave (to me...some people might not be as bothered, but I have to say what I feel.)  Neither Sophie Koch or Diana Damrau, though musical, and intelligent and characterful, sing beautifully in the highest registers--and their roles lie high much of the time.  Beautiful passages will be marred over and over by strain and shrillness.  Koch is more forgivable in Act One because she is supposed to be highly strung, but even then strain distracts.  Sadly, the next two acts get worse and worse.  Damrau is just as bad.  She has some undeniably lovely moments but she has more strained ones, culminating with her entrance in the Trio that has to be the ugliest version I have ever heard.  This is not world-class singing, no matter how many people claim it is.  I wish it were different.  She is musical and she can act.  But the singing is too often unpleasant.  She is straining, forcing the tone, no two ways about it.  And Koch's part in the Trio is not much better.  So the opera's highlight is only a highlight in Fleming's singing and acting.  A major mark against it.  Luckily, the orchestra supports the rise at the end of the Trio before the key change with such a full set of strings, the harshness of the two &#34;outer&#34; voices have their shrillness tempered some, so at least the payoff is still effective.  Disappointing, though.  VERY disappointing.  Hard to give a star rating but four stars for what is (truly) great that will hopefully help you overcome the vocal shortcomings.  NOTE:  I watched it two more times.  I liked Koch better than I did.  The last two acts lie lower, so her singing (sans Trio) is less harsh than Act One.  Still feel the same about Damrau, alas, though the final duets are lovely.  2017 -- With Fleming singing her farewell performances at the MET in Der Rosenkavalier, I decided to come back to this to see how I felt. Plus, I have better equipment than I had before. First, the DTS surround sound aids in tempering some of the harshness of the singing of Damrau and Koch. The strain is still present, but less noticeable. The voices seem more centered in the sound than placed too forward, as in the stereo track.  One of the  drawbacks to that is you hear less of the text, but with subtitles, I can live with that. (Though a few odd translations pop out. For instance: &#34;So be it&#34; is not a literal or even apt translation of &#34;In Gottes Namen&#34;.) The other drawback is sometimes the voices can be a be drowned by the orchestra, which is far less noticeable in the mere stereo. It's infrequent enough that I can live with it  The orchestra sounds even more voluptuous.  But I am still bothered by that strain. Not as much, but I can't wish it away. Shouldn't this opera be about beautiful singing as much as character, musicality, acting? Yes, I realize that my review seems a bit exaggerated due to my disappointment. Perhaps the &#34;worst version&#34; does seem a tad unhelpful. I enjoyed watching it again, especially since coming back to it, I had lower expectations. Fair? Who knows? Happily the improved sound makes a distinct difference. I do love the production. But I'll stick with four stars. BTW, I did change one line. I clarified what I meant by &#34;surpassing&#34; Schwarzkopf. I was talking about characterization. Comparing the singing of two marvelous singers is a fool's errand. I wouldn't do without either video.

0385504225|3.0|If anything, Dan Brown is a vivid storyteller. It's the way he tells the story that can either be so wonderful (Da Vinci Code) or rather mundane (The Lost Symbol).<br /><br />This story is interested, albeit a bit too long for its content. Cut 100 pages and this might have the same pacing as Da Vinci Code. But, alas, it doesn't, and here we have it in all its bulk.

1400082773|5.0|I just finished reading Barack Obama's, Dreams from My Father.  I could not put it down. Not only because it gives great insight into a man I admire but also because he tackles the topic of personal identity and race. There were so many opportunities to both learn and identify from his story.    One of the reasons I have always liked Mr. Obama is that I sense in him a person who knew who he was. He had claims to a unique perspective of race. We all live in a society of black and white. And most of us only have one perspective. We have to deduce from a slanted view point the other sides. But Mr. Obama struggled personally from both sides. He could see the prejudices, short sightedness, ignorance and naivete from both perspectives that perpetuate racism, fear and distrust. And with this knowledge he had to figure out who he was. He is honest in his struggle to understand a father he hardly knew. He grew up in a white household, mother and grandparents who did their best at loving and teaching him well. But he grappled with his identity as a young black man. Claiming either extreme, black or white, would deny his family or his ancestry. And in the end he forms himself into a man to be admired and awed. His struggle for identity mirrors the struggle of every individual who grows from childhood to adulthood and must make sense of the hurts, ambiguities and scars of days gone by.    I am thrilled that he trusted his own voice in telling the story. Since I hear him often in news reels I know his voice. So it was easy for me to hear him telling the story in my head as he read. He let me right into his mind... to the grappling and tossing and turning of thoughts, beliefs and values. I am proud to live in a country where the story of a whole nation can be expressed in the reflections of this one man. He claims us as his own. Barack Obama, I claim you too.

Once you get over laughing at the very manly men that are playing these femine parts & doing a great job of it..lol  You will laugh & cry because of its innocence and it just fills your heart & spirit with warmth. While its a comedy it also touches on some very real, serious problems going on within families & communities. I recommend this movie!

B001PPLIFU|5.0|5 of 5 stars for the James Bond 007 action movie: Quantum of Solace. As with every other James Bond movie, you can expect rich big settings with grand sweeping action, exotic international locations and insanely big action. QoS is on par with other Bond movies but is not in my top 10 list.<br /><br />QoS follows the events following Casino Royale (the remake of a few years ago, not the comedy version of the 70's). Daniel Craig plays Bond in both CR and QoS. He is a good, though not great, version of Bond. I do like Judi Dench as \\"M\\". She is strong, solid and believeable in the role. The key point to this movie is a new secret organization which MI6 learns of the hard-way. The organization is named Quantum of Solace. QoS turns out to be primarily a \\"business\\" organization trying thru illegal means to extract extreme profits from a country. The story has Bond jumping around the world to chase after the bad guys. The downside to this movie is that QoS doesn't really form as a group and the \\"big bad guys\\" are not as grand as in other Bond movies.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray of this is stunning with extreme sound quality. Further it is packed with extra contents. I was wondering how they blew-up that hotel. Even with the limitations I mentioned, this is a 5 star movie and well worth the time to watch it.
B002NC8JEC|5.0|The Jackson 5 sang and danced their way into your hearts; and their music was incomparable. I really like this album; it has a lot of fine tracks with Michael's singing often being highlighted--I miss him. This group never turned out anything less than perfect holiday music and just one listen proves it. The quality of the sound is very good and the artwork is great.<br /><br />\\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" features The Jackson 5 doing great justice to this classic number. I really like this version; they play with the tempo and the keys to put their own stamp on this song and it works. \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\" features Michael Jackson's voice coming through nice and clear; Michael could really sing and he never lets go of a superfluous note! The backup he gets from the rest of The Jackson 5 is perfect, too. \\"The Christmas Song\\" charms me with its natural beauty; these pros do this beautifully and I always enjoy this song when they perform it. \\"Frosty The Snowman\\" also has Michael doing his part flawlessly; and the entire group never sounded better.<br /><br />\\"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" uses the percussion to great advantage; and listen also for \\"Christmas Won't Be the Same This Year.\\" It's a melancholy tune but the Jackson 5 makes it shine bright anyway. That's quite a feat! \\"Give Love At Christmas Day\\" and \\"\\"Someday At Christmas\\" are probably my two favorite numbers on this CD; The Jackson 5 perform these songs with panache and both songs move me greatly. Michael sounds awesome on \\"Someday at Christmas.\\" In addition, \\"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\\" has little Michael Jackson squarely in the spotlight--and he does this very skillfully! What a genius talent he had.<br /><br />\\"Little Christmas Tree\\" is quite touching and poignant; this is a strong highlight of the album. The stripped mix of \\"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" sounds just great; and I also like the stripped mix of \\"Someday at Christmas\\" that showcases Michael singing with a skill and polish that we normally hear only from the most seasoned of performers--incredible!<br /><br />There are also \\"season's greetings\\" messages from Michael, Tito, Jackie and Jermaine--cool! The album ends strong with The Jackson 5 doing a \\"J5 Christmas Medley.\\" It's a good way to end the CD.<br /><br />This is, of course, a wonderful holiday album for any fan of The Jackson 5.

The element of mystery and symbolism and great questions that have always bothered mankind were artfully interwoven in the storyline. It really got me thinking about supernaturality/ religion/science / etc.    this is a must read. I also liked the fact that the vhapters are so short.
0439023483|5.0|i love this book. suzanne collins has surely done it! what a great book. the ending leaves you dying for more! i have not yet purchased the second book, but i can't wait. i bought the first book here at amazon.com and it arrived so fast that as soon as i got it, my daughter began to read and she couldn't set it down! my daughter started to read it and got halfway through it. then i took it one night and i stayed up all night and read it all. LOVE THIS BOOK! highly reccommended!!! my daughter also loved this book. begging me to get the 2nd book!
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I keep this CD in my car.  I love every song on the CD.  Track 4 & 7 will soon be worn out and I will have to buy another one!  This CD has to win a Grammy.  Whitney's voice is a great as it ever was.

0739319175|2.0|I thought the work was too repitous and for the most part boring! I am a great Dan Brown fan but i believe he missed the mark with this one. It will be interesting to see what Ron Howard does with this!<br />I thought \\"In the Image of His God\\" by PJShield (yours truly) a much better read!
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|It was given to a relative who had asked for it .  She seeemed happy.
0385504225|3.0|After waiting three years for his new book, I was excited to pre-order it and rip through it. His research is, as always, tremendous. That said, this was not my personal favorite of the others and I have read all of Dan Browns books. Near the end I actually put it down because the scene was so disturbing. Don't get me wrong, overall it's a good read, I was just let down. Maybe my expectations were too high. If you have any interest in Freemasonry, this is the book for you. I found the Washington tie ins very interesting. In my opinion Angels and Demons is still his best work!
0786888628|4.0|\\"The Longest Winter\\" is the story of the first winter of the Korean War, 1950-1951. CW covers the original North Korean invasion, the counterattack by the United Nations forces (\\"the \\"Inchon Landing\\"), the Chinese entry to the conflict and the ultimate stabilization of the front lines under the leadership of General Matthew Ridgeway. This critical period was the core of the Korean War.  Author Halberstam drives headlong into the full maelstrom of front line combat including heroism, military politics and some appalling failures of command. Halberstam correctly emphasizes the importance of leadership at the company and platoon levels. There are excellent background sketches of the ruling circle of the era: President Truman, Kim Il Sung, Dean Acheson, George Marshall, Joseph Stalin, Syngman Rhee, Mao Zedong, and Generals MacArthur, Almond and Ridgeway.  Personalities plainly matter to this author. Ridgeway stands out as everyman's hero and MacArthur receives the full brunt of Halberstam's sharpest barbs. Looming darkly in the background of CW is the constant drone of domestic politics.  Korea was an unpopular war and the Republicans cut President Truman no slack. What pressures HST was have faced; one can only admire the man's courage in the face of it all. There are some minor points of criticism: Maps are strong but not always conveniently placed and there are zero (!) photographs. Vietnam era readers may have no idea what many of these guys looked like. Perhaps future printings can correct these defects. Also, the author's attempts to square the circle by seeking parallels with the Vietnam conflict are downright awkward and definitely superfluous. Some might carp with CW's length but this reviewer was perfectly comfortable with the 669 pages. The bottom line is that \\"The Coldest Winter\\" is a serious, thoroughly researched book on a customarily passed over/disregarded time in this nation's military and political history.
081095415X|5.0|I am not the most eloquent of people, but Nick Brandt's work tends to make me wax more lyrical than anything else does. My wife bought me his first book a few years ago, and I literally had tears in my eyes looking through the pages. I thought that Nick would be unable to top that book, but I was wrong.   A Shadow Falls is a masterpiece of photography, and brings those who look at these images closer to the soul of the animals than any Nat Geo show ever could. Each image feels like an intimate encounter, like it's just you, and the animal, alone in the wild. You can almost sense that they know you are looking at them. They are allowing you to be so close. It's personal.  Nick does not use zoom lenses, or telephotos, so all the images bring you right up where he was. The startling detail of the king of the beasts, the lion, or the majestic herds of elephants making their treks in search of water, portrayed in a manner that tells a story. They're not just photos, they're so much more.  As a musician (and part time photographer), I always ask people what 5 albums would they want to have on their iPod if they were stranded on a desert island. By the same token, I know what book I would want by my side should I ever find myself in that predicament.  A Shadow Falls.
B0007TKNKG|4.0|Over The Top is a fantastic piece of cinema couture, in which Sylvester Stallone shows his softer side. Really. I mean it. Not one person dies. Well, one person dies, but it is a sad event.<br /><br />Right, so Sylvester Stallone is a truck driver who is estranged from his wife and son. His baby's momma get's hold of him and tells him that his son is finishing the year at military academy, and that she would love for him to reunite with his father. So, Sly-dog goes to pick up his kid, who immediately flips out and insists that Sly can't be his dad. Probably because he is all buff, and the kid is a bit of a weeny, but who knows.<br /><br />So, father and son head off on a cross country, diesel fueled, emotional thrill-ride in Sly's (non-sleeper cab) big rig. Along the way, we learn about Stallone's primary passion: arm wrestling. After his son discovers that Sly is a good arm wrestler, he starts asking questions, which leads to a training montage, and eventually a challenge between the son and some spiky haired rapscallion playing pinball at a truck stop.<br /><br />After this event, where father and son really connect, the boy is stolen (Stolen!) away by his own grandfather (maternal grandfather, go figure). More stuff happens and then Sly drives a big rig through his rich Father In-law's mansion and lays it all on the line: Sly will win the national arm wrestling championship in Las Vegas, and when he does, he will be taking his son back once and for all. Can Sly do it? Can he make a heartwarming movie where he has to arm wrestle for custody of his son? Over The Top is the answer!
0385504225|4.0|This book was a good book, and was very interesting. It is not as good as Angels and Demons or The Da Vinci Code, the two books that came before it, but it is still a thrilling read and would be suggested to people who like to read, especially people who like thrillers or is a fan of Dan Brown. The biggest disappointment was that the ending wasn't as dramatic as the book promised (comparable to the ending of Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson and the Olympian Series: The Last Olympian).
0385504225|1.0|this taught me a lesson-- do not fall for the pre-order hype, just because you liked the previous writings of an author. 3 of us read it on our kindles and each of us claims we hated it more than the other two. I won a/c I couldn't even finish it. At least we didn't spring for the hard cover.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Absolutely one of the most spectacular videos in the music industry. Very easy to get immersed in the concert.
0061914177|2.0|Now that I've read the mystifying rave reviews of this book--and seen in one day how 12 people have already marked my review as \\"not helpful\\", I wish I could rank this book even lower. I was being kind with 2 stars. (The extra one was a nod for explaining to people who may not have thought of it before, some of the \\"branding\\" potential of social media. Oh, and for using a book as a PR piece--even though that is also a major NEGATIVE factor to me).<br /><br />I looked forward to this book. I share Gary's idea that the internet + its social media has created amazing new opportunities for entrepreneurs with the know-how to fully utilize it. I agree with his vision of relentless and disciplined branding in every way that this new media offers.<br /><br />The problems? First, as others have mentioned, Vaynerchuk started out in his father's already-successful wine merchant business. Vaynerchuk expanded his father's business innovatively via social media branding (taking it from $4 million to, he says, $50 million), but that does not make his experience easily replicable for the people he's exhorting to \\"crush it\\" like he did. Nor does it seem wise for him to urge others, including many who don't have his financial family \\"safety net\\", to quit their jobs and \\"follow your passion\\". He hasn't \\"been there\\" (struggling, like most people do, without a lucrative family business to fall back on). His advice to give it all up to work 24/7 and follow your passion could be very irresponsible, especially in this unforgiving economy.<br /><br />Sadly, \\"Crush It\\" falls into the category of \\"book written because someone has gotten rich at doing something\\". It seems based on the premise that real world financial success (especially with a technological flair) = valuable insights and practical knowledge and skills to teach others.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that isn't always true. Great salesmen (and Gary -does- seem to be a great salesman) do not necessarily make great writers...thinkers...teachers. Mid-way through this small book, the focus is still basically on one subject: Gary Vaynerchuk, and how he got to be the business success that he is today, primarily using social media to its fullest to promote himself and his business--that all-encompassing \\"brand\\".<br /><br />Of course, personal success stories--told briefly--can be very inspirational and motivational. Told at length, accompanied by lots of personal hype....well, it just seems that \\"writing a book\\" is being seen as one more extension of \\"sharing my brand with the world\\".<br /><br />I hoped this book would be a focused \\"how to\\", not a personal sales pitch. Definitely disappointing. I really don't understand all the raves, unless its a new form of \\"applied networking\\".<br /><br />UPDATE: A week after I reviewed this book, I wanted to make one more observation. Most reviews, including those written before mine (all overwhelmingly positive) have 1 or 2...maybe as many as 7 in a few cases...\\"helpful/not helpful\\" comments. My lone \\"2 star\\" review, by contrast, has 50 comments. The \\"1 star\\" review has 60. It's the kind of spread you get when reviewing a hot-topic political book. With \\"Crush It\\",  there's something very odd about this pattern of commenting, and imo very wrong...<br /><br />1.27.10. This thread is so odd that, as someone who writes a fair amount of Amazon reviews, I keep an eye on it. It's pretty weird. First, disclosure: I don't know -any- of the people who have commented on whether my review was helpful to them or not. But for the last week or so responses have kept this 2 star review listed as \\"most helpful\\" which must be annoying to the author who also watches this thread--responding to EVERYTHING (although his book remains at 1, 1 and 2 in his Amazon categories).<br /><br />Today, in one day, a barrage of negatives (70 or so 'not helpful' votes--an unheard of number in one day!) dropped this 2 star review off to oblivion, now replaced by 5 star reviews with 1 or 2 people agreeing they are \\"helpful\\". And, too, today alone there are 8 new comments in this thread (posted last October), including 3 today alone from Gary, the author.<br /><br />Weird, weird pattern here. And, more than ever, I think this is some kind of \\"promoted\\" response to a negative review. So, just to add in conclusion....I wouldn't buy a book from anyone who encouraged (directly or indirectly encouraged) his fans to distort an honest response to his book. 70 \\"not helpful\\" responses to a 4 month old review? In one day???? Never, ever happen \\"naturally\\" at Amazon. Then again, maybe \\"Crush It!\\" has different meaning than I originally thought....reeing they are \\"helpful\\". And, too, today alone there are 8 new comments in this thread (posted last October), including 3 today alone from Gary, the author.<br /><br />Weird, weird pattern here.

0061719544|5.0|I received a brand new book in excellent condition for a Great price, with prompt service. What more can anyone ask for!
0375842209|5.0|Okay, So I was given this book on my 16th birthday this year and I was excited to read it. Not only because I love reading books involving the Holocaust and World war II but because of how it was written. It was in the perspective of Death showing the story not just \\"There was a girl.\\" I dislike books that tell me the story or predictable books. That is why it is hard for me to get a good book. This book made me cry, I was attached to the people, it was like I was following death around and following Liesel. I would say that this is my favorite book by far. I recommend reading this book!! Once you open it's fantastic cover to the first page, you will not be able to put it down!
B00005MP58|5.0|I have read Jane Austen's pride and prejudice many many years ago in a different language.  Instantly I became her huge fan,I love and enjoy the story very much, and p&p truly is Jane Austen's masterpiece.  As soon as I found out they have made this story into a movie, I eagerly searched for it.  I have watched four different versions(1940 Laurence Oliveier version, 1980 David Rintonl version, 1996 Colin firth and Jennifer Ehle version, 2005 Keira Knightley version, and I have to say this one by far is the best of the all.  I rarely watch any movie twice in a short period of time, but this one I cannot remember how many times I have watched in a week.  It was really a pleasure though, Colin Firth's execution in this movie was brilliant, and he brings out a live Mr.  Darcy, I cannot imagine any better Darcy than this, he touched my heart.  Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth Bennet was well played too, each time when I re-watched the movie I love her more and more.  Besides leading characters, all the other supporting actors in this movie were carried out their roles wonderfully, and that contributed a great deal to the movie.  If you love the book, this movie is must seen, and I highly  recommend this movie to anyone who likes classic romance storys.
B00001OH7Y|4.0|i could've given it five stars. compared to albums by any other artist, it deserves five. but... i think this was the beginning of the end. actually, Lodger was the end. it just happened before the beginning of the end instead of after it, if that makes sense. (there were a couple of good songs on Lodger, but only one, DJ, came up to bowie's standards.) but, about Scary Monsters... all the songs are goods. in fact, almost all the songs are very good. maybe even great. there just seems to be something missing. maybe there's a more blatant attempt to be commercial. (Lodger's DJ certainly does). maybe a more blatant attempt to be cool. (the business with nine-inch-nails hints at that). maybe it comes from knowing what happened to his career afterward. (Let's Dance is a great song, but it's not a great David Bowie song.\\" Now, one thing, YOU SHOULD BUY THIS ALBUM. IT'S GREAT. YOU'LL LOVE IT. but, there's no way this should be the only david bowie album you get. especially if all you have is Let's Dance. there's Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane, and Diamond Dogs. There's Young Americans and Stay and Station to Station. There's Low and Heroes. There's The Man Who Sold the World, and Hunky Dory, and Space Oddity. there's the live albums, David Live, Stage, Santa Monica Civic Center. these are the essentials. this isn't about music. if it was about music, you wouldn't have to get any of them. it's about quality of life. - david
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Whitney is back ! True fans will appreciate this cd, as her humble offering to let us know, she now is a matured more spiritual Whitney.  I will look forward to more from her, as she is welcomed back into the  fold. Much has happened since her time away, but she is God gifted with  a voice that is timeless, and I fully expect she will let it shine once  again. God bless her Mom and Aunts for staying with her, and may God  bless her and her daughter as they continue on with their new lives  together.
B00001OH7P|5.0|Ziggy Stardust, the song, was playing on the stereo. i turned to my daughter, aged three at the time, and said, \\"When you hear people talk about God, this is who they mean. His name's Ziggy Stardust.\\" i thought it was a good introduction to music, as well as theology. i don't know if there's a better album out there. there's certainly not a cooler one. and there's certainly no one who's just taken rock 'n roll and run with it the way david bowie did. in ziggy stardust, he became the incarnation of the rock star before he even was a rock star. and then killed him. there was no rock'n roll messiah before ziggy stardust. and there never will be again.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Very enjoyable CD. I bought all the songs on itunes, but wanted a \\"real\\" CD of this one. The music is very enjoyable, and it is worth it to have it as a CD.
B002BFBAWO|4.0|So, I first saw this movie in theaters the weekend it came out.  I was pretty excited because I was a huge Superbad fan, and this movie was marketed as \\"From the Director of Superbad.\\"  This marketing tagline was coupled with a few really funny shots from the film.  After seeing the movie, I sat in the movie in question.  I wasn't quite sure how I felt about it.  On one hand, I was disappointed at its lack of humor.  On the other hand, I was amazingly impressed with the depth of the storyline.  If you get this movie, go in knowing a few things:    -First, this movie isn't another \\"Superbad\\" funny movie.  It has a few good laughs, but all-in-all, it's a pretty serious movie.  Don't be fooled by the trailer, especially the \\"red band\\" version\\"    -Second, serious isn't a bad thing.  For me, it brought to light a lot of interesting thoughts about love, partying, and even religion.  If you go in recognizing that there is something deeper in the plot, you'll enjoy the movie so much more.    -Last,  the movie had an amazing cast.  The unknown Jesse Eisenberg puts out a good name for himself, and Kristen Stewart looks spectacular.  If you're a guy, you'll be teased, but pleased.    I say rent it to give it a go.  I bought it after seeing it in theaters because I wanted to try to dive deeper into the, what I feel are, \\"Hidden Themes.\\"  Happy watchings.
B001QIP5A0|5.0|If you can't get a diving crew and gear to visit the most remote and most beautiful underwater scenery check this movie out. Stunning footage of the vast and amazing sea creatures known to man, and some I have never heard about. This was a spectaculor documentry, combined with 1080p HD and this was a beautiful picture.

B000TGJ80I|4.0|This is one of my favorites and best vampire movies. There are a few flaws to the movie but can be over looked. In one's opinion vampires are stronger or just as strong as Lykens. Some of the elder vampires seems frail in this movie. But that can be over looked with cool scenes and a great story line.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I thought this book was okay....just okay.  As someone who loved \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and loved \\"Angels and Demons\\" even more, I was a little let down by \\"The Lost Symbol\\".    First off, it is VERY long for a story that only spanned 1 day. There were several times in the book that I was almost speed reading to get past slow parts simply because the book was so long.    To me, I think Mr. Brown tried too hard on the story line. After having the cool plots and twists in the first two Langdon books, it felt like Mr. Brown was trying to do it again, but more this time. It kept going to the point of it being ridiculous at times. I think the actual story was very neat, but he just took it to the Nth degree and should have kept it more simple....in my humble opinion.    For Dan Brown fans, like I am, it is definitely worth reading, but it surely isn't worth $20+(hardback). The people who got it on their Kindle for $10 paid what this book was worth.    I would have been happy if it was 75 pages shorter. I don't mind long books at all, but this was too long for the story it told.    I will definitely read more Langdon novels, but I hope next time around, Mr. Brown doesn't try so hard.....or wait to long to write it.
B00009W8N2|5.0|I am in no way or shape a metalhead. I detest most \\"hard rock\\" bands. I got tired of Led Zeppelin at age 17. My favorite rock band are Sleater Kinney (feminist indie-pop) and The Shins.     I also listen to \\"early\\" music (meaning medieval and Renaissance classical). I think that is why this band is so appealing. This is a truly fantastic album. It is not rock 'n' roll except in the most superficial way. It is orchestral, classical, symphonic, Wagnerian music played on electric guitars. I have four or five Opeth albums. Weirdly, despite others' opinions that they got better with each new release, I find myself listening to this one again and again. Folks more familiar with this genre can give you a better technical description of the tracks.     For the non-metal heads willing to try something totally different and out of your comfort zone, give this a shot with an open mind. Once you get past the comically bad cookie-monster vocals, the sheer musicality of this band will become apparent. By the third listen, the vocals will seem entirely natural and appropriate.
0385504225|5.0|Wow!!!!!What a book. Dan Brown is a brilliant writer. I have read 3 of his novels, and they are excellent. I hope The Lost Symbol, becomes a movie, although, his books are better. I could not put this book down, the book is writeen in such a way that it propels you to want to know what happened next. Excellent!!!!!

159562015X|4.0|I give this book a 4/5, not because the book was so great, but because the assessment you gain access to by buying the book is great.  The book's content is a little thin, but I wanted to buy the cheapest book that would give me the code to do the on-line assessment.    I did the assessment as part of a class I was attending.  The class itself, led by a person certified in the Gallup organization's Stengthfinder assessment tools, was superb.  At least a 6/5.  I'm not sure how I would rate this book if I had not had that class and that person's assistance in using the information gained.    The focus on strengths, rather than weaknesses, which we are far more accustomed to, is refreshing.  I am already able to appreciate my own and others' strengths more, and to find ways to capitalize on them, rather than struggling against them.    The weakness of this approach is just that:  it doesn't take into account weaknesses.  When we don't acknowledge or deal with those, they can sabotage our strengths.  And every strength has its corresponding weakness.  So this is not a well-rounded, comprehensive book on life.  But it is insightful, encouraging and positive.  And I have benefitted from that.
B002OMZTSU|4.0|What really came across for me from this book were several aspects.    For a man with so many downs dogging his early child and adult years, he has an admirable lack of self-pity. Perhaps it's because he has conquered so much by the time he writes this memoir. I was conscious, however, of his sadness of how his problems affected his relationships, especially his great female loves. I teared up when he had to sell the perfect little seaside cottage he had shared with his second wife when they finally split up - the act being a symbol of the loss simultaneously of hope, dreams, love.    I am amazed at how he, and I suppose many males in general, accepts fighting fist to fist. As a female, I can't imagine willingly enduring/participating in and even looking forward to a great fight as Craig does during his years growing up in Scotland. Maybe the blows don't hurt as much when you are young or when the senses are dulled by drunkeness...This is not to be interpreted as acts of an aggressive self-nature, self-hatred or self-punishment but was endemic to the immediate culture.    This is a well written and serious memoir from a commedian told with frankness; not sparing the reader the darker moments fueled from the loss of great loves, very serious alcoholism, active drug use, career sputters, etc.      What I really admire about him now is that he doesn't keep hitting you over the head currently on his talk show with these details. Unlike Carrie Fisher, for example, his current humor is not dependent on constantly referring to the past difficulties. He concentrates now on the positives and I suspect that's what keeps him on safer and happier ground.     At present, he has a stable \\"this is forever\\" marriage, a successful late night talk show, a new American citizenship - in short a life vastly different and more successful than he could have ever imagined from his original start in life in working class Scotland.     If you chose to read this book so you know his backstory, see if you agree with me that when you watch him carefully on his talk show, you don't see a humbleness at times. Look for the moments he downcasts his eyes relative to the immediate conversation and the times he seems to be remembering but withholding his thoughts. Maybe I am projecting or imagining this....but maybe not.....experience can be the ultimate savior, constant atonement the means to longterm self-forgiveness. In the book, he comments often of his regret of causing others pain. Not all memoirs uplift....but this one does.    EDIT: I definitely hesitated before including the last paragraph above. It's a bit heavy handed like he is always in some kind of self-reflective mode when he's doing his show. He's definitely not and he did a bit that involved alcohol in one of his latest shows and it was light hearted and fun. It's just that I sense he has moments when he is reminded of his own difficulties. Alcoholism is a life-long battle and never really fully stops being something you can forget entirely.
B002KDUDG6|2.0|The cool swag that made \\"It's Time\\" such a fresh and edgy album has yet to be repeated by Michael Buble. Although his voice still holds up, he rarely showcases it in \\"Crazy Love\\". Yes there are some bright spots on this album such as Georgia and Crazy Love, but for the most part the album comes off as cheesy and uninspired. Most of the arrangements seem kiddish, almost Sesame Street like. I truly hope that Michael Buble returns to form soon, before the only fans he has left are blue haired old ladies and six year old children.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. They pulled off a dynamic cast to play characters we're all very familiar with. A definite buy!
0385504225|3.0|I was really looking forward to this latest from Dan Brown.  Although I thorough enjoyed \\"The DaVinci Code\\" with it's Italian setting and Catholic Church theme, \\"Angels and Demons\\" was also a provocative read.  I found \\"The Lost Symbol\\" to be much the same as \\"DaVinci\\" substituting Washington D.C. for Italy and the Masons for the Church.  Only this time, the newness is gone and there is much less suspense; the intrigue doesn't seem quite as intriguing. I found myself less invested in the characters. No longer the answer man, Robert Langdon takes a backseat to Katherine and Peter Solomon, and Director Sato.  Should the Langdon series continued, I may be less compelled to read the next one.
0385504225|1.0|I couldn't wait to purchase Dan Brown's newest book, The Lost Symbol, because I really enjoyed reading The DaVinci Code. Wow, what a HUGE disappointment. The plot is silly, the writing mediocore and repeditive. I couldn't even bring myself to read the final pages - it was that bad. Brown raised some Christian eyebrows with The DaVinci Code but he must have been trying to appease them with The Lost Symbol. If I want to be preached to I'll go to church. If you think you must read this book I suggest you should borrow it from the library, don't waste your money.
B000002KCF|5.0|Although this was Michael Franks' second album ( he released the lesser known \\"Previously Unavailable\\" in 1973), \\"The Art Of Tea\\" album truly jump started Franks' career as a pop/jazz vocalist. Produced by Tommy LiPuma (well known for his work with Miles Davis, George Benson, & Diana Krall), this cd has all the makings of what true singing & songwriting are all about. What I really love about this album is the range of styles on each track. Franks can go from swing (\\"Jive\\", \\"Popsicle Toes\\") to R&B (\\"Monkey See-Monkey Do\\") to a pop-orientated ballad (\\"I Don't Know Why I'm So Happy I'm Sad\\") all within one album. Maybe there are a few exceptions, but you don't find range like that in today's cd's. His voice can be as soothing as an enviornmental cd, & that's a compliment. If you like this one, definetely check out \\"Sleeping Gypsy\\" (my personal favorite), \\"Burchfield Nines\\" (another favorite), \\"Tiger In The Rain\\", & \\"One Bad Habit\\". In closing, you can't go wrong with any of Michael Franks' cd's. But all of his 70's albums are perfect for those relaxing moments alone, or with someone special.

How can such accomplished artists as Marsalis and even Ray himself (Genius Loves Company) not notice the complete lack of singing talent the man possesses? Certainly Willie is an amazing songwriter and performer and even managed to croak out some pretty good ballads in his native country music genre, but PLEASE keep him away from other material!
0743454537|4.0|A fascinating book dealing with deep ethical issues. Is it ok for parents to conceive a genetically engineered embryo, because it is a good match for a previous child with leukemia? At Anna's delivery the stem cells of the cord blood is donated to Kate and subsequently she donates lymphocytes, granulocytes, bone marrow and now with Kate's kidneys failing she is expected to donate one of her kidneys. A major decision is being made about her \\"and no one's bothered to ask the one person who most deserves it to speak her opinion.\\"  The reader is to some extent educated about haematology and oncology as well as the work done by firefighters/paramedics and also the legal system. There are many sub-plots intertwining well with the main plot until the story comes to an unexpected end.
0312370849|2.0|This book seems to have two different authors. The first writes a poignant, riveting story based on an important event in history. De Rosnay weaves a personal human tragedy into the horror of Vel'd'Hiv', smacking the reader in the face with man's inhumanity to man.  The first half of the book and its conclusion were heartbreaking, physically painful, and I felt that De Rosnay was making the statement of her life. I will \\"Zakhor. Al Tiehkah/ Remember. Never Forget\\".    The second half of the book made me mad. I only kept reading because of Julia's relationship with her father-in-law. It was predictable, Hollywood schlock.     I wish the author would rewrite the book from page 160 without the superfluous characters, destinations... and without Julia's incessant, repetitious thought process. Unfortunately, De Rosnay dilutes a powerful story and loses her reader's respect; respect that I think was well earned in the first half of the book.
0385504225|3.0|The good news, it's a quick read.  Not too detailed with new info...short pithy chapters...few characters (all true to stereotypes)...an evil dude (tatooed and insane).        The bads news, YAWN.  I found my immediate impression was, \\"so what?\\" Was an undercover Masonic initiation video really going to bring down the world?  Not.      I enjoyed his other books where he seemed to weave a story with more substance.  Oh well, he'll still make millions and this may be another movie.      But the real message is clear.  Propaganda is rampant with the \\"arts\\" community.  Is Dan Brown the ultimate drone?  Ending the entire novel with \\"hope\\"?
B002GY9F9K|5.0|The adaptation of Terry Goodkinds book was remarkable and it is full of fun and I looked forward to seeing it everytime it was on. I spent my Saturday nights sitting spellbound to each characterization with Kahlan being my favorite followed closely by Zed. Even Richards character was pulled off very well by these great actors. Even the villian Darken Raul was pulled off very well too. I have each episode on my DVR and I am looking forward to having a copy of such to make room on my DVR for next  season too. I am hoping to have all 12 books in portrayal for many years to come.
1402210795|4.0|This audio version is very competently narrated by Eve Matheson. I especially like her male voices for Sherry and his various male friends and cousin. I did not like the voice for Hero because it came off whiny and simpering. This story is well written and has some humorous parts. I admire the way Georgette Heyer wrote compelling romances without all the physical love scenes. Great story, but there are a lot of characters and sometimes it was hard to remember who was who.
0596007124|4.0|I believe this book is a must have for those people that are new to Design Patterns or want to refresh themselves with the concepts of the most used Design Patterns. This book uses pictures and easy to understand terminology that helps you get a grasp of key concepts quickly, and retain them. This book is so much more fun to read and easier to understand than some of the other books out there on the topic. Give this book a chance. I think you'll be happy with it.
0375826726|5.0|Christopher is a good writer.  This has turned into a lengthier story than he originally intended but it is hard to let go of a great story.  I began reading one story that started with 'The Eys of The World\\" and I quit reading it when it went into the fifth rendition.  Books used to be written so they started and ended in one book.  There was no frustration waiting for the next episode.  This story is a good story and I will wait for the conclusion in the next book.    Chas E. Moser
B002SVBDYQ|5.0|Coming off what was called the soundtrack of the year, and considered the must-have album by any teenage girl of 2008, the New Moon soundtrack had a lot of uphill work to do. The Twilight soundtrack was more of an alt/modern rock effort, with Paramore and Muse catapulting off the frenzied pitch big time. But in my opinion, the Twilight soundtrack was a generic mess that catered to its movie and its audience. This soundtrack on the other hand does the complete opposite. The album has a little alternative rock, but its decidedly indie, featuring the biggest indie artists of the past five years. The results are surprisingly amazing.<br /><br />Highlights Include:<br />Meet Me On The Equinox<br />Friends<br />Rosyln<br />Monsters<br />New Moon (The Meadow)<br /><br />\\"Meet Me On The Equinox\\" is what first drew me to the album, and since I'm personally a big fan of Death Cab, I'd put it as the album highlight. It's lyrics are imaginative, and the music is decidedly alt rock at some of its best. The song is radio-friendly, but also blows me away every time. Also, at the tail end of the album is a short little piano piece that is stunningly beautiful in every way. It's timing is perfect, the skill and the mood all work together, and it seems to blend nicely with the rest of the album.<br /><br />Simply put, the album has the feel that artists had the chance to do the soundtrack, and instead of catering to the movie, they just put out some new material they were working on. It's their sound, and all are very worthy additions to their collections. Bon Iver sounds like Bon Iver, and Thom Yorke sounds like Thom Yorke. Granted, I am not that familiar with the material of the book, but it seems like the lyrical content has nothing to do with the movie. Maybe some abstract stuff about relationships, but that's it. Also, since the artists featured tend to venture into darker material, the album has a very gloomy feel to it, but it's also so well done, it's easy to get lost in the atmosphere of the music.<br /><br />Overall, I have a feeling the core Twilight fanbase will be utterly bewildered and disgusted by this album, especially the Tween audience. It seems to be built for collage radio with its non-conformity and maturity. It's dark, it's moody, it's independent, and it's surprisingly good. Don't be thrown off by the Twilight name, if you're a fan of alternative rock, or a big indie person, then pick up this album, you'll like what you hear.a feeling the core Twilight fanbase will be utterly bewildered and disgusted by this album, especially the Tween audience.

B0025KVLVA|5.0|The Beatles' Past Masters (remastered) is an excellent collection  of many of their hits (She Loves You, Paperback Writer, Get Back)  and some of their rarities (Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand - the German version of I Want To Hold Your Hand). A total of thirty two songs  from their earliest recordings of Love Me to to one of their  final singles, Let It Be.    The clarity of the remastered tracks is heard especially in Across The Universe.      I recommend this CD for not only Beatle fans who are beginning to widen  their collection, but also the die hard collectors as well.
0671045725|5.0|I've seen the movie, read the book and listened to the audiobook.  My favorite was the audiobook, by far.  Unfortunately, movies almost always include scenes that aren't technically correct.  But the audiobook had a secret weapon, namely Joe Morton, the narrator.  Morton was the real thing, and this is one of those very rare cases where the narrator is so good and appropriate that it makes a good book into classic high art.      There is a side to this story that we didn't know at the time the book was published.  The earlier attacks on our forces had al-Qaeda behind them.  They were meticulously planned well in advance.  After that experience, the Clinton administration got our forces out of there.  This was supported in our media and presidential ratings went up.  It's important to understand the conflict in context.    The story itself, not the movie, is technically correct and superb.  In it, we can see the sacrifice and bravery of our troops as well as the reality of Mogadishu and fearlessness of the fighters there.  The reckless fighting spirit of Mogadishuans was enhanced with khat, a very important drug in their tribal society.  Such a place with a culture of hospitality unknown to the West had become a living hell, and it was worse in areas outside that city.    In particular we get the story within the story about the survival of Mike Durant.  He was a Chief Warrant Officer 3 at the time, serving in the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment.  This suspenseful account resulted in a partial silver lining when he was released after eleven days in captivity.      Military historians will continue to laud this story for its richness in geopolitics, technical excellence, usefulness for teaching military principles, survival credits, esprit de corps and Joe Morton's performance.  I recommend this audiobook without reservation.
1416594787|1.0|I happened to pick up (no I didn't buy this book, as Richard Dawkins does not deserve my hard-earned money) The Greatest Lie on Earth by Richard Dawkins. I read through the book in 3 days and was quite astonished! By what authority does Richard have in comparing Creationists (although I am not one) to Holocaust deniers? Good job Richard, given that evolutionary ideology calls for the \\"eradication\\" of the weak, namely the Jews (of which I am). You just opened up a can of worms! It is you and your followers that are the FASCISTS!! Your theories are pretty lame and pathetic, yet you claim that there is evidence that backs you up, how about showcasing your \\"evidence\\" to the public and prove that a higher power does not exist using evolutionary standards. We want to see it done live, not on paper, or in theory. Why do you consistently avoid debates about Intelligent Design? Is it because you can't debate Intelligent Design? Is it because you are incapable of debating Intelligent Design using your weak evolutionary brain?    It's quite funny that Dick would say \\"just because science cannot explain it, doesn't mean that God did it.\\" Well then, why do people like him dismiss the possibility of psychic phenomenon? Just because science can't explain psychic phenomenon, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist! How contradictory there, Dick!!!    How about this, why don't you just get a real job, or consider retiring you senile old man....People, save your money and use it to get your spouse something nice, or take your kids out for a fun day at an amusement park....Better than lining up Richard Dawkins' wallet. The debate is settled!!!
0060007737|5.0|This book is an incredibly easy read - you can read it in one day. That doesn't diminish the value at all - this should be required reading for every executive - because most execs are branding idiots. The 22 laws are all backed up with solid examples using well-known brands, so there is a great amount of credibility and it generates a lot of food for thought. This isn't the first branding book I've read, and while I didn't agree with everything, I agree with 90% of it. And, if I could get the execs at my own company to follow 90% of the rules, we'd be a much better company.

0307454541|4.0|Stieg Larsson's debut thriller, \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" sure takes its sweet time getting rolling, but there's something captivating about this twisted tale of crimes of a financial and a much, much worse nature set largely in the back end of Nowhere, Sweden.<br /><br />Mikael is an odd protagonist.  A semi-successful magazine publisher and financial reporter, the book opens with his conviction for libel - Mikael took on a big corporate player and lost when the guy out-lawyered him.  Disgraced and seemingly alone (his best friend, long-time lover and business partner is married and seemingly only makes time for Mikael occasionally), Mikael wanders through a few chapters until an odd job offer drops into his lap - would he write the autobiography of the aged Henrik Vanger, head of the Vanger Corporation?<br /><br />This odd job masks Henrik's real purpose - forty years earlier, Henrik's beloved niece Harriet went missing.  Her body was never found and her whereabouts are unknown, even though Henrik's dogged search has never flagged.  Convinced by a huge paycheck and no prospects of anything better to do, Mikael agrees . . . sure, it won't go anywhere, but where's the harm in looking?<br /><br />If only he knew.<br /><br />Larsson has created some fascinating characters, not least of them being Lisbeth Salander, the titular girl with the dragon tattoo.  A creepy, anti-social, brilliant girl, Salander is a character for the ages.  Tiny but vicious, brilliant but as socially-gifted as Tom Ripley, Salander only tries to do her job (she's a top-notch private investigator) and live her own life, but people (especially men) keep getting in her way.  Salander's life and Mikael's do not really intersect until later in the novel, and by that time they have both wormed their way into their hearts.<br /><br />The only weakness of the book is the Vanger family, the extended bunch of brothers, nephews, kids, nieces, cousins, and misfits who make up one of Sweden's leading corporate dynasties.  While a couple emerge as viable characters in their own right, the family is just so big that it's hard to keep them and their many flaws straight.  The Kennedys have nothing on this band of misanthropes when it comes to screwing up prosperity.<br /><br />A creepy book that worms its way under your skin until you just can't put it down, \\"Tattoo\\" is a very good thriller.  Is it as timeless or epic as other great page-turners like James Clavell's \\"Shogun\\"?  Nope - and it's a bit too creepy for that, too.  But it's one of the best thrillers I've read in a long time and it kept me guessing throughout.

B002C1BHIO|5.0|I have to admit when I heard Amazon was working on their own brand of products, I had visions of the old white generic boxes from 20 years ago.  Especially when I read it was going to come in their own plain packaging.  My first thought was uh-oh.  This is gonna be cheap, so they can slap their name on it.<br /><br />While I'm no technical wizard, and I don't have gadgets, meters, and all that to hook up every cable to say \\"This cable performs best because my meter says...\\".  Meh - I'm just a guy who likes to hook up stuff and have it work.<br /><br />To that, I (like most people) am interested in a decent quality cable for their electronics.  Not interested in paying out the backside needlessly for it (Monster), or going too cheap either (some of the one penny cables you see on Amazon).  I've tried the dirt cheap route before here on Amazon (not on HDMI, but with other stuff), and have been burnt.  So I decided to look and see what was out there, and happened upon the Amazon Basics line.<br /><br />I was in need of an HDMI cable, as I recently got a second HDTV, and will be hooking an HD TiVo up to it, so I ordered this.  It arrived today.  In the interim, I read all the reviews, and are pretty much universally positive.  When it actually arrived today, I got it out of the box, and was immediately surprised at how solid it felt.  The other HDMI cables I have for other things aren't nearly as \\"solid\\" as this feels.  So, as a test, I stuck it on my Xbox 360 in place of the component cables I had there.  This looked way clearer than the component cables, so I decided to leave it there, and ordered a second one tonight for the TiVo I originally ordered the first one for.<br /><br />I have to say again I was quite surprised at how sturdy this feels.  The only real negative I could say would be I wish they had a three foot option instead of just six and nine.  I do have a bunch of extra cable back there with the six foot, where a three foot would have done just as well.  Oh well, that's a minor quibble.  I'll definitely look at Amazon Basics again for future cabling needs.<br /><br />One word of warning about the \\"Frustration Free\\" packaging.  One of the reviews I read said that it was easy enough to open with your finger, without any kind of scissors.  So I tried that.  I advise against that, because I gave myself a cardboard cut.  Had to go slap a band-aid on there.  Yeah, it's my own fault, it could have easily been opened with a pair of plain (even kids) scissors, but I tried the macho route, and used my finger.  That was stupid.  The frustration free packaging (outside of my own dumb move) really was easy to open, and the fact I can toss it in the recycle bin is nice.  It's also well enough put together that you can take all the stickers off and re-use the box.  It's very sturdy.<br /><br />UPDATE:  When I bought this cable on October 16th, the price was just $17.51.  Lately Amazon has been selling it for over $30.  What's with that?  Did I catch it during some intro price period or something?bble.  I'll definitely look at Amazon Basics again for future cabling needs.

B002KSPKRS|3.0|First off i bought this product twice and both of them had chat problems including echoes whenever I talk and cut offs every now and then. So I got a replacement for one and it works fine except for the cut offs every now and then. The sound is great with the bass effect and really sounds like your own surround sound home theatre right on your head. Its very comfortable and lightweight for that competitive edge. My replacement turtle beach exceeds expectations for sound quality and could use a better chat voice chat and boom mic but the whole thing works fine. In conclusion turtle beach needs to make a more consistant working product thats features work properly with each product sold and I hope they make that fix to the next model they make,  not only by making a better sound quality and comfort headset but making sure all its features work properly.

The video was shot extremely well and I will watch it,probably just with the LPCM stereo mix

B0029O08WA|1.0|I was really excited to get this album and get an early taste of the movie. The music is awful. I don't like a single song on the album. It's wierd, with most of the lyrics sang so strangely that they're not understandable. The tones of the songs seem to sync with the tone of the book, and I assume the movie, but the album is terrible. I hope the movie is better or I'm going to be even more disappointed. Don't waste your money. My only hope is that the movie will enlighten me about the music and I can get some use out of the CD.
B002S0OBFK|2.0|Where to begin, where to begin. My first question is since we voted Paranormal Activity into a wide release in theaters, is there a way that we can vote it out? I haven't felt this let down by a film in a very long time. We're talking let down by epic proportions. I was so completely disappointed, I almost wanted to stand outside the theater door and warn people going in to save their money, don't believe the hype, go trade your ticket in for Zombieland. I can't believe I'm saying this, but wait a week and go see Saw VI. It has too be more entertaining than this.<br /><br />Before I go on, let me get the one good thing about this movie out of the way. It won't take long, believe me. The movie does serve as a warning to people to not mess with the supernatural and occult which, in my opinion, is a very good position to take on the subject. A lot of movies make it look fun to play around with the occult and such, but this is definitely not one of them.<br /><br />Now, on to the rest of the film. I guess I'll just start from the top and move down the list. I may have to abridge some of this since if I actually went into what all is wrong with this movie, I would have to start another website. We begin with the filming technique. The shaky cam is something that was first used as a horror gimmick for film in The Blair Witch Project. This film wishes it was The Blair Witch Project. Never mind the comparisons - it truly WANTS to be that film. I'm over it. Done with the shaky cam crap. I'm tired of leaving the theater feeling like I want to go blow chunks on the director. It was cool the first time. But to keep making movies like this for me to watch is like asking me to keep riding that rollercoaster that I know is going to make me want to barf half-way through it.<br /><br />I don't know why Oren Peli is being praised for this thing. All he did was walk around with a video camera and shoot stuff. There is nothing even remotely artistic about this. You set a camera up in the corner of a room. People get in bed and out of bed. You use some cheap parlor tricks to make doors move and have somebody downstairs banging stuff. Wow. Now that is art. The rest of it is shot like a home movie, just focusing on a room or a certain person.<br /><br />What you get with this film is 20 minutes of footage that has some very quick scares and then 50 minutes of people talking about what's going on. Honestly, I would have felt better and been more entertained if they would have just released the 20 minutes of bed footage and been done with it.<br /><br />Scariest movie ever or of the year? I think not. This entire film is made up of cheap thrills and loud bumps to make you jump. It's like that bad remake or rip-off of The Exorcist you accidentally rented off of Netflix last week. The only people who will be scared from watching this movie are moviegoers who are completely unfamiliar with horror films and do not go see them regularly. I mean real regularly. There's no way if you've watched even two scary movies this year that this thing would get more than a cheap momentary jump out of you.<br /><br />Paramount and everyone involved in this thing has done quite a number on the public. It makes me wonder if this wasn't planned from the very beginning. That it was somehow orchestrated from the get-go. All I can say, I got taken. If you don't feel like you've gotten taken when leaving the theater after seeing this, then they've truly done a number on you. I walked out not believing that renowned websites that I rely on for my movie news have actually been promoting this thing as truly scary and brilliant. Has everyone bought into a big lie? Not me. I do have to applaud Oren Peli, though. He has somehow taken an $11,000 heap of film project and used it to rise to the stature as of being the director of The Blair Witch Project of the 21st century. We saw how well that panned out for the original directors of that film.ple get in bed and out of bed. You use some cheap parlor tricks to make doors move and have somebody downstairs banging stuff.

From the opening scene to the final, few minutes, WANTED is a white-knuckle ride with bending bullets, a car chase that 'll blow your mind, and one of the most spectacular train crash/fight scenes ever put on film. Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a cube-dwelling hypochondriac, with a humiliating boss and a cheating girlfiend. His life is going nowhere! Wes discovers that his estranged father has been brutally murdered-and finds himself thrust into joining a secret society of assassins, called the Fraternity. During his training, at the hands of a skilled mentor called (Fox), this once office-bound wimp develops lightning-fast reflexes and superhuman dexterity. But, with his first assignment, Wes finds out that the only thing more difficult than ending the lives of others is summoning the courage to take control of his own.

B0000062FN|4.0|Having already certified themselves with their first two wonderful releases Santana had nothing at all to prove with this,their final album with their original Woodstock-era lineup. Released during a period in the 70's when 60's era psychedelia in soul and rock was still firing on all cylinders this album by and large doesn't stray too far from the bands jam oriented blend of psychedelic soul,rock and latin styles their is more of a speediness to the rhythm and,with the addition of new guitar player Neal Shoen even more of a punch to the sound. Music such as this (and that also has a lot to do with it's huge success) was one of the building blocks for the best and most creative elements of funk and rock-fusion in the coming years,even within the band itself as it turned out and it's exactly this sound that you get across \\"Batuka\\",\\"Tousaint L' Overture\\",\\"Taboo\\",\\"Guajira\\",\\"Jungle Strut\\" and \\"Para Los Rumberos\\". \\"No One To Depend On\\" and \\"Everybody's Everything\\" both try at the kind of latin pop/rock that made the big hits on [[ASIN:B0000062FL Abraxas]] such stand outs. However neither quite possess the kind of craft and strong spiritual element of those tunes and focus more on communal vocals and rhythmic developement than a planned pop song. The one place on this album where pop craft suceeds wonderfully is on \\"Everything's Coming Our Way\\",which in many ways is based heavier in soul/R&B style arrangements than anything to do with rock n roll. It is in fact an early example of the direction Santana would begin to take in the near future. The bonus cuts are three cuts from a Fillmore West concert from the same period.With the visual element missing none of the cuts say much beyond what the originals did but it is nice to hear how the band could so easily replicate on stage. In many basic ways this was the last of this kind of music Santana would record-essencially a series of jams and solos with similar instrumentation. In the future the faster tempos and rhythms of this recording would take on very different shapes and textures,often on the more experimental side of things. But this is really the best possible conclusion to their original triade of recordings.pos and rhythms of this recording would take on very different shapes and textures,often on the more experimental side of things.

0061438294|5.0|This book is exactly what I was looking for:    - it is based on the knowledge and many years of experience of a professional law inforcement interrogator.  I've seen many forensics and other investigative type TV shows as well as documentaries, and I do believe those guys are the best in this field    - it goes into specifics of what triggers our non-verbal behaviors - and that is our limbic brain    As a nice-to-have, it includes pictures of various non-verbal behavior examples throughout the book so you can see them for yourself. Finally, the book is well written and easy to read.    Overall, I am very satisfied with the purchase
B0002MB7QW|5.0|I have never seen a better disaster movie in my entire life so far to date, this move rocks, it is better than Twister, Volcano, 10.5 Apocalypse, Category 7 the end of the world, as well as many others I'm sure! The action and thrills just keep coming! This is better than spectacular, totally cool, or what a ride (comments by Jim Ferguson, Gene Shalit, and Joel Siegel)!!!!! This is NOT a movie that you sit through and then afterwards want to erase from your memory, it's just..................AWESOME!!!!!
1601251505|5.0|I love it. I love having all the core stuff in one book rather than two. The revisions to core classes, spells, skills, and feats are insightful and good. I love the CMB replacing all the various complicated rules for grappling, disarm, sunder, etc. etc. Stellar art and organization.
B00003Q43A|5.0|I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS FOREVER!!!! Have you ever watched a movie and swear that there are scenes missing? It is soooo frustrating. Everytime I watched my Independence Day movie that was what would happen and then I found this edition and was like HA! Told you! This edition has a seperate edition in it that has extra footage/scenes. It is soooooo much better than the origional boring version! (well it's only boring compared to this but yeah) If you are going to invest in this movie then I urge you to get this version because it is 100xs better.

B000002KIE|5.0|I just got this CD in the mail about 5 minutes ago, but I've already listened to all of the songs online.  I've always loved the Sex Pistols, and their CD is just a collection of all of their great music.  Their best songs, in my opinion, are Anarchy in the UK, God Save the Queen, and Pretty Vacant, though I love all of their songs.  It's my opinion that the Sex Pistols basically started punk rock, and were the absolute epitome of punk rock.  If you like punk rock, or just good music in general, you need this CD. :)  Peace out.
B0000648WZ|5.0|When I saw \\"Starship Troopers\\" the first time, I was appalled. It looked like a (really bad) fascist propaganda movie. The fascism was so overt, that I started wondering why nobody else was reacting the way I did!<br /><br />It's because it's parody, stupid.<br /><br />\\"Starship Troopers\\" is nominally based on Robert Heinlein's famous novel, but in reality it's a parody, criticizing Heinlein and his bizarre vision of a society in which only war veterans have full citizenship rights. In the process, the movie also makes fun of American militarist propaganda, and indeed militarist propaganda in general. In many ways, \\"Starship Troopers\\" is a deliberate turkey. It looks like the worst Nazi movie ever made, but it's supposed to look that way.<br /><br />\\"Starship Troopers\\" is actually quite intellectual!<br /><br />The funny thing is that many people just don't get it. Some love the movie precisely *because* it looks like a militarist propaganda movie. Others hate it for the same reason. Still others, i.e. the most devout Heinlein fans, see \\"Starship Troopers\\" as a walking insult to Heinlein's great novel, which some people treat almost as a second Bible. (Prediction: soon, somebody will point out that Federal Service is broader than the military.)<br /><br />The plot of the film doesn't deserve closer scrutiny. \\"The Federation\\" (spouting an eagle as symbol - the American eagle? Or a Nazi eagle?) is under attack by a race of monstrous, intelligent spiders from the mysterious planet Klendathu. A group of beautiful, perfect and young adults, fresh out of high school, decide to volunteer in the military. Their leader is a completely crazy old vet. Curiously, the fascist military dictatorship is multi-racial and gender-blind. When the attack on Klendathu fails, the White male dictator resigns, being replaced by a Black female. Ironically, this \\"political correctness\\" is freely based on Heinlein, who was indeed anti-racist, but real American propaganda movies can also be multi-racial (\\"Iron Eagle\\" comes to mind). Later in the movie, the beautiful Nazi kids finally put their act together and manage to defeat the bugs on another planet, where they are promptly joined by a team of SS-looking scientists. There, the movie ends, inconclusively. Along the way, we are treated to some really hefty special effects (naturally, the bugs are much larger and even more \\"alien\\" than in the novel).<br /><br />Strange fact: shortly after the premier of \\"Starhip Troopers\\" in Sweden, a new Swedish translation of Heinlein's original novel was published...with a picture from the movie on its front cover!<br /><br />That's almost postmodern. The parody is used to sell the thing parodied. Gee, what a mindjob.<br /><br />Naturally, I have to give this ridiculous Nazi slapstick five stars.d).

B0029O08WA|5.0|I listened to the sountrack early with youtube they had 30 second clips of each song, I said to myself eh, it isnt that great. I just purchased the cd today the 16th and found myself wonderfully surprised. The 30 second clips did not do the songs justice! The overall mood and melodys fit into the movie perfectly even Muse's remixed version of the upbeat song,\\" I belong to you\\". I highly recomend purchasing this and listening to the notes that fit so well with the beautiful story of New Moon.

1594201927|4.0|If you want to understand how finance affects the world, or how our current system came to be, this is a brilliant book that gives a wonderful account of the history of financial systems.  In fact, I believe Mr. Ferguson makes a better historian than economist.  The book is riveting when it is recounting the collapses of our economic past.  But when he turns to using this history to prepare for the future, the wheels fall off.<br /><br />Basically, if you want to know what this book prescribes for you to prepare for economic downturns, I'll sum it up: diversify!  Shocking, I know.  But, I don't want to poke too much fun at it.  The history of insurance, bond markets, governmental borrowing and the profile of Chinese/American relations (he calls this Chimerica), were all very enlightening and will undoubtedly help me make wiser choices in the future.  But, if you are looking for a book to help with your personal finance issues, this one is not designed for that.  But if you want to know how we got to where we are, or the issues, trials and errors that got us here, then this is an awesome book.<br /><br />On a rather odd note, I did notice that the author has a deep love for the work of Richard Dawkins.  He used his concepts so many times that I thought he should be co-author.  I found this very unusual and sad really.  Why a world-class economist would use a tired, worn-out analogy as evolution is beyond me.  In fact, in the last chapter of the book, Mr. Ferguson spends the majority of the time constructing the case that economics is like evolution.  The craziest part of it is that the analogy does nothing to bring any clarity to finance.  When one uses analogy, the hope is to build a bridge of understanding for the reader.  In other words, use something familiar to bring something less familiar to light.  Trying to follow Ferguson's evolution analogy brought no clarity and in fact seemed to muddy the waters.  Not what one would expect from a Harvard professor.<br /><br />But overall, I enjoyed this walk through the museum of finance.  It gives us a greater understanding of today by brushing up against the past.  While he doesn't give advice on how to recession-proof your portfolio, he does give much background to issues that you will find playing on your mind when you are deciding where to put your next investment.I enjoyed this walk through the museum of finance.

I think they could have mixed it up a little more. There are some time that are happy & upbeat. I will waite until the movie to pass full judgement.

(The TVA Canadian release  is the one released April 28 2009, which has a cover image of the pianist's hands on the keyboard, shown from above.)    \\"The movie \\"The Pianist\\" is a moving and beautiful piece that truly deserves better treatment than this unfortunate 'cash grab' by TVA Films. The video maxes out at 1080i (yes, you read that correctly - not (P)rogressive) and the sound is (shudder) only Dolby Digital - not DolbyTrueHD or DTS Master HD. ... The packaging also seems sub-par with no actual Blue-Ray logo on the plastic (like every other BD disc out there) and the \\"1080p\\" gold logo is used on the back (and that is simply inaccurate). The disc, quite frankly, seems more like a bootleg than an actual new release BD. ...\\"     Also note that the TVA release is in full frame, not the original widescreen format.

B001HTLKCU|5.0|I bought Take That Ultimate Tour and was so disappointed with that DVD, that I did not consider getting another Take That DVD.  Then by chance I saw this show on the airplane ... It blew me away, even though it was a condensed 1 hour show.  After I returned home my first priority was to get this disc.  And it did not disappoint.  It was 2 hours of pure magic ....  elaborate sets, great lighting, and of course fantastic singing and showmanship.  LOVED it.

B0013XS8A2|5.0|This is one of the smartest purchases I have made in the world of music.  I remembered Oldfield fondly from \\"Tubular Bells\\" back when I was in college, and bought it just to find out how he had developed.  The man has grown into a giant, his genius is in full flower in this one.  It's a symphony with an amazing clarity and charm.  This is what music is supposed to be:  gets into your very soul and enriches it.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|This Ergotron arm extension was bought to mount a 22\\" HD monitor from which, in my particular situation, needed to be positioned directly above my computer monitor on a desk with sturdy shelving directly behind it.  The mounting of the extension base is by compression mount (think C-clamp) and allowed me to exactly choose where I located the base on that shelving to allow for the best swing and position of the monitor.   Once the monitor was mounted to the arm (with four screws, included) and positioned with the optimal tilt of the screen, allen-head screws were tightened at the joints needing to remain in a locked, stationary position.  The arm has performed perfectly.  It is of very sturdy construction and great design.  I couldn't have made a better choice if I would have spent four times the money.   I'm very satisfied with the purchase and highly recommend it to others who need to mount a monitor in the same way.
0810983915|3.0|My daughters and I eagerly awaited the latest adventures of Greg and company. We absolutely love the series and my daughters have read the first 3 books multiple times. We got \\"Dog Days\\" on Wednesday. One daughter read it that night, next daughter read it Thursday night, and I read it last night. While we liked it, the three of us agree that we didn't LOVE it. It was not nearly as funny as the previous books. For the first almost 3/4 of the book, Greg came across more whiney than funny and some of the stuff he talked about, like the hairy shower men, was just yucky. The book really got good when Greg started going to the pool to \\"hang out\\" with high school lifeguard Heather and the trip with Rowley and his family was great. It was just in the last 1/4 or so that I actually read some laugh-out-loud scenes. I did like how everything came together at the end.
1416955070|3.0|This book is like a less well written, sexier version of Harry Potter.  The plot is pretty unoriginal... villian that everyone thought was dead has suddenly emerged and is attempting to return to power and regular girl (doesn't mundy sound a little like muggle?) finds out she has special powers and is part of a supernatural world she never even knew existed!  We've all read this one before.      Maybe it's my fault for reading young adult novels in my late twenties, but there is a lot of YA romantic cheesiness here, and it is VERY contrived.      So why am I giving this book three stars even?  Because even when it's not done well, I'm a sucker for this kind of storyline.  This book tries too hard, but still is entertaining enough for me to be a decent beach reach.  I'll probably read the second book while I wait for the next Harry Potter or Twilight to come out.
0060920432|1.0|The perceptive reader will spot Csikszentmihalyi's first chapter as the standard introduction of a (usually religious) huckster: all these good and bad things go on in the world, you can't control them and feel lost a lot of the time; instead, don't fight it, forget all that and concentrate on developing your own individual happiness by increasing those moments of \\"optimal experience.\\" Follow my theory and learn to get into the \\"flow\\" in whatever you're doing, and life will feel so much more satisfying.  Or, put another way: \\"being in the zone\\" is a good feeling; learn to maximize its occurrences.    Counterpoint: What if your \\"optimal experience\\" comes from participating with others in collective activity to transform the world in some essential way, such as overthrowing an economic system that is built ideologically on the centrality and benefits of maximizing individual happiness?  The general theory then falls apart (it does with lesser collective goals as well).  Or, more properly, it is exposed for being a philosophical variant consistent with, and thus supportive of, the way capitalism (ostensibly) works.  It's not accidental that the author finds kinship with John Stuart Mill (though Mill is not listed separately in the references - and there is no index!).  Other reviewers have suggested a Zen-like underpinning to the author's ideas.  Whether or not that particular analysis is accurate, he does not have kind words for those who \\"try to achieve happiness on their own, with the support of a faith...\\"  In Csikszentmihalyi's view, the latter are chiefly out for wealth, power and sex.  So that's what atheism is all about! (btw, what's wrong with sex as a \\"chief goal?\\")    I came across this book from it being on the U.S. Ski Team's recommended reading list.  Stripped of it's general approach and put in the context of focused effort, i.e., allowing oneself to get into the moment and learning to stay there, it can be a helpful psychological tool for those who havetrouble doing that.  Almost all of us do at least at some moment or another.  But if going with the flow is frequently difficult to achieve, then there's likely a lot more that needs dealing with - and one's psychology may (or may not) be the center of it.      Csikszentmihalyi's Optimal Experience is another cognitively-centered psychological approach to dealing with life.  If, however, you believe that we are primarily products of our environment (actually multiple environments), and that willful human consciousness can be powerful but operates within a very narrow realm, then his general approach will not only seem thin, but also at heart anti-Darwinian.

0385504225|2.0|I am half way through the book and so far I am disapointed. First it is the Da Vince code with some modifications. Professor meets up with Girl being chased by insane man while searching for evidence of secret Pyramid made by the Freemasons, Hero does not believe in the secret (of course even though he found Christs Daughter in his last adventure, saved a PoPe in an adventure before that, but is still skeptical about a secret mason Pyramid) Our hero is a bit out of character in this thriller. Brown is into a formula I fear... sigh. So keep your expectations about this being another Da Vince code down, way down. Otherwise you will not be happy. OH and I got my copy from the Library. If I would have paid for it, I would have been jumping MAD. But since I got it at no cost, I am ok with it so far. I will keep reading and update at the end of the book

B000LAZDQA|1.0|Sofia (Sook-Yin Lee) is a relationship's expert. Her husband Rob (Raphael Barker) open this film with a very graphic sexual encounter. Whilst Sofia finds the sex satisfying, ironically, given her profession, she is yet to have an orgasm. This quest becomes one of the themes of the film.    She meets clients James (Paul Dawson - who looks a lot like Mark Whalberg) and Jamie (PJ DeBoy), a gay couple having their own relationship problems. They recommend to her to attend a club called \\"Shortbus\\" which is an anything goes sex club.    Sofia protests to all that she is in a very happy relationship with her husband, whom she loves. Her relationship with him seems to be happy. She stumbles upon a group of lesbians including Severin (aka Jennifer) (Lindsay Beamish) who we see earlier in the film as a dominatrix. Severin can't form a relationship with anyone. Sofia breaches professional guidelines by both acting as counsellor for Severin, and having sex with her.    That's the problem with this film. Whilst it is trying to promote a 'guilt-free' sex enviornment ultimately several of the lead characters continue to have relationship problems. All they end up doing is realigning their sex partners. This then becomes the social engineering message of the film. That: relationships don't matter, sex does. I found this annoying given that the film argues against itself in that several of the characters still desire to have relationships. Sure James and Jamie become a foursome (with the addition of Caleb, their stalker (Peter Stickles) and Ceth (Jay Brannan)), but the others do not progress to their own desired outcome. A celebratory sing-along at Shortbus at the end of the film does nothing to hide this point.
031606792X|3.0|After reading a lot of these very mixed reviews....here is what I have to say:    1. We were \\"screwed\\" over by the fade to black first time sex...could have been a little more steamy and thrilling.  2. The imprinting thing is weird but I didn't think of Jacob as a pedophile, especially since Meyer prepped us for it in Eclipse with one of the werewolves imprinting on a 2 year old.  3.The author is a mormon and therefore has very archaic ideations about sex, marriage and family.  Do a little research into her \\"religion\\" and you will know what I mean.  You get married so you can have sex, you have sex for procreation and you are supposed to have a lot of kids so you can populate the afterlife.    I do think it is cool that the characters are virgins and waited to be married to have sex, but then it should have been great sex from there on out, not once and your preggers and now hubby can't get past the whole your a mommy now thing!    Blah blah blah....just my opinion......made for interesting reading.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Definitely worth the money :D In the special features, there's a scene where Gerry Butler sang No One Would Listen. It's a very beautiful song. You can feel the softer side if the Phantom :D Unfortunately it was taken out from the actual movie :( You also get to watch the \\"history\\" of POTO... How it developed and how Andrew Loyd Webber started composing the musicals. :D
B000PC6Z48|5.0|A 1966 release directed by the legendary Sergio Corbucci, Django features Franco Nero as the title character in one of the greatest of the spaghetti western genre. The main character was adapted from a comic book anti-hero who drags a mysterious coffin behind him in search of answers and more importantly, revenge. Django, follows suit with other movies of its likeness, mainly the Leone \\"Dollars\\" films and yet it mixes its own twists and contributions that lend something to later films like Sabata and the Sartana trilogy. While few similarities can be traced from this film to the unofficial 30+ sequels, Django and its influence can be seen in other outlets like the video games Boktai, Gungrave and Red Dead Revolver, the music of Rancid, the anime series Cowboy Bebop and of course, the \\"ear scene\\" from Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. While the English dubbing does take away some of the style and feel of both the dialogue and the soundtrack, the movie itself stands alone as a premiere example of a spaghetti western in a time when the genre was really coming into its own and earning a place in cinema history.  Bandits, renegades, stolen gold, a fatal love, a corrupt general, a mysterious stranger dragging a coffin around... this one has it all! Fans of the man with no name films might disagree, but I say add this to the top of your \\"must watch\\" list.
B000CCD0HQ|2.0|My 2-star rating isn't for the material: ZZ Top's seminal work merits 4-5 stars. Nor is it for the mix: the original mix as intended by the artist at the time of recording has indeed been restored. My gripe concerns the remastering. There's an error in \\"LaGrange\\" at 2:22: in the process of \\"cleaning up\\" the original master to create a master for CD, about 1/4 second or 1-2 beats of Frank Beard's fill has been deleted. Most may not notice it, but being a drummer and having the song committed to memory, this error sticks out like a sore thumb, and now makes me question the integrity rest of the material, with which (with the exception of Bus/Jesus) I and other most casual fans are probably not quite so familiar. Bottom line: If you're intent is to buy \\"LaGrange,\\" arguably the song that best defines ZZ Top, get \\"Best of ZZ Top\\" or a vinyl copy instead and you won't miss a beat.
1416594787|5.0|I'm about 1/3 of the way through \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" and so far I'm very pleased with it.  It's exactly the book that needed to be written.  It carefully and clearly goes through the substantial evidence for evolution and lays out the case in a very thorough manner.  It's true that Dawkins spends SOME amount of time deriding the so-called \\"history deniers\\" as he likes to call them, but so far, I haven't found that to be distracting from the core of the book.    I recommend this book for anyone who has an interest in evolution, and who wants to know more about the scientific basis of the theory as well as the supporting theories such as radiometric dating and molecular biology.    BTW, I purchased this book on my Kindle.  The Kindle text has been excellent, though some of the color images do not, naturally, display.  That's a little disappointing.  But overall, great reading experience.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|The feature-length animated film that started it all, widely known as Disney's Folly before it premiered, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs(), hit shelves ,on October() 6th, in the Diamond Edition release, and it is an amazing treatment filled with special features. The package includes 2 Blu()-Ray() discs, and a standard DVD format copy of the film  Without question one of the best additions to a DVD release to come along, DisneyView is a real treat. While perhaps not adding tremendously in general, though seeing the movie in the expanded aspect is rather nice, it is simply awe-inspiring to watch this view and wonder at the effort and talent that went into creating it.    The Blu-ray treatment does in fact help animation contrary to the impressions of a few who think it's only for big budget blockbusters. Snow White's colors are enriched in the process and the audio has been cleared to perfection of any scratches or distortion - a common issue for older animated films.  Also, with this combo pack, you can opt for the experience your home theatre allows. With both discs, you can experience the film with a restored original mono soundtrack...intriguing for purists, but for me, you have to go with one of the digital surround blu-ray, a brand new uncompressed DTS 7.1 offering.   On the Blue-ray, the Magic Mirror is your host, taking you through all of the movie and even offering recommendations of what to do next. There are several games including, Jewel Jumble and Dopey's Wild Mine Ride. So many fun and interactive games and activities for the entire family to enjoy!
0385504225|2.0|I waited for this book with grat anticipation, but as I began reading it I found that most of the info was based on much of non-fiction books I have read over the past few years. I kept waiting for a  aha moment but it never came.  I felt the book was a let down after his other Langdon books.  I get a sense that Dan Brown had read the same non-fiction books I had read and turned them into a novel.  Sorry Mr. Brown but I was not impressed. J.L.
1416594787|3.0|This review is about one point Dawkins makes. He claims that there is 'grandeur in this view of life' in the overall evolutionary process because it leads to the creation of the 'higher animals'. But how many higher animals are there? Is he afraid to face the truth that there is one higher animal only , one animal capable of reading and understanding this, capable of evaluating scientific evidence, capable of exploring and understanding the universe, capable of Literature and Mathematics , capable too of conceiving of God?<br />What Grandeur would there be in this view of Life if it had led only to the gibbons and chimpanzees, to the whales and dolphins?<br />And in a related question . Why should the word ' grandeur' be used when we are talking about the 'life' on one small planet in one small solar system in which there are billions of suns and more than a billion galaxies?<br />Isn't there other words a whole effort on the part of Dawkins to deny the truth that the view of Life we come to from examining and understanding the scientific evidence as to the overall development of Life on Earth and the Cosmos in general when taken in and of itself is somewhat dismaying and even frightening?<br />'The silence of these infinite spaces casts us into dread' said Pascal.<br />And isn't there then sense in searching for a meaning and connection which not simply contains the process but also somehow transcends it?
6305972591|5.0|There are classic scenes that transcend time.  Linda Hamilton's little \\"throwaway\\" scene in the first 15 minutes of the movie is one of these classics. Her song and dance routine to \\"School is Out\\" is as cute and memorable as they come.  Thanks to the film editor who picked it up from the cutting room floor. Even if I don't watch the entire movie for the hundredth-something time (but I usually do), that scene always delights me.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I pre-ordered this soundtrack a while back before they announced any of the artists or songs that would be featured and I was a little skeptical about what I might find when it was released.  The Twilight Soundtrack had been on repeat in my car for months so I was hoping that the New Moon Soundtrack would be as good.  When I first heard this soundtrack last week on Myspace, I couldn't believe how beautiful the songs were.  It truly captures all of the emotions that I felt while reading the book and gives me high hopes that the New Moon Movie will be amazing!<br /><br />Some of my favorites include:<br />Possibility from Lykke Li<br />Satellite Heart from Anya Marina<br />Rosyln from Bon Iver & St. Vincent<br />The Violet Hour from Sea Wolf<br />No Sound But The Wind from The Editors<br /><br />Most of the songs are Indie Songs - which I LOVE because I think it captures the true spirit of the Twilight phenomenon.  I am so glad they didn't go with mainstream artists.  Most of the songs are also dark and moody - just like the book.  I have been listening to this non-stop on Myspace and I am anxiously awaiting Amazon to deliver my CD.<br /><br />I highly recommend this.
B002I9Z8G2|5.0|The picture quality was superb, as well as the audio. This has always been one of my favorite sci-fi movies, Trek or not. It is worth avoiding the DVD until you can pick up this version!

B001AQTWF2|5.0|Whitney Houston is a fantastic artist.  This CD has brought back such great  memories for me.  Whitney always knows how to reach into your heart and with the songs on this CD, you really cannot believe some of the things she had to put up with.  Just being married to Bobby Browm was enough.  I love hearing Whitney Houston.
0739319175|4.0|Problem with the first disk. The book on CD is wonderful, great story, but the first disk is damaged or recorded wrong and repeats and jumps around chapters.  I am on the last few chapters now and have not had a problem except for the first disk.
B000LE16VW|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies,ever since it came out on video. I bought this DVD as a backup, I have watched the one I have, many times and am afraid it will mess up because of the use.  You never know when they might discontinue it.  I would highly recommend it...  Jeanne
B002MW50KY|1.0|I think his voice and mind are both going at just about the same time. What's next? Bob and Martha Stewart together on a Christmas TV Special? This is all very spooky to me and hard to believe. Maybe AMAZON can change the rating system from stars to something else. Question marks perhaps. If they did, I'd rate this one question mark because quite frankly, I don't get it.

B0013LL2Z2|3.0|Logan lives in a world 300 years in the future, in a domed city where everyone's needs are met, there is no want or hunger, crime or poverty - the only catch is that life ends at 30, in a ceremony called \\"Carousel\\".  Alas every Utopia has its dissenters - in Logan's world they are \\"runners\\" who try to leave the city to find a place called \\"Sanctuary\\" where they can live to an old age - and Logan and his best pal Francis are Sandmen, who put the runners they catch to \\"sleep.\\"  You see where this is going, don't you?<br /><br />But Logan doesn't run voluntarily, he's sent on a mission by the computer that controls the city.  Why Logan?  It's never explained; suffice it to say he's been picked and the funky crystal that he, like all citizens has imprinted in his hand (\\"life clock) has started blinking - indicating that he's near \\"Last Day\\" rather than years away from it.  Logan has to leave, and he takes with him Jessica, a young woman who he thinks has ties to the rebels who are trying to help people to run.  After them will come the remorseless Francis....<br /><br />I loved this film as a kid; I didn't see it theatrically, but I believe it showed on network TV for the first time in the fall of 1977, just before the short-lived [[ASIN:B000SLRURW television show]] (with a different cast) began, and I saw it then.  Even at 11 I was blown away by how hot Jenny Agutter was as Jessica in her ridiculously sexy outfits (sexier even than Charlie's Angel Farrah Fawcett in her brief role); I wonder if I noticed then how odd it was that both she and Logan (Michael York) spoke in upper-crusty British accents, despite this enclosed city being (as it turns out) just a day or two's walk from Washington DC.  I suspect that I didn't notice how silly the last third of the film is, as Logan and Jessica wander the overgrown capital (pretty nice matte paintings here), meet an old man (yet another Brit, Peter Ustinov), and eventually go back to the city, where we get to see the hoary sci-fi cliche (probably hoary even then) of the computer not being able to compute and blowing up.  Sorry, I don't think that's an idea that's ever been done well, at least not on film.<br /><br />So a promising beginning, with some nice - if very mall-like - interiors and set design and a good cast gets significantly derailed by general plot stupidity and cliches at the end -  and it doesn't wear its age well when you compare it to the next year's STAR WARS or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.  Pretty solid Jerry Goldsmith score.<br /><br />There's a short making-of doc on the DVD that was done at the time of the film, a promo reel in most respects, which isn't bad; and commentary by director Anderson and star York which is fun.  Certainly worth having for the dedicated science fiction lover or historian of the genre; it's not one of my favorites really, but I'm glad I have it, and it's one of those films that always seems better in the memory than it actually is when I'm watching it.  For memory's sake I suppose it would be deserving of ****; but as I just watched it, I've got to be honest and take off those rose-colored glasses.bably hoary even then) of the computer not being able to compute and blowing up.

B002K0WBXW|2.0|Another formula romantic comedy with all the stereotypes. Do these typecasts sound familiar?   (1.) Testosterone promotion driven female boss puts her job above relationships.   (2.) Resulting in cowering subservient male and female workers.   (3.) Enter some bureaucratic government worker to create some improbable scenario that sends boss into emergency action to protect her job.  (4.) Which results in boss having to rescue her job by developing a relationship with one of her workers.   (5.) Subservient worker gets back at the boss by having her meet the family. Family has a couple of issues tossed in to add some dynamic tension.  (6.) But overall the family/community is real down-home country with a lot of money (just to show that money doesn't matter).   (7.) Denouement - boss comes to grips with her lack of humanity and marries worker.     Too scripted, nothing new,  but a formula that works because there's always an audience for romantic tension comedies.   One extra star for setting and a few good minor roles.
0385504225|3.0|It was touted by so many to be Dan Brown's best novel ever.    While very good, with the intrique, twists and turns of every Dan Brown  novel, I did not find it to be the best ever of Mr. Brown's mystery novels.    Of the several Dan Brown novels I have read, \\"Angels And Demons\\" ranks as  the best, followed by \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".    Still, I would recommend \\"Lost Symbol\\" for all who savor mystery novels written  in the compelling, intriquing style of authors like Dan Brown and my all time  favorite author of mystery novels, Eric Ambler, who also had many of his novels made into movies.    One test of a spell binding, intriquing mystery novel?  One finds it very difficult to put the book down at the end of a chapter.  \\"Lost Symbol\\" passes this test.    Norm

1559409010|5.0|You have to not take it too seriously, especially if you are an easily offended christian. It is about a regular guy who get's mistaken for the Messiah.  There are so many great parodies of some of the dumb things that people do, like breaking into the sect of the gourd or the shoe and fighting about it.  Love this movie.  Always remember, \\"Look on the bright side of life...\\"
0465043577|3.0|Understanding that it is a book written with an unsophisticated audience (myself included) in mind, I would still like to have seen a little more in the way of math, i.e., examples or derivations, when appropriate, to go along with the cartoons.  As is, both sides of the argument have to be taken on faith which is exactly what he is arguing against.  Still a good read.
140258640X|5.0|My Sister's Keeper is an unabridged audiobook rendition of Jodi Picoult's novel about a family's troubles, and complex moral quandaries. Thirteen-year-old Anna Fitzgerald was deliberately conceived to help her older sister Kate with her struggle against leukemia. All her life Anna has provided platelets, bone marrow, and even stem cells; now, she is expected to donate a kidney. Exhausted by the increasingly invasive medical procedures, Anna hires a lawyer to sue for control of her own body. Anna's mother dusts off her law degree to represent Kate. Meanwhile, the Anna and Kate's neglected older brother Jesse is caught in an increasingly self-destructive spiral of drugs and arson. A poignant, emotional saga of heart-wrenching family conflicts with no easy answers and no obvious rule of right and wrong, brought to life by multiple narrators, My Sister's Keeper is highly recommended especially for public library audiobook collections. 12 CDs, 13.75 hours.
B0025KVLTW|4.0|All I can really say is....If you like this stereo mix....You will probably like SGT PEPPER and REVOLVER as well....it isn't that hokey \\"music-left/vocals-right\\" wannabe stereo that I have been ragging about....This is actually listenable and enjoyable....The remastering job is pretty good...aside from the sound is a tad bright at times<br /><br />The last so-called remastering they did of this album...was pretty tinny sounding and lacked some bass in various spots.....They corrected that issue on this series...and got it right....I also have the MONO REMASTER of this cd...and it definitely is a major sonic step up.<br /><br />As with all the remaster CD's in this series...the packaging is a treat and a delight for Beatle fans.<br /><br />I would say....All in all...it's worth the investment.
B00129H7VS|5.0|My husband and I have been watching the dvd series together.  It is really cool to have the actually EZ company members share stories before the episode begins.  Difficult for me to watch because it portrays what actually happens in war, but that is also it's strength because it doesn't sugar coat WWII events.  Important to see what actually happens instead of pretend that horrific events never happened.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|This album was basically a collection of solo efforts by each of the 4 Beatles....as by this stage of their career...they refused to work in the studio with each other...at least ofr very long.<br /><br />They recorded their individual tracks and then the others would come in...independantly and work with George Martin to fill in their dubbed parts...until the project was complete....Am guessing this was a true nightmare for Mr Martin.  Paul McCartneys first solo album was created using a similar recording technique of overdubs and mutitracking.<br /><br />Overall there is a dark undertone to the songs....a sort of sadness and depression...Which peaks with the REVOLUTION #9 track that has been suggested hints at Paul McCartneys death in a car crash circa 1966 during the Sgt Pepper sessions...following a studio argument in which Paul storms out of the studio and drives away in the early morning hours....never to return.<br /><br />The final track....GOODNIGHT,  is a nice lullabye featuring Ringo on vocals.  A strange contrast to the previous 9 minute epic.<br /><br />This is probably my least favourite Beatles album.....just for the fact I remember all the dissention and hostility fuming thru the Beatles world at that time...We all knew that a breakup was eventual...Just a matter of when.<br /><br />This is a must have for all Beatle fans....the mix tends to be bass heavy.....but overall it has a nice clean, clear sound.

6304493681|3.0|I saw this film around the same time as 'Akira', and was struck by the similarity between the two. 'Ghost In The Shell' has a similar sci-fi/cyberpunk atmosphere, and features outstanding animation and artistic quality. But there is also the same sense of style overcoming substance, and the whole experience left me feeling a bit flat.     First off, the animation: it was some of the best of its time, with a seamless integration of hand-drawn and CG elements. The anime really succeeds at bringing to life this futuristic, AI-dominated world. Just a pity it couldn't make a story to go with it.     Like 'Akira', 'Ghost In The Shell' is a compression of a very long manga, and again it feels too rushed and sketchy to satisfy. Apparently the story was taken from the very first and very last part of the manga, meaning the film has a first and third act but not a second. It really does feel as if the movie jumps straight from the set-up to the conclusion without much substance in between. At under 90 minutes, this film simply cannot do justice to its very complex, detailed story.     In a similar vein, the characters are given little room for development; they're all cold, ruthless, determined types, and the heavy focus on the Major means the remaining members of Section 9 are given cameo roles at best. Why does the Major look so different from her manga appearance? And all that nudity is just distracting.....yes, we GOT the point the first time....they overdid that concept to the point of it being gratuitous.     It's probably better to view the various television series first, or even better, to read the manga. Both of these do a much better job of fleshing out the story, environment and characters of this world. The film makes far more sense as an extension or conclusion to these series than as a stand-alone piece.

B0015I2P0Y|4.0|Quite simply, stumbling upon Elbow has been an ear-opening experience. I heard that the band characterized itself as a prog band with the solos--interesting and pretty much on the level from what I have heard on \\"Seldom Seen Kid.\\" Texture and understated energy swell through the songs, and the lyrics are both puzzling and dazzling compared with the dross and clich&eacute;-ridden themes of a great deal of music.  After several complete listens, I find myself wishing for a fewer strings in spots and a bit of stretching out in others (in other words, solos), but those are minor points.<br /><br />I think what has really excited me is that Elbow favorably evokes memories of the long-lost English band Family, and after seeing a few videos, I think Gus Garvey and Roger Chapman are kindred spirits. The approach to music also reminds me of Family as Elbow seems willing to dig a bit deeper to hone their sound without resorting to imitation or repetition.<br /><br />It looks like I am going to have to expand the \\"E\\" section in my CD collection over the next few months.

B000Z8GZYW|4.0|An excellent turn by Bill Murray carries the film.  Andie McDowell, while an attractive model, does not display strong acting chops here.  She is runover by the Murray star vehicle.  Decent supporting cast with Chris Elliot, Brian Doyle Murray, Steven Tobolsky and others round out the picture.  With Murray's patented mugging and fish out of water character stuck in the same day, in the same place ad infitinum it could have been quite tedious to watch, but as he relived the same day over and over there was a growth in his character's humanity.  Perhaps a kind of pergatory for his lack of humanity.  Reminded me of being stuck in Carlisle, Pa. in the snow and having been told to stay just another day or two on an assignment.  I find it an enjoyable screwball comedy.

B0025KVLSI|5.0|If ever there was a person to earn the title of \\"5th Beatle\\"....it would surely have been George Martin and Brian Epstein....and NOT New York radio DJ, Murray the K.<br /><br />Martins invaluable knowledge of musical theory and arrangement, as well as his vast overall familiarity with each of the instruments and vocalizing; plus his willingness to bet on a longshot and take risks.<br /><br />It was Brian Epsteins original interest in the band that convinced them to change their appeance/image and got them in the doors at Parlophone in the first place.<br /><br />When you listen back to 1962 to the Decca Tapes, the Tony Sheridan recordings and the Star Club in Hamburg,Germany.....It doesn't take a genius to figure out that NOBODY transcends from being a barely competent musician to the Beatle level in only 14 or 15 months. Also keep in mind that short of Paul McCartney, no one in the band had any formal musical training.<br /><br />I believe this is where George Martin and Brian Epstein come into the picture....Their guidance and vision took a group of 4 very ambitious young men who were extremely talented; yet raw and and transformed them into the biggest band of the century. In very short order, they became better than any of their peers. The bands appearance took on a new look....as well as their sound..<br /><br />In the studio....Martin undoubtedly helped them to polish their vocal and musical skills...showing them the tips and secrets only the pros were familiar with. It was Martin who helped them accelerate their prowess of the piano and organ...as well as giving them tips on how to accentuate their playing style on guitar, bass and drums..This is the job of a good producer....to get the most out of the performer and to capture it all on tape.<br /><br />So.....If there ever was ANYBODY who deserved to be referred to as a \\"5th Beatle\\"....It would have to be George Martin and Brian Epstein. These 2 men were every much a Beatle as the 4 who you saw on all the records and cd's.<br /><br />When I think back to all the hoopla that was associated with Beatlemania....I am really convinced that it wasn't all hype at all....These guys (with the help of Brian and George) really deserved all that attention and they truly were a phenomenon and destined to be the BAND OF THE CENTURY.<br /><br />If you doubt me....just listen to the music.<br />***************************************<br /><br />I really have to say....George Martin had the Stereo technique down to a science on AHDN and Beatles for Sale.....<br /><br />A double thumbs up goes out for this album....love it till you die.cords and cd's.<br /><br />When I think back to all the hoopla that was associated with Beatlemania....I am really convinced that it wasn't all hype at all....These guys (with the help of Brian and George) really deserved all that attention and they truly were a phenomenon and destined to be the BAND OF THE CENTURY.<br /><br />If you doubt me....just listen to the music.<br />***************************************<br /><br />I really have to say....George Martin had the Stereo technique down to a science on AHDN and Beatles for Sale.....<br /><br />A double thumbs up goes out for this album....love it till you die.

I think I got shocked once when I was sweating excessively and the ear part got wet (gross, I know, but I was at the gym for a longtime that day).  It certainly is rugged and durable as it survived the wash after being left in my hoodie pocket for a full load cycle.

B001AKTZOQ|5.0|I'm one of those people who enjoyed Creedence front to back. They could do no wrong, they were American originals. That said...    ...Cosmo's Factory is an album, an experience, in the same way that [[ASIN:B0025KVLTM Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Remastered)]] is an experience and [[ASIN:B000002OZY Tommy]] is an experience. No, it's not a \\"rock opera,\\" and it's not a \\"concept album.\\" The only concept here is good music, written well and performed with fire. You don't buy this one to get \\"one or two good songs,\\" because they're ALL heavy hitters. All killer, no filler. The bonus tracks are great, but the album is a must-have, with or without them.    It's not even worth doing a track-by-track review, because every one is a winner. Let's just say that Fogerty is one of the FEW performers to tackle a Motown song, turn it inside out, and emerge a winner (all 11 ferocious minutes of \\"I Heard It Through The Grapevine\\"...tough, bluesy, swampy). \\"Ramble Tamble\\" continues the \\"Hellhound On My Trail\\" sense of blues foreboding, while EVERY other track...EVERY single one...found its way onto FM radio airwaves when the original album was released.    It's mighty, it's beautiful, it's a cherished relic from the time capsule that has not diminished a BIT with age. Stop reading this and buy your copy NOW.

B00005QGAT|3.0|Off The Wall is the CD that brought Michael into the mainstream audience and the CD that started Michael madness all over the world. He hadn't quite hit his masterpiece yet, that came with the next album, Thriller, but that doesn't mean that this album isn't choked full of fun dance around the room songs, either.<br /><br />TRACK LISTING:<br />1. Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough<br />2. Rock With You<br />3. Workin' Day And Night<br />4. Get On The Floor<br />5. Off The Wall<br />6. Girlfriend<br />7. She's Out Of My Life<br />8. I Can't Help It<br />9. It's The Falling In Love<br />10. Burn This Disco Out<br /><br />My favorites? Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, of course, because it's the song that brought him into the mainstream. Rock With You is another classic early Michael song. Workin' Day And Night, for some reason, makes me wanna dance in the kitchen with a mop. She's Out Of My Life is probably one of the best ballads I've ever heard, and I think when I hear it that only Michael could pull something like that off and make it sound good.<br /><br />It's the one that started it all -- you must have it!

B00005QGAV|4.0|Dangerous, Michael Jackson's first release of the 1990's and his first release without trusted producer Quincy Jones, was a big risk. It took a few new steps and took you in a different direction that people may not have been used to from the King of Pop, but it was well worth making the gamble.<br /><br />TRACK LISTING:<br />1. Jam<br />2. Why You Wanna Trip On Me<br />3. In The Closet<br />4. She Drives Me Wild<br />5. Remember The Time<br />6. Can't Let Her Get Away<br />7. Heal The World<br />8. Black Or White<br />9. Who Is It<br />10. Give In To Me<br />11. Will You Be There<br />12. Keep The Faith<br />13. Gone Too Soon<br />14. Dangerous<br /><br />My favorites from this album include Jam, because I just love dancing across the room to it, and the video with the king of basketball and the king of pop together was simply awesome, Remember The Time, because only Michael could take a song about losing a love and getting a broken heart and make a dance song out of it, Heal The World because it's such a personal and touching song, Black Or White because that IS Michael Jackson, breaking racial barriers with every song that come out, and Dangerous, because it's just a romp for the title track.<br /><br />A true Michael Jackson fan should own this album. It's one of his better works in the 1990's.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I found a copy of this yesterday, couldn't wait for it to get dark<br />and watched this visually creepy, macabre masterpiece of film making. Slowly moving in places and full of subtle winter chills, this odd love story mixed with a boys brutal adolescent  awakening  is haunting,  like nothing most of you will come across. This<br />stays in your mind long after you start dreaming. One of the greatest tales of a modern day vampire I have ever read or viewed, especially at<br />this time of the year, a mesmerizing chiller.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Thriller was a BIG deal when it first come out, mainly due to the wonderfully choreographed video of the same name. Thriller quickly went on to become the world's best selling album, and, if you actually sit and listen to it, and actually appreciate what you're listening to, then you'll fully and completely understand why this has grown to become the world's best selling album.<br /><br />TRACK LISTING:<br />1. Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'<br />2. Baby Me Mine<br />3. The Girl Is Mine (With Paul McCartney)<br />4. Thriller<br />5. Beat It<br />6. Billie Jean<br />7. Human Nature<br />8. PYT (Pretty Young Thing)<br />9. The Lady In My Life<br /><br />Now for my personal favorites on the album. While there's not a bad song on this album, my personal favorites include Wanna Be Startin' Somethin', Thriller (DUH!), Billie Jean (DUH!), and Beat It (DUH!). While every single song on here has something to offer someone, those four songs there alone are enough to want to own a copy of the world's best selling album.<br /><br />Trust me, any die-hard Michael Jackson fan will tell you that this album is the be all and end all for his albums. They don't get much better than this at all.
0061914177|5.0|I've owned a successful fitness business since 1994. But the last few years, even during a recession, have been some of my biggest, in large part due to implementing some of the strategies Gary teaches in Crush It. As much as I thought I knew, I realized there was a ton of great ideas and tools I wasn't even using. In Crush It Gary gets you up off your ass and motivated beyond words to absolutely dominate the world. I finished the book in one day and stayed up all night implementing the new techniques I learned from Gary. What I did in the past is going to be nothing compared to what I do in 2010. And I will use this book as my guide. Get your copy now or get left behind.   Jason Ferruggia  Strength & Conditioning Specialist  Chief Training Adviser, Men's Fitness Magazine
B00005QGAX|4.0|Right behind Thriller, I would consider BAD to be my second favorite Michael Jackson album. It was time, after Thriller, for Michael to show the world how bad he truly was. Hence the name of the album. And, to be fair to Michael, while he didn't get the success he did with Thriller, nor would he ever again in his lifetime, he definitely proved to everybody he's bad, and you know it.<br /><br />TRACK LISTING:<br />1. Bad<br />2. The Way You Make Me Feel<br />3. Speed Demon<br />4. Liberian Girl<br />5. Just Good Friends<br />6. Another Part Of Me<br />7. Man In The Mirror<br />8. I Just Can't Stop Loving You<br />9. Dirty Diana<br />10. Smooth Criminal<br />11. Leave Me Alone<br />13. Streetwalker<br />17. Fly Away<br />*Special edition, of course*<br /><br />My personal favorites on this album are Bad (he had to show the world he was bad,) The Way You Make Me Feel (which is a nice romp around the room song,) Man In The Mirror (because it's such a personal and touching song,) I Just Can't Stop Loving You (because I'm currently in that kind of situation and that song speaks to me because of it,) and, of course, Smooth Criminal (due to it being the ultimate dance song on the album!)<br /><br />A Michael Jackson fan should definitely own a copy of Bad. I don't see why they wouldn't want to.

B0021L9ME6|4.0|Yes, I like this movie.  No point here for me to defend the story/acting as it's personal taste. But I like very much how Pitof moves the camera, mostly during wide shots where the movement is quite eerie and gives nice display of the town by night ; he also has good ideas to switch from one scene to another (ex : the broken glass in the jewelry switching to the stolen jewels on Patience's bed).    Picture quality : 4.5/5  The colors are incredibly strong for a movie mostly shot at night. They're not bleeding and look very life like. Movement (sometimes very fast) seems fluid, light to dark scenes looks natural. Some CGIs (the cat resurrecting Prudence) seem a bit awkward, but it doesn't come from the trasfer, but from the film itself (didn't recognise any other CGI so they're not that bad.  Audio quality : 3/5  I'm not impressed by the audio quality, of course no explosions, roars of motors, elaborate music so it's quite difficult to judge only everiday life sounds. They feel realistic enough, but there's not much 3D dimension to sound.  Bonus features : 3/5  Deleted scenes, featurettes, trailers, quite the usual.
0307716988|5.0|That's where it all began.  That one single that turned the J5 into our little darlings.  The group sang it so effortlessly, but Michael Jackson lets us know in his book, MOONWALK, all the hard work and sweat that went into this finger-snapping ditty that I still can't stop dancing to.    Autobiographies don't usually impress me.  I don't feel that the subject can successfully view themselves in an objective manner.  But, perhaps that isn't what an autobiography is meant to do.  Maybe it's supposed to do what MJ has done here, which is write in simple english about certain areas of his life that he deems relevant and meaningful.     In this concise book, MJ reflects on his Motown days, an exciting time, to say the least.  You gleam his love, respect and admiration for the teachings of Berry Gordy, a man he considers a genius.  He shares the brotherhood that he had with his brothers, why they left Motown, feelings about his father.  In the book, Michael refers to Joseph Jackson as \\"Dad\\" quite a bit. I found it interesting.  He's a perfectionists who places a high demand on himself.  He sees what others don't; believes what others won't.  For certain, he believes in himself.  It is clear from the onset that Michael Jackson is holding back.  After all, he is a man of mystery, illusion and privacy.  He's saving some.  In these times of TMI (too much information) this holding back lends a naivete' and innocence to the book, though the story is being written by a seasoned veteran.  It is this that makes me chuck the rumors of the ghostwriter.  MJ did have a hand in writing this book; It took four years to complete, there's your proof.  If you're looking for gossip or chatter about highly personal matters, in the words of Michael, \\"Forget It.\\"     My favorite passage is when he speaks of being on stage, immersed in the music and losing his control.  You think, how often does Michael Jackson get to really lose control?  It sounds almost like a cleansing for him; A baptism.I enjoyed the expatiation he gives on the making of OFF THE WALL; THRILLER and BAD albums.  Also, the insight that he gives about the VICTORY TOUR.  This 2009 re-issue is well done.  There are photos, some black & white, some color.  Michael had his signature placed on the front of the cover so that everyone could feel like they have their own autographed copy, a thoughtful gesture, and exactly what I felt. Here's another for certain:  MJ had a dedication to his fans and to his craft.  You see that he is married to his work.  Michael Jackson IS music.  It's in his DNA.    Michael got me in the end.  I made it through the book with some laughter and comprehension.  Only at the second from the very last page (pg 282) did I become emotional.  Michael makes a statement that let me know he most certainly would understand what everyone who ever loved him, especially his fans, is feeling right now.
0143038583|2.0|At first, I was excited by The Omnivore's Dilemma, although aware that it was sparse on numbers and analysis.  That's journalism for you.  The reporting is a quick and easy read that held my interest while bashing things I didn't like and holding out hope for a better food system that would still give us access to tastey meats and fresh veggies.<br /><br />However, as I read through to the end of the book, my annoyance with Pollan--writing from the perspective of a rationalist and ecologist--over his off-hand but serious references to notions like \\"karmic debt\\" combined with his inconsistent prose left me thinking I should give the book no more than 3 stars.  And after reading some of the other Amazon reviews, I feel the book deserves something more like 1 or 2 stars.  While I accept that journalism is intellectually thin, I expect reported \\"facts\\" to be accurate.  If you read through some of these reviews, however, you will find a multidude of relevant criticisms.<br /><br />In Pollan's defense, many of the negative reviews are people who weren't interested in reading about Pollan's personal experiences, and these experiences were part of the point of the book.  It is a personal account, and such an approach fits perfectly with Pollan's view of ethics and aesthetics.  While all of his hand-wringing over hunting, for example, is laughable for those not confined by his class biases, everyone is confined by biases and Pollan's attempt to report his own experience is acceptable.<br /><br />Other negative reviews criticize Pollan for lacking depth in addressing problems or not addressing questions that interested the reviewer, such as whether or not it would be easy for corn farmers to switch to something else.  But this depth in narrow analysis is not what the book aimed to do.  It aimed to give unknowedgeable readers an introduction to a variety of topics related to food by way of first-person investigation.  If you are already well versed in economic and ecologic problems of our food supply chain, this book wasn't written for you.  If you aren't, it may be a fascinating read.<br /><br />But it's the fact that the book is aimed at the general reader that makes factual problems so gross.  If it were a work of fiction, Omnivore's Dilemma would be absolutely worthless since it relies on revelation for literary impact.  It is only as non-fiction that it has value.  So, for example, if it is true, as one reviewer claims, that he did the math and that a bushel of corn does not, in fact, contain fewer calories than the petroleum that went into producing it (as Pollan claims), that's a serious problem for the book.  Pollan should have stuck to reporting what he saw rather than quoting analysis, which isn't what the book is, or could be, about.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book?  I guess, yes, but only because I share some of the biases that Pollan does.  For example, I think it would be okay if Americans spent a larger proportion of their income on their food, but that's a personal choice.  Like Pollan, my real problem with the beef industry is that I want better beef.  In Omnivore's Dilemma, Pollan tries to put moral spin on our joint preferences, but I can't entirely buy it.<br /><br />In the end, I would have to say that Omnivore's Dilemma is something like food snob porn.  If your reservations about fast food are primarily economic or medical and not gustatory, you're not going to care about this book.  On the other hand, if you're willing to spend your leisure time and expendable cash to improve the quality of your diet, you may find--as I did--a wealth of small revelations that make the book a page-turner despite its drawbacks.chain, this book wasn't written for you.

B000Q6GUTI|5.0|I love the movie, lots of action and the good guy got the bad guys.  Just the wasy it should be.
B002QNR4GC|3.0|I really liked the concept, to return to the two central characters on the same day each year and see where they were at with their lives. However I found the story a little mundane until a crisis in one of the characters families...which is where I felt a distinct turning point, almost as if the author had used emotional blackmail to hook me in.<br />As characters both Dexter and Emma were very believable but I can't deny that I really wanted to slap some sense into both of them at times though...why didn't they just communicate!???<br /><br />I did enjoy the dry humour and the era it was set in (myself being in my teens in the eighties, getting married the year Dex and Emma graduated) but I also found it depressing. That's possibly a compliment to the author because I obviously got attached to the characters and what they stood for, but it really wasn't making it a fun read...there were lovely romantic moments, memories and honesty...but no optimism. I finished the book feeling flat.

0440241901|2.0|This book did have a few laugh-out-loud moments and was a reasonably entertaining \\"check your brain at the door\\" type of read. However, the plot was pretty silly and unrealistic. The main character, Emma, is a little less pathologically self-centered than Becky in the Shopaholic series, but only a little. Like Becky, she also lies constantly to everyone, including her closest friends and family, which disturbed me.    The plot is a typical Cinderella story down to the wicked stepsister (cousin, in this version). Emma has a miserable life until she is rescued by a Prince Charming who is extremely wealthy, much older than her, and, did we mention, her boss? I found it creepy that Jack never even worries about the ethics of dating his most junior employee. Not to mention he betrays her deepest confidences on national television, but she still takes him back. I feel like books like this perpetuate stereotypes by portraying women as helpless, ditzy bimbos who need older men to sweep in and fix the injustices of their lives.

B00006I53S|4.0|I'll keep this short and simple.    Pros  -Great walk around lens(in the right conditions).  -IS is a plus  -Auto focus is OK  -Weight is not an issue.    Cons  -My copy pulled dust in.  After a few trips to Utah/Arizona and a few hundred shots in less than hospitable conditions I did notice dust in it.  This lens was great for a couple years, but time and the elements caught up with it.    Bottom line  -If you baby your equipment and don't plan on backpacking this is a great lens.  If you plan on getting dirty, save up for one that's sealed.
B001P3SA94|4.0|\\"Cadillac Records\\"  (2009)  ------------------------------------------  Let me start by saying that I am a huge, lifelong fan of Chess Records, particularly of Howlin' Wolf and Little Walter, as well as Sugar Pie DeSanto and others.  Having a movie that celebrates this fabled, groundbreaking, immensely important, immensely influential blues powerhouse is a good thing. But, like almost all \\"historical\\" films and biopics, this is riddled with unnecessary factual errors and other shortcomings.  Also, it just wasn't as great as it could have and should have been.    I think perhaps the biggest problem was with the portrayal of label co-founder Leonard Chess (and, um, hey, what happened to his brother, who also ran the label?). I think Adrien Brody, who I like and respect as an actor, was badly miscast in this role.  He had none of the rough edges that I image a figure like Chess would have had, none of that big city ruggedness or tough-guy street smarts: it just wasn't there. He also seemed to have little chemistry with any of his fellow actors, and little feel for the role. I also imagine that a guy like Chess would have been immensely charming and likable, even when he was jerking you around, but I didn't get that from Brody's portrayal, either -- his Chess was saintly and businesslike, but not a guy you'd want to have a drink with, or record for. Ah, what someone like Paul Rudd could have done with this part!    Also, there's the tiresome Hollywood habit of mucking with the facts when making a \\"historical\\" film. Other reviewers have noted several problems... what stood out for me was the general timeline: the Beach Boys are famous before Elvis Presley; Little Walter is killed sometime (apparently) around 1965 (instead of '68, when he actually died) and the big wowzer ending is when Muddy Waters & Co. are invited to tour Europe in the late 'Sixties, after Chess Records had been sold and the whole shebang was long over (in fact, pioneering blues musician, Waters included, had been touring Europe for several years by then, and had already been lionized by the Rolling Stones and the British blues bands for half a decade... The film shows this happening much later than it really did.)    The whole messing up the facts thing baffles me.  It seems that Hollywood screenwriters have given themselves a blank check to re-write whatever they want to in historically-oriented films, in the interest of \\"tweaking\\" the script, giving it more dramatic oomph, etc., and they will sarcastically remark that all of us who complain are just being too literal and taking things too seriously. The thing is, though, that details *do* matter, and if you don't want to stick to the facts, then why pick a historical topic for your film?  If you think you've got a good story to begin with, shouldn't it be good enough to tell without blatantly distorting the facts?  It's laziness on their part, not creative genius.     Anyway, \\"Cadillac Records\\" was fun enough, but it could have, and should have, been great. It's worth watching, and hopefully it will succeed in turning some folks onto the classic urban blues recordings of the 1950s. It got me to dig out some of my old LPs.  (Axton, Planet Krankulon)

Songs are starting to all sound the same(\\"I Will Not Bow\\" sounds alot like \\"Diary Of Jane\\"). Lyrical content isn't changing much(same Dark,Miserable outlook). As a fan of the group though, I still enjoy \\"Dear Agony\\" for what it is. I would just like to see the group step a bit more outside the box. This cd starts out strong with \\"Fade Away\\", my personal favorite, \\" I Will Not Bow\\", and \\"Crawl\\". Falls off a bit with \\"Give Me Sign\\", \\"Hopeless\\", \\"What Lies Beneath\\", and \\"Anthem Of The Angels\\". Then finishes strong with \\"Lights Out\\", \\"Dear Agony\\", \\"Into The Nothing\\", and \\"Without You\\". Overall slightly better than \\"Phobia\\", but not outstanding due to feeling too much like a touch up job.
1416550542|5.0|Morton really knows how to weave a story.  I don't often write reviews but this is a book I would highly recommend.   One hates to see this lovely novel come to an end.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  Could not put it down.  It is a mystery intertwined with fairy tales and makes into a wonderful novel.
0385504225|3.0|I like Dan Brown's books as they are light and entertaining.  What I deeply wish is that he stops this fake and annoying suspense that he tries to introduce at the end of each and every little chapter as he thinks he is engaging the reader by getting us to keep going in the book trying to find what happens.  This works sometimes, but when it becomes a predictable 'fake suspense' stunt, it is annoying.    Here is a suggestion that I am certain will make Dan the best fiction writer of all times, should he follow my idea: (suspense...), well you have to read my future comment to find out :)...
B002S0OBFK|5.0|Great horror film. The only other theatrical screenings I've been to that were close to this are The Exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, & Alien.<br />This one starts slow, develops the characters well, and progessively gets more suspenseful until it ends with it's penultimate finale. Easily the best horror offering in the last 20 years. If you're into gore and blood like Saw and Hostel, you'll be disappointed. If you like an edge-of-your-seat thriller with excellent acting & direction, this is for you. Don't listen to the negative reviews by people that try to compare this to movies that scared them when they were children. This is the real deal for horror fans.
B002L5GQGY|3.0|The GOOD: Bonamassa is a great guitar player and a pretty good singer. The dvd has overall excellent sound and production values. (Seems like it was done by the same folks who did the Cream reunion and Clapton-Winwood DVDs) and its always great to see a motivated Eric Clapton. If you are a FAN...you will love it.    The BAD: The songs are weak. No memorable tunes in the lot. In my opinion, I think Joe \\"oversings\\" and \\"over-emotes.\\" To me his singing is very \\"contrived.\\" And he flat out overplays. \\"guitarists disease\\". For all of Joe's talents, his guitar playing lacks the true lyricism of  the genius of  Jeff Beck, whom he so clearly attempts to imitate. If you're gonna pay such homage to your heroes, unflattering comparison is inevitable.    The UGLY: Ultimately this whole DVD falls flat. And WHY is it on 2 discs? All of this material would easily fit on one. I get the feeling that Joe is a very nice person but on stage he has NO charisma. When Bonamassa plays the well-worn 5 note blues cliche opening of \\"Blues Deluxe\\" I feel nothing. When BB plays the EXACT same notes, it can make me cry and laugh at the same time. For all the flash and speed and articulation and virtuosity, it all comes up so very....boring. The Yngwie Malmsteen of modern blues playing. Also when Claton guests the volume of Eric's guitar is about 60% of Joes in the mix. This is the case with every single guitar players DVD I have ever seen. when the guest comes out, his volume is always significantly less then the stars. I hate that. Joe obviously respects and loves Clapton but in the \\"mixing\\" of the sound I can absolutely guarantee the words \\"turn him down.\\" were said. The whole show seems to sink under the weight of its own self-importance. I was hoping to become a \\"fan\\", as I was vaguely familiar with Joe though the various guitar publications, so for me it was a huge disappointment.
0061914177|5.0|If you've got something you absolutely love with all that you are, but just need that extra boost from a beyond credited, enthusiastic, and inspiring source, this book is for you. As a blogger myself, I was baffled and slightly embarrassed to see some of the game plans and must do's Gary lays out in this book that I have yet to take advantage of (but am getting after as we speak).     When you start reading the book you immediately realize that this is not just any other piece of literature. The reason I could not put the book down once I started was because it's as if you're having a one-on-one conversation with Gary; a consultation of sorts, and you don't want the conversation to end. His voice comes through so loud and clear. He offers a wide variety of examples and scenarios that can cater to everyone and anyone. Because this book is to help show you how YOU, no matter what your passion, can start to cash in on what it is that makes you tick.    Crush It! is a no BS, straight forward, and honest book that will have you so amped up at the end, you won't be able to contain yourself. Because you know what? It's a realization and a confirmation that as long as you're willing to work your face off for what you know and believe and love, love, love, then you can and will make it happen.    Thank you, Gary, for helping us all to realize the power of our passions by sharing all of you with us. Everytime I glance over at the book, I'm inspired. And more importantly? Beyond happy and excited for what's to come now that I've got the tools.    Crush it.

0691142165|4.0|There are already several good reviews so I will only suggest reading the following interesting books dealing with long-term economics in addition to this work [which, because of the authors' style, without being dry, is often somehow not engaging, so my rate is between 5 -content- and 3 -pleasure-]: 1) \\"Power and Plenty: Trade, War, and the World Economy in the Second Millennium\\" by Ronald Findlay and Kevin H. O'Rourke; 2 - 3): \\"The world economy. A millennial perspective\\" (2001) plus \\"The world economy: Historical Statistics\\" (2003) by Angus Maddison (a combined edition of these two volumes appeared on December 2007); 4) \\"Historical Dynamics: Why States Rise and Fall\\" by Peter Turchin; 5) \\"Why Europe Was First: Social Change and Economic Growth in Europe and East Asia, 1500-2050\\" by Erik Ringmar; and 6) \\"The mind and the market: capitalism in Western thought\\" by Jerry Muller.
0439023491|5.0|Katniss Everdeen, recent winner of the cruel Hunger Games imposed by her tyrannical government, is back home, \\"enjoying\\" the spoils of victory and trying to help her starving neighbors--until the president of the country himself turns up and blames her for sparking a revolt. As he threatens her more and more in several malicious twists, Katniss must decide what is more important: protecting her family and herself, or giving her countrymen a chance for a free life.<br />Considering that Catching Fire (along with its prequel, The Hunger Games) is currently at the top of the children's bestseller list, it hardly needs my recommendation--but it was so well-written it more than deserves my praise. Anyone of the thousands of people who read The Hunger Games can attest to Suzanne Collins' \\"mad skills\\" in plotting, but what amazed me in the sequel was her ability to pace her plot so perfectly. I've read stories with great plots that fall short because of pacing alone; Suzanne Collins is the exact opposite. Her sense of timing within the telling of her story is so perfect that it immediately sets her book apart. She makes an art out of the \\"I-can't-put-this-book-down\\" factor.<br />On top of that, Catching Fire is a perfect sequel. There's no awkwardness or forcing of back story, but the plot of Hunger Games is made clear while allowing the story of this book to stand completely on its own.<br />Lastly (not really, but the last thing I'll mention), the characters are amazing. Katniss may be the most realistic non-girly girl I've ever read. The secondary characters are so real, you worry about them as much as Katniss does. Even the minor characters are three-dimensional and believable; you could imagine any one of them suddenly becoming a major player in Book Three.<br />Nota bene: Catching Fire is very violent; consider that the central event of the trilogy is a gladiator-type \\"game\\" where the players fight to the death. If you have a weak stomach, you may wish to avoid this novel. Obviously all readers have different levels of tolerance, but I would recommend this book to mature readers only.<br />(To read my full review, you can visit my blog: [...])novel.

B000JQUMPI|5.0|Like the previous reviewer, I was surprised to find that he book I had been occasionally rereading for over 50 years was NOT the original novel.  My own copy, much loved and well thumbed, has been with me since I was a ten year old.  I bought the Kindle version just to have it in my portable library, since I thought I knew it almost by heart.  To my surprise, when I started looking it over, I found that the book was not the same at all.  My original copy must  have been &#34;modernized&#34; at some point. All of the familiar passages were there, but there was a great deal that I didn't remember reading before.  Some of that was a specifically Victorian kind of moralizing, but there was also some expansion of the story.. I'm not sure that I would have appreciated it all when I was younger, but I found it a delight to read now, as an example of a book of its times. Now I'm going to download the rest of the Alcott catalogue and see how it compares to the books I thought were the originals when I read them many years ago. This was still an exemplary book.  It will always be one of the classics.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|After reading The Hunger Games it was suggested I'd read The Maze Runner and that was great advise! It was suspeneful and may have been a little confusing so if you struggle reading comprehension you could give it a go but try the sample first.   It is a great book for sci-fi loving teens and older!  CAN'T WAIT FOR BOOK 2!!!
0375842209|5.0|When I tried to read this book, I couldn't get the flow of the author.  Luckily for me, the semester at school started and I got the book on CD for my daily 2 hour commute.  To hear the book on CD was so much better.  I loved the German accent and to hear the pronunciation of the many German words in the book.  I sat on the edge of my seat, gripping the steering wheel as the narrator would read a title and I what I thought might happen based on that title ALMOST happens!  Heart wrenching, beautiful story.  I loved every minute of it!
0393327655|5.0|This book reinforced my mindset about religion, that is, myths and fairy tales.  I was surprised that Sam Harris has a leaning to Buddhism--I'd have thought he had no beliefs whatsoever--or perhaps was into Zen meditation or Taoism.  In my opinion, Buddhism contains some elements of Christianity.  In fact, some believe Jesus learned to meditate from Buddhists. (This isn't in the book though)  The essence of the book is that religion contains the seeds of our own destruction as a civilization, if that wasn't already obvious to begin with.  What is worse, is that religion is entrenched at the highest levels of government.  In fact, to be President of the United States, it is an [unwritten] requirement to have some kind of faith.  And if it isn't Christianity, then you might as well not run.  Reagan even had a tacit belief in astrology.  Will there ever be an end of relgion as we know it?  Not unless we see an end of stupid people.  And that is unlikely.
0385504225|5.0|Holds your interest. Gripping at times. Interesting philosophies expressed.an Browns books are all worth reading.
0061914177|5.0|I'm a long time Vayniak and I'm halfway through this book. Gary nails it when he talks about passion, family, dedication and work. Like the saying goes, do what you love and figure out a way to make it work for you. We're living in the middle of the self-branding revolution and now is the time to take advantage of it.
B0027G783W|2.0|For me, Moby has been one of those artists where I will pick up his CD without knowing anything about it, or having heard any of the songs.  I think the only album I don't own is Hotel.  I discovered him with Play, and continued forward and backwards through his work.  I was surprised with Animal Rights, and that he can shred on a guitar.  This CD sucks.  I did not like it at all.  I'm so tired of the gospel track remix he does, over and over and over again.  I always found his past work to be quite immersive.  This one is just blah.  I won't be buying another album from him, or at least I'll be putting him in the category of \\"must listen to first before buying.\\"
B00004RFCM|3.0|fast shipping, but packaging came slightly damaged, when it was supposed to be shipped 'new.'
B002PEP4SC|4.0|For fans of the TV series, this book is a lot of fun! Had to purchase this when a page number was referenced on the show!!! I know, just as ABC intended, but it was well worth a look. Giggled out loud at a lot of the banter and really enjoyed the plot! Had it figured out pretty early but enjoyed the path to the conclusion! Can't wait to see where this leads!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Un fortunately, when I ordered these DVDS, I ordered Blue Ray instead of the regular. I returned the item and got a full refund on my credit card. I then ordered another DVD series and promptly got it back. So, the service I thought was exceptional. I recommend your we
B001LPWGE6|5.0|James Bond is too pampered and spoiled.  Take away his ridiculous gadgets and fancy car, and he would be lost.    Not Jason Bourne.  Bourne relies more on his wit and resourcefulness to make the most with what he has.  Whereas Bond needs a tricked-out Aston Martin with rocket launchers and oil slick dispensers to make it through a car chase, Bourne only needs a beat-up old Cooper Mini.  Whereas Bond sticks out like a sore thumb wherever he goes, Bourne is like your real-life covert operative who does his best to look ordinary, blend in and not attract attention--  You'd never spot him walking through a crowd at a train station.    With the much more intelligent approach that gives up nothing on action, the Bourne trilogy is a refreshing take on the spy genre.    Like Moby says in the Extreme Ways theme for the Bourne trilogy, I would stand in line for this.    The blu-ray discs in this trilogy look absolutely fabulous on my setup (Sony Playstation 3 / Sony Bravia KDL-52W300 52-inch 1080p LCD HDTV).  I had rented the standard-definition DVDs from Netflix before I bought the Blu-Ray Bourne Trilogy, and there is absolutely NO comparison--  On a proper setup, blu-ray totally blows away the standard-def DVDs.  The difference in clarity is like night and day.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|Daria was THE animation of my late adolescence. Utterly smart and critical, it reflected pretty much how I felt about school and life in general. I am pretty sure that many people felt just like me, or simply enjoyed the series because of its smart quotes and lovely characters.    It's been many years since Daria was last aired on TV-as a Brazilian girl, I had to resort to MTV Latino to watch it, since it left our MTV very early. In this era, when we can find TV series of the sixties and seventies in nice boxed sets full of extras, I can't help but wonder: when will Daria fans have the pleasure of revisiting their beloved series on DVD???    I think it's about time MTV released a boxed set of one of its best creations ever-if even Beavis and Butthead got one...    I'll keep wishing, and hoping, and praying from Brazil-don't take too long, please!
B00006LST4|5.0|Ok, I don't know how good this sounds on a regular CD player, but Lady Jane has even the sliding sounds from chord changes, the plucks are like right in front of you. Under My Thumb has a clarity that makes it a totally new song. Out of Time has nuances no one would believe where there, the plucking of the acoustical guitar, the near rumble of the organ, the musicality of the marimbas. SACD on a quality system is STUNNING!
B002CMLIJ6|4.0|I think this is one of the best action films ever made.  Up there with Desperado.  Hugh Jackman is like a young Clint Eastwood.  Hybrid do some of the soundtrack.  The fight scenes are spectacular.  Don't be a hater.
B002Q9VPFM|5.0|I knew there was a reason I was waiting to buy the movie (aside from the fact that my wife doesn't want me to). I loved the film (she hated it) and have wanted to see the animated portions done on DVD at the time the film was in theaters. Now, I can get both on one disc (and watch it only when she's not around).<br />The fact that it's incorprated into the Director's Cut of the film is awesome. Can't wait for it to arrive!
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|Kayla used her powers to trick Logan into thinking she was dead.  Nuff said.  Except that this is one of the best action films ever made, up there with Desperado.  Pure escapist entertainment.  I love The Dark Knight, but that was a crime saga.  This is fantasy action.  And good fantasy action at that!
0312330537|5.0|When this book was first suggested to me I took note of the number of pages and dreaded it.  Who and what is Shantaram and why do I want to read about it?  Now I know.  This is a beautifully written story of love, betrayal, redemption and forgiveness of oneself.  I never labored through one second of reading this book.  In my opinion it was not long enough.  The varied stories and adventures that the narrator found himself in were entertaining to say the least.  I've never read a book like this before and doubt I will again anytime soon.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|THE MOVIE: 5/5  Terminator (or The Terminator, if you prefer) is and always will be an excellent movie. It expertly combines the two genres of science fiction and action. This movie was in my opinion James Cameron's break-through movie. After this, he made classic movies such as Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator 2, and of course, Titanic. Terminator truly is a modern classic. It's one of those relatively low budget movies that made it big. You don't need to take my word of it: other reviewers have given it 5 out of 5 stars.    THE DVD RELEASE VS THE BLU-RAY RELEASE  The first DVD release of Terminator was released in the late 1990s. Even though it was widescreen, unfortunately it was non-anamorphic, which can look terrible on a modern widescreen TV (as it only fills the center of the screen and leaves 4 black bars). The audio was the original mono soundtrack, with all its nostalgic 1980s sounding music and dialogue that sounds... somewhat low quality (which was commonplace for a sci-fi B-movie) It's definitely a nostalgic experience in sound.    Recently, I acquired the Blu-Ray of the Terminator. The picture quality was amazing compared to the first DVD. It was anamorphic widescreen and looks nice on a widescreen TV; however, it still isn't quite up to normal HD standards since it was shot on low-quality film. Still, it was a great video improvement. When I first watched it, the audio bugged me, and I didn't quite know why. It turned out that the Blu-Ray had used the 5.1 remix of the sound. It added new sound effects and made the dialogue sound normal. The audio sounded modern, completely different from the nostalgic B-movie sound. Now, call me funny, but I didn't like it. I missed the old, mono quality audio with the cheesy 1980s sound effects that had been replaced with regular, sounding audio and improved sound effects. In my opinion, it took away the warm B-movie feeling that the first DVD had. To top it all off, I found that the Blu-Ray didn't include the originalmono soundtrack.    The average viewer might like the Blu-Ray as it looks modern and sounds technically better. Others, like me, might love that warm, 1980s nostalgic experience of the DVD. The choice is yours.
B0029O08WA|5.0|Those who've read my prior reviews on this subject know that I despised the \\"Twilight\\" movie with a fiery passion, but was a fan of the soundtrack. Now that they've changed directors as well as composers for \\"New Moon,\\" I checked the \\"New Moon\\" soundtrack album out with some degree of eagerness. I bought it the day it came out...and I was utterly blown away.<br /><br />There is not one single dislikeable song on this entire album. \\"New Moon\\" is a completely new and original work of music; you cannot find the songs on this compilation anywhere else, with each song completely original and written specifically for the movie soundtrack. The artists range from the well-known to the obscure, from the folk-rock to the alternative, and the impressive range and skill of each musician is apparent from the get-go.<br /><br />The album kicks into a broodingly moody gear with Death Cab for Cutie's amazingly emotive \\"Meet Me on the Equinox,\\" which bleeds into the slightly punky punch of \\"Friends\\" by Band of Skulls. Thom Yorke, the lead singer of alternative rock legends Radiohead, contributes his own dark electronic track \\"Hearing Damage,\\" to be followed by the soft and introspective strains of \\"Possibility\\" by Lykke Li.<br /><br />The Killers of indie-rock fame contribute the original \\"A White Demon Love Song,\\" which perfectly captures the complicated relationships between Bella, Edward and Jacob throughout the story of \\"New Moon.\\" Anya Marina belts out the lovely ballad \\"Satellite Heart,\\" which is followed by a slinky new remix of Muse's new single \\"I Belong to You.\\" Bon Iver and the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club each come in with their own folk/aternative rock songs (\\"Roslyn\\" and \\"Done All Wrong\\", respectively), each track unique and lively in their own way -- indeed, the \\"New Moon\\" soundtrack could easily have fallen into the simple category of 'teen angst music' but the overall quality of the songs and the mixing are enough to completely sidestep that bullet.<br /><br />Hurricane Bells lively rock anthem \\"Monsters\\" again ramps the album up from the slowness while still managing to capture the overall, ethereally brooding sense that holds this unique album together.

0061914177|5.0|I had been looking forward to reading this book and preordered way back, needless to say I was stoked for October 13th to get here. My copy of Crush It was delivered Friday and got into it forthwith. It wasn't my intention to read it cover to cover in a 24 hour window, but I did. The narrative was straightforward and on target. It is a good read and hard to put down until you are finished.<br /><br />Gary makes it clear that that the only place success comes be work is in the dictionary. There are many books, 'business' opportunities and websites that make wild claims of becoming rich overnight with the Internet, unfortunately they are far from being truthful. If you think this book is about how to become rich on the Internet with no effort, this is not your book. The book explains the steps and tools to live a happy life, find happiness at work and become successful with hustle and hard work. Instead investing in those 'Get Rich Work at Home' programs buy this book and read it until you begin to see the light. Then Crush It to reach your professional dreams.<br /><br />I will end up ordering a couple more copies of this book as stocking stuffers for my two teenagers. I hope just a little of Gary's message sticks with them as they grow up and move into the workforce.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Short and sweet: If it didn't come with my Playstation 3 I never would have bought one because I imagined that just as with my remote controls and wifi devices--such as my iPod Touch--as well as my BlueTooth accessories that it would require a fairly clear path and good proximity between the controller and the console.  No such problem; I can sit on the floor propped up against a pillow with my legs and a coffee table with a computer on it between me console, and the controller still works; I can walk into the next room with it, and it still works.<br /><br />I will never use a wired controller again.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|I remember when the initial \\"...Millionaire\\" fever hit the U.S. back in 2000.  It struck a chord with us armchair dreamers that with a little incidental knowledge of the most arcane trivia we could be instantly rich.  Some nights without the pressure of the lights and the goading of Regis I knew all the answers and others I exhausted all my lifelines by the $1,000.00 question.  Director Danny Boyle and scenarist Simon Beaufoy ingeniously tap into this wish fullfillment and transplant it to India, a country that contains some of the most unimaginable poverty.  Reading some of the other reviews it appears that their film runs the gamut of love it or hate it.  Some feel that they are exploiting the suffering in India for commercial gain.  Others react to the plaudits the film received at the Oscars this year.  I don't have an answer to either criticism.  I can tell you I was engrossed throughout.  I think the critical and commercial success of the film is a response to the Cinderella aspects of the story which serve as an anecdote to our tough economic times.  History is the ultimate judge of a film's artistic worth.  Divorce yourself from the hype and appreciate the innate qualities of \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\".
0385504225|3.0|book was ok, too much detail on things we don't know, unlike Davinci code where we already have a good idea of DaVinci, the Last Supper, the Holy Grail, etc  Some of the plot twists you can see from at least 3 miles away  But, Brown still has talent, so the end result is fine

B0025KVLRO|5.0|What makes the Fab Four's debut album special is that 10 of the 14 tracks took less than a day to record. The other four: \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"P.S. I Love You\\", \\"Ask Me Why\\" and the title track had already been recorded several months before. Here, like their next album and \\"Beatles For Sale\\", eight tracks are their own compositions while the other six are cover versions. One track, \\"Do You Want To Know A Secret\\" was written by John and sung by George. Since this was recorded with just two track technology, many of the songs feature the vocals on one channel with most of the instrumentals on the other. However, the stereo mixes of \\"Love Me Do\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\" no longer exist so they are presented here in their mono versions. The stereo versions of those songs on the 1965 US album \\"The Early Beatles\\" were actually fake stereo. Finally, the original liner notes have been reprinted as well as recording and historical notes.    This is definitely an essential album. They weren't rock pioneers just yet but that would soon change. The music here is as simple as it gets but the best was yet to come.    TT 32:31

For about a year I tried to read it, but found I'd lose interest, leave it down, and end up coming back a few weeks later and starting all over again.  Then about two weeks ago, I picked it up and couldn't put it down. Read it in two days.  Must have been the right time because I found the story caught me.  The writing pulled me in and made me forget that I was reading.  That's always the best!<br /><br />As for the story, I was conflicted - I wanted to identify and support the tribal customs and lifestyle unconditionally. As a person born and raised in the U.S. I struggled with some of the tribe's cruel practices. Well, cruel by my sensibilities.  Consequently I found myself a little pleased that some of the characters chose Anglican church beliefs and practices.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />SR
0446402397|5.0|It takes me some time to start on a book set in old Russia - cold dark settings, permeated with fear, poverty, hunger - the very atmosphere is forbidding - you dont want to venture into it. I had bought the book and sat on it, finished other books until I was ready for this.     And the book is as good as people say it is. Great plotting. You are put in the juggler's seat. Just when you think you have all the balls in control, Tom Rob Smith hands you another one. When you think you have figured out the rest of the story, a new twist is added. The comparison to books of Martin Cruz Smith, such as  [[ASIN:0812977246 Gorky Park (Arkady Renko, No. 1)]], [[ASIN:0345498178 Polar Star: A Novel (Mortalis)]], [[ASIN:0679416889 Red Square]], are not unjustified. Right near the end of the book, the thought came to my mind that Renko should be some kind of a descendent of Leo.    And the book has a very satisfying ending. Read and enjoy this one.
1401323820|5.0|I like the show better than any new series in years, the mysteries are unusual,the script is witty and clever, and the book is the same. The book is great, I hope 'Mr. Castle' and his collaborators will write more.  Maybe they worked this up at one of their poker games?
B002HNA95E|4.0|I like this collection of singles from her vast career. Wow it has been that long.   I remember having a crush in 85 on her at 11. That was after seeing her crafty monroesque material girl video. U have came along way baby. And honestly she looks no worse for the wear. I give it a 4.25 because of the chronological confusion of all the tunes. Otherwise; the tunes and the coverage of her career is 5 stars all the way. I would have like it too have spanned from earliest to latest. Instead of the randomness of it. Oh well it is the material girl. She bucks trends and will probably continue too. Otherwise she probably would not have this career, and cd to begin with. I will shut up and celebrate now.
B000I157KO|1.0|While visually compelling, this film contains too little plot movement, too little dialogue, and too many unnecessary scenes to maintain a contemporary viewer's attention.  The story could easily be told in 20 minutes, yet the film goes on for two hours in what seems like an effort to run out the clock.  Its slick mid-1960s style looks intriguingly contemporary in some cases, but in other cases wears thin with free-love and experimental drug culture cliches.  Those seeking a background video that relives the glory of the 1960s may enjoy this film.  Those seeking a film with a real plot that engages the intellect would be wise to look elsewhere.
0439023491|5.0|This second installment in the Hunger Games is full of unexpected twists and turns.  It is just as good as the first, though it leaves you wondering why the series is a trilogy since there is a lot of room left for exposition. I can't wait for the third book!
0385504225|2.0|Finally!  I finished reading \\"The Lost Symbol\\".  Somewhere between page 200 and 250, Brown found his stride.  The first half of the book read like a thesis.  In the end, the McGuffin might well have come from a sampler found in a convent.  At least from that point on, he took you on a typical Dan Brown ride with a surprise ending, which I might have seen coming if I weren't so tired of the preaching.      Also, I feel it was misnamed.  The only things lost were lives, and they were not searching for a symbol.  It might have been better named The Hidden Word or The Forgotten Word.  There were times when I felt I was reading a rip-off of the National Treasure movies, and other times it pained me to have to sit through another boring lecture.      Guess I just didn't like it!  Maybe the Masons will like it.

B002SF9YUM|3.0|For most of his life, Salvador Dali denied that he had ever been lovers with the tragic poet Federico Garc&iacute;a Lorca -- until the end of his life.<br /><br />So, writer Philippa Goslett and director Paul Morrison explore what may have been in \\"Little Ashes,\\" in which two young men become close friends, more-than-friends, only to have their relationship splinter apart. It's a powerful little story with astonishing acting by Robert Pattinson and Javier Beltran, but it tends to meander and shake way too much.<br /><br />In the Madrid of 1922, a shy and awkward art student named Salvador Dali (Pattinson) is drawn into a circle of vibrant, iconoclastic young artists, including filmmaker Luis Bu&ntilde;uel (Matthew McNulty) and poet Federico Garc&iacute;a Lorca (Javier Beltran). Lorca in particular is intrigued by Dali, who is just discovering his unique melty surrealist style -- and it's not a platonic crush. And though initially he fights against the attraction, a trip to the seaside reveals Lorca's feelings to Dali.<br /><br />But as their attraction grows, Bu&ntilde;uel feels shut out and tries to pull Dali out of Lorca's orbit -- and after an unsuccessful attempt to consummate their affair, Dali vanishes to Paris without a word. A possibly insulting movie and many years widen the split between them, until Lorca meets Dali, now world famous and in love with the \\"witch\\" Gala (Arly Jover). Dali has changed, and so has Spain -- with terrible results.<br /><br />I know relatively little of either Dali or Lorca's lives, but it seems that \\"Little Ashes\\" is less about what happened than about what MIGHT have happened. Unfortunately it also falls prey to a common flaw in biographical movies, even if they're semi-fictionalized accounts -- it meanders randomly much of the time, and has awkward jumps between the different phases in the two men's lives. And what is up with Beltran suddenly reciting poetry in Spanish?<br /><br />But if it meanders, it's a picturesque meander -- sunny streets of Madrid, shadowy apartments, rocky beaches, weird surrealist visions of Paris, and fun nightclubs where bright young artists congregate. Paul Morrison has a straightforward directorial style with few ups or downs, but there are some beautiful moments sprinkled throughout it -- such as a balletic swim in a moonlit blue sea, or the bittersweet final scenes for Lorca (interspersed with Dali frantically smearing black paint all over).<br /><br />But this movie would be utterly forgettable if it weren't for the leads. Both are painfully magnificent, both in their chemistry and in their attempts to embody their characters. Beltran is a tragic figure who brims over with passion, sorrow and integrity, and somehow you know that things never end happily for this poor man. Marina Gatell has a small but well-acted role as a young woman passionately in love with Lorca, but obviously she can be nothing more than his friend (and once, a sexual proxy for Dali).<br /><br />And Pattinson exudes almost Johnny-Depplike skill in almost becoming Dali. This is no glamorous \\"Twilight\\" role -- at first Pattinson plays him as a twitchy, painfully awkward and shy young man, but as Dali grows in confidence he also becomes more insistently eccentric and flamboyant, to the point where Lorca no longer recognizes him as a person. Mad laughter, insane grief, and all the time we're never quite sure what he's truly thinking about anything -- except, at the end, about Lorca himself.<br /><br />\\"Little Ashes\\" is a flawed portrait covered in jewel-like paint -- the actors are truly astonishing in their skill, but the direction is a straightforward and spotty affair.

B0024FAR5M|5.0|Just like other dramas- good and tense as you get into the games and control issues going on under the surface. Where do you draw the line morally? Who and what will you identify with? The Dirty cop, straight cop, biker rule and law, philosophical reading and thought, a compassionate nurse, backstabbers and gossips, paranoid citizens, real freedom for all, serving the man, anti-government groups, drugs or no drugs, guns or no guns? What kind of relationships work and why in a closed social environment? The show covers a lot of issues, some better than others but leaves you in the drivers seat as far as choice and siding goes. Interesting mix of how multiple groups with differing structures all fit with one another in a land where people are free to choose. Compromise seems to be a constant theme undercurrent with tense situations occurring regularly.
B000FUF6QS|4.0|There are several ways to approach this creative, somewhat shocking film.  The photography and folk music in the beginning of the film, with the gorgeous Scottish countryside as the police investigator (Ed Woodward) is flying towards Summerisle and to an adventure that not only will shock and surprise him, but challenge him to the core of his being.  At first blush, looked like one of those trippy hippie films.  Not.<br /><br />But a musical?  There are several songs sung that reflect the sexual worship, Wiccan principles and the general ignorance of Christianity, something our police officer hero cannot abide, and at times loses it.  The landlord's daughter is almost a cliche.  You know the story of the salesman who sees the farmer's daughter, blah blah (you've heard the jokes).  Well, Brit Ekland (and her body double, but why??) sings a few songs out herself, although the editing left much to be desired, the lip synch didn't work for me.  The suppressed carnal desire of our \\"virgin man\\" was amazing and humorous in many ways.<br /><br />The Wicker Man is used in human sacrifices -- animals and even people are shoved into the giant Wicker statue and burned alive to appease the gods of the Sun and harvest.  No spoilers here, but our Scottish Christian is in for some dangerous times in his quest for the missing girl.  At first the natives deny Rowan Morrison's existence, then say she died and then finally she does appear -- in a most unusual and horrific way for our policeman.<br /><br />A hard film to categorize, which is what makes it fascinating: It has horror elements, insanity, religious connotations, the realization that not all of Britain fell to the Christian influences, that the old gods still influence, that it's a musical, that it has some gratiutous nudity without being tasteless, etc.<br /><br />Yes, it is dated in many ways, but I suggest the viewer see this with an open mind and enjoy the show.  You just might realize how reason and common sense don't always work when appeasing the gods.<br /><br />The film has quite a backstory too, which is why you should pick up the two disc version.  Also there's a British and a shorter American version.  Roger Corman helped distribute the film in the USA and Christopher Lee, who considers Wicker Man his best work, did the film for free!

B001FB4W0W|5.0|If you like Twilight and /or out of High School and are looking for the grow up version it's HBO's TRUEBLOOD. It's funny and has great writing but the SEX yes I said the S.E.X. and there is alot of it. Especially, from Jason Stackhouse the town's sexpot a.k.a cutie. This series is for adults only and not for gigglers or children. The Sookie Stackhouse books ar great too.
6305252572|4.0|It is a testament to Murphy's comic talent and Nolte's acting that they can take such an utterly banal cop story and make it so entertaining, even original at times.  OK, it doesn't keep its freshness the way Murphy's other great films do (i.e. BHC and TP), but it is still fun after all these years.  Some scenes, like the entry to the redneck bar, are truly classic.  Plus, Murphy still had genuine energy - a blooming talent - with this film, unlike the walkthrough-style roles he got in many many later forgettable mediocre comedies.<br /><br />The plot couldn't be more standard:  cop killer takes a maverick cop's gun and the chase is on (for honor justice revenge).  But then he gets Murphy out of jail to find a common enemy, and after wonderful sparring and anger-letting, they come to trust and like eachother.  It is very American, with perceptive issues such as Nolte's apology for \\"doin my job keepin you down\\", and the stars are totally convincing in their chemistry.  The bad guys are also very good, but they are pure stereotypical sociopaths.<br /><br />Recommended.  This one will survive in film history.

B000JK8OYU|3.0|I'm rediscovering the joy of actually purchasing and owning Full CDs. The Beatles Love is good but a bit too psychodelic with the sounds of birds chirping and other nature sounds in between tracks it sets a mood but I think it detracts a bit from the all the main songs.

I had my doubts when I read the synopsis but not to worry.  Twenties Girl is a hoot.  Even if you don't believe in ghosts, you can't help but believe in Sadie.  I marvel at Kinsella's imagination and how she can take such a story and make it feal so real.  Yes, it's a light read but there are some heavy truths in there too - and lessons to be learned about how society views old people.  Thanks Ms Kinsella, for a truly enjoyable read!

Great for age 0 - adulthood.Classic!
159448385X|5.0|It's another home run for this author. I actually liked it better than The Kite Runner, which I liked very much. This story exposes the extreme abuse, women of Afghanistan continue to face. Considering current events, although the book is fiction, it provides an unflinching look at a society of the very near past most of us cannot imagine; a society wracked by wars and stuck in another time.
1596680296|5.0|I have tried learning how to knit socks for awhile now and went through several books before purchasing this one. This is the best book for learning the sock knitting basics. Most sock book patterns are for lighter weight sock yarns, but this book allows you to learn how to knit socks with a regular, worsted or DK weight yarn too. And, that is much quicker and easier to knit your first few pairs of socks. The instructions and photos are clear and easy to understand. The instructions are written for sock knitting with double pointed needles (dpns), which can be a challenge for some knitters. But, once you get the hang of it, you can easily switch over to circular needles and use the Magic Loop method with these basic patterns.
0385504225|2.0|A very taut thriller - and as usual, each chapter ends with a dramatic flourish. A lot of interesting facts (ala The da Vinci code), so you learn a lot. But the story is outlandish - even for Dan Brown.  At the end, you wonder.....\\"Is this it???\\". Is it worth reading, I guess so....as a merely above average novel. But is it a great book ? Not at all. I got it as it came out, and was sorely disappointed. Dan Brown should just retire, and live off his earnings from the previous books he has written, and stop bothering us with such drivel.
0786868724|5.0|Very good. Initially thought it would be a rehash of \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,\\" but its not. Sure, it's an old man shares his wisdom with a younger man, but it's worth the read. Really makes you reflect.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly only lasted one season on TV and of course that's because it's such a well done, professional and innovative creation.  The computer generated images are gritty and realistic.  The character development is nuanced and compelling. (Now we'll never know the back story for Shepherd Book!!)  The story lines are engaging and the action serves the story rather than being the story.  Rent a copy at your local video store and test drive it.  I'll bet you buy the whole series and the film Serenity as well.  Enjoy something truly remarkable this weekend.
B002MW50KO|3.0|Almost 50 years into his musical career, and Bob Dylan still finds ways to enter unchartered territory (sort of) for him. Yes indeed, only 6 months after releasing the okay-but-not-super \\"Together Through Life\\" album now comes Bob Dylan's first Christmas album ever.<br /><br />\\"Christmas In the Heart\\" (15 tracks; 43 min.) is a collection of traditional Christmas songs, no new Dylan-penned material here. And that is not a slight, as Dylan has shown us that he loves bringing us the tradition of American music (Dylan-style Americana). But how do you bring Christmas songs into Americana without destroying the very psyche of these Christmas tunes? And that's where the problem arises. When listening to this, I wasn't sure whether to laugh or to cry, and instead simply scratched my head, incredulous at what I was hearing. Not helpful in this context is Bob's voice. While his low-fi singing doesn't deter (and in fact enhances) his last couple of studio albums, it simply doesn't work on here, as Bob's voice has the finesse of a bull in a china shop.<br /><br />If I had to point to some highlights on here, I'll go with \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\", \\"Hark The Herald Angels Sing\\", and best of all \\"O' Come All Ye Faithfull (Adeste Fideles)\\", with Bob singing the first few lines in the original Latin words. Worst of all on here for me is \\"\\"Must Be Santa\\", with is brought at breakneck speed, sort of like a freightrain barrelling down the tracks. Bottom line, I have no idea what Dylan really expected to bring with this album. Far superior to this album instead was Dylan's 2006 Christmas special on his XM radio show called \\"Dylan's Rockin' Xmas\\", in which Dylan brought a fantastic mix of Christmas trivia, stories, jokes and a whole bunch of Christmas-related r&b, ska, garage rock and tex-mex tunes.

0307588335|4.0|After reading about the Bear Stearns collapse, the Madoff fraud and now the Lehman collapse I've come to the conclusion that when it comes to money commen sense means doing the same thing everyone else is doing if they and you seem to be making money.    This books was an excellent overview of the events leading to the collapse. I recommend it highly. I have a much better understanding of how many different parties had to contribute to the housing asset bubble. Clearly the leadership of Lehman was a major contributor but so was everyone else from the over-reaching prospective homeowner to the mortgage sellers to the rating agencies to the asset packagers and to the investors seeking higher yields.    Come to think of it the asset bubble and crash and the Madoff Ponzi scheme and its collapse are more similar than different.

1905654294|2.0|The \\"it\\" novel of the summer. I had heard the rumors, accidentally came across the spoilers and I have to say that I agree with some of the complaints, though my critique maybe slightly different from the fan base.<br /><br />One of the negatives, which I just found odd, was the imprinting and how it was portrayed by Meyer. I know many people equated Jacob's imprinting on Renessmee to pedophilia. However, she foreshadowed this moment with an exchange Jacob has with another member of the pack early on in the book. I think what Meyer was attempting to do was create a sort of betrothal relationship, while integrating a romantic aspect to it, but she failed at making the distinction as to how any of the pack's relationship would evolve when imprinting on someone so young.<br /><br />Many of the characters lost their voice and seemed to be out of character. For me, I felt that Alice and Jasper were the characters that changed the most to fit the plot. I could see Rosalie defending Bella, only because Rosalie was always a selfish character. Had Bella died while giving birth, Rosalie would have ended up with a child and she would have still \\"won.\\"<br /><br />The battle towards the end was disappointing. You expect a major climax only to find out it's a dull battle of words and mental prowess.<br /><br />However, my main complaint against the series was Bella's validation as a person once she becomes a vampire. All of her existence prior to be becoming a vampire was insignificant as she lacked beauty, grace, and poise. However, now that Bella is \\"beautiful\\" she finally accepted herself. The main emphasis circled around the premise that now that she's pretty she can be and have everything at her disposal. It was just such a negative message to send to teens. (Though, I do think that the message was unintentional on Meyer's part.) Bella's life was not complete until she became \\"beautiful,\\" and in the process she becomes a different person. She's confident, perfect, basically a sketch character that is not fully fleshed out.<br /><br />The positives included Jacob's voice, when the story was told from his perspective. Until the very end (when Meyer transformed characters so that Bella and Edward could obtain a happy ending without any type of sacrifice), Jacob seemed to be the most stable and realistic character out of the entire Twilight cast.<br /><br />The characters are all happy in the end, though at what cost is the debatable point.<br /><br />Meyer's introduction of different vampire clans adds to the Twilight mythology and gives you hope there are other stories left to be told. I'm also under the impression that if there ever is a Breaking Dawn sequel, redemption could come in the form of Renesmee's rebellion. Being betrothed at a young age to a man, even if you developmentally age faster than other people is still an emotionally difficult concept to face. To know you have no choice in your romantic life is to almost be caged. That would be interesting to read.<br /><br />There are also Mormon allusions and symbolism weaved throughout this book. I'm of the opinion that this again was not done consciously by Meyer. Her personality, thoughts, and views just melded into the saga, displaying only one certain truth- we write what we know.<br /><br />Lastly, as an educator I can tell you that the best thing to come out of the Twilight saga is that it made girls interested in reading. Whether they are labeled as at-risk, low level readers, or your gifted and talented student, many of my female students have been drawn to the saga. We may not like the message that Meyer's presents, but when have books ever been safe and child friendly? Catcher in the Rye, anyone? (Note that I am however, not stating that the literary quality of the aforementioned book is equal to Breaking Dawn. Merely that popular books are not always a resource to discover and emulate morals and ethics. It's how the reader internalizes the story and whether the messageis discussed and analyzed thoroughly that matters in the end.)is discussed and analyzed thoroughly that matters in the end.)
B000FVQLRA|4.0|I agree with much of what was said by other reviewers. The movie was moving and quite good. I don't know how Brody won an Oscar, however. His performance was fine but far from extraordinary. His character is passive throughout most of the movie and registers few emotions - additionally, some of the most heartbreaking scenes show him from a distance or from the back so that we are unable to see his reactions. This may have been how the character survived but staring blankly or casting your eyes downward doesn't add up to a great performance. Again, it wasn't a poor performance. The character, the script, the direction did not give Brody a chance to register a range of emotions and, thus, earn an Oscar nomination.

Many seem put off at first glance (I know I was) and say one of or all of the following...<br /><br />1 - \\"the drawings look sketchy sometimes\\"<br />2 - \\"the anatomy seems exaggerated\\"<br />3 - \\"the look might \\"cramp\\" your style\\"<br />4 - \\"will copying the drawings really teach me anatomy?\\"<br /><br />Well, after having gone through the book once, reading how others go through it, working on form & exercises, and since I'm going through it again, I'll address these points.<br /><br />----------<br />1:  The \\"sketchiness\\" isn't there for the sake of being rough.  Those lines & curves are there to show the rhythm and flow of how this part leads into that part.  Keep in mind that not every drawing in the book is like this.<br /><br />2:  The anatomy isn't really exaggerated.  Consider that Bridgman's approach is on how muscles wedge into one another.  If you study form, can analyze it, and can combine verious forms with overlapping, and then look at the drawings, things will click.  The forms of various muscles stand out to show how the wedging works and sometimes the muscles happen to look flexed, that's all.<br /><br />3:  This was an odd comment I read at [...], and there's no way that going through this will \\"cramp your style.\\"  If this is the first anatomy book you're considering, and if you've never gone through a drawing book at all, then you don't have a style.  Don't worry about finding your style if you're just starting out - take the time to learn foundational principles & techniques, and make that your goal.<br /><br />4:  I imagine that alot of people would think of copying like this:  \\"Draw this line, put that curve right here, draw the line next to it, now move the pencil over here and draw this curve, repeat.\\"  Don't do that.  It wasn't until I had a better grasp on form & the \\"classical approach\\" when things began to click.  Once you learn thefundamentals of rhythm & gesture, observing angles, form, and \\"sculpting in the paper,\\" use that understanding to analyze not only subjects for life drawing, but also drawings.  As Glenn Vilppu says, \\"Don't copy the model, analyze it.\\"<br />---<br /><br />With that said, this book will show you anatomy as a set of forms, how they look from different views & actions, and, overall, how everything fits together.  It's the perfect book to pull out once you can draw those geometric skeletons.  Take your time and understand the text as Bridgman will explain what you're looking at.  Analyzing the drawings is one thing, but the text does mention a lot of aspects on how the anatomy works.<br /><br />There is one flaw in the book, and that is the layout.  I found myself having to flip between a few pages to look at the right drawing with the appropriately labeled parts so I could flip back to the text and better understand the stuff.  This got a little frustrating but if you're patient, you can pick up alot of things from this.  Like I said, take your time.

B00127RAJY|5.0|It was cheaper than I would've gotten it at target, even though its gotten cheaper-- but when I put in the time this DVD IS AMAZING....I did it for 2 weeks when I first got it and I lost 15lbs like instantly and I was only doing it once a day! Plus after I do the exercise- I have MORE ENERGY SOMEHOW! The best thing I've ever purchased! ALSO GREAT SHIPPING! It got here in like 2 days! The only kind of stinky thing about the DVD is when you first start you're not sure how long you go for because she'll stop and go to her asst. but eventually you get a hang of it.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is a great CPU cooler for the price. I can push my i5-750 to 4 GHz while keeping temperatures around 60C. I've chosen to throttle it back to 3.6 GHz for 24/7 usage so I can run at a more modest 1.3V and keep the fan at 80% where it's nearly inaudible. The sites that test lots of CPU coolers have shown this to have good cooling and noise performance.<br /><br />My Gigabyte motherboard doesn't offer much control over the fan speed so I'm using the free SpeedFan program to control the speed for different temperature levels. At idle the processor is 38C and the fan is set to a silent 70%. At full load the processor is 53C and the fan is barely audible at 80%. I like my computer to be quiet.<br /><br />The mounting bracket is a bit fussy but I had it mounted in 10 minutes or so. It has a backplate which is a good thing because it allows a tighter clamp and puts less stress on the motherboard. I'm cheap and I used the thermal paste that came with it.

B000002I55|4.0|To me, this album had a louder bark than bite. It must have scared jazz lovers in 1960 for Ornette to come a long and say \\"we are going to work without meters or chords,\\" and I have to admit, a lot of young lions made some powerful music with this concept.<br /><br />And this music is pretty good: it strolls along reletively melodically, thanks to great players like Dolphy, Cherry, Blackwell, and of course, the mastermind himself. Listening without the title in mind, this is pretty likeable.<br /><br />But this is not the untamed beast you would think by reading the press on Free Jazz. There is no madman like Cecil Taylor or Pharroh Sanders to rip heads off.  Dolphy and Cherry were fantastic musicans, but their instincts melodic, not atonal.<br /><br />John Coltrane's [[ASIN:B00004TA40 Ascension]] Now if you truely want your skull rattled,...........

B000002GJH|3.0|While Temple of the Dog doesn't really sound much different from the kind of alternative rock that Pearl Jam made popular with their landmark album Ten, this album is at least a decent attempt at giving the listener a taste of something other than Pearl Jam.     Pearl Jam would turn into better songwriters with their second album, but if we must compare Pearl Jam's debut to this Temple of the Dog album, I'd give this album the edge over Ten.     Ten just never seemed like a very good album to me. The songwriting just wasn't GREAT yet, despite the commercial appeal and the overall success of the album.     The guitar playing on this Temple of the Dog album is a bit better in comparison. There's some fairly lengthy guitar solos, and memorable ones too that recall the days of Tommy Bolin and many other 70's guitar greats.  The album actually rocks quite hard, and I don't sense the band is going for a commercial sound NEARLY as much I sense the same thing from any given Pearl Jam album.     The reason I'm not giving this album a higher rating is because, despite the songwriting being an improvement over early Pearl Jam, I'm just not into alternative rock or early grunge very much mostly because the vocals sound a bit forceful and obnoxious to me, and not very melodic. But that's just the way the genre is I guess, and not the fault of the singers potential.     I'd say this band is probably just as good as Soundgarden though.
0545123267|5.0|After reading the Twilight series, I had a difficult time discovering a novel that could captivate my attention. Shiver is a beautifully written coming of age tale of love (and werewolves, of course). I found Grace to be a fascinating, witty, and courageous heroine. This book had me laughing out loud, crying, and, of course, shivering. Highly recommended novel for mature young adults.

0064410935|5.0|E.B. White's classic novel was always one of my favorite books growing up.  And today it remains one of my all-time favorites!  I still can identify with Wilbur the charismatic pig, since I have been privileged enough to have many spiders as roommates.  This book is probably especially meaningful to me, as an animal communicator, because it involves so many different animals trying to live and survive together on the farm.    This is a wonderful book for young children, growing up, because it teaches them about their own self-worth in a busy world.  It also teaches us about the value of lives, how short they can be, and how much we can make of them.  Charlotte saves Wilbur by spinning words in her webs, using her short life to benefit his life and the lives of others.    Harmony,  Janet Roper
0312944926|4.0|There is something for everyone in this book. A page turner, read it in two sittings (I was on vacation). The technical descriptions are understandable and not overwhelming. Plenty of twists and turns.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|First of all, the VERY first thing I need to say is this-     Do NOT let the previews you've seen of Slumdog Millionaire fool you- this movie is much more than just a contestant appearing on a gameshow, winning money, and winning back his girlfriend for a happy conclusion.     Slumdog Millionaire is about MUCH more than that.     It's about the contestant winning money on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire (the Mumbai version, which is the name of a city in India), but the storyline is more about how the contestant even GOT the opportunity to appear on the show, and the life long build-up of the contestants tragic and horrible past.     It's a story that focuses on the contestants past, and the way he had to grow up in a poor, dangerous and just unsettling and unhealthy environment. He had to go through life basically looking out for himself, along with his small group of friends, just to survive.     Throughout the movie, every time the contestant is about to answer a question on the gameshow, the story switches to something that happened in his past that enabled him to remember the answer to the questions he was being asked. Eventually there comes a point when the contestant answers so many questions correctly that he gets accused of cheating which leads to a little bit of violence.    It might sound a bit tacky, and maybe to some it is tacky, but to me, it was a story told exceptionally well, and I highly recommend this movie. What will happen to the contestants group of friends as they grow up and grow apart? Well, you have to see it to believe it. I was totally attached to Slumdog Millionaire the entire time and I can NOW see why the film received so many awards. The presentation is just amazing.     Great story, lots of tragic events and suspense, and just fantastic acting all around. Yup, it's one of those rare movies that does everything right.
1401203078|2.0|I appreciate the out there style of The League, but this is a bit rediculouse. This issue not only feels like you've never read the series before but it makes you wonder if you really want the next installment. Not only that but where the previous two iterations sort of hinted at sexual endevours and this issue does a olympic style dive into sexual literature. I appreciate how Moore's books give you a break from the illustrations to fill in the story, but this one is half novel and that is not what I think most people are looking for in the series. It'd take a very good turn in the next issue to make me want to invest in the series again. So sad. I really liked the direction this series was taking.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|Great CD, and good return to form.  I will forever consider Kill'Em All the eternal master piece of Tallica mastery, since it is the greatest thrash metal of all time, but this is good to hear the boys get back to in your face metal and good songs.  Mr. T brings the speed back on bass, no disrespect to J.News, but we all know he was mellow compared to the eternal Cliff.  By the way, to all the homo's with the comparisons to Master, eat a dick, if you had any ballz you would know Kill'Em is the best metallica and that there is no going back to the past, take DM for what it is, good new metal, period.

Blair Daly even co wrote a song on here and all the other songs are fantastic but one song sticks out more than the rest and that is \\" Floyd \\" with backing vocals by Rob Zombie . This is one of those songs that can be made in to a movie and dont forget \\" This aint AMERICA \\" both of these songs are songs u can keep starting over but dont forget that this WHOLE CD is worth checking out !! GOD BLESS SKYNYRD AND GOD BLESS AMERICA !!
B001G7SS96|3.0|As several reviewers have already pointed out, the novel is better. And after this third cinematic try, I hoped that it would've mirrored the book more closely than the first two. Such wasn't the case. It's a pity, for if the movie ended on the twist that the book did, it would've made it more powerful. Maybe next time.  As even more reviewers have stated, the first half of the movie builds great promise for a well-done film. Will Smith literally carries the movie with him, and brings the audience along quite nicely. It is an imperial acting job and impressive to watch. The second half, however, devolves into a second-rate zombie movie which taints the overall spectacle. Had the director and writers stuck more closely to the novel's twist, and had they used real actors for the infected population instead of computer animation, we would've had a first-rate, five-star movie to talk about. Like I said, maybe next time.

B002GMNLLA|5.0|Being an Insomnium fan by far the other albums they've made were not as close as to this one, simply because i enjoyed their clean vocals and epic sounds that lack in the other songs (except mortal share, the elder). Overall this is by far the best album i heard and hopes this band rises to its peak because it deserves to be heard more and stand out in the melodic death metal scene. I will never forget this band and remembered the first time i heard this band play i was astonished and loved them, never heard anything like them ever and nothing will come even close.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|All though,I'm sure the play was very good for those of us that could not go to This was wonderful, it is not a live show but I thing that The way it was done gave us a better look,you are able to se the dancers and actors much better,And the dancers were outstanding and of course the high light of the show was Elain paige even though she was not on camera very much.It was very good movie. I recommemd it highly.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|If you listen to all the \\"experts\\", they will dissect and tear these remasters down to nothing.  Clearly missing what this is all about, I feel sorry for them in that they can't just sit back and enjoy the amazing new packaging, and the increased clarity of the sound.  Could it have been differently sonically, I suppose, but do we all such a subjective ear that it will make that huge of a difference?  I doubt it.  This is the most wonderful way to introduce the finest music ever lain down on tape to new listeners, or to reiterate the collection to us that already possess multiple versions of each album.  Looking forward to the mono version arriving, any day now.
0545123267|5.0|My Thoughts: I'll start off by saying I've heard this book compared to Twilight multiple times. Some people hate it, some people love it. I am a huge Twilight fan. Yes, I'm one of \\"those.\\"<br /><br />Well, what can I possibly say to sum up this book? I'm in love with it. Like seriously all the way in love with it. I finished it in a day. Once I started it, I could not stop. Eating became a chore because I just needed to have the book in my hand or else I would go insane. I'm still left breathless. The whole story, the words, the plot, the characters are beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Its just too bad I had the ARC, because now I have to buy the finished copy! Its definitely one I need to have sitting on my bookshelf. It must be bought! haha! I loved Grace, but most of all I loved Sam. I loved him as a wolf, I loved him as a human. I loved the way the chapters unfolded. Each chapter is told from each characters point of view, one will be Grace's and the next Sam's. But it does not jump around and it goes along as the story goes. We learn how they felt each other through each other. I usually do not like books that switch points of view, but this just made it more special. I really wanted to know what Sam was thinking and how he \\"felt.\\" Amazing! It is a good thing its called Shiver, because it will literally make you Shiver. The whole book, I wanted to go out and play in those woods!! Now I am left wanting to read Linger, which isn't due out for a while. Darn me. LOL! I won't go into too many other details because you need to just read this book!!! I don't give too many books this kind of review, because most books I read once than I move onto something else. Its just my way. But this one,,,, lets just put it this way, if you haven't read it yet, go to amazon and buy it right now! If you like beautiful romance stories, this is for you!<br /><br />Overall: GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT, Do you get my point yet?<br /><br />Cover: Its pretty, a little plain, but the rest of the book makes up for it!!!

0061766089|4.0|My memory is that the first popular books on design -e.g. the history of the paperclip - came out in the mid 80s.  Twenty years later, it's still a steady stream which attests to the interest in the field.  Unlike many of the other books on \\"design\\", this one focuses on the functions of the organization as a whole - making it sort of a hybrid between a \\"design\\" and creativity book, and a 'corporate innovation' book.

B002DZX96C|1.0|I can largely bear with Brendel's recorded outings from the 1960s and 1970s--occasionally even enjoy some of them.  However, more often than not, he strikes me as the probably most overvalued pianist of the last century, at least in Beethoven. His followers claim his pianism to be 'intellectual', 'witty' and 'magisterial'. To me, it is ponderous, pretentious, patronising and maddeningly tedious. Brendel's Digital Beethoven Sonatas cycle provides ample evidence to support it, which I believe can be neatly summarised as follows: fast movements sound draggy and slow movements breathless; articulation and phrasing sound slack; dynamics and characterisation lack any degree of imagination; and there is a total absence of forward momentum and excitement in the ubiquitous, laboured self-consciousness.<br /><br />Before continuing, let's get the facts straight (as opposed to the preceding entry): Brendel recorded three complete cycles--the first for Vox in the 1960s (as part of the first-ever complete survey of Beethoven's piano works), and the second and third for Philips in the 1970s and 1990s, respectively. Philips was incorporated into Decca 10 years ago; even though the original label has commonly been kept for Philips reissues, this 10-disc box-set has now for some reason been reissued under the Decca label, at a supposed bargain price.<br /><br />I clearly made one of my worst investment decisions some 13 years ago when acquiring this box-set at full price (around $120 at the time). All the same, even at less than half the price, I would not consider it even remotely as a bargain. As a matter of fact, this grim cycle kept me away from some of the lesser-known Sonatas for years, until I got my hands on Goode's lilting Nonesuch cycle--indeed a bargain regardless of price, and the perfect antidote to the gloomy Brendel.<br /><br />So, what is the point of this pessimistic review? Well, simply to let readers know that their money is better spent on virtually any other complete Beethoven Sonatas box-set--for instance, Kempff, Gulda, Kovacevich, Roberts and Barenboim are all available at even less. Even Brendel's analogue 1970s cycle for Philips at nearly thrice the price is more recommendable than this dreadful reissue.<br /><br />Lastly: not only is the digital recording generally too close and airless, it also captures far too much of Brendel's uncommonly heavy and audible breathing--which this reviewer initially mistook for a printing defect. It probably more or less goes without saying that the British press almost unanimously lauded this cycle as one of the greatest of all time. Why? Let's just leave it at that.<br /><br />REFERENCE: Goode ([[ASIN:B000005J2D Beethoven: The Complete Sonatas [Box Set]]]), Ohlsson (not yet complete)<br /><br />APPENDIX: Of course, I knew in advance that the superficial five-star faction of the Amazon audience would not appreciate my sincerely altruistic objective of this review--that is, helping other listeners avoid wasting their hard-earned money. All the same, even though this set is not worth more than a single star, I've now added a plus as this new budget-price incarnation at least wastes less of genuinely credulous listeners' money.plete Beethoven Sonatas box-set--for instance, Kempff, Gulda, Kovacevich, Roberts and Barenboim are all available at even less.

B001ILHY2C|4.0|4 of 5 stars for the extreme road-rage movie: Death Race. Set in the future where prisons are run by corporations \\"for profit\\" they stream on internet a new sport called The Death Race. Prisoners are forced to drive race cars complete with armor and weapons where the goal is to not just win, but, be the only survivor of the race. Our hero (played by Jason Statham, one of my favorites) gets rail-roaded into prison and forced into driving.<br /><br />This is a sci-fi movie which is richly and expansively photographed. Yeah, special effects, but, mostly great sets and live action. Really a nice blend of reality and effects. Great action, lots of bullets, lots of smash-ups. This is a recommended movie.

B00006AUIG|5.0|Nowadays, there are so few real, quality horror films that get enough recognition. Sure, there are a good deal of great films that are under the radar of the mainstream, but when a really good horror movie of recent times comes around, it's definitely worth notice. And \\"Session 9\\" is worth the notice!    Taking influence largely from \\"The Shining\\", in my opinion, \\"Session 9\\" is a psychological horror film with a great deal of intense and mysterious atmosphere that's laid on thicker than Thanksgiving gravy. The powerful sense of dread and chilling mystery presented throughout the film is simply enticing and definitely makes you want to see the whole thing. In addition to the asylum, which is one of the big reasons why the film is so great, this film delves pretty deeply into psychology with the recorded sessions of the asylum patients. This part definitely sucked me in, because psychology has always been a topic of great curiosity to me.    Running at 1 hour and 40 minutes, this movie is longer than most slashers and about as long as more psychological films. However, the length of the film doesn't drag it down or make it boring, because the movie is able to fill all 100 minutes with interest and mystery. Honestly, the asylum is one of the greatest locations I've seen in a while in horror films. The written part is also done excellently, showcasing a strong plot and chilling series of events. In addition, the acting is great, with the actors showing how truly talented they are, regardless of how much mainstream attention they get.    Overall, with a dark and bleak feeling throughout, and a bitter ending, this is not a fun film by any means. However, \\"Session 9\\" is a film that will suck you into its mystery, depth, darkness and bleak appeal. If the feeling of this movie is too strong, I recommend washing it off with another great, modern-day horror film such as \\"Planet Terror\\" (even if it isn't 100% horror, it's great nonetheless). But as for this film, well, \\"Session9\\" is the psychological horror film to beat of modern movies! Highly recommended for those interested in such a film, and to close, just because I love the quote so much, I need to say it again. \\"Where do you live?\\" --- \\"I live...in the weak...and the wounded!\\". Thanks for the time, and peace.
0399230033|5.0|This is one of my four year olds favorite books. It doesn't have many words but the pictures do a lot of the talking. Plus it lets my son create his own story. He likes to point the expressions of the animals and the mouse dragging the banana. We always laugh at their faces and add in our own sound effects. This is also a great bed time book because it is so short and sweet! We usually read this twice, first with me reading it then with him telling me the story as he turns the pages. I highly recommend this book for parents who love to share the gift of reading and imagination with their children. Don't go expecting a super life changing story here. It's just a simple story with funny illustrations that most any child would love.
0739313126|5.0|5 of 5 stars for the book The Da Vinci Code. This is the first of (currently) three books in the Robert Langdon series. Langdon is a specialist in symbology (the history and meaning of various symbols from different cultures. Langdon is called to help the police in Paris with a murder. This starts a long chain of events in which various religious factions are chasing \\"the Holy Grail\\". Langdon gains the help of a police officer who is the daughter of the murder victim. As the complex puzzle grows, Langdon reaches out for help from an old friend. This chain of events has several surprises as we learn some people are not who they appear to be (e.g. the lead police detective is actually a member of one of the religious factions and is trying to frame Langdon for the murder). Even Langdon's old friend is not exactly who he appears, nor is his butler! Complex, interesting, exciting and compelling is this story. Langdon is no James Bond, but, he does well during action moments. Langdon somewhat reminds me of Indiana Jones; college profession who has interesting adventures with historical artifacts and legends.<br /><br />Much has been written and debated over the historical validity of Brown's story and assertions. If you set aside those various debates and opinions and just take it as a story of fiction, it is a very good book! I highly recommend this book! (and I highly recommend the movie!)
B0002KVULG|5.0|I really like this 1979 Dracula movie.  Personally, I like it better than Bram Stoker's Dracula from 1992.  I personally think Frank Langella is a great Dracula who portrays the character the way he should be portrayed - evil, mysterious, dark, romantic, stylish.  He possesses supernatural powers, almost as if he uses The Force, like in Star Wars.  The atmosphere in this movie can't be beat.  For one thing, Dracula's castle is one wicked place.  There is a gothic quality to this movie that is unmatched.  The dark atmosphere is outstanding.  The props are outstanding.  The costumes are outstanding.  The special effects are outstanding.  The script is outstanding.  The musical score by John Williams is outstanding.  The acting is outstanding.  Sure, this movie doesn't follow the novel exactly, but I say...who cares.  Take the movie for what it is - a Dracula movie with a great gothic atmosphere.  It takes place in England in the early twentieth century.<br /><br />This movie also stars Donald Pleasence (Halloween I, II, IV, V, VI, The Prince Of Darkness), the red hot Kate Nelligan as Dracula's bride Lucy, and Laurence Olivier as Van Helsing, the vampire hunter who is out to put an end to Dracula's dark deeds.  Everybody gives good performances.  Donald Pleasance provides some comic relief because he is always doing a certain thing in every scene he's in.  Watch to find out what it is.  The movie is scary throughout.  The ending of the movie is cool and will leave you guessing.<br /><br />A lot of people complain about the color being deliberately dulled in this DVD transfer.  Personally, it doesn't bother me.  It's still in color, no doubt about it.  I understand why some people are upset about it, because when the movie came out in '79 this movie was praised for its brilliant colors.  Director John Badham originally wanted to film this movie in black and white, but then chose color instead.  Some 25 years later when it was time to put the movie on DVD, he decided he wanted to tinker with the color to make it duller so it would flirt with coming close to being a black and white movie.  But even with the duller color, it's still a color movie.<br /><br />If you want to watch a really good undated Dracula movie that has held up extremely well over the years, then I highly recommend Dracula 1979.with the color to make it duller so it would flirt with coming close to being a black and white movie.  But even with the duller color, it's still a color movie.

B002S0OBFK|5.0|That's a lesson the male character in this disturbing film learned just a little too late.    It's exceedingly rare that I see a horror movie that isn't god-awful bad, and less often still that I see one that I can say is excellent.  Paranormal Activity is one of those precious gems.  Virtually everything was done right:    1.) Gradually building sense of tension - the film starts out on a bright, sunny day, by introducing us to a pair of twenty-somethings that appears to have it all: money, good looks, a great house, expensive toys and even true love.  This cheery beginning gives way over the course of the story to uneasiness, foreboding, mounting fear and at last outright terror.  This is accomplished at a steady pace that is neither rushed nor deadly dull.    2.) Good character-building - before long you start to feel like you know this couple.  Not only that, but you can't help but like them, despite the boyfriend's general boneheadedness and his lady friend's mood swings.  You go inside their home, you see their personal belongings, and you experience a small taste of their daily routine.  Hence you are well primed to share in the overwhelming sense of horror that fills the climactic moments.    3.) Last but by no means least, \\"Paranormal Activity\\" makes splendid use of the \\"less is more\\" principle.  The demon that stalks this unfortunate pair is never actually seen.  It makes its presence known by crashing sounds in the middle of the night, by lights and appliances that switch themselves on and by disembodied shadows that glide along the walls of barely lit rooms.  What little use of special effects there is occurs at the exact moment it should, when the Thing from Hell makes its ultimate move.    This isn't a movie for those who can't imagine a horror film without chainsaws, buckets of gore and bad jokes.  The fear you'll experience is like that you felt as a kid, watching a late night monster flick or listening to a ghost story around a campfire.  It's the proverbial chill that creeps up your spine inch by inch, until that dark moment arrives when you turn around, and see that the monster you've created in your imagination is real, and is standing right behind you, its red eyes glowing in the dark.    Don't miss the chance to see this one in the theater.  Don't play with Oujia boards.  And if you're a guy who meets a cute brunette named Katie one night, you might want to think twice about asking her out.  She's got issues you don't want to deal with, trust me.

B001GSV3EC|5.0|Jeff beck is a musician...who happens to play guitar. He can make lyrical poetic passages that mean something...and also blistering fusion runs into the twilight zone. He is one of the very few who can use the whammy bar in a musical way. I'v always enjoyed his playing best when he has a musically compatible keyboardest, such as Jan Hammer or Max Middleton. His keyboardest on this CD, Jason Rebello is now on this shortlist. This CD is highly recommend.

6305754969|5.0|every once and a while me and my father will buy a classic western no matter how cheesy or weird it may look, today he came home with this movie El Dorado, at first i was expecting not too much due to how many westerns that were made, though i should have thought better whenever i saw that it starred two great film actors John Wayne and Robert Mitchum.<br /><br />i may be young but i know good actors when i watch them on screen these two played beautifully off each other and so did another great actor James Caan<br /><br />all the characters were played to perfection, even though anyone can play an alcoholic sheriff with a broken-heart Mitchum really made the role shine, of course John Wayne did wonderful as The Hired Gun, but my favorite role was that of Mississipi played by James Caan, in my opinion he did an astonishing job in this role and the scenes with him and Wayne were glorious.<br /><br />in a lil side note the action scenes were done really well and there was also a slight editing issue during one of the scenes I'm sure you'll notice(but you must take into consideration the time when the movie was made)<br /><br />thank you and you really must see this movie that could never be done today due to the fight between stars in leading roles.

B0020MKTOS|5.0|Clint has never been mellow and he exceeded my expectations on this one.  The evolution of bitter and bigot to the finale is believable and with a startling conclusion.  One has to imagine what the Hmong are saying but body language says it clearly enough.  Clint's relationship with his own family was the balance the film needed, especially the brat grandaughter.  Few if any of Clint's films are rated this high at my house, and I have seen them all over and over.

B0029O08WA|5.0|This soundtrack has some incredible songs on it! I had heard the new tracks by The Killers and Thom Yorke, and I loved both of those, so I bought the soundtrack on that basis alone. I was pleasantly surprised by how good all the other songs were as well. Each song carries a certain essence and captures a particular feeling    I would definitely recommend this soundtrack. Highlights for me include \\"A White Demon Love Song\\" by The Killers, \\"Friends\\" by Band of Skulls, and \\"Hearing Damage\\" by Thom Yorke
0131988425|3.0|I am writing this as an electrical engineering student at Brown University, RI, USA.<br /><br />My general comment for all textbooks by A. Oppenheim is:<br />His books are exhaustive, professional and can be great references for your entire engineering career. However, from the pure student perspective, Oppenheim's books are hard and confusing to read (in addition, the huge knowledge provided cannot be assimilated) for the purposes of a course.<br /><br />The books covers several aspects of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and it's considered the best of this kind. It contains what an signal processing electrical engineer needs for his job. There are many strict mathematical proofs which explain how the DSP concepts have been developed, but they make it really confusing to the student to understand the practical meaning of signal processing.<br />The book has many many problems ranging from basic to extremely complex ones! These are generally a pain and their solutions require much thinking and deep understanding of the concepts (simple studying of the book's theory material doesn't help). In the newest editions, I think that there is a Matlab guide accompanying the book or a similar online tool, which provides ideas for Matlab probles/projects.<br /><br />As I said before, the book can be a great reference for a professional career and I definitely recommend it as such. It has been the 1st and most complete book of its kind describing the (fairly recent/new) concepts of DSP. However, be advised that it's hard to read for a semester-long class. Definitely, good notes provided by the Professor and/or help and support from TAs or Professor are imperative to enhance understanding in a DSP course and improve performance in exams etc. Real-life projects and applications are even better to work on in order to realize the full realm and potential of DSP.
B000002HEP|5.0|The third album from Kyuss -- released in 1994 -- is in many eyes a masterpiece. The band's confidence in the album and their opposition to mainstream ideas of what an album should be is reflected in how they tracked the disc. The album's 11 songs are bunched up on four tracks so that listeners are forced to listen through an entire block of music as opposed to skipping from track to track. Most refer to the album as Welcome to Sky Valley thanks to the cover art's road sign with the aforementioned phrase, but the band has insisted the album was actually self-titled.<br /><br />Just the same as the album title, what to call the band's genre is in question. To their fans in the early `90s, they were Stoner Rock. To themselves and their peers, they were Desert Rock. A decent explanation of the Kyuss sound might be fuzzed-out psychedelic rock. They have the song exploration tendencies of a band like Pink Floyd, but they also have the bass-heavy riff rock of bands such as Black Sabbath. This description, however, still does not do the band justice. They own a sound that should just be heard instead of talked about.<br /><br />Kyuss has used Sky Valley to paint aural landscapes that, for me, somehow bring to mind the California desert from whence they came, but don't think the musical ideas they've brought to the table for our ears to feast upon are as barren as the land they call home. Seemingly, their sparse surroundings have allowed their minds to wander into exciting new territory. From the contemplative meanderings of \\"Space Cadet\\" to the crushing grooves of \\"Gardenia,\\" Kyuss reveals all sides of their musical psyche, and just as diverse as the sounds of the songs is the subject matter found within the lyrics. In the tunes I just mentioned, the first is about waiting for psychotropic drugs to kick in, while the other is about the spirit of desert rock and the generator parties Kyuss was known to have had in the middle of the desert. The powerful, pounding percussion in the intro of \\"Demon Cleaner\\" gives way to a song about brushing teeth (seriously).<br /><br />In closing, I have to say this is honestly one of my favorite albums. People new to Kyuss may have a hard time getting acquainted to their unique sound, but if a fan of heavy rock is looking to expand their horizons, this one is definitely worth checking out.\\"Demon Cleaner\\" gives way to a song about brushing teeth (seriously).

0385504225|4.0|I really do enjoy the way Dan Brown can be so creative in using our past as a way to explore new possibilities into what could be. How many times can the same thing happen to one man, and the same way every time? I feel the books are all written the same way, and that there needs to be some change to grasp my attention. The book is good, and I would recommend it to anyone.
0786868724|1.0|Spot on review by Tim before me. Have A Little Faith is more vapid, meaningless, feel-good spiritual gobblygook from the master of huckster religious tripe. Most of Albom's work is in a similar vein. All the guilt-free comfort of Oprah-ized religion without those troubling responsibilities. If faith in just anything, as long as it is sincere, could provide salvation, than why, oh why, did the Lord Jesus Christ even bother to die for our sins? If what this hack sportswriter posits as truth were indeed true it would naturally follow that Christ was either a megalomaniac or a severely delusional man worthy of nothing more than pity. Certainly not the Son of God. As a Christian, Albom's 'all roads lead to the heaven' approach is offensive. For faith in nothing is ultimately worth nothing. It has no intrinsic value in itself. Misplaced faith is dangerous. If you have 'faith' in a leaky boat and attempt to cross the Atlantic in it you will drown. Please people, think about the fallacy of the author's logic. I know that it soothes your consciences, but it is of no real value. Pick up your Bible with an open heart and mind and read the Word of God for yourself. You will see that Christ is worthy of our complete trust in His atoning death for our sins. Pray to God for the scales to be lifted from your eyes as you read His Word. I do have a couple of suggestions that may help. Download some FREE recordings of Bible studies from Thru The Bible Radio website, or pick up a comprehensive Bible concordance and study scripture as though your soul depended on it. Steer clear of Have A Little Faith though. This kind of book only enriches its author.

B002IVLH6A|1.0|I've read the reviews where people say \\"best PJ album of the 2000's\\" and so on....  PLEASE!  This is as bad as their last one (self titled / 'avocado').  There isn't a single song on here that's memorable... and certainly not one I'd say was \\"radio worthy\\".      With O'Brien coming back to produce this one... I'd had hoped they'd get back (at least somewhat) to their 'roots' & we'd get at least a FEW songs that were \\"instant Pearl Jam classics\\"... but there's nothing that even comes close!      The 1st 4 songs weren't even good enough to be called Terrible... (& yet that's what they started the album with??); and while (most of) the rest at least resembled the Pearl Jam MOST of us love... again... nothing here worth listening to again.      But how anyone can say ANY of the songs on here are better than say, those on Riot Act or Binaural, let alone say the whole album is better... is so far beyond rhyme & reason, it's unfathomable... unless they're only saying such things, to make sure you buy the album & help line the pockets of their \\"Idols\\".  (because that's exactly what happened to me!)      This will definitely be the Last P.J. album I buy.  There isn't a single song from the Self-Title/Avocado album on my iPod... and I doubt I'll end up keeping any of these as well.  Seriously, why keep a few Generic & Unmemorable songs... when there are so many Good ones from other albums to choose from & listen to?     Vedder hasn't truly Sung... well, sung in the manner that made us all fall in love with his voice anyway... for what, 5 or 6 albums now!?  What's up with that!  He HAD a unique & soulful voice... but we've only heard Samplings of it ever since Vitalogy.  Call me crazy; but I prefer the Non-Watered-Down, Non-Generic voice, that made Pearl Jam, well, Pearl Jam... and the only albums you really get that, is Ten & Vs (and a couple on Vitalogy).  I mean, did he lose the ability to sing that way... or did some idiot convince him, \\"in order to stay relevant & not getstuck in the 'grunge' genre\\", he had to tone it all down & sound like a cheap imitation of himself, or what??
0307346617|4.0|If you're in the mood for a good zombie book that pretty much hands you everything upfront, then this is the book for you. The book consists of interviews, which really end up being short stories, so you never get bored. I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers in that the voices of these seemingly very different characters sound very similar. The occasional stereotype is thrown in, in an attempt to differentiate between characters, but it's done so bluntly that it's excruciatingly obvious. I gave it four stars, because anything having to do with the actual zombies was awesome and the book itself was very entertaining. It even gave me nightmares, which is always a plus when reading zombie fiction!

B000I0QM0E|4.0|This a great time of year to bring out this DVD! I only have standard dvd and not Blu-Ray yet but still looks good. The storytelling is great fun and the 'Dark\\" spooky skies and atmosphere Burton creates is not to be missed. Danny Elfman's music is a real treat and will scare you to death! The movie runs a little out of steam a little toward the end! That's why not five stars--but still highy recommended!
B000Y7U98C|1.0|Look, I am a sci-fi guy, from Star Trek, BSG, to Sagan, etc.  I was an easy target.  But this \\"movie\\" was such a disaster in my opinion.  Who cares about the legitimacy of the science?  It has no nucleus, no progressive development, no plot.  It is a meandering series of short vignette's about smoke-screen characters who don't matter.  It goes from boring, to senseless horror film, to total golden bright chaos.  I can't believe how stupid I thought this movie was.  And these good reviews?  This movie is truly lost on me...and vice versa.

020161622X|4.0|I started reading the book a few days ago and enjoy it every minute.  I haven't finished reading it, but feel confident to review it.  I recommend this book to any person who wants to be a better programmer.  When I first tried to describe what this book is about, I made an analogy to the kinds of books the gives you 'good advices for better life'.  One of the rules to have better life is, if you read these kinds of books, at least try to follow what they suggest.  Well, since starting reading Pragmatic, I keep trying to follow the advices I've read.  I was happy to see that some of the advices, I kept even before.  I feel that in the subjects that I read and started following, I became better.  Following the advices made me better in the small and nuance steps. Al and all, a much better developer.    Some of the advices are not applicable for my field and what I do, so I just read the background of them.  I do read this book cover to cover for the first time, bu after that I plan to read each advice when needed.  I even started explaining some of the advices to my colleagues. They were very happy with them.    Go buy it!

0385504225|1.0|The world's biggest build-up to a \\"no-ending at all\\" book that I have ever read.    I think the real \\"eternal, all powerful, all secret, etc.\\" message here is that Dan Brown is playing a little joke on his readers to see just how much bull they will pay for.    A couple of points:    Halfway thru the book, Brown draws on Einstein for support.  Einstein would have vomited at being associated with this tripe.    Also, the tallest obelisk in the U.S. is the San Jacinto Monument on the Houston Ship Channel - a little item not well known to eastern, elitist types.  It beats the Wash. Monument by fifteen feet, although it does have a little help from a star on top and a museum at its base.

0374139563|1.0|This book is riddled with errors and misleading conclusions, resulting in a simplistic and even dangerous prescription for African countries.  Here are just two of the biggies:    - Foreign aid has increased poverty: This is wrong on three levels.  Firstly, Moyo aggregates all types of aid in making this assertion.  However, much aid given during the past five decades was to corrupt leaders for purely political or military purposes, and should not be expected to reduce poverty.  By and large, this has changed, though there are still significant exceptions.  Secondly, poverty actually HAS decreased dramatically in African countries (and throughout the world) over the last fifty years in terms of life expectancy (though HIV/AIDS is reversing this in part) and literacy ([...]).  At least a part of these reductions in poverty can be linked to foreign aid, including things like building schools, training doctors and nurses, and conducting agricultural research.  Moyo is correct that poverty as measured by income has stagnated in Africa.  Thirdly, even though this stagnation in income poverty is correlated with (i.e., happened at the same time as)a growth in foreign assistance, it doesn't mean that the first CAUSED the second.  This confusion of correlation and causation really undermines Moyo's credibility, as it is one of the most basic concepts in statistics/economics.    - Foreign aid is antithetical to private sector-led growth: Again, this position shows that Moyo is unfamiliar with the full range of foreign aid tools.  Aid has been used all over the world to help set up commodity and stock exchanges; to work with banks and other financial institutions to provide credit to small businesses; and to work with governments to improve economic and financial regulations.  In fact, foreign assistance played a major role in the development of the microfinance movement that Moyo praises so highly.    Moyo has rebutted accusations that she is against all foreign aid by sayingthat that's a misrepresentation of her position--that in fact she does support emergency and charity-based aid.  But here she is wrong too.  Just to name two major examples, non-emergency/non-charity aid in the form of wheat research created the green revolution that averted the starvation of hundreds of millions of people in Asia and elsewhere; aid in the form of childhood inoculation campaigns rid much of the world of the scourges of measles and polio.    These are just some of the major flaws in Moyo's arguments.  However, there are many more, and they have been well-chronicled in a number of reviews, including by Africans.  Here's one example from a Zambian blog: [...]
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I've been an Alice In Chains fan for many years, back to when Facelift was released. All I can say is that while yes I do miss Layne Staley, it's not fair to deny the rest of the band the right to be called Alice In Chains. People who think otherwise are in my opinion just bitter. The band was and is as a whole a great band, and with William Duvall I think they sound great. I was skeptical at first, but was pleasantly surprised. After a few listens I found myself humming the songs in my head and wanting to hear them again. If you're a long time Alice In Chains fan that does not hold a grudge for them releasing a new album without Layne, I think you will truly enjoy this album. I've been going back and forth listening to the old and new Alice In Chains and unquestionably I think moving forward with the new lineup as Alice In Chains was the right thing to do. I'm looking forward to more!

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|In The Lost Symbol, Dan Brown seems to have forgotten the essential fact of good fiction writing: Great novels are driven by characters, not ideas. The central players in this novel are flat, two-dimensional figures whose main purpose is to serve as mouthpieces for Brown's ideas. It's not that his ideas are bad (some are interesting, some are hackneyed); it's simply that too many scenes exist largely to shoehorn ideas and historical factoids into the work, all to the detriment of any real character development. By the end of the novel, my concern for Langdon and company was half-hearted, because as characters, they had taken such a backseat to the tidal wave of cosmological notions that Brown had offered up. By the book's end, even after the plot had been completely buttoned up, Brown couldn't resist a lengthy philosophical debate that seemed tiresome and gratuitous.<br /><br />Finally, the novel is permeated by a howler: The CIA doesn't engage in domestic law enforcement, so the means and manner in which the agency participated in the plot was preposterous. Perhaps Brown chose the CIA over the FBI because he felt it had more literary mystique. The Lost Symbol is an example of a book which is intelligent, and sometimes clever, but rarely compelling.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|Perfect new album, delivered on time.  All the greatest hits of Lenny.  Price wasn't bad either.  What more could you ask for?
B001J6NZGU|2.0|Sorry but I just could not watch this one.  It all started with Annette Bening and her overdone portrayal of a older, sophisticated New Yorker.  Her voice was so deep and her facelift so severe.  It was hard to look at her.  I just didn't sense any chemistry  in this movie.
B00005Y46O|5.0|`Free Live' should be recognized for what it is, a supreme live document of a talented group of young men who never fulfilled their supergroup potential.  This album is quite simply one of my top ten all-time favorite albums EVER! Paul Rodgers will always be one of my heroes because of the raw power of his voice. It is insane how much emotion and power he is able to infuse these songs with not that his band mates are slackers either. Each man puts in tour-de-force performances in a style that was all Free's. Laid back, soulful but alternately bombastic and gut-wrenching, this record is all about the highs and lows of Free's music in terms of tempo and style.  As I said in other reviews, the true mark of a great live record is that the live versions of classic songs blow away the often over played studio cuts. That `Free Live' was released to cash in on the band's first breakup in mid-1971 makes it historically relevant as well. \\"All Right Now\\" which has been beaten to death by classic rock radio sounds incredibly fresh and exciting here, it's the opener which is surprising due to the popularity of the song even back then.  \\"Be My Friend\\" is even more raw and emotional here as well and \\"Fire and Water\\" could be quite simply Paul Rodgers' best performance. He's like a superhero here, a true god of rock with all his grit and charisma flowing through - this version is one of my favorite songs period! \\"Ride On a Pony\\" from `Highway' is stunning and \\"Mr. Big\\" is phenomenal. Though Andy Fraser is often praised for his bass solo on this song and rightfully so, without Paul Kossoff's weaving lead and rhythm track, the solo would not be as dynamic as both men contribute possibly their finest six minutes in Free's glorious but brief recording career.  The album closes with \\"The Hunter\\" and a studio track(sort of anti-climatic)but eight songs just simply isn't enough which is why the re-master is so key due to the inclusion of \\"Woman\\", \\"Walk in My Shadow\\" and \\"Trouble on DoubleTime\\" among others. `Free Live' should be included on a short list of live classics but don't take my word for it, find out for yourself what made Free so special and why induction into the Hall of Fame should be a must!

I really did enjoy it.<br />As I felt like reading it again, I bought on Kindle store and read on my device.<br />What a disappointment: the e-version / new version (?) is quite different from the first published: many things have been either changed or deleted.<br />What happened ?<br />Has the novel been censored ? and why ?
1932100660|5.0|My wife had an elevated chloresterol level and our doctor recommended she read this book.  After reading it, she then made a significant switch in our diet (eliminated most animal protein with the exception of cold water fish), and I was along for the ride.  We found some good recipes.  She dropped 30 points in her chloresterol in four months, without any medication.  I eventually ordered and read the book on my Kindle.  I found the strength of the scientific evidence regarding the harmful effect of animal based protein (including dairy products) on human health to be overwhelming.  I was no longer just participating in the diet change because my wife was.  I bought 15 paperback copies to give to family and friends.  I went through those and bought another 10 copies and continue to give them away.  I expect I will keep on buying and giving away copies for the rest of my life.  The information is important and needs to be shared.  I collect vegan recipes that are worth cooking again and again and I share them.

1400063736|5.0|I was floored by this book, read it with abandon, felt rudderless when it was done. I've bought it for 3 friends now, not all of whom have loved it as I did. It is dark in places, and gritty, and there is a melancholy that sits with you throughout, but to me it was hopeful above all else - an ode to the power and beauty of imagination.  I read it on my Kindle to start, but will order the hard copy now. It's the kind of book that deserves a place on the shelf, where it can be picked up time and again.

0385504225|2.0|This book never really \\"jelled\\" for me, possibly because I live just outside of DC and commute there everyday, but probably because it just wasn't  a compelling scenario.  But I kept reading, because I was hoping for a revelation moment, or something that would be a moment when I was hooked, like I was in the DaVinci Code.      The writer tried too hard, and I felt I was in a prep for a movie, not in a movie.  Characters like the CIA domina-- please neither sinister nor believable.  What did all the description of her add to the story-- nothing, I'd rather have known why the heck the CIA was leading the case investigation.  The disappointment at the end of the book...rarely felt before.  Langston was a real goofy protaganist - I felt like I was in one of my eighth grade constitution classes at times. The motivation for the evil character's evil was, well, mundane.  Heck the whole build up to the fearful why, was somewhat tedious and frankly not shocking in this world.        Sadly, none of the characters came off the page- they stayed in the two dimensions of letters on a page. Oh well, I read Deception Point too, and it didn't kill me.  Or apparently teach me a lesson about reading books that don't grab me.    Just wish I could get those 5 hours of my life back.  And I bought this book for many of my relatives... they're probably going to want their time back also.  And I'm going to hear about it for months.

0385504225|5.0|Late in life, David O. Selznick would complain that after he made Gone with the Wind (1939), every picture he did was compared to GWTW and, of course, none of them measured up.<br /><br /> So I wasn't expecting another mega hit like The Da Vinci Code. But I was expecting something insanely inventive, like The Da Vinci Code or Deception Point, and that's what I got. Accordingly, my rating for The Lost Symbol is based on the merits of this novel standing on its own.<br /><br /> That said, The Lost Symbol's plot structure is bizarrely similar to TDVC. When I first started noticing the parallels (which didn't take long) I felt annoyed. I feared that since Dan Brown had hit a home run with the plot structure in TDVC, he had simply made a cookie cutter copy in TLS. But then I got into the flow of TLS and found it simply amusing to spot the parallels.<br /><br />A few of the more obvious parallels:<br />1) TDVC featured a special number, 1.618 (phi). TLS features a special number, 33.<br />2) TDVC decoded secrets with poetry in iambic pentameter. TLS decodes secrets with numbers in magic squares (by Albrecht D&uuml;rer and Benjamin Franklin).<br />3) TDVC featured a bizarre character driven to kill by the greed of others. TLS features a bizarre character driven to kill by his own greed.<br /><br />But as I said, finding the parallels serves only as an amusement. What matters is that the story moves right along and constantly introduces us to aspects of history that they somehow forgot to tell us about in high school, such as the ascension of George Washington to godlike status. I also liked the insights into the Freemasons. If I had known about this group in my younger days I would have been seriously interested in joining them.<br /><br />What I didn't like so much was the over-the-top stuff, such as Noetic Science and the description of a new high-tech way to torture people. But as the saying goes, you don't know how much is enough until you know how much is too much.<br/><br />Overall, an excellent read. There just isn't anyone else who can come up with arcane historical and technical material and weave it into a thriller like Dan Brown. Thanks, Dan.<br /><br />PS - If you have any interest at all in things mathematical (and mine is marginal), you'll want to check out D&uuml;rer's AMAZING magic square. How did anyone ever come up with something like this? How is this even possible? See the \\"Albrecht D&uuml;rer's magic square\\" segment in the Wikipedia article at<br />[...]
0312382464|4.0|I enjoyed the second novel in the 'Here Be Dragons' trilogy as Sharon Kay Penman's portrayal of Simon de Montfort is excellent. He was a very complex character and yet Penman does an excellent job of making him a protagonist worth reading about.<br />Personally, I did not enjoy this novel as much as the first- 'Here Be Dragons'- as I became very attached to the protagonist of that story, Joanna. I also became attached to Wales and the Welsh characters and I was a little disappointed that this second novel did not focus upon Wales as much as the first (although I know the final novel 'The Reckoning' once again returns to Wales).<br />I found that this novel improved as the story moved on, as the significance of Simon de Montfort's thoughts and actions became apparent and his legacy revealed. Penman is a very intelligent writer and I enjoy her concepts regarding medieval Britain.
B002K0WBXW|3.0|This film has some cute and fun moments but overall is mediocre.  I'm very fond of Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, but their coupling in this film did not have the spark I was expecting and hoping for.  The pairing was not believable.  Bullock's character never became likable.  That's not the fault of the actors.  Given a well-crafted vehicle, I think Bullock and Reynolds could be as fun to watch as Rock Hudson and Doris Day were in their classic romantic comedies.      The gem of this film is Betty White, most of the laughs are her gift to the audience.  There was chemistry between Bullock and White -- two talented and accomplished comediennes who seemed to enjoy their screen time together.  Craig Nelson and Mary Steenburgen are fine, given how little they had to work with.  The other standout:  the Samoyed puppy.    Worth watching, sure.  Worth renting?  Maybe, if you are fond of light romantic comedies.  Worth buying?  Not unless you are a very big fan of Bullock, Reynolds or White.

B000000I0H|5.0|I really don't know why but I feel like you can't listen to Incantations once and voice your opinion. It is almost like travelling to some exotic vacation spot far away. Even when you are already there it still takes you a couple of days before you really get there. Not only because inside your mind often you have not quite left your own place yet, but it just takes some time to get to feel the culture, the language, to figure out nature. Listening to Incantations is a very similar experience for me. When I travel there I am prepared to stay in for at least a full day, otherwise I don't see a point. If you think such requirement is ridiculous and you would not be interested in such exercise I have a feeling that you will not like this music either. However, if you do listen to this album on repeat for a day you will know exactly what I mean and will most likely chose to extend your experience. It is truly magical in a way.<br /><br />Mike Oldfield became famous at the age of 20 after the release of his record breaking Tubular Bells created by rock instruments applied in a classical format. I guess his timing was perfect and revolutionary, allowing him to expand the horizons of the exploding progressive rock. To be very honest I liked Tubular Bells but not as much as the following it 1974 album, Hergest Ridge. However, in 1975 after the death of his mother Mike had created a piece of music so special that 35 years and thousands of albums later Ommadawn still is and always will be one of my most favorite albums. Perhaps the fact that I like listening to progressive rock as much as I like listening to ambient, electronic, world, modern classical and ambient jazz music makes me feel that way about that magical, tribal, acoustic, electronic masterpiece. Then, after that powerful release Mike Oldfield waited three years prior to releasing this album, Incantations in 1978. It was a long wait well worth it for many of us.<br /><br />Incantations are constructed of 4 length-wise fairly even parts of close to 20 minute each. Strength-wise I think that first and last parts are the best and the second is the weakest one. If you find it problematic getting through some of this music you might as well just play part 4 for a while. That is where all plots Mike develops throughout this amazing mathematical equation of a creation come to completion in a spectacular interchangeable way. Structurally Incantations are quite an architectural achievement. I will let Mike explain: `I wanted to have some magical things in there, so I decided to try using real instruments where I could, real strings and a real flute in the beginning. I'd never orchestrated my own string section, so I thought I'd give it a try. I had a string section of about eighteen players and had them in my studio. With that in place I set about working on this really complicated musical sequence. It went sequentially through every key in the musical scale. It was a Frere Jacques kind of round, but the longest anybody had ever written as far as I know. The whole thing was really complicated. If you listen to it carefully, you realize that it is two parts that cross over and take about two minutes to get round. By some fluke I found the right notes to start the second part, twenty-five and three quarter bars in, all with different time signatures in each bar. Later I got Pierre Moerlen (of Gong) and his brother Benoit to play it, with two interlocking vibraphones. With this magical mood that I wanted to capture, I decided on the title Incantations quite early. The original plan was to get some real incantations; magic spells and chants, rather than making them up.' You get the idea. Mike Oldfield was in charge of his project completely consumed by it and could afford to do it right. This music came out of a real battlefield and it came in stages. He got it started and when the first part was ready he played it to his record company executives who came to the meeting already thinkingabout switching gear and jumping on the punk rock wagon exploding at the moment. They did not like the music which they thought was bad for their image at the time. That realization was a huge blow to Mike and the reason why I think the second part of Incantations was such a struggle for him.<br /><br />Spiritually Incantations are extremely intriguing and as powerful as Ommadawn is. Ommadawn is like a scream of the 22 year young man jumping into the waterfall of tremendous loss and mental breakdown noticing that the beauty of his creation keeps him floating safe from harm. Now, 3 years later a 25 year old man is fighting a battle with demons surrounding his own self. Mike Oldfield approached this creative moment from many different planes. He listened to a lot of religious music at the time but he also was in need of getting himself drunk to sleep every night. This music is not just titled Incantations. This was Mike's real incantation at the time. And now it is with us.about switching gear and jumping on the punk rock wagon exploding at the moment.

B000E41MRC|5.0|Triumph of the Will is not a German WWII action documentary.  What it is - is cinematic art.  Propoganda never looked so beautiful.  Most people agree Adolf Hitler was the 20th century's greatest villian.  But for a brief period in history, Hitler was the face of hope to many Germans.  Not above a little self promotion, Hitler recognized early on the value of cinema.  He hand selected Leni Riefenstahl, a young German actress/filmmaker to direct the first great propoganda movie.  Granted total control and unlimited funds, Riefenstahl produced her master work - Triumph of the Will.  Anyone who enjoys great filmmaking will love Triumph of the Will.
B00026WU7I|5.0|During my life I have met more people who told me this was their favorite album of all music than any other. It probably has something to do with my living in America for most of my life, but I do remember back in late 70ties music lovers in Europe being blown away by this record. This is also my favorite album of this prolific and ambitious musician (next to Pat Garrett & Billy The Kid and Blonde On Blonde). The way the story is told here is so powerful. It is not political nor spiritual, unlike much of his other music. The theme of Blood On The Tracks to me seems to be our loneliness and the lessons it allows us to learn. When we are heartbroken we feel low but the tempo and emotions here are running high. The lyrics are great as we've gotten used to it with this artist but music is (to me) more developed and consistent than on many other of his albums. The quality of the overall recording of instruments was never one of Dylan's strengths but his voice here sounds to me more caring about its own beauty. My favorite tracks of this album are You're A Big Girl Now, Simple Twist Of Fate, If You See Her Say Hello, and Tangled Up in Blue. My favorite songs of Bob Dylan are: Sara, You're A Big Girl Now, A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall, Hazel, Simple Twist Of Fate, Blowin' In The Wind, Masters Of War, PGABTK Main Theme, Under The Red Sky, Senor, Bunkhouse Theme, If You See Her Say Hello, Knockin' On Heaven's Door, Going Going Gone, Lay Lady Lay, Wedding Song. My favorite cover of Dylan song is Masters Of War done by RPWL.

0739321005|3.0|Obama wrote this memoir of his childhood, the start of his organizing career, and starting in law school. All of this is framed within the context of finding out more about who his father is and how that defines Obama himself.    This memoir / meditation is very uneven. I found the most compelling to be Obama's memoirs, especially the time in Indonesia, in Kenya, organizing in Chicago, and the epilogue about his wedding and other development among the family we've come to know in the book. Other segments, especially where he ruminates at great length on black identity in America, I found too long. With this audiobook, Obama narrates it, which is fun except that sometimes, that cool, calming tone turns monotonous.    An added bonus is Obama's speech from the 2004 Democratic National Convention (where Kerry was chosen as the candidate and Obama was running for the senate), which is inspiring and moving.    I wanted to love this, but I didn't. My review, like those Obama cites of when the book first came out, is mildly positive.
B001DU8T6S|1.0|Queen : Queen + Paul Rodgers :: '60s Beach Boys : 80's-present Beach Boys    May, Taylor and Rodgers have dragged Queen's legacy through the mud, much like Mike Love did the same to the Beach Boys. Hell, even the lyrics are just as painful as Love's pandering to teenagers:    \\"Across seven seas through the Panama,  Now they're rockin' on beaches and they're rockin' in bars  Don't ask me how and don't ask me why  From Miami Beach down to old Bondi  There's a rock 'n' roll fever in every place  Next thing you know they'll be rockin' out in space\\"    \\"Music makes the world go round  I've been flyin' on the wings of the sound  It feels so good from way up here  I'm still a believer  Headin' for the stars\\"    \\"In an instant the mysteries of life will unfold  The myths and the dragons of time will explode\\"    \\"I believe there's just once chance in this world to hear our brothers  You believe there's a better way to listen to each other  We don't get what the other guy is saying  We hear the words but we don't understand  So around the world the same old anger raging  And we all cry for shame and the same old tragedy goes down\\"    Okay, I've tortured you enough, I'll stop now. Sure, the lyrics on regular Queen albums weren't always great, but they were never this banal.    Or maybe the better analogy is to Kiss' Psycho Circus, which, despite the fact that it was promoted as the return of the original lineup, featured only marginally more contributions from Ace Frehley and Peter Criss than Freddie Mercury's contribution to this album. Calling this \\"Queen\\" is just crass commercialism; I take this album's claim to being by Queen about as seriously as Bill Wyman takes age-of-consent laws. Everything is completely generic; aside from a few bits where May's distinct guitar tone is evident, it sounds nothing like Queen. It's just banal MOR/adult contemporary drivel imaginable that could've been played by anybody. Even \\"Hot Space II\\" would have been loads better than this. This isn't just terrible as a Queen album; it's a terrible album, period. This deserves to suffer the same fate as the Doors' post-Morrison albums: to be disowned and out-of-print forever. As it is, it'll be filling up bargain bins for years to come.    (I should note that I haven't actually heard the post-Morrison albums, and that they could be decent for all I know. It's just one of the best examples of albums being disowned by their creators that I could think of.)

But the ending is oh-so-clever and rather delightful. I was very pleased with Poirot's tenth published outing. (I admit I haven't read his 7th, the play Black Coffee, but I've read the others.)
0385504225|1.0|I guess I should have suspected something when I saw the critics on the back cover discussing The Da Vinci Code instead of the book I had just bought.

Don't waste your time reading it.
B002KDUDG6|2.0|I really like Michael Bublé.  I think he is one of the most talented singers today with a fantastic and exciting musicality.  Unfortunately, this album comes across as just fluff.  First of all, the engineering of the recording makes everything sound electronic and processed, particularly the brass and strings.  The performances are tight, but this type of recorded sound is so grating and unnatural.    As to the material, I think Michael is really at his best when the voice speaks for itself.  This album is full of over-orchestrated, kitschy arrangements.  Cry Me a River is just bizarre.  The highlights for me are songs like \\"All of Me\\" and \\"Georgia.\\"  The new songs aren't particularly memorable or as catchy as previous albums.      Less is more when it comes to great songs.  I really hope that Michael returns to the kind of arrangements and music where he invited the listener in and the natural beauty and musical talent spoke for itself.

075640407X|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss' \\"The Name of the Wind\\" is the best book I have ever read, bar none, and I love so many of the classic authors, not only those who work in the fantasy genre. It is the only thing I have ever read that made me think, \\"Damn! I wish I'd written that!\\"  I sent an audio book copy to my best friend (who doesn't read books) and he is thoroughly enthralled as well. We have a new \\"secret language\\" now -- not that anyone ever understands us anyway -- referencing The Book. Although it is written as fantasy, it is real and immediate and relevant to life, unless you're content being one of the herd.

0385504225|4.0|This book followed closely the style of Dan Brown's previous works, as would be expected.  It kept me interested until the last 30 pages.  The last chapter almost seemed anti-climactic and contrived.  I was disappointed in the end.  Was it worth the read? Yes.  But not what I expected.
B002C6K7NU|3.0|There are a lot of aspects of this album to comment on...my overall take on it? A little disappointed. The songs are overall pretty good, a couple of great ones, some OK ones, and some lame ones. The best song is Floyd--one of the best post-Ronnie Skynyrd songs ever! Probably the weakest songs IMO are That Ain't My America and Unwrite That Song. And then we have a live version of Red White and Blue--arrgh! That has got to be one of the corniest songs ever penned by Skynyrd. The message is noble enough--hurray for the working class--but the lyrics in the chorus are just unbearably corny, sorry. To an extent, it's the same with That Ain't My America--I applaud the values Johnny sings about, but that song itself is just a little corny as well.    You know, music has changed drastically since the Skynyrd plane crash. Before that, Skynyrd was 100% southern rock and roll, sometimes even referred to as southern metal. A far cry from the country music of that day. However, today, I dare say that Skynyrd now IS country music. A LOT of the country music these days is rock-tinged, sounding a lot like Skynyrd. So I understand that marketers of Skynyrd's music are probably targeting the country music crowd. That would explain all the blue-collar themes that so pervade this album's lyrics. I don't have a problem with those themes, but I think it's a little overdone.    Instrumentally, there aren't enough guitar solos, and most of what are there aren't long enough. The Skynyrd of old was BIG on guitar solos, what with Ronnie calling his three-guitar attack the \\"Guitar Army.\\" It became a trademark for Skynyrd. But over recent years, that trademark has faded away. They still have three guitar players, but there isn't much three-guitar interplay on this album. I can't tell who's who (except for Gary R. on some passages) and some of the guitar leads are buried in the mix. The 3-guitar stamp on songs like \\"That Smell\\" are gone, pretty much. Sad.    The sound is mastered too loud and isgritty (distorted)--not a good thing. The loudness wars are obviously still raging on. One of these days the mastering engineers are going to realize how much of a mistake it is to let sound quality be sacrificed for loudness.    I guess the biggest problem is that Skynyrd still seems to be targeting a mainstream audience, be it rock and/or country and seems to be tailoring their music and lyrics to such. I'm glad they're still around in at least some form these days, and the old Skynyrd will always be my all-time favorite band, but I'm afraid I'm digging the music more of other bands these days that play what they want and don't care if they're underground or not, like Gov't Mule and the Black Crowes. Most of what they're playing these days is pretty much Southern Rock, and seems to be a truer extension of the genre than God and Guns. Again, there are a few good songs on here, but for the most part they seem to be going in a different direction than the path I'm staying on, musically.
B000JLPMPS|5.0|I've seen this movie many times on cable. I was amazed to see if for $9.99 on Amazon. This was my very first Blue Ray disk that I own. A very good movie. Very good cinema-photography on some of the scenics shots. I'm not a western movie fanatic but this is a very strong story. Like \\"The quick and the dead\\".    Any movie with Gene Hackman and Clint Eastwood has to be good. Very good acting.    Thanks Amazon for the great price.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I agree that this is definitely the high point of Joe B.'s career, living out his dream of playing Royal Albert and jamming with God himself, Eric C. It's a great DVD, no question. But I think his Rockpalast was a little better, performance-wise.    For starters, the sound quality is a little muddy due to the famous heavy reverb in that hall. It seems that the sound engineers could have dialed a little more room ambience out of the mix, especially on Joe's guitar. That heavy reverb worked as a great effect for a band like Cream, but they were just a three-piece band. Here, Joe's band is quite large, and some instruments just didn't seem to cut through quite enough. Joe's vocals sound somewhat tinny, as well. I know I'm being picky, it's just that I wasn't quite as blown away as much I thought I would be. And what happened to the guitar changing? It's almost all Les Pauls here. I loved how Joe strapped on a Strat for a song or two on the Rockpalast DVD for a change of sound--especially on Blues Deluxe. For me, that's a better song for a Strat, not a Paul. Not as much variety there as he's given us in the past.    Eric's appearance was enjoyable, even if it was brief and to the point--there didn't seem to be lot of camaraderie between the two of them, aside from Joe's obvious excitement in having him appear onstage with him.    The interview with Joe was fun to watch--he really is a funny guy. And the licks and shredding lines he whips out during the interview are just amazing!    He played slide on only one song--ehh, not enough. He's a great slide player, but there wasn't enough of it. Again, Rockpalast features some of his greatest slide work.    The best part of this DVD is the Just Got Paid cover interwoven with parts of Dazed and Confused...dynamite!    So yeah, a little more guitar variety and a little better mix would have made it better, but overall a great DVD!
B0029O08WA|5.0|Let me start by saying this is NOT the Twilight soundtrack. That is how it should be. The Twilight story and soundtrack are great, but New Moon has a more depressing story so the music needs to be slower. Ok now for the review. This soundtrack is great. I have listened to it multiple times and love it more each time I hear it. I dont know if it will be widely accepted due to the type of music, but in my opinion it is worth buying and listening to several times. Plus it gets you more hyped up for the movies release!
B0029O08WA|5.0|Fits New moon very well, I love all the songs!!!!!!! Very mellow tone to it.  I cant wait to see what song goes where in the movie.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Robert Altman directed this masterpiece set in 1932 at a countryside home in England. When a series of wealthy Brits and Americans gather at this estate one weekend to congregate, have dinner, chat, and shoot birds, a murder takes place. Like many Altman films such as \\"MASH\\" and \\"Nashville\\", \\"Gosford Park\\" relies more on characterization than plot, although the stories are quite good. The major plot of the film centers on the class conflict between those that are rich and those that work for the rich; whenever you pit the rich against the poor high drama will occur. While viewing this film I couldn't help but feeling like I was part of the movie; the movie engages you as your attracted to at least one of the characters. The ensemble cast consists of many of the best British actors out there including Kristin Scott Thomas, Oscar winners Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren, and Emily Watson and a young American actor named Ryan Phillipe who proved he could hold his own against this high caliber group of actors. The DVD consists of audio commentary by Altman and a separate commentary by screenwriter Julian Fellowes who garnered an Oscar for Best Screenplay, deleted scenes, and much more. Get the tea tray out and view an exquisite film that you will watch over and over. Peter Travers from \\"Rolling Stone\\" says \\"a second visit to \\"Gosford Park\\" is twice the fun\\".

0671015206|4.0|I read this book on a recent vacation, and found it interesting reading.  The writers, Thomas Stanley and William Danko, have spent 20 years doing research on various millionaires throughout the United States.  From the early 1970's to the 1990's, the interviewed millionaires on how they became millionaires, and the way the spent or invested their income.  One thing they do throughout the book is compare and contrast two types of millionaires: the PAW's (prodigious accumulator's of wealth) and UAW's (under accumulator's of wealth).  Basically the PAW's are very frugal with their money, and look to build wealth, while the UAW's seem to spend a large amount of the money that they earn.  There is one interesting case study that the two authors do on a PAW doctor and UAW doctor.  They both make the same amount of money, but the two doctors have very contrasting amounts of wealth.  Some people sure know how to spend money.  One thing to note, is that the book does the research with the \\"common man\\" millionaire, and does not include actors and professional athletes.<br /><br />  I would love to see a follow up to this book, with the current \\"wealth\\" of these millionaires in the current economy. Times have changed in the past 10-15 years.  Have some of these millionaire's frugality led them to keep their balance sheets, or did some or many of them lose their houses and personal possessions?

0307454541|5.0|At last, a book that holds your attention, and makes it worth your while spending time with it.  Even once past the massive introduction, the story moves easily and quickly, through a variety of different scenes.  The descriptions are well detailed, easily putting you in the picture.  All the characters are fascinating and complete.  There certainly are some disturbing scenes in the book, but considering all the violence we're subject to in the media in these times, they are no worse than the worst, and needed to support the plot and its characters' motivations.  I found it much easier to move through these pages of violence, than to look at today's television blood and guts hospital surgical/crime drama realism.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the number of characters, which required me to create a list as I read, for later reference.  It was worth the effort, and the story could not have been told without such a large cast.  The story is loaded with (to us Yanks) an alternate international setting, an involved family soap opera, financial misdeeds and schemes, publishing operations, legal drama and consequences, WWII detritus, adult relationships, and ultimately morality vs. immorality. I loved the timing, and the surprisingly early denouement, only to be pleasantly aware that the book still had more to go. My favorite book this year, too.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|I keep waiting to hear a CD from Breaking Benjamin that I don't completely enjoy but I've yet to be let down. Even now, with Dear Agony, I find myself liking them even more than before.<br /><br />I'll go ahead and get the one kind of neutral point of this CD out of the way--it's more of the same. Nothing we haven't really heard before. BUT! Breaking Benjamin is so good at what they do that I don't find myself caring about that. In fact, that's actually what I wanted. I wanted a hard rocking CD with a few 'ballads' strewn about. After a few lackluster CDs from some of my favorite bands recently, BB bring me the dose of hard rock I've been yearning for for oh so long.<br /><br />Dear Agony follows closely in the footsteps of its predecessor, Phobia. Dealing moreso with pain than before, is the thing that makes Dear Agony a bit better even than Phobia though. The entire CD moves swiftly, too swiftly in fact. With only 11 tracks they make good with every song so we don't have to skip any single track. Sure, it'll take a few listens to begin to enjoy each and every song but once you do you'll keep coming back for more time and again.<br /><br />Dear Agony rocks hard. Plain and simple. Every aspect of this CD is just amazing. From the headbang-worthy riffs to the parts where you find yourself screaming right along with Ben without even realizing it, I'm hardpressed to find a downside. The thing, as I stated earlier, that makes Dear Agony so good is the lyrics. I think on Phobia is where Ben really started getting good at writing songs, here he shows that even more. From his 'You can't break me' anthems to his beautiful love song-esque ballads, he's really spread his wings on this record. Another thing that seems to be only getting better is his voice. When he screams he'll evoke more emotion in you than ever before yet when he calms things down and belts out the vocals that truly soar he'll raise goosebumps.<br /><br />Favorites include the lead single I Will Not Bow, the powerful Crawl, the tender Give Me A Sign, the emotionally intense Anthem of the Angels, title track Dear Agony, and the anthemic Into The Nothing. From beginning to end there's no low point to this CD. Highly recommended.e Me A Sign, the emotionally intense Anthem of the Angels, title track Dear Agony, and the anthemic Into The Nothing.

B002LVVCIK|4.0|Michael Moore seems to have sixth sense ability when he makes each of his films. Each new movie hits the multiplexes in a timely fashion, tapping into the zeitgeist surrounding what the story is attempting to explore, what the filmmaker wants to make the public aware of. With \\"Capitalism: A Love Story\\", Moore releases a film about the financial collapse of the United States while the collapse is still going on, while everyone is still feeling the affects of the meltdown. This should surely attract more than a few curious filmgoers and will hopefully expand Moore's ardent and loyal fan base.<br /><br />That said, I didn't love \\"Capitalism\\". It's a good film, an interesting story, but it fails to connect with the viewer in the same way his other films, \\"Bowling for Columbine\\", \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" or \\"Sicko\\" connect.<br /><br />It is a mistake to call Moore a documentarian. He explores various aspects of an idea, usually political, presenting various 'human interest' stories to support his thesis. He can't get anyone with an opposing viewpoint to talk to him because his tactics are too well known. I really think he is more of a film essayist.<br /><br />Given that his films follow more or less the same formula most broadcast news programs cover, it seems more than a little ironic when these same programs attack him for bending the truth. Can any news program be called \\"fair and balanced\\"? Can any news program go into any significant depth when they are so concerned with presenting 'human interest' stories about little kids flying in runaway balloons or in showing video of cats flushing toilets.<br /><br />If you have seen any previous Moore films, this film, which also marks the 20tth anniversary of the release of his first film \\"Roger & Me\\", will seem familiar. Moore interviews various common folk involved in the larger picture he is trying to portray. These folks are victims and their stories often tug at our heartstrings. He also tries to interview politicians, business executives, lawmakers, anyone who is involved at a higher level. He actually gets a couple of elected officials to talk to him on camera, but these people are sympathetic to the cause. These interviews are mixed in with archival footage, news footage, charts, graphics and more all designed to help bolster Moore's arguments. And because Moore can't get anyone at a higher level to talk to him (with the exception of Charlton Heston in \\"Bowling for Columbine\\") he usually includes a few 'stunts' designed to create laughter in the audience.<br /><br />There are two things that really make the best Michael Moore films stand out. First, his interviews with the common folk involved usually are so heart wrenching we leave the theater infuriated and ready to act. These people have been dumped on, big time, by circumstances beyond their control. In \\"Capitalism\\", we watch as a couple have to deal with being evicted from the wife's family property. The husband and some family members hastily box their belongings and stuff them into a truck. They don't have anywhere to go, but they are leaving a property that has been in the wife's family for decades. Then the sheriff shows up to evict them. But the husband explains that they are supposed to have thirty days to pack up. The sheriff is confused and makes some calls.<br /><br />We also watch as another family goes through the eviction process. Moore's cameras are inside their house as we hear them talk and watch multiple sheriffs' deputies pull up to the house. Then, the pounding on the doors begins. The man of the house calls the sheriff and tells him they will leave, but they have to come in and get them, there are also four people in the house. Soon, the doors come down.<br /><br />These are powerful moments, but he doesn't really show anyone else or any other affect of this financial crisis on the common man, on the people of \\"Main Street\\".<br /><br />Another thing Moore always does well is to introduce us to people we neverknew existed. In \\"Capitalism\\", we meet a real estate agent who works in Florida. He owns a company called Condo Vultures and tells us about the people who are vultures, buying up foreclosure properties for pennies on the dollar to resell it later at a profit. As he talks about what he does, he seems to have slight scorn and contempt for the people he works for. We watch as he shows two different condos to the same guy. But as we watch, we can't help but realize that this guy is capitalizing off of the vultures, making money when they do. Yet, he doesn't seem to realize his affect on society.<br /><br />Moore is also good at uncovering facts and little pieces of information that tend to make the viewer's blood boil. This is where \\"Capitalism\\" falters. As an avid \\"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\\" fan, most of the shocking material Moore 'uncovers' has already been covered by Jon Stewart and \\"Saturday Night Live\\". For instance, in the original TARP bill was making its way through Congress, then Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson included a provision in his very short bill preventing anyone from reviewing his decisions and bringing criminal action against him. This bill, thankfully, did not pass.<br /><br />\\"Capitalism: A Love Story\\" is sure to get your blood boiling, by reiterating much of the information you probably already know. But because Moore doesn't provide anything new or startling, anything revealing or telling, the film doesn't seem as memorable as his previous works.<br /><br />Also, the stunt moments seem both oddly placed and a little sophomoric. Moore drives an armored truck up to some of the banks that received bail out money and takes a large bag (marked with a huge dollar sign no less) and demands out money back. Since he can't get in the buildings, he interacts with security guards who are simply doing as they were told. Considering they probably make about $7 per hour, these people are not the criminals. So the joke seems a little lost. Yet, Moore tries to milk it, tries to get some sort of response out of them.<br /><br />Later, he returns and starts to string crime scene tape across the whole of Wall Street. That is a better idea; a more telling statement, but it seems almost lost as the film is coming to an end.orks in Florida.

B0004Z33F0|5.0|I have all of the Rambo movies and the progression to the final movie of course it there with the better video moves that make a movie look so realistic that by Rambo IV, I am closing my eyes through some of the violence.<br /> This movie was very good and another simple, singular Rambo thought to follow and he does, as is his character and his morals. Do what is right, even if you might get killed in the most adverse conditions on earth and feel no pain and don't complain. He does what he know he must do or he could never live with himself, he could not live , period. He would not be a man if he did not try and did not do his duty to save sould and write wrongs. Even if he is a one man army.  I loved this movie.
