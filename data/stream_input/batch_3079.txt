B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|Just found this series on Netflix a few months ago and now we're hooked!  Ordered second season through Amazon and we are currently watching the third season  on TV.  Great casting and quirky.
B002RI9PKO|5.0|While there's been a lot of discussion about the 10,000 hours theory and a lot of people have a problem with it, I found this book fascinating. It's a very easy read with a lot of clear examples. As a theory of expertise, with a lot of data to back it up, this book is excellent and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in why certain people become great in their fields.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Although this series has been out for a while, I have just gotten into them.  All three have been a fun, quick read.  They are a YA series but adult enough for the older reader. :)
1451666179|5.0|Honesty.<br /><br />That's my one word to describe this incredible piece of work.  Allie Brosh is deeply, deeply honest.  Other people describe her humor as self-deprecating.  That's true, in a sense.  Her stories are about herself either as a bundle-of-neuroses adult or as an even weirder kid.  She criticizes many things about herself here: her depression, her avoiding of responsibility, her procrastination, being a jerk to her mom.  But to me \\"self-deprecating\\" describes a different, more timid kind of humor, like slapping yourself in the face.<br /><br />Allie's humor isn't like slapping herself in the face.  It's more like hacking herself to pieces with an axe and then rolling around in the blood.  She's not just having a laugh at her own expense here, she is actively exploring her deepest fears and insecurities.  But there's this amazing balance too.  Anyone who is so harsh on themselves risks coming off as being bitter and hateful, but Allie always stops just sort of making us really concerned, and just joins us in laughing at this ridiculous person.  This ridiculous person she is, and she might as well love because she's stuck with her.  Just like all of us are stuck with ourselves.<br /><br />If we could all look at ourselves with such honesty, such scorn, such empathy, and such forgiveness, we would all be blessed.  Just knowing even one person is out there who does is comforting.  But being able to share in it, reading this book, is a treasure.
B007SGM084|5.0|It was edge of you seat exciting. Can't wait to turn the next page to see what's going to happen!!
B00FRMCYQ4|3.0|This was a decent kids movie but not nearly as good as any Pixar film. The depth of characters wasnt there and the dialogue was not as good as in other movies.
B00CTXBO9M|4.0|Very Good Stuff! This is a fun, competitive game with various entertaining themes for kids, teens and adults to enjoy.
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|I love this movie and now my 2 year old daughter does too. Its so cute and uplifting and entertaining. Adults will enjoy it as much as kids will.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This dictionary was great for me. I used it to learn words I didn't know. It's great for my kids. :)
B007A4SDCG|1.0|This book was terrible. I am a big fan of Pressfield's \\"Gates of Fire\\" and expected so much more. This is a simple collection of obvious, common sense observations. I purchased the book based on The Joe Rogan Experiance Podcast, where Steven Pressfield was interviewed. I got more wisdom from the Podcast (which is free). Joe, clearly I can see you were just sucking up to your guest, because this book was pretty much a wasted read. Save your money folks.
B00F5F0208|2.0|99% of the songs on the album are very slow, mellow, relaxed and go something like this:<br />&#34;hey girl i love you, i want you to come over, and we can do stuff, i love girls, i love girls, girl come over and we can do stuff, come over girl, i like you girl, i want you girl, girls girls girls, how i love girls and they love me and they are perfect...&#34; and on and on from there.<br />personally his collaboration stuff is extremely different in my opinion and every time I purchase his newest album I am dissapointed that I don't get collaboration drake, I get talk slow and sexy to women drake.<br />Mix your tracks up man, an album this linear goes in my garbage.
B00BTLOOAQ|5.0|I love Cecile's style and voice.  She has the magic of all of the great singers of the past and present!  She will be at the absolute top in no time.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I am a huge fan of well researched historical fiction, and this book is so very well done. Engaging characters, accurate portrayal of historical events, I loved it SO much!!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Love the story.  Wish I could live my dreams like Cheryl did. Her book made you feel as if I was there on the trail with her
B004SEUJK0|5.0|This movie is extremely funny, romantic and a little drama. Love all the actor's. Renee Zellweger was brilliant and funny. And for the two leading men ( Hugh Grant & Colin Firth ) they were funny and sexy as hell in this movie. Loved it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is a addicting app that I can't seem to get enough of! You can go at your own pace (for most levels) and you can connect with Facebook to compete with your friends scores and to ask them for lives. I recommend this app for anyone with some extra time on their hands. Warning: ADDICTIVE (:
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game it keeps your mind busy and I like the graphics. It gives me something to do when I am stressed sad depressed.  I would recommend this game to somebody I know.
1593974744|5.0|This is my favorite book, so I got it to &#34;re-read&#34;. I was surprised by the amazing commentary by the author at the end of the book!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is a great game Although very strategic,I also find it to be relaxing. A game for all ages.Extremely competitive for gamers. CAUTION!!!.........Highly Addictive !!!
B00B97SNJI|3.0|I am not sure if there is &#34;difficult third album syndrome&#34; but if there is I diagnose this album with it. I am viewing &#34;Stories Don't End&#34; comparatively with previous releases by Dawes. The reason I purchased it is because I enjoyed there other releases so I feel it is reasonable to see it comparatively. Rather than giving a song by song analysis I will say that I felt the album lacked the energy and finish of previous releases, like it was rushed or made up of songs that didn't quite fit elsewhere. It is not bad, but it is not great either. It feels like a draft rather than a finished piece.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Easy access and fast. Don't hAve to go through a  bunch of prompts before getting to my mail. I like it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved Divergent. I loved the characters, I loved the setting, it was great. It managed to be fresh in a genre saturated with post-apocalyptic settings. And I even managed to get through Insurgent. I got through Allegiant, too - but seriously, what the hell. This novel was a rambling hot mess of trying-too-hard. I just feel confused and bored and really disappointed not only in the ending, but in the overall theme and writing of this novel. Sorry, but the Author bit off more than she could chew for her talents, and it fell miserably flat for me. It wasn't even the ending; it was the same, repetitive arguments between the characters and the vague, dull way the conflicts were (never quite) resolved. Did the characters even change or grow? I can't really tell. I think one did, for sure, but the rest? Nope.<br /><br />Overall, a stellar disappointment.
1250038820|5.0|The concept. The execution. The humanity. I think HONY is a touchstone for me; the Facebook posts make me sigh. Think. Smile.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|She is so good--but wonder about the rest of the characters--and when does she ever spend time with her kids&#62;  Great watch--I watched the entiore season in a day  and now I need the next
B00ARF92HK|5.0|this movie is AWESOME  it is very gory and the special effects are good  great movie overall  great job on Dredd!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A game for all ages from grandma to grand kids. I have become truly addicted to this game. Everyone I know enjoys playing this game.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|An okay book but a little unfocused and less mind opening than his previous books. The book's second half felt a little tacked on and didn't move the main thesis forward as much.
B00AYLTXQC|5.0|&#34;Sessions&#34; is a film based on real life. It's a film about a man who has a severe disability (polio) and lives in an iron lung. He graduates college and becomes a poet. He finds one thing missing in life though. He wants to have sex or better yet a relationship with a woman. This is something he has never had due to his inability to perforn the physical requirements to have sex.<br />He finds a Sex Surrogate. Played by Helen Hunt, who does a wonderful job to show &#34;Mark&#34; how he can indeed have sex. Helen Hunt was excelletn in the role and had no quams to play the role just the way it was perfomed for real. She wasted no time performing as a woman who has no problem taking all her clothes off. I was a bit suprized in Helen's full frontal nudity in the film but she played the role so well and decently, the fact she had nothing on became secondary to the real issue. Could Mark establish a sexual relationship with someone ??<br />Check out the movie and find out for yourself. It's well acted, and done decently.<br /><br />Steve
0425256162|3.0|I am a huge fan of Alastair Reynolds and am a fan of most of his work. If you were considering buying this book because of your love of the Revelation Space novels and stories, House of Suns, or even Harvest of Time, please reconsider. It's not that the story is slow to develop or that none of the characters are likable -- something that would describe much of Reynold's work -- but that there's nothing engaging enough about the plot. Some of the elements seem borrowed from Revelation Space, but I did enjoy the exploration of telepresence and the relative lack of mutilation and involuntary body modification that Reynolds fetishizes in other stories.<br /><br />I didn't find this novel as excruciating a read as Reynolds' Terminal World, but I did have to keep forcing myself to pick it back up.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Fun game and easy to use. I would recommend this game for anyone that likes puzzle games.  Hours of fun!
B00F91H666|3.0|If you want action, drama, or edge of the seat suspense, this will leave you wanting. The effects are okay, and the plot has SOME promise... but overall the movie was more comical than anything else. Unfortunately, it wasn't MEANT as comedy. The plot is somewhere between  &#34;I Am Legend&#34; and &#34;Outbreak.&#34; It manages to fall short of either. I was amazed that Brad Pitt even TOOK this role. I hope they paid him well.
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|Another wonderful and enjoyable book by Gary Renard and a great way to finish the trilogy of his experiences as a student and teacher of A Course In Miracles.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I am weary of special effects movies with no plot. I was very pleased that the cool effects in this flick actually SUPPORT the plot rather than substitute for a plot. The acting isn't quite on the Oscar level, but overall was decent. The plot really surprised me (pleasantly)... but to mention why would be too much of a spoiler.<br /><br />I really liked the tie-in to the original series and the movie versions. Thumbs up!!!!
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|This game is involved, but at the same time you can have plenty of fun just making rockets and sending them around the earth. No need to go to mars! I was really quite surprised with all the physics involved in this game. Works great on both my Android Tablet and my Samsung galaxy S4. Either way you can't go wrong. And for free it was quite a deal there are HOURS and HOURS of gameplay in this game I am sure.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Works fine for reading titles, easy enough to use. However you can't use certain kindle titles such as &#34;NY Times Crossword&#34; which I really like and use quite a bit on my &#34;real&#34; Kindles.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|We really like Daniel Craig as James Bond and when we saw this movie at the theaters we knew we would have to own a copy of it to watch again.  A great deal of action and classic James Bond. Love it!
B001XUPGLY|5.0|EDGE OF THE SEAT ACTION ALL THE TIME!<br />BEEN A &#34;TREKKY&#34; FOR YEARS AND THIS IS THE ICING ON THE CAKE!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's very addictive a d fun. I spend countless hours playing this game.Keep it coming,and by the way I lime that it's free.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This is one of the best family movies I have seen in a long time.  My whole family was laughing out loud throughout the entire movie.  Great story!!!!
B00005JSGK|5.0|I ordered it for my sister, I guess it must have been good,I haven't heard her say it wasn't good she likes John Wayne
B008RA3X5E|2.0|Since using this app battery becomes depleted before alarm can come on. Likely because once set it's always on. Nice visuals and sounds,just keep kindle plugged in over night and turn it off when not using.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I very much enjoyed the book.  I listened to it and found it very captivating.  It helped to fill in gaps in the story of Jesus.  It helped provide a clear picture of Jesus on earth and helped identify the humble way he presented.  The information about the Gospels being written by followers of the apostles Mathew, Mark, Luke and John make sense as well as the likelihood the information was presented in a context of the times and as a representation of beliefs rather than a step by step narrative of Jesus' life.  Thus the differences in the Gospel contents as well as the similarities of information
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book, it is sad but happy too! I read it quickly and enjoyed every minute of it!
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|This is a well written and informative book.  Malala has great insight and depth for a young woman and has experienced so much for someone her age. I would suggest this book for people of all ages!!
B00F30S0Y0|2.0|It has its moments, but this album is poorly produced and overall just a mess.  Do they think their devoted fans will gobble up and worship whatever they release?  I just don't feel it with this one.  And the congas are truly nauseating.
B00CHS31DG|5.0|I just got this app now and I wanted to try it. I had the first one but it didn't seem that cool so I deleted it. I got this 5 mins ago and wen  to look at at... right off the bat a yellow dot appears and runaway some mumbled stuff,,, I've never exited out of an app so fast, I'm scared of paranormal stuff because I'm scared from paranormal activity when I was 7 and no  even writing this my heart is thumping so fast, a) because its a Halloween and 2) I'm laying down alone in my room with my light off at night.... it's freaked scary. My family has been known to arrest get 2 or more paranormal events in their life,,, but I'm scared... and a family member just died of mine so I've kinda sorta tried talking to him before I got this app,,, but seriously you must get this app it will be that scariest and best app I'll ever have,,,
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|it's so much fun and adorable!!!! don't listen to the 1 and 2 stars it's all lies... the game is easy to control. this game it worth it. so I give it five stars.
B0094K1PW4|5.0|What a great movie, very well thought out, very surprising, just  as good as Goonies, or better. not for the little ones though.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Even if you've read her blog, you'll love the book. It's worth reading more than once and sharing with friends.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Read it ....they are Awesome!! Couldn't put them down .. Read it..  read them it has serious page turners !
B008MVPF4K|5.0|...is always Crocs :) fantastic item. Love them so much and it's wonderfull hahahah<br />I would recommend them for everyone :)
B003YL4KS0|5.0|this book  was very helpful even being a  person  with ethnic hair. The  information  was  applicable  and I've  been  able  to  use the techniques  with  great  success  for me and my daughter although  we have different hair  types.
B00DZAWPNM|5.0|As usual, Panic at the Disco have changed styles for this album, with a focus on pop music. I found it fun energetic music with good thought provoking messages. Life long fan. 5 stars.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great<br />The first time I was going to be like my plan. Kill all the Giants and now I'm get all the stuff I can.
159562015X|5.0|I bought these books for a gift.  I did the questions and what a revelation. One or two I figured would be me, but the rest was so surprising and interesting - I thought perhaps it was a mistake I made, but, asked my friends and family and they said I was right on!  Helped me to see myself and work on the skills/gifts that I didn't realize I had!  JA
B0085A9HXS|5.0|This is the best martial arts, action movie I've seen in a while. I love it! I've seen it so many times, that I think I know it by memory already. If you're a real martial arts junkie, you definitely need to get this ASAP.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Wow! I couldn't put it down! I love how Vivian's story was told by weaving it in and out of Molly's own tale.  This is a very well written story that just reaches out and grabs your interest and your heart from the very beginning. What a horrible time in American history, which the author brought alive through Vivian and Molly's lives. I would highly recommend this book!
1451666179|5.0|The book's content? Maybe you know about it already from the blog, the one with the same name as the book. If so, you know that these are stories combined with cartoons -- artfully, deceptively simple cartoons. And you know that the stories, from life, are like life -- funny, horrible, cyclic, full of embarrassment, whimsey, mess, ambition, loss, imagination, the adoration of simple animals, and the cold fish slap of reality.<br /><br />If you know the blog, you'll want this book. Not only are there new stories (about half), but some of the best blog stories are here, all in one place, and have been tweaked just a little to give the book a consistent look. The book itself is also a quality production, (I got the paperback.) Each page is thick and glossy, and the colors are bright. Plus, every chapter has its own background page color, so that the edge of the closed book looks like a roll of Necco wafers. It's actually kind of awesome, and you can find it in a pile quickly, which is good because I've been reaching for it a lot.<br /><br />And if you don't know the blog, buy the book for a great read, a laugh, and a cry, mostly all at once.<br /><br />Guaranteed that after you get the book, you'll immediately think of between one and four friends who also need it.
B00003CX5P|5.0|My order arrived on time and in the condition advertised. This was a gift for my husband to add to his Star Wars dvd collection.
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|Great project as usual!!!! All of the artist really did there thing. This project is a must have. True music artists!!
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|It was a alright movie. Not the best I have ever seen - No back story which I wish there could have been.Not the worst movie either.
B00D2CYU2W|1.0|Simply awful.  I do not enjoy a movie when the script calls for the actors to roll around in bed.  I don't enjoy the action of that for straight couples or gay couples.  Did not watch it entire movie.  Put it in the garbage.  Story may have been ok.  But couldn't get over all the bedroom action.  This story was not about Liberace and who or what he was to the entertainment industry but was about his sexual orientation.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|Eye Opening Film - Thank you for making a great film, My entire family enjoyed it very much. Gas Lands
B00F1CRSKM|5.0|I've been a huge fan for years.  I really love this album.  Doesn't have as many &#34;hits&#34; as the previous ones, but it's their best complete album, from start to finish.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Can't get enough, you'll fall in love with Daryl Dixon and Rick Grimes! Keep your eye out for small details easy to miss
B00DU73T08|2.0|Not horrible, but really not that good.  Very generic acting, plot, direction and effects.  Seemed more like a made for Syfy movie than a big budget blockbuster
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I just hate having to wait for energy.  But I still really enjoy it. You should try it for yourself.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very fun game.. I play once a day and it has kept my interest. One of my most favorite downloads.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I am a Mark Cuban Fan.  This is a great book and a very easy read.  I read this book in about 4 hours max.  It's a great insight about how Mr. Mark started from the bottom and the key rules he used to help him achieve goals as an entrepreneur to become very successful!<br /><br />Great Book Mark --&#62; Write another
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It is a wonderfull idea to carry my bookshelves in the palm of my hand.this will not be an excuse anymore for not reading.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This was one of those books you did not want to end. I loved the story and the correlation between Vivian and Molly.<br />Great reading!
B001L83PLQ|1.0|The book was over before I understood anything about why the characters were developed. The end of the book steered you to twenty more &#34;recommended&#34; books...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Hey it is a soap opera but a great one.  You grow to love the characters, and Maggie Smith is just exceptional
B00000FC5H|5.0|Everyone everywhere of every age knows these songs.  Will defintely get your party going  - up and dancing.  Great album.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|While the game itself is nice, the music is rather.... soporific. I seriously have to turn the music off and listen to something of my choice or I will end up falling asleep. While I understand that the game is supposed to be relaxing, it shouldn't be THAT relaxing....
B0078XGEK2|5.0|If you are open to change, it will open your mind to new opportunities for healthy living.  The wisdom of the words in this book will create new reasons for growth and development
B008FRFN7A|1.0|This app is not the best as far as I can tell. I still can't print anything from my kindle fire hd. not worth getting to me.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|This a movie of a man obsessed with scent. He loves them all and makes no distinctions between bad and good scents.<br /><br />I am someone who adores perfumes and have quite a collection so the beginning of the movie really touched a chord with me about how he soaks in all the scents almost as though they were tangible objects. The movie does a good job of showing the smells as tangible objects, too.<br /><br />I found the move to be wonderfully haunting, beautiful cinematography and when the search for the ultimate scent leads to him murdering women (although why he couldn't have explained what he wanted to do beforehand, then got a woman who was willing) it felt like a child who wonders why he gets hit by a truck when he runs out on the road.<br /><br />All he wanted was the scent, this kind of magical, awesome scent that would change the world, and because he murders to do it, the movie is deeply dark and haunting.<br /><br />I have never seen a film quite like it, and I have never read the book though I tried but all the descriptions slowed the pace too much for me.<br /><br />The ending was a bit farfetched as if one drop couild transform a crowd of people, so I felt this was overdone, but the main character does a good job of being this darkly strange man who has trouble escaping his obsession, until he just gives into it and searches and searches for the scent he knows he can create.<br /><br />This did not feel like a horror film to me. No mistake, I was disgusted with his methods with the women, but this was no gory, slash and burn kind of film.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It's a fun quick read that I took on vacation with me.  It wasn't mind blowing and only slightly better writing than the first book.
B0058VW36U|2.0|After playing this game for a half n hour, its more of a casual game for casual players that don't really play video games unless they are driving while texting/gaming because it seems that is the only time they play games and of course at doctor appointments or anything that requires waiting for a few minutes.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I have yet to get bored with the series. Loved this book and so glad to see how things turned out. I'm excited to read the next book.
B0058P7KUA|3.0|I only downloaded this app because it was free since I don't buy mobile games, so if it's free then go for it.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I have probably listened to this album at least 200 times since buying.  The entire album is great.  There is not one song that I don't like.  Its a great listen!
B008EL25LE|3.0|I only got this app because it was free since I don't like to pay for mobile games but if its free then go for it
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|What can I say?  &#34;Ultra Man 2013!&#34;<br /><br />It is entertaining and the graphics are awesome.  Kungfu fighting robots and monsters.  LOL  Gotta Love it.
B007FJFDXS|3.0|Got this for free when it was available for free. I only spent about 2 hours playing this and it can be addicting after you get the hang of it!
B00FRMCYQ4|5.0|This was a cute family movie that made us laugh and it's even entertaining for mom and  dad.  We bought this and I'm sure we will watch it many more times. Loved the character and the fact that he was trying to chase his dreams.  A positive movie for the whole family.
B00CHS31DG|3.0|Not bad and I only downloaded this because it was free since I don't see myself paying for this app.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast does what it says it does. I wish it did more, but it accomplishes exactly what it claims on their website. I'm getting of XBOX live in favor of casting Netflix to my Chromecast. I cannot wait for more development.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game! I have to make myself put it down! Need more levels and some that are more challenging.  But I still think it's great!
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|My six year old son loves this movie as does my wife and I. Highly recommend this movie to everyone.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Iron Man never fails to be fun and exciting. Iron Man 3 is my favorite in the trilogy! I highly recommend this DVD to superhero adventure lovers!
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|The Kids love it except when it freezes up sometimes. Adult and kid friendly. My husband sneaks it when the kids are not playing it.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This was a wonderful season. I was caught up in it the whole time.  It ends on a cliffhanger of course, as usual.  Not sure I like the end, but it wasn't a bad ending.  Now I can't wait until the next season.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is highly addictive. I have not actually played it , but 3 kids and my husband are addicted.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Of course this review comes down to personal preference, but as a long time fan of Star Trek, I could only say the greatest things about this movie...and all Star Trek movies and TV programs :-)
B008YU0AOE|5.0|No just kidding I like sucks Crap........ totally it just is offensive not cool man tots note cool bra also you pooop

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thought I would check out this candy crush game out. All my friends were playing this game. So I did, and now I'm hooked. Clean fun.
B008Q0AP2E|4.0|Strong stars swift pace of action, a cut above regular horror flicks.worth the over two hours. Two thumbs up .
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was fun book to read and had some funny parts to it.  If you enjoy light romance and light reading this book is for you.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  Beautifully written.  I highly recommend.  It provides great perspective on love, friendship, death.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is so good the only problem is 1 there are only three maps and 2 it sometimes kicks me out for being idle in the menus.but over all the buddy fps game on the kindle fire.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool surprised me right from the start in the manner the author chose to begin the story. It captivated my attention and built tension immediately. Howey takes his time introducing you to the world he is inviting you into, even before he introduces the story's main protagonist. I liked that sense of anticipation, and he does a great job of continuing to build that tension, never letting the characters have it too good for too long.<br />The characters were well done and believable. I think he does an excellent job of letting you into their heads with his many perspective changes. He does an especially good job of this toward the end when the stakes are higher and you can foresee challenges as the reader that the characters are yet to piece together.<br />The author also does a great job with technical detail. I know some other reviewers have complained about the amount of details making the story challenging, but I for one, very much enjoyed the logical use of machinery and tools throughout the story. I feel like the Silo was well thought out, both physically and socially, and you can tell the author put a great deal of time into its design.<br />I was very tempted to give the book 5 stars because it was extremely well done overall and it kept me up reading on a couple of occasions when I should have been doing something else.<br />There were only a couple of glitches that dug at me. One was the fact that the characters and tension were so well done throughout, especially the main villain, who was quite detestable,  I felt the ending should have been given more time. (SPOILER WARNING) It felt a little rushed at the end, and the villain, whom I had been looking forward to see get their comeuppance, was dealt with in a surprisingly anti-climactic manner, and through the aid of a character we knew next to nothing about.<br />Also, upon closing the book, more than a few logical details about the resolution nagged at me. The ending was believable, but a tad convenient. That being said, I still really enjoyed the read. I purchased the book at a local bookstore for $15 and found it worth the investment of both my time and my money.<br />I have been inspired by the book's story of becoming a best-seller and would definitely read more about this world and recommend it to others.hat being said, I still really enjoyed the read.

0804137501|5.0|With their first work/life-altering book \\"Rework\\" David and Jason started giving an inside-view into their company 37signals and their opinions on work and how to get things done. With their new book \\"Remote\\" they continue showing how companies and their employees can set up a proper remote environment gaining all the benefits out of it while getting rid of the constraints and distractions of a physical office and its painfull, stressful and mind-chrushing commuting.<br /><br />Having a strong remote workforce means you can hire the best people world wide doing their best work whereever and whenever they want. No more distractions and unproductive work in office or wasting energy by commuting - the technology for collaborative remote work is out there and its costs can easily be covered by saving expensive office rentals.<br /><br />Of course everyone has to figure out what fits best into the own company but given those profoundly practical inspirations it is important to point out that you can easily start small and getting bigger in remote.<br /><br />\\"Remote\\" is not the traditional busines-book - it is not full of tough and abstract coaching theory. David and Jason share the experiences and improvements made by being a strong remote workforce at 37signals since day 1.<br /><br />Mark Cuban said about \\"Rework\\": \\"If given a choice between investing in someone who has read REWORK or has an MBA, I'm investing in REWORK every time.  This is a must read for every entrepreneur.\\"<br /><br />I would transfer this to \\"Remote\\" saying: \\"If given a choice between an employer who has read and understood REMOTE and an employer where the CEO is called Marissa Mayer I would go for REMOTE.\\"
B008J34466|5.0|Absolutely crazy about this album.  Some songs are a little graphic but overall the album is really very good and enjoyable.
0425269205|5.0|I bought this before I read the book. The contents aren't great but the cover art is great. I just like to look at it and think back to all the great books that were in this series. Look at the cover of the book and don't judge it by its contents.
B000002B9I|5.0|I had this on tape and I absolutely loved it so I bought in in cd.  Beautiful music. I love when she sings in Spanish.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|I bought this for a friend of mine's child. I had it shipped to their house the day of his birthday party. When I arrived for the party all the kids were piled in this little fun factory. They all loved it. We had 4 children playing all at once from 2-4 years of age. It help up well.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It does what it is meant to do! :)<br />I got mine for a great price also! I also find this product will fit other devices too!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Well written book. Great ideas, interesting battle tactics, and characters you can really enjoy. I'm a bit sad that the rest of the books in this series so in such a different direction. I should have stopped reading with this one.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Enders game is a good read hard to put down, it had good flow no slow parts just a really good book
B00FFVML74|5.0|An amazing series that draws you into the lives of people in a tormented small town.  Fabulous acting and a satisfying, moving finale, after multiple (sad) twists. Binge watching for sure, perhaps in two sittings.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Everyone  has been talking about it and now u can play it and have fun with your friends!!!!!! ;)<br />It's so cool!!!
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|Admittedly, I should have done more research before buying this book.  It was a best-seller.  I read the first few sentences, thought it sounded interesting, and purchased it.  What I thought was going to be an adult reflecting back on events of an traumatic childhood turned out to be an adult reflecting back on a childhood that was fantastic.  Not &#34;fantastic&#34; in a terrific sort of way, but fantastic in a fantasy sort of way.  And not fantasy in terrific sort of way, but fantasy in a creepy, chilly, gross sort of way.<br /><br />The plot was interesting enough to keep me reading, but the details were disturbing enough to make me feel like I needed a shower at the end.  Now that I think about, the author really should be commended for being able to make me feel something so strong and powerful in his book.  It is just not the sort of feeling that I like to get from my reading.
B002RI9VXA|5.0|Too many readers give up too soon on this one.  Don't put it down.  It may be the most profound.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|my fiancee and i are enjoying this series and have acquired quite a few ideas for our wedding outfits. all in all well done!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Kept you riveted throughout. Wonderful flow of words that describe feelings of all characters. I recommend highly to all who like a good read
B00ECUARO8|3.0|This movie is definitely one of those that does not live up to the critical acclaim.  It was well acted, but the story lacked substance.  I kept waiting for more, but it never really happened.  I am glad I did not pay to see it.  I rented it from my local library for free.  At that price it was worth watching.  It was mildly enjoyable,  not much more.  Do not buy the DVD.  You will only want to watch this movie once.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Don't expect to do this 5 minutes at a time...I started and before I knew it, an hour had gone by!  Very addictive and fun.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|IT WILL DRIVE YOU CRAZY.  But, try and stop playing.  Just when you want to quit you will come back again and again.  Then you will look for more friends to play with.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|My kid loves this movie and won't stop watching it.  It's pretty entertaining for adults too.  Especially if you were a fan of video games in the 90's.
B00CFYAT6O|4.0|Music to listen to when I am stuck in traffic and just want to fade away into a better place.
B00ANA27IU|4.0|For Arthur C. Clarke the vision of future is unmatched. More science than fiction, hard to put this book down.
B00DB2JQ7W|4.0|I was only familiar with a few songs from Govt Mule and this CD rounded out my initial gravitation towards their sound. Lots of tunes and a varied mix.
B008V8FVTI|4.0|Compelling story, well told and acted.  But the subject was painful to see in such glaring focus and implication.  Watch only wtih adults
0857207520|5.0|I just love reading about all the generations.....the Rivers.....Woodvilles....so many Annes and Elizabeths, Edwards, Henrys, and Richards....but if you read them all, it all comes together!  Like a history lesson!
B00CP4RZCU|5.0|this is a great cd from start to finish a homerun I really enjoy him live and this captures this perfectly
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I love Bones and had to start collecting all the seasons to complete my collection. And I was able to watch Bones from the first episode to the last without any commercials!

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham did a excellent job of giving clues all the way throughout the book. The description of the characters was vivid. He maintained enough intrigue to make a few unexpected surprises at the end.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|This is a really fun action movie with a lot of entertainment value as long as you like movies of this kind. It is not meant to be taken seriously or analyzed for Oscar worthiness. The special effects are also good quality.
1423113497|5.0|My kid loves these books. Now he has me reading them along also.  Great story line and I only wish I had bought the completed series not just the first 3 books.  Enjoy!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|While I'm not alone in my addition to Candy Crush (I play via my Droid phone and home computer), I was disappointed to get my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this app was not available.  Once I received Amazon's &#34;new games&#34; notification I immediately synched.  Game works just like on my other devices.  Now if Amazon could provide the Adobe Flash Player app my Kindle would be complete.  Love my Kindle Fire and Thank You Amazon for keeping up on the apps people want!
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|After all the glowing reviews, I expected much more than this soap opera of three women facing various life crisis. SPOILER: was frustrating that none of them really grew as a result of the problems they faced ( at least, I didn't get a sense that any real insight occurred ).  And I felt the stories dragged on.  Too much handwringing and melodrama for my taste.
B005QPMB2Y|1.0|After hours of trying could not get it to work on my Kindle Fire.  I have a WinBook security DVR model# D6384HT, which is not listed in the list of DVR's.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|I've had this for a month and a half and haven't even watched the movie yet because of all the fantasticqlly produced and informative documentaries. This should be in any film lover's collection - even those who say they didn't like this movie. The process of making this film and that it is, as one individual in the documentary states, the last &#34;analog science fiction film&#34; should make you want to investigate this film further, intpret its intended meaning and may convert former &#34;non-fans.&#34;
B008FYZIVY|5.0|And we imagine we will want to look at it again sometime so we purchased the series that we had missed when it ran the first two seasons.  We recorded season three but can see ourselves purchasing the third season we like it so much!
B0039HR5QS|5.0|No matter how old it is, this is still one of my favorites.  It's fun, smart, exciting, and has Robert Redford in his prime.
B0000062Y2|5.0|I plugged this into car DVD player as soon as I received it last spring JUST to get ready to watch the DVD of Jesus Christ Superstar that we also purchased.  In fact, I purchased a second soundtrack on DVD to give as a gift to a good friend.  She took it on a road trip just to sing along!  This film was a big deal when I was young and I find dimming the lights with my mate and a glass of good wine with our feet up is a relaxing way to spend an evening!
B0034G4OVS|5.0|It was really good! The movie was unpredictable! The scenes were crazy good. Def. a must watch and good for a date night! She will def.snuggle up under you from the gruesome scenes lol
B0017SWPXY|2.0|Book was just OK.  Had to read it for my book club but would not be interested on my own.
159463176X|5.0|Hard to put down once start reading.  Heart-wrenching stories that take you to a world that it is hard to imagine it can exist but unfortunately it does.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Completely satisfied with this google product.<br />I use it for watching youtube videos and netflix movies with very good hd quality.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Great season full of laughs and love. Amazon had it out to me quickly with no sort of faults to the packaging or discs.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|Had seen actors in other work.  Enjoyed the &#34;reality&#34; of entrepreneurship and the pitfalls of big business paired with friendship and loyalty
B0063M22QO|4.0|Nice game.  Very interesting and a very good game to pass time while waiting or in the car.  With the choice of three ways to play, it's as easy or difficult as you want it to be.<br /> very entertaining, yet calming at the same time.<br />  This is my go-to game when I want to play Mahjong.<br />  I would recommend this game to friends or anyone looking for a good Mahjong game.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Great game and fun playing. Would highly recommend. Keep up the great design work. I look forward to more games
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|yes it hooks you in - only the most patient will not pay for this &#34;free&#34; game many times over buying lives and levels
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Very entertaining action movie. I would have gave 5 stars but it was a little hard for me to follow in places.
B006UIUJ2A|5.0|Intelligent, funny, and enlightening. Will probably read it again. Which I generally never do.<br />Also an interesting peep into one of the strangest countries on the planet.<br />Found my self googling some of the facts in this book that were to weird to be true, and guess what - they were.
B001EC3JME|3.0|After a few uses if the flashlight does not have a &#34;big&#34; head it will slide out of the holster.
B007G92QGO|2.0|It starts out interesting. I was intrigued by the initial setup of the plot.<br /><br />Before I got halway through it though, the plot had lost all momentum, and the narrative had become repetetive, unfocused and whining, virging on resentful.<br />I got the impression that there was supposed to be a message in the story - some kind of radical, controversial or unorthodox thoughts to glean from it.<br /><br />But there isn't. There are a couple of half hearted attempts to go after the judiciary system, and even a debate that involves an exceptionally worthless and unfounded theory on genetics.<br />The characters are poorly drawn out, even the ones at the center of the story. Some of them are introduced in a manner that would suggest they actually have an actual part in the story. But then they disappear, and are never heard of again. One of their neighbours appears in, let's say 7-8 sentences. Two of those sentences descibe how fit she is. An athlete of olympic proportions, apparently. And, well, I mean, why should I care? She has no bearing on the story, and disappears completely after the first few pages.<br />There are really only 3 people in this story. In spite of that, we never get to know any of them. And the relations between them is constantly of a confusing nature, to say the least. A lot of pages are spent on attempts to describe how the ordeal affects the realtionship between man and wife.<br />And then it ends, with what I can only describe as an &#34;easy way out&#34; for the author. But by that time I had long since stopped caring. Both how the story went, and even more what happened to the main characters.<br /><br />Non-existing plot, poor narrative, infantile ideas, non-likeable one-dimensional characters<br /><br />The only reason I give this two stars is that I actually managed to finish this utterly trifling, unimportant and ultimately just plain boring book, with it's annoying theories and childish rants.
B000XXLY6I|4.0|Fit is VERY roomy! Nice quality... not quite like their higher line, but good for me. Must size down!!! From my experience, I wear an 11M in pretty much everything. I read the reviews and knew I would have to size down too. I first started off with a 10.5M... still too big. Returned them with no problem at all. Great return policy I must add! Then ordered a 10M and a 9.5M. The 9.5 was perfect for me! I took out the insole and compared it to my Superfeet Green insole (size 11) and they are the exact same size. Very happy now!! It's true, they are very comfortable right out of the box provided you have the correct size.<br /><br />Good luck & Enjoy!
B0082FPIY8|3.0|Good well written read. In complete awe of her journey though maybe not her life hardships! Would definitely recommend it!
B008Z9L94O|5.0|To all the people criticising the vynil version of MCIS, you should know that the depth of the sound of this album make it almost impossible to duplicate on vynil without cutting some frequencies.<br /><br />The original vinyl press was not even stereo and had the bass cut down seriousely to accomodate the format.<br /><br />Vynil is a better, warmer and more dynamic format for classic rock, jazz and pop music, but as soon as you approach screeching highs and power bass it doesn't even come close to the frequency spectrum of the CD.<br /><br />As you should have notcied, heavy metal fans don't buy Vynils. That's exaclty the reason. Metal focus on scorching highs and powerful bass and drumming, scooping out the mids. That goes for opera as well.<br /><br />As much as i love Vinyls, MCIS is and will always be superior on CD or digital format.
B000WS4PCO|5.0|After making a leap forward sonically on The Unforgettable Fire (1984), U2 would make an album that still had the same elements but would expand them even further on The Joshua Tree, released in 1987. Working again under the production of Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, U2 made a record that has somewhat influences in folk, blues and country, not straightforward as they don't use this in its roots but more as a way to add unique textures to the songs as it still has its Lanois and Eno like touches that make it feel more modern. There is a lot of yearning in songs like \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\" and \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" and \\"With Or Without You\\" always has a darkness to it I think. Bono searchers for hope and resolution in these lyrics. There is the stripped down and simple \\"Running To Stand Still\\", in which Bono again speaks about the despair and struggles of drug use, just as he did on \\"Bad\\" one album earlier. Of course, The Edge is another important contributor as his guitars while very simple, it really takes you places, you almost feel like you're in the dessert, on a mountain top or any distinct location through out. It really speaks to you. It is a little ironic that U2 became superstars on the success of a dark and personal record but in some way, it felt appropriate for the times. In the wake of Madonna and other 80s pop music, this becoming one of the decade's biggest sellers was a breath of fresh air and to this day, it remains a work of subtle and raw beauty.
1423124960|5.0|We absolutely LOVE these books! My kids can put them down! These books are great for before bed story time!
B0088EDMMS|5.0|I can watch Hocus Pocus year round. It's a great Disney film that is easy and laid back. It might just be an age group movie though. It is by no means meant to be taken seriously and because of that it is a great laugh
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great work out video. You cant go wrong with any of Jillian Micheals workout videos and this one is awesome too!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I am a trekkie (new age) I still love the classic Star Trek shows and movies but the new ones are visually astounding that it deserves 5 stars just because of that.  The story is good along with the acting. The movie will most definitely turn you into a trekkie
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Book 3 was split between 2 points of view, which could be confusing if you forget to read which name starts the chapter.<br /><br />Because of the split, the book tends to feel slower and at times less driven, but it also feels quite developed and it's nice to get into Tobias's head.<br /><br />I appreciate the tying up of all the loose ends, which so many books don't give. A satisfying end to the trilogy.
B00FN8HS5O|5.0|This is the first work of Price that I've listened to. His work here is complex, multilayered, exhilarating, hypnotizing, and at times, deeply moving. Anyone who loves the Crystal Method or the Chemical Brothers should enjoy this album.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|For anyone expecting Arcade Fire to deliver a sequel to their last brilliant album the Suburbs, this will probably be a mild disappointment. However, give the album a chance and it will probably grow on you. The band has been exploring new avenues both musically and intellectually, and this album offers a complex web of ideas and styles that offer rich rewards on repeat listening. Excursions to Haiti and Jamaica have obviously influenced the music, and explorations of Kirkegaard and the Orpheus myth have found their way into the material as well. Like the Suburbs, Reflektor ventures into profound existential topics with remarkable ease, working its magic on the listener on a subliminal level. I find myself having dreams about these songs. When was the last time you could say that about an album? As always, the band has crafted beautiful tuneful anthems with delightful riffs and hooks that will keep you humming and tapping as you contemplate the weightier issues the songs introduce. Although not an instant classic, it will certainly be one of the most important albums of the year.
B00F5PS5P2|5.0|Heard this group on &#34;The Adventure Club&#34; on 102.1 The Edge. Wrote the song down (I think &#34;Gun&#34;) to follow up with later.. Went on Amazon and listened to the snippets of each song and they were really good.  The whole CD is even better.<br /><br />If you like any of the songs on the &#34;preview&#34;; buy the CD.  The lead singer has a beautiful voice, the electronica is catchy and fresh, it's fun to listen to and you'll do it over and over.<br /><br />Get the Special Edition (if you're okay with a few songs with F-bombs). The bonus tracks are great.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun game. In each level you must figure out what to pick up and where to use it.
B0093QHWLC|4.0|I liked the movie. I think the fact that many other people like it, besides the cast, is that the stories in the movie can relate to real life.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it, can't put the game down. So glad that you finally offered the game for the Kindle. I have had the game on my computer for some time and on my iphone, but in the evenings I spend a lot of time on my Kindle.
B000063DGC|5.0|This album came out in March 1987,  and up until that point,  I had never heard Randy play live before,  and I was in complete shock,  it was SO good.  Everything he played had purpose,  he really meant business when he played.<br /><br />Also,  at the time I was just learning how to play guitar myself,  and this album,  hands down no question about it,  was my main study for well over a year.  I cant tell you how many hundreds of hours I spent playing along to this album.  I was just really into it!!<br /><br />So in closing,  there are a few live recordings of Randy,  but this one is one of the best.  His playing is incredible,  the quality of the recording is really sharp,  we are all very fortunate to have this recording.  And as Ozzy said in the album 'I know his playing will continue to inspire you all'<br /><br />It certainly inspired me!!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|The movie arrived quickly and the film was fantastic.  I had seen it in the theater but was happy to have it in my home to watch again.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|SPOILER ALERT*****<br />What could make this better? Try not to kill your main protagonist off BEFORE the book ends, that would probably help. I have no problem with a main character dying, but come on! Her death got like half a page of our time; she gets shot and BOOM she's dead.<br />That being said, I still liked the book overall. The plot (while sketchy at times) did fit with the rest of the series (minus Tris dying). It was engaging and fun to read. I was connected with the characters. Solid book with a slight literary flaw.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|I read the first to books in January as I recuperated from surgery.  I couldn't wait for the 3rd one to come out.  I even remember when the cover was released.  I found this one pretty flat and anticlimactic.  I'll agree w/everyone else that I didn't care for the ending.  I don't believe in spoiler so I will say no more on that topic.  I found itm hard to follow b/c of it jumping from person to person.  If I had to putt he book down mid chapter when I came back I was occasionally confused about from who's perspective was I reading.  Glad there were a couple of surprises but they weren't big enough to get me beyond 3 stars.

B008JFUNNM|5.0|Captain Phillips, (2013). A biographical  and action/adventure flick, this is the true story of Captain Richard Phillips and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama, the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years.  It is based upon the book A CAPTAINS DUTY: SOMALI PIRATES, NAVY SEALS, AND DANGEROUS DAYS AT SEA by Richard Phillips.  Screenplay was by Billy Ray; direction by British Paul Greengrass, acclaimed master of suspense, when logically there should be none, see UNITED  93, the Bourne films.<br /><br />To quote Sony Pictures Entertainment, the releasing studio, as reprinted at IMDb:<br /><br />Captain Phillips is a multi-layered examination of the 2009 hijacking of the U.S. container ship Maersk Alabama by a crew of Somali pirates. It is - through director Paul Greengrass's distinctive lens - simultaneously a pulse-pounding thriller, and a complex portrait of the myriad effects of globalization. The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips (two time Academy Award®-winner Tom Hanks), and the Somali pirate captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who takes him hostage. Phillips and Muse are set on an unstoppable collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips' unarmed ship; in the ensuing standoff, 145 miles off the Somali coast, both men will find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control.<br /><br />Hanks ably carries the picture  in another Oscar-worthy performance.  Bdi, portraying Muse, powerfully balances Hanks.  Catherine Keener is featured in a small part as Andrea Phillips, the Captain’s wife.  The movie  is 134 minutes of pure, heart-stopping suspense.  Though, logically speaking, we know that Phillips survived.  Also, logically speaking, we know that this handful of pirates as portrayed, half-dressed, probably hardly half-fed and educated, stoned on “khat,” and probably no better off than their pirate ancestors of centuries ago, who inspired the line “the shores of Tripoli,” in the U.S. Marine anthem, cannot possibly prevail against the might of the twenty-first century U.S. Navy.  Which has clearly spent millions of dollars in men and materiel to ensure that the captain is freed.  Nevertheless, the film left me limp.  A masterful overwhelming thriller.o, who inspired the line “the shores of Tripoli,” in the U.S. Marine anthem, cannot possibly prevail against the might of the twenty-first century U.S. Navy.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Have been wanting to play n finally can with this app. Have no problems with the performance. Its a basic game of matching with challenging levels. Very colorful and you might find yourself craving candy. Easy to send and receive help with Facebook friends. And the app is free and free lives are given generously.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Very engaging and addicting game. I loved playing this game and will go back to play again and even get new ones like this. Once you get the hang of it you start to think &quot;oh! This is easy&quot; so then you go up a difficulty and realize how wrong you were but its still fun! Its like minesweeper meets soduku. Lots of fun, try it!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game because it fun to and I also love candy and my sister has this game on her phone and kendle fire hd.
B002RI9ZUE|4.0|This book was recommended to me and I did enjoy it.<br />I felt at times the story was a little dated but I enjoyed the writing style & could relate to the main character.<br />Enjoyable read but not unputdownable!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Strategery and wizardry are required<br />Dig it<br />Watch out for the weapon talismans...<br />The Pork Side<br />Ain't So Bad Sometimes
B00B22ASUM|4.0|I loved the story. I thought it was well written and entertaining. My only complaint is that the storyline about the progression off of Methadone seemed unbelievable. As a Registered Nurse, if this is what he went through when solely coming off the weaned Methadone, I think they did something wrong. His description is one of a complete heroin addict going cold turkey, not of a planned withdrawal from an experienced medical center. I do hope he does well. I loved his match with Bob! Bob is amazing. He is one of a kind. I once had a cat I loved like that. I now have one who does as she pleases, and you never know what you have until after you have already fallen in love w/ them! Good luck to James and to Bob.
B00004CYVZ|1.0|This was the UK copy of the DVD and I wanted US... That was not made clear in the title or description.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Watching the TV show &#34;Castle&#34; helped to make the characters comes alive.  I would recommend this and his other &#34;Heat&#34; books.
B001AMNL2Q|2.0|Not enough action,long drawn out random bits and pieces.Needed more actual footage with real acounts of thhhe human sufferage.<br />The costs of series just isnt worth it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE this game! I play it every single day.....I think I may be addicted..LOL. I would suggest, and do suggest ppl to download candy crush all the time....it's a FANTASTIC game:-)...
B000FC130E|5.0|If you have seen the BBC production of Neverwhere, you know the general story: Richard Mayhew comes to the aid of a young woman being threatened by thugs and thus triggers a series of events that take him to an alternate London -- a London of monsters  and magic.  Door is a young noble woman whose family has been massacred and who finds herself the target of a pair of hulking, efficient assassins.  Richard saves her but doing so means he ceases to exist in this world. No one sees him, his ATM is ignored by the ATM machine and the only way back seems to be by following Door into this strange, mythical London.<br /><br />Lyrical and well-crafted, Gaiman capably tells this fantasy yarn with skill and good humor.  We come to care for the characters that Mayhew meets during his Arthurian adventure. This is a great story.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|This film has a somewhat predictable plot with a little surprise twist at the end. Julianne Hough is nice to look at.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Surprisedly good series. It feels more like a movie when we watch each episode since they last 1.5hrs.<br /><br />The show does remind me if House MD with the use of CGI to illustrate sherlocks thinking process.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|Highly rated show deserves every ounce of its ratings.  Now that Breaking Bad is over, this show moves to Number 1, followed by Scandal.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|fantastic book - could not put it down. captivating storyline - fascinating and a challenging book - a must read.
B004JMY312|3.0|My 8 and 10 y/o watched this and seemed to enjoy it. There is no stellar acting or plot, but for a Halloween movie, at least enjoyable.
0062267787|5.0|Lauren Oliver books is everything you what to read.  The Delirium series  is interesting, quick and easy reads with missing any detail about the character or the story.
1583334386|5.0|Kelly McGonigal's work is very useful material and I have benefitted from it. She presents the scientific basis and then has exercises to support that knowledge. I like hearing what current science thinks they have proven, often it is what anecdotal information, or direct experience, has indicated but which scientists have not believed until they could invent the machine to see it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for making candy crush saga available on the Kindle! Great game, always challenging, never boring, and definitely addicting!
B00F57VFXO|4.0|Oh man. Damian Stevenson is one of those guys that will make any would-be author of historical novels want to write something else. He is that good. He has carved another spellbinding story from the pages of history with The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Parsifal (An Espionage Thriller) that will take you on a journey so believable you will want to go again and again. You need not be a fan of Ian Fleming to like Damian's work (although it helps), just a fan of good, descriptive writing. Damian delivers in bucketloads. Recommended.
B00BTV62KG|5.0|If it says John Scofield on it, I'll buy it! Sco has had ups and downs but has never disappointed over the last 20 years I have been following him. Always manages to assemble another new band and produce great sound, performance and music. Bortnick and Medeski rock as always..
B00005O3VC|5.0|This movie is so damn good everything else pales into insignificence (and plenty of everything is still pretty darn good). The biggest shame is that the world has become so politically correct (BOOOOO!!!!!) we may never see its like again. Go you good Python thing!!!
B00873GRU4|4.0|Hard to put down!  Very clever idea and we'll written- I find myself reading in the middle of the night.
0316228532|1.0|I agree wholeheartedly with another reviewer who called it \\"500 pages of relentless socialist manifesto masquerading as literature crammed down your throat.\\"  JK Rowling's attempt to parlay her Harry Potter fantasies into success in the Adult World of reality simply doesn't jell.  The book is chock full of tired socialist cliches, depressing selfishness and an overwhelming ignorance and despicable loathing which she wantonly attempts to portray as an indictment against the hard working and at times selfless middle class folk.  It is basically an insult to ones intelligence - JK Rowling should return to her fantasy World of Wizards and Magic Spells.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|While there are far worse headphones out there I have to say after years of use I've had all the same problems with these headphones as I did on day one. They over all work well and it's nice that the sound can be split between chat and game.<br /><br />The main problem is that they have a constant humming. Once you get going into a game it mostly fades away but it's pretty bad and hard to overlook. The other one is smaller, but it's a bulky thing with tons of cords, and it's impossible to put anywhere without the cords tangling with something else, or itself.<br /><br />If you're willing to spend the money to get this headset, chances are you can do better in the same price range.
0316174483|5.0|This book is so cute and makes fingerprint drawing SO easy!!  You could also use it to learn to draw basic animals and people because everything stems from the fingerprint round shape.  Its dual useful!
B000RLHDUM|5.0|One of my favorite movies, I never get tired of watching.  Well made and the cast is wonderful.  A romantic thriller with a neat ednding.
B00F1CRSKM|5.0|I am a unabashed Arcade Fire fan. Yet this record manages to surprise and delight me at every turn. I won't delve into each song but I will confirm your suspicions. Assuming your suspicions are that Arcade Fire are still one of the most important bands in the game today.
B00CWKLE7E|2.0|The DVD was scratched and skipped,  I had to buy several cleaners and polishes to remove the scratches it finally stopped skipping during the movie. It was used but they said it was never played.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|What a waste of time! This book ruined the whole series.  The first two books were so good I could hardly wait to read the last one. However, Allegiant was a big disappointment.  The plot had lots of holes in it; the dual character voices were too similar, I kept checking to see whether it was Tris or Four, and the ending was so senseless and meaningless, it needed a rewrite. Actually, the whole book needs a rewrite.
B00G32OMF8|3.0|Interesting dialogue, but too much of it. Better suited for a play than a movie. I stayed to the end, but glad it was over. .
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Been looking for this since I saw it on Showtime  as I wanted my friends who didn't have Showtime to see it. Tells the good, the bad , and the UGLY of their history both in the early days and currently
B003X27L9U|4.0|Room was definitely a good read.  It was interesting, unique, and terrifying to think that these things actually happen.  The story is told in first person narration from the point of view of a five-year-old boy named Jack.  I found it a bit difficult to read at first due to the fact that it was told from a child's perspective.  Well, not difficult per se, just different and caused me to read a bit slower than normal at first.  But, like any book with a different writing style, you get used to it and are able to enjoy the story.  And in this case, come to appreciate the writing.<br /><br />Donoghue did a great job with Jack's voice.  He definitely talks and thinks how a little kid would.  But she did it in a way that it's not painful or annoying to read.  It's quite enjoyable.<br /><br />It's interesting thinking about all the things Jack wouldn't be familiar with or know about or understand.  He's never been outside of that room, never experienced normal life.  I thought that Donoghue did a good job of realizing all the things Jack wouldn't get, even the less obvious ones.  I found myself forgetting until Jack would be confused by something so simple.  I think this story would be very difficult to write for that reason, let alone the narration.<br /><br />I have many other thoughts on the story, but I don't want to say any of them due to spoilers.  So, I think I'll just end my review here and you'll just have to read it yourself!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing this game. I can't always get it the first time, but it is fun to play!!!!! I play it everyday
B00EQF2EIG|5.0|This movie is the best adaptation of &#34;Much Ado&#34; I've seen!  It's a modern take while staying true to the Bard.  Joss Whedon is a true genius so I expected it to be great .....and it was.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I bought this book because of title.  I've never bought a book by This author.  I enjoyed it very much.
B002VLNHZQ|3.0|Never Eat Alone<br />Author: Keith Ferrazzi<br />Pros: powerful concepts, concrete examples, sets up a good networking framework<br />Cons: egocentric, some suggestions are over the top<br /><br />I have a good friend who lives by this book. Keith is a master networker and he opens up and shares his experiences and knowledge with the world. Many of these experiences are insightful and illustrate the principles Keith is teaching. However Keith also enjoys showing off and some passages end up focused on his accomplishment rather than networking principles. Keith also focuses on concrete suggestions of ways to build personal networks. Many of which focus on ways to put yourself out there. Some are a little over the top. Many could easily lead a person becoming annoying and in my opinion may in fact hurt the networker.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed this book. Keith illustrates the importance of building a strong personal and business network. The principle he teaches about becoming a facilitator in your network was particularly helpful to me. I felt that Keith effectively gave me the basic principles that I needed to understand to build my network. It was also an entertaining read, which is always appreciated - it doesn't read like a textbook. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants guidance on building their network. I would suggest to internalize the principles, but to be a little more skeptical about the specific suggestions.
1451666179|5.0|I had incredibly high expectations for this book. It managed to exceed them in every capacity. The book is longer and more colorful than I expected (I ordered the paperback version.) Every story has different colored paper for the background, making the pages look like a stack of delicious gummy candy. (I do not suggest eating the book however.) It's a small detail, but I think adds to the overall package and is worth mentioning.<br /><br />The real reason you bought this book is of course for Allie's hilarious writing and art. The reprints, which do not consist of the majority of the content, are as poignant and funny as ever, and it was a joy to see them again. All the new content is just as high quality as the writing and art from her blog (if not better), and translate wonderfully to the written format. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
159463176X|5.0|Excellent novel - every bit as good as his first two books, The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.  I highly recommend all three to everyone!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I used to play it on my computer because amazon didn't have it.... but now I play it on my kindle fire all the time!!!!! favorite game of all time!!!
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|A great scary movie - like the kind that used to frighten you out of your pants.  Not blood and gore, just good, old-fashioned, psychological chills - see it!!
B001NLL93W|5.0|This one I think was the best in the series. It was so full of action and I loved the ending. Poor clary they keep smashing her life but good thing she is strong :)
B000EHRVP6|5.0|Sick and demented but an intriguing story.  Made me cringe, which is exactly what I look for from this genre.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|Different premise than the first two. Brings some things back around from the first movie, which is neat. But, overall not as good.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Not much to say, I just love Allie's brutal, humorous, unvarnished honesty.  So many people try to sugar coat themselves, and it can make it awful hard to identify with them at times...  Not this, Allie just comes across as herself and gives voice to the deep insecurities we all feel.  Frankly, it helps me feel normal :).<br /><br />It's a good book, buy it already.
B001O7Y9ZU|5.0|Just awesome the way it's put together. It is a masterful classic! The instrumentals are superb, especially the guitar solos, and Phil just brings it all together with his great voice! I highly recommend this song to everyone!
B00AECGQF2|3.0|This is a fun styling app. I gave it only 3 stars because I would have liked more customers. I also feel the hair growth feature needs tweaking.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Although well written, a saw an old movie with the same basic plot. Just not a new idea. I know I've read better Grisham.
B0063IH60K|4.0|want ad free version would pay. spoils you when you get to auto at end. would also like to customize card backs
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Thankyou for this delightful story. It kept me entertained from beginning to end. Appeals to the child in us all.
B008JFUR10|5.0|I love monster movies. Ever since I was a child, I used to watch the old TNT monster movie marathons even if it was the old black and white movies. So when I heard about this movie it was a must see for me and I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B008Y70TMK|5.0|if you've somehow never seen Ghostbusters, every second you spend reading this review is a second wasted that you should be spending watching Ghostbusters.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|like a previous player I tried, this one did not work either. It was a complete waste of time and I do not recommend it.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Denise Grover Swank will \\"wow\\" you in this book! Mystery, romance, humor and enough twists and turns to keep you wanting more.  Good luck trying to set this book down once you have started reading it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Especially the scene at the end of the credits. It had a lot of heart and friendship in it.
B0098460O4|4.0|They are a lovely duet and I enjoy them singing together. However,  I REALLY REALLY REALLY wish Jonathan would do a solo album.  He doesn't need to break up his pairing so hold the hate mail.  I was just listening to Pavarotti and I have to say that I think Jonathan is on par.  This guy is by far the best singer I have ever heard...ever.  I like the album b/c of him. I dislike the album b/c her voice isn't on par.  Sorry, but I'm being honest. Her voice complements his voice but sometimes her voice is unnecessary.  I don't dislike them as a duo or friends or anything else so again, hold the hate mail. She has a fantastic voice but NOBODY can be on par with his voice.  I just think a voice like that needs to stand alone at least part of the time.  This album with her on 1/2 of the songs would get 10 stars.
B0014YPEI4|5.0|I have enjoyed dinosaurs since I was a small child. And I really enjoyed this rendition of the Allosaurus. It is very life like and the detail is amazing! A must for an dino enthusiast.
0847842134|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book.....the highly textured (toothed) paper is TOTALLY WRONG for detail...the small language print is nearly illegible.... and as I'm not the first to coment a fairly large sticker is placed on the back cover that damages the cover if removed. All in all very disappointing - I returned it.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I have had a lot of fun playing this on my kindle. However i do not like that it tries to force you to spend real money to get new and awesome looking dinos. Also that if you have several &#34;quests&#34; that ask for the same thing, it will not clear if you do the requested action once, for all of the quests, instead it makes you do the requested action as many times as you have quests for it, which can be frustrating. And sometimes it does not registered that you have done or even completed an action thus forcing you to do it again to clear the quest. It is fun to pass time, but I seriously frown on the real currency spending aspect.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved the Fellowship of the Ring trilogy and the Hobbit was awesome! I can't wait to see the Desolation of Smaug!
B0012SCHZK|3.0|I bought this at first thinking it was only 5 or 6 dollars, turned out to be almost double that. Its not the greatest movie but it did help pass the time when our power went out recently!
B008ER9QKG|5.0|Although most of my listening of music an opera is from CD, I have read very good reviews about this DVD set, that I decided to buy it, particularly since it is conducted by Jimmy Levine, perhaps one of the greatest Wagner conductors still on the podium. We must realize that any intelligent review of the ring will take many, many pages and take much time to write. So I will spare you, so go buy it, you will be glad that you listened to me.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I grew up watching Star Trek. Although it was the next generation series at the time, i still watched the original series as well so I have really enjoyed the reboot of this franchise with the original series characters.
B00C5R8364|2.0|Too complex.  Could not really get into book for awhile.  More non fiction then fiction, which I do not prefer to read
B008D37J6O|1.0|this player would not play my videos. very disappointed and a complete waste of time. I do not recommend it at all.
1451666179|4.0|I received my copy of this book 2 days ago and was very excited to crack it open. the content was wonderful!  hilarious, poignant, relatable, and dare I say inspiring at times. my only complaint is that it was slightly undercooked, making it rather chewy and difficult to eat. also was a little under-salted but thats just personal preference.
B00DJUPLY8|2.0|I do not know why but every time I watch a video using this player I must restart my kindle in order to watch another video as it will not play and gives me a loading error. Really disappointed, but I have yet to find another player that will play a video from the cloud automatically without me having to first download the video.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad that candy crush is now on Kindle the only problem is now I play too often.
B00G32OMF8|3.0|Mostly dialogue...a bit tedious, especially the lead female role. It was hard to identify with her petty complaints. I wouldn't watch it twice.
B005LAIIN0|1.0|Zombies and more zombies, and more zombies! Brad Pitt's acting is OK but not great.  Plot is awful. We didn't like this movie.
B00F8MIIKO|4.0|This was a very cute movie, which is why I give it four stars. It is hard to create a prequel when we know how the movie will end, but they did a pretty good job of making it a little unpredictable. I didn't give 5 stars because it is not a movie I will watch multiple times (as with some of the Pixar movies), but I enjoyed the story.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|We don't have Showtime, so we purchased the complete seasons 1 & 2. We can't wait until the third season is released.  We love Homeland.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Very good, exactly in the condition they said it would be.<br />We watch this movie several times every Christmas,<br />is a tradition at our house. Needed to update from VHS to DVD.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. I always can't wait to get to the next level. I get to relax and play on my commute.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love this game it has customizable robots and lots of fun fights. The game is very addicting but it's fun and good for kids. I would recommend this game to any one.  Hope you like the same way I did.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|When I started playing this I couldn't put my kindle fire down. Once you defeat every level you just want to keep going and get more skill points. If you love strategy then I think this is the game for you.
B0035LMTZA|1.0|Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron have zero chemistry together on screen, all the dialogue is dumb, and the caper unfolds in lame, by-the-numbers style until it's time for the crazy car chases. The Michael Caine movie of the same title (this movie shows a character watching a snippet of that movie on TV) is light years better.
B00CRW2066|5.0|Almost every song is good.  I love albums where you can just hit play and not have to worry about skipping over all the crappy songs.  This is one of those albums.
B000WC39SG|5.0|A classic WWII movie with an all star cast. A great war movie for its time. Try not to compare war movies from the '70's and '80's to Saving Private Ryan, etc. A Bridge too Far (ABTF) tells the story of Operation Market Garden above and beyond other Hollywood war films from the '70's. Very good attention to detail from every point of view (US, English, German, etc). A must have film for every war/history/WWII library. And, in HB, it is like a whole new movie!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another one by Grisham that keeps you turning the pages. Definitely  must read, especially if you've read \\"A Time to Kill.\\" I recommend this book to anyone.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|just love the female equivalent of Celtic Thunder, having all the Celtic Thunder Dvd's, all the girls are great and the production quality is brilliant.
B004JMY312|5.0|Who cannot resist Bette Midlers large red hair, Kathy Najimy's crooked mouth, and Sarah Jessica Parker's unbelievable obliviousness? This is the film for this time of year. No matter how old I get it will always be number one.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|The new lassie, really adds to the feel of the whole music, and the girls seem to appreciate each other's company and talent, and it shows.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It is a good book to read if u are bored and it is so entertaining that u can read it over and over again
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Dying to Be Me is one of the most interesting books I have ever read.  It is interesting to the point of being fascinating, well written, inspirational, and I believe divinely inspired.  I'm going to give it to my loved ones this Christmas.  I can't think of a better present than this excellent book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a really good game and REALLY addicting!!!  I would recommend it for ages 6 and up because it is quite difficult
B00C1B28Y2|5.0|This is one of the best figures I have ever seen/purchased for Dragon Ball Z, the detail is amazing, it looks like they cut him right from the show.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great read. Incredibly fleshed out characters and interesting premise that leads the reader wanting more, while giving us just enough to keep things mysterious. You end up rooting for the characters in a way that is rare in modern fiction.
B00170GXQ2|5.0|This is a classic horror movie that I enjoy watching every Halloween. Great actors! Gary Oldman is excellent as Dracula. It's a must see for sure!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is my favorite game.  It seems that most of my friends are playing it.  I guess it really is addictive!  I play on both my tablet and android phone.
B0014JKJK2|1.0|These are fakes! When these fell apart way too quick, I bought real ones from the crocs website and compared and these are clearly fake! Waste of money!
B0053O89KG|5.0|As with the rest of the seasons, loving it.  Good chemistry. Husband is a fan, converted wife to be a fan too.
B00DVT54RQ|4.0|record sounds great, but do not expect any extras in the packaging. There is none, just the jacket and a black sleeve
B008469DGY|2.0|This is real crap of a apt..  It was good that it was free..  Just no interest in the thing
0486448843|3.0|The artworks on these cards are reproduced very well and look beautiful. The artwork side is glossy and lovely, however, the paper side is  made of stock so very thin and flimsy, it bleeds quite heavily when one is using a fountain or dip pen to write on. I wouldn't send any of these to an international address, they may very well survive but would probably be foxed around the edges or even torn.
6305428042|5.0|Riding on a wave of nostalgia, I bought this movie last week and watched it over the weekend. I don't think I'd seen it since its original release date 20 years ago (oddly, in the summer). Hocus Pocus is the perfect Halloween movie because the story is fun and campy, while still having just the perfect amount of spookiness. Plus, there is a musical number performed by the Divine Miss M -- what's not to love?!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Nice jumping and running game with cool bosses and places whoever put a 1 star are idiots it's cool guys real cool
B003G4W49C|5.0|Awesome book, and I finished it just in time.  The movie comes out in two days. Can't wait to see it.
B005J2UM9S|1.0|Honestly, awful acting.  Awful.<br /><br />This might be a great movie for when you're hanging out with your friends and want one of those horror flicks that gets everyone giggling.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Wanted some easy reading in English language but this one is bit too easy- characters are too shallow (one may say stupid). So many things are repeated (some length was needed to publish ?) and the used vocabulary corresponds to pre-school kid. I think that even kid stories should be written properly.
B00AALHW6Y|4.0|There are a number of very good songs on this CD...especially &#34;Wagon Wheel&#34;.  It is well worth the price I paid.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|It's a great series with interesting characters and fabulous costumes! A window into an era of war and changing alliances. Fascinating!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|You won't be disappointed with this app. , Easy to use I like the way it wakes me up in the morning. I think it does everything I need it to.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|It's hard to catch your breath while watching this one! There is almost non-stop action, broken up by comedic breaks or dramatic moments. The best aspect being how these new movies tie to the old ones in a way that makes you want to go back and watch them again, just to be able to understand this one better!
B0071NOU78|4.0|Great for the grandkids around 10 years old but not the collectors item I was looking for the Star Wars collector.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush saga l play every day and night  and on my lunch break , before I go to bed  and all weekend .
B007G92QGO|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and wished it was longer. There were many surprises and shocks and I loved the way it was written.
B00CHS31DG|4.0|I really dont beleive that this app is in any way shape or form, the real mccoy... just have fun wtih it.  Its entertainment...
B00E1LQ7Q0|5.0|Justin Timberlake has always been one of my favorite artists.  I already loved the songs that he put out from disk one and was happy to hear that he had enough material to do another one.  I was so excited that I preordered the package.  He definitely did not disappoint me with this compilation!
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|It WAS as bad as they say it is. Bad acting, the whole works. It was all true. Dont bother, even out of curiosity.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|...for those who have come to the point in life (which can be anytime) when rational thought<br />replaces wishful thinking.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|My daughter loves this app to unwind by in the evening after homework and before bedtime. I love the soothing sounds when I check in on her at night or awaken her in the morning. The sounds are lovely.
B00F2362IE|5.0|When I found this app I thought it would be a good app because I love teenage mutant ninja turtles. And when I played it. It was the best app I've ever played.
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|Great read and very interesting.  The ending, however, left me unfulfilled and wanting more...  But the journey was definitely worthwhile. : D

1582701709|5.0|Words are not enough to thank my favourite author Rhonda Byrne, who secretly changed my life and brought abundance of happiness and peace to it. This book is in extraordinary piece of ART, creation that brought magic to our lives.<br />For one instance, when I started reading this book two years back, I convinced myself that this will never going to happen to me. I met so many friends and reader, who were followers or I must say Believers of SECRET. Until the time came, when my emotional wreck and personal life started push me to decide something important in my life. Seriously, SECRET helped me out.<br />This law of attraction transcended the sadness to my happiness. The revival was phenomenal and my mother and my best friend, who believed and practiced secret teachings, actually rescued me from a disaster.<br />This book may be written by a human, but its divinity has no doubts. The teachings, the experiences, the constant realization takes the human energy, feelings and desires to the next level.<br />I learnt from this book that It doesn't matter what draws your attention, God, universes, law of attraction, but it does matter that you fill your heart, body, mind, soul with positive waves of energy that transform your life just the way you imagined!<br />The key is to be patient and consistent. I hope and wish this secret is revealed to more and more people for good.<br />Thank you Rhonda, for this wonderful book!
B003U6BE8I|4.0|I watched this with my kids... it was okay entertaining at least but thought it lacked depth.  However I never read the books
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I finished my book today! Totally love this piece by Mr Hossieni. This one was very different from Kite runner! I could actually visualize the times from 1952 till the dramatic meeting of Pari and `Abollah'. I think he did justice to his book. Regardless of the fact that I had lost track at Markos story, which prolonged the intertwined stories and was a distraction.<br />However, it brought grief, love, and sense of getting back to something you lost long time back. Very emotional and loved it may be for that very reason. The inspiration taken from William Blake's work added element of drama and nostalgic moments.  Khaled Sahib, you always surprise us with your work! Thanks for sharing this book.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Catching up with Bridget was a lovely experience. Initially a little difficult to get used to the change in circumstances, it settled out and was great fun as the author catches all the real - life thoughts that are exactly what one would think. How many others would share that the minute one's screenplay is optioned the next step is planning the Oscar outfit? Thanks for a great read!
B009KHCT94|4.0|I watched this on my laptop and the special effects and sets looked fine - better than I was expecting.  This was satire and criticism of human nature delivered in a humorous science fiction frame.  A reasonable criticism of USA actions and motivations as seen by others, along with poking some fun at other nations - particularly the ruling classes.  I thought the script moved along briskly, funny in a Dr. Strangelove kind of way but not at that level of masterpiece.  A good B movie.  Be sure to look for the nuclear war taking place in the background of the end credits.  If you liked the movie Independence Day, then I do not think you will like this.  If you don't think US foreign policy is overly militaristic and motivated by economic factors and political propaganda, then you probably won't like this film.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is easy to use.<br />Being in my Kindle makes it so accessible.<br />Large keys makes it easy to use.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I finally gave in and downloaded this game to my Kindle Fire.  I knew I had enough self-discipline to act responsibly. Um......wrong. I play and play and play and........

B0054PSY2W|5.0|great movie with George Clooney doing a great job. The movie has some wonderful music for a soundtrack.  I bought it because it's one of those movies I like to watch about once a year
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is an interesting solitaire game.<br />It takes some thinking but plays fairly<br />quickly.<br />It is a rather addictive game.
B000IZAHB4|4.0|this is a good horror movie! its not incredibly horrifying, bloody, or deep, but it has something that a lot of modern horror movies lack, and thats originality. Even if its only a small ammount. I do not think anyone would put it up there with the Shining or The Fly, but it's a fun watch.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Love this show. I have added season four to my collection. This show makes me laugh and can always use a good laugh.

B001BANK32|5.0|Stephen King's The Shining<br /><br />I thought I was familiar with this story when I watched the Jack Nicholson film many years ago, but I was totally wrong!<br /><br />The book is about Danny, which the Kubrick film (although well-made) completely misses.  Danny is the most powerful psychic in these parts and the kid broadcasts out like crazy.  He can read minds but still has a little kid's attitude and does not have the maturity to handle such a gift (or curse?).<br /><br />Jack was a teacher but also loved binge drinking with his buddy Al.  One day they ran into a bike on the road.  No person on it, just a bike.  They both have an epiphany that they need to go cold turkey.  How the bike arrived there is not explained, but is probably something Danny put there?<br /><br />Fascinating workings of Jack's mind throughout - his alcoholism, his fits of violence, and a few pages devoted to his father who, like Jack, did some pretty damaging things to his family.<br /><br />The Overlook is a summer resort hotel with a mysterious past.  Jack gets a job there as a caretaker and finds that the previous one killed his family and then himself.  Not gonna happen to him though.  OK!<br /><br />And Wendy, which character seems very weak-willed and only turns on the guns when her motherly instincts turn on.  The story is grerat when I have to yell at the book for Wendy to not go into the hall!  And how can she carry a knife and not use it while Jacks beats on her?<br /><br />History and Hysteria<br /><br />Loved the Overlook's mysterious parts - the woman in the bathtub, the 70 years of haunts floating through the halls, the mysterious barkeep who fuels up Jack into fits of rage and to prove Jack is in fact managerial material.<br /><br />Finally King's black cook, Dick Hallorann, a man who shines but not nearly as much as Danny.  Disappointing as I was hoping for a white horse riding in and saving the day.  They were lucky to get away with their lives.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />Horror, when done right, is fast-paced and takes your breath away.  King does this in spades.<br /><br />Can't wait for Doctor Sleep!r /><br />Horror, when done right, is fast-paced and takes your breath away.

B005ZB91KY|3.0|Just OK...... spend some times. If u have any other choice, its not a recommand. take a look, and let it go.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Cute little game to pass the time. I don't have it connected to a social media site, so it uses up quite a few of my gems so that is a downer. How will I ever afford Princess Celestias Castle???
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE Candy Crush! Sometimes it's not convenient to play it on FB, and the app on my Droid locks up. This app on my Kindle never locks up. Thank you for finally bringing this game to Kindle! I've been playing for at least a week without a single problem. I'm so happy! I've got to get back to crushing candy!

B00CHVJODE|5.0|The Croods is a good movie all around. It is family friendly and funny. It is a must see for everyone.
B0002QXSMY|5.0|Bj&ouml;rk's third effort, Homogenic, reflected a fury previously unseen in her.  Strained relationships and difficulties with the media in the aftermath of her stalker's suicide caused her to hole herself up in a house to write songs, taking breaks only to cook meals for herself and her producer.  The result was a rare instance of perfection.  If this is not the best electronic album of all time, it is certainly the best one of the 90s.  Bj&ouml;rk holds nothing back here, and from the haunting album cover to the plaintive cries of &#34;Pluto&#34;, it's easy to see why.<br /><br />Track ratings:<br /><br />Hunter - 10/10<br />J&oacute;ga - 11/10 - The best track of 1997.<br />Unravel - 10/10<br />Bachelorette - 10.5/10 - The 2nd best track of 1997.<br />All Neon Like - 10/10<br />5 Years - 10/10<br />Immature - 10/10<br />Alarm Call - 10/10<br />Pluto - 10/10<br />All Is Full Of Love - 10/10<br /><br />Overall grade: 10.15/10 - Above perfection:  5.08 stars.
B007Q0K9ZI|5.0|Just love his music.  We heard some of the numbers on this disk in a live performance this spring 2013 in Sacramento, CA.  Fun to see it performed again.  Fantastic sets that his group creates--they add to the enjoyment of the music.
B000H305U0|4.0|Getting ready to see him in concert in February and thought it would be fun to listen to his hits.  Good purchase!
143353083X|4.0|For the purpose of this review, I will focus on the study material and not the translation (which I am a huge fan of).<br /><br />The study material covered in the ESV Study Bible is really pretty good.  The content prior to each book will tell you just about anything you might want to know about the book (I was surprised at the depth, and found it really informative), and gives great summary and outline sections to help you get the big picture.<br /><br />The commentary is pretty well done (you can't expect it to be exactly what you want), and is generally in depth enough to provide what you would expect in a study Bible's commentary (no study Bible will reach the depth of a stand alone commentary simply because of size).  My only complaint is that it often doesn't speak at all on passages that I found I would have liked more information on, and I found myself googling often to fill in those blanks.  I realize there is a balance between thickness of the book and content covered, but I did often find myself wondering why they invested so many words on relatively unimportant explanations and missed areas that might be convicting or difficult to swallow.  It seemed that it often avoided entirely areas that God does something we might consider hard to understand... and areas like these should really be spoken to (this would be a good time to speak to the sovereignty of God or humanistic standards of justice, which a lot of people struggle to understand).<br /><br />Overall, no study Bible is perfect, nor will any fulfill everything you personally might want, but this one has a great wealth of knowledge and thoughts to digest.  It will certainly help build up any believer and bring better understanding to the Word.<br /><br />I would recommend purchase.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|The movie was an entertaining movie that reminded me a little of Men in Black.  Overall- it was a good movie.
B00DURHYWC|4.0|Don't know what the mixed reviews I'd see previously were about , this is another great bunch of songs from this super group of musicians - always interesting interpretations and a wonderful variety of songs - never get tired listening to them.
0385535147|5.0|This is a Xmas present for my husband and he has not read it yet.  He loves this author. Thanks.
B002VWNIDG|5.0|i enjoyed the movie very much, i enjoyed having this classic movie to my collection. Nicholson in one of my fav roles.
B0051XQI84|4.0|Great fun. Good for the whole family. No surprises but an enjoyable trip to the finale. I recommend it totally.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|I wish there were more options besides print. I needed to print something that landed up being 76 pages. It would be nice to be able to print only certain pages or double sided pages.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I already bought this once for 2 of my granddaughters (ages 3 & 7) and they went nuts over this movie.  So this one is a Christmas gift for 2 more granddaughters (ages 5 & 8).  I am sure they will be singing the songs and dancing like they do in the movie.  I cannot wait!
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Gladstone's examination of how adversity can be turned from a weakness to a strength is at once enlightening and entertaining! Of course, Gladwell fans will not expect a dry academic tone; his goal is not to break new ground and present quantitative evidence for his thesis, his goal is to inform in an entertaining way. You may not be covinced by his theories, but you will surely be entertained and enlightened. I found it not as strong as his earlier efforts, so i did feel compelled to go with four stars.
0385336950|2.0|I bought this thinking it was the non-movie cover of the story made into a movie. wRONG! It may be a good read... I gave it as a gift. It wasn't what I had wanted.
B00AG6Z92C|2.0|I don't care for his performance of more contemporary music, & I don't think he does either.<br />Thats just me.
0374214913|4.0|This book has a little bit of a lot; it has humor, philosophy, a good plot, fun realistic characters, a happy but not hokey ending...<br /><br />The reviews and descriptions of this book made me very curious to read it. It has a fine sense of humor, along the lines of good Christopher Moore writing or Douglas Adams, but more subtle.  it was a fun adventure that kept me interested. novel concept to write about. it was not deep or earth shattering... No classical literature here. But a fun summer read or good mind candy for a modern techie.
B00EPFEY44|2.0|I just don't like his performance of :popular music&#34; , his &#34;classical &#34; fits his range and personal enjoyment  as is obvious.
0061733199|5.0|Covered everything I wanted it too very detailed.  When I ordered I thought it would be a small book and would have preferred it to be but very satisfied with the one I received.

B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This game is super entertaing. I just got this game a few days ago and it rocks. It takes a lot of patents to play this game. Oh if your a puzzle solving person this is your game. But the bad part is some swear words. Trust me though; this is truly blood sucking fun.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|The writers of this show are very clever.  Even though there is a lot of violence happening this season, the personality chages are what interest me the most.
B00G32TD98|4.0|Horrifying and thrilling. The writer and director manage to creat a creepy ambiance that seeps deeply inside you, so much so that you can't help but feel vulnerable and fearful. The fear literally emminates from within.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|I rarely review anything for Amazon, and have never reviewed a movie before.  I found this movie surpassed even the movie \\"Killer Clowns from Outer Space\\" to become my new lowest rated film of all time.  It even took the bottom rung in bad movies away from the Bruce Willis's \\"Hudson Hawk\\" which I was not even able to finish watching in the theater when it was playing, after I paid for it.  I resent the fact that I was suckered into spending my money on this movie by virtue of the reputation of Will Smith; I did not notice ahead of time that the director was M. Night Shyamalan or I would have been more concerned.<br /> Please to not waste your hard-earned money on this awful movie.  If you want to watch it, do yourself a favor and wait until it is playing for free somewhere so you do not hate yourself for spending money on it.  Jaden Smith can not only not act, I doubt if he could get a part in a high school play somewhere if his father was not a movie star, let alone a movie someone paid to produce, otherwise.  I find it difficult to believe that responsible business people at Sony actually bought in to this thing.<br /> They have noted a lack of charisma on the part of Jaden Smith.  His father seems to have become a wooden figure in order to play the part in this movie and focus the attention on his child, who he is trying to turn into a surrogate for himself for later productions.  I cannot say strongly enough that, as a long time science fiction buff who has sixty years of reading, films, \\"movies\\" and such under his belt that this \\"movie\\" is beyond a disappointment, beyond lame, beyond banal, into an area that I have never seen a production go into.  Pay good money to watch special effects?  Why?  No acting, stilted performances, no genuine ability to suspend disbelief?  I could not suspend my disbelief at the horror of this thing actually being made, let alone sucking me into paying for it.

B00D6BQPMM|3.0|It is just a cute love story and I shouldn't have to say more but Amazon requires it so there that is it.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This game was surprisingly very fun. Though it did get a little repetitive. Also it gets very annoying when you try to aim and the bomb or rock just go flying away.

B00881VLCE|1.0|Have only played it once, some gold puzzle piece keeps popping up when you try to start and the actual puzzle never appears.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This book is an inspiration - we all go through struggles and seldom allow ourselves the time to truly understand them.  Cheryl was able to do that in her life and told the story beautifully.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|The Walking Dead has started a movement. It has ushered in the era of mainstream zombies and each new season keeps you on the edge of your seat and completely engulfed in the characters. I have given this 4 stars instead of 5 because it is more of the same. They need to push the envelope just a tad further and introduce some new conflict to regain some subtle lost momentum.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Best movie ever!  Even if one is feeling down, just watching this makes you laugh and forget your problems for a little while.  Just so funny.

B0050DZN4K|2.0|It is ok but it is not Google Reader.  As hard as they try to replace Google Reader it just is not going to happen.  The main issue of it not sync'ing between devices drives me up the wall.  I mark as read on my Kindle but then when I open Feedly on my PC the same blog post shows as unread.  Drives me NUTS!  But with that said is the best option that I have found so far to use.

0385523394|3.0|The author not long after she graduated from Smith did stupid things, including carrying drug money for which she quite a bit later was arrested and pled guilty.  She was sentenced to 15 months in prison and spent almost a year at the Federal pen for women at Danbury, CT.  This is her account of that time .  It is an informative book, but  not really highly intereting to me.  She seems to have gotten some sense in prison, and while there decided to marry the boy friend she had been living with rather than again take up just cohabitating with him without the benefit of marriage. I would presume that readers of the book will realize that living so as to avoid prison is a good thing to do.
B00BPDR3F6|2.0|I absolutely loved this author's book &#34;Eat, Pray, Love&#34;<br /><br />This book is nothing like it at all.  She is a good writer and crafts a good tale, however I was NOT looking for an entire book of WHINING by every character.  Ugh.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|&#34;There are secrets about our lives that we will never know.&#34;  (from The Husband's Secret)<br /><br />The power and effects of secrets affect our, and other, lives in so many ways  Really good read - a little slow to get started.  Stick with it and you'll be glad you did.<br /><br />One that will linger for a while after you finish it.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|It is a very entertaining game that sucks you in... literally... for hours. It is very addictive to play. Can't get enough!!
B00BB8UJKG|2.0|I noticed that a lot of folks who are writing review are \\"looking\\" for the Beautiful Girls in the movie....well, they are sort of missing the point - the point is that the guys in the movie are objectifying women and only deem them acceptable if they are BEAUTIFUL.  The scene where they rate women on a scale, commenting on their face, body and personality is a dead give away on how the writers were viewing women as just pieces of meat.....that the guys were holding out for the prime cut, instead of settling for anything less.  Note:  Many of the were not married and had very long term girlfriends that they kept on a string, but never put a ring on it.<br /><br />Only if that girlfriend on a string threatened to cut it did one of them act and she said it very well \\"that he should WANT to give her a ring, not HAVE to give her a ring to keep from loosing her\\".<br /><br />And the relationship between Will and Marty - okay, a little more than weird.  No mature adult man should be even thinking about \\"well, I can wait so many years until she grows up\\"....that only happens in Twilight, people.<br /><br />Pass on this movie, it is a waste of your time.
1451666179|5.0|I noticed that some reviewers expressed discontent about how much of the book contained material that was already published on the blog, but from the description, I actually expected nearly all of the book to be re-used material with maybe a couple of new stories and fun book-only content. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that there is a good deal of totally new content. So, don't let that stop you from buying, especially considering the amazing price.<br /><br />The quality is above and beyond expectations. Full color, super substantial pages, beautiful layout/design. Seriously, not buying this book is a crime. You should be imprisoned without trial if you do not buy this book. Without hyperbole.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Works as it should. I bought it so that I could overclock my AMD fx processor and don't run into overheating problem. Works like charm, keep my CPU nice and chilly.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|This movie was almost exactly what I had expected, maybe slightly less.  Christian Bale as Batman, I think, is a amazing decision, however, I feel that Christopher Nolan's effort on this one was somewhat dampened compared to The Dark Knight.  The plot was interesting, but there were far to many instances of things left out, or discrepancies in the films plot, and I'm not the greatest fan of the ending at all, I certainly see where Nolan was trying to go, I just didn't much care for it.  I will say, in spite of it's downfalls, it is still a Batman movie at it's heart, and anyone that is a fan of the Batman series, should at least give it a go.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I watched Teen Beach Movie when it came on the Disney Channel. I liked it and decided to buy it.
B00AEFXKOO|5.0|This film was one of Mel Gibsons' last great acting jobs, and a movie that should be remembered as a classic.  This movie has an insanely long run time, somewhere close to 3 hours or so, and it's worth every bit.  The plot is intensely gripping and the film quality in general is downright gorgeous, there's a reason this won so many awards, and thats as much as I'll say, you want to know more, you just need to watch it for yourself.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I always enjoy Child's writing and Gone Tomorrow is no exception. There are more characters in this book and I feel like they are not as well developed as they could be. Most of the supporting people are more peripheral to the story and you don't care that much about them as normal. Theresa Lee could be better developed, because she is a big part of the story.<br />Overall it is an intriguing, suspenseful book, full of twists and turns.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This Bond film definitely rates into my top 5, the acting done my Daniel Craig, is superb, as he has been since he took on the role of James Bond.  I've been a Bond film fan since I was around 7 years old, so I can rightfully say, Daniel is one of the best Bonds to date, the Sean Connery of this era of Bond.  The plot of the movie is interesting, and the backstory behind it all is really thrilling, although I wish there was more of the backstory covered and explained, but alas, it's great nonetheless.  Definitely worth a look if you're a Bond fan, and if not, check out some of the older ones first.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Since this only works when the computer and the accessing device are on the same network, it works great for my college, which has the same network all around campus. It means I can access my computer from my Kindle Fire HD when I am away from the dorm. It's great, and I could have used it months ago!!
B000A3VTT8|5.0|This is a truly splendid performance of one of the funniest and wittiest operas I have ever seen or heard. For those who are new to the wonderful world of opera, this opera is a great way to start. And for those who already love opera, it will give a couple of hours of sheer pleasure. I can truly recommend it to all viewers.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This show had a great plot and offered much suspense. Definitely a must watch for anyone looking for a good scare with some substance.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|You absolutely must read this book. You will feel pride, pain, and the utmost respect and appreciation for the men and women who give all they have so the rest of us can live free.
B004PLT3TY|4.0|Cute movie has a blended theme between Incredibles and Harry Potter, but doesn't quite meet up to those high standards. My family generally enjoyed the theme and the movie, though. I'd recommend it to those who enjoyed the Incredibles, as it is more family-friendly than H.P.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Easy to play but not always easy to win. The hints can go a little fast, but they are good if you need them.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Even my husband waits not-so-patiently to get his hands on each new Perplexus we get! For puzzle-solvers who don't mind a bit of trial and error, these are money well-spent!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book in less than 24 hours. When I did put it down, I only thought about when I could pick it back up again. This is one of those rare books, that while you are reading the story, you feel like you are really there, with the characters, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see.
B00FX8EY60|5.0|Love all the songs on this album.  It's on of her best albums ever.  If you like Katy Perry you should get this album
B008MEM24S|5.0|I got it for my son because he loves Perry and he enjoys the game to the most!!! We had the free one and I bought the other one!!!!
B00D1VKZ3M|1.0|I loved both the book & film of Bridget (of course the book was better).  In general I'm an easy reader to please, light hearted & a bit of escapism is all I require from a book!.<br />There is very little to tell you here only that this book is repetitive & very badly written.<br />Bridget is still desperate about men & repeating all the usual &#34;silly old Bridget&#34; moments, the writer has recycled quotes from book 1, only this time its &#34;so tell me Bridget what do widowed women do to get a man these days&#34; - AS IF!<br />It was such a let down and the ending was equally dire & rushed.<br />I cringed reading it & could foretell what would happen after chapter 2.<br />Worse book I've read in years.
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|I'm having trouble getting my kindle to connect to wifi can I just download to my computer I would like to read it
B00479SVBU|5.0|I bought the Soundfly MP3 FM transmitter to replace an old FM transmitter that my husband has had for years.  He loves the Soundfly because it holds all the music he wanted on an 8GB card and he can use up to a 32GB card or a stick if he wants to add more music.  He also loves the shuffle feature which his old one did not have.  Its sounds great too, no static.  And last but not least it has screen that is big enough to read at a glance.  He's only had the Soundfly a couple of weeks now and says it is far and away more superior to his old one.  I asked him if it was worth the extra money and he said \\"Yes\\".  Coming from him that was really saying something.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Loads of fun to build your town and farms and businesses.  Unfortunately there is many items that you need to use &#34;cash&#34; for in order to accomplish a quest.  &#34;cash&#34; cost real money, and if you don't use it up, you run the risk of the &#34;cash&#34; gradually disappearing from your progress bar.  Also, don't try to use &#34;cash&#34; to complete a quest unless you are on the internet.  It will grab the cash, then advise you are not online and the action cannot be complete.<br /><br />You also have to patient when you have taken care of every emergency and you are supposed to have a day without any emergencies, but one of your settlers still manage to get bit by a snake or come down with cholera within minutes of getting your all's clear notification.<br /><br />Other than those two frustrations, it is highly satisfying game.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Very handy to store bottles, pacifier, cloths in it. Would've good if there is a cover over the middle portion...and if it could come in other colors as well. But nonetheless a great product
B00BD99JMW|1.0|In a trilogy you invest money and time. In return you expect the next book to be as good as the first. Allegiant is not. The point of view jumps back and forth between Tris and Tobias but neither is well developed. Events seem to be thrown in for shock value and character development from the first two books is non-existent. I wish I never bothered to read the series.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Worked great I just wish I could cast my whole desktop. Right now it's only your phone and approved applications / browsers. I want it all Google!
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Great job!! Excellent and inspiring, as all of his books seem to be. Fast and interesting read, and well worth the money spent!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is the best i love it and i believe u should at least try it to see how it goes I LOVE THIS GAME!!!
B002ITWSUQ|5.0|I love the movie. It shows the beauty in people when they accept themselves for how good they look. Love the last moments when girl meets the boy!
B0000691U1|5.0|The presence on the same stage of recordings of these monsters makes of this album a referential item. The elegance of Duke and the spell of Mingus will reward you over and over. The jazz never sounded so moving and exciting. Plenty of innovation and swing. This recording has surpassed the test of time to became an icon.<br /><br />Don't leave it aside.
B000FC10MU|5.0|Entertaining and inspiring read, I liked the atmosphere of the novel as well as the solemnly humorous writing style a lot. Great piece of modern american literature.
0143112724|5.0|I ordered a couple of copies of this wonderful little book, and if I had received more high school graduation invitations in 2013, I'd have added a copy for each graduate. I'm a retired newspaper reporter/editor, and this little book (or a variation thereof) was within arm's reach throughout my career. It is more than a thoughtful journalist's best friend. Anyone for whom intelligible writing of any kind (story, resume, report, cover letter) is important, will learn to love this small but invaluable volume. Used faithfully, it teaches respect for the language. Best of all, it can make its users appear far more brilliant than they actually are.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|This is one of the best Hitchcock films!!!!  Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint are superb, the plot is engaging, supporting actors are strong, and there is a touch of comedy along with suspense.  My understanding is that when the movie was first released to theaters, the box office sales in the first month were slower than expected.  But over time it has become highly regarded, and most Hitchcock fans have enjoyed watching it several times over the years.  If was fun to introduce my teenage daughters to the Hitchcock classics, just as my mother had talked to me about Hitchcock's shows and films when I was growing up.  This movie will still be watched and enjoyed a century from now, and probably for several centuries into the future!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy that they finally have candy crush saga for kindle I just love it so much fun love playing it
B004GYY714|4.0|Didn't work on my HDX until the latest update. No problems since.<br /><br />Excellent app, and access to podcasts a bonus although I have not figured out if you can download podcasts for future listening on the go.
B00FN811SY|5.0|JW has done it again!! Accurate, easy to understand,  reliable information. Makes studying more exciting and enjoyable. JW.org is the best!!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I rated it as, &#34;I like it&#34; because it is useful.  It could be easier to use and audio isn't avaliable for all the books.
B0093X805W|5.0|The story has fast development and interesting imagination although the plot may appear simple and characters flat.<br />The book contains a few lessons both for children and parents, among which my favorite is to read instead of watching TV.<br />I recommend this to children and parents.<br />5 stars for the creative originality
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This heart felt, back story book was very interesting and full of information I had never considered. It was a little fact filled and wordy at times but the message came across beautifully.
B002UWH8P6|2.0|The cast of characters are in a constant feud with each other on the show. This series could have been a much better one if they would have omitted Lou Diamond Phillips, and Robert Carlyle. Both are good actors, but they don't fit into this series. This maybe why it only lasted 2 seasons.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Good game... I still love Sacra Terra a little better. I guess it`s just a matter of taste in the kind of story line you are looking for.<br />..
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Book 3 of the Divergent Trilogy.<br /><br />Tris, Four and their friends leave the city where they have lived their entire lives to hopefully find peace.  When they are pulled into another conflict, they must choose how they will live with their new reality.<br /><br />If you are looking for a happy-go-lucky, peaceful ending to this trilogy - look somewhere else.  This book is for the Dauntless in our world who look for an action-filled conclusion where nothing will ever be the same again.<br /><br />Audio Review:<br />Switching to both Tris and Tobias's perspectives was a fantastic choice for this story.  Both narrators filled their roles spectacularly.  They showed emotion in the right places and nothing when that was called for.
1401938906|5.0|I love this book and want all my friends to have a copy. Wish I had bought more it give as gifts...four copies wasn't enough. This is what the world needs!!
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|Recommend for young teenagers. The writer is very graphic and detailed, which is good. However the book could be considered &#34;long winded&#34;! Great cliff hanger that really makes you need to go to the next book in the series.<br />I enjoyed it, but then, I'm going through my third or fourth teenage years!!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|AWSOME HEADPHONES AND QUICK VERY FAST DELIVERY!<br />would repurchase form seller again!<br /><br />The sound quality is super good, i use them to edit videos and well music too and I love them, they are easy to carry around when i take them to school or just everywhere in general.<br />Comfortable fit, i have used them for several hours and they have never made my head or ears hurt of feel uncomfortable.<br />Really recommend!<br />my only dislike would be how long the cord is, but it really doesn't bother me, it almost never gets in my way.<br />definite buy!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|When it works - it is fine, but outside the US you do not have much to do with it (no Hulu or Netflix) except showing youtube videos. When it will do local streaming - that would be great.<br />Yes, and too many resets required since it lost network access and could not refind it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I read a lot of books it is mind boggling that this book just short of porn digs into the recesses of your mind and imagination what a great read
B003YTLKTE|4.0|Authentic romance about how people bump into each other and inspire each other to do what we know is right.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This is a good app. It has a video camera and just a camera I recommend this app for anybody!!
B00F2HW20M|5.0|Purchased the audio only and have been listening non stop to this AMAZING recording. Really faithful renditions to classic pieces, with the sounds that defined Genesis best period musically. Absolutely a fantastic recording and if you are a fan of early Genesis, you will not be disappointed with this.<br />However, here is my negative comment - regrettably I will NOT be purchasing the dvd - I have many of Steve's DVD's but simply canny tolerate Nad. He is the worst front man Steve has ever had. He does have a decent voice in the vein of Gabriel's early days, but nowhere close. But he is a narcissistic individual who I remember from his days posting on the old Genesis website's forum. He is as awkward as can be and detracts from what I imagine would be a simply stunning dvd - I am frankly really upset that I don't get to enjoy the visual experience thanks to him. I know, it's my problem, but I also know I am not alone in this feeling....<br />Steve - for Revisited 3, PLEASE tour with someone else!!!!
B003G4W49C|4.0|It was a little dark with the use of children but a good journey and a happyish end, which is very important to me.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|I like the app. It's helping me to learn Hebrew right now. Easy to use, no crashes .<br />Worth to get it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i've just gotten the game for my kendal.so far it has been a blast trying to compete with the levals.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Rick made magic in this book ( literally ). It has spoilers to. Rick did as good job. It was cool when Nico convinced Hades to join battle. It also includes Percy's new love interest Annabeth Chase. And guess who's back? Rachel. God's are at war. Fighting Typhon a really powerful monster.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book is a novel, but I felt so sorry for some of the situations children encountered .  The book goes back and forth in years and I got mixed up sometimes, but it was good and I want to read it again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game been playing for a while hate beeing stuck on some boards but i still love this game.
1476727651|4.0|Good read. The story moves quickly and is very creative. Clever use of mobile home people tied to the disappearance of children.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Amazing period piece - BBC's answer to Dallas. It is inspiring to see a nation's culture and history celebrated with such style, grace and class.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Very well done.<br />Movie theater quality.<br />Historically accurate.<br />This is a well written, wonderfully acted<br />drama.<br />This series is for those who like quality<br />television.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed this a lot.  Looking forward to additional rooms.  The instructions could be better but overall it was challenging but not too tough.
B00B9B4IYI|5.0|Works great.  It paired with my phone and I have had no issues.  It is small and discreet, and USB powered.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Jennifer Lawrence is wonderful in this movie -  she really stands out.  Stanley Tucci is also great.  The drama of the movie is very intense.
B00G9U7NEQ|2.0|Hi, Im a parent of 3 kids 6, 4, and 2 (my boy finally) and I just happily dished out the $19.99 for Monsters University and sat down with the fam and popcorn for our movie night of fun. Although we all tried, none of us, ecspecially the kids, were into Monsters U after about 30 minutes. The Pixar team seems to have taken the only part about Monsters Inc. that nobody really was curious about, which is 'So what happened BEFORE all this?' and made an entire freaking movie about it. What would have been cool, is if it was a movie that expanded on the most personal and involved part of Monsters inc which was the interaction between a giant monster and a small child, whom the monster was supposed to put the fear of god into, and the child who shouldve feared the giant creature. A great sequel would have been about the gang getting trapped in he human world somehow, and having to blend in for an extended amount of time. Dressing like humans, observing funny human behaviors, imitating said behaviors, going to work, etc. and coming into an appreciation of humans, and in the end finding a way to interact with the humans in a positive way, while getting energy off our laughter, or maybe start scaring adults, because thats way funnier than scaring little kids. I dont know... I thought it was kind of not great, and it made me sad because its a Disney/Pixar, and they rule. My recommendo is I PROBABLY WOULDNT BOTHER AND THAT MAKES ME MAD BECAUSE PIXAR IS AWESOME.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|Don't expect to feel satisfied with this ending. Good book, but there's needs to be a little more of a ending for me to love the whole thing.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always, Grisham snared me with the first few pages but did not give away the ending until, well, the end.
B00FPH6M82|3.0|I was looking forward to this film, despite friends who told me it wasn't worth the price of admission.  I like Will Smith, and I really like sci-fi / doomsday / post-apocalyptic films.<br /><br />Unfortunately this film is slow and not really gripping.  It's sort of like the Matrix IV (had they made a fourth film).  No, the story isn't the same, but the action element of the story competes with the symbolism of the story in the same way (if, in fact, the writer intended any symbolism between the tech-enabled omnipotent father and his son's sojourn on Earth).  And that symbolism could have been very good—it worked well in &#34;The Lion King&#34;.<br /><br />Will Smith might be able to carry an entire movie on his own (in fact he's probably earned a &#34;Cast Away&#34; moment for himself) but this film isn't about Will Smith.  It's about his kid—alone on screen for well over half the film!  If you fell in love with Jaden in recent hits like &#34;The Karate Kid&#34; remake, then you'll really lov... What?  Oh, you didn't?  Never mind then.<br /><br />In short, this film is a mix of lackluster action mixed with moments of slow, monotonous air-conditioned sleepy spaceship dialog (like Stargate Universe, only less interesting).<br /><br />On a positive note, I think it's great that Will and Jada are creating family bonding experiences through their films.  Who cares about the profitability!  They're having fun making movies together as a family—and that's what counts.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|For Star Trek fans this movie was a real blast!  Capt Kirk and his crew are able to overcome extreme odds and save the Earth and The Federation
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I have tried multiple times to get it working. There is always an error of some kind and it will not complete the installation.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Movie about the final end to mankind as we know it with Brad Pitt searching for the answer to save mankind.
B00G32TD98|3.0|Had it's scary moments, but not as awesome as some of the reviews would lead you to believe. I did enjoy it for the most part.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|It so clearly lays out all the lures and traps of our overwhelming dive into the pit of transparency and total abandonment of any shred of personal identity.
B0036FYO12|4.0|One of Sydney Pollacks best films. Excellent cast. Tense and realistic...although the love story was a bit forced and cliche.
B005544TRQ|3.0|Another layer show with a slightly more interesting back story.  A good filler show when you need mindless time between better shows.
B0037QO8XE|3.0|It was a good movie. Well acted and gripping story. I just didn't like it. It just seemed to exasperate stereotypes and failed to move me, as a viewer, to a higher level of consciousness about the plights of black women and what society can do about it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This finding game is nice because it sends you on a variety of quests, and let's u learn the pictures as difficulty increases. You use energy to search pictures which regenerates slowly over time, so you won't play for long stretches but it's fun to keep up the running game. You  can do just about everything in game without buying anything as long as you are not in a hurry, because extra energy costs.
0062255657|5.0|Have read all of Gaiman's books.  This is one of the best, though not long.  A beautiful mythic tale for modern times, weaving, as Gaiman does so well, magic into and through the everyday and showing us both great good and great evil.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|I've always loved this movie, especially around Halloween! It's a classic and definitely worth watching if you haven't seen it.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Great clock. I love waking up to Beyonc&eacute; in the morning. However, I'm a napper so it sucks that I can't set alarms in the afternoon.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|In the words of Honest Trailers: &#34;This is either the most awesome dumb movie ever, or the dumbest awesome movie ever.&#34; A very tongue-in-cheek film about giant robots punching giant monsters in the face; Pacific Rim is well worth seeing.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I never write reviews and am a book critic. This novel is a must-read. Tartt knows how to write plot and perhaps is one of the best at characterization. Tartt doesn't just write books; she spends years creating worlds for the reader to enter.  This is a beautiful, engrossing book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I enjoyed the idea of revisiting the Danny character from The Shining. The thought of him finding a use for his 'shining' ability was interesting. The 'bad guys' were in interesting lot and a not too far fetched notion - which is what makes them fearsome.
B00G4A6VZS|5.0|I have been waiting for a while for this to come to android. My two girls (now 8&amp;9) love stack the states and have all of states and capitols memorized now along with some different landmarks. We are still working on various things in the US but have moved our focus to world  geography. Needless to say, I'm beyond happy they can play this game which will reinforce what I'm teaching them! I love it!!!
B008JEJN8O|5.0|I have a mild case of plantar fasciitis that can flare up occasionally. This have made my feet feel great after my last flare up, and I haven't had on since. I mainly wear them around our house, since it's predominately hard surfaces. They are great after a hard rock climbing sessions, since my tiny climbing shoes really tweak my feet.<br /><br />They have a roomy fit, but I ordered my normal size and loved them.
B00G2SIW7M|4.0|I wanted to love this album so much. From Funeral to Neon Bible to The Suburbs (and even to a lesser extent, the Arcade Fire EP and before), Arcade Fire has always struck a chord with me with their deep emotional message, and bombastic, earnest, and adventurous musical styling. This album features a lot of the same qualities, but through a different lens - it is highly electronic, more emotionally detached, and lacking the organic quality that made previous releases so compelling, and Arcade Fire my favorite band.<br /><br />The live performances of this album far outstrip the actual recorded work presented here. Watch the SNL \\"Here Comes the Nighttime\\" special on YouTube if you don't believe me, and that to me is what is at the core of the problem here - the production changes exhibited here seemed to have killed the soul of the album. In the past, there were some tracks that were recorded as full bands (Antichrist Television Blues), and even on the ones that were done more traditionally, the band had a large part in the production process which allowed the emotional touches, the minor mistakes, the organic feel of everything to continue to bleed through. The inherit human quality that exists with music recorded together, as a group, is something that cannot be denied, and it is missing from this album. This album is like a friend who left for a few years, and came back with new interests, a new girlfriend, and with barely anything in common with you anymore - the appearance is the same, but the person you knew is gone. This to me feels like an overproduced work that could have been saved if it was recorded in a giant old church in Montreal. As it stands though, a live recording of the same album front to back would blow this out of the water, hands down, without question.<br /><br />All this being said, this would be the best album of most other bands' careers. I might hold Arcade Fire to a higher standard at this point, but that is only because at this point in their career, they are on their own playing field.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I thought it was a five star game because it is a lot like real life for a free game
B006BFK5DK|4.0|When you see that Maurice White wasn't directly involved in this album at all, it might make you question the idea of a new Earth, Wind & Fire album.  The hype that called it a return to their classic sound (while updating it at the same time) sounds nice, but could it work?<br /><br />  The answer, it turns out, is YES!  It doesn't compare to their mid-late 70s classics, but all that means is that it's not the absolute best of its kind.  There is still plenty of room in that statement for it to be a great album, and it delivers.  When I was trying to find samples of the album before buying it, I heard the first twenty or so seconds of \\"Sign On\\" and knew that I needed to buy the album.  \\"Sign On\\"'s lyrics aren't as edgy as the promotional material suggests, but that is not at all a bad thing.  The two up-tempo tunes, \\"My Promise\\" and \\"Dance Floor\\", seem to be the obvious single choices.  Neither are the high point of the album but are good listens regarless.  Where the album excels is during the ballad cuts.  \\"Guiding Lights\\" and \\"Got to Be Love\\" in particular are a pleasure to listen to; they sound as \\"right\\" as you could imagine.  \\"Belo Horizonte\\" is a pleasant but not overly memorable instrumental, but \\"Splashes\\" harks back to the very early days of the band, where the jazz fusion and atmospheric vibe would have felt right at home.  \\"Night of My Life\\" sounds very contemporary but is surprisingly one of the most catchy and enjoyable songs on the whole album, and \\"The Rush\\" is as classic EWF as a 2013 album has any right to be.<br /><br />  Different retailers have different \\"deluxe\\" versions of this album for sale, but the best buy (groan) of these would be the Target version, which has two bonus tracks.  Judging by the lyrics, \\"Hero as He Rose\\" is pretty clearly a song about Jesus, and a great one at that--the main album doesn't have any \\"gritty\\" funk on it, but this almost changes that.  Unfortunately, for me \\"Whirlwind\\" is a let down; aside from Larry Dunn's synth playing towards the end nothing interesting really happens.<br /><br />  One of the best things about the album is the sequencing; everything flows very naturally.  It's not the best EWF album by any means, but it has tons of things going for it.
B00EQF0JJC|2.0|Please excuse me if it's impolite to mention, but one is sorely challenged to comprehend how creating the [[ASIN:B00CIUS3DQ Buffy the Vampire Slayer]] series (just for starters) gives Joss Wheden any particular insight into Much Ado About Nothing. True, Buffy did buy him quite the trophy hacienda in Santa Monica--I'm guessing easily way north of $10 mil. Then there's no disputing the extra-brilliant tax write-off to make it a legitimate work expense as the location for his movie. Sure beats the home office deduction.  That Joss, always thinking!<br /><br />It is terribly hospitable of him to show us the kids' bedrooms and the [[ASIN:B001U5SPHO Architectural Digest ]]-worthy kitchen, the infinity pool, and all, yet the reality remains that none of the flawlessly tasteful decor tells us anything new about Shakespeare's play. If anything, it's just sorta weird when too many of The Bard's lines fall flat and just lie there in the surreal disconnect with the contemporary setting and fashionable wardrobe. All the men's suits, btw, are exceptionally well-tailored.<br /><br />I'm sure Joss had fine intentions and felt really good about making the movie, I mean proving not only how much smarter and better educated he and his pals are than the TV audiences that made him so much money, but also that no mere Hollywood TV hack, he is as serious an artist as, say, any of those snooty Euro auteurs shooting Dogma-style with available light and making the actors do their own make-up. Plus you just can't argue with Shakespeare when it comes to establishing \\"real theatre\\" credibility and prestige.<br /><br />No doubt Joss & friends all had a perfectly splendid time, the caterers on set served only all organic meals, they had good wine at lunch just like the French and Italians always do on location, etc., etc., but one suspects that you really had to be there to fully appreciate that private party.<br /><br />Ah! The irony is too perfect. Much ado about nothing, indeed!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|A pretty effective zombie apocalypse movie. The story certainly has its holes including a fairly laughable plane crash sequence however the special effects are extremely well done. All scenes involving the zombies are well done and pretty amazing. Brad Pitt's role could have been played by anyone as his dialogue is simple and limited. I like this movie overall and recommend it.

B003204MQS|5.0|A lesson in how to make an actual scarey movie. This brilliant film doesn't rely on gore or special effects to gross out or dazzle the viewer but instead slowly builds terror and suspense through subtle and effective use of your own imagination. I've never been more on edge watching a movie nor have I been more scared. Absolute genius.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's just simply fan-freaking-tastic. I love it and never tire of it. But by far the most addictive game I've ever played.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|One of the best fantasy series I've ever read. No more good knights and evil dragons, only people playing their game - game of thrones. In this book battles can be won with the sword and fire, but wars can only be won with politics and treachery. There is no main character in this series, so every one can die in any moment, leaving you shocked and hating the author for he has killed your favorite character. Highly recommend this book to everyone

0071762345|5.0|Dave walks the talk!  He responded to my Tweet within hours.  I've read a few books on Social Media.  This book definitely gives you the foundation on how to be social in the social media ecosystem.  Not to use the social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, etc.) as \\"broadcast channels\\".  It has made me think about how the paradigm is truly changing from linear to multi-dimensional social media.  Feedback is almost instantaneous.

B0088W7VNG|4.0|I've seen this show from 'end to end' several times over.  While it is a very good Sci-Fi show, I thought it a shame that the two best shows of the entire series were the final two shows.  That being said, however, I would recommend it if you've never seen it.  The on screen chemistry between Colonel Shepard, Rodney McKay, Carson Beckett & later Ronan Dex were what (in my opinion) made it the better of the two &#34;Stargate&#34; series.<br /><br />While it will never measure up to &#34;Battlestar Galactica,&#34; (the best sci-fi show, ever) the two of them were a great mix as they both started and ended at the same time.  SGA had roughly 25 more shows than BSG (which had a propensity for agonizingly long hiatuses between seasons), I recommend it for any Sci-Fi (I refuse to say 'Sy Fy') fan.
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|Eggers has written a novel to publicize his beliefs about technology in the future. His basic premise is interesting but is characters are so boring and unbelievable that the book put me to sleep every time I picked it up and tried to finish it.

B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I liked this on Kindle until level 35 where on the kindle you have to pay to advance... on the tablet and phone its free.... what's going on with that??? Why isn't  it free here too? I mean you have a waiting period before you can move on but you don't have to pay I guess I will go back to my truly free versions.... Nasty trick they pulled . I might be willing  to pay if this were a real strategy game but its all just chance with random boards.

B00A285OOW|4.0|Maybe it is the \\"Game of Thrones Effect\\" but I could not put this book down. It is a story about England's Tudor and York families and the politics of inheritance and marriage. The main character is Elizabeth, a Princess of York, who is moping  over her married lover Richard III (Gregory writes redundantly about this throughout the first half of the book). Richard, a York, has been defeated in battle by Henry and Elizabeth is a \\"spoil of war\\" who is forced to prove her fertility before marrying King Henry VII, a Tudor. Elizabeth comes to love her rapist husband King Henry and they have a large family. The book is well-paced and the births, battles, and court scenes are detailed, describing the colors of the family banners and clothing, as well as the sights and smells of the English landscape.<br /><br />The court members are the real characters in this book, many of them switching allegiances and/or dying tragically. Elizabeth's mother, who is quotable, mystical, and stronger than her daughter is the only character that resonated with me. She deals with her daughter honestly, lovingly, but is always cognizant of Elizabeth's duties to her Tudor King husband and the heirs they conceive. The King (and his weirdly-pious mother) are always suspicious of Elizabeth; Phillipa Gregory never misses an opportunity to enforce that when the King and Elizabeth interact. Elizabeth could have been so much smarter; when the King questions her about the Yorks, her usual reply is \\"I don't know.\\" Even though Elizabeth becomes Queen, her life is sad because of her narrow focus on her family, her meddling mother-in-law, her stressed husband, and all the activities of the warring families.<br /><br />This was my first Phillipa Gregory book I have read and will read more.

B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I enjoyed it a lot not much more to say other than that. It's not a movie short on emotion or dialogue which is unique to find in a modern day holywood Sci-Fi flicks that usually have shallow plots with CGI galore. This movie is colorful and beautiful in comparison to the usually dark and sepia toned post apocalyptic movies.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun to play.  I think it is crazy to buy more time.  You should have unlimited time without buying &#34;lives&#34;.  I play till that message pops up simply go to another game.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Everything you wanted was there in the movie but it never came together. It seemed like Tony Stark just randomly delivered his intoxicated dialogue throughout the entire story. The other movies seemed to have Tony with a sort of sarcastic quirky charm but this one seemed like his personality was forced on you. Why am I complaining about that? Well, it makes the movie feel like a movie instead of having a character naturally blend in with the story, it feels like you're just hearing lines you know were meant to get a reaction from the audience. This film plays more on comedy than wit and it gives off a cartoonish vibe. What I never get about any of these Marvel Superhero movies is that they always turn into some lighthearted comedic action movie. When in the comics the characters are pretty complex,serious,and deep. This is more like the Saturday Morning Ironman than the comic book iron man but so be it. What's surprising about the film is that it's light hearted but Tony Starks shoots people with guns and kills them in the film? Why? Iron Man doesn't go around killing people he's not the Punisher. That stuff aside the overall Villain in this movie is typical and that's boring. Ironman 2 YES! That was fun. Iron Man 1 I forgot who he was ever fighting but it didn't matter because it was all about IRON MAN. In Iron Man 3 it's like it has Trilogy Syndrome. It's time for the hero to hang his cape up and go on enjoying his life. Lets not forget that danger still exists and there will always be a need for a superhero or that Tony Starks might need his little inventions again for another threat in the future. It's just the standard cliche super hero Trilogy ending. With Iron Man it leaves on sort of a sad note because I don't think Iron man ever had a true Villain worthy of him fighting at least not depicted properly. The Mandarin is probably one of the bigger let downs of the film. Hopefully the Avengers movie will make up for Iron Man always having such week villains in a universe full of Supervillians from Dr. Doom to Madame Masque that have better movie worthy story lines. This 3rd installment definitely felt like it was just put together to finish the series off with little thought into the plot outside of as much action as possible. Was it a movie worth seeing? Sure it's a good action fix if you need it but it's not better than the first 2 it's actually a weak follow up that leaves you looking for something better. Hopefully we'll get that in Avengers 2.universe full of Supervillians from Dr. Doom to Madame Masque that have better movie worthy story lines.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Every once in a while I will read a book that I can't put down. Doctor Sleep was one of those. Having been Stephen King's #1 fan for as long as I can remember, (at 64 I can hardly remember yesterday), I read every book he writes and struggle through some but Doctor Sleep was one that kept me enchanted from beginning to end. Please note that you MUST have read The Shining, (not just watched the movie), in order to &#34;get it&#34;! Enjoy!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|this is one of the best SciFi films of  the past decade. i did not kno when i first started watching it, that it is sort of a Alien prequel, but i figured it out soon enuf, altho the creatures were de-evovled, and the plot was speculative in some areas. and director extraordinaire, Ridley Scott tipped me off. the stinking movie producers do not put extras on the discs they supply Netflix w/ anymore (which i f***ing hate); you may as well record off Dish! i had to buy the BluRay so i could listen to the commentaries by Ridley Scott and the writers. then the film made more sense, and my guesses were turned to fact. there is supposedly another entry into this lot coming from Ridley Scott in a year or so. i can't wait. by the way, Noomi Rapace, is every bit a sexy-rambo in this as Sigorney Weaver was in the Alien films.  this is a film you either will love or hate. i am in the former category. i like ambiguity. gives you something to think about!<br />Matthew K.

B00E8AVNBI|5.0|Originally posted to my blog on September 30, 2013.<br /><br />Dutch born Roel Rein&eacute; has already proven himself to be a top-notch action director with movies like &#34;Death Race 2&#34; and &#34;12 Rounds: Reloaded.&#34; Roel started a new era in Dutch Cinema by making mainstream English language ‘Genre Movies’ with his company Rebel Film and has been very successful at doing them with modest budgets. His latest directorial release is no exception.<br /><br />&#34;Dead In Tombstone,&#34; marks Rein&eacute;’s third film with actor Danny Trejo (&#34;Machete&#34;, &#34;Bad Ass&#34;) in this action-packed, supernatural Western that finds Trejo making a deal with the Devil for his soul and mortality after he is murdered by his own gang.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke appears to relish his role as the roguish Lord of the Underworld, who can’t help himself when it comes to keeping an eye on Guerrero, even popping up on occasion to be entertained as Guerrero exacts his bloody retribution. The scenes in hell are especially enjoyable where Rourke saunters around a restrained Trejo, sadistically taunting and torturing Trejo’s character, even ripping the flesh from his back to feed the fires of hell.<br /><br />After the ruthless Blackwater Gang overruns the small gold mining town of Tombstone, Colorado (not Arizona) and murders its sheriff, the gang murders their own leader, Guerrero Hernandez (Trejo) in a cold-blooded power grab. As Hernandez lays dying on a saloon floor, he tells his half brother Red Cavanaugh (Anthony Michael Hall) and the rest of his seditious cohorts that he will see them all again—in hell.<br /><br />Sentenced to eternal damnation, Guerrero finds himself confronted by Satan incarnate (Mickey Rourke), who informs him that he has been waiting for him. Not wishing to spend eternity being one of hell’s “pitiful suffers,” Guerrero offers the Devil a trade, his soul for the soul of his half brother and the others that betrayed him—all delivered within twenty-four hours. ”One day, twenty-four hours. What is that compared to eternity?” Guerrero asks Satan. Amused by the proposition the Devil accepts his offer on one condition: all six souls must die by Guerrero’s hand and his hand alone. With the deal struck Guerrero is sent back to Tombstone to exact his brutal revenge against his former gang.<br /><br />Anthony Michael Hall also seems be a natural fit to his role as Guerrero’s half-brother Red “Rojo” Cavanugh. Though this is not the first time Hall has played a bad guy (&#34;Warehouse 13&#34;), it is the first time he actually comes off as someone believably despicable and unlikable, and someone who you want to get his comeuppance in the end.<br /><br />Danny Trejo’s portrayal of the betrayed gunslinger with a modicum of conscience—something that Satan points out and tells him will be the undoing of the deal—may not be much of an acting stretch for Trejo, but he certainly knows how to deliver when it comes to portraying the resurrected killer. Trejo plays the bad ass with just enough tough and mean and empathy that the character is likeable and we desire to see him succeed in his quest to save his soul.<br /><br />Though the screenplay written by Brendan Cowles and Shane Kuhn is pretty standard fair when it comes to the classic plot of a Western revenge film, they do manage to put a twist on the old formula. It also helps that the film was cast not only with three incredible main actors, but also a strong supporting cast that includes Dina Meyer, Richard Dillane, Emil Hostina, Colin Mace, Ovidiu Niculescu, Ronan Summers, Edward Akrout, and Radu Andrea Micu, all of whom help to strengthen the film’s dialog that at times could have come off as unintelligent if spoken by actors of a lesser caliber.<br /><br />&#34;Dead In Tombstone&#34; with its supernatural elements is a gritty vengeance Western that delivers enough shootouts, chase scenes, and explosions to make it an action-packedand entertaining film.ining film.

She copes by donning a hard shell to hide her insecurities.<br /><br />It's also about a girl, Niamh (pronounced neeve), sent off eight decades earlier from New York to the Midwest on what they called an Orphan Train. Her struggles against abuse, neglect, and depression are laid out alongside those of Molly. When we see their similar circumstances, we understand how the past and the present overlay. And it makes us hope the future can one day be changed for the better.<br /><br />When Molly steals a book from the library -- Jane Eyre! -- she's given community service to avoid the theft going on her record. That's when she meets the ninety-year-old Vivian, or Niamh as she was once called. Vivian wants to clean up her attic and Molly needs fifty hours of work.<br /><br />As they begin opening the boxes and boxes of Vivian's attic, Molly is stand-offish from the wealthy woman who's led such a golden life. But she soon learns each box contains memories from Vivian's past. And she finds out Vivian's beginnings weren't that much different from Molly's.<br /><br />This book is obviously a labor of love. The rich details and careful research makes the story come alive. I enjoyed it far more than I expected.<br /><br />Excellent read for those who like historical novels mixed with human emotion and real life.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|Mesmerizing.  This book is so beautifully articulated in Spanish.  I'm now going to compare it to the English version and see if the translation does it justice.  The words are romantically beautiful.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so far I really love this app. you get to feed treat groom muck out clean up train and best of all you get to win compotitions. the compotitions are a little too easy to win though. but I love it. it requires energy but you get it back fast so far so good. oh. to buy other horses it costs a lot of gems or coins so I'm stuck with beauty for now but ill get another one soon this is my first day playing
B00E9P959O|4.0|I always thought the tunes here were great. They reflect a difficult time in the bands 40 year trip. The original sounded like doo doo. This is much more enjoyable now and doesn't require major adjustments to your stereo. Well worth it if you like the band. I applaud the band for making this right. Shows they care about their tunes and their fans.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Atwood has created a world not too distant from our own; and perhaps a Waterless Flood is where we are headed. But more than a cautionary tale thus is a story about how we use stories to create sense and meaning in our world. Stories make us human.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect, but it is a new movie, and came factory sealed.  I opened it to make sure it worked and it is great.<br />Great quality and fast service .
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Great movie, good storyline, great acting. Matthew McConaughey is very good. This is one of his better roles. The two boys in the movie are good too. I imagine we'll be seeing more of them in the future. I'll watch it again sometime soon.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Told from such a different perspective. The voice of death. The characters will bind to your heart and the story will leave you in tears  but  a must read.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Fascinating, tricky, entertaining. A good time. They don't like my short reviews here, so I have to make up this lack of words.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great movie for the kids.  Kept their attention.  It was exactly what they needed on a long car ride.  They even quote the movie.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The book is much more gratifying than the movie, which glossed over the real topic of this book, which is mental illness.
B003XE3G0Q|1.0|I ordered to pairs of size 9 CROCS (no half sizes available).  One pair was too small and one was too large.  Very confusing!!
B000002J03|5.0|I own all of Led Zepplin's albums, and for portability, all of their CDs.  I bought this CD,one of my favorites, for a friend who borrowed XOSO and never gave it back.  I replaced XOSO for myself and decided to treat him to more of one of the most influential bands of all time.  (It's his 25 year old son who is hooked, but we pretend not to notice.)
0375831002|5.0|4.5 stars. I'm still sorting out what I thought about this book. Powerful, poignant, horrifying, strange, and even silly in places.<br /><br />In the beginning, it was a little like reading Shakespearean English: the words at the beginning of each section, the time jumps, the sense of mystery/confusion about the narrator, all felt disorienting and hard to grasp, and then, suddenly, there was a click! and it made sense, fell into a rhythm, and I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />It's not even clear until the middle of the novel why the narrator is calling Liesel \\"the book thief.\\" but then it becomes clear. The graphic novel sections were a surprise, but oddly, they fit.<br /><br />I felt the ending was a bit weak, and wrapped up too hastily and incompletely. Overall though, extremely powerful, moving, and well worth the read.
B00EAH3EQG|5.0|The first thing that attracted me to this CD was the song &#34;Problem&#34;.  Not only is the beat to this song infectious, the lyrics are incredible.  I listened to some of the other tracks on YouTube before I purchased the CD.  Now that I've had the chance to listen to the CD as a whole I continue to be amazed by the music and impressed by the depth of the intriguing lyrics.  I'm 59 and if you're an old coot like me, go back to YouTube and listen to The Knack's song &#34;My Sharrona&#34;.  Now listen to &#34;Problem&#34; and take it from there.<br />We'll always have our past, take a listen to the present.
B001JIHGO0|4.0|I enjoy this movie.  I got it to fill out my collection.  I am typing to put enough words in this to be accepted
B000002J09|5.0|I own every Led Zepplin albumn and for portability, every Led Zepplin CD.  I love this CD as a whole, great for long drives, so when  a friend &#34;borrowed&#34; it for 2 months I had to replace it.  Why deprive him of one of my favorite CD's ever.
B0085P2Z6E|1.0|This game was kind of boring. I was not impressed at all with it. It was a waste of my time to download it.
B000I3PA8Q|4.0|A wholesome family movie, lots of fun. Only huge question is &#34;why would unidentified aliens care about whales on Earth?&#34;
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I love this game. The levels make me smile. The angry birds done star wars is a win win concept. it is just a bit bulky if you have an older phone.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|As I read this book, the perspective on how the story is being told was very different. I kept reminding my self that I was reading this story through the eyes of \\"death\\".  I really enjoyed the story line, how the story was being told and the visions the story created while reading it.
B00D1VKZ3M|2.0|A lazy third book. Rather than a book showing Bridget growing as a person and experiencing new aspects of life, this book just repeats the first two books - all laughs seemed recycled. After much excitement initially as I loved the first two books, I struggled to get through it
1401937535|2.0|Anita says a few things in her book  She says that heaven has the unconditional love that even “criminals” never got, and this is the reason for their “behavior.”  She also says that time isn't linear.  And she talks all over the place about loving yourself and living life fearlessly.  But then, in consequent replies to questions, in saying that criminals get the love they never had in “heaven” she says that in this time we need jails to “protect” the innocence.  (!?)  And time isn't linear, it's all perfect in an amazing tapestry.  WHERE exactly is “this time” supposed to exist where jails are protecting the innocent: time not being “linear” where a system that is based on controlling people through trauma and teaches others that this will “protect” the innocent, where exactly does this work, I mean REALLY WORK, rather than it maintains the system and ideology that causes trauma and excuses it on both sides of the cops and robbers game!? And if time isn't linear in heaven, heaven must be working awfully hard to avoid being able to transform the world at any point into a place not needing trauma based controls, lest we see it's humans that do this, NOT &#34;heaven.&#34; And when you have this idea as part of a society, something people would hold onto for &#34;protection&#34; for &#34;comfort&#34; for something to do, then what happens is that you have anyone that's insecure, or scared or what have you attaching to exactly that: the idea that trauma based control will change things, or give them something they need, or will give them power over others and alleviate the lack of self worth. And that's Anita's basic rant: &#34;love yourself,&#34; &#34;it's a lack of self worth and love that causes disease and even what's called criminal behavior.&#34; And yet she actually excuses the whole system that teaches taking away self worth, that teaches and implements dehumanizing, terrorizing, inflicting shame, judging, maiming, hating, taking awayfreedoms, incarcerating, and even murdering, that this has something to do with &#34;protection&#34; of innocence. And this is necessary &#34;in this time&#34; although time isn't linear, and we carry heaven with us rather than it's something we're separate from. And yet she says we're separate from exactly that harmony that we carry around with us beyond time and space &#34;in this time,&#34; needing a space called prisons, instead.  Beyond the whole erroneous ideas (and thus cycles of time that people themselves cause, not some lack of &#34;evolution&#34;), what I see is that jails (every jail, show me one which doesn't), every jail has people who have done something that only insults people's “fashion.” That then AGAIN being another thing Anita talks about. In one country what's illegal is legal or “appropriate” in another. And she says people are controlled by their “culture,” her use of the word culture not mine. I think culture is free of such things, as is art. Culture isn't programming or mind control. She says that when they no longer have a body that kind of programming goes away, but we need jails to maintain such programming and “protect” the innocent “in this time.&#34; To protect the body and it's erroneous programming. Someone runs naked in the rain, and it's an offence, but waging war isn't. Or where aren't there within the jail population people who never even did what they are accused of, but are collateral damage for a “necessary” system?  Where aren't there political dissidents in jail; or individuals like the guy in Les Miserable that just stole a piece of bread because they might otherwise starve? All of this to define who's innocent and who isn't.  We all have a spark of God in us, that is what remains and is in forever and thus being in forever can't be destroyed at any point in space or time but instead expands into itself proving love has no opposite, which is what forever means, another thing Anita would agree with,up to a point, evidently. There aren't any “non-innocent” people to begin with. And neither are we separate from each other. She says that as well. In &#34;heaven,&#34; which she again separates while contradicting herself saying we carry it around with us and it isn't separate from the world we live in: in heaven, she says we know a person's whole story, understand the momentum that lead to anything we would judge. Innocence being the only thing that gives life any meaning. That's the only protection that there is. Investing in trauma based control tactics such as jails doesn't protect innocence, it protects the erroneous idea that trauma is a means to an end. Neither society or the human condition work that way.   When you invest in a trauma based discipline such as jails, you support the idea that trauma is necessary to maintain harmony and peace; what this does is that it teaches people that it is a means to an end; both sides of the good guys bad guys game using the SAME concept to excuse their violent behavior. Believing it's a means to an end manifests both sides. And if you would actually study who has control over this trauma based disciplinarian system, who exactly are these people who are given the power to traumatize others in order to maintain control, harmony and well being; you will find a whole shadow government going on; and all sorts of things like human trafficking, wars, drug addiction etc. instead of being stopped are fostered and cultivated not only by the idea that having power over another person has turned into some sort of magic, but it's the corruption WITHIN the penal system that is one of the main supports, main buttresses of human trafficking, allowing it to continue and is what is preventing it from being stopped. And it tells people that having control over another gives you power. And this is supposed to protect the innocent, and Anita says we needed it in “this time,” which she says isn't linear. What do we need it for? To show that it doesn't work?  And Anita really was healed, but I don't think she is a healer. There are people who have had such experiences, touched in with heaven, and who EVERY DAY, when someone comes to see them, have what happened to Anita happen, and much more, and more dramatic, and more supposedly impossible. But you don't find these people running media campaigns and making millions of dollars with Hayhou$e Publi$hing. Nor making such coddled remarks.  John of God, who was the conduit for God to heal Wayne Dyer certainly is a healer, and he's not making such money or playing the media game. Wayne Dyer didn't even give it much credence and then collapsed and had to go to bed for a whole spell to allow the healing to take place, the healing John of God supports. And there's Reverend Orbito, Father Joshua the psychic surgeon, Adam McCleod the Dream Healer, there was a lady named Leah Olof and many MANY more....  And EVERYONE deserves the right to love themselves being that who they really are, their core being, is IN heaven, is in forever, can never be destroyed anywhere in time or space; and certainly is so magnificent that it deserves the kind of self love daring to declare “I'm better than to believe we need a trauma based discipline anywhere in any form at any time for any reason.”  And to declare: &#34;And I love myself enough to know a trauma based discipline doesn't work, and I don't need to put myself through that.&#34;  People need to know it's fine and natural to love yourself that much and that way and dare to say: “Heh, this isn't right!”  Anita also has a whole way of describing the spirit world, but it doesn't really ring true to me. She says her father was there, said she couldn't go any further because she couldn't turn back if she went any further. She says he told her to go back and live life fearlessly, although she at first wanted to “die” or move on: go where her father said she couldn't turn back from, and this then was communication at a telepathic level, which she also goes into explaining. I would think that a telepathic level was that it only seems you can't turn back, but there is no here or there. Telepathy would be that wherever you go you take that part of you with you that would be where you THINK you can't go into heaven. The whole idea again makes no sense when you truly take in what she says. It's highly contradictory. That there's something in heaven that is so great it makes you want to let go of everything you thought was valuable in life, and yet you can't go there without not being able to turn back (as if it's not everywhere). I just DO NOT believe this, I don't believe there are such limitations. It would depend on your value system. There's no leaving anything behind or not being able to turn back. Instead she says there are the same barriers that would separate heaven from earth. There's here and there, and where you can't come back from. I just simply don't believe there are such barriers or limitations. And I think the healers go beyond, without any problem. They DO GO to where she thought you can't return from, and they have integrated how they never were separate: It's not about here or there, heaven or earth or the body or the spirit. They have nothing to do with leaving or returning, just being. And what's always been there and always will be, no matter how impossible people think it is, or need jails instead.   For her to basically disqualify the whole energy from heaven by acting like it isn't strong enough to alleviate the “need” for jails which support coercion and trauma based discipline and having power over another person as a means to make change (the same thing criminals are condoning), really to me is misrepresenting what happened, what heaven is and what is possible as well as what truly does heal. And for me this creates limitations which really don't exist, such as not being able to turn back from, which she says is from heaven.  I would be concerned about people truly in need of a healing adventuring beyond the separation Anita says exists, while she highly contradicts that herself saying we aren't separate: what's beyond the place she believed she wouldn't have been able to return from. I would suggest looking for a healer that does exactly that, that goes beyond such limitations. Someone who becomes a conduit for such healing every day, and who has a whole list of people they have helped find there aren't such limitations. Those people really do exist.
B00DVPN30A|5.0|Incredible as always.The best voice to come out in the last decade.I will continue to buy his CDs in the future.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It's a little graphic, but overall an excellent read.  Highly recommend it!  I look forward to more of her books in the future.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I bought this book a long, long time ago. It sat unread in my Kindle &#34;library&#34; for months. I had every intention of reading it but for some reason I didn't. I guess I was waiting until I was in the mood to read a book about a dog. Oh, how I wish I hadn't waited! Someone asked me the other day if I'd read this book, and when I said I had it but had not read it, she highly recommended I do so. I did.<br /><br />This is not so much a book about a dog as it is about life. Through a dog's eyes? Well, sort of. But only if that dog was a reincarnation of a great philosopher.<br /><br />To use a cliche of a review, this is a story about love, heartache, desperation and triumph. But the book itself is not cliche. Stein does a wonderful job of explaining, so even a layman can understand, the fine art and nuances of race car driving, and how that experience is a metaphor for living your life, through the turns and the straightaways and the obstacles every &#34;race&#34; throws in your path.<br /><br />I was reminded, more than once, of that fantastic book, 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,' as each of these stories deliver sometimes mundane but mostly profound life lessons using the relationship between man and machinery. For years I have been recommending 'Zen...' to people but many have found it a challenge, or too &#34; deep&#34; for a casual read. Admittedly it does take some work and commitment to get through. But &#34;The Art of Racing in the Rain&#34; teaches the same valuable lessons in a much more easily digested manner, in a much more relatable way. I gave this book five stars because, for me, it is engaging, humorous, serious, informative, thought-provoking: all qualities of a good read, and all reasons that make it worth the readers' while to spend a weekend devouring this book.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Its quite a challenge but I don't like that you keep needing to either back out of game and wait 1/2 hour or purchase more lives for $.99.
0553385461|4.0|As much as Mr. Hawking try to make us understand the concepts explained, these are so complex that frankly without a basis in physics and mathematics are difficult to understand. However, something we have, but rather the certainty that there is something we do not understand.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Get it now. I think you'll enjoy being a vampire. Just right for I'm going to keep playing all weekend Halloween fun!
B00881VLCE|5.0|The game is really cool if you like doing puzzles. There is one thing I don't like is that a couple of times it wouldn't load, but other than that, fantastic game.
0770435726|5.0|This double award winning mystery really appealed to me because part of the mystery was concerned around what the mystery was actually about, up until the final sentences of this different story. Basically we have an American family living in Europe--THE EXPATS.  Kate is the mother of two young boys, but she's also an ex CIA operative involved in some high level and questionable murders.  Her husband, Dexter, is an IT security genius, who is also a high level thief.  Both are living lies as they settle in Luxembourg, set their boys up in school, make new friends amongst the other expats, and take small trips around Europe. Neither parent believes the other one is anything but your typical American.<br /><br />Then they meet Julia and Bill, and things begin to be exposed between these four people who are not who they seem to be.  Julia and Bill are actually FBI pretending to be regular couple amongst other expats. The &#34;illegal secrets&#34; become mixed up with &#34;family secrets&#34;.  Even one of the young boys gets caught up in this. How will things get revealed safely?  How will the CIA and FBI solve their mysteries?  Who is everyone &#34;really&#34; when everything is revealed?  Will everything finally get revealed in the end?  Will everything end safely?<br /><br />I definitely believe this book deserved it's awards because it was not like any other book I've ever read.  The plot was deftly driven by the characters and timing of the revelations. The personal and private lives of CIA, FBI, and families made for a very compelling story line.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|This is a great game but the steering cars has a bit of problems please fix and ill rate 5 stars thanks but so far great game.
B008CLI4N4|2.0|product was in good condition, The shipping was right on time.  The series its self was well acted the story is great but the content w is horrible, disgusting, distasteful, disgraceful, and demeaning.  I have to skip more than half of the first episode.  Pornographic material should stay in the back of store room for the scum of the earth not in shelves among other good programing.  I should have research this series more thoroughly.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game! Fun simple and easy to play. I will be honest and say that I have probably lost sleep because of this game though. You really don't realize  how long you are playing it. Very fun!
B00DUGCLY4|1.0|It should give more options to pass!!  If you Can not figure out the clue you get stuck on the one forever there should be more options!!
B00AEBB8YW|5.0|It is a very romantic movie. I have both: the old version with Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart and this one, but I like the remake with Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond much more. Greg Kinnear is perfect for the role of David. If you are romantic, you'll love it too.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|This game is legit it is 100% real. I played  the first two levels and I knew it was real. I recommend this game.
B00D2ZF24O|3.0|Father and son are sole survivors of a crashed ship on a savage planet.  Strained relationship between the two is tested as they struggle to work together to live and seek rescue.<br /><br />Visually, impressive.<br />Story, weak.<br />Connection between father and son shows through in their interactions.<br />Still... the story is weak.<br />The constant threat mechanic is an interesting approach to a nemesis, but due to the nature of the beast, you know how the final confrontation will play out as soon as you are presented with the setup.<br /><br />Rentable, but do not buy it.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This game is awesome. Complete with vampires and all your fav Halloween characters. I mean who dosent love vampires. I sure do.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I bought this product for two purposes: additional gain with regular low-impedence headphones and also to boost the signal of my phone or DSi to line level for my car stereo's auxillary input. Given that it cost $28 at the time, I was not expecting the world.<br /><br />It performs these tasks well (I actually tend to use the non-flat \\"Blue\\" midrange boost most of the time, to compensate for road and engine noise) and spits out a firm sound, like crisp toast. It distorts/compresses transients in a way that's not harsh and is quite listenable. (You can of course avoid distortion by using the flat setting or the -3dB \\"Purple\\" setting). It boosts classical music sufficiently loud enough to listen to hear in the car.<br /><br />What makes it a game changer, though, is how it scrubs low quality inputs like my Gameboy micro, which has always been exceedingly noisy, and my 3DS, which is simply quiet, and boosts them to a clean, strong signal for either headphones or line-in. The sounds are crisp, placements have depth and space, and the noise floor is low (or low enough). I suppose this is technically not magic, and perhaps similar products do a good job as well, but I was not expecting an inexpensive headphone amp to be able to clean poor quality source signals. I assumed it could only work with what it was given and am happy to have been proven wrong.<br /><br />I am driving regular consumer headphones with this (Shure E3C, Panasonic RPHJE120K [which at $6 nonetheless sound better than the Shures], Sony V-6s and V-600s), and lining into my car stereo with $20 Acoustic Research cables.<br /><br />Turning it on/off takes some getting used to, and there is some noise when you charge off power from the same ground as the input device, but that's understandable.<br /><br />I am pleased, and take it with me everywhere.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|The iconic Sci-Fi classic on blue ray. You have got to see the transfer and the music and the sounds! A must have for any sci-fi fan.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Better than I expected...I still think I like the original better, but this version was better than I expected.  Leo did a great job acting as he always does.
B009X2CRMK|4.0|This was a great story, from present day to family history, very captivating. Easy to be there with them while your reading.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|It is very well done. The producers pay attention to detail, the characters are complex and interesting, there is action to move the plot along. Each season and every episode brings something new to the concept and builds the intensity of the theme. Very well done.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Anyone into John Grisham's novels delving into lawyer's 'trials and tribulation', (pun intended) will like this one.  I haven't read all of his novels, but this one spins more like a mystery than others I've enjoyed.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|great read, reminded me a bit of hunger games. can't wait to start book 2, I wonder what is next for Thomas and the rest of the surviving Gladers.
B00DZJ82W6|5.0|There is only one reason to spend the extra money to buy this version:  The Blu-Ray 5.1 audio disc.<br /><br />I had some \\"pre-buyer\\" fear that it might not be worth it.<br /><br />Well, it is.  It is amazing.  It is worth every penny.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent acting. Superb scenery. Very real. The dialogue was in keeping with the time. I hope the show continues through a few generations.

B00F87ZUYG|2.0|The luster of special effects is gone. Neither the plodding plot lines nor the mediocre acting can carry this series alone.

B0044DEAUA|5.0|It is clear and an unexpected feature is that it can read your messages.<br />I am buying one more for my other car.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|This novel was an easy read, even a little juvenile at times.  The characters were likeable but immature.  The storyline was too far fetched.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I enjoyed this game, it was fun.  It took some time and thought to complete but was well worth the effort.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|Beyond Bridalveil Fall is a brilliant story.  When Oria dives into a pool in Yosemite National Park she is transported to another world.  A world where she is Queen, a world filled with a huge range of fantastical colourful characters.  And this is where the author absolutely shines, the vivid other world, the real, almost tangible characters that she has created, I was completely drawn in.  I fell in love with all the characters, even the bad ones as they were so well depicted too.<br />The story is fast paced with some cracking action scenes. The story is an adventure, a fast rollercoaster ride to the brilliant end.<br />I loved the development of the relationships between Oria and the mystical characters, especially the love story between her and Grey Wolf.<br />Oria is a brilliant character, feisty, brave and I love the journey that she goes on, how she learns to develop her new powers, and these are some pretty cool powers and her discovery of this new world, her place in it and that she has to fight to protect the world she’s just left behind.<br />I’m finding it hard to shout about this book because I don’t want to give anything away, it really is a book that you need to read yourself.  It has it all, magic, super powers, shape shifters, adventure and love.  I quite simply devoured it.

I love Nicholas Sparks novels and he does the same thing but there is always a feeling of resolution and purpose. The lesson of this book is \\"life sucks and then you die. \\" gee thanks for the diversion.

B00ET2ODX0|4.0|I suppose being Bruce Lee's former teacher and someone who had made the martial art Wing Chun known around the world, the curiosity around his life became so strong that director Wilson Yip and Herman Yau had their turn in bringing his life to the big screen. Wilson Yip's \\"Ip Man\\" was a film with a lot of fiction around it, which focused entirely on action sequences with Donnie Yen in the title role. Herman Yau's \\"The Legend is Born: Ip Man\\" was an unspectacular martial arts drama but a little more subtle and certainly not as bombastic as Wilson Yip's films. Please take note that Wong Kar-Wai's rendition of Master Ip's life was never meant as a martial arts action flick.<br /><br />Well, finally the highly anticipated film about Ip Man directed by Wong Kar-Wai has finally arrived. A little different from his usual films, as the film goes for refreshing ideas and themes rather than decadent emotions, it is a film that has a lot of hype as with any other film directed by him. People should be aware that one needs to temper their expectations with Wong Kar-Wai's \\"The Grandmaster\\". It is a film about a true-to-life figure and is a period piece that brings the concept of how martial arts can apply to living. Wong Kar-Wai takes on a premise that he has not done before that his fans would have reason to celebrate. This review is based on the 130 minute film released in Asia, I have heard that another cut of the film was debuted internationally.<br /><br />1930s China. Ip Man (Tony Leung) is a rich, young martial arts master who does not want to compete and yet he finds himself thrust into the limelight as his peers push him into a sparring match with Chinese Martial Arts chairman Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang). The match was more technical than a display of skills as Ip Man asserts his inner will to get the best of Yutian. As a result, Yutian's daughter, Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi)  who is also a master in her own right of the 64 hands, issues a challenge to Master Ip as to restore her family's reputation. The two spar in a flow of rhythmic movements that almost looked like poetry. This is only the first few minutes of the film, as Wong Kar-Wai co-wrote the screenplay to include certain periods in Ip Man's life. If life has four seasons, then the first 20 years is spring, but then his life takes a turn to winter during the Sino-Japanese war.<br /><br />Wong Kar-Wai intentionally made the film to feel rather convoluted and episodic. Perhaps in an effort to express his themes and metaphors, and to cover as much of Ip Man's life as best he could. Wong does not primarily takes his focus on Master Ip's life, but rather he brings into the fold the way each period was in his life and how certain people have influenced his life both directly and indirectly. The writing in the film was definitely trying to bring forth the concept as to how the teachings of martial arts could be applied to the living of one's life, as Tony Leung clearly elaborates in the first few minutes in the film; \\"It is all about the horizontal and the vertical\\". I take it that one is left standing while the other is laying down in martial arts. Such is something that could certainly be seen in life. One stands while the other lays down, perhaps one needs to learn how to lay down in order to stand, and also at a mirror image, one needs to learn to lay down in order to stand.<br /><br />Wong Kar-Wai has some rather heavy themes going around here. There is much to take in the film, the dialogue is often filled with philosophical expressions and metaphors, but we all know that it is usually what a Wong Kar-Wai movie is all about. The characters in the film move about its themes, and while its structure felt a little loose, the resonance for each of them is pretty crystal clear. Ma San (Zhang Jin) and Gong Er make choices that often feel that they were based on emotions such as pride, anger, honor and love. The theme of vengeance that comes with the two, was something that keeps themfrom fully reaching the peak of kung fu. This brings into its narrative as to there are three levels that signify the highest achievement in martial arts: \\"being, knowing and doing.\\" This lesson comes from Master Gong to Ma San, and strongly expressed through Gong Er's life that she had taken a vow that kept her from becoming a wife and having children in order to avenge her father. Ma San and Gong Er chooses from a very straight-forward emotional level that chooses their destiny for them.<br /><br />Now, Master Ip also has potential for all these emotions, but he is more passive. His approach to life is a more peaceful one, as his love for Gong Er remained inside and that such a thing could not be in the past. Master Ip is married to Wing Sing (Song Hye-Kyo in a limited screen time) while Gong Er was engaged. Ip Man choose to rise above such desires and ambition, that he approaches life from a less than aggrandizing path. There is a subtle subversive message around its narrative, and yet it sees things from a humanist point of view. Life has its regrets, and yet, here, it is not something that drives its narrative but merely a consequence. Wong places the film's priorities on the world around the individual rather than what the individual does to the world.<br /><br />As with Wong Kar-wai's usual style, the film is very lush and a little pretentious. This is not a negative comment, but rather something that I have just grown to be fond of when it came to Wong's films. Wong uses slow-motion with overblown art direction and redolent details to bring the power, the beauty and the flair of the martial arts. All angles were utilized to display the moves and even some close ups to bring forth its effects and intensity. It is a true visual feast but I could've done without the `fighting in the rain' since it had been done so much in other films. The cinematography and the atmosphere of the film fit just should be expected of Wong Kar-Wai; this is after all a style all his own and what made him the renowned filmmaker that he is today.<br /><br />The screenplay in \\"The Grandmaster\\" is pretty strong, and yet it does not come with some issues. I mean, I know this is meant as a biopic, but one is left to wonder if this is Ip Man as seen through his eyes, or is it Master Ip as seen through Wong's viewpoint? I know the film's intentions was a less than fictional one, but really, it feels a little unfocused at times. The script takes some detours that I thought unnecessary, I was a little dumbfounded how a nationalist agent turned ass-kicking barber called \\"the Razor\\" could've made a good device to further Ip Man's transitions and yet he was only in three scenes. Chang Chen's the Razor was shamelessly used and felt like a `filler' since the film could've gotten along fine without him. I also thought that the narrative played a little too heavy on Zhang Ziyi's character rather than its supposed main protagonist.<br /><br />\\"The Grandmaster\\" could've easily been called \\"The Grandmasters\\" as in the plural form. It feels little unfocused to be a biopic on Master Ip, and truth be told, its messages could've easily been delivered in a film by any other director about a martial artist's journey experiencing the same things in the world. Tony Leung does a great job as the lead, as he felt a little smug and yet, tempered. Stoic, yet filled with emotions. His performance was certainly better than Donnie Yen's. It was also great to see Zhang Ziyi to once again do her thing; she was elegant, beautiful and graceful as always. Despite some flaws, \\"The Grandmaster\\" is a good film that deals with piety, humility and humanist ideas, and rather than using love as a driving force, it is a mere upshot.  It is about just what it means to stand upright, that how one chooses the right path is often the one left standing. This message is truly complete and grown-up that this film gets a High Recommendation from me. [4 ½ Out of 5 Stars]from fully reaching the peak of kung fu.

I do heavy programming (C#, C++, Python and Java) and this champ is able to handle everything I throw at it without any hick-ups.  I've had it for about 9-10 months now and haven't overclocked it yet (need some money for a better heat sink and better case fans).  I do recommend buying a after-market heat sink for it, because it's running fairly warm.  Other than that, this is an amazing processor.  I don't regret going with it at all.

It tells the story of characters caught up in addiction, love and family ties, and all are cleverly drawn together by the 'tightrope walker in the sky'. The characters are flawed, genuine, touching and very, very human, and their lives are original and intertwined, often connected by hope and the bonds between them.<br />It's a beautiful, powerful book with an elaborate story and I've never read anything like it.

B00BKZUVGM|2.0|Having thoroughly enjoyed Divergent and Insurgent, I was so looking forward to Allegiant. However, I did not find the novel an enjoyable read. I did not like the chapters alternating between Tobias and Tris, though I guess it was understandable considering the ending. One reason was that I could barely tell the difference in the tone between the two, and I also felt that the first two novel's flowed better because it was Tris alone narrating.  I felt that 'Under the Never Sky' did the perspective shift chapters much more successfully.<br /><br />And compared to the first two novels, I found Allegiant to be anti-climatic and almost completely lacking in suspense. For example, the Death Serum scene was about a single page. The scenes with serums in the first two novels were long and suspenseful. And the scene which so many readers hate so much, regarding the demise of a central character, was rushed and vague. I also felt that too much information was dumped through conversations held in the first half of the book that seemed to have little other purpose.<br /><br />I understand that the first novel is being turned into a movie, for which it is well suited. I cannot see how Allegiant could be turned into a movie unless it was changed significantly, for there is no substance to it. Repetitive talks about being 'genetically damaged,' spending most of the book milling about in the Bureau without achieving anything, and nothing being done with the divergents who emerged.<br /><br />One of the most frustrating aspects of the novel was that the previous book made it look like the divergents would save the world from endless strife, perhaps emerging as leaders of a post apocalyptic, fallen world. Yet when they did come out, nothing special was done with them at all. Not even with Tris who could resist all simulations. It cheapened the first two novels, making me wonder, what was the point of it all?<br /><br />One good point about the novel was stressing that 'genetically damaged' people are still just as whole as 'genetically pure,' and that we cannot justify people's bad behaviour by saying that being 'genetically damaged' was the reason.<br /><br />A good theme running through the book was that although people damage each other, this is not a reason to despair, for people can help to heal each other of those damages as well.<br /><br />The reason for the reconciliation between Caleb and Tris was one of the highlights of the novel, I felt.maged' people are still just as whole as 'genetically pure,' and that we cannot justify people's bad behaviour by saying that being 'genetically damaged' was the reason.<br /><br />A good theme running through the book was that although people damage each other, this is not a reason to despair, for people can help to heal each other of those damages as well.<br /><br />The reason for the reconciliation between Caleb and Tris was one of the highlights of the novel, I felt.

B00498YZH8|3.0|(Spoilers included)  I really don't see why there were so many rave reviews over this movie. Overall it sucked. Not because it wasn't a good plot. The plot was good and so was the acting. But it sucked bc it took 40 minutes before any real action or the real solving of the crime began. For 40 minutes it was the main character cooking for her siblings, combing her mom's hair, going to a house to listen to country music,her talking to her high school friend who has a baby about her missing dad and they may be kicked off their land, to killing a squirrel etc etc. They shud have had an action scene at the very beginning like the dad being killed then move into the boring day to day stuff. Then I might have given it four stars. But the average film goer dsnt want to watch boring stuff for 40 min before they get to the real action. I only gave it three stars bc once they got to the action it wasn't all that bad and it was interesting.

0156027321|2.0|The Life of Pi did make me think - which is the ultimate test of a book. It made me consider, ponder, evaluate. I liked it for those reasons.<br /><br />It was also long, boring, and I fell asleep multiple times while reading it. Like the author says at one point: &#34;The hours last forever. You are so bored sink into a state of apathy close to a coma.&#34;<br />Yep - that describes the story, and how it feels to read it. But the ending was unique and intriguing - so it was worth it.<br /><br />The author has great knowledge of animals, the sea, zoos, survival needs, etc... These made his tale realistic and insightful to read.<br /><br />It's a castaway story, but it's told better than most. First of all - there is a Bengal tiger on the boat. That's a pretty cool way to keep the story interesting. I think the Tiger's name is dumb and a bit forced, but, oh well, it works.<br /><br />The beginning of the book is great. The tale of Pi's name, growing up in a zoo, learning from his father about animals, how zoo's work, and what respect to give to animals.<br /><br />It's exhilarating, fun, and draws you in.<br /><br />The next part I felt was out of place and was the &#34;gimmick&#34; to draw press, media, and book clubs.<br /><br />Pi is a young man who starts living faithfully as a Muslim, Hindu, and Christian. He goes to all their religious services, prays to all their gods, and believes all of them.<br /><br />That was my main problem with the book. It's like the author couldn't write a great castaway story that could stand on it's own. So he picked something that would grab media attention (like a main character who follows 3 major religions).<br />It was a cheap trick and it detracted from the book.<br /><br />- The ending is what makes it all worth it. There is a genius twist that makes you think, and think, and think. I loved it.<br /><br />I can give this recommendation: Read it if you have time and can borrow it from someone. Don't go out and buy it.<br /><br />Here are my favorite Quotes:<br /><br />&#34;It is on the inside that God must be defended, not on the outside.&#34;<br />&#34;The main battlefield for good is not the open ground of the public arena but the small clearing of each heart.&#34;<br />&#34;A castaway’s worst mistake is to hope too much and do too little.&#34;/>Here are my favorite Quotes:<br /><br />&#34;It is on the inside that God must be defended, not on the outside.&#34;<br />&#34;The main battlefield for good is not the open ground of the public arena but the small clearing of each heart.&#34;<br />&#34;A castaway’s worst mistake is to hope too much and do too little.&#34;

This is the  only book series that tell me the real Buddhism is, amazing, isn't it? Yes but I have to say after years of searching, I finallhy find the gate to the real answer. Thank you Gary that give me the opportunity to know and practice ACIM.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Has anyone got the latest update because on my other phone I have google play store and it has already updated and on amazon it hasn't updated yet...
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Predictable story line. Pretty good CG work. I have never played the game so I can not compare them to each other.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|Not like they said it would be they said it would be like the unlimited but no its like the limited so dont get it if you want the unlimited. plus they want you to pay to change your charachter
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is electric!! I've read it twice and it was just as good the second time around!! You hate both characters but find yourself rooting for them at different points in the book. This is by far Flynn's best book!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is fun to play and gets to be very addictive.  The only thing I don't like is always being asked to buy things.  I know that is the point to make money, but you can get stuck on a level and the only way to get past it is to buy some help.  Still, it is a fun way to pass the time and I recommend it to everyone to play.
B0039PPW60|1.0|Wont ever buy another product from Behringer again. This unit lasted about 9 months before the volume knobs stopped working.
0142410705|3.0|Not my favorite John Green book. It didn't force me to think, like his other books, and was a bit slow. it was kind of predictable and somewhat boring, compared to his other works. It was a good book, just not fantastic.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this is a lot of fun and challenging enough to hold your interest. very happy with it and fun for the kids
014241493X|5.0|My second favorite John green book. It was thought-provoking, laugh-out-loud funny and excellently, engagingly written!<br />You won't be disappointed! And inspiration.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|... Got the free app for my Kindle, now I don't have to be stuck at my desk on the computer!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Very light and lovely to see so no problem to wear as keyrings, and it does its job very well with my knives
B00005JKZV|5.0|We have been collecting the Lord of the Rings movies and somehow missed this one when it was released. Amazon offered it at a decent price so we were able to Add it to our collection.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book because  it was like a cliffhanger at the end. I couldn't wait to read part two. Great book! Hope book two will be better.
1451673442|5.0|This is a great book that might just change your Life.  However, it only works if you do what it suggests.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It was like rereading the first book again until I got to the last three chapters. In my opinion this book (2nd book) should have been  included in book one.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He loves it.  I can't get him off of the TV now.  :)
0525478817|1.0|I'm not a Nerdfighter. I don't really follow John Green, so I don't love him and I don't hate him. I'm just a graduate student who has been inexplicably fascinated by cancer since middle school.<br />A lot of my friends and family started telling me about this book and how I should read. &#34;Just don't read it in public,&#34; they warned, &#34;because you WILL cry.&#34; Being a sucker for sob stories and cancer stories, I gave it a shot. I didn't have a lot of expectations for it. I just heard it was good and decided to try it for myself.<br /><br />This book tries way too hard not to be a &#34;cancer book,&#34; which is described in the novel as an uplifting story of someone with cancer who fights bravely until the end, starts a foundation to help other kids with cancer, and then dies. Honestly, I've never read a cancer book like that. And books about cancer are a lot about books about dogs: someone is going to die. And when I saw it was stage 4 cancer patient Hazel performing a first-person narration, I knew it wasn't going to be her.<br /><br />The cancer in this book is WAY too convenient. I have never had cancer, and my father's skin cancer was taken care of with one surgery, but doesn't having cancer- especially such an advanced cancer- mean a lot of doctors' appointments? Neither of these kids experience anything beyond mild fatigue until the author wants to evoke emotion. Hazel does have a scare near the beginning of the book, but she's fine and goes to Amsterdam THE NEXT WEEK.<br /><br />These are kids who have, out of necessity, spent most of their lives in total isolation. They've been in hospitals, lost limbs, been face-to-face with death, and yet they aren't afraid, or exhausted, or coping with anything at all. They might as well have bronchitis. Another reviewer who was actually diagnosed with cancer points out that they scoff at group therapy (realistic) but stop there (unrealistic). Until one of them actually dies, they just quote poetry at each other.<br /><br />That brings me to the biggest problem of the book: people will say over and over that having a terminal illness makes you grow up faster and be wiser and more observant, etc, but these kids do not have one shred of real dialogue. They don't act like teenagers at all. They don't act like realistic people at all. They quote books and poetry at each other and the AIRLINE lets them drink just so they can have some line about drinking stars. They put unlit cigarettes between their teeth and make out in the Anne Frank house and have sex and there's no sense of teenage awkwardness or anything.<br /><br />They're annoying. They're pretentious. And when you combine that with the fact that the cancer is just a crude device used to illicit emotion out of teenagers, I didn't cry when one of the characters died. I couldn't. I never connected enough to.<br />The only parts of the book that came close to getting a tear out of me were the ones with Hazel and her mother. The mother is I guess a pretty typical portrayal of a &#34;Cancer Mom&#34; (they deserve the capitalization) who has become very protective of her child after, you know, the cancer the reader never had to deal with.<br /><br />The romance between Hazel and Augustus seemed to be built on notes taken from Twilight. How do they meet? He shows up at support group and stares at her. He tells her she looks like Natalie Portman and she quotes some existential stuff about oblivion from some stupid vaguely postmodern book (which is also a crude plot device) and it's love. That's it. She has some reservations because she has been declared terminal, but she throws those out the window because, well, he's hot and likes her. And also the cancer doesn't really matter.<br /><br />The book had some quotable stuff: Pain demands to be felt. Illness repulses. My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations. But it's shoved into a context that is unrealistic and forced and contrived (&#34;why do eggs have breakfast exclusivity?&#34; whines supposedly-teenage-Hazel).<br /><br />I have tried to write short stories about cancer patient. I only got close to being comfortable with the whole thing once. It's a difficult thing to do. Writing about an illness is almost impossible unless you've been there yourself. I'm not a cancer patient, but I feel like cancer patients are probably offended by this book.
B00BEIYP1W|5.0|A story of fierce rivalry in 1976 season of F-1 between charming and naturally talented James Hunt and very systematic, technical, precise and dedicated Niki Lauda. True story. Vivid characters. Unbelievable courage.
068484267X|3.0|I'm honestly torn between a 3 and 4-star rating on this book. When I read it in 2005 I absolutely adored it. I read it when I was a little bit older and still really liked it. The story told is pretty believable, especially for a family in the Great Depression. But I began researching the controversy surrounding this memoir after McCourt's death and found out that people who are actually Irish HATE this book because of the negative stereotypes it enforces so strongly (father drinking the paycheck, etc). What's more is that people who grew up with him say that the family wasn't too bad off.<br />As a book, it's excellent. However, I cannot vouch for its accuracy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its great to see this app available on the Kindle....finally! It appears to work as it should and I haven't had any issues with the game<br />.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this game is great so long as you do not mind waiting for your items to be built but the wait isn't too long
B001MTENOC|4.0|This is a fantastic book as a follow up to the earlier books by Brian Weiss. It corroborates many spiritual truths as mentioned in ancient texts such as Bhagvad Gita, Vedas and also more recent spiritual developments like Theosophy. It was heartening to find that many of my own personal experiences and earliest memories explained by other subjects in the case studies in presented book. Michael Newton has done a tremendous job in presenting this book through the case history method. It will be interesting if some scientific validations of some of the recent past life regressions (at least the more recent life ones) are done by someone as a follow up to this work.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to all readers who are curious to know where we come from and where we headed.
0141335750|4.0|It's a birthday present that my granddaughter is really looking forward to reading.  So it must be very good indeed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|As the others, I've been waiting for a version of the game be made available for the Kindle. And it goes past 425. YEAH!!!  I am so addicted to this fun game and I suggest it for all ages. The vibrant colors and different obstacles are too many to mention.
B005PK56TA|3.0|It's a good show.  Jessica Lange is great but I think the current season is much better.  The addition of Kathy Bates is A+*+++
B0089LOG02|5.0|I found this book to be very interesting. I had heard of the Orphan Trains and the trials of the children who came West. The author did very well telling both stories at the same time and blending them together to show how Vivian and Molly were alike in so many ways.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This program allows me to open Word and other Office program attachments on my Kindle seamlessly. Makes my Kindle Fire HD the go-to device for email.
B00F2362IE|5.0|I give it 5 stars because it is fun and it is fun because you get to knock evil creatures out
B00C5R8364|3.0|It is not a bad book, but it is not up to the standards of some of Forsyth's earlier works.
B0027MJU00|1.0|The book is well written, it's just not my kind of reading. It's much too dark and depressing. The characters are not the type your able to care about, or feel empathy for.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|5 stars! So fun! Couldn't put it down, and I hope so bad that they make more! I was so sad when I beat the game because it meant there were no more levels to play! I highly recommend it to anyone of all ages! It's a fun, cute strategy game! I played on the way home from a road trip with some friends and for 3 hours I was playing the game with them looking over my shoulder suggesting things to try! ^_^ Get it now! Its so fun!
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I'm a very big Halo fan. I've played all of the games and just now getting around to reading the books. This book shows the other side of what was going on during the conflict of Reach. It fill in a lot of the missing pieces the video game doesn't explain. For instance, what happens to Jun after he leaves Reach with Halsey. The book doesn't exactly come out and say it but, saying her S-II escort was killed gives it away. The books also make you realize the Spartans aren't as strong as the games portray them to be. Nice to find out how Cortana and the Chief first meet. Overall a very good novel and I look forward to reading the rest.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|BEST GAME EVER!!!! I love this game so much, don't waste anymore time doubting whether or not you should buy it! Get it now! You will not regret it and will find yourself buying Kingdom Rush Frontiers as soon as you finish! I wish there were even more after Frontiers!! Get it now! So fun, 10 stars!!!!!! :)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this is a very nice game I play it on my friend ipad I love this game and it&rsquo;s free
B00F35BV64|1.0|very mediocre!
B00B2FLDRQ|5.0|It's funny, perceptive and well written.  I laughed out loud throughout and although I did guess the end, there were still some twists.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This is the best game EVER because it's hilarious.  The ways you die are stupid and funny because it's soooooo dumb to pull toast out of a toaster with a fork or you drive in front of a train.  AWESOME!!!
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|I got this charger after buying rabish ones this one is got in quality and construction ideal with a fast port and two for a time
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Another VERY smart game.  It hurts my brain!  It FEEDS my brain!  It's only not five stars because it's a bit slow-paced because there is no time clock or time restraints.  You can take as long as you want.  A countdown would make it more exciting.  But this is an intriguing and genius game!!
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|i could hardly put this book down, though it did slow a bit in the middle.  Alma is such an unusual but fully human character. Loved the historical background of the 19th century.  Engrossing writing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|What can you say that hasn't already been said about MINECRAFT!  I love building.  I love exploring.  I love battling.  It's like being the god of a Lego world with creepers and skeletons and dragons.  GREAT STUFF.
6305127697|4.0|Primal Fear (Gregory Hoblit, 1996)<br />[originally posted 13Jul2000]<br /><br />It amazes me that Hoblit could have turned in a film debut like this and gone on to make Fallen and Frequency, but then Savage Steve Holland made Better off Dead..., too.<br /><br />Aaron Stampler, an altarboy (Edward Norton, in his first role), is found with the body of the head of the church at which he works, Archbishop Richard Rushman (Stanley Anderson). He protests his innocence and is believed by no one, but an ambulance-chasing lawyer named Martin Vail (Richard Gere) is willing to take his case. As time goes on, Vail becomes convinced of his client's innocence.<br /><br />Typical lawyer drama, like watching a two-hour episode of Law and Order—and it's just as good. Edward Norton deservedly picked up a Best Supporting Actor nom. The chemistry between the defense team—Gere, Andre Braugher, and Maura Tierney—is wonderful. Frances MacDormand turns in her usual excellent performance as the defense's psychiatrist. John Mahoney and Terry O'Quinn, as the hands behind the prosecutor's back pulling the strings, are appropriately slimy characters.<br /><br />And the ending... the ending compares with that of The Usual Suspects. Even if the rest of the movie were awful, it'd be worth renting simply for the ending. Watch and be amazed at how perfectly you were played. And then sit and wonder what happened to Gregory Hoblit. ****
B0018RC7QE|5.0|This movie is definitely my dream come true!  I love this movie and seems as though it was written for me.  It couldn't be more fitting!  This movie is both, charming and entertaining...The acting is impeccable and the story line applies to many.  I would highly recommend this movie if you want to watch a movie with a fantastic ending!  Warning...It is a bit of a tear jerker, but the ending is perfect!  Thank you writers for a great story when there are so few available.  This movie has it all!  An easy five stars!!!!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Awesome show... love watching it.<br /><br />I'm a law student so love courtroom dramas, it is so real and one can learn different ways of investigation
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|My 13 year old was extremely scared...which was the point in watching it on Halloween night. She says 4 stars.
0984999302|4.0|Excellent guide for adding structure to innovation and better understanding and implementing lean startup / customer discovery tools. Easy to skim - more of a reference book than a book you read end-to-end.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|great movie with plenty of action daniel craig didn't loose a step in his role as James Bond thumbs up for this movie
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Good movie! Production value is excellent! Great price! No complaints here. I look forward to purchasing more 3D titles from Amazon.
B00AQSN7HE|5.0|great movie! highly recommended a lot of action and daniel craig is off the chain the action scenes were fantastic awesome!
B005LAII80|4.0|I watched the 2D version on DVD when it came out and I liked it so I bought the 3D version when I got a 3D tv. The 3D version is far superior and definitely the way it should be viewed.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|I love love love this album!!! I listen to it everyday still from release date. Great work on this album!!!

B0064X7FVE|4.0|The Weather Channel app is has good graphics and visuals. It gives you maps. directions. and better yet it gives me the weather. I suggest you buy this app.
B007XF0X6G|4.0|I saw this movie in 2D at the theater and didn't think much of it. Now that I have it for my 3D tv, it's awesome! 3D is definitely the way to go when viewing this movie.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is the app you need if you want the books at your fingers where ever you go. Get it.
0767810856|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  A real chick flick but it is nice just to have a decent show to watch.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|got a chance to see the end of the story, got see the whole understanding from the beginning to the end.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Well done, once again, Rick riordan. Amazing suspense and crazy turns of events, all leading up to the ending. Since this review requires two more words....<br /><br />Goodbye Percabeth.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|this is a new character but in some ways a little potter is in it, I enjoyed movie, yet very different
B00G32TD98|5.0|Very scary, and yet a very good message.  This is not a senseless horror movie, but one that will engage your senses, and soul.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I watch all the episodes. I really appreciate the great season four story lines and activity. Very entertaining. Love the show. My favorite new series! Downloaded to my Kindle take it with me and watch it everywhere!Thanks for making it so easy to have Amazon!
B00DWZHTRW|1.0|You don't have to get very far into this movie before its suckiness is apparent. I would say that once the building is lit with the suit of the card the woman picks you start to get suspicious. After Woody Harrelson is able to magically extract 250 bucks from two tourists you're able to see that the trick would be if you were able to watch any more of the movie.<br />Implausible, corny, terrible direction, poor camera work, crappy acting--- pick one, any one.
B00594XOZU|3.0|I've read most of the reviews and I certainly do agree that someone seriously needs to upgrade Kik&hellip; or at least the Kindle Fire/HD version.<br />Most of my concerns deal with settings on Kik. The Kindle Fire HD version doesn't have a settings button so you can change your profile name or profile period, sign in or sign out, and doesn't allow you to block someone either. I wish I downloaded this app when it actually worked. It works on iPhones and iPods but the Kindle Fire HD version doesn't work. But one thing I do like about this app is the fact that it's completely free with NO Fees or Ads!<br />#Update kindle fire version #Upgrade period
B0066W1AZK|3.0|This app does not show last move (from one square to another).  It also does not provide a list of pieces captured.  Your full attention is required, no multi-tasking.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is so awesome&middot;there is a ton of awesome updates&middot; You will love this<br />Version I am Mathew and this is my opinion
1476747016|5.0|I had pre-ordered this book and was so happy when it finally arrived! It's actually a pretty thick book with hilarious Pusheen comics of her antics that are common among all cats! I've only looked through half of the book so far because I don't want it to end! I don't know how some reviewers say they expected more out of this book; I think it's perfection!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really like the book, but the ending was a let down. I like how the book went from his side to her side.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Remake of Godzilla films - including the usual screaming character stating the obvious &#34;It's Godzilla&#34; over and over -- all the film needs is Ramond Burr as the hot shot reporter.<br /><br />Same old tire script - disgraced / discarded leading actor comes back and save the day - comedy nerd team helps the leading actor - actors with bad Russian and Australian accents get killed leaving the leading actor to win over the leading lady.<br /><br />Even the special effects are just blah.<br /><br />Wish the hollywood people would get fresh material .<br /><br />Use the rental for 2.00 and watch it once or wait till it gets dumped on DVD
B000SEIK2S|5.0|If Ray Kurzweil, Stephen Hawking and Stephen King had a baby and he wrote s book. Loved it on many levels. Very enjoyable read and highly recommend. Apparently - but not shockingly - going to be made into a movie.  Curious to see how they accomplish that, but looking forward to it either way.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Gladwell at his best.  Unexpected insights presented in interesting, highly readable ways.  As always he presents new angles on questions you thought had been anaweres
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I felt this final book was a bit drawn out and it took longer to get through for me than normal.<br />In all fairness maybe a second read would change my opinion ... I was. Bit disappointed in ending as well
B001NHNG64|5.0|This was my second Lee Child book and both have been very well written and left me wanting to read more Jack Reacher
B00EAI9CSY|5.0|A very creative and interesting take on vampires! The movie has a lot of atmosphere, and the actors put out great performances. One of the best vampire movies I've seen, mainly because the two main characters are strong women with an even stronger bond between them. Highly recommended!
1400049628|5.0|Got this as a gift, and they loved it! Very informative and was a great gag gift! A great buy!
B001GA1RFA|3.0|What I really love about John Green is his ability to keep an audience going. His writing style flows so we'll from the page, that sometimes I forgot that I wasn't too into the story.<br />For some reason I just couldn't get into Colin's love life. Maybe it's because I've never been an \\"Dumpee.\\" Either way I found The Fault in Our Stars more interesting all around, and more emotional, that maybe the reason I wasn't impressed is because  I was slightly disappointed.<br />Either way the book is a quick read and I wouldn't deter anyone from reading it. Green has a real talent for writing.
0694011479|5.0|Needed this for a class but I'm glad that I can keep this for personal use as well! Great book!
B004JMY312|4.0|It was a good movie, just too predictable...maybe I am getting jaded...Bette Midler was the perfect witch and Sarah Jessica Parker was the perfect ditzy sister. I loved them all...
B009YU62H2|5.0|This is another great album from a great band! Been listening to them since the grunge era. Would recommend this album to any rich listeners.
B003TOP7RK|5.0|I loved the show and watched it faithfully through the last season...would've loved to see what she did in London...
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Just a great story. Make a great movie. Had no clue from the beginning where this story was going, kept me thinking ahead all the time.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Anker is well known for it back up battery chargers for digital devices. But they have just come out with a new dual port car charger. It is calibrated for both Apple and Android products given that they use different voltages.<br />One port is for Android devices and out puts 5 volts at 2.1 amps. The other port is for IOS devices and puts out 5 volts at 2.1 amps. The charger is 18 watts at 3.6 amps. It's a turbo charger to boot, which means that your devices will get filled up faster.<br />You are going to have to use your own USB cables, but that shouldn't be a problem. This is a great solution if you have both Apple and Android devices, or it you have passengers with a different operating system than you use.<br />If you are looking for a car charger, Anker has the answer in this sleek model. It comes in white and costs just $9.99. You can easily spend twice as much on a charger with half the functionality.

B004L9MFM2|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Absolutely hate the death of my favourites and it's a different book to first in that it's a lot more about war grimness and death however still couldn't stop reading. Downloading next book now as am quite addicted.
0802473156|5.0|Loved this book! One of the best I've read!  Very informative and helpful! It gives wonderful insight! Recommend to couples everywhere!
B003B02O0A|5.0|I enjoy the way he tells a story. One thing always stands out is the absence of profanity. It in not needed for the story to be great.  His characters actually speak English. Most people I know speak this way. It makes the characters and the story real.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is a bit tricky but its all in the skills you have with problem solvi&ntilde;g and the knowledge you already have
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I started reading because all my friends who read said it was a great book. I just was nervous about the sex scenes... which were very descriptive but taking away those, the book kept new interest to know what Ana will do.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|The movie was fragmented and the dialog was heard to hear.  Tom Cruise is far from my favorite actor or person.
B00D2MC8WG|5.0|Under Dudamel's direction, the most mundane pieces spring to life.  When he conducts a work as stirring as Zarathustra, the hairs on the back of your neck standout from the electricity in the area. This is a wonderful recording that would be even fuller on vinyl. You might not be comfortable with Nietzche's idea of the ubermensch, but we should value the young superconductors who produce such varied and stirring sounds.
B00D2BHO44|5.0|The music alone is as moving as the game was. You might get a bit teary eyed. A wonderful soundtrack.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game rocks! to much fun to be had with endless challenge and fun. recommend this title for all ages. cantget enough.
B008602KQI|4.0|Very good movie showing a stark contrast between good and evil, compassion and brutality. Excellent acting by Jennifer Lawrence and her co-stars.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great time suck. Very addictive! Nothing easy about this game. I don't buy the helpers, I just keep trying and trying again
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|This book has it all. It has laughs, it has cries-although those are from laughing so hard you start to cry. I've been a fan of Allie Brosh's since ~2010, back when her blog posts included actual pictures, along with her cartoons. I remember when the \\"Dinosaur\\" was in her home. She has a way of making you feel like you're her friend. That you are both in this crazy thing called life together. Exploits with Simple Dog and Helper Dog make you feel the pain of having an animal that doesn't quite reach expectations-and you adore them no matter what. This book is a must read for anyone who likes to laugh, who likes dogs, and who can appreciate a woman whose journey is far more crazy and interesting than our own.
0385366752|4.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly and found it very hard to take a break from listening to do other things especially as I got further along in the book. The ending was surprising and I must say a part of me was somewhat disappointed. I somehow wondered if there would be a part 2.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Good for the brain---makes you think.  Good for any age. Challenging but not frustrating. No need to buy extras. Love it
B003S6T62Q|1.0|I am completely disappointed!!! I can not leave an actual opinion because my cd never played and so I have no real opinion on the actual music. Greatly disappointed.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's fun, relaxing, and maybe challenging. I can breed many dragons and get a ton of cash. Though I wish there were more stuff to quest and more stuff to cover my islands, I mean I have a completely empty island.

B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I really loved the world building in Matched, and looked forward to the continuation of the story, but was hoping to be done with the love triangle, because I just don't like love triangles in books overall.<br /><br />Crossed follows Cassia and Ky (chapters from both viewpoints) as they are sent out to the Outer Provinces, and escape to the Carving in order to find one another and possibly the Rising.  There are new characters introduced that I assume may be in the next book (at least one that I suspect will be in book 3).  You learn little more about the world, and there is just a lot of walking/running/not really any progress in the story.  After reuniting Cassia starts thinking about Xander and maybe she made a mistake (uh, what?  I know she cared for him, but she pretty much chose Ky in book one and she was just reunited with him and had a disagreement...whatever).  I'd like to see how the story ends, but I hope book 3 has a bit more in it to move the plot forward.

B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Well written, clear arguments, imposing knowledge, concise. Mr Dawkins is a lot less derogatory than his critics imply and seems have no issue with opposing views.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Really good for learning thru baby steps! Best for busy people with little time but have a few minutes each day!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|It's amazing that we've gone this long without discovering how much we like this very civilized TV series. In contrast to other action series we have been watching, it's amazing how compelling and suspenseful this drama can be without a steady diet of violence, gore and sex.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|the graphics are amazing and the rooms really make you think to solve them, instead of just mindless babble! Can't. wait for the next chapter!
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|I have been enjoying this series. While the weekly story is good, there is enough of some underlining stories that keep it interesting. I don't know if the series will get picked up but hope it does.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I got this as a free app, but would defiantly pay for it. Very fun and challenging! Look forward to other games from this maker!
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|This was a good movie, I really enjoyed it.  It was a prequal to the Wizard of oz, very interesting.  I don't this is going to be a hit with children.
B00FOU1O3S|4.0|I remember this from my old computer games and had to see if it was the same..  Fun and entertaining.  Easy to play and control.  Nice colorful graphics.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Works great on My Tablet. No problems as yet. Does everything that it is supposed to do, and does it all very well!!
0061714402|5.0|For any Megadeth fan it's a must read. The book is great, although I do wish it went into more detail on some things. Although it was great to hear Dave's side of the story without having it be an interview.<br /><br />I think the book was well written, it's a good read. I really wished the book was longer. I would read over 1000 pages if there was that many.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|How often is it that the word &#34;epic&#34; can be considered the mere surface of what the word describes? In describing Dune, epic merely brushes the dust off the floor.<br /><br />This has been my second time through the book, and my second time was no less better than the first -- if not better. For within the story between the two covers sits a novel among no others. The heart-gripping, psychological, political, and religiously weaved book is truly an art like none else. In my opinion, surpassing the story line of the epics: Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />Becoming immersed into the life and experience of the young Paul Atreides, Lady Jessica, Duke Leto, their loyal subjects, the desert-hardened Fremen, and the opposition from the terrible Harkonnens and Imperium will leave you feeling the wonder and marvel of Dune -- being hungry and thirsty for more.<br /><br />Dune falls nowhere short of being considered an epic above epics. The extent to which Dune captures the very depths of the human experience is truly admiring.<br /><br />&#34;When all of the good stories have been told, the series will end. But that will not really be a conclusion, because we can always go back to Dune itself and read it again and again.&#34; ~ Brian Herbert
0060989157|5.0|Great book from a great band.<br /><br />I love how they started from the beginning when everyone was still a child. I liked how each member wrote their own part of the book. I'll admit it was somewhat confusing at first but it call came together quickly.<br /><br />Some of the things in the book were outright crazy, some things I did not need to know at all about the members of the band. Although it makes up Motley Crue, without those stories they would not have been the band they are. At points I was laughing out loud, then I felt like crying especially about Vince's daughter.<br /><br />The books goes into each members personal lives and into the band which was great I really liked reading reach members story about a single moment.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best bingo game app on Amazon!!! I choose this one over the other ten I have downloaded everyday!!! :)
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|My favorite &#34;Kipling&#34; book. Getting ready to read it to my niece. Loading it to my Kindle should make the process easier.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I enjoyed the journey of Asha discovering her heritage and the true meaning of family biological or not.  I also feel like I understand what it is like to be a women in India.  Thanks for the story,
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I read the first two books, eating them up. Loved them! Could not put them down. Not only did this book fail to draw me in I hated the ending! How can you start a series with one character and end it with another? Waist of time and money
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It's a fun game but,  zooming in on the hidden objects isn't very helpful if you have problems with your vision. Which makes the timing nerve racking!  But over all I. like this game.
B00CNIDGVW|5.0|First and foremost, I am reviewing this movie for a) its conent, and b) its video quality (from the perspective of 4K or UHD).<br /><br />This movie is one of the most negatively received blockbusters of all time. For many people this is simply because it shows an original re-imagining on a very old character. Whereas \\"Godzilla\\", the original 1956 movie, was very well received by people of that time (and even now), its concept was too unoriginal for a modern movie. So why not re-imagine a character that had been around (at that time) for 40 years, and create something that was not just a monster, but was an animal that was not violent or cruel, but was simply distructive because of its size? And instead of using the metaphor that Godzilla was the atomic bomb like the original movie, why not make the character a metaphor for the aftereffects of using an atomic bomb, the destruction that the radiation causes? Furthermore, why not make that monster--which was not really a monster, but a scared animal with emotions and feelings--suffer for its creation because it threatened to unintentially harm us? There is a multitude of different levels of depth in this story, and it has always been there, but many people failed to see this simply because they admired the original movie so much that creating anything other than that version of a Godzilla was mocking or dishonoring it. But that is not true. The makers of this film did not intent to offend fans of the original movie, but to add depth to a character that was seemingly one dimensional. In my opinion, that was far from a mistake, but a large triumph. Overall, based soley on its content, I would give this movie a 4.5/5 because of the depth that it added that many people have failed to see.<br /><br />Switching gears to the 4K (UHD) video quality, I must say that I am very quite impressed. Remastering movies can be hard, sometimes there errors that are made, slight deviances from the original image, but this is not the casewith this movie. It's very much one of the best 4K remasterings that I have seen, granted that there will be more in the future. It is very crisp and clear, and for this, I give it a 5/5.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is very thought prevoking, though some will deny it, and the quality is truly amazing. Definately 5/5 from me.
B00CEQ1JOO|4.0|I just got her for my daughter today. We bought her at a store and she was $19.99, so the $13.99 price is great and worth it. She is my daughter's first MH doll, but we loved her personality and color scheme. Her hair isn't very shiny, and her bangs are kind if stiff, but other than that, she is exquisite. My daughter was amazed to see her eyes glow in the dark! The included doll stand is nice, too.
B006PZBRCY|5.0|My 7 year old can watch this over and over again. It is such a great story line that he understands.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Broadchurch, BBC? TV David Tennant<br />Excellent opener to a series that has much potential. I just hope it doesn't bog down.
B00FRMDH7Y|5.0|Great movie for the kids and adults. Lots of funny parts with both adult and kid humor. Never got bored.
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|I have to go with what every one else is saying. I get what Helen Fielding is doing, it's a bold choice to kill off a beloved character.  However...I couldn't get over the huge issues with the time frame of the book. I haven't gotten back to the original to check but I thought the first book took place around the year 2000 and Bridget was in her mid to late 20's.  But just (about) 15 years later we find her in her early 50's with two children she would have had to have in her late 40's?<br /><br />I do wish they'd spent more time developing the relationship with Mr Wallaker it just seemed tossed in at the end to either make up for her grief the whole book or to provide a reason for yet another book.  Not sure.<br /><br />Overall it was good, the grief was very clearly and very well articulated  I just think there should have either been a little more backstory and a little more details about how she ended up with Wallaker.
B00DJ80VMM|5.0|I was a little skeptical of all the hype for the new DT - the fact that it's self-titled added to the feeling that the band/record company were trying to hype up this reinvention of a band that, frankly, I was expecting &#34;more of the same&#34; from.  And, the truth is somewhere in between.  After a dozen albums and over 2 decades on the scene, I think I know what to expect from Dream Theater - amazing chops, elaborate songs mixing 80s metal and progressive rock influences with a little bit of an attempt to incorporate &#34;modern&#34; sounds and styles.  And, pretty much every album has followed this style (&#34;Six Degrees&#34; being the one which most noticeably pushed their sound, to great effect), with enough variety and experimentation to give their albums each their own character, but an overall consistency of style and intent.  All the hype over the replacement of drummer Mike Portnoy hasn't really amounted to a significant change in the band's style or sound, luckily.<br />  So, when this came out, I thought - &#34;cool, I like Dream Theater, but it'll just be a more of what I already have&#34;.  And, while there's no real surprises here, it's a very solid example of what they do.  Compared to their other albums, this stands out as one of the best, so if you like the band it should help reignite your passion for them, if you'd like to check out the band it's as good a place as any to start (yeah, maybe better than &#34;Images & Words&#34; - that one's kind of a classic, but I think this one's probably more consistent), and if you don't like them this won't change your mind!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Great story!  I liked that King went back to these characters.  As soon as I'd heard that this was coming out I knew I had to read it.  Really well done.
B003NTSBUG|4.0|Kept me interested the entire movie and the story tied together by the end. Good performances by DiCaprio and Kingsley.
B00BR476TG|5.0|I enjoyed the preview.  It was beautiful and the acting was very good.  I dont have time to watch the movie yet, but I will soon.
B000H1RFKA|5.0|Perfectly combines Shane Black and RDJ.  This is an awesome crime noir comedy with some of the best one-liners in a movie.  Buy it, don't rent it, because you'll just want to buy it after renting it.
0316113506|4.0|It came in great condition! The only reason I can't give it that 5th star is because it isn't a very good read. Unless you like to read about the chemicals in the brain.
B007ZYJT1U|5.0|It is a wonderful exhibit of the two sides of human nature, the angry side and the heart filled side. The two sides of the key characters is so very elegantly done I couldn't stop thinking about it for days.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was extremely hard to put down.  I couldn't believe it when it ended.  I just had to get the second in the trilogy right away to make sure they got back together.
006202406X|1.0|Hey Everyone, who's looking for an alternate ending?? Well check out Stephanie Ziel's alternate ending @ Addicted Readers: [...]<br /><br />Its was AMAZING!!! I wish Veronica Roth would of written an ending like that!!<br /><br />***UPDATED***<br /><br />***REVIEW****<br /><br />ALLEGIANT, Oh, ALLEGIANT, how you failed me in so many ways!<br /><br />I went over every feeling, every thought, every emotion I had, be it good or bad. And after all that analyzing in my OWN opinion, I still came back with NOT being satisfied one bit with this Conclusion to my favorite series, or should I say \\"Used To Be My Favorite Series\\"?<br /><br />FIRST LET ME TALK ABOUT MY FEELINGS ON THE ENDING:<br /><br />WARNING A BUNCH OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />***READ AT YOUR OWN RISK***<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />V<br />I had this book spoiled for me before I started reading ALLEGIANT, so I went into it already knowing what was going to happen to Tris in the ending. I found out about it 2 days before I started reading, and I was an emotional wreck! My husband thought I was insane! But I was stunned, I really could not believe Tris was going to die. I had no idea, not even a little thought that it would happen to Tris. So when I did find out, I was shocked! I was in denial for the first couple hours until finally I couldn't take it anymore and I broke down and read some of the reviews! Then, I was FORCED to see the truth, Tris would in fact die!! UGH, I still get teary eyed when I think about it! I never would of thought Veronica would do that to Tris, and not just to Tris, but to her LOYAL FANS! Tris had so many near death experiences, especially in INSURGENT, when she battled with death, and wanting to die, but finally she had an eye opener and realized she did not want to die, and that she was more then a self sacficer. So that led me to believe Tris had all the near death experiences that she was going to have, boy was I wrong!!!<br /><br />I stand 100% behind MY Opinion, that this WAS THE WRONG WAY TO END THE DIVERGENT SERIES!!!<br /><br />AGAIN, MY OPINION!!!<br /><br />Veronica said that she had this ending planed from the very beginning of this series, and that it was the ONLY ending that she felt would do this series any justice! WHAT, NO, WRONG VERONICA! She said she felt having these characters end with a happy ending, holding hands, walking off into the sunset was fake and unbelievable. BUT wait, I came across an alternate ending to ALLEGIANT written by a Fan Fiction author Stephanie Ziel (POST HERE), and let me tell you, IT WAS AMAZING!!! And, NO, they did not have this sugarcoated happy ending like Veronica didn't want! They had a hard ending, that brought tears to my eyes, but still TRIS SURRIVED!!! And IN MY OPINION it was the BEST ENDING FOR THIS SERIES!!! If Veronica would of wrote this ending I think A LOT more people would of been more satisfied, including me!!<br /><br />Now, all that said, I was still very upset that Tris died. I thought it was the wrong move for Veronica to make. (I am NOT the only one who thought this, as of the date of this review, Amazon's has a 2.8 Rating, Not good, not good at all). BUT I wasn't just upset that Tris died, I didn't like the WAY Tris died! I thought Tris sacrificing herself and taking her brothers place in the Weapons Lab, was the worst way for Tris to go! I mean I get it, this book is about selflessness and forgiving, and all that blah, blah, blah, BUT if Veronica Roth was going to kill off the main protagonist she should of at least had her go out with a bang, in which she DEFINITELY did not!<br /><br />THESE ARE THE MANY OTHER REASONS I DID NOT LIKE ALLEGIANT:<br /><br />Okay, the ending was not my only problem with ALLEGIANT. My first issue was the alternate POV's. I HATED IT!! It irritated me to no end! UGH, it drove me insane!! I could not tell Tobias and Tris apart to save my life. Only way I was able to tell them apart was when I went back to the beginning chapterand read the heading of who's POV it was. If not for the heading with the name of who's chapter it was, I would of been lost and waiting until whoever POV it was, said the other persons name. But their voice was so similar, that at times I just wanted to put the book down and scream, yes it was that bad for me!!<br /><br />Another issue I had was Tobias! He was a totally different character from the first 2 books. I mean a different guy all together! ONE of the MANY reasons I LOVED Four was that he always had this sexy mysterious way about him, that just kept me wanting to know him more. And when I read he's POV in the Short Stories, I was in awe! I loved the tough, strong-willed, determined, guarded Four. And being in his mind was really such a treat! He had all these character traits that I loved so much in the Short Stories. So I was expecting to have the same in ALLEGIANT, but of course with more emotion because in the short stories he wasn't with Tris or in love. So I was curious to see how Four would react to being in love and having someone else to worry about besides himself. BUT WOW, what I got was A BIG FAT DISAPPOINTMENT!!!<br /><br />At times Four acted naïve, like he was new too their world and all the plotting, scheming, betrayals, and death around him. It caused him many problems that he couldn't get out of! UGH, and he was WAY to trusting with the first pretty girl that feed him a load of crap! Since when did Tobias become so trusting with complete strangers that he was willing to go against everything he believed in? Not the Tobias I have grown to love and care deeply for!<br /><br />Another thing that changed in ALLEGIANT with the character traits, was that Tris became the strong, sure of herself girl, and Four was the weak, trusting and unsure of who and where he belonged guy. And that was not the Four I've come to love! Nope, this new and NOT improved Four in ALLEGIANT --SPOILER-- was so trusting, that it even cost Uriah his life!! I'm not saying it was directly Four's fault, because it wasn't. But if he would of trusted Tris and her judgment, and not trusted Nita, and went along with her insane plan, then the whole mission would of had to wait, then Uriah wouldn't of been standing where he was when it all happened! So again, if Four would of went with his heart instead of his quick impulse, then certain things wouldn't of happened. Which honestly, I felt some thing's happened with really no reasoning behind it. Like Uriah, what was the whole purpose of killing him off??? Really I would love to know, because I can't figure it out. Again, he was another one of my favorite characters that got killed off, FOR WHAT???? Four was just so annoying, and most of the time I couldn't' wait to get back to Tris's POV. But even Tris had her annoying chapters too! I felt the total opposite about all of this in the first 2 books! I LOVED pretty much everything about DIVERGENT & INSURGENT! But ALLLEGIANT just fell flat for me in SO MANY WAYS, so more reasons then what I'm putting in this review!!! If I listed all the reasons why I hated ALLEGIANT, then we would be here all day, because their is SO many! Seriously!<br /><br />Then the plot was so annoying, the whole what was outside of the fence was stupid, and definitely not what I was expecting! (I say that NOT in a good way) The GD's and GP's, was the worst idea Veronica has ever came up with! I was expecting something so unique and original from Veronica, because that's all she's ever given me! I kept waiting for the big BANG to happen when they went behind the boundaries of their city. I was hoping for a drawn out scary reason for them being horded off and locked away like dogs! But the whole Gene thing was just laughable! When I first found out the reasoning behind everything, I was just staring at the book, saying \\"What Did I Just Read? This Can Not Be It? Their HAS TO BE MORE\\"? I kept waiting for it all to be a big hoax's, but it wasn't, and I was let down for the hundredth time with this book! I just couldn't take it anymore. Then by the time I got to the ending, I just didn't have it in me to be mad, or upset, or cry anymore! I've had enough letdowns to last me a bookish lifetime just in this one book! And its SO HEARTBREAKING to feel this way about my favorite series!!!<br /><br />I honestly can not think of one thing that I liked about this book! As of the beginning of this review I was planning on giving this book 2 stars, but now that I voiced some, NOT even ALL of my issues on paper, I realized that their really wasn't anything I enjoyed in this last book! So I feel obligated to give this book 1 star! And oh, how that makes me feel terrible! I really, really, really, wanted to love this book! I did, I really did, but I just can't for all the reasons stated above, and more not stated! I can't stress enough how much I LOVED the first 2 books, DIVERGENT & INSURGENT, and I had such high hopes for ALLEGIANT, maybe too high, because I was let down HARD!! I just can't love this book, or even like it, and I can't give it more then a 1 star rating! And I've never given a 1 star rating, NEVER! At least until this book! SO it is really hard for me to give it this 1 star, but it really does deserve it, in MY OPINION!<br /><br />ON A FINAL NOTE:<br /><br />So, I will walk away from this series heartbroken, torn,<br />lost, and unsure if I should ever put as much hope, faith and trust in another author the way I put forth in Veronica Roth! Will I read more of her books? I really don't know! She is such a skilled writer, that just took a big dive down in ALLEGIANT, but that does NOT make her any less of an author in my opinion. So I would hope Veronica would make ALLEGIANT a learning experience and learn from the many mistakes she made in this last book, and not make them again. So as of right now, who knows, depends on if I will ever feel inclined to pick up a book with Veronica Roth's name on the cover!<br /><br />So there you have it, what I hated the most about ALLEGIANT! What are you thoughts on ALLEGIANT?? Did you love it, hate it, didn't really care either way?? But for all of you who feel that ending was the last straw with ALLEGIANT, then please take a moment and check out this alternate ending I have on my blog, as it has definitely made me feel so much better and more complete to walk away from this series with brighter thoughts!le mission would of had to wait, then Uriah wouldn't of been standing where he was when it all happened!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is about a whole lot more than sexual habits.  It was a great eye opener to the quirks of peoples' personalities and what makes them the adults that they become.  It's nice to know that there is always hope for those &#34;lost souls&#34; created by catastrophic events in the childhood.  It was also a great romance story.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of Grisham's best so far. Once in a great while the denouement in his books lets me down, jus because I wanted it to end differently for the main character. In this story, I love all the characters and how he weaves the story, and I loved it right through. I won't put a spoiler in here, but just say it's great. Enjoy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What a great ending.  It didn't feel like three books at all.  I couldn't put it down 'til I knew how it all ended.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I was very skeptical at first.  I downloaded the app and was very surprised at how much space this cleared!
B004QSQMKE|5.0|I love this movie, it's corny and silly fantastical fun. Tim Curry is, as always, brilliant not Tom Cruise's best work but it was one of his first if not his first movie so ... great story telling though and the fx are pretty cool for old school.
B00006AW63|2.0|It did not play on my DVD. Seller could have made clearer that it was for UK DVD players. The cost to return the item was not worth the return so I had to just chalk this up as a Loss...
1476727651|5.0|I let my mother read this book first. She said it was awesome. I can't wait to start it myself.
B00CUHMUZ4|5.0|Andre Rieu is my favorite entertainer!!!!  I listen to him on a regular basis.  I will be adding to my collection.
B00DOPEGAS|3.0|Rubber bands tend to snap off the smooth side of the pegs when assembling the bracelets.  The angle of the pegs makes it hard to push the rubber bands down when having to have multiple rubber bands on one peg.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Fun multiplayer game for all ages! Timed shots make the games go fast for when you don't have much time.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I really enjoyed it. Exciting movie with a lot of action. It was a nice twist on an old story.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|fun and addicting game. wish it had a replay so I could see why some candies disappear. I don't always think there are sets of 3. otherwise its a challenging game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked the twist at the end of the book.  it was well written. I recommend it to anyone e
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have read every Stephen King book. This is one of the better ones. I have also known an alcoholic father; most times a happy drunk, other times not. Write on Stephen King! I'm one of your biggest fans!  Linda
1476727651|5.0|Great plot, great characters, typical Stephen King excellence in keeping you guessing till the end. Written with his usual expertise and ease of reading.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it!!! The best game I have played. Once u play you would be hook and be playing this game all the time
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so awesome I can never stop playing my mom is addicted to the game . She said that she will down load it on the both of her phones
B009HEMJCW|5.0|Penelope is so full familiar faces I had to watch. I am not a fan of romantic comedies since they are often based on deceit and makeovers. This is a romantic comedy with a curse. There is a lie involved but there are enough plot twists to keep it original. Penelope's \\"well meaning\\" mean mother is one of her curses. She is a heroine on her own that doesn't need prince charming.<br /><br />She does not need a makeover to make it or find acceptance. Once she realizes this she enjoys love and happiness. Penelope touches everyone she meets. The movie is equally uplifting. It is a family movie with a good message.<br /><br />It's a great way to spend 1hr30min.<br />I dare you not be enchanted by this movie.
B005SDDB9Q|4.0|Good for hard core fans, but my wife was unimpressed.  Great for fans of the Boss who have been to enough concerts to see how his songs have evolved.
B009LDD5HW|3.0|This season was not as good as the first 3. Songs are more often and much longer. I would begin getting bored watching like 5 full length songs in one show. There was more singing and less story in this season. It was very disappointing compared to the previous seasons. However, it is Glee and I love glee none the less.
B000I3UAJ0|4.0|Classic. A must see for ans young and old. There is something for everyone in this film. Definitely a must see for everyone!
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I like the action and the humor in this one  its nice to see all the older, former action heroes get togather with some of the goofiest lines!
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|A young Nigerian woman leaves her family and high school sweetheart behind to immigrate to the United States, where she works, goes to college, finds new loves, and starts a successful blog.  It is interesting to read about a modern day immigrant’s view of America and Americans, particularly with respect to race relations, and how living in the U.S. changed her, especially when she returns home after 15 years and renews old relationships.  The story is rather long though it is so rich with detail, description and colorful characters, I wonder if it is at least partially autobiographical.  I almost abandoned it after a few chapters, the story does start slowly.  I’m glad I stuck with it, because before long I found myself getting very involved with the characters and meandering plot.  Very interesting read.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Works OK  but there are just not very many apps / options for this yet .  They need to get more sites on board for it to be a great unit.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game. I like how it changes the look every once in a while. I love the daily challenges and the police and his dog.
B00FHAB3HW|5.0|Better than anyone could expect! Miley is a fantastic singer and musician! She can do whatever she wants as long as her original music keeps coming!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Love all of the cut the rope games. This one does not disappoint. Would definitely recommend purchasing this game pass the time.
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|This book could probably be condensed into a much smaller volume,  as the fundamental premise is repeated throughout the text.<br />All in all, informative and definitely information of value.  Maybe inflammation brain would have been a more accurate, less catchy title.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Some of the best acting you'll see. And the cinematography is astonishingly good. Might move too slowly for some people, but those who appreciate a truly well-made show, this offers all kinds of rewards.
B004S5C91Q|5.0|Compelling reading.  How can anyone survive  an experience like that!  Kept me on the edge!  I found the end very satisfying.
B000T433CO|2.0|Good chick flick.  Nothing too deep.  A little silly.  Fun.  Don't expect too much from this B-movie with a thin plot.
B00E9PMMPI|5.0|I've always loved this movie since i was a child. It's really a fun premise if you don't take it too seriously. I own the special edition DVD so when the Blu-ray went live I knew I'd get it eventually. The HD transfer is quite nice and the movie is still enjoyable despite the HD quality making the old school special effects seem dated even more, it's still a classic that any science fiction fan should love.
B008GJV4F2|3.0|Enjoyable.  Clever and well acted with a bit of a dark side as well as an uplifting ending.  Above average flick.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game but I don't like it because it will take away the health when I don't play it or a while
B00E9ZFIMM|1.0|Doesn't really DO anything... just a notepad app....I have a different one that lets me do checklists and stuff so I uninstalled this one. Glad I didn't pay anything for it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series has been one of the best on TV....I was hooked on the 1st time I saw it, bought the series and told everybody I knew how great it is...my series have been lent to several families, gifted to my daughter-in-law who has proselyted all her friends. Thanks. It is the best since Reiilly, Ace of Spies. and Foyle's War.
B005723JSQ|1.0|Silly story, poorly developed characters. Storyline not captivating. Just did not grab my interest. I did not get past the initial 20 pages or so.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I remember that day so vividly and it was intriguing to consider what would the world be like if it did not happen.  Stephen King did a great job making it an edge of the seat read.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|There's actually a decent story burried under all of the &#34;mommy porn&#34;.  The story unfolds nicely over the three books, but can be tedious reading at times with certain phrases and character musings that are repeated over and over and over.  In all worth reading!
B005OT2YVA|3.0|The plot makes no sense, but as a Chicagoan, I love what they did with the location shooting in the last hour of the film, especially the squirrel suit skydiving in front of Willis (Sears) Tower.  It also features fine performances by Frances McDormand, John Turturro, and John Malkovich, all of whom seem to rise above the shoddy script.  For what it's worth, this is probably the best Transformers movie, but that is like being the tallest dwarf.  At least this one doesn't have the jive-bots or robo-testicles like its predecessor.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|the action scenes were nice and the story was informative and the younger version of the crew was a nice change of pace.
B005HEQ4XQ|4.0|A consistently good, sometimes great, season of Star Trek: TNG.  Not quite as brilliant at Seasons 4 or 5, it still contains some classic episodes like the 2-part &#34;Chain of Command&#34; that rank among the finest hours of TNG.
B009K916ZK|4.0|A little expensive, but it works. I purchased a no-name adapter and had trouble with screen quality, so I decided to go with the Apple product. No problems since I upgraded.
B00957T6X6|3.0|I won't bother with reviewing the books in this instance, and will only say that they are spectacular.  The reason for my three-star rating on this product is entirely due to the nature of this bundling.  Sure, many reviews bemoaned the choices made in this bundle, but it was the most practical, cost-wise.  That being said, the indexes are rather clumsy, and could have used much more attention from the publisher.  Ultimately, the reader will have to decide how particular they are about the navigability and aesthetics of their e-books.  If those criteria are deal breakers, look elsewhere.  If you want an affordable bundle of this excellent series, then this one might be for you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love it best book I have ever read I my life full of battles romance peeta has true love for katness but she is falling in love.
075669812X|5.0|If you've seen my other reviews, you can see I love these DK books almost as much as the kids.  Great layouts, colorful pages, and descriptions of the characters are a refreshing thing to put in front of your child in a world rife with digital screens.  As always, it comes with an exclusive minifigure that is loads of fun.  Again, Amazon's price on this was unbeatable.  A great gift for any LEGO or Ninjago fan.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Best hunting game I've ever played. It has the best graphics, and very realistic. Feels like you are really hunting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you love games like temple run and subway surfer you will probably love this game. I love gameloft games so much because they look cool and a lot of times they are free! &lt;3
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|A great 21st-century tribute to old Japanese monster movies with big robots vs big monsters.  I really can't say just how much fun this movie was to watch.  It's just a plain good adventure story with a simple premise, likeable characters, big tech machines, and some bad-ass sea monsters to fight.  A fabulous display of filmmaking artistry by Guillermo del Toro with intense special effects and a story told with a lot of heart.<br /><br />Just sit back and enjoy the ride!
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Great! I was so happy that it came in the original packaging! It plays extremely well and the quality is great.
B00DMK6WN4|5.0|Well this is just about the cutest movie I have ever seen! I'm not always eager to watch new movies with my kids but Monsters University from Disney Pixar I think I was looking forward to even more than them!<br /><br />How do I judge the success of a movie? The sound of silence of course! It is rare for my four and five year olds to sit through an entire show, let alone a full length movie! But I put this one on and it's like magic every time! They both sit and watch the entire thing in silence.<br /><br />When I watched it, I wasn't so silent because I was laughing a lot! I thought it was hysterical so it must be my type of humor. Billy Crystal and John Goodman make the movie! I think that's part of why I enjoy Disney movies more than most. With recognizable voices it just brings it more to life for me.<br /><br />With any Disney Pixar production, everything is top quality. The colors and animation are truly amazing and while designed to mesmerize and draw in young kids, it does the same for me! I love watching the clarity of Blu-Ray on cartoons.<br /><br />When Mike goes off to the University to learn how to really scare people, he is definitely an underdog. Me and my kids were rooting for him and I like the message that it sends to kids about being able to accomplish anything you set your mind to.<br /><br />Monsters University is a new favorite in our house and one I actually don't complain when my kids ask to watch for the hundredth time!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like the large letters &amp; numbers.  It's so easy to download.  I use this rather than my hand calculator.  The keys are large for any age to use.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is the best game ever know om andriod hope i got enough memory hope whoever gets it they enjoy it
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|I really liked this book.  A great read. Unable to put it down.  Heard about this book on Diane Rheem Show on NPR.
B00CFQDDWY|2.0|I received my order 3 weeks late and the box had damage to it want very pleased at all but the toy itself was good just not the customer
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I love the Ice Age series. Very enjoyable family fun, great visually, gotta love Scrat! Our family is all adults (kids in their 20s) and we all enjoyed the movie.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is the best game ever. U should get this game yourself!!! Come on and get this game it would change your life!!!!:):)
B000W453KQ|5.0|This movie illustrates why you should marry for compatible values and life goals instead of for love alone.  Katie and Hubble knew at the start of their courtship that they wouldn't last, yet they persisted in the face of blind love and infatuation only to wind up divorcing over--you guessed it--infidelity and incompatible life values.  The wreckage of raising their daughter in a broken household and of wasting years of their lives in an unhappy yet &#34;loving&#34; union is reason enough to learn the life lesson being imparted here: marry for values, or else you'll end up like the leading characters!
B000002JSN|4.0|Definitely my all time favorite zeppelin album. Both discs are amazing and you couldn't ask for anything more from this amazing rock band
B00BDTYOWW|1.0|Absurd cliche ridden dialogue, ridiculous characters. This must have been very early Rattigan; it is an immature work. There is no explanation how a hottie such as  Rachel Weisz's character managed to marry an unattractive, fatuous panty-waste momma's boy twice her age. Of course she had an affair! Who wouldn't. No mystery, and no drama there. The rest of the cast is equally un-compelling, scraped from the bottom of the BBC extra's pool.  Unless you want to see a fine actress, Weisz,  embarrass herself in a turkey trot, skip it, old darling!
0895292211|5.0|This was a easy and wonderful book to read. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to understand the importance of enzymes.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great Story, classic Science Fiction tail.  Can't believe I hadn't read it before, it stands up to the test of time.
B007FDE4Y8|1.0|Don't even THINK of trying to balance this stabilizer. Mine came with loose and missing parts.<br /><br />I've balanced everything from checkbooks to Steadicams, and listen to me, this WILL not balance. Well, it might but don't lay it down because it will quickly become a useless, unbalanced paperweight.<br /><br />Very surprised it's still sold.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|This movie was very entertaining and while I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan he excelled as Jack Reacher.  It was also very nicely filmed in Pittsburgh so those of us with a Pittsburgh connection will see plenty of familiar sites and landmarks throughout the movie.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|This is the first review I've ever written.  I loved the first two Bridget Jones books, but I am stunned that the author decided that killing off Mark Darcy would make for a good story.  He was one of the best characters in the series, and I was looking forward to Bridget's life with Mark. . .not with some idiot singleton.<br /><br />I could not read past the first few chapters.  A waste of money, and leaves me feeling disappointed with the series and author.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|One huge cliche after another.  It is amazing how neither of the two characters can bring themselves to speak above a whisper, a mumble or a mutter.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|Bought this as a gift. It was fabulous. Great picture quality. Great price.The quality was so much better than a regular DVD. I could not believe it.
B000002LSV|5.0|who doesn't love z z top. the songs are really good. i would recommend it to anyone. i listen to it everyday.
0545265355|5.0|I love books. My little cousin recommended this series to me and it was very impressed. The box set price was great! 35 bucks for three books all hardback! I have a kindle fire but I wanted the &#34;real thing&#34; and I am very pleased with my purchase and the price!
B0063M22QO|3.0|this game is ok but i like game 2 better. it's ok to get started. i would recommend it. i still play it sometimes.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|For Tim Burton Lovers, this is right up your alley.  It's funny and interesting. I have watched this movie at least 20 times since I bought it. It is based on the show, but has many differences (as movies tend to), but it was well worth the money I spent for it.  I love Tim Burton/ Johnny Depp adaptations, so I may be a little biased.
B00F8LPH90|4.0|Not a bad game. Great for killing a little bit of time. It is fun and can be a challenge not hitting civilians. Weapons are cool.
B00821OX98|5.0|I enjoy this genre of television shows.  Perhaps it's because I don't feel it's that strange that our world could end up in a situation where we lose our technology and have to revert to basic skills in order to survive.  This show has a solid cast and a very good storyline. I enjoy the interpersonal dynamics and the larger storyline and how they mesh together.  Great show!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game for kids to play. My daughter enjoyed playing it.  Her favorite was level five and level ten. Would recommend it
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|If you love technology and wonder about the next advance this is a must read! Totally thought provoking!<br /><br />A brave New world!
630542828X|5.0|There is such a thing as a perfect picture: a confluence of theme, meaning,  storytelling, screenplay, acting, location, camerawork,  soundtrack, and, of course, directing which results in something fine.<br />How does that happen?<br />I think I can partly explain the acting:  You assemble gifted actors and cast them in parts for which they seem uniquely suited.  For example, there was never an actor of higher caliber than Robert Duvall. It is no wonder, then, that with his Louisiana roots and accent, he portrays perfectly a shrewd, Harvard-trained Yankee lawyer. John Travolta, competent and versatile, carries with strength the central character, combining boldness and sensitivity.. William Macy shines as the loyal, practical, long-suffering but anxious partner.<br />All the other elements are of equal caliber. Make sure you see this movie!
B005PK553C|4.0|Surprisingly addictive. The cast was a perfect match.  Couldn't stop watching. I would highly recommend watching all the secrets unfold.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Ok so I was just playing slender man so I was looking for the last sign on the farm when all of a sudden I fall through the world. Please fix this. Otherwise this game is great!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It's honestly width getting if your a hunter or like hunting.Plus it's free.I think you guys will love it I do. :)
B006BFK5DK|5.0|Earth Wind and Fire's new CD is great, as usual. I have asked all my friends to purchase it and tell others about it.
B002GJI8PM|5.0|This is an amazing soundtrack, and about as good as 'The Fellowship of the Ring' soundtrack! It has the same spirit as both movies 'The Two Towers' and 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. Howard Shore hit it out of the Park with these soundtracks.<br /><br />'Foundations of Stone' starts off slow, yet valiant, then brings in the Theme for the Ring, and ends up loud and agitated, as Gandalf battles the Balrog. 'The Taming of Smeagol' starts off with the Theme for the Hobbits, then grows slow and Lorien-esque, but becomes suspenseful, then fast and dangerous. 'The Riders of Rohan' starts off fast and wary, yet awesome, as the Rohirrim encircle Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, but becomes quiet, and begins Eowynn's Theme, then loud as it pre-reprises 'The King of the Golden Hall'. 'The Passage of the Marshes' is a dark and suspenseful piece, almost evil, as Frodo, Sam and Gollum creep through the Dead Marshes, it could almost be the Theme for The Eye. 'The Uruk-Hai' starts slow, then loudly reprises the Theme for the Fellowship, then Aragorn find's Pippin's Elven Brooch, and it grows quieter, then becomes loud and reprises the Theme for Isengard. Then 'The King of the Golden Hall' is a perfect piece for 'The Two Towers', starting quiet, and soft, and often reprising the Theme for Rohan. 'The Black Gate is Closed' is a loud and defiant piece, half the way through, keeping you on edge, but halfway through, is higher and softer, but still wary of something. 'Evenstar' is a beautiful and soft piece, with a reoccurring Elven hymnatic solo, with soft breaks in between. 'The White Rider' starts loud and both Fellowship-espue and Isengard-ish, as it reveals that it is Gandalf, not Saruman. 'Treebeard' starts off darkly, but then gets lighter, and eventually sounds like the theme for the Ewoks from Star Wars Ep. VI. 'The Leave Taking' is a light, yet depressed piece, which incorporates the Theme for Lorien. 'Helms Deep' is as one would expect: loud and quick and epic, as it chronicles the Battle of Helms Deep. 'The Forbidden Pool' is a slow and dark and quiet piece, that reminds you of 'A Journey in the Dark' from 'The Fellowship of the Ring' soundtrack. Then, 'Breath of Life' is a lighter, beautiful, then fast-paced song as Aragorn wakes from his \\"tumble off the cliff\\" and discovers the army from Isengard. 'The Hornburg' begins with a reprise of the Theme for Rohan, remains quiet, and eventually reprises Theme for the Fellowship, then gets loud and reprises Theme for Galadriel in a war-like manner. 'Forth Eorlingas' is a beautiful orchestration with background vocals, as Men start to win the Battle for Helms Deep; it's gets loud, and reprises Theme for Rohan, then Theme for the Fellowship. 'Isengard Unleashed' is a track that has a dark Elvish feel, then gets violent, and reprises Theme for Isengard, as the Ents attack Isengard. 'Samwise the Brave' is a touching piece of music, which is a 'Two Towers' version of 'The Breaking of the Fellowship', staying light through most of it, then getting dark and mischievous at the end. Finally, 'Gollum's Song' is a dark, sad ballad, about crying and not being able to go home, which you could really hear Gollum singing it, if it weren't Emiliana Torrini, and ultimately reprises the two main themes for the movie at the end.<br /><br />This is an awesome soundtrack. My personal favorite tracks are 'The Riders of Rohan', 'The Uruk-Hai', 'The King of the Golden Hall', 'The Black Gate is Closed', 'Evenstar', 'Breath of Life', 'The Hornburg', 'Forth Eorlingas', and 'Samwise the Brave'. I'd definitely recommend this album to any LOTR or touching/instrumental music fan. Though this is a great soundtrack, I do think $10.49 is a little too much for MP3 music. But it's good none-the-less.
B00D2K40WY|2.0|The target audience is obviously for little girls. It basically shows putting on make-up and faking every thing makes you ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS &lt;3. xD. No. I could show you so many people with low self esteem, you don't see what you're doing. I hope if you are a parent you see this, don't  let your kids play games like this! It brainwashes them into thinking certain ways, what perfrction is, and obviously completely destroys their confidence. Imagine your kid going  from having high self esteem to calling themselves fat and ugly. Please make a game where being beautiful is expressed differently, not like this.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|This is a teen movie that older folks can appreciate, too.  The cast is quite engaging, and the story is told in a clear way without giving away too much too soon.  What a pleasure to see Emma Watson successful outside of Hogwarts.  The presentation includes original opening and some alternate scenes.  Blu-Ray is the ultimate clarity here.  Enjoy it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|wish could get more chances without having to purchase! !! but other than that great game!! lots of fun to play!
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|It's a halloween classic, still get's the tears burning the backs of my eye balls (&#34;ouch&#34;); this movie never gets old.

B00CATSONE|5.0|I started to read this book as a biography, however it turned out to be a great motivational book.<br />Thank you
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Overly symbolic<br />We know he's a symbol expert but it becomes overbearing. however the basic story is interesting. Would recommend as action thriller
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had been wondering what all the hoopla was about and had a hard time getting into it on my laptop,  but now that its more portable I am loving it!
B00F30S0Y0|3.0|OK, it sounds like the Talking Heads.  But I always liked the Talking Heads (hey, I'm 55).  That being said, its not  the sound so much as the execution that makes me give the album a middling rating.  It reminds me of an opus from another fave of mine- The Clash.<br />Remember &#34;Sandinista!&#34;?  A fine album's worth of great, genre busting and catchy tunes mixed into 3 LPs?  With all sorts of<br />weird sound experimentation?  That's the problem here.  Something like 6 minutes of the sound of a cassette rewinding.  Really?<br />Finishing up, then beginning the next CD with a long recording of white noise?  An over 11 minute track?  Take this stuff out,<br />and one has one CD's worth of a decent album, albeit VERY different from the rest of their output.  There's avante garde, and then there's bloat.  Which does this album represent?  You choose.  But they make one ask the question:  Is the stretching due to a lack of ideas, genuine artistry, or an urge to make more money?
B00D6B4PUG|3.0|Well, Yahoo is free.  I am disappointed that I had to buy it in order to have my email available on my Kindle.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|I've seen them once during the 1977 shows. Sensational.<br /><br />This version of HC in 1994 is the best I've ever heard.<br /><br />Only bummer is that Don Felder is not credited anywhere for HC.<br /><br />Would LOVE to hear the ENTIRE shows if they exist anywhere....
B004EF65QA|5.0|A wonderfully made series, with a great cast and story. All that a romance movie should be. Made me want to read the book!
B0045EA1P6|5.0|One of the best albums I've ever heard. Immaculately produced, performed and written. This is a must have for any music lover!
1451626657|4.0|Wonderful Novel. Incredible humor, just make sure you like irony and sarcasm turned up to eleven. This is one of my favorite novels, the first time I read it I was living on an Army camp thousands of miles from home living a routine of one asinine, redundant and pointless tasks after another, so it really hit home for me.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Wish there was an option to sign in so you could leave off in the same place as when you played another device.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is definitely addictive the only problem is that on some of the levels it glitches and let's you do it a different way, but counts it as wrong.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is now on Kindle Fire which is awesome.  It is just like the Facebook version and you can connect to Facebook so you can keep your levels and friends you play with.  I like to play it even better than on Facebook because it has some really neat graphics.  The game works well even with the first Kindle Fire which is the one I have.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Not that I'm really all that into horror movies, but my wife and I decided that a scary movie on Halloween would be apt. Well \\"The Conjuring\\" didn't disappoint! The whole movie creeps you out, there were a couple of scenes where my wife literally screamed during the movie. I still haven't slept well three days later. Really good scare.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|fun, but energy runs out too fast at beginning, you need to stay as it gets better as you move through the different levels
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Addictive &amp; fun for adults &amp; kids. Great for the family. Love the different scenic options. Only wish earning coins was more attainable.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is a very engaging and addicting show. Was very disappointed in the ending of Season 3.....killing off 2 very prominent characters seems sort of chancey and I will miss Matthew!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I am an old biker and I usually shy away from these types of shows but this sucked me in and has held my captive.
B0026OE2NY|5.0|It is an awe inspiring DVD and it is in excellent condition! It plays as if it is new and not used.
B00EB6ENXO|3.0|Really disappointed with the Mandarin storyline. I mean, com'on where are the five rings of power!? What a waste of money on Ben Kingsley.
B006Q6MOCY|5.0|If you're wondering which version to get, the Mobile Fidelity version has less compression (wider dynamic range) than the standard Columbia version.  It was transferred from the stereo re-mix master made in 1996.  Also, it's a hybrid disc so it will play on a standard CD unit as well as an SACD player.  It does NOT include the original mono mix.
B003XYE7VS|5.0|What can be said about a historic book such as this one written by  C. Darwin?  It's usually good to go to the source once  in a while.  It was fun to read what Darwin was thinking without the filtering of intrepreters and detractors.  My impression of the writer's style and logic is that this is an amazingly modern  piece of work.  The language is clear and the arguments complete.  Held up against modern discovery and research the writer holds his own well. I have found this book to be an enjoyable read and while his logic gets buried in his words, the challenge of picking out the kernels is fun.  C. Darwin didn't have all the answers but you can't fault his logic.  One might say that Darwin didn't know what he was talking about but the sense of it is hard to ignore.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, yes I'm stuck on Level 181 for I don't know how Long but I keep on trying ...
0399165274|4.0|Good book, certainly not his best, but worth reading. As always, I expect his next one, and thank him for a delighthful<br />time spent reading .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I waited so long for this game to come to my Kindle Fire HD. The first time I played Candy Crush Saga, I was addicted. Months later and I'm still addicted, even though it drives me crazy. I LOVE ME SOME CANDY CRUSH SAGA!!
B000NGTJTY|4.0|Gripping story line and good acting make this an enjoyable movie.  I can, without reservation, recommend this film to anyone.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Awsome Bosh and michael always a good team i have enjoyed all his novels Especially this nerve wracking team.  Keep it going michael .im an 82 year ol teacher ms degree and can hardely wait to get the next one
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|1/2 way thru it.  Just like a King novel.<br />It's like he always does. Predictable.<br />I'll buy more in the future.
B0061S073A|5.0|Got this because my 3yo kept messing up my settings and uninstalling apps! I could not like this any more. Life hack!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Once I picked up this book I could not put it down. Can't wait until the next Clifton book comes out.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Amazing I love it I even bought the full version and its so worth it , I hope you enjoy :)
B002H3F7F6|5.0|This has got a lot of Stings songs that I've never heard before.  It is a little different than Stings usual style but I think that's what I like about it the most.  Sting never seizes to amaze me with his talents and his diversity.  This is an album that shows that diversity a lot.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|This is a very helpful and inspiring book. I found Pressfield's writing style enjoyable and refreshing. Many similar books deal with the concept of Resistance, but I've never found anyone who could explain the concept as well as in The War of Art. I believe anyone could benefit from reading this book, but if you are creatively blocked, then this book is like a breathe of fresh air and a kick in the ass to start doing your work again.
B00D6JX3OM|5.0|This is an interesting blend of Stings talents.  As usual he has come up with something very original and upbeat.  I can close my eyes and imagine the working men on the docks of England when some of his songs are played.  I think that the play must be a pretty good play if the soundtrack is any indication of its quality.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is simply amazing. I definitely won't forget this book. I even fell in love with the characters and sad that the book ended.
B005HV6YO8|5.0|I have almost every one of Sting albums and in my opinion this album has done a good job of showcasing some of my favorite hits of his in one production.  Sometimes I buy an album of his because of one or two songs on it that I just love.  This album has all of the songs that I love in one place.  I like that a lot!
B0063IH60K|5.0|The game does a lot of moving for you at your command, .....making<br /> it easy to play on a small screen
B0027MJU00|5.0|Couldn't put it down! It was a great read and the ending was perfect! Look forward to reading more books by Gillian Flynn
B002O6FBW0|5.0|This movie should be on everyone's watch list. You can see it's influence throughout modern horror films to this day. Yeah, it's black and white, and silent. Deal with it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so good very easy to play and also very recreational.It is also a good way to pass the time on school trips and family trips. T his is my guilty pleasure ehen i am not hard on my schoolwork so i say this is a phenomenal game thank you for creating it
B005WBBYXO|3.0|&#34;Dark Materials&#34; indeed! &#34;Golden Compass&#34; is all that is needed! After the first book, the depressing cloud never relents until the end....even then.....
B009RX85N0|3.0|I send it to my son for a birthday present and it was stolen out of the priority envelope. Not your fault though.
B0041VV03A|1.0|Absolutely the most cringe-worthy, awful movie I have ever seen. The part where<br />Adrien Brody is dancing with the mutant girl is just gross and wrong on so many<br />levels. Ick ick ick. Would have given it a &#34;0&#34; if that was an option.
B0012HEB32|4.0|Decent show, could have been better. Story lines were ok, writing needed help. Could have used more movie tie-ins. Acting was good. Overall good show, just needed a bit of help in the writing department. Worth watching if you liked the movies.
B00E66QPCG|4.0|Well written w clear explanations and examples. Technical analysis and indicators always require &#34; faith&#34;. His money mgmt advice using the ATR for P/L targets is helpful. Money mgmt is important. Oh range bars...yeah just started w range bars and they provide imho a better way to interpret price action
B00004TB5B|2.0|One of my favorite albums but i got two record 2's (the one that starts with marshall mathers) instead of one of each record
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it. is an awesome game grandkids love it and so do i.I would recommend. this game to all my friends for them and their kids and grandkids.
B00FWLSLJ4|1.0|Not engaging. Miscast lead. Absurd mech rules. If you buy the notion that that universe has the tech wherewithal to mind meld, then it looks pretty silly when those weirdos make the large robots move by physically doing the machinations. Especially the synchronized tandem walk trudge.
B007EC27QM|4.0|I love this app!!  It is so convenient and easy. I use this app everyday. I love how big the buttons are.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I think this was a great book. I thought that they were not really open about every thing that really happen to him in space school. If they would have done that it would have been great. It was also confusing when he first see Valentin . I thought it would have been easier for him . He looks all strong and now won't show eney affection to her. So that is what I though was a little weird to me to put him in that place with the only one he really still loves in his family. That's what I though was really mean . So I will keep reading still a very good book.
1401917232|5.0|A huge thank you to Arten, Pursah, Gary and the Holy Spirit for bringing me this book. Whenever I hear the words of J I get so happy. This book once again brings me closer and closer to my purpose. Forgive the people, the world and what ever else is in my dream and GO HOME!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's the only way to describe it.  Once you start playing you just have to keep going.  A great way to spend a rainy day.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Best drama series on t.v. Right now. And now I own all three of the first seasons for $40.00. Great product.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|I know I don't want to burn out my Kindle, but when I attach this cable I get a warning message from my Kindle telling me that it is a low-power charger and that if I have any open apps it may not charge. I was hoping that a charger designed and sold for Kindle would be a little more, well, perfectly designed to charge a Kindle. I would probably buy again because it's safer to charge too slowly than too quickly, but it could be better.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Great movie. Best Star Trek movie yet. But this is the letterbox edition, so beware. If you don't enjoy watching movies that don't fill up the whole screen, you might want to get another version.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|was really for us trekkers in that it connected the dots about KHAN,Kirk&#34;s son&#34;s mother etc.<br />I was so happy with my descision to pre-order it, and especially from amazon. it came right on time<br /> as it was promised and as I am an old &#34;TREKKER&#34;  some have taken to calling us TREKKIES&#34;( which i consider<br />an insult) I don't like going to the theaters. so when my dvd came I was able to truly&#34; go where no one had gone<br />before&#34;. will be ordering again I see you have some classics and I need to upgrade  from VHS.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game I love playing the different levles pose a ever increaseing chalange which keeps you from being bord it is free so why not give it a try
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is an awesome game!  I love that you are not constricted by only five lives! You can play forever!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down.....really loved reading this book.  It was fun, dramatic, suspenseful and a good read.  Well worth it especially if you like puzzles, twists and turns, technology and a peek into the not so distant future!
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Brandon has really upped my expectations for writers of the fantasy genre. I purchased this book for my kindle expecting to find another mediocre disappointment as is normal with the kindle store, but from the very first page till the end I found myself unable to put the book down. I guess I should be angry with Brandon as I doubt any other author could entertain me as well as he has. Don't think twice about purchasing this book, it's a piece of art.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|if u like zombies this is a good one. these zombies are reckless!<br />plus its brad pitt.....bonus! buy this dvd.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing candy crush,bit keeps your mind moving it makes you want to keep trying until you get it.v
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun but not enough energy to start so its taking a while to get through the beginning goals. But I enjoy this type of game
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell does it again. Always an excellent and intriguing read. The medical background and explanations are so informative to this reader who is in the medical profession.
B008602KQI|3.0|interesting story.  so so directing.  felt like I was watching that reality show patterened after the movie.<br />Loved the costumes. blah, blah, blah
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Not only does the story capture the innocence and insecurity of the teenage years, it is told with such fresh descriptiveness and insights as to really convey the voices of the protagonists.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a wonderfully well written and well researched &#34;love&#34;  story. The plot and the characters are believable ,more than one dimensional and totally likeable.There are a few plot twists that  are well handled but are &#34;spoilers&#34; so you will just have to trust that this is not your average &#34;romance novel&#34; .The characters stayed with me for quite some time as did some of the questions raised by the plot, yet the love story was handled realistically and tenderly - bring Kleenex to this book<br />Maggie Mac
B00FEHXISA|3.0|Silly villains and just silly story line over all.  The effects are still top notch as usual but the story has gone way downhill.
B00942G4UA|5.0|I have always been one to want to know where things come from and what happens to what I eat BEFORE I buy it. Needless to say, this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Just watch it, you'll understand what I mean.
B00E9E4EC8|4.0|I love Alan Jackson and know most of the supporting cast on this CD and I expected more from him on this CD. It does not stand out as a great bluegrass album, more like what Alan has been doing early in his career.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I love this movie because is let my daughter who is into the outdoors know she can be whoever she wants to be.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Amazing collection of insights and counter-intuitive wisdom.  A bracing, intelligent and challenging book--one to be dipped into and read in bits rather than plowed through.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This so much fun,and quick. You'll have to have quick eyes and a fast hand. You will enjoy this game and if you're on Facebook you can compete with friends.
0345530578|4.0|Almost Believable<br />Grisham's twists and turns always enthrall. This reminds you of his earlier books. You almost think it could happen
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|I often had a smile on my face as I solved puzzles during the two to three hours it took me to complete this game.  Good quality throughout.  I do have to mention that it was very much a repeat of The Lost City, the previous offering from this developer.  There was a boat, an island you get to via the boat, a well, a buried item you dig up, a crevasse that must be magically bridged, and cleverly disguised solution codes to puzzles that were vaguely familiar.<br /><br />But I didn't mind too much.  Hopefully the developers make enough on this game that they can afford to create something with more original plotting and puzzles.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|The first Season is a great start to a good series . Great actors lots of drama and a good story line
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|I tried to tell everyone I knew to wait until November or December for the true version of this film. Hope they listened. Already pre-ordered my copy.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Great show Walt is an awesome character and paired with Jesse pinkman makes for a great show .. Good plot and story keeps you interested
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|This is a great app for sure. I started using it and I'm getting way better at Spanish highly recommended
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|Well for starters I've seen this movie over 20 times. This is by far one of the best children's movies made. I have a 8 year old daughter and she can't stop watching it to this day. If you have children then you need to buy this movie. You will not regret it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Keeps you wondering and thinking about what you would do if time travel was possible.<br />Wasn't sure I wanted to read this book, but very glad that I bought it.<br />Makes you think about what a person really would do if this was possible.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Enjoyed it from start to finish.<br /><br />I would recommend it to a friend and in fact have. Bloodsong is a go!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was skeptical about this Candy Crush popularity.  After playing, I now know why people can't keep their hands out of the Candy Crush jar!
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|An amazing journey<br /><br />Mr. Gladwell did his usual impeccable job of reframing rigid beliefs and positions by using well-researched data to &#34;open our eyes&#34; to different ways of perceiving things. He also happens to give hope to the seemingly downtrodden and those who believe they are underdogs. Very entertaining and a book which will be reread by many.
1594203334|5.0|This  was a gift for my friend who just give birth, she love it!!!Fast delivery,  the book was in excellent condition!!!!
B00A0ABQLM|3.0|I had wanted to use this to connect to my NVidia shield to give it a Ethernet stream that will be needed for functionality added thru a upcoming software update and for that purpose, it didn't work.  I believe it might be the usb 3.0 part of the equation although I thought everything was backwards compatible.  Didn't ding it any further as I figure it'll work for really what it's most intended for but figured I would comment on my experience on it for the sake of anyone else who may be searching for a different use for it like I was...<br /><br />I did try a usb 2.0 Ethernet adapter for my purpose and it did work
B00G8YZ48K|5.0|Really love this series!  I've seen so many zombie movies I never thought I would enjoy this as much as I do, but the characters are so great (not the zombies, the live people) that I can't wait for each new episode.  AMC just keeps cranking out the great TV shows : )
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Wow the possibilities, this Woody Allen film was wonderful, it had it all love, betrayal, fantasy, time travel, lots of old great artists and a pedantic character. It is a tour of Paris in the present and the past and the vision of the past being a better time. I enjoyed this movie.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|I love the possibility that this book opened for me. Kept me interested till the end. Its a must read
B003O86FMW|5.0|Of the apocalyptic genre of books, this series takes the cake...by far.  An absolute must read. When you buy Hunger Games, just go ahead and buy the next two at the same time!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app. I like how the application keep track of your last entry, so it's great for adding and subtracting your check book.
B000I8G5GW|5.0|Great classic. Watched it many times and could watch it again. The cinema photography is amazing considering it was made in 1957.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. The main reason is Gary Gary Oldman's performance. He is so great at being bad.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This game is scary fun!  I turn the volume on high to make it more suspenseful.  I highly recommended for those who enjoy this character.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|As a newbie it was a little challenging wrapping my mind around the concept of this app but stick with it and your mind will open up to the power and convenience of this software.  All your info at your finger tips on any device, any format, anytime.
B00CITOS4A|4.0|Very humorous and to the point, no theories, no lengthy explanation. Highly recommended as a companion with other theory based books.
B008NCSZQ8|1.0|I thought it was dumb and pointless.  It was chosen by my wife, who has different tastes in movies from mine.
