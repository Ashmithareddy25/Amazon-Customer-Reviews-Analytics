B001GCUO1G|5.0|First of all I would like to point out that Victor Creed/Sabertooth stole the show for me. I just thought that his sadistic sarcastic character was gratifying in a twisted dark kind of way. But Wolverine was pretty darn cool too. I wish Gambit and Deadpool would have got a little more screen time, there stints in the movie were by far to short. The action is non stop so all us testosterone hack and slash lovers will leave this movie feeling satisfied. It even should be appealing to the ladies since Jackman prances around alot barley dressed. Overall I think this movie is absoultly fantastic. I highly recommend.
B001K3JF7K|4.0|Take this review with a grain of salt: I think Diana Krall has one of the best singing voices around today that, if she released an album singing the phone book, I would buy it.  That being said, Quiet Nights is not like her other albums.  This album is extremely mellow.  No Devil May Care, Popsicle Toes, or Frim Fram Sauce here.  One thing that stood out for me was her choice of a couple of covers that originally had some distinctive instrumentals that were left out on this album.  Both Boy From Ipanema and Walk On By left out the signature saxophone accompaniments that helped make the originals classics.  They both sounded as if something were missing, like the sax player couldn't make it to the recording session.  To say that this is not her best album is really a reflection on how good the others are rather than a critique of this one.  This is definitely worth buying and listening to.
0783240287|5.0|I am really in awe of how this was put together... Donny Osmond really made it believeable.  I liked the Pharoah's interpretation of Elvis and the song of Benjamin.  Really alot of fun to watch and sing along with!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is smart, witty, funny, and sexy! The characters are great.  The acting is fabulous.  The plots are interesting and well- written.  And the sexual tension between the two main characters rivals the classics - Moonlighting, X-Files, etc. It's definitely my favorite show!

B00127RAJY|5.0|This dvd is exactly what I wanted it. 3 different work out levels, and they're all intense. It's a great dvd and it makes me want to really keep up with the 30 days. I've already seen results after 10 days so I'm anxious to see the results after 30! You will not be disappointed with this product, if you are ready to work hard and lose weight then this is the perfect workout dvd for you!

1848310293|5.0|Kumar's book on the history of early twentieth century physics and atomic theory skips from page to page, fleshing out scientific expanations with vivid descriptions of the key protagonists. It is a real skill to make sophisticated scientific theories accessible to the lay person, but Kumar's use of metaphor helps bring the most intangible concepts to life.  This is a modern classic, but more important, a really fun read.
0307474275|1.0|This book is a good example of why the review \\"stars\\" should have the option to go below zero.  I'd give it a minus two stars.
0385751893|5.0|The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a dark book told perfectly through the eyes of a nine year old boy named Bruno who lives in Nazi Germany. The unique balance of innocence and horror makes for a very interesting read and a deeper overall message.             Most Holocaust books are more realistic and straight to the point, but John Boyne leaves much for the reader to infer or imagine. For example, when Lieutenant Kotler got mad at a prisoner who worked as a server at Bruno's house, all Boyne said is \\"it made Bruno cry and Gretel (Bruno's sister) grow pale.\\" He doesn't give any details other than that of what the Lieutenant might have done to the prisoner. Although I didn't always like having to fill in the blanks myself, I don't think the book would have the same innocent feel it possesses if details were included.            Some people may argue that the book is not factual and unrealistic: Bruno should have known more about Hitler and the war and been less naïve. It is in a child's nature to be innocent and selfish, and Boyne implies that Bruno's led a pretty sheltered life. Also, in my opinion, Bruno's naivety is crucial to the story and doesn't matter in the overall meaning of the book. If the story wasn't told from a child's perspective I think it would have been too dark and not have the mood that Boyne was aiming for. The logistics of the book shouldn't matter anyway. The book is meant to show the horrors of the Holocaust and how most regular German people didn't know about it. Looking at the big picture, the little details shouldn't mean anything.              I really liked The Boy in the Striped Pajamas because the ending was so impactful. It made me think about the tragedy of the Holocaust more than any other book. I may never fully understand the horrors of it all, but at least this book brought me a little closer.
B00003CXWV|3.0|This movie was just okay.  I thought it would have been much better.  Decent.
B000001ES9|5.0|I've got a few hundred mostly hard rock albums from the 70's and 80's and this disk has been one of my favorites since I bought it on vinyl 20 some years ago.  I've noticed that this only gets 3 1/2 stars overall, which has started to bug me since that's a pretty weak rating for music on Amazon.  I guess it's because most people were disappointed when they bought back in the catalogue after RUSH hit it huge that the first RUSH album was not like the prog Rush they hear on all the other albums--overall this is straight up hard-driven rock and roll something along the lines of Foghat and earlier Kiss.  And this disk has great musical balance and it's full of memorable, catchy tunes.  The whole thing is just awesomely good!  Geddy Lee belts 'em out here like nowhere else in their catalogue except some spots on 2112.  \\"Finding My Way\\" is a great intro into the album, as a feel-good rocker.  \\"Take a Friend\\" adds another song along those lines.  Then they rip it up with ones like \\"What You're Doing\\" and \\"Here and After\\", which remind me of some of the meanest and best by the 80's metal group Fastway.  The only song from this disk that gets any airplay is \\"Working Man\\", which is great, but--at least I think--not necessarily a standout on this album since all the tracks are so consistently good.  Rush went prog after this, but definitely not because they had to.  The kind of talent going on here could have taken them in many directions.  The change could have come with introduction of new drummer, Neil Peart, on the second album.  Anyway, if you're a Rush or Prog. 'fan' and carry all that baggage that fans often do, then you're less likely to like this.  But if you love just great, straight up hard rock with nice raw production and recording, then you'll wear out your player with this really great album--most enthusiastically recommended!!!
B001JNNE64|5.0|Love this movie.  One scene was particularly revealing, so be careful when watching with children.

B001QWBM62|5.0|I've been using the Zoom H2 for approximately a year. On the strength of the company's product description, I have now purchased the Zoom H4n. While the H2 seemingly met all desired requirements of a portable digital recorder, I find the H4n a worthy replacement.<br />What I like about the H4n:<br />- sturdy construction and design (doesn't feel plasticky at all)<br />- jack for external mic plus 2 XLR ports<br />- *stamina* mode for batteries, extending the life of 2 AAs to 11 hours<br />- gain control slider now replaced by +/- switch<br />- much easier menu operation, including larger, brighter screen<br />- accommodates up 32G sdhc cards<br />- quick access to 90/120 degree mic positions<br />- unbelievable sound reproduction, even using built-in mics<br />- on-board speaker, which cuts out when headphones are in<br />- hard plastic carry case provided.<br /><br />Now what I find less pleasing:<br />- it is noticably larger and heavier than the H2<br />- no stand provided, so you'll have to buy a mini tripod, preferably one  that ensures the unit will sit low and securely on any surface<br />- the external 3.5mm mic jack is situated on the back; not exactly ideal<br />- seems to take fractionally longer to boot, especially in stamina mode<br />- English translation in manual can be confusing.<br /><br />Despite any slight faults I've found with the H4n, I have used it extensively over the last week and find it a remarkable piece of tech.  I'm glad I opted for the upgraded model.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:  Since penning the above review, I've discovered that it's possible to record only in .wav format in Stamina mode, not mp3, thus using up more precious space on the sdhc card.  As I use Vapex 2900mAh rechargeable batteries and change over halfway thru the day, I'm able to use mp3, use up little card space, and battery power is absolutely no problem.
B000QYBB6M|5.0|Listening to the sounds of Africa, he looked at her in the darkness, at this woman who was everything to him--mother, Africa, wisdom, understanding. Mma Ramotswe, the first lady detective in her village, is all of this and more. This story tells us of the white sky across the endless bush and what it means to say O Botswana, my country, my place. I read this book not because of its recent popularity, and the fact that it is being made into a film for HBO, but because I want to go to Africa. This tale gave me what I believe is an authentic slice of African life in a small village with one foot in the 21st century. Superb, masterful writing provides insights into a culture experiencing growing pains, but rooted in the red soil of Africa. McCall Smith made me want to know, the vast plains beneath huge orange sun and the woof and snort of wild things that go bump in the night, but it also brought me closer to the people who call this dry land home.<br />Linda Ballou
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This is such a great show - A new look at the typical crime drama that has been done. I've suggested the show to heaps of friends and can't wait for new episodes each week. I look forward to seeing how the other cops characters are developed and to see how the writers develop the tension between Castle and Becket. (Spelling?)     The daughter is great, the mom is a riot, and I just really like the range of characters presented in the show - a refreshing change on the cop show idea.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|Robert Kenner's movie is a perfect illustration of F. William Engdahl's book `Seeds of Destruction', which explains how international agribusinesses are trying to monopolize vertically and horizontally (and profit from) food production on a world scale.    The world's food chain is built mainly on heavily subsidized and, therefore, cheap corn. In fact, all humans chew corn the whole day long from bread over meat (all animals are fed with corn) to deserts and drinks. Transnational corporations are even trying to learn fish to eat corn. Corn becomes nearly a food monoculture.  A particular transnational company even developed through genetic engineering highly efficient corn seed which it patented, thereby creating a nearly seed monopoly. Buyers cannot use the produce of the seeds as plant seed for future harvests. The company's own inspection force controls with hawk eyes that its clients buy new genetically modified seed every year. Some of the company's supporters and former directors occupy key positions in US governments and government administrations (FDA).    The movie shows the disastrous effects of intensive farming on animals, as well as the health and environmental risks of diminished standards at livestock farming and slaughtering houses.  Fortunately, some biological farmers show more respect for their animals and for their clients.    At the end of the movie, the makers give a perfect list of recommendations for those wishing to eat `healthy' food.     This movie is a must see for all those who want to understand the world we live in.
B001RTP48G|3.0|First, let me start by saying that the Pet Shop Boys are one of my favorite artists. I have all of their albums, and I started listening to them when I was 13 years old way back in May 1986. I have lived the Pet Shop Boys--through their ups and through their lows and everything in between. I saw them live in 1999 for their \\"Nightlife\\" tour.<br /><br />That being said, I listen to \\"Yes\\" with critical ears. There are some great songs, more good songs and a few forgettable songs.<br /><br />The best songs on the album are easily their first single \\"Love, etc.\\", \\"All Over The World\\", \\"More Than A Dream\\" and \\"Building A Wall\\", plus the non-album track (which I added to the album), and perhaps the best song on the entire disc, \\"This Used To Be The Future\\" with Phil Oakey of The Human League (another of my favorites, and in dire need of a new album). \\"This Used To Be The Future\\" has all the right elements--a strong synth melody, interesting lyrics and Phil Oakey to give Neil Tennant a foil.<br /><br />The good songs are \\"Beautiful People\\", \\"Vulnerable\\", \\"Pandemonium\\", \\"The Way It Used To Be\\" and \\"Legacy\\". These songs keep the album afloat, but they're not made of the same quality as the best songs here.<br /><br />The apalling songs are \\"Did You See Me Coming?\\" and \\"King Of Rome\\". \\"Did You See Me Coming?\\" is particularly cringe-worthy and \\"King Of Rome\\" is downright dull.<br /><br />Let's talk about the production of \\"Yes\\". There seems to be a lot of hoo-hah about the Pet Shop Boys working with Xenomania, a hot production team in Europe (but not the U.S.) at the moment. I don't see what the big deal is. \\"Yes\\" sounds just like a typical Pet Shop Boys album should sound, and Xenomania didn't really update the duo's sound that much. I don't get the 'modern' comments and accolades. The Pet Shop Boys have always used different producers over the years, and to be honest, they're still the Pet Shop Boys in the end. I can't say that the duo has ever met my criteria for a drastically adventurous change in sound (which I would really like to hear from Tennant and Lowe).<br /><br />In the end, \\"Yes\\" or \\"Yes, etc.\\" (which is what I bought), is good, but not great Pet Shop Boys. It's not terrible, it's serviceable. It will pass the time inoffensively. I'll also add that, according to my records, the Pet Shop Boys haven't had a top 40 album since 1996's \\"Bilingual\\", and they haven't sold 500,000 copies of an album since 1993's \\"Very\\" in the United States. This leads me to believe that American audiences are quite fickle about the Pet Shop Boys, and I have no idea who's reading this review but other hardcore fans like myself. I plan to keep buying and listening and reviewing the Pet Shop Boys until they throw in the towel, but here's how \\"Yes\\" compares to the duo's other work:<br /><br />1986 Please: Five Stars<br />1986 Disco: Two Stars<br />1987 Actually: Five Stars<br />1988 Introspective: Two and a Half Stars<br />1990 Behaviour: Three Stars<br />1991 Discography: Five Stars<br />1993 Very: Five Stars<br />1994 Disco 2: One Star<br />1995 Alternative: Five Stars<br />1996 Bilingual: Five Stars<br />1999 Nightlife: Four Stars<br />2002 Release: Four Stars<br />2003 Disco 3: Three and a Half Stars<br />2003 PopArt: Five Stars<br />2006 Fundamental: Three and a Half Stars<br />2007 Disco 4: Two Stars<br />2009 Yes: Three and a Half Starsly adventurous change in sound (which I would really like to hear from Tennant and Lowe).<br /><br />In the end, \\"Yes\\" or \\"Yes, etc.\\" (which is what I bought), is good, but not great Pet Shop Boys.

1440468397|1.0|I must say Jane Austen is incredibly boring and all her novels are stories of women's aspirations to marry wealthy and noble men to support them.  Most great literature is so wonderful because of its timelessness, touching on universal feelings and ideas.  While it may have been groundbreaking in its time, it is so dull now.  We women have already established our desires of equality in culture and have already acknowledged at least an inkling of what feminine independence is but this novel is a back step.  Also, it is so predictable.  Of course all of the characters will end up married, and most likely to their man of choice.  This book is dull and predictable and is restricted by its time period.  If you want to delve into the past then maybe pick it up, but otherwise, it's unexciting, and it still feeds on social classes and marriage as a woman's reliance on a man for social and fiscal support.

B001MEJY8W|5.0|A troubled girl named Lucile (Myleine Jampanoi) was physically abused as a child where she joins up with other abused friend Anna (Mojrana Alaoui) together to seek revenge on those that abused them as they later into a nightmare of living hell.<br /><br />Brutal and powerful horror thriller from France and Canada is a unique and nerve-wrecking shocker at it's best. Last year there was the excellent \\"Inside\\" and the quite good \\"Frontier(S)\\" as the tradition in French horror continues with this brand new masterpiece of the macabre. It's not just any mere torture porn movie then some would say, it's a movie that grabs you with emotion even suffering through some of the unfortunate victims they go through in hell in their eyes. It has one punch of a first half with the slaughter of a family including a young girl with an angressive second half that puts you into the pain of a sufferer going through Martyrdom even with a small bit of child abuse in the movie, it's better then your typical \\"Saw\\" wannabe for it's a movie about some of the horrors that the world can really be like secretly. This is half a feel-good and half a feel-bad kind of movie that never lets go in one intense ride you won't ever forget. The acting is superb including the direction, editing and production values even with the brilliant realistic gore that looks almost realistic, this is strongly recommended but not for the faint hearted but for hard horror fans.<br /><br />This DVD contains the unrated version with footage not shown in the U.S. R-rated cut with both the French language with English subs and English dubbed languages, the extras including teaser and trailer with featurette.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Inside\\", \\"Frontier(S)\\", \\"Maniac (1980)\\", \\"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer\\", \\"Pieces\\", \\"High Tension\\", \\"The Toxic Avenger\\", \\"Captivity\\", \\"Bloodsucking Freaks\\", \\"Hostel 1 & 2\\", \\"Saw Series\\", \\"Men Behind The Sun\\", \\"The Untold Story\\", \\"The Last House on The Left (1972 and 2009)\\", \\"The Hills Have Eyes (1977 and 2006)\\", \\"The New York Ripper\\", \\"Funny Games (1997 and 2007)\\", \\"House on The Edge of the Park\\", \\"Hellraiser 1 & 2\\", \\"The Ordeal\\", \\"Anatomy\\", \\"Cannibal Ferox\\", \\"Jungle Holocaust (a.k.a.

031606792X|5.0|I loved how she ended the series leaving room for more to follow. I thought when I was reading the other books she could have never pulled it off. I do feel she could have put more in this book about the rest of the Cullens. But, having said that the last of the series hit a home run. I do wish she would write more on Edward and the Cullens. I truly loved the series.
B001TW68P4|5.0|The Camaro ditty is fun.  One could easily knitpick about what periphery was included or not, but this FloEdCo collection is well concieved and sounds utterly brilliant.

1401207529|5.0|art is very modern and realistic. color is very crisp and clear, much better than previous editions/original comics. story is captivating; shows you the beginning of Batman and his internal conflict. what I don't like is the portrayal of Selina Kyle as a whore. it's a good story though with a nice ending.
B001TODCII|4.0|TAKEN shouldn't be any good.  It should be boring and predictable, with more plot holes than a slice of Swiss cheese riddled by machine-gun fire.  It should be a dull popcorn piece of entertainment and nothing more.<br /><br />But it isn't.  Instead, it's an edge-of-your-seat adrenaline rush from opening to close, a barrage of bullets and kick-a** moves that leaves you reeling.  Sure, it's cliched, and sure, almost all of the stunts here are theoretically impossible, but the amazing thing is that you never really care.  Liam Neeson's quest to save his daughter from the world of sex slave trafficking is a rollicking ride, fueled by Neeson's acting chops (finally, an action hero who uses his brain as much as his fists, and not to mention some silver-tongued threats) and director Pierre Morel's sense of style.  (Let's also not forget writer/producer Luc Besson, who's brought us such contemporary action classics as \\"The 5th Element\\" and the genuinely awe-inspiring \\"Leon, The Professional\\").  TAKEN isn't necessarily an action movie with brains; it's more of an action movie where you don't care if it has brains or not.  It has gravitas (in the form of Neeson, and let's face it, that was probably one of the best and most surprising casting decisions of the past decade) and skill, and will leave you gasping for breath and cheering for a genuinely likable hero who has \\"a certain set of skills\\" and knows exactly how to put them to use.
B001GCUO1G|4.0|Entering the theater today I was expecting the worst after reading many negative reviews, but I have to say that X-Men Origins: Wolverine was pure popcorn entertainment. I know it's not in the same league as the second X-Men film or in the same galaxy as something like The Dark Knight, but I really liked some of the characters and action scenes. The CGI is pretty good for the most part, though for some reason Wolverine's claws looked terrible when he is inspecting the new metal for the first time in the bathroom. Hugh Jackman could play this character in his sleep, but thankfully he put a lot into the role yet again (dude must lift some serious weights). I also thought Liev Schreiber made a fantastic Sabertooth. He doesn't overact the part and manages to inject the right amount of menace. Sadly, fan favorites like Deadpool and Gambit (been waiting for him to enter the mix since the first X-Men movie) aren't given much to do and amount to little screen time. The story itself wasn't as bad as I feared and it moved at a good pace, while leaving room for some quieter moments early on.<br /><br />I enjoyed Watchmen when it came out of couple of months ago and I understand why some didn't. This flick is like the anti-Watchmen. Its sole purpose is to provide the goods for everyone and not trying to be anything special. I'm sure Star Trek, Terminator: Salvation and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will all overshadow this one, but I must admit that Wolverine isn't a bad way to start off the summer movie season.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars

B001GCUO1G|2.0|I went into this movie knowing that it would have some slight differences from the comic book story. But I didn't expect 90 percent of the movie to be different!!! I was extremely disappointed with this movie. Not only was the story warped but they also warped the powers and capabilities of certain characters. The special effects and the fight scenes were on point but the story line blew it for me. If you are a avid comic book fan like me you will not like this movie. If you don't know any better you will probably love it.

0140277447|5.0|A new German film about the role of a German resident of Nanking/Nanjing at the time of the invasion in 1937 reminded me to look at Iris Chang's book again and read some of the reviews here. (The film is called John Rabe after the 'good German of Nanking', a man who used his leading position in the expatriate community to try and protect Chinese civilians against atrocities.)<br /><br />Iris Chang made the documentation of the 'rape of Nanking' her life's calling. It haunted her so much that she committed suicide some time after the book was published (I have not looked into possible other explanations for this, so there may have been other factors involved.)<br /><br />For me, the documentation of atrocities committed by the Japanese invasion forces looks convincing. However, there is a very vocal Japanese denial movement voicing their disagreement. If you look at the amazon ratings for the book, about 1/3 of over 300 votes have 1-starred the book. If you check this, you will find that most of these votes are from dissenting Japanese. The issue is historical truth.<br />While relations between China and Japan are not in their most unfriendly phase right now, disagreement over history is underlying most of the conflicts that have occurred in recent years. They can flare up any time again.<br />If I want to find fault with the book (assuming that only minor inaccuracies can be shown to have happened in its publication, which is nearly unavoidable), I would focus on the subtitle. The allegation that these events are forgotten is absurd occidentalism and must have been invented by the marketing department of the publishers. It is certainly not forgotten among East Asians.
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|This remake is really disappointing and doesn't even come close to capturing the wonder of the original. The writers aimed this movie at 5 and 6 year old kids, but I think even they would be bored to tears as the action doesn't start until two thirds of the film has elapsed! Even when the film gets going.....so to speak, it's so tame and ridiculous that you would be much better off watching a classic like 'Pinocchio' or even the Saturday morning TV show 'Land Of The Lost' for more drama!<br /><br />I like Brendan Frasier, but he has made some extremely bad film choices over the years, hey I know....who can argue with a couple of million dollars to do this stuff?. Right?....... I'd probably do it too!<br /><br />In short, the CGI is unconvincing, the film is beyond juvenile and the story is really stupid and boring, it even seemed long for it's 85 minute running time and 10 minutes of that are opening and closing credits. I like the cast, but even they can't save this one from falling into a bottomless pit!
B001TH16DS|5.0|Original Star Trek in a beautiful transfer, what else could you want? I have not bought any Star Trek DVDs before, and I am very happy with getting these excellent Blu-rays discs. And of course the first season is classic creative television. It's been a long time since I've seen these all, and unedited no less.    People ask if the 60s TV shows are really \\"hi-def\\"? The transfer from the original film is definitely better than standard TV, the colors are beautiful, but the camera focus is not really 1080p sharp. It is actually good that the film focus is not that sharp, I don't think it ruins the illusion of the makeup and props that much. I have a 42\\" LCD 1080p.    Extras are okay, but the shows are what counts. Would have been good if they had the original \\"The Cage\\" episode, and if they had lots of extras concerning the two pilots and the early shows and how the show evolved and outtakes, that would have been interesting.    Now what surprises me is how people like the redone special effects so much. The new visuals are a very mixed bag. The new visual effects are sometimes done very subtle and follow the spirit of the original visuals, but other times they are basically re-imagining and trying to improve the original. Sometimes the new visual effects stick out and look way out of place, way too digital looking. The new planets do look good most of the time. Some of the shots of the ship are good, while other shots seem way too video game-ish and seem inappropiate.  The galactic barrier in \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" has been changed to something much less dramatic with different camera angles, and the shuttlecraft space shots in \\"Galileo Seven\\" have been changed totally. They should not change the original visuals that much 40 years after the fact, they do not have the same dramatic effect, they do not look constistant with the source material of the original creators, and quite frankly the two examples I give look \\"modern\\" but second rate, like scenes from alame video game. On the good side the updated space visuals in \\"Balance of Terror\\" at least try to be more faithful to the original visuals, and they fit in better. The updated visuals should have been more faithful to the original visuals artistic vision. Remaster and clean up maybe, maybe imitate, but change and \\"improve\\" by some hacks 40 years later so it looks updated? No! There should have been some restraint. I am glad they have the original visuals on this set also.
0780626966|5.0|If you're a fan of the series, it just doesn't get much better than this, amazing amounts of footage on the bonus disc and lots of goodies, every movie of the series, all for a very nice price. Very good buy.
B001TOD92C|1.0|OW, ow, and oh yeah .....ow.  This is violence for violence's sake.  This could have been such a great story of redemption between a father and estranged daughter but somewhere it gets off track and I'm watching a man shove his own hand into a meat slicer.  Marisa looks exceptional for her age though....the years have been kind.
B001F9Y2CM|3.0|If you're the completist, whose sensibility almost always goes out the window; whose hard earned money goes out just as fast, then go ahead...blow it! I just did :)<br /><br />But if you are a bit of a pragmatist and own their lavish, velvetty boxed set \\"the complete studio collection\\" from 2005, you might want to pass.<br /><br />For one, the cd's and sleeves look exactly the same as the 2005 set, albeit without the bonus tracks. Second, audio quality, having been digitalized and remastered by the same blokes, masters of audio, is the same. These are the same folks who ruined Agnetha's \\"Wrap Your Arms Around Me\\" and Frida's \\"Something's Going On\\" remasters from 2005. When i heard that Universal will release yet another boxed set of the Swedish monolith's recorded work, i would have expected them to set history straight by including ABBA's spanish album \\"Gracias Por La Musica\\"...to my non surprise but nonetheless utter disappointment, they still blew that chance, so this would be the third reason not to buy it.<br /><br />Although both Universal and ABBA have sole prerogative on how to market their body of work, they should realize that we fans, who've made the music a part of our lives by buying their records, are aware of the fact that 9 albums were OFFICIALLY released and not 8. And I'm not even counting in 1986's \\"ABBA-Live\\" which should actually bring the tally to 10 bona fide albums.<br /><br />I can't see the reason why their Spanish album, which has done well in both South America, Spain and even Japan, continues to be denied its rightful place. Such revisionism, may backfire. Who knows, someone or something might knock some sense into me and might choose not to buy another, if Universal milks their catalog one more time with another boxed set.
061891868X|2.0|The first 75% or so of the book is what I paid for- a recap of modern physics with an emphasis on string theory and the potential issues with the theory. This part was very good, but somewhat redundant with Smolin's \\"Three Roads To Quantum Gravity\\" and perhaps a bit too heavy on the case for the prosecution.  The final 25% of the book is downright embarrassing for the author. All manner of ad hominems, invective, unbelievable 3rd-hand anecdotes (and a few unbelievable 1st-hand anecdotes, unfortunately, which lead me to doubt the author's own honesty). Smolin relies on these anecdotes (along with quotes from random blogs and his own incessant rhetorical attacks on the character, intelligence, and honesty of string theorists) to make his case- not a case against string theory itself (which he does in the first parts of the book), but a case against the people praticing string theory.  String theorists are \\"fanatics\\", following \\"fads and fashions\\" and suffering from \\"a sense of entitlement.\\" They are \\"true believers\\", \\"brash\\", \\"swaggering\\", \\"competitive\\", and \\"ignorant\\". They suffer from \\"groupthink\\", a \\"fashion-driven style\\" of research, and \\"show little evidence of independent judgement or originality\\". They are \\"messianic\\", and string theory \\"has become a religion\\"- that is, when they are not practicing \\"outright misrepresentation\\" or \\"persistent exaggeration [to] benefit string theory over its rivals.\\"  [Ironically, among his litany of complaints is that \\"the intelligence and professional competence of non-string theorists is questioned in remarkably unpleasant terms.\\"]  What Smolin does not see is the light in which this part of the book casts him- he is clearly resentful of the share of attention (from both grant-providers and the general public) not going to his particular interests. He comes across as petty, mean, and much less interested in finding the truth than in defending 'his' side and attacking 'them'.    That isn't to say that the physics community doesn't have issues- as an outsider Im not able to judge. But Smolin's rhetoric is unhinged, and he damages his ability to convince an unbiased observer with his vitriol.    I would recommend \\"Three Roads To Quantum Gracity\\" by Smolin instead.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|It took my watching it three times, first in VHS and later in DVD, concentrating in the music and choreography and now I love it!  It is a wonderful musical but you have to give it the chance to grow on you.  Now I find myself humming its music and lyrics at the oddest times.  If you like music and dancing, do yourself a favor and purchase this one.  Besides, chances are no other musical like it will EVER be produced, so own a part of musical history and pass it on to your grandchildren.
B001PPGAIA|3.0|There are lots of things to like about Australia - memorable characters, beautiful scenery, and some great emotional moments.     At the same time, though, the movie is somehow incoherent. It feels like it's been cut down from a miniseries in order fit the screen time of a feature film.     As a result, what we are left with is a disjoint mix of very good scenes that do not add up to a coherent whole.
0930289234|5.0|If you're one of those people (like me) who like to see it as a movie, fine...go see the movie, but afterwards READ THE BOOK! It was hard for me to put it down once I started.<br />If you haven't seen the movie, then good for you! Just buy it and let the novel speak for its self.
B00005NKKY|4.0|Simon & Garfunkel- Bookends ****<br /><br />Bookends is the [...] love child of the folk-ish movement of the mid to late 1960's. It's to cool to belong to that genre and tag so people claim to hate it because of it's experimental departures while they actual admire the adversity which it presents. Which in essence is the point of all folk-ish music really. Bookends is the album many love to hate and many hate to love; I belong in the later, hell I could run the fan club.<br /><br />This semi conceptual album of growing up in America as you watch the elderly then ageing less than gracefully just as fast is with out question the crowning achievement from the duo of Simon & Garfunkel. The experimentation alone on tracks like 'Save The Life Of My Child' and 'Overs' alone makes the album head and shoulders above most the rest of the releases of the time and way above the groups 'classic' Bridge Over Troubled Water. But what is fantastic about the experimentation is what also faults the album; while it gives it a feel of nostalgia and clearly points to the late 1960's especially because of Simon's lyrical content and the production it also dates the album. Albeit the album has aged wonderfully for as old as it is though the fell is very dated.<br /><br />Tracks like the brilliantly poignant 'America' which was used in the great film Almost Famous to express why the daughter had to fun away to be a flight attendant because she couldn't talk about it she had to listen to rock music. The track is timeless and perfectly picturesque of the movement at the time of its release. 'Fakin It' was a hit single and for good reason, the lyrics and melody are super catchy, Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel harmonize greatly and Simon's awesome acoustic riffery adds a nice feel. The rest of the album more or less follows suit.<br /><br />However, some of the album is lop sided. The somehow classic 'Mrs. Robinson' aside from the nice Americana lyric of Simon has little to offer to the over all album and feels seriously out of place and in general, weak. The experimentation of 'Voices of Old People' as a single track throws off the flow of the album and the pace. While I admire the risk it does weaken the whole. It would have been better suited as backing for say...'Old Friends.' Also 'Punkys Dilemma' is uselessly stupid. Simple as that.<br /><br />Bookends is a classic yet challenging listen which in retrospect is the sort of listen I must want to have the pleasure of having enter my ears. Simon & Garfunkel thrive here like they never did before or after; and their solo careers...please...give me Bookends any day of the week because this is everything that a good album should and really has to be.of place and in general, weak.

074356619X|4.0|For the longest time, I refused to buy this book. It was overhyped and appeared a direct rip off of all those \\"DaVinci Code\\" inspired clones. But after beginning to study Unity School of Christianity and other new thought teachings, I gave in to my curiosity -- and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The ideas presented here are NOT new and are definitely no secret. They are precisely what are taught by Unity as well as Religious Science and other New Thought groups. However, the book, and the movie (which at first viewing seems hockey beyond belief) provide a truly uplifting and motivational approach to the teachings. It's like having your coach give you a pep talk about life.<br /><br />If this had been my first introduction to the power of the law of attraction (or the law of mind action, as Unity puts it), I do not think I would have accepted it very well. Devoid of almost all spiritual basis and depending on a very superficial and partially erroneous scientific explanation, it would not have satisfied me.<br /><br />However, having already established an understanding (albeit an incomplete and ever changing one) of the way the universal intelligence works through and in us, I was more open to the messages in the book and film.<br /><br />So far, I *have* had interesting results. Are they simply the product of positive thinking? I don't know. But I will continue working with the principles and see what happens. I'm keeping an open mind -- which you definitely need to get anything out of this book.<br /><br />I will say that I'm amazed at how many people are so close-minded that they disregard even the *possibility* that this human potential exists, without even trying it for themselves. I thought the first rule of any rational, scientific, endeavor was to be objective. Without trying something, how do you KNOW it won't work?
B0013D8LOK|4.0|If you haven't seen this film and are expecting something bizarre from the collaboration director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp.....well, you're going to get it!     This is different......mainly because most of the dialog is sung, like an opera. However, at least half of that is half spoken-half sung so it isn't really operatic.     Burton displays his usual dark visions and wonderful cinematography and Depp plays his normal strange, dark character. I can't say that all the singing appealed to me, but the actors did a credible job with it. In fact, Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and company surprised me how well they all sang considering they aren't known for that talent.    One other major warning: some of the bloody scenes are pretty graphic. There will be a number of people who will turn their heads at a few scenes. That doesn't start for awhile, however, as the first third of film sets up the premise.    What I found most appealing was the comedy. The wildest character was \\"Signor Adolfo Pirelli,\\" a guy pretending to be a famous Italian barber and played - incredibly - by Sacha Baron Cohen....yes, \\"Borat,\\" himself! I only wish his role had been a little bigger. The other guy who made me laugh was Timothy Spall as \\"Beadle Bamford.\\" He was so bad, he was good! Some of the lyrics in the songs also were humorous. All the comedy is a mixture of dark and light stuff.    It seems like most of the scenes in this film were either very dark and foreboding or filled with outrageous dark humor. There wasn't much middle ground. I suspect you'll either stick with the film and enjoy it or be tempted to toss it in the garbage can before it's over. Either way, you'll have a definite opinion of this movie!
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Fabulous . . . big sound, big production. A must for fans of the genre. Epic stuff.
B00003CY0V|3.0|John Travolta as \\"Gabriel Shear\\" was riveting as an anti-terrorist terrorist. The early explosion scene where people are flying sideways is awesome, particularly in the sound department if you have surround system. Oh, and yes, Halle Berry and her figure was on display in this film and quite a sight. Wowzer!    Some of this script is a takeoff on Dog Day Afternoon, which Travolta's character re-enacts a role from that famous '70s film. \\"Shear\\" talks about that movie during the film.    A few warnings: there is so much computer terminology that I was lost. However, if you find yourself in a similar spot, take heart because that that ends after that first 30 minutes and is no longer a problem.  The film also has a strong left-wing bias (wow, what a shock), but it's still fun for at least one viewing.  After that, it loses its appeal.
B00000373U|1.0|Product arrived so long after purchase that I assumed it had been lost in the mail; at least three weeks elapsed between purchase and my receipt of the item.  When it finally did arrive, the product was not as described; it had so many deep, visible scratches that it won't play at all in most CD players.  If it does play, it skips uncontrollably every 4-6 seconds, halts, repeats, and is generally unlistenable.  Don't get me wrong, I love Elliott Smith, but I would NEVER buy from this seller again
B001NLL93W|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. the whole series was awesome. I laughed and cried throughout the book and finished with a smile on my face. Cassandra Clare is an amazing author and I hope to see more from her in the future. You won't be dissappointed.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|brilliant blend of lyrics and imagery as well as a clever use of lyrics for a story line. loved it!
0143113100|5.0|I have been intellectually enthralled by this book, which describes case studies and research about our brain's amazing capacity for change, growth and adaptation.  So many books about the brain quickly become tedious reading to the non-neuroscientist, but this one continued to keep my interest and curiosity through every chapter.  I have recommended it to everyone I know who has even a mild interest in how the brain works.  So much of what I learned about the brain back in college is so obsolete and often wrong, so this was an important update for me.  This book offers a great deal of hope to people with brain-related disorders and injuries -- and normal aging.  I cannot recommend it highly enough!
B000U0O9FM|5.0|Promsing myself to finish the book ere I even glance at the motion picture was an excellent choice. A friend of mine remarked that it was rumored that the movie was better, I told him he should read the book. The colinear love-triangle between the narrator, Tyler, and Marla is better developed here.  In the book you begin to understand Tyler's origimal purpose in the life of the narrator, and how Tyler turned against that purpose for his own self-preservation. The imagery is also fully developed. I particularly enjoyed the idea of a refrigerator filled with exotic and gourmet condiments, but no real food.
B001RTP48G|5.0|I have all of their albums.  This becomes my first instinctly.  My previous was 'Very'.  This one is uncomparable to any of their previous works.  I know they never stopped improving their sound, but this one was a real surprise.    My best is 'Love etc' and 'King of Rome' and 'Pandemonium'.  Oh, no.  Actually all of the singles in this album.    Not even one song is useless!!!!
B001PPGAIA|3.0|Well, I'm sorry that I didn't find the movie THAT entertaining.  I have a \\"movie test\\" - if my husband will watch it in one sitting.  Otherwise, we watch movies in segments - maybe half one night before going to sleep and half the next night.  Really long ones may be watched over three evenings.  A really GOOD movie is one that he is willing to stay up and watch to the end.<br /><br />My husband got bored with Australia pretty quick.  So, we turned it off and went to sleep.  The next night, we managed to watch it through to where Kidman and what's-'is-face got together and were on the ranch and the bad guy visits her and she says that \\"Drover mustn't know...\\"  So, right there, neither of us wanted to watch anymore.  That was it. That is such a cheap plot trick we couldn't bear being dragged over the coals with that one again.<br /><br />Kidman's acting was pedestrian at best - I just couldn't warm up to her.  The kid was cute but not THAT cute and everything else was cliche or smarmy.  I doubt that the representation of aboriginal life (and characters) was accurate.  I guess the best part of the movie was the cinematography - but that was more like a David Attenborough \\"Living Planet\\" thing than anything else.  In fact, I half expected him to leap into the scene wearing his bush outfit and a pith helmet and tell us all about what kinds of creatures Kidman and company really are and what they were doing there.<br /><br />I would give it two stars for the plot and acting, but it makes it to three for the photography.<br /><br />I'd rather watch Attenborough.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|This movie is a great movie.  Andrew Davies is truly a great screen writer.  Claire Foy, Matthew McFayden, Tom Courteney, Judy Parfitt (the actress that played the part of Mrs. Clennam), Andy Serkis (the actor that played the part of Rigaud), and the other cast members performed very well.  It is a movie worth watching.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|This CD/DVD set is a inspiring tribute to the beauty and power of music. The quality of the DVD is great! You will truly enjoy each performance and it makes an excellent gift. The four people I have given this set to loves it. You just cannot go wrong with this combo.

0756405890|5.0|Every now and then a book comes around and there is so much good press about it, so much hype that it seems extremely unlikely that the actual book will live up to it. But every now and then, it does. \\"The Name of The Wind\\" is on such book.    This is an amazing book-a story within a story about the nature of stories with all the classical fantasy elements- a hero struck from tragedy and hard work, magic, evil beings, a nemesis for the hero, magical schooling, fairies, dragons...and more!    Kote is just an innkeeper in a small town inn. Mostly he serves drinks and dinner to four or five of the locals every night, then polishes his bottles and cleans his counters and tables and goes to bed. He's only been in town about a year.    There is nothing ordinary about Kote. His hair is as red as fire, his eyes changeable to any shade of green, a strange sword hangs above his bar and despite the terrible roads he has stocked any kind of drink you can think of.    But more than that-he has a story.     Kote wasn't always an innkeeper. Kote wasn't even always Kote. In his not so far distant youth Kote was Kvothe, son of the traveling, acting, gypsy like Edema Ruh, secure in the love of his parents and troop. Beyond normally clever Kvothe was a member of the University Arcanum. He made magic, fought dragons, courted beautiful women and made unforgettable music. He also endured unspeakable tragedy and set out on a nearly impossible quest. All sorts of legendary deeds have been attributed to Kvothe. Stories run rampant, twisting the truth, changing what Kvoth's life really was.    And now that the Chronicler, an arcanist in his own right, has come to Kote/Kvoth's inn to get the real story of the boy who knew the name of the wind. It will take three days.    This is the first.    Generally speaking I used to dislike first person (Kvoth's narrative is in first makes up about 90% of the book and the rest is in third) but this book has changed my mind completely-I think I now preferfirst. But Patrick Rothfuss is equally skilled at writing in both.     This is an absolutely amazing book. The kind that keeps you up at night, keeps you from working in the day and keeps your mind occupied for a long time after you turn the last page. It makes complete sense that this is the author's first novel because this is a story within a story that's partially about the nature of stories-and because of that it doesn't follow the formulaic fantasy guidelines we've all become so accustom too. Expect twists and turns by the dozen.     Undoubtedly there will be comparisons to Harry Potter because of the \\"magic school\\" element but the author's imagination and determination not to follow traditional fantasy hero storylines makes' this book something completely different.     When all is said and done my only complaint about this book is that it wasn't longer! I can't wait for the second book!    Five stars and more...
B001EN71DG|5.0|This was an excellent buy. Loved the DVD quality and Star Wars is just... Star Wars. I'm tired of the griping about the original versions vs. the 'CG' revised versions. Personally, I like the tidied up newer versions myself. Yes, there's charm in a Model T, but there's also charm in newer models. Listening to fans who like the original version better, Lucasfilm put out this version with old and new together- have to buy two copies? No! Included for free, a whole different version of the movie. And yet then the whining begins- it's not the right version of the original (?!), it's not widescreen, whine, whine.    Just buy it. It's excellent.

B000A2H2TK|1.0|Well I pretty much agree that this is an underrated album by one of the better prog rock bands ever, what I want to discuss here is the sound quality of this so-called remaster. What was the remastering done on a Commadore 64? I have been dubbing alot of my vinyl onto cd when I pulled out my very used \\"The Missing Piece\\", and noticed a few scratches so I went to Amazon and bought the \\"remastered\\" edition. I have never been so disappointed with a cd until now. The highs are harsh and the bass response is almost none existent. DRT Entertainment should be ashamed of themselves to put out a \\"remastered\\" cd of this poor quality.
B00009UTQD|5.0|I own five filters, this case holds five filters.  It is not just the number of slots that is important, it is how they are stored in the case that is what needs mentioning.  Filter \\"wallets\\" allow the transfer of their materials such as mesh or plastic onto the expensive coatings of your expensive filters.  This pouch has individual padded pockets like those found in a quality camera bag.  Filter glass never touches anything damaging.<br /><br />Build quality of this pouch is great...it will last for many years. It is constructed of sturdy cordura with a secure velcro strap on front.  The rear has velcro mounting straps for many popular camera bag/case systems as well as your belt.
B001TKA4IS|5.0|We have all heard the adage that, if you work hard enough, you can become anything you want to be. Rath challenges this. We all have different strengths, and very seldom is someone very successful in something that is not his/her strength. Don't follow the path of greatest resistance!<br /><br />Rath criticizes the widespread societal practice on dwelling on failure instead of success. For instance, there is excessive attention paid to poor grades in school instead of to the good ones. He also believes that talents are innate, and change little through life. He even cites a study (p. 18) that indicates that the child's personality traits at age 3 are very similar to those at age 26.<br /><br />After extensive research, the Gallup Organization developed a list consisting of 34 common talents, each of which is described in this book in a separate chapter. I will briefly describe a few of them. A person with the Analytical talent is good at picking apart ideas, projects, etc., not to destroy them but to make them work better. He/she would do well in marketing, database management, or medical research. A person with the Intellection talent likes mental activity. He or she would do well in studies of philosophy, literature, or psychology. The Learner constantly wants to learn something. He/she might learn best by teaching.<br /><br />Evidently, this book has hit the chord. It has been a bestseller for many years, has been translated into several languages, and has been used by businesses, schools, community groups, etc.
1881273156|4.0|Gary Chapman does a great job of helping me to understand there are different ways in which we love and the definitions or each and how to identify them. He draws from his many years of relationship counseling experiences and uses real stories to relate. It's an easy read and covers the basics in a way that is clear and will allow you to delve deeper into other aspects of relationships and love with a sound foundation to start from. Great book and highly recommended.
B000006TRV|5.0|No question about it, this album is better then their previous classic THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.  This album is like a greatest hits album!  This album features \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" \\"Hey you,\\" Another Brick in the Wall,\\" \\"Nobody Home,\\" \\"Don't Leave Me Now,\\" \\"Mother,\\" \\"The Trial,\\" \\"Run Like Hell,\\" etc...  When I listened to the album, THE WALL, I thought this album was nothing compared to other Pink floyd albums, but after a few days it grew on me.  I love the whole album and I've listened to the album...what a hundred times.  I just started listening to Pink floyd, by the way.      I rate this ***** out of *****
0440244870|4.0|Although Becky is a completely neurotic ditzy character, she's actually quite charming and good at math.  In fact, she annoyed me at first but grew on me midway.  I started really liking her.  She reminds me of a modern young Lucy from \\"I Love Lucy\\".  Every situation and thought process is a perfect recipe for disaster and quite hilarious.  I found myself chuckling and giggling out loud in public several times, just couldn't help it.  Sophie Kinsella has a knack for writing sitcom.  Although this book is ficiton, I found it to be a little bit of a self-help book.  I think many people can relate to Becky's addiction in minor and major ways.  I did, and glad to see that she pulled out of her situation by becoming self-made.  Cute, witty, and fun to read...I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series about Ms. Bloomwood.
B00005N6KG|5.0|The sound quality is fine.  I've not noticed any difference between these and the expensive HiFI ones I paid way too much to buy.    These are light.  The let your ears breathe so in the summer you'll not have to drain sweat.  I can pull a stocking cap over them in winter, no problem.      I view them as disposable.  Inevitably, the wire snags on something, and after a few snags, one channel stops working.  Still, they last months and months, and I think they're well worth the $.
0307269752|5.0|Great book.  Character development and story lines were captivating.  Read it in a week.  Loved the twists and turns.  Was surprised by the ending... there is a part that is just so relevant to what is happening today in the US market. I was saddened to learn the author passed away.  Wonderfully written.
B0007DFJ0G|2.0|Okay, Brad Pitt did a good job.  I liked the part where the \\"army\\" members start chanting, \\"His name is Paulson,\\" after it sinks in the guy is dead.  And it was funny when the army guys tried to pick fights with strangers, and it was really hard to get \\"normal\\" people to fight.<br /><br />A silly, childishly \\"romantic\\" totally unbelievable riff on a Walter Mitty character gone mad.  Conrad's Secret Sharer on steroids.<br /><br />Are we to believe that the Norton character won't spend the rest of his stupid life in jail?  Why didn't he shout out when the cops were going to castrate him - that would have ended the entire jig?  Why did all those losers do whatever he told them to do?<br /><br />Is this supposed to be a meditation on the motivation of the herd?  The truth about why young men join gangs and death squads?  A \\"serious\\" critique of our consumerist, alienated, mass society?  And what an ironic, \\"happy\\" ending, watching buildings blow up and holding hands with the one you love...<br /><br />Gimmee a break!  A comic book movie suitable for twelve year olds.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This dvd is fabulous! Joss pulls off an amazingly creative job (done during the last big writer's strike) With a great cast, you will literally be laughing your socks off at points. But it's also full of drama and sadness and lessons about how sometimes plans go awry and bad things happen that you didn't intend.<br />And even if you don't usually like \\"musicals\\" you will probably like this one.<br />The extra features are also great. The commentaries are funny and the disk is well worth purchase just for the 2 commentary tracks.<br />There has been rumors about some sort of sequel or major theatrical type deal along these lines.. either way, Joss, you've got our money!
B001TOD92C|5.0|\\"The Wrestler\\" is one of the greatest American films made in recent years.  The movie might come across as only enjoyed by a niche audience, but the movie is so much more than that.<br /><br />The film tells a fantastic story of a man who \\"loves a sport that doesn't love him back.\\"  Clearly, the man had neglected his life and loves outside of his work during his glory days, and now wishes he had not neglected the ones that needed him most.<br /><br />The film is layered on top of that, with all sorts of comparisons to modern America, the sacrifices and humiliations people go through to support themselves and their families, the end of the American family unit, and even how people fuel the self-destructive tendencies of their fellow man.<br /><br />Whether you are a fan of professional wrestling or not, I highly recommend this movie.

B001GKYBXA|4.0|The Fireman is hard at work again. Paul McCartney is still in the midst of a decade-long renaissance period.

This album is no exception and finds him surprising us with the caliber of his work. What an inspiring album!
1416549447|5.0|I learned about chi running about a year ago and feel it has really helped my running, from the point that a 10k was my max (and a somewhat stressful one at that) to where I can easily do a half marathon and am now aiming for full marathons.  The basic idea really is that you avoid a striding form and  relax most of your body except your core so that you move forward largely by leaning into your run and coming down on your mid-foot while falling forward.  This description doesn't do the technique justice, but this type of running really is designed to be both efficient and low-impact.  It works well for my 50-year old body (I used it to complete the Boston Marathon as a \\"non-qualified\\" runner raising funds for a Boston charity) and allows me to get through races feeling tired but  not overlyl stressed or pained.  I know some fast (2:30 marathoners) who say chi running has allowed them to maintain a fast pace without feeling beat up for days afterward.<br /><br />The first edition of this book laid out chi running in a pretty straightforward way, while the second edition adds about 50-60 pages.  A good part of the earlier edition has been repeated, but the second edition has, I feel, really expanded on the first edition by offering more information and advice on the \\"how to\\" of chi running.  There is a nice new central section appropriately called \\"How to Learn Chi Running\\"  that takes you through a set of step-by-step lessons that are easy to follow and making it very clear what the components of techniques are and more important to integrate them.  Reading this edition along side the first edition, I found that this one is easier to follow and leaves less uncertainty in how to run.<br /><br />The tone of the book remains informal and conversational, and it generally provides a complete guide to topics related to running, including training, injury prevention (a real plus of chi running is that it easier on the body than traditional running form), and nutrition.<br /><br />Chi running may not be for everyone but I feel it is worth checking out - I suspect even if you don't adopt the whole technique, parts of it may help your running.  For example, the book suggests shin splits are caused by running with the feet splayed outward.  As my introduction  to chi running,  I tried running with my feet parallel as suggested in the book and ran a 10K without trouble when previously even running a mile left my shins sore.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and feel this edition adds to what was presented in the first edition.<br /><br />Enjoy!g may not be for everyone but I feel it is worth checking out - I suspect even if you don't adopt the whole technique, parts of it may help your running.

B001GCUO1G|3.0|\\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" was a disappointing film for several reasons, mostly because it broke the cardinal rule of superhero films: have a villain that's just as interesting as the hero. Sabertooth was never shown to be the truly evil monster that he is (there was a surprising lack of violence in this film). Wolverine himself is never shown being a true bad@$$ either--Logan had more exciting action scenes in \\"X2\\" than he did in his own movie! Also the third act of the film is fairly anticlimactic and rather than the ultimate Wolverine vs. Sabertooth battle fans have been waiting for, we get Victor & Jimmy battling a totally new character, which while this guy has some cool powers the battle with him lacks any emotional weight at all.    The film was not without its highlights though. The all too brief encounter with Gambit was (aside from some ridiculous wire-fu moments) perfect. The origin of the \\"Blob's\\" name was a surprisingly good scene, Sabertooth vs. Wraith and Wade/Deadpool vs. a room full of bad guys with guns was also pretty spectacular. Fans of the comics and X-films also get a few more cool little moments sprinkled out through the film that I won't spoil here.     The bottom line is this film definitely has flashes of brilliance that are too short and too brief to keep \\"Wolverine\\" from being the weakest and most disappointing addition yet to the X-Men film franchise.
0345472322|4.0|This book is plain common sense.  There isn't anybody who wouldn't benefit from taking the advice contained in the book and putting it to use.  In a nutshell:  If at first you don't succeed, it isn't because you're a loser, it's because you need to just take a breath, try different approaches and maintain a positive attitude.  The author describes numerous experiments which show that if you believe tests and challenges to be instantaneous judges of your character and ability, it will actually make you less smart and less successful in meeting those challenges. This book is a cut above most self-help books, because it is written by a psychologist who backs up her assertions with sound experimental data.      The key distinction is between:  \\"growth mindset\\" (= the mindset whereby a person believes that if they try/concentrate/practice/etc., things will get better); and  \\"fixed mindset\\" (= the mindset whereby a person believes that you either can or you can't and that every challenge exposes your ability or lack thereof.)  Good stuff - however, the book is at least 50% too long.  You cotton on to the message pretty quickly, and  a lot of the book is just padding.

B0007DFJ0G|5.0|Let me start off by saying that this is one of my favorite all-time movies (and books), so yes, my opinion might be biased.    After watching the movie and finding that it was indeed based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk, I (who hardly ever reads) picked the book and read it, and loved every word in it.     Of course, there are many differences between the book and movie, and the 2 hr  movie cannot capture completely  every little detail in the book. Still, I'd say they have done a very, very good job. Some dialogs are directly from the novel, verbatim. And most descriptions in the book truly come alive in the movie.    Brad, Ed and Helena have all done a very terrific job at their roles, and I must commend the casting director - I don't think any other Hollywood actors would have fit these respective roles better.    If you haven't seen the movie ever, go get it and watch it. If you are even slightly into reading, get the book too.  [[ASIN:0393327345 Fight Club: A Novel]]    RAj

B0000029GA|5.0|If you simply MUST own one hip-hop album, make this it. Every song is flawless. As much is said about Nas' lyricism, it truly is the production that makes the album sound timeless. It's an early example of a hot rapper enticing the greatest producers in hip-hop to work with him. Just like Biggie's \\"Life After Death\\" or (to a lesser extent) The Game's \\"Documentary\\". Every song is sick:    1) The Genesis (Intro). Uses samples to tell the story of Nas' initiation into the hip-hop scene with reference to the people and place that's helped him shine. 5/5    2) New York State of Mind. With that thunderous urban Primo beat and that first line (\\"Straight out the dungeons of rap!\\") you hear the streets callin' out: \\"wake the f*%k up!, NYC is back\\". 5/5    3) Life's a Bitch. For the only unknown boardsman on the CD, L.E.S.' work on this track is wonderfully understated. Minimal samples are used, yet in this joint we get the album's only guest rapper AZ, and he kills it. And the cornet solo by Olu Dara (Nas' father) gives the song a deeper level, one that drifts into a melancholy mood so vivrant and expressive. 5/5    4) The World Is Yours. \\"Illmatic\\" is so perfect its like a chicken and egg story. What possibly came first, the beats or the flow? The 20-year-old rapper's words hop around Pete Rock's intricately layered beat and we see glimpses of a developing dual persona: a hungry MC wanting to be a big cash-strapped star but without compromising his storytelling intelligence.  5/5    5) Halftime. And so here we get Large Pro. The guy that made Nas a star in the first place. Ending \\"Illmatic's\\" second quarter. And it sounds street. The baseline bounces like a courtrock, and the verses (recorded in 1992) are like the lyrical game winning shot at a block freestyle jam.  \\"Word to Marcus Garvey, a heart that sparked it\\". 5/5    6) Memory Lane. My favorite song on the album. Lines like \\"sentence begins indented, with formality, my duration is infinite, money wise or pysiology, poetry its a part of me, retardedly bop, I ancient manifested hip-hop, straight off the block\\" are the reason Nas got all the Rakim comparisons. And Primo matches him by rising to the occasion and puts in perhaps the best track he's ever made throughout his highly prolific career. As inviting as the \\"NY State of Mind\\" beat is imposing. 5/5    7) One Love. It's detailed, vivid, empathetic storytelling at its finest. Its like Nas reading from a very real personal letter (\\"Sometimes I sit back with a budda sack mind in a different world thinkin how can we exist through the facts\\"), a similar effect to Eminem's \\"Stan\\" (something tells me Biggie probably liked this one). Aided by Q-Tip's sprightly yet contemplative beat. 5/5    8) One More Time For Your Mind. I think this outstanding song is the weakest beat and the weakest track on the album. For a Large Professor production it feels pretty frickin' slight (for such a sample heavy guy who's supposively an influence on people like Timbaland). Luckily Nas is on point, and the verse makes it a: 4/5.    9) Represent. The Queensbridge shout-out track. It has a very loose block party feel, and I'd say its the liveliest song on the album. Of course Primo gives it an 'only in NYC' Gangstarr vibe ....5/5    10) It Ain't Hard To Tell. Nas' intelligent braggado skips like a pebble around Extra P's track which builds on sample-after-sample then pokes out and massages the words. This is a sick beat that was probably crafted with state of the art studio technology at the time. Done by some wizards, it sounds timeless. 5/5
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Pink's latest release of Funhouse is probably her most real,intimate offering yet, with a healthy mix of angst, revenge, sadness and bittersweet regret. It's not hard to understand what influenced her lyrics for this collective work, dealing with the painful separation and ending of her 2 yr. marriage to Carey Hart. I can say with much celebration, however, that they are back together these days and working at making their relationship work. I for one am ecstatic and hope they can really make a go of it this time because they obviously really love eachother. Personal faves on this album, tho pretty hard to limit as the whole album is EXCELLENT, would be Crystal Ball, Glitter In The Air, I Don't Believe You, Sober, So What and Bad Influence.. Some releases have some b-sides which are equally good - Boring, This Is How It Goes Down, and many more. Keep rockin' Pink. We love you!
1582880956|5.0|How do you summarize a book like Watership Down without diminishing its power? It's about rabbits who are basically real rabbits; they eat grass and live in burrows and hold very simple views about the ways of life and society. But then again, these rabbits can talk to each other, and they have legends and poets and seers. And they have a deep-rooted understanding of their own place in the vast scheme of things. As their creator told their first ancestor, El-ahrairah, in one of their legends, \\"all the world will be you enemy, Prince of a Thousand Enemies, and where they catch you, they will kill you. But first they will have to catch you. . . Be cunning and full of tricks, and your people will never be destroyed.\\" Death, in a myriad of forms, is always just around the corner for these rabbits, and it is no joking matter for them, or for the reader who is drawn into their world. But Richard Adams' rich characters journey on and fight their way through all perils, their eyes firmly fixed on their dream--a warren in \\"high, lonely hills, where the wind and the sound carry, and the ground's as dry as straw in a barn.\\" NOTE: throughout the book, the author occasionally drops a word or two of his rabbit language with a translation in a footnote. I advise any new readers to try to remember these tidbits. There comes a climactic moment towards the end of the book when a whole (rather satisfying) sentence in lapine goes entirely untranslated.
1416594884|2.0|Most Wanted Man is my 3rd Le Carre novel, and it followed a familiar pattern with my previous reads.  I should say, my struggle to finish the book was familiar.  Ironically, I love his writing style.  In each novel, though, I simply had to drag myself through the pages.  I don't need to summarize the story - that's been done enough on these pages - but I will say that unlike my previous two selections, MWM was all over the place - it suffered a distinct lack of focus...  and it was boring.    Le Carre was at the height of his literary power when writing about what he knew firsthand - cold war Realpolitik.  I have to assume that he's out of his element writing about the \\"War on Terror\\".  Or, perhaps his confused portrayal of intelligence agencies as much at war with each other as with an enemy they don't understand - that doesn't play by established Cold War rules; afraid to get it wrong, so just rounding everybody up in the same dragnet regardless of guilt or innocence - is more telling than I credit.    Either way, as a novel it wasn't gripping, it wasn't terribly interesting...  it was hard to keep my eyes open.  I think I'm done with Le Carre.
0060527986|5.0|This book reflects a point that everyone could be a warrior. No one is born to be a warrior. There is no particular way to be warrior. But there are three elements we need to carry on the way to become a warrior. They are hope, faith and love.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|The Reader is a tragedy that draws enough hope and profundity to make it transcend depression. It is a story about the nature of good intentions and how these are warped by the chaotic cold world they manifest in. I'd rather you not read this review if you haven't seen the movie: it's a romance with interesting people and a tragic plot that I loved, despite being an average twenty year old guy with a streak of hating period pieces, romances, and reflective movies alike. This was the first time I've seen this particular movie, while most of the rest in its genre have been recycled since the 20s and 30s. If that sounds good to you, go see it and don't spoil it with this self indulgent review. Otherwise, go ahead.    The film begins when a young man and an older woman meet and create an affair that veritably reeks of springtime, birds, and new love.  The relationship is perfect in its balance: Michael draws wonder and awe from his experienced Hannah, who in turn gains strength and purpose from his invigorating youth. Matthias Habich is excellent as a boy who is honest and quietly brave and magnanimous. Kate Winslet is transcendent as a dutiful and simple goddess for her lover. I related to Michael easily. I wasn't as intuiting and graceful as a fifteen year old, and he allowed me a window to see how it could have been. During the first hour I relived a year as it could have been in late 50s West Germany with a mysterious, gorgeous creature to come home to. It was beautiful.     The tragedy begins when Michael begins to outgrow his Hannah but misses opportunities when his more stunning and socially appropriate classmate Sophia unsuccessfully tries to engage him. Now out of a familiarity and attachment to Hannah he returns again and again to her apartment, reading to her and making love, forming his identity with her as a part. When Hannah leaves unexpectedly, Michael is left with a gap in experience and comfort in relationships with women his age that he never truly fills; when he goes to college, he turns down the invitations of a beautiful coed so that he can study. Even while maintaining outward self confidence, he has lost a building block of his personage.    The second hour reveals the true craggy ice block beneath the iceberg of beauty and connection that was visible above the surface in the previous romance. Michael takes a law seminar that leads him to a Nazi trial where Hannah has been charged with war crimes, as it is revealed that she had once been an SS guard. As Michael is torn apart by this revelation, the film contemplates morality and guilt with a light sweep that is heavy enough to create poignancy but not indulgent enough to be cliché. It ends with a redemption of Hannah as she teaches herself to read, which is a great ending: nothing is really solved, but the characters have all made it through an impossibly difficult situation and are now catching their breath on the other side.    The Reader has an amazing classical score, terrific acting, and a truly significant plot. If that doesn't reel you in, go jump off a church.
B001GKJ2E8|2.0|I remember being hesitant to even watch this movie in the first place and I should have gone with my first impression. I tried to like the movie while I was watching it I really did but it just didn't seem to stick. The only reason I really even did watch it was because Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman were in it they are a couple of my favorite actors but this movie seemed like a train wreck until the very end it just got more and more pointless and dumb. The graphics were good however when they came out with a video game I thought that was a good way to go but to sit there and watch the movie was like torture I was with someone who actually liked it so I had to watch it from start to finish. If you think you might not like the movie don't bother to pick it up you won't be disappointed.
B00005JPO1|1.0|I really really wanted to like this movie, but it is a travesty on many levels. The whole thing seems like a retread, and the script is filled with cliches and nonsense (yes, I do think I could have done a better job).    This film a horrible thing to do a character loved by so many. At least since it's a sequel (unlike the Star Wars prequels), it's not too hard to pretend that it just never happened. As far as I'm concerned, there are only three Indiana Jones movies, which I love dearly (yes, even Temple of Doom, even though it's not nearly as good). Please don't subject yourself or your kids to this, and don't reward anyone associated with this garbage with your hard-earned money.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|This is a wonderful little fairy tale about a boy who lives in the slums of Bombay and makes it to the top via Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

This is a type of Rocky where a slum boy makes good.

0345337581|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this, but thought I'd give it a try anyway.  I'm completely blown away by how much it helps your memory.  The simple tricks the authors show make a world of difference.  The book begins with showing you how to remember sequential words (basically never ending amount) and continues to show you how to remember those words in order and allow you to pick out, say, the thirteenth word with no trouble.  Later it describes how to memorize long numbers. It begins to end when it speaks of card counting, which didn't interest me much at all, but would be good for someone who likes to play cards.
B001675SOY|3.0|First off, the guitar work is stellar, the drums are heavy and occassionally you hear some great bass work, but the vocals, god, they ended up driving me up a wall!  It reminded me of a chained up pit bull. And that wouldn't be so bad, except nearly every song is like that!      It is good symphonic power metal, no doubt; like Dragonforce with a metalcore singer, but the vocals get annoying fast, I wish they would drop the vocals and be instrumental.  Did I mention the vocals get annoying fast?

B0013FBS20|1.0|Can you write an honest review of a movie without comparing it to the book it's based on? I think the answer is \\"Yes\\".  When major film companies create big-budget movies with highly-paid A-list stars, they deserve, even demand, to be compared to the book they were based on.  And this movie, to put it mildly, is a hugely disappointing adaptation.  They went not for a true-to-the-book ending, but a typical feel-good Hollywood conclusion, with none of the author's emotionally shocking impact.  The movie makers of this joke of a film completely missed the point of the climax and conclusion: it's the book's ending that gives the reason for the awesome title.  It's the book's ending that shocks us with it's unexpected closing sequence.  And it's treatment of the female vampire Neville befriends, turning her into a human with possibly romantic undertones, undercuts and undoes the poignancy of their meeting.    This is a movie made with just the most cynical attempt to make a lot of money.  Which it did.
0691131511|1.0|This is not a history book, surely not for laypersons. This is at best a compilation of lecture notes. Other than referring to the beginning and to the end of the Empire at the beginning and at the end of the book, Herrin follows no chronological order in the presentation of her topics, and apparently assumes that the readers are familiar with the chronology of the Byzantine Empire and its (complex) list of monarchs. Well, I doubt many readers are. Therefore, treating in each chapter a new millennium-spanning subject, skipping from a 6th century emperor to another emperor hundreds of years in the future and back, introduces havoc and confusion and does not enable any smooth reading of this book. Comments like \\"discussed in chapter 17\\" or \\"I will discuss this in chapter 12\\", which appear frequently throughout the book, underscore this dry lecture-like nature of the book. Herrin can learn an important lesson concerning history writing for the general public from another book that deals with a closely related topic: Lord Kinross' \\"The Ottoman Centuries\\" - a masterpiece in history writing. Kinross guides the reader through the lives and times of the Ottomans, touching on many aspects of that empire, without departing from the chronological order of things.   I also found Herrin's treatment of the Empire disturbingly biased so as to serve her theory that the Byzantine Empire was in fact a vital and flourishing state throughout its long history rather than the decrepit and degenerate body western historians of the last 500 years considered it to be, surely as of the 10th century. Her attempt to argue with all those who belittle the cultural and historical importance of the Empire, from Pope Benedict XVI and back, describing the political instability and cultural stagnation (i.e. learning but with little innovation) in one sentence then explaining in the following sentence why these were actually signs of strength and vitality (as the empire slowly lost more and more of its territories...), is nothing but weak.   Given the choice between Herrin's \\"Byzantium\\" and the Britannica's entry on the same topic, do yourselves a favour - read the Britannica.

Strong acting and a multi-layered plot lend itself to this thinking man's science-fiction piece that is not composed of aliens and spaceships.  Give it a try.  It will certainly be a film you will want to view more than once.

But don't archive it in despair after one listening. This quirky collection really does grow on you. Have a listen to the disturbingly bizarre 'In Every Dream Home a Heartache' a few times first - if that doesn't pull you in then I'll stop drinking shiraz. Then give 'For Your Pleasure' a few turns. Once you've got your ears around those, the rest will follow. Great album.

2707306959|5.0|The novel, L'Amant, by Marguerite Duras written in the 50's was translated into English. The Lover, and became the basis for the movie The Lover starring Tony Leung.  A great movie which stimulated me to read the book in English which then stimulated me to read the original.  The English version is a literal translation of the French and possesses the flow and passion of the original.  The movie is one of the best renditions of a book I have seen.  In Netflix, the movie gets mixed reviews ranging from brilliant to those who get emotionally upset by the theme of the movie, which is an older (32 year old) Chinese man who has an affair with a very mature 15 year old French girl in Vietnam.  But who is seducing or using who?  Beautifully written (the books) and directed (movie).

B001GCUO1G|4.0|There is a certain kind of potential viewer for this movie that simply shouldn't: the comic book or fantasy fundamentalist. The most extreme example are those silly people who wouldn't see LORD OF THE RINGS because of the removal of Tom Bombadil or WATCHMEN because there was no squid (though in the case of the latter the fact that it was one of the least cinema films ever made is more to the point). WOLVERINE or as it is officially known X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE engages in a great deal of revisionism. Comic fans (of which I count myself) need to chill out. We've seen so many revisions of various comic characters and there are so many incompatibilities between various incarnations that if they do the same thing in the movies, how can we sanely complain? We can have debates about whether the changes are any good, but that things have changed from various versions in the comics is absolutely not a legitimate criticism. WATCHMEN proved that for all time. No film has been so slavishly faithful to a source before, and no film has ever suffered so much as a result.<br /><br />Frankly, this isn't a bad movie. Neither is it a great one. I can name a long string of superhero movies that are better. Heck, I can name four in 2008 that were infinitely better: IRON MAN, HELL BOY II, HULK, and THE DARK KNIGHT (and I rank them in that order), and we are likely to see better Marvel Studios films in the future. But that doesn't mean that this is bad. Did I like every change? Nope. I was especially bothered by the apparent nerfing of Emma Frost, seemingly eliminating her very powerful psychic powers and emphasizing exclusively her secondary mutation of turning into diamond (which is interesting primarily because when she is in that form she loses her emotions and abilities, hence her sometimes nickname The Ice Queen). But overwhelmingly, Emma Frost is psychic, and that is rather too large of a thing in my opinion to leave out. (Though I did find it interesting that in multiple shots they paired Emma Frost and Scott Sommers. Foreshadowing? In the most recent reimaginings of the X-Men Emma and Scott have enjoyed an extremely complex relationship before Jean Grey's death; after her death they are a full-fledged couple.) But I found the creation of a much, much deeper background between Logan and his traditional nemesis Sabertooth to be a lot of fun and fairly compelling.<br /><br />Another group of comic book fundamentalists are going to be upset because the timeline doesn't work, especially with the timeline of the three X-Men movies. But I agree with Emerson that a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. And of course there is the complication that we had a completely different Sabertooth in the first X-Men film. But none of this really bothers me. Liev Schreiber is just outstanding as Victor/Sabertooth. He has for many years been one of the least utilized great actors in Hollywood and hopefully after this he will be in more high profile films.<br /><br />The one person I was most interested in seeing in this was Taylor Kitsch, who plays Gambit. A lot of newspapers and magazines and critics, whenever lists are make of \\"upcoming stars,\\" Kitsch persistently makes an appearance. He has been one of the most exciting young actors on television as Tim Riggins on FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, where he not only has displayed lots of acting ability, but has put on display physical charms that make three of my closest female friends declare that he is the most attractive male in the world. But for those who are not watchers of FNL, this could be their introduction to Kitsch. And I have to say that he manages to put on display as Gambit a lot of the same charm that he flashes on FNL. That is one consistent element in Gambit in all of his X-Men appearances, a roguish charm. and Taylor Kitsch has that in spades (no pun intended, given Gambit's skill at cards). It has been interesting seeing how they handle various X-Men in the movies. Some are almost impossibly nerfed, most horribly Rogue, who went from being one of the most dominant X-Men to being one of the lamest, with them stripping her of just about all of her powers. I mentioned above Emma Frost having her greater powers removed. But the strange thing with Gambit is that he is made, if anything, more powerful than usual. My greatest disappointment was, however, with one of the most powerful of all the Marvel Universe entities, Weapon XI, Deadpool. As presented he was simply not very interesting.<br /><br />All in all, however, I found this pretty entertaining. It won't go down as one of the greatest superhero movies. I did enjoy it as much as the three X-Men movies. I think in all four Hugh Jackman has been excellent as Wolverine. The really odd thing about that is that he is utterly wrong for the role. He pulls the hair and facial expressions off, but like Peter O'Toole in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (where the 6'3 O'Toole played the 5'3 T. E. Lawrence), he is far too tall for the role. In the official Marvel description, Logan is 5'3. He is supposed to be stocky and squat and thick, like a wolverine. Still, apart from that he has made this role his own. Unless you are a comic book fundamentalist, you should find plenty in this film to enjoy.horribly Rogue, who went from being one of the most dominant X-Men to being one of the lamest, with them stripping her of just about all of her powers.

B001IBIQU6|2.0|UPDATE: After a month, I like this record a lot more. It takes a while to get into it, but it's certainly better than \\"Exciter\\". I do think they need a bigger sound, which would help the songs a lot. I'm still not a fan of how small these songs sound.<br /><br />After trying for two weeks to get my finger on why I dislike this record so much, it's finally occurred to me: the minimalist production on SOTU is what kills it.<br /><br />Gone are the big synths, fat bass lines and anthemic chord changes of the past records - they've been replaced by restrained, pulsing bleeps that make the chord changes of the songs far less obvious. The problem here is that Dave's voice ends up being way out front, and the music behind him sounds thin. It all ends up sounding like IDM or minimal techno, which just doesn't work for Depeche Mode. Think Ulrich Schnauss with Dave Gahan as a lead vocalist. The songs just don't have enough dynamic shifts, within themselves or as an album. \\"In Sympathy\\" is one of the only tracks on SOTU I really like, but if is was bigger it would be better.<br /><br />I don't know why Depeche is so afraid to sound like themselves - they did it on \\"Precious\\" , the best song they've released since Ultra. Maybe they're incapable of sounding big anymore - maybe thats what Alan Wilder brought to the band. I think the new guys they play with are a bunch of flunkies and they probably don't push Martin Gore and company like Alan Wilder did. I keep waiting for a great DM record, but let's face it, they haven't made a solid album since Ultra, and that's 12 years ago now.  I guess I'm glad they're still around but I wish DM would stop being so afraid to sound like themselves.

B0000ADY9I|5.0|At Filmore East is one of my all time favorite albums, and this deluxe edition does justice to it.  As some have said here, there are no new unreleased tracks.  There are the original 7 tracks that appeared on the original, 2LP edition that was released back in 1971.  Trouble No More, One Way Out, and the monstrous Mountain Jam all appeared on Eat a Peach, and the others appeared on various compliations throughout the years.  But here we get to hear all the songs together, which is really cool.<br /><br />The opener Statesboro Blues, an old Blind Willie McTell song, is an awesome song, a great way to start out this fabled concert album.  The monstrous jam You Don't Love Me runs an incredible 19 minutes, and it never gets boring at all.  In Memory of Elizabeth Reed is one of the Allman's best songs ever, and there's never been another live version that has topped this one.  Whippin' Post is as great as you've heard, and one of the best things about this box set is that you get to hear the concert as it was originally one.  At the end of Post, you hear the opening strands of Mountain Jam, but it had originally faded out at the 22:58 minute mark on the original LP.  Here, there's no fade out, and Whippin' Post goes right into Mountain Jam, which is incredible to say the least.  Essentially, the Allmans jammed for one hour straight, a breathless jam with hardly a quiet moment.  Many make hay of the Dead's long jams, but I think the Allman Brothers Band are the best jam band ever, as their jams are much more dynamic and exciting than their contemporaries.  Their invention and dynamism never grows old, and you marvel at their creativity.<br /><br />One might label The Allman Brothers Band Southern Progressive Rock, though I'm not sure.  Regardless, this is a truly great album, one of the best rock albums ever, and it never grows old or tired.

006135323X|5.0|Life as it seems, is being controlled and run only by things that we can see through our naked eyes. However, in my own experience, I have discovered that its not what we see that runs the world but its the things we cannot see that do. Human Psychology is one such thing. What we think we do and What we really do are completely different things.    For people who are experienced in life, maybe have crossed the age of 40 or people who have seen a lot in their life in early ages, this book might not seem that informative or interesting. They would feel as if they already know or in someway came across these basic human psychology principles.     But for youngsters or for someone who is facing the dilemma of life and trying to guess why somethings work and why some do not, this book would provide a foundation, that would please the reader and build immense confidence.    The materials Dan has covered like Social Influence, Relativity, Arousal, Procrastination, Influence of Ownership, Cost of no cost (FREE !!!), though all basic but are essential to know before you start dealing with yourself and even with others. Some of the principles have already been addressed by other authors in different ways. For example, For Procrastination, read Parkinson's Laws, for Social Influence and Closed Doors read Robert Cialdini's Influence.    These principles wont seem new to you, you would read and your brain would be serving you with related incidents that might have happened to you or to someone else. But the classification and the organization of these basic human behavior principles matter a lot.    Dan has a very clear, simple and entertaining style of writing which makes the memorizing of the content very easy. Would also suggest you to visit YouTube or Ted to see Dan speaking. Duke University has also come out with the iPod versions of all his chapters, that help in understanding some of his Practical Experiments for this book, so do not miss them. Thanks
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|Many compare Michael Scott's The Alchemyst to Harry Potter, and that is a fair comparison. Both books contain well-developed characters, mystical environments, and a completely entrancing plotline. The book protagonist, Nicholas Flamel, must struggle with good and evil in a modern society where magic exists, but hidden, throughout the world.     Nicholas Flamel and his wife are the guardians of a magical book called the Codex -- this book holds the secrets to ever-lasting life. One can only imagine the number of people after this book. Well, it doesn't take long for the book to be stolen. After the attack, Flamel suspects something odd about the mysterious twins he just met. Are they the ones the Codex referred as the ones who will destroy the world? Or are they here to save it? The action ensues as the four are of to discover the answers to these and many other questions.    The story flows smoothly and engages the reader at every turn. There are some low points, however. The book does get tedious at times, and makes the story predictable, but overall it is a great novel for the young-at-heart.........I also would highly recommend reading \\"Ashes Divide\\" by Clarence Cage: [[ASIN:1442125136 Ashes Divide]] I just finished reading it and it was spectacular...don't miss it.

B001UREJWM|4.0|I just received the new \\"H & H\\" cd and I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was considering some of the reviews. I like it. Dio era is my favorite Sabbath with \\"Mob Rules\\" being their best album to me. I didn't really care for the 3 new songs on \\"The Dio Years\\" cd but these new songs are better and more catchy. They are not so doom ridden and plodding as some reviewers state. I think this one is better than \\"Dehumanizer\\". The songs \\"Fear\\", \\"Eating The Cannibals\\", \\"Turn Of The Screw\\", & \\"Rock N Roll Angel\\" are the ones that stayed with me after a couple of listens. Some of the riffs on this don't sound like they could have come from Iommi's 1980's period, but they do sound better than the best of his 1990's riffs. All in all, as said before, If you're a SABBATH fan, you can't go wrong. If you just want to hear some metal music the way that it should be done then give it a listen because it is still better than most bands releasing cd's today.    Also, this came with a dvd that runs 21 minutes and features an interview with all 4 members in the studio

0143039482|4.0|\\"In business and politics a man must carve and maul his way through men to get to be King of the Mountain.  Once there, he can be great and kind - but he must get there first.\\"<br /><br />The title of this book is a link to Shakespeare's Richard III - which opens with \\"Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York; and all the clouds that lowered upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried.\\"  This is (future king) Richard celebrating an upturn in his family's fortunes - basically saying that our dark days are behind us (winter) and the future is now turning bright.  It begins his accession to the throne, which he briefly attains, through murder, manipulation, and treachery.<br /><br />The Winter of Our Discontent's main character, Ethan Allen Hawley, makes a similar shift to achieve material desires.  At the start of the novel, Ethan is a moralistic, but ordinary, man.  Like his father and grandfather before him, Ethan is fair and honest in a world that has increasingly become materialistic and corrupt.  He is married with two kids, working as a clerk at a grocery store his family used to own.  He failed early at business - losing the grocery store and what was left of his family's land in the town (except his house) - which created a chip on his shoulder that everyone in town seems to want to wedge deeper.  His family harps on him about their lack of money and status in the town.  The town banker questions what Ethan is doing working as a clerk.  Ethan's boss stresses business prowess and the need to \\"look after number one.\\"  A local vender even offers a bribe and kickback to Ethan for some business, as \\"everybody's got a right to make a buck.\\"  Ethan is an outlier in the town his family essentially founded - as the old is constantly being moved out for the new, and Ethan is stuck looking into the past.<br /><br />Ethan begins to tire of being the town doormat - and like most of the town before him, begins to break down and rationalize that morality is relative.  He asks if \\"the eaters (are) more immoral than the eaten?  In the end all are eaten - all - gobbled up by the earth, even the fiercest and the most crafty.\\"  He questions what one gains by being a moral individual, when we all share the same fate.  With the help of an opportunistic amateur fortune-teller, Ethan rebuilds himself in efforts to capture the respect of and successes of those around him - like a snake \\"changing its skin, part dusty and ragged and part fresh and new.\\"  He falls in line with those around him - letting his animalistic nature control his behavior.<br /><br />He is able to make this change naturally, and he gains success and wealth outwardly but finds that he has morally depleted himself in the process.  He manipulates his childhood friend, now a drunk, into giving Ethan his (very valuable) land in exchange for enough money to drink himself to death.  He reports his boss (the grocery store owner) to the government as an illegal immigrant, so he can take back ownership of the store.  He even contemplates robbing a bank before fate intercedes.  All these actions are rationalized by Ethan, as \\"all men are moral, only their neighbors are not.\\"  These actions let him achieve the wealth and status that he feels he's been missing, but he finds it unsatisfying given what he had to give up.  Ethan realizes that even in a relative world, there are still acceptable and unacceptable moral standards for oneself.<br /><br />Ethan is finally both taken over the edge and then brought back by the future - his children.  His son, Allen, has inherited the same moral standards of those around him, having plagiarized his essay in an essay contest.  Ethan is disgusted - and at this point realizes his hypocrisy - that while he has justified immorality within himself (due to relative moralism), he finds the same behavior in others detestable.  His daughter, Ellen, saves Ethan by representing moralistic hope in the future - a light that has not gone out, and in the end, Ethan puts his own needs aside in order to provide hope for the next generation.<br /><br />A good story that underlines what Steinbeck considered the \\"moral flabbiness\\" spreading from corporate America to everyday American life during the 50s (and 60s).  Through Ethan we experience the collapsing of a moral man into the relative morals that has overtaken everyday life.  The message Steinbeck is sending is a relevant one - that no matter what relevant morals are prevalent in society, it is up to the individual not to fall into a relative moral trap, but to be guided by a constant set of absolute morals.<br /><br />The weakness of the novel is in its characters and relationships, which are lacking in my opinion.  The novel's characters, beyond Ethan, are trivial and not well developed - seeming to only be there to prove a certain point.  Part of this probably stems from the fact that most of the book is told from Ethan's point of view - but even he appears to be lacking something, specifically in his relationships.  His only connection is with his past - he has no connection with his wife or his kids - their interactions seem contrived.  The only connection he makes is at the end - through the talisman, with his daughter - but it seems like a reach given their prior lack of depth.  The relationships lacked to me - maybe this was how Steinbeck envisioned Ethan, but I thought his character (and others) could have been filled out better.<br /><br />A lot of criticism of this book also stems from comparing it to his other works (mainly Grapes of Wrath) - which I have not read, but now plan to.  I think that is a little unfair though - this book stands on its own, depicting its period with universal moral themes, and delivers its intended message.d, Ethan puts his own needs aside in order to provide hope for the next generation.

B001TCAT9U|5.0|Depeche Mode is terug, kocht op eBay alles wat op een synthesizer leek, probeerde de apparaten uit en creëerden in combinatie met modernere technieken hun come-back Sounds of the Universe. Martin Gore, Andy Fletcher en Dave Gahan zijn echte geluidstovenaars zonder in een freaky, onnavolgbare hoek terecht te komen. Hun 12e studioalbum is met vreugde gemaakt en belicht volgens het trio bij tijd en wijle een meer spirituele inslag (Peace, Little Soul, In Sympathy, Perfect).

B001GCUO1G|3.0|Of the comic book characters I'm familiar with, which really isn't that many, I can't think of anyone I'd like to be less than Wolverine. What a depressing character, a man well over 100 years old who at one point or another loses everything he holds dear. He has no real home, no real friends, and no real family (with one exception, but we'll get into that later). Worse yet, he's a mutant, with retractable blades that emerge from his knuckles and the ability to regenerate damaged skin. Because of this, he's relentlessly pursued by the government, who, naturally, want to capture him and perform all sorts of nasty experiments. They succeed in one regard; he's injected with a special metal from outer space that makes his bones unbreakable. So not only is an outsider, he's also forced to live with being at outsider seemingly for all time. Compared to Wolverine, being Bruce Wayne is downright fun, especially with all that money at his disposal.    As the title suggests, \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" takes place before the events of the first three \\"X-Men\\" films and documents the history of the title character. It does a decent job explaining how he became so indestructible and why he's so miserable, but it fails to explain how he (or anyone else, for that matter) was born a mutant in the first place. Nor does it explain how he stopped aging or when it might have happened. Honestly, I had no idea Wolverine was such an old man. He discovered he was a mutant in 1845 when he was only a boy named James Logan, an event that coincided with the untimely death of his father. It also marked the start of a rivalry between him and his half-brother, Victor, who has fangs and claws and can run on all fours. As the years pass, we see them grow into primal warriors who were a part of many major wars, including the Civil War, both World Wars, and Vietnam. It's during the latter war that the story proper begins.    After surviving a firing squad, Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Victor (Liev Schreiber) are approached by William Stryker (Danny Huston) and offered a chance to be part of a mutant military squad. The other members of the group: John Wraith/Kestrel (will.i.am), who can transport himself from one place to another in the blink of an eye; Chris Bradley/Bolt (Dominic Monaghan), who can manipulate electrically operated objects with his mind; Fred Dukes (Kevin Durand), who will eventually gain a lot of weight and become The Blob; David North/Agent Zero (Daniel Henney), who's lethal with a gun in each hand; and Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), a martial arts expert who can't seem to shut up, especially when it begins annoying everyone else. There comes a point where Logan has had enough of Stryker and decides to turn his back on the squad. This doesn't please Victor, who feels that brothers should stick together no matter what.    Six years later, Logan's quiet life as a lumberjack is brutally interrupted when he learns that the squad members are being murdered one by one. This reunites him with Victor, who now goes by the name Sabretooth and is hell bent on punishing Logan. After a series of unpleasant encounters and unfortunate losses, Logan turns to Stryker, who takes him to a secret laboratory and oversees a complete molecular refit of his body. This includes a new set of stainless steel knives to replace the bony protrusions he was born with. It also includes a name change from Logan to Wolverine. Basically, he has unleashed the animal that was always lurking somewhere within, abandoning any notion of restraint and compassion.    And that's pretty much where the story becomes a prolonged seek-and-destroy mission, which can only go so far before it stops being entertaining. You'd think that characters like Remy LeBeau/Gambit (Taylor Kitsch) or Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins) would help enliven the film, but they don't. They are important characters, yet they aren't given the chance to contribute much to the story.    To be fair, this movie will give action lovers and comic book fans everything they've been expecting. Just wait until the unveiling of Weapon XI, a strange looking mutant with a number of impressive superpowers. There's also a fun shot of Wolverine flying over a helicopter in slow motion, which happens just after being ejected from a fast-moving motorcycle.    But spectacle comes easy in a film based on a comic book. What I really wanted was a more substantive story, something that could make the Wolverine character seem like more than an angry, brooding victim. I also would have appreciated a bit more insight as to how and why specific things came to be, mutants most of all. Regardless, I'm sure \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" will be a great financial success, appealing to those who want nothing more from their superhero movies than cool stunts and eye-popping visual effects. There's also a fair amount of humor, which is good because it saves the film from becoming an action-packed melodrama. Much of the audience's laughter was reserved for a brief boxing match between Wolverine and The Blob, whose proportions make him look more like a living beach ball. I didn't laugh quite as hard as everyone else, but in my defense, I was still thinking about all the bad things that happened earlier in the story.

B001JG8AU6|5.0|I've read several of Sedaris's \\"works\\" ( can they really be called \\"works\\"??  They seem more like play...) and got this latest book on CD for a trip overseas.  Imagine the looks of my fellow passengers as I laughed out loud and they didn't know why!!<br /><br />I especially love the stories from his childhood.  He writes of his parents going away for a week and hiring \\"MRS. PEACOCK\\" to watch the Sedaris children while they're gone. The minute his parents leave, Mrs. Peacock heads for their bed and lays down and demands the Sedaris children scratch her back - very funny stuff.  He has a way of describing people so you can actually visualize them.<br /><br />Even funnier is the story of \\"HELEN\\" - the neighbor he had in New York ( I think ).  Helen was a combination of Archie Bunker, Robert De Niro and Roseanne.  Sedaris does a wonderful job painting the picture of the world in which he, Hugh and Helen live.<br /><br />If you hate laughing - then avoid his books like the plague!!
B000FC12C8|5.0|This book is difficult to read without a working knowledge of investment however the advice is solid for new investors and remains a valid reminder for more experienced investors as well.  Grahm's work is really the foundation of modern investment schools of thought.<br /><br />His approach is a simple one of picking solid companies that will not vanish in the next few years automating the investment portfolio to remove the greatest weakness in any investment plan: your own emotions.<br /><br />Central to his system is the fact that it is very to match the market but hard to consistantly beat it.  Indeed he argues that simply putting additional effort into trying to beat the market is often the best way to lose money in the long term.  Instead he supports steady, safe investment in what the investor can rely on to be solid investments over the years, especially in undervalued companies and solid bonds, in order to avoid losses which would be impossible to recover from.  Rather than running arace that isimpossible for you to win it is better to focus on your own long term goals and refuse to compare your results against that of others.  Doing so makes you more willing to tak edangerous risks that ca destroy the valu eof your investments and so long as you reach your goals who cares how well someone else did?
B0018O4YT0|3.0|I bought this before watching it... it's a Jennifer Connelly thing. I would run away with her in a heartbeat.... but this is not one of her best movies. So I would would suggest renting it first. If you love it then buy it.
055358894X|5.0|Great book, up there with RR Martin and Erickson.    Pros - a great story line, intricate plot, keeps you guessing, good action.    Cons - story line is always jumping back and forth between past and present which gets a little old, side characters could have been given a little more depth.  Language is a little much for younger readers.    I think Lynch would have done well to expand his vision for the story of this book and could have stretched it into a short series all by itself.  Unfortunately not, but still a great read.

B001K3JF7K|3.0|Diana Krall is an amazing singer and pianist.  She always blows me away and her skills on this are no exception.  BUT, I was disappointed in that this CD seemed not as real somehow.  I was not loving the strings and the what I considered to be the over-orchestrated music.  She is so amazingly good when her voice is up front, with the piano and the rest of the music takes a bit of a back seat.  Next time skip all those sweet strings.<br /><br />Also for, something that has been marketed as a 'latin' album, it isn't.. and the strings do not help any.  More conga and other percussion, less violin would have been my choice.<br /><br />I won't listen to this one over and over like I have other other albums and now I wish I'd gone to iTunes and pre-listened.  I wouldn't have bought the whole thing!
0307450570|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite MS books, and I have many. The marbled paper bound in the inside cover of this book just blows me away. I know it's just a copy of a marbled piece, but it's still beautiful. The colors are amazing. And that's the the inside paper binding!     The photography is amazing. At first I thought the book would just be projects all seen in prior magazines, but there's even some new stuff I'd never seen before too. I love all the templates shared as well.     One thing I must say, the copperplate calligraphy exemplar isn't true copperplate. I would say that it was likely inspired by copperplate, which is fine, but if you want to know the exact letterhand first, which is the best way to learn, this is not true copperplate. Once you know the true letterhand, play and flourish and make your own look. If you really want to learn traditional calligraphy styles, that would be my recommendation. I'd also say that you need more than just a little practice. Practice, practice, practice and practice even more.
B0016NF06O|4.0|On this album, Willie Nelson sings with a jazz band led by Wynton Marsalis.  The album was recorded live in January of 2007.  The set list includes blues songs, country songs and pop standards.  Willie's singing style works well with a jazz band, which is not surprising.  Actually, Willie sounds like he always sounds, it's the music that is different.  It's kind of like a Willie album with a jazz band, featuring more instrumental solos than usual.  It's a very good album which Willie's fans should enjoy.
1433503808|5.0|I believe that the ESV is one of the best translations that we have right now.  It is easy to read and follow and staying true to what the original language says.  As for other reviewers stating that it is not progressive enough is a very interesting statement.  To claim that the word of God has to change to this world is a very deceived way of thinking.  God's word never changes and more importantly God never changes.  As for the comment about ESV commentators for the study bible; claiming that they are homophobic, I will say this. NRSV is not truly translating certain passages right, giving the allusion that homosexuality isn't it even stated.  For example 1 Corinthians 6:9 in NRSV lists acts of sexual immorality and it has male prostitutes as one.  In the greek language the word used here meant men who act in homosexuality which many non-progressive bibles translate as.  So it makes you wonder, which version is staying true to God's word and also makes you wonder how many other verses NRSV is translating in a more politically correct way.  In this day and age if you are a true believer in Christ and you truly want to learn His word, stick with the bibles that are translated from the original languages.  Try to stay away from interpertations.    I have read from ESV now for awhile and I'm awaiting the new study bible and I'm very excited for it.  I do not have any particular reviews for this edition (color, size, notes) quite yet, but I felt that I needed to address certain statements that were made against it.  Hope this review helps enlighten and bring discernment to any book or interpertation that would make you think that the Word of God needs to change for the 21st century.    Thanks and have a blessed day.  In Jesus' name.

0143038419|1.0|The writing is an easy read, but the content is very narcissistic and self absorbed.  There is nothing deep about her experience other than having experiences that helpswith her depression or another way of putting it - sure when you're in deep depression, traveling the world and seeing different cultures would help.    But she almost expect men to find her attractive in order to validate her low self esteem. She compares herself to younger women in Italy cos she is somewhat old.   If this is truly a deep book, she would have talked more about  the people around her, what she learned from THEIR behavior and look at the world from in different perspective.  But it is always HER perspective, that is what's making this book very narcissistic.    Please, for those who find this book inspiring, deep and resonates with their experience, you need to look deeper and look beyond \\"yourself\\".
B000MNP2KI|5.0|When was the last time you were wowed by a Bond film?<br /><br />Mine was the first Bond film I watched when I was 7 and it was The Spy Who Loved Me. Since then, I have watched all the Bond films, and none seem to have the depth nor character development usually required in a real film.<br /><br />This Bond movie is different. This is a different kind of Bond and a different kind of a Bond film.<br /><br />Daniel Craig plays a Bond with a actual psyche. Yes, Bond has feelings now! He even has psychological vulnerabilities!<br /><br />Vesper Lynd, played so skillfully by Eva Green, pokes at Bond's vulnerabilities by guessing, presumably correctly, \\"you are an orphan!....you did not come from money and your friends at Oxford NEVER let you forget it!\\".<br /><br />The fight sequences has Bond getting hurt and even getting a few scratches on his face. Yes, Bond gets hit and gets hurt too. Whoever thought that was possible? Bond is far from mythical, he is all too human. And that makes him far more interesting than ever.<br /><br />Daniel Craig portrays Bond as an angry, almost psychotic, man willing to do anything to achieve his mission. Sometimes, he lets his anger get the better of his judgment and he even unravels.<br /><br />Did I also mention this is the best casino gambling film I have ever seen?<br /><br />Overall, this is a masterpiece that will be remembered by Bond fans for a long time to come. It will be hard to beat this one.
B0014G5LG2|5.0|Mahler 10 is one of my favorite symphonies, not just because it is 'beautiful music', but especially because it is so very different from anything Mahler ever created, I think. First of all I am drawn to this symphony (can one really 'love' this music?) because of the weird and wonderful, sometimes horrific, soundworld it inhibits - with its nervous unease but also desperate longing - and the dangerous flirtings with atonality and its bone chilling emotional implications: with Mahler, the atonal episodes (often forte or fortissimo) in his music surely stand for (sometimes utter) fear and despair ... Yes, this is music about loss and fear of death, but also it is music about the deepest possible passion for life and love!<br /><br />If I may be allowed to compare this recording with one of my favorite recordings of this symphony, namely the one by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra (BPO) under Sir Simon Rattle. This performance by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra (VPO) under Daniel Harding is long breathed and flowing (at about the same playing times for all movements, compared to Rattle). The playing in the recording with the BPO under Rattle is more sharply accentuated, which has an emotonally jarring effect (which is indeed very appropriate, IMHO). The climaxes on this VPO recording are more gradually built up but at the same time powerful. The whole recording is characterized by a deep sense of coherence and 'flow' - a 'warmer', more enveloping sound too (an objective statement, because the somewhat more 'jittery' playing and the more directly recorded instruments - accentuating their individual timbres - on the BPO/Rattle recording is an utter success, to my ears). While Daniel Harding paints the aural canvas with a grand chiaroscuro tableau, Simon Rattle could be said to more accentuate the jarringly modernist or expressionist aspects of Mahler's Tenth Symphony.<br />Luckily, like Rattle, Daniel Harding uses only one stroke on the muffled bass drum to end movement IV, from which the uneasy, grimm beginnings of the Finale can start off without further ado. And luckily, the drum-stroke is not fortissimo for 'dramatic effect', but forte (or is it piano?), so as not to contast too much with the dull and dark beginnings of the Finale. We don't have to overstate the case here: we are in a certain 'death' mood at the very beginning already, so we don't have to hammer it down with the bass drum too, I think. From this 'death' mood, the music slowly climbs out of the horror, while along the way reliving all the experiences we have come across earlier in the course of the symphony, the music of longing and love gaining the upper hand and ending the symphony not just in a sigh of longing but in a final shout of love to the world (and Alma) ...<br />Some reviewers have stated that this performance, with its flowing legato playing, gives it an extra sense of coherency that belies the sketchy origin of the notes. But I myself believe that both recordings - by Harding as well as Rattle - are convincing creations of this music. My personal favorite remains the BPO/Rattle, but this recording is a masterful and eloquent addition to the ever growing Mahler 10 discography. If you love Mahler's Tenth Symphony, then you should at least sample this recording. Highly recommended.which the uneasy, grimm beginnings of the Finale can start off without further ado.

B000QXDED6|2.0|This movie has a plot of a comic book written for a 12 yr old. Oh wait, it derived from a comic book written for a 12 yr old!<br /><br />The acting and action remind me of WWF wrestling. It is not only fake, but it is also macho fake. They must also have used cheap 1980's kung-fu films for inspiration of their fighting sequences. Characters carry a dialogue while almost playfully slashing their foes.<br /><br />All this is too bad since the real story of the 300 Spartans hardly had to be sensationalized. The heroics of the 300 Spartans is one of the truly memorable \\"last stand\\" in military history. Most, if not all, military academies teach the valor of the 300 Spartans who gave up their lives NOT for their ego but to protect the flanks of other retrieving Spartans (yes Spartans DID retreat when it made sense).<br /><br />If anything, this movie downplays the heroism of the 300 Spartans. Why did the story ignore the fact the 300 Spartans knowingly sacrificed themselves to protect the flanks of the entire Spartan army?<br /><br />Lastly, the movie had some sinister themes. For example, politicians who oppose war are the sinister antagonists. The hero Leonidis, the protagonist, recklessly engages in a battle against Persians even though it is \\"illegal\\" and not sanctioned by rest of the Sparta.<br /><br />Who are the Persians? (present day Iran and parts of Iraq). They are portrayed as inhuman warmongers who happens to have a 7-9 foot tall  androgenous dude as their leader.<br /><br />Were the creators trying to draw analogy to George W Bush's invasion of Iraq?<br /><br />Who knows. But I know I would have enjoyed this movie more if I was 12, but I am not.

B001PPLIEQ|4.0|James Bond, unfortunately, becomes an invincible spy again.<br /><br />He beats up bunch of agents in an elevator with his hands tied behind his back. He can outrun, outdrive, and outpunch anyone. Oh, and he hardly ever takes a punch from anyone. His pistol never misses or runs out of ammunition while the machine gun fire of his enemies always miss. Did I mention Bond can probably bench 800 pounds in this film? (he lifts one man up with ONE arm).<br /><br />Yet, this film is still better than most Bond films. Daniel Craig is still a great actor and his portrayal of Bond is unmistakably the best.<br /><br />The hotel in the last sequence, which seems to be made of a cardboard, has multitude of methane tanks conveniently located where Bond can blow them. Furthermore, the hotel apparently had zero fire suppression since the entire hotel catches fire in mere 5 seconds. But the hotel must be made of smoke free materials since there is ZERO smoke in midst of all the fire. How convenient for the movie crew!<br /><br />This movie is nowhere near as good as Casino Royale. Why go back to the old \\"invincible Bond\\" formula that has been done and redone so many times?

B001HN69AE|1.0|As a fan of the original anime on which this movie is based, I was wary about a live-action film, and with good reason. The Dragon Ball series is riddled with talking animals, gods, aliens, and other fantastic elements that do not mesh well with a live action film. But it isn't any of these things that earned the film such a low rating.    For one thing, the story lacks development. No explanations are given for more or less anything. The whole movie seems rushed, as if they threw together a story as quickly as possible and decided against putting any real effort into it.    Worse, there is nearly no character development whatsoever. Goku, the main character, is given a typical story. An outcast in school with a crush on the school hottie, Chi-Chi. But beyond that, he lacks depth. When his grandfather dies, he doesn't seem all that upset about it. He doesn't swear to defeat Piccolo, his heart isn't filled with rage. He's just...sad. And then he's over it, as if the man who had raised him had never existed. Goku isn't the only one to feel flat as a character; they all suffer from it, to such a degree that you become bored.    And speaking of bored, the fight scenes weren't very interesting at all. The original anime was all about fighting. Sure there was saving the world, and having adventures, and the eponymous Dragonballs, but in the end it always boiled down to a fight. The fights in this movie were dull. And worse, they were short. Terribly short. There was a fight scene in the anime that lasted over 4 episodes. None lasted beyond 2 minutes in this movie.    The acting wasn't stellar, but to be honest the actors/actresses weren't given much to work with. Like I said before, the characters were all...simple. Boring. Even Piccolo, the almighty alien who wants to rule the planet, gets no development. What is his motivation? Who is he? Where does he come from? None of these questions are answered. I suppose they felt developing the characters was pointless, since this movie was made only to appeal to those who had seen the anime. The fact that you can hardly tell it's James Marsters under all that make-up doesn't help.    This movie isn't the worst movie you'll ever see. It's not terrible. But It isn't good either. The sad part is, there's a lot of potential here. This could have been a good movie, if they had actually put some effort into it. I mean, the final fight between Goku and Piccolo, the be-all end-all grudge match for the fate of the world...was boring. I found myself wishing it was over, even though it didn't last more than two minutes. I was more entertained watching him confront his school bullies near the beginning of the movie.    This was a sad representation of a fine anime, a half-baked attempt to cash in on the popularity of something great. If they'd done it right, it could have been great as well. But movies like this are why anime and comic books have such a hard time hitting the silver screen.

B0009P5YXO|2.0|Got this as a gift for my husband, not as a child's toy.  It has sat in the box since.  It looks and feels very cheap, I'm not exactly strong & it felt like about to break when I tried to manipulate it so would probably not last long at all with a child.  I see I've put 3 stars for durability by mistake & it won't let me edit.  We haven't bothered to try to use it except for a couple of minutes on opening so I can't speak to durability but I don't expect much from the cheap flimsy feel of it! The sound effect is just a very weak buzz, we both said \\"that was it??\\"  It's not even nice to use as a pen.  It may end up on eBay but the buyer would probably want his money back!  I'd say it's one of those things that seems like a fun idea but very disappointing in its execution & don't waste your money!
B001PPLIFU|2.0|The movie is miscalculated and suffers from a weak screenplay and a dull plot which relies much too heavily on its predecessor.  The movie tries to faithfully continue where \\"Casino Royale\\" left off, which is the films biggest mistake.  The result is a movie which seems unoriginal and weighed down considerably by its own plot.  The movie never gets to become its own film.  It is anchored too deeply to the past.  The story suffers immensely because it gets too confusing to remember all the little plot points from its predecessor.  More importantly -- we don't bother to.  The film never gets any lift.  It never engages us.  The action sequences seem artificial and out of place.  The villain is lackluster and his \\"evil scheme\\" is pretty pathetic.  The climax was ridiculously poor.  This is just not an entertaining film.  It should have been a standalone movie - plain and simple.  The action sequences were almost laughable at times.  The Dark Knight has spoiled me and makes films like this look like the final project of a high-school film class.  Skip it and wait for the next one which has some promise as it will be a standalone movie.
B0012GN2U6|5.0|This album has some real gems on it.  As a longtime Santana fan, I still managed to catch on to this album late.  I was listening to a new age station and Aquamarine was played.  I was stunned.  How could I have missed this tune?  And to think it came from Santana?  I knew the driving \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" piece and was pleased to find that on this album as well.<br /><br />Recently, while burning this to CD from LP and dumping it into my iPod, I sat and gave the whole album a listen.  There are a number of songs on here that deserve a listen.  If you already know and love Santana, don't miss this album.  If you are just getting a feel for Santana, this is also good for you!
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|Journey to the Center of the Earth is yet another take on Jules Verne's classic novel. The film brings to the screen a scientist whose brother was lost trying to retrace the steps of Verne's characters.   Don't look for the movie to make any sense; it doesn't, as it is totally unbelievable even for a Verne's novel.  Brendan Fraser, Josh Hutcherson, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well though the acting is nothing extraordinary. The revelation is in relation to the lovely Anita Briem who steals the show and proves beyond any doubt that she has the potential to have a great career in acting.  The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are all right, though there was plenty of room for improvement.  In a nutshell, it's not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment for pre-teens. 3 Stars

1416914307|3.0|*SPOILERS*<br /><br />What I loved about this series is that each novel is progressively better. Certain reviewers called Clare's writing purple prose, but compared to S. Meyer, she is fantastic. That was the greatest relief to me: here is a love story, and a fascinating world along with in depth characters that keeps the reader hungry for more. Some scenes are just so beautifully written that I have to admire Clare's storytelling prowess.<br /><br />That said, Clary was a bit flat. She's likable enough, but I just felt that Clare could have made her real the way Harry Potter is real. Clary is described as feisty, but you don't really get that from her actions, more Jace's and Luke's ascertations that she is that way. The other characters- Simon, Jace, Alec, Magnus, and Isabelle - the reader knows them, and most importantly, Clare knows them. But Clary... she's just there to explain the finer points of the plot as a weakish literary device. I do love that she isn't so frail at the end of the series- going after the Book of White, sneaking out of Amatis', getting up in front of the Clave with her \\"save Alicante\\" spiel, etc. It's characterization that we don't get in books 1 and 2.<br /><br />The imagery and the folklore behind Idris is so amazing. Clare's construction of a world of shadowhunters, downworlders, demons, and the ethereal is well done. It's complete. Five stars.<br /><br />The plot takes away from this at points. I hated that Jace and Clary thought they were siblings. You know all along that they'll find out differently, and the revelation isn't all that stunning. There are too many forced scenes in the plot- the endless dialogue to explain people's pasts and actions for example. Luke is usually the vessel for this, although Jocelyn winds up revealing the truth about Jace and Clary when she wakes from her potion-induced coma. And we knew that was coming, of course. Sometimes there are too many interweaving plot twists so that it seems Clare is trying too hard to make the story complicated and compelling. The characters are compelling enough, leave it be, Clare!<br /><br />Overall, the series is worth reading. Clare is the kind of writer who will only get better, as evidenced by the progression of the novels both in prose and storytelling. The characters are unforgettable and worth knowing, if only that you will miss them when you've finished. It's a breath of fresh air, especially after the garbage S.

B0017ZB8M6|5.0|I love this CD for the music and the talent of Katy Perry.    At first, I thought Katy was another product of the music industry stuff... She caught my attention with Hot and Cold as I loved the rhythm and energy in that song.    So I go online and listen to the other tracks to check her out, without expecting much... And then as I listen to the tracks previews I start thinking... hey there is something here... And there is really a multitude of great songs from the first to the last. So much that I actually bought the CD, something I did not accomplish for ages. The result is a super album, Katy Perry's music (pop-rock) is simply great and fun. Now I want to go to her concert :)
B000007MVM|5.0|Classic album!  Artist Dimthingshineon recently did a cover of Syd Barrett songs: \\"No Good Trying\\" and \\"Baby Lemonade\\" on his latest 4 CD project called \\"Nostalgia\\" released in 2009. [...]
B001ECQ75A|3.0|Not a bad movie but no where near as good as the movie \\"Cars\\". I wouldn't have wanted to pay for 5-6 kids to see it at the movie theater.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Even though season three of \\"Supernatural\\" was tragically cut short because of the writer's strike, 16 episodes instead of the usual 22, it never came up short. It ended the season with one massive cliffhanger and left it's fans and viewers wanting to race through the summer to see what happened. Dean had to beat the clock thanks to his deal with the crossroads demon, and when the season ended, it left many people wondering how in the world it could continue. What did creator Eric Kripke have up his sleeve?. Will the show ever be the same?. Season four is still currently airing as of this writing, with only one more episode to go. The big season finale. It is sure to be brilliant thanks to an already brilliant season. So, what does season four have in store?. Let's get into it(without being spoilery)....    The basic premise for season 4 concerns Dean Winchester(the continually show stealing Jensen Ackles)and his reappearance out of hell. He and the others will wonder how it happened, who did it, and if it plays a bigger part in something. Brother Sam(Jared Padalecki)has his own demons, all the while the two of them still traveling the highways and back roads of America hunting down evil...with some new help along the way in the form of Castiel(Misha Collins).    Season four of \\"Supernatural\\" displays the show at it's very best. I have been thrilled and overjoyed with each passing season, one just as great or better than the last, and season 4 has truly elevated the show to another level. The scares, humor, and brotherly drama is all there in full force, but it seems so much more epic. The writers and everyone behind the scenes have thrown everything out there to deliver a whopper of a season. So, what to expect?. The season premiere, \\"Lazarus Rising\\", is the best season premiere of the show by far. It answers some questions, raises some more, and has a glorious introduction to Castiel. Perfect beginning. Other highlights of season 4 include \\"In The Beginning\\", which features a great guest appearance by Mitch Pileggi, Skinner on \\"The X Files\\". It's a great 'Back To The Future-esque' type episode that reveals some new surprises of the Winchester family. And they keep a comin' this season!. A top highlight is the fantastic \\"Monster Movie\\", a loving homage to the horror movies of the 30's and 40's, complete with the right staging, lighting, music and, best of all, shot in black and white. \\"It's The Great Pumpkin, Sam Winchester\\" is a very cool Halloween episode. Fans waiting for the show to do an episode on the holiday shouldn't be disappointed. \\"Family Remains\\" is a classic horror story with a fun twist; \\"Afterschool Special\\" is a wonderful flashback episode looking at the Winchester bros in, you guessed it, high school; \\"Jump The Shark\\" is a shocking episode that puts a new wrinkle in the Winchester family; \\"The Monster At The End Of The Book\\" is just great. What may seem like a stand alone, quickly veers deep into the show and it's ongoing arc this season. The first few minutes are side splitting hilarious as the show takes a 'wink, wink, nudge, nudge' approach at it's own self and the fans. There are many more great episodes and moments, like the return of two fan favorites in \\"Are You There God?, It's Me, Dean Winchester\\", radical wishes coming true in \\"Wishful Thinking\\", and so much more. Bigm arc heavy episodes abound in \\"On The Head Of A Pin\\", \\"When The Levee Breaks\\", and others. Not a stinker in the bunch.    Season four is filled to the brim with excitement, action, scares, chills, and plenty of new unbelieveable twists, turns, and surprises. It could of all veered off course if it weren't for the incredible Eric Kripke, and all of the amazingly talented people working on the show. Of course, the shows rests on the shoulders of the Winchester boys themselves, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. Ackles continues to knock it out of the park and continuously impresses with each passing season. He gets plenty to chew on here. Padalecki really came into his own as Sam in season 2 and has continued to evolve from there. He gets some juicy stuff here in season four and he takes Sam to places we haven't seen before. It turns into some tight drama, and the brother/family drama that the show is so much about is tested throughout the season. Elsewhere, Jim Beaver continues to be a strong asset to the show(and the boys)as Bobby, and Genevieve Cortese takes over the role of Ruby(replacing Katie Cassidy, who I liked better in the role). Misha Collins, as Castiel, is a wonderful new addition to the show. He has the right balance of mysteriousness with Castiel.     In the end, season four shows a series that is at the top of it's game. Hitting on all cylinders. Supernatural, like Buffy, just grows and grows from season to season, deepening it's story and inner family turmoil, with plenty of shocking surprises and twists along the way. Season four of Supernatural is shocking, brave, brilliant, witty, scary, and exciting. One can only wonder what Kripke and Co. have in store for us for season five.

B000VASG3M|4.0|I bought this to be able to see all 3 in sequence and follow the story line of musicals.   Each movie can stand alone but the sequence of events will be omitted.  Supposed time lapse occurs by seeing all 3. No. 1 and No. 2 are about a B value whereas No. 3 is A in my opinion.  I enjoyed all 3 and have a very young granddaughter that will watch any of them.   She loves to dance and sing with \\"The Boys Are Back\\" and \\"Gotta Get It Together\\".
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|The Reader is a solid four star movie.  The story is completely unique and is a movie that is dark, thought provoking, and disturbing.  Kate Winslet is very good, obviously she won an Oscar for her performance but I didn't believe she was amazing.  Here character is entirely believable and has a certain realness about her.  There is no doubt that The Reader is an adult content film with the amount of nudity and sex taking place between a 30+ year old and a 15 year old boy.       It is a solid film and I would recommend it based off the story.  It does captivate you and really makes you wonder about the mind of two main characters.  How do two people get so disturbed and also it shows what a situation like that can do to you the rest of your life.  This isn't your typical love story and that is why I enjoyed it.  The story spans over 30 years and changes as all relationships do.  Definately a Unique and solid film
B000MV90B2|5.0|Why Hollywood studios would not remaster and market this movie is beyond my understanding, considering that they are chucking out DVDs of B-movies and other junky movies from years past as fast as they can.<br /><br />This is no CGI like 'Troy' and such, this is literally cast of thousands, if only Russian soldiers as extras, the only other country that could actually brag of using real extras in this number is China right now, where movies could still be made with such large number of extras... even then, they still use CGI to suppliment the scenes.<br /><br />As to the film, it is sad that it could only be view in its original, aged condition and only available from DVD produced overseas either in England or Hong Kong; yet, Hollywood's lost is our gain, for now, because we could get the movie relatively cheap online here.<br /><br />For such an epic movie, it is relatively fast paced. I could not but feel overwhelmed during the battle scenes. All I could say is... Wow!!!<br /><br />Once again, viewing this movie, it makes me wondered, once again, whether Napoleon should be seen as a villian or a great man... or a little of both. Undeniably, he was one of the greatest leader whom could command such loyalty from his army- and respects from his enemies!<br /><br />Bravo to the movie! It should be added to anyone's collection! Enjoy!
0307346609|5.0|Max Brooks has clearly produced a classic with World War Z. There were times when I was on the edge of my seat and I am certainly not easy to please when it comes to quality in a novel. What distinguished this Sci-Fi from many other works that I have read, is that it goes beyond \\"mindless Zombie entertainment\\". If you read it on the level for which it was intended you will see that it is a social commentary on our society...it captures our world in a new, exciting but very real way. It is truly unique....you got to read this if you haven't already. Right now I'm reading it for the second time.
B001NFNFIK|5.0|My wife and I both enjoy just about anything the talented and versatile Tommy Lee Jones does.  This movie is no exception ~ keeps your attention from beginning to end.  We've never been disappointed with his performance.  And John Goodman as the 'nasty' enhances the storyline.    Entertaining ~ don't miss it.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is one of the best board games I've played.  It creates a very active environment for all players, and everyone has a good chance of winning.  It does not take hours to play or learn.  Kids could play it but it is really a great game for adults.
B000E6FSPW|5.0|I've owned the original 'Rocky IV' soundtrack for years but this new remastered version is much better! All songs have the same mix (except \\"Sweetest Victory\\") but the sound quality is improved & louder which of course is typical of remastered CDs these days & there is a bonus track from Survivor, \\"Man Against the World.\\" The icing on the cake for me however was the remixed \\"Sweetest Victory\\" by Touch. If you heard the original version you already know it's the most rockin' track on the disc even though it never made the cut for the film but the newer remixed version is just amazing! EVERY instrument & the vocals stand out nice & clear & has an edgier feel to it & there is some saxophone parts added to give it that special \\"touch.\\" Too bad that Touch never did much in their career because that song has to be one of the greatest rock gems of all time! If you love this movie & excellent pop/hard rock from the 80s then buy this soundtrack!
B00002MZ2T|3.0|My daughter and I had this CD from years ago, and it had gotten scratched, so when a run through our Disk Doctor didn't produce any results, I decided we should replace it.  How much fun to sing back through songs we forgot we knew!  Mellow and mild, and even though a bit dated, we are still glad to have it back in our collection.

B001TH16DI|4.0|Firstly we are very fortunate in Australia that we get this set around 2 weeks before the US. The price we pay however is that the set costs nearly double here what it is on Amazon (and that is adjusted for the currency difference). And despite this I am still calling it a worthwhile upgrade  Firstly the good. The movies look about as good as you can reasonably expect. For something that did not go through a Lowry or equivalent frame by frame meticulous restoration this is a good looking set of movies overall (with some reservations as explained below).    As of writing I have only had a chance to fully view the first film and sample parts of II and IV. The Motion Picture was thoroughly impressive. Given low expecations that it was not a restoration like Wrath of Khan I did not expect much. The visuals were thoroughly engaging and the transfer looks like it was done off of a freshly minted print especially for this transfer. There was a visible lack of marks and scratches on the film. Do a compare against the Director's Cut DVD and you'll see a huge number of blemishes on that version. Interestingly the striking visuals of the Theatrical Version were more compelling visually (and more authentic) than the Director's Edition on DVD. For the record I DO NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE but found it compelling viewing until the last act (which becomes a little much). The visual upgrade finally shows what Robert Wise was going for as far as impressive optical effects and these hold up surprisingly well 30 years later. So #1 was a worthwhile watch, prob the most i ever enjoyed this film. The sound was also decent. Not the full range effort of today's best transfers but pleasing enough with generally clear dialogue. I also briefly sampled The Voyage Home and it was generally a pleasing transfer with a solid soundtrack. The upgrade becomes more noticeable if you then compare to the previous DVD editions. You'll find these hard to watch after Blu Ray.  Now for the not so good. Yes, theseare theatrical versions and truth be told probably the optimal versions to watch (tighter, less self indulgent and \\"original\\") but it would be nice to have the choice of the Dir ed or original for completeness. However the most disappointing thing about this set (so far) has been Khan. The packaging notes that this is a fully restored transfer. When putting it in the Blu Ray player I started wondering whether someone substituted the disc on me. From the first half hour or so I watched I noticed the image had a noticeable degradation from the first movie. Likely due to the lower production budget and likely lower quality film stock used. The image had a noticeable lack of sharpness compared to the first film, the sound was rather hollow (seemed like less ADR and more location dialogue, that was at times hard to understand). If this is a restoration I'd hate to see the state of the original elements and I have to wonder whether the restoration work could have been done a lot better. I expected a real showcase for what is considered the best film in the series and so far I was thoroughly underwhelmed. Again it's better than the DVD edition but should be a lot further improved.   The other noticeable thing was the excessive use of video noise reduction or otherwise known as grain removal (esp noticeable on The Voyage Home). The transfer there was generally good, but the grain removal made all the faces look like they were rendered with putty. Unnatural and overly smooth. This made the film less engaging as subtle facial expressions are lost (or rather smeared away). The sound here also lacked the depth you would want to hear from the best High Def transfer.   But, on the whole anyone who likes their Trek should consider picking these up. Even if there is a double, or triple dip coming you can enjoy the films now in the finest quality and technology available today. In our case you pay an arm and a leg for the luxury, but hey...Life is too short. And when they release asuperior edition with more compelling content, i'll probably buy it again...and then again a few years later when they come up with something better again. We keep buying new versions of software that are just different enough to warrant a respurchase - why would film be any different?    My vote - good enough for now, but could have been so much better...
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I first saw this movie when my husband brought it home from the movie rental store. I admit, I was first pissed that he  made this choice for our evening entertainment.  I was so wrong on what I though this movie was!  The little boy in the film stole the show so much that I had to look him up on the internet to find out who he was.  Without giving the story away,all I have to say is this was the most adorable movie I have seen in a long time! I loved it so much that I bought it for gifts for my family members.What did they say about the movie? They loved it just as much as I did!
0393317552|4.0|This is a very interesting, well-written, easy-to-read book.  It answers my questions about why some groups of people developed advanced technology and others developed only primitive technology. It also answers the question:  why do some cultures remain hunter-gatherers, even to this day? It explains the domestication of plants and animals and how the availability of these influenced the advancement of people. This book would definitely be of value to history buffs and educators.
0375757422|4.0|Emma Woodhouse is in need of a new particular friend now that her governess has married.  As luck would have it, she meets pretty and artless Harriet Smith, a girl of obscure parentage.  Emma is convinced that Harriet is a gentleman's daughter (after all, she did attend a good boarding school), and takes it upon herself to teach her the ways of a lady and to introduce her to a good eligible gentleman that would elevate her station in life.  Harriet has her eyes set on a simple farmer, but that is not enough for her, at least not according to Emma.  She knows what's best for everyone around.  Emma fancies herself a matchmaker.  In fact, she takes credit for introducing Mr. Weston to her former governess.  And, at twenty-one, she has no intention of ever marrying.  She has to look after her father and their Hartfield estate.  She is an heiress to thirty thousand pounds and is well respected among her peers.  What more could she want?  But Harriet needs Mr. Elton.  A girl like Harriet cannot become an old maid like the tiresome Miss Bates.  Emma is determined to make it happen, and she doesn't care what Mr. Knightley, her brother-in-law's brother, has to say on the matter.<br /><br />Jane Austen is known for creating flawed characters, most of which are not central in her stories.  The closest Austen came to creating an anti-heroine was Marianne Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility.  But the novel is told mostly from Elinor Dashwood's POV, which makes Marianne seem less insufferable.  Emma is Austen's official anti-heroine -- a young woman who thinks she knows so much when she actually knows nothing.  She is essentially clueless to everything that goes on around her.  Mr. Knightley is always there to scold her and set her right, of course.  Emma, though not my favorite Austen, is a lovely story.  The theme is very popular and it has inspired many authors and Hollywood producers throughout the years.  (The 1995 teen flick Clueless is a modern-day adaptation of Emma.)  It has also inspired an infinite number of sequels written by new authors.  Austen does sort of drag the story a bit toward the end, which is why I take away half a star.  That, in a nutshell, is the only drawback in this book.  The rest is wonderful.  You will get all of the Austenian elements here: a shocking match, irritating snobs, hilarious social commentary, balls and assemblies, silly ladies and suspiciously charming men.  Mr. and Mrs. Weston, Miss Bates, Harriet Smith, Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax are my favorite characters -- after Mr. Knightley, of course.  He is my third favorite of the Austen men (after Mr. Darcy and Captain Wentworth).  If you're new to Jane Austen, then Emma is a good way to start.  You won't be able to resist reading her five other books.  I read this several years ago, but the experience was more enjoyable this time around.  Jane Austen is as addictive as chocolate and I look forward to reading Mansfield Park soon.as also inspired an infinite number of sequels written by new authors.

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|If you are his fan you will not be able to resist watching this video again and again. Cohen's meaningful poetry and melodies are emphasized by excellent musicians who perform using exotic instruments. A special highlight is the version by the twin backup singers of \\"If It Be Your Will\\", which the poet prefaces with a few spoken lines of that prayer-like composition. The artist begins with \\"Dance Me to the End of Love\\" and ends with several familiar encores. This admirer thought the show would last an hour and a half or so but was an hour longer and it is heard that in a concert in San Francisco the series of encores lasted longer than the actual show. Hey Amazon, I need several more stars because five is inadequate.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|I have the previous DVD of this and it was a 2 sided DVD, is this the same one tweaked a little for quality?

B001K3JF7K|5.0|I loved this recording, but I have loved most of her recordings. the cuts on this CD are consistent, tight and well orchestrated her playing is superb as usual and her voice is still husky and sexy.

But if you want to be transported to a better place some evening, this is an albumn worth having in your collection.
B001FB55MG|3.0|The movie was an enjoyable family movie. This was a movie that the commercials hyped to the point where my expectations of what was happening was somewhat of a let down when actually viewing the movie.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|I loved this film. Really, really loved it. It was written by the same guys who did The Matrix trilogy, which is perfect because the films were anime-inspired. Speed Racer didn't do so well in theaters; it didn't get very high reviews either. The film is intense visually. I'm not sure what it would be like to see it on the big screen; maybe too much to appreciate. But I also think it's really cutting-edge stuff, artistically magical. Under-appreciated genius. I'm not a huge anime fan, but I'll tell you what I appreciated about this film. The layering, the blending, um, the racing! (I've never had such a craving for slick track go-carts), the cars, the choreographed \\"car-fu,\\" and, the visual image-layering -- oh, did I say that already; well, that just might have been my favorite part.<br /><br />I've never seen the original cartoon, but I know enough about it to be able to tell when certain scenes and lines were paying tribute. Intuitively, the film seemed honorable; you know, the film had honorable intentions toward the original. The movie makes me want to see the original cartoon. The character development was quite good. The plot was great. This is one that doesn't just sit on the shelf; I find myself coming back to watch it time and time again.
B0000DG00B|4.0|This album is a great document of the original Allman Brothers in a festival setting.  Though rougher and rawer than the Fillmore concerts it contains some gems (Hootchie Cootchie Man, Every Hungry Woman, Dreams) that were not included and/or performed in the Fillmore sets.  My one question is where's Johnny Winter?  His much touted appearance on Mountain Jam is barely audible.  All the solos are done by Dicky and Duane.  An earlier review claims that this version was edited down to 28 minutes from 40 minutes.  I guess Johnny ended up on the cutting room floor.  Aside from this minor dissappointment these recordings are a treat for Allman Bros. fans - and a bit of atrip back in time.
1401219268|4.0|The book took nearly a month for me to receive it, but considering how much cheaper it was, it was definitely worth it.  When I bought it, it said that the condition would be new.  And it kinda was; the book was wrapped but there were small dents on the bottom of it, and the cover had a crease or two on it.  Maybe my standards are too high, but if I buy a book that is said to be new, I want it to be 'new' not 'like new.'
B00006JKOM|5.0|A true anomaly in Jethro Tull's catalogue, Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll was positively loathed by the rock press when it was released. The album did reach a respectable 14 in the US charts, but actual sales were nowhere near what previous Tull releases had achieved. That the critics hated this was to be expected, but why did the fans turn off? It's hard to say, as this album is surely Jethro Tull's most \\"commercial\\" album of the Seventies.<br /><br />The array of styles present here are astounding! Folk, jazz, orchestral, blues, rock and (say it's not so!) show-tune stylings are all apparent: all are mixed together in a beguiling way, and the results are as quirky as hell!<br /><br />Quizz Kid, Crazed Institution, Taxi Grab and Big Dipper are all great rock songs, with Ian Anderson's characteristically scornful lyrics and Martin Barre's searing guitar work out front. Crazed Institution, a put-down of the glam rockers of the day, is especially good.<br /><br />Salamander and Bad-Eyed 'N' Loveless are among Anderson's finest acoustic pieces, while the epic title track is the only tune here to halfway establish itself as a radio hit.<br /><br />My personal favorites on Too Old To Rock 'n' Roll are, probably, the oddest tracks. From A Dead Beat To An Old Greaser is a haunting piece redolent of the decadent beat scene of Jack Kerouac, complete with intentionally sleazy sax solo. The Chequered Flag is a gorgeous finale, with some Elgar-like orchestrations and some incredible singing by Anderson. God, could he sing then!<br /><br />The one track on here that really doesn't work is Pied Piper. There's a whiff of \\"knock-off\\" about it, and while it does possess some intriguing quirkiness, the song mostly falls flat.<br /><br />The bonus tracks on here are excellent, too. A Small Cigar is hardly a masterpiece, but David Palmer's piano work is pure elegance! Strip Cartoon has always been one of my favorite tracks, and with its mixture of styles, it fits into this album perfectly!<br /><br />On a final note, although the knocks that this album has taken are not warranted, the criticism of the record's actual concept is entirely valid. Ian Anderson insists that the album's protagonist, one Ray Lomas, is not based on him at all. If that's the case, then it probably wasn't the best idea to have Ray Lomas drawn to resemble Anderson to a tee. Secondly, Ian has always denied making concept albums, but Too Old Too Rock 'n' Roll is a blatant concept album, and the concept is a rather self-aggrandizing one. \\"Once popular rocker became unfashionable but then regains popularity\\" is hardly a gripping dramatic device! But, at the end of the day, the music redeems the concept, and I would say that this ranks as one great album!at this album has taken are not warranted, the criticism of the record's actual concept is entirely valid.

B00008L3U1|4.0|Robin Williams, although an immensely funny and energetic comedian, has the raw acting talent to make you truly believe in his characters. He can emotionally engage you and allows for his supporting cast to remain prominent in his films without being overshadowed by the big characters that he plays. Patch Adams & Mrs. Doubtfire are two very fine examples of how Robin Williams can present an immensely funny character, yet retains a level of depth and reality that allow for the hysterical laughter without sacrificing the emotional importance of what his films are ultimately about. He achieves this just as well in Jack.<br /><br />The film is based around the main character, Jack. He is a child born with a rapid aging disability like that of the real condition known as Progeria. The parents are naturally shocked and upset by this news, but make a pledge to allow him as good a life as possible. Fast forward a few years and we see a child in the body of a grown man (Robin Williams) who has been secluded from the outside world by his parents to protect him from the cruelties and judgments of the real world. His home school tutor Lawrence (Bill Cosby) recommends to Jacks parents that he should be put into a public school so he can socialise and make friends.<br /><br />Anybodies first day of school is a terrifying one, but for Jack it's even more so thanks to him being in the body of a fully grown man entering an elementary school. Naturally his fellow classmates are a bit wary of this stranger in their classroom and keep well away whilst inventing stories. Mrs. Marquez (Jennifer Lopez), his teacher, warms quickly to Jack and strongly wants him to make friends and be accepted by his classmates. After being asked to join a team in a basketball game because of his height, he quickly becomes part of a group of friends who start to look past his appearance and recognise the kid within him.<br /><br />This is an immensely sweet and heart warming film and is personally one of my favourites starring the comic legend that is Robin Williams. It's largely unrecognised on the mainstream film stage and I would love it to get more recognition than it did then and does now. It's up there with the likes of Mrs. Doubtfire and Patch Adams. Although it's not as blatantly funny, it's more so an emotional piece with a strong message to deliver to us all about acceptance of the personality within everybody. Looking past the appearance and accepting people, warts and all.<br /><br />Directed by the legend of Francis Ford Coppola, there's no denying that this would have been an immensely enjoyable movie going piece. The inclusion of comedy legend Bill Cosby is also a delight and although he doesn't have a largely comic prominence, it's still a great thing to see him in the film. This is one of Jennifer Lopez' first movies and although I'm not crazy over her acting, she doesn't do a bad job overall. Williams is the true gem though and truly creates a believable and sweet character that we're all hoping will succeed in making friends.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to any fans of Robin Williams as it's truly one of his greatest.comic legend that is Robin Williams.

After a week I asked seller when it was shipped, they told me they did't remember. I asked about tracking number they told me they didn't have one.This item was supposed to be new and packaged,it was neither.DON'T TRUST THIS SELLER!!!!

B00007J36V|4.0|Unhalfbricking, Fairport's third album, is historically important because it includes the playing of future member Dave Swarbrick as well as the first electric-folk epic of all time: \\"A Sailor's Life.\\" It also includes the quintessential Sandy Denny composition \\"Who Knows Where the Time Goes?\\" and a fine Richard Thompson composition called \\"Genesis Hall,\\" written about his father's experiences as a policeman. Although the three aforementioned songs display Fairport at its best, the remaining tracks, including the hit version of Dylan's \\"If You Gotta Go, Go Now\\" sung in French, are somewhat unremarkable. The band does not play as tightly as usual, and, as a result, a few of the songs drag, and/or have a novelty feel to them. Still, this album is where British folk-rock truly began, and it does contain some fine music. This remastered edition has beautiful sound, and is certainly worth picking up,but I might recommend seeking out Liege & Lief or Full House first.

B00127RAJY|5.0|If I'm writing this, it means I just successfully completed Day 1, Level 1 of my Shredding without collapsing into a weary puddle. I've been exercising fairly consistently over several years, on and off (sometimes life shakes things up). I consider myself moderately fit at 5'9\\" and 140 lbs, but looking to drop those last pesky 10-15 pounds. I've always been the gym-rat type. Never bought a workout DVD before, and never thought I would. But I was looking for something different and had been researching for a while. I read the reviews, and I admit, I sought out the a$$-whooping I just received. I can't even imagine moving on to Level 2 any time soon. My butt has indeed been handed to me. And I liked it. Let's see how I do over the next 30 days. I'll do my best to post updates, folks.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|Let the Right One In is weird and bizarre and intelligent. I was bored at first, not knowing anything about the story. I hadn't even read the DVD jacket. Then when I realized it's a traditional vampire film, my interest increased. I caught on to what was happening and was surprised at the sensitivity and the excellent acting. It is also a film that I liked so much that I bought it. When I viewed it again, several things became apparent that I missed the first time. Yes, it's much better the second time. If you're a vampire film buff, this one is different, but it's true to the traditional vampire lore. It's also a love story. It has sexual overtones that are complex yet seemingly innocent. Don't miss it, and add it to any vampire film collection.

B0000683DH|5.0|Strange to think of it now. But when Star Trek II was originally released it was a huge shock to fans. Although a minor spoiler now, the death of Spock was as much of a blow as Darth Vader being Luke's father. And that was what makes the movie all the more compelling. Although it retains the feeling of the original series, it made very bold and risky choices in story telling.    The plot is pretty straight forward. During a training mission overseen by now Admiral James T Kirk, the crew of the Enterprise are confronted with an enemy from the past. Kahn, played with exceptional brevado by Ricardo Mantalban, is seeking revenge against Kirk for being deserted on a doomed planet. When a Federation science team mistakes Kahn's planet for a potential sight for an experiment, Kahn over takes the ship and hijacks the project in an attempt to lure Kirk into a trap.    What makes the film so good is how it both embraces and departs from the series roots. The chemistry between the core group of actors is better then ever, leaving the slightly stale feeling of Star Trek The Motion picture behind. But series fans are thrown for a loop by how things don't run as smoothly for the Enterprise crew. People are injured and killed throughout the film, throughing Kirk out of his usual comfort zone. In one scene Kirk watches as a young trainee dies in the wake of Kirks own negligence. The point is, things go very wrong and no amount of techno wizardry can fix it. It all culminates in a climax that demands the ultimate sacrifice to save the day.     Star Trek II stands out as the best film in the franchise and an excellent film in it's own right.
B001S86J0I|5.0|This is a great family movie. We watch it all the time. The DVD commentaries are great too. Look it up on wikipedia and get some additional movie facts. But it spoofs Star Trek in a way that is absolutely respectful. Action, space, sci-fi, and a load of comedy! Exceptional plot and acting. I wish the DVD had more features like a director's cut. When Laredo pulled the ship out of the space port for the first time and scratched the side of the ship against the space port wall on the way out, I rolled out of my chair.
B001N26GFM|4.0|This movie has only just hit the cinemas here in Australia to rave reviews and I have received my copy on DVD from Amazon and have to agree it is a sensational poignant film with an OH MY GOD ending.

B0007MWZEK|4.0|I really do love this sweeper.  It beats sweeping my hardwoods with the \\"old fashion\\" broom.  I like the fact that it fits in tight spaces and turns on a dime.  The only negative I would say is that the battery life is not that great.  After only 4-5 uses, I am recharging it.  But a good buy for your dollar!

I can't wait to read the next book and seee if this series is really worth reading all the way through.

B001MEJY8W|4.0|French horror films have been outshining Hollywood horror for the past few years. Writer/director Pascal Laugier's \\"Martyrs\\" is an ultra-violent, harrowingly brutal and disquieting film about human suffering; both mentally, physically and emotionally. At first glance, one would think that this film has religious undertones but no, it takes a different road as to how it makes its point. I've read that the film was rejected by a number of large French studios, and has been rejected by a lot of French actresses. \\"Martyrs\\" is the new \\"extreme\\" in European horror and makes the French horror film \\"Inside\\" seem like a regular horror film.<br /><br />15 Years after Lucie Jurin (Mylene Jampanoi) had escaped from an icy torture chamber in an abandoned building, this woman is bent on tracking down the instigators to her past suffering. She enlists the aid of her long-time friend, Anna (Morjana Alaoui) to find the family who tormented her and exact her revenge. Lucie seems to be haunted by violent visions that may or not be real that puts doubts about her sanity. Now, as Anna and Lucie investigate the mystery behind this family, they find that things are more sinister than they had expected and they stumble upon a secret organization bent on creating \\"martyrs\\"...<br /><br />\\"Martyrs\\" is extremely brutal and violent. The direction by Pascal Laugier exudes a very bleak atmosphere that complements the very graphic violence onscreen. The film has a great amount of blood and gore that never lets up. At first impression, I thought it was just going to be another \\"gore show\\" but the film's script offers a coherent plot and all the blood and gore just revolves around its screenplay. Laugier managed to keep the proceedings grounded and interesting, while the violence gets more brutal with each second, the plight of our protagonists becomes worst and worst, I became even more enthralled by the film. The film displays the VERY dark and twisted side of human arrogance, thinking that we can have answers by sacrificing morals and stooping to acts of brutality.<br /><br />The screenplay by Laugier is divided into two acts. In the first act, we would be privy to Lucie and Anna's past. Lucie is haunted by visions of an eerie and frightening naked figure, who seemingly has been tortured, abused and bent on hurting her until she finds her tormentors. The viewer challenged to question the depths of Lucie's psyche, whether her wounds are self-inflicted or done by an unseen force. It was a wise move for the direction to seed the audience's impressions and instill doubt. We also see the depths of Anna's and Lucie's budding friendship, there are subtle hints of lesbianism as well as guilt. The two characters' development mostly come in the form of flashbacks. Fear, guilt, confusion and anger are the emotions taken into exposition. The film carries a lot of emotion and surpasses the clich&eacute;s' of \\"torture porn\\".<br /><br />The second act goes into the secrets and goals of the highly organized group obsessed with the secrets of life beyond death. The second half of the film (the last 40 minutes) goes into the experiences of Anna and the harrowing fate that Lucie had escaped from years past. Anna is beaten, forced-fed, beaten again within an inch of her life. The film also has the grand-daddy of all gore scenes that make the \\"skinning\\" scene in Argento's \\"Pelts\\" seem like a Disney flick. This half of the film is actually the part that got under my skin, as it contained disturbing sequences of violence against women. I have a strong stomach, and while it may not be the bloodiest cinematic experience I've been privy to, it certainly was one of the most brutal. Director Laugier exposition of Anna's suffering will no doubt generate sympathy from his audience.<br /><br />For a film like this, the two actresses would have to perform admirably and they do; Mylene Jampanoi and Morjana Alaoui gives the performance of their careers. Amid all the brutality and violence,it would be easy to dismiss their performances and just let it all just wash over you. The two actresses manages to display all the needed emotions and if you look closely into their eyes you will witness the fear and major discomfort that they are experiencing. The film is nicely paced and has a fitting running time. I thought Pascal Laugier made the best of what he had. He did set the necessary groundwork and does give the film a satisfying climax, although I have to admit some viewers make scratch their heads as to what exactly happened.<br /><br />Just what is \\"martyrdom\\"? Is it a state of suffering in the name of religious faith or can even non-believers be martyred? Is it a mere state of catatonia? Well, the film does give you an answer but it is left to the viewers' own comprehension. It challenges the viewer to question what they have seen, and if you paid attention to the film's entirety, the answer is staring right at you. Violent, bleak and disturbing with some thought-provoking ideas to instill our emotion, \\"Martyrs\\" is one great horror thriller that puts Hollywood to shame.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the first exercise DVD I've purchased.  I made my selection based on other reviews, and was not disappointed.  Get ready for a very tough work out with solid results.  I wanted to get toned, and lose about 6-8 lbs.  I started about 3 weeks ago, and lost 5 pretty quickly - adjusting my diet to control calories.  This DVD works many important areas of your body, elevates your heart rate, and generally gives you an excellent awareness of what you need to do to get yourself in shape.  I'll be looking for additional Jillian Michaels DVDs that focus on abs and glutes.  BTW, my 15 y/o daughter does this too - and loves it.  Well worth the 20 minutes.  I've recommended this to many friends looking for a streamlined, impactful exercise routine.  There are 3 levels; I'm struggling through level 2, and I'm hugely athletic - tennis, golf, swimming, running...etc.  Get ready to swear and sweat.

B001PPGAIA|5.0|I was thrilled by the movie in the theatre and now I've been equally enthralled by seeing it on my own home large screen.  And, the sound track in 5.1 surround is wonderful.  All of this is combined with a memorable story and impressive scenery.

B0007KTBIU|5.0|This is the first movie I ever saw in a theatre. I remember sitting next to my mom and knowing I would always love this movie as the conch shells were blown to welcome home the warriors. I din't care about it not being historically accurate. I loved the colors, the music, the people, and Meeko. :)<br />True, this movie bears no resemblance to historical fact. But ignore that and watch the story. There is a powerful message about the dangers of prejudice. The song Savages always chills me to the bone. Here are two cultures so bent on anger they cannot see how alike they are. And we, the audience, see how incredibly alike they are as they prepare for battle. I am constantly reminded of this song, and, I'm sad to say, have fallen victim to preconcieved notions myself. This movie was very fundamental to helping me view people as people. I believe this is a film children should see for it's gentle message of tolerance.
B0026GBIB6|3.0|Like many DM fans, I awaited \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" with great anticipation.  It is generally a mistake to judge a new DM album immediately (it took me several listens to really 'get' Songs of Faith and Devotion), so I gave SOTU a few go rounds first.  That now done, I feel ready to make my opinion known.  Overall, I feel SOTU does not have the punch and life of the previous release, \\"Playing the Angel\\", but it does have it's highlights.<br /><br />Much has been made of DM's use of retro synthesizers on SOTU, and while the album does have a retro feel to it, the production techniques and vocals are purely modern.  Martin Gore's guitar work is first rate, and he and Dave Gahan's vocal work have never sounded better.  I would dare say this is Dave's best-he even chimes in with some pretty good falsetto stuff.  It looks to me like Dave's confidence is high following up his fine solo album \\"Hourglass\\" (which I think is better than this album, by the way).<br /><br />As for the individual songs, my favorite is \\"In Sympathy\\", which is an understated rhythm/synth marriage along with an excellent vocal performance by Dave.  \\"Peace\\" is the most retro song on the album, and would probably have been right at home on \\"Construction Time Again\\" right next to \\"2 Minute Warning\\" and \\"Everything Counts.\\"  The other songs are good, but lack the gritty, dark edge that has set DM apart from  other electronic bands over the years.  I've only been a lukewarm fan at best of most of Martin's ballads, so I tend to set those at the end of any DM playlist.<br /><br />In summary, I have to say that SOTU lacks the energy of my favorite DM albums such as Violator, Songs of Faith and Devotion, Ultra, Music for the Masses, and Playing the Angel.  While I don't fault the fellows for going in a different direction, I have always been a devotee of their uptempo, high energy music, and SOTU is bit soft in that department-it could have used a song like Dave's \\"Kingdom\\", or \\"A Little Lie.\\" I guess I'll just have to settle for \\"Wrong\\".r \\"Wrong\\".

B001DHXT1G|4.0|This sequel contains a story line, action, special effects and yes, even acting that were non-existent  in the original. I was reluctant to even watch this sequel, I was so bored with the original. I think it's the first sequel ever made that is the same title as the original. Not a remake, a whole new story albeit a continuation. The best part of the original Spiderman was how he was created in the original. Not so with The Hulk, the original seemed to take forever before he came into being. Edward Norton performs seamlessly as the Hulk transforms into itself. Bravo!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I heard about this show and Joss Whedon for a long time while listening to different podcasts like Twit and Buzz out Loud.  They would mention Joss and how amazing his writing is, and every once in a while I would hear \\"Firefly\\".  I recently finished grad school and have gotten more into watching shows.  I got addicted to X-files in '05 after watching it on and off for years.  I compare most shows to that.  So I picked up firefly while on sale on a whim.  By the last episode I was in a deep depression knowing that there wasn't going to be anymore.  I in fact didn't want to watch the last one for a while because I knew it would be over at that point (my girlfriend convinced me to go ahead and watch).  This show is amazing.  Every time I catch a glimpse of American Idle or some other terrible show I am outraged.  How Firefly got cancelled is beyond me.  But then again, most people on the decision level of showbiz are incredibly out of touch with what people want.  Example: look into how long it took Linkoln Park to get a record deal, and how many labels turned them down.  Once they got singed, they won every music award imaginable.  Many people lost their jobs over that one....    I have shown and discussed Firefly with everyone I know and once they sit down and watch, they get it.  This show is/was genious.  Many people can't look past the 'space ship' aspect.  But that is not what the show is about.  It is far more than sci fi.  Buy it, watch it, period.  Buy it 5 times to show the people in control that this show needs to be brought back, or at least another movie needs to be made!    ....And watch Castle to support Nathan Fillion!  It's like watching captain Mal go back in time!
B001NFNFNU|4.0|This particular film is hard to review mainly due to the fact that there are so many other reviews on here. But at the same time it's so hard not to review because of what an outstanding movie this turned out to be. I had a small amount of information on The Changeling before watching it. I knew that being directed by Clint Eastwood it had to be good or even great. He is a wonderful and talented director and has a vision for capturing the realism of life in a film. I was a little skeptical about Angelina Jolie being the main character. She gave a solid performance and had my heart aching for her the entire time. Some individuals say that they were sick of her crying in the movie and that she wasn't emotional enough to make them believe she had just lost her son. I do have to make a quick comment on that. First of all this was based in the 1920's when women had pretty much no say in the real world at all. They were made to show no emotion and pretty much keep their mouth shut at all times. So I think Angelina did superb at playing a 1920's mother. And yes she cried a lot, but tell me what mother wouldn't cry all the time if their son got kidnapped. Some of the pungent remarks people made are just so ridiculous and absurd that I had to say something to defend the film. I know everyone has their own opinion but atleast know what you're talking about when you put down a movie. The story telling was the most amazing part. Being based on a true story it is hard to imagine our world being so full of corruption and monstrous human beings. Everyone in the film played their part very well. And of course Clint Eastwood did outstanding as a director. The only thing lacking was how little you get to see the mother bonding with her child in the beginning. It's hard to fathom how strong their bond really was when you never get to see it happen for yourself. I know it may seem like a small problem and that I am just picking at the film. But that's not the case I love the movie. The problem is actually kind of big when the whole story is based on a mothers love for her child. We know that she loves her son very much, it just would have made the film have an even more powerful effect to see the process happen.<br /><br /> This is based on a true story of a mother in the 1920's desperate to find her son when he goes missing one evening. Can she survive the antagonistic police force while still clinging on to hope for her son?. In this gripping tale you find out the true bond a mother has for her son by the extensive lengths she will go through for him and how strong a woman can really be when she is faced with more than a few horrible challenges. How never giving up can be one of the hardest things in life to face.<br /><br /> The Changeling will have a strong hold on your heart and soul the entire way through. It is more than sad and yet happiness somehow seems to prevail. I highly recommend this as a must see film for the people that like dramatic, horror, great acting, well directed and well written movies.e problem is actually kind of big when the whole story is based on a mothers love for her child.

B00133KFGW|1.0|The only person who could enjoy this film would be someone who could completely suspend all belief in reality. The story is so far fetched that it is laughable. It draws from various sources not least of which is Oliver Twist, with Robin Williams in the role of Fagin. I have read some of the reviews which praise the film and I am frankly amazed. I have seen worse films but am struggling to name them !!!!

I looked to Amazon for a quick replacement, as I was partially through the book and wanted to read the rest.    I found this copy of the book for a REDICULOUSLY low price and thought 'I just need a copy to finish the read, so I will get it no matter the condition.'    What I got instead was an older publish of the same book BUT it a hardback WITH a protector sleeve on it and in immaculate condition.      WOW was I pleasantly surprised I now own a beautiful book that I am proud to display in my bookshelf in the living room.
B0013TTLDE|2.0|This looked like it would be my kind of book, but it was very disappointing!  I could not get into it.  There are too many wonderful books out there to waste time on a so-so one.  Read \\"The Help\\" instead.
0803731094|5.0|Julia Donaldson has written two books about the Gruffalo, this one and the Gruffalo's Child, and they are imaginative, funny and gorgeously illustrated.    Donaldson does excellent rhymes which are great for early literacy and the appealing pictures will draw your child in. A mouse sets out for a walk in the deep dark woods - on the way a fox, an owl and a snake try to eat him, but he tells each of them that is fine, but he is going to have lunch with a Gruffalo. Each in turn run away scared = we all think the Gruffalo is a myth - until we MEET the Gruffalo - who wants to eat the Mouse too!    The Cunning mouse outwits the Gruffalo just as it outwitted the other creatures!     Very nice, very fun. Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler have combined to write and illustrate several other children's books including Tiddler, Room on the Broom, The Gruffalo's Child, the Whale and the Snail. They are wonderful imaginative and beautifully written books which you and your children with love.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|This CD is a delight!  Cohen's deep gravelly voice and gentle demeanor are showcased by highly talented musicians and singers.  The only thing that is a bit disappointing is the softness of his spoken comments between songs.  This is most noticeable when I listen while driving.  At home it is no problem.

0307278255|4.0|A big fan of the \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\", I couldn't wait for the release of this book. Again, Lahiri explores the lives of the Indian and Indian-American communities with an enlightening eye. Centered on the theme of regret, the stories are poignant, moving me to the point of tears with the first story in the collection.    \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" has a more modern and contemporary feel in comparison to the \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\". Written simply, although it was easy to read, the words pack a lot of punch. I find \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" to be less poetic than the \\"Interpreter\\", but is nevertheless a great read!
0375842209|5.0|I (and my book club members) all thoroughly enjoyed this book and the ensuing discussion - one of the best discussions we've had.  I would heartily endorse this book for all - book clubs and solo readers - it's a wonderful experience, not to be missed.  I wish I had a better way with words to express how much I enjoyed this!
0316143472|5.0|i haven't read a book this funny and engaging in a long time.  laughed out loud every other page!  hysterical.
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn was beautifully written. In it a surprise happens that may not be for the better, and just when the problem gets solved, another pops up. You'll love it!  The only thing I did not like was the ending of the book. It reminded me of one off those \\"and they all live happily ever after\\" endings.  Also *(SPOILERS AHEAD!)*  Some of Jacobs thoughts were a little weird and hard to understand, and at the time when Bella gives birth to Renessmee, the scene is very gory and if you have a weak stomach, you might throw up.  Other then that, I loved the book. Thumbs up to Stephanie Meyers!

B0018BB20W|5.0|I was impressed with the quality of this product and would recomend it to any Moody Blues Fan (although, if you're a fan, you probably already own it.)  The melody mixture was fantastic!
0316067601|5.0|This book is so powerful, the story is so inspirational and tragic. It's about a Navy SEAL that fights in the Afghan mountains and has to deal with tragedy and his fight for survival.    It gives you a look at his life before he was a SEAL, during his training and after he was deployed into combat.    I've read several books about SEAL, Delta, SAS, SBS and other special forces, but this book right here is in the top 3. It is well written, easy to read and keeps you on the edge.
B001TH16DI|1.0|As soon as the movies are all restored, with all the extras available, at a reasonable price (say $10-13 a movie in a large set) I will buy. Not until then.  Fool me once....
1439102813|5.0|I have just completed reading Still Alice in one sitting.  I am speechless.  This book was so beautifully written about how it might feel to have alzheimers.  To know you identify is being taken from you.  My mother has alzheimers and I see the essence of who she is fading like an old photograph.  I have often wondered what she is feeling and now I feel like I know.

B001PA0FFO|4.0|I enjoyed Meryl Streep's performance immensely.  There were a few surprises but the subject itself poised discussion on multiple levels.  This is worth watching!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love Castle and can't wait to get the whole season so I can watch it over and over again!  The show is witty, intelligent and sexy!
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|This is the definitive music to accompany one of the best movies ever made. Dream like, it evokes the futuristic aspects of the film and is both relaxing and stimulating to the senses.
B001N18HOQ|5.0|When Grunge was king, the two bands that I followed were Pearl Jam and Soundgarden.  I did not care for neither Nirvana nor Alice In Chains as I considered them both to be too loud.  The album from that era that made a deep impression on me would had to have been the debut album by Pearl Jam called Ten.  I listened to that album both day and night!  To say it was a brilliant album would be a huge understatement!  As Grunge began to fade away from television and radio, I moved on, as well.  When I heard that Ten would be reissued, I considered checking it out for myself.  I am thrilled that I made the wise decision to purchase it!  The vocals and guitars are loud and clear and the power behind the songs are stronger than ever!  I am ashamed to say that I had forgotten what a passionate voice Eddie Vedder had and what an excellent group of musicians Pearl Jam were!  Now, once again, I am listening to Pearl Jam, one of the best bands to come out of my generation(x)!
0061689246|3.0|I got it in a very short time, however, it had some ripped pages at the end including the back cover of the book. it also kinda seemed like it had been in water and then dried out. that hard wavy paper kind of texture.<br /><br />Good book tho, and I can read it just fine without real troubles.
0780626494|5.0|Fast delivery, DVD was new.  I will be ordering more DVD's from Amazon when they get the titles I am looking for.
B001FB4W0C|4.0|The point is yes, I am a fan and will buy this set when a release date is announced. The problem is this the item is not even available, heck the season is not even finished broadcasting and here we have all these fabulous reviews. I have to call shenanigans here, how can a dvd set of an entire season be reviewed when the season is not over and the dvd set does not have a release date?????????????????????????? Again great show, great season so far......but its not even finished.     I can't offer a valid review of the DVDs because I OWN, the Blu Ray set, and by video quality alone I know I would give it at least 1 less star. Key word is product review, not show review.
0385340990|4.0|Again I was enlightened about WW II history, even though<br />there were some sad moments--the story teller was able<br />to find humorous tales to lightened the book.  I enjoyed the book, and recommend it to anyone with an interest in these times of our history.
0452289963|5.0|Each chapter is better than the next. With zero arrogance, Eckhart Tolle suggests simple to understand ways of becoming one with life. I don't think that this book is for any particular religion and therefore some comments others have made in their reviews are moot as IMHO this is not about changing your faith, but rather, changing your entrapment with the ego. I would recommend this book to anyone as it is truly words for the soul. It has helped change my quality of life for the better.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This is a great little sweeper for light cleaning. It works good on hardwood floors as well as carpet.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I was very excited when this movie came out as I grew up during the sixties. I was worried about the new interpretations of the Beatles songs but what a surprise! Not only was the movie great but I loved all the songs. My 19 yr old daughter & I watched the movie together the first time & I was able to give her a lot of the background & references that she wouldn't have picked up on otherwise. Bono channeling Ken Kesey with the Merry Pranksters meeting Timothy Leary was great! Joe Cocker was amazing as always. All the young talent brought a fresh sound too old favorites. The great response to the movie & soundtrack proves that the Beatles are truly for all generations.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|I'm not going to give a detailed view of each song as I feel others have covered that well.   Before I purchased this CD, I listened to samples and thought it sounded good for the most part...so I bought it.   Overall, I'm pretty pleased with it. I will say that, IMO, their first 3 cd's are better. But hey, if you're a Coldplay fan, you got to have this one...no question.   I was slightly dissappointed with the song '42' and that's one reason I only gave this a 4 star rating. This song starts off as a beautiful ballad type piece and then turns into some noisy frickin mess. It's almost like they started a whole different song. IMO, they should've just stayed with the ballad feel through the whole song. There was no reason to go into overdrive on this song. It's almost like they said \\"oh, we can't let this get too soft...let's hammer the damn thing.\\"  On the other hand, I do like it when they give their more upbeat songs a softer ending.   Even though they sometimes hint a similarity, I dislike the fact that they are too often compared to U2. I don't see/hear the U2/Coldplay connection like others do.    One more thing: I wish these artists would stop using those damn cardboard sleeves to package their cd's.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|It was an amazing movie, and Brad Pitt has never looked so good. Only drawback was the duration. I will be buying this movie the first day it is available.
0385495323|5.0|In the Code Book, Simon Singh takes us on a fascinating journey through cryptography from ancient Egypt to to the modern. He touches on many historical figures and their contributions to modern day cryptography. Personalities such as: Charles Babbage (the grandfather of computing), Alan Turing (creator of the Turing Machine, the father of modern computer science), Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leon Adleman (the men behind RSA encryption), and Phil Zimmermann.<br /><br />This book was enlightening as it put the cryptography mechanisms we employ today into a historical context while describing their complex inner workings and presenting the rich history that lies behind all innovation. Like other reviewers, I was also disappointed that the book came to a close so soon. I'm looking forward to reading Singh's other books.

B001N26GHU|2.0|Ordered this album and received a record with a different artist on side b then reordered it again and received a copy of the 2nd vinyl imprinted at an unplayable speed... gave up trying to find a working copy of the vinyl.<br /><br />About the album itself, it's a moderately good Boss album, you can definitely tell it's basically b-sides from the Magic sessions, a little disappointing.
1591841216|5.0|Every creative should own a couple Ardens. They're fun, inspirational, and interesting. Great for bus rides or breaking a mental block.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This is the first of many seasons ( We hope) for Castle. The show it's self is wonderful, the banter the chemistry between Stana Katic and Nathan Fillion just keeps getting better.
B001N26GFM|4.0|The movie started out boring but got more interesting as it got into the movie. The end was surprising and shocking. An excellent movie to watch again.
B000000HVE|4.0|This is a great album by a great band and it's sad they didn't make more music like this, but be aware. The description says Audio CD...it is actually a Vinyl Album record.  I kept it anyway, because I love the record but the description still hasn't been corrected to show what you will actually be receiving.
B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles' White Album was unique.  It was a double album with a diversity of sound.  The Beatles were experimenting as indicated by \\"Revolution 9.\\"  While some tracks seem decidedly tongue-in-cheek like the swagger on \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" or \\"Piggies,\\" some of these songs remain classic and the set wears well over 40 years after it was released.  From the line, \\"Let me hear your balalaika's ringing out, come & keep your comrade warm\\" in \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.,\\" you know you may hear anything on this disc.  George Harrison wrote one of his finest melodies and plays passionately on the lovely \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" \\"I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping.\\"  It's hard not to look at the turbulence in the world and not hear this speaking directly to us.  Harrison's \\"Savoy Truffle\\" on the second disc also remains one of my favorites.  \\"Dear Prudence\\" strikes me as a beautiful and unique melody as does the sweet \\"I Will\\" and Lennon's \\"Julia.\\"  The darker rockers like \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun,\\" \\"Yer Blues\\" or \\"Helter Skelter\\" still amaze me, sounding fresh.  The White Album varies sounds and allows the band to explore and stretch, one of the most interesting and provocative of the Beatles' sets.  Enjoy!
1433502410|5.0|This book is a thorough coverage of the Bible and has good study notes. There is a extensive resource in the back of the book and gives good cross references for all the key passages in both the Old and New Testaments. The maps section has many different entries that show empires and specific routes of many of the main patriarchs and the spread of Christianity.   In addition there is an online access that can be used to implement the text.  Well worth the money and time.
B000FC2FVA|4.0|\\"It's Never Been Like That\\" is my introduction to this French band, who sing quite well in English by the way.  Singer Justin Thompson whose jazz gem [[ASIN:B000IFSL8U Brand New Same Old Obsessions]] totally knocked me out said this was one of his favorite bands, which brought me to it.  I can certainly see the attraction.  The music is original and bubbles with a classic feeling.  \\"Rally\\" keeps varying the pace from the verse to bridge to the delightful chorus, \\"Don't you give me those shifty eyes, pay attention, dirty talk talk talk, quiet.\\"  \\"Long Distance Call\\" crosscuts a lovely melody with the repetition of the lyric that becomes title to the set.  \\"Courtesy Laughs,\\" the instrumental \\"North\\" & \\"Sometimes in the Fall\\" are also favorite cuts.  Phoenix's delightful pop is original and sets a chronic smile on my face.  Enjoy!
B001DDBCUK|4.0|I've watched this twice now, the first time I didn't like it as much and then I watched it again and it was very funny, the girls have great love for each other.  The sex scenes are taseful and very enjoying.
B001PJRAUS|1.0|I am a die hard Austen fan and currently getting my master's in British Literature.  My fiance knows and accepts my love for Mr Darcy.  I am also a huge fan of all the sequels that have come out about what happens after Elizabeth and Darcy wed.  With that said, I was honestly very excited when this movie came out to see what sort of variation this had taken on.  I really cannot express my level of disdain and discontentment when this movie ended.  I'm sorry, but changing the ending of Pride and Prejudice is unforgivable.  It wasn't the director or producers right to take away Elizabeth and Darcy's happy ending in favor of a stupid main character that the viewer wishes would disappear the entire movie.  Kudos to the supporting cast who did their best to act successfully around such a weak lead.  Please don't waste your time or energy (or money for that  matter) watching this video.  If you truly love Austen, pick up a copy of your favorite novel of hers instead.  It's time much better spent.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie is very powerful. It is almost a sure fire way to make sure that you never do drugs, it's that good. It also has phenomanal acting and directing. Seriously see this.
0061148512|4.0|With the seas of collective enigma and awe that surrounds Sylvia Plath, this   first and last novel of hers flows like that sea itself. 'The Bell Jar' starts off with a taste you can almost feel tingling on the tip of your tongue. That taste is hollowness.      As Esther Greenwood tries to have that time of her life she thought she would getting this chance of a lifetime, she begins to experience an emptiness of sorts which, clearly, lies beyond words.      Even as one reads the sentence after sentence, one is pulled in between those blank spaces to a world so completely black. As Esther describes the beginning of her breakdown, you begin to almost hear Sylvia Plath whispering the written words so ominously in your ears - whether you know how she sounds or not.      For years Plath enchanted people with her poetry, but she knew she could manage more than that. With 'The Bell Jar' Miss Sylvia certainly manages MUCH more. Beautiful descriptions, believable, enriching dialogue, and a story that will resonate in the core of your heart forever.     Some part of this book are so eerily haunting that you feel the pain Esther, and likely Miss Sylvia, must have felt. The hurting sometimes is so deep that you begin to wonder what it really would be like to be trapped in such a prison. Of course, those who already feel this melancholy - like myself - will be more than attracted to this book as it   can become like a shared secret between the reader and the character.     What also pleases me is this is a first-person narrative. The book is supposed to describe a 'crack-up' of sorts but the way Esther talks of what is slowly creeping into her, you can see that she is not 'crazy' at all but a human being at the end of the day.      That personal, private touch to 'The Bell Jar' is a definite part in the success of this book. One is left to wonder what Sylvia Plath, a woman with such great words sprouting from the depths of her mind, could have written in the lost years of a lifeshe chose to end.
0743487583|5.0|This edition is full of good (though simple) notes on symbol, characters, themes, etc whether you are reading on your own or for class. Highly recommend especially for the price. Great for a class set. I ordered for students at school. It is the 1818 version, which I like better in a lot of ways, but may not be the same as your school's library if that is a concern. I like the three volumes and fewer hints \\"you will laugh at my allusion\\" (1832) in the 1818 verses some of the over editing in the 1832. I will switch to the $2 copy from Thrift because it is the 1832 and most students borrow or buy that one, so the class will have the same language.[[ASIN:0486282112 Frankenstein (Dover Thrift Editions)]] Though it has no dedication page (INSTUMENTAL in understanding her work!) or notes- they have me in class.
B000002UAO|5.0|It took me a while to buy this album. To tell you the truth, it wasn't a high priority getting it. Unfortunately, it looks like I should have waited a little bit longer...remastered studio albums by the band are coming out in September of this year!      There are some Beatles albums whose reputation precedes them, like \\"Sgt.Pepper\\". Listening to that album, after often reading that critics view it as the greatest album of all time, you cannot but help be bitterly disappointed by the lack of a great track list. In those Rolling Stone magazine lists years ago, of the greatest albums of all time, you'd get the critic who I assumed was trying to be different by voting an album like \\"Rubber Soul\\" or \\"Revolver\\" as the greatest album of all time. Well, now I suppose I have to join their ranks as greater admirers of Rubber Soul than of Sgt. Pepper (however, I rank Magical Mystery Tour as the band's greatest album). \\"White\\" is an album that I think fans of the band over-rate (I review White and Magical Mystery Tour at this site).       Anyway, the motivation for finally buying Rubber Soul was that I am currently running a poll on the top 3 Beatles albums of all time. I knew that I would have Magical Mystery Tour in my top spot, but didn't feel it fair to vote for 2nd and 3rd position without listening to some more albums that are thought of as great, apart from Sgt.Pepper and White, which I'd listened to.        Having listened to Rubber Soul, I'd say that it is my pick as their second greatest album, after Magical Mystery Tour, of the ones I've listened to now (recently listened to Revolver and Abbey Road). Here's why:    The best songs on the album:    Drive my car - a catchy, smart-alecky song, with a funky bass and piano. Features a cow bell or some such instrument too. This is a song which I think is worthy of inclusion in a \\"Best Of\\" compilation...the Red or Blue double cd compilation has it, fortunately.     Norwegian wood - has that disappointing 'faux stereo'effect which you get on early Beatles albums (due to mono recordings being the standard of the day), with the vocals being biased to the right hand speaker. Has accoustic guitar on both speakers and their melody is catchy. Another contender for a \\"Best Of\\" compilation-like the song above, this appears on their \\"Red\\" double cd compilation.     Nowhere man - another reflective song by the band. I'd couple this song with \\"Fool on the hill\\". Both have the sense of someone-an outsider-contemplating life's passing parade.    In my life - more pretty, reflective lyrics. Pleasant, gentle song. Nice guitar melody, and a lovely harpsichord lick in the middle of the song. Maybe a Bachian type harpsichord melody?    Michelle - a genteel song by McCartney. He occasionally speaks French on it. Pleasantly gentle drumming, accoustic guitar with electric guitar coming in later. Features early 50's style backing vocals. A love song.    Girl - strikes me as a European style traditional folk song (but what would I know?!). Features some unusual sounding instruments...not sure, maybe Russian or Greek equivalents to the guitar? I like Lennon's overwrought emoting in this song too!    I'm looking through you - made a note that the intro to this song reminded me of the Travelling Wilbury's song \\"End of the line\\", a band which featured Beatle George Harrison. Features a steel string accousting guitar. Nice hand clapping bit in the song. The song has a rock part which features electric guitar and keyboard.    Those were the songs I found worthy of highlighting in this review of mine. Listening to this album last night, for the 3rd time, after not having listened to it for a few weeks, I  have to say that maybe a song like \\"The word\\" deserves a special mention. It's catchy, about changing attitudes towards love, is sort of bluesy/funky in feel. Has nice variations in the vocals. Before listening to the album again last night, I had written that \\"You won't see me\\" was catchy. Not sure I find it as catchy now, as I find \\"The word\\".     This album is also noteable for George Harrison's able song writing contributions: \\"Think for yourself\\" which is, you guessed it, 'catchy'! His other contribution is the nice, light and airy pop song \\"If I needed someone\\". A downside of the Beatles disintegration was that George Harrison didn't release more good songs which he wrote, by the band. Of course, Harrison still had more albums with The Beatles to write even better songs, before embarking on a note-worthy solo career.       Lastly, I must mention two songs: Ringo Starr singing the country flavoured \\"What goes on\\" and the last track, \\"Run for your life\\". That last song is quite a bomb-shell, lyrically speaking, I think. It has a Bob Dylan type introduction (there is a photo of The Beatles holding Bob Dylan's album \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\". That's an album I've reviewed here and highly recommend...it's Dylan's best album, I think). \\"Run for your life is a jaunty song, but with VERY disturbing lyrics...highly menacing sentiment behind them. I would couple that song with an equally weird Beatles' song called \\"Maxwell's silver hammer\\" off of their \\"Abbey Road\\" album.    An excellent album. It really puts Sgt.Pepper and White in the shade. Deservedly so.
B001CTDH76|5.0|Lately we've been bombarded with alot of new shows. It's hard not to like alot of them with all the technology that is available as apposed to the 70's and 80's when we had to put up with corny writing and shoddy effects. Still, they bring back the nostalgia, that we crave so bad ! Well nowadays we have alot better writing and ALOT better effects, this show has some of both. my wife and I and even our teenage daughters love it. Soon as it comes out we will be buying it. Simon Baker is a great talant and was a superb choice to play the guy that all the guys wish they were and all the woman kinda wish they were with. admit it! Watch a couple of episodes and you'll be hooked too!!!   p.s....Cho, is another great charactor ! Greatly portrayed by Tim Kang, kinda reminds us a little of Joe Friday maybe ? Anyway, ENJOY !
B0000X61UU|5.0|Had this workout video many years ago, so glad I was able to find it again. Was just as good as I remember. Great for abs and legs!
B001UREJWM|4.0|I tend to agree with some reviewers that most of the songs tend to sound more like Dio's solo band than with the Sabbath Dio Years, especially with the more recent ones (Magica, Master Of The Moon). But it's not a bad thing overall and it could sound like the more recent Sabbath albuns (eg. Forbidden, Tyr, and so on). That would be horrible...    This album is more doom than the 3 albums Dio sang, not so fast and quite dense sometimes. But it's a very solid album. For me Bible Black and Eating the Cannibals are the best songs. The first shows an updated Iommi classic riff, very heavy and the second has a NWOBHM feel and one which could be in Mob Rules. Double The Pain, The Turn Of The Screw, Atom & Evil and Follow The Tears are also very good songs.     It's also a very consistent disc with no bad apple in it, just very good classic metal made by one of the most classic formations of all time. There are a lot of reunion albums out there that do not sound as good as this one (Kiss and Judas come to my mind).    It grows into you with time. One tip I give is to listen to it with eyes closed and earplugs. Still, I am not sure whether I name any song here as a Sabbath classic song. Perhaps what lacked for me to rate it 5 stars and a classic was more Mob Rules and less Magica...

1400108608|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this book.  I aquired the audiobook version from audible and listened to it in my car with my seven year old son.  I really didn't expect for him to like it and though he never seemed to pay attention to it - however he always knew what was going on and was quite upset that the ending didn't play out the way he wanted.  Apparently my little 7 year old boy who revels in dirt and climbing trees is a closet romantic and expected a wedding - no matter that the characters were a bit too young to get married.<br /><br />The short summary - We follow the March family, 4 dutiful daughters and their mother through the period of time that their father is away at war (I believe he's a chaplain).  They befriend their neighbors and go through several trials, all learning to be better people through it all.<br /><br />It doesn't sound very exciting does it?  Well it's not exciting in the shootem up explosion type way - but it is very engaging and endearing.  Many people argue that this book has lost it's luster since the girls spend time sewing, studying and functioning in rather \\"old fashioned\\" ways.  Some have even complained of the overtly religious overtones.  I personally though it was a wonderful story of four young girls learning each in their own way - that life can be hard, life can be heartbreaking, death is very real, but then so is love, friendship and joy.  Some argue that Mrs. March is an unattainable visiage of a \\"perfect mother\\" however I argue that we see her only through her daughters' eyes - and that every mother is on a pedestal in the eyes of their daughters.  We don't know if the moments when she is out of site, she is sobbing at her loneliness or having bouts of internal rage at the behavior of her children.  She simply projects and outward calm, which most mothers attempt to keep in front of their children.<br /><br />There is a certain beauty to this story, each of the girls has their own personal battle to fight within themselves and we watch as they find ways to overcome, either their envy, their vanity, their selfishness - some turn to friendship, others to prayer.  I have to admit that I too had hoped for the ending that my little son wanted - even though I knew it was silly to wish for two young people to end up together, but who knows what the future holds for them after the last page of the book.<br /><br />The simple fact that a little seven year old ADHD boy was able to love and care about the people in this story, and to have hopes for them - shows the power of the writing contained within.  I highly recommend this book - even to those who are not into \\"romance\\" or \\"period literature.\\"s they find ways to overcome, either their envy, their vanity, their selfishness - some turn to friendship, others to prayer.

B0002OERI0|4.0|I don't love every song on this CD, but there are some really good ones on it.  I like some of the songs that you don't hear on the radio more than the ones that are played on it.  I mainly bought this CD for Jesus of Suburbia, that is one of my all time favorite songs.

0946535256|3.0|When I placed my order for this product, I noticed later that I was charged for two books and 2 CDs. Although I was pretty sure I had only ordered one, I thought maybe I could have hit the order button twice. So, I canceled and then reordered the book/CD set. But, they still sent, and charged me for, two. While I doubt this is anything more than a technical glitch, Amazon did not respond to a note I sent about the problem and sent me both books anyway. So, beware of this if you do order it. See that they have fixed this bug before doing so.     Also, I ordered a lot of trumpet and jazz books. Many of the books were very late in coming, much later than my previous orders. I am still waiting for one product. I understand that because I live overseas my shipment should take longer. But, these took much longer than usual and they split the order into several shipments. One item has still not been sent. Again, this is a reflection on Amazon's service and not the product itself.    If you want to learn the trumpet from the jazz context right away, this book would be good for you. Many jazz for trumpet books require you to already be fairly proficient on the trumpet and be able to read music. This one does not. It is for the beginner. Right after you finish the preliminaries you start learning to play blues and jazz tunes. You learn about the basics of the trumpet, music reading, jazz tunes and legendary jazz players all together. The attached CD allows you to check to make sure you are sounding right and the book includes some classic jazz tunes like Thelonious Monk's \\"Blue Monk\\" and Dizzy Gillespie's \\"A Night in Tunisia\\". Also, it is not a massive book, just over a hundred pages. So, even the size makes it inviting to beginner's.     In the end, I was certainly happy with the book and CD. I considered the price for one set very reasonable, but was quite irritated that I was forced to buy two. Now, I need to find a beginning trumpet player interested in jazz and make hisday with an unexpected present.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|This film won several Oscars and deserved them all.  It is a unique masterpiece that grabs the viewer on several levels: the story, the setting, the acting and the cinematography.  SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is the story of how Jamal, a young, uneducated man, from India's lowliest slums, working in the most menial of jobs, achieves unprecedented success as a contestant on \\"Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?\\" It seems impossible to believe that he would have the kind of knowledge to answer a wide assortment of questions that clearly would appear to be outside his scope of experience.  But therein lies the brilliance of the film: how he knows the answers to each question is woven into the fabric of his life's experiences and told in flashback.    Orphaned at a very young age when their mother is brutally murdered, Jamal and his older brother Salim, survive amidst trash dumps. Their lives are brutally harsh and made more so when they become ensnared by a professional gang of beggars, and later when they do what they must to eke out a living.  Yet in each vignette of their lives something occurs that provides Jamal with the critical knowledge he uses later on the TV program.  Threaded throughout his story is his undying passion for a little orphan girl, Latika, who he repeatedly loses and then finds only to lose her again.    This is a story of the triumph of the human spirit.  No matter how battered down and hopeless life appears, Jamal never gives up. An unforgettable movie that has already become an \\"essential\\".
0439023483|5.0|So while I was looking for Edward's story on Stephenie Meyer's website. I noticed she recommended this book. I bought it about 3 weeks ago several months after I seen her recommendation. I started reading it 2 nights ago, and could only put it down to go to work. I finished the book about 10 minutes ago and I was so sad to find out that book 2 is not out...I want to know the rest...I'm a Huge fan of the Twilight Series and I think this series will follow in it's footsteps. Suzanne Collins is an excellent writer that knows how to capture your attention...I'm so glad I read that recommendation. I can't wait to share this book with someone else.
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|Before I saw this film I wondered about the strange title: Vicky, Cristina Barcelona.  The title refers to two young American women, Vicki (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johanssen), lifelong friends who travel together to Barcelona to spend a summer of discovery.  Vicki, engaged to a straight as an arrow, tightly controlled young corporate executive, is a graduate student researching \\"Catalan Identity\\". Cristina, more free-wheeling and open to life's opportunities, is in search of adventure and her own identity.      They meet an uninhibited, passionate artist (Javier Bardem), who ultimately seduces them both and exposes them to a culture, lifestyle and thinking that has profound impacts on their lives and dreams.  Penelope Cruz as the artist's ex-wife, Maria Elena, is exceptional as an artist driven by wild passionate moods, unable to live with or without her ex-husband.    Like most of Woody Allen's films, this is a story about angst, insecurity and relationships.  It is one of his best and the background of Barcelona is magnificent.  Oddly, all the women reminded me of different aspects of Mia Farrow, Woody's ex-wife and muse who starred in so many of his films.  I could almost see or hear her in each female role.    One of the things I enjoyed most about this film was the narration.  Allen has used this technique successfully before and it enhanced this film as well. It is as though someone is reading a story to you, yet the Director is providing the necessary visual images.  This is neither a happy or sad film but rather a realistic view and acceptance of life without rose colored glasses.
B0012GN260|3.0|I'm being generous when I give it three stars.  I'm a huge fan of Bruce Dickinson, both his work with Iron Maiden and his solo work so I felt like I had to give him at least a passing grade.    Born in 58 and Tattooed Millionaire are both catchy tunes, though simple ones that sound like they were written in a single evening.  Can't say the rest of the stuff is much to speak of, so I won't.    I've owned this CD for 3 year and haven't listened to it in probably the last year so I guess I must not think it's too great.
0321525655|5.0|This book is so good that, to date, I've purchased over 30 copies as gifts for people with whom I work.  It's simple and its concepts and suggestions are easy to enact.  My copy has many tabbed pages and notes written in the margins.    Unexpectedly, it's also full of good tips for speaking and presenting.  Reading (and rereading) it will make you want to give a presentation.
B001PU8N0I|4.0|We really enjoyed the production, until the end of the story. The attempt to pull the plot together, to explain all the secrets and relationships, failed. As Mrs. Clennam and the Frenchman went back and forth with revelations of the past, the whole thing got confused. We watched and rewatched it and still couldn't figure out why Little Dorrit and Arthur were connected. The director dropped the ball and left us wondering what the whole story was all about.
B001PPLIEG|2.0|This is not a good Bond film. It is nothing remotely like Casino Royal and feels cheap. Craig is a great Bond and his rebel like status with M as his mother figure is excellent drama but there is simply a lack of any interesting pantomime bad guys or theatrical suspension of disbelief that was always the hallmark of a Bond movie. Instead the writers have decided to incorporate too much real world type scenarios to sterilize the franchise to compete with Jason Bourne. The air of high adventure and over the top missions is replaced by common as mud mobsters and spies that are cannon fodder for Bond to act emotionally tough around when they die. Not only is the story weak but the action is not well cut together. In the end this is a problem with story and direction. It is not a good Bond and can be relegated to some of the worse the series has to offer. It's a pity because Craig is a talent who is wasted and saves this film from one star. Craig is Bond but this film wasn't.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle has quickly become my new favorite show on TV, and one of the few shows I really look forward to watching every week.  Although action and drama are both there, for me the best part of the show is the humor.  The chemistry between Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic is great.  It's just a fun show!
0385337388|5.0|Though written some 30-plus years ago, this book is no less fascinating today than it was them.  Beautifully written by an author who clearly knew his subject matter.  Highly recommended.
031606792X|4.0|Book four and the finale to Stephenie Meyer's Twilight Saga is Breaking Dawn. We've learned a little bit about the Volturi, the leading Vampire coven, in each of the first three books. In Breaking Dawn, things finally come to a head with Jacob, Edward and Bella. Again, I might be a little vague to avoid giving too much away.<br /><br />As Bella and Edward take a new turn in their relationship, Jacob is left to his own self discovery until his heart is finally snatched away from him. As the three of them struggle to make the best out of the deranged circumstances they are put under, in the background the Volturi are planning a brutal take over. When your body and vengeance can live forever, a takeover can only mean one thing: death. Will Bella lose her true love? Her new family? What will Jacob risk to do what he feels is right?<br /><br />Breaking Dawn answers all of the questions that the tortured readers, waiting for the next book, asked about. Because of that, the book can at times seem rushed and out of sync with the rest of the series. I'm going to again give my personal opinion and say that I don't feel that the book was rushed at all. I think that in order to wrap up a fantastic saga, Meyer had to fit a lot of information in an infinitesimally small space between two covers. The way that she handles this in the book is absolutely fabulous!<br /><br />Fair warning - this book is different (but not out of sync) from the rest of the saga. I would have to say that Breaking Dawn pushes the Young Adult boundaries just a smidge.
0312370849|5.0|Tatiana deRosnay has given us one of the most beautifully constructed and heartfelt books I've ever had the pleasure (and pain) of reading.  Told in alternating chapters by Sarah in 1942 and Julia in 2002, this remarkable story is based on facts surrounding the role of France and its citizens during the Holocaust.  The country's unspeakable part in this tragedy is not a focal point for students, but this book should certainly be told and studied so that the horrible story of the Vel d'Hiv, the roundup of French citizens who were Jews, never has a chance to repeat itself.<br /><br />Sarah is ten years old when she hears the French police pounding on the door of her parents' Paris apartment.  She knew that her parents had been worried and that Papa had taken to sleeping in the basement, but nothing prepared her for the atrocities she was about to endure.  Always very protective of her four-year old brother, Michel, she starts to get him ready to go with the police as ordered, but he is terrified and wants to hide in their secret place.  Sarah agrees and locks him in the hidden cupboard, knowing he will be safe until she gets back to let him out.  She hides the key and goes with her parents.<br /><br />The reader can feel the sense of confusion and disbelief that overwhelms Sarah as she and her parents are transported to Drancy, a stopping point on the way to Auschwitz.  The author writes with deep sympathy of the indignities inflicted on Sarah and the haunting parting as she is torn from her mother.  Her one obsession is to get back to her apartment and let her brother out of the cupboard.<br /><br />In alternating chapters, we are privy to the story of Julia Jarmond, an American journalist now living in France and married to a man whose family is inextricably connected to the torture that Sarah endures.  Not in the way the reader might expect, but in a way that will finally explode after years of secrecy and leave the reader choked with grief as the words rip off the pages.<br /><br />The reader also gets to know Julia and her arrogant husband.  Her story revolves around her own disintegrating marriage being strangled by infidelity, her husband's insistence on her having an abortion, and, most importantly, her obsession with the story of the Vel d'Hiv and her tenacity in learning the rest of Sarah's story.<br /><br />Haunting and unforgettable, this is an intimate and totally captivating story of one of the darkest periods in French history, actually in World History.

B000002OX7|5.0|The first number on this album is awsome. Baba O'Riley is a unique song.  In the TV-series House it was given a new dimension.  Once again it proofs that music of the sixties is uncomparible.  I really love it!
B000VR824S|5.0|After a day of experiencing some of the best music we have ever had the privilege to hear played live, my good concert-buddy and I both agreed we could now die happy.  After all, who ever expected to hear those Blind Faith songs played live by Clapton and Winwood - and that was only the climax of the day!    But it got even better when I got my hands on these dvds.  I can put them in my player and relive that incredible event.  From Bill Murray's kooky charm as emcee to Clapton's bashfulness as B.B. King talked about his friend, the warmth and love we felt at the show is truly reproduced in this chronicle of the day.      There were so many wonderful musical moments:  Johnny Winter, who had to be led to his stool but proceeded to play his heart out; the larger-than-life Jeff Beck and his band, featuring the young and amazing Tal Wilkenfeld on bass; John Mayer (John Mayer?!) showing he can really play that guitar even as he gawked at all his idols; Derek Trucks, filling in for his namesake but making it all his own; and Mr. Clapton's evening show featuring, among others, Robbie Robertson, Trucks, Doyle Bramhall II, Buddy Guy and Mr. Winwood.  I realized I had been waiting most of my life to hear those songs ring out on that beautiful summer night.        I could go on, but I won't.  If you were lucky enough to be there, you know what I'm talking about.  If you couldn't get there, thank your lucky stars the dvd is available and order the darn thing!
6305718954|5.0|I saw this film years ago when it was first released and enjoyed it. I saw it again recently and enjoyed it even more the second time around. I had forgotten that the film was based upon the Gospel according to St. Thomas, a gospel that is not recognized by the Roman Catholic Church and is not included in the New Testament. The Gospel according to Thomas is not about the life of Jesus. Rather, it is about the things that Jesus said. There are one hundred and fourteen such sayings that have been translated. One of those sayings is at the heart of this film. \\"Split a piece of wood, and I am there. Lift up a stone and you will find me.\\"<br /><br />The film is about an investigative Jesuit  priest, a young atheist who suffers from the stigmata, and a conspiracy within the Roman Catholic Church to suppress a certain gospel, as if fears its destruction should that gospel become public. The investigative priest, Father Andrew Kiernan, is played with appropriate gravity by Gabriel Byrne, a serious man with a faith issue, as he is not just a man of the cloth, he is also a scientist with a degree in chemistry. He travels around the world investigating alleged miracles. The young atheist suffering from Stigmata is Frankie, a twenty-three year old hairdresser played with great sincerity by a young and nubile Patricia Arquette. Cardinal Houseman, the politically savvy church official seeking to suppress the perfidy of the Church, is played with zealous determination by Jonathan Pryce.<br /><br />I loved everything about this film. While there are elements of horror intertwined with its underlying intellectual theme, these two odd bedfellows merely make the film more interesting. I certainly did not find the juxtaposition of these two elements incompatible. The special effects do not overwhelm the film, but, instead, serve to enhance the experience of the viewer in understanding the film's themes and message. The film also boasts a wonderful soundtrack that meshes perfectly with the film and adds to its drama. Moreover, the film boasts stellar performances by its entire cast.<br /><br />This is a very entertaining film that is well worth having in one's personal film collection.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Watching Castle reminds me of watching Moonlighting - only it's a lot better. When I first heard Nathan Fillion was going to be in a weekly drama my first thought was...please don't cancel it or put it in in the middle of the night. Thankfully neither happened! YAY! When I actually read the synopsis for the TV show I was thrilled to see that he was a writer. Be still my heart!<br /><br />This show is wonderful. It's not gritty crime drama like the Law and Order shows, but the writing is great, the acting is wonderful, and the chemistry between Nathan and Stana Katic is amazing. I love how they pick at one another and how Kate is amazed that Castle can actually piece things together and get them right.<br /><br />The other aspect of the show that I really enjoy is the family dynamic. You've got single parent Richard Castle, his live in mother Martha (played by Susan Sullivan) and his daughter Alexis (Molly Quinn); Mom is quirky and likes to drink, and Alexis shows her rebellion by actually being a good kid. (Seriously, in the pilot she was doing homework at a party...and she goes to bed early on a school night!) Myself, I love watching Richard interact with his family. The bond between father and daughter is very obvious, and in a way Alexis reminds me of Nancy Drew - she's not out solving mysteries, but the back and forth she does with Castle at times sure makes it seem that she may grow up to be a detective some day.<br /><br />All in all I really love this show. It's well acted, well written and it's one of those shows that I miss once the episode is over.
B001FB4W0W|1.0|I love all things vampires but this was a gross show with no connection to any of the characters ! I can't connect with anybody on there so that's my opinion ! It looks good and sometimes I think it's going to be good but it just let's me down. I will try the second season.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This set provides the most incredible series of points of view I've ever seen.  20 years of National Geographic magazines have nothing on this show.  Watch this on the BIGGEST SCREEN POSSIBLE!  But make sure you don't eat too much before you see the bat poop surprise in \\"Caves,\\" or the cannibal monkeys in \\"Seasonal Forests.\\"  Otherwise, it's enjoyable for all ages.
B0000A36J1|5.0|Again the extended version adds to the story. This version helps the Lord Of The Rings along by adding back scenes that add to the storyline and help get it closer to the book. I have both the movie release and this one and I, by far, like this one best!
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|LOVE IT!  Absolutely a treasure to own.  With this concert DVD I got soooo much more then I had expected.  The music, instrumentals and impressionisms are outstandingly Leonard Cohen.  Well worth the few dollars I paid for it.  Better then front row seats at the actual concert![[ASIN:B001RTP3Z0 Live In London]]

B001RTP3YQ|4.0|After a 15 year absence from the stage, Leonard Cohen returned in 2008 to the stage in a wildely succesfull European tour. This live album catches Cohen at London's O2 Arena in July, and what a great show it is.<br /><br />\\"Leonard Cohen: Live In London\\" (2 CDs; 26 tracks; 157 min.) brings the show in all of its glory. The highlights are many, many, many, but just to point out a few: the opener \\"Dance Me To The End of Love\\", \\"The Future\\", \\"I'm Your Man\\", \\"First We Take Manhattan\\", \\"Ain't No Cure for Love\\", and the short a-capella closer \\"Whither Thou Goest\\", but truth be told, if you are a fan, there are no weak tracks on here. The audio quality is outstanding as well. If you have to make a choice between the CD set and the DVD of the same name, go for the DVD, in particular if you have the proper home-sound system setup. It is a pleasure to watch from a video-editing perspective. The camera focuses primarily on Leonard, although the rest of his backing band gets plenty of limelight too (in particular long-time back-up vocalist Jennifer Warnes) and thankfully, doesn't change every 2 or 3 seconds to a different perspective, as the MTV-generation has gotten used to.<br /><br />As to an alternative choice of a Cohen live album, avoid the mediocre 1973 \\"Live Songs\\" album, but instead seek out the excellent album \\"Field Commander Cohen\\", recorded during his 1979 \\"Recent Songs\\" tour and finally released in 2000. It frankly may even be better than the \\"Live in London\\" album, but that's just my own personal view.<br /><br />I had the great fortune of catching Leonard Cohen's set at Coachella a few weeks ago, and what a memorable event that was. He performed at 7:30 pm, just as the sun was setting, and with the eye-cathing background of palm trees and all the rest that is Coachella, it made for one truly memorable set. This CD set is a great momento for anyone who has had the great fortune of catching Leonard live in what is possibly his last tour. Not to be missed!
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|This is another good animated movie. Not quite as good an the first Final Fantasy movie, but close. It helps if you've ever played the Final Fantasy games, but even if you haven't, you should like this movie.
B001GKTDXS|5.0|In 2007 Kings of Leon released their monster-sized album \\"Because of the Times\\", which ended up in my personal top 3 of the best albums of 2007. After releasing \\"Because of the Times\\", the band toured non-stop around the Americas and Europe.<br /><br />\\"Only By the Night\\" (11 tracks; 43 min.) continues the trail-blazing ways of \\"Because of the Times\\", if possible even more so. The radio singles \\"Crawl\\" and \\"Sex on Fire\\" are quite good but also a bit misleading, in the sense that there are a lot of epic \\"atmospheric\\" songs, with plenty of walls of (guitar) sounds. This band has become now more than ever an arena-sized band. The highlights for me first single \\"Crawl\\", \\"Manhattan\\", the mega-hit \\"Sex on Fire\\", \\"17\\" and the album closer \\"Cold Desert\\", but honestly I didn't hear any 'weak' tracks on here.<br /><br />The bonus live CD (7 tracks, 25 min.) comes from a performance of the band in April, 2007 at the Hammersmith Appolo in London, bringing 4 tracks from the then-new \\"Because of the Times\\" album, including a terrific \\"Fans\\" (a salute to the band's huge UK fan base), \\"My Party\\", and \\"Arizona\\", along with a couple of \\"Aha Shake Heartbreak\\" album tracks, just terrific. Seek it out if you can.<br /><br />In all, \\"Only By the Night\\" is a great album. King of Leon's musical growth in just a matter of 4-5 years is simply amazing. \\"Youth and Young Manhood\\" and \\"Aha Shake Heartbreak\\" almost sound like they were made by a different band (don't ever call them the \\"Southern Strokes\\" again!). Last but not least, KoL are HUGE in Europe, particularly in the UK, but it now looks like the band has hit the big time in the US as well, selling out the Madison Square Garden earlier this year. I saw KoL in January in Louisville, and will see them again later this month here in Cincinnati at the PNC Pavillion (the show is already sold out).
B001TH16DS|2.0|The picture looks stunning and makes this purchase worth buying. I'm not sold on the special effects as yet. I think there's something so special about the original effects because it was done with real models and there is an artistic-ness in that alone. Thankfully both versions are available which makes this set worth buying.    I am very disappointed in the sound level of these episodes. I have to turn my volume up to max on my TV to hear them the way I'm used to watching movies. I don't know what's going on. The preview for the new Star Trek movie sound is loud and great but the playing the episodes sound is way too weak. Switching back to the original episodes soundtrack helps but not that much. I'm using a Sony PS3 game player to play theses blue rays.

0783229372|5.0|I approached \\"The Hindenburg\\" with reservations probably because of the way Hollywood has recreated historic tragedies recently, notably \\"Titanic\\" and \\"Pearl Harbor\\".  The tastefulness and sensitivity that this film treats the Hindenburg disater shouldn't have been a surprise when you consider the talent this film employs.  Robert Wise was one of our finer directors and I'm sure he had first-hand recollection that wouldn't allow him to exploit the tragedy.  Richard Levinson and William Link were reputable screenwriters whose best work is known from fine television work notably \\"Columbo\\".  Actors of George C. Scott and Anne Bancroft's calibre would only be attracted to top-notch material.  What makes the film work is it's detail to characterization.  That quality, more than the depiction of the disaster, makes the film resonate.  The disaster is one of the great unsolved mysteries of the twentieth century.  The makers of the film don't pretend to have the answers.  They throw out any number of theories and do offer sabotage as a possible explanation.  They don't treat it as gospel, though.  The makers assume the intelligence of their audience to have the common sense to draw their own conclusions.  I recommend \\"The Hindenburg\\" wholeheartedly but I would offer to younger viewers that this isn't absolute history.
B001P3SA94|5.0|Cadillac Records has has been very well researched. The facts have been loosely assembled. Maybe they plan to make a sequel where they cover the life of Phil Chess.  Still,  Everyone who loves the Blues or has listened to Howlin Wolf, Etta James, Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley and the rest will not only want a copy for themselves, they'll buy several more copies for friends.     This is a well scripted and acted depiction of a very important point in the history of music. Alan Lomax's trunk moved The Blues from the cotton fields of the South to the library of Congress. The Chess brothers brought it to your living room. You can do the same with this movie. Buy it, watch it and get up and dance!
0007248016|3.0|I thought the audio book was great....Only problem is the cd us abridged. It left me wanting more. Perhaps it's his way of getting me to read the book.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I just went through this and it was much better than I would've imagined. The series follwed the first two movies really well and did things in which were orginal (more terminators/humans sent back to build future items. Cameron's enterance was not a surprise when she hit the terminator with the truck also. I won't spoil the whole season for those that havn't seen it but this is definitly at least a rental. My favorite part (and worse part because we knew what the outcome was going to be) was when the Swat Team \\"armed and ready to go\\" arrived at a certain apartment. Also, a character seeing themself when they were young......I would recommend at least giving it a shot.
B001VLXNLU|1.0|This series came highly recommended by a friend. I want to read it but cannot. Spasmodically throughout the Kindle version, in the middle of sentences, the authors' names appear, in caps. It is bizarre and distracting. Impossible to ignore or glide over, it disrupts the reader's concentration and throws her out of the story. Whomever was in charge of translating this to Kindle fell asleep at the wheel. Amazon, please fix this!
B001GCUO1G|5.0|Not every movie can have the special effects of a Dark Knight type of production. If this movie did, it would never clear the three hundred million dollar hurdle just to break even.    I came to this movie with very low expectations since Wolverine never fascinated me as much as some other Marvel characters but was surprised by how entertained I was.    Wolverine was a much more likable character than I remember him being in previous appearances. The sibling relationship between the two clawed mutants in this movie created an interesting tension in the story line. The action was great and the movie had some very moving and very humorous moments in it. The extra Marvel characters who were thrown in such as the Blob and Gambit were very good contributions to the story and the movie.    I enjoyed this one more than the latest Marvel Hulk movie and almost as much as the Iron Man movie. This one is definitely worth seeing.

0385333846|3.0|Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five deserves its own literary genre. It is a balderdash of stories from World War II, tales from after the war, and accounts from the planet Tralfamadore. Not only does the book mix science fiction with war stories, it does so discursively. Despite the plot's constant digression, the book is not devoid of value. It is neither a completely insipid nor an entirely vacuous piece of writing. The book tells the story of Billy Pilgrim, a man from Ilium, New York, who is thrown into WWII and becomes a prisoner of the Germans. Billy Pilgrim meets several interesting people in the war, like Roland Weary, and experiences the bombing of Dresden. The most interesting part of the book is the fact that author Kurt Vonnegut is the narrator and occasionally adds first-person insight to events. Vonnegut's position as narrator allows readers to ascribe themes to a particular person. The theme of fate, for example, is no longer just a random subject but a real person's ideology. Anytime someone or something died, Vonnegut immediately followed with \\"so it goes.\\" This reveals his belief that certain events are inevitable. Such insight also allows readers to make a connection between Vonnegut and Pilgrim. Billy Pilgrim, who has become \\"unstuck in time,\\" seems to just follow where life takes him, whether it is a boxcar for prisoners of war or an entirely different planet. He has no control of his time-travel. This also shows that war probably is not good for a person's mental health, and Billy appears crazy when he tries to explain time-travel. Vonnegut expressed his own memories of the war through the fictitious character of Billy Pilgrim, and added events like his trip to Tramfamadore and sleeping with Montana Wildhack, to represent his dreams and fantasies. His appearances in the story make the implausible story seem more realistic. Another way Vonnegut manifests his ingenuity is by showing how that the Allies were not always \\"good.\\" (In fact, as described, they are both inimical and pernicious.) Most Americans are not aware of this raid that killed thousands of innocent people and transformed Dresden into an infernal blaze. He describes it in a way, however, that does not make American readers feel like their world is being turned upside-down. By stating the facts of the bombing of Dresden, he is able to show how common perceptions are not always correct.    While the lack of confluence of this novel is particularly goading, Vonnegut is able to show how common perceptions are often misleading and how fate is a key factor in life. Although Billy's time-travel points to the fact that life often takes a person somewhere without their consent (or knowledge of time-traveling, for that matter), had the book been organized differently, it would have made the story easier to follow. Because the book encompassed so many different settings and events, it is difficult to classify Slaughterhouse Five and even more difficult to follow its story.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Nathan Fillion is one of my favorite actors, and this show is definitely going down as one of the best tv shows I've ever enjoyed. I love the interaction between all of the characters, and the mysteries are quite unique. It's funny, sexy, interesting, and so entertaining. I'm really hoping it sticks around for a long while.

0240810961|5.0|Walther Stanchfield's later career with Disney was as an instructor for a wave of new animators that came to work in the 70's. Even if you are not a fan of Disney style animation, this book is essential because of the quality of writing, clarity of discussion and illustration. The author does a fantastic job of breaking down drawing and animation concepts in a way that is useful for both those who are getting started and those that are looking for ways to gain additional insight on their work.<br /><br />The format for this book is in the form of a series of lectures, focused on many different aspects of animation and drawing. Many of these are no more than a page and a half, with illustrations. Content ranges from the very specific \\"how to\\" type of instruction to more generalized concepts. In one example he illustrates an important principle of drawing for those just beginning, breaking down complex shapes into boxes, and then add back in the complexity little by little. \\"What Not to See\\" discusses what to begin with and what to leave out when sketching. From there the book launches into other essential subjects such as gesture, action, perspective. \\"Draw Verbs, not Nouns!\\" The way that the book is laid out is in general sections, but inside each section, the topics encourage browsing and skipping around.<br /><br />The editor made little or no changes to the author's writing, and illustrations are the author's own examples that he chose, in some cases from xeroxed copies that he handed out in class (not to worry, the quality is fine throughout). For the cost of this book you are getting access to the same kind of instruction that Disney's own animators had access to. It is quite a bargain.
B0011KQSZ4|4.0|A lot different than what I expected but still entertaining.  I think the fiance on drugs (not of his doing) was a scene/concept that went on for a bit too long and was not entirely believable, but the rest of the movie was just right with its surprising twists and turns.  I agree with another reviewer re: the cranky oldster in the wheelchair.  Why was this stereotype needed - it didn't add to the movie.  It would have been sufficient to have him only in the one scene that truly mattered with that character.  That scene was So Funny (as long as it doesn't happen to you it is funny).  It was also amusing to see that the British (as portrayed in this film) think a Valium is the answer to every problem.  Is that the British health care system in action?  One hopes not.
0312383320|2.0|I love the Stephanie Plum novels, even the fairly unpopular #14.  But I've never been impressed with the between-the-numbers novels.  I think it's the supernatural aspect of them.  Not that I'm against supernatural stories, but it just doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the series.  And really, does Stephanie need a third guy in her life?  Aren't two enough?<br /><br />I also have a problem with the unbelievably understanding Morelli (sure, he trusts her, but to just be fine with another guy sleeping in her bed?!).  It just feels so phony.  At least with Ranger there's some tension.  This just felt like he was written off because he was in the way.<br /><br />Bob the dog (limited though his role was) and Carl the monkey were the best parts of this book.  I admit that I really didn't put it down once I started it - it was written in the same light, easy-to-read, fast-paced style of all the Plum books - but I can't say it was great.  It feels more like these are the story ideas her publisher nixed from the numbered series but she was determined to get out there somehow.  And now that she's famous enough, she can.<br /><br />I'd rather see her flex her creativity in a whole new series - I think she could pull off a supernatural version of the Plum series, but I'd rather she left Stephanie as she was.  I know she's not entirely realistic, but... still.<br /><br />Fans of the series might be disappointed, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to someone not a big Plum fan.  Mostly I just want to say... c'mon, number fifteen!
8590379825|5.0|Significantly more than just a tutorial, this book dives deeper than the surface of the Lua language and shows you how and why things work as well.    The first edition of this book is available for free on the Web, but this second edition contains enough extra material to make it worthwhile to buy it in its own right.     If you want to be fluent in Lua or if you want to write extensions, you need this book.    And there is the factor that you can page through a real book like you can't on a computer screen.
0061139378|5.0|A wonderfully imaginative tale that pulls you in and doesn't let you surface until the last page.  It has a terrific setting, wonderful characters, and a great plot.  I don't particularly think it's a scary novel (as it says in one of the reviewer blurbs on the front) but then again I've been reading horror novels since I was about 12.  So your mileage may vary on that.  And I don't think being scarier would have made it any better - it's the imaginative, not the frightening, aspects of this story that make it so compelling.  The little girl is an amazing character.  She's creative and resourceful and likable.  The cat is a wonderful sidekick, filling out the 'good' side of the story very nicely.  The evil characters are properly mean, and there's no attempt to justify or psycho-analyze why they are that way.  Evil just is.  And perhaps that's what is so very good about this story.  As creative and well-written as it is, at the very heart of it there's just a simple children's story of good against evil.

0307454886|5.0|After reading most but not quite all of Philip Roth's books, I remain convinced it is hard to find a better writer working today. I further hesitate to review the book of a master whose writing consistently exceeds expectations in all respects. His prose is superb, his perception intriguing, his cultural awareness timely, and his depth of human understanding almost unequaled. Sentences such as: \\"The trajectory of my upbringing and my education was to delude me into entering a domestic vocation for which I had no tolerance\\" ring with the kind of despair many people experience but have difficulty expressing. Roth is able to delve deeply into the human psyche, pull it away, shake it up, invert it, then reattach it to the body, with a resounding explosion of truth. Without question, Philip Roth is one of the finest writers working today whose books will have lasting value beyond that of most modern fiction.     I especially appreciate his literary and musical references that inevitably find themselves in his writing in such a way as to give further credence to the events of the book. As the narrator of the story, David Kepesh, describes his relationships with various women, and in particular Conseula, he weaves music and literature throughout his own personal confusion. Especially moving are the pages discussing David's relationship with his son, his son's problems, and the continuing dilemma of modern man. As the book moves forward to the expected, yet powerfully emotional conclusion, the reader finds himself in the precarious and realistic tightrope of dichotomy of feelings. We may not necessarily agree with all of David Kepesh's actions, nor his own odd obsession, and we may not understand Conseula's choices nor her manner of dealing with crisis, yet on some kind of prurient level, we recognize a small part of ourselves somewhere within these people.     While The Human Stain remains my favorite Philip Roth book, every book is a gem of brilliant writing, providing alevel of human understanding rarely found in the literary world. I urge readers to pick a Roth book and enter his world. You may not love it, you might resist it, you might even disagree with it, but you will not forget it.

It's Grown. Here's How.]] is more condensed but packs a similar, significant message: (1) Deep practice.  This explains why so few of us are really very good at golf.  Our practice is shallow and sporadic, and what we're practicing is for the most part, our mistakes; so we stay at a 15 handicap, or worse, for life.<br /><br />Of course, the pros, like Vijay Singh, for example, practice (the deep approach) so much it makes you think he's trying to make a living at being a PGA professional or something.  He must have so much myelin running through his veins, he'd experience serious withdrawl symptoms if he was forced to go bowling for a few hours.<br /><br />(2) The ingition, which is simply motivation, may seem mysterious, but I think it's sparked by having a positive role model in your life, or in the world of business, having a boss who treats you with respect and dignity.  Of course, with a guy like Tiger Woods, for example, his ignition switch is wired in a way that is very mysterious, indeed.  How else could a guy accomplish so much, so quickly, in a sport filled with great players?  And even win the US Open in a playoff, with a broken leg?  Now that's an ignition switch very few possess.<br /><br />(3) Mentor coaching---Even a professional, like Tiger, who is clearly on that highest possible level of performance, is constantly striving for perfection; and he keeps seeking the advice of the Butch Harmons of the world; geniuses who can somehow find the slightest flaw in a superior player and convey the necessary adjustment to that player in a manner that doesn't mince words nor bruise egos; that's really tough to do, but it explains why Tiger is so great.  He has the intelligence and humility to realize even he can't always figure things out on his own.<br /><br />I'm sure we've all met a lot of people in our lives who are very good at what they do, but perhaps think they're a little better at it than actual reality.  They never seek mentoring because they don't think they need it; unfortunately, most of them do need mentoring.<br /><br />This explains why true greatness is so rare.  Not only do \\"the great ones\\" have to be exceptionally proficient at what they do, there must be relevence in their abilities; to attain \\"relevent greatness\\" in a world filled with self-absorbed people who are only \\"great\\" at getting in the way; that's the tricky part!<br /><br />Coyle's work in defining \\"the talent code\\", and presenting it in such a concise, straightforward manner makes it, not surprisingly, a great book.he slightest flaw in a superior player and convey the necessary adjustment to that player in a manner that doesn't mince words nor bruise egos; that's really tough to do, but it explains why Tiger is so great.

B00133KHCY|5.0|Unbelievable and yet believable. Impossible that this movie could come together this way and yet you want to believe it so bad. Quite a part for Robin Williams. He can play a creep so well as he has in other movies. Do savants learn that fast?? Perfect characters for the movie and Kerri Russell is so incredibly beautiful. Nuff said.
B001GCUO1G|3.0|After three movies of amnesia and claw-slashing, Wolverine is actually getting his own movie, all for his own. Sure, some familiar characters appear, but the stage is for him alone.<br /><br />And it's neither a horrendous movie nor a good one -- just a popcorn collection of explosions and Matrixian fight scenes, linked together by a rather loosely-strung plot that doesn't have any twists or unexpected events. Hugh Jackman does a simply stellar job as the beclawed titular character and it has some funny moments, but the part of the movie that galvanized me the most was the trailer for \\"District 9.\\"<br /><br />After a century of fighting, James Logan (Jackman) and his savage half-brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) are recruited by a mysterious army officer, William Stryker (Danny Huston), to join his elite mutant squad. Logan is sick of killing, so he tries to have the quiet life with his girlfriend Kayla (Lynn Collins) as a humble logger... until Victor reappears and murders Kayla, as part of a vendetta against his old teammates. Intent on revenge, Logan accepts the offer Stryker gives him -- he will accept a horrible and painful procedure that will make him invincible, so he can kill Victor.<br /><br />With an adamantium skeleton and an instantly-healing body, the newly-renamed Wolverine is invincible -- but he soon finds himself on the run not only from his older brother, but from Stryker's ruthless military forces. Now he must uncover a mysterious \\"island\\" that only one mutant has ever escaped from... except there are some other nasty surprises waiting for him there, courtesy of Stryker's experiments.<br /><br />By all rights, \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" should have been a far better movie than it is. But the story itself is only so-so -- it's rather straightforward in its narrative without many twists, and the Sabretooth/Wolverine backstory is handled pretty confusingly. It's only in the last quarter that the movie really acquires that epic comic-book feeling -- up until then, it's a rather bland you-killed-my-master/relative/truelove-REVENGE! tale.<br /><br />So with a bland plot, they slather on the action -- it feels like at least 75% of the movie was written to allow maximum explosions, motorcycle chases, Matrixian wire-fu, and endless claw fights. In fact, the movie is at its best when it has either some really tightly-wound fight scenes (such as the boxing match with The Blob), or a sense of humour (Wolverine accidentally destroys a nice little elderly couple's bathroom, and walks out repentantly holding their sink).<br /><br />And then there's Wolverine himself -- he can heal from anything, and his metal skeleton means he can't even be chopped up. In other words, he's indestructible. It's really hard to worry about the guy physically, and \\"Origins\\" never gets around to making us fear that he'll lose anything else.<br /><br />So it's a credit to Jackman's talent that he actually makes us care about Wolverine -- roaring, confused, grief-stricken, and slowly being hardened by all the betrayals and lies. And Schreiber does an excellent job as well, especially considering that Sabretooth is as likable as an ingrown nail -- he actually almost makes us feel sorry for his character now and then. Too bad we never, uh, really figure out why he wants to kill his brother.<br /><br />And there's a lot of great lesser roles as well -- Collins does a decent job considering her total lack of chemistry with Jackman, while the coldly contemptuous Daniel Henney, kindly will.i.am, charming gambler Kitsch and puckish Dominic Monaghan all do great jobs with their smaller-scale roles. Huston is okay, but he never quite seems scary or fanatical enough.<br /><br />\\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" has enough explosions, stunts and elaborate aerial fight scenes to shame most blockbusters, but it's lacking heart and plot.

0765348276|5.0|I never thought that a book could have as much action as say, a movie, until I read this book. The action sequences (and I have no qualms calling them that) are described such that you can see visually what is happening while reading the passage. At the time I read this book, it became my favorite science fiction novel, but it has since been surpassed by the sequel to this novel, The Ghost Brigades.     The premise of the book seems realistic despite the futuristic and amazing future described by the author. As the advanced technologies in the setting are being described to the reader, they are also being uncovered to the primary protagonist, further connecting the reader with this character.     This novel is worth it if not for the amazing battles, violence, and technology, then for the characters, premise, and attention to detail.
0385340990|5.0|I finished this book this morning around 3 am.  It was one of the first I purchased for my new Kindle last fall, but somehow could never get myself to jump into it.  Last night I started and couldn't stop hitting \\"Next Page!\\"  Using letters as the bones of the story isn't a new idea, I know.  (I am a big fan of 84 Charing Cross.) However, each character's letters were so unique, it was easy and delightful to follow the plotlines.  And, I have discovered a new heroine in the character of Elizabeth. What an amazing, free-spirited, passion-filled young woman!<br /><br />So I sat here, bleary-eyed after little sleep, but immediately getting on the computer to find out more about Guernsey (being a farm girl I knew about the cows) and about Ms.Shaffer. I began planning a visit to The Channel Islands (at least a virtual one!) Then as I looked for information on the author, I was so saddened to find that  Ms. Shaffer had passed away in 2008.  Not only was this her first novel, it will be her last.  She has left a legacy to be proud of.
044024367X|1.0|I found this addition to the 'Jack Reacher' Series to be a disappointment, to say the least. The story begins in the same formula as most of his other tales. He is sitting around somewhere and trouble finds him. OK, fair enough, we expect that. Yet, the first 150 pages rambles on and on with no focus or character development. He just goes back and forth between 2 towns and walks around.  Reacher manages to accomplish such truly unbelievable tasks (beating up dozens of cops or infiltrating a secure plant by just walking in), that the author allows him to accomplish for the sake of expediency in the story-line. Then, at the 2/3rds mark, he has a \\"scooby-doo\\" moment where he solves the crime by seeing a license plate on a truck going to canada and surmises that since the missing men have neat and tidy hotel rooms and the trucks are going to canada, they must be smuggling our poor AWOL soldiers to Canada to avoid persecution. He then ties that item to a rather sad anti-war/anti-Bush rant, that turns out to be the justification for the entire story. Wow, \\"is that a sad waste of $8 and two nights of reading?\\", was my first thought. I wonder if Child could have just written an epilogue on the Iraq war and given us a better story. He hinges his story on 4 details. 1)The Iraq conflict is a senseless mess that is holding captive most of our army and creating desperate deserters who need an \\"underground railroad\\" to Canada. 2) Our government is using \\"heavy artillery\\" to destroy civilian vehicles in Iraq, and they need to cover this up by sending the cars to a secret waste disposal plant. 3) our M1 Abrams main battle tanks are being destroyed by IEDs and this is so embarrassing that we have to hide it. 4) The evil plant owner who performs this work refuses to protect his workers from Depleted Uranium Armor waste products, and kills an entire town, whilst he tries to cause The Apocalypse. (I am not kidding you, Folks..THE APOCALYPSE!) What is interesting is that 1) we never hadmass deserting in the army. We actually had 3 out 4 soldiers re-up for another 4 years.(surpassing the army's recruiting goals, I might add.) If you want 'out' of the army, soldiers just quit and take the dishonorable discharge, rather than become a fugitive and hide in canada! 2) We actually do openly destroy civilian vehicles in Iraq. (just look at military.com or youtube, the vids are everywhere, and the action is far from senseless when the cars are packed with insurgents and C4 explosives heading on a suicide run....) 3)IEDs are made out of 4-200mm artillery shells and buried in the path of the tanks. The blast blows them 50 feet in the air. Any tank would break..No?? 4)the plant owner could hand out hazmat suits for his workers rather than poison them.. Do I need to go on?  So, please Mr Child, make us a better story next time! Keep politics on the nightly news and craft a real nail-biter like the first 5 novels!!
B001KVZ6F2|3.0|Synopsis:  Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is an old-school Detroiter (read:  a white Detroiter who stayed in the city after 1967) and Korean war veteran who lost his wife to old age.  He's bitter with both his obnoxious family (who try to milk him for everything he has while providing absolutely nothing in return) and the world that surrounds him (which is crumbling away in a state of apathy.)  As Hmong immigrants start to populate his area, one such family moves next door.  The introverted son of the family, Thao (Bee Vang), is targeted by his cousin who goes by his gang name Spider (Doua Moua) who attempts to \\"make him a man\\" through having him commit gang-related crimes.  Thao is pressured to go through a robbery attempt on Walt's Gran Torino, only to be caught and nearly shot by Walt.  Spider attempts to rough up Thao and his sister Sue (Ahney Her) when Walt comes out, guns drawn, and commands them to leave.  Indebted to Walt for sticking up to Spider, Sue grows an admiration for Walt while Thao is coerced by his family to \\"work off the debt\\" after dishonoring the family with his robbery attempt.  Though spiteful of Thao at first, Walt eventually starts to give him the type of guidance needed to discover his manhood.  However, Spider and his gang are insulted by Walt's interference and carries out acts of revenge against Thao, Sue, and their family.  Walt realizes that as long as Spider is around, their family will never rest and he's the only person who can stop him and his thugs from intimidating them...    I wrestled with what kinda rating I wanted to give this movie.  In end, I felt it was appropriate to give the film 3.5 stars.  Here's why:    Considering that the cast was composed of Clint Eastwood and a bunch of amateurs, the film actually turned out rather well.  It had it's funny moments despite the overall dramatic tone of the film.  Everyone committed to doing the best they could and carried through a certain human element that couldn't be replicatedwith an all-professional cast, so that was unique in contrast to many of the movies I've seen recently.  The dialogue wasn't pleasant or even remotely P.C., but it reflected the age of Eastwood's character in the film where people addressed each other as such (if you don't know ethnic slurs related to Italians, Polish, Blacks, Asians, etc, you're not gonna learn them here.)  I should also note the ending scenes of the film came as a surprise to me (save the very last one) and left you with the messages of justice through redemption.    However, there was a enough that I couldn't look past to feel the film warranted a higher rating, and that had much to do with being a born-and-bred Detroiter who watched the film.  We're dealing with a city that's 82% black with an expanding Arab community, but featured a primarily white and Asian cast aside from three black teenagers and a car full of Hispanic gang members.  Anyone living near Detroit would also wonder why a Polish resident would live in a predominately black Highland Park while Hamtramck, the next town over, has a significant Polish community.  The plot devices involving Walt's immediate family were easy to telegraph from miles away and just reaffirmed the message that idle hands have nothing to show for their labor.  Also, the language in the film would have came as a shock at first, but eventually became stereotypical and tired by the time the film wound down.     This movie might be viewed as a conservative movie, but I would recommend it to the NRA supporters and pro-justice crowd rather than the fundamentally religious.  I'd also recommend it to anyone who doesn't have any familiarity with the Detroit area because there's a good chance that the movie's charming moments would sweep you away.  I don't know if I'd put it in the same light as other critically acclaimed movies, but at the end of the day, it wasn't a bad film and I could see why many would enjoy it.  Feel free to check it out.

B000KKPN5C|4.0|Due to some of the quirks my Quantaray, I wanted something a bit faster and more reliable for my jobs.  When I first powered up the SB-400, I was amazed how much faster it charged than my Quantaray(8-seconds on a good day)  The build quality is also miles ahead of this cheap rebranded Sunpak.  The Nikon is a little heavier, has a metal shoe, wonderful locking mechanism and just feels more solid.  However, none of this matters as much as the outcome of the photos...    With both flashes set at no bounce, there's very little noticeable difference.  However, as soon as you click them up a notch, the power difference is quite obvious.  Consider the bounce on the SB-400 more of an added bounus than a feature.  While the pictures at 60-degrees bounce weren't bad, they were much darker than my Quantaray.  Going all the way to 90-degrees made the photos almost too under-exposed to use.    The Nikon also lacks an AF-Assist light.  The one in the Quantaray is quite effective even farther out than the built-in assist light, so having one would be quite a nice addition.    Also lacking on the Nikon are manual controls.  There's no way to bump the EV up any higher...  Well, there may be some way within the camera, but even using the \\"Flash Comp\\", I couldn't get it nearly as bright as the Quantaray was, especially when it was maxed out.    So all in all, I do really like this flash.  However, if you plan to use a bounce flash, I'd strongly recommend looking into something more powerful.  And believe me, since I got my Quantaray, I almost never take photos anymore without bouncing the flash to some extent.

0374531269|4.0|\\"A Long Way Gone\\" is an extremely interesting book written by Ishmael Beah a former child solider that fought in the war in Sierra Leone.<br /><br />The book follows Ishmael starting when he was 13 through his life at the beginning of the war, the terrible things that were done to innocent civilians and how he was forced to witness the dreadful things happening around him. He fought in the ranks of the Sierra Leone Army as a child soldier. He witnessed terrible things and then did the same terrible things himself with his own two hands that even seem horrible for grown men to do.<br /><br />I think it's important to be aware of what's going on in our world<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to everyone

B001U9BRNE|4.0|Great live concert!  The only thing is that the video is 1080i, NOT 1080p like some Amazon reviews are stating in their comments (I would have given a 5 star review if the video was 1080p, but the picture is still stunning as presented).  As for the sound, there are two options: PCM Stereo & 5.1 Surround from the bluray menu selection.  The funny thing is that when you choose 5.1 Surround, it's actually is a mind-blowing DTS!  I had the DVD release and thought the sound was awesome then, but I have to say that the DTS audio setting on this bluray is just so clear, robust, and meant to be heard this way.  There's a lot more definition & instrument detail here and there which makes it worthwhile to experience again and again.  Wish I was there live, but this is the next best thing.  Go out & get this bluray.  You won't regret it!

B001PA0FFO|4.0|So for anyone who had that special of an experience in catholic gradeschool that they now consider themselves anything but catholic, watch this movie prepared.  The nuns are square on - cold, heartless and terrifying (save for one good hearted one).  Ah, but without continuing this personal expose, this was a great film about some of the worst tendencies of human nature - gossip.  And the priest delivers a fantastic sermon on gossip with a great allegory.  My wife and I actually discussed this one for several days debating on whether he did it nor not.  That's the mark of a good story for me - giving you something to debate.  As much as I dislike Hoffman, he was great and played the role perfectly.  And Meryl Streep is, as always, fantastic, but with an accent that wavers a little in its believability.
0684865130|4.0|Yossarian, the protagonist of Joseph Heller's Catch-22, is an unlikely war hero. Many central characters in war novels focus on more typical soldierly qualities, such as bravery and duty,  but Yossarian is a blatant antihero whom the reader comes to regard as a competent and sane voice in an otherwise absurd setting. Yossarian has no illusions about the war and does not trouble himself by concealing from his military superiors his true feelings and concerns. While there were certainly moral factors in World War II--e.g. the fight against fascism--Yossarian's bizarre environment has erased any pretense of nobility. His military service can only serve to get him killed, as he constantly reiterates.<br /><br />To Yossarian, the needs of society can never replace the needs of the individual. Although society may be comprised of individual citizens, each must retain his fundamental freedoms and safety. Within his bomber group, Yossarian has found the blatant indifference of General Dreedle, the incompetent careerism of Colonels Cathcart and Scheisskopf, and the maddening anti-social behavior of Major Major, the squadron commander. Against this backdrop, Yossarian cannot accept that the needs of society trump those of the individual; furthermore, he believes his need--survival--outweighs the Army's need for him to fly missions as a bombardier.<br /><br />Catch-22 is as relevant and compelling today as it ever was. With America embroiled in two wars, each with its own nebulous goal and distorted morality, the role of the individual in society is more in question that ever. Yet, unlike Heller's day, there is no draft and individuals are no longer compelled to serve in uniform; thus, war persists because the military has been relegated to nothing more than a government department that politicians and bureaucrats are unencumbered to use as they see fit. As society moves down this dangerous path, most readers would do well to read and reread Catch-22 and reflect.
B001GAPC1K|3.0|Undoubtedly Blu Ray reference material - great audio and video.  The story is a big mixed though.  The SX are great, but the story seems forced and artificial.  I'm not a comic book fan at all, and do not know the comic iron man story, so i'm likely at a disadvantage.  however, the antagonist seems to just be there and be a formidable foe, no real development to that plot evolution.  at the same time, this is an action movie first and foremost, so perhaps i'm asking too much.  it just wasn't climactic - the final battle happens, and its not satisfying. otherwise, downey is awesome, the dialog is fun, etc.
0061122416|3.0|As a high school student, I find myself reading fantastic literature daily, either for my reading class or for fun.  It is possible that this is the reason I was not blown away by \\"The Alchemist\\".  In this book, Paulo Coelho portrays the story of a young shepherd that leaves everything behind to follow his \\"personal destiny\\", and defies the odds by truly believing in himself.  In other words, he follows the clich&eacute; path that every protagonist follows these days.  Although Coelho produces an interesting and heart-warming tale, I was writing short stories with as much originality as this in seventh grade.<br />Coelho was born in Rio de Janeiro, and was an aspiring writer from an early age.  Unfortunately, his parents tried forcing him from such a whimsical future by putting him in a mental institution, then sending him to law school.  Coelho soon dropped out from the school and became a traveling hippy.  He returned to Brazil, and was arrested and tortured for \\"subversive activities\\".  Upon his release, he walked the 500 mile Road of Santiago de Compostela, and had a spiritual awakening.  This awakening allowed him to write \\"The Pilgrimage\\" and later opened him up to writing \\"The Alchemist\\" to describe his experiences.<br />As I read the book, I enjoyed myself, and the strong message of hope and faith did give me a warm fuzzy feeling.  As I continued, I realized that the book was telling me that if you truly believe in yourself, you can achieve anything; I almost fell over laughing.  I thought that such a prestigious novel would have a storyline that was slightly more insightful then second grade picture books. Although I was annoyed by the lack of originality, Coelho does a fantastic job of immersing the reader in the protagonist's struggle, and does have a way of expressing sheer joy through is writing.<br />Many people would tell you that the book is not even worth opening, and I admit that I would not define it as a \\"must-read\\".  However, Coelho shows us a nice side of life that, for a little bit, allows us to wonder and to hope for the best in life.  Altogether, it was not a bad book.hat, for a little bit, allows us to wonder and to hope for the best in life.  Altogether, it was not a bad book.

B001VB8UAE|5.0|Live In Concert 2006 far surpasses all previous Barbra Streisand concerts released on home video in the artistry of its production, from Barbra's marvelous performance to appealing staging, elegant lighting, dazzling sound, and overall warmth.  Indeed, the Blu-ray presentation is the ideal way to enjoy the show, as it realizes the true enhanced resolution captured by the many high definition cameras in Sunrise, Florida's BankAtlantic Center on that special night in October 2006.  Seeing the amazing concert in its entirety relives the memorable evening my wife and I shared with Barbra in Atlanta only a week later and promises to be a wondrous experience for first-timers.  Barbra's complete program is here, including her humor-filled Q&A with the audience via note cards, shout-outs, and a surprise short version of \\"Stoney End.\\"  The George Bush comedy sketch is excluded but not missed, while the bonus features include Barbra's extraordinarily delicate \\"Nobody's Heart (Belongs To Me)\\" backed only by piano, \\"When The Sun Comes Out\\" (an early `60s concert number), and \\"The Woman In The Moon\\" filmed with regular lighting and standard definition at L.A.'s Staples Center at the end of the tour.  Barbra delivers an inspiring introduction to the song and to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senator Barbara Boxer in the audience.  Il Divo's \\"My Way\\" appears right before \\"Come Rain Or Come Shine,\\" with their other two songs viewable among the bonus features.  \\"The People Behind The Scenes\\" is a neat 6-minute segment with comments about Barbra from manager Marty Erlichman (\\"I still get goosebumps\\"), Jay Landers (\\"She discovered new meaning in songs she sang when she was younger\\"), director Gary Smith (\\"This is forever and should be\\"), Richard Jay Alexander, and conductor-arranger Bill Ross.  Marge Tabankin, The Streisand Foundation's executive director, speaks for 10 enlightening minutes mainly about Barbra.      While we have enjoyed the Live In Concert 2006 CD for two years, the concert on video, particularly in full 1080p HD only available on Blu-ray, really brings you front and center, and Barbra's musical performances are truly compelling.  \\"Funny Girl,\\" sung for the first time in 40 years, is almost all in close-up and sounds as poignant as ever.  Another highlight, although often performed, is \\"The Way We Were\\" with a gliding camera move from one side of Barbra to the other.  Throughout the concert, the multiple camera work is flawless and flowing, with graceful editing, harkening back to classic television and concert videos with long-lasting shots that allow us to savor each lyric instead of today's quick-cutting style.  \\"Unusual Way\\" is definitely one of the highlights, as one camera pulls in and pushes out and another captures Barbra's figure from the sides and her contented smile at the song's conclusion.  \\"Don't Rain On My Parade (reprise)\\" is a perfect first encore, a sheer delight and bare-footed triumph.  For the final encore, \\"Smile,\\" Barbra and the audience focus attention on Samantha, her darling white poodle/bichon, whose great affection for Barbra is also evident elsewhere in the program.  Barbra's final performance of the evening is sublime and further conveys a renewed emotional connection with her adoring audience.    The 3-DVD set adds the 102-minute July 1994 concert exactly as shown on HBO in 1994, but this time in surround sound, and the 1987 HBO special on the making of The Broadway Album, both making first-time DVD appearances.  Rounding out disc 3 is a sampler of songs from each of Barbra's first five TV specials, which were previously released on DVD.
B001GCUO1G|5.0|\\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\"<br />(20th Century Fox, 2009)<br />----------------------------------------<br />I've seen lot of reviews complaining that this movie was all special effects and too little plot.  Personally, that's just fine with me. I think the biggest problem with most superhero blockbusters (to date, with the exception of \\"Iron Man\\") is that they have too much plot, and not enough action. Film after dreadful film has come out, each one more top-heavy and pretentious than the other, and as someone who has been reading DC and Marvel comics since 1971, I've just gritted my teeth and waited for them to get all that blah-blah-blah stuff out of their system and start making movies that are as fast-moving and fun as the comics themselves.<br /><br />\\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" is a big step in the right direction. It's action-packed, thrilling and mercifully light on leaden exposition: there's not a lot of time wasted explaining every little thing or trying to (verbally) impress us with the holy-cow awesome awesomeness of what we are about to witness. Show, don't tell. That works a lot better.<br /><br />Yes, there are inconsistencies and quirks (Wolverine's heightened sense of smell, for example, seems to desert him at several key moments) and yes, at times there are things that could be better explained (Gambit's powers, for example.) The biggest problem is that the main bad guy, Col. Stryker, is pretty boring and gets old quick, but this is balanced by a great performance by Liev Schreiber, who is consistently creepy and menacing as Wolverine's nemesis, Sabretooth. Also, the script -- in what has become a Hollywood traditional -- needlessly muddies up the original continuity from the comicbooks. But, whatever. It's just a superhero movie.<br /><br />Mostly, these are just quibbles. This film zooms nicely along and has far more action in it than any superhero movie to date, which is a good thing. Although it's exhausting to watch, it's also exciting, and frankly, I think that's what fans want, not some lame attempt to turn dopey kid's stuff into high art. Finally! Bring on the mayhem!<br /><br />Nerd-fan postscript: Since this film is set in the past and doesn't immediately link Wolverine to the present-day X-Men team, I'd totally be up for a non-X Men sequel that has Wolvie becoming a SHIELD super-spy or learning all his ninja tricks, or whatever. Hugh Jackman is perfect for the part: he looks right and he's really starting to capture the character. I say, strike while the adamantium is hot, and bang out a couple more of these puppies.

The 3rd section about her travels to Bali were my favorite, but it all built on the beginning and middle of the book. I don't understand how some of these reviewers thought it was so \\"self absorbed\\" and \\"me me me\\". Well, it's a memoir folks. It's about her life and despair and search for spirituality.

031606792X|3.0|Possible spoilers!    I have a REAL problem regarding this series and this last book in particular.  I was obsessed with them - but only after reading New Moon.  Twilight didn't do much for me and I thought it was a waste of an intriguing idea.  However, as I said, I really got into this series and was sad - actually sad - as I got to the last page of the fourth book.  Why then, do I find it so hard to say it was actually a good story well told?  To be led by the nose for thousands of pages by the promise of how dangerous and unbearably passionate sex with Edward could be, I feel mighty cheated that Ms Meyers didn't show us ANYTHING.  I know these books were aimed at YA readers (or maybe just Christian audiences) - hence the 'no sex before marriage' attitude. But why start writing about the undead and vampires at all if you want to keep things on a moral footing?   Then the unforgivable happens - we are cheated out of the moment we have all been waiting for. For Bella to be turned in some horrendous childbirth scene rather than by Edward's lips was the biggest let down of all.  That should have been the most amazing part of the story - letting the readers have what they have been holding their breath for - the erotic, powerful finale of Edward biting Bella. But no.     I just feel that you can't write a story about Vampires and focus on their strong desires and passions without taking things to their natural conclusion.  All the perfection got boring.  Even the fascinating Edward had me rolling my eyes and skipping his parts by the end.  And poor Jake (or Jacob - make your mind up).  What a humiliating end for him?  And, uncomfortable or not? Imprinting with the character he did?  I know the author went out of her way to make it ok, but it just didn't work for me.  She won't write a sex scene but she can have THAT relationship as part of the story??  And what's with the change of POV halfway through?  I was so annoyed I almost skipped that part entirely.  Having said all that, I can't say I didn't enjoy the experience of reading this saga and being totally caught up in these characters.  Ultimately, it just made me hanker for the kind of story I want to read.  One for grown ups.

1439138311|5.0|\\"Brooklyn,\\" comes to us from Irish author Colm Toibin, who is the author of five previous novels, including [[ASIN:0743203313 The Blackwater Lightship: A Novel]]and [[ASIN:0743250419 The Master: A Novel]], each shortlisted for Britain's prestigious Booker Prize.  \\"The Master\\" also won the \\"Los Angeles Times\\" Book Prize in fiction, and the highly-regarded International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award.<br /><br />Eilis Lacey (I've no idea how to pronounce that given name, have never heard it before, in fact), finds herself unwillingly part of Ireland's second great Diaspora, the twentieth century one: like so many others, she's forced to leave her hometown, tiny Enniscorthy (also, apparently, Toibin's hometown), for lack of work, although she's a good bookkeeper. (The first great Diaspora was, of course, that of the terrible 1840's -1850s Famine.)  So, anyhow, at the instigation of Father Flood, a local priest who has found a parish in what was still, then, in the 1950s, the great Irish city of Brooklyn, New York, she unhappily leaves her little room, her Mam, and her glamorous, worldly elder sister Rose.  Father Flood finds her a job in a Fulton Street store and a room in a Clinton Street boardinghouse in his parish.  Eilis battles homesickness, learns about Brooklyn's bitter cold winters and blazing hot summers; and its local professional baseball team, the Dodgers; goes to Brooklyn College nights to learn accountancy, and meets a man.  Then bitter news calls her back to Ireland, and throws her future into doubt.<br /><br />Toibin certainly has a way with a female character, and in Eilis he has created a very believable young woman.  He has also very accurately and beautifully created her surroundings in Ireland, and in Brooklyn.  However, the bitter news that calls Eilis back to Ireland closely parallels the \\"Deus ex macchina\\"that the author of the last Amazon Vine book I read used to get her character where she wanted her.  And then Toibin uses yet another \\"Deus ex machina\\" to help resolve his protagonist's future.<br /><br />Many reviewers have complained that the novel's first 100 pages, largely about Eilis's life in Brooklyn of the 50's, bored them.  I part company with them there.  I'm Brooklyn-born myself, and often say I was born a Dodger fan and a Yankee hater, as my mother was about to give birth after the first Yankee-Dodger World Series, in 1941.  And my family moved to Long Island, in 1950, as many of the characters in this novel either are talking about doing, or have done.  But we still loved the Dodgers.  My husband, who's also Brooklyn-born, first-generation, to Irish immigrants in one of those all-Irish parishes, was eagerly anticipating his eighteenth birthday, so he could sell beer on his summer job -- that's where the big money was -- if you were hawking food and drink in the Dodgers' home, Ebbets Field.  And just as the lad was nearly there, Dem Bums up and left.  Furthermore, I moved back to Brooklyn as an adult, and lived there for many, many years: I can tell you Toibin has accurately placed every street he mentions.  My husband and I know them all well: know Brooklyn well. Toibin captures it to the life.  Give the man an extra star.china\\" to help resolve his protagonist's future.<br /><br />Many reviewers have complained that the novel's first 100 pages, largely about Eilis's life in Brooklyn of the 50's, bored them.

B001UREJWM|4.0|Heaven And Hell are Black Sabbath incarnate. I have been a Black Sabbath fan since I was a teenager. It's been a long time.    I think that The Devil You Know, is a very good album. Some of the tracks are far better than others.    Is The Devil You Know, better than the other albums released with the Iommi/Dio/Butler/Appice lineup? Yes, and no.     There is a point where the songs on The Devil You Know sound original and sometimes the songs sound familiar to those of the past.     I think for the most part, overall, the album is original and most of the tracks stand out on their own.    I do not think the album is boring and the songs do not sound repetitive. This album is anything but boring and repetitive.     The Devil You Know, is performed by artists you know. It has THAT sound. It is produced as an album of such caliber is and has been produced.     The release of The Devil You Know isn't going please everyone. No one should go on listening to the album with any expectations.     It will take more than one listen, like any other album, to appreciate it.    Some outstanding tracks on The Devil You Know are; Fear, Double The Pain, Follow The Tears, The Turn Of The Screw and Rock And Roll Angel.      Rock On!

The narrator has many of the same life experiences at Coelho and seems to be a poorly disguised alter ego of the author. Unfortunately he is also an arrogant fool who is not even slightly compelling. I made it to page 82 of The Zahir but will not waste any more of my time. What a disappointment.

B001PPLIFU|5.0|Most people are bashing this  movie saying it's too violent. Yes it is violent and action packed, just like a Bond movie is supposed to be. Daniel Craige is an excellent Bond, only second to Connery. The movie is violent because the character is on a path of revenge. All he wants is to do is find and kill those responsible for Vesper's death. She tore his armor away, now he must put it back on at full force. He is becoming the brash Bond we know and love. I have seen the movie five times and each time I find something new I like about it. It's a great sequal to Casino Royal, and the great picture quality offered on Blu Ray, make this a great buy. Complete your Bond set today with the Quantum of Solace Blu Ray!
B000000OXH|3.0|1983 : Asia was on the top of the music world.<br />Following a highly successful debut album which welded the adventurous nature of progressive rock with the sensibilities of commercial pop.<br />The pressure was on to make a successful follow up.<br />John Wetton & Geoff Downes had the most commercially successful compositions on the first album, so the label chose them to compose the entire album, effectively shutting out Steve Howe from the creative process, and severing the key link with the prog-rock elements that made the first album so strong.<br />Carl Palmer was also held very much in check, for John & Geoff's compositions were very much on the pop side, and the \\"wall of sound\\" heavily echoed mixes left Carl & Steve out in the cold.<br /><br />  The Tracks:<br /><br />\\"Don't Cry\\" was the group's most successful single, and the album's opener.<br />The opening bars are promising with Steve's electric and Carl's hi-hat lay over Geoff's piano, turning into a high energy steel guitar and tom-tom rolls-all of which leads to...a straight pop song that features John's vocals (he did all of the vocals on the album; no more 3-part harmony) and Geoff's keyboards - this was to be the pattern for most of the album.<br /><br />\\"The Smile Has Left Your Eyes\\" is a Wetton solo composition which would be a great power ballad for any regular pop band, but too lightweight for this quartet.<br /><br />\\"Never in a Million Years\\" & \\"True Colors\\" ...

B000057DON|5.0|I just picked up a brand new repress today on 180 gram vinyl and I have it on my turntable right now.  With my Kenwood direct drive KD-2070 and audio technia cartridge man it sounds great.  Warmer and smoother than the CD; I have both.<br /><br />Not to mention the memories of the first time I listened to this album at a friends.  The first time I heard it we listened to it on a boom box on cassette.  I remember about halfway through listening to Welcome to the Jungle the batteries went dead.  I ran home and grabbed a few fresh ones out of my dresser.  Then we completed our very first listen.  This album is timeless and I hold it to the same standards as a Beatles or Zeppelin record.<br /><br />If you are a big fan of this album the vinyl re-release leaves no disappoints and serves to be a great memory machine.  22 years later it rocks just as hard as the first time I listened to it.

B0000AUHOH|5.0|STAR TREK - THE FINAL FRONTIER is by no means the best STAR TREK  movie.  It drags on in several places, and the visual effects look like they went through absolutely no post-production.  Aside from that, though, there is an engaging story, great acting, and some great moments that make this film memorable.    I enjoy the STAR TREK films just as a casual movie-goer.  I'm not a Trekkie in the least, so I have no idea if this film goes against some of their rules.  That's my disclaimer: If you're a Trekkie, see the film for yourself.  However, I read quite a bit about the film before I watched it, and it seemed no one liked it.  Even Roger Ebert, whose opinions usually coincide with mine, called it \\"pretty much a mess\\".  I could see where fans might not like this one, as it varies from the usual STAR TREK formula, but I enjoyed it.    The plot goes like this: Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are on vacation, but are called back in (with the rest of the crew) when intergalactic consuls are taken hostage in a neutral zone.  Sounds okay, right?  I kept waiting for something horrible...Back to it.  The ENTERPRISE, which is in pieces, flies to the planet, Nimbus 3, to rescue the hostages.  While there, however, they are captured by a renegade Vulcan, Sybock, whose quest for the Divine has robbed him of his sanity.  He holds the crew as prisoners on their own ship, while piloting it to Sha-Ka-Ree, the fabled Eden of the galaxy, where God is supposedly located.  (oh, and there are some angry Klingons in there too, but they're not important)    Yes, yes, it sounds pretty ridiculous, but not any more than any of the other films (VOYAGE HOME, I'm talking about you).  And the crew of the film execute the story pretty well.  The acting is great (especially by the two Vulcans, Spock and Sybock), and the script was fine, with some genuinely funny and touching moments.  The film picks up speed after the first 15-20 minutes, and it doesn't slow down all that much.  Some of the visuals are awful (take the Klingon ship firing at an old space probe), but they prove not to be a distraction from the film's real centerpiece, which are the characters.  Supporting roles, like Uhura and Scotty, get increased roles in this one.    About the big climax of the movie: I can see where it might be a bit disappointing (and a bit reminiscent of WIZARD OF OZ), but for me it was okay.  The end of this film, for me, was quite like the end of THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK:  The real climax didn't come at the big showdown at the end.  For me, the best part of the ending was after, when Kirk, Spock, and McCoy speak of what they mean to each other.  Sounds corny, but really: moments like that are those that make STAR TREK magic.  And, even if no one else agrees, I think this film gets that right.

B001R4MEYI|5.0|This album at first took me by surprise for being less aggressive for a band so famous for their aggressive tunes...and yet, after listening to it more and more, it became apparent to me that the musical layers and textures of this CD completely blow away their other CDs.    Another plus of this CD was that it is apparently much easier for the band to replicate the sound of Crack the Skye live than it is their other CDs. I saw them live in concert just a couple weeks ago and they ripped through the CD end to end to start out the concert, it was nearly flawless compared to some of the difficulties they have with some of the songs from BM and Leviathan.    I had this CD on constant repeat in my car for 2 or 3 weeks straight and I probably listened to it 30 or 40 times already and it just gets better and better.
068484267X|5.0|I chose to read Angela's Ashes for a school assignment because my older sister recommended it to me.  Before I checked out this book, my high school literature teacher warned me that I would need to keep a box of tissues close while I read it.  She was absolutely right.     In this memoir, Frank McCourt tells the story of his childhood.  The book begins in New York where Frank lives with his depressed mother, Angela, his drunken father, Malachy, and his younger brothers, Malachy, Oliver and Eugene.  After Frank's baby sister, Margaret, dies, the family goes back to Ireland, their home country.  The McCourt family lives in a poverty-stricken neighborhood.  They rarely have money to buy food or pay the rent because Frank's alcoholic father always drinks his wages.  This book tells the hardships and tragedies of the McCourt family and the desperate measures that had to be executed as they struggled to survive.     Angela's Ashes is truly unique because of the way it is written.  Frank McCourt creatively wrote his memoir without the use of dialogue in quotations.  Instead, he wrote everything in paragraph form.  This style of writing stunned me.  At first I was confused, and it took some time to get used to it.  As I read more and more of the book, I grew to appreciate Frank McCourt's individualistic writing that I found was often humorous.     Many book reviewers on Amazon dislike Angela's Ashes because it has a repetitive storyline and is overly depressing.  Truthfully, I thought the same exact thing while I was reading it.  However, I realized that the element of tragedy is what makes this book successful.  Angela's Ashes made me realize that life is not always easy and how important it is to remain positive even through the toughest times.  Angela's Ashes is an excellent read.

0374139563|1.0|Basic errors, conclusory reasoning, and an overly broad brush undermine the arguments in this short book.     Basic errors in just the first 35 pages include the author's statement that \\"the 1979 oil spike precipitated by the Iran-Iraq war\\" lead to financial instabilities, a neat trick given that that war started in Sept 1980, and she claims that the US$1 trillion of aid that has been transferred to Africa \\"is nearly US$1,000 for every man, woman and child on the planet today,\\" which is simply wrong as $1 trillion divided by 6.7 billion (the current population of the earth) is less than $150 per person. When an anti-aid book overstates the amount of pre-capita aid by a factor of more than 6 it certainly does not inspire confidence in the author's arguments.      And many of the arguments are not well-developed anyhow, or fail to address contrary evidence. Botswana received aid equal to almost 20% of its GDP per year and did well. Did aid dollars, for example, fund schools or help fight HIV and thereby allow the govt to concentrate on other matters? Not according to the author, but we really have to take her word on that. Did Chad and several other African nations just happen to have \\"the good sense\\" to establish savings funds for commodity windfalls, as the author claims, or did they receive (more than) a nudge from World Bank, as the World Bank claims? The author refuses to give the World Bank and other aid institutions any credit, claiming conditionality has \\"failed miserably.\\" Maybe, but given other errors in the book, I have to trust the World Bank on this one.     A more fundamental problem is that the author's thesis essentially requires that she tar all aid, even though the types of aid and the motivations of donors and other funding entities have varied. The author acknowledges, for example, that aid in the 1960-1980s was frequently driven by Cold War concerns. But is it surprising that aid intended to prop up a Cold War pawn did not help the populace of thedonee country? Is it surprising that aid intended to finance the purchase of the donor's products harms comparable producers in the donee country? The author's failure to discuss in any depth studies which distinguish between (relatively) effective aid and ineffective (or destructive) aid renders this book less useful than works such as the Bottom Billion, by Paul Collier.
0979433703|4.0|The opening of The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick) by Seth Godin goes like this:        \\"I feel like giving up.        \\"Almost every day, in fact.  Not all day, of course, but there are moments.\\"        ~ p 3    Thus, I was immediately drawn in.    For a high-level philosophical viewpoint, I think Godin gets his point across quite well.  For a low-level practical standpoint, though, I'm not so sure.    However, since it is a high-level look, it can apply in so many areas.  It can apply personally or corporately.  It can apply to marketing, general management, IT, or any area where you might have a goal.  It can apply to a corporate strategy or a career path.    Godin outlines 3 types of obstacles:       1. The dip.  This is what separates the experts from the amateurs.  It takes resources to cross the dip, to get back up the hill and succeed.       2. The cul-de-sac.  This can also be called the \\"dead end\\".  No amount of effort is going to get you where you want in this space.       3. The cliff.  You climb up and up, but then you suddenly crash.  A disaster is the result.    I think we can all think of examples of these.  Godin gives the example of passing organic chemistry as the dip for pre-med students.  Getting past HR might be a dip for a job seeker.  A dead-end job is a cul-de-sac.  Cigarette smoking is a cliff.  You puff along and puff along, and all of a sudden you're dealing with a life debilitating disease like emphysema.    Basically, his advice seems to be that as long as it is worth doing, it is a dip.  If it is not worth doing, then it is a cul-de-sac.  If it is a dip, keep persevering.  However, one should be more than willing to quit for cul-de-sacs and cliffs.    It's easy enough to say that one should quit if it is a dead-end.  Godin tells of people who quit because they did not cross a dip, though.  Instead of quitting a cul-de-sac, they quit in a dip.  I'm just not convinced that he gave clear enough guidelines to distinguish the 2 in a practical situation.    Throughout the book, Godin argues that diversification takes away energy from other pursuits.  It takes resources away from the energy that's needed to overcome the dip.    His analogy breaks of a woodpecker trying a thousand trees instead of sticking to the single tree breaks, though.  What if there is no dinner to be found in that particular tree?    The other problem, of course, is that often you have so many options that it can be hard to narrow them down.  Sometimes you really do have to experiment with different things and ideas before you find something that works and works well.    To me, it gets even more confusing then, as Godin presents dips as not being concrete objects.  They are subject to change.    Microsoft, for example, was able to create a dip by becoming the standard.  They themselves overcame dips by persevering with Windows, Word, Excel, etc.  They failed a few times before they won.  Now, the dip has become much larger for those who follow.    Then, he states that quitting in the dip is a mistake usually based upon short-term concerns.  Here I think, then, is what probably is the key to dip vs. cul-de-sac.  One is a short-term problem that can be overcome and even changed with effort and insight.  The other is long-term and immovable.  I really think not stating this concretely and earlier in the book is the book's biggest weakness.    Godin presents a Harvard Medical Degree as an example of sunk-cost.  Someone who is studying medicine but cannot stand to cut someone open is probably not going to make a great surgeon.    To me, though, the most valuable part of the book is to write down the circumstances in which you will quit.  This really seems to differentiate the dips from the cul-de-sacs.  An athlete isn't going to quit because of a bruised knee.  A congenital heart condition might be a good reason to quit, though.    It seems appropriate that there isn't a neat bow to tidy things up atthe end of the book.  Rather, it ends with a lot of questions.  These questions should guide you to further thinking on the subject.  I'll let you read the book and answer them yourself.

1416562605|5.0|Savage is an understatement, wild would still be too weak. This book is a prophetic vision of what this world is coming to as for development. It has always been the same thing: the rich or/and the powerful or/and the rich powerful have always had the upper hand over society and progress has come because that rich-dom and that powerful-dom had to be shared and spread. But this happened in the past through pure violence and only violence. The new element today is that violence is only the very first step on the way to power and wealth, and the main tool is education, knowledge, entrepreneurial experience and know-how. In this modern world of entrepreneurial initiative the number of people who have to have power and who have to have the wealth necessary to conquer that power or to sustain that power has to grow at a tremendous speed. Our modern society does not tolerate power and wealth to be concentrated in a handful of people, not even a minority but an infinitesimal minority. Equality is the main motto and justice the most important slogan of the younger generations, replacing the liberty of our forefathers. But the world has been globalized and the change is coming from everywhere on the planet at the same time. As long as it was only happening in the western developed and industrialized minority world (at the most 15% of the planet), it was quite easy to control. But today it is happening everywhere and countries like China or India represent more than half the population of the globe and everything is upside down, and the west is doomed to disappear in its role of the master of the world and the cop of the planet. We have to understand that every single entrepreneur who manages to get a startup going in India and China open the door for several if not many thousand others to get through and become entrepreneurs in their turns. This book shows marvelously how this change is coming to India, through some violence or/and dishonesty of the few who want to get out of the rooster coop at any price and then how throngs of just as ambitious people even if maybe less unconcerned by the means to use come up to the door and push through. It also shows how the old order of a few masters controlling the immense crowd of the servants if not slaves will be able to go on with victimizing the families of the few who will escape their grip but they will not be able to stop and prevent the whole movement that is going to produce in one generation at the level of the whole planet what ten generations produced in the west only  and over two centuries. We are living on that historical quicksand that has completely disoriented even the most stubborn communists who have had to move from rural poverty to urban squalor, from Mao's countryside poetry and revolution to the most stringent urban and industrial revolution, and what's more in the context of the development of services and the knowledge economy rather than the development of the good old steel industry and its sidekicks. And that change is so important that now the first victim of the slightest financial problem at the stock exchange is the steel industry. That heavy industry does not control anything any more and the world is driven by service industries and financial services have become an industry of their own. It is pathetic to see these communist parties or other maoist movements in Asia, India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal and many other countries turn over their coats and try to keep their level of influence by shifting their loyalties and recruiting new supporters in domains they had always considered as negligible. The book is fascinating in that field and shows how the Great Socialist can move from countryside farm workers to urban industrial and construction workers to service and clerical workers, if not even technical and engineering workers. Pathetic for them to abandon the myth of the collective appropriation of land by those who work it to the just same myth of thecollective appropriation of modern technological products and services by those who have the knowledge to produce them, to use them and even to invent them. In fact the key to success is never to get attached to one activity, one social station and always keep in mind and at hand one more or even two more possibilities. Attachment to anything is the end of everything, just like a white tiger who is so rare is nothing but a kitten when kept in a cage. That is the great literature coming to us from these countries who will control and dominate the future. God bless America if they do not understand that simple fact, that easy to conceive truth.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGIDcollective appropriation of modern technological products and services by those who have the knowledge to produce them, to use them and even to invent them.

1400063736|5.0|Colum Mc Cann's almost unique approach to his characters in \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" forms an engaging plot and novel from start to finish.  The characters are bound together by events around them, mostly living their lives independently and unaware of one another.  Initially the novel is structured with long chapters centering on each character's lives not knowing and independent of one another.  McCann writes so compellingly that this style does not disjoint the overall feeling and tone of the novel.  Rather, each character is enthralling and entices the reader with passion and well-written prose.        The plot loosely revolves around Corrigan, a contemporary Irish monk living in extreme poverty in the inner city of the Bronx, New York trying almost single handedly to save the world one needy person after needier person.  Secondarily and as a pivotal background event, is the now unbelievable 1974 true events and minute planning of the tightrope walker who defied death and reason when he pranced and leaped his way between the two World Trade Center towers.  Other bright and talented characters include a prostitute who reads the ancient Persian poet Rumi and \\"takes the stroll\\" with her daughter, the self-conscious Park Avenue resident uncomfortable inviting her less affluent woman's group of mothers mourning their Viet Nam war dead to her home, the artists who tries to recreate the simpler times of the 1920's, and several more.  These characters interact in ways only a talented author could handle. By the end of the book the events and characters pulse off the page with their emotions and reality.           \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" is a forceful and compelling read that pulls the reader in almost from the start.  Colum McCann has done a terrific job of helping us look at society in a deep, authentic, and kindhearted way.      Sheila in San Diego, CA
B00005OCMR|3.0|That was maybe an interesting film when it came out but now it is obsolete and old-fashioned. The \\"plot\\" is too complex to be clear apart from the thief who steals the intellectual property, and copyright, of someone else and gets the profit and the fame for a computer game he never produced. Then the attempt to introduce a super controlling software to take over all games is slightly overdramatic and leads to a messy situation in which we hardly recognize the characters, apart from them being red or blue, because of their costumes or uniforms or whatever that hardly let their noses and eyes peep out of the dark grey plastic. The special effects are today very old and lack a lot of elaboration. They are simple and the whole film becomes humdrum after a short while.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID

B001PUBLF2|5.0|Because it is so relevant to transmitting the feel of this release, I'll recite here the blurb on the last page of the CD insert;<br /><br />\\"A unique recording performed 'one night only' by Scandinavias biggest rock band, Europe, accompanied by a string quartet, this semi-acoustic concert showcases the bands career with re-worked Europe hits, and memorable cover versions of artists that have influenced them over the years.<br /><br />With the production relayed live by global webcast on the night, this performance marks a special milestone for Europe, the result, became something special for the band... so much so, that they decided to release it as a DVD and CD.\\"<br /><br />And it's hard to do a better job of encapsulating what this is all about than the above words. The songs selected all work, there are old chestnuts that I would never of guessed them doing such as Memories and Dreamer (O wonderous day!) and of couse some big hits reworked for the mellower format such as The Final Countdown (huge difference and a great version). Their reformation albums aren't forgotten either, the tunes from Secret Society particularly showing themselves as well suited to this sort of treatment perhaps because of the warmth and genuine craft of the originals.<br /><br />As for the covers, we get an almost inevitable Lizzy cover plus numbers by Pink Floyd, Zeppelin and perhaps the most surprising-but-not-when-you-think-about-it cover is Love to Love by legends UFO. All are nice warm renditions of classic tracks, Europe showing themselves students of the form who are not overawed by these well known numbers.<br /><br />Europe fans really should do themselves a favour and pick this up. It just feels...complete somehow, intrinsically spot on both in song selection and execution with the attendant string quartet and mellower shadings of the songs really bringing proceedings alive.<br /><br />And I'll be buying the DVD at some stage too!
B001PPLIFU|4.0|This Bond movie contained the special effects and car chases we have become used to.  I cannot say that the BluRay version was any more spectacular than the normal DVD.  Daniel Craig plays the part well with a bit of ambiguity as to wether he is more man than machine.  All in all, it was fun to watch.
0810979772|4.0|My boys 9 and 12 love The Wimpy Kid series. This book is a hardcover and is the same size and style as the three other Whimpy Kid books. What makes this book different/special is in the clever arrangement of the first half. The child draws their own cartoons, makes predictions about the future and answers silly true false questions like \\"have you ever put lotion on an adults back?\\" There are even pages for drawing the plans for a dream house and neighborhood. I love that I have found my boys laughing and sharing with eachother what they have put down in their books.     I only gave it 4 stars because the last half of this diary is just blank lined pages for writing. I wish it had more Whimpy Kid type directions such as writing ideas at the top of every few pages. That said, the first half is so wonderful it was well worth the purchase.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|That's the ultimate question that living legend Clint Eastwood asks in \\"Gran Torino\\", thematically, perhaps the finest movie of his long and distinguished career. As everyone knows, Eastwood has aged beautifully as both an actor and director over the past 20 years, and both the timing and venue of his exploration of The American Character (either through planning, coincidence, or a bit of both) is impeccable.<br /><br />With the American economy in meltdown and the auto industry dented badly by foreign competition, retired Ford worker Walt Kowalski tries to keep both his cherished Gran Torino and his way of life intact as the ground shifts beneath him in a newly globalized world. With his wife (and most of his generation) having passed on, and immigrants (visible reminders of Kowalski's time in Asia) representing an ever-larger portion of an uneasy melting pot, Eastwood's newest \\"anti-hero\\" defaults to racial stereotypes as a defense mechanism (as do the street gangs representing various ethnic groups staking out their own turf). Then, suddenly, the neighborhood erupts, as does Kowalski's long-dormant soul, and there's no turning back.<br /><br />Trying desperately to preserve his way of life, Kowalski comes to accept that America's future will have a whole new face to it. Those willing to keep America great may not look like the men who fought alongside him in Korea, but they must be armed with the tools they need to rebuild their neighborhood, city, and country. Sizing up the personal character of his young Hmong immigrant neighbor who \\"doesn't have a chance\\" in warding off the advances of Asian-on-Asian bullying, Kowalski seeks to provide, both literally and figuratively, the personal equipment that this new American needs to successfully assimilate. Just maybe, in the back of his mind, this aging, crusty \\"Polack\\" remembers that, despite all the ethnic jokes tossed around among his circle, immigration has always contributed to the next wave of growth in America.<br /><br />With his soul stirring, Kowalski finally takes Confession, but he leaves unstated the biggest sin of his life: killing other human beings. For the relatively innocuous sins that Kowalski proffers, he's asked to atone with some basic Catholic rituals. But Kowalski has another method of atonement in mind, one that, for someone who professes to be not in the least religious, manifests a very Christ-like demonstration of selflessness.<br /><br />By the time Kowalski devises his plan of individual and neighborhood salvation, he realizes that \\"enemy\\" and \\"ally\\" cannot be pidgeonholed into ethnic or territorial classifications, just as the meaning of \\"family\\" is no easy thing to define. He understands that the model of living that he has preserved for so long must be torn up and that he must recalibrate how he views the world for the good of his soul.<br /><br />\\"Gran Torino\\" is at turns a humorous, poignant, and searing movie with pitch-perfect acting by Eastwood, and an earnest and endearing cast of novice supporting actors. It is destined to be a classic. Even the spate of foul language - which accurately reflects the tone and sound of the streets like Kowalski's all across America - does not diminish the significance of this work.<br /><br />This is a muscle car of a movie that idles in your mind.stirring, Kowalski finally takes Confession, but he leaves unstated the biggest sin of his life: killing other human beings.

B001D2AYCI|3.0|First of all I am a huge huge Sabbath fan and have all original releases as well as tons of bootleg and rare audio and video. That said, I can understand why Iommi may have been less than thrilled about the release of this. I thought it would be thrilling to hear alternate versions of Planet Caravan and Paranoid. I suspect though that these were just place-holder lyrics. Scratch vocals. The lyrics on these versions are really sub par and I doubt Geezer had worked them yet. The quad mix I hear sounds muddy and not good. I don't hold Sabbath at fault at all for this. I just see it as one more example of how greedy record companies are. And it bothers me no one bit that they are suffering now from their own greed and stupidity. And they still don't get it.
B001P9KR94|4.0|I cannot say that I ejoyed this film but I thought it was very good and allowed me to view how another society under a caste system treated its people in an American made media situation.  It also caused me to reflect upon the virtues of the American way of life and to measure its imperfections against another countries way of life.  The value for me in watching this movie was to remind me of how well we treat one another in America compared to a relatively poor country like India where the accepted behavior is to treat those of a lower class with distain and unworthiness.  I could say much more about this film, but I think I have expressed its impact upon me.
B001PA0FF4|5.0|\\"Doubt\\", the movie, opens up the play giving it interesting exterior scenes such as the convent garden and views of the community, but the congregation other than the students isn't really drawn into this cloistered drama. The three participants are keeping this situation among themselves, a church thing.<br />Meryl Streep as the Mother Superior, the school principal, is the avenging angel, courageous, perhaps foolhardy, serving as the accuser, the jury and judge. That's a lot of authority residing in one righteous zealot. Streep perhaps goes over the top playing the heartless, bossy creature similar to the character she played in \\"The Devil Wears Praada.\\"<br />Streep plays a stereotypical Mother Superior, but does it with great dramatic power. The movie makes her into a dragon as Hoffman calls her, and yet she performs kindly acts for her fellow sisters. The other sisters (not Sister James) come out as a rather cloddish, sheepish, too cowed herd.<br />The priest played brilliantly by Philip Seymour Hoffman is the accused, and a superb Amy Adams is the young nun, Sister James, as messenger, witness and catalyst who begins to regret her role in the whole crisis. Hoffman gives two very effective sermons. The way the movie handles his sermon on gossip with feathers is brilliant.<br />We briefly see the boy's mother, Viola Davis, in a bravura performance. She knows and accepts what she is dealing with, a troubled son. A melodramatic wind and rain storm ends the stormy scene between the mother and Streep.<br />\\"Doubt\\" is about ambiguities in faith, in human relationships, in sexual identity, in the dangers of certitude. At the same time while dealing with complexities it has stereotypes and some oversimplistic touches.<br />Hoffman says, \\"There are people who go after your humanity.\\" People who \\"kill kindness in the name of virtue.\\" Streep says, \\"I know people.\\" And \\"I have my certainty.\\"<br />The early and final confrontation scenes between Hoffman and Streep are powerful and well-acted. Is there any compassion buried beneath the Mother Superior's tough, unbending exterior? Is there a genuine conscience there?<br />John Patrick Shanley wrote the stage play, the screenplay, and directed the movie, a tour de force.re any compassion buried beneath the Mother Superior's tough, unbending exterior?

B00011D1OA|5.0|In honor of what would have been Audrey Hepburn's 80th birthday, I take the opportunity to review what is perhaps her best-known role, and if not her best-known, definitely one of her most exquisite.   Replacing Broadway's Julie Andrews in the role of Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, Hepburn brings her own essence to the part, with her shrill bellowing when a wealthy concert patron accidentally knocks her flowers into the mud outside Covent Garden, and when she first encounters the two men, namely Professor Henry Higgins (the formidable Rex Harrison) and Colonel Hugh Pickering(Wilfrid Hyde-White), who will play a major role in reshaping her life.   We follow our heroine through her interactions with her fellow lower class street sellers(As is well-known, Hepburn's singing voice is dubbed by Marni Nixon) and her dealings with her drunken, dustman father, Alfred (Stanley Holloway).   Taking into serious consideration Professor Higgins' boast that he  could help her improve her speech, and consequently, her life's prospects,and pass her off as someone from the upper class, Eliza goes to Professor Higgins' home on Wimpole Street to take lessons from him. After expressions of skepticism from Pickering, who is now Higgins' houseguest, and some antagonism between Eliza and the Professor, Higgins agrees, although his new pupil recoils at certain aspects of life at a new socioeconomic level, refusing to allow the maids, led by chief housekeeper, Mrs. Pearce ( Mona Washbourne)to give her a bath.   It takes some time for Eliza to develop an ear for differing speech patterns. Higgins responds to her difficulties with much insensitivity a lot of the time. The enmity towards her teacher grows, especially amid one revenge fantasy. But Pickering is sympathetic to her.   At one point, Mr. Doolittle pays a visit to the Professor that will alter the course of his life as well.   After several grueling sessions, there is finally a breakthrough, and Eliza goes to bed feeling elated.   Higgins takes Eliza on her first assignment at Ascot, where he seeks the help of his mother (Gladys Cooper), and Eliza attracts the attention    of young Freddy Eynsford-Hill (Jeremy Brett). But Eliza reveals her common origins and the session ends badly.   The smitten Freddy  waits outside Higgins' home for days, hoping to see Eliza, but she refuses to see anyone.   Still, she is to go to the Embassy Ball where she will be passed off as Pickering's niece.   In so doing, she absolutely dazzles, revealing no trace of her origins, and dancing with a prince. When Higgins' former pupil, Zoltan Karpathy (Theodore Bikel) wrongfully identifies Eliza as a fellow Hungarian, Higgins knows that Eliza's transformation is complete.   Yet more strife arises when Eliza, who took all the blame for the disaster at Ascot, received absolutely no credit from either Higgins or Pickering for the triumph at the Embassy Ball. Once again, Higgins reacts with insensitivity to Eliza's feelings, and she flees Wimpole Street sometime during the night, encountering Freddy, a few former street acquaintances, her father, and ultimately a supportive  Mrs. Higgins along the way.   But she has become too much a part of Higgins' and Pickerings' lives during that brief time for  either of them to let her go gracefully. Pickering is straightforward about this , while Higgins hides behind his pride. So what will the resolution be?   Viewers will find it amid a Lerner and Lowe score, performances, and costumes that are as exquisite as any flowers Eliza Doolittle might have sold. Under George Cukor's direction, George Bernard Shaw's modernized  and musical version of \\"Pygmalion\\" still entrances 45 years after its release. A toast to all involved in this \\"loverly\\" production!
B001TJXHZG|5.0|This is an informative book. It has helped me communicate and show appreciation for all of the people in my life (friends, family, coworkers, etc). It has also helped me understand my own \\"love language\\" and realize what it takes to make me feel loved and appreciated by others.
B000002LBH|5.0|The Smiths released many singles that weren't on their 4 original albums, and this stellar compilation features all of the A-sides and most of the B-sides. A couple are taken from DJ John Peel's BBC radio show. Of all the tracks collected here, only \\"Hand In Glove\\" made an album appearance.    Morrissey's lovelorn lyrics and pleading vocals established him as the foremost romantic figure of the 80's, and turned him into the idol of all who felt alienated and lonely. He tosses off some great lines, but my favorite is: \\"if it's not love, then it's the bomb that will bring us together\\" (from \\"Ask\\"). Choose love, people! Johnny Marr's muscular guitar keeps the songs from getting too maudlin. Marr wrote all the music, and Morrissey wrote all the words. The two balanced each other.      When issued on vinyl, this was a 2-record set. It's amazing to me how well all these disparate singles and B-sides from over the years cohere into a complete whole. There's a natural ebb and flow. If they had recorded this in one session, it would be mentioned in the same breath as...(name your favorite much-praised 2-record set by a famous rock band). As it is, it's the best odds-and-sods collection I've ever heard by ANY band. (For those unfamiliar with the term, it means \\"a little of this, a little of that\\".)    Most groups start out strong, only to become less good as the years progress. I'd say The Smiths were good at the beginning, but became great by the end. For me, each successive album was better than the one before it. \\"Meat Is Murder\\" was better than their debut \\"The Smiths\\", \\"The Queen Is Dead\\" topped them both, and the concluding \\"Strangeways, Here We Come\\" was the best of all. Together they comprise the \\"official\\" four studio releases.    There's other compilations of A and B-sides, and several \\"greatest hits\\", but none pack the heat and heft of \\"Louder Than Bombs\\". It's perfect.
B00005K9LK|5.0|One of my favorite albums of all time. Grew up listening to this stuff as a kid but with the remastered CD it sounds so much better. No if they could just rematser some of the other 80's metal bands out there ....
B001TOD92C|5.0|The Wrestler works for me on many different levels. I like how it subverts the standard story formula. Normally in a story about an aging warrior he fights on in spite of his age or other obstacles and ultimately triumphs once again. You are rooting for the underdog to pull off one more victory, with the idea that he can now retire, resting on his laurels, and live happily ever after. The Wrestler looks like it is taking this route, but pulls a detour. In fact, midway through, you are already rooting for him to just retire gracefully. If only he could win back the love of his daughter, win the heart of his stripper girlfriend, and accept his role behind the deli meat counter all would be well.<br /><br />--------------<br />Randy 'The Ram' Robinson: What can I get for you, good-lookin'?<br />Man at Deli Counter: Half pound of egg salad.<br />Randy 'The Ram' Robinson: HALF POUND OF EGG SALAD, COMIN' UP!<br />Man at Deli Counter: Is it fresh?<br />Randy 'The Ram' Robinson: Fresh? Fresh as monkey's breath, brother!<br />=====================<br /><br />After his heart attack, to continue his wrestling career is suicide. But what is he without wrestling? Now it is his ego and vanity that he must defeat. But would winning that battle just be another way of losing?<br /><br />The theme of The Wrestler echoes \\"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night\\" by Dylan Thomas:<br /><br />Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br />And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br />Do not go gentle into that good night.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei plays Pam, who dances under the name of Cassidy. I love how Cassidy/Pam has problems that parallel Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson's. She is also at a transition in life, getting a little old to still be stripping, and it is time for her to retire gracefully as well. The interactions between the two are quite poignant in spite of the crass setting. They are on the verge of making some kind of emotional connection, but can't quite cross over.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke's acting career also holds many parallels to his character's wrestling career:<br /><br />--------------<br />Randy 'The Ram' Robinson: I just want to say to you all tonight I'm very grateful to be here. A lot of people told me that I'd never wrestle again and that's all I do. You know, if you live hard and play hard and you burn the candle at both ends, you pay the price for it. You know in this life you can loose everything you love, everything that loves you. Now I don't hear as good as I used to and I forget stuff and I aint as pretty as I used to be but ****  I'm still standing here and I'm The Ram. As times goes by, as times goes by, they say \\"he's washed up\\", \\"he's finished\\" , \\"he's a loser\\", \\"he's all through\\". You know what? The only one that's going to tell me when I'm through doing my thing is you people here.<br />============<br /><br />A lot of scenes in The Wrestler are sad and pathetic, like the ill attended autograph signing event where the wrestlers easily outnumber the fans. There are also unexpected moments of tenderness, such as the backstage affection between the villains and heroes, or in the parlance of wrestling, the \\"faces\\" and the \\"heels.\\"<br /><br />--------------<br />Necro Butcher: Are you cool with the staples?<br />Randy 'The Ram' Robinson: Staples?<br />Necro Butcher: Staple gun... Not so bad on the way in, except it's a little scary, you know - you got this metal thing pressed up against you. Gonna leave some marks, have to deal with a little blood loss.<br />=================================<br /><br />Though wrestling tells a very simple story over and over--heels fight faces but the faces always win--the film tells a very complex story where you aren't sure who are the faces and who are the heels, and even winning and losing isn't so easy to define. Mickey Rourke used the material here to its fullest, giving perhaps the best performance of his career. Marisa Tomei gave Rourke great support, and her performance was also Oscar worthy. Evan Rachael Wood, as the angry daughter, was also commendable, as were all the rest of the cast, crew, and the director and author.<br /><br />Perhaps Stephanie, the angry daughter played by Evan Rachael Wood, is trying or should be trying to say something similar to Dylan Thomas:<br /><br />And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br />Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br />Do not go gentle into that good night.<br />Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br /><br />SELECTED FILMOGRAPHY OF MICKEY ROURKE<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00000F2L9 Masked and Anonymous]] (2003) ....

B001PJRAUS|1.0|I can describe this movie in one word: Obscene. What began as a clever idea ended as a complete waste of time. A bitter and cynical take on most of our favorite characters and vulgar language makes this film anything but attractive. It was all in very poor taste and I think that Miss Austen really is rolling over in her grave at the preposterous antics of the writers. It drug on for three hours and yet the audience is left with little understanding of these new characters posing under familiar names.

B0010YPTGU|5.0|One of the best Bocelli DVD-s. Great song selection, excellent cast, and superb performances. I especially loved the duettes with Sarah Brightman. Their voices are a perfect match. And Lang Lang is simply unreal. My eyes had hard times folloing his fingers on the piano.     Nice stage, tastefully designed lighting, great back up vocals, and the orchestra just as good as any other performers. All in all, it's a must for any Bocelli fan, and if you like Sarah, well, she's there if only for two songs, but it's worth it.     The extra feature has interviews with Andrea, and others, behind the scene footages, and more. It's great.     The CD has high quality, and has the best songs of the concert. The two together is an excellent value. Get it!!!     I also recommend for any Bocelli fans out there, for most of us who love Andrea we can't get enough of little Sarah either, Sarah Brightman's Symphony concert DVD in Wienna. Andrea Bocelli isn't there, but still... It's her best concert in recent years. Check it out! You'll love it.
031606792X|3.0|I was really disappointed that we could not experience Bella and Edward's Wedding night. I thought that there were more details in Eclipse when Bella was trying to seduce Edward. I think she could have found a way to explain this in a tasteful way instead of a fade to black. I would have rather heard about the sex than the blood and gore from the birth scene. Besides if she did not want to write about sex between these two characters then she should not have married them. I would have loved an explaination about the feathers and the headboard. The baby part really did not make sense to me either. I am glad that this book ended well, I think that if it hadn't it would ruined the whole series for me. I would have liked to hear more about Bella's life after she became a Vampire. I love that she is so strong after the transformation.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|I think everyone should give this album a shot. Weither you like mastodon's previous work or not, this album is a completely diferent animal. The musicianship alone is worth your hard earned money, but you are also given a story about a russian cult, rassputen, and a little boys soul thats lost its way. Ok, maybe the lyrics are a little out there but the point is, have you heard anything like that now days? Especially in todays music scene with cookie cutter bands that dilute the bands that actually have talent. This album can be summed up by 1 over used phrase; Rock and Roll
B001O7JHSE|5.0|AMERICAN HISTORY X is so powerful, so engrossing, so well-acted, that I sat in silence for some time after the last credit rolled past. The message of hate and how it affects generations is something so true and ingrained in our culture that it often defies logic. And so goes this film...<br /><br />Based on the true-life story of a white supremacist, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton, [[ASIN:B000NOIX48 The Painted Veil]]), the story leads us down a path many would probably not rather see, but must see in order to understand what hateful ignorance lay in wait in America (and beyond).<br /><br />After killing some black men trying to break into his car, Derek is sent to prison for several years, leaving his family to fend for themselves. Most notable is impressionistic brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who practically worships brother Derek. In high school, Danny taunts students of color and creates a few enemies that will ultimately be his undoing.<br /><br />Trying to save both Derek and Danny is high school principal Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks), a black man on a mission to salvage the men from hatred (a great role for Brooks, too, second only to Norton's amazing performance).<br /><br />In prison, Derek learns a humbling lesson: those that are supposed to be your friends can be your worst enemies, and true friends can be color-blind. Derek becomes friends with an unlikely laundry buddy ...who happens to be black. The two form a bond based on trust and understanding, and a love for sports talk. Derek is surprised when he actually survives his prison term, only to learn that his survival was helped along by his friend of color. Derek has awakened to his loss of hatred of colored people (and Jews), and realizes that he has to try and save brother Danny from a similar fate.<br /><br />But can he...<br /><br />Edging his way back into the family, Derek distances himself from his disturbing past, but will it be in time to save his beloved skinhead brother?<br /><br />Without a doubt, the film's ending can be viewed as fatalistic. We don't know what Derek is going to do but we are left with an inkling of hope that he'll stay true on his new path. Whether he would or not is left up to the audience to decide.<br /><br />Which is why I remained sitting, staring at a black screen after the credits finished rolling. I wanted to see my hopeful thoughts come true; to see Derek rise up and defeat his demons. I didn't want to see what `might' happen.<br /><br />I hope...<br /><br />An incredibly powerful performance by Norton and an even more powerful message of (possible) redemption ...with a terrible cost.tic.

B001N26GFM|5.0|Alot of people comment on the 'sheltered' nature of the protagonist Bruno, and the childlike naievity he displays, and yes, I would say that the movie has its flaws...but in a larger sense, the movie is important in raising the issue of culpability in German society at large in regards to the Holocaust. It really makes one stop and think about how much, and what, the populance at large really knew about what was going on, and to what degree the wives and children of the men who were perpetrating this knew and how they dealt with it.. The Nazi propaganda machine was a very powerful force, anyone who has seen the films they produced as justification would agree that they are both evil and effective. SPOILERS-(The video made about the camps in the movie definitely made me think about those other propaganda films I had seen. One of the most haunting moments is when Bruno recognizes the stones from the propaganda film near the end.)While some parts of the movie are not incredibly believable... the overall issues they bring up are what is important. I have taken a lot of psychology courses that have dealt with cognitive dissonance and specifically with genocide and the Holocaust, and this movie is definitely a powerful force in bringing those issues to bear. Flaws or not, think it is something that everyone should see.....
B00197POXG|5.0|As good or better than Little House on the Prairie and Christy!  Our family loves it!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I got this DVD in the mail last week, I work out at the gym 6 to 7 times a week and was thinking I will try level 1 and then get to level 2 the next day. I started with 5 lbs weights on level 1.. Well, I could not move very well from the pain for 2 days. I had a heating pad on my thighs for 2 days. She kicked my butt!!. I have done the DVD 4 times now and use 3 pound weights. I LOVE this DVD, I am going back to the 5 lbs for a few more rounds and then will try level 2 next week.     My suggestion for a beginner, do not use weights on your time doing this, if you must, use 1 pound weights or you will be stuck on the couch for 2 days and it might demotivate you. I promise the 2nd time is not as painful.
B001JV5BIA|3.0|I liked watching Last House on the Left, I watched the new version before actually seeing  the original and they are alike in many ways but are also very different in many ways. I tend to like the new one better just because it's more realistic. The part where the mom bites off the guys yoohoo is a nice touch in this old one that wasn't brought to the new one though. All in all this is a interesting movie to watch,if you like Wes Craven then you should enjoy this film!
B00005JLKN|5.0|If you are a fan of \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" this movie is a must-see. In \\"Red Dragon\\" we see how Hannibal Lecter was actually caught at the beginning of the original film and why he is in prison. This film is a prequel to \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" as we get the back story on the cinema's most vicious villin. Anthony Hopkins, as usual, is fantastic as Lecter, but it is Ralph Fiennes who steals this film. Like the original film \\"The Red Dragon\\" has two stories running concurrently: not only are we treated to a great story on Lecter, but another serial killer mastermind is murdering people called The Tooth Fairy, played by Fiennes. It is up to a smart FBI agent, played by Edward Norton, to catch this maniac. Ralph Fiennes gives the greatest performance of his career in this movie, as we see the tortured life he leads, as he was abused by his horrific grandmother who is not seen on film; only her voice is heard in flashbacks. The voice is none other than Ellen Burstyn. Just hearing the grandmother's voice yelling at her grandson gives the audience the background on what eventually made this murderer; there is always a reason behind the behavior. Emily Watson has a supporting role, playing a blind woman who befriends the Fiennes evil character. Oscar winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a journalist who gets caught and tortured by the Tooth Fairy. I won't tell you what happens to his character!<br /> The DVD is in widescreen format, the trailer is included, there is commentary by director Brett Ratner and writer Ted Tally who wrote the original film, there is a great profile on Hannibal Lecter, deleted scenes, and much more. An excellent film that was a huge hit at the boxoffice. Time magazine calls the movie \\"brilliantly darkly seductive!\\".
B001N26GFC|1.0|I do not understand the 4 and 5 star reviews for this movie.  Don't waste your money or your time.  This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  The lead character, Poppy, is 30 years old and acts likes she's 3 years old.  The character is maddingly irresponsible; if you had to deal with a real adult who was that irresponsible, you'd run out of patience within the first 10 minutes.  Plus, for my American ears, it was difficult at times to understand the English accents.  This movie did not have a point or a theme or a story; it was just a jumble of little scenes that made no sense.
0380730405|1.0|Okay, I am NOT the brightest person on this earth.  But even I know that murder is not okay.  Even if the murder victim was a cruel, twisted person who was going to die anyway; its still not okay to murder them.  I can't believe that we, as the reader, are supposed to sympathize with the murderer; and his silly wife.  What decent woman would stay with a man after she finds out he's killed someone?  I would be worried he might knock me off too.  I find I could not even like any of the characters.  I was actually rooting for the 'bad' guys in the end.  The main character is weak, silly, and boring.  I understand feeling inferior or lack of confidence, but she was ridiculous.  And her husband was cold and condesending toward her.  I thought the book dragged a little, but was well written in a technical way.  But having to sit through the main character's constant paranoid imagination was torture.  I kept waiting and hoping something would redeem her and her husband, but nothing happened.  The writer introduces characters that are ultimately useless to the story, such as Ben, the<br />'idiot'.  And then the book ends abruptly.  I guess I can't complain too much about it ending since it was an awful book.  I read this because I had heard from a number of people about how great and suspenseful it was.  Maybe I am desensitized; or I am just too simple to catch on to the 'suspense'.  I do understand that it was written in a time where people certainly thought differently about things than we do today.  But seriously, even in today's crazy world; its still not okay to kill people off.  I would NOT reccommend reading this book to anyone.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|I was completing our series (and replacing a couple of missing CDs) and found this whole series was cheaper than a few discs.  And contrary to what other reviews say - the set I received has subtitles.
0312380852|2.0|The cover is more exciting than the inside information.  This is a very good book for beginners, she appears to do nice work and hopefully, she will do a book with more complicated designs.  Loved the blue bracelet on the cover(reason I wanted this book), but couldn't find it in the book- the pattern might be part of a necklace design.  Instructions cover 1 row of beads around cabs nothing like the blue bracelet.  I have Kris Bucanan's books, was expecting more from this book since all the reviews were 5 stars.  It has good instructions and photos on how to do various knots and has good step by step pictures with instructions for each project.  Would like patterns that use more beads and complicated design.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|This movie was much better than I thought it would be. The story and characters were interesting and multi-faceted.  I was really impressed with both Christian Bale and Heath Ledger.  It is too bad a talented actor like Heath died so young.  Christian Bale is pretty impressive too but his role in this film is not one of star. The other actors in small roles are wonderful and this is a successful big budget movie.  There is the obligatory big noises and special effects and that can be a bit wearing at times.  Still the story moves on at an exciting pace.
B001UREJWM|5.0|Ronnie James Dio.....what else needs to be said?  Year after year, deacade after decade the excellence just keeps coming.  The guy is pushing 70 but is as vital and relevant as ever. Ronnie hasn't liked the subject of his age being brought up from what I've read.  If I were him I'd wear it like a badge of honor.  He is THE father and king of metal.  This album proves that there is no end in sight unless Dio simply WANTS to stop.  Listening to The Devil You Know, it might as well be the early 1980's.  It hard. It's dark. It's technically excellent.  It's testosterone fueled metal that can stand up to ANYTHING ever produced by Dio, Sabbath or anyone else.  I want to see Dio on stage at age 80.  It's where he belongs.
B0027HOBM2|5.0|The second season of this AMC series is in story/character sense a lot like the second season of Sopranos was for itself. This season spends it's thirteen episodes expanding upon what has already been established at the same time as it balances sudden new story devices and taking things to their next logical (or sometimes illiogical based on the character) extensions. I found it very enjoyable and while it may not be a full reflection of life in the sixies it truly shows the aspects that it aspires to quite well and shows flawed characters who are full of unfortunate parallels with people in the world today.     The setting of the sixties is great, it's nearly the perfect era to pair with such seemingly lost and depressed character's because of it's ironic nature at the same time as the literal sense of reinvention and change that occured in that time. I feel the first season did a fantastic job of setting up this series. The second season acheived it's goal of expanding, elaborating and extending upon the world and character's we were introduced to. Now the third season is set up, like most shows, to take the best from the first and second seasons and finally show us a complete vision of the show without being tied down by these mandatory practices.     Season 2 consists of the following thirteen episodes:     For Those Who Think Young   Flight 1   The Benefactor   Three Sundays   The New Girl   Maidenform   The Gold Violin   A Night To Remember   Six Month Leave   The Inheritance   The Jet Set   The Mountain King   Meditations In An Emergency     This Blu-Ray release will be a 3-disc set presented in 1080p Widescreen Video, English 5.1 DTS HD Audio, with Subtitles in English & Spanish.     The Packaging is described as being \\"available as a limited-edition sleek shirt box with see through window\\".     Special Features Announced So Far Include:     -Audio Commentaries With Cast & Crew on all 13 Episodes   -\\"Birth Of An Independent Woman Parts 1 & 2\\" - Featurette examining the rise of female independence in the 60's.   -\\"An Era Of Style\\" - Featurette exploring the fashion of the 1960's and it's lasting influence on designer's today. -\\"Time Capsule\\" - Interactive featurettes paying homage to historic events on the 1960's and the daring generation that lived through them.     I will update my review when/if any more special features or information are given closer to July, when this will be released. I will also update my review when I have actually seen the special features on the set, but for now I have seen these episodes and think there is a lot to be found here for those that want to dig beyond what simply is shown. Apart from that this series looks beautiful and will look even more amazing on Hi-Def Blu-Ray. Thanks.       *Rather than clutter up this Review page I have posted a list of episode descriptions for this season in my comments section for those interested.
B0007TKNII|5.0|It wasn't exact to the details of the book, but being that every actor/actress sang their own part I thought it was great.  5/5 for awesomness.
6304884419|4.0|\\"A Bronx Tale\\" is Robert De Niro's directorial debut and a superb exposition of his autobiographical story of how he grew up in the Bronx in the 60s, written by Chaz Palmenteri, who also plays the chief antagonist. I'm not certain that I've got here the best copy of the film...but that doesn't take away from the story's grip on my senses; it is exciting, quick-paced, well-acted and skillfully edited to show a powerful story of the lethal reigns of neighborhood power. I recommend this movie to all intending to be correctly informed on how our world really works.
B0015OKWL2|3.0|Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro play two long-time NYC detectives who have been partners for years. DeNiro's Turk has a hair-trigger temper and definite issues with anger management. He's counterbalanced by Pacino's Rooster who's an easygoing, funloving guy. Both are tracking a serial killer who's murdering criminals who have not been convicted due to technicality glitches. The investigation points to a cop (this brought up by Rooster) which Turk adamantly refuses to believe. Brian Dennehy (another great actor) has a peripheral role as their boss. Carla Gugino plays a forensic criminalist who is also Turk's girlfriend, and she's just weird in this role. None of the characters were that likeable; therefore, I wasn't vested in the outcome.<br /><br />The pace of the movie seemed lagging and at times just wasn't interesting. DeNiro and Pacino play off one another well but it didn't work in this case. Almost from the start, I figured out who the real killer was - as in any mystery, filter out all the red herrings thrown at you and focus on the least likely one.<br /><br />Hopefully if these two pair up again, the movie will equal their talent.
B000VBIEXS|5.0|I love Classic Progressive Rock!  Emerson, Lake, & Palmer were very creative when they cut this album.  I think that they were the first ones that intoduced synthesizer music to Rock.  It turned out very good in this album
B000OCXMAE|2.0|this album is sad.  it is far from the rockin' Hybrid Theory.  i am very disappointed that i have wasted my money on this one!  they really need to pick up the pace.  i don't want ballads from these guys.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This show has amazing writing, cast, and story lines.  It is not a typical cop drama show.  Every episode provides twists and unpredictable outcomes while giving the audience a chance to piece together the story like an author would.  The chemistry between Castle and Beckett, played by Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic, is impeccable and takes the show to another level.  The supporting characters were cast perfectly, provide humor, as well as more story dimensions to build on.  Every episode leaves the viewers wanting more and hoping for a renewal next season.  Check this show out Mondays at 10pm and you won't be disappointed.  Watch the previous episodes on ABC.com and definitely pre-order Season 1 on DVD!
B00000DOZJ|5.0|The first time I ever heard this album was way back in the mid-70's after getting hooked on Trespass and Nursery Cryme.  This album, however, for me, was Genesis' masterpiece.  As a fan for over 30+ years, this album still gives me goosebumps when I play it... which is a few times a week on my headset at night before bed.  Peter Gabriel's voice and Tony Banks' keyboards are brilliant and it is, and always will be, for me, their best!  I know there are others who would disagree, but I felt then and still feel now, this was their best work EVER!
B0017R5UAA|5.0|Darn good album. Kinda different. I like the vocal harmonics of the band.  It`s kinda mellow,so dont expect this to be a rocking band,but it is a very good album. I`d say one of the best I`ve heard from 2008.
0861714911|5.0|Anyone looking to read a more unfiltered or interpreted version of Buddhas discourses would find immense interest and benefit from this book. Buddhas words stand the test of time!
B000WCBPOG|5.0|This CD is awesome!  It seems as if every song in the movie is on this edition, and since I am a fan, that says it all for me.  Would totally recommend to other fans of the film, or even just for music fans of the '60s.
B000NIVJEU|5.0|This is a fun movie but not nearly as good or deep as the book.

B001EN71DQ|5.0|in 1999 star wars episode 1 was released. it was an ok movie it  showed darth vader as a youth as anakin skywalker, it showed how he was discovered it was a kids movie, episode 2  came out 3 years later it was too mushy but it showed the back story to how anakin began his fall to the darkside and it lead up to episode 3 the fall of anakin skywalker. they were good movies but now that the clone wars tv series has become a hit  and now has left many holes in the prequel trilogy they may have to redo most of episode 3 and maybe the entire star wars movies. if they ever do that they should go the way of how the clone wars is. all in all i still give these series of movies 2 thumbs up
0439023483|5.0|I borrowed this from a friend and now I must not only get myself one, but get them as gifts for friends and family who love to read! I can't wait for the sequel and hope they make a movie. I read the whole book in an afternoon and laughed and cried all through it. It is totally engaging from the moment you read the synopsis on the jacket, and that doesn't even do the book justice.

B001NESPHC|5.0|Melody Gardot is benefitting from a big marketing push right now.  I saw the magazine ads and then Amazon hit me with the special price on the MP3 album.  Good deal!  MY ONE AND ONLY THRILL offered a great soundtrack for a rainy indoor New York City Sunday afternoon, (\\"Our love is easy like water rushing over stone...\\" \\"The rain came down in sheets that night...\\")  I'm not a jazz aficionado (cannot legitimately participate in a discussion of Davis or Coltrane. A reference point: Sinatra's \\"In The Wee Small Hours\\" album gets more play in my iPod than anything by Norah Jones),  But the strings that kick off \\"Baby I'm a Fool\\" grabbed my ear and Gardot's sultry vocals held my attention with catchy lyrics and scat singing.  The songs (except for \\"Over the Rainbow\\") are all Gardot originals. But if you told me this was a cover album of jazz classics I would have simply nodded and enjoyed.  The laughter at the end of \\"Who Will Comfort Me\\" also brought a smile. Gardot's personal story is an inspiration of a separate kind.  She's overcome adversity to make great music, but her success is based on real musical talent and genuine songwriting skills. Having heard the album, I'll be paying full price for past and future releases.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|After reading reviews on Amazon about the thermal shutdown I was very VERY wary about the SB-900's capability to shoot continuously. I've read a few different reviews and thoughts on the web regarding this problem, but after extensive testing and real world application during low light high power wedding gigs I can honestly conclude:<br /><br />THIS FLASH ROCKS!<br /><br />It does not overheat on me and has performed consistently well with no troubles. I've TRIED to overheat this thing by using the strobe modes and blasting continuously with full power and half power flash bursts. I've never been able to get the thermometer above half way.<br /><br />I feel it is CRUCIAL to discuss what my testing condition were however:<br /><br />I shot using four fresh Duracell Copper top alkaline 1500 mAh batteries. This is what these flashes are designed for, NOT high capacity lith-ion batteries. This is a major point that I came across on the web many times. The types of batteries you use severely affects flash performance. I also tested some Energizer cheapie 2250 mAh rechargeables and the SB-900 did not like those. After about two flashes it drained the juice and the flash shut down giving me a dead batt signal.<br /><br />I must point out however that I have NOT tested this flash with a battery pack. It is entirely possible that the continued high power that a battery pack can produce may in fact allow you to shut down the flash much faster. In all honesty though I would be impressed if any photographer was taking THAT many full power shots in succession. Even if your bride is walking down the aisle I think THAT many multiple full power bursts are sufficiently distracting that you really shouldn't be firing your flash that often anyways!! I mean if you're doing more than 5-10 bursts even on a long walk down the aisle I suggest you reconsider your techniques. There is nothing more annoying than full power bursts in excess during a wedding. Trust me.<br /><br />The other REALLY IMPORTANT caveat about my testing, I am using the latest firmware upgrade: 5.02<br /><br />From what I've read I have a feeling that addressed some of the shutdown issues.<br /><br />CONS<br />The one thing I have noted that drives me crazy and I have been unable to find a resolution for or corroboration that it is supposed to do this is the LOUD ZOOM NOISE on the flash. It makes an annoying wheezing sound when it zooms, which if you have a zoom lens on your camera it zooms with your zooming of your lens.<br /><br />During weddings this is distracting and makes me a bit self-conscious. I have read that the unit makes noise with low battery power, but fresh 1500 mAh batteries don't solve the problem. I thought maybe it was just my unit, but I don't think that is the case. I will probably email Nikon support to make sure it's not just me. So if anyone else out there has noticed that and managed to find a solution let me know and post a comment!ing the latest firmware upgrade: 5.02    From what I've read I have a feeling that addressed some of the shutdown issues.

B001IAOEXU|5.0|I heard about this product on a podcast and thought I would give them a try. For five dollars they have solved my major gripes about the playstation three controller. My fingers no longer slip of the R2/L2 buttons and I have actually began to play more games on my PS3. The triggers have periodically slipped off during when setting the controller down, but never during gameplay. For five dollars you can't go wrong with these.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|This show had me hooked from the first episode. The writing was incredible. The characters were funny and quirky. The way the mother and daughter could eat and stay so skinny! The episode when Babbet's cat died and slid across the room was histarical. Loved Luke and Lorelai's relationship;especially the end of Season 7. Best kiss ever. I was so sad when it went off the air. I own all 7 Seasons and highly recommend it to all. Even my husband liked the show. Anyone who wants great writing, whitty characters and good family entertainment needs to watch this.This is a show for all ages and I recommend it to all.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I have been listening to Snakes and Arrows for 2 full years now and I am not even close to getting tired of it. Fantastic song writing and musicianship as always from these guys. I hear that they are going to collaborate with Nick Raskulinecz on their next album which is great news.    I will admit to being a die hard Rush fan and have very few complaints of any of their albums but the only reason I can't give the full 5 stars is due to the digital compression of the high frequencies which make listening at decent volume on great equipment a bit difficult. It is much better than Vapor Trails in this respect though. Hey Engineers, Not everyone is listening to MP3 files. Master the album better! The Band deserves it!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I saw a review of this online as the worlds #1 selling game, and I can understand why! This is fun for all ages and keeps everyone entertained! My family loves it!
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|After having caught the Doctor Who bug after the ending of season 4, I watched hour after hour of Seasons 1-3 in anticipation for Season 4, which I'd heard from friends was massively epic. And as always, it didn't fail to impress.    Voyage of the Damned: A satisfying stand-alone episode. Being an American viewer, I'd never heard of Kylie Minogue and her fame, but I believe it helped to simply enjoy her not as her own person, but as Astrid Peth. All in all, the action was well done and the ending was good, although quite sad.    Partners In Crime: Not only bringing back Catherine Tate and her brilliant portrayal of Donna Noble, but also showing a brief clip of someone very special to the Doctor, this hysterical adventure really foreshadows the fun that is to come with Donna now in the TARDIS.    The Fires of Pompeii: A more emotionally-charged episode, we begin to see the rifts that the Doctor and Donna have between them. The Doctor has become very acceptant of the tragedies that end up massacring a race, whereas Donna brings a more empathic approach to the people. The soundtrack features the song \\"The Sybilline Sisterhood\\" from this episode, which is absolutely terrifying.    The Planet of the Ood: Another emotional episode, we learn of the origins of the servant-race: the Ood; seen previously in The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit. Also, this episode throws in a few teasers for an event that has yet to occur, repeated in the Easter special \\"Planet of the Dead.\\"    The Sontaran Strategem/The Poison Sky: In my opinion one of the season's few weak points, it is saved by the reappearance of the now \\"Doctor\\" Martha Jones. The action seemed to build up, but never quite come to conclusion. However, this is simply my own opinion.    The Doctor's Daughter: We, along with Donna, Martha, and the Doctor, are introduced to the Doctor's daughter, Jenny: an naive yet war-savvy young woman who I hope returns as a companion in the future.    The Unicorn and the Wasp: Sadly, my hopes  of seeing a real Unicorn on Doctor Who were dashed, as the Unicorn is merely the name given to a cat-burglar. This episode also contains one of the funniest moments in New-Who, and possibly Old-Who history.    Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead: Another attribute to Steven Moffat's genius (Blink, The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, and The Girl in the Fireplace), this suitably scary episode features some amazing moments, ranging from tear-jerking, to absolutely terrifying.    Midnight: Tense and thrilling, this episode shows The Doctor's vulnerability and accurately portrays humans when left to their own resources.     Turn Left: My favorite episode of the season, and possibly of the whole series. Catherine Tate shines in her role as Donna, showing an phenomenal range of emotion, bringing so much depth to Donna's character. We also see the return of the aforementioned \\"someone special,\\" who I'm sure had many people highly anticipating this episode. The absolutely \\"brilliant\\" ending made for a perfect introduction to the season finale.    The Stolen Earth/Journey's End: This episode brings together everyone imaginable not only from New Who history, but also from it's two spinoffs, The Sarah Jane Adventures and Torchwood. We also see the return of a villain from Old-Who, and minus a few plot holes, is one of the most epic finales ever. Seeing all the companions together, and seeing all of them leave allows for a glimpse into the Doctor's life: a life of people coming and going, never sticking around. The beautiful and utterly tragic ending had me near tears as we say goodbye to one of the best in the show's history. Simply put, this episode is absolutely epic.    This season is my absolute favorite out of the entire series, and I'm so glad to have caught on when I did. Better late than never!
0545128285|4.0|A fun, if minor, read from Rowling that expands a little on the background of her Potter universe. The Potter books always thrived in the details, so it's little wonder that Rowling's fairy tales are as well-thought out and as imaginative as the rest of her work. The stories completely fit the morality and differing worldview of her magic-using community, and nicely echo some of the classic ideas of fairy tales. Of course, as a fan, what really makes this worth reading is Dumbledore's commentary, as we get a small window into the mind of one of Rowling's most interesting characters. Yes, it's very brief - perhaps too brief for some (heck, I read it in under an hour) - but given the small price and a chance to go back into the Potter world, it's hard to complain too much.
1577314808|4.0|This book presents a new way of seeing oneself and the thought process of the human mind. This book let me realize I was not alone when it came to the negative voices in my head and that Im not alone in being able to change my views on that negativity.  A must read for anyone looking for a better way to view the world and themselves.
1401207529|4.0|A strong, thoughtful Batman origin story that's unfortunately eclipsed by the Nolan Batman films. There's no doubt that, had I read Year One before seeing Batman Begins, it would have blown me away. As an antidote to the increasingly silly, campy Batman, Miller returns to the roots of the character, spinning a fascinating two-pronged tale about the arrival of both Batman and Gordon to Gotham City, as both attempt to cope with and battle the corruption they find there. It's a simple tale, and far shorter than I expected - I didn't realize that it was just four issues long. That being said, there are some incredible scenes, and the stark artwork brings an impact to some of the imagery, especially a shot of Gordon in his house one night. All of that being said, it's hard not to have the shadow of Begins hanging over this, which took on a lot of this and more, spinning an even more complex origin tale, and in some ways, one-upping it. Taken on its own, Year One is an impressive Batman tale, and a powerful one (though Dark Knight Returns is still my favorite that I've read); it's just hard to read it as a standalone entity, and not be aware of what it inspired.
1400034779|5.0|Plot Summary:  Precious Ramotswe, a proud daughter of Botswana, has taken the small inheritance from the sale of her father's cattle and opened her own business, called the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.  With her common sense wisdom, and a detective instruction manual to guide her, Mma Ramotswe manages to find the answers her clients need, even if it's not what they want to hear.  As her fledgling business grows, she hires a sweet-tart assistant named Mma Makutsi, and she relies on her friendly mechanic, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, to keep her tiny white van running long past its expected lifespan.    Have you been feeling a little blue lately?  Down in the dumps and you can't shake the funk from your brain?  These little books are the perfect antidote, because I always feel happier and at peace with myself after immersing my imagination in Precious Ramotswe's world.  Everything is painted in the vivid colors of Africa, and the slower, simpler lifestyle feels refreshing compared to our fast-paced mania of commuting, texting, twittering, and too much television.  I feel at home and connected to the people in this corner of Botswana, and it makes me hopeful that yes, we humans can share something special together when we don't let technology get in the way of meeting face-to-face.  The irony is that I'm writing this to essentially nobody, to later post on a website.  See?  We are messed up over here.  Mma Ramotswe would have sat me down with a cup of red bush tea, and let the words tumble out till the cows came home and I was feeling much better.    There are two utterly charming romances that play out over the course of this series, for both Mma Ramotswe and her intrepid assistant, Mma Makutsi.  Their courtships proceed with awkward, halting steps that ring true in real life, where women usually read relationships like a map, and the men are tongue-tied, wary wildebeests ready to bolt at the first sniff of commitment.  I just want to pat these guys on the head, and tellthem to give it up, because the poor fools just don't stand a chance when these ladies get it in their heads that it's time for marriage.      The novels are fairly short, which makes each installment feel like a brief, sweet treat, and I was ready for the next one immediately, like picking a new chocolate from a box of truffles.  The touching humor, and the powerful reassurance that real human connections are what matter most in life, perk me up like a sunny day after weeks of rain.  If I could choose my relatives (and it's a pity I cannot), I would adopt Mma Ramotswe as a favorite Auntie.      Here's a list of the book titles in this series:    The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency  Tears of the Giraffe  Morality for Beautiful Girls  The Kalahari Typing School for Men  The Full Cupboard of Life  In the Company of Cheerful Ladies  Blue Shoes and Happiness  The Good Husband of Zebra Drive  The Miracle at Speedy Motors
1563894696|5.0|The Dark Knight to Year One's Batman Begins, The Long Halloween tells not only the story of Harvey Dent, but also of Gotham's transition from organized crime to costumed \\"freaks\\" like Joker and Penguin. I enjoyed this a lot the first time I read it, but re-reading it after Year One makes it feel like a nice part of a larger story, and there are a lot of references to the first book I picked up on. More than that, though, Halloween stands well on its own; Year One finds itself co-opted by Nolan, but Halloween tells a compelling murder mystery on its own, in addition to exploring themes of escalation, justice, and identity. It's stronger than I remember it being, and I remember loving it; reading it again, it's apparent not only how much it influenced Nolan's vision for the sequel, but also how much impact it had on Batman's universe, bringing a film noir feeling to a fantastic world. A top notch Batman tale, and I'm excited to finally read the follow-up, Dark Victory.
1560100842|2.0|I was going through my books to see what I have so that I could start practicing character design, I found this in my closet and  started looking through this book.  The truth is, although the drawings are top notch, they are old and out of date. No one draws these kinds of drawings any more. I was totally disinterested and put the book away. Better to get an up-to-date book  published  more recently, check out the books  from erik goldberg, or christopher hart.

B001PPGAIA|3.0|It is a bit amazing that after Michael Bay's Hollywood blockbuster \\"Pearl Harbor\\" there are still ambitious filmmakers out there who are willing to make a grand-scale love romance/action film. Actually Baz Luhrmann's 165-minute epic \\"Australia\\" looks like two movies in one: an \\"Out of Africa\\"-style melodramatic romance between a man and a woman, and a coming-of-age tale of a young boy, all living in the turbulent pre-WWII era in Australia.    In \\"Australia,\\" instead of Meryl Streep and Robert Redford, Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman play the lead roles. Despite her initial disliking for his (apparent) rough manners, Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman), who has inherited her late husband's cattle station in northern Australia, falls for roguish Drover (Hugh Jackman). Because of the contrived narrative device, the unlikely pair joins forces to accomplish one impossible thing - a long journey to get the 1,500 cattle to the port. And this is only the beginning of the long story.    The epic story is told against the background of the country's history. Japanese military forces are poised to attack the country. Not only that. A young boy Nullah, a mixed-blood Aboriginal boy, has to hide from the authorities trying to separate him from his mother and place him in the government's facilities to \\"civilize\\" him, a topic that Philip Noyce has already taken up in his superb \\"Rabbit-Proof Fence.\\"    As you see, so many things are going on and the film doesn't exactly know where to direct its rambling story or when to stop it. When we think the film ends now, it restarts and goes on telling another story, as if teasing us with fake endings. The characters are one-dimensional, but much to his credit, Baz Luhrmann as director seldom bores us with actions, romance and beautiful landscapes. Jackman and Kidman are attractive (as always) and there are lots of talented supports including David Wenham, Jack Thompson and Bryan Brown, plus my favorite actors Barry Otto and Bruce Spence.    Idon't say \\"Australia\\" is a bad film. With Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman it cannot be, well, at least as a romance that is eye-pleasing. It tries to be something more - plenty of action, comedy (intentional or not) and even historical document. It's a pity that Baz Luhrmann didn't settle on one of them.
B0013FXWU6|1.0|This pessimistic movie is not only mostly boring but morbid, ghoulish in parts, coupled with having an excessively annoying, nerve jolting so-called 'soundtrack'.<br /><br />In terms of the aging process of the two main actors in depicting their historic evolution from 1898, until this picture's dreadfully droning, bloody, psychotic conclusion in 1927 -- it does not exist. What were they thinking to make such total rubbish.<br /><br />To sum up, with the exception of the fine cinematography, forget-about-it.
0060935464|5.0|I have been tutoring a sixth grader who does not like to read. I thought it might be above her reading level, but the story has pulled her from page to page.

She will always remember that To Kill A Mockingbird was the book that marked her passage from being an indifferent, poor reader to becoming an enthusiastic, successful reader.
B000002UAI|5.0|This record is often dismissed as the \\"worst Beatles record.\\" I don't get it - this record has everything - great songs, unbelievable harmony singing, well recorded.    It has an attractive simple and natural sound. The songs are right in the pocket - \\"Everybody's trying to be my baby\\" and \\"Honey Don't\\" swing like mad. \\"I don't want to spoil the party\\" has a great relaxed groove.    and the singing!! They never sounded better. \\"Baby's in black,\\" \\"Words of love,\\" and \\"I don't want to spoil the party\\" feature transcendent John & Paul harmonies. Just unbelievable. Makes you feel so good. And with the simple instrumentation - acoustic rhythm guitar, bass, drums, and some tasteful leads (on the Gretsch Tennessean!) and maybe a piano - there is a lot of space for the vocals to shine.    It has a country rock feel. That's a good thing. George has a great time with the Carl Perkins-type playing. \\"Rock on one time for me\\" - yeah! Funny that he ditched this and never came back to it, really.    And here you get the good Paul - no \\"ugh\\" moments.    Don't sell this album short, is what I'm saying.

B001F7MSFM|5.0|Hellboy II: The Golden Army sheds light on Hellboy's ongoing adventures in defense of humanity. An ancient armistice between humans and elves is about to expire as the prince of the elves feels that their adversaries have encroached unto their realms and are in the process of destroying nature and the environment.   There are slight hints of the Lord of the Rings and strong elements of X-Men and Men in Black so the movie falls into the action/adventure category.  What is very interesting about the movie is that the \\"villain\\" is not all that bad and he is in fact right in a lot of what he says and stands for.  Ron Perlman and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least, though Luke Goss and the lovely Anna Walton, as Prince Nuada and Princess Nuala respectively (the chemistry is AMAZING), steal the show! Moreover, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects (!!!), and the music are all wonderful!  In short, Hellboy II: The Golden Army is a film definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! Looking forward to the next one!
B0013N4AT0|5.0|Well, I'm going to keep this short and to the point. This album is an exceptional piece of work.

B001EOQWEO|1.0|Don't waste your money!!!!<br /><br />Apparently based on my experience and a lot of the reviews of this DVD, the three-disc set DVDs are defective.  Considering this is a Disney product, I'm VERY disappointed.  This is my second Wall-E DVD failed at the exact same parts and I've tried it on many DVD players.  Other reviewers I've read tried buying this DVD from other retailers (both big and small) and experienced the same thing.  So, it's not an Amazon thing, it's an issue with the \\"quality control\\" from whoever produced the DVDs.<br /><br />There are some people that misconstrew the review.  I want to make it crystal clear.  People don't read the reviews of \\"Special Edition\\" DVDs to determine if the movie is any good.  They already know that.  People read a review of a \\"Special Edition\\" DVD to determine if it is worth buying the Special Edition.  The answer is a resounding NO.  This is not just coming from me but from other buyers.  This set is defective and Disney has acknowledged as such.  Anyone giving a 5-star review of a DVD that you can't watch because the DVD is defective is doing a serious disservice to other buyers.  It doesn't matter how great a movie is.  If you can't watch the movie on the DVD discs, then it is not a 5-star product, even if it is a 5-star movie.<br /><br />Trying to replace the defective DVD is also a headache.  There's a number you can call (I posted it as a comment to another review) to get a replacement for the DVD.  They still ask you a ton of questions and pretend they don't know what you're talking about until they reluctantly agree to ship you a replacement DVD from the One-Disc version.  Do yourself a HUGE favor and avoid the headache.  Just buy the single DVD version.<br /><br />How ironic is it that a movie that is all about recycling and not producing waste has DVDs that are defective that will in all likelihood end up in a landfill?

1590172213|5.0|After her first night at an English boarding school, Charlotte wakes up to learn that she is no longer in her own body, but that of another girl named Clare in 1919, whose father is fighting in The Great War.    Aimed at 10-year-old readers, according to its publisher, Charlotte Sometimes is surprisingly mature, not just in content but in writing style as well. Any reader can easily see that this is a novel with substance, and that author Penelope Farmer had a great deal of respect for her audience's intelligence, regardless of their age. Charlotte Sometimes can make any reader's heart ache, not with sappy sentimentality (because it does not need to rely on such element), but because its author wrote with a kind of frankness and honesty that we do not usually find in many of today's juvenile and YA novels.
B001TH16DS|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying reliving my youth watching the original Star Trek series, and when I read the reviews of the blu-ray edition, I was excited to make the purchase. All in all, I am very satisfied, but I guess my expectations of the hi-def quality were too high. As I watch closely, the artifacts on the images are visible, and I am not surprised, but still need to give this a 5-star rating, as it is still a far better quality than the old VHS transfers, which I used to own. Here is something to keep in mind: I am watching these episodes on a 42 inch 1080p LCD TV, and when I watched the first episode, I was rather close to the TV, which technically is the wrong way to watch it. There is a recommended viewing distance, which varies according to the size of the TV, and I can see the reason behind this. When I watched the same episode in another room, where I also have the same size LCD 1080p TV, I was able to watch it from a much further distance, and the difference was quite noticeable, as the artifacts were, in fact, not visible at all,or barely, so the saturation of colors, the detail, etc, were far more noticeable and appreciated. The only time watching at the closer distance will not be a factor, is if the movie is filmed in hi-def  and is a blu-ray edition, where even at a close distance, there are no distractions, as the excellent quality of the hi-def transfer is obvious. Even in this blu-ray edition of Star Trek, the \\"enhanced\\" images, were crystal clear, even at close range. It dramatically changed (at the close distance), when the episode began to play following the view of the enhanced image, which is when the artifacts were noticeable. So what I can advise is to \\"keep your distance,\\" and you will certainly enjoy this amazing series in blu-ray quality!

0064430227|3.0|I loved this book when I was younger so I jumped at the chance to introduce it to my 3 1/2 year old.  She did like the book somewhat but hasn't really loved it as much as other books.  For example, her favorite books these days are Pinkalicious, Giraffes Can't Dance and Tikki Tikki Tembo.  TTT was again one of my favorites as well.  The pictures are pretty simple and the storyline is also very linear so I think she didn't find it as interesting as newer books.  Its the 50th year anniversary so you can't go wrong with this classic tale but it can't seem to keep up with the newer flashier books, I think.  As an adult, I think its incredibly clever for Harold to create his world using a crayon and to get out of problems by using his wits and quick drawing ability.  Maybe I should have introduced it a year ago?

B001JRB16U|4.0|The three most most purely astounding things about this 45th anniversary release of Mary Poppins on DVD is how very, very good it looks and sounds, how very young Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke both look - and how terribly shaky his grasp on his Cockney accent really was. In one of the lavish assortment of additional features and interviews, Mr. Van Dyke has sufficient confidence and self-deprecating humor to laugh about this.<br /><br />In watching \\"Mary Poppins\\" as an adult, I was also struck by how very much it was a musical showcase for the two stars, a series of elaborate and episodic set-pieces strung together upon the barest thread of plot: a mysterious and charming governess who appears out of the blue, befriending a pair of children whose parents are too taken up by their own interests to pay much attention at all to them at all. At the end, having accomplished this, she vanishes - again, into the blue. In between these two points, the children's adventures are non-stop. Some of them are very strange, such as the long adventure into the chalk pavement painting, and the athletic dancing of the chimneysweeps on the rooftops of London - though for my money, the world of smoky rooftops seems even more unearthly beautiful now than it did ever before. No one could do cityscape matte paintings better than Walt Disney's artists. The picture galleries are always worthwhile on Disney releases, and on this more than any of the others, save perhaps \\"The Jungle Book\\". And no other movie can do dancing penguins with more panache - although \\"Madagascar\\" does have the edge on doing infiltrating soldier penguins.<br /><br />The extra features are suitably lavish - an all new animated adventure short, about a cat who did more than just look at a king, a look at the Broadway musical version of the chimney-sweep's \\"Step in Time\\" dance, and a careful reconstruction of a news feature about the premiere, full of appearances by stars and personalities what will have your children looking at you and saying \\"Mmm... and they were famous for?

B001O5LVPI|5.0|Kind of nice to have a Disney release about a little girl who isn't a princess, and an adorable little critter who is actually a genetically mutated space alien, as well as being an escapee from an intergalactic weapons laboratory.  It makes an interesting and charming change, all things considered. Stitch has teeth, and claws, the ability to morph into the appearance of a puppy and an uncanny ability to sing like Elvis Presley. Lilo is a chubby little chunk of a girl, an unhappy and resentful orphan who lives with her older sister Nani. But they live on the beach in Hawaii, trying to keep up some kind of family life after the deaths of their parents - a little pool of misery in a tropical paradise. Nani's custody of her little sister is threatened by a supremely intimidating child welfare caseworker - and thinking that a pet might help, they go to the animal shelter. Stitch is hiding there, having scared the living daylights out of all the other dogs. It turns out to be a perfect match - a pair of lonely, unhappy nonconformists, although Lilo is blissfully innocent of exactly how much of a nonconformist  that her apparent pet really is.<br /><br />As with all recent Disney re-releases, the video extras on this set are generous - but somewhat confusingly organized, along the lines of \\"hey, boys and girls, let's throw everything into this and hope that most of it sticks!\\" The longest is a two-hour long \\"making of\\" documentary, which succeeds in being amazingly detailed and very interesting - I did not know that there was entire climactic sequence, of Stitch flying a 747 through a city which was omitted completely. (This movie had been in production at the time of 9-11) There are some games aimed at the younger set, a disappointingly short hula demo and lesson, and a short and mildly amusing short \\"A Stitch in Time,\\" inserting Stitch into a whole series of classic Disney movies. I have to note that the audio of the movie itself is amazing - even on an ordinary television it sounds nearly as good as in a theater. What it sounds like on a high-end home-theater setup must be nothing short of miraculous.ounds nearly as good as in a theater.

B001GCUO1G|3.0|The movie is definitely worth seeing. But if you have ever read the X-Men and Wolverine comics, you may be slightly disappointed from the story that is told in this movie. X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a very huge departure from the origin story in the comic books. I'm not sure why the directors and writers decided to go route that they went, but I guess they had to do something for the people who don't read comic books I presume. Someone they manager to stitch some of the greatest moments of Wolverine's comic book story into a movie. The jury is out on if they threw this buffet of clips from the comics books together in a good way or not. I may need to check this movie out again. Someone they managed to even mess up the origins of other mutants that appeared in the film like Agent Zero, Deadpool, Cyclops, and Gambit. The most surprising stunner of them all is that Mangeto didn't make his way into this flick too, which I applaud them for. This very well may be the end of Wolverine on the big screen, but at least he went out with a bang, two bangs to the head to be precise.
0743297334|1.0|It's somewhat of a mystery to me that some readers appear to have enjoyed reading this. In this book, Jake, a World War I veteran now a journalist, and his acquaintances go from bistrot to bistrot in Paris, then in Spain. They drink and look at the landscapes. Then they go to bed. Then they take the train. Then the have dinner. The most action you get is when they go to fish trout in the Pyrenees; one guy catches big trouts and the other one catches smaller trouts.  On an emotional level, nothing happens either. The character, i.e. Jake, Lady Ashley and a couple other guys, seem unable to meaningfully connect to each other in any way. They really just hang out, drink, date, and then break up. They have some petty conflicts with each other, but honestly, who cares. Usually if there is no action in a novel, at least there is some valuable insights into the human heart; none of that here. Just \\"I felt good\\"; \\"I felt bad\\"; \\"they had a drink\\" and then they went to bed (separately, mind you).  I would pass on that.

B00005221M|4.0|FILM: Having only have seen the theatrical release of Mohicans, I'd always been meaning to pick it up on dvd, and opted for this Director's Cut version. Lots of little things have been added or cut, but the story is the same and the best parts (the battles) have remained intact. I would have liked a Mann commentary, but from what I understand he was frustrated with the prodcution because of studio interference, so has probably since washed his hands of the film - a shame, considering how well it still holds up as a period piece today after being almost 15 years old. But Mann's always been obsessed with realism and authentic detail, and having him explain the lengths he went to for this film would have been very cool. Neverthelees, it's still great to have another grreat Mann film in my dvd library.     DVD: Not a great NTSC transfer, with the over-saturated reds of the British soldiers coats being an unfortunate stand-out. Decent enough for fans.
0783887868|5.0|I have all of Dennis Lehanes books in paperback and recently ordered them all in hardback.  \\"Prayer for Rain\\"  was the first book of his I read. A friend loaned it to me.  I loved it and read it again then went out and  bought all of his books (available in paperback only)!!  I naturally had to read the series in order then, starting with \\"A drink before the war\\".   Recently I started shopping at AMAZON.com and I have ordered all of his books in hardback.

B001LRJH0U|4.0|THE FILM: Good on Ed Harris. Not many people make westerns these days, they're just not seen as a commercially viable genre in Hollywood. But Ed Harris is a stubborn man it seems, much like his character in Appaloosa - a slow-burning western with some very fine performances that flesh out some pretty interesting characters. This has the look of a classic western, but it's also very mucha a charactcer piece. And while it won't satisfy the gun-toting western lovers who prefer a little more action and violence in their westerns, this is about the threat of violence from two men and what they're capable of, and that's enough.     THE DVD: Not the greatest transfer, which is unfortunate for a modern film - the reds are particulary violent and saturated.     SPECIAL FEATURES: The commentary track by Ed Harris and the Producer is very forgettable, with a lot of \\"this is so and so, they did a great job etc\\" which is unfortunate. Ed is obviously a shy, reclusive type who doesn't feel the need to explain everything for the audience. Unfortunately for us, that's the entire purpose of a director's commentary. Perhaps an interviewer to prompt Ed on different aspects of the film would have encouraged him to be more forthcoming about the production. Thankfully, there are some great featurettes (normally the fluff in a dvd but here they provide the meat for the behind-the-scenes effort), featuring sections on the cast, cinematography, authenticity and costume. great stuff.    Overall, the dvd is worth getting if your a fan of the western and are in the mood for a 'real' western, one where a man's reputation is often enough to stay the gun hand of any challenger. A fine film, not quite done justice by a so-so dvd, but for fans it'll do.
B0000041XX|5.0|Like most of the previous reviewers, I grew up listening to opera and Italian music, but never appreciated it. After all, Led Zeppelin, Clapton, and the Eagles were more of my generation. However, when I heard this CD 16 years ago, I never stopped listening. I'm on my 4th copy and give it as a gift all the time. Pavarotti needs no description - truly a voice from the universe. Domingo is strong & secure in his voice. Carreras was very ill during this concert and I noticed some reviewers said his voice wasn't as exceptional as the other 2. It was, given his health at the time. And the orchestra - omg, the orchestra!!! I've listened to this so long, I can tune out the voices and listen to the orchestra on its own - magnificent!!!! This CD will awaken you to the beauty of music and voice. The song selection is comfortable for experienced opera listeners, and non-experienced as well. Try it. If you don't like it, pass it forward. The receiver may just love it for you.

031606792X|2.0|I'm in my 40's and Twilight made me want to feel like a teenager again. Somehow age legitimizes the swoony, besotted feelings Edward and Bella have for each other. The romance of beauty and beast is not new. Social gaps between two attracted lovers have actually been the backdrop of many a romance novels, but Twilight bit me. Perhaps I am a \\"sucker\\" for romance in this case. From Twilight, the story progresses well into New Moon and Eclipse. It's not John Grisham in pace, but the jump from one novel to the other was in pursuit of answers: What happens really to a vampire who loves a girl, loves her blood; a girl who wants nothing else but to be with the most beautiful man on earth? Meyer biggest Trojan Horse in her entry to writer-stardom, is her Edward. She has molded and crafted this being so well for it to be the idealized person one would be enchanted with.     In \\"Breaking Dawn\\" the magic ends. The enchanting Prince charming loses his charm it seems. I don't want to analyze this like some literature student, only to react to it from how I feel about it as a normal reader. It seems like Meyer just needed to tie all loose ends together to resolve the story and beat a deadline.
B000FA675C|4.0|I read this book [[ASIN:B0026IBXBO The Da Vinci Code]]and was truly entertained by the pace that Dan Brown keeps the story moving. The moment the book opens the reader cares about the murder and the protaganists are on the run in the opening pages.<br />Soaking up the drama, the ideas, and the imagery and the mystery is easy.<br /><br />But what I could have done without, was Brown's preference for cliches. Phrases that a ninth grader would have used. Literally, the writing let down the subject matter. And not that the subject matter was treated all that well either. Brown abuses the long winded explanation. And beyond misusing a few methods; his jumps in logic are only outdone by his way of taking 98% of every conspiracy therory on earth and rolling it into one giant mystery that only the protaganists can solve. That takes guts to be so brazen as to write the solution to every conspiracy of all time.<br /><br />Looking beyond the adolescent phrasing and arrogance, Dan Brown, kept me turn pages, or hitting buttons, Because I read it on my Kindle. It is a fun read, eventhogh it could never claim to be an intellectual one.
B000W91RUG|5.0|The thing that endears me to this show is that I have known guys just exactly like the ones depicted here.  The writers must have too for they have the characters down flawlessly.  Sheldon is, of course, my favorite and I want so much to be annoyed by  him but I just can't, you have to love him.  That, I think, is the whole appeal of the show.  You want to be annoyed by these guys but you cant.  All you can do is sit and watch and laugh out loud.  In a time when there is so much stupid comedy, this is intelligent writing.  I hope it has a long run and I will definitely be watching every episode.
6305558167|5.0|[[ASIN:6305558167 Excalibur]]    Absolutely the best movie to date on the legend of Arthur.  It is aptly adapted from Le Morte d'Arthur by Mallory.  The cast is superb, the sets beyond belief, the story is captivating.  I guarantee that you will be extremely pleased for making this purchase.  Enjoy this one!!!!
B00007GZR5|4.0|Years after the death of his two children, a man (Robin Williams) dies and goes to Heaven.  Bereft in her solitude, his wife (Annabella Sciorra) commits suicide and goes to Hell.  The loving husband risks all to rescue his soulmate from eternal damnation.    Director Vincent Ward's film marries visual spectacle to intense personal drama in a manner rarely equaled in film.  The afterlife in this film is mutable and responsive to the thoughts and dreams of its inhabitants, providing many opportunities for magnificent images, and the crew is up to the challenge.  Williams, Sciorra, and the rest of the talented cast provide the emotional core.

B0000257U0|4.0|Although not one of their best selling lp's give this one a chance. It is the first offering with simon phillips on drums (after the loss of jeff porcaro),and with Steve (Luke) Lukather handling most of the lead vocals and adding some great guitar riffs this album offers Toto fans something differant. The band is starting to move in a differant direction with this recording and the result will surprise most Toto fans. If you don't already have this one give it a try.
B001DE29SS|5.0|The film goes beyond the peek and tell.....it is still amazing that RD,Jr. didn't receive an Oscar for this performance.  He has proven, up to the present, that he is one of America's foremost actors, regardless of the off the screen craziness that dragged him down for so long.  The film is very interesting to watch, but it's Downey with his seemingly bottomless bag of talent that lulls the viewer into the false sense of watching a film WITH Chaplin, rather than about him.  The gods of comedy and tragedy have given Mr. Downey a plethora of gifts and it feels good to sit and watch him use these gifts so brilliantly.<br /><br />I would say this anniversary edition has information and insights that only add to the value of the purchase.
B00110K62U|5.0|This DVD of Les Miserables in concert is an absolute winner!!  The only thing better would be the actual live production with the same performers.  Speaking of performers, this concert features the best in each role:  Colm Wilkinson, Michael Ball, Lea Solange, etc.  The singers/actors appear in costume and act out their roles rather than just singing.  BUY!!  BUY!!!  If you're a fan of this show, you will love this DVD.

0375826726|2.0|I sincerely enjoyed Eragon and large parts of Eldest (mostly the parts wtih Roran).  But Brisingr was a complete disappointment.  Eragon's character has not matured.  In fact, he's becoming boring.  I thought the hubris in the second book would turn into humility (or at least the uneasy feeling that he's not really the savior of them all) by the third, especially after his defeat by Murtagh.  But instead, more hubris.  His love for Arya is likewise getting boring.  He comes across as perpetual teenager with a crush.  Personally, I was hoping he would finally realize she's not interested in this book.<br />Roran was by far the more interesting character in Eldest and Brisingr.  After all, he can't magically heal himself, and there's no dragon watching his back all the time.  Nasuada reveals herself to be no brilliant rebel leader, just a by-the-book commander who has to put up with whining from Eragon about every single decision she makes.  She also puts Roran in a position where he is forced to go against orders, and then punishes him for it.<br />To top it all off...nothing of significance happens in this book.  The rescue at the beginning is interesting but once it's over, there is no major plot material for Eragon.  The series should have ended in this book, but hopefully it will end soon.

B000JQUKKU|4.0|Free! It was free. Have always loved this Dickens classic. The story has been done over and over, but here is the original. The flowery form of speech loses me at times, and some references obscured by time. I did try the Kindle2's explantion feature a couple of times, but it slowed down the flow of reading. Still a great read.
B00009RAJJ|1.0|When I saw Bill Inglot's name attached to this remaster I thought, thank goodness they got somebody with a proven track record.  I own at least a couple dozen discs remastered by Inglot, and while I suppose some could accuse him of having a heavy hand with the equalizer, I generally find the results spectacular.  His Dionne Warwick hits CD from a decade or so ago is just stunning.    So imagine how disappointed I was when I popped this disc into my car stereo and heard the flattest, dullest sounding recording I've ever heard associated with the name \\"Fleetwood Mac\\".  Now, granted, Tusk always had a hot high-end, even on LP.  The original CD was delightfully bright throughout, but could certainly be accused of being shrill in spots.  I expected any remastering to correct that occasional harshness.  What I did not expect was for the remastering to dull the sound so dramatically.    Gone are the wonderful details formerly audible in the brilliant guitar work on this record.  Gone is the sense of space and ambiance in the vocals.  Gone are the high, airy harmonies in songs like \\"Sara\\" and \\"I Walk A Thin Line\\".  Mick Fleetwood's wonderful cymbals have been defanged and deflated.  Even the lowly triangle on \\"Honey, Hi\\" has been rendered a square.    All of that sonic goodness has been replaced by an awfully tubby, booming, intrusive and annoying mid-bass.  It sounds like Tusk as played on the cheap Sears stereo my parents gave me in the early '80s.  Horrid.    The only good thing I can say about this remaster is that the deep bass has been enhanced, which it probably needed to be - at least a bit - to compensate for the original's hot high-end.  Unfortunately, with the high-end sanded flat, the deep bass now sounds entirely out of proportion with the rest of the material.    All this clumsy sonic tweaking has dramatically altered the balance of the vocals and instruments in the mix as well, resulting in weird artifacts.  The block work in \\"Honey, Hi\\" for example goes frombeing a minor background element to becoming an intrusive annoyance, like there's a cricket loose in the room.  Christine McVie's vocals are pushed right off the soundstage in several tracks - she ends up sounding like she's singing off in a distant corner of the studio, with the band drowning her out.  The results sound nothing like any prior releases of Tusk - the LP, the tracks from the original Greatest Hits CD or The Chain boxed set.  That's a sign something has gone terribly wrong with this remastering.  You'd think *somebody* at the studio would have noticed . . .    I have to say, I've been terribly disappointed with a number of \\"remastered\\" discs over the past couple of years.  Not only are these \\"remasterings\\" not correcting for obvious flaws, they're frequently introducing new flaws and end up sounding far worse than the original releases.  Botched jobs like this are simply encouraging me to save my money and spend it on something other than records.  The studios really need to get their act together if they want to continue cashing in on the remaster gravy train.
1416914307|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series. I do think it could have been better though. There were characters and plot lines that could have been fleshed out more. I think this story had such great potential and she could have done a lot more with the series. I wanted more of Clary and Jace, which was really lacking throughout the entire series.  Having said that, I still very much enjoyed reading it.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Bought this for my 3 year odl son who LOVES it.  It arrived very quickly in excellent condition.  We watch it a lot especially when he refuses to take a nap but he will lay on the couch to rest and watch this movie.  Awesome movie.
1416972242|4.0|I enjoyed the second book more than the first.  I am finding myself quite engrossed in this series, despite its flaws.  It moves along at a swift pace and I was interested all the way through.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|I purchased this CD with Amazon and it was way cheaper to get it at Target, no shipping charges and you get product right away.  This took over 3 days to get to me.  I am not happy with amazon.com at all and will not purchase from them again.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|The music is great for adding enfasis during a church drama, which was why we purchased the product, a real mood setter. The product came very expiedently sooner than promised by the vender which is always good.  I appreciate the fact the vender gave and kept their word, and had follow-up.
B0013FBS20|5.0|First of all, Will Smith. Next, he made this movie worth every hard earned, economy deprived, buck I had in my account. Awesome! And I think the excercise sequence alone should of been longer....but anyway, it was all that and a bag of chips, a soda,and a burger!
1439102813|4.0|A great book and also very moving. I loved that this book delved into the human lives of those closest to Alice and was able to offer a real life perspective of the disease and how it can affect a perfectly functional family. I really do give this book a thumbs up!!
B001PPLJIQ|2.0|This movie was VERY disappointing. I was expecting riveting performances, a tight script and an emotionally engrossing film. It was none of these. Maybe all the hype affected my expectations of the movie, but I thought it was pretty lame.<br /><br />When I described Kate Winslet's character as \\"a zombie,\\" my husband asked, \\"Was she a real zombie, or are you just saying that?\\" Actually, had she portrayed a \\"real\\" zombie, the movie at least would have had that element of suspense: when is she going to rip Michael to shreds and eat his brains? But nothing like that happened.<br /><br />The sex scenes were awkward and not very compelling (seduction, German-style: have someone stand naked in a tub and rub them raw with a loofah. Whoa, that's a turn-on!) I thought the movie would use the relationship between Hanna and Michael to set up a lot of soul-searching about the nature of evil, culpability, the complexity of human relationships....but even though strands of the plot moved in those directions, there was no follow-through.<br /><br />All of the elements are here for a great novel, and I may one day read the book on which the movie was based. And despite what I've already written, the the actor who plays Michael (Matthias Habich) was really good. (Hence, two stars instead of one.)<br /><br />This is a \\"rent, don't buy\\" kind of movie...but rent it from a library, not Blockbuster. It's worth a buck, not $4.99, for a viewing.<br /><br />And you might want to pair it with \\"Sean of the Dead\\" for a nice theme night.
0844663662|3.0|I never knew much about World War II until novelist Kurt Vonnegut made me feel like I was living during that time.  This novel, Slaughterhouse Five is based on Kurt Vonnegut's own experience in World War II. Vonnegut's writing in Slaughterhouse Five combines a mix of science fiction, antiwar sentiment as well as a great deal of autobiographical detail. Vonnegut is very much like the protagonist Billy Pilgrim.     The writing style is captivating, and he makes his point in an inventive manner. The writing style of this book gives you a sense of the place it is set in. The writing style vivifies the reader's perspective on how tempestuous the war was. His writing was a kind of therapy. He was present at the Dresden firebombing and those parts of the novel are based on his own experiences. But it took him a quarter century to bring him self to write it, and he approaches the traumatic event cautiously, circling around it, trying to keep it at a distance with humor and a matter-of-fact tone that fails to cover the pain. This is Vonnegut's most powerful book.    Billy Pilgrim has an interesting demeanor. He goes from his birth and childhood to the moment of his death. In between he is an optometrist in Ilium, the sole survivor of a plane crash, and a captive in a zoo on the planet Tralfamadore where he is mated to a porn star. Jumping through these times in his life it leads Billy to the pivotal point in his life when he was chaplain's assistant in World War II. Then Captured by the Germans and is present for the firebombing of Dresden.    I loved this book. This book helped me understand our history and how it is so painful to have fought in war. Vonnegut said, \\" Life is easier if we accept our past.\\" This makes me respect Vonnegut more since, he wrote this book even though it was really hard for him to do so. I would recommend this book for teens and older as it does contain substantial profanity and sexual material. This book is a great book to talk to others about because it creates questions as to what started the war, what were the motivations for each side and what they may have thought of the bombing of Dresden. This book is full of passion, and life experiences and is a book no one should go with out reading
0316044695|5.0|This book has moved me in so many ways. But that aside, it was a great book to read. I loved the way the book was structured with his background and training and the mision. This is factual versus fiction so it really keeps you interested and will touch you deeply.  I really liked that he took the time to express his opinion on the liberal media and especially the issue of hindering combat operaions by tools such as the geneva convention and rules of engagement.  As a Navy Wife and a Texan I recommend this book to anyone looking for a raw tale of bravery, courage and thought provoking factual account of what our boys go through. Marcus is my hero and I am humbled by his service and dedication to his country. I hope more people will become aware of the manipulative tactics of the liberal media and what diplomacy has done in tiying their hands(our boys)behind their back in front of lunatics that would blow their mother to slaughter te \\"infidels\\"
B001CIPU3G|5.0|I've been a long-time fan of Trivium. 'Ember to Inferno' was one of the first metal albums I ever purchased. They are one of the bands that took me away from my old punk rock roots and threw me into the hardcore and metal scene.    I've yet to hear a bad Trivium album. But that's just me. 'Ember to Inferno' was raw and I loved it. 'Ascendancy' was absolutely amazing and blew me away when I first heard it. 'Crusade', in my opinion, was better than the first two albums. I don't know if it was the melodic vocals or the more fine-tuned guitar playing and solos, but I loved (and still have in my CD cycle) 'The Crusade'.    At first, I was skeptical of 'Shogun'. On my way home from the CD store, I played thru a few songs and didn't get knocked off my feet like I did with 'Ascendancy' or say 'Man, this is going to be a good CD' like I did with 'The Crusade'. I was kind of blah. But that changed.    After a few listens, I have become religious in my views that 'Shogun' is the greatest album put out in the past 10 years. Call me crazy. I'm not a huge fan of many other genres, but in my own little world of punk and metal and hardcore, I can honestly say no other album out has made an impression on me like this one.    Check out 'Into the Mouth of Hell We March', 'Throes of Perdition', and 'Shogun' if you haven't yet. The whole album meshes well and has an awesome vibe, I guess you could say, thru-out.     5 stars is simply not enough for this amazing album. I doubt they can top this one, but I'm anxiously awaiting the next Trivium release.
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|I guess this kind of movie speaks to a certain kind of sensibility that I simply do not and cannot share. Everything is so one-dimensional: the characters, the plot, the look. It is relentlessly and mindlessly violent. It seems to have only one emotion to express and that is one of rage. It is like an orchestral arrangement where every instrument is playing on every beat of every measure. My Batman comics from the '60s display greater dynamics in emotion and execution. And since they were written for your average ten-year-old, what type of mentality is a film like this supposed to reach?
B001CDLATE|4.0|No words to describe this other than beautiful, breath taking & gorgeous. It shows how we as humans are so different yet so alike. And how fragile and small we really are. It should be required viewing for everyone at least once.
B001TH16DS|5.0|This set is a showcase for Blu-Ray.  Having watched Star Trek in its original broadcast form, in reruns, on tape, laserdisc, and DVD, Blu-Ray tops them all.  The level of detail and richness of color is stunning, especially for a show of this vintage.<br /><br />Star Trek is an excellent series for showing off what Blu-Ray can do.  The show was produced at a time when color TV was still relatively new.  Most shows had only recently converted to color, and the producers of Star Trek designed a production bursting with bold, bright primary tones, rich blues, bright reds, deep blacks.  On Blu-Ray these colors stand out like never before.<br /><br />With the unprecedented detail, one can appreciate the technical details that contributed so much to Star Trek's success: the color schemes, the lighting, the photography.  Like so many people my age, I have seen these episodes innumerable times, but this is like seeing them first-run all over again.<br /><br />The new FX inserts --- mostly shots of the Enterprise in space, or orbiting a planet --- are genuine HD, and they're a real treat.  Still,  you have the choice of watching the episodes with the new special effects, or with the original shots.<br /><br />The first season of Star Trek is particularly enjoyable, as the episodes are almost universally excellent.  I could do without \\"The Corbomite Maneuver\\", a crude rough draft which was the first episode produced; and  \\"The Alternative Factor\\", botched through sloppy editing.  But the others are all fine examples of pulp SF storytelling. There are more guest stars in supporting roles as crew members, giving the viewer more of a sense of life on a starship.  (The second and third seasons focus more on the lead roles, with crew members mostly security men who are mere phaser fodder.)<br /><br />With the deep discount Amazon is offering, this is, as the alter ego of Khan Noonian Singh once said, \\"Truly an uncommon value.\\"
B00003CXC6|5.0|Without doubt, Akira Kurosawa is one of the greatest cinematographic directors of all time.     He is a master in delivering a complex message in mind-penetrating fashion. He reveals to us the onion's innermost by carefully dissecting away each layer from the surface, providing us with a clear view of the layer underneath.     Rashomon is a story about the truth and the frustrating difficulty of finding the facts even in a seemingly simple event. A spectator tells the story. A judge must decide on a crime based only on testimony. He finds as many accounts of the crime as there are parties involved. Each story is different. In the end, the judge is left with as many realities as there are people involved. The contradictions of the witness accounts are so irreconcilable that they drive the story's teller mad. Kurosawa reveals the limitations of our mind to grasp actuality. The quest for truth in the story of mankind is a never ending journey.     I have written more about Kurosawa's movies here:  [...]
1416550534|4.0|\\"The House at Riverton\\" opens in the years before the First World War, with Grace, our narrator, beginning her career of service as a housemaid at Riverton, a great English country estate.  Grace is immediately drawn to the children of Riverton--David aged 16, the eldest, Hannah, a boisterous girl of 14, and Emmeline a shy 10 year old.  Grace feels an immediate connection with the children, and longs to be included in their secrets.  Over the next several years she becomes closer to them, first as they visit the house, then after the death of their grandfather and uncle in the Great War, which leads them to take up permanent residence in the house.  Hannah marries soon after turning 18, and decides to take Grace with her as a ladies maid.  After marrying, Hannah's life slowly unravels, and she takes Grace with her into her decline.  Grace escapes, but only with the knowledge of a terrible family secret.<br /><br />Kate Morton is an excellent storyteller, and she does a fantastic job slowly unfolding the secrets of \\"The House at Riverton.\\"  I thought I had figured out the \\"twist\\" in this book, but was surprised in the end to find out I had gotten it wrong.  Her description of life during and after WWI in England feels authentic, and she does a great job capturing the emotions of the different characters.  I do wish she had given us a little bit more about Grace--throughout the novel Grace hints at all of the wonderful things she has done in her life, and I would have liked to read more about them, instead of the novel focusing exclusively on Grace's interactions with the doomed Hartford sisters.<br /><br />I came to this novel after reading Morton's more recent \\"The Forgotten Garden\\".  If you enjoyed that book, I think you won't be disappointed by this one.
B001GCUO1G|4.0|Seeking to further capitalize on the popularity of Marvel's favorite mutant group, \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" is a prequel of sorts to the X-men trilogy. I'll get right to the point, if you thought Bret Rattner's \\"X-Men Last Stand\\" was a mockery of the franchise, then \\"Wolverine\\" provides some redemption. This latest spin-off won't exactly offer anything groundbreaking but it is an improvement over Rattner's version. Director Gavin Hood`s (King Solomon`s Mines, 2004) \\"Wolverine\\" is just popcorn entertainment that combines the usual Hollywood fare with some comic book references.<br /><br />Logan was born in the 19th century. He was in puberty when his mutant powers began to manifest itself and his life had a tragic twist when his father died. Being endowed with a fantastic healing factor that slows his aging, Logan (now played by Hugh Jackman) and his companion Victor Creed (Liev Schreider) fought many wars for many decades. After being recruited by a sleeper group led by colonel Stryker (Danny Huston) for an unknown mission. Differences caused Logan to abandon his post and he finds a simple but quiet life with a beautiful woman named Kayla  Silverfox (sexy Lynn Collins). But Logan's past have caught up to him that resulted with his beautiful girlfriend being killed by Creed (who would later become Sabretooth). Logan is thristy for vengeance as he agrees to be part of a \\"weapon X\\" program that would further enhance his mutant powers.<br /><br />The screenplay by David Beniott and Skip Woods combines the usual Hollywood mechanics such as revenge, love and betrayal to references from the comic book. The film carries some strong ties to \\"Origin\\", \\"Weapon X\\" and even issues from the X-men comic series. The film has its share of \\"iconic\\" comic book scenes. However, the film doesn't have any blood or gore as portrayed in \\"Weapon X\\". Familiar characters are a welcome treat to comic book fans as we see Gambit (Taylor Kitsch), Deadpool (?) (shortly played by Ryan Reynolds) and William Stryker. Those who are \\"X-men veteran readers\\" would recognize Emma Frost, the Blob, Cyclops and the appearance of Logan's lost love Silverfox; these references are indeed a good part of our favorite \\"canucklehead`s\\" life. \\"Weapon 11\\" and Xavier also makes an appearance. I was a little disappointed that the film didn't touch on Logan's time in Japan, but I suppose that if it did, it would slow the film's pace too much. The film also touches upon the element of friendship as brought into exposition by Creed and Logan's relationship. Creed loses a part of his humanity with each kill, and Logan tries to hold on any remaining sense of humanity. Creed embraces this fate he believes is his destiny while Logan only wants to stay within his brand of morality.<br /><br />The direction by Gavin Hood was decently played and does feel energetic. Hood manages to keep the film's pace very compressed and full of forward momentum in its 90+ minute runtime. While the film is undoubtedly crippled by certain blunders and some holes, Hood manages to keep the film moving that viewers will take notice of its entertainment value much more than its very simple plot. Th appearance of its characters does pay some welcome \\"tribute\\" to the comic books but most of them did feel absolutely unnecessary than to be a simple comic book eye candy since there are too many to develop. Director Gavin Hood revitalizes the screen with elaborate stuntwork, cool fight sequences, great CGI effects, and a lot of explosions--all in an attempt to cover up its very weak plot. The performances were decent for the most part, although I thought Stryker made for a somewhat underwhelming villain. Danny Huston was good but not entirely convincing. Liev Schneider made a good \\"Victor Creed\\" and his chemistry with Jackman was pretty palatable. Jackman well, is Jackman, he looks and feels the same as in the X-men movies.<br /><br />We will see Hugh Jackman all pumped up and oiled up to emphasize his nice physique, complete with \\"macho\\" posturing and facial expressions that look very reminiscent to the renderings of Jim Lee and John Byrne in the X-men comic series. Jackman does deliver as our favorite \\"canucklehead\\" although we have to take note than Logan should be a lot shorter, hairier and stockier than the actor. There is plenty of action scenes to be had with \\"Wolverine\\". The encounters with Agent Zero's group as Logan slices through a helicopter and Humvees are very cool to watch. The final encounter with Logan and Creed could've been a lot better and I thought it ended in a very perfunctory manner. The brawl on top of reactor was the exact exclamation point that Hood was looking for and he does somewhat achieve his goal.<br /><br />I suppose \\"X-men Origins: Wolverine\\" does provide a credible backstory (considering Bryan Singer's groundwork) to our favorite mutant. Keep in mind that this is your usual Hollywood serving, beautifying up the film, and stays safe to be within the guidelines of PG-13. It does try to stay faithful to its source material but it does have its weaknesses. The action proves to be a good diversion and would likely impress action junkies. As a film, it does not offer anything memorable, but at least its wasn't too much of a travesty as \\"..Last Stand\\" was. Yes, it is better than Rattner's take of the X-men franchise but won't approach the status of becoming an instant \\"comic book adapted classic\\". \\"Wolverine\\" won't reinvent the X-men franchise but thankfully it doesn't hurt it either.<br /><br />Recommended! [3 ½ + Stars]turing and facial expressions that look very reminiscent to the renderings of Jim Lee and John Byrne in the X-men comic series.

There is plenty of action scenes to be had with \\"Wolverine\\". The encounters with Agent Zero's group as Logan slices through a helicopter and Humvees are very cool to watch. The final encounter with Logan and Creed could've been a lot better and I thought it ended in a very perfunctory manner. The brawl on top of reactor was the exact exclamation point that Hood was looking for and he does somewhat achieve his goal.     I suppose \\"X-men Origins: Wolverine\\" does provide a credible backstory (considering Bryan Singer's groundwork) to our favorite mutant. Keep in mind that this is your usual Hollywood serving, beautifying up the film, and stays safe to be within the guidelines of PG-13. It does try to stay faithful to its source material but it does have its weaknesses. The action proves to be a good diversion and would likely impress action junkies. As a film, it does not offer anything memorable, but at least its wasn't too much of a travesty as \\"..Last Stand\\" was. Yes, it is better than Rattner's take of the X-men franchise but won't approach the status of becoming an instant \\"comic book adapted classic\\". \\"Wolverine\\" won't reinvent the X-men franchise but thankfully it doesn't hurt it either.     Recommended! [3 ½ + Stars]
B000A2H8WQ|5.0|Such a favorite of mine, that I've played the tape to death (almost literally) & had to replace it with the CD.To quote a line from DIZZY GILLESPIE on one of the tracks,\\"That's how music is supposed to sound!\\"
B001GSV3EC|5.0|The preceding reviews speak volumes concerning why all people who love good music ought to buy this DVD. Jeff Beck is untouchable here. But, more importantly for me (an old guitar enthusiast now in his sunset years), all these players are obviously having a great time. This DVD will not, as so many of my other great music concerts do, end up collecting dust on my shelf after one or two plays. Enjoy this one, over and over again!
B001QOOCTE|5.0|If you are old enough to operate a cd or dvd player,then you should walk...no.. run to the store and purchase this package. Buy this and your life will be more whole. Warning: Anyone that reviews this with less than 5 stars, I will come to your home,chain you to the wall, and play Starland Vocal Bands'  \\"Afternoon Delight\\" until you pass out!!(of course that may only be one or two plays!)  Seriously,this is a strong candidate for a Special Grammy consideration. Nuff said...now go buy it. LOL.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|I sometimes wonder if my fondness for this film stemmed from the fact that I first heard about it in Australia and I was missing it so much. But anyway....<br />I knew this was a long film when I went and I was very worried at the beginning. Now that I own the DVD I'll be skipping the first twenty minutes or so. The scenery is outstanding, as are the costumes. However the movie begins to drag on occasionally, but nothing as bad as the first half-hour.<br />The tie-in with Wizard of Oz was very creative and an interesting juxtoposition as well as a play on words.<br />I really enjoyed most of the film. I do not feel that it is a family film, there are some gruesome scenes, implied sex scenes, and intense action.<br />It has seemed to have lost a little of the granduer on my little television with regular sound. But I still find it awesome in execution. Well worth a look, especially for people who enjoy epics, Hugh Jackman, or the marvelous land of Oz.
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|This is actions packed movie starring Angelina Jolie, Morgan Freeman and James McAvoy.

Until one day he runs into a beautiful woman (Jolie) who turns his life around.

B00006AW2J|4.0|I think that some folks are confused about sacd releases. Some of them are in the 5.1 surround format, ex. Pink Floyd's dark side of the moon and the Carpenter's greatest hits. Others like Beggars banquet and also the Stones Through the past darkly, are not 5.1. They're sacd stereo and if you try to play it like a surround cd, it won't sound good. Anyway the Stones' music was not recorded with the same attention to detail as other recordings from that genre (Beatles, Pink Floyd, Motown) So trying to get more detail from sources that just did not have it is impossible.
0684857219|5.0|This book exceeded all of my expectations and is an amazing value.  It really is a comprehensive encyclopedia of how to build your body in a proven and safe manner.  It also covers how to eat, when to eat, and what to eat in order to maximize your health and strength.      One of the key features of the book is a listing of bodybuilding excercises with a very detailed explaination of how to perfom the excersise with the correct form - maximizing the effect and minimizing injury.    Highly recommended!
B000002IZ4|5.0|Stone Temple Pilots are amazing. My two favorite songs on this albumn are Interstate Love Song and Big Empty. The CD was in great condition when I got it.
B001GKJ2E8|2.0|Ouch this was horrible !<br /><br />The premise and idea for this movie was a good one, thus is had great potential.<br /><br />However it was totally ruined by......<br /><br />1) Way too much silly CGI and unrealistic action scenes that felt like a real-life Bugs Bunny cartoon.<br /><br />2) Campy and Cheesy humor like hitting somebody with a keyboard and having the flying letters off the keyboard form words in slow motion on the screen in Matrix-like fashion.<br /><br />3) A plot that took a second seat to special effects and thus was as deep as a thimble of water.<br /><br />If this same story had been filmed in a serious manner, it would have probably been very,very good ----- but instead it bounced around between serious, campy, cheesy, spoofy to the point that it seemed the movie did not know what it wanted to be.<br /><br />Ouch... this was just painful to watch.<br />A totally forgetable movie.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|It all starts desperately slow and after 45 minutes the plot is nowhere to be found - after exhaustingly slow scenes of undressing and love making between two not bodies that were anything but attractive to the eye. Despite this long and painful start the story truly takes form about an hour into the movie and from then on the excellent acting accelerates and makes for a great experience.<br /><br />The moral questions that are raised subtly rip to the heart and appropriately are not attempted answered leaving the viewer with some serious contemplation afterwards.<br /><br />Approaching 5 stars for the second half but not possible to give more than a small 4 in total in light of the unneccessarily long and painful start.
B001UREJWM|5.0|Have we heard all these power chords and flatted 5th riffs before? .... YES<br />Does this sound a little like DEHUMANIZER PART 2? ...... YES<br />Do a few of the songs sound a little the same ? ......... YES<br /><br />Is it better than 98% of the stuff being released by younger bands today?<br />.... OH YEAH !!!<br /><br />It is a little strange, over the past 2 years we have seen 63 year old Stallone bring ROCKY and RAMBO back to the screen with better stories and better hard, strong action than any of the newer action heroes out there.<br /><br />We have seen 78 year old tough guy Clint Eastwood in GRAN TORINO be tougher and more heroic than all the young action heroes out there.<br /><br />Now Iommi, Dio, Butler and team have released a new HEAVEN & HELL (aka Black Sabbath MKII) album that is better than 98% of the stuff being released by younger bands these days !!<br /><br />I guess the old adage that we are over the hill at 40 is no longer true......... these older verterans in their 50s, 60s and 70s are kicking the rear ends of those 1/2 their age !!<br /><br />Oh yeah !!!!<br /><br />In addition to the CD for the car, I will have to also convert these songs to MP3 for my headsets at the gym.<br /><br />Good job blokes !!
B001U9BRNE|5.0|Totally amazing DVD..Never realized David Foster had writing so many great songs....Buy this and enjoy it with someone you love !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0743298039|5.0|FINALLY!!! I never was able to predict what was going to happen! I could hardly set the book down! As an older sister the veiw of protector, best friend and comrad in arms was true without a doutb! you will be seriously at a loss to miss out on this read!
B001UREJWM|1.0|I never liked Black Sabbath or Dio, for that matter. Their riffs were simple, the vocals, whether it was Ozzy or Dio, were annoying, and they could not stand up to the riffs of St. Anger or the vocals of Chad Kroeger. When I heard they were combining into a new band, I hated that, but I had to take a listen.<br /><br />As usual, they suck! Nothing original here, folks. Just a bunch of men who still think that they can rock out while remembering to take their Benefiber in the mornings and their bone strength pills at night, before taking out their dentures. The name of the song Bible Black is clearly a ripoff of the children's anime of the same name, but they take the show's squeaky-clean image and make it Satanic. Shame on these people.<br /><br />For a good album by the old band, Black Sabbath, get Forbidden.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|The same Jeff Beck \\"back-up band\\" is together on EC Crossroads and I did not think they could top their performance there. From the very first song on this DVD I was stunned at the sound recording quality. All four musicians are in top form and obviously having a great time. Vinnie proves once again that he is one of the greatest drummers, ever. Without a doubt, one of the best DVD purchases I've ever made.
B000000HRP|5.0|This was Phil Collins at his absolute best. There's so much strength in his drumming skills, it's hard to believe that this was the same drummer from Genesis. Brand X has that \\"Unorthodox- Funky\\" sound.
6304698690|5.0|I love this movie so much, that I just bought it for a friend of mine. My copy is so old its in VHS. This edition of the Secret Garden has an artistic spin on a classic tale. The scenes in the Garden are beautiful, as are all the scenes in the area of Mistlethwaite Manor, and the music is fitting for all scenes.     Shopping on Amazon.com, this movie was easy to find and reasonably priced.
B001UEZ28A|5.0|I have been listening to this CD since its initial release.  I don't have to work hard to convince myself that this is \\"worth the effort\\".  To me this is simply a brilliant collection of music that never gets old or stale.  Not only is the orchestration exquisite, but Elvis' vocals, though strained, are distinctive and riveting.  To fully appreciate this CD one must clear an hour or so to sit with the lyrics in hand.  This is not for casual listening, but it is a delight for the ears and the mind if proper attention is paid.  A work of true genius!!!!!!
B001PPGAIK|5.0|This is just an all around good movie. I've liked Baz Luhrmann's other films, and this one doesn't disappoint. Great story, music and acting all around.
0321525655|5.0|Anyone looking for a new way to avoid death by powerpoint will need this book. The philosophy behind this is clearly explained, pictures for comparison are excellent. You will be motivated!
B001R4MEYI|4.0|This album is a lot more jammy than its predecessors, which followed closer to the typical metal release.  Its liable to turn off the typical metal guy who thinks he listens to all kinds of different music, but in reality, likes his metal to sound the same.      I think the vocals will keep this from becoming a massive crossover hit.  It'll probably in the eyes of history be relegated to DRI status, re:  Crossover.  A bunch of people will argue about it, but it really won't have an impact out of a few genres of indie, metal etc. . . you won't see too many people who listen to predominantly country or hip hop get turned on to this album.  It'll piss off those from the normal fanbase.      The music is great, the songs are relatively long, the concept is wack.  But I like it.  Would have to put it in my top 10 of 2009 list, but we're only 1/3rd of the way there.
B000UG4LYU|4.0|After the seventies, David Bowie became perversely better at working on other people's projects rather than his own albums.  From his collaboration with Pat Methany (\\"This is Not America\\") to the Labyrinth soundtrack to Tin Machine to tracks with Adrian Belew (\\"Pretty Pink Rose\\") - Bowie seemed to return to artistic form effortlessly each time, slipping into different identities and musical styles.<br /><br />\\"The Buddha of Suburbia\\" was probably the best of the lot.  It reminded me a lot of David Bowie's Low period.  Albeit more accessible and zen like, Bowie seems at absolute calm here and channels the inner Buddha in him.<br /><br />This is indeed Bowie's forgotten album, and a quiet masterpiece.  I think Mr Bowie should actually do more concept albums for other people and lose himself just a little more like this.<br /><br />The Nineties saw Bowie trying to reclaim his blunted edge, and for a moment in time, he found this oasis.
B00004HYLF|5.0|This has to be one of the best cd's of it's type in the world. I love RTF. Not only that the cd was BRAND NEW!!! I am enjoying this. Thank u and I would buy from you again!!!
B001LXIDVS|5.0|As soon as Marty and Doc get ready to go back to 1985 from 1955, the Delorean is hit with a lightning bolt and sends Doc somewhere in time. As Marty is standing there in 1955, confused on what to do, a mailman comes up to him, handing him a letter addressed to him, from 1885, from Doc. The letter says that he hid the Delorean in a cave, and to use it to get back to 1985 and to not come to 1885 to rescue him. But when Marty finds out that Doc dies from a gunshot to the back, he decides to not listen to Doc and head back to 1885 to save Doc from dying. But when he arrives in 1885, he busts his fuel line, leaking out all the fuel. And in 1885, there is no gasoline. So while Doc and Marty try to figure out how to get back to 1985, they must also try and not die by the gun of Buford \\"Mad Dog\\" Tannen, the relative of Biff.<br /><br />While part 3 feels like part 1 and 2, it almost feels totally different. It being more of a western has a big hand in that also. And I love westerns, so I love part 3. Honestly in my review of part 2, I said part 1 is probably my favorite, but I really don't know. I love all 3 parts equally because even though they all have the same premise, they are all so different at the same time. In part 3, I absolutely loved the character of Buford Tannen. He was absolutely hilarious. And he really felt like he was a bad guy from back in the west. The way he talked and the way he looked. I also liked how a lot of part 2 hinted at parts of part 3 (since they were both made back to back). For instance, Marty sees a picture of his great grandfather in part 2 and he says something like \\"Good looking guy\\", but in part 3 we find out it was really Marty himself. And definitely one of my favorite parts of all 3 movies is here in this movie. The final scene with the train trying to get the Delorean to the future was done really well.<br /><br />For the final part of the trilogy, I really couldn't have asked for more. Definitely a great ending to a great trilogy that will be loved for a long time by children and adults. OWN THIS!<br /><br />P.S. - So why didn't Marty and Doc just go to the cave that Doc put the Delorean in to siphon gas from it to put it into the Delorean that needed gas instead of trying to use a train to get it to the future. DOH! =)loved for a long time by children and adults. OWN THIS!      P.S. - So why didn't Marty and Doc just go to the cave that Doc put the Delorean in to siphon gas from it to put it into the Delorean that needed gas instead of trying to use a train to get it to the future. DOH! =)
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|America has a conservative political idea that less government is better government, because government supposedly provides services less efficiently than capitalist enterprise. Thus private health insurance should provide better medical care than a national health care system such as in Canada, England, and France. Michael Moore makes the case that in fact health care, even for the insured, is poorer in America. He cites many cases where an insured person's medical condition is not covered, or his share of the expenses is exorbitant. In my own case I am under Medicare, but I must still pay several thousand dollars for medication. Moore's movie should help conservatives rethink national health care.
1591841151|4.0|Anybody who's started a business (that they were passionate about) not only intended it to be successful but also hoped to change the world in some way.  In his book - \\"The Art of the Start\\" - business start-up expert, Guy Kawasaki explores the nuts-and-bolts of building an organization and the motivation that drives the spirit of entrepreneurship. Kawasaki was an employee at Apple Computer during the company's infancy, which helped shape his own perspective and drove him to launch his own company. Soundview likes this book because the author distills the essence of entrepreneurship down to its basic element - doing. The author believes that entrepreneurs share an orientation toward action and accomplishment, rather than engaging in theoretical discussions and the mire of unnecessary details. Additionally, he provides a roadmap through each phase of business incubation, from the basic functional needs of creating your business model; securing seed capital; hiring the right people  - all the way to aspirational goals such as philanthropy and community service.  This is an essential read for your inner \\"world changer.\\"
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A sleeper amongst scifi productions, integrates the old west cowboy way with futuristic thinking  the characters are diverse and interesting, the actors great and the special effects believable
B001TODCII|5.0|Liam Neeson is the action star you would never suspect! Delivering with a cool & calm demeanor but always meaning business & you never doubt it. I was captivated by this movie from the beginning. Some action movies have ridiculous story lines but this movie not only has the action but the story line to go with it. Clashing divorced parents, the father that was absent due to work & now wants so badly to be in his teenage daughter's life but then she is taken while visiting another country & he will stop at nothing to find her. Full of suspense!
B000GPIPT2|5.0|The main reason for getting the 75th Anniversary edition was the new special features.  I'm very pleased with the film and the special features.  At least I was now able to watch one of the special features that was on the Legacy set.  Still trying to find one of those double-sided discs that works right.
B000BNI99K|5.0|A good collection of Rod Stewart songs. Delivered on-time by BN at a fair price
B000GPIPSS|5.0|I got the 75th Anniversary edition for the restoration of the missing sound fragments of earlier versions and the new special features.  I've read all the other comments about the sound and cropping, etc.  I just wish Universal could do it right the first time.  They have also included again the re-scored version, which is better left unheard.  It is nothing but a desecration.
B00005JMK0|5.0|Superb comedy / love story from the 80's.  Have been waiting a very long time for this to come out on DVD, at least 4 years now.
B0026PA05M|5.0|We saw Halestorm years ago open for Flyleaf.  Never heard of them, but great live.  Ended up picking up their EP in the lobby after the show.  Several years later this comes out, great ROCK!!
B001LPWGE6|5.0|Having this trilogy is a definate must.  (Tip: the packaging is different - the front flap is magnetically held closed,  just pull), the contect is top notch.  The clarity is there and the contect is every bit explosive through the last movie.  I watched the series in one weekend and was quite impressed. Glad I made the purchase.  I know I will watch this one again and again.
0743298020|2.0|I generally like Gothic novels and wanted to like this one. My chief complaint is that is there is nothing to tie this story to a specific time period. Much of the prose feels fairly modern and yet there is no mention of the Internet, no concrete descriptions of the world the narrator moves in. It all feels very dreamy and detached from reality. Worst of all, the author uses themes of incest and madness as plot teasers -- I felt like she was fluttering these things in front of me to try to get an unearned emotional response. That is just so wrong.
B0009P42S2|3.0|The visual art of this film are unquestionably excellent, but the film just seems to keep going on and on. Set in Victorian England the suspension of disbelief has to go into overdrive. One of the characters keeps talking about zeppelins but von Zeppelin would not be experimenting for a couple of decades yet. Other elements of the plot are incongruous as well. Even this could be forgiven if the plot was more coherent. Good for a single watch.
0385340990|5.0|As an avid reader of WWII fiction, I admire books that portray the strength, resilience and determination of those who lived and persevered during those horrific world events. Writers who take the time to do their research really transport us into that era and allow us to gain a sense of what it was like for those who lived it. Shaffar and Barrows did such a marvelous job that I found it necessary to remind myself on more than one occasion that this was a work of fiction and not a collection of letters written between dear friends who actually lived in London and Guernsey!
B001TOD92C|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect from this film, not being familiar with wrestling. As a blue collar character study, this film is excellent (I've known people like this). I am floored by Mickey Rourke's performance -- his transformation into Randy is seamless and powerful. This film could have easily been maudlin and depressing, but it didn't feel that way to me. Highly recommended.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I found this cd at a local mall, it's really beautiful.  I believe that every song has its own story.  To make a long story short, I'll describe each song:  Declaration: This is truly a song to be singing if you're inspired to do good things or if you're having a good day.  Even if you're on top of the world or another face in the crowd, raise your voice!!!! \\"This is my declaration for anyone who's listening.\\"  Heroes: I believe there are good people who do extraordinary things.  I say that the real heroes are the one who help out day to day.  \\"I believe in what you've shown me, there's a hero in us all. All these heroes come and go, but you're still standing.\\"  Light On: Love this song!! It bascially tells a story about someone who keeps a light on for a loved one, whether it's family, friends, boyfriend, girlfriend, or spouse.  Don't be afraid to keep a light in your heart.  \\"Try to leave a light on when I'm gone, something I rely on to get home... a naked light, a fire to keep me warm.... Even in the daylight shine on... you can look inside, you won't feel so alone.\\"  Come Back to Me: A beautiful song about those who are willing to have room to breathe, hoping to come back refreshed.  \\"When you find you, come back to me.\\"  Life on the Moon: I say that it's a song of the unknown, wondering if \\"life could be any stranger?\\" \\"Life on the moon, would it feel so far away? Here are my thoughts, have some faith in me and I'll let you be who you need to be.\\"  Bar-ba-sol: one word-ROCKIN'!!!!  Dance if you love a rock song of this kind  \\"Sailing all alone I thought I made it home... falling in between, I feel sick, I feel nervous, I know just what I did to deserve this.\\"  Mr. Sensitive: Love it.  In my opinion, it's about the sensitivy in all of us as people.  Whether we speak different languages or not, the emotion is just the same. \\"I would like to introduce Mr. Sensitive, the one who never lets the worst gets the best of him.\\"  Lie: Sweet, insecure song about how a person can say that they're ok, even if it's a lie.  \\"So lie to me and tell me that it's gonna be alright.\\"  I Did It for You: Sensitive for the people who tries to get their voice of reason to others, anyting that makes them who they are.  \\"You turn away from all the things I'm trying to say and all those promises I shouldn't have made, I did it for you...you're the only thing that can make me whole, i did it for you.\\"   Avalanche: A sweet, beautiful melody about rising and falling together through good things and tough times.  \\"I feel alive beside you, and all at once I'm whole again...was it nothing more than noise inside my head? Crashing down, crashing down in your avalanche, in your avalanche.\\"   Permanent: I see this as a terminal illness theme, whether it's leukemia, HIV/AIDS, cancer or other ones.  Whenever I listen to this song, I think about my mom and how far she has come for being a survivor of Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma.  What a beautiful tribute to his brother Adam, who recently passed away tragically from a brain tumor, a form of cancer. I bet he got a kick out of it and was touched by the brotherly love.  As a former cancer witness, I know what it's like to be there and see them suffer, doing what I can do to help.  My thoughts are with you and your family, David Cook.  \\"Is this the moment where I look you in the eye? Forgive my broken promise that you'll never see me cry? Will you think that you're all alone, when no one's there to hold your hand? Everything is temporary, rest your head, I'm permanent.\\"  A Daily Anthem: Perfect for singing when you are in the mood for a song like this.  Never be afraid to reach for the stars (or change them) and raise your voice!! \\"If I told you everything, would you sing along, would you sing along? It's a daily anthem, would you sing my song at the top of your lungs?\\"  Time of My Life: Truly inspirational for trying new things, whether it's music or any other stuff you like to do.  Never be afraid to open your cage and spread your wings to fly. \\"I've been waiting for my dreams to turn into something... rising from the ashes, finding my wings... this is the time, this is the time of my life.\\"  I recommend this cd to anyone-American idol enthusisi or someone looking for something diffrent-people who like rock may or may not like this, it's all judged from their opinion.  PEACE!!
076535618X|3.0|I have really enjoyed the Old Man's War series by John Scalzi.  In this latest (and apparently last) installment, he includes all the political intrigue of earlier novels.    But some of the plots were really left hanging... the colony found a new race, the werewolves.  You had high drama about them, and then they suddenly vanished from the plot... There is no mention of them in the last half of the book.    It felt to me like Mr. Scalzi set out to write one book, and suddenly changed his mind half way through and decided to write an entirely different book.  Either book would have been a good read... but I feel I only got half of two separate stories.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|This is a fantastic product that opens up creative flash photography to all skill levels.  Nikon's CLS system is fun to use and there really seems no limit to its creative uses.  I also recommend the Nikon School DVD \\"A Hands-on Guide to Creative Lighting\\" with Bob Krist and Joe McNally.  I started using portable flash in the 60's with the original Honeywell Potato Masher.  Oh, how I wished I had the Nikon SB-900 then!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There's not really much I can add that hasn't already been said.  I will say this, though, I introduced Firefly to the guys/gals in my office and every one of them went out and bought a copy for themselves.  I've watched it all the way through three times and can't wait to watch it again!  I sure hope they at least give us a Serenity II!

B000FOQ1EA|3.0|I should have been more suspicious about this set when I only paid twenty dollars.    The performances are good, but the recording is awful. It is probably worst in the First Symphony Scherzo where the timpani motif sounds absolutely muddled.     My favorite in this set is the Third Symphony. Perhaps I enjoy this one most because I haven't heard any other recordings of the work.     I would strongly suggest Ashkenazy's Sibelius.  Oh, and the Nielsen symphonies with Blomstedt are marvelous.

1582701709|1.0|I'm not going to repeat what many others have said to perfectly point out what a terrible book this is. I particularly loved the review showing how the principles of con artists and advertisers are used to attract readers and believers.  I bought this book after browsing our small bookstore on our military post. I have not heard one thing about this book but had seen it in catalogs and on the bookshelves. I wish I would have read the reviews BEFORE I bought it.  What concerns me the most is this book is that it tells readers that your experiences and your fate is in your own hands. The universe will bow to your positive thoughts and you control all that you bring into your life.  WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP!!  The ONLY person you need to look to is God and Christ!  \\"Apart from me you can do NOTHING\\"-John 15:5 (emphasis added).  It is so sad that readers will believe these lies and be lead away from God.  There is one simple answer to life's woes and joys....PRAY!
B000WC3AKI|5.0|I love this movie..had it on VHS and wore it out, so I had to replace it on dvd. One of those movies that I can watch over and over.
B001RQ0SJO|4.0|I held off saying anything about this up to now, there were plenty of reviews after all, and most have reflected the quality and tone of this CD.  Natasha Khan is an attractive artist, she writes well and her voice is very pleasant to the ears.  There are obvious references to others in her work, which she readily admits in interviews (The Cure, Kate Bush), and that's perfectly natural.<br /><br />Having seen her perform with the present ensemble, on Letterman and Jools Holland, I have a few comments.  First, her selection of musicians was impeccable, they are very good, and on the same page with Khan.  The addition of a full-time guitar improved the sound, and I find \\"Daniel\\" to be superior live than on the CD.  The similarity to \\"A Forest\\" in the main beat is even stronger, and the guitarist has obviously grown up listening to Robert Smith, but that's hardly a bad thing.  Khan could use a bass I think, they seem to be relying on a synth tape for the bass line.  The use of a kettle drum is excellent, it adds drama.<br /><br />Drama is the rub though.  Her performance of \\"Daniel\\" is scripted, the way she dips her head in the \\"eye of the storm\\" line, the way she taps the tambourine on her arm.  That gives me the d-chills.  So does the cutesy crap she litters the stage with, I bet it drives the stage crew absolutely batty.  You can almost hear her saying, \\"no, the doll should be facing this way\\"; yecch.<br /><br />Okay, the last point is petty, but stage presentation is critical.  As an example, compare Bjork's performance of \\"Joga\\" on Jools Holland.  The facial expressions and arm movements that Bjork makes are part of the charm of her show, but they don't appear to be contrived.  The warm smile near the end is genuine, an expression of her joy in the line she's singing, maybe in how the set went, whatever, it's a real moment, and it causes you to believe her emotion (and to fall in love with her).  Natasha's approach makes it difficult to believe her emotions in \\"Daniel\\", and if you don't feel she's being genuine, then you can't completely buy her as an artist.<br /><br />Anyway, I wouldn't bother to be critical if I didn't like what she's doing very much, I enjoyed the CD and last week's TV performances, despite the stilted choreography.  I just hope she moves beyond it.  I also hope she considers retaining these present folks when she records the next CD rather than doing everything herself, and that includes vocals.  If you run into talented people, use them.t feel she's being genuine, then you can't completely buy her as an artist.

B00000JPH6|5.0|This film is one of my early memories, perhaps the first (coherent) memory I have of anything.  I remember suddenly being aware of fantastic, amazing creatures and scenes.  I'm sure this had an influence over my development.<br /><br />This is not a stupid, immature kid movie.  It is filled with wonder, complexity and imagination.  At times, it has an almost Miyazaki atmosphere.  If there is any complaint, it is that the movie is too short.  It is interesting, amazing and startling.<br /><br />The story centers on a Gelfling - which is an amazing looking elf like creature.  It is the task of the Gelfling to mend an object with mythic power known as the Dark Crystal.  Adults watching the film will soon catch on to what is happening.  The crystal was intentionally broken with supposedly good intentions.  It was an attempt to split apart the essence of a semi-divine entity so that it could be rid of its evil side.  However, it goes horribly wrong...<br /><br />It is a film of contrasts and startling moments.  Beautiful elf creatures in fantasy settings clash with scenes of torture and vile totalitarian behavior.  Suddenly, the landscape itself could spring to life.  Amazing patterns reveal themselves on the walls and pillars.<br /><br />This might be a stunning film - even a scary film - for a child used to the shallow, derivative, watered down (overprotective) garbage that is the usual kids fare these days (like a certain kind of derivative, lame and played out computer animated movie or its equivalent).  One thing is for sure though - after watching this for the first time in many, many years - The Dark Crystal is an absolute must see.<br /><br />If you like this movie check out:<br />Nausicaa (or any Miyazaki film)<br />Lord of the Rings<br />Final Fantasy series<br />Zelda<br />Legend (the Ridley Scott film)

I mean, even the studliest stud Bond could use at least a machine gun watch, anti-gravity system, or something! This Bond, as in past episodes, enjoys the same questionable perks as previous Bonds; i.e., always given the chance to survive some gambit designed to 'kill' him instead of a quick bullet in the brain-housing-group as provided to others, without so much as a thank you for your interest, trying to undo the dastardly quack pursuing world domination.

0307269752|3.0|The premise is intriguing: journalist/author Stieg Larsson places his main character and alter-ego, financial journalist Carl Mikael Blomkvist, into what would be a worst-case scenario for any reporter: a possibly career-ending conviction for libel. Then, just as Blomkvist is trying to figure out if his career is salvageable, an elderly tycoon named Henrik Vanger steps in with a lucrative offer of employment.<br /><br />On the face of it, Henrik Vanger would like Blomkvist to write a history of his family which includes many people Henrik hates because they are either notorious Nazis, lazy inebriates, or both. But Henrik also wants Blomkvist to help him solve a cold murder case, and if the fabulous amounts of money he is willing to pay aren't enough of an enticement, he also offers to help Blomkvist defend himself against the presumably false libel charges, which makes this novel both a murder mystery and a revenge saga.<br /><br />Into this scenario is thrown wild card Lisbeth Salander, a deranged computer hacker who joins forces with Blomkvist, and turns out to be the most interesting character in the book.<br /><br />The problem with this novel for me was that there are long sections dealing with such fascinating drivel as what Blomkvist ate for lunch that day, punctuated by a few gruesome plot twists.<br /><br />I would have liked the book better if the man Blomkvist supposedly libeled, Hans-Erik Wennerstrom, had appeared in person in the story, but this character remains behind the scenes the entire time. If the author would have made Wennerstrom more palpable as a menace, spent more time on Lisbeth Salander, and made the more bizarre revelations at the end of the story just a tiny bit more believable, I would have liked the novel a lot better. Also, some lengthy passages were written as conversations which were dull, hard to follow, and did not demonstrate anything interesting enough about the characters to justify the presentation of the information in that way.<br /><br />What is admirable to me about Stieg Larsson is that he was well-known in Sweden for his work against neo-Nazism to the point that some were suspicious of foul play when he dropped dead of a heart attack at age fifty, leaving behind the unpublished, and possibly unedited, manuscripts for several novels. However, no real-life murder plot was ever uncovered, and his death was ruled to have been due to natural causes.e about Stieg Larsson is that he was well-known in Sweden for his work against neo-Nazism to the point that some were suspicious of foul play when he dropped dead of a heart attack at age fifty, leaving behind the unpublished, and possibly unedited, manuscripts for several novels.

For those of you old enough to remember, I too was one of those lunatics who stood on line in the freezing cold to see this great film. Crazier still is the fact that I thought it was worth the wait at the time!<br /><br />This great DVD includes some really frightening footage that was not included in the theatrical version of the movie.  In addition, the entire film has been digitally restored at 1.85 and plays beautifully on a new HDTV system, filling the entire screen. Watching this film on a new large screen HDTV  is just like a night out at the movies.

1582701709|1.0|Simply saying something over and over again does not make it true.  If I were to make my \\"dominant thoughts\\" that of Porky Pig decapitating Donald Duck on prime time television in full gore, the universe would not deliver that to me.       The author attempts to lend authority to her assertions by allowing \\"experts\\" to weigh in ever few paragraphs.  Nobody gives anything beyond anecdotal evidence, and even that is scarce at best.  The book is merely rephrasing a single idea in as many ways as possible.  If such mantras improve your life, many other trivial sayings probably would have improved your life.

For a moment I thought my children played with the remote and changed some settings! It's bad! The movie is a fun action movie, but to call this HD is a joke! I had to adjust the filters to the high setting to reduce the grain and snow in the dark areas, and you can see the pixel squares in the bright segments. What were they thinking?? I loaded my old dvd copy to upconvert and compare the quality, I must say, I think the dvd won! They need to rework this movie and make a special offer to the BluRay copy owners, because I think we've been ripped off!

B000MRAAJM|4.0|This is a phenomenal series, and I thoroughly enjoyed the entire 500+ minutes. My only complaint is that some of the places, images, and events get recycled. For example, on 2 different discs you see the same wolf chase down and eat a baby caribou in the Arctic. There are a few more instances like this. I'm a bit surprised that of all the places on Earth you could go to for content, why any of it has to be repeated.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|She fits in with that whole \\"Blue-eyed Soul\\" genre with recent fellow artists Adele and Amy Winehouse. But I honestly enjoyed Duffy's album over her contemporaries. It probably deserves its own category of \\"Vintage Pop\\" as it has a strong 1960s vibe about it (hear song \\"Rockferry\\" and \\"Stepping Stone\\") more strongly heard than in her contemporaries. I thought at first that would make me like the album less, but I was pleased with the overall \\"classic\\" quality of the songs. She should have won Best New Artist this year but she must deal with a deserved Pop Vocal Album Grammy instead.

B001UREJWM|5.0|Black Sabbath with Dio were always great.  Everything they did together was brilliant and as good as their best Ozzy records. Their new album is amazing. I don't think we'll have  a better metal album this year. Everything that defines Black Sabbath is there-  thunder bass from Geezer Butler, great riffs from Iommi, heavenly vocals from Dio. I don't understand the one and two star reviews. I guess they are from frustrated new musicians. They don't understand that metal is not about technique. Some newer bands have great technique, but the most of them sound dull and uninspired. You don't remember anything after you stop the CD. The more style definitions, the duller the band. These days , everyone can get a guitar and play and even record music. And frustration comes quickly when they realize they can never compete with the great bands. They envy Sabbath because they can never be as great as they are And what a stupid review starting with \\"I never liked Sabbath or Dio...\\"  So, then, why the hell are you writing a review? With these words, you make it automatically irrelevant! An intelligent person does not listen to music because of technique. Some of the greatest songs ever were amazingly simple.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I can't believe the amount of misinformation presented in customer reviews for this product.<br /><br />First of all, it is true -- Nikon added a thermal cut-off that allows the customer to be absolutely certain that the flash never overheats. If that sensor is turned on, the flash can't shoot fast enough or often enough for professional usage -- particularly for weddings. Try shooting the bridal party introductions at a reception, for example. Even if you limit yourself to two flash pops per couple, by the time the third couple is walking in the door, the thermal shutdown will kick in, and you'll be swearing at the thing.<br /><br />However, you can simply turn the sensor off. In my experience, the flash is no more delicate than previous Nikon and Canon speedlights. Every Nikon and Canon flash has a duty cycle carefully described in their manual that virtually all professionals ignore and exceed, and yet -- most of us get years of usage from the flashes with no problem. I can't tell you the number of times I've taken batteries out of my flashes that were simply too hot to hold, and the flash housing was burning hot too -- but the thing just kept on working. So I think, if you turn off the thermal cut-off, the SB-900 will behave just like earlier flashes like the SB-800, in terms of overheating.<br /><br />So the simple answer is. . . if you turn off the thermal sensor, the SB-900 is at least as useful as a professional tool as it's predecessors --  no more, no less susceptible to overheating. I don't know why Nikon and Canon are so conservative in the duty-cycle ratings of their flashes, but I've talked with dozens of fellow pros over the years -- we all abuse the flashes, and we rarely have issues. I'm not saying that it's not possible to abuse these speedlights to the point where they will die -- I'm just saying I have used them professionally and repeatedly put hundreds of very fast, high-power pops on them, significantly exceeding the rated duty cycle, and have yet to kill a Canon or Nikon speedlight.<br /><br />As far as batteries go, Nikon fully supports and recommends the use of NiMH batteries -- both normal and Eneloops. The chart in the manual shows NiMH as being the best combination for a good number of pops and the shortest recycling time. Only the expensive Lithium non-rechargeables have better battery life, but they have a recycle time almost double NiMH. Alkalines give the smallest number of pops, and have the second longest recycle time.<br /><br />So fear not -- the SB-900 is the nicest speedlight I've owned yet -- I have three of them, and I like it far better than it's predecessors. Turn off the thermal sensor as soon as you take the flash out of the box, load it up with Eneloop batteries, and you will experience flash nirvana.<br /><br />Finally, I highly recommend the SD-9 accessory battery pack. Load it up with Sanyo Eneloops, and you can easily shoot an entire wedding (actually, probably two weddings) without swapping batteries, while enjoying the fastest recycle time possible with this flash.<br /><br />Update after using three of the SB-900s for a full wedding season: We encountered some flakiness (random flashing of the flashtube and AF assist lights) which I THINK is related to a loose fit of the SB-900's hot shoe base in the D700 camera's hot shoe. So far, it seems like applying Deoxit contact cleaner to both the camera and flash camera contacts makes the problem go away.yet to kill a Canon or Nikon speedlight.<br /><br />As far as batteries go, Nikon fully supports and recommends the use of NiMH batteries -- both normal and Eneloops.

If your into music of any type the excitement of musical genius can be paralleled with the artist that inspires you.  An exciting movie in and of itself, whether you love music or never even turn on the radio, this movie will hold you in trance to the very end.  You will find yourself searching for Mozart CD's or MP3s on Amazon right after the disc pops out.  You may even be thinking of getting yourself a keyboard.  The blu-ray version is not much better than an upconverted DVD but it is better.  I believe there was not enough extras included for this to be a \\"special\\" release, but still well worth adding to your collection.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I ordered Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred and was very pleased with the price and prompt delivery.  I work out on a regular 5/7 day basis and found this a good way to bump up my workout routine.  It is intense, but since it is only for 25 minutes, you can get through it.  I like the combination of small and larger muscle work at the same time.  The only trouble I have with the 30 Day Shred is that it is hard on my knees.  I found that if I do this 2-3 times a week, I can continue to use it.  If I try to do it daily, I would have an increase in knee discomfort.  Since I do a lot of other exercise, i.e. swimming, biking, yoga and walking, it is a nice addition and a nice option to using weights in my workouts.  I would like to see a change in the format of the DVD so that you can skip the intro.  Once you have seen the intro, it is not necessary and a waste of my time to sit and listen to it over and over again and the format does not allow you to skip forward.  If this was changed, I would give it 5 stars.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I got some of these to go with my mp3 player and they are great! The sound quality just amazed me. I got mine at Kmart which costs more than here (but maybe not when you include shipping).

They stay in good and don't want to keep falling out like some, but the sound quality is the part I like best.
B001KP2Y3K|4.0|This collection of new songs from Madeleine Peyroux is by no means a radical departure from the laid-back style of [[ASIN:B0002NRRAG Careless Love]], [[ASIN:B000002JAX Dreamland]] and [[ASIN:B000GFLE86 Half the Perfect World]]. However, the fact that the songs on `Bare Bones' are all new, and, with the exception of one track, all co-written by the lead artist is to be applauded. That exception is `I Must Be Saved' for which Ms. Peyroux has sole writing credit. For a singer whose recordings are usually found in the jazz section you'd expect to find some cover versions on an album. I for one am always happy to see an album that doesn't contain a Beatles cover or yet another version of `Beyond the Sea'.    `Bare Bones' may bear all the laid-back, chilled hallmarks associated with Madeleine Peyroux, but the aforementioned newness of the material and the shift away from the predominantly jazz and blues-based sound that characterized her previous albums does not, to me, represent an artist who is just going through the motions as some have suggested. I would agree that of the songs on this collection none really strikes home in the way that, for example, `Don't Wait too Long' did upon first hearing. Rather, they need a few plays before their melodies lure you in.    Stand-out tracks are `Damn the Circumstances' with its two-line lyrics separating the beguiling chorus; `Our Lady of Pigalle' which, on first hearing its phrasing, I took to be a Leonard Cohen song; the album's opener `Instead', an entreaty to be grateful for what, or more accurately, who, you have in your life; and `I Must Be Saved' which is almost a companion-piece to `Instead'.    This is an album that would sit comfortably in the more generalized rock and pop section rather than the jazz section of music stores. So, if you're a fan of Madeleine Peyroux specifically in jazz and blues terms, then this album may be a disappointment. However, if you want to hear some of her music outside of that idiom withouthaving an unpleasant jolt of \\"too-far-too-soon\\" syndrome, then this album should be well worth investigating.
B001RTP48G|5.0|This is exactly what fans expect from PSB:  a very solid album that you can listen to over and over again!  Many are making a comparison to \\"Very\\" (which is by far one of my favorite PSB albums) and I feel that that comparison is not very far off.  Thanks for all of the wonderful songs over the many years, Boys, and these are definitely no exception! :)    Also, buy the Limited Edition version if you can, the second disc is well worth the [slightly] extra cost.
B001TK80C0|4.0|I've seen it in the bargain bins for $5...so why the re-release?  It's a good movie and all but I wouldn't think it would rate a re-release at over twice the price you can find it for out here.  Amazon still lists the 2-disk Widescreen Special Edition of this (with 830 reviews) but of course it's unavailable except via the Marketplace (from 99¢ up).<br /><br />The movie companies are busy discontinuing some movies altogether rendering them unavailable and giving the scalpers at Ebay and Amazon Marketplace the opportunity to sell them for anywhere from $50 to $250, but then they re-release movies like this which have already made their rounds and have been rattling around the bargain bins for some time now, it makes no sense to me...<br /><br />As far as the actual movie goes, I thought it was very entertaining, perhaps not quite as with 1 and 2, but entertaining nonetheless.  It adds to the story as opposed to detracting from it like some sequels seem inclined to do, and the special effects are outstanding.  I look forward to seeing what they've done with part 4.  -kd5-
B0000A118M|2.0|I've always been astounded by the reputation of this album. As you can see in these written reviews, as well as Amazon's (and many other) editorial reviews in jazz publications over the last 40 years, it is hyped as perhaps the \\"greatest jazz album of all time\\". I truly love John Coltrane, but I do not think this is his best work, much (much) less the greatest of anything. I would take the masterpiece that is \\"Ballads\\", or the absurdly over-qualified (I mean that in the best sense) \\"Giant Steps\\", or even \\"Crescent\\" as candidates for any greatest lists, if you must (or the terrific albums with Duke or Monk). It would be easy for me just to say I don't get it, except that I do get Coltrane in the main. Why do people go ape-shucks over this album? Historical precedent? Zeitgeist? In a way, it's kind of encouraging that a relatively free, relatively less accessible work of anybody should receive such laud and approval. I like the theory of that. But I wonder if there are people who would listen to this as their first exposure and say, \\"That's Coltrane? Wow, I guess I just don't get it.\\" But if you played them any of 50 other Trane albums they'd say just the opposite. Well, I'll never know. I write this review simply so others whose first listening experience might be bent towards this album try something else. Listen with your own ears, not those of the reviewers. This guy put out some mighty stuff. For me this ain't it.

B000N6TX1I|1.0|I don't want to give away the story or anything for those who will watch this, but the movie is boring...  Nothing happens, and nothing gets resolved in the end.  Seriously one of the worst movies I've seen in a while.  :(
0618918248|5.0|It certainly is not a greatly challenging task to make the argument against the existence of God in the sense of the word promoted by religious institutions and commonly understood by many.  There is simply no proof, direct or even indirect.  This by itself is not interesting enough to buy and read this book.  It has been done before.  On the other hand, Dawkins frames the argument in much more modern terms, and covers all aspects of the argument, from purely biological, to physical, logical, anthropological, psychological, archeological and historical perspectives very thoroughly and systematically.  Being an expert on the evolutionary biology himself, he is especially qualified to take on the evolution vs creation argument.      Sure, at times he comes across hostile but then again, is there ever a nice way to deny God?  The reaction from firm believers is understandable, but the evidence and science trumps belief at the end every time.  He does not deny the need for such beliefs, but takes offense at the efforts to describe physical world and universe in terms of such baseless abstractions.  As a scientist and modern person, like many of us, he finds the so-called faith-based proofs and bullying by the religious establishments to protect such myths offensive and very dangerous.    It is one thing to argue against a literal existence of God, but another thing to argue the need for religion.  That is the only part of this rather thick book where he seems a little less sure-footed.  Would humanity have evolved and advanced in the way it did without religion?  Would there even be a concept of morality as we understand it now without religious institutions?      This is an old but unfortunately very relevant argument, especially in today's ideology driven environment where the hardcore faithful try to dominate and rule our daily lives.  Richard Dawkins deserves credit for presenting his arguments scientifically, clearly and boldly.

B000002BFL|5.0|This is a fitting companion to \\"Nebraska,\\" my other favorite Springsteen record. The music is stripped to the core, to the lyrics and the stark instrumentation. The stories are good, lots of Steinbeck (more than the obvious) in songs like \\"Border Patrol.\\" Records like this are more rewarding than the cheap swagger of recent Springsteen. Remember that the E Street Band wasn't doing much at this point in time, Max Weinberg was Conan O'brien's bandleader for Chrissakes, and Springsteen was free to concentrate on songwriting without the distraction of reverb-soaked snare drums or that godawful saxophone.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|For some fans, the \\"hook\\" maybe Bono lending a hand on War/No More Troubles, but there is so much more to this incredible DVD/CD set that truly demonstrates the love that can be brought through music.<br /><br />The superstars of sound include choirs from South Africa and Northern Ireland, street musicians and artists who are looking for that one break to show what they can deliver to a wider audience. There is a freshness and an incredible spirit on all the tracks, though the syndouts include One Love and Stand By Me. The DVD is an array of music videos, a few which are already gaining consistent rotation on a variety of delivery platforms.<br /><br />Music delivers a brilliant universal message and the sunshine from these performances bring a warmth that must be shared with others.
B001NFNFIK|5.0|What can you say about a mystery movie with two dead bodies in the first first fifteen minutes?  There's quite a contrast as well.  The first is a young woman eviscerated by her killer and the second is a 40 year old crime, a Black man who a young Dave Robicheaux saw killed on the bayou forty years before and didn't report.     That's just for starters.  Movies have come to Dave Robicheaux's (Tommy Lee Jones) Louisiana parish.  Actors Elrod Sykes (Peter Sarsgaard) and Kelly Drummond (Kelly Macdonald) are filming a Civil War battle epic. Unfortunately, Elrod has a drinking and drug problem. And, interestingly enough, their appearance has unearthed the ghost of Civil War General General John Bell Hood (Levon Helm) who's acting as an advisor to Dave.     Of course, we've got the local troublemakers. Mobster Julie 'Baby Feet' Balboni (John Goodman) is producing the film and might just be killing young women.     I admit, often while reading a book, I'm daydreaming my own movies while the pages turn.  I couldn't have asked for a better Dave than Tommy Lee Jones.  He walks the walk and talks the talk as they say.  His supporting cast was excellent as well.  Levon Helm as the General was a touch of genius.  So was Buddy Guy, one of the greatest bluesmen around, as Sam.  I honestly cannot imagine why this film didn't make it to the theatres.  Leonard Maltin called it 'flawed' but I admitted he'd rather see a flawed film that's otherwise well done than a perfect one that just doesn't work.  I didn't see the flaws Mr. Maltin did, but I can say this film definitely did work and I'm glad I purchased it.  Hoping there will be more of Jones as Robicheaux coming soon!    Rebecca Kyle, May 2009
B0000029GA|5.0|One of the greatest hip hop albums of all time, when Nas dropped Illmatic in April 1994, it was like he dropped a bomb on the whole rap scene, and helped put the East Coast back on the map. This album is perfect from start to finish, no wasted space whatsoever. Every track on Illmatic is awesome, but the main ones that will draw you in will be \\"One Love\\", \\"The World is Yours\\", \\"It Ain't Hard to Tell\\", and \\"N.Y. State of Mind\\". Also Nas has some of best producers in hip hop collaborating with him on Illmatic: DJ Premier, Q-Tip, Pete Rock, and Large Professor. All in all, Illmatic is not just one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time, its one of the greatest music albums of all time, period. Nas at his absolute best.
0767830555|5.0|\\"Travis Bickle\\" has to be one of the most fascinating characters ever put on film, and this has to still rank as one of the best post-film noir era \\"noirs\\" ever made.    Yeah the story is a bit seedy but it's an incredibly interesting portrait of a mentaly unbalanced cab driver (Bickle, played by Robert De Niro) and his obsessions with \\"cleaning up\\" New York City.    In addition to De Niro's stunning performance, we see a young and gorgeous Cybill Shepherd and a very, very young (12 years old) Jodie Foster. I've always wondered what kind of parents would allow their 12-year-old daughter to play a role like this, but that's another subject. Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel (with shoulder-length hair!) and Peter Boyle all lend good supporting help.    Bickle's transformation from a \\"disturbed\\" cabbie to a fully-deranged assassin is fantastic to watch, and includes one of the classic scenes in all film history: Bickle talking to the mirror and repeating the question, \\"You talking' to me?\\" That scene, and seeing De Niro in a Mohawk haircut later at a political rally are two scenes people never forget.    The more times I've watched this, the more I appreciate the cinematography and the music in here. There are some wonderful night shots of the city's oil and rain-slicked streets. Also, Bernard Herrmann eerie soundtrack is an instrumental part of the success of this film and should never be neglected in discussing this film.      I hope a good Blu-Ray, (high-defintiiom) transfer of this film will come out soon.
B001TH16DS|4.0|First, I'm not sure how the many reviews appear here months before the set is released???  Speculators?  Anyway, I like the ability to watch the original non-enhanced version and then watch the enhanced version.  Each has it own draw.  The audio level is low. My main concern is, while watching disc 4, the HD picture broke up several times and at one paused until I pressed stop.   Has anyone else experienced digital breakup on these disk's?
0783240236|4.0|This is one of those landmark films where if you saw it in the theater when it was released, you never forgot the experience.     What I'll never forget - and this is true, so help me - is that moments after I left the theater, a couple birds swooped over my head. I thought I'd have a heart attack at the age of 18!! I never forgot that. It still creeps me out.    Since then, I've seen the film at least a half dozen times, on TV, VHS and on DVD and always found it fascinating....even 40-some years later. Sure, it doesn't pack the wallop it did when it came out, and it's a bit too talky in spots for today's tastes, but it's still scary     I'd like to see a good Blu-Ray treatment given to this film, since I've never seen a great transfer of this movie.....and that includes this disc, which looks grainy (and why I gave it four stars instead of five.)
B001UREJWM|2.0|The music is just boring to me on this disc.This album is so tired for me and my music soul. It's just this album did not do it for me. But, They could made original an album.

B00161ISR4|4.0|Kudos to the special-effects people to make the giant tarantula scenes look pretty good, even by today's standards some 50 years after this was made. Many times, the huge spider looks real while it's crawling down the road.    Except for a talky middle section of this film, it entertained. (The beginning and ending segments were the best!). It also was fun for me to see Leo G. Carroll, a guy I saw each week growing up watching \\"Topper\\" on television. Carroll played, by far, the most interesting character in this movie.    The acting was good in here, too, once again above '50s sci-fi standards. It was one of the better entries in the recently-released Sci-Fi Ultimate DVD set. A pretty good transfer, too.  It can also be seen here on this Region 2 DVD.

B001GKJ2DY|3.0|\\"Mamma Mia!\\" is a light, enjoyable musical story for those in the mood for something like this.  Discovering it on DVD, I immediately thought that the critics were a little hard on the movie when it premiered in theaters.  It's not that they were wrong about some of its shortcomings: Pierce Brosnan's singing is indeed not very good; there's a noticeable overreliance on obvious studio recreations of outdoor sets when they could have just used the actual outdoor sets; and or two other nitpicks.  But any flaws are just that, nitpicks, not fatal elements that should drive a viewer away.  I will say that the movie didn't catch fire up to its full potential, based on all the footage of screaming, joyous fans seeing the stage version that is peppered throughout the special features and promo spots on the DVD, but things are energetic enough.  And several of the secondary characters- especially Meryl Streep's two girlfriends- were a little cartoony for my tastes.  But again, nitpicks.  Just enjoy the scenery, music, and romance.  That's what one wants from a film like \\"Mamma Mia!\\", and that's what is enthusiastically delivered.
0525421033|5.0|Life is complicated for Mia. She has two loves: music and her boyfriend Adam. And pretty soon, she'll have to choose between staying with Adam and her family, and perhaps pursuing a music career at Julliard. Her impending decision is only further complicated one winter morning when she and her family go on a drive that ends in tragedy. Now Mia has only one choice, the one that will affect absolutely everything; should she fight for her life, or let it all go?    If I Stay is a completely powerful and stunning read. Gayle Forman has created a complex story that weaves together many scenes from various points in Mia's life to create a work of art that overwhelmingly emotional and affecting and demands to be read in one sitting. As Mia observes all that goes around her, Forman deftly explores the make-up of Mia's life and those elements that have formed and influenced her in an intensely moving and heartbreaking fashion. As tragic and as sorrowful as the novel is, it is also witty and hopeful and bright at times, and it is the mix of pain and life, light and dark, that make If I Stay and Forman's strong voice a truly memorable read that will perhaps give readers a new outlook on life.
B001GCUO1G|5.0|\\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" provides the back-story to the iconic character from the \\"X-Men\\" comics and movies.

0307450570|4.0|One of the things I have always liked about Martha Stewart is her knowledge of old timey crafts; things such as kniting, tatting, sewing, canning etc.; the things that were taught by my grandmothers to help us survive the days of the Depression.  These things are falling by the way-side now, and she is one person who knows and can explain how to do them.    This book is full of interesting and unusual craft ideas which are not too hard and are beautiful.  I was a little disappointed because I bought the book expecting to see more things that were done in the \\"old days\\" that would be benificial in today's economy.      The book itself is beautiful, has many beautiful ideas for crafting that would be great for gifts and also for decorating our homes.    Carole Patterson
0767812387|3.0|I like Vivica and Chayanne... but this movie isn't that great. I wouldn't have bought it if I'd seen it before. The dancing isn't bad, it's just the story is kinda boring.
B000001DQI|5.0|\\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" is, for many people, the best Elton John album ever released.  A double album gave his fans plenty of tracks to listen to, and he and Bernie Taupin were at the peak of their collaborative efforts.  Even now when looking back at Elton's entire career up to now, this album stands out as one of the high-points, if not the high point of his long and tremendous career.    The album has a tremendous start as \\"Funeral for a Friend\\" is a great opening for the album, building to a magnificent crescendo and then transforming into \\"Love Lies Bleeding\\" which is the other part of the first track.  \\"Candle in the Wind\\" is a piece which seems to get more and more popular as time goes on, and of course Elton reworked it when Princess Diana passed away in a tribute to her.  Though I was never a huge fan of \\"Bennie and the Jets\\", one can appreciate the diversity it brings to the album as well as its reaching number one on the charts.  Oddly enough Elton didn't want it on side one of the album, nor did he want it released as a single.  \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" is of course the title track and was the opening track on side two of the double album and is one of Elton John's best songs of all time.  \\"This Song has No Title\\" is the next piece, and not surprisingly it is a step down in quality from the first four tracks, though still very pleasant as is \\"Grey Seal\\" which follows.  \\"Jamaica Jerk-Off\\" is an enjoyable light piece leading into the more somber \\"I've Seen That Movie Too\\", which is a strong finish to the first half of the double album.    \\"Sweet Painted Lady\\" is a fairly weak start to the second half of the album, as it is one of my least favorite tracks on the album.  It is not horrible, but fairly average in my view.  \\"The Ballad of Danny Bailey (1909-34)\\" is a step back in the right direction, though still not as good as a lot of the other tracks, and \\"Dirty Little Girl\\" is a bit better, but the quality really goes up again with \\"All the Girls Love Alice\\" which closes out side three of the original release.   \\"Your Sister Can't Twist (But She Can Rock & Roll) is another of the weak tracks, but it is worth sitting through to get to \\"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\\".  \\"Roy Rogers\\" and \\"Social Disease\\" are both quirky but enjoyable, and then the album closes fairly strong with \\"Harmony\\".    Elton John plays a variety of keyboards and sings on all the tracks and is joined by his band which consists of: Dee Murray (bass, backing vocals); Davey Johnstone (guitars, backing vocals, banjo); Nigel Olsson (drums, percussion, backing vocals).  There are also some guests on the album including: David Hentschel (synthesizer on \\"Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\\" and \\"All the Girls Love Alice\\"); Prince Rhino (interjection vocals on \\"Jamaica Jerk-Off\\"; Ray Cooper (tambourine on \\"All the Girls Love Alice\\"); Kiki Dee (backing vocals on \\"All the Girls Love Alice\\"); and Leroy Gomez (saxophone on \\"Social Disease\\").    A wonderful album which captures Elton John at his best.  Over 76 minutes of wonderful music and lyrics from one of the great song-writing duos, and performed by a legend at his peak.  Definitely worth picking up unless you just don't like Elton John.
B000NIVJHM|5.0|I always thought this was a lame movie, but I really love it now that I've seen it. Yes, it IS a chick-flick, so if you don't like those types of movies, don't buy it.
B001TH16DS|5.0|I got my set this weekend from Amazon.  Great price.  I watched a few episodes.  Star Trek has never looked better!  You can see Mr. Spock's bad teeth.  You can see the detail of Kahn's uniform.  It's simply amazing.  And, you can watch episodes doctored up with new CG special effects or in their original form...on the same disc!!  You can switch back and forth between the two midstream.  The \\"Pop-up video\\" style to the commentaries is pretty cool.  There are some shortfalls (admittedly, I haven't had time to watch everything).  For example, there are some cast interviews...I think it's on disc 5.  They were recorded back in 2003...at least the portion I saw was.  It was an interview of Shatner and it's obvious it was video taped in NTSC.  It looks pretty bad in comparison to the other materials...but then again, you're not watching the interviews for a super extra clear image of Shatner.  As for the price, I'm blown away.  7 discs for $65.  That's less than $10 per disc...a bargain.  That comes out to $2 or $3 per episode with the extras thown in for free.  Back in the 1980s, you'd pay $14.95 per episode on VHS.  There's a little perspective for you.
B000SSGULM|5.0|I've owned this since the mid-80's -- on vinyl, of course. The addition of Space Truckin' gives you, for this release, the entire concert. This show was so much more energetic and powerful a show than Cal Jam. It IS the best release from the '74 shows that have been released. Everybody is on fire here and you just can't play it loud enough or just plain...enough!!

B00008972S|5.0|What can I say that already hasn't been said by more eloquent reviewers already about West Side Story the movie? It deviated a bit from the original Broadway musical but the movie here still wack a wallop in terms of Jerome Robbins' groundbreaking choreograpny, Robert Wise's direction, and Leonard Bernstein's music. The movie is presented in widescreen of course, and as it should be, so the entire scope of the amazing and exhiliariting dance numbers can be seen as it was originally intended.    West Side Story traced the rivalry between two gangs, the native born Americans Jets and the Puerto Rican born Sharks. The Jets and Sharks turn out to be more alike than unlike and had the capacity to be friends, yet ethnic differences and the stubborness of both sides eventually leads to the deaths of both gangs' leaders and destroyed a relationship between the sister of the leader of the Sharks and an ex-Jets member which could have unite the two together.      The bonus second disc has a very informative and enlightening documentary on the making of the film, including clips featuring Natalie Wood and Russ Tamblyn's own vocals before they were dubbed in. In fact, Wood's vocals were not that bad, but her voice do quiver when she have to hit the high notes. Russ Tamblyn's original vocals for the Jet Song was also featured on the bonus disc, his voice was alright too, but has to be replaced by Tucker Smith due to contractural reasons.    The piece de resistance of the set is the booklet that came with it. The booklet first have a timeline that traced West Side Story's origins from Broadway smash to cinematic legend. Then the entire screenplay is included, with pictures from the movie inserted at key sequences in the script. The screenplay followed, for the most part, the original Broadway prodcution with the addition of the character Ice (Tucker Smith) and the elimination of Diesel. Ice would went on to assume Diesel's role and also many of Action's lines. After that is a reproduction of the original lobby brochure and finally, newspaper clippings reviewing the movie and of the premiere of the movie (get your magnifying glass out!)    Casting wise, the male Jets are more distinctive in terms of their individuality and characterizations. While their rivalry with the Sharks are based in no small part to racism, they are still likeable....until they assaulted Anita. With the exception of Anybodys, the Jet girls for the most part are undeveloped (pow, poo, ooblee-pooh). This trend is reversed in the Sharks, where the female characters turn out to be more interesting than the guys, with the exception of Bernardo. Despite incorporating the Shark guys in the song \\"America\\", most of them remain undistinctive.    While everyone seem to mention the usual suspects: Moreno, Wood, Beymer, Tamblyn, etc, etc, another cast member that also deserved to be mentioned is the late Tucker Smith, who played Ice, the second-in-command of the Jets. The last time I saw \\"West Side Story\\" in any form was when I was grade school, which was in the late 70s. Perhaps it is because of the widescreen, and that my sense of perception has matured, watching the movie I found myself constantly drawn to Tucker Smith. This often overlooked dancer/singer/actor, in my humble opinion, steals just about every scene he was in, especially the mambo dance sequence in the gymnasium, where he clearly was the best male dancer in the cast (he can clearly throw his legs much higher and arch his back more than even the \\"epitome of masculine grace\\" George Chakiris). He exuded charisma and star quality and certainly danced and looked better than any of the male leads. For whatever reason his career seem to have stalled in Hollywood. Although there were some rumours on why he didn't go on to bigger things but that is a matter to be discussed someplace else.

B001R4KQDE|4.0|\\"Sin City,\\" based on a popular series of graphic novels, captures the signature comic book style of creator Frank Miller, which involves black and white images with highlights of color for dramatic effect, extreme violence, brutality, misogyny, and torture.  Miller doesn't pull his punches.  Even Superman and Batman would wince at the parameters Miller has widened in the field of comic art.   \\"Sin City\\" is co-directed by Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarentino.  Its cast includes Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Brittany Murphy, Nick Stahl, Powers Boothe, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Carla Gugino.   Basin City, the \\"sin city\\" of the title, is an extension of hell where the underbelly of society flourishes.  The police are either ineffective or corrupt, prostitutes -- heavily armed -- rule their own red light district, and shootings and murders occur with the frequency of flashing neon.     The two-disc Blu-ray edition contains both the theatrical and a recut, extended, unrated version.  There are a slew of bonus extras to make fans of Miller's creation happy.

B00005Q45W|4.0|I am enjoying this album very much. I like the production value and I really like the lyrical changes and swells that lean inward while displaying outwardly. Leonard Cohen has landed in a place on this album that is a natural progression. From observation to pining to philosophical searching and yearning. This album is not folk. It is not rock. It is groove laden poetry sung with two shared voices.<br />I think it is fantastic. I have been listening to it repeatedly now for weeks. I get it. It got me and I'm enjoying the fulfilling experience.<br />If you are enjoying Leonard's LIVE in London CD. You will enjoy this tremendously.

B00127RAJY|5.0|WOW WOW WOW!!! All I can say is WOW! I've purchased several different workout dvd's but this one is by far the BEST ever!!! I've only had it about one month and I can already tell a significant difference in my body! It's only a 20 minute workout, but I get more out of it than an hour in the gym! It's extremely fast paced, no time for rest. I would recommend this DVD to ANYONE!!!
B00004RJ74|5.0|This thoroughly enjoyable film is masterfully put together by Tarantino and is one of his most impressive films. It's well paced and each element is fined tuned as to not cancel each other out. By that I mean, The comedy and over the top action never make the film any less horrifying.<br /><br />Tarantino also has a knack for casting his films perfectly with character actors and or surprising guest appearances by people you wouldn't expect to see in a film...or this type of film. Tom Savini FX wizard and monster maker has a great humorous role as a bad a $ $ biker and Fred Williamson as a bruising trucker!<br /><br />This is also one of the only films that I own that stars George Clooney, who is a likable guy, but I have never been a big fan. He manages to play his smarmy persona to perfection in this fun and gory fright flick.<br /><br />The film starts out like a action crime drama and turns into a hilarious and scary comedy horror film. It's really an excellent piece of work and  it's not an easy thing to accomplish! The acting is heads above films of this nature, the FX are gross.....but in a fun way and the film will breeze by it's hour and 48 minute running length.<br /><br />It's exploitation at it's best with a fair amount of naked skin at the T I T T Y Twister after hours bar! Salma Hayek's erotic dance is also a highlight! The colorful cast includes Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Danny Trejo, Salma Hayek, Cheech Marin(in 3 roles!)and Tarantino in a fun role as Clooney's delusional brother!<br /><br />I had seen this film a few times, but it had been a while and watching it now, you can see elements of Tarantino's future projects - The Grind House Films Presents - Planet Terror and Death Proof in this extremely wild movie! The two disc collector's edition is awesome and well worth looking for! It's loaded with feature-ettes, out takes, deleted scenes, a commentary trailers and on and on!
0307450570|4.0|I love the crafts and design field, but economy drives me to try it with my own hands!!! Economy is a year round thing, yet the holidays is a must to get into the grit and grime of trial and error until satisfied then showing the things made to see if they pass. Then it's to making in multiples. I love to give just to see their expressions. There are the elderly that may not get a gift. To the shame of Americanism who are going to be humbled into making something. If I was the receiver, I would be greatly touched. (So much for the political statement!) I am interested in the Martha Touch, but without some kind of holiday fevered-brow touches in the ornament section I can use the books I have for now  because it's the holidays that really merit the use of crafts for my six children, husband, 1 pet, and home!!! Please Martha put the \\"holiday sentiments\\" as top priority!
B001PPLIFU|5.0|Although this is not as good as Craig's original Casino Royal - it is a great movie for all Bond fans.  Casino Royale set a very high standard which Quantum did not meet - or did it even have a chance?  The scenes are action packed and the plot acceptable.  It is definitely worth a look - especially in Blu-ray.

The 3 stars is for the ONE exception and that's \\"Looking For Somebody\\".  Finally, at the end of the CD, Gary gets creative.
B000GGWFWY|3.0|After digging through an old tupperware tub, I found an old copy of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  I recalled studying the book in high school, yet it had been so long I decided to give it another try.<br /><br />The basic premise of the story is believable.  According to the book's cover, \\"The romantic clash of two opinionated young people provides the sustaining theme...\\" Anyone who has seen the movie \\"You've got mail\\" starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks will relate.<br /><br />Ms. Austen penned her novel in the early 1800s, so the language is more challenging than one written today.  Still, the writing is clever, and provides the reader with the details needed to place themselves in settings as needed.<br /><br />Regretfully, I gave the book 3 stars, finding myself a bit bored even 1/3 into the story.  The characters and the bickering became annoying to me...I understood from the beginning that Mrs. Bennett wanted nothing more than to marry off her daughters, and see them marry well.  People express this opinion in the present day.  There are people who want to marry well.  Others for love.  Statuses clash and miscommunications occur.  Perceptions are miscontrued.<br /><br />Despite the fact that the world still witnesses all of these things, and the characters were colorful, I felt as though I was reading Ms. Austen's story in \\"real time,\\" and was relieved when I finally came to the end of the book.  I did end it with a chuckle and a shake of my head, though, after reading the line \\"Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennett got rid of her two most deserving daughters.\\"  So a good premise for a book, but I think one would enjoy reading it more if they enjoy Ms. Austen's style of writing.<br /><br />J.R. Reardon<br />author, CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS

B00127RAJY|5.0|[[ASIN:B00127RAJY Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred]]<br />The Jillian Michaels 30 day shred works.  I am a 57 year old man and find the workouts to be challenging, but I am able to do the workouts and can see a lot of physical improvements in a short time.  I have lost about 40 pounds by eating healthy and excersizing.  Since I bought this video I have lost an additional 10 pounds in 2 weeks.  I also try to walk a few miles three to four days a week.  If you only have 20 minutes to work out and want to see results, then I would highly recommend purchasing this DVD.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|I wrote an entire other review of this album that was much more critical but after listening to it a handful of times it has grown on me significantly. My first reaction was that this was Exciter all over again, Exciter being one of my least favorite Depeche Mode albums ever. DM tends to put out albums with a nice variety of heavy beats mixed with more subdued songs. The problem with Exciter was that it was all subdued to the point of being sleep inducing making the title `Exciter' all the more ironic. Playing the Angel, on the other hand had a fantastic mixture of music including adrenaline pumping songs like `Nothing's Impossible', `The Sinner in Me' and `John the Revelator' that I could pop in my IPod and jog to.<br /><br />Quality wise I would put Sounds of the Universe somewhere between Playing the Angel and Exciter and in the complete library of Depeche Mode albums (and I own them all) I would place it below average. However, since I consider DM to be the best musical group of all time that may just mean it's exceptional rather than spectacular. Nothing in the album is likely to make it into my iPod that I use for jogging but there are some very good songs including Wrong, Fragile Tension, and Peace. After Peace the album seems to run out of steam and the last five songs are pretty forgettable.<br /><br />I can't say I'm not disappointed. Since 1993's Songs of Faith and Devotion, DM has only been producing an album every four years so a sub par effort means a long wait for the next Depeche Mode effort. I guess we can see what comes in 2013. On the other hand with repetition this album might continue to grow on me until I have to go back and apologize for my criticisms. We'll see.

B00065F86U|4.0|Fits like a charm, works like a professional item. Read the instruction to find the little switch to connect the battery with the cover! I sure would have liked a red circle around it - or a white arrow pointing to \\"open\\".  Sadly enough you MUST buy a separate battery charger at USD 100+ to charge the EN-EL4 or -4a battery. Why the battery cover could not integrate the charger-connection I don't know, but the extra charger increases clutter. Just as well that the battery is rated for some 1000 pictures, as otherwise you'd be carrying the charger for the camera-battery and the charger for the EN-EL4 (-a).
0375842209|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this book....  I tend to get bored with books very easily, and have a hard time seeing them to the end because of it.  I was so excited when I found myself totally unable to put this down!  It had me laughing and crying...  I really love that it was written from Death's perspective, because it was such a unique way to take in this wonderful story.  So much love and compassion in this story; leaves you with so much more of an appreciation for family, friends, love, and precious life itself.  Thank you so much Markus Zusak....you've made a life-long impression!
0674032810|5.0|This is an excellent versions of \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" especially for non-specialist readers. Professor James T. Costa, who edited this book and prepared the excellent annotations, is a biologist himself and an insightful student of Darwin. He presents a facsimile of the first edition of Darwin's classic volume (accepted as the most passionate and unalloyed version of Darwin's original views, compared to the five versions that he oversaw subsequently) in a broad format: on each page, the text lies next to commentary and interpretation by Professor Costa. Darwin's writing is precise and clear but the lay reader often has questions - or would, if we knew what to ask - that are answered in the annotations. The result is a handsome edition with thought-provoking insights that vastly enhance the reader's interest and understanding. Each comment is keyed to the pertinent place in the text to which it refers by the use of an arrow and the comments provide a gloss, as it were, on those passages. Costa summarizes, explains and points out what is coming up, indicates where the same themes or ideas reappear, offers valuable context or present-day perspectives on what Darwin is saying, and so forth. These annotations are not necessarily just brief remarks but are often substantive, meaty, and very worthwile. They make the original text resonate in ways that no one but an expert would necessarily have anticipated. The result is a far more rewarding book than the \\"Origin\\" would be alone, and that is saying something.<br /><br />To take just one small example, Costa explains what may puzzle many readers, namely, why Darwin starts out with a discussion of plants and animals under domestication.  His comments reduce the confusion people feel (I know I did, initially) when they start reading, thus making it likelier that general readers will not be put off by the book from the outset. The reader is thus helpfully guided through Darwin's seminal work by a companionable expert.<br /><br />Costa has prepared a worthwhile introduction in which he discloses his ambition that this edition will help to persuade modern students to read Darwin's original book, thereby enhancing understanding (and preventing misunderstanding) of evolution.  He also laments and is perplexed by the fact that Americans seem so inclined to litigate over whether such widely accepted science can be taught in public schools.  I gather he hopes by this edition to forestall some of the misunderstanding that can give rise to such litigation.<br /><br />I hope Costa succeeds.<br /><br />A set of biographical notes helps readers understand Darwin's references to other people and indicates where in the text one will find those references. I also inspected the bibliography/references and found it substantial and helpful, if a bit on the individualistic side. There is an index as well.<br /><br />This is an attractive volume, stylishly presented by Harvard University's Belknap Press. There are no illustrations or diagrams apart from those found in the original first edition, however. The price is reasonable. Although I already have several editions of \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" I was quick to buy this one. As a non-specialist, I have found the annotations extremely useful, informative, and even entertaining.

B001UREJWM|4.0|Wow.  The length of some of these reviews lead me to believe some folks only review when Judas Priest, Iron Maiden or Sabbath do another CD.  Lot's of music out there kids!    On the other hand...  I enjoyed this one.  Having been one of those that liked the Dio line-up the best, this was a nice surprise.  Some of the songs are a bit weak on melody and 'some' of the lyrics are typical RJD fare but this is better than I thought it would be.  God bless em (ahem) for realising they would make a lot more money this way than another Tolken-esque Dio release or unknown line-up Sabbath release.    The CD cover is a bit over the edge for a band that claims they are misunderstood... A Christ riddled with nails and a snake crawling up the cross while hell-raiser himself is shrieking.  Why, who could misunderstand that!  Funny! OOOooooooo.

B000005RFQ|5.0|Don't believe the bad reviews you read in the main stream media about this album.  [...] says it is probably the worst Sabbath album ever made.  I don't get it.  Allmusic is usually pretty good with ratings but it is like they never really listened to this album.  I loved this album when it first came out in 1983 and I still love it today.  For me, it has stood the test of time.  Unlike some albums like Vinnie Vincent's Invasion that I used to love but now can't stand.  Just download three songs and you be the judge:  Disturbing the Priest, Trashed and Zero The Hero.  Ian Gillan belts out some of the best vocals you will ever hear in Metal (can you say falsetto) AND the great song structure and heaviness of Sabbath are there.  Ian Gillan gets in on the song writing with Iommi and between the two of them it is magic.  These three songs hold there own against ANY heavy, evil, melodic Metal.  There is a very creepy vibe to this record with the sound effects and Gillan's eerie screaming and wailing.  It sounds cool to me.  I wish this lineup lasted another 5 albums.  We can only wonder what would have resulted.  Same could be said about Dio (although he is now in Heaven and Hell and has a new album).  And the Ozzy years speak for them self as classic milestones.
0930289234|4.0|I cannot possibly imagine, how was it like, back in the eighties, to read this comic. Sure, I can imagine impact, put it in comparison with other schools of comics, with other great authors and so on, yet I still find actual experience quite unimaginable. Digital age brought together with itself numerous scans of older American comics, stuff for which you would pay thousands to read, unless you had someone in your family that collected them back than, and one is free to browse trough this library as one sees fit. When you see first issues of Fantastic Four, Spider-man or Green Lantern (or any other hero for that matter), one cannot but feel touch of nostalgia for \\"good ol' days\\" and simplicity of it all. Shiny costumes, rigid moral code and bad guys who wanted to destroy the world or steal some money from some bank. Collosal galactic battles came after.<br /><br />Moore used all of this. Being a passionate consumer of a genre, it was easy for him to draw references, to cite American and British comics (much like Tarantino does in filmmaking), and during that process, to deconstruct a genre, creating a myriad of followers, readers and authors, who continued on his path - creating bleak, depressed heroes, which battled issues of an \\"ordinary life\\". Suddenly, shiny costumed vigilantes leaped out from hands of the youngest and landed into the world of grown-ups, world where straight division line between good and bad couldn't be drawn. Watchmen screamed \\"look what can be done with a simple premise\\", and in that screaming it drawed attention to itself.<br /><br />Yet, as someone has already written here, time went on, and age of the Watchmen started to show (rather quickly one should say). In twenty years from its appearance we witnessed many great comics that surpassed watchmen on many levels. But point is, these comics weren't of the superhero genre. Genre authors drawed from Moore, as Moore did from the earlier era, and we were able to observe making of new language in superhero stories. Yet, as advanced as it may be, Watchmen remained within the boundaries of the genre. When compared with other texts, especially with \\"European school\\" and American underground, texts that featured braver, radical or simple topics, Watchmen started to leak. It's language and it's problems showed itself as staged, overly constructed, and it's characters became somewhat cloaked manifestations of simple ideas. What Watchmen told in over two hundred pages, some of the books managed to tell in less than 48.<br /><br />Today, there are far better stories, thematically more concise and far better drawn, yet Watchmen still remains actual. As far as Cold War was a fiction, so is Al Quaida today, which once again puts theme of Watchmen back into the spotlight. Still, as an art form, Watchmen are seriously outdated and, in all of it's complexity, relatively simple. They should be remembered as a starting point of a new language in superhero fiction, should be remembered as a proof that comics aren't kids stuff anymore. But that is as far as it goes. To some, it will be enough. To others it won't. Nevertheless, though there are better comics out there, it's a great read and one you shouldn't miss.

B000002GVO|5.0|Hotel California is easily one of the best albums ever released by The Eagles; and it may well be that it's truly their best album ever. This is very high quality control music; they rarely miss with the tunes on this CD. There's not a dud in the bunch! The quality of the sound is excellent and I like that artwork very much.<br /><br />\\"Hotel California\\" is one of their best singles ever; and it makes a stunning opening number for this number. The Eagles prove themselves to be kings with this one! The complex musical arrangement is the perfect complement to the vocals; and that's grand. \\"Hotel California\\" got lots of airplay when it was originally released; and we always requested the station that would play it most frequently when we were going back and forth from school on our school bus. (The bus had a radio even back then, believe it or not. We had a long commute each way; and the school finally caved in and let us have a radio on the school bus to make the trip much more pleasant.) I simply don't know many songs that are artistically superior to \\"Hotel California;\\" this one ranks very high in my book.<br /><br />\\"New Kid In Town\\" is quite a poignant number that is hard to ever forget; this also got lots of airplay in its time and it still remains quite a strong number even today. There's a certain romanticism to \\"New Kid In Town\\" and I love it. The music features great guitar work and the keyboard work lacks nothing--it's all THAT good. Similarly, \\"Life In The Fast Lane\\" really has a great sound; the electric guitars come up to be a major part of the musical arrangement and The Eagles turn this out without ever letting go of a superfluous note! I really like \\"Life In The Fast Lane;\\" and listen for \\"Wasted Time.\\" \\"Wasted Time\\" has more great piano work and The Eagles do this one up right!<br /><br />\\"Victim Of Love\\" stuns me with its beauty; I remember this tune from school dances and the radio when it was released back in the day. \\"Victim Of Love\\" uses the guitars and drums to great advantage. \\"Pretty Maids All In A Row\\" has complex tempo and key changes that enhance the appeal of this rock ballad; and of course The Eagles don't ever skip a beat! The album ends with \\"The Last Resort;\\" this is another remarkable tune and it really showcases the endless talent of The Eagles. What an ending for this album!<br /><br />Overall, Hotel California is \\"required listening\\" for any fan of The Eagles and anyone just discovering the artistry of this fine group would do well to get this album.

B001NESPHC|5.0|My One and Only Thrill is the newest album out from Melody Gardot. Melody sings unbelievably well; I'm extremely impressed. Indeed, Melody's voice is so special that it practically leaves me at a loss for words to describe it. She sings as beautifully if not more so than just about any songbird I've heard--ever. When she sings you really listen--and you listen closely, too, because she gives one heck of a performance! She infuses each song on this album with a great deal of emotion; just one listen proves it. She writes beautifully, too--these songs are lovingly and passionately crafted to become works of art--and then performed faultlessly. The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent; and I really like that artwork, too.<br /><br />I'll list my favorite numbers here, although all the tracks stun me with their beauty.<br /><br />\\"Baby I'm A Fool.\\" - Melody sings this so very well. The lush, jazzy and bluesy musical arrangement uses the strings to great advantage but wisely the music never steals the show away from Melody--her vocals remain front and center. Her voice is as clear as a bell, too.<br /><br />\\"If The Stars Were Mine\\" -- This gets a somewhat spirited treatment; and this chanteuse never skips a beat as she does this one up right!<br /><br />\\"Who Will Comfort Me\\" -- Great percussion enhances this tune--beyond perfection.<br /><br />\\"Your Heart Is As Black As Night\\" -- This uses the piano well as Melody delivers this with panache; I could never tire of hearing Melody sing this ballad. The jazz and blues mixture makes this a stand-out.<br /><br />\\"Our Love Is Easy\\" -- This has another very lush musical arrangement.

B0018S6YOE|5.0|Wow! It will sure be hard for Rihanna to top this CD. Nearly every song was single material and the added material (Disturbia most notably) is exquisite. Her duet (is it a duet if there is a girl singing with another band?) with Maroon 5 was also highlight. I couldn't recommend this more.  I eagerly await the next incarnation of Rihanna! (and I usually listen to metal...wrap your heat around that!)
B001UREJWM|2.0|Yes, it's heavy. Yes, the musicians are great.  However, the songs are boring - no hooks whatsoever - none!    Dio should take the hot potato out of his mouth and sing a line with a relevant melody ... and should also quit writing lyrics.  Iommi should go back to basics and come up with a memorable riff - simple is better.  Vinny Appice should do better than a drum machine. I guess he was bored too.  Geezer Butler is good.    The productions sounded over-compressed and tiring. Louder is not always better.
B0011ZNAIC|1.0|I wanted to like this movie.  The premise wasn't bad, and it seemed like it would be a fun, lighthearted romp.  It wasn't.  Sure, there were a few chuckles, but mostly it was long periods of boredom interspersed with areas of preaching.  I don't mind if movies have a moral, but the aim should be to subtly weave it through an otherwise interesting story.  This movie failed on the subtle front as well as the interesting front.<br /><br />I can't see myself recommending this movie to anyone.  There are far better animated movies out there - spend your time watching one of them.

B00136Q6D0|5.0|When I was 20, I was heavily involved in playing metal and punk music.  At the same time, I didn't feel I was really developing as a musician by listening to all of the other groups my friends were listening to.  Well, while flipping through the dials, I came across NPR and was like \\"Hmm... jazz, okay, cool.\\" and would listen to a bunch of anonymous jazz artists... well at least they were to me.  I just considered myself a fan of jazz without really wanting to find out more artists to support.    One night while Canadian NPR was on, the radio host Ross Porter decided to put on \\"In A Silent Way\\" by Miles Davis.  I was so impressed that I dropped the sandwich I was eating on my lap.  The next morning, I went to the store and got the CD.    It's only two songs, but man alive does the album pack a wallop in terms of it's delivery.  The atmosphere of the album is bright at times, mellow at others, but always full.  It does have it's calm and serene moments (most notably when the title track is on) but while the more up-tempo parts aren't necessarily overpowering, the music is still powerful, well-crafted, and remarkably beautiful.    I recommend this album to everyone, especially those who're willing to give jazz music a try.  It's not long, but man does it explore the space it's in.

6305128952|3.0|There's a message that Redford is trying to subtly get across. Redford is trying to convey that the most important things in life (and to mankind) are simple. Relax, love one another, live where you want, do what you want, and know that in spite of all of that, you can still be respected.     In a fast-paced America, we fight amongst each other for money, property, job status and damn near everything else. We even compete on the roads to see which one of us will arrive at the red light first!     As the film points out, we have no time for realtionships with our children or even time to make home-made spaghetti sauce.     This film was attempt to remind us that integrity is worth more than greed.     Just my opinion.

B001VB8UAE|5.0|The thing about Barbra concert DVDs is you can watch them over and over and over and over and forever be discovering new facets to her performance--to the singing, her facial expressions, her body attitudes, the staging, the lighting, the sound, the orchestrations.  So you get a new show every time out and that in itself is a value.  Even without all that, this package is a value, put together with obvious love and care and respect for the people putting out money for it.  Even without THAT, how often do you see an artist who is a truly unique and original talent and personality, who at this point in a lengthy and spectacular career is still learning and growing and perfecting her art, who can still surprise both her audiences and herself, and who has reached that rare stage of enjoying what she is doing and letting her audience come through the door and join her as family.   The concerts in this package are outstanding in every measure but beyond that they are totally comfy and enjoyable and warm and comforting.  When Barbra sings, all is right with the world.  You won't find any artist with greater respect for her audiences or a stronger sense of obligation to the muses of excellence.  Get this and give it as a gift for birthdays and holidays to your family and friends.  Let everyone celebrate!  (*The title of an early Streisand song.)
B00005JN8Z|2.0|The acting and script are EXCELLENT.  But there are some \\"minor\\" issues that some people may have problems with, such as baptism that is not immersion and hinting at the possibility of married people still being married in heaven (see Matt. 22:23-30).  Furthermore, it is a little vague on exactly who is going to heaven and who is not.  And there is a MAJOR PROBLEM:  at one point in the movie Peter receives a message from Jesus that includes a statement along the lines of \\"or I will come back and be crucified again.\\"  This is a major theological problem, as the one crucifixion of Christ was sufficient (see Hebrews chapter 10).  Such a shame for an otherwise excellent movie.
1416562605|5.0|Great read - I was hooked after the first few pages and the novel never let go of my interest from there.  The sharp humor, stream of consciousness writing style and seemingly cursory yet incredibly in-depth look at characters like The Stork, The Mongoose and Vitelego Lips reminded me of Heller's Catch-22.     There were so many great themes that Adiga hit in this novel - rich vs. poor, master vs servant, family vs individual, corruption vs virtue.  His Rooster Coop metaphor is fantastic.

0385333846|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is my favorite book.  It is a black comedy sci-fi story that takes place throughout the main character Billy Pilgrim's life, from birth to death.  The majority of which is during three eras: near the end of World War II in the German city of Dresden, his middle life at the time he spent as the exhibit of a zoo on the planet of Tralfamadore, and his later life as an optometrist in New York. The basic summary of the plot is that Billy Pilgrim was born in Ilium , New York .  After graduating from his High School, he studied Optometry for one semester, then was drafted to the military in World War II. He served with the infantry in Europe , and then was taken prisoner by the Germans. He was in Dresden when it was firebombed.  After the war, he went back to New York and became a successful optometrist and married a woman named Valencia . They had two children.  Later, Billy was the only survivor of a plane crash on top of a mountain in Vermont . While he was getting treatment in the hospital, Valencia was killed in the car with carbon monoxide on the way to see him. He then spent time on the planet of Traflamadore as a zoo exhibit with Montana Wildhack.  He was returned to the planet and wanted to tell the world of his findings.  Later, Billy was assassinated, but he had seen his death many times and there was no way to stop it.  The whole time when telling this story, it is constantly jumping around in time.  Billy became \\"unstuck\\" in time.                 It seemed like writing this book for Vonnegut was cathartic.  He needed to write it to help himself forget.  I'll warn you, you have to be vigilant when reading this book because it constantly changes time periods.  Although some don't like it, that's what I love about the book.  It uses smooth transitions through time.  At one time he was talking about how he was drunk and passed out in his car at an optometrist party, much time after the war, then got shaken awake and it was hisWorld War II acquaintance Ronald Weary shaking him; which I thought was the coolest thing ever.  I was excited reading the book, patiently waiting for the next time Billy would go through a rift in time.   On Tralfamadore Billy learned an interesting theory about death, and learned that when someone would die, the Tralfamadorians would just say \\"so it goes\\", because that person will always be alive in the past.  I enjoyed the use of him constantly saying \\"so it goes\\" after anything that died..  Things I wouldn't expect that he wrote it after, like the dead champagne bottle.  Vonnegut is like a sardonic clown at a funeral.  He makes the worst of things funny.  It shouldn't really be considered as a comedy, but I did laugh out loud at certain points.  It's a fiction novel, but it isn't all fiction.  Vonnegut obviously used things from his past that he had seen in Dresden and the way he was taken captive to his advantage.  He used imagery to describe things clearly and to get us to picture it how he did.  I can see the zoo exhibit in Tralfamadore, and the little two feet tall green Tralfamadorians and can hear the booming explosions of grenades and rocket launchers going off as he ran with Ronald and the two others.  I personally thought the book was fascinating and, without a doubt in my mind, give it five stars.

B001TH16DS|5.0|The original Star Trek was an \\"HD\\" show for its day. NBC kept it on the air in part because it exploited the potential of the new format at that time -- color. Although Trek never did well in the overall Nielsen ratings, special surveys found it to be among the top shows watched by people with color TVs. And NBC had a vested interest in helping its parent company RCA sell color sets.    Today I'll bet these Star Trek Blu-ray sets will help popularize HD, especially true 1080p. I've had a 60-inch HD set for three years but never took advantage of its full 1080p potential until I bought a Blu-ray player to watch this first season set. The clarity is nothing short of phenomenal -- it really is like going to see these episodes screened in the best quality at a movie theater. And to this die-hard 40-year original series lover the redone effects are well done, even excellent in many cases -- just watch the Enterprise in the sky in \\"Tomorrow Is Yesterday\\" and tell me you don't get a chill. The CG Enterprise exterior tour on disc 6 is also a lot of fun -- it affirms for me that the new movie Enterprise should have looked more like the classic original.    Right out of the shrink-wrap, I had to watch \\"City on the Edge of Forever,\\" and the remastering there really pops. McCoy's pale, blotchy makeup, the \\"New York\\" exteriors, Joan Collins as Edith Keeler, Kirk and Spock in '30s flannel shirts and jeans, Spock's tricorder work using \\"stone knives and bearskins\\" ... it all looks outstanding, right up to the bitter climax. What the Guardian of Forever said could apply to this terrific Blu-ray set -- \\"Many such journeys are possible. Let me be your gateway.\\"
0137549202|3.0|The authors apparently are ignorant of elementary theory of electrical and digital networks. In the 1975 edition, on page 223, and in the 1999 edition, on page 829 - quarter of a century later - they give the formula for the transfer function of a digital network with finitely many components as a rational function of a Jacobian elliptic function of the normalized frequency.  The authors - all of them Electrical Engineers - should know that the transfer function of a digital network or an analog network with lumped components is a rational function of the frequency, whereas a Jacobian elliptic function and any function derived from it by rational operations is a transcendental function.  No wonder students are frustrated in the classroom.
1400079276|4.0|In alluding to the Western pioneer of subconscious fiction, its title prepares us for a strange ride.  And so it is not wholly unexpected when early in Haruki Murakami's Kafka on the Shore, US Army intelligence officers probe Japanese witnesses to uncover the cause of a strange phenomenon.  On a certain day during the Second World War, schoolchildren hiking in a forest fell en masse into a deep sleep, according to those familiar with the case.  As the children begin to snap out of their trance-like states some few hours later, a boy named Nakata remains unconscious, his eyes open and slowly moving from side to side.  Exceptionally, when he does awaken weeks later, his memory has been wiped clean.  Commenting on the amnesia which has befallen Nakata, a psychiatric expert introduces the American interviewer to the concept of \\"spirit projection.\\"<br /><br />\\"Japanese folktales are full of this sort of thing, where the soul temporarily leaves the body and goes off a great distance to take care of some vital task and then returns to reunite with the body.\\"  The conceit turns out to be central to both of the novel's storylines: that of Nakata, who rejoins the world in a dimmed state to carve furniture and catch cats in his neighborhood of Tokyo; and that of Kafka Tamura, a 15 year-old runaway searching for his mother and sister.  The flight of souls from life to what's after, from present to past, and from person to person make for a sometimes jumbled airspace, but, invariably, the greater challenge to connecting the dots of Kafka On the Shore's storyline lies in actually putting the book down.<br /><br />Kafka's story begins as his fifteenth birthday ushers in \\"the ideal age to run away\\".  Kafka admonishes himself, \\"From now on--no matter what--you've got to be the world's toughest fifteen-year-old.  That's the only way you're going to survive.  And in order to do that, you've got to figure out what it means to be tough.\\"  Humorously, Kafka's version of a tough runaway \\"roughs it\\" at a second-tier business hotel, eating at modest sit-down restaurants, after daily gym sessions.  Clearly, Kafka's trials are psychic, his toughness required to deal with the Oedipal curse put on him by his father, an appreciated sculptor.  On the night his famous dad turns up murdered, Kafka wakes up soaked in someone else's blood.  But his innocence is assured--he is halfway across the country when the incident occurs.<br /><br />Or so it seems until Kafka's friend Oshima, a librarian who gradually becomes more involved in his life, advances an explanation having to do with \\"living spirits\\".  \\"That kind of thing appears a lot in Japanese literature\\" he notes.  The Tale of Genji, for instance, is filled with living spirits.  In the Heian period--or at least in its psychological realm--on occasion people could become living spirits and travel through space to carry out whatever desires they had.\\"<br /><br />So as police hunt for Kafka, the young man is ushered into hiding by Oshima, whose secluded cabin lies deep in the wooded mountains of Japan.  In the mountain scenes, Murakami excels in creating another, darker world.  Here we find nestled a guarded temple that provides shelter to the spirits of the living.  Bounds of reality are constantly challenged in the novel, both in its manner of story-telling, and in its characters, who are so often special cases.  When Oshima, a strong-willed intellectual, is taken to task for his sexist opinions, he rebuffs the charge, revealing himself as a hermaphrodite.  In a notably even-tempered tirade against \\"narrow minds devoid of imagination,\\" Oshima asserts that \\"What I can't stand are hollow people.\\"<br /><br />The concept of hollow people, that is, people who are capable of being used as a vessel, is expanded in the book.  When Kafka's father is murdered, he appears in the guise of an evil Johnny Walker, replete with top hat, cape, and knee boots.  Out to steal the soul of various cats, Johnny Walker here encounters Nakata, who becomes entwined in Kafka's fate.  The shifting identities of the book's characters and \\"spirit projections\\" create another plane for their interaction.  The head librarian, a mother figure to Kafka, too seems to be a vessel for her own fifteen-year-old soul. Her intense relationship with her \\"son\\" occurs both in reality and in the temple of spirits.  Though difficult to neatly summarize, Murakami enables the suspension of disbelief through a cleverly plotted storyline.  The story's extra dimension creates a space in which contemporary conceptions of love are challenged.<br /><br />Kafka on the Shore is also the name of a painting in the book.  Its scene depicts a boy, alone on shore, watching a lover's boat move away to another island.  Through such imagery, Murakami relates the sensation of being removed, taken away to a past life that is only accessible in dreams.  The \\"spirit projection\\" may resist analysis, but it serves to state a physical longing, and readers will empathize enough to be swept along with the narrative.  Though at instances we feel like Hansel and Gretel, leaving a trail of breadcrumbs that have disappeared when we turn around, Murakami's rapid pacing, straightforward prose, and sense of humor make reading Kafka on the Shore a wholly pleasurable experience.Kafka's fate.

031606792X|5.0|After reading the reviews I was not sure I would like Breaking Dawn but I loved it!!!  Let's not forget this is a Fantasy/Paranormal Love Story.  I think the saga showed Bella mature from a wall flower teenage girl to a beautiful woman-vampire, which I could relate to and I am sure a lot of others can and will be able to.  It showed Edward more of a man-vampire not a super hero.  You may not be able to pick your family but family is family and not all and every family can get along with each other werewovles, vampire or most of all human families.  The birthing scene did not gross me out at all, yes it would have been nice had they gone to Dartmouth for a year but how boring would that be to read?  The baby added a little more of what are the consequenses of your actions.  I loved meeting all the other Vampire familes which people seemed to leave out of the reviews I read.  I was totally surpised by that and loved them.  I most of all am glad for a happy ending.  It made me feel good. It's good to have a happy ending even though life may not give you the happiness you seek but what else does one have without hope. Enjoy this book.  I had one problem - what is a nudger? I have never heard of that word referred to a baby before.

0385333846|5.0|Slaughterhouse Five is like no book I have ever read or heard of. It is mesmerizing, thought provoking, and lugubrious. Kurt Vonnegut is finally able to write about some of his experiences of firebombing Dresden Germany during World War II in a cathartic way in Slaughterhouse Five. Vonnegut claims most of what is written is true especially the parts about war. Slaughterhouse Five is eye opening. Written in an insipid and mix of autobiography, science fiction, and in an anti- war tone it is nothing short of magnanimity. Slaughterhouse Five is told in the voice of Vonnegut and makes the reader feel there is a strong connection with Vonnegut's own pensive experiences. Though the connection is between the narrator and character is intriguing I am vexed as to why Vonnegut fails to go deeper into his own personal tale.   The main character of Billy Pilgrim is born in 1922 in Illium New York and through his journey in life has been an optomologist, family man, police reporter, student of anthropology, public relations worker, among other occupations. After fighting in World War II and being captured by aliens called Tralfamadorians the main character Billy Pilgrim becomes \\"unstuck in time\\". Taken to their planet of Tralfamadore he fornicates with a famous porn star, Montana Wildhack. The aliens observe the two as extraterrestrials. Due to Pilgrim being \\"unstuck in time\\" he is able to discursively travel from periods of his life though he is unable to control what period he travels to. After a death in the novel the quote 8 0so it goes\\" always follows. It doesn't matter the circumstance. It doesn't matter who died. There is always a tone of inevitability. The Tralfamadorians believe though you can die in one moment you can be alive in othermoments which can be visited through time travel. A main theme in Slaughterhouse Five is the inevitability of death, the vacuous of life, and the pernicious nature of war.   The uninhibited way Slaughterhouse Five is written caused me toruminate over every event. I found the idea of time travel inundate and loved that it was the impetus that kept the story going full throttle. You can't help but feel horrible when you read of the tempestuous time travels of Pilgrim and try to understand the exhaustion he must feel from his circumstance. Though Pilgrim's tale could be viewed simply as balderdash one has to wonder if his demeanor is due to a combination of post traumatic stress disorder and brain damage. Viewed in this light, Billy is a strangely confused man. Though I enjoyed the amazing story of Billy Pilgrim I would have liked to see Vonnegut deeper discus the real sto ries he has to tell- ones that don't involve aliens or porn stars but the history of a brilliant author. In the end, Vonneguts history is sadly neglected, Pilgrims unbelievable story is told, and I was left quite satisfied. I have always sought a book that would blow me away with its strangeness but never found it. Until I read Slaughterhouse Five. In short you need to read this book. You need to experience it for yourself.

With Lauryn's vocals (of which I have been a huge fan of for forever...I bought the Miseducation when it first came out), Wyclef's lyrics, and Pras's rhymes, this thing is the most amazing hip-hop experience anybody can ever have.

B000002KAT|5.0|I'm about to celebrate my 60th birthday, and every year has been filled with music. From Peggy Lee to The Everly Brothers to Buddy Holly to Tom and Jerry to...Kings of Leon. Sixty years of heavenly sounds and feelings.     But I never really liked Van Morrison. Thought his stuff was weird, a bit too self-conscious, sometimes annoyingly so. Joni MItchell has always been my number one, followed by Dylan, Neil Young, Springsteen, etc., etc...    Then I read an article in Rolling Stone about Morrison's Astral Weeks concert in LA. I became curious. Oddly enough, the CD was in my huge collection, although I couldn't remember ever listening to it. I put on my earbuds and let the music flow and wail through me. I cried, and I couldn't even follow all the words.     Now I have the lyrics. The Joycean lyrics. The \\"whatever they mean, they mean so, so much\\" lyrics. And I've been appreciating some of Morrison's other work.     I don't know what it is about Astral Weeks. Maybe it's the fact that the entire album was recorded in a matter of hours with musicians he didn't even know, creating a stream-of-consciousness quality in every note from every instrument. Or perhaps it's the fact that it was recorded at night, at an hour when every musician on the album, from Connie Kay on drums to John Payne on flute and soprano sax, was just tired out enough to be totally present and alive.    Whatever it is, Astral Weeks has touched me like no other piece of music ever has. And every time I listen, it makes me cry. Not from sadness, but from the very core of my soul.

Then I tried Kicking Television, and am now on to Being There and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.  I find YHF the least enjoyable of the four albums, and actually find it irritating to listen to, particularly in comparison to the beautiful musicality of the later two works (guitarist Nils Cline being a serious upgrade) and the beautiful simplicity of Being There.  The band seems to be playing with its toys, messing up otherwise good songs with out-of-place distortion and repetitive noises.  After reading about the struggle Wilco had to get this album issued, I really wanted to like it.  Instead, I have discovered why their former label hated it so.
0671605593|5.0|I remember on a vacation with one of my older friends who seems very clean and serene was talking about this book and he was serious when he said it changed his life. I held him to it by getting this book and reading it. I can see how people get bent up on the 3rd part (Religion) and the 4th part (Grace)where it might seem a little Christiany(I know that isn't a word), but try be a little open minded and take what you need and leave the rest.  I will say that the 1st and 2nd part (Discipline, Love) helped me look at how they are related and how an honest loving relationship is some serious hard work, not a lustful codependent mess which the fairytale media forces us to believe. I'm not getting on a soap box, just venting a pet peeve. This is an amazing book. Thank you Scott. Thank you very much.

The book is boldly written and doesn't hold back and that takes a great deal of courage to do with a subject as delicate as school shootings.<br /><br />  Nineteen minutes will hold the reader's attention by switching between different characters' point of views.  Jodi Picoult also switches the narration between many time important to the story.  It swaps settings and characters enough that the reader will not get bored but not so often that they'll get easily lost.<br /><br />  Not only does it change between characters frequently but it allows the reader to get to know each character well.  One finds by the end of the book that the reader  either love or hate almost every character introduced but at the same time the book doesn't have a set \\"bad guy\\", that is for the reader to decide for themselves.  By the end of the book we all know who is guilty and who isn't but we must decide for ourselves who is right and who is wrong.<br /><br />  Another reason this book is so great is that it involves the legal system and uses all sorts of political jargon but it is still easy to follow.  As a freshman in high school that has never even seen an episode of Law and Order, I was able to understand almost everything that was going on within the court.<br /><br />  Finally, this book was so realistic it was almost tragic.  Being in high school I see kids just like Peter, the murderer, who we all feel sorry for but don't know how to stand up for.  It scares me a bit to know what sort of anger they have pent up inside of them.  Even stronger than the fear is the sadness.  It's tragic to know that kids are going through such cruelty every day of their life but can't stand up for themselves.<br /><br />  This book will make you see the story that could be behind any high school massacre.  It takes events as tragic as this and turns it into a story that will touch the heart of anyone who reads it.  I highly recommend it.day of their life but can't stand up for themselves.             This book will make you see the story that could be behind any high school massacre.  It takes events as tragic as this and turns it into a story that will touch the heart of anyone who reads it.

078324228X|2.0|Denzel Washington is flawless in a terrible stinker of a corny, hackneyed, lopsided biopic of the life of Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter, a great boxer of the 60s who is imprisoned for 30 years on charges he participated in a triple murder and then ultimately released.  The material is fantastic: a terrible childhood, a mysterious murder, a successful man. But Denzel is the only person who overcomes the triteness of the script and ham-handedness of the direction. Despite Norman Jewison's efforts to canonize Rubin from the get-go, Denzel keeps it powerfully real.  Any scene he isn't in is just crap, however. This is not a movie to own. Ever. But it is worth renting.

I don't like how they did it, and I don't care for them changing her views on things at the last minute like that.  It was so stupid and annoying.  It was OK but after this, I won't read another book by Stephanie Meyer.  Totally turned me off her books.

B000VLOKQI|5.0|In my opinion, \\"The Kids are Alright\\" it the best rock documentary ever.  And that's because as originally presented, the material it covers and the way it handles the material is expert, right on the button, smoothly flowing, exciting, and informative, explosive stuff.  But then, what happens?  Well, if your music/rock-music appreciation is worth its salt at all, you want more, and in the case of the WHO, much, much more.  And that's exactly what you get in this package: 2 discs chock-full of information and anecdotes you've always wanted or never (too bad, you're getting it) wanted to know...ah well, I guess that's not exactly true - I mean, if you're a far gone full-goosed Who fanatic, perhaps you'd like to hear about each and every single sordid detail of Pete's, Roger's, John's, and Moonie's exploits. Nevertheless, for the price of admission, this little package is powerfully packed...somewhat you might say, like a certain quartet from Shepherds Bush.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|the reviews on this album are mixed and understandably so. playing the angel was a great record, an extension of the darkness we've come to known and love from the days of black celebration, sofd, and ultra. depeche mode has been around nearly 30 years by evolving their sound and style and it's clear that some of the new sounds on this album are not what most fans are used to and hence the disappointment. i myself prefer playing the angel over SOTU but that's not to say SOTU is a bad record. here is the kicker, the best tracks are on the deluxe box set, ghost, light, and oh well are all very good tracks and more \\"classic\\" depeche mode sounding.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I heard the reviews that this version was not even close to BBC series. I believed and didn't even bother to watch. Than I saw MacFadyen in Little Dorrit (Charles Dickens story) and I was left absolutely astonished by his work. Wanting more of his acting I purchased this one. What a disappointment! Everything is great in this movie EXCEPT for the actors or their portrayal of Austin's characters by the makers. Knightley made Lizzie look stupid with her out of place grins and smirks. Macfadyen's Darcy is too soft. Mr. Collins is not funny. Authors mocked his height. Is it all that you can laugh at in this character?!! I don't think so. They also made Bingley look absolutely dumb. Although I loved the cinematography, music, and costumes, I didn't enjoy the movie at all. Irritated most of the time. Sorry. Don't understand some exalted reviews posted here. As for MacFadyen - watch \\"Little Dorrit\\" BBC series, he is absolutely adorable there. Darcy is not for him for sure.

B001JNNDBA|1.0|I love this movie and would give it 5 stars. But the Blu-ray version is really bad. They didn't even make the special features in HD. The movie looks really bad. You can tell the difference by looking at the previews in the disc and then watching the movie. I am really disappointed in this.
B001UE276A|5.0|now that i have attended the touring of the universe concert, i have a new appreciation for this album.  it's not a traditional depeche mode album, but that's what makes this band so interesting, their constant evolution of sound and lyrics.  the opener for the tour, \\"in chains\\" is also the first song on the album, and it sounds absolutely great live.  i've also come to appreciate fragile tension, in sympathy (only played live a few times on the tour unfortunately), come back & wrong(great live songs).  corrupt is a darker track and a terrific way to end the playlist.  for those that buy the deluxe edition, some of the best tracks are on the deluxe box set, ghost, light, and oh well are all very good tracks and more \\"classic\\" depeche mode sounding. a true collector's item with all the great music and extras included in this set.

0316168815|4.0|Even though The Lovely Bones sounds like a depressing story, it is actually a story of hope and courage.  When I read reviews of this book, I wasn't sure if I would like it because it is about Susie, a girl who gets raped and murdered by her neighbor, George Harvey. Susie is about my age, so I thought it would be scary for me.    The whole story is told by Susie Salmon from heaven.  She shows how her family and friends struggle with her death, and how they recover from it.  The book goes through Susie's family and friends' stories and how they cope with her death.  The book shows how her father is so torn about losing his oldest daughter but stays strong for his family.  Her mom runs from the situation; she runs from all her responsibilities.  Susie's sister has a hard time with Susie's death as well.  She deals with it by not talking about it to anybody and just keeping to herself.  Buckley, Susie's little brother, doesn't know much about the death because he was so young when it happened, but he is upset about it.  Then there is Ruth, who was a classmate of Susie's.  Ruth takes on Susie's death as a project. She starts to research deaths and connect with them.  Susie watches from heaven all the ups and downs her family shares when getting through the tough times.  A weakness of this book is that it is to graphic and intense for some people.  Alice Sebold writes this story with amazing descriptive techniques.  She has a way of describing scenes to make them seem so realistic and vivid.  She also makes the book seem so mysterious.  Alice Sebold especially knows how to get into George Harvey's mind.  She can put the situation in his perspective very well.  Alice Sebold wrote this book to show that there are many terrible things in this world, and that different people deal with situations differently.  I think she accomplishes this goal very well by putting you in all the characters' different stories.   I would highly recommend this book to anybody who is looking for a good read.  The Lovely Bones is a book that the reader will not want to stop reading once he picks it up.  I loved this book, and I am a teenager who doesn't like to read very often.
B0002KVULG|4.0|There are many great Dracula films, and this one is definitely one of greats at least in my opinion, I saw this version years ago, and back when I first saw it I didnt quite fully appreciate it then, I guess its because I was a bit to young then, I remember seeing it with my big sister and I also remember the two of us laughing at the love scene between Frank Langella character and Kate Nelligan, it was the love scene with psychedelic red laser lights haha, and now when I watch it today I still find that scene a bit funny and cheesy but to spite that scene I still enjoyed this film a lot lol     The DVD is has some great extra stuff like interviews with Frank Langella, and the director, and I enjoyed watching the extras and getting a little insight into how the film was made, and what happened during the film shoot, and ironically frank didn't like the laser light scene ether lol, but I must say frank played one of the most sexy versions of Dracula, I think this film should have gotten way more notoriety then it did, because everyone in this film did a great job over all, and I definitely think this film got lost in the shuffle because there has been so many versions made over the years, and because of that I think this version sometimes gets forgotten, but I think that if you love vampire films like I do then check this one out, its one of the best do overs made.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|If you are sick of wasting your time watching lame TV shows, watch Supernatural instead! This show has been great from the start and it only gets better! I love this show and look forward to it every week! Seldom does a TV show or movie surprise me.  I usually can predict the end to any TV show or movie without even having to watch it. But Supernatural still manages to surprise me! The stories are intelligent, well written, exciting,  and do not disappoint!  The characters, Sam and Dean, are well rounded, interesting and fun!  This is one of the best shows on TV and only gets better all the time!

B000002G26|4.0|As just a casual fan of this balladeer this release suits me perfectly. Not only does it include the mega hits like Summer of '69 which has been played ad nauseum since it's release but also the plethora of more mid level hits - and it's these that really make this album.<br /><br />Of course with a greatest hits package you will always get some anorak who complains that such and such a track from an obscure ep from 1983 really should of been here. But fans such as that already own all the albums anyway and can make their own best of for highway use and abuse. For the rest of us, given that Adams' ballads can be both tear jerking and vomit inducing in almost equal measure, just a single album of salient tracks is probably the way to go.<br /><br />Ultimately the best advert for this release is the track listing. Your either on board or your not though IMHO for every clunker like Kids Wanna Rock there are tunes that work their innocent charms quite independantly of the listeners free will, such as Run To You and Can't Stop This Thing We Started.<br /><br />I actually caught the tour to support this release when it passed through Australia and even though my mates and I were more used to the environs of, say, a Metallica concert, we really did enjoy the upbeat verve of the rock 'n' roll show Adams put on.<br /><br />Heartily recommended for anyone who has hummed along to his radio hits but doesn't want to litter their CD shelf with the somewhat more dubious delights of the mans full catalogue even if it is bereft of any liner notes or anecdotes.

B001TH16DS|5.0|I spent a good portion of the weekend watching the first season on Blu Ray. Can't add annything more to the technical reviews but I can say that I am very satisfied. 65.00 for 7 disks with 8 plus episodes (4 with new effects + 4 original) on each disk is a great deal to me.

B000A2GREQ|4.0|The money grabbing reunion tour aside, The Police did what few bands do - split up before their almost inevitable commercial and artistic wane. As such they have their reputation as a musical unit largely intact regardless of what may be said about some of the members individually.<br /><br />This disc is perfect for the casual fan such as myself. I get the hits, a few songs that probably could of been and a couple of extra bits. A concise sixteen tracks of music that is useful to have lying around for when you want to hear the pop tunes of The Police and their decidedly early 80's feeling melodies, complete with flirtations with reggae time signatures in places with Stings' beguiling vocal monotone laid over the top.<br /><br />Acolytes will want all the studio albums but for me this was exactly what I needed to give me the salient points of this bands career.

B000PMFS2I|2.0|Showgirls starring Elizabeth Berkley is complete and utter trash but this film does have cult-status so I give it two stars instead of one. Berkley is no actress, she wasn't even that good on Saved by the Bell. Kyle MacLachlan always plays a creep well but otherwise than that Showgirls lacks sensuality. Horrible film from a good director.

0385333846|5.0|It's quite difficult to throw a few stars and some constructive criticism at Slaughterhouse Five and call it a day. It feels a lot like reviewing the toothpick stuck through an impeccably-made, piping-hot corned-beef sandwich served on rye in Ireland on Saint Patrick's Day; it's just the tool used to consolidate a solar system's worth of meaty goodness. Slaughterhouse is the toothpick that keeps Kurt Vonnegut's epic account of life as a man in the 20th century from reaching critical mass and swallowing him whole, turning him into the 1974 equivalent of a Britney-venerating, codine-snarfing vegetable. Slaughterhouse is the Narnia in the back of his closet, where specters of his experiences with life, death, time, war, nature, and people can run circles around each other, freed from a chasm in his brain that required far more than savvy with a typewriter to extract. This review is tough, because I'm not fussing over a neat little book filled with numbered chapters and linear mumbling. I'm reviewing a man.    Nothing about the book can be described \\"in a nutshell.\\" Without getting specific, Slaughterhouse Five is the story a man named Billy Pilgrim, whose life is documented by in-story Kurt Vonnegut, whose documentations are arranged and edited by real-life Kurt Vonnegut. Yikes. Well, what does Billy Pilgrim do? He lives his life: goes to war, marries, has children, becomes an optometrist, gets in a plane crash, is abducted by aliens, travels through time, et cetera. Okay... What does in-story Vonnegut do? He witnesses Billy's life. But... What does Kurt in the Flesh do? He uses in-story Kurt's witnessing of Billy's life to tell his own story about the hellacious firebombing of Dresden during World War Two, which only exists between the lines. The quirkiness is relentless. The kicker is, it takes careful reading of the entire book just to be aware of the three entities' coexistences; they're seamlessly integrated. They have to be, or else Vonnegut wouldn't have been able to detach enough to pick his life apart and call it art. Slaughterhouse Five is the grain alcohol of literature: frighteningly potent and impossible to drink without three people and a whole lot to mix with. Take one part Vonnegut, one part imaginary Vonnegut, one part Pilgrim, three parts Dresden Vintage Neutral-Grain Spirit, and a dash of bitters. Shake vigorously.    Instead of providing his readers with food for thought, he gives them his thoughts for food. Vonnegut does not want to discuss Dresden, the (aesthetic) topic of the book; he wants readers to come to a certain understanding about it without directly saying a word, like leading a thirsty horse toward water using a puppet. He understates most major events in Billy's life with the catch-all statement, \\"so it goes.\\" Dead baby? \\"So it goes.\\" Going to war? \\"So it goes.\\" Reflecting on some of the most cruel synapses ever fired by human brains? \\"So it goes.\\" When he does go into detail, though, his rhetoric sometimes makes Shakespeare's Sonnets read like street signs. I'm not sure if I've seen a more pleasing balance struck among eloquence, articulation, power, and brevity in 15 years of literacy.   If I had to guess when Vonnegut wrote Slaughterhouse Five, and I was born at any point in time after March of 1945, I'd probably say yesterday. Its relevance will barely even be diminished when we're all speaking Chinese in 2013, and even then I'm sure the translation will be fairly poignant. Vonnegut is an old man with a young mind; an old dog who learns new tricks and then offers Ph.D-level classes in them. It's a book about duality and paradox: a perpetual moment in time, overstating the shadow and understating the substance that casts it; life and death. The preface provides the operative definition by which I am reviewing this book: \\"There is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre.\\" He didn't try to. He said something true about a massacre, and then wrapped his entire life around it. In doing so, hesaid something true about all that is sacred to mankind. And he said it well. Five stars.
B00001OH80|5.0|For the life of me, this David Bowie fan cannot fathom why just about everyone and their best friend, including hard-core Bowie fans, has slammed on this sublime recording, which is just as entertaining and fun and classy as anything else The Gentleman (as I refer to him, cap T, cap G) has ever done record-wise.<br />  Loving The Alien, the opening tune, is as lush and lovely and grand a painting in sound as the title track of Bowie's classic Aladdin Sane, between the gorgeous instrumentals and The Gentleman's sensuous yet angelic voice. Only Bowie can make a song about religion sound sexy!<br /><br />  Tumble and Twirl, Dancing with the Big Boys, Blue Jean, and Neighborhood threat are not only candy for the ears but fuel for the legs. I can't listen to those songs and NOT want to dance<br /><br /> In my opinion, Bowie's cover of God Only Knows is so exquisite and romantic and seductive it makes the original sound like an advertising jingle by comparison (no offense to Brian Wilson and his Beach Boys cohorts :-) )<br /><br />The title track, a duet with Tina Turner, is a masterpiece, and Don't Look Down is a delightful foray into reggae a la Bowie.<br /><br />I think this work of audio art should have won a Grammy award, and I kind of wonder if those who slam on it do so because they were expecting Ziggy Revisited or Let's Dance Part II. Hah! Everyone knows that The Gentleman's trademark is to always delight his fans with something different -- and delightful, and he succeeds beautifully with this gem of a recording! If I could give it 10 stars I would
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I never watch television. I'm something of a TV snob and the only show I ever watched \\"religiously\\" was \\"The West Wing\\" because I found it intellectually stimulating. When my mother raved about \\"Castle\\" I didn't take it too seriously because she is of the \\"American Idol\\" school of thought and watches whatever is on. Imagine my surprise when I found this show to be a deliciously witty, clever hour of television. The dialogue crackles and Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic have incredible chemistry. There's no hint of two-dimensional personalities on this show, and the one liners leave me laughing for days afterwards. \\"Castle\\" has wide appeal, and it's an all-around good show. There is no gratuitous violence, the writing is intelligent and sharp, and the actors are phenomenal. I'll be recommending this show to my TV snob and non-TV snob friends because in either case, \\"Castle\\" is a fun show for whomever watches it.

0307269752|3.0|This book was recommended to me by a colleague who said he missed his morning subway stop a few times due to being engrossed in this book. Maybe that led me to go into this with excessive expectations. Anyway, the book takes a while to crank up. While it eventually becomes clear why all the backstory on the protagonists is necessary, the backstory struggled to keep me interested. It wasn't until I had pushed halfway in that I had any inkling of how rapidly the twists would start coming. Some of the challenge is due to the Lisbeth character being quite one dimensional. Larsson makes such an effort to portray her as disaffected and aloof that I had no connection to her at all. Until the ending chapters, she struck me as an automaton present only to advance the story.<br /><br />I do not read a lot of modern thrillers and crime dramas any more. Blame Turow and Grisham for burning me out in the 1990s. Larsson's tale builds much more slowly than those, but ends with excellent satisfaction.  I do plan on reading the second in the trilogy.
B001TH16DI|1.0|The German edition of this product has already been released last week. As this is an international Paramount release, I presume the quality will be the same as the US product.    All films are HEAVILY degrained and DNRd (high frequency filtering/\\"noise reduction\\"). Almost every fine detail is lost due to this heavy digital processing. Faces look like wax figures from Madame Tussaud's.     The transfers seem to be based on the 2001 remasters. In addition to  that, Star Trek IV, V and VI seem to be old interlaced transfers derived from old 1080i transfers. The degraining on these films is even more obvious and very annoying.    Sorry to say, Paramount, but this is a pure TRAVESTY.
B00008OLYN|4.0|I was never a death or extreme metal fan.  So Opeth was never my thing.  But when I started hearing tracks from this surprisingly atmospheric release on Pandora, it captured me lock, stock and barrel.  There is little to nothing on this album which could be classified as heavy metal, but what it does have is a reflective, moody and sometimes idyllic motif that completely immerses the listener in a beautifully mournful sound scape.  Despite this, the songs also carry a strain of hope and survival in the face of loss.  Musically, it will recall progressive and atmospheric metal groups like Riverside and Porcupine Tree, though with more acoustic rhythm guitar.  This has the effect of making the soaring, emotionally satisfying electric leads stand out even more than if they were part of a high-tech wall of sound.    Another highlight of this recording that many prog rock fans will celebrate is Stephen Wilson's (of Porcupine Tree) production.  Even without seeing the credits, his presence is strongly felt and will be noticed by fans of his work.  His guidance brings Opeth's considerable talents to even greater heights, bringing the wistful and mysterious side of their nature to an unforgettable fore.  Indeed, Damnation casts a contemplative spell on it's audience that will linger on long after the chosen media player stops.  Powerful stuff, indeed, and a welcome moment of solace in a usually graceless and unimaginative era of modern rock.  Without a single weak moment on it, this album is worth buying and listening to in it's entirety and the sequence it was intended.  Downloading an individual track or two is a waste of time, money and consideration.

0525421033|3.0|Maybe I'm just a little too old for this book. The basic premise drew me in, but after the pivitol event, the book was basically all about flashback events. The present-moment events were a little corny and far-fetched. I understand that the target audience was teenage girls (a la Twilight) and maybe that's why the author didn't delve into the pain of loss more than she did. I like a little more meat in my novels. I think The Lovely Bones took this out-of-body perspective a little farther and pulled it off a little better. I'd recommend this novel to a younger audience though (13-18). I actually think this book may make a better movie.

B001IBIQU6|1.0|After \\"Playing the angel\\" and \\"Exciter\\" I nearly wrote the band off as once great band running out of steam. Then I saw \\"Wrong\\" on youtube before the album came out and spark inside me turned into a flame of hope - I thought \\"Finally, DM is back! This is the sound!\\". I waited anxiously for the album, hyped it to my friends and bought concert tickets before even having heard the latest opus. \\"Surely, with a track like \\"Wrong\\" being on the album, the rest of it has to be just as great!\\", I thought. I even watched the little snippets in the studio DM posted online. The excitement was building to the point of frenzy. And here we are... much like those folks in certain mail-order game rental company - I was bawling and screaming and kicking and punching after hearing the album. It was not an emotion of joy. It was emotion of being duped. Ripped off. Cheated. Lied to. Like being told there are no presents and there's no Santa on X-mass morning. Like being told your winning lottery ticket is just a dream. Like being told Depeche Mode has finally died and some Vegas impersonator sound-alike band took its place with it's own lousier material. Aside from \\"wrong\\" and perhaps 2 other tracks, the rest of the album was similar to watching an awful car wreck in slow-motion. It was simply sickening to hear so much effort that went into sound design, mastering, and texture that went... nowhere. From overly-processed vocals to most digital sounding analog gear I've ever heard, the album was something that should have been and could have been amazing but instead it took a melancholy, depressing road to self-elimination.     I'm selling off my DM tickets, turning in my fan club membership, relegating this once great band to the bargain bin at your local supermarket henceforth.     DM is dead. Long live DM. Thanks for the memories. R.I.P.

B0013URJTG|5.0|Every PT album I get seems to be better than the one before it. There isn't a weak song on it. I highly recommend it.
B000002H2H|4.0|A concept album about death. If that isn't heavy metal, I don't know what is. The songs that make up Metallica's second album, particularly \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls,\\" \\"Fade To Black,\\" and \\"The Call Of Ktulu,\\" are among the chunkiest and most jagged milestones in the history of rock music. The guitars are swathed in corrugated industrial screech, the vocals sound like doom raining down from a thundering sky, and the rhythms charge like bulls at a momentarily distracted matador. And the lyrics, as I've previously established, are mostly about dying. Sometimes, the words are springboards for social commentary; \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" takes nuclear paranoia to its logical conclusion, and the title track is a verbally intense screed against the death penalty. At other times, like in the surprisingly tender \\"Fade To Black,\\" the words are darkly introspective. And sometimes, they're jut plain gruesome. Listen to \\"Trapped Under The Ice\\" and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />The big classics include \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls,\\" with its complex guitar progression and wailing chorus, as well as the claustrophobic title track, the fire-and-brimstone violence of \\"Creeping Death,\\" and the aforementioned sweetness of \\"Fade To Black.\\" The rest isn't quite as good, although I most certainly do dig the menacing guitar patterns and general Lovecraftiness of \\"The Call Of Ktulu.\\" I guess I could live without \\"Escape\\" and \\"Fight Fire With Fire,\\" both of which kinda sorta drag. But otherwise, Ride The Lightning is damn good. And I love the cover art, too.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|I feel in love with Keith's music by accidentally catching a glimpse of the song/video 'Everybody' 2 years ago on CMT, and then proceeded to buy the CD and fell in love with each song (18kids). Now I am his biggest fan, there is no other like Keith. This new album does justice to his talent, and beauty within. Everytime I listen to it I discover a new fav song. Right now I think I enjoy all the songs. I particulary enjoy 'Only you can love me this way' because of the guitar piece, it's just amazing!! Fantastic job Keith! I will see you at Mohegan Sun in a week. xx
0321356683|5.0|El libro de mayor nivel que he leído hasta la fecha, con el que se pueden aprender cosas que sólo una experiencia de décadas al más alto nivel de programación y diseño puede proporcionar.   Imprescindible.
B001UREJWM|5.0|They have risen once more!!!!!!  This is the most powerful music that I had heard in years.  Tony, Dio, Geezer, Vinny.....what can be said?  This is one CD that was worth the wait.  I never heard anything so blended together so well.  Tony's guitar playing along with Geezer's bass was mind blowing, deep and heavy!  Mix that in with Dio's ever so awesome sounding voice and Vinny's heart pounding drums and you have one of the most mind blowing CD's put out in the last 10 years.  Hope to see you all on tour.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|I love this Movie and the seller sent me exactly the item described. The movie is authentic Disney, and it has extras of 1951 footage when the movie was barely released. I love this film and im very happy i was able to find it on amazon.
B0010HOZX0|5.0|This movie was delivered as advertised, on time and in perfect condition.  Will use this Amazon supplier again.
B000002J1L|4.0|Like Selling England, this album has more than it's share of epic songs. Particularly The Musical Box and the Fountains of Salamaicis (I'm sure I misspelled). Definetely one of Genesis' top three Gabriel era albums. I think more specifically than progressive (which this album is the embodiement of that word) the sound of this album is symphonic. Highly arranged, with mellotrons and layers of piano, organ, and guitar. Even the word timeless seems weak when describing the Musical Box and the other highlights of Nursery Cryme. It sounds as if five modern day musicians (relatively modern) traveled back in time to Victorian England with 20th Century instruments and played for the Queen. It somehow exists outside of time. What is truly amazing about this album is that the members of the band were all in their early twenties except Phil Collins who was 19. Yet they somehow sound like they have been around for decades. Peter Gabriel's voice has so much soul and character that it is hard to invision the scrawny punk with a reverse mohawk that he was. I'm probably one of the very few Genesis fan's that ranks this one above Foxtrot. Great album, brilliant musicians. The only reason I didn't give this album 5 stars is because of the song sung by Phil Collins. I really do like Collins, particularly his drumming but that song seems really out of place. On a different note, am I the only one who thinks Phil Collins singing on subsiquent Genesis albums and solo albums was extremely influenced by Peter Gabriel? I've talked to people who confuse the two voices. I personally prefer Gabriel's voice and I never confuse the two. However, it is interesting to hear the similarity.
0783226888|2.0|This remake of the classic Forsyhte's best seller, was directed by the hypertalented Fred Zinemmann. I should admit the first half of this remake really captured the full attention of the audience.<br /><br />Bruce Willis made his second best acting after \\"Twelve monkeys\\", despite of the fact he doesn't get to acquire the gelid expression of Edward Fox, he gets to involve the spectator.<br /><br />The problem with the film resides in the unnecesary amount of secondary roles, with Sydney Poitier looking extremely uncomfortable with the role, with Richard Gere whose baby face makes incredible his role as an Irish terrorist and the presence of a Russian agent makes the movie had fallen into a very entangled web of dramatic lines whose final resolution affects the primary plot.
0439796636|5.0|More akin to Robert Graves' \\"Goodby to All That\\" than \\"Black Beauty,\\" this is a fast-paced tale of animals at war.  It is not for the faint-hearted.  Death is a pale rider here.  Joey, a farm horse from rural England, is \\"drafted\\" to into WW 1.  His owner's son volunteers to accompany Joey.  They are reunited at the end of a horrific (but not unrealistic) campaign.  Happy ending.  I wept at several places.  Outstanding book!  Now a smash play in London, with \\"Lion King\\" oversize horse puppets manipulated by 3 actors apiece.  I wish I could see it!  In fact, a photo from the production set me off to find \\"War Horse,\\" not being a horse lover myself.  It's a really good book.  Readers may also enjoy Jilly Cooper's \\"Animals at War.\\"
B000W91RUG|5.0|This show is by far one of the best shows on TV! There's not a single episode that doesn't make me laugh out loud at least once, usually several times and often uncontrollably. I could watch them over and over and they're just as funny every time! Even purchased this a Christmas gift for a friend and she loves it as much as I do. I'm equally enjoying the 2nd season and look forward to being able to buy it as well. I hope this show is around for many years to come!
B001GCUO1G|1.0|This movie was awful! I can't believe that they spent 150 million dollars on this movie, because I honestly have no clue where they spent it all. This movie feels like it was written by an 8 year old with ADHD, because it's rife with cliches, has no character development, is full of throwaway mutant guest characters, and feels like it's trying to kick you out of the theater with its pacing to let the next batch of customers in. This movie is a perfect example of how far Fox has fallen as a studio, and how out of touch they are with people who like good movies. I don't even read the X-men comics, but as a fan of the other 3 movies I thought this one was a disaster. Save your money and see something better!
B0013FFMOK|4.0|This is a fair remake of the great Charlton Heston movie.. Omega Man..First 3/4 of movie was good... Last 1/4 was weak...Mr Smith's acting was fair to good....
B001T30232|5.0|with out a doubt this is the first book in a LONG time to grab me and make it hard to put down.. I absolutely loved it and fell in love with enzo as well!..cannot say enough good things about the book,,, the story, the characters, funny,,,sad,,, and everything in between!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I LOVE this dvd.  You only have to workout for 20 minutes and it really packs it all in there!  It is NO joke about the levels but I promise if you push yourself to get through the first few days of it you will be keeping up and still getting a good burn from it! If you don't have a lot of time to workout and want to get your cardio, strength training and some ab work in all in 20 minutes...you will LOVE this.  I have been doing this for two weeks and am losing inches AND I have lost 12 lbs of the 30 I want to lose.
B00004WN62|5.0|I can only agree with the review by J. P. Flanagan.    This is the back-to-black reissue, by \\"Universal Music Group\\", and I prefer it to Classic Records' mono version too (it's also a lot cheaper!)
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|For years now, the Academy Award has eluded David Fincher despite the consistently good work that he has produced. Films like [[ASIN:B000050FEN Seven (New Line Platinum Series)]] and [[ASIN:B00003W8NM Fight Club (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] were too extreme for the play-it-safe Academy voters and [[ASIN:B000069HZP The Game]] and [[ASIN:B0001AVZCQ Panic Room (3-Disc Special Edition)]] were genre exercises that never would have had a shot anyway. The complete snubbing of [[ASIN:B000XCZGV8 Zodiac - The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]], Fincher's best film to date, was unforgivable but, sadly, not surprising. And then along comes The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, a touching tale about a tragic romance spanning the entire lives of two people, one of whom ages in reverse.<br /><br />The first disc features an audio commentary by director David Fincher. He talks about the arduous task of applying Cate Blanchett's old age makeup and how it affected her performance. He talks about how they avoided sappy sentimentality whenever possible. Fincher also talks about how they cast various roles in the film and what they were looking for. He tells all kinds of interesting and engaging filming anecdotes about the challenges of shooting on location with his trademark dry sense of humour. This is another outstanding track by Fincher as he offers eloquent observations and tells entertaining stories.<br /><br />As with all special edition DVDs of Fincher's films, Benjamin Button documents various aspects of the production in detail. Entitled, \\"The Curious Birth of Benjamin Button,\\" this making of documentary is broken down into several digestible sections.<br /><br />\\"The First Trimester\\" documents the pre-production phase and Fincher kicks things off with a surprisingly moving preface where he recounts the death of his father and how that drew him closer to the material. This section takes us through the origins of the project and how Steven Spielberg almost did it with Tom Cruise. We go through the long screenwriting process that lasted several years. We also see Fincher and his crew scouting locations that would span several years and countries. Also included are storyboard and art direction galleries.<br /><br />\\"The Second Trimester\\" examines principal photography with all kinds of behind-the-scenes footage. We see several sets being built with various key crew members talking about their work on the film. Several major cast members talk about how they got involved and their impressions of the film and of Fincher's legendary reputation. We also get to see how the tugboat was built on a soundstage where all of its scenes were shot. There is fascinating insight into the elaborate aging makeup. Aspects of costume design are also covered, including a gallery.<br /><br />\\"Third Trimester\\" takes a look at the film's groundbreaking visual effects. We see, in great detail, how they seamlessly digitally grafted Brad Pitt's face onto other actor's bodies. It is amazing to see just how much work was involved. We also see how they did the CGI for the tugboat scenes and other things, like the background plates for scenes that took place in exotic locations. Other aspects, like sound design and Alexandre Desplat's atmospheric score, are examined. It's great to see Desplat at work and interview soundbites where he talks about his working method.<br /><br />\\"Birth\\" features footage of the film's premiere in New Orleans with the cast and crew reflecting on the experience of making the film and what it means to them. Also included is a gallery of production stills.<br /><br />Finally, there are two theatrical trailers.e. We go through the long screenwriting process that lasted several years.

B00000J7SS|5.0|Experiencing Bitches Brew is like journeying through a dense forest of sounds somewhere in the depths of the cosmos.     Recorded in the days after Jimi Hendrix's performance at Woodstock August 1969, this is an album of tremendous vision and feeling. Miles had been searching for this and only a genius like him could pull this off, so when he assembled this great cast of musicians - John McLaughlin, Joe Zawinul, Jack DeJonette, Chick Corea, Wayne Shorter, Dave Holland, Lenny White, among others - something might've happened that deeply inspired him which as a consequence inspired everybody else altogether.     The production is also visionary and credit must be given to the mighty Teo Macero who impeccably steered the six musical journeys on the album.     It is surely not for everyone, might be impenetrable to unlearned ears and will create an aura of uneasiness around the room. So be warned, if you haven't experienced Bitches Brew yet, get yourself prepared as it will shake your senses whether you want it or not.     A million stars for Miles Davis and all the others who helped make Bitches Brew such a defining moment in musical perception!
B001IBIQU6|5.0|This album is an album you can play over and over again.  It offers so much variety that tracks this band's evolution(you'll hear touches, of their 80's style, 90's rock, and still paving that synth sound).  Come Back, Little Soul, Peace, Wrong are great songs.  Ghost and Oh Well are also great extras.  I highly recommned this album!
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I wasn't sure if \\"Lonesome Dove\\" would hold up. Hard to believe it's been two decades since it was first broadcast?! My wife and I planned on watching this DVD over a couple of nights, as the entire program clocks in at about 6 hours.<br /><br />Well any fear I may have had that \\"Lonesome Dove\\" would seem dated, or that it couldn't possibly be as good as remembered was put to bed after the first 10 minutes.<br /><br />This fantastic adaptation of Larry McMurtry's novel has stood the test of time. If anything it's gotten even better with age! Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones as Texas Ranger Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call have created career defining characters.<br /><br />The basic story is that the two Rangers decide to have one last adventure in the waning days of \\"the Old West\\". Driving a stolen herd of cattle from Mexico up to the Montana Territory to start a new ranch in one of the last \\"wild\\" places remaining in the new nation. Of course, the cattle drive is simply window dressing. The real reason to watch the film is the bond and friendship between the two men. Watching these two men deal with life, love and loss on the trail through the American midwest is so engrossing and entertaining that you hate to see the story come to an end. This is a character driven story, and you really come to love these characters. \\"Lonesome Dove\\" is full of twists and turns, at times you will be chuckling and in the next moment you'll have a lump in your throat and tears in your eyes.<br /><br />Fans of the novels will really enjoy this faithful adaptation as well. While it would be impossible to delve into as much detail as McMurtry provides in the books, \\"Dove\\" does not only a great job packing so much of the novel into it's six hours, it is also able to capture the feel and spirit of McMurtry's tale (If only they had taken as much care and time with the other films in the \\"Lonesome Dove\\" series of films)<br /><br />To illustrate just how engrossing this film is, while my wife and I planned on spooling this film out over several evenings...once we started watching it, we couldn't turn it off! We have a marathon viewing of the entire series in just one sitting! Fantastic, and highly recommended.ut over several evenings...once we started watching it, we couldn't turn it off!

B000NY17J6|5.0|Was a nostalgic reminder of so many of her great hits and was pleased with the fidelity too.
630587493X|5.0|This is a thought provoking, albeit somewhat predictable presentation of our difficult questions on what constitutes a sentient being.  The appropriately calm pace of action supports reflection on the topic while adding to the enjoyment of this finely made movie.  Robin Williams performance is stellar!  Sam Neill as his \\"owner\\" is sensitive.  Highly recommend!
B001F290E4|5.0|I have always loved soul music, grew up on it. These covers by Seal are wonderful. He has found a great group to perform, some not as well known but each showcases his talents. Emotional investment, feelings and perfect voice for soul music. Just great.
0790729725|3.0|Goodfellows got alot of attention when it came out. I think Miller's Crossing and Casino were alot better.
1416550534|5.0|This book was absolutely mesmerizing from the very first page.  I loved the characters, the plot, everything about it.  Grace, the narrator, is nearly 100 years old and remembering her life as a young woman when she served in one of the grandest houses in England.  The story of the decline of the family that she served is symbolic of the story of the decline of the entire British aristocracy during and shortly after WWI.  This book is reminiscent of Atonement and Remains of the Day in that respect.  There is also, however, a mysterious secret that Grace has kept through all of her life.  As she remembers the past, the mystery slowly reveals itself and yet, the final reveal at the very end still takes you by surprise.  I now look forward to reading Kate Morton's future books with great anticipation though I think it will be hard to top the enjoyment from The House at Riverton.
031606792X|5.0|This is by far, the greatest book of the series, and one of the best books I've ever read.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Never has a show absorbed me, captured my imagination and, yes, challenged me in the ways that LOST has. This seemingly simple premise of a group of strangers crashing on an island and hoping for rescue has, in just 5 short seasons, given way to the most labyrinthine serialized TV plot currently (or perhaps ever) in existence. This season in particular has taken the labyrinthine qualities to another level. There's time travel, hidden connections being revealed, explanations of long-held secrets and questions, and, yes, more questions and cliffhangers than you can shake a fist at. Just a great great great show! :)
B00011F5DK|4.0|This is a game that is not too complicated to learn - just open the box, quickly read directions, and start playing.  It is better suited to four people than two, but two, three, or four can play.  With two people, the game is too easy.  It is a fun game that is great for all ages - grandma and grandpa can play it with the grandkids.
2090338628|5.0|\\"Grammaire Progressive du Français\\" is an excellent work book for students transitioning from the intermediate to advanced level of French. The layout of the information is clear and the exercises are helpful, you will of course need to purchase the book of \\"corriges\\" to receive the greatest benefit. I would highly recommend it.    Bon Chance!
B000065B2A|5.0|Excellent movie:  action/suspense, humor, and moral dilemma.  Perfect demonstration of a kid trying to \\"break from the tribe\\" and of people learning to see past the imposed cultural stereotypes and portals, whether looking at themselves or others.
0385736002|5.0|The Alchemyst is a wonderful start to what I am sure will be an absolutely amazing 6 book series in total.  The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel series has 2 books out so far and the third due out at the end of May 2009. This series contains magic, mythology, adventure and mysteries yet to be solved.      Twins Sophie and Josh, two ordinary teenagers in current times, find themselves in a world they thought they understood.  They quickly learn that many mythological beings and people from history that are thought were long dead or never existed, are alive today with magical abilities.  Guided by the 500 plus year old Nicholas Flamel, Sophie and Josh begin to learn that they are perhaps the twins prophesied about in an ancient book called the codex, which has been stolen from Flamel, by the devious Dr. John Dee.  Flamel believes if he can awaken the twins magical powers and can get them trained in the elemental magics they may be able to find the codex and save the world from the dark elders.    I highly recommend this series to anyone, especially if you are looking to add a little magic and adventure into you life.  The Alchemyst is a must read for all ages!
1416972242|5.0|This is book was absolutely amazing!  I enjoyed all of the Mortal Instruments books. Cassandra Clare is an awesome aurthor. I would recomend this book to any body who likes mystical type books. If you are going to read the books, though, you need to read them in order.  Order: City of Bones, City of Ashes, City of Glass  All of the books are fabulous!
0312360266|5.0|She read all 4 books in less than two weeks so it must be good. One issue though. I do wish books had ratings. I truely hope its appropriate for a 13 year old.
1416914307|5.0|City of Glass is, in my opinion, the best book out of the entire series!  So many twists and turns, it will have you reading it till the end of the night. I wasn't able to put the book down, and finished it in record time.  You should difinitly read this book, especially if you are into mystical readings. Make sure to read them in order, though.  Order: City of Bones, City of Ashes, City of Glass  Amazing books! I hope you read and enjoy!
B00138H6OG|5.0|Everybody's agreeing about Reign in Blood being excellent (and it is). Seasons in.. and South of.. appear to provoke a lot more YES/NO/BUT/THIS/THAT. And that's exactly what these albums are about. You'll have to listen twice if you're addicted to the speed of Reign in.. But if you're up to HEAVY, if you're looking for the absolute best in trash metal, looking for the best compositions, the best drums (hail to you Dave), Arraya at the top of his voice and riffs that are still being copied but have only seldomly been improved upon, this is the one to buy.
0316017922|4.0|This will be short: the story in the book about the Korean airline crashes wrt the culture of the pilots has helped me a lot in the workplace. Knowing that my Asian report does not feel free to disagree with me because I am his superior, and also that it is my duty as listener to understand what he says (as opposed to his duty as speaker to make himself understood,) has made it immensely easier to figure out what is going on when communication goes astray. It was worth reading this book just to get the cultural insights it provided.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|THIS COLLECTION IS AWESOME--THE PRICE WAS RIGHT,THE DVD'S ARE PRICELESS AND I RECOMMEND THEM TO ALL THAT LOVE NATURE AND OUR PLANET.

B00004Y6NP|3.0|Everyone knows this album so I'm not going to review the content all over again. I've bought this album more than once, so I do like it. It's a great classic.     The issue to me is what do you get when you buy the resissued, remastered versions? I've carefully listened to most of the Dire Straits remasters. The Japanese SHM-CDs, especially the early albums, sound phenomenal. Most are well worth the money. However, something changes when you get to the 1985 Brothers In Arms album. It's only slightly better then previous versions. It still sounds thin like a digital recording. Why ? Because it is. In my opinion they made a bad choice when they chose to do a full digital recording, which back in 1984-85 was new and untested technology in the early years of the digital recording era.     The Analog to Digital Converters are far better now and they keep getting better. Great news for continually remastering old analog recordings. But not for Brothers in Arms because they can't go back. The binary bits are the same as when they were set in stone nearly 25 years ago. For the same reason releasing this album on vinyl or SACD makes absolutely no sense to me either. Though it may make business sense for the record company. Thus, take it for what is is, one of the first entirely digital recorded albums.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|This is a movie I could watch over and again, the scenery and wonderful actors made you feel like you were right there with the movie.  Along with the movie I was given quite a lot of education about this country and how it was so many years ago, as she is Nicole Kidman, the drama was great, not just a good movie but giving some of us the education of how these people had to live, the hardships, and heart breaks, especially an education of that I never knew but another I do recommend to own, my family really enjoyed this movie.
B001PPLIEQ|4.0|I am a big 007 fan and has been from the moment I saw my first James Bond ( the spy who loved me). As a fan I've realised the studio has moved away from the \\"swave\\" JB looks to a more realistic rude,egocentric super macho image, which is fine with me. I think they have done a terrific job with Casino Royale and this one is a continuation of where JB left off in Casino R.    This is a shorter 007 movie and it's like a rollercoaster ride. It's filled with action which sometimes becomes a tag too much. The new 007 series miss the womanizer 007 use to be and the drop dead gorgeous woman off the past (although I'm not saying these new woman are not beautiful)and that is too bad. I has to have a little of that touch.    Still, it's a very good movie that keeps you on the tip of the chair for the whole ride. It's very enjoyable and a movie fans and NON fans will love. A must see for all action lovers.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|This is a great collection.  Takes the place of my old VCR tape version.  Loved the extras - Frankenweenie and Vincent.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|After I got over the fact that one of my favorite stories was being completely destroyed, I actually loved this movie!  I think the hardest thing for Austen fans is the fact that our story has been altered. (I say our, because what Austen enthusiast does not see these timeless stories as their own)Once that has been overcome, you can enjoy this movie. Free your mind and the laughs will follow.  And this Darcy... my goodness! You'll also see Wickham in a wonderful new light.  Give it a chance!
B00007KWHG|5.0|Felt like I was a teenager all over again, excellent. The songs just take you away.

B00133KFGW|5.0|\\"The music is all around, all you have to do...is listen\\", August Rush     Evan is an 11 year boy, who lived all his life in an adoption agency, waiting all his life to find his parents, whom he is sure love him and can't wait to see him.  He listens to all the musical sounds in nature, which he believes will help him find his parents. His parents did not know he even existed, but they always sensed a feeling in the air that he does. He follows the music until he reaches New York. He learns how to play music there until he develops into becoming a genius musician. He joins one of the best music school there. After a short while he becomes a professional music compser. One night he composes music infront of thousands of people, turns his back and finds his parents looking at him with pride and love, and they finally get back together with him after long 11 years.     This movie is magnificent. The story is very original, the casting is great, and its very emotional and touchy as well.      A movie about the very precious relationship betwen parents and their children, particularly between a mother and her child.   We take our parents for granted, however there are many people who would wish to spend 1 day with their parents, when they can't.     Love your parents. Give them the care and love they deserve. You will not know how much they love you until you yourself become a parent.     Wonderful film!
0345444051|5.0|In Clarke's Childhood's End, aliens have finally come to Earth.  Hovering in massive starships above the Earth's major cities, the Overlords, as they come to be known, are vastly superior both physiologically and technologically.  The Overlords assert a benign control over humanity...banning only the most dangerous of technologies (i.e. atom bombs), they assure that everyone on Earth, for the first time in history, is free to live the life they wish to live without fear of starvation or worry about their safety.    But why have the Overlords come to Earth?  What's the Overlord's stake in humanity?  To be humanity's masters, ruling benignly from their perches on high?  Or do they have something else in mind?    Published in 1953, Childhood's End is not only masterful storytelling, but also decades ahead of its time on countless facets; it truly felt at some points that Clarke was reflecting today's early 21st century society instead of the mid-20th one he was writing in.  This tale is highly recommended.
0385338724|4.0|[[ASIN:0385338732 Remember Me?]]  I thoroughly enjoyed this book! It is a very interesting view on the possible challenges a person with severe amnesia might experience.  The characters and the story line kept me glued to my book, anxious to find out what was going to happen next!
B000002LEE|4.0|We will never forget beneficial bridge builders back in the late 80's, which led away from the rooster and into the rock, as this only slightly worn, extremely useful Farrell/Navarro alliance still proves.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|My husband and I watch The Lives of Others and liked it so much, I bought it on Amazon.  Even this morning, I found myself thinking about it.  There are times when parts of the movie replays, unbidden, in my mind.  The movie played on my belief in basic human goodness and in the never-ending capacity of each of us to grow, even in the bleaker times.  Even when fear, hatred, horror, arrogance, boredom, and sheer pettiness just seeps through out.  This is a keeper.
B00000J6AG|3.0|3 1/2    Rightly praised for further dancehall soul-sampled innovations, Play does in fact suffer from a classic case of second side syndrome. In defense of the lauded vegan, the first half plays at a consistency of astonishing proportion, making the latter half almost feel like b-sides in the arc of it.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|A few weeks ago the book \\"Persuader\\" by Lee Child was available free for the Kindle so I downloaded it. While reading the description I realized it is number 7 in a series so I downloaded a sample of \\"Killing Floor\\" to read because if I liked the series I wanted to start at the beginning. Not only did I like it, I loved it! Lots of great action, interesting plot. I guess now I'll continue on to see if I hang in all the way to \\"Persuader\\" and beyond.
0385333846|3.0|In Kurt Vonnegut's sixth novel, Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut finally explains his full story of Dresden.  The story follows the life of Billy Pilgrim, a young man drafted into the army during World War II. The bellicose theme of Slaughterhouse-Five is an unmitigated chronicle of Billy that, while thrilling throughout, falters at the conclusion. Vonnegut's reversion into time-travel depicts the author's inability to end the story realistically. This diffidence formulates an incredibly weak conclusion, which paints an unfortunate shade on the portrait of Slaughterhouse-Five.    Slaughterhouse-Five follows Billy Pilgrim throughout World War II, from the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium to his capture. Upon receiving a pernicious shot of Morphine, Billy begins a time-trip. This atypical transcendence of time is crucial throughout the novel, as Pilgrim falls into it frequently. Pilgrim is transported to Dresden, where he works in a slaughterhouse. Allied powers bomb the city, while Billy survives in an airtight meat locker, and returns to Dresden as a decimated shadow of its former self.  Soon after the bombing of Dresden, Billy is able to return to the United States, and resumes his normal life. After his return to New York, Billy is engaged to the corpulent daughter of his optometry school's founder, Valencia Merble. Subsequently, Billy suffers a mental breakdown and is committed to a mental hospital.  Upon his release from the hospital, Billy falls into his own discursive version of the \\"American Dream.\\" Slowly, Billy is subjected to ethereal repressed memories, such as a barbershop that psychologically sends him back to Dresden. After Billy's daughter's wedding, he is kidnapped by the Tralfamadorians, who explain to Billy that life cannot be viewed existentially. The Tralfamadorians prefer not to live lugubriously, but to relish the enjoyable moments of life. This alien race can see all of life's moments, from birth to death, yet they view death as trivial. Their jocundity affects Billy, despite his ability to see his own death. Upon his return to reality, Billy survives a plane crash. After numerous operations and recovery, Billy goes on a radio talk show, loquaciously spilling the details of his capture by the Tralfamadorians. Billy's daughter, ruminates over the methods of coping with his insanity, but ultimately institutionalizes him. As the book ends, Billy records a tape in which he discusses the imminent bombing of Chicago, as well as how he will experience his own death. This morose tone ends the story, but leaves the reader in the end confused.    Conceptually, Slaughterhouse-Five is intriguing. Billy's repression of his memories that are triggered by the slightest connection to Dresden promotes Vonnegut's belief in the unrelenting power of the mind. This theme if not nebulously explored, could have played a more influential role in the story. However, Vonnegut's foray into the extra-terrestrial seems childish and tacky. The author's ebullient transition into science-fiction from historical fiction seems slightly bipolar. The author seems to begin the story as Kurt Vonnegut, renowned writer, but ends the story as Kurt Vonnegut, comic-collecting fourteen year old boy. Despite the sardonic nature of this review, Slaughterhouse-Five is absorbing in theory, though the fatuous ending ultimately impairs the book in its entirety.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|I had to watch this movie twice to figure out if I liked it.      The three main characters:      Meryl Streep is wonderful in it as she is a wonderful actress. At first, you would be expected to dislike her character as a hard-boiled, stringent nun, and principal, with no desire for laughter and fun, music, ball point pens, sugar or candy, or deviation from her rigid, age-old beliefs.     But then you begin to doubt if she is as mean as she appears to be. Is she simply someone who demands lifeless rigidity in her routine, stricking horror in the Catholic students, or is she relentless in her need to protect the children and demand the truth?    Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman)leaves you doubting, as well. Is he a progressive, caring priest to his students, especially the downtrodden, or is he really a sexual predator? You could come to either conclusion.    Sister James (Amy Adams)is another one who has two sides...she is sweet and gentle, yet she is aware enough to suspect possible wrongdoing in Father Flynn. She wavers from suspicion to understanding.
0451450523|5.0|My 8-year old daughter loves unicorns for some reason and I had read this book many many years ago. When I saw that they had this anniversary edition, I bought it to allow her to read it. She read this for her book report although this is more of a 5th to 7th grade book. It helped that there was a video adaptation of the book that was very close to the book's story. Again, a wonderful book!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD is everything it promises to be; there is no sugar coating and no silver lining. I was a competitive gymnast for 17 years, including 4 years as a collegiate gymnast. Every since I graduated in 2007 I have been trying to find an effective DVD workout. I work full time and am working on my Master's, and this DVD still manages to fit right into my schedule. It is an intense, interval geared workout that is surely to promise results if you apply yourself. The format reminds me a lot of the conditioning I was faced with as a gymnast. The exercises are not acrobatic, but the interval format is just the same.....and I am here to tell you that the intervals in this DVD work, just as they did when I was a gymnast. My arms, legs, and abs have definitely toned back up! I will incorporate this DVD into my workouts far past the 30 day mark.     *Side note*: Although the DVD is labeled \\"30\\" day shred, I would urge those that are not already avid exercises not to get discouraged. Level 1 is a sweat, level 2 is challenging, and level 3 is just downright difficult, but you don't have to reach level 3 by day 20. Go at your pace....even if that means sticking with level 1 for 30 days before moving on to level 2. Move when you are comfortable. As long as you are working out at some level (several days a week) and staying in motion the whole DVD through you will see results.     All in all BEST workout DVD I own and best results I have seen out of all the DVD programs I have tried.
B000007NYS|5.0|It's a shame that this is no longer in production.  It's a great album.  The songs are a bit pop-y but it's amazing how many really excellent tracks are on it.  Williams' voice is unconventional but lovely.
B001EYGOEM|3.0|On my local country station, there must still be a \\"payola\\" scheme in place.  There isn't an hour that passes that Taylor isn't singing something.

1847879071|4.0|I find this boook to be extremely helpful. It explains the psychology statistics in a very easy to understand conversational manner. Each SPSS test is described in thourough detail with full color examples and each output box is thouroughly explained. The only thing that prevented me from giving this a perfect 5 is that the ink seems to have never completley dried. Since I handle this book a lot I am finding that the text can smudge very easily.I have to treat it with extra care or the words could easily become incomprehensible. Overall 4 and 1/2 stars.

0156034026|4.0|I was actually assigned this novel in my modern Middle Eastern history course, apparently as a fictional reflection of Muslim-Western relations in the aftermath of 9/11. The novel is in the form of a first person narrative, the protagonist being a Pakistani man named Changez. As they sit in a cafe in Lahore, Changez recounts his experiences of living in America to an unknown American. Those experiences consist chiefly of attending Princeton, attaining a position at an elite American firm, and falling in love with a beautiful yet troubled American girl. Changez was living the American dream, or so he thought, until 9/11, the day when everything changed. The attacks caused not only societal tension between Islam and the West, but a deep identity crisis within Changez himself.<br /><br />On a superficial level, it might seem that this is an anti-American book. Changez obviously becomes embittered with America, and tends to romanticize his native Pakistan in comparison. But I think the author is portraying a more nuanced message, and Changez simply gives voice to the \\"other side\\" that many in the West fail to understand. In fact, the book seems to point to a deep misunderstanding between the Islamic world and the West, one in which both sides have become victims of fear and suspicion, thus feeding the cycle of animosity. I would normally refrain from my next comment (for fear of giving too much away), but the author himself says in the Amazon review that this is a story about nostalgia, and the damaging effect it can have when embraced too tightly.<br /><br />The writing is eloquent and compelling, and I would definitely classify this as a page turner. I can't quite bring myself to call it a home run, but it is quite an intriguing read that provoked some serious thought. That being said, I did feel it was a bit vague and confusing upon reading it, and only with reading the author's interview did I feel I fully comprehended what it was trying to say. For whatever that is worth.
0553381687|4.0|I have seen numerous reviews compare GRRM to JRRT and I just dont see it. Tolkien created a universe, GRRM has recreated world history with some cool, deadly, bloody, lustful, magical, page turning twists.<br /><br />Let me continue by saying I love these novels. Yes, I am a HP fan, yes I am enjoying the Eragon series. Tolkien is and will continue to be my number one author, but if you need to lose yourself in a world here is the next best thing.<br /><br />I love that he uses character POV. I am now midway through the 3rd book and while I am glad I didnt start this until the last of the novels were out, I am deeply captured by this story(ies). I find myself very tempted to flip ahead so that I can follow one story line. I find myself falling in love with a character only to have GRRM smash my mental bond when he kills them off. You almost become like one of the characters feeling that he cant put you through anymore ups and downs...until you get to the next chapter.<br /><br />This is not a LOTR type book. It is exactly what the first review said, a twist of the war of the roses and 100 years war. There is magic, yes, but not childish. If my son asked to read these I would definitely want him to be 16+ since there is some graphic death, torture and sex scenes. In my opinion, it is not in a distasteful manner, just very adult. Read up on fuedal times and GRRM has re-created a very dark era in world history.<br /><br />Cons - I love the series, but I am realistic also. He does stretch some story lines. Not to the point of wanting to stop reading, just enough that you get the urge to want to get to a chapter on your favorite character (s). LET A GOOD PERSON WIN FOR ONCE!!! Like I said earlier, you are put on an emotional rollercoster that GRRM has broken the stop button of. There is happy points in the book, but once you feel the thorn of betrayel, turning the pages becomes almost worrysome.<br /><br />I hope that I have helped you in choosing to read this book and series. I highly reccomend it. (4 stars vs 5? easy, only one author gets 5... JRRT)rs vs 5? easy, only one author gets 5... JRRT)
B000W1T26A|2.0|A lot of people like this album, and critics are always saying how this is the greatest indie album of all time. I could see for the late 80's how this could be groundbreaking, but this 2009. And there alot of people who do similiar things to this band. That being said, I do like Sonic Youth's Cover of the Carpenters Album, being a carpenters fan, myself.As for this one, I just found it to be too quiet, too dull, and not very original. I will say on the bright side that the cover artwork is way ahead of its time. And so was the band, which i have to give credit to them. I thought Daydream Nation and Teenage Riot were ok. Overall, if your into rock music then def. buy this album.
B001Q8MMGU|5.0|This movie has always been a favorite of mine.  Bud Cort is genius ... his mock suicide attempts, his breaking down in tears with Maude, his genuine love for her, his reaction to her death.      LOVED THIS MOVIE!!
B0013DC4Y8|5.0|Contrary to what has been written in other reviews the first song doesn't curse it uses the work \\"buck\\" to replace a curse word.  The songs are even better with the funny replacements.  I'm glad I got this album.
B00008976Y|3.0|I bought this movie as my girlfriend whom I start to love so much has experienced a very similar tragedy. As we both started watching and only me knowing the plot, it was quite emotional. As the movie progressed it was hard to understand the emotions and the actual meaning of often very deep hidden messages. We found ourselves a bit bored during the 2nd half of the movie as we couln't understand the subtle signs and clues given in the movie. Athough the use of cinematographical effects/angles and sounds is no doubt excellent, I only got the full understanding of this and the plot after watching it a 2nd time with the narration voice. This made the movie much more meaningfull.  I believe the movie could have been better if not so much of the original screenplay was omited and more time was spend on dialogue of the characters, this would make the movie 2 or 2.5 hours long.  Right now, I've fully enjoyed the movie after watching the 2 seperate audio tracks and will watch a 3rd time with the original.  Still believe it was an great movie! Just doesn't get a 5 star rating cause I think sense and emotion must be captured in a single viewing for it to be an excellent movie.
0812550757|3.0|I read Card's Ender's Game and was amazed and excited about the Universe Card had created and the many future story possibilities (and the number of additional books already published on the Ender and Bean characters).     Speaker for the Dead occurs 3000 years in the future from Ender's Game. Ender is not only still alive, but since he's been star hopping and due to the relativistic effects of near light-speed travel, he has only aged about 15 years. He is now an official \\"Speaker for the Dead\\", a sort of official researcher/death recorder held in almost mystical esteem by the Human race, and of which there are very few. Nobody knows that he is the original Speaker who wrote \\"The Hemegon and the Hive Queen.\\"    The story centers around a religious (Portuguese Catholic) colony on one of the \\"100 planets\\" colonized by humans. The colonists call the planet Lusitania. The human race has sadly up to this point not found any additional advanced life forms, and therefore greatly regrets their destruction of the 'Buggers' in their war 3000 years ago, to the point of demonizing \\"The Xenocide\\" Ender.  They also don't realize that he or his sister are still alive, as timelines, facts and myths have somewhat blurred in perception over the thousands of years.     All this changes when the colony discovers a primitive though highly intelligent form of beings who resemble small earth pigs, which they call \\"the piggies.\\" Official earth policy is to strictly minimize contact with these beings so not to contaminate them ( .. which to me sounds a lot like the Star Trek \\"Prime Directive\\"). Only a few humans are allowed to communicate with the piggies, and the pigs quickly learn to speak both Portuguese and Stark (a dialect of English).     Ender eventually comes into play on Lusitania when he arrives to research and speak on a death of one of the colonists.  Things get complicated, and Card creates multiple mysteries and sub plots that keep you guessing until the very end.     So whyonly 3 stars out of 5?  Card's writing style. Though Ender's Game had this problem in a few spots also, so much of 'Speaker for the Dead' is over-described and emotion almost roboticly added that you start to ask yourself \\"Why is this stuff in here?\\"  The story painfully over-indulges on the religious customs of Lusitania's Catholic leaders.. I almost get the feeling that Card is both simultaneously fascinated and contemptuous of Catholic religious ritual. To each their own you could say, but it's you who has to read it, and read it, and read it.. I got to the point where I was just reading the first and last sentence of each paragraph and moving on. I'm guessing 20% of this book - easily - could have been edited out.  That would have made it about the same size as Ender's Game.     Another odd thing that Card does - though quite understandably - is to completely avoid describing technical advances made in this era. There's very little description of advanced vehicles, dwellings and medicine. I guess he figured that's a game you can't win.    So was it any good?  It did keep me reading.  And I also went out and bought the next two books in the series.  I just hope Card could bear chopping out the fluff on these two.
1595141715|4.0|Thirteen Reasons Why really makes you think about how we treat one other. Asher's emotional writing makes you feel the pain Hannah is experiencing and the fear Clay has about finding out why he is on Hannah's list to begin with. This book has a strong message about suicide, and about how easily forgotten minor details of one person's life, can become the catalyst for unfortunate events in the lives of others. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes reading books regarding social issues, or who enjoys \\"heavier\\" reading. All in all, Thirteen Reasons Why is a great read.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|Who hasn't ever wished they were one of the characters in their favorite book!!!  I thought the movie was great, lots of twists and turns.  I definitely recommend this for any Austen fan.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Even if you're not a writer, but love to read, you should read this book. It is a compelling look into the mind of one of America's premier authors. Not only is it full of amusing and interesting autobiographical information, but it also contains excellent advice on the creative process. Beyond that, there is some practical advice on living life in general written from the perspective of someone who lost much of his to drugs and alcohol and almost lost all of it to a terrible accident.

031606792X|3.0|Breaking Dawn just killed the Twilight Series for me. I was all about Edward and Bella in Twilight. I was all about Jacob and Bella in New Moon. I was all about the triangle of love in Eclipse. Team Jacob...go. But, Breaking Dawn brought ALL those characters down for me. The moment I had in inkling that Bella was pregnant, I started to lose interest. So predictable and ridiculous and unnecessary. Their love story had really just begun and suddenly, it's all about a vampire baby and turning Bella into stone. And, then Jacob 'imprints' on the new 'baby' Renesmee. What the heck kinda name is THAT and why her? It's just ridiculous all 'round.      Ms. Meyer had a good thing going there with the love between Edward and Bella, Jacob and Bella and the conflict between the pack and the coven. What was she thinking? Don't know. I'll have to finish the dang book now, but, it's ruined for me. Jacob's love for Bella had me all warmed up and now, I'm left cold.
0375703764|5.0|When the name House of Leaves first reached my ears, I was just beginning the transition from junior high to high school. A family friend had suggested this book to me, saying it was one of the greatest books he had read.  When I asked my friend what the book was about, he answered with this simple summary:  it's about a house that's bigger on the inside than the outside; however, my friend was quite wrong. It's really about much more than that.      The plot of this book is far too complicated to explain, but I can give you a little idea of it.  This book is about a man named Johnny Truant who finds a stack of papers badly bound together in the home of an old blind man named Zampanó.  Truant soon finds that the book is a description of a home-made documentary called The Navidson Record. The Navidson Record is about a man named Will Navidson who moves into a house that is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.  As Navidson explores his house more and more, he is overcome with its mystery and is tossed into the darkness and immensity of its hallways.  But that is only a minor description; to really understand this book you have to read it for yourself.       Not only was this book amazingly well-written, but the visual power that the book held-- with its stricken out passages, blank pages, and the good, old-fashioned, upside-down and backwards text--made it all the better. Danielewski's characters are well-developed and very real. Each of the characters has a fascinating back-story, and they all seem like actual people, leaving the reader wondering if it's all more than a story.      Even though I fell completely in love with this story, there were those occasional times when I seriously thought about putting it down.  Many times in House of Leaves the reader will have to endure mind-numbing rants about a character's past or a rant on Norse mythology.  However, if you can pull yourself through these dull spots, you will be greeted by a great story with a spectacular finish.        I did love this book, but I don't think I had the reading skills needed to fully comprehend it. I recommend this book to you only if you are an avid reader with a lot of patience and a lot of time.  This book will take a while to read and has incredibly hard language. When I first opened this book, I was not nearly ready for what it held, so for now, House of Leaves will go back on my shelf waiting until I am truly ready to read it.
0316066524|5.0|If they don't tickle your fanny, Reader shove on. Maybe not the ideal read for the average bear, but if you care passionately about what words can do, ya gotta spend some time here. The first hundred pages went by in a breeze; scene by scene DFW outdoes every rival. In recent memory, only Beloved and the startling descriptive passages in DeLillo's Underworld hold a candle.<br /><br />This guy is good. In fact, he's amazing. For an extra treat, read the opening of his essay on John McCain's 1st Presidential campaign. I learned more about McCain in eight pages than from all the news blather over a decade. I don't know about you but I'm going to get all of Wallace's books.

B0000019P9|5.0|A few people told me to give this bit a chance quite a while ago. I have been trying to get into more new music for a while, so I picked this up (too bad this album is like over ten years old now, but anyway...thats kind of new to me...)<br /><br />I can see why it was recommended for me, easily... and I enjoyed it. See, I had a real bad cough for the last two weeks...maybe it was Swine Flu, I dunno for sure, it's better now though, thanks to plenty of rest, and Maximum Strength Robitussin. The robitussin gave me the urge to go pick up this album (on vinyl thank you- knew right out that I NEEDED it on vinyl or I wouldn't have paid for it on a whim like I did) and soak it up. I feel like I found something secretly on the acid tinged folk circuit. I'm not sure where these guys came out of, but this album has a definate folk rock feel to it, mixed with Syd Barret style delirium and bent vocals. It's a cool disc, and I like the fact that it doesn't try to hard to be different, it just is. Lovely and warm, in a psychotic tone of way.<br /><br />Look at any of the song titles here and you'll get some idea whats up. It can be taken as a whole if you like any of it at all. Thinking about it is giving me a weird cough syrupy like flashback right now, but I'm digging it kids. I'm digging it. I liked it right off on the first spin.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|After years of playing the Godfather Trilogy finally recieved a make over. going frame by frame retooling it. Taking the scratches out and revamping the color. They did a great job with it. The Godfather is my favorite movie and when watching in blu was the icing on the cake. This is a great film the restoration was excellent. This trilogy needs to be in any movie collection.
B001H1OUWU|5.0|Probanly so many miles's funs may have been waiting for this \\"bitches brew\\".  There are three stickers written 180 gram,DOUBLE album and LEGACY VINYL on seald of this record. And I find that the color of cover art is a little light. So Bitches Brew's blue sky looks like a cloudy sky and Bitches Brew's blue sea looks like lead-grey sea. But I think that this pale color is just like the color of photograph getting pale. The cover art of \\"Bitches Brew\\" has got pale for 40 years. Or \\"Bitches Brew\\" has grown old for 40 years. It is interesting for me that I can think so. Anyway this re-newal jacket is good! In fact if you can watch this cover art of \\"Bitches Brew\\" carefully, you can find that the thought of black beauty girl rises to the sky and it becomes thunder in the cloud and its lightning drops the sea and its waves beat upon a black beauty couple locking in each others arms. What is this girl brewing? This beautiful and interesting cover art was painted by Mati klarwein.   When you take out lp record, you can feel comfotable heft of it and you can see the letters of COLUMBIA and one eye along scarlet circle of the center of record is gold. Phahaps you will be able to think this record jacket and record is beautiful. And when you put this record on phonograph,you can listen and recoginize how the great sounds changed music times in the world is and what bitches brew!   Well,what did bitches brew?
B0016MOWP0|1.0|The dvd did not ever work after 2 returns and a replacement.  What was even more ironic, I was charged for the shipping.  I will never purchase another dvd and/or cd from you, unless, maybe it is something I just cannot locate in my local area.

Will be buying this the second it comes out!!
B0000024K1|5.0|This is one of the TWO most influential hip-hop recordings EVER. It's difficult if you weren't around when this record was new to understand the impact that this record had on the landscape of hip-hop and music in general (I was in 10th grade at the time). The same could be said about the other influential record which was NWA's Straight Outta Compton but that's another review. Public Enemy was ushering in a new era in rap; the post Run DMC era, the New School era. The era with EPMD, BDP, The Jungle Brothers, Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, De La Soul, Stetsasonic, and the list goes on and on. There were many groups to choose from and they all sounded completely different.    Musically the sample arrangements created by the legendary Bomb-Squad were unique and multi layered. The various noises and sounds put together to make funky beats was a concept not quite heard before. Rebel Without a Pause with it's funky drummer loop and horn sample repeating 96 times brought a rawness to beat making that was infectious and forced you to listen. The imagery of the conscientious objector on Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos puts you right in the middle of a prison break. Chuck D while, not necessarily a Rakim, forcefully made you see his point of view whether you agreed with it or not. Flavor Flav was just fun pure and simple. Just listen to Cold Lampin' With Flavor for the comic relief with no message. Don't Believe the Hype was about media manipulation, Night of the Living Baseheads about the burgeoning crack epidemic. Caught, Can I Get a Witness? about sampling... this record had everything. I played it for over a year straight.    This was a record that came at the right time and can never be repeated, no matter how hard you try to recreate the context.  It Takes a Nation of Millions... will stand the test of time as THE greatest hip-hop album of all time. Public Enemy themselves, while able to put together many more classic songs, were never able to recapture the phenomenon that was this album. This was the crown jewel of \\"The Golden Era\\". You must own this on some tangible format i.e. vinyl, cassette, or CD to possess a piece of music history.
0060723513|5.0|Get ready for an adventure that will take you on a spiritual voyage. As the author of a series of spiritually-themed novels, [...], I am always on the outlook for books that will feed my spirit. This one should do it for you regardless of your religious beliefs.    It is a wonderful story about an American woman who goes on a walkabout with a tribe of Aborigines in Australia. They are called \\"real people.\\" That they are in every sense of the word. Unlike many of us in \\"civilized cultures,\\" they know who they truly are. They have no facades and they cling to no labels. They are in communion with both the natural wonder of this world as well as the world within.    It is a compelling book that will literally transport the reader into this unspoiled land. You will feel as if you are making the journey yourself. It will give you a refreshing perspective on what life can truly mean instead of the petty worries in which so many of us can get caught up. I felt as if I was a changed person after I read this book.     Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\"
B000003B6J|4.0|Sure there were already rappers out talking about gangster topics. Ice-T, Schooly D, even BDP but this record... this record was believable. These guys took it to the next level. Now, as a 16 year old hearing this for the first time in a not-so-different different city than Compton (Richmond, California) the things I was hearing from Ice Cube, MC Ren, Eazy E, and Dr. Dre were not only shockingly familiar, but shockingly stark and real... again to a 16 year old. The first three songs on Straight Outta Compton makes for the most powerful introduction to a group ever in hip-hop. This was NOT gangster rap back then. It was just gangsters rapping. Straight up hip-hop. The production by Dr. Dre and Yella was innovative with it's Rufus Thomas samples and the heavy bass kicks. The only song that sucked was Something 2 Dance 2 and that's only because after hearing Eazy E talking about \\"playing with the trigger of an uzi or an AK\\" it's hard to imagine his feet hurting from dancing so much at the club. Yeah right!    This record gave a swagger to rap that may not have been so wide spread before. Swearing on records became the norm. Tales of reckless gunplay and misogyny were quickly becoming more popular after this. This record was genius. What came afterwards was a tidal wave of copy cats and me toos. There were a few others that could continue in this vein with the skill that NWA did (Compton's Most   Wanted, Spice 1, Kool G. Rap, The Ghetto Boys) but soon the sex and violence became too gratuitous. Even NWA itself couldn't continue to be groundbreaking with such limited subject matter.     While this record was influential and groundbreaking, I would hardly call it revolutionary. NWA called attention to inner city issues that plagued urban America and it forced society to take a good look at itself. This was not the intention of the group however... self admittedly. They were out to get attention and it worked. So much so that they received letter from the FBI about their lyrics on F--- tha Police.    NWA was able to sell millions of records based on shock value and yes, lyrical skill and good production but unfortunately when your subject matter consists of guns and hoes, you run out of things to say really fast. Their follow-ups 100 Miles and Runnin' and Niggaz4life sold well but never had the impact of Straight Outta Compton. Dr. Dre Changed the game again four years later building on the blueprint of Straight Outta Compton with The Chronic. We all know what happened after that...

0385333846|5.0|How are you supposed to make sense out of a slaughter? Orderly, organized, logical books should not arise from the ashes of mass murder, which is inherently inexplicable, illogical, and horrid. Kurt Vonnegut's astounding novel, Slaughterhouse Five, recognizes the implicit absurdity of war, and responds with the absurdist tale of Billy Pilgrim's life. The central focus of Vonnegut's book is more or less the devastation of the German city of Dresden during World War II, from a bombing raid that killed between 24,000 to 40,000 civilians and destroyed 13 square miles of the city, but Vonnegut's novel goes far beyond one single act of banal human cruelty, focusing on various perceptions of time, human nature, and war.     According to Vonnegut, his novel, which follows Billy Pilgrim through his random shuffling in time, \\"is so short and jumbled and jangled... because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre.\\" This view is mirrored by Dresden-survivor Lothar Metzger, who recalls the attacks as \\"not possible to describe! Explosion after explosion. It was beyond belief, worse than the blackest nightmare.\\" When Vonnegut writes about Billy and other Prisoners of War the day after the bombing raids, climbing \\"over curve after curve on the face of the moon,\\" discovering \\"corpse mines\\" where bodies \\"were cremated by soldiers with flamethrowers,\\" war is no longer an abstract, romantic concept. The chauvinistic Edgar Derby has been shot for stealing a teapot, and the war has become an incomprehensible saga of suffering and death, where invisible global forces and theoretical concepts like \\"war\\" engender unfathomable destruction.     After finishing Slaughterhouse Five, the reader feels at a loss, questioning what were once incontrovertible assumptions. The foundations of popular conceptions about time, truth, progress, and morality are fractured by Billy Pilgrim's odyssey, which reveals the absurd and repugnant, yet at times redemptive, characteristics of humannature. Characters like the pugnacious and choleric Paul Lazarro, and the vacuous and insipid Valencia provide subtle insight into the various characteristics of human nature, while Billy's experiences with the Tralfamadorians provide a new perspective about life on Earth.            Vonnegut's novel, with its rich symbolism, dark humor, and unique prose, provides a refreshing and welcome addition to modern literature. Slaughterhouse Five is a finely crafted story that combines moral statements with probing questions and tales of complete destruction with devastating humor to create a novel that can powerfully affect readers of all backgrounds.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|Two thumbs up for Andrew Davies \\"Little Dorrit\\".  Excellent story line, great plot, and a superb cast.   In my opinion, this is the best Dickens movie made to date.    I can not think of any other actors who could have filled any of the rolls better.   Claire Foy is the perfect Amy Dorrit. I thought Matthew Macfadyen did an outstanding performance as the kind hearted Arthur Clennam. And of course all of the others, Tom Courtenay as Mr. Dorrit the \\"Father of the Marshalsea\\" debtors prison, Judy Parfitt as the cold hearted Mrs. Clennam, Alun Armstrong as Jeremiah Flintwinch, Eddie Marsan as the unforgettable Mr. Panks, and of course Russell Tovey as the broken hearted John Chivery, Andy Serkis as the perfect villain Rigaud, and many more.     This film will keep you on the edge of your seat as the long kept, dark secret, begins to unfold.     There are a few extra scenes in the DVD that help give a little more detail, which were not online or on television.    I highly recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Dickens.

B001QWBM62|5.0|The product literature for the H4n is not hype: it truly combines the capabilities of a high quality field recorder, a four-track portable studio, and a PC audio interface, all in a package that's more portable and less expensive than most single-purpose devices.    It is not completely without its flaws, however. While the sound quality is crisp and full, the noise floor is higher than I'd hoped. And the interface is extraordinarily awkward; for example, simply deleting a bad take involves drilling down through multiple menus. Finally, the manual is nearly incomprehensible. It's clear that no one involved spoke a word of English.    But these flaws seem minor in light of the fact that there is simply nothing else on the market that even comes close to what you can do with the H4n.
0060890096|1.0|Two of the CD's had some type of glue residue on them from the CD jacket. When I tried to clean one of them, the CD was damaged and rendered unusable. So, I am now missing one CD in the set - about a 4 chapter gap. Not happy about it.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|Just had to say more than a passing resemblance to JD Souther, both physically and auraly (sp?)  A lovely album and a confusing one.  I've occasionaly put it in my six stacker CD player when on the road then been perplexed as tracks come up and they are simply not what was expected, a mix of jazz, blues, alt country et al.  But truly a beautiful album and a MAJOR talent.  This album is a massive step up from the debut and I know it will feature heavily in my car over time.
B001DVBZ4K|5.0|most kids (ages 3-9) give this movie a two thumbs up!  the adult concensus notwithstanding, this set makes an excellent gift and is a great deal too.  I bought this as a gift to a seven year old.  His two year old sister absconded with the plush toy; the four year sister made off with the storybook cd; and the 9 year old brother copied the digital file to his ipod!  if the kids you are shopping for loved it at the movies, you can't miss.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|An amazing screenplay, insightfully directed and overflowing with performances unrivaled in such a long miniseries.  There is no character so minor that you do not light up when they are on screen.  The screenplay is not overwritten allowing for so much to be communicated with looks and emotion.  The lighting is wonderfully sculpted (sometimes subtle and sometimes dramatic but always complimentary to the emotion) and the art design is rich and engaging.  BUT it's the performances that keep me coming back to the world of Little Dorrit.  If young John Chivery (played brilliantly by Russell Tovey) cannot bring you to tears, you have no heart.    If you loved it on Masterpiece but wished for more, the DVD is for you.  There are many extended scenes and small scenes that were cut in the PBS broadcast that help to further enrich the story.  One, like myself, longs for long and detailed \\"making of\\" extras for such a production as this but it is not to be found on the DVD.  However, there is a decent \\"making of\\" featurette that I was happy to devour.  Noticeably absent, however, were any interviews with Eddie Marsan (who played Pancks).  I would have loved to hear him talk about his character.  The Photo gallery was a complete waste    If you loved Little Dorrit on PBS you cannot live without the DVD.  An amazing production of a timely and deeply moving story!
B001N26GFM|4.0|My grandson read the book in school. He told me there was a movie coming out and he wanted to see it. It was not shown in a lot of theaters so I purchased it when it came out on dvd. This is one of the most emotional movies I have seen. The little boy was so curious, he did not understand that his little friend was in a concentration camp.He went everyday to the fence to play with the little boy bringing him food and not fully understanding what was going on. I think everyone should see this movie just to see how bad it was for the Jews. What happened there is unthinkable.

0553807048|5.0|An absolute joyride. Belfort's explicit, self-deprecating  and highly colorful account of his meteoric rise and astonishingly self indulgent lifestyle grabbed me in The Wolf of Wall Street. Now in \\"Catching the Wolf\\", he describes his plummet from Master of the Universe to being a nearly dead broke criminal defendant with a failed marriage, now wholly dependant on his keepers at the U.S. Attorney's office.       Belfort's discussions with his captors actually provide more details and insights than did his first book, as he describes his drive for success and his propensity for scheming; from selling Italian ice on Jones' Beach, to selling frozen meat and seafood door to door in affluent Long island communities to peddling low priced stocks.       In some ways, his book is a primer on salesmanship because he stresses bullet points that he employed and which he drummed into the   heads of the \\"Strattonites\\"  who unloaded the many IPO's that were the   claim to fame of Stratton-Oakmont. For example, his scripts were factual and substantially truthful. More importantly, he recommended investments   to people with money. For the same effort, you write a bigger order and encounter less resistance. Obviously, his misdeeds involved his aftermarket machinations which caused the prices of house stocks to skyrocket, as well as his own use of nominees which enabled him to stockpile cash in the names of others in order to circumvent securities laws.       The most absorbing passages contained his account of his dealings with the FBI and the prosecutors and ultimately, his exposure to incarceration. Belfort describes these developments with humor, humility and with an abiding wonder at his own seeming compulsion to dig holes for himself. He has very likable human qualities which cause the reader   to feel his torment as assets are stripped away from him, despite the fact that he brought all this on himself and cost a lot of people a lot of money. The book is very anecdotal and the secret of its success is   probably Belfort's style, which suggests a one on one conversation with the reader.       The details of his drug addiction, sex life and the characters who inhabited his world are funny and cleverly woven into the fabric of his   \\"memoir\\". Many of the incidents he describes are flat out hilarious. The book is a terrific read, but I think that the reader's enjoyment is heightened by reading \\"The Wolf of Wall Street\\" first, although this is not necessary.
0446677450|1.0|Yes, I was talked into buying this book a while ago into thinking that it provided all the answers that I needed to become like the author.  Well, after reading this book, I did a little researched to see what the author preached in his book was actually the same advice that he took in his financial life.  To my surprise, the author made more money selling books, training conferences, talk shows than his financial portfolio.  If you don't believe me then try to find him on Google and you will uncover the truth about this author.

It really is a song that touched my heart.  Keep em comin' John.
0061684384|4.0|This is an very good book.  Was way more than I expected it to be.  Acutally got it as a gift for hubby and he loves it.  We both thought the outside of the book was cool and how its made to look old was nice to.
B001UREJWM|3.0|Hello:    I rated this album \\"generously\\" at three stars. The album has a few songs that are fair to very good. But this album as a whole pales in comparison with most of their previous work. I am not pleased with most of this album. A considerable amount of this album lacks anything interesting, stimulating or pleasing in a mature manner.     Part of the album sounds as if it was done in a robotic manner. Very dull  and boring at times. The subject matter in some of these songs are not written in a mature manner. They are for a certain type of adolescent listener/audience. Some of these songs sound like movie sound tracks.       You can write songs about God and the Devil, good and evil, Love and Hate, nature, violence, war, science, politics, sex, drugs, alcohol, disease, money, rich and poor, crime and prison, right and wrong, sorrow, failure, success and happiness, etc, etc without the songs comming off as imature and of an adolescent nature.     Some examples of songs written and played in a rational and mature, tasteful manner, NIB, Black Sabbath, After Forever, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, War Pigs, Killing Yourself To Live, Looking for today, Sabbra Cadabra, You won't change me, Changes, Warning, Hand of Doom, Snowblind, Sweet leaf, Wicked World, Heaven and Hell, Lonely is the Word, Over and Over, Falling off the edge of the world, Walk Away, Lady Evil, Too late, etc,etc,etc.       They need to get back to their roots, and Geezer needs to have more input with the writing.       As for going by the name Heaven and Hell, they should go by the name Black Sabbath. This makes more sense, as an enormous amount of people are very familiar with the band Black Sabbath. Going by the name Black Sabbath therefore is much better for marketing, $$$$$$$$$$$$.    A considerable amount of the shows during this current tour of 2009 were not sold out. The setlist have been short, and not that creative nor have they been that experimental with certain songs.     I do understand themembers explaination of why they had chosen to go under the banner of Heaven and Hell, but it makes more sense across the board to go by the name of Black Sabbath, marketing, more diverse and interesting, and exciting setlists, a much more pleasing show, and much more money in income for the members, etc,etc.    PS Maybe the current law suit in 2009 between Ozzy and Tony has something to with them choosen to go under the banner of Heaven and Hell. Ozzy in a recent statement had said he was trying to negotiate with Tony Iommi on and off for a few years now about having the rights to part ownership of the name Black Sabbath/franchise from Tony Iommi.    This seems to have been brewing for a few years now at the least.                Black Sabbath/Heaven and Hell have fans that range in age from children to people over 60 years old. A certain amount of these posts seem to come from people who are not rational. Logically, Black Sabbath is a Hard Rock band that listens to, writes and plays a variety of music. Black Sabbath is a major contributor in creating the Heavy Metal genre, but they are not a Heavy Metal band. To an extent the same goes for the band Heaven and Hell, which is made up of two of the original members of Black Sabbath, Tony and Geezer. The original members of the first Black Sabbath album with Ronnie James Dio, Heaven and Hell is, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Bill Ward, Ronnie James Dio and Geoff Nichols.     There is one particular review that states every song sounds the same and is a continuation from the first song. I disagree with that example,  but, I do understand what he means because in certain areas of this album it does seem that way.    I also disagree with certain aspects of what he stated about the album \\"Dehumanizer\\". For example, he mentions \\"I\\" and Computer God as maybe being exceptions from the Dehumanizer album as stand out songs. But what about songs such as, Too Late? Letters from Earth? those songs are very good to excellent songs and do stand out.     Anyway, back to TDYK, there are a few very good songs on this album, and the rest of the album, I rate from fair to good. But, yes, certain parts and aspects of this album are a disappointment and are boring and are based too much on fantasy. In a sense to an extent in some ways minus the Walmart Version of the album cover, the album cover is too Pro Evil and borders on going in an adolescent direction, that also goes for some of the songs as well.     Black Sabbath is in the same ball park as Led Zep, and Deep Purple, Great Hard Rock Bands, that write and play a variety of music including some heavy metal songs, the same goes for Heaven and Hell. I wish and hope they go back to that type of writing, playing and sound.    For you people that doubt or disagree, go review the first 8 Black Sabbath albums, many of those songs are not heavy metal songs. The same goes for Heaven and Hell and for the other line ups of Black Sabbath.    Anyway, although there are a few songs that do stand out over the rest on The Devil You Know. There are no huge stand out songs on The Devil You Know. There are no songs on TDYK that even come close to the huge, tastful, stand out songs with truly great riffs, songs such as just to name a few for example, Lonely is the Word, Over and Over, Too Late, Letters from Earth, Heaven and Hell, The Mob Rules, Warning, You Won't change me, Black Sabbath, War Pigs, Paranoid, The Wizard, NIB, She's Gone, Juinors Eyes, Heart like a Wheel, Memory, No Stranger to Love, Keep it Warm, Feels Good to Me, Rusty Angels, etc, etc. Some songs from the band Rainbow for example to just name a few, Mistreated, Stargazer, Man on the Silver Mountain, Long live Rock \\"N\\" Roll, etc, etc.    The band is called Heaven and Hell, but yet the album cover seems to be Pro Hell, what happen to the Pro Heaven aspect? What happened to the proper mix of good and evil on this album cover and in some of the songs? Too much fantasy in some of the songs, what a shame, what a waste. Ironically,these gentlmen have written much better music and are still capable of writing much better music than the music that is on TDYK.    No wonder why Bill Ward did not want any part of this Heaven and Hell project. Bill explains this to an extent in an interview. Yes, of course Bill Ward is a drummer/percussionist but he is also a reactionary drummer. His heart, mind and soul and taste in music are not into some of these songs and is not comfortable with part of the direction that the band Heaven and Hell are going in.      In some ways it sounds like a DIO solo project. It seems to have too much Dio input. Geezer Butler has come up with on an average much better lyrics than most people including Ronnie James Dio. I wish Geezer would have a lot more input with the lyrics. Yes, for the most part their style of writing is different, and RJD is an excellent writer but Geezer Butler has written a lot of great lyrics, famous, legendary great lyrics/songs.    Bible Black, Fear, Rock\\"N\\"Roll Angel are some of the better songs on the album. The production of the album is very good. As for Tony's guitar playing, Tony needs to get back to playing those huge, monster raw riffs that had contributed in the past to attracting many people to his guitar playing. Don't get me wrong, there is some very good guitar work on TDYK.     If you have not already, go to YOU TUBE and type in Black Sabbath covers, the Author and a excellent guitar player is Dr. Nerve. This man has been playing guitar for over 40 years and plays parts of some Black Sabbath songs, for the most part almost spot on. I never seen or heard anybody come that close to Tony's playing of those songs such as Dr. Nerve does. He also explains note by note how to play the parts he is playing.    How about adding to the line up, such as for example:    Tony Iommi Guitar/Flute/Piano  Geezer Butler Bass Guitar  Ronnie James Dio vocals/guitar  Bill Ward Drums/Percussion  Glenn Hughes vocals/guitar/bass  Vinnie Appice Drums  Geoff Nichols guitar/keyboards/piano  Scott Warren keyboards/piano    Imagine that line up, the songs, the show, interesting, exciting, enjoyable, stimulating, etc.    What setlist is Heaven and Hell going to have for 2009? I wonder! I hope it's very good at the least. At least add Over and Over, and put this song in the slot after the song Falling off the edge of the world, add Country Girl, Too late, Letters from Earth, TV Crimes, War Pigs, Black Sabbath, etc,etc.    Well, I can go on and on, but I have to run.    Take Care,     Bye.
B001N44BVQ|5.0|I missed \\"Body of Lies\\" in theaters, but finally watched it on dvd!<br /><br />Excellent! DiCaprio and Crowe were excellent together in this CIA thriller! The movie is set in Jordan, where DiCaprio is the man on the ground, hunting a radical cleric.<br /><br />Leo DiCaprio was on top of his game as undercover CIA agent Roger Ferris, his roles are always believable and in my opinion he's one of the best actors making movies right now. His last several movies have been outstanding: \\"Blood Diamond\\" (06), \\"The Departed\\" (06) and \\"Catch Me If You Can\\" (02).<br /><br />Russell Crowe plays Ed Hoffman, DiCaprio's (Ferris) CIA eyes and ears in Langley, Virginia. The role seemed a little out of place for Crowe, but he played it really well. Love him or hate him, Russell Crowe has only made blockbusters since 2000 - \\"American Gangster\\" (07), \\"3:10 to Yuma\\" (07), \\"Cinderella Man\\" (05), \\"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\\" (03), \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" (01) and \\"Gladiator\\" (00).<br /><br />The movie moves along at a fast paced, is thrilling and has a few twists and turns.<br /><br />If you liked \\"The Kingdom\\", \\"Vantage Point\\" and / or \\"Charlie Wilson's War\\", you'll love \\"Body of Lies\\"~
0679731725|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Ishiguro's more recent novel, Never Let Me Go, which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize (The Remains of the Day won it in 1989). It was one of the few audiobooks I've ever listened to, and I think it was one of the few books I could really enjoy in that format. It has very simple prose and was easy to follow along with in the car.    The Remains of the Day is written in simple, deceptively straightforward prose. Ishiguro packs a punch into this short, easy to read narrative (much like Hilary Mantel did in Fludd- if you liked that book, I think you'll enjoy this one). Stevens, the narrator, is every bit the \\"stiff upper lipped\\" English butler that one would expect. His evolution, from the first page of the book to the last one, is so subtle, and yet so transformative, that one can only marvel that it happened at all and try to pinpoint when his thinking changed.    Stevens is not a very likable character. Most of the characters in the book are not. He is so repressed and so emotionally unavailable that it is almost funny. There are priceless moments when he tries to make a witticism, fails, and then spends a great deal of time analyzing why his joke went flat, and then commenting on the difficulties of \\"bantering\\" with another person. Sad and painful for him, I'm sure, but so fascinating. What would it be like to go through life so completely unable to connect with anyone? One of the saddest passages of the book to me took place in Stevens' butler's pantry, when the housekeeper comes inside to see what sort of book he is reading and he is very upset that she sees him reading a romance. The man's loneliness tears through every page.    Ishiguro's writing style is neat and unsentimental. He brilliantly writes from the point of view of a repressed old man. And the simple, unassuming redemption that occurs at the end... wonderful.    The Remains of the Day reminds me of Fludd in the starkness of its prose and its sense of satisfaction one gets at the end. I would highly recommend both books to anyone with an interest in 1950s England.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Happy with the product and most especially happy with fast shipping and handling.  Thank you.
B000PMFS2I|4.0|This ain't the greatest movie, the story line is, well, kinda stupid, but if your a man who likes watching a little T & A, or if you have visited Las Vegas before and want to re-live a little memory, than this movie is entertaining enough to watch once in a while...
B0016A2FFG|5.0|It's strange to hear people talk about Al's \\"come Back\\" with this compilation.<br />In my opinion, he never left the stage. This group of recordings is vintage<br />Al: smooth, seamless, timeless. He's the Master of Soul, and if you love the<br />Reverand's previous works, you'll not regret adding this one to your collection.<br />I simply can't take this disc out of my player. I'm purchasing it for two friends<br />who I know will be thrilled with it. Bravo Al! Keep Standing in the Rain!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|There really isn't much more to add to the previous reviews about the show, since the DVD isn't out yet. I would like to add that Nathan Fillion also portrayed Joey Buchanan on abc's One Life to Live several years ago and, occasional, reprisals. That being said, you saw the serious, dramatic acting; in Castle, you see his comedic wit and catch yourself yearning for the next bit of humor amid the mystery of the crimes. Nathan and Stana Katic have super chemistry so his comedic timing works very well with her serious-detective mode.
B0023RSZZU|5.0|The Book Thief is the story of Leisel Meminger, a young German girl sent to live with a foster family at the start of WWII.  The narrator of this tale is Death, who first comes in contact with Leisel when he comes to take her younger brother. Despite repeated tries to stay away from Leisel, Death cannot resist her and keeps a close watch on her life, and that of her friends and family.  As the years progress Leisel's family becomes the reluctant protector of the Jewish man Max, who they hide in their basement.<br /><br />With wonderfully drawn characters, from the kind hearted `Papa' Hans, the tart tongued `Mama' Rose, the lemon haired Rudy, the bitter Max and The Book Thief herself, Leisel, this book will make you laugh, make you cry and make you want to read the book again, immediately after the last page. This is the book I am recommending to everyone.
031606792X|3.0|I've read the entire Twilight series.  I thought that this one was not as good as the others.  It wasn't bad.  Slow at parts.  Also, I felt that there were 2 books in one.  You end with one story, then another picks right up.  Not sure how I felt about that.
B001TOD92C|4.0|Short and sweet and to the point...  Mickey Rourke was robbed of that Oscar.  Flat-out robbed.
B0001HAISG|5.0|i looked everywhere for this peter pan on dvd (a newer version made in the 2000's) and found it brand new and priced well. the movie is perfect and got to me within a week or less.
1423113497|4.0|Friends of mine suggested that I read this series to my younger daughter.  I decided to read it so that maybe in the future she will be able to read the series herself.  I can't put the books down!  Wonderful story line and great writer!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|The first season of Castle has been great. It brings together the suspense of the various Law and Order series, the comedy of great shows like M*A*S*H, but without the pain.  Too many Law and Order episodes in a day (marathons on USA or TNT) are difficult to watch due to the focus on the graphic nature of the victims, but the story lines in Castle are real enough, but not difficult to watch.  Great chemistry between the main characters makes this show fun to watch.
B001P9KR8U|1.0|Expecting a feel good movie I was disgusted to see a child being tortured early in the movie. At that point I was going to stop watching it but instead made the mistake of watching the whole thing: Boy was I dissapointed. How this repulsive movie made the best movie of the year I don't know because there were much better movies which well deserve best movie of the year like \\"W.\\" for example. Don't waste your time with this BIG letdown!
B00005CDNF|4.0|ABBA, the Swedish treasure's third regular album, for the first time successfully weaved ABBA magic. This they did to such extent, that, maybe with the exception of \\"Dancing Queen\\", songs from \\"ABBA\\" (1975) are the most popular and most representative for many casual fans of the group. This mostly applies to \\"Mamma Mia\\" and \\"S.O.S\\". Other two singles, \\"I Do I Do I Do I Do I Do\\", which is a great tribute to the 1950's music and \\"Bang-a-Boomerang\\" end up high as well. The album as a whole, however, is a bit unfocused if rather eclectic, as if the group was bracing for the great strides that came later with \\"Arrival\\" and \\"The Album\\", two of the releases that topped \\"ABBA\\" in both songwriting and arrangements. Still, this is a classicist ABBA album, for a fan worth every cent or penny. It also offers some good neglected tracks like \\"Tropical Loveland\\" and \\"Intermezzo No. 1\\"
B001O4FGG4|5.0|Writer/director Victor Salva's intelligent creature feature is chock full of depth, substance and an opening that will make you think twice about driving on a seemingly solitary open road.     The two charismatic leads are three dimensional portraits of two kids in the right place at the wrong time. Justin Long proves he is much more than a pretty face. His performance offers texture, subtext... and the thrilling finale provides him with a genuine tour de force. Here is a fine actor working at the top of his game (and this was back in 2001). Watch for him on a red carpet, someday... as a nominee for that famous golden statuette.     Gina Philips, whose strength and ballsyness is reminiscent of ALIENS' Ripley and H20's Laurie Strode, delivers a star-making turn. She is utterly believable, whether engaged in juvenile banter with her brother or face-to-face with the object of her nightmares.      Eileen Brennan's cameo as The Cat Lady proves how important casting even the smallest of roles is. In her all-too-brief screen time she is hilarious and touching... chilling and endearing.    Jonathan Breck's Creeper offers a truly original, thought-provoking monster; effortlessly giving Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees a run for their money as title holders for the genre's scariest baddie.    The flick's behind-the-scenes wizards deserve special mention. The cinematography, art direction, score and editing expertly compliment this first class spook fest.     The operatic-like ending will have you humming the classic title song in your nightmares.
B00005CDNI|4.0|While the 1979's \\"Voulez-Vous\\" for many people does not make Top 3 of ABBA albums, it's one of the best disco-parties you can ever come across. Some of the songs are really the cream of ABBA, including two ballads \\"I Have a Dream\\" (track 3) and \\"Chiquitita\\" (track 8) that - depending on your opinion - either slow down the party, or come at the right time for dancers to chill. Among the best purely pop songs ever produced by ANYONE are \\"Angeleyes\\", \\"Does Your Mother Know\\" and the bonus track \\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!\\", later so well sampled in Madonna's \\"Hung Up\\". The album also includes minor gem \\"If It Wasn't For the Night\\", where the supergroup somehow came close to successfully emulating their signature hit \\"Dancing Queen\\". Cohesive in genre albeit slightly uneven in quality, \\"Voulez-Vous\\" is however not any less intoxicating than any of ABBA longplayers.
0394800389|5.0|I absolutely love this book! One of my favorite Dr. Seuss books, I've read this to my daughter for years and still never get tired of it. I love the tongue twisters and the funny pictures (no pun intended), and it's always a game to see how fast I can read it. I've actually memorized a few pages by heart. I hope my daughter will still want me to read this to her even after she's old enough to read on her own.  I would recommend my second favorite Dr. Seuss book: Oh Say Can You Say.  Another classic book that will keep your tongue in knots!
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|I am addicted to Dexter.  The acting is superior, the scripts are filled with wonderful black humor  and are, at-the-same-time, chilling. Season Two was better yet. I only watch television series upon release of boxed sets, so now the wait is on for Season Three.  Dexter is not for everyone (trust me), but if you are looking for bold, brilliant entertainment, then this is the one for you!
0440229081|5.0|This book was recommended to me because I like \\"The Graveyard Book\\" by Neil Gaiman.  This book was very much in a similar writing style Gaiman's work.  The story telling in this book is superb.  The book itself is a short but sweet story.<br /><br />Michael and his family have just moved into a new home.  Unfortunately Michael's baby sister was born way too early and she is very sick.  Micheal is struggling with his parents' lack of attention as they try to deal with saving his little sister's life; when he stumbles into the shed in their backyard to find a parched, old crusty man alive in the back corner.  The old man calls himself a Skellig; exactly what is a Skellig?<br /><br />I thought this book was excellent.  The story telling was top notch.  The characterization was wonderful; I thought Michael's character was well done and even the parents were well characterized.  This is a very short book but is a great littlenovella .  The plot moved quickly and was full of mystery and suspense.  It was interesting that the story ties in with deeper aspects of life; like dreams and spirituality.  Some parts were a bit of tear jerker as Micheal's baby sister fights for her life, but the Skellig was a truly intriguing character.<br /><br />Almond's writing is detailed and brings both the characters and surroundings alive; he manages to add a sort of thought-provokingvagueness to aspects of the story while brushing against some things that humanity struggles with as a whole.  I was surprised at how deep and well told this little story was.  It's a book that I am keeping on my shelf and it made me want to read many more of David Almond's books.  He seems to be a very creative and adept storyteller.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|My fiance and i borrowed the whole series from a friend, got hooked, and had to see the movie! Definitely a must-see!
B001514J6O|1.0|After waiting for several weeks, I received this video and the sound was set for Europe... Could not get the TV sound in English.  I e-mailed the seller, who was in Australia, much to my surprise, and they said they couldn't advise me how to correct the problem.  I could return the video for a refund.  I figured it would cost more to return it to Australia than to go for the refund.  Very disappointed.
B001MEJY8W|4.0|wow what a disturbingly good movie this is one alot of people probally wont get but deserves credit its gory, suspenseful, and scary at times in many ways than what were used to.Brilliantly acted and looks so real u just have to watch it yourselves and decide i will say if u have a weak stomach and didnt care for hostel or the girl next door then avoid it other than that worth a look
B000JBWWQ0|1.0|I don't know why I'm doing this. There is this longing for finding something deeper in life. I want to be without prejudice and hope that perhaps I find something, or fear I might miss something if I don't watch a movie like this one. But again I ended up in embarrassment to have actually watched this entire movie. I won't tell a friend that I watched the whole thing because it was the most hideous pseudo spiritual kitsch I've seen in a long time, and I should have been able to see that when I looked at the cover of the DVD. It was about as bad as one of the propaganda movies about Joseph Smith that you can watch when you visit the visitors centre of the Mormon Church in Salt Lake City. Scratch that, that Joseph Smith movie had at least some informative value. Other than that, it was a similar story: scrolls provided by angels and translated with divine help. Think of those Sunday school books for children for a $1.00 at Ocean State Jobs lots, or for a dime on a garage sale, with Moses and the Lamb and God making a fancy light show in the sky. If you really want to watch this movie, wait until you can get it for a dime on a garage sale. The one star is for the music, that was OK.
B00000JNOJ|5.0|Most people who are familiar with Muddy Waters know him as an electric urban blues artist. But he recorded acoustic blues on Stovall's Plantation several years before heading for Chicago.     This album is an acoustic recording that takes Muddy back to his pre-electric years. Here he handles a nice assortment of traditional and Chicago blues numbers. The singing is strong and the playing is appropriate to the roots style.     We often forget that many of the postwar Chicago musicians were country people who were raised on Mississippi farms. Muddy Waters shows here that he never forgot his roots.
0312370849|5.0|Remains one of my favorite books of all time. First book I've ever read by Tatiana de Rosnay. Very well written, felt like I was there from the very start. I love the suspense, the historical fiction and how she brought it around full circle in the end.
B000KWZ7VU|1.0|I have always thought that Daniel Barenboim has all along been overrated as a pianist, since the early 1970's.<br />True that he is a 'star' pianist; with all the associations with his former wife and all the stories; but frankly, apart from that, he has never attained maestro status in the strict sense of the word. He has crossed over to conducting this last decade, and his performance at the keyboard rightfully and logically diminished even further in terms of luster and style.<br />These Beethoven sonatas, whatever you might call it, is in no way satisfying in that they are rather graceless and glacial all in one.<br />Graceless in that the pianist seems not to pay heed to the sonics but just concentrates on the pyro-techniques. Nowhere could you find a more ponderous sounding set of Beethoven sonatas: just listen to the end of each phrase, each harmonic structure. May be he has a reason for this, but I find the blurring and the clamouring very much distasteful, and could under no circumstances imagine that these are the composer's wishes.<br />One saving aspect of this set is the 'master classes' - interesting, though you doubt if it is really that instructive.
B001EN71HC|5.0|It worth the money by re-watching the movie with director's commentary. Love the thin blu-ray disc plastic box design, I hope every blu ray disc use the thin size so that it won't occupy so many space!
B001TH16DS|5.0|The Program:<br /><br />If I could find something new to say about Star Trek, that would be a feat in itself. Let it suffice to say that it's the most successful TV sci-fi franchise of all time, was a pioneering show in many respects, and is just darned entertaining to watch, whether you're a \\"true believer\\" or not.<br /><br />Season One of the Original Series is a great place to start for newbies and fanatics alike. We are introduced to the Romulans, Klingons, Khan, Starfleet, the Federation of Planets, and the whole crew short of Chekov, who appears in Season Two. We are presented with 29 episodes, at least 6 of which are absolute masterpieces, and another 10 of which are really, really good. In this package, you'll get classics such as \\"The City on The Edge of Forever,\\" \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before,\\" \\"Balance of Terror,\\" \\"The Menagerie,\\" \\"The Devil In The Dark,\\" and \\"Space Seed.\\" Overall, it's the Original Series' strongest season, and it only has two real clunkers in the group (\\"Shore Leave\\" and \\"The Galileo Seven\\").<br /><br />There's really not a whole lot to be faulted in this season. It's an absolutely rock solid item for any Trekkie, and indeed any sci-fi fan, to own.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />So the question becomes, how is the presentation?<br /><br />Well, it should be said right off the bat that the HD transfers of these shows are absolutely sparkling. Detail is through the roof, making every smile line, button and dial, star, and ship detail just pop right off the screen. Black levels are rock solid, especially in space scenes. Color saturation is deeper than deep, and bright colors are radiant in a way that the previous DVDs just can't replicate. The show is presented in its original 4:3 aspect ratio - thank goodness CBS/Paramount didn't try to stretch these shows in a manner similar to many \\"HD\\" rebroadcasts of older shows on cable.<br /><br />The Original Series was shot on 35 mm film stock, which has more detail than any 480i TV broadcast can resolve (or 480p DVD for that matter). Thus, it is truly benefited by a high definition transfer. This isn't a release where you look at it and say \\"well, it looks pretty good for what it is.\\" In fact, it has just as much fine detail and the same superior color as the newest shows currently broadcast on TV in HD. And it really does blow away the previous DVDs, too. There are, of course, a few shots here and there that betray their age. This is just the nature of the beast when dealing with 40 year old celluloid elements. But all told, a good 90% of the shots are competitive with modern HD. So as far as a video rating goes, it's at least 4 star material on average.<br /><br />Audio is a tad problematic. Some of the sound balancing seems to be a bit off - dialogue can have a tough time keeping up with music and sound effects. It's perfectly clear, don't get me wrong. But I found myself fiddling with the volume controls more than I'd like throughout an episode. On the other hand, the audio in general is great. The re-recorded theme song is breathtaking - especially when the Enterprise \\"wooosh-es\\" by from the front speakers to the rear surrounds. Red Alert klaxons and atmospheric sounds generally are mixed towards the surround channels. It's very cool.<br /><br />Special effects sequences have been redone with modern CGI and in high definition. For the most part they look great, and it is quite refreshing in the era of the \\"Lucas-ing\\" (or is it Abrams-ifying?) of old material that the producers of the new effects went to such great lengths to respect the original design aesthetic of the 1960's material. I will say I kind of wish they had done new model work, as CG still just isn't to the point where it looks \\"real\\" (setting aside the fact that this is inherently unreal stuff being filmed...). But I understand that it would never have been done in that case, since it costs so much more these days to do model work as opposed to CGI. On balance, having new effects ismuch more good than bad.<br /><br />But the kicker, and the reason it would be no big deal even if one hated the new effects, is the fact that the original effects are on the same disc. You can watch an entire show with the old or new effects, or, if you'd prefer to irritate your friends and significant others, switch between them in real time with the \\"angle\\" button on your remote. Are you paying attention, George Lucas? This is what we want in a Star Wars Blu-Ray! The beautiful new with the respected old, side-by-side. Big kudos go to CBS/Paramount and the Trek team for the job they've done here.<br /><br />Also included are several extra features. Mini-documentaries, mostly reprised from the previous DVD set, are included one on each disc. The \\"pop-up\\" text commentary from the DVD has been retained as \\"Starfleet Access,\\" a combination video-text commentary. The videos are nice, but they talk over the audio from the episode, whereas the older text commentary did not interfere with the audio. I wish both could have been included. New features include a mini-doc on the HD restoration and effects, and a set of \\"home movies\\" from an extra on the Trek set. Especially cool is an interactive \\"tour\\" of the original series Enterprise, showing many nooks and crannies not often seen or discussed, on the same gorgeous HD CGI model that the new shots use. All in all, a healthy set of extras.<br /><br />The packaging is nowhere near as bad as some previous DVD Trek seasons, but it still has its issues. Why can we not be presented with episode titles on each disc? The discs are just blank silver paint, with loads of empty space that helpful titles could have occupied. Instead, the episodes are listed on the INSIDE of the Blu-Ray insert, and are covered by both the filler material in the front, and by a disc in back. Being required to pop out a disc to see the contents of three more is really not convenient.<br /><br />*****<br />The audio niggles and the packaging stupidity might be enough to make some downgrade this to a four star rating. I am swayed however, by the consistently good (and occasionally astounding) HD clarity of the video, and the wonderful options for old and new special effects. The other things are minor issues in the scheme of things. This is a tremendously good presentation of an absolutely seminal television show and science fiction saga. The respect with which the \\"restoration\\" was handled is truly commendable.<br /><br />Any Trekkie/Trekker who has a Blu-Ray player should own this set. It's just that simple.

B001U0HBQ0|3.0|Curious Case of Benjamin Button is the type of movie made for Academy Award season. Based on a F. Scott Fitzgerald story, we witness a man who is born old and ages backwards. It is an interesting premise, and the acting is well done. Brad Pitt plays the lead role, and shows off his skills while portraying Benjamin at different ages. Taraji P. Henson gives an academy award-nominated performance as the motherly figure who takes him under her wing, and Cate Blanchett plays the love of his life. The story spans several years, even generations. The makeup department did an amazing job at portraying this. The main issue I have with the movie is that it is entirely too long. By the time the most emotional part of the story came along, it was nearly three hours later and there wasn't enough to keep me interested until then.
B00003CXSM|5.0|I love this movie.  I can watch it over and over. Helps me forget for 2 hours all my woes and believe in love. What can I say,  I'm a Romantic Fool.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Got hold of this Box Set on Blu Ray a couple of days ago, first one I played was The Motion Picture, I was prepared for disappointment because it always looks terrible and my previous directors cut dvd was dreadful. However I was impressed with the quality, with the exception of some of the special effects scenes which use third and fourth generation film prints, quality was on a par with the recent Blu Ray james bond releases of Dr No and from Russia with love.    Next up was Wrath of Khan, this is my favourite star trek film as it has the best story, it states on the packaging that this particular movie has undergone extensive restoration so I was expecting even better than the first movie but I was disappointed, the image is by far the worst of the box set, its even worse in a lot of scenes than my unconverted dvd version, I don't know what they've done to this movie but the quality is bad with grain all over the place.    Star trek 3 is on a par with the first movie in terms of quality, so there was no disappointment there, Star Trek 4 is similar but many of the scenes are filmed using various forms of camera filters and the like, so you don't really get to see many clear scenes but this is only down to the quality of the filming techniques used and not the transfer.     Next up Star trek 5 and 6, 5 has some great moments of clarity and again its a good transfer which only dulls in its high def clarity when filters and lighting techniques dull the image, Star Trek 6 is on a similar level to 3 with a good transfer but the story lags a bit and tends to take itself too seriously. The captains Summit is an easy way to pass an hour, you don't really learn anything new except that William shatner has never managed to sit through a complete episode of next generation, that makes two of us.    Overall a decent release, and when you compare it with the likes of Fox's box set of the original planet of the apes movies, or Warners Dirty Harry re-issues on blu ray, you see how good it really is. The only real disappointment is Wrath of khan, ime wondering if they've accidentally lost the negative to this movie or something as the transfer just isn't high def quality, and ime hoping this movie will be remastered again at some point from better source materials.
0140182829|5.0|This is one of top 10 favorite books.  This is the 2nd copy I have purchased and I have lent them out to friends and family because it is such a great book.
B001VB8UAE|5.0|One word to say is WOW!!!!! this boxset is amazing!!!! Okay now lets get one thing straight..... No her voice isn't what it used to be, However she is still the greatest female singer of all time!!! PERIOD!!!! Although I do believe the 2006 concert is The best for a few reasons mostly because She is more relaxed and she puts way more emotion into the songs than she EVER has before!!!! Her relationship with her fans has grown and it is very noticable!!!! I also think that the live perfomance of My Man in the 2006 concert is the ABSOLUTE best she has ever sang the song live!! Although I must say one performance that shocked me and had me jumping up and down was the reprise of Don't Rain On My Parade! that performance I think is also the greatest live version to date!!! The Arrowhead Pond concert is simply brilliant!!!! it being the first time she ever sang the Yentl medley live is breathtaking.... All in all this boxset is a must have!!! Barbra is still amazing!!! This should be treasured for generations to come!!!!
B001P9KR94|5.0|I watched the Oscars without having seen Slumdog Millionaires. I thought Hollywood was making too much out of the movie. However, after watching it for myself, I can honestly say this is the first fresh and innovative movie I have seen in at least a decade. It doesn't follow the well-worn Hollywood conventions and stereotypes. The acting is heartwarming, not mushy. The characters take interesting and unexpected twists.     The movie also teaches Western audiences (most of whom have never been to the slums of a developing country) about the struggles of life as a \\"slumdog\\" without lecturing or moralizing. In fact, at times, the movie turns heartbreaking situations into heartwarming ones. For example, in one scene, a little boy wants to see a famous movie star but is locked in a run-down outhouse, so he runs out of the outhouse, through the waste, and asks for the movie star's autograph while he is covered in poop.     This is definitely one of the best movies of the past few years. I certainly hope Danny Boyle makes more great movies like this.
1401923119|5.0|This book suggests a great thing telling details about the cells' behaviour and their membrane having the role of the brain for the cells.  It's a revolutionary thing to learn, especially because the new observations lead to the idea about us having a chance to shape our own fate if we learn about how the cells work...  There are many very valuable ideas in the book and the freshness and joy of the discoveries are shared with the reader with great sincerity and human warmth. I was so happy to choose this book. It's like a gateway to a new world, but first of all a hope for a better future!
B001YV502C|2.0|At first, this film seemed to be a sci-fi film noire in the mold of Blade Runner. It portrays a dystopian society in which women lack fertility. Indeed, unlike a lot of sci-fi films nowadays, \\"Children of Men\\" does not shy away from making dystopia realistic and grisly. Key characters are killed suddenly, the color palate is mainly grey, and all of the key characters have traits that make them less than admirable. In one chilling scene, an important character is last shown being taken away by troops with a hood over her head, which is the last we see of her.    The film could have really been a sci-fi hit had it not been so pointless. It lacks focus and the plot never really grabs the viewer's interest. A lot of important relationships and plot twists are left unexplained. We never learn why women become infertile or why immigrants are treated so badly, except perhaps that this is a dystopia. Unlike Blade Runner, the movie had no insightful moment or moral revelation. Rather than provoking thought, the film's end seems too hollywood for the genre.    I like the style of dystopia, the basic idea by P.D. James, and the cinematography, but the plot (which should be the heart of the film) is just not strong enough. I found myself bored during the film and frankly not caring about the characters or the outcome. I would give the director another shot at a sci-fi dystopia, but with a tighter story-line.

B001FBIPF0|5.0|I heart fall out boy aaf ever since their release of \\"infinity on high\\". I would also give that album 5 stars, every track was a good song! and the same for this album.....i only know of \\"dance dance\\" and \\"sugar we're going down\\" from their first \\"big\\" album \\"from under the cork tree\\" and like those songs but every time i try to listen to other songs from that album or previous albums, i'm just not feeling them. I see a lot of people writing that they don't like their new stuff b/c \\"they changed\\" their style, and maybe they did but not everyone has to hate it.....everyone likes different things and i personally do not love their old stuff but love the new! one of the best bands!
0385340990|5.0|Not surprisingly since it was on the best seller list and written by two people, I thought this would be a disappointment--just more chic-lit--so I resisted ordering it initially.  Thanks to the recommendation of my daughter-in-law who has exquisite taste in literature,  I now can say that I have read a little gem, a book I wish I had written! \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" recalls \\"84 Charing Cross Road\\"[[ASIN:1559211407 84, Charing Cross Road]] and that delightful E. M. Delafield series The Provincial Lady--especially \\"The Provincial Lady in Wartime\\" [[ASIN:1853753688 Diary of a Provincial Lady (Prion Humour Classics)]].  But this work stands on its own.  The authors have created delightful characters handled sympathetically but without sentimentality ( they knew when to stop with cute). Though one would think that WWII occupation stories had been done to death, the spotlight on one small story in such an isolated locale extends the illumination to include the whole of that world.
B001MYIXAW|4.0|WATCH THIS MOVIE WITH SUBTITLES! DO NOT WATCH IT DUBBED!    This Movie Makes \\"Twilight\\" Look Like A Bad \\"G\\" Rated Movie. \\"Let The Right One In\\" Features REAL Vampires With Fangs That Die In The Daylight, Instead Of Sparkling Like In Twilight (Wow). And It's Actually Really Cool To See Very Young Vampires For Once. Anyway, Just Give This Movie A Shot, It's Definitely Worth Seeing (Remember, Only With Subtitles).
B001FB55MG|4.0|If you are looking for laughs, inspiration, and tears all in the same film, your bus stops here. Bedtime Stories is  wacky and warm-hearted family viewing about believing in your dreams. Would have given it five stars, but there are places where it gets away from good fun and tries to be hip. Would have been perfect without the trashy party-girl character, but thankfully she has a minor role.

0307346617|3.0|I'm not a hard core zombie fan or a fan of the horror genre in general, but I enjoyed World War Z.  This work of fictional non-fiction is modeled on The Good War by Studs Terkel (the author even refers to himself as the `Studs Terkel of Zombie Journalism').<br /><br />World War Z isn't funny enough to be an all-out parody and isn't suspenseful or terrifying enough to give anyone chills.  It can be funny at times (I particularly enjoyed the interview with the former White House Chief of Staff who, in the aftermath of the Zombie War, literally shovels manure for a living).  But for the most part, World War Z plays it straight.  It's never laugh-out-loud funny, but the fact that it takes itself so seriously and never `breaks character' is a big part of what makes the novel work.  World War Z is clever and its author has clearly given some very serious thought as to how a zombie plague might start, spread, and ultimately be defeated.<br /><br />Thriller and horror fans should take note though.  There is virtually no suspense here. World War Z is a series of vignettes compiled from the oral histories of dozens of characters from all around the world.  They are generally sequential but because there is no central character, no central story - there is no urgency.  Instead, the reader is presented with snippets that, when pieced together, give the reader `the big picture of the Zombie War'.  This is not an intimate story of one person's experience (or the experience of a small group of people) but rather an overview of the strategies employed throughout the world to deal with the zombie threat.<br /><br />If you are looking for an actual horror novel (ie: a group of teenagers are trapped in a mall with the undead and must destroy the zombie shoppers before the zombies eat their brains) World War Z may not impress you.  Personally, I liked the format of this `novel' and liked the strategy involved.  How does one survive a zombie onslaught? How can the nations of the world combat an army of undead that can neither be shocked nor awed?<br /><br />Brooks does a great job of exploring the Zombie War from every angle imaginable and developing a litany of slang related to zombies and zombie warfare.  It is so well thought out and clever that the pages turned quickly despite the absence of suspense.  That said - I did find that World War Z opened much stronger than it closed.  One other criticism (relatively minor) is that most of the characters who provide an oral history are blatant stereo types.  It would have been nice if Brooks had put as much effort into fleshing out his characters as he did other aspects of this novel.<br /><br />Still: for a non-zombie fan, I enjoyed this clever parody. 3 ½ stars.ead that can neither be shocked nor awed?

B0018O4YT0|5.0|I don't see why this film was considered to be terrible when \\"The Matrix\\" was a hit. Many people consider this movie hard to understand, but the plot is no more complex than \\"The Matrix\\". In fact, this film inspired \\"The Matrix\\". This film has great performances, great directing, great sets, great special effects, and a great plot. This is very much a sci-fi mystery with some great action scenes added into the mix. The plot is very thought provoking, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. This director's cut features some added scenes to let you get to know the charaters a bit more and deletes the annoying opening narration. These changes greatly add to the film. If you are a fan of \\"The Matrix\\", then I highly recommed this movie.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is one of the best shows on TV in a long time.  It fills the void of crime drama/comedy that hasn't been seen in years.  In these days of quirky off the wall shows, Castle offers the perfect blend of suspense, crime solvings and comedy.  Plus, the romantic chemistry/sexual tension between Castle and Det. Kate Beckett is palatable.  The show tends to remind one of \\"Moonlighting\\" but with more substance, not to mention that Nathan Fillion puts Bruce Willis to shame. The secondary characters are more than just \\"fillers\\".  Susan Sullivan as Castle's mother is a hoot, but also provides insight to why Castle is the way he is.  Castle's relationship with is daughter also give the character another diminsion so that we soon learn he is more than the skirt chasing author as portrayed in the TV trailers.  The detectives and police chief with whom Beckett works are more than background characters and their interactions with Beckett, Castle and each other are priceless.  By including cameos by real life authors such as James Patterson and Stephen J. Cannell, the writers lend to the credibility that Castle is indeed an author and not just a TV show.  If ABC fails to renew this show for a second season it will be a true loss.
B000PMGS8G|4.0|I first seen this as a kid, and loved it. I just recently bought it, and realized how corny it is at times. When you're a kid you don't know about corny, but when you get older, you start to realize what corny is and it's not good. But if you try to ignore the corny parts, it's actually quite good. The film can actually be quite dramatic at times. Performances, apart from Sam J. (what's his name?)'s acting, are pretty good. Too bad about the Flash Gordon guy - terrible actor. The story and plot are great since this is just a remake of the original 1936 \\"Flash Gordon\\" serial. The end is action-packed, and even though the special effects are not \\"Star Wars\\" effects, I still thought they were pretty good. Then again, I am a \\"Dr. Who\\" fan, so special effects don't bother me as much as some people. If you like old sci-fi shows like \\"Flash Gordon\\" and \\"Dr. Who\\", then I highly recommed this film.
B000BCE918|5.0|I don't know if there are actually people who have not seen these movies but if your one of them, you should check them out, especially if you have kids.<br />I originally purchased this set as an addition to my husband's HUGE DVD collection. However, before he had a chance to watch them my nephews then 4 and 6 borrowed them, loved them, watched them repeatedly (without adult supervision, I might add) and when we got them back the box was crushed, the DVD's themselves were scratched and had lots of little candy coated fingerprints on them. So... we gave that set to the older boy who was the most interested in them at the time. I then replaced the set for my husband, who maybe watched it once. Now my nephews are 7 and 10 and come here after school everyday. The younger boy is nuts about the Jurassic Park movies and begs to watch them at least three times a week. So he has been watching them repeatedly and always with my supervision and help in getting the DVD's into and out of the player, my husband is really fanatical about his DVD's he makes sure everyone knows the proper way to hold them (by the sides with fingers not touching the bottom or top. My nephew gets stuck on certain one's, for a month he will want to watch only the first one, then he changes and wants to watch only the second one, he isn't all that crazy about the third one at all but will watch it, if I won't let him watch the other two. The reason I don't want him watching the same one's over and over is because it seems that DVD's have a \\"shelf-life\\" for want of a better word. They begin to skip if watched too many times and this isn't just with the Jurassic Park movies, there are many DVD's in our collection that the boy's have fallen in love with and wanted to watch every day or all day over and over and those movies all begin to skip. I never noticed this until I had kid's around alot and they watched movies repeatedly and I will reiterate, I do not let them handle the DVD's themselves and it isn't the DVD player because we have three and I have at times let them watch the same movie repeatedly on the same DVD player and on different one's. So I hope that the Blu-ray DVD's are made better or that they start making regular DVD's better because I just had to buy my husband a THIRD set of Jurassic Park movies and gave the old set to my youngest nephew. He will of course not be allowed to watch the new set, but I fear one of these days the old set will not only skip but stop working all together, hopefully he will have moved on to a new movie by then because I can't replace this set too many more times or I am going to go broke. Although, the price on this set is very good, I think I paid $60 for the set the first time I bought it and around $40 the second, so $14.99 this time was a real blessing and it's even widescreen.<br />Of all of the movies that my nephews get enamored with, the Jurassic Park set is one of my favorites because not only are they appropriate for the kid's and even somewhat educational but they are also quite tolerable for adults, even entertaining. I often find myself sitting down and watching them with them, for the 100th time. I am trying at this point to get them to listen to me read them the books. I read Jurassic Park and The Lost World (only two books, not three) years ago and loved them, so now that my nephews love the movies so much and I am trying to instill a love of books in them, I thought this would be one of those opportune times to slip a book in and show them how much fun reading can be. So if you have kids and they like dinosaurs and/or action movies then try these out, but make sure they don't handle the DVD's or if they do, that they know the proper way to hold them.he DVD player because we have three and I have at times let them watch the same movie repeatedly on the same DVD player and on different one's.

0375704027|4.0|\\"Norwegian Wood\\" by Haruki Murakami<br /><br />Toru Watanabe, now 37, has just arrived at the Hamburg airport. A song begins to play over the intercom speakers, a elevator version of the Beatles `Norwegian Wood\\"  which brings Toru back to the autumn of 1969 when he was about to turn 20. Times were tumultuous in Japan and no less so for Toru. Toru was friends with a couple, Naoko and Kazuki. Before High School was over Kazuki commits suicide effectively severing Toru's relationship with Naoko. Now in college Toru is reconnected with Naoko through a chance meeting and finds he is interested in pursuing a relationship with her...<br /><br />\\"Norwegian Wood\\" is my 4th round of Murakami with \\"[[ASIN:037571894X A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel]]\\", \\"[[ASIN:1400079276 Kafka on the Shore]]\\", and \\"[[ASIN:0679775439 The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: A Novel]]\\" already on the have read list. \\"Norwegian Wood\\" isn't the best of the 4 (that honor goes to Kafka) but it does stand out. Norwegian Wood is the only one that doesn't delve into the spiritual and metaphysical elements that I have found to be a staple aspect of the other Murakami novels I have read. Although this element is missing it is still obviously Murakami behind the typewriter.<br /><br />The Good: Murakami has his own style that draws you into the characters. Murakami's work also gives you a glimpse into Japanese culture which was always an interesting aspect of his work for me. His prose (although translated) and his characters are the foundation on which this story unravels.<br /><br />The Bad: Nothing memorable.<br /><br />Overall: Murakami is definitely not for everyone. If you have enjoyed his other work you will likely enjoy this as well although it is the most traditional of his work. If you haven't read Murakami before I wouldn't suggest starting here as it would give you the wrong impression with regards to what to expect from the rest of his work.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Hard to believe that a movie this old could still be improved upon, but it has been.  With this new blu-ray edition, the surround sound is incredible and the video re-mastering is great. I didn't think it would be much better than the DVD version, but it is.  If you love this movie and are thinking of upgrading to Blu-ray, don't hesitate, its actually worth the money.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|The setting for this movie is circa 1964 at Writer/Director Shanley's school, run by the Sisters of Charity in Bronx, New York. An Order founded by famed Mother Seton, the Sisters wore widow's garb, as this was how she was dressed by friends in Italy following her husband's death, and the Sisters were too poor to afford anything else.  Thus the costume became a Habit (from the DVD interview with the Sisters).  The clothing itself is intimidating--dark and reminiscent of crows.  The camera alights on a crow during the movie and the similarities become even more obvious.  In fact, Director Shanley uses the forces of nature to underscore the evil discussed: electric light bulbs explode unexpectedly, howling winds smash branches from trees, leaves pour out of the trees and the winds practically carry Meryl Streep away.     But it is the cast and the performances of all four key characters (Streep, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis) that is truly outstanding  and which bring this disturbing drama to life.  \\"Doubt\\" is about a Priest whose possible improper relationship with a particular boy is a cause of concern.  What we see, what we think we believe and what we want to believe are all in question.  Streep has spent a lifetime in roles for which she has been lauded as the greatest living actress.  In my opinion this is one of her finest performances.   She makes you hate her for her determination to get rid of this Priest when there is no certainty about what has happened.  On the other hand she makes you admire her for her determination to do what she believes is right. In a changing world she refuses to change, and holds back progressive thinking.  But, is she entirely wrong?    This is a thought-provoking, haunting movie (and award-winning stage play).  It will linger long after the movie is over, and the surprise ending is perfect. How refreshing it is to find something so well written, acted and directed.  Bravo!
B000002UAO|5.0|The year 1965 saw the Beatles' domination of pop music being challenged by the likes of folk-rock, Motown, Memphis/Stax, and R&B/Soul.<br />Rather than quietly continuing to crank out single after single, the Fab Four chose to take on the competition with their own styles.<br /><br />R&B and soul musicians coined the phrase \\"Plastic Soul\\" to describe Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger, and the Beatles chose to parody that with the title \\"Rubber Soul\\".<br />The title may have been a joke, but the music certainly wasn't.<br /><br />John & Paul offered compositions that were a considerable leap forward from their previous album, \\"Help!\\".<br />George also offered two fine efforts, while even Ringo co-authored a tune.<br />14 tracks in all, that showed facets of all the music that challenged their chart success.<br /><br />  The Tracks:<br /><br />Paul's \\"Drive My Car\\" opens the album, and turns things around instumentally, as Paul not only sings in the 2&3 part harmony, but plays the lead & slide guitar parts, as well as piano, while George lays down the bass line, doubling it with electric guitar as well.<br />Paul & John harmonize the verses, while George joins on the choruses. It's a rock feel, yet soulful. A nice opening.<br /><br />\\"Norwegian Wood\\" (This Bird Has Flown), is John's tale of an extra-marital affair, that features his acoustic 12-string , and bridge harmonies from Paul.<br />It is George, however, who supplies the key musical element; his newly acquired sitar,an Indian stringed instrument that produces an exotic buzzing sound that evokes visions of the mystic east.<br /><br />\\"You Won't See Me\\" is Paul's salute to the Motown vocal groups, both male and female.<br />His lead vocal, backed by John and George's \\"ooh-la-las\\", give a 4 Tops type of sound, yet more rock and rollish.<br />Roadie Mal Evans drones a single organ note during the last verse, as well.<br /><br />\\"Nowhere Man\\" is John's first \\"message\\" song, as he refers to himself as a \\"nowhere man\\".<br />Glorious 3-part harmony, a solid bass groove, and the treble-y Fender Stratocasters (George's solo is outstanding) - along with Ringo's classic drumming make for one of John's top 5 all-time Beatles songs.<br /><br />George's first contribution \\"Think for Yourself\\", is a powerful number musically and lyrically.<br />George's lead vocal is all but dripping with angst, with interjections from Paul, who drives home the anger with his new Rickenbacker bass plugged into a fuzz box. Powerful stuff...<br /><br />\\"The Word\\" has a musical inspiration from funky artists such as James Brown and Wilson Pickett.<br />The choruses are 7add9 chords, shaped into a 12-bar blues, while the verses are written in a I-VI-III-IV pattern, with George doubling the bass line with guitar again. Producer George Martin contributes harmonium solos.<br />Lyrically, John was foreshadowing \\"All You Need Is Love\\". Could this have been the first \\"hippie\\" song ? Hmm...<br /><br />\\"Michelle\\" has often been praised as a beautiful ballad.<br />The fact is...it's one big joke !<br />Paul-back in the early 1960's, would take a guitar to artsy parties, play that tune and act like Maurice Chevalier, in an attempt to score with women.<br />During the \\"Rubber\\" sessions, John told him to put words to \\"that silly French thing\\", and the words were just as silly, because the man in the song is in love with the French girl, but only knows one sentence in French ! Hilarious! The song was covered by many people, and the Beatles laughed all the way to the bank...<br /><br />\\"What Goes On ?\\" is Ringo's vocal contribution, and he gets a writing credit as well. A straight country-rock tune done live in the studio in one take.

B001U0HBPG|5.0|The clock runs backwards-that is the opening symbol of the movie, a clockmaker whose son is killed in WWI creates a clock that runs backwards so all the boys killed in the war can live full lives. When I was a kid I thought life was something you had already experienced and you were telling the story to somebody, and that is the structure of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.<br /><br />The story is told in flashback form, mirroring the life lived in reverse theme. An old woman dying in a hospital as hurricane Katrina rages outside the hospital, as the woman's daughter reads a diary by Benjamin. Benjamin is born as WWI ends, his mother dies in childbirth and his father discovers the child is born as an old person. He abandons the child at an old people's home and Benjamin grows up, but he's also growing younger at the same rate he would grow up. Benjamin fits in at the old people's home, when someone asks him how old he is and replies 7, they think he's just an old person with a great attitude. As Benjamin grows chronologically older he experiences some of the same experiences as a child would, a growing sense of wanting to know more about the outside world. He meets Daisy a beautiful red haired, blue eyed girl who is about 8 to his 12 and introduces him to a curiosity about girls, even though Daisy's grandmother assumes he's a dirty old man. In his late teens, Benjamin notices he's growing younger and he inadvertently gets a job on tug boat that takes him on a series of adventures around the world. He's promised Daisy to send a postcard from every place he visits and he lives up to his promise. His adventures as a sailor carry him through World War II, and when he returns home he's starting to look noticeably younger and when he runs into the Daisy he discovers she's now a young woman in her early 20's and a dancer, and she's as in love with Benjamin as he is with her. Unfortunately, life doesn't allow us to be with the person we're in love with, at least not at first. Their love becomes the love of a lifetime and all the time Benjamin becoming younger as Daisy ages and they're able to meet in the middle. As Benjamin becomes younger the movie demonstrates that childhood and old age aren't that far apart in experience. At the end of the movie we see the magic of love and how chronology isn`t everything in age or love.<br /><br />Brad Pitt as Benjamin is absolutely solid in the performance, it's nuanced, there are no pyrotechnics in his performance but he's believable at every age of Benjamin from a man in his 80's to a teenage self. Cate Blanchett as Daisy continues to be a chameleon on the screen, ably playing a young woman, middle aged, or as Bob Dylan, or even Katherine Hepburn. Taraji Henson is worth mentioning as Benjamin's mother, she's a talented actress whom I first noticed in Hustle & Flow gives another fine performance here.<br /><br />The screenplay is by Eric Roth who also wrote Forrest Gump and while there are some similarities, but it's not the same type of movie where Benjamin's adventures have him bump into every famous person or event during his lifetime. Benjamin's adventure through life are less ostentatious but no less important in quality of a life lived. The story is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story and in certain moments you can still see the genius Fitzgerald's talent assert itself.<br /><br />The DVD edition is a one disc set and there are no bonus features or commentaries, there just may not have been room due to the length of the movie.heir love becomes the love of a lifetime and all the time Benjamin becoming younger as Daisy ages and they're able to meet in the middle.

I won't give away what happens when she leaves again, except to say that it confirmed how much Lois is sloppy seconds.  If you like the whole boring 70 years of Lois and Clark, then you may want to watch this season or just buy Lois and Clark with Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher.  I will give credit to the Legion of Superheroes.  They were pretty cool.  The Hex episode was heard to be pretty lame.  If Clark was granted a wish, I know what he should have used it on.
B00005JLIU|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS SIMPLY AMAZING! It is filled with humor, love, and tons of heart-warming songs. This is such a good movie and I really recommend you buy it!!!
B000VZUWZW|5.0|Occasionally my directtv drops out for some stupid reason, and I don't get shows I'm Tivoing. So I'd actually like to pay some money to download and watch it so everyone in my family can enjoy it, rather than relying on hulu (which is great, but not exactly a family-sharing experience).  Please provide season 2 for us!!  Obviously I am not the only one.
B001W63DY6|4.0|Ok let me first say that the reviews that say they couldn't wait until June '09, you don't have to. I just picked mine up at Barnes & Noble.  I must say I was dissapointed with two things. The DVD versions includes a bonus concert from 1994 which the blu-ray doesn't have. Also, I was at the actual 2006 concert and some of the songs were removed from the original order in the show and included as a bonus feature.
1400063515|3.0|I can't remember being so annoyed by a book before.    Kaleb's central premise -- that our understanding of the world expands in jolts precipitated by rare, unexpected, and consequential events he calls \\"Black Swans\\" -- is well worth the effort, but his contrary style, which ranges from whimsical to smug to caustic, makes reading this book an effort indeed.  Similar to a Socratic sapping, but without any trace of humility.    However, if you can manage to ignore the author's voice and focus on the message, this is a very good book.
0375760067|5.0|In Michael Henchard, Thomas Hardy created a tragic figure of Shakespearean dimension. The opening scene of a drunken Henchard selling off his wife and infant child at a country fair immediately establishes him as a rash and impetuous character. These qualities will return to haunt him and those nearest to him again and again as his fortune rises and falls.<br />Henchard is contrasted with the genial and almost too innocent Scotsman Donald Farfrae who starts as his friend but becomes his rival in almost all things. Farfrae has an easy charm about him that makes him an unwitting competitor that stirs additional dark forces in Henchard as his rashness mixes with a growing envy.<br /><br />The Mayor Of Casterbridge is one of Hardy's great works alongside Tess and Jude The Obscure. Hardy's vision is dark and the relentless sadness in his work may put off some but in the end these characters he created are as strong as tragic figures as those of any writer in the English language.<br /><br />Finally Hardy's descriptions of rural England and the people who inhabit including their dialects of the time are priceless.
031606792X|1.0|I received the series as a gift and I was immediately sucked into the guilty pleasure-inducing romance of Bella and Edward.  I quickly devoured the first three books in about four days.  I actually forced myself to wait a day before starting the fourth so that I could savor the series a bit longer - before starting again from the beginning.  I wish I had spent that time reading reviews - I could have left this terrible fourth book on the shelf.  I didn't know how I would be able to leave the characters - Would Meyer be able to wrap up all of the thrill, tension, and drama in just one book???  She did better than that - she systematically killed each and every one of her characters and replaced them with empty shells moving through a mediocre plot.  Some, like Jacob, went down with a fight, while Edward and Bella were quickly eliminated in the first few chapters...  Mutant spawn that grew at a such a speed that the reader has no chance of adjusting to the bad plot twist.  The mutant spawn tearing out of the main character's body - Where the heck did this all come from?  I am not sure if I could have enjoyed this book on its own, but as part of the series it did the best possible job of throwing a bucket of ice water on the fire produced in the first books.    MOVIE MAKERS - PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE follow the books through Eclipse and give us a NEW plot for Breaking Dawn.  I was too late to stop myself from reading this book, but I will NOT subject myself to the movie version.

B001K3JF7K|2.0|I am a tremendous Diana Krall fan, but Quiet Nights is so restrained, soft, and breathy that I was struggling to stay interested.  It is over-orchestrated and Diana's voice lacks that fresh jazz phrasing that defines most of her work. Missing was most of the excellent piano accompaniment that bookends her outstanding voice.  I felt that she was trying to be Peggy Lee rather than Diana Krall.  I kept flipping through the tracks trying to find something that sounded familiar to me.  She is capable of much better.
B000WM0P2E|4.0|After years of hearing hip hop on the radio (and usually turning it off) the sound has finally sunk in and I find myself humming/mumbling the songs under my breath (like Hands Up or The Boogie That Be) and figured I should buy the album so I can listen to it on my iPod.  I wasn't disappointed.  There's something almost soothing about the beat and the sound quality of this CD is excellent.  I listened to it on the surround sound system downstairs with the [[ASIN:B001M48VZ4 Velodyne DEQ-10R 10-Inch Powered Subwoofer (Black)]] pumped up and the sound was amazing.<br /><br />There's a lot of variety in the different songs and I'm finding myself liking some that I've never heard before, like Let's Get it Started.  Maybe I'll try another one of their albums.

0756405890|3.0|When I first started this book I was disappointed by the age of the story teller.  I was thought It would be a tale of a boy growing into a man,  creating a legend,  letting the reader follow him through his exciting journey.  However,  It is a frame story in which we go back into time while the main character [Kvothe] tells his story.  Rothfuss does this quite well,  yet I would prefer the story as before mentioned.  There is no real reason I can see for him to do this;  one reason is that after reading the whole book I feel like I do still do not know the direction of the story.    Alot of the book seems repetitive and too long.  I found myself wondering if the suspense was building to some exicting climax. I was mostly disapointed or lead on side journies of no real revelance.  It feels like the author got caught up in a certain element,  and when he finished it realized his book was too long.  The reader is rewarded with a dull ending.  Even though the main story drags on,  there are sub-stories within that are clever.  Rothfuss creates his own religion,  backing it up with a story that manages to weave into the main storyline.    The main character is truely likable and unique.  Some other reviewers marked him by his perfection,  which irritates them.  I however,  am the opposite.  I found Rothfuss' intial description of Kvothe's qualities and potential stray toward the end of the book.  He makes hims seem like a true legend in one scene,  but at the end he is bested by bothersome and distatesful characters that do not go away.    The magic system was interesting at first but it seemed to go in a direction that had a end point to it.  Limitations could be noted when the complexity could not be explained.  In other words,  the system started out cool but then later on Rothfuss seemed to tire of explaining it which left it dry.  Most of the magic in this book has strict limitations that Kvothe cannot surpass,  notice how I said most.  In the next books certain magics might be enhanced.        Reality in certain aspects of the book were suberb.  The events that happen to Kvothe are cruel,  and his reactions are realistic.  Rothfuss does a good job of making Kvothe a deep character.      Certain parts of this story are absolutely amazing which brings it from a two star to a three star.  If Only if the whole book could be like that. I am hesitant if I will read the next in the series.
1847242537|5.0|What can be new about a thriller? Thousands of them get churned out every year and, it seems, the most trashy ones end up on the bestseller lists. Almost all of them are terribly written, have a mediocre plot and have characters that you don't want to spend any time with in real life. And, then, you have a book like this which comes out of nowhere from an author who, alas, is no more.

B001FOPODS|1.0|This is such a deviation from Prokofiev's original that I cannot recommend it at all.  The original intent of this work is to get kids to apprecitate orchestral music.  This version does not introduce Prokofiev's music until 10 minutes into the feature and during this time Peter accidentally bumps into one of the hunters while walking the street and the hunter proceeds to toss Peter into a trash dumpster and point a gun at his head.

B001TH16DS|4.0|First the blu-ray version has both the altered effects version and the original version of each show.  I would have given this set a 5 star rating but the original versions of the shows were not cleaned up like the altered versions were.  The original versions of the shows are noticeably hazy and colors are not as sharp in areas of the show.  In the altered version these defects are corrected and look a lot better than the original version of the show. In Star Wars the original versions of each movie were cleaned up then the new effects were added to make the special directors edition but the original versions are also included cleaned up.<br /><br />The blu-ray version is almost identical to the hd version version so I would not waste money on the now defunct hd dvd version, although if you have the hd dvd version do not spend money getting the blu-ray version.<br /><br />Now the question begging to be answered is it worth the upgrade to Blu-ray from DVD.  The new Blu-ray enhanced version is far superior to the original DVD version.  If you like the unaltered version, do not spend your money on the Blu-ray disk.  The original unaltered versions on the Blu-ray disk are washed out, hazy, colors are flat and the picture is grainy in several of the episodes.<br /><br />You can tell the movie studio spent a lot of time making the enhanced version of each episode visually better.  Also the enhanced versions have true surround sound not mono like the original versions do.
B001ED7C58|5.0|still listen to it 2 or 3 times a week, I like it better than the score but it might be too close to call. Burwell is really very good at what he does. I would buy other works he's done and Robert Pattinson's piano work= better than average but his voice comes across as a little weak or the recording is, don't know which. Over all= A+.  Can see myself listeneing to it for a long time.
B001VB8UAE|5.0|Like most Streisand fans' I have longed for the DVD of the 2006 concert for two years. I saw Barbra Live in Atlanta in 2006, and O' what a great show it was! I also was at The Anaheim show on a Wednesday, July 20th, 1994, if I recall correctly. As one will see on this DVD collection Barbra's voice couldn't have been better in 1994 at The Arrowhead Pond. Yet it is the 2006 concert that really celebrates everything that make Barbra the greatest star, the legend for all times, and our best singer ever!  Even though the voice has changed it matters not, because one has never seen Barbra so relaxed, so warm and loving as she is on this concert in Florida in 2006. I had an ah hah moment when I watched the DVD.  It suddenly occurred to me it's not even Barbra's God given voice that make her the best, rather, it's her soul voice, if you will, that shines through out this concert.  It doesn't hurt that the visual presentation and sound are superior to any film concert I have ever seen. I can't imagine how the blu ray could be any better.  The packaging is also outstanding in this 3 DVD set. Each DVD is also a different color a nice touch, and there is a special booklet inside.  This is well worth the wait, and a real bargain!  It is simply Barbra at her best!

B0018CWEYY|4.0|I heard that season 4 really goes south, but I took a chance since I liked the first three seasons so much. Some of the plot is a bit of a stretch (I'm sure it must be hard to keep up the idea pool that long), but it's still very addicting. They do start skimping on the episodes as well (604 min vs. 991 in season 3). Nevertheless, I have no regrets purchasing the set. I'm still a fan...
0792844890|4.0|I used to own this on DVD but now it's missing but it's still a great Mel Brooks movie, one of his better later films.  I'm hoping to get an HDTV and Blu-ray player that way I can buy the Blu-ray version when it is released later this summer.  Once again, a hilarious spoof of sci-fi franchises, primarily Star Wars and Star Trek.
B000000OAA|5.0|This cd is absolutely amazing. It sounds so great, and it came in perfect condition as well as in less time than expected. Amazon did a great job with this, and if you love Queen as much as I do, you will fall in love with this album. It is amazing.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I love the way the story is told in this movie.  Even my 3 year old grandson has me play it over and over again.
B000YD7S2Q|5.0|I have seen 3 DVD productions of Lohengrin -- this one, the MET version with Hoffman/Marton, and the Vienna version with Domingo/Studer.  As is often the case, none is \\"ideal\\" but I rate this version significantly above the other two.  It doesn't have the strongest Lohengrin but Frey is certainly more than adequate.  His youthful appearance is a definite asset and if he is a little \\"wooden\\", that fits with the otherworldliness of the character.  (Domingo, by contrast, is more Melchior-like -- large voice and girth, great for a CD, not so credible for a DVD with many EXTREME CLOSEUPS.) Studer looks and sings well; her costumes (like those of others in this production) are of the generic flowing robes variety -- but they are colorful and can be viewed as both traditional and timeless.  (Again, for comparison, the costumes of the Vienna production are probably more accurate for 10th century Europe but are dismal in appearance; coupled with the low lighting and the claustrophobic stage and you have an ugly production.)  Ortrud (Schnaut) is a standout (certainly not a lovely voice, but a powerful one well suited for the character; also a good actress). But the overwhelming impression is that of viewing a fairy tale courtesy of the scenery, lighting, and stage movement that Herzog brings to the production.  Scenes appear to leap from a children's story book or, perhaps, a medieval book of hours.  There are changes of weather (snow), changes of light from night to day, rippling water, and so forth.  But the production is not literal like the MET and Vienna Lohengrins.  There is a smoke and laser show accompanying Lohengrin's entrance and exit (but it is in keeping with the fairy tale atmosphere).  For me, this production reflects the essence of Lohengrin -- a mythological tale that is enhanced by the lighting, colors, and careful arrangement of the singers in living tableaux.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I just finished the books up to the newest one that I will get very soon. I read all the books and then saw the show. I thought even though the HBO series is based very loosely on the books, I thought the characters were dead on with the ones from the books. The books were awesome and the series I thought were just as good. I'm definitely looked forward to series 2 and will most likely enjoy that as well.

0385333846|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five introduces us to Billy Pilgrim, a man who has become unstuck in time after being abducted by Tralfamadorians. We follow the eccentric (and perhaps insane) Pilgrim as he ambulates through different parts of his life, from \\"red\\" pre-nascence to \\"violet\\" death-by-high-powered-laser-gun. This jumbled tale of a World War 2 veteran deserves all five of the stars it receives.    It is hard to describe the plot of Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, his masterpiece of black humor. Pilgrim time-travels between periods of his life, and the period to which he travels to is not determined by his own volition. The narrative is neither chronological nor linear. Instead, it jumps back and forth in time and place, like the mole in the famous Whac-A-Mole arcade game. The novel is structured in small sections, each several paragraphs long that describe various moments of his life.  One of the most indubitably important motifs in the novel, and one of my personal favorites, is the image of a bird asking the question, \\"Poo-tee-weet?\\" Vonnegut relates this unanswerable question to the firebombing of Dresden. It corresponds to the question, `How could we allow such a repugnant massacre to happen? How can we describe it?' As with the bird's question however, there is no intelligent answer, no valid description, no indisputable truth. \\"And what do birds say? All there is to say about a massacre, things like `Poo-tee-weet?'\\".    Another underlying theme of the novel is Pilgrim's lack of free will. When he is abducted by the Tralfamadorians, they expound upon their view of time. Rather than seeing it in a straight line as humans do, they experience all parts and times of the line; they call it the fourth dimension. Because their view of the universe is characterized by ennui, the concept of free will is ethereal to them. This is underscored when Pilgrim's father tosses Billy into the pool in a \\"sink or swim philosophy\\"; as a young child, he promptly sunk likea rock, emphasizing the lack of control over his life. Ironically, Billy likes it at the bottom of the pool. Once again, however, he is not free to choose his fate, as he is rescued and taken out of the pool. Fate makes another, more significant choice for him later in life, when he is drafted into the army to fight in the Vietnam War.    Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, by far his most provocative work, exemplifies the meaninglessness and indescribability of the Dresden massacre and questions the boundaries of free will. This American classic embodies the feeling of lassitude and apathy that many soldiers felt returning from World War 2. It is thought-provoking and is one of the greatest anti-war novels ever written.
B001WCN23W|5.0|There isn't much I can add that has already been said thousands of times about the Rolling Stones 1971 classic \\"Sticky Fingers\\",so I'll get to the basics here about the 2009 reissue-the remastered sound,helmed by Stephen Marcussen and Stewart Whitmore,is a big leap forward over the 1994 Virgin-both the hard-rocking \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"B*tch\\" have more bite,kick and snarl,the acoustic passages of \\"Wild Horses\\",\\"Sister Morphine\\" \\"You Gotta Move\\" and \\"Moonlight Mile\\" sound clearer and more life-like,the bass no longer sounds like mud,and the top-end harshness of the previous CD editions is gone,balanced out to a tolerable level.The packaging is the same as the Virgin-plus no bonus tracks-so if sound quality is not an issue with you,then keep your old one.But given the reasonable price,I wouldn't deny any Rolling Stones or classic-rock fan the chance to hear this landmark album in a fresh sonic light,either!

B001WCN232|5.0|After a the four-album winning streak that began with 1968's \\"Beggar's Banquent\\" and and closed with 1972's \\"Exile On Main Street\\",\\"Goats Head Soup\\" got savaged by critics at the time for not living up to those lofty standards.When I got to listen to this album on its own terms,I really liked its fun mix of hard rock with R&B and funk.My faves are \\"Heartbreaker(Doo Doo Doo)\\",\\"Dancing With Mr. D\\",\\"100 Years Ago\\",\\"Silver Train\\" and the ballads such as the Keith-sung \\"Coming Down Again\\" and the Mick twin double slowies \\"Winter\\" and the #1 \\"Angie\\".The remastered version washes some of the sonic mud out and sounds clearer and better than ever.The only spike in this soup is the use the old U.S. master of \\"Star Star\\" that has the Mick vocal overdub of \\"that's what I call obscene\\" that half-heartedly tried to obscure the offensive line \\" I bet you keep your p**** clean\\".I not bothered by that;the nasty line is still quite audible here.The packaging is the same as the Virgin-plus no bonus tracks-so if sound quality is not a issue with you,then keep your old Virgin one.But I wouldn't deny Stones fans to hear this gem in a new sonic light,given the reasonable price.
B001DJLD1M|1.0|The idea is very good--having all four films on two double sided CDs--except that the quality control is very lacking.  I got a set of two identical CDs with Matrix 3 and Animatrix.

B000002GZ1|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the greatest blues CDs ever made.    There aren't many recordings that sound fresh after forty-some years, but this is one of them. The Butterfield Blues Band lineup on this CD played with authority and conviction.     Mike Bloomfield is at his peak here. I believe he's playing a Fender Telecaster guitar. Mike's solos are fluid and tasteful. And the same can be said for the other soloists, most specifically Paul Butterfield, master of the blues harp.     The songs are all excellent and something new and interesting can be detected in every listening.
1596680199|5.0|I found a lot of very useful information in this book, especially in the \\"Faux Techniques\\" section (it joins \\"Faux Surfaces in Polymer Clay\\" as being my current favorites in this category). The steps are not only listed and explained, there's very clear pictures to guide you along the way. Very helpful when you're trying to match what you've got in your hand with what they say it should look like!  It's got the usual basics for the beginners, but I would say it's even better for those who already have a basic understanding of polymer clay. Definitely a keeper...
0765342294|5.0|Hands down one of the best books I have ever read.    Card's book has vivid characters, ones you come to love (or hate), a plot that sucks you in and twists you around, and the timing and pacing are all spot on. His jumps in time are barely noticeable, they're so smooth, and that is one mean feat. It's nearly perfect the way it is. Adding description or more advanced language would slow the book down, and distract from the main point. Only someone following some irrelevant convention because it makes them feel more academic would think otherwise. Until I came here I honestly had not considered this as something to complain about.     No my only complaint is in one, and yes, only one, scene of the book. SPOILER ALERT (I hate reading reviews that ruin the end): When Ender fights the final battle and destroys all (but one) of the buggers, I honestly thought he was just going to blow everyone up, including his own ships. He thought it was a game. He wanted to cheat, rebel. Why not? And it was a big, no, colossal gamble on their part that he wouldn't. A friend, however, tells me that there is something in a later book that basically makes this concern disappear. Awesome. Almost doesn't matter however, for in any book you must suspend at least some disbelieve, and that is much easier when the book has touched your soul.    I can truly say I have not been this emotionally invested into a character in a long time. When the truth is revealed, I was in shock. Then more truth is revealed and my heart was wrenched in my chest. I stared into space, deep in thought for a long time after finishing this book. Which is something I've been looking for from a book, for a long time now.
B00009P1MP|5.0|Don McLean is a skillful storyteller and this CD of some of his earliest work is an outstanding reminder of the times of the 70's.  It is easy listening with the thought provoking \\"American Pie\\" and the Vincent Van Goah salute \\"Vincent.\\"  Wonderful music!
B000BP5V0S|2.0|This DVD calims it has bonus of \\"....with The Viena State and Volksoper Ballet...\\" and it has a sticker on the front of the DVD claiming the same. However those are NOT on the DVD at all. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out where the Ballet go on the DVD - it's not on IT. It was such a surpise to me because the main reson I bought this DVD instead of its CD version of the concert is that I really like the Ballet (from the live - broadcast on new year's concert).  I like products of this recording company \\"Deutsche Grammophon\\" and I have many CD collections from this company. I just couldn't figure out why this is happenning!!! I was disappointed even though the music was excellent.
B00005JM0B|4.0|If you watched the first two movies in this \\"series,\\" particularly the second film, then most of this should be very familiar territory. You can expect to see more of the same, meaning:    1 - Some spectacular action scenes; 2 - more action than is needed; 3 - A supposedly-unstoppable villain robot (this time a female); 3 - profane and somewhat annoying lead characters, except for Arnold, of course; 4 - seeing some naked butts (odd knowing one is the governor of Califronia); 5 - humor mixed in with all the violence; 6 - great overall special-effects and surround sound.    The first 30 minutes of this movie was the best part, I thought. Overall, there was so much action it wore me out but it was a worthy sequel to the last movie. If you enjoyed watching what the \\"bad cyborg\\" Robert Patrick could do in the \\"Terminator 2,\\" you'll really be entertained by his successor, played by Kristannia Loken. Like Patrick, she doesn't say much....but doesn't have to. Schwarzenegger, meanwhile, performs admirably in his last starring role (I think) before tackling bigger responsibilities in real life.

B00008PC2O|4.0|I usually don't rate highly movies in which I can't stand listening to two-thirds of the lead characters, but this film has so many spectacular, memorable moments it always fascinates me....and brings me back for more viewings.  Now I see this \\"Extreme\\" DVD edtiion is on sale here at Amazon for a mere $4.99.  Wow, now that's a deal.    I enjoyed all three of the \\"Terminator\\" films but this one has always stood out.....because of the villain and the incredible special-effects.    When this movie came out, the FX regarding Robert Patrick's cyborg-patrol cop were so jaw- dropping, so astounding that people couldn't believe what they were seeing. Some 15 years later, they are still cool.     Watching Patrick morph into various characters is incredible, literally changing shapes or having his fingers or arms extend to an awl-like instruments. For a long time, he looks like the most indestructible \\"person\\" I've ever seen in a film. He certainly is still one of the most unique villains ever shown on film.    Arnold Schwarzenegger, an intelligent but less-advanced cyborg, plays the only likable character. The mother-son combination of Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong are too hard-edged, too smart-mouthed for my tastes. Hamilton was a lot more feminine and humanistic in the first \\"Terminator.\\" Now she's ultra-macho and profane. Much worse than her is her kid, a real punk if there ever was one. There's something very irritating about Furlong, and not just the character he plays here. I'm not surprised he never became a star.    Still, despite all these annoyances, as a fan of special-effects and a good adventure yarn, I can't help but wonder now how this looks on Blu-Ray!  I guess others do, too, which which may be why this \\"Extreme\\" edition can be had for such a small price.
B000001FNL|5.0|I had been looking for this cd for a long time but could not find it at an affordable price, as it is rare. I bought it used but in very good condition. It came exactly as it was advertised, even better than I expected. Would shop here again. Very satisfied.
